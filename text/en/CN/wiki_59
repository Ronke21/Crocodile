<text>Great Salt Plains Lake is a reservoir located within the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma in the United States named because of the salt flats in the area and for the Salt Fork Arkansas River, which is dammed to form the lake. It is notable for the variety of birds that are attracted to Ralstin Island (not open to the public) and also for the selenite crystals that can be collected along the shoreline. Recent droughts, most notably that of 2011, have had an adverse effect on the future of the lake.

==Physical description==
A study made in 1931 for the United States Army Corps of Engineers proposed building a flood control dam in the Great Salt Plains area. Congress authorized its construction in 1936. Design studies began in 1937 and the Corps broke ground for construction in September 1938. The dam was completed in July 1941, with a water capacity of . The lake covers and has of shoreline. The average depth is . The saline content is reportedly one-fourth that of the ocean.

Ralstin Island, created at the same time as the lake, is home to blue heron, great egret and ibis. The island is considered one of the most important colonial bird nesting habitats, and is the largest breeding site in the state for the white-faced ibis.
The fish vary from catfish, saugeye (related to the walleye) sandbass and hybrid striped bass.

The State of Oklahoma leased on August 1, 1958, for a state park.

==Selenite crystals==

On the west edge of the lake, visitors can dig for selenite crystals. These crystals feature an hourglass inclusion which is unique to the Great Salt Plains. Scientists believe that salt was deposited during repeated water-level rises of a shallow sea millions of years ago. The supply of salt is kept intact by saline groundwater that flows just a few feet below the surface. When the water evaporates, a layer of salt remains on the surface. This process also plays a role in the formation of selenite crystals that visitors covet.

==Future of the lake==
The lake is subject to periodic mass fish kills, most recently in 2011. During the extreme drought of that year, the average depth decreased to . According to John Stahl, northwest fisheries supervisor for the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, the lake has grown more shallow since its creation because of silting and agricultural runoff. That and extremely hot dry summers cause the brine to become more concentrated. Oxygen in the water is mostly consumed by bacteria that break down organic matter in the water, leaving insufficient oxygen to support the fish.

According to officials of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the future of the lake appears grim if no remedial action is taken. Proposed solutions are:
* Open the dam and allow the lake to flow into the river. 
* Dig the silt out of the reservoir, which could cost $5 – 10 million.
* Plug the dam to raise the water level.

There is a law requiring that a non federal partner help pay for restoration. The Corps regards this as an unlikely event. If no action is taken, the Corps has said that the seafood source will be depleted and the birds will abandon the lake.

==Recreation==
Also located along the shores of Great Salt Plains Lake is Great Salt Plains State Park. Recreational opportunities at Great Salt Plains State Park include boating, camping, picnicking, swimming, hiking, mountain biking and exploring. The park has RV and tent sites, comfort stations with showers, cabins, picnic sites, group shelters, swimming beach, playgrounds, boat ramps, fishing dock and equestrian trails.

<text>Lake Eufaula, sometimes referred to as Eufaula Lake, is a reservoir in Oklahoma. It is located on the Canadian River, upstream from its confluence with the Arkansas River and near the town of Eufaula. The lake covers parts of McIntosh County, Pittsburg, Haskell and Okmulgee counties and drains . Water sources include the Canadian, North Fork Canadian and Deep Fork rivers. It is the largest-capacity lake in the state of Oklahoma with a volume of , a surface area of and of shoreline.

==History==
Congress approved construction of the dam and lake in 1946 to provide flood control, hydroelectric power, water supply, navigation and recreation. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction of the 975 meter-long (3,199 feet) Eufaula Dam wall in 1956 and was completed in 1964. President Lyndon B. Johnson came to Oklahoma to dedicate the dam on September 25, 1964. The dam holds back a lake area of over . The hydroelectric power station was designed to provide 90,000 kilowatts of electric power from the lake waters.

According to the Corps of Engineers in 2015, the Eufaula project cost $121.4 million, and has prevented nearly $575.5 million in flood damages since its completion. The lake attracts about 2.5 million visitors every year.
Heavy rains in the spring of 2015 caused Lake Eufaula to rise so rapidly that the Corps of Engineers opened the flood gates and released water at rates as high as per second. This was the highest rate since 1990.

==Dam construction==
Eufaula Dam is east of the city of Eufaula, Oklahoma. It is long and high. It is constructed with an earthen embankment and concrete. The associated hydroelectric power plant has three turbines, each rated at 30 megawatts, for a total installed capacity of 90 megawatts The dam was approved by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1946 and construction began in 1956. In February 1964, the river was closed and the generators went operational in September 1964. State Highway 71 runs across the top of the dam.

== Standing Rock ==

Standing Rock is now covered by the waters of Lake Eufaula. The historic landmark stood in the middle of the Canadian river about below the junction of the North and South Canadians. When the lake is at its top level, , the top of the huge upright rock is approximately below the surface.

==Recreational facilities==
Activities at Lake Eufaula include boating, fishing, swimming, hiking, hunting, golfing and horseback riding. Picnic areas are scattered throughout the area. Facilities include marinas, boat ramps, swim beaches, tent and RV campsites, cabins, group shelters, restrooms, showers and an enclosed fishing dock. These can be found at Lake Eufaula State Park and the physically-separate Arrowhead Area at Lake Eufaula State Park.

A well-known tournament lake, Lake Eufaula draws anglers from across the United States to test their skills at catching largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, Kentucky bass, crappie, catfish, sandbass, stripers (below the dam), and other species.

==Former State Park Lodges==
Oklahoma created two state parks, Arrowhead and Fountainhead, to provide recreational activities and camping facilities at the lake. The tag line in their early advertising was, &quot;Follow the fun to Eufaula.&quot; The state borrowed $8 million from the Federal government to build a lodge at each park. However, the lodges did not provide enough money to repay the loan, so ownership reverted to the Federal government. In 1986, the U.S. Economic Administration sold Arrowhead Lodge to the Choctaw Nation and Fountainhead Lodge to a group of private investors. Arrowhead switched hands again in 2000, when a non-profit group with ties to the Church of Scientology bought the lodge and converted it into a drug and alcohol treatment facility, now called Narconon Arrowhead. Fountainhead was sold out of a sheriff&#x27;s sale to The Muscogee (Creek) Nation in 2005, amid plans to reopen it as a gaming facility. Those plans never materialized, and the lodge was torn down. However, a 48-acre tract of the land was placed into federal trust status in 2018, opening the way for development of the property as a tourist destination with gaming, restaurants and entertainment.

<doc id="1250114" wikidata="Q6477830" url="?curid=1250114" title="Lake Stanley Draper">
<text>Lake Stanley Draper is a reservoir in southeast Oklahoma City, United States. It is one of three municipal reservoirs in the city. Principal construction on the reservoir occurred between 1962-1963. Upon completion it was named after the long-time director of the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce, Stanley Draper. Located between Midwest Boulevard and Post Road, near I-240, it receives water by pipeline from Atoka Lake and McGee Creek Reservoir.

==History==
The lake was begun in 1962 to serve as a reservoir for Oklahoma City.

==Description==
It has a surface area of , an average depth of and a maximum depth of . The volume is 

==Recreation==
The lake is open for a number of things including, fishing, ATVs or dirt bikes, R.C. airplanes, boating (sailing, Water skiing, and jet skiing). Water skiing is allowed in the main body of the lake, but swimming is prohibited everywhere in the lake. There are four covered fishing piers, primitive campgrounds, picnic grounds, grills and rest rooms.

==Maintenance==
In March 2010 City of Oklahoma City began work for the Atoka Pump Station Rehabilitation Project (APSRP). During the project 24 new pumps were installed while six others were refurbished along the Atoka Pipeline. During that time, the pumps were periodically shut down to allow for installation and refurbishment, which caused lake water levels to drop well below its normal pool depth of . Because of the low water levels all boating is prohibited, with only authorized personnel allowed on the water. On February 25, 2011, the pipeline was brought back to full service allowing water to be pumped from Lake Atoka to Draper. From February 2011 the lake&#x27;s water level remained low due to the lack of heavy rainfall because of the then ongoing drought and water usage by residents of Oklahoma City. The City expected that the lake would return to levels high enough to allow recreational use by late fall 2013. In April 2015 following substantial rainfall, the lake reached and passed its pool depth, bringing the lake back to full capacity.

== In Popular Culture ==
Lake Stanley Draper is featured prominently in a Free Nights and Weekends Podcast episode in 2024.

<text>Canton Lake is a lake in Blaine and Dewey Counties in Oklahoma, near Longdale and Canton. Its main source of water is the North Canadian River. It is about an hour away from Enid. The lake serves as a municipal water supply reservoir for Oklahoma City, which pays to have water released from the lake for water-supply purposes.

Canton Dam was a 1948 project of the Southwestern Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The earthen structure is high and long at its crest, with a maximum storage capacity of 383,000 acre-feet. The lake has a shoreline of . Canton is owned and operated by the Army Corps of Engineers but Oklahoma City retains the storage rights.

The lake is home to several species of fish, including largemouth bass, white bass, channel catfish, crappie, and walleye. Canton has become the primary source of walleye eggs for incubation and stocking of other state lakes. Since 1968, community leaders and local merchants have promoted an annual Walleye Rodeo. The four-day event offers visitors the chance to win cash and other prizes that total over $30,000.

Facilities at the lake include boat ramps, picnic areas, RV and tent campsites, drinking water, group shelters, restrooms, showers, a swimming beach, concession services, and a nature trail.

In early 2013, Oklahoma City officials diverted 30,000 acre-ft of water from Canton Lake to Lake Hefner, to replenish the city&#x27;s water supply. Later, spring rains replenished the level of that lake, which had to dump water into the North Canadian River to prevent the lake from overflowing. However, the effect was to leave Canton Lake below its normal level. This has contributed to an algae bloom.

In April 2016, the lake finally replenished from the 2013 water diversion Oklahoma City made.

In August 2022, Oklahoma City officials have requested a water release from Canton Lake to replenish Lake Hefner. The release is planned to lower lake Canton by about and raise Lake Hefner by an equal amount

It is owned by Oklahoma Gas and Electric (OG&amp;E) Company. and was constructed in 1968-70, to provide cooling for a nearby gas-fired electric power generation plant. It impounds Jumper Creek, about east of the city of Konawa, Oklahoma.

==Description==
Konawa Reservoir supplies cooling water for a gas-fired electric power generation plant owned by Oklahoma Gas and Electric (OG&amp;E) Company and located in Seminole County, Oklahoma. The plant has three steam-driven turbine generators and a gas turbine with a combined capacity of 1,534 megawatts (MWe). When the three main steam-driven generators are on-line, the plant must circulate a million gallons of water per minute (GPM) through its exhaust steam condensers.

The reservoir has a surface area of , a shoreline of and a rated capacity of . The mean depth is and the maximum depth is . The pool surface elevation is above mean sea level. The lake level is maintained by pumping water from the South Canadian River as needed.

==Recreation==
Rod and reel fishing is allowed at Konawa. State fishing laws apply and a valid fishing license is required. Water skiers and personal watercraft are also allowed to use the lake. Houseboats are prohibited.

==Wildlife==
In 2003, Konawa ranked first among Oklahoma Lakes larger than 1,000 acres in the production of Largemouth bass. Other species of fish include:Channel Catfish, Flathead Catfish, Hybrid Striped Bass, Sunfish and White Bass.

<text>McGee Creek Reservoir is a reservoir in Atoka County, Oklahoma. It impounds the waters of McGee Creek and several smaller streams, including Potapo, Panther, Little Bugaboo, Bear, Blue, Mill, and Crooked creeks, all of which are tributaries of Muddy Boggy River. According to the Bureau of Reclamation (BuRec), the reservoir was designed to extend up McGee Creek and up Potapo Creek when the water is at &quot;conservation level.

McGee Creek Lake is bordered by the McGee Creek Wildlife Management Area, the McGee Creek Natural State Scenic Recreation Area, and McGee Creek State Park. The combined effect of these protected lands is to afford the area the same rural and isolated nature it has always known.

==Description==

===Reservoir===
McGee Creek Lake is east of Atoka; west of Antlers and north of Farris, Oklahoma

The reservoir, which filled at the completion of the United States Bureau of Reclamation McGee Dam in 1987, consists of surface area and of shoreline. Its pool elevation is above sea level and it holds . At flood stage its pool elevation is above sea level and its storage capacity rises to . The reservoir has a maximum depth of at the dam when the water is at conservation pool level.

===Dam and river outlet===
The dam is an earth-filled structure that is long and high across McGee Creek. An earthen dike long and high, blocks several saddles on the west side of the reservoir rim. A riprap blanket prevents erosion of the upstream sides of both the dam and the dike. The river outlet works located on the east side of the dam release water to McGee Creek under extreme conditions. The works include an intake structure, three conduits (each about in diameter), a stilling basin, associated gates and controls. The discharge channel to McGee Creek can pass flows ranging from to per second.

===Municipal water outlet===
Water from the lake is routinely pumped to municipal consumers via pipeline. The municipal outlet works has a bypass that diverts directly downstream to McGee Creek. This provides a constant stream of water that is beneficial to marine life. The river outlet works, located on the east side of the dam, handle this function. A separate intake leads to three conduits (each diameter), which terminate in a stilling basin, that has a single pipe leading to the three variable-capacity centrifugal discharge pumps. The pumps discharge into a surge tank at the Atoka Lake, away, via a concrete pipe that is diameter. Other pumps then transfer the water to Oklahoma City.

==History==
The McGee Creek Project and McGee Creek Authority were established in 1978 to develop and maintain the McGee Creek Reservoir to provide a municipal and industrial water supply for areas in central and southern Oklahoma, including Oklahoma City and Atoka County. Under the direct supervision of superintendent Glen Russell, the authority has operated and maintained the reservoir and associated facilities, including an attached water pipeline, a surge tank, a regulating tank, a maintenance complex, and land easements surrounding these facilities. The U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation owns the reservoir, but has granted McGee Creek Authority ownership title to the project office, aqueduct and appurtenances, and other operation and maintenance related facilities.

<text>Created in 1975, Tom Steed Reservoir is a reservoir in Kiowa County, Oklahoma, northwest of the city of Snyder, Oklahoma. The reservoir area was created by damming West Otter Creek and diverting flows of Elk Creek through the Bretch Diversion Canal by Mountain Park Dam. Tom Steed Reservoir is the main feature of the Mountain Park Project of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. It provides municipal and industrial water to the cities of Snyder, Altus, and Frederick, as well as the Hackberry Flat Wildlife Management Area.

== Dam ==

Mountain Park Dam is located just upstream of Snyder Dam, on Otter Creek near Mountain Park, Oklahoma. A thin double-curvature concrete arch flanked by concrete thrust blocks, Mountain Park Dam is 535 feet (163 m) in length with a maximum structural height of 133 feet (41 m). This dam and the rolled earth East and West Dike embankments, which extend 10,311 and 13,235 feet (3143 and 4034 m), respectively, form the Tom Steed Reservoir. The reservoir has a total capacity of , an active capacity of , and a surface area at the top of conservation pool of approximately 6,400 acres (26 km²). Its elevation is .

== Recreation and wildlife ==
The Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department administers 6,100 acres (25 km²) on the east and south shores of the reservoir. Public recreation facilities on the east side include shelters, tables, grills, a comfort station, a boat launching ramp, and a swimming beach. The area south of the dam along Otter Creek offers picnic facilities and a bridge across the creek which leads to a nature trail through large cottonwood, ash, elm, walnut, and pecan trees.

The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation administers 5,150 acres (21 km²) of the west and north side of the reservoir area. Waterfowl and dove are plentiful, and other upland game species are increasing as more food and cover are developed. An extensive tree and shrub planting program continues to increase wildlife habitat. The reservoir is one of the best fishing areas in southwest Oklahoma, offering catfish, crappie, largemouth black bass, and other varieties.

Great Plains State Park is located on the shore of Tom Steed Reservoir.

<doc id="1250124" wikidata="Q4071926" url="?curid=1250124" title="Random number generator attack">
<text>The security of cryptographic systems depends on some secret data that is known to authorized persons but unknown and unpredictable to others. To achieve this unpredictability, some randomization is typically employed. Modern cryptographic protocols often require frequent generation of random quantities. Cryptographic attacks that subvert or exploit weaknesses in this process are known as random number generator attacks.

A high quality random number generation (RNG) process is almost always required for security, and lack of quality generally provides attack vulnerabilities and so leads to lack of security, even to complete compromise, in cryptographic systems. The RNG process is particularly attractive to attackers because it is typically a single isolated hardware or software component easy to locate. If the attacker can substitute pseudo-random bits generated in a way they can predict, security is totally compromised, yet generally undetectable by any upstream test of the bits. Furthermore, such attacks require only a single access to the system that is being compromised. No data need be sent back in contrast to, say, a computer virus that steals keys and then e-mails them to some drop point.

==Human generation of random quantities==
Humans generally do poorly at generating random quantities. Magicians, professional gamblers and con artists depend on the predictability of human behavior. In World War II German code clerks were instructed to select three letters at random to be the initial rotor setting for each Enigma machine message. Instead some chose predictable values like their own or a girlfriend&#x27;s initials, greatly aiding Allied breaking of these encryption systems. Another example is the often predictable ways computer users choose passwords (see password cracking).

Nevertheless, in the specific case of playing mixed strategy games, use of human gameplay entropy for randomness generation was studied by Ran Halprin and Moni Naor.

==Attacks==

===Software RNGs===
Just as with other components of a cryptosystem, a software random number generator should be designed to resist certain attacks. Some attacks possible on a RNG include (from):

; Direct cryptanalytic attack: when an attacker obtained part of the stream of random bits and can use this to distinguish the RNG output from a truly random stream.
; Input-based attacks: modify the input to the RNG to attack it, for example by &quot;flushing&quot; existing entropy out of the system and put it into a known state.
; State compromise extension attacks: when the internal secret state of the RNG is known at some time, use this to predict future output or to recover previous outputs. This can happen when a generator starts up and has little or no entropy (especially if the computer has just been booted and followed a very standard sequence of operations), so an attacker may be able to obtain an initial guess at the state.

===Hardware RNGs===
A number of attacks on hardware random number generators are possible, including trying to capture radio-frequency emissions from the computer (obtaining hard drive interrupt times from motor noise, for example), or trying to feed controlled signals into a supposedly random source (such as turning off the lights in a lava lamp or feeding a strong, known signal into a sound card).

===RNG subversion===
Subverted random numbers can be created using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator with a seed value known to the attacker but concealed in the software. A relatively short, say 24 to 40 bit, portion of the seed can be truly random to prevent tell-tale repetitions, but not long enough to prevent the attacker from recovering, say, a &quot;randomly&quot; produced key.

Random numbers typically go through several layers of hardware and software before they are used. Bits may be generated in a peripheral device, sent over a serial cable, collected in an operating system utility and retrieved by a system call. The subverted bits can be substituted at any point in this process with little likelihood of detection.

A hardware circuit to produce subverted bits can be built on an integrated circuit a few millimeters square. The most sophisticated hardware random number generator can be subverted by placing such a chip anywhere upstream of where the source of randomness is digitized, say in an output driver chip or even in the cable connecting the RNG to the computer. The subversion chip can include a clock to limit the start of operation to some time after the unit is first turned on and run through acceptance tests, or it can contain a radio receiver for on/off control. It could be installed by the manufacturer at the behest of their national signals intelligence service, or added later by anyone with physical access. CPU chips with built-in hardware random number generators can be replaced by compatible chips with a subverted RNG in the chips&#x27; firmware.

==Defenses==
* Mix (with, for example, xor) hardware generated random numbers with the output of a good quality stream cipher, as close to the point of use as possible. The stream cipher key or seed should be changeable in a way that can be audited and derived from a trustworthy source, e.g. dice throws. The Fortuna random number generator is an example of an algorithm which uses this mechanism.
* Generate passwords and passphrases using a true random source. Some systems select random passwords for the user rather than let users propose their own.
* Use encryption systems that document how they generate random numbers and provide a method to audit the generation process.
* Build security systems with off the shelf hardware, preferably purchased in ways that do not reveal its intended use, e.g. off the floor at a large retail establishment. From this perspective, sound cards and webcams may be a better source of randomness than hardware made for that purpose.
* Maintain complete physical control over the hardware after it has been purchased. The hardware should at one place or location and need no other transmission to a peer-to-peer hardware. Attacks are on the line in the network not the hardware itself.

Designing a secure random number generator requires at least as high a level of care as designing other elements of a cryptographic system.

==Prominent examples==

===Predictable Netscape seed===
Early versions of Netscape&#x27;s Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption protocol used pseudo-random quantities derived from a PRNG seeded with three variable values: the time of day, the process ID, and the parent process ID. These quantities are often relatively predictable, and so have little entropy and are less than random, and so that version of SSL was found to be insecure as a result. The problem was reported to Netscape in 1994 by Phillip Hallam-Baker, then a researcher in the CERN Web team, but was not fixed prior to release. The problem in the running code was discovered in 1995 by Ian Goldberg and David Wagner, who had to reverse engineer the object code because Netscape refused to reveal the details of its random number generation (security through obscurity). That RNG was fixed in later releases (version 2 and higher) by more robust (i.e., more random and so higher entropy from an attacker&#x27;s perspective) seeding.

===Microsoft Windows 2000/XP random number generator===
Microsoft used an unpublished algorithm to generate random values in older versions of its Windows operating system. These random quantities are made available to users via the CryptGenRandom utility. In November 2007, Leo Dorrendorf et al. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and University of Haifa published a paper titled &quot;Cryptanalysis of the Random Number Generator of the Windows Operating System&quot;. The paper presented serious weaknesses in Microsoft&#x27;s approach at the time. The paper&#x27;s conclusions were based on disassembly of the code in Windows 2000, but according to Microsoft applied to Windows XP as well. Microsoft has stated that the problems described in the paper have been addressed in subsequent releases of Windows, which use a different RNG implementation.

===Possible backdoor in Elliptic Curve DRBG===
The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology has published a collection of &quot;deterministic random bit generators&quot; it recommends as NIST Special Publication 800-90. One of the generators, Dual_EC_DRBG, was favored by the National Security Agency. Dual_EC_DRBG uses elliptic curve technology and includes a set of recommended constants. In August 2007, Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson of Microsoft showed that the constants could be constructed in such a way as to create a kleptographic backdoor in the algorithm. 
In September 2013 &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the N.S.A. had inserted a back door into a 2006 standard adopted by N.I.S.T... called the Dual EC DRBG standard&quot;, thereby revealing that the NSA carried out a malware attack against the American people.
In December 2013, Reuters reported that documents released by Edward Snowden indicated that the NSA had paid RSA Security $10 million to make Dual_EC_DRBG the default in their encryption software, and raised further concerns that the algorithm might contain a backdoor for the NSA. Due to these concerns, in 2014, NIST withdrew Dual EC DRBG from its draft guidance on random number generators, recommending &quot;current users of Dual_EC_DRBG transition to one of the three remaining approved algorithms as quickly as possible.&quot;

===MIFARE Crypto-1===
Crypto-1 is a cryptosystem developed by NXP for use on MIFARE chips. The system is proprietary and originally the algorithm has not been published. Upon reverse engineering of the chip, researchers from the University of Virginia and the Chaos Computer Club found an attack on Crypto-1 exploiting a poorly initialized random number generator.

===Debian OpenSSL===
In May 2008, security researcher Luciano Bello revealed his discovery that changes made in 2006 to the random number generator in the version of the OpenSSL package distributed with Debian Linux and other Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu, dramatically reduced the entropy of generated values and made a variety of security keys vulnerable to attack. The security weakness was caused by changes made to the openssl code by a Debian developer in response to compiler warnings of apparently redundant code. This caused a massive worldwide regeneration of keys, and despite all attention the issue got, it could be assumed many of these old keys are still in use. Key types affected include SSH keys, OpenVPN keys, DNSSEC keys, key material for use in X.509 certificates and session keys used in SSL/TLS connections. Keys generated with GnuPG or GNUTLS are not affected as these programs used different methods to generate random numbers. Keys generated by non-Debian-based Linux distributions are also unaffected. The weak-key-generation vulnerability was promptly patched after it was reported, but any services still using keys that were generated by the old code remain vulnerable. A number of software packages now contain checks against a weak key blacklist to attempt to prevent use of any of these remaining weak keys, but researchers continue to find weak key implementations.

===PlayStation 3===
In December 2010, a group calling itself &quot;fail0verflow&quot; announced recovery of the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) private key used by Sony to sign software for the PlayStation 3 game console. The attack was made possible because Sony failed to generate a new random nonce for each signature.

===RSA public key factoring===
An analysis comparing millions of RSA public keys gathered from the Internet was announced in 2012 by Lenstra, Hughes, Augier, Bos, Kleinjung, and Wachter. They were able to factor 0.2% of the keys using only Euclid&#x27;s algorithm. They exploited a weakness unique to cryptosystems based on integer factorization. If is one public key and is another, then if by chance , then a simple computation of factors both &quot;n&quot; and &quot;n&quot;′, totally compromising both keys. Nadia Heninger, part of a group that did a similar experiment, said that the bad keys occurred almost entirely in embedded applications, and explains that the one-shared-prime problem uncovered by the two groups results from situations where the pseudorandom number generator is poorly seeded initially and then reseeded between the generation of the first and second primes.

===Java nonce collision===
In August 2013, it was revealed that bugs in the Java class SecureRandom could generate collisions in the &quot;k&quot; nonce values used for ECDSA in implementations of Bitcoin on Android. When this occurred the private key could be recovered, in turn allowing stealing Bitcoins from the containing wallet.

<doc id="1250126" wikidata="Q2927739" url="?curid=1250126" title="Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid">
<text>Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid is a 1942 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon, directed by Bob Clampett, produced by Leon Schlesinger, and released to theatres by Warner Bros. Pictures. It marks the first appearance of Beaky Buzzard (named &quot;Killer&quot; in this story) in a Warner Bros. short.

The title is a Brooklyn-accented way of saying &quot;gets the bird&quot;, which can refer to an obscene gesture, or as simply the &quot;Bronx cheer&quot;; in this case, it is also used metaphorically, as Bugs &quot;gets&quot; the bird (Beaky) by playing a trick.

==Plot==
A shy and slow buzzard named Killer (Kent Rogers impersonating Edgar Bergen as Mortimer Snerd) is tasked by his mother to catch dinner, specifically a rabbit. Killer spots Bugs Bunny and attempts to catch him, but Bugs outsmarts him, causing Killer to crash and become unable to move or speak. Bugs, emerging from his rabbit hole, engages in playful banter with Killer, who eventually reveals his intention to have Bugs for dinner. Bugs, in a playful disguise, teases and embarrasses Killer, leading to a chase.

During the chase, Killer briefly captures Bugs but is tricked into releasing him. Bugs, using clever tactics, makes it appear as though he has died, leading Killer to believe he has killed Bugs. Bugs plays along, pretending to sob and then revealing himself unharmed. The two characters engage in a playful dance, jitterbugging together. After a spin, Beaky ends up in the same predicament Bugs initially feigned, buried in the ground. Killer&#x27;s mother arrives, initially thinking Bugs harmed her son, but Bugs reassures her and pulls Killer out, revealing he is unharmed.

Relieved and grateful, Beaky&#x27;s mother abandons her plan to eat Bugs and instead declares him a hero, kissing him. Bugs, mimicking Beaky&#x27;s shyness and embarrassment, blushes in response.

==Voice cast==
* Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny / Young Buzzards
* Kent Rogers as Killer
* Sara Berner as Mama Buzzard

==Reception==
Charles Carney, former Warner Bros. writer and editor, writes, &quot;Clampett, one of the midwives of Bugs&#x27;s deepening character, proceeds at his trademark breakneck speed... Bugs would go on to outwit a catalog of adversaries throughout the years, from the merely dumb to the diabolical. But his struggles with Killer... remain a classic of two memorable young characters in a comic battle for survival.&quot;

A contemporary review in &quot;The Film Daily&quot; said, &quot;More hilarious adventures of Bugs Bunny are recorded herein to the complete satisfaction of young and old... This Technicolor cartoon is loaded with solid laughs.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid&quot; was released on DVD in 2003 as part of &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1&quot;, the first &quot;Spotlight Collection&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2&quot;.

Having been theatrically released alongside the 1942 film &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, it has been also included on that DVD.

<doc id="1250127" wikidata="Q2255530" url="?curid=1250127" title="World Wrestling All-Stars">
<text>World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) was a professional wrestling promotion founded by Australian concert promoter Andrew McManus in 2001. The promotion was operated by McManus&#x27; International Touring Company. WWA was one of several promotions to come into existence shortly after the closings of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The company was in existence from October 2001 to May 2003.

==History==
WWA recruited former WCW ring announcer Jeremy Borash as booker and head of talent for its shows. He also acted as ring announcer and commentator for their shows. Borash was recommended to the WWA by Vince Russo, who was not able to work with the company as originally planned. WWA focused on signing the wrestlers that did not get signed by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) after the WWF-WCW merger. They aimed to fill the gap left by the demise of World Championship Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling and provide an alternative to the World Wrestling Federation (now known as World Wrestling Entertainment).

Many popular former WWF and WCW wrestlers wrestled for the company during its nearly two-year existence. These included Jeff Jarrett, Road Dogg, Scott Steiner, Sting, Psicosis, Devon Storm, Juventud Guerrera, Rick Steiner, Jerry Lynn, Shane Douglas, Buff Bagwell, Lex Luger, Stevie Ray, Sabu and Disco Inferno.

They also brought in relatively unknown wrestlers, many of whom went on to make names for themselves for other promotions like TNA. These included Low Ki, A.J. Styles, Christopher Daniels, Frankie Kazarian, Shark Boy, and Nathan Jones (known as &quot;the Colossus of Boggo Road). Further big names like Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Randy Savage were scheduled to appear for WWA at some point but their appearances did not happen. The promotion had three in ring commissioners during its time, namely Bret Hart, Sid Vicious and Mike Sanders.

===First Tour and the Inception PPV===
The WWA held its first tour in October 2001, covering dates across Australia. During this time the Road Dogg defeated Jeff Jarrett to become the first WWA World Champion. However, the title was then vacated to allow for it to be competed for during a title tournament at their first PPV, the Inception. This tournament involved 4 quarterfinals matches (one of which was a battle royal), 2 semi-finals and a final held inside a steel cage.

This debut PPV was held inside a full-sized arena in Sydney and production values were of a decent standard. However, the event was universally panned by the critics for being short at 2 hours overall and various matches being too short to be able to run to their full potential. The use of WCW style comic story lines also did little to endear themselves to the viewing public as a serious alternative to the WWF.

Some such comic storylines involved Australian kids TV performers, The Fruits in suits (who were a parody of The Bananas in Pyjamas), interfering in matches and former WCW joke team Lenny Lane and Lodi being allowed to compete in the semi-final after an injury forced Juventud Guerrera to withdraw. The final of the title tournament saw the Road Dogg face Jeff Jarrett. Commissioner Bret Hart was at ringside for the match and interfered on a number of occasions to prevent anyone winning the match using his sharpshooter move. In the end Jarrett won the match with his trademark guitar shot and became the champion.

===UK and Ireland Tour===
Next the WWA toured the UK and Ireland in December 2001. This tour largely included the same line up as the Inception PPV tour. Additions to the card were former WCW World Heavyweight Champion Scott Steiner and former WWF tag team competitor Brian Christopher. Although the events drew several thousand fans at times the WWA failed to consistently draw large crowds. The main event on this tour was usually Jeff Jarrett versus Road Dogg versus Scott Steiner for the title in a three-way dance. Jarrett successfully defended his title each time.

===Revolution PPV===
On 24 February 2002, the WWA held its second PPV, The Revolution. It was the promotion&#x27;s first and only event to take place in the USA.

This event took place in the Aladdin Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. This was a smaller venue, which reflected upon the look and style of the show.

Months before the event, initial advertisements plugged the reunion of Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. However, this did not happen due to both men signing contracts to return to the WWF. Then Randy Savage was advertised to be appearing in the main event against Jeff Jarrett for the WWA Heavyweight Championship. Savage backed out of the event during the weekend and this wasn&#x27;t announced until the pre-show where a big red &quot;X&quot; and the text &quot;NOT APPEARING&quot; was overlaid on all images of Savage. Road Dogg, also heavily advertised for this show, did not appear either although this was not told to the fans during the pre-show. Andrew McManus opened the show with a prepared statement in his office, confirming that Savage would not be appearing. Bret Hart appeared after the opening match as the WWA Commissioner. He announced to the live crowd that Randy Savage was not at the show and was being replaced in the main event by Brian Christopher.

An amount of significant talent was arguably underutilized on the show. Former WCW World Tag Team Champions KroniK wrestled an unknown Native-American gimmick tag team called Native Blood and defeated them in less than five minutes. Former WCW World Heavyweight Champion Scott Steiner showed up, only to cut a quick promo and beat Disco Inferno in a two-minute match. Eddie Guerrero became the WWA International Cruiserweight Champion by defeating Juventud Guerrera and Psicosis. After the match, former ECW World Heavyweight Champion Jerry Lynn made an appearance to confront Guerrero. This was a genuine surprise, as few knew he had been released from his WWF contract before his appearance on this show. Rick Steiner and Ernest Miller defeated Lenny and Lodi in a match that only lasted 58 seconds. Larry Zbyszko showed up to cut a promo on Vince McMahon challenging him to a fight and talking about Chris Jericho, who was WWF Champion at the time, saying that he stole Zbyszko&#x27;s &quot;Living Legend&quot; moniker. He mocked Jericho by accusing him of &quot;being too short to be a world champion&quot;, despite Zbyszko actually being shorter in height than Jericho himself.

Jarrett defeated Christopher in the main event to retain the title.

===Eruption PPV and Australian Tour===
In April the WWA returned to Australia for a tour and to film its third PPV, The Eruption. During this tour Nathan Jones won the WWA title after winning a 4 corners match against Jeff Jarrett, Scott Steiner and Brian Christopher.

The Eruption PPV was held at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia. The show started with Jeff Jarrett being escorted away from the building proclaiming he would be back (Jarrett never appeared after this). It presumed this was prerecorded earlier in the week. A new Cruiserweight Champion was crowned at the show after Eddie Guerrero had returned to the WWF. A.J. Styles defeated Jerry Lynn in the tournament final to win the title. Another match of note was a cage match between Sabu and Devon Storm. Sabu won the match after leaping from the top of the cage onto Devon Storm, who was laid on top of a double deck of tables. In the main event Scott Steiner defeated Nathan Jones to win the title. He would later give up the title to sign with the WWF.

A further UK and European tour was planned for after this event. The WWA postponed the tour from May 2002 to November 2002, citing injuries to its major stars as the reason. However, it is believed that poor ticket sales may be the true reason.

===Retribution PPV and European Tour===
The WWA toured the UK in December 2002, filming The Retribution PPV in Glasgow Scotland. The WWA title remained vacant for the first half of the tour, with it being held up to be decided at the PPV. Mike Sanders took over as commissioner for this tour and fought Joe E. Legend each night. Memorable matches on this tour included a three-way hardcore match including Sabu, Perry Saturn and Simon Diamond.

Retribution was broadcast in February 2003. The card included nine matches and two title matches (WWA and TNA), but only ran for 1 hour 45 minutes. This was fifteen minutes shorter than the house show in Newcastle the night before, which only included six matches and no title matches.

This tour included an infamous dispute with a seemingly badly out of shape Lex Luger. He reportedly missed shows due to illness and refused to wrestle for more than five minutes in matches, despite being in the main events. He faced Sting for the vacant WWA title at the PPV. This match was poorly received and only lasted about 7 minutes, which largely involved Luger pacing around and avoiding wrestling. Luger won this match and became WWA Champion after an interference from Jeff Jarrett with his guitar. He lost this title to Sting a few days later at a house show in Zurich, Switzerland.

===Final Tour and The Reckoning PPV===
In May 2003, the WWA embarked on its final tour. This visited Australia and New Zealand. The Reckoning PPV was held in Auckland
in front of a vocal crowd. It was the first to include replays and split screen shots. Before the PPV the decision had been made to fold the WWA, hence the titles were to be unified with the NWA and TNA titles. Chris Sabin won a four corners cruiserweight match to unify the TNA X Division and WWA Cruiserweight titles. In the main event, Sting was defeated by NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett to unify the NWA and WWA World titles.

==Championships==
*WWA World Heavyweight Championship – last held by Jeff Jarrett; unified with Jarrett&#x27;s NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship
*WWA International Cruiserweight Championship – last held by Chris Sabin; unified with Sabin&#x27;s TNA X Division Championship
*WWA Hardcore Championship – Devon Storm defeated Danny Dominion in a tables match to win the title on October 25, 2001 in Wollongong, Australia. Title was then abandoned.

<text>Maitreya-nātha (c. 270–350 CE) is a name whose use was pioneered by Buddhist scholars Erich Frauwallner, Giuseppe Tucci, and Hakuju Ui to distinguish one of the three founders of the Yogācāra school of Buddhist philosophy, along with Asanga and Vasubandhu. Some scholars believe this Maitreya to be a historical person in India who authored various Yogācāra texts known as the Maitreya corpus. The traditions themselves have held that it is referring to the bodhisattva Maitreya, the future buddha.

==Academic views==
Scholars are divided in opinion whether the name refers to a historical human teacher of Asaṅga or to the bodhisattva Maitreya. Frauwallner, Tucci and Ui proposed this as a possibility, while Eric Obermiller and Fyodor Shcherbatskoy doubted the historicity of this figure. 

Modern scholars argue that many of the various texts traditionally attributed to Maitreya (and supposedly revealed to Asanga) like the &quot;Abhisamayalankara&quot; and the &quot;Ratnagotravibhaga&quot; are actually later post-Asanga texts. However, some scholars like Gareth Sparham use the name Maitreya to refer to the author of &quot;three Maitreya texts&quot;, all which seem to be by the same author. This Maitreya Corpus comprises the following texts: 

* the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkārakarika&quot; (&quot;Verses on the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras&quot;) and its commentary, 
* the &quot;Dharmadharmatāvibhāga&quot; (&quot;Distinguishing Dharmata from the dharmas&quot;)
* the &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga&quot; (&quot;Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes&quot;)

Paul Williams writes that &quot;it is quite possible that these other three [texts] do have a single author&quot; and cites Frauwallner who also thought these three texts were similar. 

Mario D&#x27;amato who also agrees that these texts likely share one author, dates these three &quot;Maitreya&quot; texts to a phase after the completion of the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi&quot;, but before the composition of Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; (which quotes the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra&quot; as an authoritative text). 

==Traditional view==
The Buddhist traditions themselves have always held that Asaṅga received the &quot;Maitreya&quot; texts from the bodhisattva Maitreya directly. Asaṅga is said to have spent many years in intense meditation, during which time tradition says that he often visited Tuṣita to receive teachings from the Maitreya. Heavens such as Tuṣita are said to be accessible through meditation. Xuanzang tells the account of these events:

Confusion over the idea of &quot;supernaturally&quot; visiting heavens may be due to the unfamiliarity of scholars with the Indian concept of heavens as being accessible through samādhi. Other advanced meditators recorded similar experiences of visiting Tuṣita Heaven at night. One such example of this is Hanshan Deqing during the Ming dynasty. In his autobiography, Hanshan describes the palace of Maitreya in Tuṣita, and hearing a lecture given by Bodhisattva Maitreya to a large group of his disciples.

=== Attributed works ===
The number of works attributed to him vary in the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism. In the Tibetan tradition the &quot;five Dharmas of Maitreya&quot; are:
* the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi śāstra&quot;, the encyclopedic and definitive text of the Yogacara school
* the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkārakārikā&quot;, which presents the Mahāyāna path from the Yogācāra perspective
* the &quot;Dharmadharmatāvibhāga&quot;, a short Yogācāra work discussing the distinction and correlation (&quot;vibhāga&quot;) between phenomena (&quot;dharma&quot;) and reality (&quot;dharmatā&quot;)
* the &quot;Madhyāntavibhāgakārikā&quot;, 112 verses that are a key work in Yogācāra philosophy
* the &quot;Abhisamayalankara&quot;, which summarizes the Prajnaparamita sūtras, which the Mādhyamaka school regards as presenting the ultimate truth
* the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;, also known as the &quot;Uttāratantra śāstra&quot;, a compendium of the Buddha-nature literature
The Chinese tradition meanwhile maintains that the five revealed scriptures are: the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi, *Yogavibhāga&quot; [now lost]&quot;, Mahāyānasūtrālamkārakā, Madhyāntavibhāga&quot; and the &quot;Vajracchedikākāvyākhyā.&quot;

<text>The FM- and TV mast Hosingen is a 300-metre (985&#x27;) high guyed radio mast outside the town of Hosingen, Luxembourg used for FM and TV broadcasting. It has a diameter of 2 metres (6&#x27;) and was built in 1970. The FM- and TV-mast Hosingen is the tallest construction in Luxembourg and property of RTL.

==Construction==
The FM- and TV-mast Hosingen carries antennas at a height of 285 metres (935&#x27;), pointed toward Germany. These antennas are used for transmitting the German-speaking program of RTL on 97,0 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW. The antennas for the transmission of the native radio station on 92,5 MHz with an ERP of 50 kW are mounted at a height of 237 metres (778&#x27;). As transmission device for both frequencies, Telefunken S 3217 transmitters with an output power of 10 kW is used. For each frequency there is also a backup transmitter installed, with an output power of 10 kW, a Telefunken S 3152.

<doc id="1250142" wikidata="Q3304851" url="?curid=1250142" title="Mel Hurtig">
<text>Mel Hurtig (June 24, 1932 – August 3, 2016) was a Canadian publisher, author, political activist, and political candidate. He was president of the Edmonton Art Gallery. He described himself as a Canadian nationalist, while he also wrote several books critical of Canadian government policy.

==Early life and education==
Hurtig was born in Edmonton, Alberta, on 24 June 1932. His parents were Jewish immigrants: his father from Romania and his mother from Russia. An alumnus of the Edmonton Talmud Torah, he grew up in Edmonton and graduated from high school there.

==Businessman, publisher and author==
In 1956 at the age of 24 he opened a book store, Hurtig Books, on Jasper Avenue and 103rd street which later grew into a large retail book operation with three locations. His stores featured staging of plays, poetry readings, encouraged social interaction, and unusually, permitted drinking coffee.

After selling his stores in 1972, he established Hurtig Publishers Ltd. with $30,000 in borrowed money. It became &quot;one of the liveliest book publishing companies in Canada.&quot; In 1980, he started work on &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, spending $12 million on a comprehensive three-volume national encyclopedia first published in 1985. A second edition, which took four years to complete and cost $8.5 million to produce, appeared in four volumes in 1988. Much to the surprise of the publisher, the second edition was unexpectedly sold at up to a 55 per cent discount by national companies, roiling the market.

In September 1990, Hurtig published the five-volume &quot;Junior Encyclopedia of Canada&quot;, the first encyclopedia for young Canadians. He sold the company to McClelland &amp; Stewart in May 1991.

Hurtig was an Officer of the Order of Canada, was granted honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from six Canadian universities, and was the recipient of the Lester B. Pearson Man of the Year Peace Award.

==Politics==
In 1967 Hurtig became interested in politics when the Liberal Party was looking for a new leader in the wake of Prime Minister Pearson&#x27;s impending retirement. He ended up supporting Justice Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s successful bid for Liberal leadership. In 1972 he ran as a Liberal in the federal riding of Edmonton West. He finished second to longtime Progressive Conservative incumbent Marcel Lambert.

In 1973, he left the Liberal Party and joined with other nationalists including Walter Gordon, Jack McClelland, and Claude Ryan to establish the Committee for an Independent Canada (CIC), which lobbied against foreign ownership of Canadian economic assets and cultural imperialism. He served as Chair for the first year of the CIC.

In 1985, Hurtig established the Council of Canadians, another nationalist organization, five years after the demise of the CIC. The primary purpose of this organization was to lobby against a perceived rising tide of support for free trade. He considered his establishment of the Council as the act he was &quot;most proud of.&quot; He would leave in 1992 but the council survives to this day, albeit with a mission of social, environmental, and economic justice rather than nationalism.

In 1992, Hurtig was elected leader of the National Party of Canada and led it in the 1993 federal election. He ran in the riding of Edmonton Northwest, but with 4,507 votes and 12.8 per cent of the popular vote, finished a distant third to Liberal Anne McLellan. It was nonetheless the best showing of the National Party candidates in that election—notably, Hurtig was the only National Party candidate to finish ahead of an incumbent MP, namely Tory Murray Dorin.

===Electoral record===






==Death==
In 2005, Hurtig moved from Edmonton to Vancouver, British Columbia, in order to be closer to his four daughters. On 3 August 2016 he died there at a hospital, from complications from pneumonia. On the day of his death, one daughter, Leslie Hurtig, read him &quot;newspaper headlines about the launch of the inquiry into murdered and missing women&quot;; he responded, &quot;Bravo&quot;, and died that afternoon, surrounded by family. In addition to his daughters, Hurtig was survived by four grandsons.

<doc id="1250143" wikidata="Q998580" url="?curid=1250143" title="Hillcrest, KwaZulu-Natal">
<text>Hillcrest is a town in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa that forms part of the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality and is situated approximately 32 km (20 mi) north-west of Durban and 53 km (33 mi) south-east of Pietermaritzburg.

==History==
Hillcrest was formerly a sleepy village, governed by its own Town Board on the outskirts of Durban that has now become a booming suburb incorporated into the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality. &quot;Hill Crest&quot; (as the town&#x27;s name was variously spelt until 1969) was founded on a rise in the main road from Durban to Pietermaritzburg in 1895 as a farming or &quot;weekend&quot; village, then a good distance from what was the emerging port of Port Natal. The village was laid out as leasehold sites on a portion of the farm Albinia owned by William Gillitt, one of the main pioneer families of the area and after which the nearby suburb of Gillitts is named.

One of the other early families to set up in the area was the Acutts who had already established the well known in Durban estate agents firm of that name. In 1903 the first school in the village was established in a wood and iron cottage in Hospital Road leased to a Mrs McMillian, the principal of the first Highbury School, by Horace Acutt.

When the first Hillcrest Health Committee was established in 1943, the total all-race population was 1135 persons and only the Main Road was hardened. Nkutu Road was hardened with klinker in 1947 and this was followed in 1951 with the hardening of the first portion of Inanda Road. In 1962 blacktopping of selected roads in the central area began, followed by further roads in 1965. By 1971, when Town Board status was obtained, the total population had grown to 2799 persons.

The Hillcrest Waste Water Treatment Plant was established in the 1990s, then serving only the central commercial area of the village with phased extensions planned in time, with other areas continuing on septic tanks.

Prior to 1 December 2023, vehicle registration plates in Hillcrest started with NU - N for Natal, U for Upper Highway which covered the suburbs within the Upper Highway Area such as Kloof, Gillitts, Botha&#x27;s Hill, Assagay, Waterfall and Everton as well as New Germany and Queensburgh just outside the Upper Highway. 

==Hillcrest today ==
Hillcrest lost its independent Town Board status in 1996 and was made subject to administration by the Outer West Local Council - a substructure council of the then Durban Unicity. In 2000, the Outer West Local Council, along with other local councils, was disestablished and were replaced by the single eThekwini Municipality encompassing the entire Durban metropolitan area.

With rural origins, Hillcrest has been swept up in Durban&#x27;s urban sprawl and experienced a building boom in the late 1990s and 2000s with the construction of many shopping centres and gated communities such as Cotswold Downs, Camelot and Plantations. 

==Geography==
Hillcrest is situated in the Upper Highway Area of Durban, approximately 32 kilometres (20 mi) north-west of the city and is bordered by Gillitts and Everton to the east, Waterfall to the north-east and Botha&#x27;s Hill and Assagay to the north-west. It lies at an altitude of approximately 680 m (2231 ft) above sea level in the Valley of a Thousand Hills, just above Durban.

== Retail ==
Old Main Road is the main retail thoroughfare of the central business district, lined by a number of local shops, restaurants and shopping centres such as Hillcrest Corner, which is the largest in Hillcrest, Christians Village, The Colony, Hillgate, Hillcrest Centre, Lillies Quarter and Oxford Village Centre.

The Greater Hillcrest area is expected to welcome two new shopping centres in 2025 with Westown Square (opening in March) in Westown, Shongweni, 4 km to the south-west and Cotswold Square (opening in July) in Cotswold Downs, to the north-east.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Education ===
A public school system is provided in Hillcrest including Hillcrest High School and Hillcrest Primary School, with Winston Park Primary School in nearby Winston Park.

Private schools include Highbury Preparatory School, and Waterfall Schools with Kearsney College and the Roseway Waldorf School in nearby Botha&#x27;s Hill and Alverstone respectively.
=== Healthcare ===
Hillcrest is served by two hospitals, namely the Hillcrest Hospital, a specialised public hospital for chronically ill patients and the Busamed Hillcrest Private Hospital, owned by major South African private health group, Busamed, located just outside Hillcrest.
=== Transport ===
==== Roads ====

Hillcrest lies just off the M13 (King Cetshwayo Highway) heading south-east to Durban (via Gillitts, Kloof, Pinetown and Westville) and the N3 (Mariannhill Toll Route) connecting Durban and Pietermaritzburg. 

However, the main route through the town is the R103 (Old Main Road) which heads north-west to Botha’s Hill and Inchanga, forming part of the old main road between Durban and Pietermaritzburg. Heading north-west, the M33 (Inanda Road) connects to Waterfall. Heading south-west, the M46 (Kassier Road) connects to Assagay and Shongweni.

<doc id="1250147" wikidata="Q7295850" url="?curid=1250147" title="Ratnagotravibhāga">
<text>The Ratnagotravibhāga (Sanskrit, abbreviated as RGV, meaning: &quot;Analysis of the Jeweled Lineage, Investigating the Jewel Disposition&quot;) and its &quot;vyākhyā&quot; commentary (abbreviated RGVV to refer to the RGV verses along with the embedded commentary), is an influential Mahāyāna Buddhist treatise on buddha-nature (a.k.a. tathāgatagarbha). The text is also known as the &quot;Mahāyānottaratantraśāstra (The Ultimate Teaching of the Mahāyāna).&quot; The RGVV was originally composed in Sanskrit, likely between the middle of the third century and no later than 433 CE. The text and its commentary are also preserved in Tibetan and Chinese translations&quot;.&quot;

The &quot;Ratnagotra&quot; focuses on the buddha nature present in all sentient beings, which is eternal, blissful, unconditioned and originally pure. This buddha nature is obscured by defilements, but when they are removed, the buddha nature is termed dharmakaya, the ultimate Buddha body. The buddha nature is what is referred to as the &quot;jewel disposition&quot; or &quot;jeweled lineage&quot; (&quot;ratnagotra&quot;) of the Buddhas. The RGVV often quotes from various tathāgatagarbha sutras and comments on them. The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; is an important and influential text in Tibetan Buddhism and was also important for the Huayan school.

The authorship is of the text is uncertain. Chinese sources state it was written by a certain Indian named Suoluomodi 娑囉末底 (or Jianyi 賢慧, Sanskrit reconstruction: *Sāramati) while Tibetan tradition (as well as later Indian sources) state that it was taught by the bodhisattva Maitreya and transmitted via Asanga&quot;.&quot; Modern scholarship favors the Chinese attribution.

== Titles ==
=== &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; ===
The Sanskrit &quot;gotra&quot; is a figurative term for family or lineage, while &quot;ratna&quot; means jewel or precious stone. In Yogacara Buddhism, gotra has the meaning of certain &quot;dispositions&quot; or &quot;innate potential for spiritual achievement&quot; that sentient beings have and which place them in five &quot;families&quot; corresponding to the three vehicles, undefined and icchantikas (deluded hedonists). The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; focuses on the family lineage and inner disposition (gotra) which allows all beings to become Buddhas, and thus is compared to a precious jewel (ratna). This is the unchanging buddha-nature that is present in all beings.

=== &quot;Uttaratantraśāstra&quot; ===
A secondary title for this work is &quot;Uttaratantraśāstra&quot; (&quot;The Treatise on the Ultimate Teaching&quot;) or &quot;Mahāyānottaratantraśāstra (The Treatise on the Ultimate Teaching of the Mahāyāna),&quot; indicating how it considers itself to be the highest and ultimate teaching of Mahayana Buddhism&quot;.&quot;

This title has also been translated as &quot;Treatise on the Supreme Continuum&quot;. Tantra can mean both &quot;doctrine&quot; or &quot;teaching&quot; as well as &quot;continuum&quot;. The second way of interpreting the title refers to the fact that buddha-nature is an &quot;everlasting continuum of the mind&quot; (as noted by The 14th Dalai Lama) or a &quot;continuous flow&quot; (as Rongtön Sheja Kunrig and Go Lotsawa gloss the title). This pure continuum may be covered over by fleeting stains, but nevertheless remains as a continuity through many lives and into Buddhahood.

== History ==
A Sanskrit RGVV was brought to China by Ratnamati (勒那摩提) in 508 CE where he translated the text to Chinese. This shows the whole text was available in India in the early 6th century. According to Kazuo Kano, no Indian texts quote the RGVV from the 7th to the 10th century, but it is cited in a significant number of Indian texts from the 11th to the 13th century.

=== Structure and textual layers ===
According to Brunnhölzl, &quot;the text known as RGVV consists of three parts: (1) basic verses, (2) commentarial verses, and (3) prose commentary.&quot; Brunnhölzl also notes that most scholars agree that the text is &quot;a compilation of different elements&quot; and they have &quot;made attempts to identify the “original” core verses of the text&quot;. 

In certain textual transmissions, the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāgavyākhyā&quot; (RGVV) commentary has become integrated with the RGV verses through the passage of time, even though there are also distinct standalone editions of the RGV and RGVV. Takasaki provided a valuable textual analysis of the Sanskrit critical edition edited by Johnston with those versions preserved in certain editions of the Chinese and Tibetan canon. Takasaki identified a textual core of the RGV with the most ancient verses of this core being extant in the Chinese. Extensive analysis of the critical Sanskrit text edited by Johnston (1950) with the Tibetan and Chinese versions, identified that the verses actually comprise two separate groups: a core set of 27 ślokas and 405 additional or supplementary verses of explication (Skt. &quot;kārikā&quot;). The work of Takasaki and Johnston has been critiqued by the extensive reviews of such scholars as De Jong and Lambert Schmithausen. Schmithausen disagrees with Takasaki&#x27;s opinion that the earliest core of the RGV consists of 27 verses and instead opines that &quot;the original RGV is constituted by the totality of basic verses. But this original RGV seems to have made use of several (perhaps only partly remodelIed) older materials.&quot; 
===Authorship===
The text is attributed to the Indian Jianyi (賢慧, Sanskrit reconstruction: *Sāramati or *Sthiramati) in the earlier Chinese tradition, a claim first found in the work of the sixth century scholar Zhiyi&quot;.&quot;

The Tibetan tradition considers the verse portion to have been composed by the bodhisattva Maitreya and the prose commentary by Asanga&quot;.&quot; The attribution of both the root verses and commentary to bodhisattva Maitreya is found in some late Indian sources (post 11th century)&quot;.&quot; The discovery of a Sanskrit fragment of the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; in Saka script (dated to the 9th century by Kazuo Kano) which mentions Maitreya bodhisattva as the author of the &#x27;root&#x27; (mūla) verses also shows that Central Asian Buddhists also attributed the work to bodhisattva Maitreya. Meanwhile, the Sanskrit manuscript found in Tibet contains no attribution.

Several scholars have suggested that the Chinese and Tibetan traditions may be reconciled if perhaps Sāramati was also given the epithet of &quot;Maitreya&quot; (or if, vice versa, Sāramati was an epithet of the bodhisattva Maitreya), but Kazuo Kano notes that there is no evidence to support this&quot;.&quot; 

According to Karl Brunnhölzl, modern scholars have varying opinions on the authorship of the RGV: &quot;the main positions include a total denial of a historic person named Maitreya, the author of these texts being someone called Maitreya but not the great bodhisattva Maitreya, and these works being composed by Asanga or other persons&quot; The Japanese scholar Takasaki Jikido is certain that the author of the commentary is Sāramati through his comparison of the RGVV with the Chinese translation of the &quot;Dharmadhātvaviśeṣaśāstra&quot; (&quot;Dasheng fajie wuchabie lun&quot; 大乘法界無差別論) which is also said to have been authored by the same figure. Jonathan Silk also argues that both texts were by the same author.

Peter Harvey also finds the attribution to Maitreya / Asanga less plausible than the Chinese attribution. According to Shenpen Hookam, most modern scholars favor Sāramati (c. 3rd-4th century CE) as the author.

===Versions and transmission===

==== Sanskrit ====
The critical edition of the RGVV in Sanskrit was first published by Johnston, &quot;et al.&quot; (1950). This critical edition of Johnston is founded on two manuscripts discovered by Rev. Rāhula Sāñkṛtyāyana (1893–1963) in Tibet.

Of the complete extant Sanskrit [Johnston, &quot;et al.&quot; (1950)], Tibetan and Chinese manuscript versions, recension or interpolations of the text (according to perspective), Takasaki (1966) considered the Chinese translation of a no longer extant Sanskrit text to be the oldest manuscript in existence, though it may not represent the original Sanskrit perfectly. 

==== Chinese ====
According to Takasaki (1966: p. 7), the Chinese Canon retains one translation of the RGVV, which is titled &quot;Jiūjìng yìchéng bǎoxìng lùn&quot; (究竟一乘寶性論, which can be back-translated into Sanskrit as: &quot;Uttara-ekayāna-ratnagotra-śāstra&quot;). Its Taisho Daizokyo canon location is No. 1611, Vol.31. The work was translated by Ratnamati at Luoyang in 511 CE.

According to Zijie Li, &quot;there are major differences&quot; between the Chinese version of the RGVV and the Sanskrit version. Li writes that &quot;in comparison to the surviving Sanskrit text, the Chinese version of the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; downplays the significance of the expression &quot;gotra&quot; and instead reflects a strong interest in &quot;zhenru&quot; 真如 (Skt. &quot;tathatā&quot;) and &quot;foxing&quot; 佛性 (Buddha-nature) – for instance, &quot;&#x27;zhenru foxing&quot;&#x27; becomes the foundation or reason for transmigration in the world. In this context, reality (Skt. &quot;tathatā&quot;) acts like a conditioned dharma, an idea that deeply influenced later understanding of Buddha-nature in East Asian Buddhism.&quot; 

==== Tibetan ====
Takasaki holds the Tibetan Tanjur to retain two versions of the RGV:
*&quot;Theg-pa-chen-po rgyud-bla ma&#x27;i bstan-bcos&quot; (&quot;Mahāyāna-uttaratantra-śāstra&quot;), Tohoku Catalogue No. 4024;
*&quot;Theg-pa-chen-po rgyud-bla-ma&#x27;i bstan-bcos rnam-par-bsad-pa&quot; (&quot;Mahāyāna-uttaratantra-śāstra-vyākhyā&quot;), Tohoku Catalogue No. 4025.

Both of these versions were translated in Srinagar (Kashmir) by Matiprajña (Sanskrit, 1059–1109, also known as Ngok Loden Sherab) under the guidance of Kashmiri Pandits &#x27;Ratnavajra&#x27; (Wylie: &quot;Rin-chen rdo-rje&quot;) and Sajjana, towards the close of the 11th century CE.

Shenpen Hookham affirms that there are precious few records of the RGV or RGVV in India and that their traditional recorded history commences with their &#x27;rediscovery&#x27; by the 11th century yogin Maitripa (who was also named Maitreyanātha). According to Hookam, there is no evidence that the work was associated with the bodhisattva Maitreya before the time of Maitripa. However, Klaus-Dieter Mathes has shown that Maitripa&#x27;s teachers, Jñanasrimitra (980-1040) and Ratnākaraśānti, must have had access to the RGV, RGVV and/or their extracts, since it is quoted and paraphrased in Jñanasrimitra&#x27;s &quot;Sākārasiddhiśāstra&quot; and &quot;Sākārasamgraha&quot;, as well as in Ratnākaraśānti&#x27;s &quot;Sūtrasamuccayabhāṣya&quot;. 

Tsering Wangchuk has examined the intellectual history of the RGV in Tibet from the 12th century to the early 15th century.

==== English Translations ====
Eugène Obermiller (1901–1935) pioneered the research into the &quot;Ratnagotra&quot; literature through his translation of the Tibetan RGVV under the name of the &quot;Uttara-tantra-shastra&quot; in 1931. Obermiller interpreted the text as an example of monism. The verse portion of the RGV has been translated several times into English, including by E. Obermiller (1931) and Rosemary Fuchs (2000). 

The English translations by Takasaki Jikido (1966, from Sanskrit, with reference to the Chinese) and Karl Brunnhölzl (2015, from Tibetan) are the only English translations of the complete RGVV, which includes the commentary.

== Doctrinal content ==

The text consists of about 430 Sanskrit verses with a prose commentary (&quot;vyākhyā&quot;) that includes substantial quotations from tathāgatagarbha oriented sutras (amounting to up to one third of the RGVV). 

=== The seven vajra topics ===
The RGV structures its doctrinal content through seven main topics, which it calls the seven &quot;vajra points&quot; or &quot;adamantine topics&quot;. 

These seven topics are: 

* Vajra topic one is the Buddha, here described as without beginning, middle and end. Buddha is also described as peace and as the uncompounded (&quot;asamskrta&quot;), and spontaneous (&quot;anabhoga&quot;) &quot;dharmakāya.&quot; The Buddha is further described as self-enlightened and as self-arisen wisdom (jñana) which is &quot;not awakened by a condition other than itself&quot; (&quot;aparapratyayabhisambodhi&quot;). Buddha is further described as wisdom, compassion and power for the benefit of others.
* Vajra topic two is the Dharma, which is described as cessation. This cessation is described as neither existence nor non-existence. It is a non-conceptual reality, as well as the reality of the path which consists of luminous and stainless jñana that removes all defilement. It is also equated with the dharmakaya and compared to the sun which is unspoiled by clouds and removes all darkness.
* Vajra topic three is the Sangha, meaning those beings who realize: the true luminous nature of the mind (&quot;prakrtiprabhasvarata&quot;), not-self, the unreality of the defilements, and &quot;the full extent of what is&quot; (&quot;yavad bhavikataya&quot;) which is seeing their own true nature in all beings (this is also related to compassion). &quot;Sangha&quot; also refers to the supreme qualities that make them a refuge. Bodhisattvas are like the crescent moon moving to the full moon of the Buddha.
* Vajra topic four is the &quot;dhātu&quot;, i.e. &quot;buddhadhātu&quot; (buddha-nature), described as the stained suchness (&quot;tathata&quot;) i.e. the dharmakaya covered over by defilements. This is the &quot;seed of Supramundane Dharma.&quot; This topic also teaches bodhicitta and its object, which is the welfare of all sentient beings. According to Brunnhölzl, &quot;since “others” refers to sentient beings as the objects for whose sake bodhicitta is generated, this teaches suchness with stains.&quot; 
* Vajra topic five is bodhi (awakening), also known as the nirvana-dhātu, i.e. the Buddha&#x27;s dharmakaya fully uncovered by defilement.
* The sixth vajra topic refers to the buddha qualities (&quot;guṇāḥ&quot;) which promote the welfare of all beings and are innumerable as the sands of the Ganges. The RGVV compares the dharmakaya to the ocean which contains a vast amount of jewels and water (wisdom and compassion). The RGVV describes various sets of buddha qualities like the ten powers, four fearlessnesses, the eighteen exclusive properties and the 32 marks of a great person.
* The seventh topic is the Buddha activity (&quot;karma&quot;) which teaches Dharma to all sentient beings. It is an effortless, non-conceptual and spontaneous awakened activity for the good of all. Despite being effortless, it always &quot;acts with perfect appropriateness to the time, place, aspirations, and capacities of beings.&quot; Buddha activity is also said to be without end.
The basic relationship among these topics is explained in RGV I.3:From the Buddha [comes] the dharma and from the dharma, the noble saṃgha.

Within the saṃgha, the [tathāgata] heart leads to the attainment of wisdom.

The attainment of that wisdom is the supreme awakening that is endowed with the attributes such as the powers that promote the welfare of all sentient beings. (RGV I.3)

=== Buddha-nature ===

The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; is notable for its exploration of the doctrine of the &quot;buddhadhātu&quot; (&quot;buddha nature&quot;, &quot;buddha source&quot; or &quot;buddha essence&quot;, Chinese: 佛性, pinyin: fóxìng), also called buddhagarbha, jinagarbha and tathāgatagarbha (Wylie: &#x27;de bzhin gshegs pa&#x27;i snying po; Chinese: 如来藏 rúláizàng). According to the RGV, all sentient beings have this permanent Buddha element within even though it is covered over by defilements (which are fully absent in a buddha). The buddha-nature is the common element shared by sentient beings, bodhisattvas and buddhas and as the RGV states &quot;all corporeal beings are said to contain a Buddha&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;sarve dehino buddhagarbhāḥ&quot;). 

The RGV verses describe buddha nature as follows:Always, by nature, unafflicted; like a clear jewel, the sky, or water; it follows from faith in the dharma, superior insight, concentration and compassion (30); [its] results are the perfected qualities of purity, selfhood, bliss, and permanence, with the functions that are aversion to suffering and the appetite and aspiration for the achievement of peace (35); like the ocean, being an inexhaustible store of treasured qualities, and like a lamp, being naturally conjoined with qualities that are inseparable from it (42). What is taught by those who perceive reality is the distinction between ordinary persons, noble persons and Buddhas in terms of reality (tathatā): hence is it taught that this womb/chamber for a victor exists in sentient beings (sattveṣu jinagarbho ’yaṃ) (45); [depending on whether this reality is] impure, impure yet pure or perfectly pure, it refers to the realm of sentient beings, the bodhisattva or the Tathāgata [respectively] (47). (RGV 1.30, 35, 42, 45, 47).According to the RGV, this essence or basic element (&quot;dhātu&quot;) is always present in all beings and is the true essence of every living being and the source of all virtuous qualities, including Buddhahood. The RGV states:This [dhātu] is of unchanging character, due to its conjunction with inexhaustible qualities; it is the refuge of the world, due to it having no limit ahead of it; it is always non-dual, due to being without discrimination; it is also characterized as indestructible, as its nature is uncreated. (RGV 1.79).The RGV teaches that buddha nature has three main characteristics: (1) dharmakaya, (2) suchness, and (3) disposition, as well as the general characteristic (4) non-conceptuality.

Regarding the main function of buddha nature, the RGV states that it is what causes sentient beings to seek an escape from samsara, and to aspire to nirvana.

The RGV also describes buddha nature as “the intrinsically stainless nature of the mind” (&quot;cittaprakṛtivaimalya&quot;). The RGV thus equates the tathāgatagarbha with the luminous mind, stating: &quot;the luminous nature of the mind Is unchanging, just like space.&quot; It also describes it as the pure Buddha wisdom (&quot;buddhajñāna&quot;) which is said to be all pervasive. This all pervasiveness is compared to space that is the same everywhere, whether it is the space within an ugly vase or a beautiful one.

Furthermore, according to the &quot;Ratnagotra&quot;, there are three reasons why it can be said that all sentient beings have buddha nature: (1) the Buddha&#x27;s dharmakāya permeates all sentient beings; (2) the Buddha&#x27;s thusness (&quot;tathatā&quot;) is omnipresent (&quot;avyatibheda&quot;); (3) the Buddha&#x27;s gotra (lineage/disposition) is in all sentient beings.

=== The dharmakāya, the purified buddha nature ===
The RGV equates buddha nature with dharmakāya, liberation and with the Buddha (the Tathāgata):Hence [the dhātu] is the dharmakāya; it is the Tathāgata; it is the truth of the noble ones; it is the ultimate liberation (paramārthanivṛtti). Hence, it not being separate from its qualities—in the manner of the sun and its rays—there is no liberation apart from buddhahood. (RGV 1.84)Thus, in the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga,&quot; buddha-nature is ultimately the same as the dharmakāya (the ultimate buddha body, the &#x27;body&#x27; of ultimate reality). While the tathāgatagarbha is enclosed in the defilements, the dharmakāya is the same phenomenon free of the defilements. This is compared to how the sun (dharmakāya) is not tainted by clouds (defilements), only obscured by them. The dharmakāya is held to be originally pure (prakṛtipariśuddha), unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), unborn (ajāta), unarisen (anutpanna), eternal (nitya), changeless (dhruva), and permanent (śāśvata). These elevated qualities make also elevate the Buddha to a supreme status that is worthy of extensive devotion.

=== The four perfected qualities ===
An important schema in which the RGVV (as well as buddha nature sutras like the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda&quot;) present the dharmakāya (the buddha nature freed of defilement) is through its four perfected qualities (guṇapāramitā) of eternity (nitya), bliss (sukha), Self (ātman) and purity (śuddha). These qualities are described as results (phala) of the tathāgatagarbha. The four qualities are also explained as being reversals of the four misperceptions (viparyāsā), that is, perceiving samsaric phenomena as being pure, self, blissful and unchanging. The RGVV explains that when applied to samsaric phenomena, these are indeed misperceptions, but when applied to the dharmakaya, they are actually correct perceptions.

The four perfect qualities are said to be revealed through four “causes of purification” (śuddhihetu). These are the ways in which the tathāgatagarbha can be “cleansed” to reveal the dharmakāya, and they are: (1) faith in the dharma (dharmādhimukti), (2) superior insight (adhiprajñā), (3) concentration (samādhi), and (4) compassion (karuṇā).

Furthermore, the RGVV also lists various obstructions to the path, such as hostility to the dharma, false views of the self (ātmadarśana) and indifference to sentient beings. The RGVV makes it clear that the dharmakāya as “supreme self” (paramātman), is not the self of the non-buddhists or a self amid the five aggregates, but rather is something that is realized after understanding the absence of self in all phenomena (dharmanairātmya). The RGVV echoes the Prajñāpāramitā sutras by stating that the right view is to let go of all views and it even states that all affirmative statements about the Buddha’s self ultimately refer to the absence of self. However, as Jones notes, the earlier Chinese version of the RGVV instead states that ātman as &quot;absence of self&quot; means absence of &quot;erroneous notions of selfhood to which non-Buddhists remain attached&quot; and it also states that ātman can refer &quot;to the achievement of a “powerful” or “sovereign” self (&quot;zizaiwo&quot; 自在我).&quot;

=== The four inconceivables ===
According to RGV (RGV 1.24, 1.25) there are four points about buddha nature which are inconceivable:

# The buddha nature is pure and yet it is also associated with afflictions.
# Awakening has never been defiled and yet it also becomes purified (at the moment of realization).
# The Buddha qualities (of buddha nature) are inseparable (from the basic buddha element in all beings). The Buddha wisdom is in all sentient beings, but it does not manifest because of their defilements.
# Buddha activity is spontaneous, effortless, unlimited and non-conceptual.

The RGVV is clear that only high level bodhisattvas and Buddhas can realize the true meaning of these.

=== Why all beings have buddha nature ===
The RGV gives three widely quoted reasons why &quot;all sentient beings always possess the buddha nature&quot;:Because the Perfect Buddha body (buddhakaya) radiates, because the Tathata (Suchness) is inseparable, 

Because the gotra (disposition, lineage) is present, all beings have the essence (garbha) of Buddha.

Because Buddha wisdom (buddhajñana) is present in the mass of beings, because the stainless nature (svabhava) is non-dual, 

Because the Buddha gotra is named after its fruit, it is taught that all beings have the Buddha Essence (garbha).

=== Why buddha nature is taught ===
The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; also seeks to explain the relationship between the emptiness teachings and the buddha nature teaching. According to the RGV, buddha nature is taught because there are &quot;five defects&quot; which can only be remedied by this teaching. 

The five defects are: 

* The depressed mind or faintheartedness, that is, feeling inadequate and unable to aspire to Buddhahood. Buddha nature teachings provide confidence to those who feel like this.
* Contempt for inferior sentient beings - knowing that all beings are of the lineage of the buddhas corrects the arrogance of some bodhisattvas.
* Attachment to what is unreal - this refers to beings who think that their faults and defilements are their true nature.
* Criticism of the real dharma or denial of what is real - this refers to those who overlook the fact that all beings have the buddha wisdom within and thus do not know the truth.
* Excessive self-cherishing and not loving others as one&#x27;s self - when one knows that all beings have the buddha nature one naturally identifies with other beings as if they are oneself.

C.V. Jones also argues that these five defects show that the Buddha-nature teaching is seen as a corrective by the RGV to the view that only teaches emptiness or to certain miscomprehensions about emptiness.

=== Emptiness and buddha nature ===
The RGV also uses the term &quot;empty&quot; to refer to how the buddha nature is empty of defilements, however it also claims that buddha nature is &quot;not&quot; empty of its innate buddha qualities:There is nothing to be removed from it and nothing to be added. The real should be seen as real, and seeing the real, you become liberated. The [buddha] element is empty of adventitious [stains], which have the defining characteristic of being separable; but it is not empty of unsurpassable qualities, which have the defining characteristic of not being separable. (RGV I.157-58)To support this, the commentary quotes the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda&quot; which states that &quot;Buddha nature is empty of the sheath of all defilements, which are separable and recognized as something disconnected. It is not empty of inconceivable buddha qualities, which are inseparable...&quot;

=== The supreme teaching ===
The secondary title for this work, &quot;Uttaratantraśāstra&quot;, highlights the text&#x27;s claim that buddha-nature teachings represent the final, definitive and highest (Sanskrit: &quot;uttara&quot;) teachings (&quot;tantra&quot;) of the Buddha, in contrast to the earlier teachings on emphasizing emptiness, such as those contained in the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā sutras&quot;. 

The &quot;Uttaratantra&quot; claims that its teachings include and yet go beyond the Prajñaparamita doctrine of emptiness. It emphasizes a more positive metaphysical doctrine than the apophatic emptiness teachings. The &quot;Uttaratantra&quot; sees this cataphatic teaching as complementary to the Prajñaparamita emptiness teaching. Since the &quot;Uttaratantra&quot; claims its teachings as supreme, it holds that without this teaching, the emptiness of &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; remains an incomplete teaching that must be completed by the higher and final (&quot;uttara&quot;) teaching of buddha nature.

== Exegesis and influence ==

=== Indian tradition ===
Various commentaries were written on the RGVV, some by Indian Sanskrit authors. The three Indian works on the RGVV which have been preserved are: 

* &quot;Mahāyānottaratantraśāstropadeśa&quot; (&quot;Pith Instructions on Mahāyānottaratantraśāstra&quot;, Tibetan: &quot;theg pa chen po&#x27;i bstan bcos rgyud bla ma&#x27;i man ngag&quot;), a synopsis of the RGVV by Sajjana which &quot;outline a contemplative system based on the seven vajra points.&quot;
* &quot;Mahāyānottaratantraśāstraṭippanī,&quot; a short commentary by Vairocanarakṣita which provides some glosses on RGVV terms
* A full commentary by Ratnavajra
Late Indian Buddhist scholars like Jñānaśrīmitra (fl. 975-1025 C.E.), Ratnākaraśānti (c. 10th-century CE) and Jayānanda (late 11th – early 12th century) also cited and commented on passages of the RGV.

Jñānaśrīmitra interprets the RGV teaching of buddha nature in line with his sākāravada yogacara view which holds that the Buddha-body is represented by images (ākāras) that exist ultimately. According to his interpretation of the three bodies (trikaya) doctrine, the sambhogakaya and its accompanied true image (ākāra) is the ultimate reality that truly exists, and the dharmakaya is a conventional quality of the sambhogakaya. For Jñānaśrīmitra, the buddha nature is the emptiness of this ultimate reality, i.e. the sambhogakaya, and this emptiness is synonymous with dharmakāya and dharmadhātu.

Ratnākaraśānti disagrees with this view, since for him it is the dharmakāya (which lacks any images or forms) that is the ultimate reality, and this gives rise to the saṃbhogakāya as its outflow (niṣyanda). Ratnākaraśānti does accept the existence of a unchangeable pure nature which resides in some sentient beings, as is taught in the RGV. However he also equates buddha-nature with the Yogacara theory of bodhisattvagotra, and thus, for him, only those beings that have the disposition to become a bodhisattva have buddha-nature. This is said to be rare and thus he does not accept that all beings have buddha nature. According to Brunnhölzl, Ratnākaraśānti also equates buddha nature with the perfected nature and argues that it is empty of both the imaginary and the dependent natures. Brunnhölzl sees this as an Indian precedent for the Shentong view.

Maitripa, a student of both Jñānaśrīmitra and Ratnākaraśānti, is closely associated with the RGV by the Tibetan tradition, though he wrote no work on it and only quotes it twice in his corpus.

Meanwhile, the Kashmiri pandit Jayānanda sees buddha-nature as a way of attracting inferior people and as a provisional teaching (as stated in the &quot;Lankavatara sutra&quot;). 

=== Tibetan tradition ===

An early Tibetan commentary is &quot;A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words of the “Uttaratantra”.&quot; This text claims to preserve the teachings of Marpa Lotsawa on the RGV and may have been compiled by a student of Marpa Dopa Chökyi Wangchuk (1042 - 1136, a student of Marpa Lotsawa and Rongzom). The text contains Mahamudra like meditation instructions as well as more scholarly material that draws on Yogacara thought. It also often makes use of Dzogchen terminology like &quot;kadag&quot; (original purity) and &quot;rigpa&quot;.

Another important commentary is Dashi Oser&#x27;s (15th-16th century) &quot;Heart of the luminous sun,&quot; which is based on the Third Karmapa&#x27;s (1284–1339) topical outline of the RGV. Other notable Tibetan exegetes of the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; have been Ngok Loden Sherab, Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, Gö Lotsawa Zhönnu-pel, Gyaltsab Je, Mikyö Dorje (8th Karmapa), Jamgon Kongtrul and Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso. 

Various interpretations and understandings of the RGVV have developed in Tibetan Buddhism, such as the view that buddha-nature is a non-implicative negation (influenced by Madhyamaka), the Shentong (empty of other) view and the Dzogchen view.

==== Buddha nature as a nonimplicative negation ====
Various Tibetan Buddhist scholars (especially those of the Gelug and Sakya schools) follow the RGVV tradition of Ngok Loden Sherab which &quot;identifies the tathagatagarba as the factor of the natural purity of all phenomena, which pervades all knowable objects and is a space-like nonimplicative negation.&quot; This interpretation generally understands buddha-nature to be just a term for emptiness as it is explained in the Madhyamaka treatises of Nagarjuna and Candrakirti. These authors see emptiness and buddha nature as the lack of an independent nature in all phenomena. 

==== Shentong ====
According to the Shentong view, buddha nature refers to &quot;the naturally pure wisdom, luminous by nature, that pervades [everyone] from buddhas to sentient beings.&quot; This non-dual Buddha wisdom is empty of defilements and samsara (what is &quot;other&quot; than wisdom), but it is &quot;not&quot; empty of its own nature. As such, it is an &quot;implicative negation&quot;, that is, a negation which implies that there is something (that is, wisdom) that remains after analyzing what buddha nature is not. Shentong is associated with figures like Dolpopa, Mikyo Dorje, 8th Karmapa and Jamgon Kongtrul.

==== The Nyingma Dzogchen view ====
In the Dzogchen system of the Nyingma school, the three jewels of Sangha, Dharma and Buddha are identified as the three vajras (body, speech and mind). According to Namkhai Norbu, the three vajras along with the Buddha qualities and Buddha activities, constitute the &#x27;continuum&#x27; or Mindstream of either a sentient being (with adventitious obscurations) or a buddha (without adventitious obscurations). In Dzogchen, buddha nature, the &#x27;everlasting&#x27; continuum, is often explained as the unity of &quot;primordial purity&quot; (Wylie: &quot;ka dag&quot;) and &quot;natural perfection&quot; or &quot;spontaneous presence&quot; (&quot;lhun grub&quot;). An important Dzogchen doctrinal view on buddha-nature (also called &quot;sugatagarbha&quot;) is how it explains it in terms of the &#x27;basis&#x27; (gzhi) and its three aspects: &#x27;essence&#x27; (i.e. purity, emptiness), &#x27;nature&#x27; (rang bzhin, i.e. natural perfection) and &#x27;compassionate energy&#x27; (thugs rje).

The Nyingma commentary of Ju Mipham from a Dzogchen view has been rendered into English by Duckworth (2008). Khenchen Namdrol Rinpoche (2008/2009) commenced the Rigpa Shedra teachings on Mipham&#x27;s view of Buddha Nature which has been followed by Khenpo Dawa Paljor (2009) of Rigpa Shedra&#x27;s oral word by word commentary of Ju Mipham&#x27;s exegesis of RGV in Tibetan with English translation.

=== East Asia ===
The Chinese RGVV remains lesser known in East Asian Buddhism. No commentaries on it were written in Chinese and thus scholars have assumed it was less influential than other Buddha nature works. However, the RGVV was an important work for the southern Dilun school of Ratnamati and was also highly esteemed by Fazang (法藏 643-712), a key patriarch of the Huayan school. According to Zijie Li, Fazang&#x27;s theories of zhenru 真如 (Skt. tathatā), Huayan xingqi (華嚴 性起 Arising of nature on Huayan) and zhongxing 種姓 (Skt. gotra) thoroughly relies on the RGVV. 

The RGVV also impacted other East Asian scholars, traditions and texts, including Paramārtha 真諦 (499-569), the &quot;Mahayana Awakening of Faith&quot; (&quot;Dasheng qixin lun&quot; 大乘起信論), the Sanjie school (三階教), Wonhyo 元曉 (617-686) and the Japanese authors Juryō (寿霊) and Chikei (智憬) of Nara Japan (710-784).

<text>Hot Cross Bunny is a 1948 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies theatrical animated short directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on August 21, 1948, and features Bugs Bunny. The title is a play on the nursery rhyme &quot;Hot Cross Buns&quot; as well as a punny allusion to the basic plot premise.

==Plot==
Bugs is &quot;Experimental Rabbit #46&quot; in the Eureka Hospital Experimental Laboratory, Paul Revere Foundation. Bugs lives a pampered life, oblivious to the fact that a scientist plans on switching his brain with that of a chicken.

After giving Bugs an examination, the scientist brings him out to the operating theater, in front of an audience of fellow doctors. Bugs thinks he&#x27;s been brought out to perform. Upon finishing each act, he looks around to see the unimpressed, stern-faced doctors in exactly the same frame position each time. When he learns the scientist&#x27;s intentions, Bugs runs and a chase ensues.

Finally, Bugs is rendered helpless with laughing gas and placed on the table, with metallic mind-switching caps placed on him and the rather uninterested-looking chicken. At the last minute, he switches the electrodes and the scientist ends up clucking like a chicken, while the chicken (with the scientist&#x27;s mind) states in plain English he hopes that the experiment can be reversed.

<doc id="1250164" wikidata="Q159475" url="?curid=1250164" title="Corry Brokken">
<text>Cornelia Maria &quot;Corry&quot; Brokken (3 December 1932 – 31 May 2016) was a Dutch singer, television presenter and jurist. In 1957, she won the second edition of the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Net als toen&quot;, representing the Netherlands. Throughout her career, she scored a number of hits, sang in the popular &quot;Sleeswijk Revue&quot; with Snip en Snap, and had her own television show. She was also the presenter of the Eurovision Song Contest 1976, which was held in The Hague, Netherlands, following the victory of Teach-In the year before. She ended her career as a singer in 1973 to study law, after which she became a lawyer and ultimately a judge.

==Biography==
=== Eurovision Song Contest ===

In 1956, Brokken won the &quot;Nationaal Songfestival 1956&quot; with the song &quot;Voorgoed voorbij&quot;, which gave her the right to represent the Netherlands in the first edition of the Eurovision Song Contest alongside runner-up Jetty Paerl. In 1957, she won the &quot;Nationaal Songfestival&quot; for the second time in a row, and represented the Netherlands again in the Eurovision Song Contest 1957. Her entry &quot;Net als toen&quot;, written by Willy van Hemert and composed by Guus Jansen, received most points from the international juries and gave the Netherlands its first win in the competition. In 1958, Brokken won the &quot;Nationaal Songfestival&quot; once again, this time with the song &quot;Heel de wereld&quot;. In the international final, held in Hilversum, Netherlands, her entry finished in last place with only one point. In the book &quot;The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History&quot;, John Kennedy O&#x27;Connor notes that Corry is the only singer ever to have finished both first and last in the contest.

=== After Eurovision ===

Brokken was one of the most popular female singers in the Netherlands during the 1950s and 1960s, performing in the &quot;Sleeswijk Revue&quot; alongside Snip en Snap and scoring hits, some of which were translated chansons by Charles Aznavour.

In 1976, Brokken served as the presenter of the Eurovision Song Contest, and in 1997, she announced the results of the Dutch vote for that year&#x27;s contest. By that time she was no longer active as a singer. She had ended her musical career in 1973 to study law, after which she became a lawyer. She was later installed as a judge in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. In the 1990s she returned to the entertainment industry, performing on stage and recording a new album. She also wrote a column for the weekly women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Margriet&quot;.

Brokken died on 31 May 2016 at the age of 83.

=== Personal ===
Brokken was married three times and has a daughter, Nancy Sleeswijk.

<doc id="1250169" wikidata="Q16199999" url="?curid=1250169" title="Sir Sackville Crowe, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Sackville Crowe, 1st Baronet (7 December 1595 (baptised) – 27 October 1671) was an English politician.

He was born in Brasted Kent in around 1595. He later married one of the daughters of the Earl of Rutland; he had one son, also named Sackville, born around 1636 and who died in 1706. Early in 1617 he secured a reversionary lease of the former Perrot lordship of Laugharne from Charles, Prince of Wales which grant fell in on the death of the countess of Northumberland in April 1619 and he took up residence there.

He was a Member of Parliament for Hastings in the 1625 Parliament (the &quot;Useless Parliament&quot;) and for Bramber in the 1628-9 Parliament. He was Treasurer of the Navy from 5 April 1627 to 21 January 1630; on 8 July 1627 he was created a baronet. The King nominated Sir Sackville to be ambassador at Constantinople on 19 November 1633 during the personal rule. Royal instructions were delivered on 14 July 1638.

In 1636 he obtained a share of a lease on the Crown&#x27;s ironworks in the Forest of Dean for twenty-one years, which he later tried to sell; this caused some great legal trouble, and had to be brought before Parliament. Nonetheless, it did not prevent Sir Sackville sailing for Constantinople in October 1638.

He later served as the Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire; it is not recorded when he was sent to Constantinople, but in April 1642 the records of the House of Commons already mention objections being made to his &quot;meddling&quot; by the Levant Company. By 1646 they had progressed to formally requesting a letter of withdrawal be sent, citing his &quot;seizing the Estates, and imprisoning the Factors and Servants, of the said Company, at &quot;Constantinople&quot; and &quot;Smyrna&quot;&quot;. Crowe was recalled after nearly a decade by Parliament in January 1647. Perhaps the ambassador had not received news of Royalist defeat because he did not finally depart until 23 November.

He was brought back in April 1648, as a prisoner in the ship &quot;Margaret&quot; and consigned to the Tower of London to await trial. In March 1652 he was bailed on a £2000 bond; by September 1658 the Levant Company had dropped all charges and he petitioned the Lords to annul his restraints.

<text>Mahāyāna-sūtrālamkāra-kārikā (Verses on the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras) is a major work of Buddhist philosophy attributed to Maitreya-nātha which is said to have transmitted it to Asanga (ca. 320 to ca. 390 CE). The &quot;Mahāyāna-sūtrālamkāra&quot;, written in verse, presents the Mahayana path from the Yogacara perspective. It comprises twenty-two chapters with a total of 800 verses and shows considerable similarity in arrangement and content to the &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmiśāstra&quot;, although the interesting first chapter proving the validity and authenticity of Mahāyāna is unique to this work. Associated with it is a prose commentary (&quot;bhāṣya&quot;) by Vasubandhu and several sub-commentaries by Sthiramati and others; the portions by Maitreya-nātha and Vasubandhu both survive in Sanskrit as well as Tibetan, Chinese, and Mongolian translations.

== Overview ==
According to Richard K. Payne, the &quot;Mahāyāna-sūtrālamkāra&quot; is structured as follows:The text is organized into five unequal parts, and it is the progress of topics through these five that constitutes the author’s discursive intent. The first step is to convince readers of the text that the Mahāyāna teachings are valid, that they are buddhadharma (Part One: Chapters 1 and 2). Next, the intent is to convince readers of the superiority of the Mahāyāna, so as to instill enthusiasm for it (Part Two: Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6). The authors explain the meaning of the key concepts as part of the intellectual grounding of the Mahāyāna (Part Three: chapters 7, 8 and 9). Then the result of practice, the goal of perfected full awakening, is described (Part Four: Chapter 10). And finally, the path of practice is described in full (Part Five: Chapters 11 through 21).

<text>The Royal Free Hospital (also known as the Royal Free) is a major teaching hospital in the Hampstead area of the London Borough of Camden. The hospital is part of the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, which also runs services at Barnet Hospital, Chase Farm Hospital, North Middlesex University Hospital and a number of other sites. The trust is a founder member of the UCLPartners academic health science centre.

==History==
===Early history===
What became the Royal Free Hospital was founded in 1828 by the surgeon William Marsden to provide free care to those of little means. It is said that one evening, Marsden found a young girl lying on the steps of St. Andrew Church, Holborn, dying from disease and hunger and sought help for her from one of the nearby hospitals. However, none would take the girl in and she died two days later. After this experience Marsden set up a small dispensary at 16 Greville Street, Holborn, called the London General Institution for the Gratuitous Care of Malignant Diseases. The hospital became the London Free Hospital in 1833, and the Free Hospital in 1835. A royal charter was granted by Queen Victoria in 1837 to what then became the Royal Free Hospital, after it was the only hospital to stay open during the 1826–1837 cholera epidemic and had cared for many victims.

As demand for in-patient facilities increased the hospital moved to the former barracks of the Light Horse Volunteers in Gray&#x27;s Inn Road in 1844. The north wing of the former barracks, which was rebuilt and renamed the Sussex Wing after Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, a benefactor of the hospital, re-opened in 1856 and the south wing, which was rebuilt and renamed the Victoria Wing after Queen Victoria, re-opened in 1879. Meanwhile, the western elevation on Gray&#x27;s Inn Road, which was rebuilt and renamed the Alexandra Building after the Princess of Wales, was re-opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales in July 1895. Some additional land was purchased and used to develop the Helena Building, named after Princess Helena: the building was completed in 1915 and served as the Royal Free Military Hospital for officers during the latter stages of the First World War before becoming the maternity wing after the war. The Eastman Dental Clinic opened in a building adjacent to the main hospital in 1929. The Victoria Wing was badly damaged by a V-1 flying bomb in July 1944 during the Second World War.

===Royal Free disease===

In 1955 an apparent outbreak of an infectious illness, involving fever and subsequent persisting fatigue along with other symptoms, affected 292 members of staff and forced the hospital&#x27;s closure between 25 July and 5 October. There was subsequently some debate as to whether the episode was of an infectious cause, or just an example of mass hysteria. The outbreak was later found to have been a notable case in the UK of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, and resulted in the coining of the disease&#x27;s name.

===Move to Hampstead===

By the late 1960s the site on Gray&#x27;s Inn Road had become too cramped, and a modern 12-storey cruciform tower block was built in Pond Street, Hampstead on the site of the former &quot;Hampstead General Hospital&quot; founded by William Heath Strange. It opened in 1974, and was officially opened by the Queen in 1978 on the Royal Free&#x27;s 150th anniversary.

Meanwhile, the Eastman Dental Hospital took over the whole of the Gray&#x27;s Inn Road site. The Royal Free was the first hospital in the UK to appoint a consultant in HIV medicine, in 1989. Professor Margaret Johnson, a specialist in thoracic medicine, built the Royal Free Centre for HIV Medicine, which is at the forefront of treatment of HIV-AIDS. The out-patients&#x27; centre was opened in 1992 by the actor Sir Ian McKellen and is named after the actor Ian Charleson.

===MMR vaccine controversy===

In February 1998, the Royal Free held a press conference to coincide with the publication in &quot;The Lancet&quot; of a paper by Andrew Wakefield who claimed to have found a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This started a controversy which led to a crisis in public confidence over MMR and a fall in uptake of the vaccine. Wakefield left the medical school in October 2001 and was later struck off the UK medical register by the General Medical Council following an investigation by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper into the MMR issue.

=== Ekweremadu organ trafficking case ===
In February 2022 a Nigerian male was presented to a private renal unit at the Royal Free hospital, in an attempt to persuade doctors to carry out an £80,000 kidney transplant. For a fee, a medical secretary at the hospital acted as an interpreter between the man and the doctors, to try to convince them he was an altruistic donor. Later, Ike Ekweremadu was convicted of organ trafficking, along with his wife Beatrice, and a doctor, Obinna Obeta, with the aim of harvesting the man’s kidney for Ekweremadu&#x27;s daughter, Sonia. The court heard that Chris Agbo, an NHS consultant nephrologist at Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire, was paid by the Ekweremadus to facilitate the proposed transplant. Agbo also helped arrange a previous successful kidney transplant at the Royal Free, involving another man suspected of being trafficked from Nigeria, the jury was told.

=== Education ===
For a long time, the Royal Free was the only London hospital allowing women to study medicine, forming an association with the London School of Medicine for Women, under which women from the school completed their clinical studies at the hospital, from 1877. Under the Deanship of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, one of the school&#x27;s founders, it became part of the University of London and in 1896 became known as the London Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine for Women. 
In 1998 it merged with the University College Hospital&#x27;s medical school to form the Royal Free and University College Medical School, renamed the UCL Medical School in 2008.

== Facilities ==
The Royal Free Hospital has a high-level isolation unit equipped to treat highly infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease. In 2014, the British nurse William Pooley was successfully treated for Ebola virus disease at the unit. In December 2014, Pauline Cafferkey, a British health worker diagnosed with Ebola in Glasgow was transferred to the unit for treatment. The unit has also previously been used to treat a patient with Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever.

Significant advances in the fields of liver medicine (hepatology) and transplantation; renal disease and dialysis; haematology and haemophilia have been made at the Royal Free, and the trust now treats all patients needing dialysis in north and central London. The department of liver medicine is recognised as one of the leading research units of its type in the world: it was founded by Professor Dame Sheila Sherlock.

==Performance==
The hospital was rated &#x27;good&#x27; by the Care Quality Commission in September 2017. In a report of the Care Quality Commission completed in May 2019, Royal Free Hospital&#x27;s overall surgical safety rating was downgraded from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;requires improvement&quot;, due to a &quot;large number&quot; of &quot;never events&quot;—incidents so serious they should never have happened—which were partially related to &quot;poor behaviours&quot; by a few consultants at the Royal Free London NHS Trust and failures of the Trust&#x27;s management.

==Transport==
The Royal Free is near Belsize Park tube station and Hampstead Heath railway station, and on several bus routes. There are limited car parking facilities.

== Notable staff ==
Rachael Annie Cox-Davies, matron from 1905 to 1922 and founding member of the Royal College of Nursing

<text>Lituites is an extinct nautiloid genus from the Middle Ordovician and type for the Lituitidae (a tarphycerid family) that in some more recent taxonomies has been classified with the orthocerids and listed under the order Lituitida. Fossils have been found in New York, Argentina, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, and China. 
&quot;Lituites&quot; produced a shell with a planospirally coiled juvenile portion at the apex, reflective of its tarphycerid ancestry, followed by a long, moderately expanding, generally straight, orthoconic adult section with a subdorsal siphuncle connecting the chambers. The adult body chamber may equal or exceed the length of the chambered part of the orthoconic section. The mature aperture has a pair of pronounced ventrolateral lappets and a similar but shorter pair of dorsolateral lappets.

&quot;Lituites&quot; gives its name to the term &quot;lituiticone&quot; which refers to a shell that is coiled in the early growth stage and later becomes uncoiled.

<text>Datel ( ; previously Datel Electronics) is a UK-based electronics and game console peripherals manufacturer. The company is best known for producing a wide range of hardware and peripherals for home computers in the 1980s, for example replacement keyboards for the ZX Spectrum, the PlusD disk interface (originally designed and sold by Miles Gordon Technology) and the Action Replay series of video game cheating devices.

Datel was founded by Mike Connors, who still runs the company and was featured in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List as one of the UK&#x27;s top thousand richest people.

== History ==
===1980s===
Datel started off selling AM CB radio transceivers in the UK. These AM-band radios were made illegal in the UK and even the importing of them was deemed illegal until 1981. Datel then started to import the CB radios in component form and build them up.

The company started to manufacture products related to home computers that were popular in the 1980s such as the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Such devices included light pens and memory expansion. One of their first commercial successes was joystick interfaces for the ZX Spectrum.

The greatest commercial success of Datel was the Action Replay, first for the Commodore 64 and then the Amiga. The Commodore 64 version was designed by Richard Bond, with six versions ultimately developed in all. The Amiga version was authored by two German students, Olaf Boehm and Joerg Zanger, who had been inspired by the Commodore 64 version.

The Commodore 64 and Amiga Action Replays included the ability to save the entire contents of a home computer&#x27;s memory to floppy disk or compact audio cassette, and then to reload very quickly. This proved extremely popular with people, especially when the Commodore 64 could take 20 minutes to load a game from notoriously unreliable tape. It also did not escape people&#x27;s attention that they could use Action Replays to copy games. The name Action Replay referred to the fact that could instantly restart a game from the position that had saved it.
The OCP Art Studio painting software was also successful, in part due to the bundled mouse, which was a novelty on 8-bit systems.

Another feature the Amiga and Commodore 64 versions had in common was the ability to add POKEs, or cheats. They also had a system for finding pokes called a Pokefinder, or trainer.

===1990s===
The rise of the IBM PC and the x86 standard to personal computer market dominance changed Datel&#x27;s traditional PC clients&#x27; fortunes; Commodore International, maker of Amiga and Commodore 64 computers filed for bankruptcy in 1994, Sinclair was sold to Amstrad in a bid to save its market share, and Miles Gordon Technology, a ZX Spectrum aftermarket
accessory manufacturer sold their PlusD drive to Datel to finance their struggling SAM Coupé project.

By the mid-1990s, desktop computers —until then the exclusive medium of 3D games— were giving way to a new generation of polygon-capable, CD-based home consoles. Datel took the Pokes and Pokefinder features of the earlier Action Replays and created Action Replay for the Sega Mega Drive. This was followed shortly after by the Action Replay Pro, which used a superior system sometimes referred to as RAM stuffing. This, combined with a built-in Trainer, allowed users to easily find their own codes.

The Action Replay was in competition for some time with Codemasters&#x27; Game Genie, which was distributed by Galoob. At first, Codemasters tried to protect the Game Genie as they had filed a patent on cartridge cheat devices. Datel defended this by saying that they had been cheating at games since long before the Game Genie existed. Action Replay improved on the Game Genie&#x27;s functionality by adding an enable/disable switch. The cheat codes, at the time, were published in a more logical hexadecimal format compared with Codemasters&#x27; obfuscated system. This meant that users, along with the trainer, could make their own cheat codes.

Ultimately Codemasters and Galoob dropped the Game Genie entirely leaving Datel as the only cheat device manufacturer in the world.

Datel initially struggled to maintain a presence in the North American market, but in late 1995 they signed a deal with InterAct Accessories. InterAct acquired the rights to production and distribution of Datel&#x27;s new cheat devices for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation in North America, allowing Datel&#x27;s products to reach the major retail chains for the first time.

===2000s===
After numerous unsuccessful attempts at breaking into the sizable US market, Datel found an American partner, InterAct Accessories that was willing to distribute their products under a new name, GameShark. InterAct Accessories made cheat devices for most major consoles from the third through seventh generations. The GameShark&#x27;s success helped InterAct dominate the video game accessory market with 70 percent share, the most successful being the ones for the Game Boy, and the PlayStation 1 and 2.

When InterAct&#x27;s parent company, Recoton was going through financial difficulties, it decided to discontinue the GameShark name and website by the end of September 2002. In January 2003 Mad Catz acquired the GameShark brand for $5 million after Recoton went bankrupt. As a result, Datel started selling Action Replay products directly to the North American market.

In 2003, Datel released the Advance Game Port as an alternative to the Game Boy Player. In 2004, Datel released &quot;&quot;, a compilation of games for the GameCube, to negative reception.

In addition to the Max Media Dock line, Datel also makes hard drive add-ons and wireless adapters for PSP, Nintendo DS and Wii. There is an active homebrew community surrounding the Max Media Dock for Nintendo DS.

In 2008, the company released the Wii Freeloader, which allowed users to circumvent regional lockout on the Wii. However, it was rendered inoperable shortly thereafter on any Wii running firmware 3.3 or later, which targeted unauthorized modifications of the system.

In 2009 the TurboFire was released for the PS3. It has a modified design and offers turbo functions for the buttons. Unlike most aftermarket controllers the TurboFire uses Bluetooth and connects wirelessly to the PS3 without the need for an adapter.

Datel operated the TV station Max TV, on Sky Digital, Channel 675 until its closure in 2010.

===Legal===

In the 1990s, Sony filed a lawsuit in California court against Datel Electronics and Interact Accessories. Datel had allegedly logged on using Interact Accessories&#x27; Sony developer user name and password and accessed official developer software from an IP that resolved to datel.co.uk. The case was settled out of court.

In early 2009, Sony filed a suit against Datel for its Lite Blue Tool. The product was a sequel to the Datel Tool battery, which acted like a Pandora battery which caused a Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP) to enter into Jigkick or Factory programming mode, allowing the execution of the boot code from a removable storage. The Lite Blue Tool compensated for the fact that the new factory mode was encrypted. Datel withdrew this product shortly after action was announced.

On 20 November 2009, Datel filed a legal complaint against Microsoft in the Northern District of California for violations of §§1–2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and §3 of the Clayton Antitrust Act; for unfair competition; and for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. In response, Microsoft has filed patent infringement suits over the styling of their wildfire controllers.

In 2012, Sony took Datel to court, claiming that the Action Replay cheat software sold by Datel infringed its copyright. The claim was dismissed by the European Court of Justice on 17 October 2024, who claims that &quot;Datel’s add-ons don&#x27;t alter source code, but merely changed variables running in the working memory&quot;.

<doc id="1250185" wikidata="Q213692" url="?curid=1250185" title="Walter Laqueur">
<text>Walter Ze&#x27;ev Laqueur (26 May 1921 – 30 September 2018) was a German-born American historian, journalist, political commentator, and Holocaust survivor. He was an influential scholar on the subjects of terrorism and political violence.

==Biography==
Walter Laqueur was born in Breslau, Lower Silesia, Germany (today Wrocław, Poland), into a Jewish family. In November 1938 he left Germany, immigrating to Mandatory Palestine. His parents, who were unable to leave, were murdered in the Holocaust. After less than a year at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he left to work as an agricultural laborer and guard. In 1942 he became a member of kibbutz HaZore&#x27;a. He spoke several languages.

Laqueur was married to Naomi Koch, with whom he had two daughters. His second wife was Christa Susi Genzen. Laqueur died at his home in Washington, D.C., on September 30, 2018.

==Journalism and academic career==
From 1944, when he moved to Jerusalem, until his departure in 1955 he worked as a journalist for the Hashomer Hatzair newspaper, &quot;Mishmar&quot; (later, &quot;Al HaMishmar&quot;), and for &quot;The Palestine Post&quot; (later, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;). In addition, he was the Middle East correspondent for journals in the United States and a commentator on world politics for Israel radio.

After moving to London, Laqueur founded and edited &quot;Soviet Survey,&quot; a journal focusing on Soviet and East European culture. &quot;Survey&quot; was one of the numerous publications of the CIA-funded Congress for Cultural Freedom to counter Soviet Communist cultural propaganda in the West.

Laqueur was Director of the Institute of Contemporary History and the Wiener Library in London from 1965 to 1994. Together with George Mosse, he founded and edited &quot;Journal of Contemporary History&quot;. From 1969 he was a member, and later Chairman (until 2000), of the International Research Council of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington. He was the founding editor of &quot;The Washington Papers&quot;. He was Professor of the History of Ideas at Brandeis University from 1968 to 1972, and at Georgetown University from 1976 to 1988. He was also a visiting professor of history and government at Harvard, the University of Chicago, Tel Aviv University and Johns Hopkins University.

Laqueur wrote extensively about the Middle East, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the German Youth Movement, Zionism, the cultural history of the Weimar Republic, Communism and the Soviet Union, the Holocaust, the Cold War, fascism, post-World War II Europe and the decline of Europe, antisemitism both ancient and new. He pioneered the study of guerrilla warfare and terrorism. After the fall of the Soviet Union, he predicted that Russia would not become a democracy but an authoritarian system based on nationalist populism. His books and articles, which were published in many American and Europeans newspapers and periodicals, have been translated into several languages.

Laqueur&#x27;s book &quot;The Last Days of Europe&quot; is often cited as a segment of &quot;Eurabia literature&quot;, although in &quot;After the Fall&quot; he dismisses the &quot;alarmist&quot; notion of Eurabia as popularized by Oriana Fallaci.

== Political views ==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; described Laqueur as difficult to &quot;pigeonhole politically&quot;. He supported Israel but criticized its expansion of settlements in the West Bank.

<doc id="1250193" wikidata="Q455534" url="?curid=1250193" title="Charles Boycott">
<text>Charles Cunningham Boycott (12 March 1832 – 19 June 1897) was an English land agent whose ostracism by his local community in Ireland gave the English language the term &quot;boycott&quot;. He had served in the British Army 39th Foot, which brought him to Ireland. After retiring from the army, Boycott worked as a land agent for Lord Erne, a landowner in the Lough Mask area of County Mayo.

In 1880, as part of its campaign for the Three Fs (fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale) and specifically in resistance to proposed evictions on the estate, local activists of the Irish National Land League encouraged Boycott&#x27;s employees (including the seasonal workers required to harvest the crops on Lord Erne&#x27;s estate) to withdraw their labour, and began a campaign of isolation against Boycott in the local community. This campaign included shops in nearby Ballinrobe refusing to serve him, and the withdrawal of services. Some were threatened with violence to ensure compliance.

Opposition to the campaign against Boycott became a in the British press after he wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;. Newspapers sent correspondents to the West of Ireland to highlight what they viewed as the victimisation of a servant of a peer of the realm by Irish nationalists. Fifty Orangemen from County Cavan and County Monaghan travelled to Lord Erne&#x27;s estate to harvest the crops, while a regiment of the 19th Royal Hussars and more than 1,000 men of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) were deployed to protect the harvesters. The episode was estimated to have cost the British government and others at least £10,000 to harvest about £500 worth of crops.

Boycott left Ireland on 1 December 1880, and in 1886, became land agent for Hugh Adair&#x27;s Flixton estate in Suffolk. He died at the age of 65 on 19 June 1897 in his home in Flixton, after an illness earlier that year.

==Early life and family==

Charles Cunningham Boycott was born in 1832 to Reverend William Boycatt and his wife Georgiana. He grew up in the village of Burgh St Peter in Norfolk, England; the Boycatt family had lived in Norfolk for almost 150 years. They were of Huguenot origin, and had fled from France in 1685 when Louis XIV revoked civil and religious liberties to French Protestants. Charles Boycott was named Boycatt in his baptismal records. The family changed the spelling of its name from Boycatt to Boycott in 1841.

Boycott was educated at a boarding school in Blackheath, London. He was interested in the military—and in 1848, entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in hopes of serving in the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners. He was discharged from the academy in 1849 after failing a periodic exam, and the following year his family bought him a commission in the 39th Foot regiment for £450.

Boycott&#x27;s regiment transferred to Belfast shortly after his arrival. Six months later, it was sent to Newry before marching to Dublin, where it remained for a year. In 1852, Boycott married Anne Dunne in St Paul&#x27;s Church, Arran Quay, Dublin. He was ill between August 1851 and February 1852 and sold his commission the following year, but decided to remain in Ireland. He leased a farm in County Tipperary, where he acted as a landlord on a small scale.

==Life on Achill Island==
After receiving an inheritance, Boycott was persuaded by his friend, Murray McGregor Blacker, a local magistrate, to move to Achill Island, a large island off the coast of County Mayo. McGregor Blacker agreed to sublet of land belonging to the Irish Church Mission Society on Achill to Boycott, who moved there in 1854. According to Joyce Marlow in the book &quot;Captain Boycott and the Irish&quot;, Boycott&#x27;s life on the island was difficult initially, and in Boycott&#x27;s own words it was only after &quot;a long struggle against adverse circumstances&quot; that he became prosperous. With money from another inheritance and profits from farming, he built a large house near Dooagh.

Boycott was involved in a number of disputes while on Achill. Two years after his arrival, he was unsuccessfully sued for assault by Thomas Clarke, a local man. Clarke said that he had gone to Boycott&#x27;s house because Boycott owed him money. He said that he had asked for repayment of the debt, and that Boycott had refused to pay him and told him to go away, which Clarke refused to do. Clarke alleged that Boycott approached him and said: &quot;If you do not be off, I will make you.&quot; Clarke later withdrew his allegations, and said that Boycott did not actually owe him any money.

Both Boycott and McGregor Blacker were involved in a protracted dispute with Mr Carr, the agent for the Achill Church Mission Estate, from whom McGregor Blacker leased the lands, and Mr O&#x27;Donnell, Carr&#x27;s bailiff. The dispute began when Boycott and Carr supported different sets of candidates in elections for the Board of Guardians to the Church Mission Estate, and Boycott&#x27;s candidates won. Carr was also the local receiver of wrecks, which meant that he was entitled to collect the salvage from all shipwrecks in the area, and guard it until it was sold in a public auction. The local receiver had a right to a percentage of the sale and to keep whatever did not sell. In 1860 Carr wrote a letter to the Official Receiver of Wrecks stating that Boycott and his men had illegally broken up a wreck and moved the salvage to Boycott&#x27;s property. In response to this accusation, Boycott sued Carr for libel and claimed £500 in damages.

==Life in Lough Mask before controversy==
In 1873, Boycott moved to Lough Mask House, owned by Lord Erne, four miles (6 km) from Ballinrobe in County Mayo. The 3rd Earl of Erne was a wealthy Ulster landowner who lived at Crom Castle, a country house near Newtownbutler in the south-east of County Fermanagh. He owned of land in Ireland, of which 31,389 were in County Fermanagh, 4,826 in County Donegal, 1,996 in County Sligo, and 2,184 in County Mayo. Lord Erne also owned properties in Dublin.

Boycott agreed to be Lord Erne&#x27;s agent for he owned in County Mayo. One of Boycott&#x27;s responsibilities was to collect rents from tenant farmers on the land, for which he earned of the total rent due to Lord Erne, which was £500 each year. In his roles as farmer and agent, Boycott employed numerous local people as labourers, grooms, coachmen, and house-servants. Joyce Marlow wrote that Boycott had become set in his mode of thought, and that his twenty years on Achill had &quot;...strengthened his innate belief in the divine right of the masters, and the tendency to behave as he saw fit, without regard to other people&#x27;s point of view or feelings.&quot;

During his time in Lough Mask before the controversy began, Boycott had become unpopular with the tenants. He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which may have contributed to his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was on good terms with his tenants, they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.

==Lough Mask affair==

===Historical background===

In the nineteenth century, agriculture was the biggest industry in Ireland. In 1876, the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey to find who owned the land in Ireland. The survey found that almost all land was the property of just 10,000 people, or 0.2 per cent of the population. The majority were small landlords, but the 750 richest landlords owned half of the country between them. Many of the richest were absentee landlords who lived in Britain or elsewhere in Ireland, and paid agents like Charles Boycott to manage their estates.

Landlords generally divided their estates into smaller farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, and could be evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20 km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, who worked on the land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.

In the 1850s, some tenant farmers formed associations to demand the three Fs: fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale. In the 1870s, the Fenians tried to organise the tenant farmers in County Mayo to resist eviction. They mounted a demonstration against a local landlord in Irishtown and succeeded in getting him to lower his rents.

Michael Davitt was the son of a small tenant farmer in County Mayo who became a journalist and joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). He was arrested and given a 15-year sentence for gun-running. Charles Stewart Parnell, then Member of Parliament for Meath and member of the Home Rule League, arranged to have Davitt released on probation. When Davitt returned to County Mayo, he was impressed by the Fenians&#x27; attempts to organise farmers. He thought that the &quot;land question&quot; was the best way to get the support of the farmers for Irish independence.

In October 1879, after forming the Land League of Mayo, Davitt formed the Irish National Land League. The Land League&#x27;s aims were to reduce rents and to stop evictions, and in the long term, to make tenant farmers owners of the land they farmed. Davitt asked Parnell to become the leader of the league. In 1880, Parnell was also elected leader of the Home Rule Party.

===Parnell&#x27;s speech in Ennis===
On 19 September 1880, Parnell gave a speech in Ennis, County Clare, to a crowd of Land League members. He asked the crowd, &quot;What do you do with a tenant who bids for a farm from which his neighbour has been evicted?&quot; The crowd responded, &quot;kill him&quot;, &quot;shoot him&quot;. Parnell replied:

This speech set out the Land League&#x27;s powerful weapon of social ostracism, which was first used against Charles Boycott.

===Community action===
The Land League was very active in the Lough Mask area, and one of the local leaders, Father John O&#x27;Malley, had been involved in the labourer&#x27;s strike in August 1880. The following month, Lord Erne&#x27;s tenants were due to pay their rents. He had agreed to a 10 per cent reduction owing to a poor harvest, but all except two of his tenants demanded a 25 per cent reduction. Boycott said that he had written to Lord Erne, and that Erne had refused to accede to the tenants&#x27; demands. He then issued demands for the outstanding rents, and obtained eviction notices against eleven tenants.

Three days after Parnell&#x27;s speech in Ennis, a process server and seventeen members of the RIC began the attempt to serve Boycott&#x27;s eviction notices. Legally, they had to be delivered to the head of the household or his spouse within a certain time period. The process server successfully delivered notices to three of the tenants, but a fourth, Mrs Fitzmorris, refused to accept the notice and began waving a red flag to alert other tenants that the notices were being served. The women of the area descended on the process server and the constabulary, and began throwing stones, mud, and manure at them, succeeding in driving them away to seek refuge in Lough Mask House.

The process server tried unsuccessfully to serve the notices the following day. News soon spread to nearby Ballinrobe, from where many people descended on Lough Mask House, where, according to journalist James Redpath, they advised Boycott&#x27;s servants and labourers to leave his employment immediately. Boycott said that many of his servants were forced to leave &quot;under threat of ulterior consequences&quot;. Martin Branigan, a labourer who subsequently sued Boycott for non-payment of wages, claimed he left because he was afraid of the people who came into the field where he was working. Eventually, all Boycott&#x27;s employees left, forcing him to run the estate without help.

Within days, the blacksmith, postman, and laundress were persuaded or volunteered to stop serving Boycott. Boycott&#x27;s young nephew volunteered to act as postman, but he was intercepted en route between Ballinrobe and Lough Mask, and told that he would be in danger if he continued. Soon, shopkeepers in Ballinrobe stopped serving Boycott, and he had to bring food and other provisions by boat from Cong.

===Newspaper coverage===
Before October 1880, Boycott&#x27;s situation was little known outside County Mayo. On 14 October of that year, Boycott wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; about his situation:
After the publication of this letter, Bernard Becker, special correspondent of the &quot;Daily News&quot;, travelled to Ireland to cover Boycott&#x27;s situation. On 24 October, he wrote a dispatch from Westport that contained an interview with Boycott. He reported that Boycott had £500 worth of crops that would rot if help could not be found to harvest them. According to Becker, &quot;Personally he is protected, but no woman in Ballinrobe would dream of washing him a cravat or making him a loaf. All the people have to say is that they are sorry, but that they &#x27;dare not. Boycott had been advised to leave, but he told Becker that &quot;I can hardly desert Lord Erne, and, moreover, my own property is sunk in this place.&quot; Becker&#x27;s report was reprinted in the &quot;Belfast News-Letter&quot; and the Dublin &quot;Daily Express&quot;. On 29 October, the Dublin &quot;Daily Express&quot; published a letter proposing a fund to finance a party of men to go to County Mayo to save Boycott&#x27;s crops. Between them, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Daily News&quot;, and &quot;News Letter&quot; raised £2,000 to fund the relief expedition.

===Saving the crops===
In Belfast in early November 1880, The Boycott Relief Fund was established to arrange an armed expedition to Lough Mask. Plans soon gained momentum, and within days, the fund had received many subscriptions. The committee had arranged with the Midland Great Western Railway for special trains to transport the expedition from Ulster to County Mayo. Many nationalists viewed the expedition as an invasion. The &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; denounced the organisers of the expedition, and asked, &quot;How is it that this Government do not consider it necessary to prosecute the promoters of these warlike expeditions?&quot;

William Edward Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland, made it clear in a communication with the proprietor of the Dublin &quot;Daily Express&quot; that he would not allow an armed expedition of hundreds of men, as the committee was planning, and that 50 unarmed men would be sufficient to harvest the crops. He said that the government would consider it their duty to protect this group. On 10 November 1880, the relief expedition from South Ulster, consisting of one contingent from County Cavan and one from County Monaghan, left for County Mayo. Additional troops had already arrived in County Mayo to protect the expedition.
Boycott himself said that he did not want such a large number of South Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers were needed to save the root crops. He feared that bringing a large number of Ulster Protestants into County Mayo could lead to sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said that there would be no trouble from them if the aim was simply to harvest the crops, more extreme sections of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.

The expedition from South Ulster experienced hostile protests on their route through County Mayo, but there was no violence, and they harvested the crops without incident. Rumours spread amongst the South Ulstermen that an attack was being planned on the farm, but none materialised.

===Aftermath===
On 27 November 1880, Boycott, his family and a local magistrate were escorted from Lough Mask House by members of the 19th Hussars. A carriage had been hired for the family, but no driver could be found for it, and an army ambulance and driver had to be used. The ambulance was escorted to Claremorris railway station, where Boycott and his family boarded a train to Dublin, where Boycott was received with some hostility. The hotel he stayed in received letters saying that it would be &#x27;boycotted&#x27; if Boycott remained. He had intended to stay in Dublin for a week, but Boycott was advised to cut his stay short. He left Dublin for England on the Holyhead mail boat on 1 December.

The cost to the government of harvesting Boycott&#x27;s crops was estimated at £10,000: in Parnell&#x27;s words, &quot;one shilling for every turnip dug from Boycott&#x27;s land&quot;. In a letter requesting compensation to William Ewart Gladstone, then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boycott said that he had lost £6,000 of his investment in the estate.

&#x27;Boycotting&#x27; had strengthened the power of the peasants, and by the end of 1880 there were reports of boycotting from all over Ireland. The events at Lough Mask had also increased the power of the Land League, and the popularity of Parnell as a leader.

On 28 December 1880, Parnell and other Land League leaders were put on trial on charges of conspiracy to prevent the payment of rent. The trial attracted thousands of people onto the streets outside the court. A &quot;Daily Express&quot; reporter wrote that the court reminded him &quot;more of the stalls of the theatre on opera night&quot;. On 24 January 1881, the judge dismissed the jury, it having been hung ten to two in favour of acquittal. Parnell and Davitt received this news as a victory.

After the boycotting, Gladstone discussed the issue of land reform, writing in an 1880 letter, &quot;The subject of the land weighs greatly on my mind and I am working on it to the best of my ability.&quot; In December 1880, the Bessborough Commission, headed by The 6th Earl of Bessborough, recommended major land reforms, including the three Fs.

William Edward Forster argued that a Coercion Act—which would punish those who participated in events like those at Lough Mask, and would include the suspension of habeas corpus—should be introduced before any Land Act. Gladstone eventually accepted this argument. When Forster attempted to introduce the Protection of Person and Property Act 1881, Parnell and other Land League MPs attempted to obstruct its passage with tactics such as filibustering. One such filibuster lasted for 41 hours. Eventually, the Speaker of the house intervened, and a measure was introduced whereby the Speaker could control the house if there was a three to one majority in favour of the business being urgent. This was the first time that a check was placed on a debate in a British parliament. The act was passed on 28 February 1881. There was a negative reaction to the passing of the act in both England and Ireland. In England, the Anti-Coercion Association was established, which was a precursor to the Labour Party.

In April 1881 Gladstone introduced the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881, in which the principle of the dual ownership of the land between landlords and tenants was established, and the three Fs introduced. The act set up the Irish Land Commission, a judicial body that would fix rents for a period of 15 years and guarantee fixity of tenure. According to &quot;The Annual Register&quot;, the act was &quot;probably the most important measure introduced into the House of Commons since the passing of the Reform Bill&quot;.

===The word &quot;boycott&quot;===
According to James Redpath, the verb &quot;to boycott&quot; was coined by Father O&#x27;Malley in a discussion between them on 23 September 1880. The following is Redpath&#x27;s account:
According to Joyce Marlow, the word was first used in print by Redpath in the &quot;Inter-Ocean&quot; on 12 October 1880. The coining of the word, and its first use in print, came before Boycott and his situation was widely known outside County Mayo. In November 1880, an article in the &quot;Birmingham Daily Post&quot; referred to the word as a local term in connection to the boycotting of a Ballinrobe merchant. Still in 1880, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; described how &quot;To &#x27;Boycott&#x27; has already become a verb active, signifying to &#x27;ratten&#x27;, to intimidate, to &#x27;send to Coventry&#x27;, and to &#x27;taboo. In 1888, the word was included in the first volume of &quot;A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles&quot; (later known as &quot;The Oxford English Dictionary&quot;). According to Gary Minda in his book, &quot;Boycott in America: How Imagination and Ideology Shape the Legal Mind&quot;, &quot;Apparently there was no other word in the English language to describe this dispute.&quot; The word also entered the lexicon of languages other than English, such as Dutch, French, German, Italian, Polish and Russian.

==Later life==
After leaving Ireland, Boycott and his family visited the United States. His arrival in New York generated a great deal of media interest; the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; said that, &quot;The arrival of Captain Boycott, who has involuntarily added a new word to the language, is an event of something like international interest.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;For private reasons the visitor made the voyage incognito, being registered simply as &#x27;Charles Cunningham. The purpose of the visit was to see friends in Virginia, including Murray McGregor Blacker, a friend from his time on Achill Island who had settled in the United States. Boycott returned to England after some months.

In 1886, Boycott became a land agent for Hugh Adair&#x27;s Flixton estate in Suffolk, England. He had a passion for horses and racing, and became secretary of the Bungay race committee. Boycott continued to spend holidays in Ireland, and according to Joyce Marlow, he left Ireland without bitterness.

In early 1897, Boycott&#x27;s health became very poor. In an attempt to improve his health, he and his wife went on a cruise to Malta. In Brindisi, he became seriously ill, and had to return to England. His health continued to deteriorate, and on 19 June 1897 he died at his home in Flixton, aged 65. His funeral and burial took place at the church at Burgh St Peter, conducted by his nephew Arthur St John Boycott, who was at Lough Mask during the first boycott. Charles Boycott&#x27;s widow, Annie, was subsequently sued over the funeral expenses and other debts, and had to sell some assets. A number of London newspapers, including &quot;The Times&quot;, published obituaries.

==In popular culture==

Charles Boycott and the events that led to his name entering the English language have been the subject of several works of fiction. The first was &quot;Captain Boycott&quot;, a 1946 romantic novel by Phillip Rooney. This was the basis for the 1947 film &quot;Captain Boycott&quot;—directed by Frank Launder and starred Stewart Granger, Kathleen Ryan, Alastair Sim, and Cecil Parker as Charles Boycott. More recently the story was the subject of the 2012 novel &quot;Boycott&quot;, by Colin C. Murphy.

<text>Captain Boycott is a 1947 British historical drama film directed by Frank Launder and starring Stewart Granger, Kathleen Ryan, Mervyn Johns, Alastair Sim and Cecil Parker. Robert Donat makes a cameo appearance as the Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell. The film explains how the word boycott appeared in the English language. Ironically, the titular character plays a secondary role in the film, as an anti-hero, and the hero of the film is Hugh Davin.

==Plot==
In 1880 in County Mayo, during the period of Irish history known as the Land War, Irish tenant farmers agitated for reinstatement of their former lower rents and increased tenants&#x27; rights, especially from absentee English landlords. They particularly resented evictions. Some resorted to the gun to achieve justice, but others, inspired by the Irish statesman Charles Stewart Parnell (played in a brief cameo role by Robert Donat), shunned violence and adopted a form of passive resistance.

Parnell advocates the theory that potential new tenants should never bid for farms from which the old or current tenant has been evicted: this is the core of the &quot;boycott&quot; concept. The crowd, containing Davin and his friends, who had thought that Parnell was going to speak in favour of eviction, put their rotten eggs away and are instead impressed.

The farmers are led by Hugh Davin (Stewart Granger) who, with the moral support of the local priest, Father McKeogh (Alastair Sim), encourages his fellow tenants to ostracize their land agent, the bombastic Captain Boycott (Cecil Parker). There is a love interest in the form of Ann Killain (Kathleen Ryan), whose father is also shunned for taking up a farm from which another farmer had been evicted. The resultant stand-off attracts international news coverage and will ultimately introduce a new word – to boycott – to the English language.

Actions begin with Boycott&#x27;s servants abandoning his house. One final servant, Bridget, is caught as last to leave. She tells him Davin asked them to leave. Everyone refuses to gather Boycott&#x27;s crops. The situation persists and Boycott asks for the support of the British parliament. The story reaches every newspaper and becomes the subject of music hall jokes. The British press go to the Boycott estate, followed by a squad of troopers to support him.

Things start to get out of hand when the authorities, at the word of Boycott, demolish Davin&#x27;s farm.

Captain Boycott risks his survival, having lost all other income, on his horse racing at the Curragh. The Captain acts as his own jockey on a horse bought from Davin. However, the crowd will not tolerate it, and despite the number of mounted troopers they block the Captain on his horse as he approaches the finishing line and mob him.

Michael Fagan steals Davin&#x27;s revolver and tries to kill Killain, who has been signing the eviction notices. A fight ensues and Fagan falls in a river. It is reported that he has been murdered. Davin tries to stop the mob from lynching Killain because he loves his daughter.

Davin rushes to the Killain cottage and finds the priest giving Killain the last rites having been shot by Fagan. When the mob arrive they are pointed to Boycott and the troops leaving: their cause lost. The priest says if anything like this happens again they will be able to &quot;boycott&quot; him.

==Box office==
According to trade papers, the film was a &quot;notable box office attraction&quot; at British cinemas in 1947.

==Critical reception==
Overall, the reception of the movie was positive. In an original review published in 1947, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Bosley Crowther enthused that &quot;a generous assortment of rich and pungent Irish characters contributes not only to the action but to the spirit, humor and charm of the film ... with the added virtues of beautiful vistas across the Irish countryside Launder have given us a picture which should thrill, amuse—and counsel well.&quot; Screenonline described &quot;Captain Boycott&quot; as &quot;expertly constructed, wittily scripted, impeccably cast and enormously entertaining&quot;. Film 4 reviews, while describing the movie as &quot;by turns enlightening and inspiring&quot; felt that it had missed the point somewhat, and that &quot;its characters are a little too quaint and good to convince ... while the script remains curiously unfocused.&quot;

<text>This table of types of hijab describes terminologically distinguished styles of clothing commonly associated with the word &quot;hijab&quot;.

The Arabic word &quot;hijāb&quot; can be translated as &quot;cover, wrap, curtain, veil, screen, partition&quot;, among other meanings. In the Quran it refers to notions of separation, protection and covering in both literal and metaphorical senses. Subsequently, the word has evolved in meaning and now usually denotes a Muslim woman&#x27;s veil. In English, the term refers predominantly to the head covering for women and its underlying religious precepts. Not all Muslims believe the hijab is mandated in Islam.

<text>The Madhyāntavibhāgakārikā (), or Verses Distinguishing the Middle and the Extremes is a key work in Buddhist philosophy of the Yogacara school attributed in the Tibetan tradition to Maitreya-nātha and in other traditions to Asanga.

==Text==

The &quot;Madhyānta-vibhāga-kārikā&quot; consists of 112 verses (&quot;kārikā&quot;) which delineate the distinctions (&quot;vibhāga&quot;) and relationship between the middle (&quot;madhya&quot;) view and the extremes (&quot;anta&quot;); it contains five chapters: Attributes (&quot;laksana&quot;), Obscurations (&quot;āvarana&quot;), Reality (&quot;tattva&quot;), Cultivation of Antidotes (&quot;pratipakṣa-bhāvanā&quot;) and the Supreme Way (&quot;yānānuttarya&quot;). Along with Chinese, Tibetan and Mongolian translations, the text survives in a single Sanskrit manuscript discovered in Tibet by the Indian Buddhologist and explorer, Rahul Sankrityayan. The Sanskrit version also included a commentary (&quot;bhāsya&quot;) by Vasubandhu. An important sub-commentary (&quot;tīkā&quot;) by Sthiramati also survives in Sanskrit as well as a Tibetan version.

==Editions and translations==
A Sanskrit edition was prepared by Gadjin M. Nagao in 1964. The &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga-kārikā&quot; has been translated into English at least nine times, often with the Indian commentaries, in the following volumes:

<text>Richard Leonard Kuklinski (: April 11, 1935 – March 5, 2006), also known as the Iceman, was an American criminal and a convicted killer. He was engaged in criminal activities for most of his adult life, he ran a burglary ring and distributed pirated pornography. Kuklinski committed at least five murders between 1980 and 1984. Prosecutors described him as killing for profit. He was nicknamed the &quot;Iceman&quot; by authorities after they discovered that he had frozen the body of one of his victims in an attempt to disguise the time of death.

Kuklinski lived with his wife and children in the New Jersey suburb of Dumont. They knew him as a loving father and husband, although one who also had a violent temper. Kuklinski&#x27;s family stated that they were unaware of his crimes. Kuklinski&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; was to lure men to clandestine meetings with the promise of lucrative business deals then kill them and steal their money. He also killed two associates to prevent them from becoming informants. Eventually, Kuklinski came to the attention of law enforcement when an investigation into his burglary gang linked him to several murders since he was the last person to have seen five missing men alive. An 18-month-long undercover operation led to his arrest in December 1986. In 1988, he was convicted of four murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2003, Kuklinski received an additional 30-year sentence after confessing to the 1980 murder of an NYPD detective.

After his murder convictions, Kuklinski gave interviews to writers, prosecutors, criminologists and psychiatrists. He claimed to have murdered anywhere from 100 to 200 men, often in gruesome fashion. None of these additional murders have been corroborated. In 2020, ATF Special Agent Dominick Polifrone said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe he killed 200 people. I don&#x27;t believe he killed a hundred people. I&#x27;ll go as high as 15, maybe.&quot; Kuklinski also claimed to have worked as a hitman for the Mafia. He said he participated in several famous Mafia killings, including the disappearance and presumed murder of Teamsters&#x27; president Jimmy Hoffa. Law enforcement and organized crime experts have expressed skepticism about Kuklinski&#x27;s claimed Mafia ties. He was the subject of three HBO documentaries aired in 1992, 2001 and 2003; several biographies, and a 2012 feature film &quot;The Iceman&quot;.

==Personal life==
Richard Kuklinski was born on April 11, 1935 in his family&#x27;s apartment on 4th Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, to Stanley Kuklinski ( Stanisław Kukliński; 1906–1977), a Polish immigrant from Karwacz, Masovian Voivodeship. His father worked as a brakeman on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. His mother was Anna Cecilia McNally (1911–1972) from Harsimus, a devoutly Catholic first-generation Irish American who worked in a meat-packing plant. He was the second of four children. According to Kuklinski, his father was a violent alcoholic who beat his children regularly and sometimes beat his wife. Stanley abandoned the family while Richard was still a child but came back periodically, usually drunk and his returns were often followed by more beatings for Richard. In 1940, Stanley&#x27;s beatings caused the death of Kuklinski&#x27;s older brother, seven-year-old Florian Kuklinski (1933–1941). Stanley and Anna hid the cause of the child&#x27;s death from the authorities, saying he had fallen down a flight of steps. Kuklinski&#x27;s younger brother, Joseph Michael Kuklinski (1944–2003), was convicted in 1970 of raping 12-year-old Pamela Dial and murdering her by throwing her off the top of a five-story building. When asked about his brother&#x27;s crimes, Kuklinski replied: &quot;We come from the same father.&quot;

Anna reportedly was often abusive too. She would beat Richard with broom handles (sometimes breaking the handle on his body during the assaults) and other household objects. He recalled an incident during his pre-teen years when his mother attempted to kill his father with a kitchen knife. Anna was a zealous Catholic and believed that stern discipline should be accompanied by a strict religious upbringing so Richard was raised in the Roman Catholic Church and served as an altar boy. Kuklinski later rejected Catholicism and regarded his mother as a &quot;cancer&quot; who destroyed everything she touched. Kuklinski and his first wife, Linda, had two sons, Richard Jr. and David. While working for a trucking company, he met Barbara Pedrici, a secretary at the same firm. Richard and Linda divorced, and he married Barbara in September 1961 and had two daughters, Merrick and Christin, and a son, Dwayne.

Kuklinski&#x27;s family and Dumont, New Jersey neighbors were unaware of his criminal activities and instead believed he was a successful businessman. Barbara described him as a &quot;wholesale distributor&quot; and said he employed an accountant. She did suspect that some of his income was from illegal activities due to their lifestyle and the large amounts of cash he often possessed. However, given his volatility, she never expressed these worries to him instead maintaining a &quot;don&#x27;t ask questions&quot; philosophy when it came to his business life or associates. If Richard suddenly left the house in the middle of the night, Barbara would never ask where he was going. The Kuklinskis divorced in 1993 when Richard was in prison. Barbara said the divorce was for &quot;money reasons.&quot; She continued to visit him in prison but only about once a year. On June 6, 1984, Kuklinski filed for personal bankruptcy listing debts of $160,697, and assets of only $300.

=== Personality ===
Barbara Kuklinkski described her husband&#x27;s behavior as alternating between &quot;good Richie&quot; and &quot;bad Richie.&quot; &quot;Good Richie&quot; was a hard-working provider and an affectionate father and loving husband, who enjoyed time with his family. Barbara remembered that when Merrick became seriously ill soon after she was born, Richard stayed up night after night to care for her.

In contrast, &quot;bad Richie&quot; – who would appear at irregular intervals, sometimes one day after another other times not appearing for months – was prone to unpredictable fits of rage, smashing furniture and being violent to his family. During these periods, he was physically abusive to his wife, breaking her nose three times and once tried to run her over with his car. His abuse also caused her to have several miscarriages. He was emotionally abusive towards his children but according to Barbara, never laid a hand on them because she threatened to kill him if he did. Merrick said that he once killed her dog right in front of her to punish her for coming home late.

Barbara said that she had once told Richard she wanted to see other people. He responded by silently jabbing her from behind with a hunting knife so sharp she did not even feel the blade go in. He told her that she belonged to him and that if she tried to leave, he would kill her entire family. When Barbara began screaming at him in anger, he choked her into unconsciousness. Merrick also remembered a number of road rage incidents involving her father.

==Criminal history==
=== Early crimes ===
In the mid-1960s, Kuklinski worked at a Manhattan film lab. At the lab, he accessed master copies of popular films and made bootleg copies of Disney animated movies to sell. Kuklinski also discovered a lucrative market for tapes of pornographic films, making copies and distributing pornography a regular source of income. Through the pornography business, Kuklinski became associated with members of the Gambino crime family, including Roy DeMeo. He was once arrested for passing a bad check, the only crime he was charged with prior to his arrest for murder. He was photographed and fingerprinted but the charges were dropped after he agreed to pay back the money owed. Several of his known murder victims were men he met through trafficking pornography and drugs. He also headed a burglary group with associates Gary Smith, Barbara Deppner, Daniel Deppner, and Percy House.

=== George Malliband ===
On January 30, 1980, Kuklinski killed 42-year-old George Malliband during a meeting to sell him tapes. Malliband was reportedly carrying $27,000 at the time. Malliband&#x27;s body was discovered a week later on February 5, 1980 after Kuklinski had placed it in a 55-gallon drum and left it near the Chemitex chemical plant in Jersey City. He cut the tendons of Malliband&#x27;s leg in order to fit the corpse into the barrel. This was the first murder linked to Kuklinski. Malliband&#x27;s brother told police officers that Malliband was meeting Kuklinski the day he disappeared. After a plea bargain, Kuklinski admitted to shooting Malliband five times, saying, &quot;It was due to business.&quot;

=== Paul Hoffman ===
On April 29, 1982, Kuklinski met Paul Hoffman, a 51-year-old pharmacist who occasionally browsed &quot;the store&quot; in Paterson, New Jersey, a storefront with a back room holding a wide variety of stolen items for sale. Hoffman hoped to make a big profit by purchasing stolen Tagamet, a popular drug to treat peptic ulcers, to re-sell through his pharmacy. He believed Kuklinski could supply the drugs and badgered him to make a deal. Hoffman was last seen on his way to meet Kuklinski with $25,000 to buy prescription drugs from Kuklinski. After a plea bargain, Kuklinski admitted to killing Hoffman. He stated that he lured Hoffman into a rented garage and tried to shoot him, but the gun jammed. Instead, he beat Hoffman to death with a tire iron. He said he then stuffed the body into a 55-gallon drum and left it outside a motel in Little Ferry. One day, Kuklinski noticed that the drum had disappeared but never learned what had happened to it. Hoffman&#x27;s body was never recovered.

=== Gary Smith ===
By the early-1980s, Kuklinski&#x27;s burglary gang was under investigation by law enforcement. In December 1982, Percy House, a member of the gang, was arrested. House agreed to inform on Kuklinski and was placed in protective custody. Warrants were also issued for the arrest of two other gang members, 37-year-old Gary Smith and Daniel Deppner. Kuklinski urged them to lay low and rented them a room at the York Motel in North Bergen, New Jersey. Smith left the motel to visit his daughter. Kuklinski feared that Smith, after he discussed going straight, might become an informant.

According to the testimony of Barbara Deppner, Kuklinski, Daniel Deppner, and House (who was in jail at the time) decided that Smith had to be killed. Kuklinski fed Smith a hamburger laced with cyanide, but when this was slow to work, Daniel Deppner also strangled Smith with a lamp cord. According to forensic pathologist Michael Baden, Smith&#x27;s death would probably have been attributed to something non-homicidal in nature, such as a drug overdose, if Kuklinski had relied solely on the poison. However, the ligature mark around Smith&#x27;s neck, and the fact that the body had been deliberately hidden, proved to investigators that he was murdered.

After Barbara Deppner did not return with a car to move Smith&#x27;s body, Kuklinski and Daniel Deppner placed it in between the mattress and box spring. Over the next four days, a number of patrons rented the room, and although they thought the smell in the room was odd, most of them did not think to look between the mattress and box spring. Finally, on December 27, 1982, after more complaints from guests about the smell, the motel manager investigated and discovered the decomposing corpse.

=== Daniel Deppner ===
After Smith&#x27;s murder, Kuklinski had 34-year-old Daniel Deppner move to an apartment in Bergenfield, New Jersey that belonged to Rich Patterson, then-fiancé of Kuklinski&#x27;s daughter, Merrick. Patterson was away at the time, but Kuklinski possessed keys to the apartment. Between February and May 1983, Deppner was killed by Kuklinski. Investigators deduced he was murdered in Patterson&#x27;s apartment after discovering a bloody carpet. Kuklinski enlisted Patterson&#x27;s help to dispose of Deppner&#x27;s body, telling Patterson the victim was a friend in trouble with law enforcement and someone had broken in and killed him over the weekend. He added it was best to dump the body to avoid trouble with the police, then forget about the incident. Kuklinski made a mistake when he informed an associate that he had killed Deppner.

Deppner&#x27;s corpse was discovered May 14, 1983 after a bicyclist riding Clinton Road in a wooded area of West Milford, New Jersey, spotted the corpse surrounded by vultures. Kuklinski had wrapped the corpse inside green garbage bags before dumping it. Medical examiners listed Deppner&#x27;s cause of death as &quot;undetermined,&quot; although they noted pinkish spots on his skin, a possible sign of cyanide poisoning. Deppner was also strangled. Investigators guessed that Deppner had already been incapacitated, such as by poison, because the partially-eaten corpse had no defensive wounds and healthy adult men are rarely killed by strangulation.

The medical examiner found Deppner&#x27;s stomach full of undigested food, indicating that he had died shortly after or during a meal. The beans that Deppner had eaten were burned so they reasoned the meal was home-cooked, since most restaurants would not get away with serving burned food to customers. Investigating officers discovered the corpse just away from the ranch where Kuklinski&#x27;s family often went horseback riding. Deppner was the third Kuklinski associate to be found dead.

=== Louis Masgay ===
On September 25, 1983, the body of 50-year-old Louis Masgay was discovered near a town park near Clausland Mountain Road in Orangetown, New York, with a bullet hole in the back of his head. Masgay had disappeared over two years earlier, on July 1, 1981, the day he was to meet Kuklinski at a New Jersey diner to purchase a large quantity of blank videocassette recorder tapes, for which Masgay had $95,000 in his van. After another plea bargain, Kuklinski admitted to shooting Masgay. His body had been stored in a freezer, then disposed of in the park fifteen months later.

However, Kuklinski did not thaw the corpse before he dumped it. He also wrapped it in plastic garbage bags, which kept it insulated and partially frozen. The Rockland County medical examiner found ice crystals inside the body on a warm September day. If the body had thawed before discovery, the medical examiner stated he probably would never have noticed Kuklinski&#x27;s trickery. Investigators realized Masgay was wearing the clothes his wife and son said he was wearing the day he disappeared. The discovery that Kuklinski froze Masgay&#x27;s corpse encouraged law enforcement officers to nickname him &quot;Iceman&quot;, a nickname frequently used in headlines.

==Additional victims==
In various interviews, Kuklinski claimed to have murdered around 200 people. He alleged he used multiple ways to kill people, including a crossbow, ice picks, a bomb attached to a remote controlled toy, firearms, grenades, as well as cyanide solution spray he considered to be his favorite. He said he committed his first murder at 14, and murdered homeless people for practice. In 2006, Paul Smith, a member of the task force involved in arresting Kuklinski – and later a supervisor of the organized crime division of the New Jersey Attorney General&#x27;s office – said: &quot;I checked every one of the murders Kuklinski said he committed, and not one was true.&quot; He added, &quot;Authorities throughout the country could not corroborate one case based on the tidbits Kuklinski gave.&quot; In 2020, Dominick Polifrone said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe he killed two-hundred people. I don&#x27;t believe he killed a hundred people. I&#x27;ll go as high as 15, maybe.&quot;

Kuklinski also alleged he was a Mafia contract killer independently working for all the Five Families of New York City, as well as the DeCavalcante family of New Jersey. He claimed he carried out dozens of murders on behalf of Gambino family soldier Roy DeMeo. He said he was one of the murderers of Bonanno family boss Carmine Galante in July 1979, and Gambino family boss Paul Castellano in December 1985. For the Castellano murder, Kuklinski said he was personally recruited by John Gotti ally Sammy Gravano, who instructed him to kill Castellano&#x27;s driver and bodyguard, Thomas Bilotti. He told Philip Carlo he was hired by John Gotti to kidnap, torture, and murder John Favara, the man who accidentally hit and killed Gotti&#x27;s 12-year-old son Frank with his car.

Kuklinski&#x27;s claimed involvement in Mafia hits has been disputed by other authorities. According to Jerry Capeci, &quot;[Philip Carlo] claims the Iceman killed Paul Castellano, Carmine Galante and Jimmy Hoffa, along with Roy DeMeo and about 200 others. C&#x27;mon, do you believe that? I don&#x27;t know anyone who believes that. No one.&quot; Capeci labelled Kuklinski &quot;the Forrest Gump of mob hits&quot;. After he became a government witness in 1990, Sammy Gravano admitted to planning the murder of Castellano and Bilotti, but said the shooters were all members of John Gotti&#x27;s crew and were chosen by Gotti; he did not mention Kuklinski. Anthony Bruno felt Kuklinski&#x27;s participation in the killing of Castellano was &quot;highly unlikely&quot;. Bruno noted that in 1986 Anthony Indelicato was convicted of Galante&#x27;s murder and Kuklinski was not mentioned during the trial. Kuklinski biographer Philip Carlo also acknowledged that Kuklinski&#x27;s claim to have been involved in Galante&#x27;s murder was untrue. Former Colombo family capo Michael Franzese called Kuklinski a &quot;pathological liar&quot; and said, &quot;I spent 25 years in that life, on the street. I never heard his name mentioned once. Not once.&quot;

Kuklinski claimed he dumped bodies in caves in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and fed a victim to rats in the caves. However, in 2013, the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; noted the caves have had a lot of visitors since Kuklinski&#x27;s time, and no human remains have been discovered. Local cave enthusiast Richard Kranzel also queried the idea of flesh-eating rats, saying, &quot;The only rats I encountered in caves are &#x27;cave rats,&#x27; and they are reclusive and shy creatures, and definitely not fierce as Kuklinski claims.&quot; Law enforcement officers also doubt he stored a corpse for two years in a Mister Softee truck.

=== Robert Prongay ===
In interviews and documentaries, Kuklinski says he killed 38-year-old Robert Prongay, a mentor to him. Prongay was murdered on August 10, 1984, shot multiple times in the head, and was subsequently discovered in his Mister Softee ice cream truck in a garage he rented in North Bergen, New Jersey. Robbery was not considered a motive at the time. Prongay had been about to go on trial for blowing up the front door of his ex-wife&#x27;s house. Kuklinski says that Prongay taught him to use cyanide and other methods to kill, and it was Prongay who told him to freeze the body of Masgay. However, Kuklinski says he killed Prongay after he threatened his family. Law enforcement officials have considered Kuklinski a prime suspect in the murder since 1986, but the director of the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice said no charges were sought because Kuklinski had been convicted of other murders. In 1993, in response to his claims, Hudson County Prosecutor said new charges against Kuklinski were possible since the Prongay murder was still an open investigation, and they would assess whether there was enough evidence to prosecute him. Ultimately, no charges were brought against Kuklinski for the Prongay murder.

=== Roy DeMeo ===
Kuklinski claimed he killed 42-year-old Gambino crime family soldier Roy DeMeo in an interview for the 1993 book &quot;The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer&quot; by Anthony Bruno. He described DeMeo as a mentor of his, but after he fell behind on a loan to distribute pornography, he received a beating. The two later became business partners. Kuklinski says DeMeo taught him how murder for hire could be a way to make money. However, author Jerry Capeci, who has written extensively about DeMeo and the Mafia, doubts Kuklinski killed DeMeo or had close ties to the DeMeo crew. Most sources indicate DeMeo was killed by members of his own crew, with no suggestion that Kuklinski was involved. Kuklinski is not mentioned in Capeci and Gene Mustain&#x27;s book about the DeMeo crew, &quot;Murder Machine&quot;, or Albert DeMeo&#x27;s account of his father&#x27;s life in the mob, &quot;For the Sins of My Father&quot;. Philip Carlo, whose biography of Kuklinski includes the claim that he killed DeMeo, acknowledged in the postscript to a later edition that this claim was probably untrue.

=== Peter Calabro ===
In his 2001 HBO interview, Kuklinski confessed to killing 36-year-old NYPD auto crimes detective Peter Calabro, who was ambushed and shot dead by an unknown gunman in Saddle River, New Jersey on March 14, 1980. Calabro was rumored to have mob connections and was investigated for selling confidential information to the Gambino family. His wife Carmella had drowned under mysterious circumstances three years earlier, and members of her family believed Calabro was responsible. At the time, his murder was thought by law enforcement officials to be revenge either carried out or arranged by his deceased wife&#x27;s relatives. Her brothers were regarded as &quot;key suspects,&quot; but the crime remained unsolved.

The Bergen County prosecutor believed Kuklinski&#x27;s confession to be a fabrication, but his successor decided to proceed with the case. In February 2003, Kuklinski was charged with Calabro&#x27;s murder, and received another sentence of thirty years. This was considered a waste because it was during multiple life sentences, and he would not be eligible for parole until he was over 100 years old. Describing the murder, Kuklinski said he parked his van on the side of a narrow road, forcing other drivers to slow to pass. He lay in a snowbank behind his van until Calabro came by at 2 a.m., then stepped out and shot him in the head with a sawed-off shotgun, decapitating Calabro. He stated he was unaware that Calabro was a police officer but said he probably would have murdered him anyway.

Kuklinski claimed he was paid to kill Calabro by Gambino crime family soldier Sammy Gravano, and that Gravano provided the murder weapon. Gravano, serving a twenty-year sentence in Arizona for drugs, was also indicted for the murder. Kuklinski was set to testify against him. Gravano denied any involvement in Calabro&#x27;s death and rejected a plea bargain, under which, he would receive no additional jail time if he confessed to the crime and informed on all his accomplices. The charges against Gravano were dropped after Kuklinski&#x27;s death in 2006.

=== Jimmy Hoffa ===
In his 2001 HBO interview, &quot;Secrets of a Mafia Hitman&quot;, Kuklinski said he knew who killed 62-year-old former Teamsters union president Jimmy Hoffa. Kuklinski did not claim any personal involvement in Hoffa&#x27;s disappearance and presumed murder and did not identify any culprit. However, he later claimed he killed Hoffa. In his account, Kuklinski was part of a four-man kidnap team. They grabbed Hoffa in Detroit. While they were in the car, Kuklinski killed Hoffa by stabbing him with a large hunting knife. He said he drove Hoffa&#x27;s corpse from Detroit to a New Jersey junkyard. It was placed in a drum, set on fire, and then buried in the junkyard. Later, fearing an accomplice might snitch, the drum was dug up, placed in the trunk of a car, compacted into a cube, and sold to Japan as scrap metal along with hundreds of other compacted cars.

Deputy Chief Bob Buccino, who worked on the Kuklinski case, said: &quot;They took a body from Detroit, where they have one of the biggest lakes in the world, and drove it all the way back to New Jersey? Come on.&quot; Buccino added: &quot;We didn&#x27;t believe a lot of things he said.&quot; Former FBI Special Agent Robert Garrity stated that Kuklinski&#x27;s admission to killing Hoffa was &quot;a hoax,&quot; and that Kuklinski was never a suspect in Hoffa&#x27;s disappearance, adding: &quot;I never heard of him.&quot; Anthony Bruno said he investigated Kuklinski&#x27;s alleged involvement in Hoffa&#x27;s disappearance but felt &quot;[his] story didn&#x27;t check out.&quot; He opined Kuklinski made the confession to &quot;add extra value to his brand&quot;, and omitted the story from his biography of Kuklinski.

== Investigation and arrest ==
Kuklinski came to the attention of Pat Kane, an officer with the New Jersey State Police, when an informant helped Kane connect him to a gang carrying out burglaries in northern New Jersey. Kane built a file on Kuklinski. Eventually, five unsolved homicides—Hoffman, Smith, Deppner, Masgay, and Malliband—were linked to Kuklinski because he was the last person to see each of them alive. A joint task force of law enforcement officials titled &quot;Operation Iceman&quot; was created between the New Jersey Attorney General&#x27;s office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) dedicated to arresting and convicting Kuklinski. The ATF was involved due to Kuklinski&#x27;s firearm sales.

ATF Special Agent Dominick Polifrone went undercover for eighteen months to apprehend Kuklinski. Starting in 1985, Kane and Polifrone worked with Phil Solimene, a close long-time friend of Kuklinski, to get Polifrone close to Kuklinski. Posing as a Mafia-connected criminal named Dominic Provenzano, Polifrone purchased a handgun-muffler combination from Kuklinski. In recordings, Kuklinski discussed a corpse he kept in a freezer for two and a half years. He told Polifrone he preferred poison, saying, &quot;Why be messy? You do it nice and calm.&quot; He asked Polifrone if he could supply him with pure cyanide. Polifrone told Kuklinski he wanted to hire him to murder a wealthy Jewish cocaine dealer, and recorded Kuklinski speaking in detail about how he would do it. Kuklinski was also recorded boasting he killed a man by putting cyanide on his hamburger, and of his plans to kill &quot;a couple of rats&quot; (Barbara Deppner and Percy House).

On December 17, 1986, Kuklinski met Polifrone to get cyanide for a planned murder, which was to be an attempt on an undercover police officer. After the recorded conversation with Polifrone, Kuklinski went for a walk. He tested Polifrone&#x27;s purported cyanide on a stray dog, using a hamburger as bait, and saw it was not poison. Suspicious, Kuklinski decided not to go through with the planned murder and went home instead. He was arrested at a roadblock two hours later. Kuklinski&#x27;s wife was charged for interfering with her husband&#x27;s arrest. Officers discovered a firearm in the vehicle, and she was charged with possession of a firearm because she was a passenger.

== Trial and incarceration ==
Prosecutors charged Kuklinski with five murder counts and six weapons violations, as well as attempted murder, robbery, and attempted robbery. Law enforcement officials said Kuklinski had large sums of money in Swiss bank accounts and a reservation on a flight to that country. Kuklinski was held on a $2million bail bond, and required to surrender his passport. After the arrest, Kuklinski told reporters, &quot;This is unwarranted, unnecessary. These guys watch too many movies.&quot; At a press conference, New Jersey state Attorney General W. Cary Edwards characterized the motive for the murders as &quot;profit&quot; and said, ″He set individuals up for business deals, they disappeared, and the money ended up in his hands.″

At trial, Kuklinski&#x27;s former associates, including Percy House and Barbara Deppner, gave evidence against him, as did ATF Special Agent Polifrone. The case was prosecuted by Deputy Attorney General Robert Carrol, and Kuklinski was represented by a public defender. Kuklinski&#x27;s lawyer argued Kuklinski had no history of violence, and only projected a &quot;tough image,&quot; including his statements to ATF Special Agent Polifrone. The defence theorized Deppner was responsible for the murder of Smith, and there was no cause of death determined for Deppner. Additionally, he argued the testimony of House and Barbara Deppner was unreliable because they lied to law enforcement officials, and House received immunity from prosecution. In March 1988, jurors found Kuklinski guilty of murdering Smith and Deppner, but found the deaths were not proven to be by Kuklinski&#x27;s conduct, so that he would not face the death penalty. He was sentenced to a minimum 60 years in prison.

After the trial, Kuklinski pleaded guilty to killing Masgay and Malliband, and was sentenced to an additional two life sentences to be served consecutively. State prosecutors explained he would spend the rest of his life in prison even if he successfully appealed his previous convictions. Kuklinski also confessed to killing Hoffman, but prosecutors decided not to go to trial, as they had a weak case and additional life sentences would not have made any difference to Kuklinski&#x27;s prison term. As part of the plea bargains, the firearm charge against his wife and an unrelated marijuana possession charge against his son were dismissed. Kuklinski was ineligible for parole until 2046, when he would have been 111 years old. He was incarcerated at Trenton State Prison.

During his incarceration, Kuklinski granted interviews to prosecutors, psychiatrists, criminologists, and writers. Several television producers also spoke to Kuklinski about his criminal career, upbringing, and personal life. These talks culminated in three televised documentaries known as &quot;The Iceman Tapes&quot;, broadcast on HBO in 1992, 2001, and 2003. According to his daughter, Merrick Kuklinski, her mother convinced Richard to do the interviews and she was paid &quot;handsomely&quot; for them. In the last installment, &quot;The Iceman and the Psychiatrist&quot;, Kuklinski was interviewed by forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz in 2002. Dietz stated he believed Kuklinski suffered from antisocial personality disorder plus paranoid personality disorder. Writers Anthony Bruno and Philip Carlo wrote biographies of Kuklinski. Kuklinski&#x27;s wife, Barbara, received a share of the profits from the Bruno book.

==Death==
In October 2005, after nearly eighteen years in prison, Kuklinski was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease. He was transferred to a secure wing at St. Francis Medical Center in Trenton, New Jersey. Although he had asked doctors to make sure they revived him if he developed cardiopulmonary arrest, his former wife Barbara had signed a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; order. A week before his death, the hospital called Barbara to ask if she wished to rescind the instruction but she declined. Kuklinski died at age 70 on March 5, 2006. At the request of Kuklinski&#x27;s family, forensic pathologist Michael Baden reviewed his autopsy report. Baden confirmed that Kuklinski died of cardiac arrest and had been suffering with heart disease and phlebitis.

<text>An intermetallic (also called intermetallic compound, intermetallic alloy, ordered intermetallic alloy, long-range-ordered alloy) is a type of metallic alloy that forms an ordered solid-state compound between two or more metallic elements. Intermetallics are generally hard and brittle, with good high-temperature mechanical properties. They can be classified as stoichiometric or nonstoichiometic. 

The term &quot;intermetallic compounds&quot; applied to solid phases has long been in use. However, Hume-Rothery argued that it misleads, suggesting a fixed stoichiometry and a clear decomposition into species.

==Definitions==
===Research definition===
In 1967 Schulze defined intermetallic compounds as &quot;solid phases containing two or more metallic elements, with optionally one or more non-metallic elements, whose crystal structure differs from that of the other constituents&quot;. This definition includes:

* Electron (or Hume-Rothery) compounds
* Size packing phases. e.g. Laves phases, Frank–Kasper phases and Nowotny phases
* Zintl phases

The definition of metal includes:

* Post-transition metals, i.e. aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, tin, lead, and bismuth.
* Metalloids, e.g. silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium.

Homogeneous and heterogeneous solid solutions of metals, and interstitial compounds such as carbides and nitrides are excluded under this definition. However, interstitial intermetallic compounds are included, as are alloys of intermetallic compounds with a metal.

===Common use===
In common use, the research definition, including post-transition metals and metalloids, is extended to include compounds such as cementite, Fe3C. These compounds, sometimes termed interstitial compounds, can be stoichiometric, and share properties with the above intermetallic compounds.

===Complexes===
The term intermetallic is used to describe compounds involving two or more metals such as the cyclopentadienyl complex Cp6Ni2Zn4.

===B2===
A B2 intermetallic compound has equal numbers of atoms of two metals such as aluminum and iron, arranged as two interpenetrating simple cubic lattices of the component metals.

==Properties ==
Intermetallic compounds are generally brittle at room temperature and have high melting points. Cleavage or intergranular fracture modes are typical of intermetallics due to limited independent slip systems required for plastic deformation. However, some intermetallics have ductile fracture modes such as Nb–15Al–40Ti. Others can exhibit improved ductility by alloying with other elements to increase grain boundary cohesion. Alloying of other materials such as boron to improve grain boundary cohesion can improve ductility. They may offer a compromise between ceramic and metallic properties when hardness and/or resistance to high temperatures is important enough to sacrifice some toughness and ease of processing. They can display desirable magnetic and chemical properties, due to their strong internal order and mixed (metallic and covalent/ionic) bonding, respectively. Intermetallics have given rise to various novel materials developments. 
== Applications ==
Examples include alnico and the hydrogen storage materials in nickel metal hydride batteries. Ni3Al, which is the hardening phase in the familiar nickel-base super alloys, and the various titanium aluminides have attracted interest for turbine blade applications, while the latter is also used in small quantities for grain refinement of titanium alloys. Silicides, intermetallics involving silicon, serve as barrier and contact layers in microelectronics. Others include:
* Magnetic materials e.g. alnico, sendust, Permendur, FeCo, Terfenol-D
* Superconductors e.g. A15 phases, niobium-tin
* Hydrogen storage e.g. AB5 compounds (nickel metal hydride batteries)
* Shape memory alloys e.g. Cu-Al-Ni (alloys of Cu3Al and nickel), Nitinol (NiTi)
* Coating materials e.g. NiAl
* High-temperature structural materials e.g. nickel aluminide, Ni3Al
* Dental amalgams, which are alloys of intermetallics Ag3Sn and Cu3Sn
* Gate contact/ barrier layer for microelectronics e.g. TiSi2
* Laves phases (AB2), e.g., MgCu2, MgZn2 and MgNi2.

The unintended formation of intermetallics can cause problems. For example, intermetallics of gold and aluminium can be a significant cause of wire bond failures in semiconductor devices and other microelectronics devices. The management of intermetallics is a major issue in the reliability of solder joints between electronic components.

==Intermetallic particles==

Intermetallic particles often form during solidification of metallic alloys, and can be used as a dispersion strengthening mechanism.

==History==
Examples of intermetallics through history include:

* Roman yellow brass, CuZn
* Chinese high tin bronze, Cu31Sn8
* Type metal, SbSn
* Chinese white copper, CuNi 

German type metal is described as breaking like glass, without bending, softer than copper, but more fusible than lead. The chemical formula does not agree with the one above; however, the properties match with an intermetallic compound or an alloy of one.

<doc id="1250208" wikidata="Q777632" url="?curid=1250208" title="Jungle 2 Jungle">
<text>Jungle 2 Jungle is a 1997 comedy film directed by John Pasquin, produced by Walt Disney Pictures and TF1 Films Production, and starring Tim Allen, Martin Short, Lolita Davidovich, David Ogden Stiers, JoBeth Williams, and introducing Sam Huntington in his film debut. A co-production between France and the United States, it is an English-language remake of the 1994 French film &quot;Un indien dans la ville&quot; (also known as &quot;Little Indian, Big City&quot;). Its plot follows that of the original film fairly closely, with the biggest difference being the change in location from Paris to New York City. Like its original French film, it was a moderate box office success but was panned by critics.

==Plot==
Michael Cromwell is a self-absorbed commodities broker living in New York City. Wanting to marry his new fiancée, Charlotte, he needs to obtain a divorce from his first wife, Patricia, who left him some years earlier. She now lives with a semi-Westernized tribe in Canaima National Park, Venezuela. He travels there to get her signature on the divorce papers. Upon arriving, she reveals that they have a son together named Mimi-Siku, who is now 13 years old.

Michael attempts to bond with Mimi in his brief stay with the tribe and promises to take him to New York City &quot;when he is a man&quot;. He is also given a new name of &quot;Baboon&quot; as is a custom in the tribe. That night, Mimi undergoes the traditional rite of passage of the tribe, who then considers him to be a man. The tribal elder gives him a special task to bring fire from the Statue of Liberty in order to become the next chief. A reluctant Michael, realizing his promise would have to be honored sooner than he realized, brings Mimi to New York City with him.

Charlotte is less than pleased about Mimi and his primitive ways. As Michael attempts to adapt him to city life, cross-cultural misunderstandings occur when he reverts to customs considered acceptable by his tribe. On climbing the Statue of Liberty to reach the torch, he is disappointed when he sees that the flame is not real. After a brief argument with Michael, Mimi&#x27;s antics have caused Charlotte to reach her breaking point.

While staying at the home of Michael&#x27;s business partner Richard Kempster, Mimi falls in love with his daughter, Karen. He paints her face and gives her a new name, Ukume, as is the custom in his tribe. Richard resents Mimi&#x27;s presence in his home due to his influence over Karen and because he cooked and ate his valuable prize-winning &quot;Poecilia latipinna&quot; fish. Richard freaks out when he sees Karen and Mimi together in a hammock and threatens to send her to an all-girls summer camp.

The Kempsters and Michael are targeted by Alexei Jovanovic, a Russian mobster and caviar dealer who believes that they have cheated him in a business deal. He arrives at the Kempsters&#x27; home and tortures Richard for information and is prepared to cut off his fingers. By fighting together, utilizing Mimi&#x27;s hunting skills, and Mimi&#x27;s pet tarantula Maitika, Michael and Mimi fight off Jovanovic and his minions.

Before returning to the Amazon jungle, Mimi is given a satellite phone by Michael so they can stay in touch. He also presents him with a Statue of Liberty cigarette lighter, which produces fire from the torch and will fulfill his quest. In return, he gives Michael a blowpipe and poisoned darts, telling him to practice and come to see him when he can hit flies.

Shortly afterward, Michael finds himself disheartened by his relationship with Charlotte and realizes it is not working for him anymore. He attempts to kill a fly with his blowpipe on the trading floor of the New York Board of Trade. He hits it, but also his hot-tempered boss Langston who collapses asleep on the trading floor.

Michael returns to Lipo-Lipo to see Mimi and Patricia, bringing the Kempsters with him for a vacation. Karen and Mimi are reunited and it is suggested that Michael and Patricia also resume their relationship.

As the closing credits start rolling, Michael undergoes the rite of passage as Mimi did earlier.

==Reception==

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot; a rating of 19%, based on reviews from 42 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Tim Allen spends &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot; annoyed and put upon, mirroring audiences&#x27; reaction as they struggle through this witless family comedy.&quot;

Roger Ebert was disappointed by the film, giving it one star out of four, a small step from his original zero star rating for &quot;Little Indian, Big City&quot;. On his television program &quot;Siskel and Ebert&quot;, Ebert said &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot; was not as bad as &quot;Little Indian, Big City&quot; because it was &quot;far too mediocre to be terrible.&quot; He also described it as &quot;lamebrained, boring, predictable, long, and slow&quot;, and added that while the French version was memorably bad, &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot; was &quot;just forgettable&quot;. Ebert&#x27;s colleague Gene Siskel mildly disagreed, specifying that he felt &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot; was just as bad as &quot;Little Indian, Big City&quot;. He also said he felt embarrassed for Allen and Short, as he felt they were used far better in other television programs and films. Siskel later went on to declare &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot; the worst film of 1997.

At the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was listed as one of 30 dishonorable mentions for Worst Picture and was noted under the Founders Award, which lamented the year&#x27;s biggest studio disgraces. Referencing Siskel&#x27;s pick for worst film of the year (they called it &quot;a horrendous embarrassment for Disney&quot;), the Stinkers stated that it had &quot;just as many laughs as &quot;Little Indian, Big City&quot; (zero) and we&#x27;re being generous&quot; and added that Disney needed to stop remaking so many films.

<text>Juma Abdalla Oris (died in March 2001) was a Ugandan military officer and government minister during the dictatorship of Idi Amin. After fleeing his country during the Uganda–Tanzania War, he became leader of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), a rebel group active in the West Nile region of Uganda during the 1990s.

== Biography ==
Juma Abdalla Oris was born in northern Uganda, or Nimule in southern Sudan. He was a Muslim and, ethnically, a Madi and/or Nubian. Oris received only minimal education, and eventually joined the Uganda Army, becoming a high-ranking colonel by the early 1970s.

Following the 1971 Ugandan coup d&#x27;état, he rose to be one of the leading figures in Idi Amin&#x27;s government. He first became acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, and was appointed full foreign minister on 25 May 1975. He stayed in this position until 1978, while also serving as Minister of Information and Broadcasting. Following his takeover of the Information Ministry, a series of new directives and restrictions were handed down to the Ugandan news industry. All newspapers had to print Amin&#x27;s statements in full, and Radio Uganda and Uganda Television had to transmit them in full. In addition to this, the latter two had to open and close every broadcast with a daily national prayer. Oris also sharply criticised Uganda&#x27;s two private newspapers, &quot;Munno&quot; and &quot;Taifa&quot;, for supposedly conveying false information about Amin because they were not printing the same stories as the government daily, the &quot;Voice of Uganda&quot;. He was regarded as follower of Vice President Mustafa Adrisi. Oris was dismissed from his position as foreign minister as well as from all of his ministerial portfolios by Amin in 1978, probably as part of a political purge following Adrisi&#x27;s removal from power. Officially, Amin claimed that Oris had been fired because Uganda&#x27;s image abroad had been mismanaged and Ugandan diplomats had not been paid regularly under his tenure.

Shortly thereafter in late 1978, Ugandan troops invaded neighboring Tanzania under unclear circumstances, causing the Uganda–Tanzania War. Tanzania responded with a counter-invasion, and Amin&#x27;s government began to collapse. Oris was one of the few Ugandan officers who remained loyal throughout most of the conflict. By 1979, he had been appointed Minister for Animal Resources and Minister of Lands. On 4 April 1979, Amin organized a four‐member war planning committee which consisted of his most trusted followers, including Oris. By this point, the Uganda Army had mostly disintegrated. After the Fall of Kampala, Oris fled with 3,000 cattle into exile to Sudan. He had good connections to the Sudanese security services by this point, and even joined the Sudanese Armed Forces as a mercenary at one point. He recruited West Nile people for a Sudanese contingent that fought in the Iran–Iraq War on behalf of Iraq. Using these connections, Oris helped to organize a coalition of ex-Uganda Army groups in the refugee camps of Sudan. These rebels launched an insurgency in 1980, starting the Ugandan Bush War. Oris became a member of the Former Uganda National Army (FUNA) as well as the Uganda National Rescue Front (UNRF), both of which fought in the Bush War. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Joseph Kony, the leader of the rebel group known as the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army claimed to be possessed by the spirit of Juma Oris. It appears he was unaware that Oris was at the time still alive—something which he discovered when the two men eventually met in person. 

Oris founded his own rebel army, called the &quot;West Nile Bank Front&quot; (WNBF), in 1994. Though founded in Zaire with the blessing of Mobutu Sese Seko, the group was mostly supported by the government of Sudan, as Mobutu&#x27;s regime was already in terminal decline by this point. The WNBF fought for the secession of the West Nile sub-region or the restoration of Idi Amin as President of Uganda. Oris managed to gain support in northern Uganda by exploiting ethnic tensions and the lack of development opportunities in the area, offering potential recruits money in exchange for joining the WNBF. While waging an insurgency against the Ugandan government, Oris allegedly committed human rights violations by planting landmines in ambush attempts. He also fought with his followers in the Second Sudanese Civil War on the side of the Sudanese government. In March 1997, the WNBF and its allies suffered a heavy defeat when South Sudanese rebels of the SPLA overran their bases in Zaire and Sudan, and then ambushed their retreating forces near Yei during Operation &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;. Oris was badly wounded during this battle, and the WNBF almost completely destroyed. Most WNBF fighters, including deputy commander Abdulatif Tiyua, were killed or captured. Oris and the remnants of his militia subsequently fled to Juba. From then on, the WNBF was &quot;essentially spent&quot; as fighting force.

Having suffered a stroke in late 1999, Oris was bedridden from then on. His condition worsened in early 2001, and he died at his home in Juba or Khartoum in March 2001. This disproved earlier reports according to which he had been killed in battle with the Uganda Peoples&#x27; Defence Forces. Oris was buried in Sudan.

<text>Konstantin Sokolsky (also spelled: Sokolski, , original name Konstantin Kudryavtsev (Константин Кудрявцев)) (7 December 1904 – 12 May 1991) was a Latvian singer. Sokolsky was born in Saint-Petersburg, Russian Empire, but for most of his life lived in Riga, Latvia (his father came from Ludzas County, which is where the family moved to after the revolutionary turmoil of 1917 began in Saint-Petersburg).

There he worked as a woodcutter and loader, until in 1928 at Riga&#x27;s &#x27;Mars&#x27; cinema he first appeared on stage as a singer. Initially, he tried to imitate Alexander Vertinsky (for example, he too sang in a Pierrot costume), but later found his own style. He got acquainted with popular composer Oscar Strok, author of tango music, and became the first to sing all his new songs. In the same time, he himself wrote lyrics and music for several songs.

In the 1930-1940s, first with the Riga Bonzo Theatre and later individually, he went on tours of Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, where he became very popular among different audiences, including many Russian émigrés. Sokolsky&#x27;s stage image was refined, but could still be interpreted as acting the &#x27;Russian bear&#x27;, with a sense of self-parody. Very tall, joyous, with self-respect — he reminded many Russian émigrés of their Mother Russia, which they had had to leave, sooner or later after the Bolshevik revolution.

In Russia, his songs also became popular, released on L.P.&#x27;s with the Bonophon and Bellaccord labels.

During World War II, he stayed in Latvia. In 1944 he was arrested by the Germans, but escaped.

<text>Herman Willem Daendels (21 October 1762 – 2 May 1818) was a Dutch military officer and colonial administrator who served as governor-general of the Dutch East Indies from 1808 to 1811.

==Early life==
Herman Willem Daendels was born on 21 October 1762 in Hattem, Netherlands. His father, Burchard Johan Daendels, served as a mayoral secretary; his mother was Josina Christina Tulleken. Daendels pursued a legal education at the university of Harderwijk and obtained his doctorate on 10 April 1783.

==Political activity==

In 1785, Daendels aligned himself with the Patriots, a faction gaining control in various Dutch cities. In September 1786, he unsuccessfully defended the town of Hattem against troops loyal to the stadholder. The following year, in September 1787, Daendels played a role in the defense of Amsterdam against the invading Prussian army, which aimed to reinstate William V of Orange. Subsequently, when William V regained power, Daendels fled to French Flanders to evade a death sentence resulting from the Patriots&#x27; defeat. During this time, he closely observed the French Revolution unfolding.

In 1794, Daendels returned to the Netherlands as a general in the French revolutionary army, serving under General Charles Pichegru and commanding the Batavian Legion. He actively supported the elevation of unitarian politician Pieter Vreede to power through a coup d&#x27;état on 25 January 1798. This move was motivated by dissatisfaction with the conservative-moderate majority in parliament, which hindered the development of a more democratic and centralized constitution. However, Vreede&#x27;s rule did not yield the anticipated outcomes, leading to another coup d&#x27;état against him on 14 June 1798, in which Daendels played a role. In the Batavian Republic, Daendels held various political positions but was compelled to resign after failing to avert the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799. He later pursued farming in Heerde, Gelderland.

==Military and colonial career==
===Governor-general of the Dutch East Indies===

Louis Bonaparte appointed Daendels as colonel-general in 1806 and governor-general of the Dutch East Indies in 1807. Daendels arrived in Batavia (now Jakarta) on 5 January 1808 after a lengthy voyage, assuming the role previously held by Albertus Henricus Wiese. His primary objective was to expel the British from Java.

During his tenure, Daendels undertook various infrastructure projects. He established new hospitals and military barracks, constructed arms factories in Surabaya and Semarang, and founded a military college in Batavia. The Castle in Batavia was dismantled and replaced by a new fort in Meester Cornelis (Jatinegara). At the same time, &quot;Fort Lodewijk&quot; (Fort Ludwig) was built in Surabaya. Additionally, he relocated the central government from Old Batavia to Weltevreden and commissioned the construction of a palace in Paradeplaats. His most renowned achievement was the Great Post Road () that spanned northern Java from Anyer to Panarukan. Today, this road serves as the main thoroughfare on the island, known as Jalur Pantura. Notably, the construction of this thousand-kilometer road in a single year resulted in the deaths of numerous Javanese forced laborers.

Daendels adopted a stern stance towards Javanese rulers, causing them to align themselves with the British against the Dutch. He also imposed forced labor (&quot;Rodi&quot;) on the population of Java, which sparked rebellious incidents like the ones in Cadas Pangeran, West Java.

Opinions differ regarding the extent to which Daendels improved the efficiency of the local bureaucracy and curbed corruption, although he accumulated personal wealth during his time in office. 

Despite his efforts to bolster defenses, Daendels was unsuccessful in halting the British invasion of the Spice Islands in 1810.

===General in Napoleon&#x27;s ===

During the incorporation of the Kingdom of Holland into France in 1810, Daendels returned to Holland and resided in Paris by November 1811. He was appointed as a divisional general (major general) and assumed command of the 26th Division of the . This division consisted of troops from Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, and Berg. In mid-March 1812, Daendels was appointed as the commander of the 26th Division, serving under Marshal Victor as part of IX Corps, which acted as a reserve.

In August, Victor received orders to march eastward, joining the Badeners in the Russian campaign 1812. Daendels arrived in Vilnius on 8 and 15 September, subsequently reaching Minsk. On 11 October, his division moved to Babinovichi, and on 20 October, they received orders to proceed to Vitebsk. By 27 October, they had occupied the nearby town of Beshankovichy. The following day, temperatures dropped below zero. The supplies in Vitebsk were lost when the Russian army captured the city, and it began to snow on 29 October.

On 11 November, Daendels and the rearguard arrived in Chashniki, approximately 90 km southwest of their previous location. On 14 November, during the battle of Smoliani, the French suffered the loss of 3,000 men against General Peter Wittgenstein, and heavy snowfall of about 1.5 meters occurred that day. Four days later, the supplies in Minsk were also lost when Pavel Chichagov captured the city.

On 24 November, Daendels skirmished with some Russians but reunited with the rest of the French army near Bobr. Subsequently, all the French soldiers proceeded to Borisov, where the Russian army destroyed a crucial bridge crossing the Berezina River. Daendels&#x27; division, consisting of 4,000 men, played a decisive role in the Battle of Berezina.

From February 1813 until December 1813, General Daendels commanded Polish forces defending the Modlin Fortress, located northwest of Warsaw. It was the final French stronghold along the Vistula to surrender.

===Governor-general of the Dutch Gold Coast===
Following the downfall of Napoleon, concerns arose within the Dutch government, including King William I, regarding the potential influence and oppositional leadership of Daendels. To prevent this, he was appointed as the governor-general of the Dutch Gold Coast (now part of Ghana) and effectively prohibited from returning to the Netherlands. After the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade, Daendels aimed to revitalize the neglected Dutch territories into an African plantation colony focused on legitimate business. Leveraging his experience from the East Indies, he devised ambitious infrastructure projects, such as a comprehensive road network with a primary route connecting Elmina and Kumasi in Ashanti. The Dutch government granted him considerable autonomy and a substantial budget to execute his plans. Simultaneously, Daendels viewed his governorship as an opportunity to establish a personal monopoly on business in the Dutch Gold Coast.

In 1817, the British accused Daendels of supporting and facilitating the Atlantic slave trade, despite its prohibition by both the British and Dutch authorities, from his position at the Elmina fort, which was then under Dutch control. On 5 March 1817, the British governor of Cape Coast, John Smith, wrote to the African Committee in Parliament in London, stating, &quot;We deem it our duty to inform you of the conduct of General Daendels, who is acting independent of his Government. Portuguese vessels were furnished with canoes, and Spaniards were supplied with water. At the beginning of last month, a large Spanish ship was four days at anchor in Elmina roads, receiving water and bartering dollars for goods suited for the purchase of slaves.&quot;

None of Daendels&#x27; infrastructure plans came to fruition, as he succumbed to malaria on 2 May 1818 while in the castle of St. George d&#x27;Elmina, which served as the Dutch seat of government. His body was interred in the central tomb at the Dutch cemetery in Elmina. He had been in the country less than two years.

<text>Ian Mayes is a British journalist and editor. He was the first &quot;readers&#x27; editor&quot; – a title he invented for the newspaper ombudsman role — of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, from November 1997 to March 2007, and was president of the international Organization of News Ombudsmen from May 2005 to May 2007, serving as a board member since May 2002 after joining in April 2001.

==Background==
Ian Mayes&#x27; career as a journalist spans six decades and includes many years as features editor of the &quot;Northampton Chronicle and Echo&quot;, before he joined BBC Radio News in Broadcasting House (1979–87), then became assistant features editor of the short-lived &quot;London Daily News&quot;.

Mayes began writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a freelance in 1962, his first piece being a story on the features page (then edited by Brian Redhead) about the return of Laurie Lee to the village of Slad in Gloucestershire, where &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot; was set. It was towards the end of 1988 that Mayes joined the staff of the newspaper; his first ten years included launching &quot;The Guardian Weekend&quot; magazine and the daily &quot;G2&quot; section with former editor Alan Rusbridger, and time served as deputy features editor, arts editor and obituaries editor.

From November 1997 to March 2007, Mayes was &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Readers&#x27; Editor – a title he invented for the newspaper ombudsman role to suggest a bridge between readers and journalists — the first such appointment of a resident independent ombudsman in the UK. Other British newspapers, including &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, quickly followed suit in appointing readers&#x27; editors, although Mayes was the only one to do the job full-time. The &quot;Guardian&quot; system was also closely replicated on newspapers such as &quot;Politiken&quot; in Denmark and &quot;The Hindu&quot; in India.

Through an influential weekly column called &quot;Open Door&quot;, Mayes dealt with corrections and clarifications (14,000 in his decade in the post), as well as conducting a debate on the ethics of journalism. Selections from the columns were collected in four books: &quot;Corrections and Clarifications&quot; (2000), &quot;Corrections and Clarifications 2002&quot; (2002), &quot;Only Correct: The Best of Corrections and Clarifications&quot; (2005) and &quot;Journalism Right and Wrong: Ethical and Other Issues Raised by Readers in the Guardian&#x27;s Open Door Column&quot;. A translated selection of the columns was produced by Moscow State University under the title &quot;Rabota nad oshibkami&quot; (Work on mistakes).

He was president of the international Organization of News Ombudsmen (ONO) from May 2005 to May 2007, serving as a board member since May 2002 after joining in April 2001. He has lectured and taken part in seminars on the function of ombudsmen in the media nationally and internationally (including in the US, Russia, Scandinavia, and Slovenia), inspiring newspapers in other parts of the world to create their own readers&#x27; editors; typically, &quot;The Hindu&quot; has referenced &quot;the exemplary practice and experience of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, whose pioneering RE, Ian Mayes, had set the bar high.&quot; He is credited with the discovery of the &quot;apostrofly&quot;, &quot;an insect which lands at random on the printed page depositing an apostrophe wherever it alights&quot;. His last column as Readers&#x27; Editor appeared on 2 April 2007, since when he has been an associate editor of the &quot;Guardian&quot;.

He has been honoured by the creation of &quot;The Ian Mayes Award for Writing Wrongs&quot; in 2008.

Mayes has been researching and writing over the past decade the third volume of the official history of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, beginning in 1986, his aim being to &quot;humanise the decisions that have shaped the &quot;Guardian&quot; and its editorial line&quot;.

===Hazlitt Society===
Mayes was instrumental in the project to restore William Hazlitt&#x27;s grave, after visiting the original neglected gravestone in St Anne&#x27;s Churchyard early in 2001. The restored grave was unveiled by Michael Foot on the 225th anniversary of Hazlitt&#x27;s birth, 10 April 2003. Mayes was closely involved with the subsequent formation of the Hazlitt Society, of which he was inaugural Chairman.

<doc id="1250244" wikidata="Q157408" url="?curid=1250244" title="Plantago lanceolata">
<text>Plantago lanceolata is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae. It is known by the common names ribwort plantain, narrowleaf plantain, English plantain, ribleaf, lamb&#x27;s tongue, and buckhorn. It is a common weed on cultivated or disturbed land.

==Description==

The plant is a rosette-forming perennial herb, with leafless, silky, hairy flower stems, growing to tall, exceptionally . The basal leaves are lanceolate spreading or erect, scarcely toothed with 3–5 strong parallel veins narrowed to a short petiole. The flower stalk is deeply furrowed, ending in an ovoid inflorescence of many small flowers each with a pointed bract. Each inflorescence can produce up to 200 seeds. Flowers are , with a green calyx and brownish corolla, four bent-back lobes with brown midribs and long white stamens.

=== Reproduction ===
The mode of reproduction can vary among populations. Reproduction occurs sexually, with the pollen being wind dispersed for the most part, though the plant is occasionally pollinated by bees. 

=== Chemistry ===
&quot;Plantago lanceolata&quot; contains phenylethanoids such as acteoside (verbascoside), cistanoside F, lavandulifolioside, plantamajoside and isoacteoside. It also contains the iridoid glycosides aucubin and catalpol.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Plantago lanceolata&quot; is common in Europe, including Britain. It is widespread throughout the British Isles, but scarce on the most acidic soils (pH &lt; 4.5). It is present and widespread in the Americas and Australia as an introduced species. 

Considered to be an indicator of agriculture in pollen diagrams, &quot;P. lanceolata&quot; has been found in western Norway from the Early Neolithic onwards, which is considered an indicator of grazing in that area at the time.

The species can live anywhere from very dry meadows to places similar to a rain forest, but it does best in open, disturbed areas. It is therefore common near roadsides where other plants cannot flourish; it grows tall if it can do so, but in frequently mowed areas it adopts a flat growth habit instead. Historically, the plant has thrived in areas where ungulates graze and turn up the earth with their hooves.

=== Invasiveness ===
Ribwort Plantain is considered an invasive species across the United States and Australia. Accidently introduced to the USA in 1822, it has since spread throughout the country, especially in disturbed habitats like lawns (surviving even when mowed), meadows, and roadsides. While generally not toxic to livestock, it can be unpalatable and reduce the quality of pasture for grazing animals. Additionally, in areas where it thrives, ribwort can contribute to respiratory issues such as hay fever due to its pollen and wind-born nature.

One of the plant&#x27;s most notable traits is its ability to remain dormant for up to 177 years, which is among the longest dormancy periods observed in plants. This allows the plant to remain unnoticed for long periods before suddenly expanding and becoming problematic. The plant is now considered a noxious weed in states like Iowa and Michigan, and its spread continues to impact local flora and fauna. Ribwort’s ability to lay dormant for long periods before reawakening makes it a particularly tricky invader, as it can seem to emerge suddenly and expand rapidly when conditions become more favorable, contributing to its success as a persistent and disruptive species..

== Ecology ==
Songbirds eat the seeds, and the leaves are eaten by rabbits.

The iridoid glycosides the plant contains make it inedible to some herbivores, but others are unperturbed by them—for example, the buckeye butterfly &quot;Junonia coenia&quot;, whose larvae eat the leaves of &quot;P. lanceolata&quot; and ingest the iridoid glycosides to make themselves unpalatable to predators.

=== Insect predation ===
&quot;Plantago lanceolata&quot; is host to many different species of the order Lepidoptera. Species such as &quot;Junonia coenia, Spilosoma congrua,&quot; and &quot;Melitaea cinxia&quot; lay their eggs on &quot;P. lanceolata&quot; plants so they can serve as a food source for the larvae when they hatch. The iridoid glycosides in the plant leaves accumulate in the caterpillars and make them unpalatable to predators.

===Infection by powdery mildew===
&quot;Podosphaera plantaginis&quot; is a powdery mildew fungus that infects &quot;P. lanceolata&quot;. All of the &quot;P. lanceolata&quot; populations are infected by several strains of this powdery mildew fungus. Once the populations are infected, the symptoms are minimal at first. Then, after a few weeks or months lesions start to appear covering the entire surface of the leaves and the stem, making it very noticeable. Another species that infects &quot;P. lanceolata&quot; is &quot;Golovinomyces sordidus&quot;. Both of these mildews are obligate biotrophs, meaning that they can only infect living tissue. They cover the surface of the leaves and extend hyphae into the cell matrix in order to extract nutrients.

====Resistance to powdery mildew====
After the populations are infected, they react in different ways. Some populations of &quot;P. lanceolata&quot; are more susceptible to different strains of powdery mildew. Also, some populations have multiple resistance phenotypes where on the other hand, others may only have one resistance phenotype. Overall, the populations that have the highest variety of resistance phenotypes will have the highest survival rates particularly when rates of infection are high.

== Uses ==
&quot;Plantago lanceolata&quot; is used frequently in herbal teas and other herbal remedies. A tea from the leaves is used as a cough medicine. In traditional Austrian medicine, the leaves have been used internally (as syrup or tea) or externally (fresh leaves) for treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, skin, insect bites, and infections. The leaves can be eaten when very young. The flower buds have a mushroom-like flavour and can be used to make stock.

==In culture==
Children use the plant in a game where the flower&#x27;s head is &quot;shot&quot; off the end of stalk; it has alternately been called &quot;rifle&quot;, &quot;1 o&#x27;clock gun&quot; (after the gun that fires everyday from Edinburgh Castle), and other names. To play the game, one would pluck a stalk and wrap a loop of the distal end of the stem around the section of stem closest to the flower&#x27;s head. The loop is tightened so it stops up behind the flower&#x27;s head and the stem is pulled backward until the flower head pops off. The stalk is slightly elastic so when the flower head separates, it (the head) flies off in the direction the stalk is pointed like a gun, hence the gun-related names given to it.

In the West Country of England the same game is called &#x27;cannonballs&#x27;. Another game played with the plant in Britain and Ireland is a variation of conkers; a child tries to knock off the flowerhead of their friendly rival&#x27;s stalk using their own stalk with a fast downward thrust. This pastime is known vernacularly as &#x27;dongers&#x27; in Kent and &#x27;Carl doddies&#x27; (along with the plant itself) in Scotland.

<doc id="1250251" wikidata="Q1253496" url="?curid=1250251" title="Doxography">
<text>Doxography ( – &quot;an opinion&quot;, &quot;a point of view&quot; +  – &quot;to write&quot;, &quot;to describe&quot;) is a term used especially for the works of classical historians, describing the points of view of past philosophers and scientists. The term was coined by the German classical scholar Hermann Alexander Diels.

== In Ancient Greek philosophy ==
A great many philosophical works have been lost; our limited knowledge of such lost works comes chiefly through the doxographical works of later philosophers, commentators, and biographers. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy lists the following works as being representative doxographies:
* Cicero - &quot;Academica&quot;, &quot;De Finibus&quot;, &quot;De Natura Deorum&quot;, &quot;De Fato&quot;, &quot;De Officiis&quot;
* Aetius - &quot;Vetusta Placita&quot;
* Clement of Alexandria - &quot;Stromateis&quot;
* Diogenes Laertius - &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;
* Hippolytus of Rome - &quot;Refutation of All Heresies&quot;

Philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle also act as doxographers, as their comments on the ideas of their predecessors indirectly tell us what their predecessors&#x27; beliefs were. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Defense of Socrates&quot;, for example, tells us much of what we know about the natural philosophy of Anaxagoras.

===Successions of Philosophers===
&quot;Successions of Philosophers&quot; were works whose purpose was to depict the philosophers of different schools in terms of a line of succession of which they were a part. From the 3rd to the 1st centuries BC there were &quot;Successions&quot; () written by Antigonus of Carystus, Sotion, Heraclides Lembos (an epitome of Sotion), Sosicrates, Alexander Polyhistor, Jason of Nysa, Antisthenes of Rhodes, and Nicias of Nicaea. The surviving &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot; by Diogenes Laërtius (3rd century AD) draws upon this tradition.

In addition to these, there were often histories of single schools. Such works were created by Phanias of Eresus (&quot;On the Socratics&quot;), Idomeneus of Lampsacus (&quot;On the Socratics&quot;), Sphaerus (&quot;On the Eretrian philosophers&quot;), and Straticles (&quot;On Stoics&quot;). Among the papyri found at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, there are works devoted to the successions of the Stoics, Academics, and Epicureans. In a later period, Plutarch produced &quot;On the First Philosophers and their Successors&quot; and &quot;On the Cyrenaics&quot;, and Galen wrote &quot;On Plato&#x27;s Sect&quot; and &quot;On the Hedonistic Sect&quot; (Epicureans). There were often biographies of individual philosophers with a brief description of his successors. Of such nature were Aristoxenus&#x27;s &quot;Life of Pythagoras&quot;, Andronicus&#x27;s &quot;Life of Aristotle&quot;, Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Life of Aristotle&quot;, and Iamblichus&#x27;s &quot;Life of Pythagoras&quot;.

==In other traditions==
===Persian doxography===
The Persian Dabestan-e Mazaheb discusses numerous philosophies including several in Persia and India. Its author appears to belong to a Persian Sipásíán tradition which differs somewhat from orthodox Zoroastrianism. Its authorship is disputed. Some scholars have suggested that Kay-Khosrow Esfandiyar, the son of Azar Kayvan may have written it.

===Jain doxography===
Haribhadra (8th century CE) was one of the leading proponents of &quot;anekāntavāda&quot;. He was the first classical author to write a doxography, a compendium of a variety of intellectual views. This attempted to contextualise Jain thoughts within the broad framework. It interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to Indian thinkers around the 8th century.

=== Islamic doxography ===
Islamic doxography is an aggregate of theosophical works (like &quot;Kitab al-Maqalat&quot; by Abu Mansur Al Maturidi) concerning the aberrations in Islamic sects and streams.

<text>Dorothea Margaretha &quot;Teddy&quot; Scholten (; 11 May 1926 – 8 April 2010) was a Dutch singer and television presenter. She is known for winning the Eurovision Song Contest 1959 with the song &quot;Een beetje&quot;, representing the Netherlands.

== Career ==
In 1950, Scholten was invited by The Coca-Cola Company to perform at a show in the United States. She was one of the first Dutch popular music artists to perform in the United States.

In 1959, she won the &quot;Nationaal Songfestival&quot; 1959 with the song &quot;Een beetje&quot;, written by Willy van Hemert and Dick Schallies. This gave her the right to represent the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest 1959, held in Cannes, France. She went on to win the competition, receiving a total of 21 points from the international juries. This marked the second win of the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest. &quot;Een beetje&quot; was also recorded in French (&quot;Un p&#x27;tit peu&quot;), German (&quot;Sei ehrlich&quot;), Italian (&quot;Un poco&quot;) and Swedish (&quot;Om våren&quot;).

With her husband, Henk Scholten, she recorded several albums, many of them containing songs for children. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s she appeared in popular television shows in the Netherlands. In 1965 and 1966, she presented the &quot;Nationaal Songfestival&quot;, the Dutch national final for the Eurovision Song Contest.

Scholten died in The Hague on 8 April 2010, aged 83.

<text>The Royal Palace of Madrid () is the official residence of the Spanish royal family at the city of Madrid, although now used only for state ceremonies.
The palace has of floor space and contains 3,418 rooms. It is the largest royal palace in Europe.

The palace is owned by the Spanish state and administered by the Patrimonio Nacional (English: National Heritage), a public agency of the Ministry of the Presidency. The palace is on Calle de Bailén (&quot;Bailén Street&quot;) in the western part of downtown Madrid, east of the Manzanares River, and is accessible from the Ópera metro station. Felipe VI and the royal family do not reside in the palace, choosing instead the Palace of Zarzuela in El Pardo. 

The palace is on the site of a bygone Muslim-era fortress constructed by Emir Muhammad I of Córdoba in the 9th century. The imposing Alcázar of Madrid provided both a safe for the royal treasure and a habitual residence to the Trastámara monarchs in the late Middle Ages. Having endured substantial expansion works during the 16th century, the royal &quot;alcázar&quot; remained on the site until it burned down on 24 December 1734. A new palace was then built from scratch on the same site on behalf of the Bourbon dynasty. Construction spanned the years 1738 to 1755 and followed a Berniniesque design by Filippo Juvarra and Giovanni Battista Sacchetti in cooperation with Ventura Rodríguez, Francesco Sabatini, and Martín Sarmiento. During the Second Spanish Republic the building was known as &quot;Palacio Nacional&quot;.

The interior of the palace is notable for its wealth of art and the use of many types of fine materials in the construction and the decoration of its rooms. It includes paintings by artists such as Caravaggio, Juan de Flandes, Francisco de Goya, and Diego Velázquez, and frescoes by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Corrado Giaquinto, and Anton Raphael Mengs. Many of the paintings at some time hung in the palace as part of the Spanish royal collection are exhibited elsewhere, especially in the Prado Museum and the Royal Collections Gallery, both in Madrid. 

Other collections of great historical and artistic importance preserved in the building include the Royal Armoury of Madrid, porcelain, watches, furniture, silverware, and the world&#x27;s only complete Stradivarius string quintet.

==History of the building==

The palace was initially built by Muhammad I, Umayyad Emir of Cordoba, between 860 and 880. After the Moors were driven out of Toledo in the 11th century, the castle retained its defensive function. Henry III of Castile added several towers. His son John II used it as a royal residence. During the War of the Castilian Succession (1476) the troops of Joanna la Beltraneja were besieged in the alcázar, during which the building suffered severe damage.

The only drawing of the castle from the Middle Ages is one from 1534 by Jan Cornelisz Vermeyen.

Emperor Charles V, with the architects Alonso de Covarrubias and Luis de Vega, extended and renovated the castle in 1537. Philip II made Madrid his capital in 1561 and continued the renovations, with new additions. Philip III and Philip IV added a long southern façade between 1610 and 1636.

Philip V of Bourbon renovated the royal apartments in 1700. The alcázar of the Habsburgs was austere in comparison to the Palace of Versailles where the new king had spent his childhood; and he began a series of redesigns mainly planned by Teodoro Ardemans and René Carlier, with the main rooms being redecorated by Queen Maria Luisa of Savoy and the Princess of Ursins in the style of French palaces.

===The baroque palace===
On Christmas Eve 1734, the alcázar was destroyed by a fire that originated in the rooms of the French painter Jean Ranc. Response to the fire was delayed due to the warning bells being confused with the call to mass. For fear of looting, the doors of the building remained closed, hampering rescue efforts. Many works of art were lost, such as the &quot;Expulsion of the Moors&quot;, by Diego Velázquez. Others, such as , were rescued by tossing them out the windows. Fortunately, many pieces were saved because shortly before the blaze the King ordered that much of his collection be moved to the Buen Retiro Palace. This fire lasted four days and completely destroyed the old alcázar, whose remaining walls were finally demolished in 1738.
Italian architect Filippo Juvarra oversaw work on the new palace and devised a lavish project inspired by Bernini&#x27;s plans for the Louvre. Initially Juvarra wanted to build the palace in another location, however, the idea was discarded. His disciple Giambattista Sacchetti, also known as Juan Bautista Sacchetti or Giovanni Battista Sacchetti, was chosen to continue the work of his mentor. Sacchetti designed the structure to encompass a large square courtyard and resolved sightline problems by creating projecting wings.

In 1760, Charles III called upon Sicilian Francesco Sabatini, a Neoclassical architect, to enlarge the building. Sabatini&#x27;s original idea was to frame the Plaza de la Armería with a series of galleries and arcades, to accommodate various dependencies, by constructing two wings along the square. Only the extension of the southeast tower known as &quot;la de San Gil&quot; was completed. Sabatini also planned to extend the north side with a large wing that echoed the style of the main building and included three square courtyards that would be smaller than the large central courtyard. Work on this expansion started quickly but was soon interrupted, leaving the foundations buried under a platform on which the royal stables were later built. The stables were demolished in the 20th century and replaced by the Sabatini Gardens. Charles III first occupied the palace in 1764.

In the 19th century, Ferdinand VII, who spent many years imprisoned in the Château de Valençay, began the most thorough renovation of the palace. The aim of this redesign was to turn the old-fashioned Italian-style building into a modern French-style palace. However, his grandson Alfonso XII proposed to turn the palace into a Victorian-style residence. Alfonso&#x27;s plans were designed by the architect José Segundo de Lema and consisted of remodeling several rooms, replacing marble floors with parquet, and adding period furniture.

In the twentieth century, restoration work was needed to repair damage suffered during the Spanish Civil War, by repairing or reinstalling decoration and decorative trim and replacing damaged walls with faithful reproductions of the originals.

The palace is now open to the public, except during state functions, although it is so large that only a selection of rooms are on the visitor route at any one time, the route being changed every few months. An admission fee is charged; however, at some times it is free.

==Exterior==
The main façade of the palace, the one facing the Plaza de la Armeria, consists of a two-story rusticated stone base, from which rise Ionic columns on Tuscan pilasters framing the windows of the three main floors. The upper story is hidden behind a cornice which encircles the building and is capped with a large balustrade. This was adorned with a series of statues of saints and kings, but these were relocated elsewhere under the reign of Charles III to give the building a more classical appearance.

The restoration of the façade in 1973, which includes Sabitini&#x27;s balcony of four Doric columns, returned some of Sachetti&#x27;s sculptures. These include statues of the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II and the Inca emperor Atahualpa, works by Juan Pascual de Mena and Domingo Martínez, respectively. Representations of the Roman emperors Honorius, Theodosius I, and Arcadius by G.D. Olivieri, and Trajan by Felipe de Castro were placed in the Prince&#x27;s courtyard. Flanking Sabatini&#x27;s clock the Statues of Philip V, Ferdinand VI, Barbara of Braganza and Maria Luisa of Savoy interspersed with &quot;The Rising Sun Following the Zodiac&quot;. Above the clock is the royal coat of arms flanked by angels, and, above that, bells that date from 1637 and 1761.

===Plaza de la Armería===

The square as it exists now was laid-out in 1892, according to a plan by the architect Enrique María Repullés. However, the history of this square dates back to 1553, the year in which Philip II ordered a building to house the royal stables.

The Almudena Cathedral faces the palace across the plaza. Its exterior is neo-classical to match its surroundings while its interior is neo-gothic. Construction was funded by King Alfonso XII to house the remains of his wife Mercedes of Orléans. Construction of the church began in 1878 and concluded in 1992.

Narciso Pascual Colomer, the same architect who crafted the Plaza de Oriente, designed the layout of the plaza in 1879, but failed to materialize. The site now occupied by the Plaza de la Armería was used for many decades as anteplaza de armas. Sachetti tried to build a cathedral to finish the cornice of the Manzanares, and Sabatini proposed to unite this building with the royal palace, to form a single block. Both projects were ignored by Charles III.

Ángel Fernández de los Ríos in 1868 proposed the creation of a large wooded area that would travel all around the Plaza de Oriente, in order to give a better view of the Royal Palace. A decade later Segundo de Lema added a staircase to the original design of Fernández, which led to the idea of Francisco de Cubas to give more importance to the emerging church of Almudena.

===Plaza de Oriente===
The Plaza de Oriente is a rectangular park that connects the east façade of Palacio Real to the Teatro Real. The eastern side of plaza is curved and bordered by several cafes in the adjoining buildings. Although the plaza was part of Sacchetti&#x27;s plan for the palace, construction did not begin until 1808 when King Joseph Bonaparte, who ordered the demolition of approximately 60 medieval structures, that included a church, monastery and royal library, located on the site. Joseph was deposed before construction was completed, it was finished by Queen Isabella II who tasked architect Narciso Pascual Colomer with creating the final design in 1844.
Pathways divide the Plaza into three main plots: the Central Gardens, the Cabo Noval Gardens and the Lepanto Gardens. The Central Gardens are arranged in a grid around the central monument to Philip IV, following the Baroque model garden. They consist of seven flowerbeds, each bordered with box hedges and holding small cypress, yew and magnolias and annual flowers. The north and south boundaries of the Central Gardens are marked by a row of statues, popularly known as the &quot;Gothic kings&quot;— sculptures representing five Visigoth rulers and fifteen rulers of the early Christian kingdoms in the Reconquista. They are carved from limestone, and are part of a series dedicated to all monarchs of Spain. These were ordered for the decoration of the Palacio Real and were executed between 1750 and 1753. Engineers felt the statues were too heavy for the palace balustrade, so they were left on ground level where their lack of fine detail is readily apparent. The remainder of the statues are in the Sabatini Gardens.

Isabel II laid out the grounds so that Pietro Tacca&#x27;s equestrian statue of Philip IV was placed in the center, opposite the Prince&#x27;s Gate.

===Campo del Moro Gardens===

These gardens are so named because the Muslim leader Ali ben Yusuf allegedly camped here with his troops in 1109 during an attempted reconquest of Madrid. The first improvements to the area occurred under King Philip IV, who built fountains and planted various types of vegetation, but its overall look remained largely neglected. During the construction of the palace various landscaping projects were put forth based on the gardens of the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, but lack of funds hampered further improvement until the reign of Isabella II who began work in earnest. Following the taste of the times, the park was designed in the Romanticist style.

The Triton fountain from the Islet Garden of Aranjuez and the Fountain of the Shells from the Palace of Infante don Luis at Boadilla del Monte were aligned in the center of the right angled pathways by Isabel II, according to plans by Narciso Pascual Colomer. Under the regency of Maria Christina of Austria, the park was reformed according to Ramon Oliva&#x27;s Romantic-style plans. Between the Fountain of Tritons and the palace is The Large Cavern or Grotto (Camellia House), built by Juan de Villanueva during the reign of Joseph Bonaparte. Sacchetti&#x27;s 1757-1758 Little Cavern or Grotto (Potato Room) is in front of the Parade Ground.

===Sabatini Gardens===

The Sabatini Gardens adjoin the north side of the Palacio real and extend to the calle de Bailén and the cuesta de San Vicente. The garden follows the symmetrical French design and work began in 1933, under the Republican government. Although they were designed by Zaragozan architect Fernando García Mercadal, they were named for Francesco Sabatini who designed the royal stables that previously occupied this site. These gardens feature a large rectangular pond which is surrounded by four fountains and statues of Spanish kings which were originally intended to crown the Royal Palace. Geometrically sited between its rides, there are several fountains.

The Republican government constructed the gardens to return the area from control of the royal family to the people, the public was not allowed in the gardens until 1978 when they were opened by King Juan Carlos I.

==Interior of the palace==
===Ground Floor===
====Grand Staircase====

Built by Sabatini in 1789 when Charles IV wanted it moved to the opposite side of where Sabatini placed it in 1760, it is composed of a single piece of San Agustin marble. Two lions grace the landing, one by Felipe de Castro and another by Robert Michel. The frescoes on the ceiling is by Corrado Giaquinto and depicts &quot;Religion Protected by Spain&quot;. On the ground floor is a statue of Charles III in Roman toga, with a similar statue on the first floor depicting Charles IV. The four cartouches at the corners depict the elements of water, earth, air and fire.

====Royal Library====
The Royal Library was moved to the lower floor during the regency of Maria Christina. The bookshelves date from the period of Charles III, Isabella II and Alfonso XII.

Highlights of the collection include the Book of hours of Isabella I of Castile, a codex of the time of Alfonso XI of Castile, a Bible of Doña María de Molina and the &quot;Fiestas reales&quot;, dedicated to Ferdinand VI by Farinelli. Also important are the maps kept in the library, which analyze the extent of the kingdoms under the Spanish Empire. Also on display a selection of the best medals from the Royal Collection.
The bookcovers demonstrate evolution of binding styles by era. Examples in the holdings include Rococo in gold with iron lace, Neoclassical in polychrome and Romantic with Gothic and Renaissance motifs.

The Archives of the Royal Palace contains approximately twenty thousand articles ranging from the Disastrous decade (1823-1833) to the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. In addition, it holds some scores of musicians of the Royal Chapel, privileges of various kings, the founding order of the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, the testament of Philip II and correspondence of most of the kings of the House of Bourbon.

====Royal Pharmacy====
During the reign of Philip II the Royal Pharmacy became an appendage of the royal household and ordered the supply of medicines, a role that continues today.

The collection includes jars made in La Granja de San Ildefonso, 19th century, and Talavera de la Reina pottery, 18th century.

====Royal Armory====

Along with the Imperial Armoury of Vienna, the armoury is considered one of the best in the world and consists of pieces as early as the 13th century. This collection of weapons and armor once worn by kings and their top soldiers. The building, designed by J.S. de Lema and E. Repulles, was opened in 1897

The collection highlights the tournament pieces made for Charles V and Philip II by the leading armourers of Milan and Augsburg. Among the most remarkable works are full armour and weapons that Emperor Charles V used in the Battle of Mühlberg, and which was portrayed by Titian in his famous equestrian portrait housed at the Museo del Prado. Unfortunately, parts of the collection were lost during the Peninsular War and during the Spanish Civil War. 

Still, the armoury retains some of the most important pieces of this art in Europe and the world, including a shield and burgonet by Francesco and Filippo Negroli, one of the most famous designers in the armourers&#x27; guild.

In 1766 he was once again chosen as a deputy from his province. Having received the marshal&#x27;s staff in 1766, he was one of the contributed to modernize and expand the capital city of Warsaw, and worked on the reform of the criminal justice system. During the Bar Confederation, he tried to influence strengthen the king in resistance towards Russia, trying to win him over to the side of the Confederates and France. Member of the confederation of 1773. As a member of the delegation to the Partition Sejm (1773–1775), he was a representative of the opposition. However, on 18 September 1773 he signed treaties of cession by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth of the lands seized by Russia, Prussia and Austria in the first partition of Poland.

<text>Dragomir Milošević (Serbian Cyrillic: Драгомир Милошевић; born 4 February 1942) is a Bosnian Serb and former commander of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps (SRK) of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) which besieged Sarajevo for three years during the Bosnian War. He was subsequently convicted of war crimes and sentenced to 29 years in prison.

==Background==
Milošević was an officer in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) prior to 1992. The JNA posted Milošević to Lukavica, near Sarajevo which is where he was when the war began. He succeeded Stanislav Galić as commander of the SRK on 10 August 1994 and remained in that position until the end of the war.

In December 2004, he surrendered to the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), before which he faced charges for four counts of crimes against humanity and three counts of violations of the laws or customs of war.

==ICTY conviction==
On 12 December 2007, Milošević was convicted on five counts of terror, murder and inhumane acts conducted during a campaign of sniping and shelling which resulted in the injury and death of a great number of civilians in the besieged Bosnian capital. Two counts of unlawful attacks against civilians were dismissed. He was sentenced to 33 years of imprisonment. In the judgment summary, the Trial Chamber noted that many witnesses testified that “…there was no safe place in Sarajevo; one could be killed or injured anywhere and anytime”. Milošević had “….abused his position and that he, through his orders, planned and ordered gross and systematic violations of international humanitarian law&quot; and it was under Milošević&#x27;s command of the SRK that modified air bombs, which were “…inaccurate and served no military purpose”, were deployed. The repeated use of the weapon was considered an aggravating factor by the Trial Chamber in reaching its decision.

In January 2008, the prosecution filed an appeal to have the 33-year sentence increased to life in prison. In its appeal, the prosecution cited the use of particularly savage weapons and tactics against civilians in Sarajevo by the SRK while Milošević was in command. On 12 November 2009, the Tribunal Appeals Chamber partially affirmed the convictions and reduced the sentence to 29 years.

On 22 March 2011, Milošević was transported to Estonia to serve his sentence at Tartu Vangla.

<doc id="1250272" wikidata="Q11612630" url="?curid=1250272" title="Automatic door">
<text>An automatic door, also known as an auto door, is a door that opens automatically, without the need for human intervention or usually upon sensing the approach of a person. A person can be detected by microwave pulses, infrared sensors, or pressure-sensing pads.

==History==

In the 1st century AD, mathematician Heron of Alexandria in Roman Egypt invented the first known automatic door. He described two different automatic door applications. The first application used heat from a fire lit by the city&#x27;s temple priest. After a few hours atmospheric pressure built up in a brass vessel causing it to pump water into adjacent containers. These containers acted as weights that – through a series of ropes and pulleys – would open the temple&#x27;s doors at about the time people were to arrive for prayer. Heron used a similar application to open the gates to the city.

In 1931, engineers Horace H. Raymond and Sheldon S. Roby of the tool and hardware manufacturer Stanley Works designed the first model of an optical device triggering the opening of an automatic door. The invention was patented and installed in Wilcox&#x27;s Pier Restaurant in West Haven, Connecticut for the benefit of waiters carrying plates of food and drink. The entire system plus installation was sold for $100.

In 1954, Dee Horton and Lew Hewitt invented the first sliding automatic door. The automatic door used a mat actuator. In 1960, they co-founded Horton Automatics Inc and placed the first commercial automatic sliding door on the market.

With the invention of the Gunn diode, microwave motion detectors became common in automatic doors in the 1970s. In 1980, the first automatic door using an infrared sensor was introduced.

==In popular culture==
* In H. G. Wells’ 1899 serialised story &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot; appears an automatic door that slides upwards into the ceiling.
* In the cartoon &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, which first aired in 1962 and was set in the year 2062, doors opened automatically by sliding up into the ceiling.
* In the intro sequence to the television show &quot;Get Smart&quot;, which first aired in 1965, the main character walks down a hallway through various automatically opening doors, including hinged doors, pocket doors, and vertically sliding doors.
* Automatic pocket doors are a common fixture of the fictional universe of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, which first aired in 1966.
* The 1968 film, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, features pocket doors, some of which are opened by pressing a button, and some of which are opened by giving verbal commands to artificial intelligence computer systems. The concept of A.I.-controlled doors became a cultural touchstone through the film&#x27;s memorable quote, &quot;Open the pod bay doors, HAL.&quot;
* In the fictional universe of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the first film of which was first released in 1977, a variety of automatic doors are featured, including horizontally sliding pocket doors, vertically sliding doors, diagonally-oriented multi-layer blast doors, aperture doors, and iris doors.
* The comedy cartoon &quot;Futurama&quot;, which first aired in 1999, parodied many different types of automatic doors reminiscent of those seen in &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

<text>The province of Siena (, ) is a province in the Tuscany region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Siena.

== Geography ==
The province is divided into seven historical areas:
* Alta Val d&#x27;Elsa
* Chianti senese
* The urban area of (Monteriggioni and Siena)
* Val di Merse
* Crete Senesi Val d&#x27;Arbia
* Val di Chiana senese

The area is a hilly one: in the north is Colline del Chianti; Monte Amiata is the highest point at ; and in the south is Monte Cetona. To the west are the Colline Metallifere (), whilst the Valdichiana lies to east.

Historically, the province corresponds to the northeastern portion of the former Republic of Siena.

The chief occupations are agricultural (wheat, grapes and fruit) and silk culture. The wine known as Chianti is produced here as well as in other parts of Tuscany: the Chianti Colli Senesi, however, is limited to this province.

Apart from the city of Siena the principal towns are Poggibonsi, Colle di Val d&#x27;Elsa, Montepulciano, Chiusi, and San Gimignano.

=== &quot;Comuni&quot; ===

There are 35 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;) in the province.

The Province of Siena is an administrative body of intermediate level between a municipality (&quot;comune&quot;) and Tuscany region.

The three main functions devolved to the province of Siena are:
* local planning and zoning;
* provision of local police and fire services;
* transportation regulation (car registration, maintenance of local roads, etc.).

As an administrative institution, the province of Siena has its own elected bodies. From 1945 to 1995 the President of the province of Siena was chosen by the members of the Provincial Council, elected every five years by citizens. From 1995 to 2014, under provisions of the 1993 local administration reform, the President of the Province was chosen by popular election, originally every four, then every five years.

On 3 April 2014, the Italian Chamber of Deputies gave its final approval to the Law n.56/2014 which involves the transformation of the Italian provinces into &quot;institutional bodies of second level&quot;. According to the 2014 reform, each province is headed by a President (or Commissioner) assisted by a legislative body, the Provincial Council, and an executive body, the Provincial Executive. President (Commissioner) and members of Council are elected together by mayors and city councilors of each municipality of the province respectively every four and two years. The Executive is chaired by the President (Commissioner) who appoint others members, called &quot;assessori&quot;. Since 2015, the President (Commissioner) and other members of the Council do not receive a salary.

In each province, there is also a Prefect (&quot;prefetto&quot;), a representative of the central government who heads an agency called &quot;prefettura-ufficio territoriale del governo&quot;. The Questor (&quot;questore&quot;) is the head of State&#x27;s Police (&quot;Polizia di Stato&quot;) in the province and his office is called &quot;questura&quot;. There is also a province&#x27;s police force depending from local government, called provincial police (&quot;polizia provinciale&quot;).

<text>Edward Nash Yourdon (April 30, 1944 – January 20, 2016) was an American software engineer, computer consultant, author and lecturer, and software engineering methodology pioneer. He was one of the lead developers of the structured analysis techniques of the 1970s and a co-developer of both the Yourdon/Whitehead method for object-oriented analysis/design in the late 1980s and the Coad/Yourdon methodology for object-oriented analysis/design in the 1990s.

== Biography ==
Yourdon obtained his B.S. in applied mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1965, and did graduate work in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and the Polytechnic Institute of New York.

In 1964 Yourdon started working at Digital Equipment Corporation developing FORTRAN programs for the PDP-5 minicomputer and later assembler for the PDP-8. In the late 1960s and early 1970s he worked at a small consulting firm and as an independent consultant. In 1974 Yourdon founded his own consulting firm, YOURDON Inc., to provide educational, publishing, and consulting services. After he sold this firm in 1986 he served on the Board of multiple IT consultancy corporations and was advisor on several research project in the software industry throughout the 1990s.

In June 1997, Yourdon was inducted into the Computer Hall of Fame, along with such notables as Charles Babbage, James Martin, Grace Hopper, and Gerald Weinberg. In December 1999 &quot;Crosstalk: The Journal of Defense Software Engineering&quot; named him one of the ten most influential people in the software field.

In the late 1990s, Yourdon became the center of controversy over his beliefs that Y2K-related computer problems could result in severe software failures that would culminate in widespread social collapse. Due to the efforts of Yourdon and thousands of dedicated technologists, developers and project managers, these potential critical system failure points were successfully remediated, thus avoiding the problems Yourdon and others identified early enough to make a difference.

In the new millennium, Yourdon became Faculty Fellow at the Information Systems Research Center of the University of North Texas as well as Fellow of the Business Technology Trends Council for the Cutter Consortium, where he also was editor of the Cutter IT Journal.

== Work ==
After developing structured analysis techniques of the 1970s, and object-oriented analysis/design in the late 1980s and 1990s, in the new millennium Yourdon specialized in project management, software engineering methodologies, and Web 2.0 development. He also founded and published American Programmer magazine (now titled &quot;Cutter IT Journal&quot;). He is the author of the book &quot;Decline and Fall of the American Programmer&quot;.

=== Yourdon Inc. ===
In 1974, Yourdon founded the consulting firm Yourdon Inc. in New York, which provided consulting, educational and publishing in the field of software engineering. In the early 1980s, the company had multiple offices in North America and Europe and a staff of 150 people. They trained over 250,000 people in the topics of structured programming, structured design, structured analysis, logical data modeling and project management.

In 1986, Yourdon sold the consulting company. It later became part of the Canadian (Québec) software company CGI Informatique. The publishing division had published over 150 books on software engineering topics before it became part of Prentice Hall.

=== Yourdon structured method ===
In the 1980s Yourdon developed the Yourdon structured method (YSM) in SSADM based on the functional structuring. The method supports two distinct design phases: analysis and design. YSM includes three discrete steps: the feasibility study; essential modeling; and implementation modeling. It offers a series of models:
* The behavioral model: states that system behavior can be described in three ways: functions, dynamics and relationships. 
* The processor environment model (PEM): describes the allocation of computing functions in processor hardware.
* The software environment model (SEM): defines the software architecture and its effects from each processor.
* The code organizational model (COM): shows the modular structure of each task

The Yourdon structured method (YSM) and structured analysis and design technique (SADT) are examples of structured design methods.

=== Year 2000 (Y2K) problem ===
During the late 1990s, he was one of the leading proponents of the theory that the &#x27;Y2K bug&#x27; could lead to a collapse of civilization, or at least protracted economic depression and technological breakdown on a wide scale. He wrote several books on the subject, including &quot;Time Bomb 2000&quot; (), and produced at least one video putting forth that theory (and offering advice on how to survive the coming crisis). Yourdon was criticized by some when his predictions (vigorously refuted by some experts in advance) failed to materialize at the scale predicted. This may have caused him to lose credibility with some in the software industry.

== Final years and death ==
In his final years, Yourdon served as an internationally recognized expert witness and computer consultant specializing in project management, software engineering methodologies, and Web 2.0 development. He died on January 20, 2016, as a result of a post-surgical blood infection.

== Personal life ==

Yourdon was married to Toni Nash. He had three children; daughter Jennifer, and sons Jamie and David. He also had five grandchildren; Liam Christopher, Owen Edward, Edward Roland (&quot;Teddy&quot;), Elliot (&quot;Ellie&quot;) Ann, and Khalil Slice. Yourdon had five sisters; Toni, Teri, Tina, Aleda, and Patrice.

Yourdon was also an avid photographer whose photos were published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Fast Company&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;/CNN, &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, &quot;New York magazine&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot;, and the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;.

<text>Henry Alleyne Nicholson FRS FRSE FGS FLS (11 September 1844 – 19 January 1899) was a British palaeontologist and zoologist.

==Life==
The son of John Nicholson (1809–1886), a biblical scholar, and his wife Annie Elizabeth Waring, he was born at Penrith, Cumberland on 11 September 1844. His younger sister was the writer Annie Elizabeth Nicholson Ireland, and one of his brothers was John Henry Nicholson, author and poet. He was educated at Appleby Grammar School and then studied Sciences at the universities of Göttingen (Ph.D., 1866) and Edinburgh (D.Sc., 1867; M.D., 1869). Geology had early attracted his attention, and his first publication was a thesis for his D.Sc. degree titled &quot;On the Geology of Cumberland and Westmoreland&quot; (1868).

In 1869 he began lecturing in Natural History at the extramural classes linked to Edinburgh University.

In 1871 he was appointed professor of natural history in the University of Toronto; in 1874 professor of biology in the Durham College of Science and in 1875 professor of natural history in the University of St. Andrews. This last post he held until 1882, when he became Regius Professor of natural history in the University of Aberdeen.

In 1870 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Peter Handyside. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1897.

His original work was mainly on fossil invertebrata (graptolites, stromatoporoids and corals); but he did much field work, especially in the Lake District, where he labored in company with Robert Harkness and afterwards with John Edward Marr. He was awarded the Lyell Medal by the Geological Society in 1888.

In 1898 he promoted Alfred William Gibb as the first Professor of Geology at Aberdeen University. Nicholson retired in 1899.

He died at Aberdeen on 19 January 1899.

==Publications==
During his career he published 167 papers, usually as the sole author, and 12 textbooks, most importantly &quot;The Ancient Life History of the Earth&quot;.

* &quot;Ancient Life-History of the Earth&quot; (1877).
* &quot;Manual of Zoology&quot; (of which there were 7 editions) and other text-books of Zoology.
*&quot;Manual of Palaeontology&quot; (1872, 3rd ed, 2 vols., with Richard Lydekker, 1889).
*&quot;Monograph of the Silurian Fossils of the Girvan District in Ayrshire&quot; (with R. Etheridge, jun.) (1878–1880).
*&quot;Monograph of the British Stromatoporoids&quot; in Palaeontograph. Soc. (1886–1892).
* &quot;&quot; (1894)

<doc id="1250286" wikidata="Q423922" url="?curid=1250286" title="Pentachlorophenol">
<text>Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is an organochlorine compound used as a pesticide and a disinfectant. First produced in the 1930s, it is marketed under many trade names. It can be found as pure PCP, or as the sodium salt of PCP, the latter of which dissolves easily in water. It can be biodegraded by some bacteria, including &quot;Sphingobium chlorophenolicum&quot;.

==Uses==
PCP has been used as a herbicide, insecticide, fungicide, algaecide, and disinfectant and as an ingredient in antifouling paint. Some applications were in agricultural seeds (for nonfood uses), leather, masonry, wood preservation, cooling-tower water, rope, and paper. It has previously been used in the manufacture of food packaging materials. Its use has declined due to its high toxicity and slow biodegradation.

Two general methods are used for preserving wood. The pressure process method involves placing wood in a pressure-treating vessel, where it is immersed in PCP and then subjected to applied pressure. In the nonpressure process method, PCP is applied by spraying, brushing, dipping, or soaking.

Pentachlorophenol esters can be used as active esters in peptide synthesis, much like more popular pentafluorophenyl esters.

==Exposure==
People may be exposed to PCP in occupational settings through the inhalation of contaminated workplace air and dermal contact with wood products treated with PCP. Also, general population exposure may occur through contact with contaminated environment media, particularly in the vicinity of wood-treatment facilities and hazardous-waste sites. In addition, some other important routes of exposure seem to be the inhalation of contaminated air, ingestion of contaminated ground water used as a source of drinking water, ingestion of contaminated food, and dermal contact with soils or products treated with the chemical.

==Toxicity==
Short-term exposure to large amounts of PCP can cause harmful effects on the liver, kidneys, blood, lungs, nervous system, immune system, and gastrointestinal tract. Elevated temperature, profuse sweating, uncoordinated movement, muscle twitching, and coma are additional side effects.

Contact with PCP (particularly in the form of vapor) can irritate the skin, eyes, and mouth. Long-term exposure to low levels, such as those that occur in the workplace, can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, blood, and nervous system. Finally, exposure to PCP is also associated with carcinogenic, renal, and neurological effects. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency toxicity class classifies PCP in group B2 (probable human carcinogen).

===Monitoring of human exposure===
Pentachlorophenol may be measured in plasma or urine as an index of excessive exposure. This is usually performed by gas chromatography with electron-capture or mass-spectrometric detection. Since urine contains predominantly conjugated PCP in chronic exposure situations, prior hydrolysis of specimens is recommended. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure to PCP are 5 mg/L in an end-of-shift plasma specimen and 2 mg/g creatinine in an end-of-shift urine specimen.

==Absorption in humans and animals==
PCP is quickly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract following ingestion. Accumulation is not common, but if it does occur, the major sites are the liver, kidneys, plasma protein, spleen, and fat. Unless kidney and liver functions are impaired, PCP is quickly eliminated from tissues and blood, and is excreted, mainly unchanged or in conjugated form, via the urine. Single doses of PCP have half-lives in blood of 30 to 50 hours in humans. Biomagnification of PCP in the food chain is not thought to be significant due to the fairly rapid metabolism of the compound by exposed organisms.

==Releases to the environment==
PCP has been detected in surface waters and sediments, rainwater, drinking water, aquatic organisms, soil, and food, as well as in human milk, adipose tissue, and urine. As PCP is generally used for its properties as a biocidal agent, considerable concern exists about adverse ecosystem effects in areas of PCP contamination.

Releases to the environment are decreasing as a result of declining consumption and changing use methods. However, PCP is still released to surface waters from the atmosphere by wet deposition, from soil by run off and leaching, and from manufacturing and processing facilities. PCP is released directly into the atmosphere via volatilization from treated wood products and during production. Finally, releases to the soil can be by leaching from treated wood products, atmospheric deposition in precipitation (such as rain and snow), spills at industrial facilities, and at hazardous waste sites.

After PCP is released into the atmosphere, it decomposes through photolysis. The main biodegradative pathway for PCP is reductive dehalogenation. In this process, the compound PCP is broken down to tetrachlorophenols, trichlorophenols, and dichlorophenols. Another pathway is methylation to pentachloroanisole (a more lipid-soluble compound). These two methods eventually lead to ring cleavage and complete degradation.

In shallow waters, PCP is also quickly removed by photolysis. In deep or turbid water processes, sorption and biodegradation take place.
In reductive soil and sediments, PCP can be degraded within 14 days to 5 years, depending on the anaerobic soil bacteria that are present. However, adsorption of PCP in soils is pH dependent because it increases under acidic conditions and decreases in neutral and basic conditions.

==Synthesis==
PCP can be produced by the chlorination of phenol in the presence of catalyst (anhydrous aluminium or ferric chloride) and a temperature up to about 191 °C. This process does not result in complete chlorination and commercial PCP is only 84–90% pure. The main contaminants include other polychlorinated phenols, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans. Some of these species are even more toxic than the PCP itself.

==Pentachlorophenol by country==

Pentachlorophenol is classified as a persistent organic pollutant (POP). In May 2015, countries which have signed the Stockholm Convention voted 90–2 to ban pentachlorophenol use. The United States is not a signatory and has not banned the chemical.

===New Zealand===
PCP was used in New Zealand as a timber preservative and antisapstain treatment, but since 1988 is no longer used.

It was also sold as a moss killer to the general public (by Shell, at least) in the form of a 115g/L aqueous solution and labelled as a poison.

===United States===
Since the early 1980s, the purchase and use of PCP in the U.S. has not been available to the general public. Nowadays, most of the PCP used in the U.S. is restricted to the treatment of utility poles and railroad ties. In the United States, any drinking-water supply with a PCP concentration exceeding the MCL, 1 ppb, must be notified by the water supplier to the public. Disposal of PCP and PCP-contaminated substances are regulated under RCRA as F-listed (F021) or D-listed (D037) hazardous wastes. Bridges and similar structures such as piers can still be treated with pentachlorophenol.

===Chile===
PCP was widely used in Chile until the early 1990s as a fungicide to combat the so-called &quot;blue stain&quot; in pine timber under the name of Basilit.

<text>Eliane Ducos (born 23 April 1941), known professionally as Jacqueline Boyer (), is a French singer and actress. She is also the daughter of performers Jacques Pills and Lucienne Boyer.

In 1960, she won the Eurovision Song Contest for France singing &quot;Tom Pillibi&quot;, with music composed by André Popp and lyrics by Pierre Cour. The resulting single reached #33 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1960. At 18 years and 341 days of age at the time of her victory, Boyer was the first teenager to win the contest and the youngest until 1964. Following the death of Lys Assia in 2018, Boyer as of 2024, 64 years after her victory, is the longest surviving winning singer of the Eurovision Song Contest (although not the oldest by age).

<text>Sean Thornton (born 18 May 1983) is an Irish former professional footballer. He made 11 appearances in the Premier League for Sunderland in the 2002–03 season and has made over 200 appearances in the Football League, mostly for Sunderland, Doncaster Rovers and Leyton Orient.

==Club career==
===Tranmere Rovers===
Thornton began his career with Football League Second Division club Tranmere Rovers in 2001, for whom he made 13 appearances in the 2001–02 season,&lt;ref name=&quot;Games played by Sean Thornton in 2001/2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; scoring once against Wigan Athletic. He was out of contract in summer 2002 and joined Premier League side Sunderland in July 2002, for a fee of £225,000 agreed at tribunal, amid allegations by Tranmere that Sunderland had breached FA and Football League regulations by making an illegal approach for Thornton, for which Sunderland were later fined £1,500.

===Sunderland===
Thornton did not feature in the Sunderland first team at the beginning of the 2002–03 season and joined Blackpool on a one-month loan in November 2002. He made his debut for Sunderland in a FA Cup third-round replay win over Bolton Wanderers in January 2003, impressing manager Howard Wilkinson who said, &quot;That was the first full game I&#x27;ve seen Sean in and I must say it was a very promising and mature performance. He&#x27;s certainly a player we want to keep an eye on and bring on but it&#x27;s now up to him to show he can produce that standard consistently.&quot; He made 14 appearances for Sunderland in the 2002–03 season,&lt;ref name=&quot;Games played by Sean Thornton in 2002/2003&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; despite missing part of the season after being called up for the Ireland Under-20 squad for the World Youth Championships in the United Arab Emirates in March 2003. In April 2003, he scored with an impressive volley to give Sunderland an early lead against Chelsea although Sunderland went on to lose the match. He was unable to help Sunderland from being relegated at the end of the season. All 11 of his Premier League appearances that season ended in defeat, giving him the record for worst season that was broken 13 years later by Aston Villa&#x27;s Jack Grealish.

Thornton made 13 appearances for Sunderland at the start of the 2003–04 season,&lt;ref name=&quot;Games played by Sean Thornton in 2003/2004&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; before suffering an ankle injury in a reserve team game in October 2003. He returned to the side in January 2004 and made a further 17 appearances, helping Sunderland to the semifinal of the FA Cup, and the Division One playoff semifinal. Thornton was unable to command a regular first team place at the start of the 2004–05 season and by September 2004, was seeking a move away from the club. A transfer did not materialise and with his first team chances limited, he made only 20 appearances for Sunderland in the 2004–05 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Games played by Sean Thornton in 2004/2005&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, he was transfer listed.

===Doncaster Rovers===
Following Sunderland&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League in May 2005, Thornton was sold to Football League One club Doncaster Rovers in July 2005 for a club record fee of £175,000. He made 36 appearances for Doncaster in the 2005–06 season,&lt;ref name=&quot;Games played by Sean Thornton in 2005/2006&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; missing several weeks owing to an ankle injury suffered in September 2005 that needed surgery. He helped Doncaster reach the quarterfinals of the Football League Cup, putting in a fine performance and scoring the third goal when Doncaster beat Premier League club, Aston Villa 3–0 in November 2005. Manager Dave Penney praised Thornton, saying: &quot;It was a great goal for Sean and he&#x27;s looking much brighter and sharper these days, and long may that continue.&quot; After the game, Thornton said that he felt had made the right move in the summer, saying &quot;It was a gamble for me. I still had two years left on my contract at Sunderland. It was one of them – would I go, would I not go? Obviously we&#x27;re playing good football and I think I made the right decision. Now, hopefully, we can carry on the success until the end of the season and get promoted. That&#x27;s the main thing.&quot; In the 2006–07 season, Thornton made 41 appearances,&lt;ref name=&quot;Games played by Sean Thornton in 2006/2007&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and helped Doncaster to victory over Bristol Rovers in the Football League Trophy final in April 2007 when he swung in a corner kick for Graeme Lee to head in to score the extra time winner at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.

===Leyton Orient===
Thornton was released by Doncaster manager, Sean O&#x27;Driscoll at the end of the 2006–07 season, and joined another League One side, Leyton Orient in July 2007 on a two-year contract. Orient manager Martin Ling said that he was &quot;... pleased to have Sean on board. We&#x27;ve been looking for a creative midfielder and Sean fits the bill perfectly. He will fit into our style of play and I believe we have signed a quality player.&quot; He scored on his debut against Southend United in August 2007, with a spectacular free kick from 30 yards in a 2–1 away win, and went on to make 34 appearances in the 2007–08 season,&lt;ref name=&quot;Games played by Sean Thornton in 2007/2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; although he missed four matches after being sent off in October 2007 for allegedly punching another player. The following season, he joined Shrewsbury Town in September 2008 on a one-month loan, where he scored once against Darlington. On his return to Orient, he regained his place in the first team under new manager Geraint Williams and made a total of 34 appearances for Orient in the 2008–09 season in addition to his loan spell at Shrewsbury Town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Games played by Sean Thornton in 2008/2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a new one-year contract with Orient in June 2009, with the option of a further year, but was released by Williams&#x27; replacement Russell Slade on 9 May 2010 after putting on too much weight.

Sean Thornton became something of a cult hero at Orient, leading to local folk-punk artist Steve White recording and releasing a song in praise of Thornton.

===Aberystwyth Town===
After false reports that he had signed for FC Metalist Kharkiv, Thornton signed for Aberystwyth Town on a short-term contract on 13 September 2011, in a move that was described by the club as &#x27;arguably the biggest signing in Welsh Premier League history&#x27;. The midfielder scored his first goal in Aber colours on 11 November 2011, as the Seasiders hammered Port Talbot Town 4–0 at the Genquip Stadium. On 16 November 2011, it was announced that Thornton had agreed to extend his stay with Aberystwyth Town until the end of the 2011/12 Welsh Premier League campaign.
He scored his second goal for the club in the 1–1 draw with Afan Lido.
He was signed for another season (2012–13) at Aberystwyth Town.

===Bala Town===
On 3 January 2014, Thornton agreed to join Welsh Premier League side Bala Town. He was handed the number nine shirt.

===Drogheda United===
On 4 January 2015 Sean agreed to sign for hometown club Drogheda United in what would be his first experience of playing in the League of Ireland. Thornton signed along with former Athlone Town player Sean Brennan. Thornton made his debut against Bray Wanderers in a 1–0 away win. In his next game Thornton set up the winner with a free kick in a 3–2 win against Sligo Rovers.

On 26 November Thornton re-signed with the club on a year deal.

===Rathmullen Celtic FC===

Upon seeing his contract out with Drogheda United Thornton was recruited by newly-formed Non League side Rathmullen Celtic who play in Division 3 of the NEFL. Under the guidance of Chairman Robbie McDonnell and manager Stewie Barnett Thornton masterminded promotion to Div 2 for Rathmullen after reproducing arguably some of the best form of his career. Scoring 28 goals and assisting 14 in an advanced midfield role .
However Thornton never got to play Division 2 football with Rathmullen after a pre season of upheaval seen the club go into administration before the new season began.

===Athboy Celtic===

With Rathmullen folding Thornton became a free agent. He received an offer from Athboy Celtic. The Meath club were playing in Division 1. With Thornton they finished outside the automatic promotion places and remained in division 1.

===Newfoundwell FC===

After one season at Athboy which resulted in a failed promotion attempt, Thornton followed manager Derek Kavanagh to the premier league of the NEFL and to 2017 treble winners Newfoundwell FC. The stay at the Well was short, as after failing to field a team in 2 separate matches the club were disqualified from the league and effectively disbanded in May 2019.

===Moneymore FC===

<doc id="1250306" wikidata="Q407147" url="?curid=1250306" title="Air Force Materiel Command">
<text>The Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) is a Major Command (MAJCOM) of the United States Air Force (USAF). AFMC was created on July 1, 1992, through the amalgamation of the former Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) and the former Air Force Systems Command (AFSC).

AFMC is headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. AFMC is one of nine Air Force Major Commands and has a workforce of approximately 80,000 military and civilian personnel. It is the Air Force&#x27;s largest command in terms of funding and second in terms of personnel. AFMC&#x27;s operating budget represents 31 percent of the total Air Force budget and AFMC employs more than 40 percent of the Air Force&#x27;s total civilian workforce.

The command conducts research, development, testing and evaluation, and provides the acquisition and life cycle management services and logistics support. The command develops, acquires and sustains the air power needed to defend the United States and its interests. This is accomplished through research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, maintenance and program management of existing and future USAF weapon systems and their components.

== History ==
The United States Armed Forces procurement of military aircraft began when the United States Army&#x27;s Aeronautical Division of the Signal Corps (United States Army), acquired several examples of the Wright Military Flyer of 1909. USAAF/USAF aircraft Research and Development (R&amp;D) was merged with aircraft procurement twice in the 20th century (e.g., 1944, 1992).

Air Materiel Command was established on March 9, 1946, and in November 1946, AMC&#x27;s History Office published &quot;Materiel Research and Development in the Army Air Arm, 1914-1945&quot;. In 1947, AMC bases were transferred to the newly established United States Air Force, with facilities such as the storage depot in Maywood, California, being renamed Cheli Air Force Station.

On April 1, 1961, as part of the DoD reorganization under President John F. Kennedy and his Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, the Air Force Logistics Command was established at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, replacing the Air Materiel Command and assuming the latter&#x27;s supply and maintenance roles. The material procurement role was transferred. On the same date, Air Force Systems Command was also established at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, assuming the R&amp;D role of the former Air Research and Development Command while also inheriting AMC&#x27;s materiel procurement role.

===Activation duties AFMC, 1992 ===
Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) was activated on July 1, 1992, as part of a post-Cold War, USAF-wide reorganization that resulted in the merger of AFLC and AFSC into a single major command.

After AFMC was established, the command&#x27;s infrastructure saw significant reductions through Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions. This included the BRAC-directed closure/privatization of the San Antonio Air Logistics Center at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas and the closure of Kelly Air Force Base as an independent installation, with incorporation of its runways and remaining military flight line areas as the Kelly Field Annex to adjacent Lackland Air Force Base.

The Sacramento Air Logistics Center at McClellan Air Force Base was also closed/privatized and McClellan Air Force Base totally closed. McClellan became a totally civilian airport with the exception of Coast Guard Air Station Sacramento and the Air Force Recruiting Service&#x27;s 364th Recruiting Squadron.

=== Reorganization ===
In 2012 there was a major reorganization (5 Center Construct) and several new centers were organized. Among them, the Air Force Sustainment Center at Tinker Air Force Base now directs the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex at Tinker Air Force Base, the Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill Air Force Base, and the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex at Robins Air Force Base. The center provides depot maintenance, supply chain management and installation support. In 2015, the command officially activated its sixth center, the Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center, which provides centralized management of installation and mission support. The center is located at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas.

== Mission ==
Air Force Materiel Command conducts research, development, test and evaluation, and provides acquisition management services and logistics support.

AFMC headquarters is the major unit located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. There are also nine additional AFMC host bases.

In addition, the command operates associate units and tenant activities on several non-AFMC bases, including the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.

<doc id="1250315" wikidata="Q7242653" url="?curid=1250315" title="Priceline.com">
<text>Priceline.com is an online travel agency for finding discount rates for travel-related purchases such as airline tickets and hotel stays. The company facilitates the provision of travel services from its suppliers to its clients. Priceline.com is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, United States and is wholly owned by Booking Holdings, which also owns Kayak.com, Booking.com and other sites. The company was founded in 1997. It operates in more than 200 countries and territories around the world and has partnerships with over 400 airlines and 300,000 hotels. Users can search for travel deals and discounts on the website, and in the past also offered the &quot;Name Your Own Price&quot; feature to bid on hotel rooms and flights.

==History==
Priceline was founded by Jay S. Walker, who left the company in 2000, by which time Richard S. Braddock, Citicorp&#x27;s #2, had come aboard as chief executive. Braddock left in 2004, having helped take the company public in 1999.

Entrepreneur Michael Loeb assisted in the &quot;creation and early funding&quot;.

Priceline first became known for its &quot;Name Your Own Price&quot; system, where travelers would name their price for airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, and vacation packages. While the purchaser can select a general location, service level, and price. The sales are for opaque travel inventory; details are disclosed only after the transaction is complete with no possibility of cancellation.

Priceline&#x27;s profit from the proceeds is the difference between the price suggested by a customer and the one charged by the service provider. It has also added a more traditional model, called Express Deals, where travelers have presented prices and a geographical perimeter within which the hotel will be located but are not told the name of the establishment.

Priceline offers a tool named Pricebreakers for Hotel bookings. It claims that the price of the hotels are up to 50% off retail. It is somewhat similar to Express Deal but instead of showing the geographical location within a perimeter, it provides the names of 3 hotels, and one of the hotels will be allocated after the payment is done.

Travelers can still choose to name their price for airline tickets, hotel rooms, and rental cars. The number of airlines, hotels and car rental company participants in the name your own price program has increased as these suppliers utilize this opaque market Priceline created to sell their perishable inventory without lowering prices through other traditional sales channels. Priceline also sells discounted cruises, as well as tours and attractions.

In 2002, Priceline licensed its &quot;Name Your Own Price&quot; travel system to eBay.

In November 2007, Priceline “permanently” eliminated all booking fees on published airfares.

In April 2014, Priceline.com Incorporated changed its name to &quot;The Priceline Group Inc.&quot; The corporate name change was intended to create a clear delineation between the global Priceline business. Now, Priceline.com is one of six primary brands of Booking Holdings.

Priceline announced in May 2015 that it would invest an additional $250 million in Chinese online travel company Ctrip to tap the fast-growing China market.

Priceline officially ended its &quot;Name Your Own Price&quot; deals for flight bookings in 2016, rental cars in 2018 and hotels in 2020.

===Other services===
Priceline.com experimented with selling gasoline and groceries under the &quot;Name Your Own Price&quot; model in 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, through a partially owned affiliate, WebHouse Club.

Priceline got into the online auction business with &quot;Priceline Yard Sales&quot;, where individuals would use the Priceline system to haggle for various second-hand items and trade them in person.

Priceline sold long distance telephone service and automobiles under the &quot;Name Your Own Price&quot; model.

These experiments were terminated in 2002.

Another experiment, the &quot;Name Your Own Rate&quot; system for home loans, continues under a license with EverBank.

In 2016, Brett Keller was named CEO of the priceline.com brand.

==Spokespeople==

===William Shatner===
In 1997, William Shatner became the spokesman for Priceline.com, agreeing to do the spots in exchange for stock in the company. Shatner allegedly sold the stock before the burst of the dot-com bubble, making a $600 million profit; however, this number was disputed as an urban legend by CEO Jeffery Boyd. An early ad campaign featuring Shatner had him belt out popular songs in spoken word, in the style of his album, &quot;The Transformed Man&quot;. He was &quot;replaced&quot; in 2004 by his &quot;Star Trek&quot; co-star, Leonard Nimoy. Shatner still appeared in spots for Priceline, running into Nimoy as his replacement. When that campaign ended, Shatner again became Priceline&#x27;s sole spokesperson.

In 2007, an ad campaign by Butler, Shine, Stern &amp; Partners had Shatner take on the role of the Priceline Negotiator. In commercials that began airing January 22, 2012, Shatner&#x27;s Negotiator character apparently dies as a bus falls off a bridge and explodes. Subsequent ads have featured his &quot;spirit,&quot; still advertising Priceline.com from beyond the grave. In August 2012, Shatner was brought back in a commercial located on a stormy, cloudy beach, parodying the end of the film &quot;Point Break&quot;. A man, apparently an investigator, stands next to Shatner. Shatner is holding a wooden surfboard, wearing a suit with shortened pants and pitching the new way of booking a hotel. He states that surfing is his life now and &quot;we&#x27;ll see where the waves take me. Sayonara!&quot; and goes charging into the waves.

Priceline has been parodied on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and in multiple &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skits. In a September 2008 &quot;SNL&quot; skit, during the opening monologue by Olympian Michael Phelps, Shatner rose from the audience to give Phelps tips on product endorsements.

===Theresa Caputo===
In June 2012, Theresa Caputo, star of the television show &quot;Long Island Medium,&quot; appeared in a commercial for Priceline.com, in which she portrayed herself &quot;connecting&quot; with the late Priceline Negotiator character previously played by William Shatner. However, this commercial has sparked controversy, since the commercial appears to make light of the Native American belief of smudging.

JREF President DJ Grothe released an open letter calling out Priceline.com for endorsing Caputo, stating, &quot;It is difficult to watch the show and not feel heartbroken for those who are desperate to hear from the departed... and even more so if they are being manipulated by a charlatan.&quot; Grothe urges Priceline.com to &quot;invite... your new representative&quot; to take the James Randi One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge and prove her credentials.

===Kaley Cuoco===
In January 2013, Kaley Cuoco from the sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; joined William Shatner as his fictitious daughter in Priceline.com commercials.

==Criticisms==
Priceline does not include resort fee amounts in the bidding. Therefore, it&#x27;s possible to win a bid for a hotel and then be forced to pay mandatory resort fees (for example, often $25 per night for resort hotels in Las Vegas). Priceline continues this practice despite a 2012 warning to the industry from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC continues to state the following regarding how hotels and third parties should disclose such fees:

Priceline was one of the companies accused in 2013 of using the services of Wiki-PR, a public relations firm specialized in editing of Wikipedia that has been accused of subverting Wikipedia content for business interest.

<doc id="1250320" wikidata="Q2007696" url="?curid=1250320" title="Stephen Wright (English footballer)">
<text>Stephen John Wright (born 8 February 1980) is an English former footballer who works for Liverpool Academy as a Coach.

==Club career==

===Liverpool===
Born in Bootle, Liverpool, Wright joined Liverpool on a youth contract in June 1996, choosing to join Liverpool over rivals Everton, the club he supported as a boy. Wright turned professional a year later in August 1997, and the following season was named as an unused substitute for the UEFA Cup clash with Celta Vigo on 24 November 1998 alongside Steven Gerrard.

Following two successful loan spells with Crewe Alexandra in the 1999–2000 season, Wright made his Liverpool debut in the 8–0 drubbing of Stoke City on 29 November 2000 in the League Cup, replacing Markus Babbel at half time. He went on to play 4 times that season for Liverpool, including a brief substitute appearance against future club Sunderland at the Stadium of Light in February 2001. He was also an unused substitute as Liverpool won the 2001 UEFA Cup final.

Initially starting out as a centre back, Wright made the transition to right back during the 2001–02 season, where he established himself as a useful member of the Liverpool squad. On 27 October 2001, Wright saw red for the first time in his career, after being sent off against Charlton Athletic at The Valley. Wright scored his first goal for the club 3 days later in the UEFA Champions League against Borussia Dortmund. The game ended 2–0 to Liverpool. Wright eventually went on to make 21 first team appearances for Liverpool, while scoring only the one goal.

===Sunderland===
After finding first team opportunities increasingly difficult to come by, Wright joined Sunderland in a £1.5m deal, which would eventually rise to £3m. Wright was handed the number 2 shirt and made first choice right back, replacing Bernt Haas, who had moved on loan to FC Basle. Wright&#x27;s tough and uncompromising style made him initially popular with the Sunderland faithful, however, a drastic loss of form, combined with Sunderland&#x27;s dreadful form in the league saw him criticised towards the end of the season. Sunderland were eventually relegated with a record low of 19 points, in a season that saw manager Peter Reid sacked just weeks after signing Wright, and his replacement, Howard Wilkinson, sacked 5 months into his role.

Wilkinson was replaced by former Republic of Ireland manager Mick McCarthy, who often alternated between Wright and teammate Darren Williams for the right back slot during the 2003–04 season. With the club performing well in the league, Wright&#x27;s confidence grew as a player, and he soon won over his critics with a series of solid displays. Wright scored his first goal for the club on 25 August 2003 against Watford at the Stadium of Light.

Unfortunately for Wright, Sunderland were beaten in the play-offs by Crystal Palace, crushing any hope of a swift return to the Premier League. During the summer, McCarthy strengthened the squad by signing Manchester United right back Mark Lynch, though Wright remained first choice. After a poor start, Sunderland eventually won the league comfortably, with Wright playing a major role and earning himself the respect of the supporters that had once criticised him. As a measure of his popularity, Wright was one of the front-runners for the annual Player of the Year award, eventually finishing in 4th place.

With Sunderland returning to the Premier League, Wright was expected to resume his role at right back, however, a serious knee injury put Wright on the shelf for 6 months, just one game into the season. Upon returning to fitness, Wright was sent off for two bookable offences on his comeback game against West Ham United on 4 February 2006 and later picked up an ankle injury in training that required surgery. This effectively ended Wright&#x27;s season after just two appearances, as Sunderland crashed out with another record low points tally.

With McCarthy dismissed towards the end of the 2005–06 season, new chairman and former teammate Niall Quinn agreed to take the reins, however, decided to leave Wright out of the opening games of the 2006–07 season, instead preferring midfielder Rory Delap for the role. Wright made his first appearance for 7 months in the 3–2 defeat to Plymouth on 12 August 2006, however, picked up another injury in the defeat to Bury two games later, and battled with Nyron Nosworthy and on-loan defender Danny Simpson to regain his position after resuming training with the first team.

===Stoke City===
On 3 August 2007, it was announced that Wright had joined Stoke City on a 5-month loan deal. However his time at Stoke was overshadowed by injuries and therefore made only 17 appearances before being sent back to Sunderland in January 2008.

===Back to Sunderland===
His loan spell with Stoke ended in January 2008. He returned to Sunderland in January hoping to get back in the starting XI but failed to do so. Wright was released by Sunderland at the end of the 2007–08 season.

===Coventry City ===
Over the course of the summer of 2008, several clubs, including Hull City, expressed an interest in signing Wright. He spent pre-season training on trial with Coventry City, playing an active part in their pre-season fixtures. After an extended period of negotiations, Wright signed a two-year contract with Coventry on 8 August 2008, the day before the first game of the season. On 14 July 2009, Wright was appointed as Coventry captain by manager Chris Coleman. At the end of the 2009–10 Coventry City told Wright he was surplus to requirements and he was subsequently released.

===Later career===
Following his release from Coventry Wright joined Brentford on trial and appeared in a reserves match against Leyton Orient. He signed a contract on 29 October 2010.

In August 2011 he was training with Hartlepool United, and featured in a reserve team game away at Gateshead. He subsequently signed a short-term deal with Hartlepool, making his debut in a 2–0 victory over Exeter City. After playing eleven matches for Hartlepool, Wright left the club in January 2012.

On 2 March 2012 he signed a deal at Wrexham until the end of the season. His debut for the club came the following day against Kettering. He scored his first goal for Wrexham against Hereford United on 10 November 2012. On 24 March 2013 Wright picked up his third honour in football with the North Wales club by winning the FA Trophy at Wembley Stadium, they beat Grimsby Town 4–1 on penalties.

On 5 September 2014 Wright joined Welsh Premier League side Aberystwyth Town where he spent a season, before joining Rhyl. He dropped down to the Cymru Alliance in 2016 signing for Denbigh Town. Wright left the club in 2017 and officially retired from playing. He took up a coaching position at the Wrexham AFC Centre of Excellence before leaving in 2019 to join Liverpool in a coaching position with their academy set-up where he still remains.

==International career==
He was capped for the England U-20 team at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship, with teammates Stuart Taylor, Ashley Cole, Peter Crouch, Andy Johnson, Matthew Etherington, etc. But the team finished bottom at the group stage, after three defeats.

==Personal life==
Wright&#x27;s father, John Wright, was a kitman at former club Liverpool.

In 2006, Wright became an investor in &quot;Golf Punk&quot; magazine, alongside former Sunderland teammates Phil Babb, Michael Gray, Jason McAteer, and Thomas Sørensen, saving the publication from closure.

<doc id="1250330" wikidata="Q620990" url="?curid=1250330" title="Alexandrov Ensemble">
<text>The Alexandrov Ensemble (), commonly known as the Red Army Choir in the West, is an official army choir of the Russian armed forces. Founded during the Soviet era, the ensemble consists of a male choir, an orchestra, and a dance ensemble.

The Ensemble has entertained audiences both in Russia and throughout the world, performing a range of music including folk tunes, hymns, operatic arias and popular music. The group&#x27;s repertoire has included &quot;The Volga Boatmen&#x27;s Song&quot;, &quot;Katyusha&quot;, &quot;Kalinka&quot;, and &quot;Ave Maria&quot;.

It is named for its first director, Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov (1883–1946). Its formal name since 1998 has been A. V. Alexandrov Academic Song and Dance Ensemble of the Russian Army (), shortened to &quot;Academic Ensemble&quot; () on second reference.

On 25 December 2016, its artistic director, Valery Khalilov, and 63 other members of the Ensemble were killed in the Russian Defence Ministry aircraft crash of a 1983 Tupolev Tu-154 into the Black Sea just after takeoff from the southern resort city of Sochi, Russia. The Red Army Choir singers and dancers were en route to Syria to entertain Russian troops there for Orthodox Christmas celebrations.

==Name==
At the establishment, in 1928, the choir was named Red Army Song Ensemble of the M. V. Frunze Red Army Central House (). In 1935, it was renamed Red-Bannered Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble of the USSR ().

In 1949 the ensemble was officially named the A. V. Alexandrov Twice Red-bannered and Red-starred Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army (Дважды Краснознамённый ордена Красной Звезды ансамбль песни и пляски Советской Армии имени А. В. Александрова ). In 1978 the word &quot;academic&quot; was added to the title (&quot;A. V. Alexandrov Twice Red-bannered and Red-starred Academic Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army&quot;). After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the ensemble received its present name in 1998.

== History ==
===Early years ===

Born into a peasant family, Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov became the first artistic director of the ensemble, choirmaster, conductor, teacher and the public figure who wrote the music to the State Anthem of the Soviet Union. He came from a musical background of hymns and folk songs, could play the viola and had perfect pitch, so he sang in the church choir and performed at festivals. He was heard singing at the village school by PA Zalivuhin, a soloist in the choir at Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg. Zalivuhin persuaded Alexandrov&#x27;s parents to let the child go to Saint Petersburg to learn music. In 1898, the young peasant boy became a pupil of the Saint Petersburg Court Chapel.
There are two recorded histories of the ensemble: possibly separate elements of the same history. The first says that the initiator of the ensemble was Felix Nikolaevich Danilovich, a theatre director. The first director of the ensemble was chosen from three of Moscow&#x27;s conductors: Danilin, Chesnokov and Alexandrov. Seen in isolation this would signify that A. V. Alexandrov was not the creator of the ensemble. In this version the first troupe is named as follows. Singers: Tkachenko, Zyukov, Samarin, Rozanov, Koltypin, Tolskov, Golyaev, Charov. Dancers: Maximov, Svetlov. Bayanist: Surdin.

The second version says that the ensemble was formed out of the Frunze Red Army Central House in 1928. There is also a story that Stalin then asked Alexandrov to relocate the choir to Moscow.

====Development====

During World War II, the ensemble gave over 1500 performances at both Soviet fronts, entertaining troops about to go into battle, at gun emplacements, airfields, and in hospitals.

===Under Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov===
Following the death of Alexander Alexandrov, the ensemble was taken over by his son, Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov. Under his leadership, the ensemble gained fame outside the Soviet Union, making extensive tours worldwide. Boris Alexandrov retired in 1987, and was succeeded by People&#x27;s Artist of Russia Igor Agafonnikov the same year, with Anatoly Maltsev as the ensemble chief. He retired as the principal conductor in 1994; he died that year and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

Under B. A. Alexandrov, the ensemble was highly disciplined. Boris&#x27;s party trick was to leave the stage and allow the ensemble to perform &quot;En Route&quot; alone. Members were positioned so that they could not all watch one orchestral leader, and this appeared to be a trick, but there was no trick at all. Leonid Kharitonov remembers: 
The Ensemble members were so disciplined and experienced that they could feel the rhythm simultaneously and could sing and play together automatically, without the conductor... In Canada during one concert Alexandrov left the Ensemble to perform alone for half an hour.
Major Vladimir Alexandrov (1910–1978), brother of Boris Alexandrov, also composed for the ensemble. He served as Orchestral Director and Conductor. Vladimir Gordeev was the principal conductor on the 1988 UK tour.

====1948 Berlin Peace Concert ====

In 1948 much of Berlin was still ruined after World War II, and the city was divided into four occupation zones, controlled by the USSR, France, the UK and the United States. This was before the Berlin Wall was built, and it was still possible to travel between zones. An American officer suggested a concert in the Gendarmenmarkt (in the Soviet zone at the time), and the French zone commander supported the suggestion. The musicians were to be provided by the USSR, and the Alexandrov Ensemble was chosen. A temporary stage was set up in the square, with flowers all along the front. 30,000 people came to stand and watch for three hours. In 1994, towards the end of his life, Boris Alexandrov said:

&quot;The visit to Germany was unforgettable. It is dominant in the history of the ensemble. It was necessary to make a new creative leap – from wartime military music to postwar relaxing harmony. It was important, and the transition had to be managed on many fronts, including getting the Ensemble back into its original pre-war role, performing the classics and singing folk songs. Before the war the Ensemble had 200 professional singers; following the war it was down to 60.&quot;

A previous tour to East Germany had been cancelled due to the sudden death of Alexander Alexandrov in 1946 in Potsdam, when in his bed was found an annotated copy of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9, showing that A. Alexandrov had been preparing the final chorus for a performance. Now Boris, his son, was ready to follow his father&#x27;s plan. The 1948 peace concert was to consist of German opera extracts and Russian folk songs (&quot;Nightingales&quot;, &quot;Zemlyanka&quot; and &quot;Roads&quot;); and after an intervention by the tenor Victor Nikitin, some German folk songs were also included. The people joined in, singing &quot;Heidenröslein&quot;, and Nikitin sang Kalinka three times in a row. The concert was very successful, and very moving.
 A sound recording of the concert was made, and pressed in 1985 under the Radio DDR 1 label. This is listed on the Alexandrov Ensemble discography page.

However the Berlin Peace Concert did not happen in isolation. It was part of a series of punishing yearly tours to war-torn areas. The main tour season during and just after World War II appears to have run from June to October – perhaps because the large troupe usually had to perform outdoors, to accommodate large audiences. The August 1948 Berlin concert occurred two-thirds of the way through a tour to (20 June to 18 July) Prague, Most, Brno, Bratislava, Ostrava, Žilina and Košice in Czechoslovakia; then apparently without a break (18 July to 10 October) Dresden, Weimar, Magdeburg, Stendal, Schwerin, Potsdam, Berlin, Rathenow, Leipzig, Halle, Lane, Erfurt, Chemnitz, Frankfurt an der Oder and Schwarzenberg in Germany.

=== After 1991===
Today, the ensemble is led by Honoured Artist of Russia Vyacheslav Korobko, who has been leading it since 2003.

Until 1969, the standard uniform for the ensemble choir, soloists and orchestra was the tunic and riding breeches. On 1 January 1970, this was changed to dress uniform, and there have been further variations to the dress uniform as used by the ensemble since 1970.

==== Eurovision Song Contest 2009 ====
The choir were the interval act in the first semi-final of Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, alongside t.A.T.u who performed &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot;.

==== 2016 plane crash ====

On 25 December 2016, a Russian Defence Ministry Tupolev Tu-154 carrying 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble Choir went down off the coast of Sochi, Russia while en route to Latakia, Syria for a Christmas celebration with the troops deployed at Khmeimim military base. The plane crashed with no survivors.

After 5 weeks, the choir was reformed anew in time for Defender of the Fatherland Day celebrations on 18 February 2017. That first concert in weeks marks also the birth of a new era for the Ensemble, with its first international tour following the crash with concerts not just in Russia but also in select European countries. Most of the new members joined through auditions held on 15 and 27 January 2017 by the Ministry of Defense of Russia. Since 7 June 2016, Colonel became artistic director then main conductor and Head of the Ensemble since 24 March 2017.

==== 2018 90th Anniversary ====
On 12 October 2018, the Ensemble celebrated the 90th anniversary of its foundation at a special event at the Bolshoi Theatre. Following this event, the leader of the Ensemble Colonel Gennadiy Sachenyuk announced a worldwide tour. The Ensemble performed concerts produced by Thierry Wolf in various countries including France, Switzerland, Belgium, Serbia, the Czech Republic and China. In December 2019, they celebrated Christmas in Montreal during a week of seven concerts at La Maison Symphonique.

==== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
Following the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the tour Alexandrov Ensemble was supposed to have in the Czech Republic has been canceled, while individual members of the choir have faced disqualifications from competitions such as Operalia.

== Composition ==

=== Chorus ===
Current members of the choir are listed here. 
The choir consists mainly of vocal sections of tenor, baritone, and bass. In some of the pieces they perform, these sections are divided into as many as eight different vocal lines. From the early 1950s until at least 1965 a typical full division (which varied from song to song) was as follows: (1) countertenors; (2) first tenors; (3) second tenors; (4) baritones; (5) first bass; (6) second bass; (7) basso profundos.

=== Orchestra ===

The orchestra, in what became a typical composition for later generations of military ensembles in the Soviet Union, has a mixed composition of Russian traditional instruments and western instruments, including the balalaika, the domra, the bayan, the double bass, woodwinds, brass, and percussion instruments. A great guest balalaika player was Boris Stepanovich Feoktistov (Борис Степанович Феоктистов) (1910–1988). In the West his most famous recording is &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; (1963).

A. Molostov is the trumpet soloist in &quot;Dark Eyes&quot; in vintage recordings.
The bayan-player Victor Gridin is a past member of the orchestra.

=== Dancers ===

Among the dances staged by the ensemble are &quot;Zaparozhtsi Dance&quot;, &quot;Cossack&#x27;s Cavalry Dance&quot;, &quot;Festive March&quot;, &quot;Dance of the Cossacks&quot;, &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Dance&quot;, and &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Dance&quot;. Some of these are performed by mixed dancers, while others, such as &quot;Cossack&#x27;s Cavalry Dance&quot;, are performed by male dancers only.
The ballet is under the direction of Lev Nikolaevich Kulikov National Artist of Russia, the main ballet master, and maintains the heights of choreographic art with honour. The priority in its repertoire is taken by the military compositions: &quot;Matroskaya barynya&quot;, &quot;Kazachiya cavalry plyaska&quot;, &quot;Festive march&quot;, &quot;Invitation to dance&quot; and others. The ballet performs a lot of Russian folk dances. The classical repertoire contains &quot;Poloveckie plyasky&quot; from the opera &quot;Prince Igor&quot; written by Alexander Borodin. This is from our dance classics, but we always update the dance repertoire.

== The repertoire==

In 2006 and 2007, in Moscow and in Vladikavkaz, Grozny, the ensemble performed a New Year fairy tale show for children, &quot;Ivan the Good, Ivan the Brave&quot;, about a soldier helping to save New Year&#x27;s Day.

In 2008, the 80th anniversary of the ensemble, director Leonid Malev said: 

Of course everything depends on the repertoire which is quite large – more than two thousand works. Depending on the concert we choose a special repertoire. We have a rule that we try not to break. In any country we sing 2–3 songs in the native language of the people who live there. As a rule it helps to find a rapport with, and the appreciation of, the audience. And for us it is some kind of musical gift, to honour the host country and its people. For instance in Canada when we sang the National Anthem of Russia people stood up to show respect to our country, and when we finished we sang their country&#x27;s anthem &quot;O Canada&quot;.

A million people in our country and abroad like songs like &quot;Kalinka&quot;, &quot;Katyusha&quot;, &quot;Smuglyanka&quot; and the other songs of the military years as well as &quot;The Day of the Victory&quot;, &quot;Dark Eyes&quot;, &quot;Vecherny zvon&quot; and &quot;Podmoskovnye vechera&quot;. All these songs are known because of the Alexandrov folk song and dance company and people want to hear these songs at every concert. They are not just part of our history; they are great masterpieces. It is interesting that &quot;Svyaschennaya Voyna&quot;, written by Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov in 1941, helped Soviet soldiers to protect their Motherland and is still popular in Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria. Those audiences listen to it standing up and it touches their hearts and souls.

For our concerts we search for new musical works because you can&#x27;t live only in the past. But to tell you the truth it&#x27;s impossible to imagine our concerts without works of Russian and West-European classical music (Beethoven, Bach, Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky), they are part of human history. But our repertoire contains not only songs of the military years and folk songs, arias from operas, songs of the world and spiritual music but also new songs such as Iliya Reznik&#x27;s &quot;To Serve Russia&quot;, and those written by Eduard Hanka, Kim Breytburg, Sergey Sashin and other modern composers and poets. 


== The Children&#x27;s Choir School ==
The Alexandrov children&#x27;s choir school was founded in 2007. Malev said about the school:
It&#x27;s not a secret that the more you work with children, the greater their prospect of achievement in society. We approached the Ministry of Defence with an appeal to organize this choir and it was approved. October 1st 2007 was the opening day of the Aleksandrovcy creative school for musical and aesthetic education for children. This became an important event in the year of the Ensemble&#x27;s 80th anniversary.
The first night of the boys&#x27; Aleksandrovcy Choir on December 26th at the Cadets&#x27; Gold Epaulette Ball went like clockwork. After that night they participated in many concerts. The latest was on Poklonnaya Hill in memory of the Beslan tragedy, as part of City Day on the 3rd and 7th of September. It should be mentioned that we have an excellent director of the school Nina Anatolievna Putilina who puts all her soul into raising this worthy generation.
We do a lot in order to raise the new generation with regard to physical, spiritual and moral health. Here children begin at the beginning of vocal music and literary speaking; they absorb the best practice of their teachers.
The children&#x27;s choir has become an integral part of the Ensemble&#x27;s life and takes part in its important concerts. We plan to have tours together.
== Films ==
The ensemble under the direction of Boris Alexandrov can be heard singing &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; in the 1981 film &quot;Das Boot&quot;. Members of the ensemble are seen performing &quot;The Internationale&quot; in New York&#x27;s Grand Central Station in Peter Miller&#x27;s 2000 documentary &quot;The Internationale&quot;. Several films have been made of the ensemble&#x27;s performances: see Alexandrov Ensemble discography.

== Awards for the ensemble ==

<text>The Hispano-Suiza 8 is a water-cooled V8 SOHC aero engine introduced by Hispano-Suiza in 1914 that went on to become the most commonly used liquid-cooled engine in the aircraft of the Entente Powers during the First World War. The original Hispano-Suiza 8A was rated at and the later, larger displacement Hispano-Suiza 8F reached .

Hispano-Suiza 8 engines and variants produced by Hispano-Suiza and other companies under licence were built in twenty-one factories in Spain, France, Britain, Italy, and the U.S. Derivatives of the engine were also used abroad to power numerous aircraft types and the engine can be considered as the ancestor of another successful engine by the same designer, the Hispano-Suiza 12Y (and Soviet Klimov V12 derivative aero-engines) which was in service during the Second World War.

==Design and development==

===Origins===
At the beginning of World War I, the production lines of the Barcelona based Hispano-Suiza automobile and engine company were switched to the production of war materiel. Chief engineer Marc Birkigt led work on an aircraft engine based on his successful V8 automobile engine. The resulting engine, called the Hispano-Suiza 8A (HS-31), made its first appearance in February 1915.

The first 8A kept the standard configuration of Birkigt&#x27;s existing design: eight cylinders in 90° Vee configuration, a displacement of 11.76 litres (717.8 cu in) and a power output of 140 hp at 1,900 rpm. In spite of the similarities with the original design, the engine had been substantially refined. The crankshaft was machined from a solid piece of steel. The cylinder blocks were cast aluminium and of monobloc type that is, in one piece with the SOHC cylinder heads. The inlet and exhaust ports were cast into the blocks, the valve seats were in the top face of the steel cylinder liners, which were screwed into the blocks. Using a rotating bevel gear-driven tower shaft coming up from the crankcase along the rear end of each cylinder bank, with the final drive for each cylinder bank&#x27;s camshaft accommodated within a semicircular bulge at the rear end of each valve cover. Aluminium parts were coated in vitreous enamel to reduce leakage. All parts subject to wear, and those critical for engine ignition were duplicated: spark plugs for dual ignition reliability, valve springs, magnetos, etc.

The new engine was presented to the French Ministry of War in February 1915, and tested for 15 hours at full power. This was standard procedure for a new engine design to be admitted into military service. However, because of lobbying by French engine manufacturers, the Spanish-made engine was ordered to undergo a bench test that no French-made engine had yet passed: a 50-hour run at full speed. The HS-31 was therefore sent back to Chalais-Meudon on July 21, 1915, and tested for 50 hours, succeeding against all expectations. The design also promised far more development-potential than rotary engines. This was despite being the most common type, then in use, for most aircraft.

French officials ordered production of the 8A to be started as soon as possible and issued a requirement for a new single-seat high-performance fighter aircraft using the new engine. The Louis Béchereau-designed SPAD VII was the result of this requirement and allowed the Allies to regain air superiority over the Germans.
==Production history==
The Hispano-Suiza 8 was the most produced aero engine series of World War I with 49,893 units manufactured during the conflict. The engine continued to be built in smaller numbers during the 1920s. Most of the engines were built under license in factories located in France, the United Kingdom, the United States and Italy. Small numbers of engines were also built in Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the Soviet Union.

===France===
In total 35,189 Hispano-Suiza 8 engines were produced in France during World War I. Fourteen French companies produced the engines under license including Ariès, Brasier, Chenard-Walcker, De Dion-Bouton, Peugeot and Voisin. Peugeot were the single largest manufacturer of the 200 hp (150 kW) Hispano Suiza 8 with 5,506 engines built. The Hispano-Suiza 8 shared many common parts with the Peugeot 8Aa. Camshafts, piston rings and some bearings were interchangeable.

===United States===
In 1915 representatives from the Wright Company approached the French government to negotiate a license for the Hispano-Suiza 8 engine which was then under test. The French government refused to grant a license and instead offered the Peugeot 8Aa as an alternative. Ultimately the Wright company negotiated a license directly with Hispano-Suiza in Barcelona. The Wright company went on to produce 8,976 Hispano-Suiza engines during World War I.

===United Kingdom===
The first British orders for the Hispano-Suiza 8 engines were placed in August 1915, shortly before the first order from the French government. Production in the United Kingdom was handled by Wolseley Motors who produced modified versions as the Viper. A total of 3,050 engines were built in the United Kingdom during World War I.

===Italy===
SCAT, Itala and Nagliati all took out licenses for production of the Hispano-Suiza 8. Italian production of the engines during World War I numbered 2,566 units. Most of the Italian built engines were fitted to SPAD S.VIIs and SPAD S.XIIIs imported from France.

===Czechoslovakia===
In 1922, Škoda obtained a license for the 300 hp variant which they produced throughout the 1920s.

===Japan===
In 1918, Mitsubishi acquired a production license from Hispano-Suiza.

===Spain===
During World War I, 112 Hispano-Suiza 8 engines were built by La Hispano-Suiza in Barcelona.

===Switzerland===
In 1917, Sauer reverse engineered a 150 hp Hispano-Suiza engine. The Swiss engines were initially unlicensed copies however after World War I Sauer negotiated a license with Hispano-Suiza.

===USSR===
Between 1920 and 1922 the Soviets license built 36 examples of the 220 hp Hispano-Suiza 8 model. From 1921, the Soviets designated the 220 hp model as the M-4. Other aero engines added retrospectively to the Soviet&#x27;s designation system included the RBVZ-6 (M-1), the Rhône 9J (M-2) and the Renault 12F (M-3). The Soviets also built 331 examples of the 300 hp Hispano-Suiza 8 variant as the M-6. The M-6 was in production from 1925 to 1932.

==Variants==
&quot;Some data from:&quot; British Piston Engines and their Aircraft

&quot;Note:&quot; Hispano-Suiza company type numbers were prefixed by HS- or written in full as Hispano-Suiza Type 31, but military designations used the conventional system of Hispano-Suiza(engine manufacturer) 8(no of cylinders) A(engine series) b(variant) r(attribute), thus Hispano-Suiza 8Abr.

;8A (HS-31): , initial production and test engines, with few applications, including early Nieuport 14s.
;8Aa (HS-31)
: at 2000 rpm, entered production in July 1915. Early HS-8A engines were plagued with various problems which required further work and was the standard powerplant for early-production SPAD VIIs and the Curtiss &quot;Jenny&quot; JN-4H variants. The demand for the Hispano-Suiza engine was such that other manufacturers began producing it under licence, in France, Great Britain (Wolseley Adder), Italy (Nagliati in Florence and Itala/SCAT (automobile) in Turin) and Russia. Total production of the HS-8Aa amounted to some 6,000 engines.
;8Ab (HS-34)
: at 2,100 rpm, increasing the compression ratio from 4.7 to 5.3, Birkigt was able to increase the power output . The 8Ab began replacing the 8Aa on SPAD VIIs in early 1917.

;8Ac


;8Ad
:(1929) bore x stroke, for take-off.

;8B (HS-35)
: , compression ratio 5.3:1, geared at 0.75:1. The HS-36 was the 8B with a Lewis gun firing through the propeller boss.
;8B twin (HS-39):Coupled 8B engines

;8Ba
: at 2,300 rpm, low compression ratio of 4.7:1, spur geared at 0.585:1.
;8Bb
: , compression ratio of 4.8:1, reduction gear 0.75:1. However the reduction gear system was fragile, and often broke down, sometimes with spectacular results ending up with the entire propeller, driveshaft and driven gear parting company from the airframe. Progressive refinement of the engine brought the available power to by the end of 1917.

The 8B, 8Ba and 8Bb were used (a) to power the earliest versions of the S.E.5a, (b) along with the 8Bd, the SPAD S.XIII, (c) front-line active versions of the Sopwith Dolphin, and (d) several other Allied aircraft types, with its gear reduction easily identifiable in vintage World War I photos, from its use of a clockwise (viewed from in front, otherwise known as a left hand tractor) rotation propeller.
;8Bc: , compression ratio of 5.3:1, reduction gear 0.75:1.
;8Bd: , compression ratio of 5.3:1, reduction gear 0.75:1.
::8Bda

;8Be: , compression ratio of 5.3:1, reduction gear 0.75:1.

;8BeC (HS-38): The 8Be fitted with the SAMC Model 37 cannon, or a similar weapon, firing through the propeller boss. A reduction gear equipped power-plant with a resultant clockwise rotation propeller like the 8B, produced at 2,100 rpm. Two known weapons fitted were the SAMC with a rifled barrel and a smooth-bore cannon firing canister ammunition. The moteur-canon could fire a single shot at a time through the hollow drive shaft without propeller interference. This cannon mount required an &quot;elevated&quot; intake manifold design, bringing the intake &quot;runners&quot; straight off the inner surfaces of the cylinder banks to the updraft carburetor&#x27;s plenum chamber. The engine was used on the SPAD S.XII.
;8Ca/220: Cannon-equipped at 2,100 rpm with 5.3:1 compression. Given the company designation HS Type 38
;8Cb/180: Cannon-equipped at 2,000 rpm with 4.7:1 compression. Given the company designation HS Type 44
;8Cc/220: Cannon-equipped at 2,100 rpm with 5.3:1 compression. Given the company designation HS Type 44

;Hispano-Suiza Type 40: (8E ?)

;Hispano-Suiza Type 41: (8A ?)
;8F (HS-42)
: at 2,100 rpm (eq. 750 lb·ft torque). The direct drive 8F was a bored out version of the 8B, intended for use in bombers, with a displacement of . Despite the increased weight of , the 8F was also installed in fighters such as the Nieuport-Delage NiD 29 and Martinsyde Buzzard, and would have powered the never-produced Mk.II version of the Sopwith Dolphin. Engine speed being lower than that of the HS-8B, the reduction gear was deleted, thereby increasing engine reliability.

:generally similar to the 8F.

;8Fb
: , aka HS Type 42, compression ratio of 5.3:1, direct drive.

;8Fd Special
:For the CAMS 38 Schneider Trophy racer developing

: , compression ratio of 4.7:1. License production of the 8Aa at Wolseley Motors.

;Wolseley W.4A Python II
:, compression ratio of 5.3 :1.

;Wolseley W.4A Viper
:, compression ratio of 5.3 :1. Wolseley&#x27;s engineers removed problems with the crankshaft and increased the compression ratio to give more power, with some early engines having a compression ratio of 5.6:1.

;Wolseley W.4A Viper II
: at 2,000 rpm.

;Wolseley W.4B Adder I
:, compression ratio of 4.7 :1, reduction spur gear to 0.593:1.

<text>Ronald Gabriel Palillo (April 2, 1949 – August 14, 2012) was an American actor and teacher. He was best known for his role as the endearingly dim-witted character Arnold Horshack on the ABC sitcom &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; (1975–1979).

==Early life and education==
Ronald Gabriel Paolillo was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to Italian-Americans Gabriel and Carmel Paolillo, and raised in nearby Cheshire. His father died of lung cancer when he was 10 years old. He graduated from Cheshire High School and the University of Connecticut at Storrs, where he would teach in the 1990s. He attended Fairfield University while pursuing a postgraduate degree. He adopted the last name &quot;Palillo&quot; for his acting career.

==Career==

In 1975, Palillo was cast as Arnold Horshack, one of the misfit &quot;sweathogs&quot; in the high school sitcom &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;, whose antics made him one of the standout characters of the series. In the last season of the series, a backdoor pilot episode for a spin-off series featuring Horshack was produced, but the series was not developed.

Following &quot;Kotter&quot;, Palillo appeared in leading and supporting roles in various television series and films. He voiced characters on such animated series as &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley in the Army&quot;, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, and &quot;Rubik, the Amazing Cube&quot;, in which he played the lead character. In 1996, Palillo played himself in several episodes of the television sitcom &quot;Ellen&quot;, playing the love interest of Ellen&#x27;s friend Audrey. Palillo also spent a year on the daytime show &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and also acted in &quot;Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives&quot; (1986), and the lead in &quot;The Curse of Micah Rood.&quot;

He returned to New York in 1991, and played such stage roles as Mozart in &quot;Amadeus&quot; and regionally as George in &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, Arthur in &quot;Camelot&quot; and Nathan Detroit in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;. He appeared on Broadway in 2008 in &quot;Broadway Backwards 4&quot;, a charity event benefiting Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center. Among his other New York City credits were a one-person show in 2000 where he portrayed Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann in &quot;The Diary of Adolf Eichmann&quot; off-Broadway. Palillo, in a newspaper interview in 1997, said he lamented his role as Horshack as he was permanently typecast, which he believed had damaged his career. The following year Palillo starred in &quot;The Fourposter&quot; at the Wayside Theatre in Middletown, Virginia.

As a director, Palillo directed successful productions of the musical &quot;Three Guys Naked From The Waist Down&quot; in Los Angeles, &quot;A Closer Walk with Patsy Cline&quot;, and a new edition of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; at the Cuillo Center for the Arts in West Palm Beach, Florida. In 2007, he introduced a clothing line specializing in limited-edition T-shirts produced by Rotter and Friends. Palillo was also an artist, providing artwork for two children&#x27;s books: &quot;The Red Wings of Christmas&quot; and &quot;A Gift for the Contessa.&quot;

In 2006, his first full-length play, &quot;The Lost Boy&quot;, the true story of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; author J. M. Barrie, premiered at the Helen Hayes Theatre in Nyack, New York, and later played at the Queens Theatre in the Park in Queens, New York, and at El Dorado Springs High School in El Dorado Springs, Missouri.

He taught freshman drama at G-Star School of the Arts for Motion Pictures and Broadcasting in Palm Springs, Florida.

==Personal life and death==
Palillo and his partner of 41 years, Joseph Gramm, lived in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. On August 14, 2012, Palillo suffered a heart attack at his home and was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. He died seven months after co-star Robert Hegyes, who also died from a heart attack.

Palillo&#x27;s funeral service was held in Palm Beach Gardens on August 22, 2012. He is buried at St. Lawrence Cemetery in West Haven, Connecticut. A memorial tribute, directed by Lawrence Leritz and hosted by Tyne Daly, was held to honor and celebrate Palillo&#x27;s life and career at New York City&#x27;s Triad Theatre on October 3, 2012.

<doc id="1250347" wikidata="Q150161" url="?curid=1250347" title="George McCartney (footballer)">
<text>George McCartney (born 29 April 1981) is a Northern Irish former footballer who is currently a coach at Linfield. He began his career at Sunderland in 1998 before having two spells each with West Ham United and Leeds United. He won the 2004–05 Football League Championship with Sunderland and was named the club&#x27;s player of the season award as well as being named in the 2004–05 Football League Championship PFA Team of the Year. He moved to West Ham in 2006 before returning to Sunderland under Roy Keane&#x27;s managership in 2008. He spent one season, the 2010–11 season, on loan with Leeds United before returning in 2011 to play on loan for West Ham. From 2001 until 2010 he also played international football for Northern Ireland.

==Club career==
===Sunderland===
Born in Belfast, McCartney was a trainee with Sunderland before signing a professional contract on 28 May 1998 and made his debut against Luton Town in the League Cup in 2000. He was made team captain in 2003–04 after Jason McAteer suffered a long-term injury and in 2004–05 was voted Player of the Season by Sunderland fans during the successful Championship winning campaign.

During the season his excellent performances earned him the title &quot;Mr. Consistent&quot; from manager Mick McCarthy. McCartney missed a large percentage of Sunderland&#x27;s ill-fated 2005–06 season due to injury. He showed glimpses of his potential once he had regained his fitness, but his return came far too late in the season for him to have any meaningful impact on the team&#x27;s dreadful run of results. He made 157 appearances for Sunderland in all competitions.

===West Ham United===
On 8 August 2006, McCartney moved to West Ham United in a four-year deal, in exchange for Clive Clarke and an additional £600,000. He made his debut in the team&#x27;s 2–1 defeat to Chesterfield in the League Cup on 24 October 2006. After initially spending most of his time as substitute, regular left back Paul Konchesky joined Fulham and as a result McCartney eventually became a first team regular under Alan Curbishley and his strong forward runs and crosses played a crucial role in West Ham&#x27;s eventual escape from relegation.

He went on to make 25 appearances in all competitions for West Ham during the 2006–07 season. McCartney scored his first goal for The Hammers, a strong back post header, in a friendly against Roma one week before the start of the 2007–08 season. He scored his first Premier League goal for West Ham in the 1–1 home draw with Bolton Wanderers on 4 November 2007 with a magnificent volley. At the end of the 2007–2008 season McCartney received the runner up Hammer of the Year Award, having played in all 38 Premiership games. McCartney&#x27;s sale back to his former club Sunderland led to West Ham manager Alan Curbishley resigning after he claimed the player was sold against his wishes.

===Return to Sunderland===
McCartney rejoined former club Sunderland on 1 September 2008, signing a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He was a regular under manager Roy Keane, but after Steve Bruce became manager McCartney picked up an ankle injury in March 2010 and lost his place in the team to Anton Ferdinand whilst out injured. McCartney wasn&#x27;t given a squad number for the 2010–11 season after suffering a knee injury in 2010–11 pre-season on a tour of Portugal. However, he was included in Sunderland&#x27;s 25 man Premier League squad. Kieran Richardson changed his squad number and was given the number 3 shirt for the 2010–11 season where he became Sunderland&#x27;s first choice left back and McCartney was given the number 23 jersey.

===Leeds United loan===
In order to help him regain match fitness after suffering a knee injury in pre-season and losing his first-team place at Sunderland, he joined Leeds United on 23 September 2010, initially on a one-month loan, a move which saw him link up with Northern Ireland assistant manager Glynn Snodin. On 25 September, he made his Leeds debut in a 1–0 victory in the Yorkshire derby against Sheffield United. In his second game, Leeds suffered a 6–4 defeat to Preston North End, and McCartney gave away a penalty in the match which was scored by Callum Davidson. On 4 October Leeds announced that McCartney&#x27;s loan had been extended by a further two days so he could play in the game against Cardiff City.

On 30 October 2010 McCartney signed a one-month extension to his loan deal and made an appearance against Scunthorpe United on the same day. His loan was extended for a third month on 1 December. McCartney&#x27;s loan expired on 30 December and he returned to Sunderland with Leeds attempting to extend the loan deal once the transfer window had re-opened in January 2011. On 14 January 2011, McCartney re-signed for Leeds on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season. After McCartney gave an interview where he stated that Leeds players were jaded hence the poor run of form late on in the season, he was criticised by Leeds chairman Ken Bates who revealed his anger at McCartney and that he had been fined on several occasions for turning up late to training. At the end of his loan he returned to his parent club Sunderland.

===Return to West Ham United===
On 10 August 2011 McCartney returned for another spell at West Ham United for a season-long loan.

On 19 December, McCartney was quoted as saying although Martin O&#x27;Neill had taken over at his club Sunderland, he had had no contact with the manager, and &quot;To be honest, before I agreed to come to West Ham, it was decided that my contract would be left to run out in the summer and sorted out at the end of the season. &quot;So there is no chance of a call back and no chance of me ever going back to Sunderland.&quot;

On 4 March 2012, he scored his only goal for West Ham since returning on loan, in a 2–0 away victory over Cardiff City. At the end of season awards for the 2011–12 season, he was awarded the club&#x27;s Players&#x27; Player of the Year award. His performances have also helped West Ham clinch promotion back to the Premier League after winning the play-off finals.

On 1 July 2012 McCartney rejoined newly promoted West Ham signing a two-year contract after agreeing to make the loan move permanent. In November McCartney suffered a serious knee injury playing against Liverpool. He made his comeback on 30 March 2013 against West Bromwich Albion but lasted only 15 minutes before a recurrence of the same injury which was expected to keep him from playing for the remainder of the 2012–13 season. McCartney returned to the first team for a League Cup game against Cheltenham Town on 27 August 2013. His Premier League return however was not until 30 November 2013, in a 3–0 win against Fulham. McCartney was released by West Ham at the end of the 2013–14 season. McCartney had played 82 games in all competitions in his second spell with the club, scoring a single goal.

==International career==
McCartney was capped four times for Northern Ireland national under-18 team during 2000 before earning five caps for the under-21 team from 2000 to 2001. He made his debut for the senior team in September 2001 in their World Cup qualifying win against Iceland, scoring his only goal in his professional career until that for West Ham in 2007. In 2005, he fell out with the then manager of the Northern Ireland senior team, Lawrie Sanchez and retired from international football.

However, after Nigel Worthington took charge of the national team, McCartney stated his willingness to return and on 22 August 2007, he came out of international retirement and returned to international football in the 3–1 win against Liechtenstein. Following regular run of games for Leeds, in November 2010 McCartney was recalled to the Northern Ireland Squad. In February 2011 McCartney was called into the Northern Ireland squad to face Scotland, but on 8 February 2011 he once again announced his retirement from international football.

==Coaching career==
During the 2021–22 NIFL Premiership season, McCartney joined Linfield as a coach, reuniting with former Northern Irish teammate David Healy.

<text>John Cameron (c. 1579 – 1625) was a Scottish theologian.

==Life and academic career==
Cameron was born in the Saltmarket district of Glasgow the son of Thomas Cameron and received his early education in his native city. He entered Glasgow University in 1595 and graduated MA in 1599.

After having taught Greek in the university for twelve months, he removed to Bordeaux, where he was soon appointed a regent in the college of Bergerac. He did not remain long at Bordeaux, but accepted the offer of a chair of philosophy at the Academy of Sedan, where he passed two years. He then returned to Bordeaux, and in the beginning of 1604 he was nominated one of the students of divinity who were maintained, at the expense of the church, and who for the period of four years were at liberty to prosecute their studies in any Protestant seminary. During this period he acted as tutor to the two sons of the chancellor of Navarre. They spent one year at Paris, and two at Geneva, whence they removed to Heidelberg. In this university, on 4 April 1608, he gave a public proof of his ability by maintaining a series of theses, &quot;De triplici Dei cum Homine Foedere&quot;, which were printed among his works. The same year he was recalled to Bordeaux, where he was appointed the colleague of Dr Gilbert Primrose; and when Francis Gomarus was removed to Leiden, Cameron, in 1618, was appointed professor of divinity at the Academy of Saumur, the principal seminary of the French Protestants.

In 1620, the progress of the civil troubles in France obliged Cameron to seek refuge for himself and family in England. For a short time, he read private lectures on divinity in London; and in 1622 the king appointed him principal of the University of Glasgow in the room of Robert Boyd, who had been removed from his office in consequence of his adherence to Presbyterianism. Cameron was cordially disliked for his adherence to the doctrine of passive obedience. He resigned his office in less than a year.

He returned to France, and lived at Saumur. After an interval of a year he was appointed professor of divinity at Montauban. The country was still torn by civil and religious dissensions; and Cameron excited the indignation of the more strenuous adherents of his own party. He withdrew to the neighboring town of Moissac; but he soon returned to Montauban, and a few days afterwards he died at the age of about forty-six and perhaps at the hands of an assassin. All his works were published after his death.

==Theology==
Cameron&#x27;s name has a distinct place in the development of Calvinistic theology in Europe. He and his followers maintained that the will of man is determined by the practical judgment of the mind; that the cause of men&#x27;s doing good or evil proceeds from the knowledge which God infuses into them; and that God does not move the will physically, but only morally, by virtue of its dependence on the judgment of the mind. This peculiar doctrine of grace and free will was adopted by Amyraut, Cappel, Bochart, Daillé and others of the more learned among the Reformed ministers.

The Cameronites (not to be confused with the Scottish sect called Cameronians) are moderate Calvinists. They are also wrongly called Universalists, as holding the universal scope [not application] rather than limited extent of Christ&#x27;s death, and sometimes Amyraldians. The rigid adherents to the Synod of Dort accused them of Pelagianism, and even of Manichaeism, and the controversy between the parties was carried on with great zeal; yet the whole question between them was only, whether the will of man is determined by the immediate action of God upon it, or by the intervention of a knowledge which God impresses on the mind.

==Family==

Cameron married twice:

Firstly in 1611 to Suzanne Bernadin of Tonneins and had one son, who died in infancy. Secondly in 1625 to Jeanne de Thomas, daughter of Jacques de Thomas, advocate, and widow of Dr Jean Gautier MD.

<text>The Electronic Systems Center was a product center of Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) headquartered at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts. Its mission was to develop and acquire command and control, communications, computer, and intelligence systems. ESC consisted of professional teams specializing in engineering, computer science, and business management. The teams supervised the design, development, testing, production, and deployment of command and control systems. Two of ESC&#x27;s most well-known developments were the Boeing E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), developed in the 1970s, and the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS), developed in the 1980s.

The Electronic Systems Center served into five decades as the Air Force&#x27;s organization for developing and acquiring Command and Control (C2) systems. As of December 2004, ESC managed approximately two hundred programs ranging from secure communications systems to mission planning systems. ESC had an annual budget of over $3 billion and more than eighty-seven hundred personnel. In addition to the Air Force, ESC works with other branches of the United States Department of Defense, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and foreign governments.

Due to AFMC restructuring, ESC was inactivated on 1 October 2012.

==History==
ESC was originally activated as the Electronic Systems Division (ESD) on 1 April 1961 at Laurence G. Hanscom Field in Bedford, MA. ESD was placed under the newly established Air Force Systems Command.

The Electronic Systems Division had emerged after a decade of efforts to meet a major post-war threat to the North American continent—attack by long-range, nuclear-armed bombers. At Hanscom Field, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s new Lincoln Laboratory (1951) and later the MITRE Corporation (1958) had worked to bring the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system to completion. The pioneering integrated radar and computer technology that was developed for SAGE also contributed significantly to the development of air traffic control systems.

ESD had an original portfolio of thirteen Command, Control and Communications (C3) systems. The appearance of ballistic missiles to carry nuclear warheads spurred a second wave of defense efforts—the construction of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) and a survivable new command center for the North American Air Defense Command in the underground Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado. New weapons systems and space platforms led to enlarged ESD C3 programs.

ESD’s first radar systems were ground-based, but in the 1960s, the organization expanded into airborne radar systems. In overcoming the “ground clutter” problem, the 1970s Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) represented a technological achievement for airspace surveillance. It was joined in the later 1980s by the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS). While still under development, Joint STARS was pressed into service for the Gulf War to monitor movement on the battlefield. Other ESD programs focused on creating secure communications systems, air defense systems for allied nations, command centers, intelligence data transmission, air traffic control systems, and computer-based training systems.

In 1992, the Air Force Systems Command and the Air Force Logistics Command were merged to form the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). ESD was re-designated the Electronic Systems Center (ESC), and the organization was placed under the new AFMC. Two years later, ESC was enlarged to become the AFMC Center of Excellence for Command and Control, with headquarters at Hanscom. Several geographically separated units were added to the center. At one time, the 66th Air Base Wing, 350th Electronic Systems Wing, 551st Electronic Systems Wing, 554th Electronic Systems Wing, and 653d Electronic Systems Wing all reported to the ESC Commander.

Since the later years of the Cold War, ESC worked to upgrade its key radar, command center, and communications systems. The decade of the 1990s presented new challenges for the expanded Center in the form of regional conflicts, joint and coalition engagements, terrorism, and asymmetric warfare. In response, ESC developed programs to work towards integration and interoperability in C2 systems. By presenting systems in action via several interactive C2 demonstrations, ESC engaged in ongoing dialogue with its customers. The Center then undertook a major restructure of its acquisition processes starting in 1996. “Spiral development” was introduced to achieve state-of-the-art systems in a timely, flexible, and cost-effective approach.

The pace of these initiatives had gained momentum by the start of the 21st century. The ESC developed automated systems for Air Tasking Orders, weather, mission planning, and management information, together with enhanced force protection for Air Force personnel on the ground. For the series of Joint Expeditionary Force Experiments (JEFX) starting in 1998, ESC managed the insertion of new C2 and information technology. At the same time, its work on standardizing C2 infrastructure and creating architectures laid the groundwork for further system integration.

In 2001, the Air Force gave ESC the lead responsibility to integrate its command and control, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems—the C2 Enterprise Integration. Integrated C2ISR capabilities will enable the development of network-centric warfare and provide an asymmetric force advantage. The ESC pursued a major initiative to standardize and upgrade C2ISR capabilities at Air Operations Centers, with the goal of realizing the Aerospace Operations Center of the future.

Due to a major AFMC restructuring announced on 2 November 2011, ESC was to be inactivated no later than 1 October 2012. The role of ESC, along with the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) and the Air Armament Center (AAC), will be consolidated into the new Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (LCMC). This, along with other measures, will save up to $109 million for the Air Force annually. The new LCMC will be headquartered at Wright-Patterson AFB. The highest-ranking officer at Hanscom AFB after the reorganization will be a major general, who will be the Program Executive Officer for the C3I and Networks AFPEO. The main purpose of the reorganization is to eliminate excess headquarter and staff type positions throughout AFMC.

The ESC deactivation ceremony took place on 16 July 2012 and from that point forward Hanscom AFB was part of the AFLCMC.

=== Fort Franklin ===
Fort Franklin () was an on-base encampment in the 1990s used for the purpose of testing new technology. The ESC had developed many of the radars and sensors used by military aircraft, and had created many of the command and control systems. However, when these systems were deployed for Operation Desert Storm, many did not work as advertised or communicate information to one another.
In October 1993, Lieutenant General Charles E. Franklin took over as Commander of the ESC. ESC was the home of most of the new command and control technologies being sent to the war, but was getting a bad reputation for the lack of quality in the systems sent to the war. He decided to hold a technical exercise to emulate a deployed headquarters using the equipment ESC was producing, and test the reports.

The technical exercise went live in July 1994. The encampment used a patch of grass near the end of the runway. Using tents, trailers, and communication vans inside a guarded perimeter, the area was quickly dubbed “Fort Franklin.” It was staffed by engineers from every program office and a few junior military. Major Steve Zenishek, with recent Gulf War experience, became the installation “commander” and was able to show off that the great capability indeed worked fine alone, but unfortunately didn&#x27;t work well with others.

Rather than take the failure as a defeat, General Franklin used it to encourage the staff to rebuild the systems under development to interoperate. Subsequently, by the time the second Fort Franklin occurred on 1–16 May 1995, the systems were beginning to communicate. For the first time, the results of calculations performed by one system were transferred automatically to another system for further interpretation or processing.

Not wanting to lose the expertise that had created this success, LtGen Franklin established an ongoing experimentation facility at Hanscom known as the Command &amp; Control (C2) Unified Development Environment (CUBE). CUBE was later renamed the C2 Engineering and Integration Facility (CEIF).

The experience of Fort Franklin was instrumental in development in 1997 of the Air Force&#x27;s major experiment, the Expeditionary Force Experiment (EFX 98), which became a Joint EFX (JEFX) in 1999.

<doc id="1250358" wikidata="Q275040" url="?curid=1250358" title="Émile Coué">
<text>Émile Coué de la Châtaigneraie (; 26 February 1857 – 2 July 1926) was a French psychologist, pharmacist, and hypnotist who introduced a popular method of psychotherapy and self-improvement based on optimistic autosuggestion.
::&quot;It was in no small measure [Coué&#x27;s] wholehearted devotion to a self-imposed task that enabled him, in less than a quarter of a century, to rise from obscurity to the position of the world’s most famous psychological exponent. Indeed, one might truly say that &quot;Coué sidetracked inefficient hypnotism [mistakenly based upon supposed operator dominance over a subject], and paved the way for the efficient, and truly scientific&quot;.&quot; — Orton (1935).
::&quot;Coué’s &quot;method&quot; was disarmingly non-complex—needing few instructions for on-going competence, based on rational principles, easily understood, demanding no intellectual sophistication, simply explained, simply taught, performed in private, using a subject&#x27;s own resources, requiring no elaborate preparation, and no expenditure.&quot; — Yeates (2016). 
::&quot;Most of us are so accustomed … to an elaborate medical ritual … in the treatment of our ills … [that] anything so simple as Coué&#x27;s autosuggestion is inclined to arouse misgivings, antagonism and a feeling of scepticism.&quot; — Duckworth (1922).

Coué&#x27;s method was based upon the view that, operating deep below our conscious awareness, a complex arrangement of &#x27;ideas&#x27;, especially when those ideas are &quot;dominant&quot;, continuously and spontaneously suggest things to us; and, from this, significantly influence one&#x27;s overall health and wellbeing.
::&quot;We possess within us a force of incalculable power, which, when we handle it unconsciously is often prejudicial to us. If on the contrary we direct it in a conscious and wise manner, it gives us the mastery of ourselves and allows us not only to escape … from physical and mental ills, but also to live in relative happiness, whatever the conditions in which we may find ourselves.&quot; (Coué, 1922b, p. 35.)
::&quot;As long as we look on autosuggestion as a remedy we miss its true significance. Primarily it is a means of self-culture, and one far more potent than any we have hitherto possessed. It enables us to develop the mental qualities we lack: efficiency, judgment, creative imagination, all that will help us to bring our life&#x27;s enterprise to a successful end. Most of us are aware of thwarted abilities, powers undeveloped, impulses checked in their growth. These are present in our Unconscious like trees in a forest, which, overshadowed by their neighbours, are stunted for lack of air and sunshine. By means of autosuggestion we can supply them with the power needed for growth and bring them to fruition in our conscious lives. However old, however infirm, however selfish, weak or vicious we may be, autosuggestion will do something for us. It gives us a new means of culture and discipline by which the &quot;accents immature&quot;, the &quot;purposes unsure&quot; can be nursed into strength, and the evil impulses attacked at the root. It is essentially an individual practice, an individual attitude of mind.&quot; (Brooks, 1922, p. 116)

==Life and career==
Coué&#x27;s family, from the Brittany region of France and with origins in French nobility, had only modest means. A brilliant pupil in school, he initially intended to become an analytical chemist. However, he eventually abandoned these studies, as his father, who was a railroad worker, was in a precarious financial state. Coué then decided to become a pharmacist and graduated with a degree in pharmacology in 1876.

Working as an apothecary at Troyes from 1882 to 1910, Coué quickly discovered what later came to be known as the placebo effect. He became known for reassuring his clients by praising each remedy&#x27;s efficiency and leaving a small positive notice with each given medication. In 1886 and 1887, he studied with Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault and Hippolyte Bernheim, two leading exponents of hypnotism, in Nancy.

In 1910, Coué sold his business and retired to Nancy, where he opened a clinic that continuously delivered some 40,000 treatment-units per annum (Baudouin, 1920, p. 14) to local, regional, and overseas patients over the next sixteen years. In 1913, Coué and his wife founded &quot;The Lorraine Society of Applied Psychology&quot; (). His book &quot;Self-Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion&quot; was published in England (1920), and in the United States (1922). Although Coué&#x27;s teachings were, during his lifetime, more popular in Europe than in the United States, many Americans who adopted his ideas and methods, such as Elsie Lincoln Benedict, Maxwell Maltz, Napoleon Hill, Norman Vincent Peale, Robert H. Schuller, and W. Clement Stone, became famous in their own right by spreading his words.

Considered by Charles Baudouin to represent a second Nancy School, Coué treated many patients in groups and free of charge.

== The Coué Method: General ==
::     The Coué Method&lt;br&gt;Continuously, unjustly, and mistakenly trivialised as just a hand-clasp, some unwarranted optimism, and a &#x27;mantra&#x27;, Coué&#x27;s &quot;method&quot; evolved over several decades of meticulous observation, theoretical speculation, in-the-field testing, incremental adjustment, and step-by-step transformation.It tentatively began (c.1901) with very directive one-to-one hypnotic interventions, based upon the approaches and techniques that Coué had acquired from an American correspondence course.As his theoretical knowledge, clinical experience, understanding of suggestion and autosuggestion, and hypnotic skills expanded, it gradually developed into its final subject-centred version—an intricate complex of (group) education, (group) hypnotherapy, (group) ego-strengthening, and (group) training in self-suggested pain control; and, following instruction in performing the prescribed self-administration ritual, the twice daily intentional and deliberate (individual) application of its unique formula, &quot;Every day, in every way, I&#x27;m getting better and better&quot;. Yeates (2016c), p.55.

The application of his mantra-like conscious autosuggestion, &quot;Every day, in every way, I&#x27;m getting better and better&quot; () is called Couéism or the Coué method. Some American newspapers quoted it differently, &quot;Day by day, in every way, I&#x27;m getting better and better.&quot; The Coué method centered on a routine repetition of this particular expression according to a specified ritual—preferably as many as twenty times a day, and especially at the beginning and at the end of each day. When asked whether or not he thought of himself as a healer, Coué often stated that &quot;I have never cured anyone in my life. All I do is show people how they can cure themselves.&quot; Unlike a commonly held belief that a strong conscious will constitutes the best path to success, Coué maintained that curing some of our troubles requires a change in our unconscious thought, which can be achieved only by using our imagination.

Although stressing that he was not primarily a healer but one who taught others to heal themselves, Coué claimed to have effected organic changes through autosuggestion.
===Self-suggestion===
Coué identified two types of self-suggestion: (i) the intentional, &quot;&quot;reflective suggestion&quot; made by deliberate and conscious effort, and (ii) the involuntary &quot;spontaneous suggestion&quot;&quot;, that is a &quot;natural phenomenon of our mental life … which takes place without conscious effort [and has its effect] with an intensity proportional to the keenness of [our] attention&quot;. Baudouin identified three different sources of spontaneous suggestion: 
::A. Instances belonging to the representative domain (sensations, mental images, dreams, visions, memories, opinions, and all intellectual phenomena);
::B. Instances belonging to the affective domain (joy or sorrow, emotions, sentiments, tendencies, passions); 
::C. Instances belonging to the active or motor domain (actions, volitions, desires, gestures, movements at the periphery or in the interior of the body, functional or organic modifications).

===Two minds===
According to Yeates, Coué shared the theoretical position that Thomson Jay Hudson had expressed in his &quot;Law of Psychic Phenomena&quot; (1893): namely, that our &quot;mental organization&quot; was such that it seemed as if we had &quot;two minds, each endowed with separate and distinct attributes and powers; [with] each capable, under certain conditions, of independent action&quot;.

Further, argued Hudson, it was entirely irrelevant, for explanatory purposes, whether we &quot;actually had&quot; &quot;two distinct minds&quot;, whether we only &quot;seemed to be&quot; &quot;endowed with a dual mental organization&quot;, or whether we &quot;actually had&quot; &quot;one mind [possessed of] certain attributes and powers under some conditions, and certain other attributes and powers under other conditions&quot;.

==The Coué Method: Development and origins==


Coué noticed that in certain cases he could improve the efficacy of a given medicine by praising its effectiveness to the patient. He realized that those patients to whom he praised the medicine had a noticeable improvement when compared to patients to whom he said nothing. This began Coué&#x27;s exploration of the use of hypnosis and the power of the imagination.

Coué&#x27;s initial method for treating patients relied on hypnosis. He discovered that subjects could not be hypnotized against their will and, more importantly, that the effects of hypnosis waned when the subjects regained consciousness. He thus eventually turned to autosuggestion, which he describes as
Coué believed in the effects of medication. But he also believed that our mental state is able to affect and even amplify the action of these medications. Coué recommended that patients take medicines with the confidence that they would be completely cured very soon, and healing would be optimal. Conversely, he contended, patients who are skeptical of a medicine would find it least effective. By consciously using autosuggestion, he observed that his patients could cure themselves more efficiently by replacing their &quot;thought of illness&quot; with a new &quot;thought of cure&quot;. According to Coué, repeating words or images enough times causes the subconscious to absorb them. The cures were the result of using imagination or &quot;positive autosuggestion&quot; to the exclusion of one&#x27;s own willpower.
==The Coué Method: Underlying principles==
Coué thus developed a method which relied on the principle that &quot;any idea exclusively occupying the mind turns into reality&quot;, although only to the extent that the idea is within the realm of possibility. For instance, a person without hands will not be able to make them grow back. However, if a person firmly believes that his or her asthma is disappearing, then this may actually happen, as far as the body is actually able physically to overcome or control the illness. On the other hand, thinking negatively about the illness (ex. &quot;I am not feeling well&quot;) will encourage both mind and body to accept this thought. Likewise, when someone cannot remember a name, they probably will be unable to recall it as long as they hold onto this idea (i.e., &quot;I can&#x27;t remember&quot;) in their mind. Coué realised that it is better to focus on and imagine the desired, positive results (i.e., &quot;I feel healthy and energetic,&quot; and &quot;I can remember clearly&quot;).

===Willpower===
Coué observed that the main obstacle to autosuggestion was willpower. For the method to work, the patient must refrain from making any independent judgment, meaning that he must not let his will impose its own views on positive ideas. Everything must thus be done to ensure that the positive &quot;autosuggestive&quot; idea is consciously &quot;accepted&quot; by the patient; otherwise, one may end up getting the opposite effect of what is desired.

For example, when a student has forgotten an answer to a question in an exam, he likely will think something such as, &quot;I have forgotten the answer&quot;. The more he tries to think of it, the more the answer becomes blurred and obscured. However, if this negative thought is replaced with a positive one (&quot;No need to worry - it will come back to me&quot;), the chances that the student will remember the answer will increase.

Coué noted that young children always applied his method perfectly, as they lacked the willpower that remained present among adults. When he instructed a child by saying, &quot;Clasp your hands, and you can&#x27;t open them,&quot; the child thus would 
immediately follow.

===Self-conflict===
A patient&#x27;s problems are likely to increase when his willpower and imagination (or mental ideas) are opposing each other, something Coué would refer to as &quot;self-conflict&quot;. In the student&#x27;s case, the will to succeed clearly is incompatible with his thought of being incapable of remembering his answers. As the conflict intensifies, so does the problem: the more the patient tries to sleep, the more he becomes awake. The more a patient tries to stop smoking, the more he smokes. The patient must thus abandon his willpower and instead put more focus on his imaginative power in order to succeed fully with his cure.

==The Coué Method: Efficacy ==
Thanks to his method, which Coué once called his &quot;trick&quot;, patients of all sorts would come to visit him. The list of ailments included kidney problems, diabetes, memory loss, stammering, weakness, atrophy, and all sorts of physical and mental illnesses. According to one of his journal entries (1916), he apparently cured a patient of a uterus prolapse as well as &quot;violent pains in the head&quot; (migraine).

C. (Cyrus) Harry Brooks (1890–1951), author of various books on Coué, claimed the success rate of his method was around 93%. The remaining 7% of people would include those who were too skeptical of Coué&#x27;s approach and those who refused to recognize it.

==Criticism==
::&quot;That Coué&#x27;s formula could be applied with a minimum of instruction was challenging; and the accounts of Coué&#x27;s method curing organic disease were just as threatening to the conventional medicine of the day, as they were inspiring to Coué&#x27;s devotees.&quot;
Some critics, such as Barrucand and Paille (1986), argue that the astonishing results widely attributed to Coué were due to his &quot;charisma&quot;, rather than his &quot;method&quot;. In contrast, Barcs-Masson (1962, p. 368), observes that Coué was the complete opposite of Jules Romains&#x27; character, Dr. Knock &quot;whose exceptional commercial success came from his ability to convince healthy individuals that they had a heretofore-unrecognised ailment&quot; and rather than, as Knock did, find unrecognized disease within the healthy, Coué activated dormant health within the ailing.

Although Coué never produced any empirical evidence for the efficacy of his formula (and, therefore, his claims have not been scientifically evaluated), three subsequent experimental studies, conducted more than half a century later, by Paulhus (1993), &quot;seem to offer some unexpected support for Coué&#x27;s claims&quot;.

===The psycho-medical establishment===
According to Yeates (2016a, p. 19), the protests routinely made by those within the psychomedical establishment (e.g., Moxon, 1923; Abraham, 1926) were on one or more of the following grounds:
:(1) &quot;Healing of organic disease by &#x27;self-mastery&#x27; was impossible! Aside from &#x27;spontaneous remissions&#x27; of authentic disease (efficacious &quot;vis medicatrix naturæ&quot;!), reported &#x27;cures&#x27; were either due to mistaken diagnosis (it was &quot;never&quot; that disease!), or mistaken prognosis (it was &quot;always&quot; going to get better!). Anyway, even if it had been diagnosed correctly, there was no compelling evidence to suggest that Coué&#x27;s approach had been in any way responsible for the cure.&quot;
:(2) &quot;Even if it was true that, in some extraordinary circumstances, healing by &#x27;self-mastery&#x27; was &quot;possible&quot;, Coué&#x27;s failure to immediately eliminate those with counterproductive limitations — such as, for example, those lacking the required dedication, mind-set, talent, diligence, persistence, patience, etc. — resulted in many (clearly unsuited) individuals mistakenly postponing (otherwise) life-saving operations and delaying (otherwise) radical medical treatment far beyond any prospect of recovery or cure.&quot;
:(3) &quot;Despite the obvious fact that each &#x27;disease&#x27; had a unique cause, a unique history, and a unique (and idiosyncratic) personal impact, Coué treated a wide range of disparate individuals in the same, single group session, in the same way; and, moreover, he treated them without any sort of detailed examination or differential diagnosis.&quot;
:(4) &quot;The method&#x27;s central &#x27;magical incantation&#x27; — a specific formula, uttered a specific number of times, in a special way, using a knotted string — aroused strong opposition, as it reeked of outmoded superstitious practices and beliefs.&quot;

===The press===
While most American reporters of his day seemed dazzled by Coué&#x27;s accomplishments, and did not question the results attributed to his method, a handful of journalists and a few educators were skeptical. After Coué had left Boston, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; waited six months, revisited the patients he had &quot;cured&quot;, and found most had initially felt better but soon returned to whatever ailments they previously had.
Few of the patients would criticize Coué, saying he did seem very sincere in what he tried to do, but the &quot;Herald&quot; reporter concluded that any benefit from Coué&#x27;s method seemed to be temporary and might be explained by being caught up in the moment during one of Coué&#x27;s events. Whilst a number of academic psychologists looked upon his work favourably, others did not. Coué was also criticized by exponents of psychoanalysis, with Otto Fenichel concluding: &quot;A climax of dependence masked as independent power is achieved by the methods of &quot;autosuggestion&quot; where a weak and passive ego is controlled by an immense superego with magical powers. This power is, however, borrowed and even usurped&quot;.

==Memorials==
On 28 June 1936, a monument erected to the memory of Coué, funded by worldwide subscription, and featuring a bust of Coué created by French sculptor Eugène Gatelet, was dedicated in St Mary&#x27;s Park, in Nancy. The bust was stored for safe-keeping during World War II and, postwar, in 1947, was restored to its former position through the efforts of Armand Lebrun, the director of the Institut Coué in Brussels from 1923.

<doc id="1250365" wikidata="Q312262" url="?curid=1250365" title="Jean-Claude Pascal">
<text>Jean-Claude Villeminot (24 October 1927 – 5 May 1992), better known as Jean-Claude Pascal (), was a French comedian, actor, singer and writer.

==Early life==
He was born in Paris into a family of wealthy textile manufacturers. His mother, Arlette Lemoine, was the great-granddaughter of English fashion designer Charles Frederick Worth. His father, Roger Villeminot, died the year of his birth.

He began his secondary education in 1938 at the Collège Annel, in Compiègne, and concluded it at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly in Paris. In 1944, at the age of 17, he enlisted in the 2nd Armored Division of General Leclerc. He was the first French soldier to enter Strasbourg in November 1944, while the German Army was still in the process of evacuating the city. For this, he received the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; in 1945.

==Career==
After surviving World War II in Strasbourg, Pascal studied at the Sorbonne before turning to fashion-designing for Christian Dior. While working on costumes for the theater production of the play &quot;Don Juan,&quot; he was exposed to acting. His first acting role was in the film &quot;Le jugement de Dieu&quot; (1949, released in 1952) and afterwards in &quot;Le rideau cramoisi&quot;, 1951, opposite Anouk Aimée, followed by several films including &quot;Die schöne Lügnerin&quot; (&quot;La Belle et l&#x27;empereur&quot; 1959, &#x27;Beautiful Liar&#x27;) with Romy Schneider, and &quot;Angelique and the Sultan&quot; (&quot;Angélique et le sultan&quot;, 1968) with Michèle Mercier.

Pascal won the 1961 Eurovision Song Contest for Luxembourg with the song &quot;Nous les amoureux&quot; (&#x27;We the lovers&#x27;), with music composed by Jacques Datin and lyrics by Maurice Vidalin. The song tells the story of a thwarted love between the singer and his lover (&quot;they would like to separate us, they would like to hinder us / from being happy&quot;). The lyrics go on about how the relationship is rejected by others but will finally be possible (&quot;but the time will come. [...] and I will be able to love you without anybody in town talking about it. [...] [God] gave us the right to happiness and joy.&quot;). Later, Pascal explained that the song was about a homosexual relationship and the difficulties it faced. As this topic would have been considered controversial in the early 1960s, the lyrics are ambiguous and do not refer to the lovers&#x27; gender. This allowed hiding the song&#x27;s actual message, which was not understood in this way by the general public at the time. Pascal was himself gay, although he never came out during his life.

He later represented Luxembourg again in the 1981 contest and finished 11th of 20 with the song &quot;C&#x27;est peut-être pas l&#x27;Amérique&quot; (&#x27;It may not be America&#x27;), with words and music he composed together with Sophie Makhno and Jean-Claude Petit. Pascal died in Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine in 1992, aged 64, of stomach cancer.

<doc id="1250369" wikidata="Q6900824" url="?curid=1250369" title="Monkey and banana problem">
<text>The monkey and banana problem is a famous toy problem in artificial intelligence, particularly in logic programming and planning.

==Formulation of the problem==
A monkey is in a room. Suspended from the ceiling is a bunch of bananas, beyond the monkey&#x27;s reach. However, in the room there are also a chair and a stick. The ceiling is just the right height so that a monkey standing on a chair could knock the bananas down with the stick. The monkey knows how to move around, carry other things around, reach for the bananas, and wave a stick in the air. What is the best sequence of actions for the monkey?

==Purpose of the problem==
The problem seeks to answer the question of whether monkeys are intelligent. Both humans and monkeys have the ability to use mental maps to remember things like where to go to find shelter, or how to avoid danger. They can also remember where to go to gather food and water, as well as how to communicate with each other. Monkeys have the ability not only to remember how to hunt and gather but to learn new things, as is the case with the monkey and the bananas: despite the fact that the monkey may never have been in an identical situation, with the same artifacts at hand, a monkey is capable of concluding that it needs to make a ladder, position it below the bananas, and climb up to reach for them.

The degree to which such abilities should be ascribed to instinct or learning is a matter of debate.

In 1984, a pigeon was observed as having the capacity to solve a problem.

==Software solutions==
The problem is used as a toy problem for computer science. It can be solved with an expert system such as CLIPS. The example set of rules that CLIPS provides is somewhat fragile in that naive changes to the rulebase that might seem to a human of average intelligence to make common sense can cause the engine to fail to get the monkey to reach the banana.

Other examples exist using Rules Based System (RBS) a project implemented in Python.

<doc id="1250371" wikidata="Q1797658" url="?curid=1250371" title="Locomotive Software">
<text>Locomotive Software was a small British software house that did most of its development for Amstrad&#x27;s home and small business computers of the 1980s. It was founded by Richard Clayton and Chris Hall on 14 February 1983.

It wrote or contributed significantly to the ROMs of the Amstrad CPC 464, Amstrad CPC 664 and Amstrad CPC 6128 home computers, the Amstrad PCW wordprocessor and the later Amstrad-manufactured ZX Spectrum +2A, +2B and +3 machines, amongst others. Its Locomotive BASIC for the CPC range was a fast and highly featured implementation of BASIC for the time and later led to the development of Mallard BASIC for Amstrad&#x27;s CP/M+ machines. Locomotive was also responsible for the ports of the CP/M operating system to Amstrad machines — initially 2.2 for the CPC 464 and CPC 664 and later CP/M 3.0 (&quot;CP/M+&quot;) for the CPC 6128, PCW range and Spectrum +3.

A later Locomotive BASIC was BASIC2 for Digital Research&#x27;s GEM graphical user interface, as supplied with the Amstrad PC1512 and PC1640 range of PC clones.

The company also developed the LocoScript word processor for the PCW, which was a complete bootable environment in its own right with no separate underlying operating system. The company later produced a PC version of this software, but it was not very successful, partly because it was a DOS application, just as the PC market was moving to Microsoft Windows, but also because the program compared poorly to incumbents like WordPerfect in the more competitive environment of PC word processors.

The same team later went on to develop the Turnpike Internet client for Windows, which was for many years distributed as the standard access software by pioneering dial-up Internet access provider Demon Internet. Demon Internet later acquired Locomotive Software.

<text>Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are an observational manifestation of magnetars—young, isolated, highly magnetized neutron stars. These energetic X-ray pulsars are characterized by slow rotation periods of ~2–12 seconds and large magnetic fields of ~1013–1015 gauss (1 to 100 gigateslas). , there were 12 confirmed and 2 candidate AXPs known. The identification of AXPs with magnetars was motivated by their similarity to soft gamma repeaters.

<text>Princess Elżbieta Izabela Czartoryska (21 May 1736 – 11 November 1816), better known under her married name of Izabela Lubomirska, was a politically influential Polish aristocrat, philanthropist and cultural patron.

==Life==

She was the daughter of August Aleksander Czartoryski, one of the leaders of the Familia, and Maria Zofia Czartoryska. In her youth, she fell in love with her cousin, Stanisław August Poniatowski, later elected King of Poland as Stanislaus Augustus, but was unable to marry him due to the objections of her father, who thought him not sufficiently rich or influential.

Eventually, she married Stanisław Lubomirski on 9 June 1753, later Grand Marshal of the Crown, with whom she had four children: Julia, Konstancja, Elżbieta, and Aleksandra.

She was a member of the Women&#x27;s Adoption Lodge - &quot;Dobroczynność&quot; (&quot;Charity&quot;) - of the Polish Freemasons from 1783. Because of her liking for blue, which she often wore, she was called the &quot;Blue Marquise&quot;.

She was one of the biggest and the wealthiest landowners in the Commonwealth. Her properties included the palace in Wilanów (prior royal residence of John III Sobieski) near Warsaw, the palace in Ursynów (then called &quot;Rozkosz&quot;, translating as &quot;Plaisance&quot;), which she built for her daughter Aleksandra, and the &quot;Mon Coteau&quot; palace in Mokotów (today&#x27;s Szustra Palace). She laid the cornerstone for the building of the National Theatre in Warsaw and initiated the reconstruction of her husband&#x27;s family estate, the Łańcut Castle, in the Rococo style.

Undoubtedly, she was one of the most outstanding women in Poland in the 18th century. She took a very active part in the politics of her camp, strove both for the acquisition of foreign courts and the masses of the Polish nobility. At first, she was very fond of her youth&#x27;s presumed lover, Stanislaus Augustus, then she fought him passionately. Embittered by the failure of her actions at court, she moved to Paris, and after the outbreak of the revolution, she escaped to Vienna. Apart from her political activity, she distinguished herself as a progressive protector of peasants - she founded schools and hospitals in her estates.

She died on November 25, 1816, in Vienna. She was buried in the Währing cemetery. On September 23, 1885, due to the liquidation of the cemetery in Währing, the coffin was transported to the parish church in Łańcut, where it was buried again. Earlier, a monument of white Carrara marble was erected in the temple, funded by count Alfred Potocki.

In the Łańcut estate, she founded a distillery which exists today under the name Polmos Łańcut.

<doc id="1250381" wikidata="Q2281589" url="?curid=1250381" title="Bimbo">
<text>Bimbo is slang for a conventionally attractive, sexualized naïve woman. The term was originally used in the United States as early as 1919 for an unintelligent or brutish man. As of the early 21st century, the &quot;stereotypical bimbo&quot; appearance became akin to that of a physically attractive woman. It is commonly employed to characterize women who are blonde, have curvaceous physiques, wear excessive makeup, and dress in revealing attire while being associated with &quot;the dumb blonde&quot; stereotype.

==History==
The word bimbo derives from the Italian &quot;bimbo&quot;, a masculine-gender term that means &quot;little or baby boy&quot; or &quot;young (male) child&quot; (the feminine form of the Italian word is &quot;bimba&quot;). Use of this term began in the United States as early as 1919, and was a slang word used to describe an unintelligent or brutish man.

It was not until the 1920s that the term &quot;bimbo&quot; began to be associated with women in popular culture. In 1920, Frank Crumit, Billy Jones, and Aileen Stanley all recorded versions of &quot;My Little Bimbo Down on the Bamboo Isle&quot;, with words by Grant Clarke and music by Walter Donaldson. The song uses the term &quot;bimbo&quot; to describe an island girl of questionable virtue. The 1929 silent film &quot;Desert Nights&quot; uses it to describe a wealthy female , and in &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot;, an angry Bessie Love calls a chorus girl a bimbo. The first use of its female meaning cited in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is dated 1929, from the scholarly journal &quot;American Speech&quot;, where the definition was given simply as &quot;a woman&quot;.

In the 1940s, &quot;bimbo&quot; was still being used to refer to both men and women, as in, for example the comic novel &quot;Full Moon&quot; by P. G. Wodehouse who wrote of &quot;bimbos who went about the place making passes at innocent girls after discarding their wives like old tubes of toothpaste&quot;.

The term died out again for much of the 20th century until it became popular again in the 1980s and 1990s, with political sex scandals. As bimbo began to be used increasingly for females, exclusively male variations of the word began to surface, like mimbo and himbo, a backformation of bimbo, which refers to an unintelligent, but attractive, man.

In 2017, &quot;The Bimbo Movement&quot; was founded by self-proclaimed bimbo and adult star Alicia Amira, &quot;the woman most responsible for popularizing the idea of reclaiming hyper-femininity&quot; in order to destigmatise women who are bimbos and to reclaim the term &quot;bimbo&quot;. The term later re-entered usage by way of some members of Generation Z seeking to further reclaim the pejorative, such as the &quot;BimboTok&quot; community on the social media platform TikTok, where users engaged in stereotypical hyper-femininity to satirise consumerism, capitalism, and misogyny.

The term is sometimes associated with men or women who dye their hair blond, indicating that physical attractiveness is more important to them than other, non-physical traits and as an extension to &quot;the dumb blonde&quot; stereotype.

===Politics===
In American politics, the word was used in the 1990s during Bill Clinton&#x27;s sexual misconduct allegations, leading to the invention of the term &quot;&quot; to refer to political sex scandals. The expression was also used in a 2014 report in which Colin Powell explained his reluctance to vote for Hillary Clinton in light of her husband&#x27;s continued affairs with &quot;bimbos&quot;.

After the first 2015 Republican Presidential Debate, Donald Trump re-tweeted a message calling debate moderator and Fox News host Megyn Kelly a &quot;bimbo&quot; via Twitter. This took place after Kelly asked Trump a question that referenced his television show &quot;The Apprentice&quot; from season 6 in 2005. Shortly afterwards, Stephen Richter of &quot;The Globalist&quot; published an opinion piece in which he accused Trump of being a bimbo, noting the original definition of bimbo as &quot;an unintelligent or brutish male&quot;.

In March 2024, the California First Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower court&#x27;s decision to deny a woman&#x27;s request to change her name to Candi Bimbo Doll, marking a notable legal development in American jurisprudence related to &#x27;bimbofication&#x27;.

<text>Rose State College is a public community college in Midwest City, Oklahoma.

==History==
Rose State College was originally named Oscar Rose Junior College in memory of Oscar V. Rose, a former Mid-Del School District school superintendent. The school was renamed Rose State College in April 1983 by Senate Bill Number 9, which went into effect on November 1, 1983.

Rose State College offered its first classes on September 21, 1970. Voters in Midwest City, Del City, and portions of southeastern and northeastern Oklahoma City approved the college district in 1968. This vote followed passage of Senate Bill Number 2 in 1967, a law enabling district-operated community colleges to receive state aid. Voters then passed a $1.75 million general obligation bond issue, a two-mill levy for operating expenses in 1969, and a three-mill levy for operations in 1970. In December 1973, the junior college became a member of The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education, after approval from the Rose State College Board of Trustees. Rose State College exists as a publicly created and sustained, open-admissions, associate degree-granting college to provide comprehensive lower-division programs of higher education and related community services. To meet enrollment growth, the Communication Center was built in 1998, providing art, music, and journalism classrooms as well as a home for theatrical and musical performances. Part of the college was impacted by a tornado on May 3, 1999; some of the damage in this area was rated high-end F4 on the Fujita scale, although F5 was considered. Popularity of the dental hygiene and dental assistant programs led to the construction of the Health Sciences Annex, completed in 2001. Rose State College has grown from an initial enrollment of 1,700 in 1970 to a regular fall enrollment of approximately 8,200. The campus now includes twenty-two buildings on approximately .

==Academics==
The college has a regular enrollment of more than 8,000 students and covers over . Rose State offers scholarships to students including Leadership Scholarships and the Ticket to Rose Program.
Ticket to Rose provides free tuition and mandatory fees for graduates of Midwest City High School, Carl Albert High School, Choctaw High School, Del City High School, and Star Spencer High School.

==Student life==
Rose State&#x27;s colors are blue and gold, and their mascot is the Raider, based on Doolittle&#x27;s Raiders, best known for leading a bombing run on Tokyo on April 18, 1942, shortly following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, marking the U.S. entry into World War II. The college serves hundreds of military personnel each year due to its proximity to Tinker Air Force Base. The college runs a student newspaper, entitled &quot;The 15th Street News&quot;, and hosts a number of community events throughout the year. On the campus of Rose State is &quot;The Village,&quot; a complex of apartment-style housing capable of accommodating up to 180 students.

<text>Major General Stuart Heintzelman (19 November 1876 – 6 July 1935) was an American soldier. He was a grandson of Civil War general Samuel P. Heintzelman.

==Military career==
He was commissioned as a second lieutenant of cavalry from the United States Military Academy in 1899. For the first five years of his career, he served with the 6th Cavalry in Kansas and Idaho, the 4th Cavalry in the Philippines, and as part of the international force putting down the Boxer uprising in China. In 1904, Heintzelman began what would become a long and distinguished association with Fort Leavenworth when he was selected as the Infantry and Cavalry School honor graduate. After service in the Philippines, Heintzelman returned to Fort Leavenworth as an instructor followed by another academic assignment as the Professor of Military Art and Science at Princeton University.

During World War I, as a general staff officer with the American Expeditionary Force, Heintzelman was responsible for planning the St. Mihiel Offensive. He also served with the French in the Chemin des Dames offensive in October 1917, and in winter operations in northern Italy with the French Tenth Army.

From 1921 to 1929, he held numerous command and staff positions, including command of the 22nd Infantry Brigade, commander of the Eastern Defenses of New York, and Assistant Chief of Staff for War Plans. In 1929, he again returned to Fort Leavenworth to serve as the commandant of the Command and General Staff College and was promoted to major general in 1931. As commandant, Heintzelman was influential in updating the curriculum and actively participated in the classroom.

==Death==
Following complications from a gall bladder operation at the Army-Navy Hospital at Hot Springs, Arkansas, Heintzelman died on July 6, 1935, at the age of 58. At the time, he was in command of the Seventh Corps Area, at Fort Omaha, Nebraska. He is buried in the Arlington National Cemetery with his wife, who had died a few months before.

==Awards==

<text>The American Staffordshire Terrier, also known as the AmStaff, is a medium-sized, short-coated American dog breed recognized by the American Kennel Club, but not the United Kennel Club, which instead allows American Staffordshire Terriers to be registered under the American Pit Bull Terrier breed.

The height of an American Staffordshire Terrier is tall and weighs between . The American Kennel Club (AKC) describes the breed as &quot;confident, smart and good-natured&quot;. American Staffordshire Terriers are not to be confused with American Pit Bull Terriers, though the American Pit Bull Terrier has similar ancestry they are two distinct breeds. It also should not be confused with the &quot;Staffy&quot; Staffordshire Bull Terrier of the United Kingdom.

== History ==
Some varieties of the extinct bull-and-terrier dog from the British Isles began to find their way into America as early as 1850. This varieties became a breed recognized by the United Kennel Club as American Pit Bull Terrier in 1898. In 1936 the American Kennel Club accepted to recognized the breed with a different name and registered a some individuals in the stud book. The name &quot;Staffordshire Terrier&quot; was approved because the ancestors of the breed was claimed to originally came from Staffordshire, England, a statement inspired by the recognition in 1935 of the related counterpart breed in England as the british Staffordshire Bull Terrier by the british Kennel Club. The name of the american AKC registered breed was revised on January 1st 1969 and changed to &quot;American Staffordshire Terrier&quot; to distinguish it from the british Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

The AKC closed and opened the AmStaff Stud Book to UKC registered American Pit Bull Terrier dogs a few more times until the 1970s. Since then both sire and dam had to be AKC registered dogs in order to register its offspring as American Staffordshire Terriers. The breed selection was based entirely on conformation and established breed standards that for decades has transformed the American Staffordshire Terrier into a much different breed from the American Pit Bull Terrier.

== Temperament ==
According to the American Kennel Club, these dogs are &quot;smart, confident, good-natured companions. Their courage is proverbial. A responsibly bred, well-socialized AmStaff is a loyal, trustworthy friend to the end.&quot;

The official breed club of America points out that dog aggression can occur even if the dogs have been well-socialized and that therefore they should not be left alone with other dogs.

== Description ==
According to AKC&#x27;s published breed standard which was approved June 10, 1936, the &quot;American Staffordshire Terrier should give the impression of great strength for his size, a well put-together dog, muscular, but agile and graceful, keenly alive to his surroundings. He should be stocky, not long-legged or racy in outline. His courage is proverbial.&quot; His head should be medium in length with a broad skull, a distinct stop, and pronounced muscles in the cheek. The ears should be set high on their head and can be cropped or uncropped, but the latter is preferred. Height and weight should be in proportion. A height of about at shoulders for the male and for the female is to be considered preferable. The nose should always be black. Many coat colors are accepted. However, dogs with liver or black-and-tan coat, and dogs with more than 80% white are discouraged.

== Health ==

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.5 years compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

The breed is predisposed to allergic skin disease and demodicosis. An American study found 20% of juvenile (under the age of two) American Staffordshire Terriers to suffer from demodicosis compared to 0.58% overall.

A North American study of 1,000,000 and 250,000 hip and elbow scans found 24.4% American Staffordshire Terriers to have hip dysplasia and 16.1% to have elbow dysplasia. Another North American study found 1.84% of American Staffordshire Terriers to have the condition, half of the overall rate of 3.52%.

== Breed-specific legislation and restrictions ==

Worldwide, the American Staffordshire Terrier has often been included in breed bans that target pit bull–type dogs and/or fighting dog breeds. Such breed-specific legislation (BSL) may range from outright bans on possession to restrictions and conditions of ownership. Breed Specific Legislation has been enacted in various countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Norway, Turkey, and the United States.

==Popularity==
In 2017, the breed was the eighth most popular dog according to the Australian National Kennel Council. According to Société Centrale Canine, it is the sixth most popular dog in France. According to the American Kennel Club, it was the 85th most popular dog in 2020.

<text>Catherine Winkworth (13 September 1827 – 1 July 1878) was an English hymnwriter and educator. She translated the German chorale tradition of church hymns for English speakers, for which she is recognized in the calendar of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. She also worked for wider educational opportunities for girls, and translated biographies of two founders of religious sisterhoods. When 16, Winkworth appears to have coined a once well-known political pun, &quot;peccavi&quot;, &quot;I have Sindh&quot;, relating to the British occupation of Sindh in colonial India.

==Early life==
Catherine Winkworth was born on 13 September 1827 at 20 Ely Place, Holborn on the edge of the City of London. She was the fourth daughter of Henry Winkworth, a silk merchant. Henry&#x27;s third daughter, Selina Mary, was the mother of Norman Collie. Another sister Susanna Winkworth (1820–1884) was also a translator, mainly of German devotional works.

In 1829, her family moved to Manchester, where her father had a silk mill and which city figured in the Industrial Revolution. Winkworth studied under the Rev. William Gaskell, minister of Cross Street Chapel, and with Dr. James Martineau, both of them eminent British Unitarians. Urban historian Harold L. Platt notes that in the Victorian period &quot;The importance of membership in this Unitarian congregation cannot be overstated: as the fountainhead of Manchester Liberalism it exerted tremendous influence on the city and the nation for a generation.&quot;

She subsequently moved with the family to Clifton, near Bristol. 

==Chorale tradition==
Catherine Winkworth spent a year in Dresden, during which time she took an interest in German hymnody. Around 1854, she published her book &quot;Lyra Germanica&quot;, a collection of German hymns which she had chosen and translated into English. A further collection followed in 1858. During 1863, she published &quot;The Chorale Book for England&quot;, which was coedited by the composers William Sterndale Bennett and Otto Goldschmidt. In 1869 she followed this with &quot;Christian Singers of Germany&quot;.

According to &quot;The Harvard University Hymn Book&quot;, Winkworth &quot;did more than any other single individual to make the rich heritage of German hymnody available to the English-speaking world.&quot; Four examples of translations by her hand are published in &quot;The Church Hymn Book 1872&quot; (Nos 344, 431, 664 and 807).

Among the best-known chorales translated by Winkworth are &quot;From Heaven Above to Earth I Come&quot; (&quot;Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her&quot;, Martin Luther, 1534); &quot;Wake, Awake, for Night Is Flying&quot; (&quot;Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme&quot;, Philipp Nicolai, 1599); &quot;How Brightly Beams the Morning Star!&quot; (&quot;Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern&quot;, Nicolai, 1597); and the Christmas hymn &quot;A Spotless Rose&quot; (&quot;Es ist ein Ros entsprungen&quot;, anon, 1599). She translated Gerhardt&#x27;s &quot;Die güldne Sonne voll Freud und Wonne&quot; into &quot;The golden sunbeams with their joyous gleams&quot;.

==Women&#x27;s education==
Winkworth was also involved deeply in promoting women&#x27;s education, as the secretary of the Clifton Association for Higher Education for Women, and a supporter of the Clifton High School for Girls, where a school house is named after her, and a member of Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College. She was likewise governor of the Red Maids&#x27; School in Westbury-on-Trym in the city of Bristol.

Winkworth translated biographies of two founders of sisterhoods for the poor and the sick: &quot;Life of Pastor Fliedner&quot;, 1861, and &quot;Life of Amelia Sieveking&quot;, 1863.

Winkworth has been described as &quot;an early feminist&quot;.

==Peccavi==
According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Britain&quot; by Bamber Gascoigne (1993), it was Catherine Winkworth who, learning of General Charles James Napier&#x27;s ruthless and unauthorised, but successful campaign to conquer the Indian province of Sindh, &quot;remarked to her teacher that Napier&#x27;s despatch to the governor-general of India, after capturing Sindh, should have been &quot;Peccavi&quot;&quot; (Latin for &quot;I have sinned&quot;: a pun on &quot;I have Sindh&quot;). She sent her joke to the new humorous magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, which printed it on 18 May 1844. She was then sixteen years old.

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&quot; attributes this to Winkworth, noting that it was assigned to her in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; in May 1954.

The pun has usually been credited to Napier himself. The rumour&#x27;s persistence over the decades led to investigations in Calcutta archives, as well as comments by William Lee-Warner in 1917 and Lord Zetland, Secretary of State for India, in 1936.

==Death==
Catherine Winkworth died suddenly of heart disease near Geneva on 1 July 1878 and was buried in Monnetier, in Upper Savoy. A monument to her memory was erected in Bristol Cathedral. She is commemorated on the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 1 July.

<doc id="1250406" wikidata="Q2495917" url="?curid=1250406" title="University of Tennessee system">
<text>The University of Tennessee System (UT System) is a system of public universities in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It is one of two public university systems, the other being the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR). It consists of four primary campuses in Knoxville, Chattanooga, Pulaski and Martin; a health sciences campus in Memphis; a research institute in Tullahoma; and various extensions throughout the state.

The UT System has a combined student enrollment of more than 49,000 students, over 320,000 living alumni, and a total endowment that tops $1 billion.

==History==
The University of Tennessee was founded in Knoxville as Blount College in 1794. It became East Tennessee College in 1807, and gained university status in 1840. It was designated as the state&#x27;s land-grant institution in 1869, and was renamed the &quot;University of Tennessee&quot; in 1879.

The medical campus, the UT Health Science Center, was founded in Memphis in 1911. An adult education extension center was founded in Nashville in 1947.

In 1927, UT founded the University of Tennessee Junior College, and bought the campus of the defunct Hall-Moody Institute, a Baptist institution in the northwest Tennessee town of Martin, to use for the new college. In 1951, the school began awarding bachelor&#x27;s degrees and became the University of Tennessee Martin Branch. In 1967, the campus was elevated to an autonomous four-year institution under the name of the University of Tennessee at Martin.

In 1968, the UT System was officially formed, with the Knoxville and Martin campuses as primary campuses. That same year, the Tennessee state legislature gave UT permission to establish a campus in Chattanooga, which was the largest city in Tennessee without a public university. The private University of Chattanooga determined that it could not raise enough private capital to compete with a public institution, and agreed to merge with another private school, Chattanooga City College, to form the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 1969.

Also in 1968, UT announced plans to expand the Nashville extension center into a full-fledged University of Tennessee at Nashville. Rita Sanders Geier filed a desegregation lawsuit against the state. Geier contended that if UT were allowed to build a campus in Nashville, where Tennessee State University was located, it would perpetuate a dual system of higher education. As a result, the UT Nashville campus was eventually merged with TSU by court order in 1979.

On December 9, 2020, UT&#x27;s board of trustees unanimously voted in favor of integrating Martin Methodist College into the UT System as UT Southern. This merger is aimed at providing higher education to the residents of rural southern Middle Tennessee. On June 27, 2021 &quot;The Tennessean&quot; reported that MMC had been fully accepted as a system campus, with the tuition to be adjusted accordingly.

==Campuses==
There are six educational units of the university system, four of which are separate universities within this statewide higher education system.

===University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UT)===
UT Knoxville is the flagship campus of the UT System, based in Knoxville. The largest university in the state, it has a current total enrollment of 27,523. UT awarded 6,345 degrees in over 300 programs in the 2009–10 academic year.

While not a separate entity, UT Knoxville operates a campus in Nashville that is part of the UT Knoxville College of Social Work. The Nashville Campus awards the M.S.S.W. in conjunction with UT Knoxville.

===University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC)===
UTC is a large university located in downtown Chattanooga. The university was founded as a private school in 1886, joined the UT System in 1969, and currently has over 10,000 students.

===University of Tennessee at Martin (UTM)===
Located in rural northwest Tennessee in Martin, UT Martin began in 1900 as Hall-Moody Institute, a private Baptist school. In 1927, the Tennessee Baptist Convention merged Hall-Moody Institute with Union University. The University of Tennessee System took over the former Hall-Moody campus and the school became known as The University of Tennessee Junior College in Martin. It operated under this name until 1951 when four-year fields of study leading to bachelor&#x27;s degrees were added. The name was then changed to The University of Tennessee Martin Branch. In 1967, it was designated a primary campus in the UT system and was given its current name, The University of Tennessee at Martin. With approximately 8,000 students, UT Martin comprises the main campus in Martin and four extended campuses located in Parsons, Selmer, Jackson, and Ripley.

===University of Tennessee Southern (UTS)===
As a consequence of a planned meeting between then-Acting System President Randy Boyd (later named the system&#x27;s permanent head) and Martin Methodist College President Mark La Branche in 2020 about the plans for UT to open an Agricultural Extension Office in MMC&#x27;s hometown of Pulaski, a wider-ranging discussion ensued about the low level of affordable higher educational opportunities in Southern Middle Tennessee. MMC was founded as a women&#x27;s college in 1870, but became co-educational in the 1930s. 
In December 2020, The University of Tennessee Board of Trustees voted to accept MMC as a primary campus of the University of Tennessee System. On June 27, 2021 &quot;The Tennessean&quot; reported that the merger had been consummated, with La Branche to serve as the first chancellor of the campus as a unit of the UT system designated the University of Tennessee Southern.

===University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC)===
The University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) has its main campus in Memphis. UTHSC offers a wide variety of degree programs among its six colleges: Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy. In addition to Memphis, the College of Medicine also has campuses in Chattanooga, Knoxville and Nashville; the College of Pharmacy has campuses in Knoxville and Nashville; and the College of Health Professions has a unit in Knoxville. UTHSC has more than 100 additional clinical and educational sites statewide.

===University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI)===
The University of Tennessee Space Institute is located in Tullahoma adjacent to Arnold Air Force Base, long a center of research for the United States Air Force. The Institute awards master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in conjunction with UT Knoxville.

==Other units==

The University of Tennessee system has several other units that provide service to the state of Tennessee and to the nation.

===University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture===

The Institute of Agriculture is composed of the Agricultural Experiment Station, UT Extension, and Knoxville&#x27;s Herbert College of Agriculture and College of Veterinary Medicine. The institute has a presence in all 95 counties through its educational programs in agriculture, home economics, resource development, and 4-H programs.

===University of Tennessee Institute of Public Service===

The Institute for Public Service was created in 1971 as a part of the university &quot;to provide continuing research and technical assistance to state and local government and industry and to meet more adequately the need for information and research in business and government.&quot; Components include the County Technical Assistance Service, the Municipal Technical Advisory Service, the Center for Industrial Services, the Law Enforcement Innovation Center, and the Naifeh Center for Effective Leadership.

===UT-ORNL partnership===

UT Knoxville and Battelle Memorial Institute are 50–50 partners in UT-Battelle, which manages the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the United States Department of Energy.

==Governance==
The University of Tennessee system is governed by the Board of Trustees of the University of Tennessee. After the passage of the UT FOCUS Act in 2018, the board is made up of 12 trustees. These trustees include one ex officio voting member, the Commissioner of Agriculture, 10 voting members appointed by the Governor, and a single non-voting student member appointed by the board as a whole. One of the board&#x27;s committees includes a single faculty representative. Both the Student Trustee and faculty representative rotate each year between the four main campuses.

==Administration==

The university system is administered by a president. Beginning in 1970, presidents served the University of Tennessee system. Prior to that, the president served the Knoxville flagship campus.
Presidents and interim presidents of the University of Tennessee system, the University of Tennessee, and its predecessor schools are as follows:
* Randy Boyd, 2019–present
* Joseph A. DiPietro, named UT System President on October 23, 2010; served until November 2018
* John D. Petersen, named the system&#x27;s 23rd President on July 1, 2004; resigned February 18, 2009
* John W. Shumaker, 2002–2003
* Emerson H. Fly, 2001–2002
* J. Wade Gilley, 1999–2001
* Joseph E. Johnson, 1991–1999; also served as interim president in 2003–2004
* Lamar Alexander, 1988–1991
* Edward J. Boling, 1970–1988
* Andrew D. Holt, 1959–1970; President of the UT System 1968–1970
* C. E. Brehm, 1946–1959
* James Dickason Hoskins, 1934–1946
* Harcourt A. Morgan, 1919–1934
* Brown Ayres, 1904–1919
* Charles W. Dabney, 1887–1904
* Thomas William Humes, (East Tennessee University), 1865–1879; President of UT 1879–1883
* J. J. Ridley (East Tennessee University), 1860–1862
* William D. Carnes (East Tennessee University), 1858–1860
* George Cooke (East Tennessee University), 1853–1857
* W. B. Reese (East Tennessee University), 1850–1853
* Joseph Estabrook, (East Tennessee College), 1834–1840; President of East Tennessee University 1840–1850
* James H. Piper (East Tennessee College), 1833–1834
* Charles Coffin (East Tennessee College), 1827–1832
* David Sherman (East Tennessee College), 1820–1825
* Samuel Carrick, (Blount College), 1794–1807; President of East Tennessee College 1807–1809

Each of the five campuses is administered by a chancellor. Administrators on each campus report to their respective chancellors, who in turn report to the president. The only exceptions are the athletic directors of the Knoxville campus, who report directly to the president and not the Knoxville chancellor.

==Early life and education==
Kettle is the son of two communist activists, Arnold Kettle (best remembered as a literary critic; 1916–1986) and Margot Kettle (née Gale; 1916–1995. Kettle grew up in Far Headingley was educated at Leeds Modern School. He graduated in modern history from Balliol College, Oxford having matriculated in 1967.

==Career==
Kettle worked for the National Council for Civil Liberties (now known as Liberty) as a research officer from 1973. He then began his career in journalism as home affairs correspondent for &quot;New Society&quot; (1977–1981) and moved to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1981, working as a political correspondent for three years. He has been with &quot;The Guardian&quot; since 1984 and also wrote regularly for &quot;Marxism Today&quot; in its later years. He writes a column on classical music in &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine.

Kettle is a long-term contributor to for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, where he is assistant editor, having worked as the newspaper&#x27;s Washington D.C. bureau chief from 1997 to 2001. He was formerly a leader writer (1993–1997) and chief leader writer from 2001 onward. He has often defended New Labour and Tony Blair (a personal friend) – though not over the Iraq War. Kettle has been dismissed by John Pilger as Blair&#x27;s &quot;most devoted promoter&quot;.

<doc id="1250419" wikidata="Q418873" url="?curid=1250419" title="Cummingtonite">
<text>Cummingtonite ( ) is a metamorphic amphibole with the chemical composition , magnesium iron silicate hydroxide.

Monoclinic cummingtonite is compositionally similar and polymorphic with orthorhombic anthophyllite, which is a much more common form of magnesium-rich amphibole, the latter being metastable.

Cummingtonite shares few compositional similarities with alkali amphiboles such as arfvedsonite, glaucophane-riebeckite. There is little solubility between these minerals due to different crystal habit and inability of substitution between alkali elements and ferro-magnesian elements within the amphibole structure.

==Name and discovery==

Cummingtonite was named after the town of Cummington, Massachusetts, where it was discovered in 1824. It is also found in Sweden, South Africa, Scotland, and New Zealand.

==Chemistry==

Cummingtonite is a member of the cummingtonite-grunerite solid solution series which ranges from for magnesiocummingtonite to the iron rich grunerite endmember . Cummingtonite is used to describe minerals of this formula with between 30 and 70 per cent . Thus, cummingtonite is the series intermediate.

Manganese also substitutes for ) within cummingtonite amphibole, replacing B site atoms. These minerals are found in high-grade metamorphic banded iron formation and form a compositional series between (tirodite) and (dannemorite).

Calcium, sodium and potassium concentrations in cummingtonite are low. Cummingtonite tends toward more calcium substitution than related anthophyllite. Similarly, cummingtonite has lower ferric iron and aluminium than anthophyllite.

Amosite is a rare asbestiform variety of grunerite that was mined as asbestos only in the eastern part of the Transvaal Province of South Africa. The origin of the name is &quot;Amosa&quot;, the acronym for the mining company &quot;Asbestos Mines of South Africa&quot;.

==Occurrence==
Cummingtonite is commonly found in metamorphosed magnesium-rich rocks and occurs in amphibolites. Usually it coexists with hornblende or actinolite, magnesium clinochlore chlorite, talc, serpentine-antigorite minerals or metamorphic pyroxene. Magnesium-rich cummingtonite can also coexist with anthophyllite.

Cummingtonite has also been found in some felsic volcanic rocks such as dacites. Manganese rich species can be found in metamorphosed Mn-rich rock units. The grunerite end member is characteristic of the metamorphosed iron formations of the Lake Superior region and the Labrador Trough. With prograde metamorphism cummingtonite and grunerite morph to members of the olivine and pyroxene series.

<doc id="1250427" wikidata="Q1582992" url="?curid=1250427" title="Tanganyika laughter epidemic">
<text>The Tanganyika laughter epidemic of 1962 was an outbreak of mass hysteria—or mass psychogenic illness (MPI)—rumored to have occurred in or near the village of Kashasha on the western coast of Lake Victoria in Tanganyika (which, once united with Zanzibar, became the modern nation of Tanzania) near the border with Uganda.

==History==

The laughter epidemic began on January 30, 1962, at a mission-run boarding school for girls in Kashasha. It started with three girls and spread throughout the school, affecting 95 of the 159 pupils, aged 12–18. Symptoms lasted from a few hours to 16 days, averaging around 7 days. The teaching staff were unaffected and reported that students were unable to concentrate on their lessons. The first outbreak in Kashasha lasted roughly 48 days. The school was forced to close on March 18, 1962. When it reopened on May 21, a second phase of the outbreak affected an additional 57 pupils. The all-girl boarding school reclosed at the end of June.

The epidemic spread to Nshamba of the Muleba District, a village 55 miles west of Bukoba, where several of the girls lived. In April and May 1962, 217 mostly young villagers had laughing attacks over the course of 34 days. The Kashasha school was sued for allowing the children and their parents to transmit it to the surrounding area. In June, the laughing epidemic spread to Ramashenye girls&#x27; middle school, affecting 48 girls. Additional schools and the Kanyangereka village were also affected to some degree. The phenomenon died off 18 months after it started. All areas affected were within a 100-mile radius of Bukoba. In all, 14 schools were shut down and 1,000 people were affected.

==Causes and symptoms==
Symptoms of the Tanganyika &#x27;laughter epidemic&#x27; included laughter and crying, beside general restlessness and pain, as well as fainting, respiratory problems, and rashes. Many of the symptoms experienced were stress-induced due to various external factors. The stress and anxiety that provokes mass hysteria outbreaks are reactions to perceived threats, cultural transitions, instances of uncertainty, and social stressors. Due to the majority of the population affected by this epidemic being young and adolescent children, the outbreak has been attributed to the young not having the appropriate coping skills to manage such stresses and anxieties. Coinciding with this, adolescents have a need for acceptance and are eager to blend into a group, making them vulnerable to influence contagion.

==External factors==
Linguist Christian F. Hempelmann has theorized that the episode was stress-induced. In 1962, Tanganyika had just won its independence, he said, and students had reported feeling stressed because of higher expectations by teachers and parents. Mass Psychogenic Illness (MPI), he says, usually occurs in people without a lot of power. &quot;MPI is a last resort for people of a low status. It&#x27;s an easy way for them to express that something is wrong.&quot;

Sociologist Robert Bartholomew and psychiatrist Simon Wessely both put forward a culture-specific epidemic hysteria hypothesis, pointing out that the occurrences in 1960s Africa were prevalent in missionary schools and Tanganyikan society was ruled by strict traditional elders, so the likelihood is the hysteria was a manifestation of the cultural dissonance between the &quot;traditional conservatism&quot; at home and the new ideas challenging those beliefs in school, which they termed &quot;conversion reactions&quot;.

==Connected events==

The laughter epidemic was one of three sequential behavioral epidemics that occurred in the vicinity of Lake Victoria. These three major epidemics were classified as events of mass hysteria or mania. According to Benjamin H. Kagwa&#x27;s observations in the East African Medical Journal, a notable characteristic is the prevalence of typical symptoms within specific ethnic groups, where the occurrence and propagation of comparable symptoms are aligned with tribal boundaries. As with the hysteria epidemic in Tanganyika, these &quot;manias&quot; are attributed to the radically shifting culture that began to stray away from the traditional cultural beliefs of local tribes and communities.

&quot;We must not, however, think for one moment that this is peculiar to Africans. There is much historical evidence to prove that emotional upheavals associated with hysteria occur whenever a people&#x27;s cultural roots and beliefs become suddenly shattered&quot; -Benjamin H. Kagwa

<text>Jevon Kearse (born September 3, 1976), nicknamed &quot;the Freak&quot;, is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end for eleven seasons in the National Football League (NFL) during the late 1990s and 2000s. Kearse played college football for the Florida Gators, earning All-American honors and was named the SEC Defensive Player of the Year in 1998.

Kearse was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the first round pick of the 1999 NFL draft. He also played for the Philadelphia Eagles for four seasons between his two stints with the Titans. During his first five years with the Titans, he was a three-time Pro Bowl selection and NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year in 1999. His speed (4.43-second 40-yard dash) and wingspan, coupled with a vertical leap, greatly impressed coaches and earned him the nickname &quot;the Freak&quot;.

== Early life ==

Kearse was born on September 3, 1976, in Fort Myers, Florida. He attended North Fort Myers High School in North Fort Myers, and played high school football for the North Fort Myers Red Knights. He was over tall and extremely agile, and added muscle without a loss of speed and agility. Kearse began attracting college recruiters under his coach Wade Hummel. He played strong safety and tight end, and in his first season in high school, he returned four kicks for touchdowns.

Following Kearse&#x27;s senior season in 1994, he was honored as a prep All-American by &quot;USA Today&quot;. In addition to his demonstrated athletic ability on the playing field, he carried a 3.6 grade point average and was a member of the National Honor Society.

== College career ==

Starting college at 6 feet, 4 inches tall, and 215 pounds, Kearse was projected as either a linebacker or defensive back. He accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Steve Spurrier&#x27;s Florida Gators football team from 1995 to 1998. He began his college career at safety before shifting to outside linebacker in 1996. Later in his college career, he would occasionally line up at defensive end during obvious passing situations to intensify the Gators&#x27; pass rush.

The Gators coaches red-shirted Kearse for the 1995 season, and he watched the Gators&#x27; run for the 1995 national championship game from the sidelines. The Gators lost to the Nebraska Cornhuskers 62–24 in the national championship game, marking Florida&#x27;s only loss of the season. He was nicknamed &quot;the Freak&quot; by Southeastern Conference (SEC) opponents during the Gators&#x27; 1996 season. In his debut game against Southwest Louisiana, he accounted for six solo tackles and a sack. The Florida Gators would go on to win the national title, defeating Florida State Seminoles 52–20 in the 1997 Sugar Bowl. For his on-field accomplishments, Kearse was named to the All-SEC Freshman team. In a tragic counterpoint, his younger brother Jermaine was killed in a drive-by-shooting following the season.

Kearse made the All-SEC team in 1997 for the first time by registering a team high 6.5 sacks during the regular season as well as 38 tackles and two forced fumbles. In his 1998 campaign, he once again led the team with 7.5 sacks and also improved his tackles tally to 54. He was named All-SEC again and earned the AP SEC Defensive Player of the Year that season, as well as making the list of several different All-American teams, and was a finalist for the Butkus Award, Lombardi Award, and Chuck Bednarik college defensive player of the year award.

He opted to forgo his final season of eligibility, stating, &quot;I think I&#x27;ve accomplished the four goals I wanted to when I attended the University of Florida: To become a better person, to win a national championship, to get an education and finally to have a chance to play in the NFL.&quot;

During his college career, Kearse made 34.5 tackles for a loss, finishing eleventh on the Gators&#x27; all-time list. He also compiled 145 total tackles, 16.5 quarterback sacks, six forced fumbles, one interception, one recovered fumble, and 19 pass deflections. In an article series written for &quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; in 2006, the &quot;Sun&quot; sportswriters ranked him as #16 among the top 100 greatest Gators from the first 100 years of Florida football.

== Professional career ==

=== Pre-draft ===
Kearse, at 262 pounds, ran a 4.58 second 40-yard dash, 4.24 second 20-yard shuttle, and had a vertical jump of 37 inches at the 1999 NFL Combine. Kearse lowered his 40-yard time to 4.43 at the University of Florida Pro Day in the spring of 1999.

=== Tennessee Titans: 1999–2003 ===

Kearse was drafted by the Tennessee Titans as the 16th pick of the first round. On July 28, 1999, he signed a five-year, $6.1 million contract; however, according to NFLPA records he earned incentives that increased Kearse&#x27;s compensation in his first five years to nearly $9 million. He was the first player drafted by the Tennessee Titans; who had previously been the Houston Oilers.

In Kearse&#x27;s debut game with the Titans, he helped them achieve a 36–35 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. Steve McNair had been injured, and with backup quarterback Neil O&#x27;Donnell in his place, Kearse helped lead the Titans to win the next four out of five games. In the first month of his NFL career, he was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Month.

For all but one month of the season, he was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Month, and ended up becoming NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year with the help of his rookie record-breaking performance with 14.5 sacks (which led the AFC) that year and forced eight fumbles, which also led the NFL. He also recorded 57 tackles and he batted away nine passes while also making seven of his tackles for losses. He accounted for two sacks (quarterback Rob Johnson) and two forced fumbles in the AFC wild card game vs. the Buffalo Bills. He was also credited with a safety in that game known as the &quot;Music City Miracle.&quot; Kearse was also second in the balloting for the AP Defensive Player of the Year, losing out to Warren Sapp. He was a consensus All-Pro and was the first rookie defensive end in AFC history and the first rookie DE in the NFL since Detroit&#x27;s Al &quot;Bubba&quot; Baker in 1978 to be named a Pro Bowl starter. That year, the Titans made it to Super Bowl XXXIV in which he started; however, they lost to the Kurt Warner-led St. Louis Rams.

The next season, Kearse accounted for fewer sacks (11.5) but stated that he was playing better than his rookie season. The Titans lost their Divisional playoff games to the Baltimore Ravens who ended up winning the Super Bowl that season. Kearse also lost the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award to Ray Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens. In addition, he totaled 53 tackles (six for losses), forced four fumbles, had six pass deflections, and was again voted to the Pro Bowl.

In 2001, Kearse moved from left defensive end to right defensive end as the Titans traded for Kevin Carter. Kearse responded well and recorded 10 sacks, forced three fumbles, batted two passes while recording 36 tackles. Kearse was voted to his third consecutive Pro Bowl with the Titans in 2001. In 2002, Kearse fractured the fifth metatarsal in his left foot on the second play from scrimmage against the Eagles in the season opener and was inactive for the next 12 games. Due to the injury Kearse recorded only two sacks, playing in only four games (starting one), as the Titans returned to the AFC championship game but lost to Oakland.

In 2003, Kearse recorded 9.5 sacks through the first nine games but was shut out the final seven games (he missed two due to a sprained ankle injury). He also played a key role on the 2003 Titans who made the playoffs and won their first-round game against Baltimore before losing a hard-fought divisional match against the eventual world champion New England Patriots.

=== Philadelphia Eagles: 2004–2007 ===

After his 2003 campaign, Kearse was unable to reach an agreement with the Titans after his contract expired, and thus became an unrestricted free agent. The Philadelphia Eagles signed Kearse to a record-breaking deal for a defensive lineman at the time; in all, the eight-year contract would pay Kearse $65 million, with a $16 million signing bonus.

Kearse played well with the Eagles in 2004, but his tackle and sack totals were not as high as he had previously achieved in his career with the Titans. He was, however, still a defensive force, and figured into the game plans of opposing offenses. During 2004, Philadelphia finished the season with a 13–3 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. After eliminating the Minnesota Vikings and the Atlanta Falcons, the Eagles lost Super Bowl XXXIX 24–21 to the New England Patriots.

In 2005, Kearse had a solid year similar to the year before, yet his team fell to a 6–10 record. During the season, starters like Donovan McNabb, Brian Westbrook, Hank Fraley, Tra Thomas, Lito Sheppard, and others were out with injuries, and star wide receiver Terrell Owens was suspended from the team nine games into the season. He recorded 7.5 sacks for the second season in a row (also leading the Eagles in sacks for the second straight season), but in 2005 he batted down 8 passes and forced 3 fumbles.

2006 would be a short season for Kearse who recorded 3.5 sacks in the first two games of the season before a severe knee injury. It was feared that he tore several ligaments in his knee, as well as dislocating his kneecap, tearing his knee capsule, straining his quadriceps tendon, and injuring his hamstring, during an overtime game against the New York Giants in week 2 of the NFL season. When he went into surgery, however, doctors were surprised to see that almost everything in his knee was intact, except for a tear to the lateral meniscus cartilage and a fracture to his tibia. The injury was downgraded from possibly career-ending to just a 12-week recovery.

However, Kearse did not appear to have regained his burst on the line and, in light of substandard production, he lost his starting job to longtime teammate Juqua Thomas in Week 11 of the 2007 NFL season. Due to this lack of production, along with the expensive contract Kearse carried, many predicted that he would be cut by the start of the 2008 season. This speculation turned out to be well-founded; he was released by the team on February 28, 2008, voiding the final three years of his contract. In his four years with Philadelphia, Kearse earned nearly $29.2 million of his record-setting 2004 contract.

=== Tennessee Titans: 2008–2009 ===

On March 6, 2008, Kearse returned to the Titans by signing with the team as a free agent. Kearse signed a two-year, $6 million deal, with a $1.3 million signing bonus. He earned a total of $3 million in the first year. Kearse started all 16 games in 2008, finishing with 3.5 sacks. During the 2009 season, Jeff Fisher decided to bench Kearse for William Hayes.

=== NFL statistics ===

==Personal life==
Kearse has been a resident of Moorestown, New Jersey.

His nephew, Jayron Kearse, plays football in the NFL.

<text>The Würzburg Residence (German: &quot;Würzburger Residenz&quot;) is a palace in Würzburg, Germany. Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt and Maximilian von Welsch, representatives of the Austrian/Southern German Baroque style, were involved in the construction, as well as Robert de Cotte and Germain Boffrand, who were followers of the French style. Balthasar Neumann, court architect of the Bishop of Würzburg, was the principal architect of the Residence, which was commissioned by the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn and his brother Friedrich Carl von Schönborn in 1720, and completed in 1744. The Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, assisted by his son, Domenico, painted frescoes in the building.

Interiors considered masterworks of Baroque/Rococo or Neoclassical architecture and art include the grand staircase, the chapel, and the Imperial Hall. The building was reportedly called the &quot;largest parsonage in Europe&quot; by Napoleon. It was heavily damaged by British bombing during World War II, and restoration has been in progress since 1945. Since 1981, the Residence has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site in recognition of its outstanding Baroque art, design, and architecture.

== History==

===18th century===

The Prince-Bishops of Würzburg resided in the Marienberg Fortress on a hill west of the Main river until the early 18th century. Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn (1719–24) moved the court to a palace erected in 1701–4, the predecessor of the Residence. However, the rather small palace did not, in his opinion, measure up to his position as an absolute monarch – he was looking for something comparable to the Palace of Versailles or Schönbrunn Palace. Having won a sum of 600,000 florins (a fortune at the time) in a court case in the year of his accession, he used the funds to undertake a building project that would proclaim his political standing to all.

In this, he was eagerly supported by two relatives, his uncle the Archbishop of Mainz and Elector of Mainz, Lothar Franz von Schönborn (who confessed to having been possessed by a &quot;Bauwurm&quot;, a building bug) and his brother Friedrich Carl von Schönborn, from 1704 to 1734 Imperial Vice-Chancellor in Vienna. Both supplied ideas and, crucially, artists from their circles. Friedrich Carl had met Hildebrandt in Vienna during the construction of the Belvedere. The foundation stone was laid on 22 May 1720. The construction started with the north block.

However, Johann Phillip Franz&#x27; successor, Prince-Bishop Christoph Franz von Hutten (1724–9) had no great interest in building such an enormous palace. He only wanted the northern block to be finished. This construction was concluded in the year of his death. All other works ceased.


In the year 1730, however, under Prince-Bishop Friedrich Carl von Schönborn (1729–46), work on the south block began once more. In 1732–33, the front of the &quot;Cour d&#x27;honneur&quot; was completed. From 1735 onwards, the work on the central building took place with the participation of Lucas von Hildebrandt. In 1737, the main staircase by Balthasar Neumann was constructed. The garden front was completed in 1740 and the whole shell in December 1744. Neumann was mostly responsible for the Residence&#x27;s town front, while Hildebrandt&#x27;s work dominated the garden side. The four interior courts of the side wings were an idea of von Welsch.

The completion of the vaulted ceilings over the Emperor&#x27;s Hall and the White Hall took place in 1742; the vault over the staircase in 1743. At the same time, the decorations of the Court Chapel were realized and its consecration was performed in 1743. From 1740 to 1745, the southern &quot;Kaiserzimmer&quot; (Imperial Apartments) and the Mirror Cabinet (&quot;Spiegelkabinett&quot;) were decorated by ornamental carver Ferdinand Hundt, by Johann Wolfgang van der Auvera, and Johann Rudolf Byss. Bossi also created the stucco-work in the White Hall during the years 1744–45.

Under the rule of Prince-Bishop Anselm Franz von Ingelheim (1746–49), all building work on the Residence ceased once again. After his death, once Karl Philipp von Greifenclau zu Vollraths (1749–54) became Prince-Bishop, he ordered a resumption of construction. In the same year, Antonio Bossi completed the stucco-work in the Garden Hall, the painting of which was finished in the next year. In 1750, Lorenz Jakob Mehling, a merchant at Venice, sent Giovanni Battista Tiepolo to the bishopric residence, after the painter Giuseppe Visconti had failed. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, assisted by his sons, decorated the Imperial Hall and the ceiling above the staircase with frescoes in the early 1750s. In 1753, Balthasar Neumann died.

Under Prince-Bishop Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim (1755–79), and Ludovico Bossi created the stucco-work decoration over the staircase and in the first and second guest rooms of the northern &quot;Kaiserzimmer&quot; (Imperial Apartments) between 1769 and 1772. At the same time, the Green Lacquered Room and the Neoclassical &quot;Fürstensaal&quot; (Princes&#x27; Hall) were finished. From 1776 to 1781, the &quot;Ingelheimer Räume&quot; (Ingelheim Rooms) were decorated, including stucco-work by Materno Bossi.

The total construction cost came to over 1.5 million guilders, at a time when a day labourer could expect a weekly wage of one guilder.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
The episcopal principality of Würzburg was abolished with secularization in 1802/03. An eight-year interregnum by Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany (reigned 1806–1814) followed, during which he had several rooms of the south block, the so-called &quot;Toskanaräume&quot; (Tuscany Rooms), decorated in Empire style. Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte slept in the Residence when he stopped in Würzburg three times between 1806 and 1813. On 2 October 1806 he signed the declaration of war against Prussia here. A Neoclassical double bed and bedside tables were installed in the sleeping room of the northern Imperial Apartments for him and his wife Marie Louise in 1812.

In 1814, Würzburg became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The wrought-iron gates across the &quot;Cour d&#x27;honneur&quot;, which had effectively separated this inner area from the large Residence Square, were demolished in 1821. In their place today is the &quot;Frankoniabrunnen&quot; (fountain) created by Ferdinand von Miller the Younger. This was unveiled in 1894 as a tribute by the city of Würzburg and the whole of Franconia to Prince Regent Luitpold, who was born in 1821 in the Würzburg Residence itself.

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert stayed at the Residence on their way to Schloss Rosenau, Coburg, in August 1845. In 1921, the Residence was opened to the public.

===Destruction in World War II===
As a result of a devastating British air raid on 16 March 1945, the residence was almost completely burnt out and only the central building with the Vestibule, Garden Hall, Staircase, White Hall and Imperial Hall survived the inferno, their roofs destroyed. From the attic the fire ate down through wooden ceilings and floors, and all the furnishings and wall panelling which had not been stored elsewhere were devoured by the flames. 

Much of the furnishing and large sections of the wall panelling of the period rooms had been removed in time and thus escaped destruction. Neumann&#x27;s stone vaults withstood the collapse of the burning attic. However, because the roofs had gone, further damage was incurred in the ensuing period due to dampness. In the Court Chapel, for example, most of the ceiling frescoes by Byss succumbed to the subsequent consequences of the fire, in spite of the intact vault, and had to be laboriously reconstructed.

===Post-war rebuilding===

From 1945 to 1987, the building and its interiors were reconstructed to their current state. The rebuilding cost about €20m.

===Inclusion in UNESCO World Heritage List===
The Würzburg Residence with its Court Gardens and Residence Square was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1981. According to the Advisory Body Evaluation, the inclusion in the List was a &quot;measure... so clearly desirable that the proposal of the Federal Republic of Germany does not require lengthy justification... The Residence is at once the most homogeneous and the most extraordinary of the Baroque palaces... It represents a unique artistic realization by virtue of its ambitious program, the originality of creative spirit and the international character of its workshop.&quot;

==Description==
===Architectural plan===
===Exterior===
The Residence was constructed on a base plate of 92 × 167 meters. The main structure consists of a central wing with two side wings, the north and south blocks, each with two interior courts. On the town side the side wings extend 55 m from the main structure, partially enclosing the &quot;Cour d&#x27;honneur&quot;. Beneath the mansard roof there is a cornice, decorated with vases and trophies. The façade around the main portal in the &quot;Cour d&#x27;honneur&quot; is particularly richly decorated. It lacks the lower mezzanine floor (see below) but sports a large balcony above the three portals accessible from the &quot;Weisser Saal&quot; (White Hall). Above the entrance a large coat-of-arms of Friedrich Carl von Schönborn is located. The &quot;Hofkirche&quot; (court chapel) is completely integrated into the western part of the southern wing and barely distinguishable from the outside.

Originally, the &quot;Cour d&#x27;honneur&quot; was limited by a wrought iron enclosure. This masterpiece of ironworks by Joh. Georg Oegg was demolished in 1821 and sold at auction, because a member of the family of the King of Bavaria did not like them.

The outdoor square in front of the Residence today measures around 200 meters by 100 meters and is mostly used for parking. The monumental :de:Frankoniabrunnen fountain from 1894 is located in the square.

===Interior===
The Residence has four floors, a high-ceiling ground and upper floor with a mezzanine floor above each. These served to enliven the façade and offered room for servants&#x27; quarters, kitchens and administrative offices.

The residence has almost 400 rooms.

====Staircase====
In Baroque style, the staircase gained importance as part of a formal reception room. The staircase of the Würzburg Residence spans its vault, an area of 18 × 32 meters, without pillars. Beneath an unsupported trough vault, a masterpiece of construction with a maximum height of 23 meters.

The lowest part of the stair leads away from the reception hall, towards a blank wall and then splits into two stairs which double back. Thus, the host on the upper landing was able to see his visitors first who initially walked away from him. When the guests turned and approached, the vast ceiling fresco above was increasingly revealed to them.

This fresco, the largest in the world, created from 1750 to 1753 by Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo shows paintings of the four continents: Europe, America, Asia and Africa. Each continent is represented by a typical landscape and animals (or the painter&#x27;s vision of these animals) and a female allegorical figure. Europe holds a sceptre, is symbolized by a bull, and has a boy playing with a cannon. America has natives with feathers, who practice cannibalism of prisoners, and a crocodile. Asia has a tiger and elephant, the crosses of Golgotha are visible in the background. Africans have a camel, and a caravan of turbanned Magi. Tiepolo was helped in his labors by his son Giandomenico and the stuccoist Antonio Bossi. There is also a picture of the Prince-Bishop with Mercury approaching from Olympus while Apollo launches the sun horses, surrounded by incarnations of the stars. The fresco also shows Tiepolo himself (in the southwest corner) and Neumann, in the center of the southern front, leaning on a cannon.

In preparation for his rendering of the large fresco, Tiepolo sketched a scaled-down version of the work; this sketch is on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Court architect Balthasar Neumann had to fight concerns about the dangers of such an enormous vault. Contrary to the vault with its colors, the stairs and the walls have hardly any decoration at all. While the vault is decorated in the Baroque style, the rest of the staircase is already decorated in the following Neoclassical style.

Neumann originally wanted to add a second staircase on the other side of the White Hall, but this was vetoed by the Prince-Bishop&#x27;s advisers due to the costs involved.

The staircase was depicted on the back of the final version of 50 Deutsche Mark banknotes, which featured Neumann on the front.

====White Hall====
The &quot;Weisser Saal&quot; or White Hall in Rococo style was the audience chamber and is dominated by the stucco decorations of Antonio Bossi. The white stucco works on a light gray background are composed of a large quantity of rocailles, mixed with images of real items, especially of military purpose.

The lack of gold and colour allows the eye to rest between the splendours of the staircase and the &quot;Kaisersaal&quot; beyond. Five crystal chandeliers were used to light the room.

====Imperial Hall or &quot;Kaisersaal&quot;====

This hall opens to the east from the White Hall and is located in the center of the garden front. It was used to receive visiting dignitaries, including the Emperors-to-be on their voyage to Frankfurt and on the return trip to Vienna. It was created in 1749–51 at enormous cost.

The walls of the Imperial Hall consist of stucco work marble in shades of red, white and yellow. The dome is painted in white colour, decorated with golden stucco work and also frescoes by Tiepolo, showing an idealized history of the diocese of Würzburg. One picture, &quot;Die Trauung Kaiser Barbarossas und der Beatrix von Burgund durch den Würzburger Fürstbischof 1156&quot; shows the marriage of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and Countess Beatrix of Burgundy, consecrated by Gerold, Bishop of Würzburg. The opposite picture shows Frederick II appointing the Bishop of Würzburg Duke of Franconia. On top of the dome a painting shows the &quot;Brautfahrt&quot;: Apollo in the sun chariot leads the bride Beatrix surrounded by Venus, Ceres and Bacchus towards the Emperor Frederick II, who is accompanied by the Bishop of Würzburg.

Giovanni&#x27;s son Domenico created the supraportes: Emperor Justinian I publishes the , Emperor Constantine the Great orders the execution of Gallus, Ambrose denies access to the church to Emperor Theodosius I. Bossi&#x27;s figures show Poseidon and Juno as well as Flora and Apollo.

====Southern and Northern Imperial Apartments or &quot;Kaiserzimmer&quot;====
When all the doors are opened between these halls they create an enfilade stretching along the garden front extending a total of 150 meters. These rooms served as reception halls and as accommodation for important guests.

The impact of both apartments is generated by a sequence of rooms of increasing degrees of decoration. The most decorated room of the Southern Apartment is the &quot;Spiegelsaal&quot; or Mirror Cabinet. Its walls consist entirely of glass panels, decorated on the back using either paintings, or drawings engraved into a gold ground and then underlaid with dark gloss paint. All the paintings and drawings show oriental, especially Chinese, scenes. The southern part also includes the &quot;Toskanasaal&quot;. The highlight of the Northern Apartment is the Green Lacquered Room. Its multilayered wall coverings consist of a metallic green color decorated with paintings and golden ornaments.

====Court Chapel (&quot;Hofkirche&quot;)====
The Court Chapel is a prime example of the sacral Baroque style in Germany. The interior design is dominated by the curving walls and three intergradient oval dome vaults.

It extends upwards through both of the main floors of the Residence. The supporting columns are made from agate-coloured marble. The columns of the two side altars and the six statues are made from white marble, carved at Genoa. The side altars are based on designs by Hildebrandt and were painted in 1752 by Tiepolo (Assumption of Mary to the south, War in Heaven to the north). The high altar is made from stucco created to look like marble by Antonio Bossi. Above the altar is a matroneum with a statue of the Immaculate Conception in the centre and oratories on both sides. Bossi was also responsible for the colourful stucco work on the ceiling (1735) and with painters Högler and Thalhofer created the frescoes in the domes (1735–6): martyrdom of the three Franconian apostles Kilian, Totnan and Kolonat (over the choir), Coronation of the Virgin (in the centre) and War in Heaven (above the organ).

===Court Gardens===

The Residence was built when Würzburg was still a fortified town. Therefore, the garden had to be planned within the fortifications. The solution included two bastions of the fortified town wall, using its differences in height to create a very special landscape. From west to east there is a rise in ground, until the level of the wall is reached. Near the residence itself, the &quot;Hofgarten&quot; (or Court Gardens) is designed in a very formal, Baroque style. Farther away, the style changes to an English garden with small forests and meadows. Designs for the former part were made by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt, Neumann and François de Cuvilliés. It was mainly created in 1759–70. Johann Peter Alexander Wagner added putti, vases, urns and two monumental sculpture groups, the Rape of Europa and the abduction of Proserpina, sited in the central axis between the Orangery and the southern pavilion of the Residence. The figures were added to the park under Prince-Bishop Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, who had the park at Veitshöchheim similarly decorated. Three monumental gates lead to the Court Gardens, commissioned by Friedrich Karl von Schönborn from Joh. Georg Oegg.

==Today==
The gardens and representative rooms described above are open to the public. A memorial room is dedicated to the Residence&#x27;s destruction in March 1945. It also honours Major John Davis Skilton, a &quot;Monuments man&quot; of the U.S. Army who was instrumental in preserving many of the art treasures after his arrival at Würzburg in June 1945.

Most of the rest of the residence is occupied by the Martin von Wagner Museum (moved here in 1963) and organizations of the University of Würzburg.

Some scenes of the 2011 film &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; were filmed at Würzburg Residence.

<text>The University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) is a public medical school in Memphis, Tennessee. It includes the Colleges of Health Professions, Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy. Since 1911, the University of Tennessee Health Science Center has educated nearly 57,000 health care professionals. As of 2010, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the College of Pharmacy 17th among American pharmacy schools.

Graduate medical education programs are located in Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Nashville; family medicine centers in Jackson, Knoxville, and Memphis; dentistry clinics in Bristol, Jackson, and Union City, as well as public and continuing education programs across the state. The Health Science Center is part of the statewide, multi-campus University of Tennessee system.

The University of Tennessee Health Science Center also runs the Plough Center for Sterile Drug Delivery Systems, which celebrated its 53-year anniversary in 2016. The center educates on sterile product preparation, develops a basis for parenteral medications, and provides services to the pharmaceutical industry and individuals. Hands-on training in aseptic processing is also offered four times a year at the facility.

Areas of emphasis are the university&#x27;s research efforts, which receive nearly $100 million in yearly grants from the National Institutes of Health and private foundations. The Translational Science Research Building and the Cancer Research Building house collaborative research teams for the UTHSC campus.

In its early years the school was segregated, and it desegregated in the early 1960s. The first black student, Alvin Crawford, graduated in 1964.

==Colleges and institutes==
The University of Tennessee Health Science Center includes six colleges.

===College of Dentistry===

Founded in 1878, the college is the oldest dental school in the South. It has more than 7,600 alumni. An estimated 75 percent of practicing dentists in Tennessee are alumni of the UTHSC College of Dentistry. Since Arkansas does not have a dentistry graduate program, several practicing dentists in Arkansas are also UTHSC graduates.
The college offers a full range of advanced training in prosthodontics, oral surgery, endodontics, periodontics, orthodontics, and pediatric dentistry, and a two-year program in dental hygiene.

===College of Graduate Health Sciences===
Founded in 1928, the college offers programs in advanced graduate degrees in programs including biomedical engineering and imaging, dental science (master&#x27;s only), epidemiology (master&#x27;s only), health outcomes and policy research, biomedical sciences (master&#x27;s only), integrated program in biomedical sciences (PhD), nursing, pharmaceutical sciences, pharmacology (master&#x27;s), and speech and hearing science.

===College of Health Professions===
Founded in 1972, the college has more than 9,000 alumni. It offers programs of study in audiology and speech pathology on the Knoxville campus and clinical laboratory sciences, health informatics and information management (online program), occupational therapy, and physical therapy on the Memphis campus. The college offers traditional, online, and distance learning.

===College of Medicine===
With more than 16,000 alumni, 25 departments on the Memphis campus, nine departments on the Knoxville campus, ten departments on the Chattanooga campus, and 84 Graduate Medical Education training programs, the UTHSC College of Medicine is the largest medical school in the state of Tennessee. Students train on the Memphis campus in their first two years and then rotate across the three campuses during their clinical training. The College of Medicine also trains Physician Assistants. The University of Tennessee Health Science Center currently is the only state-supported Physician Assistant program in the state of Tennessee.

The UTHSC pediatric residency program is affiliated with Le Bonheur Children&#x27;s Medical Center, and residents in pediatrics, radiology, and other fields spend time working at St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis.

Areas of excellence include the Center for Addiction Sciences, which was named in 2016 as the first center of excellence in addiction medicine in the country by the Addiction Medicine Foundation, three trauma centers, a burn center, a transplant institute, and a maternal-fetal medicine institute.

The college also has a clinical practice, University Clinical Health.

===College of Nursing===
Tracing its history to 1898, making it the oldest nursing college in the state of Tennessee, the UTHSC College of Nursing offers three degree programs: BSN, DNP, and PhD.

The college also offers RNs the option to earn the BSN degree online. The college has more than 5,400 alumni and an estimated 2,000 practicing nurses in the state of Tennessee.

===College of Pharmacy===
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; has ranked the college as one of the top 20 pharmacy schools in the country as of 2010. It is the top-ranked school in the state of Tennessee. Founded in 1898, the college has campuses in Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville. Degrees offered are the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), Doctor of Philosophy in Pharmaceutical Sciences (PhD), dual PharmD/PhD, dual PharmD/Master of Health Informatics and Information Management, and dual PharmD/Master of Business Administration.

===Hamilton Eye Institute===

The Hamilton Eye Institute, located in Memphis, is the department of ophthalmology. It opened in 2004 in an eight-story building donated to the University of Tennessee by Baptist Memorial Hospital-Memphis. The capital campaign to establish the institute was initiated by department chair Barrett G. Haik, MD, FACS, and led by Robert B. Carter, chief information officer and executive vice-president of FedEx Information Services. The institute was named for the family of Ralph S. Hamilton, MD, a professor, and physician with the department, who contributed $6 million toward its construction. The mission of the institute is to provide advanced treatments for eye care, foster interplay of ideas among researchers, and transfer skills and knowledge to the next generation of ophthalmic physicians and researchers.

<doc id="1250469" wikidata="Q359126" url="?curid=1250469" title="Brian Westbrook">
<text>Brian Collins Westbrook (born September 2, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 2002 NFL draft after playing college football for the Villanova Wildcats. Following an eight-year career with the Eagles, in which he earned two Pro Bowl selections in 2004 and 2007, Westbrook signed with the San Francisco 49ers, for whom he played in 2010.

Westbrook served as the director of player engagement for the XFL until its merger with the United States Football League (USFL), to form the United Football League (UFL) in 2024.

== Early life ==
Westbrook attended DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland and was an excellent student and a letterman in football and basketball. In football, as a senior, he was a first-team All-League selection, a first-team All-Prince George&#x27;s County selection, and an All-State Honorable Mention selection. As a junior, he was a first-team All-Washington Catholic Athletic Conference selection and an All-State Honorable Mention selection.

==College career==
Westbrook played for the Villanova Wildcats football team while attending Villanova University from 1997 to 2001. Though he battled through several injuries, he holds the all-time National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record with 9,512 all-purpose yards, breaking the 9,301 yards accumulated by Brian Shay of the Emporia State Hornets. In 46 career games, he scored 542 points with 84 touchdowns, carried the ball 725 times for 4,298 yards (6.2 average), caught 219 passes for 2,582 yards (11.79 average) and gained 2,289 yards and four touchdowns on kickoff returns. Along the way, he established 41 school, 13 Atlantic 10 Conference, and five NCAA records.

Westbrook became the only player in I-AA history to score 160 or more points in two different seasons and the first player in the history of college football at any level with 1,000 rushing and 1,000 receiving yards in one season (1998). He is one of only three players in Villanova history to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season and he accomplished that feat three times.

Westbrook was a consensus I-AA All-America and two-time Atlantic 10 offensive player of the year and was the 2001 recipient of the Walter Payton Award (as the top player in NCAA Division I-AA). As a senior, he amassed 2,823 combined net yards and scored 29 touchdowns.

Westbrook was inducted to the Villanova University Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 2016.

Westbrook was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2023. He was also inducted into the Senior Bowl Hall of Fame on June 25 of that same year.

==Professional career==
Despite his dominance in college, NFL teams were hesitant to draft him in the 2002 NFL draft for three reasons: his small size (he was listed at only 5&#x27;8&quot;, 200 lb (91 kg)), his injury history (he missed an entire college season with a knee injury), and the fact that he did not play college football for an NCAA Division I-A school. Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid liked what he had seen from Westbrook and drafted him in the third round with the 91st overall pick.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
Westbrook saw limited time in the 2002 season, but he threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Todd Pinkston on a trick play in a September 2002 rout of the Dallas Cowboys. He made his historical mark in the NFL in the 2003 season with a fourth quarter punt return for a touchdown to defeat the New York Giants 14–10 in the closing minutes on October 19, 2003. The play managed to turn the Eagles&#x27; season around as they went to the NFC Championship Game. Westbrook, who scored 11 touchdowns by ground and air, missed the playoffs that year after tearing a triceps muscle in the final game of the season against the Washington Redskins.

After the departure of previous starter Duce Staley and a pre-season injury to Correll Buckhalter, Westbrook became the starting running back for 2004. He rushed for a career-high 812 yards, led all NFL running backs in receiving with 73 receptions for 703 yards, and scored nine touchdowns, creating numerous problems with opposing teams&#x27; defenses and helping to propel the Eagles to a 13–3 season. In the playoffs, Westbrook had 117 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown in a 27–14 win against the Vikings, and 135 yards from scrimmage in the NFC Championship win against the Falcons.

Westbrook and the Eagles would go on to play in the city&#x27;s first Super Bowl in 25 years. He would have a solid performance in Philadelphia&#x27;s Super Bowl loss to the New England Patriots, rushing for 44 yards, catching seven passes for 60 yards, and scoring one touchdown. He also played in his first Pro Bowl the following week.

Westbrook signed a five-year contract extension with the Eagles in November 2005, after holding out of training camp and months of hectic negotiations. On December 6, 2005, with over 1,200 total yards rushing and receiving, it was announced that Westbrook would miss the rest of the 2005 season due to a mid-foot injury he sustained during a 42–0 Monday night loss to the Seattle Seahawks. During the 2005 season, numerous Eagles starters battled injuries throughout the entire year, and the team finished 6-10 just one year removed from their Super Bowl berth.

Westbrook resumed his productivity in 2006, despite early injury concerns over a swollen knee. With a season-ending injury to McNabb on November 19, 2006, Westbrook stepped up and became the keystone of the Philadelphia offense. On November 26, 2006, he became the first Eagle to rush for over 100 yards in three straight games since Wilbert Montgomery did it 25 years earlier.

Westbrook set a career-high in rushing yards with 1,217, topping 1,000 yards for the first time in his career. He also led the team with 77 receptions for 699 receiving yards. His 11 total touchdowns (seven rushing and four receiving) were also tops on the Eagles. On January 7, 2007, Westbrook set a career-postseason rushing record, rushing for 141 yards on 20 carries against the New York Giants, including a 49-yard touchdown. The following week against the New Orleans Saints, Westbrook nearly willed the team to another playoff victory, scoring two touchdowns in the game.
After his strong playoff performance, Westbrook picked up right where he left in 2007 and cemented himself as one of the top backs in the league. He had over 100 yards rushing and receiving combined in 12 of the 15 games that he played. His 1,333 rushing yards were a new career high and his 2,104 yards from scrimmage led the NFL. Westbrook was named to his second Pro Bowl and first All-Pro team, after setting a new single-season franchise record with 90 receptions.

On August 8, 2008, Westbrook signed a five-year, $32 million extension with the Eagles, with the possibility of earning another $3 million after the first three seasons if incentives are met. On September 15, 2008, in a Monday night loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Westbrook caught one touchdown and rushed for two more, making him only the seventh player in NFL history to rush for 30 and catch 25 touchdowns in his career. On October 26, 2008, coming off a rib and ankle injury, Westbrook did not show any rust whatsoever against Atlanta Falcons on Sunday in his first action since Week 5, recording a career-high 167 yards and two touchdowns off 22 carries and adding 42 yards off six receptions. Then in week 13, he scored two receiving and two rushing touchdowns with 100+ yards, the first time since 1975.

Westbrook entered the 2009 season finally recovered from the injuries he sustained in 2008, but would see only seven starts during season, due to additional injuries suffered. In week 7, Westbrook suffered a concussion and would not return until week 10, when he would suffer yet another concussion and be forced to miss the majority of the remainder of the season, being played sparingly in the consecutive losses to Dallas in the season finale and wild-card round.

Westbrook was released by the Eagles on March 5, 2010.

===San Francisco 49ers===
Westbrook signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers including $1.25 million guaranteed on August 16, 2010. The 49ers&#x27; decision to sign Westbrook came after the sudden retirement of second year backup running back Glen Coffee. On November 29, 2010, during the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game versus the Arizona Cardinals, starting halfback Frank Gore fractured his hip, ending his season. Filling in for the injured Gore, Westbrook carried the ball 23 times for 136 yards and 1 touchdown. Westbrook finished the 2010 season with 77 rushes for 340 yards for a 4.4 average and 4 touchdowns, plus 16 catches for 150 yards and another score, having played in 14 games, starting 5 of them.

===Retirement===
On August 28, 2012, it was announced that Westbrook would retire as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles; his retirement was made official the next day at a live press conference. Westbrook was subsequently honored by the Eagles at halftime of their game against the Washington Redskins on December 23, 2012; the team also named him as honorary captain for the game. Westbrook began the 2013 season as a panel member on &quot;Eagles Post Game Live&quot; on the Comcast Sportsnet Network, along with Michael Barkann, Ed Rendell, and Ray Didinger.

On October 19, 2015, Westbrook was inducted to the Eagles Hall of Fame during Monday Night Football versus the New York Giants.

==Personal life==
Westbrook has a younger brother, Byron Westbrook, who played defensive back at Salisbury University in Maryland and signed as an undrafted free agent with the Washington Redskins in 2007. Their cousin, Lawrence Westbrook, played basketball at the University of Minnesota. His second cousin, Jamire Westbrook plays for the Miami University in Ohio football team as a running back. Although it has been reported in various media biographies that Westbrook is the cousin of NBA player Russell Westbrook of the Los Angeles Lakers, this is not the case. A July 2008 &quot;Daily Oklahoman&quot; article reported that Russell Westbrook said the two are not cousins. On March 16, 2013, it was reported that Westbrook was experiencing memory loss. Brian is currently a correspondent for CSN Philly.

<text>The Booker T. Washington National Monument is a National Monument near the community of Hardy, Virginia, and is located entirely in rural Franklin County, Virginia. It preserves portions of the 207-acre (0.90 km2) tobacco farm on which educator and leader Booker T. Washington was born into slavery on April 5, 1856. It provides interpretation of Washington&#x27;s life and achievements, as well as interpretation of 1850s slavery and farming through the use of buildings, gardens, crafts and animals.

Congress authorized the Booker T. Washington Memorial half dollar to fund the purchase of the site. This commemorative half dollar was the first US coin to feature an African American, and was minted from 1946 to 1951 at three different mints. 18 varieties of the coin were produced, and more than 1.5 million were sold (primarily to collectors). Yet, after the coin&#x27;s production was finished, the BTW Commission owed more money than it had assets, and the Commonwealth of Virginia had to step in to provide funds to purchase the site.

The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 and designated a National Monument on April 2, 1956.
