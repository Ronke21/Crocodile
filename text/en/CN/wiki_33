<text>&quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; is a song by American alternative rock band R.E.M. from their ninth studio album, &quot;Monster&quot; (1994). The song&#x27;s title refers to an incident in New York City in 1986 in which two then-unknown assailants attacked journalist Dan Rather while repeating &quot;Kenneth, what is the frequency?&quot;

The song was the first single taken from the album and was released by Warner Bros. on September 5, 1994. It peaked at number 21 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number two in Canada, number four in New Zealand, and number nine on the UK Singles Chart. In Iceland, it peaked at number one for four weeks. It was the first song to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. Its music video was directed by Peter Care.

&quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; was placed on R.E.M.&#x27;s compilation albums &quot;In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011&quot; in 2011, the only track from &quot;Monster&quot; to feature on either. The song was one of the band&#x27;s most-played songs at live gigs, and was played at every show on their 2008 &quot;Accelerate&quot; tour. A live version was released on &quot;R.E.M. Live&quot; in 2007.

==History==
===Background and recording===
R.E.M. began work on &quot;Monster&quot; in August 1993 and &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; was recorded about two months later in October. This song was written and recorded at Kingsway Studio, New Orleans, where the band also wrote and recorded &quot;Tongue&quot; and &quot;Crush with Eyeliner&quot;. Lead singer Michael Stipe has said in interviews that the lyrics are about the Generation X phenomenon in contemporary mass media, sung in character as an older critic whose information consists exclusively of media products.

Guitarist Peter Buck explained why the song slows towards its conclusion in an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine:

===Post-release===
&quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; made its first live television debut on November 12, 1994, for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, recorded at NBC Studios in New York City. The set on the show opened with &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; and was followed by two other songs from the new album, &quot;Monster&quot;, &quot;Bang and Blame&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Sleep, I Dream&quot;. The following year, on June 22, 1995, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Dan Rather accompanied the band during a soundcheck performance of the song. The clip was shown prior to R.E.M.&#x27;s performance of &quot;Crush with Eyeliner&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; the following night.

==Critical reception==
Steve Baltin from &quot;Cash Box&quot; named &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; Pick of the Week, saying it&#x27;s &quot;a strong song, but it’s not as much a single as the introduction to the most eagerly anticipated record of the fall. On that level, it’s a smashing success. The song literally explodes onto the airwaves with an updated version of classic guitar rock before the booming of the drums takes the song into Michael Stipe’s unique vocals. From there, the track weaves its way through various rock tempos without ever losing the momentum from its initial burst of energy.&quot; Chuck Campbell from &quot;Knoxville News Sentinel&quot; remarked that Buck&#x27;s &quot;powerful-but-not-grungy guitar&quot; is the centerpiece on the &quot;satisfying&quot; first single. Dave Jennings from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named it Single of the Week, adding, &quot;It&#x27;s a breezy, upbeat slice of whimsy that&#x27;ll undoubtedly be filling rock club dancefloors for months to come; similar in mood and tempo to &quot;Stand&quot;, and featuring a truly glorious psychedelic backwards guitar solo. It&#x27;s R.E.M.&#x27;s back-to-basics record, reviving a few tricks from their early days — notably a great, grimy, garage-band guitar sound and half-buried vocals.&quot;

Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; wrote, &quot;Are they losing their religion? Radically breaking with the tradition of their last semi-acoustic CDs, R.E.M. give a first taste of the &quot;heavy Monstersound&quot; of the new one.&quot; Alan Jones of &quot;Music Week&quot; found that it is &quot;the most straightforward rock song the group has done in years, a full-throttle aural assault and very intense. With bonus live tracks, this one will sell.&quot; Keith Cameron from &quot;NME&quot; declared it as &quot;a deceptively catchy fellow, loping atop a mellifluous Buckoid drone last spotted somewhere between &quot;Document&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, and grasping onto a Michael Stipe vocal that punctuates yearnsome heights with the hiccuping groans of an old man apparently unable to come to terms with &#x27;90s youth culture.&quot; Paul Evans from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;R.E.M.&#x27;s toughest single&quot;. Howard Hampton from &quot;Spin&quot; noted that it &quot;lifts its catch phrase from the dadaist mugger who attacked Dan Rather a few years back. The song, wryly straddling the pop-irony curtain dividing &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; from stupid-pet MC David Letterman, revels in a nagging resonance that signifies nothing, but wants to say everything.&quot;

==Music video==
Shot in Hollywood, California, in August 1994, the accompanying music video for &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; was directed by Peter Care, who had previously worked with the band on music videos for &quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; in 1992. It features the band playing along to the song under bright blue, red, yellow and green flashing lights. Michael Stipe appears timid behind the microphone until the first chorus, breaking into an energetic dance. Prominent in the guitar solo, Peter Buck uses Kurt Cobain&#x27;s Jag-Stang that he received as a gift from Courtney Love after Cobain died; he plays it upside-down as Cobain was left-handed. Singer Stipe&#x27;s newly shaven head and bassist Mike Mills&#x27;s new look (long-hair and the use of Nudie suits), prominent on the 1995 &quot;Monster&quot; world tour, were given wide exposure in this video. The suit seen in the music video was owned by musician Gram Parsons.

The DVD companion to &quot;In Time&quot;, entitled &quot;In View: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003&quot; (featuring the promotional videos to most of the songs from &quot;In Time&quot;), included the music video to &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot;

==Track listings==
All songs were written by Bill Berry, Peter Buck, Mike Mills, and Michael Stipe. The live recordings of &quot;Monty Got a Raw Deal&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; and &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; were recorded at the 40 Watt Club, Athens, Georgia on November 19, 1992. The performance—a benefit for Greenpeace—was recorded in a solar-powered mobile studio.

<text>West Virginia University Institute of Technology (WVU Tech, WVIT, WVU Beckley, or West Virginia Tech) is a public college in Beckley, West Virginia. It is a divisional campus of West Virginia University.

== History ==
The college was founded in 1895 in Montgomery, West Virginia as the sub-collegiate Montgomery Preparatory School for West Virginia University. In 1917, it was separated from WVU and renamed the West Virginia Trade School. Next, in 1921, it reached the junior college level as the New River State School. It became a four-year college as New River State College in 1931 and was renamed the West Virginia Institute of Technology in 1941. It began to grant engineering degrees in 1952.

West Virginia Tech added a community college in 1966. It began granting the master&#x27;s degree in engineering in 1978, but no longer offers graduate degrees. WVU Tech&#x27;s community college component was separated from WVU Tech in 2004 and WVU Tech is now part of West Virginia University.

The school became a regional campus of West Virginia University in 1996, leading to its present name. It later became an integrated division of WVU in July 2007. While several support departments on campus report directly to WVU, local oversight of academic programs remains on the WVU Tech campus.

=== 2011 revitalization efforts ===
The school had been beset with declining enrollments for many years. In 2011, the state government passed the WVU Tech Revitalization Project law, in response to its declining enrollments and financial distress. As a condition of the law, an assessment was conducted over the summer of 2011 and a “revitalization report” was completed by October 2011. The report identified a number of specific actions that needed to be taken, culminating in a revitalization of the university&#x27;s administrative staff, and ultimately a move of the entire campus to the larger city of Beckley, West Virginia (see next section).

=== 2015 move to Beckley ===
In January 2015, WVU completed purchase of the buildings in Beckley formerly used by Mountain State University, which is about 30 miles from the Montgomery campus. WVU President E. Gordon Gee stated that Tech&#x27;s future was &quot;very secure&quot; but refused to answer a question from the Charleston Daily Mail about the possibility of the school relocating.

On August 31, 2015, it was announced that Gee had recommended that WVU Tech move from Montgomery to the former MSU campus in Beckley, a larger and more accessible city. The university&#x27;s Board of Governors unanimously approved this recommendation at its September 1 meeting. For the 2016–2017 academic years, freshman courses were taught at the Beckley campus, and all other courses remained in Montgomery. Summer classes in 2017 were mostly held online with all academic programs, administrative offices and athletic teams moving to Beckley in the Fall 2017.

Since the move, enrollment has increased from 1,106 students in 2017 to 1,622 in Spring of 2019, and the university has been ranked the best return-on-investment in the state of West Virginia.

=== Former Montgomery campus ===
The &quot;Old Main&quot; building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

The Neal D. Baisi Athletic Center was completed in 1968 and was home to the Golden Bears&#x27; basketball teams.

On April 21, 2017, it was announced that the buildings on the Fayette County side of the Montgomery campus would be lease-purchased by KVC Health Systems, a foster care and adoption services provider, for conversion into a proposed &quot;transitional college for persons aging out of foster care&quot;, while the buildings on the Kanawha County side would be transferred to BridgeValley Community &amp; Technical College. The only exceptions are the &quot;Tech Marina&quot; (a boat dock) and the David S. Long Alumni Center, which were transferred to the city of Montgomery, and the HiRise Residence Hall, which was demolished on June 4, 2017. However, the KVC effort was abandoned in 2019 and the buildings are currently listed as surplus property and unused.

== Academics ==
WVU Tech offers baccalaureate degree programs in 32 majors spread between two academic divisions (the Leonard C. Nelson College of Engineering and Sciences &amp; the College of Business, Humanities and Social Studies).

== Athletics ==

The West Virginia Tech (WVU Tech) athletic teams are called the Golden Bears. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the River States Conference (RSC; formerly known as the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (KIAC) until after the 2015–16 school year) since the 2015–16 academic year. The Golden Bears previously competed as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) from 2012–13 to 2014–15; and in the Mid-South Conference (MSC) from 2006–07 to 2011–12.

WVU Tech historically competed in the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC), which is currently affiliated with the NCAA Division II ranks, with the other small colleges in the state from its inception in 1924–25 until the end of the 2005–06 school year, when it could no longer maintain that level of competition. They also competed as a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) from 2012–13 to 2015–16.

WVU Tech competes in 17 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming, track &amp; field and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading and eSports. Former sports were football, which it was dropped as a result of the Revitalization Study after 2011.

=== Accomplishments ===
The sports at WVU Tech have been very successful over the years. The men&#x27;s basketball team has won the WVIAC and has been successful in the Mid-South Conference. They were runners-up in the AII Tournament in 2013. They have also been to the NAIA Nationals over the years. The women&#x27;s basketball team won the AII Championship in 2013 and went to the NAIA National Championships that year.

The men&#x27;s soccer team won the USCAA National Championship in 2013 and 2014. They also were runners-up in the USCAA National Championship in 2012.

<doc id="1240269" wikidata="Q1898036" url="?curid=1240269" title="The Pioneers (novel)">
<text>The Pioneers, or The Sources of the Susquehanna; a Descriptive Tale is an 1823 historical novel by American writer James Fenimore Cooper. It was the first of five novels published which became known as the &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;. &quot;The Pioneers&quot; is the fourth novel in terms of the chronology of the novels&#x27; plots.

==Plot summary==
The story takes place on the rapidly advancing frontier of New York State and features an elderly Leatherstocking (Natty Bumppo), Judge Marmaduke Temple of Templeton (whose life parallels that of the author&#x27;s father Judge William Cooper), and Elizabeth Temple (based on the author&#x27;s sister, Hannah Cooper), daughter of the fictional Templeton. The story begins with an argument between the judge and Leatherstocking over who killed a buck.

Through their discussion, Cooper reviews many of the changes to New York&#x27;s Lake Otsego and its area: questions of environmental stewardship, conservation, and use prevail. Leatherstocking and his closest friend, the Mohican Indian Chingachgook, begin to compete with the Temples for the loyalties of a mysterious young visitor, a &quot;young hunter&quot; known as Oliver Edwards. The latter eventually marries Elizabeth Temple. Chingachgook dies, representing European-American fears for the race of &quot;dying Indians&quot;, who appear to be displaced by settlers. Natty vanishes into the sunset.

==Analysis==
&quot;The Pioneers&quot; was the first novel of James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot; series, featuring the character Natty Bumppo, a resourceful white American living in the woods. The story focuses on the development of a &quot;wilderness&quot; area (as classified by European Americans) as a settled European-American community with refinements. The story takes place in the fictional town of Тempleton, which is said to be modeled after Cooperstown, New York, founded by Cooper&#x27;s father after the Revolutionary War.

Naturalist ideas: Although not classified as a naturalist novel, Cooper depicts many naturalist based ideas in &quot;The Pioneers.&quot; His use of language, dialogue and description help to convey this movement within this novel.

* Landscape: In &quot;The Pioneers,&quot; Cooper thematically debates the complexity of landscape within a new American frontier. The battle between nature and civilization is a constant and competing force within the minds of the characters and in the general surroundings. Cooper evaluates his landscape as one that will be established by a civilization unable to escape its own traits of wastefulness and arrogance.
* Characters: Cooper expands the conflict between nature and civilization in his characters. Specifically, Cooper writes much more detailed dialogue for “Natty Bumpo” than he does for any of the other characters. Natty stresses the importance of respecting the land and criticizes the greed and selfishness of mankind. The “civil societal” characters are background to Natty&#x27;s heroic natural character. He emerges as the antithesis to wastefulness as demonstrated and embodied in the settlers. Cooper&#x27;s main theme is wilderness versus established society. While the settlers see wilderness as being tamed by their presence, Natty has a vision of civilized life coexisting with nature. Ideally, he wants to sustain the unique role that this vast unexplored wilderness contributes to the complexity of America.
::“It is much better to kill only such you want, without wasting your powder and lead, then to be firing into God’s creatures in such a wicked manner.” (Natty to Judge Marmeduke) – Chapter XXII, The Slaughter of Pigeons
* Description: Alternating between dialogues, Cooper writes extensive descriptive paragraphs to portray the natural wilderness. To him, the natural landscape exemplifies a peaceful wilderness. When the dialogue begins, it shows the disruption that civilization wreaks on the natural abundance of the wilderness. Cooper contrasts the giving, natural and serene wilderness versus the arrogant and greedy society.

Tone: Cooper&#x27;s tone in &quot;The Pioneers&quot; is critical and mocking of traditional society, “established society”. The dialogue of the settlers displays the carelessness of their society towards the wilderness. The scene in Chapter II (The Judge&#x27;s History of Settlement) is an exaggerated depiction of the reactions of the settlers to a falling tree and storm. The naivety of the settlers is portrayed in their responses to their journey into the wilderness. Cooper&#x27;s mocking and critical tone is seen throughout the novel.

==Characters==
*Nathaniel &quot;Natty&quot; Bumppo, aka the Leather-stocking, aka Hawk-eye. The hero, an old hunter and patriot, the protagonist of the novel. He is a friend to the Indians and distrustful of civilization. (chapter 1, page 22). He was &quot;a melodious synopsis of man and nature in the West&quot;. He emerges as the antithesis to wastefulness demonstrated and embodied in the settlers. Natty represents the frontier in conflict with civilization and the law. In Chapter III, The Slaughter of Pigeons, his character is introduced as one who lived off the land. In contrast to settlers who hunt for sport and kill too many pigeons, he shoots the one needed for his meal.
*Judge Marmaduke Temple - A widower and the founder of Templeton (chapter 1, page 18). He is the trail-blazing leader of the group of pioneers who settle the wilderness of Otsego. He is a strong natural leader with a practical and wise approach. He is appreciative of nature and respectful of its ability to both sustain life and destroy it. He has to lead his people when threatened in the early days with starvation. He is nearly crushed by a falling dead tree in chapter 2. He is a cautious, effective leader, but he also holds a genuine love for the untamed back country. His description of its splendor at the top of a mountain he named “Mount Vision” is a testament to his respect for the beauties of nature. Marmaduke&#x27;s opinions are synonymous with those of Leather-stocking, yet his seemingly incorruptible attitude is blemished at the end of the pigeon hunt, when he joins in the annihilation of hundreds of the birds. When the hunt is over, the ‘Duke feels a pang of guilt, for “after the excitement of the moment has passed, that he has purchased pleasure at the price of misery to others.” Marmaduke&#x27;s character represents settlers who were conscious and aware of their intrusive and sometime destructive ways. Throughout the story he is respectful toward Leather-stocking as well as the lands he controls.
*Agamemnon &quot;Aggy&quot; - A slave of the Judge (New York did not fully abolish slavery until the 1820s)
*Elizabeth &quot;Bess&quot; Temple - Daughter of the Judge and romantic interest of Oliver (chapter 5, page 66)
*Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Jones - The cousin of the Judge (chapter 4, page 47), and “The Sheriff.&quot; He is the right-hand man of Marmaduke. He holds a systematic, “ends-justify-the-means” approach to solving problems. He claims that to avoid falling trees, one needs to avoid every tree in the forest with rotten base wood. When posed with the issue of bringing down the pigeons to feed the village, he uses an artillery cannon. Richard likes to “fish with dynamite,” figuratively speaking. He is the foil of Leather-stocking, who is frugal and weighted by morals. Richard&#x27;s character represents settlers who were ignorant of the land and people they disturbed while trying to make new lives. He is generally concerned with his own survival and prosperity with little regard to people such as Leather-stocking and the land.
*Squire Hiram Doolittle - An architect, justice of the peace, and buddy of Dick Jones
*Monsieur Le Quoi - A French nobleman exiled by their violent revolution; he becomes a shopkeeper in Templeton (chapter 4, page 47)
*Major Frederick &quot;Fritz&quot; Hartmann - A German settler in the area and regular visitor to the Judge&#x27;s house (chapter 4, page 48)
*The Reverend Mr. Grant - An Episcopal minister (chapter 4, page 48) (The Episcopal Church was established in the United States after the Revolution, replacing the Anglican Church, which had been the established church in the South
*Ben Pump, aka Mr. Pump, aka Benjamin Penguillan - A servant to the Judge, and a former seaman who doesn&#x27;t know how to swim (chapter 5, page 60)

*Old Brave - The Temples&#x27; faithful dog.
*Dr. Elnathan Todd - The town doctor (chapter 6, page 71)

*Oliver Edwards, aka Young Eagle - The young hunter and friend to Natty and Indian John (chapter 3, page 38)
*Captain and Mrs. Hollister - Owners of the inn, The Bold Dragoon
*Squire Chester Lippet - a lawyer who talks too much
*Louisa Grant - The daughter of Mr. Grant, companion to Elizabeth, and a possible love interest for Oliver Effingham

*Squire Van der School - The &quot;honest&quot; lawyer of Judge Marmaduke (chapter 25, page 277)
*Jotham Riddle - A lazy fellow appointed as a magistrate by Sheriff Jones
*Sir Oliver Effingham - British aristocrat

==Reception==
Based on a reading of &quot;The Pioneers,&quot; &quot;The British Magazine&quot; dubbed Cooper the best and most original of all US authors, but nevertheless charged him with copying the style of Sir Walter Scott. The &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; critiqued the story as not so much a novel but a collection of pleasant depictions of American scenery. The &quot;Newcastle Magazine&quot; called it one of America&#x27;s best novels. John Neal in &quot;American Writers&quot; (1824–25) critiqued the novel&#x27;s character traits as repetitive but nevertheless praised Bumppo as true to life.

<text>Catherine Mary Hicks (born August 6, 1951) is an American retired actress. She played the character Annie Camden on the long-running television series &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. Other roles included Dr. Faith Coleridge on the soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; (1976–1978), her Emmy Award-nominated performance as Marilyn Monroe in &quot;&quot; (1980), Dr. Gillian Taylor in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986), Carol Heath in &quot; Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986), and Karen Barclay in &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; (1988).

==Early life==
Hicks was born in New York City, the daughter of Jackie, a homemaker, and Walter Hicks, an electronics salesman. She is of Irish and English ancestry. Her family moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, during her childhood. Hicks attended Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Notre Dame, Indiana where she studied English literature, graduating in 1973. She then won a prestigious acting fellowship sponsored by the University Resident Theatre Association to Cornell University. While at Cornell, she was a member of the Ithaca Repertory Theater Company.

==Career==
After graduating from Cornell with a master of fine arts degree, Hicks headed to New York in August 1976, where, two weeks after arriving, she landed her first major TV role as the newly recovered pediatrician Dr. Faith Coleridge on the ABC soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. A year and half later, she left her role on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; when she was cast to star alongside Jack Lemmon (as Scottie) in Bernard Slade&#x27;s 1978 Broadway play &quot;Tribute&quot;, in which she played the young model Sally Haines, whom Scottie sets up with his estranged son (Robert Picardo). That same year, she starred as Valerie in a CBS TV movie/series pilot, &quot;Sparrow&quot;.

After &quot;Tribute&quot; ended its run, she moved to California and co-starred on the 1979–80 CBS sitcom, &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; as junior high school principal and psychologist Dr. Emily Rappant. She had roles in a few TV movies, playing an escort, Annie, in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Love For Rent&quot; (1979), and as Beth, a camp counselor in CBS&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;To Race the Wind&quot;, based on the Harold Krents&#x27; autobiography.

In 1980, Hicks beat out hundreds of actresses for the lead role of Marilyn Monroe in ABC&#x27;s $3.5 million production, &quot;&quot;, based on the Norman Mailer best seller. She earned an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for her portrayal of the legendary star.

In 1981, Hicks starred in CBS&#x27;s remake of Jacqueline Susann&#x27;s &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, as Anne Wells, an entertainment lawyer, and James Coburn&#x27;s protege. She turned down a co-starring role in &quot;Body Heat&quot; due to the overtly sexual nature of the film. She made her feature-film debut in the thriller &quot;Death Valley&quot; (1982) as Peter Billingsley&#x27;s mother, Sally. That same year, she starred as Sable in &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot;.

Hicks took the lead role as Amanda Tucker in the 12-episode detective series &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Witch&quot; opposite Tim Matheson as Rick Tucker. The program aired on CBS from October 6, 1982, sporadically into August, 1983. In 1983, she played Lisa Sage and co-starred with John Schneider in CBS&#x27;s romantic comedy movie &quot;Happy Endings&quot;.

Hicks appeared with Anne Bancroft and Ron Silver in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s film &quot;Garbo Talks&quot; (1984). Hicks also played Bill Murray&#x27;s socialite fiancée, Isabel, in the remake &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1984). For her work in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986), Hicks received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. That same year, she played Carol Heath in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;.

In &quot;Like Father Like Son&quot; (1987), Hicks played Dr. Amy Larkin. In March 1987, Hicks hosted the 59th Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&#x27; Scientific and Technical Awards ceremony.

In 1988, she played businesswoman Ella Frazier in the Yugoslavian comedy &quot;Tajna manastirske rakije&quot; (also released under the titles &quot;Cognac&quot; and &quot;Secret Ingredient&quot;). She co-starred with Christopher Plummer, as his estranged daughter, Tina Boyer, in Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Souvenir&quot; (1989). She played Karen Barclay in the horror film &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; (1988). Her performance won her a 1988 Best Actress Saturn Award.

In 1989, she starred opposite Tony Danza in &quot;She&#x27;s Out of Control&quot; as his girlfriend, Janet Pearson. In 1991, she co-starred in the Fox TV comedy-fantasy movie &quot;Hi Honey - I&#x27;m Dead&quot; as Carol Stadler. She played Allison Ploutzer in the Jeff Franklin ABC comedy pilot &quot;Up to No Good&quot; (1992). She starred with John Bedford Lloyd in the ABC comedy pilot &quot;The Circle Game&quot; (1993) as the mother, and schoolteacher, Nancy. She played Jeannie Barker in the Aaron Spelling primetime soap opera &quot;Winnetka Road&quot;, which had a six-episode tryout on NBC in 1994. That same year, she played the wife in the pilot for &quot;The Martin Short Show&quot;. Going into production, after the concept of the character was changed, she was replaced by Jan Hooks. She played Julia Riordan, opposite John Lithgow and Lea Salonga, in the ABC Hallmark Hall of Fame movie &quot;Redwood Curtain&quot; (1995). In 1996, she was cast as Annie Camden on The WB&#x27;s family drama &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, and she portrayed the role until the series ended, after 11 seasons, in 2007.

<doc id="1240278" wikidata="Q13049520" url="?curid=1240278" title="Billycan">
<text>A billycan is an Australian term for a lightweight cooking pot in the form of a metal bucket commonly used for boiling water, making tea/coffee or cooking over a campfire or to carry water. It is commonly known simply as a billy, or occasionally as a billy can (billy tin or billy pot in Canada).

==Usage==
The term &quot;billy&quot; or &quot;billycan&quot; is particularly associated with Australian usage, but is also used in New Zealand, and to a lesser extent Britain and Ireland.

In Australia, the billy has come to symbolise the spirit of exploration of the outback and is a widespread symbol of bush life, although now regarded mostly as a symbol of an age that has long passed.

To &quot;boil the billy&quot; most often means to make tea. This expression dates from the Australian gold rushes and probably earlier. &quot;Billy Tea&quot; was the name of a popular brand of tea long sold by Australian grocers and supermarkets. Billies feature in many of Henry Lawson&#x27;s stories and poems. Banjo Paterson&#x27;s most famous of many references to the billy is surely in the first verse and chorus of Waltzing Matilda: &quot;Waltzing Matilda and leading a waterbag&quot;, which was later changed by the Billy Tea Company to &quot;And he sang as he watched and waited &#x27;til his billy boiled ...&quot;.

==Etymology==
Although there is a suggestion that the word may be associated with the Aboriginal &quot;billa&quot; (meaning water; &quot;cf.&quot; Billabong), it is widely accepted that the term &quot;billycan&quot; is derived from b&quot;ouilli can&quot;, the name given to the empty canisters used for preserving soup and bouilli and other foods. With the addition of a handle, the tins were re-purposed for boiling water. Letters to newspapers in the early 20th century support this view and David George Stead quoting his father, who emigrated in 1862 aged 16, wrote &quot;the term &quot;billy can&quot; was commonly used in south coastal England, to describe a &quot;bouilli&quot; can or tin.

The preservation of foods in tin canisters began in 1812 at the firm of Donkin, Hall and Gamble in Bermondsey, England.

The reuse of the empty cans probably began at the same time but it is not until 1835 that there is a record of &quot;an empty preserved-meat-canister serving the double purpose of tea-kettle and tea-pot&quot;.

By the 1840s, &quot;soup and bouilli tin&quot; or &quot;bouilli tin&quot; was increasingly being used as a generic term for any empty preserved food can.

The earliest known use of billy for kettle is in an 1848 Tasmanian newspaper report of a criminal trial. A defendant is reported as saying &quot;he put some bread on the table and the &quot;billy&quot; on the fire.&quot; Reminiscences by Heberley and Davenport place billy or billies at earlier events but these accounts were written much later.

Another early example from 1849 shows that use of the term was possibly widespread in Australia. It occurs in idyllic description of a shepherd&#x27;s life in South Australia: &quot;near the wooden fire, is what is called the billy or tea-kettle&quot;.

From 1851 the gold rushes spur British emigration to Australia with many gold diggers writing letters home describing the journey to Australia and life on the goldfields and many writers mentioning their use of a &quot;billy&quot;. From these it is known:
*In 1853 soup and bouilli cans were converted to useful items on an emigrant ship.
*&quot;Billy - (this is what you call a tin-can, which is used very often at home for milking cows in, but which the diggers have christened Billy) - and a useful Billy he is: in it we make our tea and coffee&quot;.

By 1855 &quot;tin billys&quot; are no longer just repurposed bouilli tins but are being sold by a Melbourne importer and by 1859 are being manufactured in Australia with &quot;Billys, all sizes&quot; being sold at the Kyneton Tin and Zinc Works.

==Whitely Kings==
Named for the secretary of the Pastoralists&#x27; Union of New South Wales, this was the swagman&#x27;s contemptuous term for billycans improvised from a tin can and a length of wire as carried by inexperienced travellers. John Whiteley King (1857–1905) enticed hundreds of unemployed city men to the shearing sheds as a strike-busting strategy.

<text>The M51 SLBM is a French submarine-launched ballistic missile, built by ArianeGroup, and deployed with the French Navy. Designed to replace the M45 SLBM (in French terminology the MSBS – &quot;Mer-Sol-Balistique-Stratégique&quot; &quot;Sea-ground-Strategic ballistic&quot;), it was first deployed in 2010.

Each missile carries six to ten independently targetable TN 75 thermonuclear warheads.

The three-stage engine of the M51 is directly derived from the solid propellant boosters of Ariane 5. Like other blunt-nosed SLBM examples, such as the Trident D5, the M51 uses an extensible aerospike in the nose.

The missiles are a compromise over the M5 SLBM design, which was to have a range of and carry ten new-generation &quot;tête nucléaire océanique&quot; (&quot;oceanic nuclear warhead&quot;) MIRVs. Design work on the M5 started in the late 1980s by Aérospatiale, before the programme was renamed the M51 in 1996, when development costs decreased by 20 percent. The M51 entered service in 2010.

== Development ==
After having spent €5 billion ($6.7 billion) developing the missile, the French government placed a €3 billion ($3.9 billion) order with EADS SPACE Transportation for the M51 in December 2004. The contract covered serial production of the M51 for 10 years, with the company to be responsible for sustained readiness support throughout the missile&#x27;s life.

The M51 performed its first flight test (unarmed) on 9 November 2006 from the French missile flight test centre in Biscarrosse (Landes). The target was reached twenty minutes later, in the north-west of the Atlantic Ocean.

A second and third successful test were carried out on 21 June 2007 and 13 November 2008.

On 27 January 2010, at 9h25, a missile was launched underwater by , from Audierne Bay off the coast of Brittany in north-western France. The missile reached its target off South Carolina; the flight took less than 20 minutes.

A 10 July 2010 test validated the &#x27;s capacity to launch the M51 in operational conditions.

On 5 May 2013, an M51 flight test missile failed after being fired by a submerged ballistic missile submarine off the coast of Brittany. This was the first failed launch of the M51 after five successful launches since 2006.

In 2014 Airbus signed a deal with the French government for development work on an upgrade designated M51.3 to equip the SNLE 3G.

On 30 September 2015, an M51 was successfully test-flown from a land-based missile site near Biscarrosse to a desolate target in the North Atlantic.

On 10 May 2016 Airbus and Safran signed a joint 50-50 partnership to develop the M51.3 upgrade intended to enter service around 2025.

On 12 June 2020, a successful test launch of an M51.3 missile (supposedly) was conducted from the &quot;Le Téméraire&quot; &quot;Triomphant&quot;-class submarine off the south-west tip of Finistère (Brittany).

On April 28, 2021 French Ministry of Armed Forces announced that it had tested an M51 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). The test was not launched from a French Navy &quot;Triomphant&quot;-class submarine but from a land based facility located in South Western France.

On April 19, 2023 the French Ministry of Armed Forces announced another M51 test, launched from the French Navy &quot;Le Terrible&quot; SSBN.

M51.3 was test fired successfully in November 2023.

<text>The return on assets (ROA) shows the percentage of how profitable a company&#x27;s assets are in generating revenue.

ROA can be computed as below:

:formula_1

The phrase return on average assets (ROAA) is also used, to emphasize that average assets are used in the above formula.

This number tells you what the company can do with what it has, &quot;i.e.&quot; how many dollars of earnings they derive from each dollar of assets they control. It&#x27;s a useful number for comparing competing companies in the same industry. The number will vary widely across different industries. Return on assets gives an indication of the capital intensity of the company, which will depend on the industry; companies that require large initial investments will generally have lower return on assets. ROAs over 5% are generally considered good.

==Usage==

Return on assets is one of the elements used in financial analysis using the Du Pont Identity.

<doc id="1240297" wikidata="Q630914" url="?curid=1240297" title="Vinyl Confessions">
<text>Vinyl Confessions is the eighth studio album by American rock band Kansas, released in 1982. It includes &quot;Play the Game Tonight&quot;, which broke the Top 20 and is Kansas&#x27;s third highest-charting single, surpassed only by &quot;Carry on Wayward Son&quot; and &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;. The album was reissued in remastered format on CD in 1996 on Legacy/Epic and again in 2011.

==Background==
&quot;Vinyl Confessions&quot; was a major turning point for the band. After the conversion of both guitarist/keyboard player Kerry Livgren and bass player Dave Hope to Christianity, and the focus that Livgren placed on his religion in the band&#x27;s lyrics, lead singer Steve Walsh did not agree with the new direction of the band and left to form his own band, Streets. Walsh had also contributed much as a songwriter, so the band was forced to find a new lead singer who not only had a vocal style that fit the band&#x27;s music, but also could contribute material for the upcoming album. After a long audition process, the choice came down to three strong candidates: Warren Ham, Michael Gleason and John Elefante. The band eventually settled on Elefante.

&quot;Fair Exchange&quot; described the world under the rule of the Anti-Christ, while &quot;Chasing Shadows&quot; pointed out the frustration in seeking anything outside Biblical truth. &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; emphasized the value of spiritual wealth over financial wealth, while &quot;Face It&quot;, &quot;Windows&quot; and &quot;Borderline&quot; all had strong evangelistic appeals to the listener. The album&#x27;s closer, &quot;Crossfire&quot;, made the album&#x27;s position abundantly clear in its indirect reference to Jesus Christ (&quot;the one who rose&quot;).

&quot;Vinyl Confessions&quot; did not go unnoticed by the nascent Contemporary Christian music (CCM) industry, which was just coming into its own at that time. Numerous Christian magazines trumpeted Kansas&#x27; new musical direction, and &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; even chose &quot;Vinyl Confessions&quot; as the No. 1 CCM album of 1982. All this attention created an entirely new audience of listeners for Kansas, but it also created further tensions within the band. Those tensions came to a head during the recording of their next album, &quot;Drastic Measures&quot;.

Queen drummer Roger Taylor was recording a solo album in the studio next door, and contributed background vocals on a handful of songs on the album.

&quot;Vinyl Confessions&quot; was also the last album with violinist/vocalist Robby Steinhardt, who left the band after the supporting tour and did not return until 1997.

==Reception==

While acknowledging the comeback success of the single &quot;Play the Game Tonight&quot;, AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review was largely negative. They criticized the Christian lyrics as being &quot;often of a judgmental, us-versus-you nature&quot;, and insinuated that the album fell more into a generic pop rock vein than Kansas&#x27;s earlier albums (&quot;it was getting hard to distinguish Kansas from Foreigner and Journey&quot;).

<text>The second USS &quot;Perry&quot; was a in the United States Navy. She was named for Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry.

==Construction==
&quot;Perry&quot; was laid down on 19 April 1899, by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California; launched on 27 October 1900; sponsored by Miss Maude O&#x27;Connor; and commissioned on 4 September 1902.

==Pre-World War I==

&quot;Perry&quot; was assigned to the Pacific Torpedo Flotilla and based at Mare Island until the United States entered World War I. Her operations took her as far north as Alaska and south along the coast of Mexico; and in the fall of 1908, combined fleet maneuvers took her to Hawaii.

Perhaps the highlight of the torpedo boat destroyer&#x27;s career came during the earthquake which struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, and the resulting fire which devastated the city. For four days after, they were awakened by severe rolling and pitching of their ship before dawn on 18 April, the crew labored to save the western metropolis by fighting fires; patrolling districts where stores, warehouses, and homes were threatened by looters; and providing medical aid to countless injured men, women, and children.

In 1914, &quot;Perry&quot; observed the Topolobampo naval campaign in the Gulf of California during the Mexican Revolution, she was present at the Fourth Battle of Topolobampo, the final naval action of the campaign.

==World War I==
When the United States entered World War I, &quot;Perry&quot; patrolled off the California Coast until steaming to Panama where, beginning on 28 July 1917, she guarded the entrance to the vital canal. On 30 May 1918, she sailed for Key West for patrol duty in the Florida Keys. After the Armistice, she got under way for the Delaware Bay on 29 January 1919, and remained at the Philadelphia Navy Yard until decommissioning on 2 July. &quot;Perry&quot;″s name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September, and she was sold to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company for scrapping on 5 January 1920.

==Noteworthy commanding officers==
* Lieutenant commander Frank Herman Schofield (25 June 1904 – 1 November 1905) (Later Rear Admiral)
* Lieutenant Edgar Brown Larimer (11 July 1907 – 13 October 1909) (Later Rear admiral and Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance (1931-1934))
* Lieutenant JG Harry Adrian McClure (11 September 1915 – 3 April 1916) (Later Commodore)

<doc id="1240310" wikidata="Q7227703" url="?curid=1240310" title="Ponderosa (TV series)">
<text>The Ponderosa is a television series developed by &quot;Bonanza&quot; creator David Dortort for PAX TV that ran for the 2001–2002 television season.

Envisioned as a prequel to the NBC series &quot;Bonanza&quot;, covering the time when the Cartwrights first arrived at the Ponderosa, when Adam and Hoss were teenagers and Joe a little boy, it had less gunfire, brawling and other traditional western elements than the original.

&quot;Bonanza&quot; creator David Dortort approved PAX TV&#x27;s decision to hire Beth Sullivan, creator and executive producer of &quot;Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman&quot;, to oversee scripts and executive produce, which some believe gave the series a softer edge.

&quot;The Ponderosa&quot; was canceled after one season, in part because of disappointing ratings and high production costs. Although Sullivan had hoped to film the series in and around Los Angeles, PAX decided to film in Australia to reduce costs.
The series should not be confused with &quot;Ponderosa&quot;, the title used for &quot;Bonanza&quot; reruns aired on NBC in mid-1972.

==Premise==
Territory of Nevada, year 1849: ten years before the original &quot;Bonanza&quot; starts, the Cartwright family moves onto some scrub land. In this new land Ben Cartwright, a new widower, tries to raise his three young sons – at their late teens Adam and Hoss, and a pre-teen Joseph, commonly known as Little Joe.

==Episodes==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Home release==
Shortly after the series first aired, four episodes were released on two DVDs. The first DVD featured both parts of the pilot episode, while the second featured &quot;Brother vs. Brother&quot; and &quot;Treasure&quot;.

On May 25, 2004, The &quot;Ponderosa: Season 1: Volume 1&quot; was released. This set collects the first ten episodes of the series. No plans have been announced yet to release the last ten episodes of the series on DVD.

==Continuity==

A number of minor (or perceived) inconsistencies exist between &quot;Ponderosa&quot; and &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and a few glaring retcons are present. 
* Most notable among these is the fate of Little Joe&#x27;s mother. In the original series, her death was depicted in the episode &quot;Marie, My Love&quot; (&quot;4x20&quot;) as a result of falling off a horse in front of the Ponderosa ranch house. In the new series, she is killed in Virginia City by a miner who is trying to murder Eli Orowitz. Making the situation even more confusing, the pilot for the original series identifies Little Joe&#x27;s mother as &quot;Felicia&quot; and not &quot;Marie&quot; as in the original.
* The Hop Sing character is depicted not only as a cook, but also a family counselor and herbal healer.

<doc id="1240318" wikidata="Q245162" url="?curid=1240318" title="FC Rapid București">
<text>Fotbal Club Rapid 1923, commonly known as Rapid București () or simply as Rapid, is a Romanian professional football club based in Bucharest, that competes in the Liga I. It was founded in 1923 by employees of the Grivița workshops as the &quot;Asociația Culturală și Sportivă CFR&quot; (&quot;CFR Cultural and Sports Association&quot;).

Domestically, Rapid București is one of the most successful clubs in the country, having won three national titles, 13 Cupa României, and four Supercupa României. Internationally, its highest achievements are reaching the quarter-finals of the 1972–73 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the 2005–06 UEFA Cup, and the final of the 1940 Mitropa Cup—the latter not being played because of World War II. Recently, the club was declared bankrupt in 2016, but was refounded and managed to return to the top flight in 2021.

From 1939, Rapid played its home matches in burgundy and white kits at the Valentin Stănescu Stadium, which was replaced by the new Rapid-Giulești in 2022. The team has fierce local rivalries with FCSB, Dinamo București and Steaua București, as well as with Petrolul Ploiești.

==History==
=== 1923–32: Beginnings ===
On 25 June 1923, in a classroom of the primary school from the Grivița neighborhood, Bucharest, the employees of the Grivița workshops created &quot;Asociația Culturală și Sportivă CFR&quot; (&quot;CFR Cultural and Sports Association&quot;). Teofil Copaci was chosen as the president of the association, while Grigore Grigoriu became the first captain of the team. The squad was formed in September, following the merger of the &quot;Ateliere&quot; and &quot;Excelsior&quot; teams. The first equipment was made out of burgundy fabric in the house of Grigoriu.

On 28 October 1923, the team played its first game against Unirea Timișoara, which it lost 4–8. The second match, played over ten days, was against Gloria Arad, and was lost 1–2. Until 1932 &quot;CFR&quot; played in the Bucharest Championship, not qualifying in the final tournament of the national league. During this period, the leaders of the team were: Teofil Copaci, Grigore Grigoriu, and Bozie Codreanu; other players included Stănică, Tudor, Molnar, Ștefănescu, Foran, Leoveanu, Constantinescu, Fetzko, Georgescu, Albert, Block, Filip, Itu I, Itu II, Pîrvulescu, Cichi, Schileriu, Svetcovschi, Oros, Ujlaki, Pop, Dobrescu I, Kelemen, Vlaiculescu, Ispas, Vintilescu, and Petrovici.

=== 1932–45: The golden years ===
The club entered the Divizia A at the start of the 1932–33 season, after several years of competing for the regional championship of Bucharest. During the pre-war years, Rapid was one of Romania&#x27;s top teams, regularly winning the cup, but never the championship, although they came close. Once Rapid lost the title because of a player&#x27;s candor. One of Rapid&#x27;s players touched the ball with his hand in the penalty area during a decisive match against Venus București, when Rapid needed a win to finish first in the league. At first, the referee didn&#x27;t see it, but when he heard the audience protesting asked the player if he had touched the ball with his hand. The player admitted that he had.

Venus converted the penalty kick and managed a 1–1 draw to finish first in the league, instead of &quot;the Railwaymen&quot;. The team&#x27;s final season&#x27;s standings in the Divizia A were: 1932–33 – 2nd (Seria I), 1933–34 – 4th (Seria I), 1934–35 – 10th, 1935–36 – 7th, 1936–37 – 2nd, 1937–38 – 1st (Seria I) (with the team losing the national championship final against Ripensia Timișoara 0–2), 1938–39 – 6th, 1939–40 – 2nd, and 1940–41 – 2nd.

In this period, the club&#x27;s most successful time in this competition, Rapid won seven Romanian Cups: 1934–35, 1936–37, 1937–38, 1938–39, 1939–40, 1940–41, 1941–42, six of them won in consecutive years. The players in this winning effort included Roșculeț, Ujlaki, Vintilă, Wetzer II, Rășinaru, Cuedan, Barbu II, Rădulescu, Bogdan, Auer, Moldoveanu, Baratky, Raffinsky, Lengheriu, I.Costea, Sipos, Gavrilescu, Sadowski, Silvăț, Ghiurițan, Wetzer III, and Florian.

In the summer of 1937, the club changed its name from &quot;CFR București&quot; to Rapid București, modeling their new name on that of the Austrian club Rapid Wien.

The &quot;railway workers&quot; were no longer topping the league standings, but they still had supportive fans, and some players were selected for the national team. During those years, the competition format changed after various reorganizations, and Rapid won the Bessarabia Cup in 1942. They qualified for the final of the Mitropa Cup (precursor of the UEFA Champions League). In 1940, Rapid played to two ties in the Mitropa Cup semi-finals and was drawn for the final, which was never played, due to the outbreak of World War II.

===1945–1970: The Railwaymen, a solid team ===
After the war, Rapid returned to the Bucharest Championship in the 1945–46 season, finally finishing 4th. After this season the club returned to its old name, &quot;CFR&quot; (&quot;Căile Ferate Române&quot; – Romanian Railways), and entered the 1946–47 Divizia A season, the first official national season after the end of the war, and ended in 5th place, two points away from 2nd place (Carmen București) and 13 from 1st place (ITA Arad). In the following season, 1947–48, the team finished 3rd, behind CFR Timişoara and ITA Arad. In the 1948–49 season, &quot;the White and Burgundies&quot; finished 2nd, only five points behind IC Oradea. Also, on 20 March 1949, &quot;CFR București&quot; obtained the most lopsided victory in its entire history, 12–2 against CFR Cluj.
Under the influence of the communist regime installed in the country after 1945, the 1950s started with a change from an autumn-spring season to a spring-autumn one. In the 1950 season Rapid became &quot;Locomotiva&quot;, a name much closer to the Soviet version, &quot;Lokomotiv&quot;, a change imposed on all the teams that belonged to the Romanian Railways, but the &quot;Giuleștenii&quot; finished again in 2nd place. The first relegation to Liga II came in 1951 when the club was ranked 11th, losing a three-way contest by a goal against Locomotiva Târgu Mureș and Știința Timișoara. Promoted one year later, from 1st place in Liga II, with 10 points over the second-ranked (Locomotiva Iași), Rapid would finish the 1953 season in 5th place. In 1954 season &quot;Locomotiva&quot;, in 12th place, was relegated for the second time. However, &quot;The White and Burgundies&quot; returned after only one year to Divizia A, following a good showing for the team, including a 4th-place ranking at the end of 1956, only 5 points behind 1st place (CCA București).

In the 1957–58 season, Romanian football returned to the autumn-spring system and &quot;the Railwaymen&quot; finished at the middle of the table, 8th out of 12. The end of the Soviet system also meant the end of Soviet team names, and in 1958 the team returned to the Austrian-inspired name of Rapid. In the following years, the team finished 4th and 10th at the end of the 1958–59 and 1959–60 seasons, respectively.

In the 1950s, the squad included the following players: Valentin Stănescu, Gheorghe Dungu, Gh. Demeter, Dumitru Macri, Ion Mihăilescu, C. Simionescu, N. Cristescu, I. Ruzici, C. Socec, Ion Lungu, Bazil Marian, Andrei Rădulescu, Anton Fernbach-Ferenczi, Ștefan Filotti, Nicolae Roman, E. Avasilchioaie, D. Călin, L. Coman, A. Todor, N. Dodeanu, I. Langa, I. Olaru, Stere Zeană, and Gh. Milea, among others.

The 1960s was one of the best periods for Giulești football. In 1961, Rapid reached the final of the Romanian Cup, where they lost to Arieșul Turda, 1–2, with Nicolae Georgescu scoring in the 24th minute for the &quot;White and Burgundy&quot;. The result was more surprising, as the winning team was, at that time, only a Divizia C member. The following season, Rapid—with a squad coached by Ion Mihăilescu and composed of valuable players such as Ilie Greavu, Ion Motroc, Dumitru Macri, Titus Ozon, Ion Ionescu or Teofil Codreanu, among others—eliminated CSM Mediaș, Laminorul Roman, Metalul Târgoviște, and Progresul București. However, they suffered a dramatic defeat in the final, 1–5, against a Steaua București squad that would come to be recognized as the golden generation of that club.

For most of these seasons, the team could be found in the top half of the league: 1960–61 – 3rd, 1961–62 – 5th, and 1962–63 – 8th. Then followed three great seasons for the squad, under the Grant Bridge, which finished 2nd three years in a row: 1963–64 (7 points behind Dinamo București), 1964–65 (1 point behind Dinamo București), and 1965–66 (6 points behind Petrolul Ploiești). Nevertheless, they finished behind their rivals Dinamo and Petrolul. This motivated &quot;the Railwaymen&quot;, who, at the end of the 1966–67 season, had their best performance up until that time, their first Divizia A title, with the following players: Răducanu Necula, Marin Andrei – Dan Coe, Nicolae Lupescu, Ion Motroc, Ilie Greavu, Constantin Jamaischi – Constantin Dinu-Buric, Nicolae Georgescu, Constantin Năsturescu, Teofil Codreanu, Viorel Kraus – Ion Ionescu, Emil Dumitriu, and Alexandru Neagu. Valentin Stănescu and Victor Stănculescu were their coaches. In that season the title was won by two points over Dinamo București and the season&#x27;s top scorer was Ion Ionescu, with 15 goals. 

In the 1967–68 European Cup, Rapid eliminated the Bulgarian champion, Botev Plovdiv, in the first round, but lost to Juventus, 0–1. In the 1967–68 Division A season the team reached the final game of the Romanian Cup, which it lost to Dinamo, 1–3 in overtime; placed 3rd in 1968–69; and 2nd in 1969–70.

===1970–1990: Troubled times===

Rapid&#x27;s last strong season was in 1970–71, when it finished in 2nd place, after which it started to slide towards the bottom half of the league table: 1971–72 – 10th and 1972–73 – 14th. Despite these lesser performances, in 1972 Rapid reached the Romanian Cup final under coach Bazil Marian, a team player in the 1950s, and won 2–0 against Jiul Petroșani, with goals scored by Stelian Marin (3rd minute) and Alexandru Neagu (27th minute). In the 1971–72 UEFA Cup season Rapid had impressive results, eliminating Napoli and Legia Warsaw before being stopped by Tottenham Hotspur, 0–5. The 1972–73 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup was another good European campaign, and, after a 3–1 against Landskrona BoIS of Sweden and a 4–2 against Rapid Wien, the team that had inspired the Romanian side so much in the past, Rapid was eliminated again by an English side, this time Leeds United, 1–8.

At the end of the 1973–74 season, the &quot;White and Burgundies&quot; finished 16th, with the same number of points as Jiul Petroșani, but this time the club from the Jiu Valley would win because of higher scores. Rapid was relegated for the third time in its history, only 7 years since its first national title. The squad had a strong following season and was promoted after only one year spent in the second league, finishing 1st in the 2nd series, 6 points ahead of 2nd place Progresul București. &quot;The Railwaymen&quot; seemed to want to convince everyone that relegation was nothing but a regrettable error; so, they also won the Romanian Cup in the same season, surprisingly, being a second echelon team. In the 1974–75 Cupa României campaign, Rapid advanced by eliminating strong teams such as Dinamo București (2–1), Jiul Petroșani (1–0), Ceahlăul Piatra Neamț (1–0), and Steaua București (1–1, 6–5 on penalties). In the final they encountered Universitatea Craiova, the Divizia A defending champions, a club that was fielding its first golden generation (known as &quot;The Champion of a Great Love&quot;), led from the pitch by its legend, Ion Oblemenco. Rapid won 2–1, in extra time, with goals scored by Nicolae Manea, and Ion Oblemenco scoring for Craiova.

Back in Divizia A, Rapid had two mediocre seasons: 1975–76 – 14th and 1976–77 – 16th, being relegated again, 10 years since being champions of Romania. After this relegation began one of the darkest periods in the history of the club at their stadium near Grant Bridge, with 6 consecutive Divizia B seasons: 1977–78 – 4th, 1978–79 – 6th, 1979–80 – 2nd, 1980–81 – 3rd, 1981–82 – 2nd and 1982–83 – 1st. This period led to a fierce rivalry with Petrolul Ploiești and Progresul București. A 1980 match, against Progresul, saw a record attendance, for a Divizia B match, of over 50,000 spectators. The subsequent return to the first division was due to coaches Valentin Stănescu (who also brought the first title in 1967) and Viorel Kraus. The players were Ion Gabriel, Manu, Popescu, Paraschiv, Pirvu, Șișcă, Tiță, Iancu, Cojocaru, Ion Ion, Nicolae Manea, Ad. Dumitru, Petruț, Ispas, C. Dumitriu, Avram, Marian Damaschin, Marta, Lazăr, Koti, Săftoiu, A. Mincu, and Petre Petre.

Rapid then had a disappointing record in Divizia A: 1984–85 – 11th, 1985–86 – 8th, 1986–87 – 14th, 1987–88 – 13th, and 1988–89 – 17th. In these five seasons &quot;the Railwaymen&quot; recorded the biggest loss in the history of the club, 0–9 against Corvinul Hunedoara (14 August 1985), as well as the biggest loss in Giulești Stadium, 2–8 against Steaua București (3 May 1989). After these poor performances, the 1988–89 Cupa României season saw the &quot;White and Burgundies&quot; gaining the semi-finals of the competition, when they were eliminated by Steaua București, 2–3, with a decisive goal scored in the last minute. The team was relegated to Divizia B for the fifth time. The &quot;Giuleștenii&quot; then had a good season in the 2nd series of the second league—finishing 1st with 22 victories, 5 draws, 7 defeats, 61 goals scored and 32 conceded, 49 points, 4 more than the second place (Drobeta-Turnu Severin) and 11 more than the third place (Unirea Alba Iulia)—and were again promoted.

===1990–2008: A glorious period ===
Promoted back to the top league, in the next season Rapid finished 11th, 4 points away from the relegation zone. What followed was two seasons of progress in which &quot;the Railwaymen&quot; finished 7th, then 4th. In 1993, the club was bought by George Copos and began probably one of the most fruitful periods in the history of &quot;the White and Burgundies&quot;.

After the 4th-place finish at the end of the 1993 season, Rapid returned to the European Cups after 18 years of absence, but was eliminated in the first round by the Italian side Inter Milan, 1–5 on aggregate. In 1994, the club finished 4th again in Divizia A, but no one risked a prognosis for a team whose fortunes so oscillated. The 1994–95 UEFA Cup season again brought two tough opponents for the Giulești side: Charleroi of Belgium, which they eliminated 3–2 on aggregate, and Eintracht Frankfurt, which eliminated Rapid 2–6 on aggregate, especially due to the 0–5 defeat by Waldstadion. In the Divizia A, they again finished in 4th place, but this time with no qualification for the European Competitions.

In the 1995–96 season the team finished 3rd, qualifying again for the UEFA Cup. After a 2–0 victory on aggregate against Lokomotiv Sofia, &quot;the Railwaymen&quot; were eliminated by Karlsruher SC, 2–4 on aggregate, the second time a German side eliminated them. The squad finished 8th at the end of the 1996–97 season.

With Mircea Lucescu as the new coach, Rapid had a very good 1997–98 season, the best one in the last 22 seasons. In the championship, the team finished 2nd, only two points behind Steaua București, missing the chance of a title, the first one since 1967. In the last match of the season, with over 20,000 fans travelling from Bucharest, Rapid only managed a 2–2 draw against Universitatea Craiova, a result which was heavily contested after Rapid had a clear goal denied by the referee. Without title, Rapid focused on the Romanian Cup, where they won their 10th title, but the first one since 1975. In the final, they again met Craiova, with Lucian Marinescu&#x27;s 67th-minute goal securing the trophy. This triumph returned the team back to the UEFA Competitions, this time the 1998–99 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The 1998–99 season started off badly. After an 8–2 on aggregate win against Grevenmacher in the qualifying round, Rapid was again eliminated quickly, this time in the first round by Vålerenga, with a 2–2 on aggregate and 2 goals scored in the Giulești Stadium by the Norwegian club. In the championship, Rapid had one of the best seasons in the history of Divizia A, finishing 1st with 89 points and winning the much-desired title of champion of Romania, the 2nd one in the history of the club. This performance was obtained under coaches Mircea Lucescu (24 rounds), Nicolae Manea (5 rounds), Dumitru Dumitriu (4 rounds), and Mircea Rednic (1 round), with the following players: Marius Bratu, Bogdan Lobonț – Daniel Chiriță, Adrian Iencsi, Dorel Mutică, Ștefan Nanu, Vasile Popa, Răzvan Raț, Mircea Rednic, Nicolae Stanciu (C), Ion Voicu – Bogdan Andone, Constantin Barbu, Mugur Bolohan, Zeno Bundea, Dănuț Lupu, Ovidiu Maier, Marius Măldărășanu, Ioan Sabău, Cezar Zamfir – Ionel Ganea, Radu Niculescu, Daniel Pancu, Sergiu Radu, and Marius Șumudică. The team also included Cristian Dulca, Lucian Marinescu, and Stefan Nanu, who left during the winter break.

The 1999–2000 season was again a good one for Rapid. However, despite the fact that they were in 2nd place, with 15-point over 3rd place (Steaua București), they could not equal the nearly perfect season of Dinamo București, who ended in 1st place, by 12 points. Rapid also could not retain the Romanian championship, being eliminated in the semi-finals by FC U Craiova, 2–3 on aggregate. The UEFA Champions League was a great disappointment, the team being eliminated by the Latvian side Skonto, 4–5 on aggregate.

The 2000–01 season started with Anghel Iordănescu as the new coach and finished with Mircea Rednic at the helm. Post-season competition consisted of a 3–1 victory over Mika of Armenia, in the qualifying round, and a 0–1 loss to Liverpool, in the first round, which resulted in a 4th place in the European championship and a quarter-finals elimination in the Romanian Cup, after a 1–2 loss to Dinamo. The next season, with Viorel Hizo as the new coach, Rapid made another good run and finished 3rd in the league, and lasted two-rounds in the 2001–02 UEFA Cup: a lopsided 12–0 on aggregate victory over Atlantas, followed by an unexpected 0–0 tie, at Parc des Princes, against PSG, losing in the second round 0–1, by a goal by Aloísio in the 93rd minute. Finally, the match was called 0–3 after the floodlight system shut down. On the other hand, &quot;the Railwaymen&quot; won their 11th Romanian Cup, after a final in which they registered a 2–1 victory against Dinamo București, with goals scored by Marius Măldărășanu and Daniel Pancu, and with Mircea Rednic as the new coach.

The 2002–03 season saw the club win its third league title, finishing 1st with by 7 points over Steaua București The team lasted the usual two rounds in the UEFA Cup: 5–1 against Gorica and 1–2 against Vitesse, being eliminated, by penalties, by FC Argeș, in the second round of the Romanian Cup. The squad was coached by Mircea Rednic and was composed of the following players: Ionuț Curcă, Emilian Dolha, Răzvan Lucescu, Boban Savič – Nicolae Constantin, Adrian Iencsi, Vasile Maftei, Dănuț Perjă, Răzvan Raţ, Florin Șoavă, Ion Voicu – Valentin Bădoi, Roberto Bisconti, Emmanuel Godfroid, Nicolae Grigore, Róbert Ilyés, Ioan Sabău – Florin Bratu, Daniel Niculae and Robert Niță.

The 2003–04 season was below expectations. Starting under coach Mircea Rednic, continued with Dan Petrescu, and ending under Viorel Hizo, Rapid finished 3rd, 15 points out of 1st place, which was held by Dinamo București. In the UEFA Champions League, the &quot;Rapidiștii&quot; met Anderlecht in a 0–0 tie, in the Valentin Stănescu Stadium, followed by a 2–3 defeat, in Constant Vanden Stock Stadium, after Rapid had led 2–0; and the team was again eliminated in the first rounds of the competition. The 2004–05 season started with a new coach, Răzvan Lucescu, and &quot;the White and Burgundies&quot; finished again in 3rd place, six points out of 1st place. In the Romanian Cup they were eliminated in the first round by the Divizia B side Dacia Unirea Brăila, 0–1.

The 3rd place in the league qualified the club for the 2005–06 UEFA Cup season. Rapid had the best European season in the history of the club, starting from the first round of the competition, qualifying for the first time for the group stage, and only being eliminated in the quarter-finals. The team&#x27;s run was the following: 10–0 on aggregate against Sant Julià from Andorra, 4–1 against Vardar, and an unexpected 2–1 on aggregate against Feyenoord, and qualifying for the group stage. They were assigned to Group G, where they gained 3 victories: Rennes (2–0), Shakhtar Donetsk (1–0), PAOK (1–0), while losing only one match, against Stuttgart (1–2). If in the past Rapid was eliminated by German clubs such as Karlsruher SC or Eintracht Frankfurt, now the team was transformed in a real &quot;killer&quot; against the German sides, after a 3–0 victory against Hertha in the Round of 32 and a 3–3 tie, with an away goal scored against Hamburg. &quot;The Burgundy Eagles&quot; were stopped only in the quarter-finals by another Romanian side, FCSB, 1–1 on aggregate, with a goal scored by FCSB in Giulești. This was one of the most memorable seasons in the history of Rapid, FCSB, and Romanian football. Rapid also lost the Romanian title to FCSB, but won the Romanian Cup, after a 1–0 victory over Dinamo București. The squad in the 2005–06 European campaign was coached by Răzvan Lucescu and included the following players: Dănuț Coman, Ionuț Curcă, Apoula Edel, Mihai Mincă – Marius Constantin, Nicolae Constantin, Vasile Maftei, Dănuț Perjă, Marius Postolache, Ionuț Rada, Adrian Rusu, Ionuț Stancu – Valentin Bădoi, Emil Dică, Gigel Ene, Nicolae Grigore, Artavazd Karamyan, Marius Măldărăşanu, Valentin Negru, Romeo Stancu – Mugurel Buga, Lucian Burdujan, Viorel Moldovan, Daniel Niculae, Daniel Pancu, and Ciprian Vasilache.

In the following two seasons, Rapid ended in 4th (2006–07) and 3rd (2007–08) places, with another Romanian Cup title in 2007, in a final won 2–0 against Politehnica Timișoara in Dan Păltinișanu Stadium. In the UEFA Cup, they were constant participations, with another group-stage presence in the 2006–07 season, but finishing 4th, in a group with PSG, Mladá Boleslav, Hapoel Tel Aviv, and Panathinaikos, missing qualifying for the semi-finals. The next season saw a first-round elimination, to FC Nürnberg.

===2008–2016: Rapid &quot;in derailment&quot; ===

After the 2007–08 season, the financial situation of Rapid was complicated, partly by the criminal conviction of the owner, George Copos, on charges of tax evasion, illegal transfers, and misuse of the lottery. The team performances also declined. After finishing 3rd in 2007–08, Rapid occupied mid-level places three times over the next five years: 2008–09 – 8th, 2009–10 – 7th and 2012–13 – 9th. Still, the team had a last burst of success in the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons, when, under coaches Marius Șumudică, Marian Rada, and Răzvan Lucescu, they achieved two consecutive 4th-place rankings, with a new presence in the UEFA Europa League. They finished the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League season in the group stage, after they eliminated Polish side Śląsk Wrocław in the play-off round, making only 3 points in a group with Hapoel Tel Aviv, PSV Eindhoven, and Legia Warsaw occupying last place. Next season was slightly weaker, with Rapid eliminated in the third qualifying round, after a two-legged match against Heerenveen, previously having eliminated the Finnish club MYPA, 5–1 on aggregate.

On 10 May 2013, the Disciplinary Commission of the Romanian Football Federation decided not to grant the Liga I license to the club for the 2013–14 season. At the end of the season the club was sold by George Copos to Nicolae Cristescu and Adrian Zamfir.

On 6 July the FRF Executive Committee decided that 18 teams would participate in the first league. Mircea Sandu announced that a play-off between Concordia Chiajna (which relegated on the pitch) and Rapid (which was relegated on legal terms) would be held to decide the 18th team. This match took place on 13 July 2013 in Dinamo Stadium and was won by &quot;the Railwaymen&quot; 2–1. Concordia challenged the legality of this play-off match, as Rapid had no license for Liga I. After two rounds had already been played, on 2 August 2013 the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) decided that the organization of the play-off match was irregular and Concordia must remain in the top league, Rapid being relegated.

Relegated for the sixth time to the second league, and after a period of 23 years spent in the top league with excellent performances, Rapid gathered all its forces, despite a poor financial situation and an under-funding from the new owners. Under coach Viorel Moldovan, former player on the team, &quot;the Burgundy Eagles&quot; had a good season, finishing 2nd in the regular season, as well as in the play-off round of the 2013–14 season, right behind Politehnica Iași and two points above Unirea Slobozia, ensuring their promotion to the first league. On 17 May 2014, the Licensing Commission of the Romanian Football Federation again decided not to grant the necessary license, this time for the 2014–15 season of Liga I. Rapid decided to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but could not initially afford the €30,000, trial fee. The money for the fee was eventually donated by club supporters, and CAS admitted the appeal, forcing the Romanian Football Federation to grant Rapid a license for the Liga I season.

In the meantime, the club was bought by Valerii Moraru, a Moldovan businessman; but under coaches Ionel Ganea, Marian Rada, Cristian Pustai, and Cristiano Bergodi, the team had a very weak season, finishing only 16th, out of 18, and being relegated back to Liga II, for the seventh time.

Back in Liga II, with Dan Alexa as a coach, Rapid had a solid season, despite the fact that debts suffocated the club; and the under-funding by the new owner did not help. At the end of the 2015–16 season, Rapid was promoted, being in 1st place, three points ahead of Dunărea Călărași. However, the club did not recover financially; the team kept only a few players and no coaches. After filing for bankruptcy, FC Rapid could not sign any new contracts, so it could not build a team for the 2016–17 season. Finally, on 14 December 2016, Rapid was officially declared bankrupt, after a half-season of inactivity.

=== 2016–present: Rebirth ===

In summer 2016, after it became clear that the team could no longer be enrolled in the championship, the idea of setting up somewhere in the lower leagues appeared, more exactly, in the Bucharest Championship, Liga V. A split between the supporters and the people directly involved in the club appeared, resulting in two new clubs, &quot;AFC Rapid București&quot; and &quot;Mişcarea Feroviară CFR&quot;, after initially not less than four teams had been announced; but most of the projects did not survive. If &quot;AFC Rapid&quot;, owned by ex-Rapid marketing director, Horia Manoliu, who was in fact an old executive of the parent club, between 2001 and 2006. &quot;Mişcarea Feroviară&quot; was founded by the members of the Rapid Aristocratic Club. Both teams had an excellent run and were promoted to Liga IV.

The two clubs did not seem to have the force to succeed in the with the new promotion. So, in summer 2017, at the initiative of Sector 1 Municipality, the sports association, Academia Rapid București, was set up and enrolled in the Liga IV – Bucharest series. This club is run by former Rapid players such as Daniel Niculae (president), Daniel Pancu (technical director), Nicolae Stanciu (manager), and Constantin Schumacher (coach). By the time the auction for the bankrupt company&#x27;s brand was finalized, Academia Rapid concluded a lease agreement for a period of one year. This team has proven to be popular among supporters, who consider it the moral successor of the parent club. In the same summer, &quot;Mișcarea Feroviară&quot; disappeared.

Academia Rapid had a great season and won 2017–18 Liga IV Bucharest after a tough duel with Steaua București. Also, the Romanian Cup trophy for Bucharest preliminary rounds entered the club&#x27;s treasury and the phoenix club of Rapid qualified for the next season&#x27;s Liga III after a two-legged promotion play-off match against FC Singureni, the Giurgiu County champions, which they won 17–1 on aggregate.

On 12 June 2018, after 18 auctions which saw the price of the Rapid brand fall by about €3 million, Academia Rapid bought the FC Rapid București brand, officially becoming the successor to the original club. The transaction was made for the amount of €406,800, thus giving legitimacy to the new entity, even though it had already been accepted by most supporters and legends of the club as the successor of the original club, a fact confirmed in the championship match against Steaua București on 14 April, when 37,000 fans attended the match in the Arena Națională.

The start of the 2018–19 season came with a number of difficulties for Rapid. Despite being 1st in the league, the football produced by the team suffered, and, as a result, coach Constantin Schumacher was replaced with former-player Daniel Pancu, which also led to the departures of Daniel Niculae and Vasile Maftei. On 24 November, Rapid played its last game in Giulesti, which was going to be demolished later that year to make space for a new Category 4 Stadium. They would play future matches at Regie until the completion of their new stadium. On 12 May, Rapid mathematically obtained the promotion to Liga II with a 3–0 win against the main contender, Unirea Slobozia. They finished the season in first with 75 points, 11 ahead of second place.

The new 2019–20 season saw Rapid in the Romanian second Division, with Daniel Pancu as the head coach of the team. Victories against 1st and 2nd-ranked teams, UTA Arad (2–0) and CS Mioveni (5–1), gave the team hope for promotion, and Rapid found themselves in 3rd place after the first half of the season. The winter break came, and after a poor start to the second half of the season, Daniel Pancu was sacked from the club. Dan Alexa was appointed as the new head coach of the team. Exactly as with Daniel Pancu, Dan Alexa didn&#x27;t succeed in giving the club a boost; so, he was sacked from the club in a few months&#x27; time. After Dan Alexa, Adrian Iencsi was hired as head coach; he also didn&#x27;t perform. As the club had no more ideas of whom to bring on the team, they let Mihai Iosif, the assistant coach of the club, become the new head coach. Iosif did what none of his predecessors could do, and brought Rapid to the first Romanian League (Liga I). Rapid began the 2021–22 season in the Liga I very well, with five consecutive wins and no goals conceded in seven matches, which is a record in Romania.

== Crest and colours ==
=== Colors ===
The official colors of the club are white and burgundy, from those of the capital of Romania. These can be found on the coat of arms and equipment used throughout its long history. These were chosen by Teofil Copaci, Grigore Grigoriu, Dumitru Constantinescu, Géza Ginzer, Tudor Petre, and Franz Hladt, who founded the club. The first equipment was made from burgundy cloth in Grigore Grigoriu&#x27;s house, and the boots with crampons were reconditioned from used boots from Ateliere.

=== Crest ===
The crest of the Rapid Bucharest was usually composed of the CFR-ist symbol. In a short period after the beginning of the communist system in Romania, Rapidul was forced by the communist authorities to return to the name &quot;CFR Bucharest&quot;. In 1950, it would become &quot;Locomotiva Bucharest&quot;, with a red steam locomotive as its symbol. From 1958, the club renamed itself &quot;Rapid Bucharest&quot;, adopting the logo that changed relatively little until the purchase of the club by George Copos, who changed the coat of arms upon his arrival. In 2001, Rapid&#x27;s current crest was chosen. It turned out that the source of inspiration is, it seems, an emblematic club of Europe, namely Benfica Lisbon, the most successful club in Portugal, on whose emblem appears a legendary eagle.

=== Anthem ===
The Rapid anthem, also known as &quot;We are everywhere at home&quot;, was composed by Victor Socaciu, with lyrics by Adrian Păunescu. This anthem was born in June 1980, at the Flacăra editorial office, Adrian Păunescu meeting with Victor Socaciu, Ovidiu Ioanițoaia, a sports journalist at &quot;Flacăra&quot; magazine, and with Victor Niță, also from &quot;Flacăra&quot;. The motifs for the hymn came quickly to Păunescu, and he started composing on the spot. At the same time, Ovidiu Ioanițoaia was writing the dictated verses on a napkin. At the centenary of the club, the football club and the sports club created a music album, on which the president of the club Daniel Niculae also sang.

==Grounds==
===Stadium===
The history of Giulești-Valentin Stănescu Stadium begins in 1934; on 31 March, CFR began the construction of a field on the Giulești Road. The field would have a width of 65 m and a length of 105 m.

At first, the mayor of Bucharest did not want to authorize the construction of the first stadium, because it did not fit in the systematization of the capital. Eventually, authorization was given; and in April 1936 it was estimated that the stadium would be ready in September. The construction did begin in that year but it lasted more than two. The chief architect was Gheorghe Dumitrescu.

The stadium was inaugurated on 10 June 1939. At the time, it was the most modern stadium in Romania, a smaller replica of Arsenal&#x27;s Highbury Stadium, with a capacity of 12,160 seats. Among the guests at the opening ceremony was King Carol II and his son, future King Michael of Romania.

The construction of the north stands was finished in the mid-1990s, with the capacity increased to 19,100 seats. In 2003, the pitch was changed and was considered to be the best in Romania at the time. Floodlights were installed in the summer of 2000. The stadium got the name of &quot;Valentin Stănescu&quot; in 2001, in respect of the manager who won the first championship for Rapid, but it is still commonly known as &quot;Giulești Stadium&quot;, from the name of the neighborhood it is located in. Landmarks near the stadium are the Grant Bridge, Giulești Theatre, Gara de Nord (North Station), and the Grivița Railway Yards.

The stadium was closed on 24 November 2018, and the demolition process took place from 10 January to 7 May 2019, making room for the modern 14,000-seat Rapid Arena. The new stadium&#x27;s construction will be funded by the Romanian government and UEFA, after Bucharest was announced as one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020.

After the closing of Giulești Stadium, Rapid moved temporarily on the Regie Stadium in Bucharest, the former home ground of Sportul Studențesc. Regie Stadium was closed in 2014 after a conflict between Sportul and the stadium&#x27;s owner, a fact that led to its degradation. Before moving, the white and burgundies needed to invest in the reconstruction of their new stadium, which began in January 2019.

After its promotion in Liga I in the summer of 2021, the team played its home fixtures at the Arena Națională. The new Stadium Rapid-Giulești, known as Superbet Arena for sponsorship reasons, was inaugurated on 26 March 2022. It cost €67 million and can hold up to 14,050 spectators.

=== Training Facilities ===
Located in the north-western side of Bucharest, in the Bucharest Noi district, the ProRapid sports center was purchased by the then owner George Copos at the request of Mircea Lucescu, the coach who won the second championship, and was inaugurated in 1998. Initially, the complex had four football fields and a modern training facility. But, over the years, the structure has deteriorated due to the carelessness of the owners. Still, at the end of the 90s, &quot;Pro Rapid&quot; was considered the most modern training base in the country.

The facility spans five hectares and includes several playgrounds, three tennis courts, and an indoor swimming pool. There is a building where the players used to train. The facility is surrounded by Lake Străulesti, around which several buildings are distributed: the second building in order of size houses the living accommodations for the players on the first floor, medical rooms on the ground floor (including physiotherapy and rehabilitation), changing rooms (for players and coach), and a gym. The accommodation for the players of the youth teams is located in a building that includes a bar and a restaurant. In June 2016, the company SC FC Rapid SA was declared bankrupt by the Bucharest Court and the ProRapid base entered a period of continuous deterioration. At the moment, the football team is training at the Coresi training base.

==Support==

Rapid București is, according to a 2013 survey, the third-most supported club in Romania and the second in the Bucharest metropolitan area, around 20% of football lovers in the city being supporters of Rapid. A unique organization in the country is the &quot;Aristocratic Club of Rapid&quot;, which was founded in 2000. Its members include well-known artists, who aim to defend the history of Rapid and maintain its traditions.

However, at the beginning, being the railway club, drew its supporters mostly from people linked with the workers. The first waves of new fans came at the beginning of the 1930s, when Rapid&#x27;s legendary golden team won the hearts of many people delighted by their spectacular play and the consecutive wins of the Romanian Cup between 1935 and 1942 .

In 1967, actor Mihai Ioan organised and taught the supporters how to sing chants, thus becoming the first leader of the gallery in the club&#x27;s history. Currently, Rapid ultras are represented by &quot;Peluza Nord&quot; and also formerly by &quot;Tribuna II (t2 Rapid)&quot;. Until 2002, Rapid Bucharest had a head of the gallery who stood at the head of the fans for 32 years, Constantin Mincea, Geamgiul. He is known for chanting against the communist party during Romania&#x27;s communist regime, Rapid&#x27;s fans had some chants that targeted the Ceaușescu family, the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), and clubs they considered as being protected by the regime, such as Steaua București, Dinamo București, Victoria București, Olt Scornicești, and Flacăra Moreni. Rapid fans were the first in Romania to support the ultras movement in the 1980s, but the first ultras groups were founded in 1998, named as &quot;Official Hooligans&quot;, &quot;Bombardierii&quot;, and &quot;Ultras Unione&quot;. Later, others appeared such as: &quot;Maniacs&quot;, &quot;Brigada 921&quot;, &quot;Grant Ultras 06&quot;, &quot; Radicals&quot;, &quot;Torcida Visinie&quot;, &quot;Chicos del Infierno (CDI) 2005&quot;, &quot;Ultra&#x27; Stil&quot;, &quot;Legiunea Chitila&quot;, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;Granata Girls&quot;, &quot;SVRB&quot;, &quot;Colletivo&quot;, &quot;RHV&quot;, &quot;Original&quot;, &quot;Capitali&quot;, &quot;Legione Titan&quot;, and there were also groups in the provinces, in cities such as: Iași, Pașcani, Piatra Neamț, Zalău, and Târgu Mureș. In 2007, the ultras group, &quot;Pirații&quot;, moved to the second stands of the stadium, following divergences with the leader of the &quot;Peluza Nord&quot;. They were followed by other brigades from the &quot;Peluza Nord&quot;.

&quot;t2 Rapid (Piratii, CDI, Ultra&#x27; Stil)&quot; does not have a leader, distinguishing it from the other group. Over time there have been many conflicts between the two factions, and as a result, the members of &quot;Tribuna II&quot; groups left definitely, founding a new team, &quot;ACS Rapid-Frumosii Nebuni ai Giulestiului&quot;. One of the most publicized incidents in Romanian football was the &quot;Bricheta&quot; case, when the Bucharest derby was stopped and Rapid lost 0–3.

The supporters from Politehnica Timișoara and Rapid are bound by a friendship of 30 years. The beginnings of this friendship was at the final of the Romanian Cup in the 1980-81 season, when the Rapid-Pandurii and Politehnica Timișoara-U Craiova matches were played together. The Olten people present at the match showed solidarity, which is why the Timişoara and Giulești supporters had to support each other. After the Revolution, the supporters from the rapid gallery came to Timisoara with wreaths that they laid at the heroes&#x27; cemetery, to commemorate those who died in December 1989.

== Club rivalries ==

=== Bucharest Derby ===
The club&#x27;s most important rivalries are against neighbouring FC Steaua București. The two clubs have played each other over 130 times, beginning with Rapid&#x27;s 1–0 victory on November 4, 1947. Several matches throughout the years between Steaua and Rapid have ended in serious clashes between fans. The two teams are notable for their dominance of Romanian football, alongside Dinamo. The conflict has become even fiercer after Steaua passed Rapid in an all-Romanian quarter-final of the 2005–06 UEFA Cup. The rivalry also extends to other sports. The local sports newspapers said that the two teams were linked in this quarter-final by the Number 41 tram which links the Ghencea Stadium with the Valentin Stănescu Stadium. The rivalry also extends to other sports.

=== Primvs Derby ===
Another bitter rival of Rapid is Petrolul Ploiești, which was previously based in the capital and with which it contests the Primus Derby, the oldest football derby in Romania. This is a fierce one where the galleries fight in increasingly beautiful choreographies and push their favorites. The first episode of the Petrolul-Rapid rivalry was in the 1965-66 season, Petrolul and Rapid fought for the title of Romanian champion, and Prahoven won. The team trained at that time by Constantin Cernăianu prevailed over the rival and won the last championship title in the history of the club. A year later, Rapid got revenge and won the first title, after a draw in Ploiesti. In the battle with Dinamo for the first place, the Giuleșteni needed a point in the match with Petrolul in the last stage. Rică Răducanu and his colleagues got the equaliser, score 0-0, and the Rapid supporters returned on foot from Ploiesti, as they had promised before the match.

Among the thousands of fans was Ioana Radu, the well-known popular music singer and a big fan of the rapidists. At the end of the 1973-1974 season, both teams were relegated together to Division B. In the period 1978–1982, both teams were in Division B. The culminating match between the two took place in the spring of 1982, at Stadionul Steaua, in front of 35,000 spectators, in the 30th stage of Division B. The Rapidists prevailed with a clear 5–1 win. Another landmark match between the two teams was the final of the Romanian Cup in 1995, at the end of which Petrolul won the second cup in their history, after defeating Rapid on penalty kicks. During the 1983-2004 period, both teams were in Division A, with Petrolul subsequently relegating at the end of the 2003–04 season. The rivalry also extends to other sports.

Rapid had other Bucharest rivals, such as Dinamo Bucuresti, Progresul București, and Venus București, as well as derbies against teams of the Romanian Railways such as CFR Cluj and CFR Timișoara. Other, less important rivalries are with Universitatea Cluj, Farul Constanța, Universitatea Craiova, and UTA Arad.

== Ownership and finances ==
Rapid is a joint-stock company since 1992. The property is divided as follows: 50% is attributed to Victor Angelescu and Dan Sucu, and the remaining 3% belongs to Academia Rapid Bucharest 1923. After a first bankruptcy, FC Rapid could no longer register new contracts, so they could not build a team to enter the 2016–17 season. Finally, on 14 December 2016, Rapid was officially declared bankrupt after half a season of inactivity. Since 1992, the giulestea club was led by the businessman George Copos, who then led the club to two championships in 2013. After his conviction in the Transfer File, he sold the club to Nicolae Cristescu, who led the club only 3 years, it then being bought by Valerii Moraru.

On 12 June 2018, after 18 auctions during which the price of the Rapid brand dropped by approximately 3 million euros, Academia Rapid bought the Rapid Bucharest brand, officially becoming the successor of the original club. The transaction was for the sum of €406,800, thus giving legitimacy to the new entity, although it had already been accepted by most of the club&#x27;s supporters and legends as the club&#x27;s successor. On 26 July 2018 Victor Angelescu bought approximately 40% of the club&#x27;s shares and later in 2022, he acquired the majority of the shares, becoming the majority shareholder of the Giulestean club. On 24 May 2022 businessman Dan Sucu purchased 50% of the club&#x27;s shares.

With Valentin Stănescu he won the first championship in 1967, and was followed by Mircea Lucescu who won the championship in 1999 and with Mircea Rednic the championship in 2003.

Rapid&#x27;s most successful coach is Valentin Stănescu with whom Giulesteni managed historical performances, led the team when they won the Balkan Cup twice and the national championship in 1966. One of Giulesti&#x27;s most famous coaches was Ion Motroc who spent 9 years as a player; as a coach he caused one of the biggest surprises of Romanian football, by winning the Romanian Cup from the of Second Division. Razvan Lucescu led from 2004 to 2007, when he managed the club&#x27;s greatest European performance, finishing fourth in Romania&#x27;s UEFA Cup. Ștefan Auer won back-to-back Romanian Cups in the interwar period; Iuliu Baratky also won back-to-back Romanian Cups. Bazil Marian was the manager who returned the cup to Giulesti after a 30-year spell. In the history of Rapid there have been many presidents, the first was Teofil Copaci, who founded the club and led Rapid in the interwar period. The club was led by the Ministry of Transport in the period before the leadership of George Copos, under whom Dinu Gheorghe was club president. Afterwards, this position varied from person to person; among the most important leaders of Rapid were Grigore Sichitiu, Nicolae Manea. In 2003, the president Ioan Becali and Dan Petrescu were prompted by their status as &#x27;Dinamo&#x27; and &#x27;Steaua&#x27; fan to kiss the Rapid flag, this was a remarkable moment of the 2000s.

== Popular culture ==
As Rapid is currently one of the most popular football team in Romania, a good number of musicians, TV, and film directors have been inspired from ideas linked to the Giulesti-based club. Popular references, however, appeared only after the Romanian Revolution, as, before, mass-media programmes were mostly being controlled by the communist regime. The Prima TV comedy show &quot;Trăsniții&quot; in one episode, showed the Pupaza character in the role of a Rapid supporter. Also, in 2022 the series on Pro TV &quot;Las Fierbinti&quot; had some characters as Rapid fans. 

Several other examples from music can be attributed as Rapid-related. Apart from club anthems played throughout time by Adrian Păunescu. Rapid has a lot of supporters, many of whom are celebrities in Romania: for example Fărâmită Lambru, Maria Tanase, Dan Grigore, Horia Brenciu, Mircea Geoană, Ion Iliescu, and Nicolae Vacaroiu.

<text>Marshall University – South Charleston Campus is a branch campus of Marshall University located in South Charleston, West Virginia.

The institution traces its roots to extension graduate programs offered by both Marshall University and West Virginia University throughout West Virginia, and particularly in the metropolitan Charleston, West Virginia area prior to 1969.

In that year, the state reorganized its extension graduate system. WVU was limited to, except in a few subjects, offering extension programs in the northern part of the state, MU was limited to the four counties surrounding the main campus in Huntington, and a graduate only &quot;College of Graduate Studies&quot; (sometimes incorrectly called &quot;The West Virginia College of Graduate Studies&quot;) was founded. The college had no campus of its own, and almost no faculty. It had some offices at West Virginia State College and offered classes on that campus and at locations throughout the rest of southern West Virginia, drawing its faculty from those of West Virginia State College, Concord College, Bluefield State College, Glenville State College and other institutions. The college also utilized adjunct faculty drawn from industry in the Kanawha Valley.

The name, which lacked a geographic identifier, as well as the &quot;impact&quot; of a well-known college, was later briefly changed first to &quot;The University of West Virginia College of Graduate Studies&quot; and then to the &quot;West Virginia Graduate College&quot;.

In 1992 the school got a campus of its own, moving to land donated by the Union Carbide Corporation near its research facility. The next year, the state again reorganized its graduate education system, merging the West Virginia Graduate College and the on-campus graduate programs of Marshall University under the name &quot;Marshall University Graduate College&quot;.

In 2010 the state authorized Marshall to begin offering extension undergraduate programs at the South Charleston location, and the facility was renamed the &quot;Marshall University - South Charleston Campus&quot;, and commonly now known as &quot;Marshall-South Charleston&quot;.

<text>CHYC-FM is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts at 98.9 FM in Sudbury, Ontario. It broadcasts a francophone hot adult contemporary format for the city&#x27;s Franco-Ontarian community. It is owned by Le5 Communications, and branded as &quot;Le Loup 98.9&quot;.

CHYC and its sister stations CHYK-FM in Timmins and CHYQ-FM in West Nipissing are the only francophone commercial stations programmed entirely in Ontario. Apart from commercials and local weather updates, the three stations now simulcast the same programming at virtually all times; although all three stations formerly produced their own individual morning shows and then each hosted a later daypart within a shared broadcast schedule for the remainder of the day, all of the stations are now programmed from Sudbury.

==History==
The station first aired on December 8, 1957 as 550 AM CFBR, a sister station to CHNO and a private affiliate of Radio-Canada. CHNO had previously been a bilingual station; when CFBR went to air, CHNO became full-time English. The &quot;FBR&quot; in the station&#x27;s callsign stood for F. Baxter Ricard, who owned the stations with his wife Alma Ricard. The licensing of CFBR, which took over the Radio-Canada affiliation from CHNO, made Ricard the first commercial broadcaster in Canada licensed to operate two AM radio stations in the same city.

In 1969, CFBR and CHNO swapped frequencies. CHNO took over the 550 AM signal, and CFBR moved to 900. CFBR remained a Radio-Canada affiliate until the launch of CBON in 1978, and adopted a pop standards format thereafter. After losing the Radio-Canada affiliation, for a time the station&#x27;s remaining audience was so small that its co-ownership with CHNO, the city&#x27;s dominant English radio station at the time, was the only thing keeping it afloat.

In 1985, Ricard sold CFBR, CHNO and CJMX to Mid-Canada Radio, although as a minority shareholder in that company he retained a partial ownership stake.

The station adopted its current call sign and format in 1990, after the three stations were acquired by Pelmorex Radio Network. Pelmorex sold the stations in 1998, when Telemedia acquired CJMX, and 1999, when Haliburton Broadcasting Group acquired CHYC and CHNO. Haliburton subsequently converted both stations to FM after receiving approval from the CRTC on August 31, 1999. In 2000, the stations first aired on FM and discontinued their old AM signals. CHYC moved to 98.9 FM in early 2000 and simulcast on AM 900, until it left the air on March 31 of that year after the licensee resolved a technical problem relating to the implementation of the new FM transmitter. 

During CHYC&#x27;s (formerly CFBR) existence on AM 900, the station had suffered some co-channel interference during the nighttime hours from 900 CHML Hamilton, making it unlistenable in the areas of Greater Sudbury including the outlying areas. CHYC never applied for any signal upgrades or frequency changes on the AM band until its move to FM 98.9 in 2000.

Haliburton subsequently sold CHNO to Newcap Broadcasting in 2001. Despite no longer having common ownership, CHYC and CHNO continued to operate from the same studio facility at 493 Barrydowne Road in Sudbury.

In 2008, Haliburton announced a deal to sell the CHYC stations to Le5 Communications, a firm owned by Sudbury lawyer Paul Lefebvre. This deal was approved by the CRTC on October 31, 2008.

Le5 Communications rebranded the station as &quot;Le Loup 98.9&quot; in early 2009, and moved the station to new studios at 100 Brian McKee Lane in downtown Sudbury. Musician and actor Stéphane Paquette also joined the station as an afternoon host. He has since been succeeded in the afternoon slot by Dayv Poulin, his former bandmate in Les Chaizes Muzikales.

In 2011, Le5 Communications filed an application to change the station&#x27;s authorized signal contours by increasing the effective radiated power from 1,400 to 4,620 watts (from class A to class B1) and by increasing the effective height of the antenna above average terrain from 165.3 to 181.9 metres). The CRTC approved Le5&#x27;s application on September 28, 2011.

The company also purchased Sudbury&#x27;s existing francophone community newspaper &quot;Le Voyageur&quot; in 2011.

Undated, CHYC-FM moved into their new studios at 336 Pine Street in Sudbury. 

==Rebroadcasters==
A community group in Chapleau, Formation Plus, holds an independent license to rebroadcast the signal of CHYC. This transmitter operates on 95.9 FM in Chapleau with the call sign CHAP-FM.

<text>CHYK-FM is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts at 104.1 FM in Timmins, Ontario. It broadcasts a francophone hot adult contemporary format for the city&#x27;s Franco-Ontarian community. It is owned by Le5 Communications, and branded as &quot;Le Loup 104.1&quot;.

CHYK and its sister stations CHYC-FM in Sudbury and CHYQ-FM in West Nipissing are the only francophone commercial stations programmed entirely in Ontario.

==History==
The station was originally established on December 23, 1951, by J. Conrad Lavigne, with the callsign CFCL at 580 kHz. CFCL was Ontario&#x27;s first French language radio station. It operated as a private affiliate of Radio-Canada&#x27;s French radio network. CFLH in Hearst began broadcasting the same year. In 1956, Lavigne also established CFCL-TV, a private CBC Television affiliate, in the city.

In 1957, CFLK began broadcasting at 1230 kHz in Kapuskasing. In 1960, CFCL in Timmins moved from 580 kHz to 620 kHz.

On July 28, 1975, Lavigne was denied an application to change CFCL&#x27;s frequency from 620 to 850 kHz with an increase in night-time power from 5,000 to 10,000 watts, with daytime power remaining at 10,000 watts. The station would have switched from different day and night patterns to directional at night only, to protect Class-A clear-channel station KOA in Denver. The partner application to use the 620 kHz frequency in Sudbury with 10,000 watts day and 5,000 watts night (single directional pattern) was also denied.

In 1979, Lavigne again attempted to change CFCL&#x27;s frequency and launch a new station in Sudbury. The application, which was identical to the one filed in 1975, was yet again denied. That year, competing broadcasters CKAP Kapuskasing (which had proposed a rebroadcast station in Timmins on 1450 kHz with 10,000 watts day and 5,000 watts at night) and Lavigne and Cambrian Broadcasting (competing for a license for a new AM station at 730 kHz with 10,000 watts in North Bay) also had their applications denied on April 12, 1979.

In 1980, Lavigne&#x27;s broadcast holdings were eventually merged into the Mid-Canada Communications system. When that company acquired several other radio stations in 1985, CFCL became a commercial station as part of the Mid-Canada Radio network, and disaffiliated from Radio-Canada.

On December 13, 1984, the CRTC approved a number of applications for a number of AM radio stations across Ontario including CFLH Hearst to increase their nighttime power from 250 watts to 1,000 watts.

Mid-Canada Radio was sold to the Pelmorex Radio Network in 1990. Because the radio and television station no longer had common ownership, the radio station&#x27;s callsign was subsequently changed to CKOY. CFLH (1340 kHz) in Hearst later adopted the call sign CHOH, and was converted to 92.9 MHz in 1995, while CFLK in Kapuskasing adopted the call sign CHYK.

Pelmorex, in turn, sold its stations to the Haliburton Broadcasting Group in 1999. CKOY was converted to 104.1 FM, and took over the CHYK callsign from its rebroadcaster in Kapuskasing. The Kapuskasing (AM 1230 kHz) rebroadcaster was in turn converted to FM 93.7 MHz in 2003 and later adopted its current callsign CHYX-FM.

In 2008, Haliburton announced a deal to sell the CHYC stations to Le5 Communications, a firm owned by Sudbury lawyer Paul Lefebvre. This deal was approved by the CRTC on October 31, 2008. Le5 Communications rebranded the station as Le Loup in early 2009.

In 2010, Le5 Communications also launched the weekly community newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Express de Timmins&quot;.

On March 2, 2012, Le5 Communications received approval from the CRTC to change the authorized contours of the station&#x27;s rebroadcaster in Hearst, by changing the antenna radiation pattern from directional to non-directional, increasing the average effective radiated power (ERP) from 140 to 172 watts (maximum ERP from 140 to 221 watts), decreasing the effective height of antenna above average terrain from 56.6 to 43 metres and relocating the antenna site.

In 2016, Le5 Communications announced that it was closing the station&#x27;s transmitters in Hearst and Kapuskasing.

A historical plaque in the city&#x27;s Mattagami Park commemorates the station&#x27;s historic role in the local Franco-Ontarian community.

<doc id="1240339" wikidata="Q648459" url="?curid=1240339" title="Drastic Measures">
<text>Drastic Measures is the ninth studio album by American rock band Kansas, released in 1983.

The shift in direction that Kansas took with &quot;Vinyl Confessions&quot; took its toll before recording began on this album. After hearing that Christian fans of Kansas were using lyrics from &quot;Vinyl Confessions&quot; in religious tracts and handing them out prior to the band&#x27;s live appearances, violinist Robby Steinhardt grew tired of Kansas&#x27; new Christian affiliation and quit the band at the end of the 1982 tour.

Despite the success of &quot;Vinyl Confessions,&quot; both among mainstream and Christian audiences, the album was criticized in some quarters — especially by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; — for being too repetitive of Kansas&#x27; prior efforts. &quot;Drastic Measures&quot; was new lead singer John Elefante&#x27;s attempt to change that perception, and his compositions dominate the album, with Kansas co-founder Kerry Livgren only contributing three tracks. Because the sound of &quot;Drastic Measures&quot; is more akin to the successful records that Loverboy and Foreigner were putting out at the time, Livgren was greatly displeased. This is bluntly expressed in his lyrics for &quot;Mainstream&quot;, which are as much a criticism of the band&#x27;s new direction as they are a slam at the music industry in general.

With the exception of the last three songs on the record, any Christian lyrical content was mostly indirect and oblique, although this was primarily due to Livgren holding back a number of songs for his future projects. Combined with a strange choice for an album cover, the new Kansas presented on &quot;Drastic Measures&quot; confused long-time fans and disappointed Christian listeners. The album was the band&#x27;s lowest-charting record since their debut in 1974 and the tensions within the band eventually became too much. Kansas officially disbanded after giving a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert at the end of their 1983 tour, although Ehart, Williams, and Elefante stayed to record the song &quot;Perfect Lover&quot; for &quot;The Best of Kansas&quot; compilation album.

Livgren and Dave Hope left the band to found AD, while Elefante went on to become a successful producer of contemporary Christian music bands like Petra as well as a popular CCM performer in his own right; as of 2021 he has never performed with Kansas again.

One of the first rock videos (along with &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;New Frontier&quot;) to be shot on 35-mm film and exhibited in movie theaters as a trailer, the music video for &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot;, directed by Dominic Orlando, was released theatrically across the U.S. in 1983 as a short subject with Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;. The song reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Chart and No. 58 on the Hot 100. The song also appeared on &quot;Kansas: Small Anthology&quot; and on every version of The &quot;Awesome Kansas Mix&quot;.

The album was re-released on CD in remastered form in February 1996 on Legacy/Epic Records, then again in 2011 on Rock Candy Records.

<text>The Infolepsy EP was released in 2004 on Coredump Records by breakcore artist Venetian Snares. It consists of 5 tracks, three on the A side and two on the B side. It was also released on CD. The first track samples almost exclusively from the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; segment &quot;Pinball Number Count&quot;, while the second track, &quot;Where&#x27;s Bill?&quot;, samples heavily from the Quentin Tarantino film &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. The track &quot;Americanized&quot; samples a pamphlet by conspiracy theorist Francis E. Dec from a spoken word recording made of it by Boyd &quot;Doc&quot; Britton (now &quot;Doc on the Roq&quot; for the radio station KROQ-FM). Punishing2004 is a remix of Punishing The Atoms from printf(&quot;shiver in eternal darkness/n&quot;);.

The EP was reissued on May 26, 2013 as a digital download on Bandcamp.

<doc id="1240344" wikidata="Q6496516" url="?curid=1240344" title="Latin influence in English">
<text>Although English is a Germanic language, it has significant Latin influences. Its grammar and core vocabulary are inherited from Proto-Germanic, but a significant portion of the English vocabulary comes from Romance and Latinate sources. A portion of these borrowings come directly from Latin, but some also from Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish; or from other languages (such as Gothic, Frankish or Greek) into Latin and then into English. The influence of Latin in English, therefore, is primarily lexical in nature, being confined mainly to words derived from Latin and Greek roots.

==Early Middle Ages==
The Germanic tribes who later gave rise to the English language traded and fought with the Latin speaking Roman Empire. Many words for common objects entered the vocabulary of these Germanic people from Latin even before the tribes reached Britain: &quot;anchor&quot;, &quot;butter&quot;, &quot;camp&quot;, &quot;cheese&quot;, &quot;chest&quot;, &quot;cook&quot;, &quot;copper&quot;, &quot;devil&quot;, &quot;dish&quot;, &quot;fork&quot;, &quot;gem&quot;, &quot;inch&quot;, &quot;kitchen&quot;, &quot;mile&quot;, &quot;mill&quot;, &quot;mint&quot; (coin), &quot;noon&quot;, &quot;pillow&quot;, &quot;pound&quot; (unit of weight), &quot;punt&quot; (boat), &quot;sack&quot;, &quot;street&quot;, &quot;wall&quot;, &quot;wine&quot;.

Christian missionaries coming to Britain in the 6th or and 7th century brought with them Latin religious terms. Some of these words are ultimately of Greek origin, as much of the technical language of Christianity developed from the Greek of the New Testament and the works of those fathers of the Church who wrote in Greek.

During this time, Catholic monks mainly wrote or copied text in Latin, the prevalent medieval lingua franca in Europe. When monks occasionally wrote in the vernacular, Latin words were translated by finding suitable Old English equivalents. Often, a Germanic word was adopted and given a new shade of meaning in the process. Such was the case with Old English &quot;gōdspell&quot; (&quot;gospel&quot;) for Latin &quot;Evangelium&quot;. Previously, the Old English word simply meant &quot;good news&quot;, but its meaning was extended in Old English to fit a religious context. The same occurred for the Old Germanic pagan word &quot;blētsian&quot;, which meant &quot;to sacrifice, consecrate by shedding blood&quot;. It was adapted by Old English scribes and Christianized to become the word &quot;bless&quot;. Similarly &quot;fullwiht&quot; 
(literally, &quot;full-being&quot;) and the verb &quot;fullian&quot; came to mean &quot;baptism&quot; and &quot;to baptise&quot; respectively, but probably originally referred to some kind of rite of passage.

Whenever a suitable Old English substitute could not be found, a Latin word could be chosen instead, and many Latin words entered the Old English lexicon in this way. Such words include: &quot;biscop&quot; &quot;bishop&quot; from Latin &quot;episcopus&quot;, Old English &quot;tepid&quot; &quot;carpet&quot; from Latin &quot;tapetum&quot;, and Old English &quot;sigel&quot; &quot;brooch&quot; from Latin &quot;sigillum&quot;, &quot;culcer&quot; and &quot;læfel&quot; &quot;spoon&quot; from Latin &quot;coclearium&quot; and &quot;labellum&quot; beside Old English &quot;spōn&quot; and &quot;hlædel&quot; (Modern English &quot;ladle&quot;); Old English &quot;forca&quot; from Latin &quot;furca&quot; &quot;fork&quot; next to Old English &quot;gafol&quot;; Old English &quot;scamol&quot; &quot;chair, stool&quot; from Latin &quot;scamellum&quot; beside native &quot;stōl&quot;, &quot;benc&quot; and &quot;setl&quot;. All told, approximately 600 words were borrowed from Latin during the Old English period. Often, the Latin word was tightly restricted in sense, and was not widely used by the general populace. Latin words tended to be literary or scholarly terms and were not very common. The majority of them did not survive into the Middle English Period.

==Middle Ages==
The Norman Conquest of 1066 gave England a two-tiered society with an aristocracy which spoke Anglo-Norman and a lower class which spoke English. From 1066 until Henry IV of England ascended the throne in 1399, the royal court of England spoke a Norman language that became progressively Gallicised through contact with Old French. The Norman rulers did not try to suppress the English language, apart from not using it at all in their courts. In 1204, the Anglo-Normans lost their continental territories in Normandy and became wholly English. By the time Middle English arose as the dominant language in the late 14th century, the Normans had contributed roughly ten thousand words to English, three-quarters of which survive. Continued use of Latin by the Church and centres of learning brought a steady, though dramatically reduced, influx of new Latin lexical borrowings.

Since subjects like science and philosophy, including rhetoric and ethics, were communicated in Latin, the Latin vocabulary that developed for them became the source of a great many technical and abstract words. English words like &quot;abstract&quot;, &quot;subject&quot;, &quot;communicate&quot;, &quot;matter&quot;, &quot;probable&quot; and their cognates in other European languages generally have the meanings given to them in late Medieval Latin, and often terms for abstract concepts not available in English. Translated works that contributed significantly included Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Boece&quot; and Trevisa&#x27;s translation of Bartholomaeus Anglicus&#x27;s &quot;De proprietatibus rerum&quot;.

==Renaissance==

During the English Renaissance, from around 1500–1650, some 10,000 to 12,000 words entered the English lexicon, including the word &quot;lexicon&quot;. Some examples include &quot;aberration&quot;, &quot;allusion&quot;, &quot;anachronism&quot;, &quot;democratic&quot;, &quot;dexterity&quot;, &quot;enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;imaginary&quot;, &quot;juvenile&quot;, &quot;pernicious&quot;, &quot;sophisticated&quot;. Many of these words were borrowed directly from Latin, both in its classical and medieval forms. In turn, Late Latin also included borrowings from Greek.

==Industrial Age==

The dawn of the age of scientific discovery in the 17th and 18th centuries created the need for new words to describe newfound knowledge. Many words were borrowed from Latin, while others were coined from Latin roots, prefixes, and suffixes, and Latin word elements freely combine with elements from all other languages including native Anglo-Saxon words. Some of the words which entered English at this time are: apparatus, aqueous, carnivorous, component, corpuscle, data, experiment, formula, incubate, machinery, mechanics, molecule, nucleus, organic, ratio, structure, vertebra.

==Consequences for English==
In addition to a large number of historical borrowings and coinages, today Latinate words continue to be coined in English – see classical compounds – particularly in technical contexts. A number of more subtle consequences include: numerous doublets – two or more cognate terms from both a Germanic and Latinate source (or Latinate sources), such as cow/beef; numerous cases of etymologically unrelated terms for closely related concepts, notably Germanic nouns with a Latin adjective, such as bird/avian or hand/manual; complicated etymologies due to indirect borrowings (via Romance) or multiple borrowings; and usage controversies over the perceived complexity of Latinate terms.

===Noun/adjective doublets===
As with Germanic/Latinate doublets from the Norman period, the use of Latinate words in the sciences has created pairs with a native Germanic noun and a Latinate adjective:
*animals: ant/formic, bee/apian, bird/avian, crow/corvine, cod/gadoid, carp/cyprine, fish/piscine, gull/larine, wasp/vespine, butterfly/papilionaceous, worm/vermian, spider/arachnid, snake/anguine (or serpentine), tortoise (or turtle)/testudinal, cat/feline, lion/leonine, rabbit/cunicular, hare/leporine, dog/canine, deer/cervine, reindeer/rangiferine, fox/vulpine, wolf/lupine, goat/caprine, sheep/ovine, swan/cygnean, duck/anatine, starling/sturnine, goose/anserine, dove/columbine, ostrich/struthious, horse/equine, chicken/gallinaceous, ox/bovine, pig/porcine, whale/cetacean, ape/simian, bear/ursine, human/hominine (&quot;gender specific&quot;: man/masculine, woman/feminine); these Germanic nouns can be made into adjectives by adding &quot;-like&quot;.
*physiology: head/capital, body/corporal, ear/aural, eye/ocular or visual, nose/nasal, mouth/oral, tooth/dental, tongue/lingual, lips/labial, neck/cervical, shoulder/scapular, finger/digital, hand/manual, arm/brachial, foot/pedal, sole of the foot/plantar, leg/crural, thigh/femoral, chest/pectoral, nipple/papillary, brain/cerebral, mind/mental, nail/ungual, hair/pilar, lung/pulmonary, kidney/renal, blood/sanguine, heart/cardiac.
*astronomy: moon/lunar, sun/solar, earth/terrestrial, star/stellar.
*sociology: son or daughter/filial, mother/maternal, father/paternal, brother/fraternal, sister/sororal, wife/uxorial, uncle/avuncular.
*other: book/literary, edge/marginal, fire/igneous, water/aquatic, sea/marine, wind/vental, ice/glacial, boat (or ship)/naval, house/domestic, door/portal, window/fenestral, wall/mural, bridge/pontine, town/urban, sight/visual, ring/annular, tree/arboreal, bloom/floral, marsh/paludal, land (country)/national, sword/gladiate, king/regal, earl/comital, fighter/military, law/legal, church/ecclesiastical, bell/tintinnabulary, cooking/culinary, clothes/sartorial.

Thus Latin constitutes a linguistic superstratum for English just as Japanese has a Chinese superstratum and Hindustani has a Persian superstratum.

===Indirect influence===
It is not always easy to tell at what point a word entered English, or in what form. Some words have come into English from Latin more than once, through French or another Romance language at one time and directly from Latin at another. Thus there are pairs like fragile/frail, army/armada, corona/crown, ratio/reason, and rotund/round. The first word in each pair came directly from Latin, while the second entered English from French (or Spanish, in the case of &quot;armada&quot;). In addition, some words have entered English twice from French, with the result that they have the same source, but different pronunciations reflecting changing pronunciation in French, for example, chief/chef (the former a Middle English borrowing and the latter modern). Multiple borrowings explain other word pairs and groups with similar roots but different meanings and/or pronunciations: canal/channel, poor/pauper, coy/quiet, disc/disk/dish/desk/dais/discus.

===Sociolinguistical consequences===
David Corson in The Lexical Bar (1985) defended the thesis that the large portion of Greco-Latinate words in Academic English explains the difficulties of working class children in the educational system. When exposed at home mainly to colloquial English (primarily Anglo-Saxon words), children may have more difficulty at school than their peers who have more access at home to academic words (often longer, more Greco-Latinate). This difference tends not to become less by education but greater, potentially impeding their access to academic or social careers. In various experiments and comparative studies Corson measured fewer differences between 12 year olds than 15 year olds due to their unfamiliarity with Greco-Latinate words in English and the way teachers deal with them.
Corson&#x27;s views were not always represented correctly. In his totally revised Using English Words (1995) the linguistic, historical, psychological and educational aspects have been integrated better.

<text>Strength training, also known as weight training or resistance training, is exercise designed to improve physical strength. It is often associated with the lifting of weights. It can also incorporate techniques such as bodyweight exercises, isometrics, and plyometrics.

Training works by progressively increasing the force output of the muscles and uses a variety of exercises and types of equipment. Strength training is primarily an anaerobic activity, although circuit training also is a form of aerobic exercise.

Strength training can increase muscle, tendon, and ligament strength as well as bone density, metabolism, and the lactate threshold; improve joint and cardiac function; and reduce the risk of injury in athletes and the elderly. For many sports and physical activities, strength training is central or is used as part of their training regimen.
== Principles and training methods ==

Strength training follows the fundamental principle that involves repeatedly overloading a muscle group. This is typically done by contracting the muscles against heavy resistance and then returning to the starting position. This process is repeated for several repetitions until the muscles reach the point of failure. The basic method of resistance training uses the principle of progressive overload, in which the muscles are overloaded by working against as high resistance as they are capable of. They respond by growing larger and stronger. 
Beginning strength-trainers are in the process of training the neurological aspects of strength, the ability of the brain to generate a rate of neuronal action potentials that will produce a muscular contraction that is close to the maximum of the muscle&#x27;s potential.

=== Proper form ===

Strength training also requires the use of proper or &#x27;good form&#x27;, performing the movements with the appropriate muscle group, and not transferring the weight to different body parts in order to move greater weight (called &#x27;cheating&#x27;). An injury or an inability to reach training objectives might arise from poor form during a training set. If the desired muscle group is not challenged sufficiently, the threshold of overload is never reached and the muscle does not gain in strength. At a particularly advanced level, however, &quot;cheating&quot; can be used to break through strength plateaus and encourage neurological and muscular adaptation.

Maintaining proper form is one of the many steps in order to perfectly perform a certain technique. Correct form in weight training improves strength, muscle tone, and maintaining a healthy weight. Improper form can lead to strains and fractures.

===Stretching and warm-up===

Weight trainers often spend time warming up before starting a workout, a practice strongly recommended by the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA). A warm-up may include cardiovascular activity such as light stationary biking (a &quot;pulse raiser&quot;), flexibility and joint mobility exercises, static and/or dynamic stretching, &quot;passive warm up&quot; such as applying heat pads or taking a hot shower, and workout-specific warm-up, such as rehearsal of the intended exercise with no weights or light weights. The intended purpose of warming up is to enhance exercise effectiveness and reduce the risk of injury.

Evidence is limited regarding whether warming up reduces injuries during strength training. As of 2015, no articles existed on the effects of warm-up for upper body injury prevention. For the lower limbs, several programs significantly reduce injuries in sports and military training, but no universal injury prevention program has emerged, and it is unclear if warm-ups designed for these areas will also be applicable to strength training. Static stretching can increase the risk of injury due to its analgesic effect and cellular damage caused by it.

The effects of warming up on exercise effectiveness are clearer. For 1RM trials, an exercise rehearsal has significant benefits. For submaximal strength training (3 sets of 80% of 1RM to failure), exercise rehearsal does not provide any benefits regarding fatigue or total repetitions for exercises such as bench press, squats, and arm curl, compared to no warm-up. Dynamic warm-ups (performed with greater than 20% of maximal effort) enhance strength and power in upper-body exercises. When properly warmed up the lifter will have more strength and stamina since the blood has begun to flow to the muscle groups. Pulse raisers do not have any effect on either 1RM or submaximal training. Static stretching induces strength loss, and should therefore probably not be performed before strength training. Resistance training functions as an active form of flexibility training, with similar increases in range of motion when compared to performing a static stretching protocol. Static stretching, performed either before or after exercise, also does not reduce muscle soreness in healthy adults.

===Breathing===
Like numerous forms of exercise, weight training has the potential to cause the breathing pattern to deepen. This helps to meet increased oxygen requirements. One approach to breathing during weight training consists of avoiding holding one&#x27;s breath and breathing shallowly. The benefits of this include protecting against a lack of oxygen, passing out, and increased blood pressure. The general procedure of this method is to inhale when lowering the weight (the eccentric portion) and exhale when lifting the weight (the concentric portion). However, the reverse, inhaling when lifting and exhaling when lowering, may also be recommended. There is little difference between the two techniques in terms of their influence on heart rate and blood pressure.

On the other hand, for people working with extremely heavy loads (such as powerlifters), breathing à la the Valsalva maneuver is often used. This involves deeply inhaling and then bracing down with the abdominal and lower back muscles as the air is held in during the entire rep. Air is then expelled once the rep is done, or after a number of reps is done. The Valsalva maneuver leads to an increase in intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure. This enhances the structural integrity of the torso—protecting against excessive spinal flexion or extension and providing a secure base to lift heavy weights effectively and securely. However, as the Valsalva maneuver increases blood pressure, lowers heart rate, and restricts breathing, it can be a dangerous method for those with hypertension or for those who faint easily.

=== Training volume ===
Training volume is commonly defined as sets × reps × load. That is, an individual moves a certain load for some number of repetitions, rests, and repeats this for some number of sets, and the volume is the product of these numbers. For non-weightlifting exercises, the load may be replaced with &quot;intensity&quot;, the amount of work required to achieve the activity. Training volume is one of the most critical variables in the effectiveness of strength training. There is a positive relationship between volume and hypertrophy.

The load or intensity is often normalized as the percentage of an individual&#x27;s one-repetition maximum (1RM). Due to muscle failure, the intensity limits the maximum number of repetitions that can be carried out in one set, and is correlated with the repetition ranges chosen. Depending on the goal, different loads and repetition amounts may be appropriate:

* Strength development (1RM performance): Gains may be achieved with a variety of loads. However, training efficiency is maximized by using heavy loads (80% to 100% of 1RM). The number of repetitions is secondary and may be 1 to 5 repetitions per set.
* Muscle growth (hypertrophy): Hypertrophy can be maximized by taking sets to failure or close to failure. Any load 30% of 1RM or greater may be used. The NCSA recommends &quot;medium&quot; loads of 8 to 12 repetitions per set with 60% to 80% of 1RM.
* Endurance: Endurance may be trained by performing many repetitions, such as 15 or more per set. The NCSA recommends &quot;light&quot; loads below 60% of 1RM, but some studies have found conflicting results suggesting that &quot;moderate&quot; 15-20RM loads may work better when performed to failure.

Training to muscle failure is not necessary for increasing muscle strength and muscle mass, but it also is not harmful.

=== Movement tempo ===

The speed or pace at which each repetition is performed is also an important factor in strength and muscle gain. The emerging format for expressing this is as a 4-number tempo code such as 3/1/4/2, meaning an eccentric phase lasting 3 seconds, a pause of 1 second, a concentric phase of 4 seconds, and another pause of 2 seconds. The letter X in a tempo code represents a voluntary explosive action whereby the actual velocity and duration is not controlled and may be involuntarily extended as fatigue manifests, while the letter V implies volitional freedom &quot;at your own pace&quot;. A phase&#x27;s tempo may also be measured as the average movement velocity. Less precise but commonly used characterizations of tempo include the total time for the repetition or a qualitative characterization such as fast, moderate, or slow. The ACSM recommends a moderate or slower tempo of movement for novice- and intermediate-trained individuals, but a combination of slow, moderate, and fast tempos for advanced training.

Intentionally slowing down the movement tempo of each repetition can increase muscle activation for a given number of repetitions. However, the maximum number of repetitions and the maximum possible load for a given number of repetitions decreases as the tempo is slowed. Some trainers calculate training volume using the time under tension (TUT), namely the time of each rep times the number of reps, rather than simply the number of reps. However, hypertrophy is similar for a fixed number of repetitions and each repetition&#x27;s duration varying from 0.5 s - 8 s. There is however a marked decrease in hypertrophy for &quot;very slow&quot; durations greater than 10 s. There are similar hypertrophic effects for 50-60% 1RM loads with a slower 3/0/3/0 tempo and 80-90% 1RM loads with a faster 1/1/1/0 tempo. It may be beneficial for both hypertrophy and strength to use fast, short concentric phases and slower, longer eccentric phases. Research has not yet isolated the effects of concentric and eccentric durations, or tested a wide variety of exercises and populations.

===Weekly frequency===

In general, more weekly training sessions lead to higher increases in physical strength. However, when training volume was equalized, training frequency had no influence on muscular strength. In addition, greater frequency had no significant effect on single-joint exercises. There may be a fatigue recovery effect in which spreading the same amount of training over multiple days boosts gains, but this has to be confirmed by future studies.

For muscle growth, a training frequency of two sessions per week had greater effects than once per week. Whether training a muscle group three times per week is superior to a twice-per-week protocol remains to be determined.

===Rest period===
The rest period is defined as the time dedicated to recovery between sets and exercises. Exercise causes metabolic stress, such as the buildup of lactic acid and the depletion of adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine. Resting 3–5 minutes between sets allows for significantly greater repetitions in the next set versus resting 1–2 minutes.

For untrained individuals (no previous resistance training experience), the effect of resting on muscular strength development is small and other factors such as volitional fatigue and discomfort, cardiac stress, and the time available for training may be more important. Moderate rest intervals (60-160s) are better than short (20-40 s), but long rest intervals (3–4 minutes) have no significant difference from moderate.

For trained individuals, rest of 3–5 minutes is sufficient to maximize strength gain, compared to shorter intervals 20s-60s and longer intervals of 5 minutes. Intervals of greater than 5 minutes have not been studied. Starting at 2 minutes and progressively decreasing the rest interval over the course of a few weeks to 30s can produce similar strength gains to a constant 2 minutes.

Regarding older individuals, a 1-minute rest is sufficient in females.

===Order===
The largest increases in strength happen for the exercises in the beginning of a session.

Supersets are defined as a pair of different exercise sets performed without rest, followed by a normal rest period. Common superset configurations are two exercises for the same muscle group, agonist-antagonist muscles, or alternating upper and lower body muscle groups. Exercises for the same muscle group (flat bench press followed by the incline bench press) result in a significantly lower training volume than a traditional exercise format with rests. However, agonist–antagonist supersets result in a significantly higher training volume when compared to a traditional exercise format. Similarly, holding training volume constant but performing upper–lower body supersets and tri-sets reduce elapsed time but increased perceived exertion rate. These results suggest that specific exercise orders may allow more intense, more time-efficient workouts with results similar to longer workouts.

===Periodization===

Periodization refers to the organization of training into sequential phases and cyclical periods, and the change in training over time. The simplest strength training periodization involves keeping a fixed schedule of sets and reps (e.g. 2 sets of 12 reps of bicep curls every 2 days), and steadily increasing the intensity on a weekly basis. This is conceptually a parallel model, as several exercises are done each day and thus multiple muscles are developed simultaneously. It is also sometimes called &quot;linear&quot; periodization, but this designation is considered a misnomer.

Sequential or block periodization concentrates training into periods (&quot;blocks&quot;). For example, for athletes, performance can be optimized for specific events based on the competition schedule. An annual training plan may be divided hierarchically into several levels, from training phases down to individual sessions. Traditional periodization can be viewed as repeating one weekly block over and over. Block periodization has the advantage of focusing on specific motor abilities and muscle groups. Because only a few abilities are worked on at a time, the effects of fatigue are minimized. With careful goal selection and ordering, there may be synergistic effects. A traditional block consists of high-volume, low-intensity exercises, transitioning to low-volume, high-intensity exercises. However, to maximize progress to specific goals, individual programs may require different manipulations, such as decreasing the intensity and increasing volume.

Undulating periodization is an extension of block periodization to frequent changes in volume and intensity, usually daily or weekly. Because of the rapid changes, it is theorized that there will be more stress on the neuromuscular system and better training effects. Undulating periodization yields better strength improvements on 1RM than non-periodized training. For hypertrophy, it appears that daily undulating periodization has similar effect to more traditional models.

=== Training splits ===

A training split refers to how the trainee divides and schedules their training volume, or in other words which muscles are trained on a given day over a period of time (usually a week). Popular training splits include full body, upper/lower, push/pull/legs, and the &quot;bro&quot; split. Some training programs may alternate splits weekly.

=== Exercise selection ===

Exercise selection depends on the goals of the strength training program. If a specific sport or activity is targeted, the focus will be on specific muscle groups used in that sport. Various exercises may target improvements in strength, speed, agility, or endurance. For other populations such as older individuals, there is little information to guide exercise selection, but exercises can be selected on the basis of specific functional capabilities as well as the safety and efficiency of the exercises.

For strength and power training in able-bodied individuals, the NCSA recommends emphasizing integrated or compound movements (multi-joint exercises), such as with free weights, over exercises isolating a muscle (single-joint exercises), such as with machines. This is due to the fact that only the compound movements improve gross motor coordination and proprioceptive stabilizing mechanisms. However, single-joint exercises can result in greater muscle growth in the targeted muscles, and are more suitable for injury prevention and rehabilitation. Low variation in exercise selection or targeted muscle groups, combined with a high volume of training, is likely to lead to overtraining and training maladaptation. Many exercises such as the squat have several variations. Some studies have analyzed the differing muscle activation patterns, which can aid in exercise selection.

===Equipment===
Commonly used equipment for resistance training include free weights—including dumbbells, barbells, and kettlebells—weight machines, and resistance bands.

Resistance can also be generated by inertia in flywheel training instead of by gravity from weights, facilitating variable resistance throughout the range of motion and eccentric overload.

Some bodyweight exercises do not require any equipment, and others may be performed with equipment such as suspension trainers or pull-up bars.

===Types of strength training exercises===
*Isometric exercise
*Isotonic exercise
*Isokinetic exercise

== Aerobic exercise versus anaerobic exercise ==

Strength training exercise is primarily anaerobic. Even while training at a lower intensity (training loads of ≈20-RM), anaerobic glycolysis is still the major source of power, although aerobic metabolism makes a small contribution. Weight training is commonly perceived as anaerobic exercise, because one of the more common goals is to increase strength by lifting heavy weights. Other goals such as rehabilitation, weight loss, body shaping, and bodybuilding often use lower weights, adding aerobic character to the exercise.

Except in the extremes, a muscle will fire fibres of both the aerobic or anaerobic types on any given exercise, in varying ratio depending on the load on the intensity of the contraction. This is known as the energy system continuum. At higher loads, the muscle will recruit all muscle fibres possible, both anaerobic (&quot;fast-twitch&quot;) and aerobic (&quot;slow-twitch&quot;), to generate the most force. However, at maximum load, the anaerobic processes contract so forcefully that the aerobic fibers are completely shut out, and all work is done by the anaerobic processes. Because the anaerobic muscle fibre uses its fuel faster than the blood and intracellular restorative cycles can resupply it, the maximum number of repetitions is limited. In the aerobic regime, the blood and intracellular processes can maintain a supply of fuel and oxygen, and continual repetition of the motion will not cause the muscle to fail.

Circuit weight training is a form of exercise that uses a number of weight training exercise sets separated by short intervals. The cardiovascular effort to recover from each set serves a function similar to an aerobic exercise, but this is not the same as saying that a weight training set is itself an aerobic process.

Strength training is typically associated with the production of lactate, which is a limiting factor of exercise performance. Regular endurance exercise leads to adaptations in skeletal muscle which can prevent lactate levels from rising during strength training. This is mediated via activation of PGC-1alpha which alter the LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) isoenzyme complex composition and decreases the activity of the lactate generating enzyme LDHA, while increasing the activity of the lactate metabolizing enzyme LDHB.

== Nutrition and supplementation ==
Supplementation of protein in the diet of healthy adults increases the size and strength of muscles during prolonged resistance exercise training (RET); protein intakes of greater than 1.62 grams per kilogram of body weight a day did not additionally increase fat–free mass (FFM), muscle size, or strength, with the caveat that &quot;Increasing age reduces… the efficacy of protein supplementation during RET.&quot;

It is not known how much carbohydrate is necessary to maximize muscle hypertrophy. Strength adaptations may not be hindered by a low-carbohydrate diet.

A light, balanced meal prior to the workout (usually one to two hours beforehand) ensures that adequate energy and amino acids are available for the intense bout of exercise. The type of nutrients consumed affects the response of the body, and nutrient timing whereby protein and carbohydrates are consumed prior to and after workout has a beneficial impact on muscle growth. Water is consumed throughout the course of the workout to prevent poor performance due to dehydration. A protein shake is often consumed immediately following the workout. However, the anabolic window is not particularly narrow and protein can also be consumed before or hours after the exercise with similar effects. Glucose (or another simple sugar) is often consumed as well since this quickly replenishes any glycogen lost during the exercise period.
If consuming recovery drink after a workout, to maximize muscle protein anabolism, it is suggested that the recovery drink contain glucose (dextrose), protein (usually whey) hydrolysate containing mainly dipeptides and tripeptides, and leucine.

Some weight trainers also take ergogenic aids such as creatine or anabolic steroids to aid muscle growth. In a meta-analysis study that investigated the effects of creatine supplementation on repeated sprint ability, it was discovered that creatine increased body mass and mean power output. The creatine-induced increase in body mass was a result of fluid retention. The increase in mean power output was attributed to creatine&#x27;s ability to counteract the lack of intramuscular phosphocreatine. Creatine does not have an effect on fatigue or maximum power output.

===Hydration===
As with other sports, weight trainers should avoid dehydration throughout the workout by drinking sufficient water. This is particularly true in hot environments, or for those older than 65.

Some athletic trainers advise athletes to drink about every 15 minutes while exercising, and about throughout the day.

However, a much more accurate determination of how much fluid is necessary can be made by performing appropriate weight measurements before and after a typical exercise session, to determine how much fluid is lost during the workout. The greatest source of fluid loss during exercise is through perspiration, but as long as fluid intake is roughly equivalent to the rate of perspiration, hydration levels will be maintained.

Under most circumstances, sports drinks do not offer a physiological benefit over water during weight training.

Insufficient hydration may cause lethargy, soreness or muscle cramps. The urine of well-hydrated persons should be nearly colorless, while an intense yellow color is normally a sign of insufficient hydration.

== Effects ==
The effects of strength training include greater muscular strength, improved muscle tone and appearance, increased endurance, cardiovascular health, and enhanced bone density.

===Bones, joints, frailty, posture and in people at risk===
Strength training also provides functional benefits. Stronger muscles improve posture, provide better support for joints, and reduce the risk of injury from everyday activities.

Progressive resistance training may improve function, quality of life and reduce pain in people at risk of fracture, with rare adverse effects. Weight-bearing exercise also helps to prevent osteoporosis and to improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis. For many people in rehabilitation or with an acquired disability, such as following stroke or orthopaedic surgery, strength training for weak muscles is a key factor to optimise recovery. Consistent exercise can actually strengthen bones and prevent them from getting frail with age.

===Mortality, longevity, muscle and body composition===
Strength training appears to be associated with a &quot;10–17% lower risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), total cancer, diabetes and lung cancer&quot;. Two key outcomes of strength training are muscle hypertrophy and muscular strength gain which are associated with reduced all-cause mortality.

Strength training causes endocrine responses that could have positive effects. It also reduces blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and alters body composition, reducing body fat percentage, body fat mass and visceral fat, which is usually beneficial as obesity predisposes towards several chronic diseases and e.g. body fat distribution is one predictor of insulin resistance and related complications.

===Neurobiological effects===
Strength training also leads to various beneficial neurobiological effects – likely including functional brain changes, lower white matter atrophy, neuroplasticity (including some degree of BDNF expression), and white matter-related structural and functional changes in neuroanatomy. Although resistance training has been less studied for its effect on depression than aerobic exercise, it has shown benefits compared to no intervention.

===Lipid and inflammatory outcomes===
Moreover, it also promotes decreases in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and adiponectin concentrations.

=== Sports performance ===
Stronger muscles improve performance in a variety of sports. Sport-specific training routines are used by many competitors. These often specify that the speed of muscle contraction during weight training should be the same as that of the particular sport. Strength training can substantially prevent sports injuries, increase jump height and improve change of direction.

=== Neuromuscular Adaptations ===
Strength training is not only associated with an increase in muscle mass, but also an improvement in the nervous system&#x27;s ability to recruit muscle fibers and activate them at a faster rate. Neural adaptations can occur in the motor cortex, the spinal cord, and/or neuromuscular junctions. The initial significant improvements in strength amongst new lifters are a result of increased neural drive, motor unit synchronization, motor unit excitability, rate of force development, muscle fiber conduction velocity, and motor unit discharge rate. Together, these improvements provide an increase in strength separate from muscle hypertrophy. Typically, the main barbell lifts (squat, bench, and deadlift) are performed with a full range of motion, which provides the greatest neuromuscular improvements compared to one-third or two-thirds range of motion. However, there are reasons to perform these lifts with less range of motion, particularly in the powerlifting community. By limiting range of motion, lifters can target a specific joint angle in order to improve their sticking points by training their neural drive. Neuromuscular adaptations are critical for the development of strength, but are especially important in the aging adult population, as the decline in neuromuscular function is roughly three times as great (≈3% per year) as the loss of muscle mass (≈1% per year). By staying active and following a resistance training program, older adults can maintain their movement, stability, balance, and independence.

== History ==

The genealogy of lifting can be traced back to the beginning of recorded history where humanity&#x27;s fascination with physical abilities can be found among numerous ancient writings. In many prehistoric tribes, they would have a big rock they would try to lift, and the first one to lift it would inscribe their name into the stone. Such rocks have been found in Greek and Scottish castles. Progressive resistance training dates back at least to Ancient Greece, when legend has it that wrestler Milo of Croton trained by carrying a newborn calf on his back every day until it was fully grown. Another Greek, the physician Galen, described strength training exercises using the halteres (an early form of dumbbell) in the 2nd century.

Ancient Greek sculptures also depict lifting feats. The weights were generally stones, but later gave way to dumbbells. The dumbbell was joined by the barbell in the later half of the 19th century. Early barbells had hollow globes that could be filled with sand or lead shot, but by the end of the century these were replaced by the plate-loading barbell commonly used today.

Weightlifting was first introduced in the Olympics in the 1896 Athens Olympic Games as a part of track and field, and was officially recognized as its own event in 1914.

The 1960s saw the gradual introduction of exercise machines into the still-rare strength training gyms of the time. Weight training became increasingly popular in the 1970s, following the release of the bodybuilding movie &quot;Pumping Iron,&quot; and the subsequent popularity of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Since the late 1990s, increasing numbers of women have taken up weight training; currently, nearly one in five U.S. women engage in weight training on a regular basis.

== Subpopulations ==
===Sex differences ===
Men and women have similar reactions to resistance training with comparable effect sizes for hypertrophy and lower body strength, although some studies have found that women experience a greater relative increase in upper-body strength. Because of their greater starting strength and muscle mass, absolute gains are higher in men. In older adults, women experienced a larger increase in lower-body strength.

=== Safety concerns and Training related to children ===
Orthopaedic specialists used to recommend that children avoid weight training because the growth plates on their bones might be at risk. The very rare reports of growth plate fractures in children who trained with weights occurred as a result of inadequate supervision, improper form or excess weight, and there have been no reports of injuries to growth plates in youth training programs that followed established guidelines. The position of the National Strength and Conditioning Association is that strength training is safe for children if properly designed and supervised. The effects of training on youth have been shown to depend on the methods of training being implemented. Studies from the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research concluded that both Resistance Training and Plyometric training led to significant improvements in peak torque, peak rate of torque development, and jump performance, with Plyometric showing a greater improvement in jump performance compared to Resistance training. Another study saw results that suggest that both high-load, low-repetition and moderate-load, high-repetition resistance training can be prescribed to improve muscular fitness in untrained adolescents, as well as the jump height had also increased. These finding can be used in the future to develop training programs for youth athletes. The big takeaway from these studies is that not only in training important for the development of strength for young athletes, but also it shows that when developing a program, having both plyometrics exercise and resistance training will result in better adaptations in the short and long term. This can be attributed to the effect of neuromuscular development and the principle that it comes faster for adolescents than muscular hypertrophy. Understanding this is crucial for those in charge of creating programs for the youth to avoid injury and/or overtraining. Since adolescents are still in growing and are not done with developing not only musculature but also bone and joint structures. Younger children are at greater risk of injury than adults if they drop a weight on themselves or perform an exercise incorrectly; further, they may lack understanding of, or ignore the safety precautions around weight training equipment. As a result, supervision of minors is considered vital to ensuring the safety of any youth engaging in strength training.

=== Older adults ===
Aging is associated with sarcopenia, a decrease in muscle mass and strength. Resistance training can mitigate this effect, and even the oldest old (those above age 85) can increase their muscle mass with a resistance training program, although to a lesser degree than younger individuals. With more strength older adults have better health, better quality of life, better physical function and fewer falls. Resistance training can improve physical functioning in older people, including the performance of activities of daily living. Resistance training programs are safe for older adults, can be adapted for mobility and disability limitations, and may be used in assisted living settings. Resistance training at lower intensities such as 45% of 1RM can still result in increased muscular strength.

<text>The third USS &quot;Preble&quot; was a in commission in the United States Navy from 1903 to 1919. She was named for Commodore Edward Preble. She saw service in World War I.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Preble&quot; was laid down by the Union Iron Works at San Francisco, California, on 21 April 1899. She was launched on 2 March 1901, sponsored by Miss Ethel Preble, and commissioned on 14 December 1903.

==Service history==
===1903–1917===
&quot;Preble&quot; was assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet and operated with the 4th and 2nd Torpedo Flotillas off the west coast of North America from Washington to the Panama Canal Zone until 1908, making a cruise to Hawaii and American Samoa from 24 August to November 1908. On returning, she operated along the United States West Coast until 4 February 1909, when she arrived at Mare Island Navy Yard on Mare Island in Vallejo, California, for inactivation. She was in reserve on 23 February 1909.

Reactivated on 17 September 1909, &quot;Preble&quot; was reassigned to the Pacific Torpedo Flotilla and operated with it until 1913. Placed in reserve again on 19 June 1913, she remained at Mare Island until resuming operations with the torpedo flotilla on 23 April 1914. She observed the Mexican Revolution′s Topolobampo Campaign between Mexican Huertista and Constitutionalist forces in the Gulf of California and was present at the Fourth Battle of Topolobampo, the final naval action of the campaign.

Torpedo practice, gunnery exercises, and minesweeping operations followed. During the summer of 1915, &quot;Preble&quot; participated in a cruise to Alaskan waters to gather logistic information. She began another period in reserve on 25 October 1916.

===World War I===
With entry of the United States into World War I looming, &quot;Preble&quot; was reactivated on 3 April 1917. On 6 April, the United States entered the war.

&quot;Preble&quot; departed San Diego, California, on 30 April 1917 for the United States East Coast. She arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 July 1917 and began coastwise convoy duty in the Atlantic Ocean along the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States.

&quot;Preble&quot; was involved in a friendly fire incident in July 1918. She was one of the escorts of a convoy of five troop transports carrying U.S. troops to Europe which departed New York City on 21 July. In the predawn hours of 23 July, the U.S. Navy submarine was on the surface in the Atlantic Ocean, charging her batteries in calm, hazy weather with bright moonlight, when she suddenly sighted one of the ships of the convoy at 02:55 at a range of only . The British armed transport , carrying 3,800 U.S. troops, soon also appeared, headed straight at &quot;N-3&quot; and only about away. &quot;N-3&quot; immediately made a preliminary recognition signal by firing a green flare, then sent a recognition signal by blinker light. &quot;Minnekahda&quot; did not respond except to blow her steam whistle. &quot;N-3&quot;′s crew heard someone aboard &quot;Minnekahda&quot; order &quot;Fire!&quot; As &quot;N-3&quot; continued to flash the recognition signal by blinker light, &quot;N-3&quot;′s commanding officer hailed &quot;Minnekahda&quot;, calling out &quot;Don&#x27;t fire, this is an American submarine!&quot; At that instant, one of &quot;Minnekahda&quot;′s guns fired a or round (according to different sources), and the shell hit &quot;N-3&quot; forward at the waterline, failing to explode but inflicting considerable damage and causing leaks. &quot;Minnekahda&quot; closed to a range of , close enough for &quot;N-3&quot;′s crew to see men aboard &quot;Minnekahda&quot; and hear them receive an order to load. As &quot;N-3&quot; continued to flash the recognition signal, several men on &quot;N3&quot;′s deck yelled &quot;Don&#x27;t fire!&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot, this is the &quot;N-3&quot;!&quot; Finally, someone on &quot;Minnekahda&quot; asked where &quot;N-3&quot;′s flag was. &quot;N-3&quot;′s crew immediately brought a United States flag on deck and shined a light on it. &quot;Minnekahda&quot; promptly ceased fire. &quot;Preble&quot; then approached at flank speed as if to ram &quot;N-3&quot;, and &quot;N-3&quot; made recognition signals and backed at full speed, avoiding a collision with &quot;Preble&quot; by only a few feet. &quot;N-3&quot; hailed &quot;Preble&quot;, which stopped and sent a boat to &quot;N-3&quot; to assess her damage. &quot;N-3&quot; had suffered no crew casualties, but &quot;Minnekahda&quot;′s unexploded shell was found in &quot;N-3&quot;′s forward superstructure, and &quot;N-3&quot;′s torpedo compartment was partially flooded. After pumping of diesel fuel overboard to lighten herself forward, &quot;N-3&quot; proceeded to port on the surface under her own power.

&quot;Preble&quot; continued her convoy escort operations off the Mid-Atlantic coast of the United States through 11 November 1918, when the armistice with Germany brought World War I to a close.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
Remaining on the U.S. East Coast after World War I, &quot;Preble&quot; was decommissioned at New York City on 11 July 1919. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 15 September 1919, and she was sold on 3 January 1920 to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for scrapping.

==Honors and awards==
* Mexican Service Medal
* World War I Victory Medal

&quot;Preble&quot; received the Mexican Service Medal for service from 2 May to 16 August 1914, from 19 to 20 Apr 1916, and from 18 July to 22 August 1916 and the World War I Victory Medal for service from 10 May to 9 November 1918.

==Noteworthy commanding officer==
* Lieutenant (later Commodore) Harry Adrian McClure (3 May 1916–November 1916)

<text>The Hen and Chicken Islands, usually known as the Hen and Chickens, lie to the east of the North Auckland Peninsula off the coast of northern New Zealand. They lie east of Bream Head and south-east of Whangārei with a total area of .

== History ==

Approximately 18,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over lower than present day levels, the islands were hilly features surrounded by a vast coastal plain. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, after which the islands separated from the rest of New Zealand.

These islands were given their European name by Captain James Cook, who first sighted them on 25 November 1769. It has been suggested that the name was inspired by an old name for the star cluster usually known as the Pleiades.

Originally owned by the Māori Ngā Puhi iwi, they were sold to the New Zealand Government in 1883. The islands were made a scenic reserve in 1908 owing to the rarity of their flora and fauna, and became a wildlife refuge in 1953. Hen Island had actually passed from Māori hands a few years earlier, being bought by Thomas Outhwaite in 1872. It was bequeathed to the nation by his daughter Isa Outhwaite in 1927, and it too was named as a scenic reserve.

In June 1940, the Canadian-Australasian ship sank off the islands after hitting a mine. Most of the cargo, which included gold bullion, was later salvaged.

== Environment ==
The islands are noted for their bird life with colonies of seabirds as well as forest birds which have become scarce or extinct on the mainland. The islands have been identified as an Important Bird Area, by BirdLife International because they are home to a breeding population of about 500 pairs of Pycroft&#x27;s petrels. There are also native reptiles on the islands, including tuatara, geckos and skinks.

== The islands ==
Hen Island, or , lies to the southwest from the rest of the archipelago. It is also considerably larger than the Chicken Islands, or , which comprise a chain of six small islands running north-west to south-east to the north of Hen Island. The chain consists of and Islands (together called North West Chicken), (West Chicken), Lady Alice Island or (Big Chicken), (Middle Chicken), and Coppermine Island (Eastern Chicken).

=== Taranga (Hen) Island ===
 is the largest island by some considerable margin, totalling . Long and thin, it has a length of and an average width of less than . A remnant of a four-million-year-old volcano, the island is dominated by a rocky ridge reaching to about at its highest point, called The Pinnacles. Sail Rock, a stack, rises from the ocean to the south of Hen Island, and is a prominent navigational point for yachts.

By the late 1800s, Hen Island was the only place in New Zealand with a surviving population of North Island saddleback. The once common species of forest bird found in the North Island, was nearly wiped out by the human introduction of mammalian predators, such as rats and stoats. In the 1960s translocations of saddleback from Hen Island to other island sanctuaries around New Zealand began.

=== Wareware and Muriwhenua ===
Two small rocky islands with a combined area of .

=== Mauitaha ===
This , rugged, scrub-covered rock lies to the south of Muriwhenua. It rises to . An unofficial name until 1970 was West Chicken Island.

The New Zealand Department of Conservation and the Ngati Wai iwi have entered into partnership to set up a sanctuary for the Polynesian rat, or kiore, on the islands Mauitaha and Araara. A spokesman for Ngati Wai said the kiore heritage will be protected as the movement of the kiore through the Pacific paralleled the migration of the New Zealand Maori. A spokesman for the Department of Conservation said the department&#x27;s policy change from eradication would assist scientific research.

=== Lady Alice Island ===
Named after Lady Alice Fergusson (wife of Governor General Sir Charles Fergusson), it is the largest of the five Chickens and is of particular significance because of its flora and fauna. The island covers and is surrounded by rocky reefs. It was occupied by Māori until the 1820s, and was used as a base for fishermen in the 1890s. Cattle were introduced at about this time, but were removed in the 1920s.

=== Whatupuke ===
Formerly known as &quot;Whakahau&quot; this island is composed of a large eastern section and a peninsula to the southwest. The coast of the peninsula forms one of the chain&#x27;s main land features, a wide bay (Starfish Bay). The island covers , and is steep, rising to .

=== Coppermine Island ===
Coppermine island formerly known as &quot;Mauipane&quot; covers an area of . It is composed of two sections joined by a short isthmus. As the name suggests, there are copper deposits on the island, but attempts at mining them in 1849 and 1898 proved unprofitable.

<doc id="1240366" wikidata="Q1073859" url="?curid=1240366" title="Assyrian flag">
<text>The Assyrian flag ( or ) is the flag widely used to represent the Assyrian nation in the homeland and in the diaspora.

Its two components, the star of Utu/Shamash, which was a symbol for the god Shamash, and is combined with the ancient symbol of the god Ashur.

George Bit Atanus first designed the flag in 1968; the Assyrian Universal Alliance, Assyrian National Federation, Assyrian Democratic Organization and all participant at Assyrian Universal Alliance World Congress adopted the flag in 1971. The flag has a white background with a golden circle at the center, surrounded by a four-pointed star in blue. Four triple-colored (red-white-blue), widening, wavy stripes connect the center to the four corners of the flag. The figure of pre-Christian Assyrian God Ashur, known from Iron Age iconography, features above the center.

==Symbolism==
The golden circle at the center represents the sun, which, by its exploding and leaping flames, generates heat and light to sustain the earth and all its living things. The four-pointed star surrounding the sun symbolizes the land, its light blue color symbolizing tranquility.

The wavy stripes extending from the center to the four corners of the flag represent the three major rivers of the Assyrian homeland: the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the Great Zab. The lines are small at the center and become wider as they spread out from the circle. The dark blue represents the Euphrates. The red stripes, whose blood-red hue stands for courage, glory, and pride, represent the Tigris. The white lines in between the two great rivers symbolize the Great Zab; its white color stands for tranquility and peace. Some interpret the red, white, and blue will gather all the Assyrians back to their homeland to stand strong and fight for what they want and what they have gained.

The star on the flag is the old star symbol associated with Shamash, also known as Utu, the sun deity also associated with the planet Saturn. He was worshipped in the ancient Mesopotamian region. He was apparently the deity who provided leaders like Hammurabi, Ur-Nammu, and Gudea with divine laws.

The archer figure symbolizes the pre-Christian god Ashur.

==Previous flags==
Prior to World War I, Western Assyrians from the Tur Abdin region of Turkey designed an Assyrian flag consisting of a horizontal tricolor with the colors purple, white, and red, with three white stars at the upper hoist. The purple, white, and red bars represented the loyalty, purity, and determination of the Assyrian people, and the three white stars represent the three names or components of the Assyrian nation, Assyrians, Syriacs, and Chaldeans.
This flag was used during delegation meetings with Assyrian politicians and Western powers post World War I. It was also in use by the Assyrian National Federation, later renamed the Assyrian American Federation and the Assyrian American National Federation, from its founding in 1933 until 1975 when they adopted the current Assyrian flag.

During the First World War, the Assyrian volunteers commanded by Agha Petros used a red flag with a white cross. Agha Petros&#x27; personal standard was the flag of the Volunteers but made of silk, with a golden fringe added, and the words &quot;Trust God and follow the Cross&quot; written in Assyrian above the cross.

<doc id="1240374" wikidata="Q7287508" url="?curid=1240374" title="Ralph Friedgen">
<text>Ralph Harry Friedgen (born April 4, 1947) is a former American football coach. He was most recently the special assistant coach for Rutgers in 2015 after serving as their offensive coordinator in the 2014 season. He was the head coach at the University of Maryland, College Park from 2000 to 2010. Friedgen was previously an offensive coordinator at Maryland, Georgia Tech, and in the National Football League (NFL) with the San Diego Chargers.

==Early life and education==
Friedgen was born on April 4, 1947, in Harrison, New York. His father, &quot;Big Ralph&quot; Friedgen, attended Fordham University, where he played from 1938 to 1939, and coached high school football for 30 years. The younger Friedgen worked under his father as a water boy and manager, and the two often attended New York Giants and Jets games together. He attended Harrison High School where he played quarterback on his father&#x27;s team. John Nugent, the head coach of Harrison&#x27;s rival Rye High School, recommended that his brother, Maryland head coach Tom Nugent, recruit Friedgen. His recruitment was handled by Lee Corso, then an assistant coach at the school. After his first season at Maryland, Nugent was fired as head coach, and his successor Lou Saban moved Friedgen to fullback to fill in for an injured teammate. The following year, Maryland had a new coach, and Bob Ward again changed Friedgen&#x27;s position, this time to offensive guard, although he had never blocked before. Upset about the constant turnover at head coach and position changes, Friedgen received a favorable recommendation to transfer from coach Ward, but his father said, &quot;You can transfer, but when you get home, the key you have is not going to fit the door because we&#x27;re changing the lock. Quitters don&#x27;t live here.&quot; He remained at Maryland as a guard and later said the experience taught him a lesson in perseverance. As an undergraduate, he was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity. After completion of his bachelor&#x27;s degree in physical education in 1970, Friedgen served as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, before later accepting positions on the staffs of The Citadel, William and Mary, and Murray State. Joining him on many of these coaching stops was Frank Beamer, who later served as head coach at Virginia Tech.

==Assistant coaching career==
Friedgen returned to the University of Maryland in 1982 to serve as offensive coordinator under head coach Bobby Ross, who was his mentor during his tenure at The Citadel. During this time period, he had a hand in the development of quarterbacks Stan Gelbaugh and Frank Reich, and most notably Boomer Esiason. It was also during this time that the University of Maryland football program was a perennial top-20 team, winning three consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference championships from 1983 to 1985 and appearing in prominent bowl games. Following a sub-par 1986 season, and amidst an athletic department quagmire due in large part to the Len Bias incident, Friedgen followed Ross to Georgia Tech, a period lasting four years. In 1990, Georgia Tech went from being unranked in the preseason to achieving an 11-0-1 record and a share of the national championship with Colorado. In 1992, Friedgen followed Ross again, this time to the NFL&#x27;s San Diego Chargers, where he orchestrated an offense that led the franchise to an appearance in Super Bowl XXIX. In 1997, Friedgen returned to Georgia Tech, where, as offensive coordinator, he developed the balanced offensive attack (200 yards on the ground, 200 yards through the air) that would become his trademark. During his second year, the Yellow Jackets were co-champions of the ACC, defeated Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl, and ended the season ranked among the nation&#x27;s top 10 teams. In 1999, he was the winner and awarded the Frank Broyles Award, given to the nation&#x27;s top assistant coach. Friedgen brought 32 years of assistant coaching experience (including 21 years as an offensive coordinator either in college or the NFL) with him upon his return to College Park.

==Head coaching career==
In November 2000, Friedgen was named the head coach of the University of Maryland football team. He was charged with rebuilding a struggling program that had only one winning season and no bowl game appearances since 1990.

===2001 season===

Friedgen&#x27;s tenure opened against North Carolina, and early in the first quarter, running back Willie Parker ran 77 yards for a touchdown. Maryland came back to win, 23–7, which made Friedgen the first Terrapins coach to win his opener since Tom Nugent in 1959. During the season, Friedgen led Maryland to a surprising 10–2 record, a top 10 national ranking, the first outright Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) title by a team other than Florida State since the Seminoles entered the league in 1992 and the school&#x27;s first conference title since 1985, and an appearance in the 2002 Orange Bowl—the Terrapins&#x27; first major bowl bid in more than two decades. Friedgen received numerous &quot;Coach of the Year&quot; plaudits including the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year, The Home Depot Coach of the Year Award, and the Walter Camp Coach of the Year.

Throughout the year, Friedgen had challenged his players with the phrase &quot;Are you in or are you out?&quot; After the dramatic first-year turnaround, he was a high-profile candidate for an NFL position, and his players repeated his question. He remained at Maryland and said, &quot;Last year the kids made a commitment to me and I realized it was my turn. We&#x27;ve got plenty left to do. This program has not yet arrived.&quot;

===2002 season===

Friedgen&#x27;s second year began with a 1–2 record, and he implored his team to consider it the start of a &quot;new season&quot;. Maryland then won nine of its remaining ten regular season games, including a come-from-behind homecoming victory against the Philip Rivers-led 15th-ranked NC State team. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; credited a &quot;stifling defense&quot;, dynamic special teams play, and an offense that thrived under quarterback Scott McBrien and a simplified playbook despite the loss of leading rusher Bruce Perry to injury. Maryland ended the season with a 30–3 victory over Tennessee in the 2002 Peach Bowl, the school&#x27;s first bowl victory since the Cherry Bowl in 1985. The team achieved a final record of 11–3, matching the school record for wins in a season first set by the 1976 team.

===2003 season===

In 2003, the Terrapins finished with a 10–3 record, including a 41–7 victory over rival West Virginia in the 2004 Gator Bowl. The University of Maryland football team became one of five programs nationally to reach the ten-win plateau from 2001 to 2003, and Friedgen became the first coach in ACC history to win ten or more games in his first three seasons as a head coach.

===2004 season===

The 2004 season was the first disappointment of Friedgen&#x27;s tenure, and the team failed to qualify for a bowl game. Highlights included, on October 30, an upset of fifth-ranked Florida State to take away the first-ever Maryland win in that series, as well as the first defeat of a top-five team since 1982. On November 27, a 13–7 win over Wake Forest gave Friedgen his 36th win as head coach, which made him the winningest fourth-year coach in conference history.

===2005 season===

The 2005 season again saw Maryland fail to qualify for a bowl game. Friedgen&#x27;s team started out with a 4–2 start, but a lack of offensive efficiency and a propensity for unforced turnovers—both of which may be attributed in part to an injury sustained by quarterback Sam Hollenbach—caused the team to win only one of its last five games to finish with a 5–6 record for a second consecutive season. The 2005 season did see the first Crab Bowl Classic game since 1965.

===2006 season===

After two losing seasons, Friedgen led a Maryland resurgence in 2006 and ended speculation on his job security. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; surmised that Friedgen would have repeated as ACC Coach of the Year had it not been for Wake Forest&#x27;s impressive season under Jim Grobe. Maryland qualified for a bowl game for the first time since 2003. Despite being outgained by every one of its eleven Division I FBS opponents, the Terrapins started the season 8–2, highlighted by a 28–26 victory over Virginia in which the team stormed back from a 20–0 halftime deficit to defeat the Cavaliers. Maryland also became the first team since 1985 to defeat both Florida State and Miami in the same year. The Terrapins defeated Purdue 24–7 in the Champs Sports Bowl to give Friedgen his 50th win as Maryland&#x27;s head coach. Friedgen&#x27;s 50 wins in six seasons ties him with former North Carolina head coach Dick Crum for the second most wins by a sixth-year coach in the ACC (former Clemson head coach Danny Ford holds the record with 52 wins in his first six seasons.)

===2007 season===

The 2007 season saw Maryland defeat tenth-ranked Rutgers on the road, as well as eighth-ranked Boston College in the regular-season home finale. This marked the first time in history that the school had beaten two top-10 teams in the same season. Maryland joined Kentucky, LSU, and Illinois as the only teams to accomplish this feat in 2007. A 37–0 shutout of NC State allowed the Terrapins to qualify for postseason play for the fifth time in Friedgen&#x27;s seven seasons.

On December 28, Maryland played Oregon State in the Emerald Bowl and scored on the first drive. The Terrapins eventually lost, 21–14.

===2008 season===

Maryland entered the 2008 season with 30 senior players, the largest class since Friedgen took over as head coach in 2001. Despite the experienced team, expectations were low and the ACC&#x27;s preseason poll projected Maryland to finish fifth among the six teams in the Atlantic Division. At the end of summer training, and amidst some controversy, senior Jordan Steffy was named the starting quarterback over junior Chris Turner who had finished the 2007 campaign atop the depth chart.

In the season-opener, Maryland used all three of its quarterbacks to edge Division I FCS Delaware, 14–7. The following week, the Terrapins were beaten decisively by Middle Tennessee State, 24–14, and some pundits predicted Friedgen was on the coaching &quot;hot seat&quot; and that his job was in peril. Maryland rebounded to record wins against four Top-25 ranked opponents. In week twelve, the Terrapins possessed a 7–3 record and were ranked first in the Atlantic Division with two regular season games remaining. Maryland lost both, however, and the team&#x27;s standing fell. The Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho, selected the Terrapins to play the Western Athletic Conference&#x27;s number-two team, Nevada. In an offensive shoot-out against the nation&#x27;s number-five offensive team, Maryland triumphed with a final result of 42–35. The Terrapins posted an 8–5 (4–4 ACC) record and Friedgen extended his postseason tally to 4–2, with twice as many bowl wins as any other coach in school history.

===2009 season===

The Terrapins finished the season 2–10, with narrow victories against the James Madison Dukes and Clemson Tigers. Turnovers, a lack of talent, injuries, inexperience, and poor offensive line play were cited as causes for the poor season.

Friedgen&#x27;s job security was questioned, but with a $1.75 million salary, there was some question as to whether the University of Maryland could afford to buy out his remaining contract. According to contracts, Friedgen was to retire after the 2011 season and James Franklin would have become the new head coach. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; chronicled fans frustrations with Friedgen, his staff, and the arrangement with Franklin.

In November 2009, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; quoted anonymous sources that a buyout of Friedgen&#x27;s contract of over $4 million was possible. Friedgen&#x27;s attorney, Jack Reale, said that neither he nor Friedgen had been approached about a buyout. The article also said that Friedgen &quot;privately resented&quot; the athletic department naming Franklin his successor, due to how it affects other members of the coaching staff. It was also reported that Friedgen had support from the leaders of the Terrapin Club and the Maryland Gridiron Network booster groups. Two former Terp basketball players and prominent members of the State University system, Len Elmore and Tom McMillen, expressed doubt that public funds would be used to buy out Friedgen&#x27;s contract, and boosters of the program said they knew of no effort to raise private funds for that purpose.

On December 1, 2009, Maryland announced Friedgen would return for the 2010 season.

===2010 season===
Maryland went 8–4 during the regular season. For the turnaround, the Atlantic Coast Conference named Friedgen the ACC Coach of the Year.

After Maryland won seven of its first 10 games, questions about Friedgen&#x27;s job security diminished. On November 19, 2010, Maryland athletic director Kevin Anderson announced that Friedgen would return for the 2011 season, the final year of his contract. Despite this announcement, after offensive coordinator James Franklin accepted a job at Vanderbilt and offered positions to four other members of the staff, Anderson did not answer questions about Friedgen&#x27;s future on December 17.

On December 18, 2010, it was reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the school was terminating him as head coach and offered a buyout of his remaining contract valued at $2,000,000. On December 20, 2010, athletic director Kevin Anderson made an official announcement that Friedgen would not be returning for the 2011 season. In an interview with WNST radio in Baltimore, Friedgen said he was so angry over the firing that he burned his Maryland diploma and was &quot;flying a Georgia Tech flag right now,&quot; though he later clarified that he was joking and had not actually burned his diploma.

==Personal life==
Friedgen has been married to his wife Gloria (née Spina) since 1973. They have three daughters.

<doc id="1240376" wikidata="Q302726" url="?curid=1240376" title="ISO 10303">
<text>ISO 10303 is an ISO standard for the computer-interpretable representation and exchange of product manufacturing information. It is an ASCII-based format. Its official title is: &quot;Automation systems and integration — Product data representation and exchange&quot;. It is known informally as &quot;STEP&quot;, which stands for &quot;Standard for the Exchange of Product model data&quot;. ISO 10303 can represent 3D objects in Computer-aided design (CAD) and related information.

== Overview ==
The objective of the international standard is to provide a mechanism that is capable of describing product data throughout the life cycle of a product, independent from any particular system. The nature of this description makes it suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases and archiving.

STEP can be typically used to exchange data between CAD, computer-aided manufacturing, computer-aided engineering, product data management/enterprise data modeling and other CAx systems.
STEP addresses product data from mechanical and electrical design, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, analysis and manufacturing, as well as additional information specific to various industries such as automotive, aerospace, building construction, ship, oil and gas, process plants and others.

STEP is developed and maintained by the ISO technical committee TC 184, &quot;Automation systems and integration&quot;, sub-committee SC 4, &quot;Industrial data&quot;. Like other ISO and IEC standards STEP is copyright by ISO and is not freely available. However, the 10303 EXPRESS schemas are freely available, as are the recommended practices for implementers.

Other standards developed and maintained by ISO TC 184/SC 4 are:
* ISO 13584 PLIB - Parts Library
* ISO 15531 MANDATE - Industrial manufacturing management data
* ISO 15926 Process Plants including Oil and Gas facilities Life-Cycle data
* ISO 18629 PSL- Process specification language
* ISO 18876 IIDEAS - Integration of industrial data for exchange, access, and sharing
* ISO 22745 Open technical dictionaries and their application to master data
* ISO 8000 Data quality

STEP is closely related with PLIB (ISO 13584, IEC 61360).

== History ==
The basis for STEP was the Product Data Exchange Specification (PDES), which was initiated during the mid-1980&#x27;s and was submitted to ISO in 1988. The Product Data Exchange Specification (PDES) was a data definition effort intended to improve interoperability between manufacturing companies, and thereby improve productivity.

The evolution of STEP can be divided into four release phases. The development of STEP started in 1984 as a successor of IGES, SET and VDA-FS. The initial plan was that &quot;STEP shall be based on one single, complete, implementation-independent Product Information Model, which shall be the Master Record of the integrated topical and application information models&quot;. But because of the complexity, the standard had to be broken up into smaller parts that can be developed, balloted and approved separately. In 1994/95 ISO published the initial release of STEP as international standards (IS) with the parts 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 101, AP 201 and AP 203. Today AP 203 Configuration controlled 3D design is still one of the most important parts of STEP and supported by many CAD systems for import and export.

In the second phase the capabilities of STEP were widely extended, primarily for the design of products in the aerospace, automotive, electrical, electronic, and other industries. This phase ended in the year 2002 with the second major release, including the STEP parts AP 202, AP 209, AP 210, AP 212, AP 214, AP 224, AP 225, AP 227, AP 232. Basic harmonization between the APs especially in the geometric areas was achieved by introducing the Application Interpreted Constructs (AIC, 500 series).

A major problem with the monolithic APs of the first and second releases is that they are too big, have too much overlap with each other, and are not sufficiently harmonized. These deficits led to the development of the STEP modular architecture (400 and 1000 series). This activity was primarily driven by new APs covering additional life-cycle phases such as early requirement analysis (AP 233) and maintenance and repair (AP 239), and also new industrial areas (AP 221, AP 236). New editions of the previous monolithic APs on a modular basis have been developed (AP 203, AP 209, AP 210). The publication of these new editions coincided with the release in 2010 of the new ISO product SMRL, the STEP Module and Resource Library, that contains all STEP resource parts and application modules on a single CD. The SMRL will be revised frequently and is available at a much lower cost than purchasing all the parts separately.

In December 2014, ISO published the first edition of a new major Application Protocol, AP 242 &quot;Managed model based 3d engineering&quot;, that combined and replaced the following previous APs in an upward compatible way:
* AP 201, &quot;Explicit draughting&quot;. Simple 2D drawing geometry related to a product. No association, no assembly hierarchy.
* AP 202, &quot;Associative draughting&quot;. 2D/3D drawing with association, but no product structure.
* AP 203, &quot;Configuration controlled 3D designs of mechanical parts and assemblies&quot;.
* AP 204, &quot;Mechanical design using boundary representation&quot;
* AP 214, &quot;Core data for automotive mechanical design processes&quot;
* AP 242, &quot;Managed model based 3D engineering&quot;

AP 242 was created by merging the following two Application protocols:
* AP 203, &quot;Configuration controlled 3D designs of mechanical parts and assemblies&quot; (as used by the Aerospace Industry).
* AP 214, &quot;Core data for automotive mechanical design processes&quot; (used by the Automotive Industry).

In addition AP 242 edition 1 contains extensions and significant updates for:
* Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing
* Kinematics
* Tessellation

Two APs had been modified to be directly based on AP 242, and thus became supersets of it:
* AP 209, &quot;Composite and metallic structural analysis and related design&quot;
* AP 210, &quot;Electronic assembly, interconnect and packaging design&quot;. This is the most complex and sophisticated STEP AP.
AP242 edition 2, published in April 2020, extends edition 1 domain by the description of Electrical Wire Harnesses and introduces an extension of STEP modelisation and implementation methods based on SysML and system engineering with an optimized XML implementation method.

This new edition contains also enhancements on 3D Dimensioning and Tolerancing, and Composite Design. New functionalities are also introduced like:

* curved triangles
* textures
* levels of detail (LODs)
* color on vertex
* 3D scanner data support 
* persistent IDs on geometry
* additive manufacturing

== Structure ==
STEP is divided into many parts, grouped into
* Environment
** Parts 1x: Description methods: EXPRESS, EXPRESS-X
** Parts 2x: Implementation methods: STEP-File, STEP-XML, SDAI
** Parts 3x: Conformance testing methodology and framework
* Integrated data models
** The Integrated Resources (IR), consisting of
*** Parts 4x and 5x: Integrated generic resources
*** Parts 1xx: Integrated application resources
*** PLIB ISO 13584-20 &quot;Parts library: Logical model of expressions&quot;
** Parts 5xx: Application Interpreted Constructs (AIC)
** Parts 1xxx: Application Modules (AM)
* Top parts
** Parts 2xx: Application Protocols (AP)
** Parts 3xx: Abstract Test Suites (ATS) for APs
** Parts 4xx: Implementation modules for APs

In total STEP consists of several hundred parts and every year new parts are added or new revisions of older parts are released. This makes STEP the biggest standard within ISO.
Each part has its own scope and introduction.

The APs are the top parts. They cover a particular application and industry domain and hence are most relevant for users of STEP. Every AP defines one or several Conformance Classes, suitable for a particular kind of product or data exchange scenario. To provide a better understanding of the scope, information requirements and usage scenarios an informative application activity model (AAM) is added to every AP, using IDEF0.

STEP is primarily defining data models using the EXPRESS modeling language. Application data according to a given data model can be exchanged either by a STEP-File, STEP-XML or via shared database access using SDAI.

Every AP defines a top data models to be used for data exchange, called the &quot;Application Interpreted Model&quot; (AIM) or in the case of a modular AP called &quot;Module Interpreted Models&quot; (MIM). These interpreted models are constructed by choosing generic objects defined in lower level data models (4x, 5x, 1xx, 5xx) and adding specializations needed for the particular application domain of the AP. The common generic data models are the basis for interoperability between APs for different kinds of industries and life cycle stages.

In APs with several &quot;Conformance Classes&quot; the top data model is divided into subsets, one for each Conformance Class.
The requirements of a conformant STEP application are:
* implementation of either a preprocessor or a postprocessor or both,
* using one of the STEP implementation methods STEP-File, STEP-XML or SDAI for the AIM/MIM data model and
* supporting one or several conformance classes of an AP.
Originally every APs was required to have a companion Abstract test suite (ATS) (e.g. ATS 303 for AP 203), providing Test Purposes, Verdict Criteria and Abstract Test Cases together with example STEP-Files. But because the development of an ATS was very expensive and inefficient this requirement was dropped and replaced by the requirements to have an informal validation report and recommended practices how to use it. Today the recommended practices are a primary source for those going to implement STEP.

The &quot;Application Reference Models&quot; (ARM) is the mediator between the AAM and the AIM/MIM. Originally its purpose was only to document high level application objects and the basic relations between them. IDEF1X diagrams documented the AP of early APs in an informal way. The ARM objects, their attributes and relations are mapped to the AIM so that it is possible to implement an AP. As APs got more and more complex formal methods were needed to document the ARM and so EXPRESS which was originally only developed for the AIM was also used for the ARM. Over time these ARM models got very detailed till to the point that some implementations preferred to use the ARM instead of the formally required AIM/MIM. Today a few APs have ARM based exchange formats standardized outside of ISO TC184/SC4:
* PLM-Services within the OMG for AP 214
* ISO 14649 &quot;Data model for computerized numerical controllers&quot; for AP 238
* PLCS-DEXs within OASIS (organization) for AP 239

There is a bigger overlap between APs because they often need to refer to the same kind of products, product structures, geometry and more. And because APs are developed by different groups of people it was always an issue to ensure interoperability between APs on a higher level. The &quot;Application Interpreted Constructs&quot; (AIC) solved this problem for common specializations of generic concepts, primarily in the geometric area. To address the problem of harmonizing the ARM models and their mapping to the AIM the &quot;STEP modules&quot; were introduced. They contain a piece of the ARM, the mapping and a piece of the AIM, called MIM. Modules are built on each other, resulting in an (almost) directed graph with the AP and conformance class modules at the very top. The modular APs are:
* AP 209, &quot;Composite and metallic structural analysis and related design&quot;
* AP 210, &quot;Electronic assembly, interconnect and packaging design&quot;
* AP 221, &quot;Functional data and schematic representation of process plants&quot;
* AP 236, &quot;Furniture product data and project data&quot;
* AP 239, &quot;Product life cycle support&quot;
* AP 242, &quot;Managed model based 3d engineering&quot;

The modular editions of AP 209 and 210 are explicit extensions of AP 242.

== Coverage of STEP Application Protocols (AP) ==
The STEP APs can be roughly grouped into the three main areas design, manufacturing and life cycle support.

Design APs:
* Mechanical:
** AP 207, &quot;Sheet metal die planning and design&quot;
** AP 209, &quot;Composite and metallic structural analysis and related design&quot;
** AP 235, &quot;Materials information for the design and verification of products&quot;
** AP 236, &quot;Furniture product data and project data&quot;
** AP 242, &quot;Managed model based 3d engineering&quot;
* Connectivity oriented electric, electronic and piping/ventilation:
** AP 210, &quot;Electronic assembly, interconnect and packaging design&quot;. The most complex and sophisticated STEP AP.
** AP 212, &quot;Electrotechnical design and installation&quot;.
** AP 227, &quot;Plant spatial configuration&quot;
* Ship:
** AP 215, &quot;Ship arrangement&quot;
** AP 216, &quot;Ship moulded forms&quot;
** AP 218, &quot;Ship structures&quot;
* Others:
** AP 225, &quot;Building elements using explicit shape representation&quot;
** AP 232, &quot;Technical data packaging core information and exchange&quot;
** AP 233, &quot;Systems engineering data representation&quot;
** AP 237, &quot;Fluid dynamics&quot; has been cancelled and the functionality included in AP 209

Manufacturing APs:
* AP 219, &quot;Dimensional inspection information exchange&quot;
* AP 223, &quot;Exchange of design and manufacturing product information for cast parts&quot;
* AP 224, &quot;Mechanical product definition for process plans using machining features&quot;
* AP 238 - &quot;Application interpreted model for computer numeric controllers&quot;
* AP 240, &quot;Process plans for machined products&quot;

Life cycle support APs:
* AP 239, &quot;Product life cycle support&quot;
* AP 221, &quot;Functional data and schematic representation of process plants&quot;
* AP 241, &quot;Generic Model for Life Cycle Support of AEC Facilities&quot; (planned)

The AP 221 model is very similar to the ISO 15926-2 model, whereas AP 221 follows the STEP architecture and ISO 15926-2 has a different architecture. They both use ISO-15926-4 as their common reference data library or dictionary of standard instances. A further development of both standards resulted in Gellish English as general product modeling language that is application domain independent and that is proposed as a work item (NWI) for a new standard.

The original intent of STEP was to publish one integrated data-model for all life cycle aspects. But due to the complexity, different groups of developers and different speed in the development processes, the splitting into several APs was needed. But this splitting made it difficult to ensure that APs are interoperable in overlapping areas. Main areas of harmonization are:
* AP 212, 221, 227 and 242 for technical drawings with extension in AP 212 and 221 for schematic functionality
* AP 224, 238 and 242 for machining features and for Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing

For complex areas it is clear that more than one APs are needed to cover all major aspects:
* AP 212 and 242 for electro-mechanical products such as a car or a transformer. This will be addressed by the second edition of AP242 that is currently under development
* AP 242, 209 and 210 for electro/electronic-mechanical products
* AP 212, 215, 216, 218, 227 for ships
* AP 203/214, 224, 240 and 238 for the complete design and manufacturing process of piece parts.

<doc id="1240378" wikidata="Q903282" url="?curid=1240378" title="Symmetry breaking">
<text>In physics, symmetry breaking is a phenomenon where a disordered but symmetric state collapses into an ordered, but less symmetric state. This collapse is often one of many possible bifurcations that a particle can take as it approaches a lower energy state. Due to the many possibilities, an observer may assume the result of the collapse to be arbitrary. This phenomenon is fundamental to quantum field theory (QFT), and further, contemporary understandings of physics. Specifically, it plays a central role in the Glashow–Weinberg–Salam model which forms part of the Standard model modelling the electroweak sector.In an infinite system (Minkowski spacetime) symmetry breaking occurs, however in a finite system (that is, any real super-condensed system), the system is less predictable, but in many cases quantum tunneling occurs. Symmetry breaking and tunneling relate through the collapse of a particle into non-symmetric state as it seeks a lower energy.

Symmetry breaking can be distinguished into two types, explicit and spontaneous. They are characterized by whether the equations of motion fail to be invariant, or the ground state fails to be invariant.

== Non-technical description ==
This section describes spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is the idea that for a physical system, the lowest energy configuration (the vacuum state) is not the most symmetric configuration of the system. Roughly speaking there are three types of symmetry that can be broken: discrete, continuous and gauge, ordered in increasing technicality.

An example of a system with discrete symmetry is given by the figure with the red graph: consider a particle moving on this graph, subject to gravity. A similar graph could be given by the function formula_1. This system is symmetric under reflection in the y-axis. There are three possible stationary states for the particle: the top of the hill at formula_2, or the bottom, at formula_3. When the particle is at the top, the configuration respects the reflection symmetry: the particle stays in the same place when reflected. However, the lowest energy configurations are those at formula_3. When the particle is in either of these configurations, it is no longer fixed under reflection in the y-axis: reflection swaps the two vacuum states.

An example with continuous symmetry is given by a 3d analogue of the previous example, from rotating the graph around an axis through the top of the hill, or equivalently given by the graph formula_5. This is essentially the graph of the Mexican hat potential. This has a continuous symmetry given by rotation about the axis through the top of the hill (as well as a discrete symmetry by reflection through any radial plane). Again, if the particle is at the top of the hill it is fixed under rotations, but it has higher gravitational energy at the top. At the bottom, it is no longer invariant under rotations but minimizes its gravitational potential energy. Furthermore rotations move the particle from one energy minimizing configuration to another. There is a novelty here not seen in the previous example: from any of the vacuum states it is possible to access any other vacuum state with only a small amount of energy, by moving around the trough at the bottom of the hill, whereas in the previous example, to access the other vacuum, the particle would have to cross the hill, requiring a large amount of energy.

Gauge symmetry breaking is the most subtle, but has important physical consequences. Roughly speaking, for the purposes of this section a gauge symmetry is an assignment of systems with continuous symmetry to every point in spacetime. Gauge symmetry forbids mass generation for gauge fields, yet massive gauge fields (W and Z bosons) have been observed. Spontaneous symmetry breaking was developed to resolve this inconsistency. The idea is that in an early stage of the universe it was in a high energy state, analogous to the particle being at the top of the hill, and so had full gauge symmetry and all the gauge fields were massless. As it cooled, it settled into a choice of vacuum, thus spontaneously breaking the symmetry, thus removing the gauge symmetry and allowing mass generation of those gauge fields. A full explanation is highly technical: see electroweak interaction.

==Spontaneous symmetry breaking==
In spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), the equations of motion of the system are invariant, but any vacuum state (lowest energy state) is not. 

For an example with two-fold symmetry, if there is some atom that has two vacuum states, occupying either one of these states breaks the two-fold symmetry. This act of selecting one of the states as the system reaches a lower energy is SSB. When this happens, the atom is no longer formula_6 symmetric (reflectively symmetric) and has collapsed into a lower energy state.

Such a symmetry breaking is parametrized by an order parameter. A special case of this type of symmetry breaking is dynamical symmetry breaking.

In the Lagrangian setting of quantum field theory (QFT), the Lagrangian formula_7 is a functional of quantum fields which is invariant under the action of a symmetry group formula_8. However, the vacuum expectation value formed when the particle collapses to a lower energy may not be invariant under formula_8. In this instance, it will partially break the symmetry of formula_8, into a subgroup formula_11. This is spontaneous symmetry breaking. 

Within the context of gauge symmetry however, SSB is the phenomenon by which gauge fields &#x27;acquire mass&#x27; despite gauge-invariance enforcing that such fields be massless. This is because the SSB of gauge symmetry breaks gauge-invariance, and such a break allows for the existence of massive gauge fields. This is an important exemption from Goldstone&#x27;s theorem, where a Nambu-Goldstone boson can gain mass, becoming a Higgs boson in the process.

Further, in this context the usage of &#x27;symmetry breaking&#x27; while standard, is a misnomer, as gauge &#x27;symmetry&#x27; is not really a symmetry but a redundancy in the description of the system. Mathematically, this redundancy is a choice of trivialization, somewhat analogous to redundancy arising from a choice of basis.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking is also associated with phase transitions. For example in the Ising model, as the temperature of the system falls below the critical temperature the formula_6 symmetry of the vacuum is broken, giving a phase transition of the system.

==Explicit symmetry breaking==

In explicit symmetry breaking (ESB), the equations of motion describing a system are variant under the broken symmetry. In Hamiltonian mechanics or Lagrangian mechanics, this happens when there is at least one term in the Hamiltonian (or Lagrangian) that explicitly breaks the given symmetry.

In the Hamiltonian setting, this is often studied when the Hamiltonian can be written formula_13. 

Here formula_14 is a &#x27;base Hamiltonian&#x27;, which has some manifest symmetry. More explicitly, it is symmetric under the action of a (Lie) group formula_8. Often this is an integrable Hamiltonian. 

The formula_16 is a perturbation or interaction Hamiltonian. This is not invariant under the action of formula_8. It is often proportional to a small, perturbative parameter.

This is essentially the paradigm for perturbation theory in quantum mechanics. An example of its use is in finding the fine structure of atomic spectra.

== Examples ==

Symmetry breaking can cover any of the following scenarios:
:* The breaking of an exact symmetry of the underlying laws of physics by the apparently random formation of some structure; 
:* A situation in physics in which a minimal energy state has less symmetry than the system itself; 
:* Situations where the actual state of the system does not reflect the underlying symmetries of the dynamics because the manifestly symmetric state is unstable (stability is gained at the cost of local asymmetry); 
:* Situations where the equations of a theory may have certain symmetries, though their solutions may not (the symmetries are &quot;hidden&quot;).
One of the first cases of broken symmetry discussed in the physics literature is related to the form taken by a uniformly rotating body of incompressible fluid in gravitational and hydrostatic equilibrium. Jacobi and soon later Liouville, in 1834, discussed the fact that a tri-axial ellipsoid was an equilibrium solution for this problem when the kinetic energy compared to the gravitational energy of the rotating body exceeded a certain critical value. The axial symmetry presented by the McLaurin spheroids is broken at this bifurcation point. Furthermore, above this bifurcation point, and for constant angular momentum, the solutions that minimize the kinetic energy are the &quot;non&quot;-axially symmetric Jacobi ellipsoids instead of the Maclaurin spheroids.

<doc id="1240381" wikidata="Q3656777" url="?curid=1240381" title="Chingachgook">
<text>Chingachgook is a fictional character in four of James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s five &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;, including his 1826 novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. Chingachgook was a lone Mohican chief and companion of the series&#x27; hero, Natty Bumppo. In &quot;The Deerslayer&quot; (1841), Chingachgook married Wah-ta-Wah, who had a son with him named Uncas, but died while she was still young. Uncas, who was at his birth &quot;last of the Mohicans&quot;, grew to manhood but was killed in a battle with the Huron warrior Magua. Chingachgook died as an old man in the novel &quot;The Pioneers&quot; (1823), which made him the actual &quot;last of the Mohicans&quot;, having outlived his son.

== &quot;The Leatherstocking Tales&quot; ==
In the series &quot;The Leatherstocking Tales&quot; by James Fenimore Cooper, Chingachgook is the best friend and companion of the main character Natty Bumppo, aka Hawkeye. He appears in &quot;The Deerslayer&quot;, &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;, and &quot;The Pioneers&quot;. He is characterized by his skills as a warrior and forester, his bravery, his wisdom, and his pride for his tribe.

==Other literature==
Chingachgook is a major character in &quot;Song of the Mohicans&quot; by Paul Block (Bantam Books, 1985, ), a sequel to &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. Taking up the story a few days after Uncas&#x27; death and burial, it recounts the adventures of Hawkeye and Chingachgook as they travel north to discover the connection between an Oneida brave and the Mohican tribe, and whether a sachem truly holds the key to the ultimate fate of the Mohicans.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
Chingachgook is said to have been modeled after a real-life wandering Mohican basket maker and hunter named Captain John. The fictional character, occasionally called John Mohegan in the series, was an idealized embodiment of the traditional noble savage. The French often refer to Chingachgook as &quot;&quot;, the Great Snake, because he understands the winding ways of men&#x27;s nature and he can strike a sudden, deadly blow.

The name is derived from the Lenape language, which is closely related to the Mohican language. In Lenape, means &#x27;big&#x27; and means &#x27;snake&#x27;. Professor William A. Starna, of SUNY Oneonta, says the initial &quot;ch&quot; sound would be pronounced more like the German guttural &quot;h&quot; than an English &quot;ch&quot;. The digraph in the spelling used by John Heckewelder, the source for the name, and the letter in modern Lenape spelling both represent the voiceless velar fricative sound (as in &quot;Bach&quot;), not the voiceless palato-alveolar affricate (as in &quot;church&quot;).

Cooper got the name from Heckewelder&#x27;s book &quot;History, Manners, and Customs of the Indian Nations who once inhabited Pennsylvania and the Neighboring States&quot; (1818), which cited a Lenape word as &quot;&quot; (in Heckewelder&#x27;s spelling which was influenced by German), meaning &quot;a large snake&quot;. He gave this word as such in the context of how to use the adjective (pronounced ) &#x27;large&#x27;, which Heckewelder spelled .

==Portrayals in film and television==

The first film portrayal of Chingachgook was by Wallace Reid in a 1913 film version of &quot;The Deerslayer&quot;.

Bela Lugosi played Chingachgook in two German silent films, &quot;Lederstrumpf, 1. Teil: Der Wildtöter und Chingachgook&quot; (&quot;Leatherstocking 1: The Deerslayer and Chingachgook&quot;) and &quot;Lederstrumpf, 2. Teil: Der Letzte der Mohikaner&quot; (&quot;Leatherstocking 2: The Last of the Mohicans&quot;), both filmed in 1920.

Jay Silverheels, best known for his role as Tonto on &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, played Chingachgook in the 1953 film version of &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;.

Lon Chaney Jr. played Chingachgook in the 1957 TV series &quot;Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans&quot;.

Chingachgook, played by Gojko Mitić, was the main character of an East German western, &quot;Chingachgook the Great Serpent&quot; (1967), based on Cooper&#x27;s novels.

In the BBC miniseries &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; and &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;, Chingachgook was played by John Abineri.

Chingachgook was played by Ned Romero in the TV versions of &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Deerslayer&quot; (1978), by Russell Means in the 1992 film adaptation of &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, by Rodney A. Grant in the 1994 TV series &quot;Hawkeye&quot; and by Graham Greene in the 1996 TV version of &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;.

Many films portray Chingachgook with long hair, braided or flowing. A notable exception is the 1920 adaptation which faithfully represents him with a tuft on his shaved head, according to the novel.

==In Boy Scout legend==
In the Ordeal Ceremony of the Order of the Arrow, the National Honor Society of the Boy Scouts of America, the Legend of the Order refers to an imaginary Lenni Lenape chief named Chingachgook. In the legend, Chingachgook&#x27;s son, Uncas, is the original propagator of the Order. Chingachgook wanted to create a band of volunteers from all the nations of the Delaware River valley to support and protect their collective interests. Uncas volunteered to be the first member of such a group, and thus the Order of the Arrow was founded.

According to the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s Ordeal Ceremony, the preferred pronunciation of the name is &quot;ching-gatch-gook&quot;.

<doc id="1240383" wikidata="Q890778" url="?curid=1240383" title="Power (Kansas album)">
<text>Power is the tenth studio album by American rock band Kansas, released in 1986. It was the band&#x27;s first studio album for MCA Records. The album featured a new lineup, as the band reformed after a period of hiatus.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review, Xavier Russel of the British magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; called the pompous sound of Kansas &quot;very dated&quot; and, despite a few pleasant rockers like &quot;Musicatto&quot;, found other songs &quot;embarrassing beyond belief&quot;. 
In his retrospective review, AllMusic reviewer Bret Adams remarked that Kansas took a dramatic change in musical viewpoints, becoming &quot;more hard rock and pop than prog rock&quot;, which &quot;probably surprised longtime Kansas fans&quot; but gave the band &quot;an interesting, if ultimately short-lived, new direction.&quot;

<text>The Herald-Dispatch is a non-daily newspaper that serves Huntington, West Virginia, and neighboring communities in southern Ohio and eastern Kentucky. It is currently owned by HD Media Co. LLC. It currently publishes Tuesdays-Saturdays, with the Saturday edition dated &quot;Weekend&quot;, with updates on its website on Sundays and Mondays.

==History==
&quot;The Herald-Dispatch&quot; was founded in 1909 when two Huntington newspapers, the &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot;Dispatch&quot;, merged. In 1927, the newspaper became a part of the Huntington Publishing Company, operated by Joseph Harvey Long, the owner of the &quot;Huntington Advertiser&quot;. The company was operated by the Long family until 1971, when it was sold to the &quot;Honolulu Star Bulletin&quot; and then to Gannett ten months later. Its companion afternoon paper, the &quot;Huntington Advertiser&quot;, ceased as a separate publication in 1979. Prior to the &quot;Huntington Advertiser&#x27;s&quot; demise, the combined Sunday newspaper was referred to as the &quot;Herald-Advertiser&quot;, correctly depicted in the movie &quot;We Are Marshall&quot;. Today, it also publishes the &quot;Putnam Herald&quot; and the &quot;Lawrence Herald&quot;, more localized editions of &quot;The Herald-Dispatch&quot; serving Putnam County, West Virginia and Lawrence County, Ohio, respectively.

For the six-month period ending March 31, 2005, the total average paid circulation was 29,098 for the daily edition and 35,552 for the Sunday edition. On May 8, 2007, the newspaper was sold to Gatehouse Media, then to Champion Industries on June 29. Then on May 23, 2009, Champion Industries, which owned the paper at that time, revealed that it was in default of a $70 million loan from Fifth Third Bank and the previous owners, and eliminated 24 positions, representing about 15% of its workforce. In October 2011, they laid off additional employees. In 2013, Champion Industries sold &quot;The Herald-Dispatch&quot; to local politician, Douglas Reynolds, the son of Champion&#x27;s chief executive.

In 2014, &quot;The Herald-Dispatch&quot; parent company HD Media acquired the &quot;Wayne County News&quot; in Wayne, West Virginia. In 2015, the newspaper ceased printing itself, contracting the operation to the &quot;Charleston Gazette-Mail&quot; and laid off its production staff. The newspaper is now printed in Charleston and trucked 50 miles to Huntington for distribution.

In 2017, HD Media acquired the &quot;Logan Banner&quot;, &quot;Williamson Daily News&quot;, the &quot;Coal Valley News&quot; in Madison and &quot;The Pineville Independent Herald&quot; in Pineville from Civitas Media. On March 8, 2018, HD Media, the Herald-Dispatch&#x27;s holding company, was declared the successful bid in the auction for the Charleston Gazette-Mail after the paper had declared bankruptcy.

On July 16, 2023, the newspaper announced the elimination of its Sunday print edition. Instead, a combined weekend edition would be sent out on Saturday starting Aug. 5.

<text>Ngarutjaranya, also known as Mount Woodroffe (officially Ngarutjaranya/Mount Woodroffe), is a mountain in the Australian state of South Australia, located in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands in the state&#x27;s northwest. It is South Australia&#x27;s highest peak, at .

== Cultural significance ==
The name of the mountain comes from the Pitjantjatjara language.
In Pitjantjatjara mythology, the mountain embodies the mythological creature Ngintaka.

== Geography ==
Ngarutjaranya is located in the far northwest of South Australia, in the Musgrave Ranges. The mountain range rises some 700–800 metres from the surrounding plains and comprises massifs of granite and gneiss.

== History ==
William Ernest Giles was the first European man to pass through the area and camped to the south of Woodroffe on September 7, 1873. William Christie Gosse had previously named it Mt Woodroffe on July 20 that same year. Woodroffe was named after George Woodroffe Goyder, Surveyor-General of South Australia and an early Australian explorer.

In the 1960s, Ngarutjaranya was considered as a potential site for the proposed Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). It lost out due to its remoteness compared to Siding Spring in New South Wales, where the AAT sits today amongst other astronomical observatories.

== Access ==
Access is limited as a permit is required to enter the Anangu Pitjantjatjara lands.
As of October 2024, it is confirmed Ngarutjaranya cannot be climbed anymore as no more permits to climb it are issued by the APY lands (Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara).

<doc id="1240400" wikidata="Q261319" url="?curid=1240400" title="Fort Buckley">
<text>Fort Buckley was a defensive fort built in Wellington, New Zealand in 1885, overlooking the port of Wellington and Wellington Harbour. The remains of the fort are listed as a Category 1 Historic Place by Heritage New Zealand.

The fort included two rifled 64 pounder muzzle-loading guns, which had a range of about three kilometres.

The fort was named after Patrick Buckley, an Irish New Zealand soldier, lawyer, and politician.

An original photo of the guns is shown on the Capital Defence site - &quot;Sixty four pound gun at Fort Buckley, Kaiwharawhara, Wellington&quot; 1886. A site map of the original fort is also shown on the Capital Defence website.

During World War 2 an anti-aircraft gun was installed on the former caretaker&#x27;s cottage area located in the slopes above the gun-pits and midway up the overall site.

Today only the concrete foundations of the two RML gun-pits remain, but the anti-aircraft gun&#x27;s original location used on the old caretaker&#x27;s cottage pad during World War 2 is harder to spot, though the concrete pad foundation of the cottage is obvious.

The Fort Buckley site land is now owned by the Wellington City Council and has been set aside as a reserve since 2010. Since becoming a reserve, the Fort Buckley site is now highly accessible, with a well-formed gravel path installed and a prominently sign posted and fenced site entrance from Barnard Street in Wadestown, Wellington.

The path to the fort has been cleared of vegetation and scrub many times over the years (the area has had several scrub fires), and at times the cuttings have been dumped in the gun pits and built up. The Fort Buckley site is now regularly maintained and enhanced by the Highland Park Progressive Association (HPPA) residents&#x27; group in partnership with the Wellington City Council.

The HPPA has researched a detailed pamphlet about the history of Fort Buckley and copies are available from a container beside the wooden Fort Buckley sign.

Various community social activities, including family picnics, geocaching, track walking, are regularly taking place onsite. During March 2014 the HPPA installed a large picnic table on the former caretaker&#x27;s cottage concrete pad and significantly sprayed and cleared further vegetation with assistance of teams from the Wellington City Council.

Heritage New Zealand lists Fort Buckley as being of national historical significance. The long-term goal is to either locate the original 64-pounder guns, which are believed to be buried in Palmerston North, or to have replica iron guns cast to be placed in the two-gun pits.

<doc id="1240413" wikidata="Q391406" url="?curid=1240413" title="Mỹ Sơn">
<text>Mỹ Sơn () is a cluster of abandoned and partially ruined Shaiva Hindu temples in central Vietnam, constructed between the 4th and the 13th century by the Kings of Champa, an Indianized kingdom of the Cham people. The temples are dedicated to the veneration of God in accordance with Shaivism, wherein God is named Shiva, or The Auspicious One. In this particular complex, he is venerated under various local names, the most important of which is Bhadreshvara.

Mỹ Sơn is located near the village of Duy Phú, in the administrative district of Duy Xuyên in Quảng Nam Province in Central Vietnam, 69 km southwest of Da Nang, and approximately 10 km from the historic Champa capital of Trà Kiệu. The temples are in a valley roughly two kilometres wide that is surrounded by two mountain ranges.

From the 4th to the 13th century AD, the valley at Mỹ Sơn was a site of religious ceremony for kings of the ruling dynasties of Champa, as well as a burial place for Cham royalty and national heroes. It was closely associated with the nearby Cham cities of Indrapura (Đồng Dương) and Simhapura (Trà Kiệu). At one time, the site encompassed over 70 temples as well as numerous stele bearing historically important inscriptions in Sanskrit and Cham.

Mỹ Sơn is perhaps the longest inhabited archaeological site in Mainland Southeast Asia, but a large majority of its architecture was destroyed by US bombing during a single week of the Vietnam War.

The Mỹ Sơn temple complex is regarded one of the foremost Shaiva Hindu temple complexes in Southeast Asia and is the foremost heritage site of this nature in Vietnam. It is often compared with other historical temple complexes in Southeast Asia, such as Borobudur of Java in Indonesia, Angkor Wat of Cambodia, Wat Phou of Laos, Bagan of Myanmar and Prasat Hin Phimai of Thailand. As of 1999, Mỹ Sơn has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. At its 23rd meeting, UNESCO accorded Mỹ Sơn this recognition pursuant to its criterion C (II), as an example of evolution and change in culture, and pursuant to its criterion C (III), as evidence of an Asian civilization which is now extinct.

== History ==
The over 70 temples and tombs extant at Mỹ Sơn have been dated to the period between the 4th century and the 13th century AD. However, the inscriptions and other evidence indicate that earlier now defunct constructions probably were present from the 4th century. The complex may have been the religious and cultural centre of historical Champa, while the government was based in nearby Simhapura or Đồng Dương.

=== Bhadravarman and Bhadreśvara ===

The earliest historical events documented by the evidence recovered at Mỹ Sơn relate to the era of King Bhadravarman I (literally &quot;Blessed armour&quot; but also meaning the &quot;Jasminum sambac&quot; flower; ), who ruled from 380 until 413, and who spent the latter part of his reign waging war against the population of Chinese-occupied northern Vietnam. At Mỹ Sơn, Bhadravarman built a hall containing a lingam to worship Shiva under the Sanskrit name &quot;Bhadreśvara&quot; &quot;Blessed Lord&quot;, a composite created from the king&#x27;s own name and the word &quot;īśvara&quot; &quot;lord&quot; commonly used to refer to Shiva.

King Bhadravarman caused a stele to be erected at Mỹ Sơn the inscription on which recorded his foundation. The stele indicates that the king dedicated the entire valley of Mỹ Sơn to Bhadreśvara. The text ends with a plea from Bhadravarman to his successors: &quot;Out of compassion for me do not destroy what I have given.&quot; Drawing upon the doctrines of saṃsāra and karma, he added, &quot;If you destroy [my foundation], all your good deeds in your different births shall be mine, and all the bad deeds done by me shall be yours. If, on the contrary, you properly maintain the endowment, the merit shall belong to you alone.&quot; Bhadravarman&#x27;s successors heard his plea, it seems, for Mỹ Sơn became the religious hub of Champa for many generations.

=== Sambhuvarman ===
The original temples of Bhadravarman were mainly composed of wooden materials such timber logs. Unfortunately, the temple complex was comsumed by a great fire occurred in 535/536 AD, during the reign of Rudravarman I (r. 527–572). In the 7th century, King Sambhuvarman (Phạm Phạn Chi in Vietnamese, Fan Che as transcribed from the Chinese), who reigned from 572 until 629 and son of Rudravarman, rebuilt the temple, reinstalled the god under the name Sambhu-Bhadresvara, and erected a stele to document the event. The stele affirmed that Sambhu-Bhadresvara was the creator of the world and the destroyer of sin, and expressed the wish that he &quot;cause happiness in the kingdom of Champa.&quot; The stele also applauded the king himself, claiming that he was &quot;like a terrestrial sun illuminating the night&quot; and that his glory rose &quot;like the moon on an autumn evening.&quot;

Ironically, perhaps, Sambhuvarman&#x27;s reign was marred by one of the most devastating invasions ever suffered by the country of Champa. In 605 AD, the Chinese general Liu Fang led an army southwards from the area of what is now northern Vietnam, defeated the elephant-riders of Sambhuvarman, and sacked the Cham capital, making off with an enormous booty that included over one thousand Buddhist books as well as the gold tablets commemorating the reigns of the previous eighteen kings. Heading back north with their heist, the Chinese invaders were struck by an epidemic that felled a large number of them, including Liu Fang. Sambhuvarman, for his part, returned home to his kingdom, began the process of rebuilding, and made sure to send regular shipments of tribute to the Chinese court, in order through appeasement to prevent a recurrence of the recent disaster.

French scholars investigating Mỹ Sơn at the beginning of the 20th century identified a then still existent edifice distinguished for &quot;its majestic proportions, the antiquity of its style, and the richness of its decoration&quot; as the temple of Sambhu-Bhadresvara constructed by King Sambhuvarman. The edifice, which is known to scholars as &quot;A1&quot;, was practically destroyed by US aerial bombing in the Vietnam War and is now little more than a formless pile of bricks.

=== Prakasadharma ===
King Prakasadharma (Po Kia Pho Pa Mo, as transcribed from the Chinese) ruled Champa from 653 AD to approximately 687. Upon ascending to the throne, he also assumed the name Vikrantavarman. During his reign, he expanded the borders of Champa toward the South and sent ambassadors and tribute (including tame elephants) to China. Inscriptions link him not only to Mỹ Sơn, but also to the nearby urban settlements of Trà Kiệu and Đồng Dương. He began the religious practice of donating &quot;kosas&quot; or decorated metallic sleeves to be placed over a lingam. Unusually for a king of Champa, he was devoted not only to Shiva, but also to Vishnu.

One of the most important steles to be found at Mỹ Sơn is that erected by Prakasadharma in 657 AD. The purpose of the stele was to commemorate the king&#x27;s establishment of a god identified as the ruler of the world, i.e. Shiva, with a view to overcoming the seeds of karma that lead to rebirth. The stele is important because it sets forth the king&#x27;s ancestry and is of great help in reconstructing the sequence of Champa&#x27;s rulers. Among his ancestors, notably, the king claimed a Cambodian king named Isanavarman I. And like the Cambodian kings, he traced his ancestry to the legendary Kamma Kshtriya King from Kakatiya kingdom and the nāga-princess Soma.

=== Later developments ===

Subsequent kings renovated the older temples and constructed additional ones. For many centuries, the building of temples and shrines of varying sizes continued, and Mỹ Sơn served as the religious and cultural center of the Cham civilization in central Vietnam, as well as the burial place of kings and religious leaders.

Most of the extant temples at Mỹ Sơn, such as the Isanabhadresvara, were built in the late 10th century and 11th century AD by king Harivarman II (r. 989–997) and later king Harivarman IV (r. 1074–1080). The inscriptions from this period have not survived, except in fragmentary form. At the beginning of the 10th century, the Cham center of power was at Đồng Dương, not far from Mỹ Sơn. By the end of the century, it had been displaced southward to Bình Định Province on account of military setbacks in wars with the Viet. However, Cham kings continued periodically to renovate the temples at Mỹ Sơn and even to build new foundations. The latest significant Cham record at Mỹ Sơn is a pillar inscription of King Jaya Indravarman V dated 1243 AD. By the early 15th century, the Cham had lost their northernmost lands, including the area of Mỹ Sơn, to the Viet.

=== Modern scholarship ===
Following the conquest of central Vietnam by Vietnamese emperor Le Thanh Tong which reduced the status of Champa kingdoms to autonomous subordinate regions and the decline and eventual fall of Champa, the Mỹ Sơn complex fell into disuse and was largely forgotten. Vietnamese people settled and built villages, towns, cities on conquered Cham lands. It was rediscovered in 1898 by the Frenchman . A year later, members of the scholarly society called École française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient (EFEO) began to study the inscriptions, architecture, and art of Mỹ Sơn. In 1904, they published their initial findings in the journal of the society called &quot;Bulletin de l&#x27;École française d&#x27;Extrême Orient&quot; (BEFEO). Henri Parmentier gave a description of the ruins at Mỹ Sơn, and M. L. Finot published the inscriptions that had been found there.

=== Restoration ===
In 1937, French scholars began to restore the temples at Mỹ Sơn. In 1937 and 1938, the main temple known as &quot;A1&quot; and the smaller temples surrounding it were restored. Other major temples were restored between 1939 and 1943. However, many historical buildings were destroyed during the Vietnam War. The temples were part of a People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam and Viet Cong base area when United States aircraft bombed the region in August 1969. The surrounding area is still rendered dangerous through the presence of unexploded land mines.

Some of the temple sites in the centre of the complex have survived to this day. However, worries persist regarding the structural soundness of the remaining temples, some of which are vulnerable to collapse. Although many statues have been removed to France or to historical museums in Vietnam, such as the Museum of Cham Sculpture in Da Nang, others can be viewed in an in-situ museum that has been set up with the funding of benefactors from Germany and Poland. In 1981, the restoration works were carried out by a team of Polish conservators from Lublin, headed by Kazimierz Kwiatkowski &quot;Kazik&quot;.

From 2002 to 2004, the Ministry of Culture of Vietnam allotted around US$440,000 to maintain the site. A draft plan of UNESCO was funded by the Government of Italy and sponsors from Japan to prevent further degradation. These efforts are also funded by the World Monuments Fund.

India has supported conservation and restoration of the UNESCO world heritage site of ‘My Son’ in Quang Nam Province of Central Vietnam, which represents historical links between the two countries. Towards the conservation of Cham monuments at My Son, a request was received from Vietnam and as a follow up to this, the ASI Technical Team prepared a Preliminary Observation Report as mandated by the Ministry of External Affairs. Subsequently a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Government of India and Government of Vietnam on 28 October 2014. Thereafter, a Technical Team of the ASI conducted survey and prepared detailed estimates and documentation work.
India has extended assistance through the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in conservation of three blocks of Cham temples in Central Vietnam’s UNESCO World Heritage Site at My Son in Quang Nam Province, which have been restored by ASI during 2017-22 at an outlay of US$ 2.25 million. The completion of conservation and restoration of A, H and K group of temples by ASI was marked on 20 December 2022 at the My Son complex site in Quang Nam province. 

== Archeology and architecture ==

=== Types of buildings ===
All of the remaining buildings at Mỹ Sơn are believed to be religious buildings. They are of the following types:
* A &quot;kalan&quot; is a brick sanctuary, typically in the form of a tower, used to house a deity.
* A &quot;mandapa&quot; is an entry hallway contiguous with a sanctuary.
* A &quot;kosagrha&quot; or &quot;fire-house&quot; is a construction, typically with a saddle-shaped roof, used to house the valuables belonging to the deity or to cook for the deity.
* A &quot;gopura&quot; is a gate-tower leading into a walled temple complex.

=== System for the identification of buildings ===

When he began his studies of Mỹ Sơn in 1899, Henri Parmentier found the remnants of 71 temples. He classified them into 14 groups, including 10 principal groups each consisting of multiple temples. For purposes of identification, he assigned a letter to each of these principal groups: A, A&#x27;, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K. Within each group, he assigned numbers to the edifices comprising it. Thus &quot;My Son E1&quot; refers to the edifice at My Son belonging to group &quot;E&quot; that has been assigned the number &quot;1.&quot;

=== Architectural styles ===

Art historians have classified the architectural and artistic legacy of Champa into seven artistic styles or phases of development. Six of the styles are represented at Mỹ Sơn, and two are believed to have originated from there. They are known as the Mỹ Sơn E1 Style and the Mỹ Sơn A1 Style. In particular the temple known as &quot;A1&quot; is often referred to as the architectural masterpiece of the Cham. The six styles of Cham architecture represented at Mỹ Sơn are the following:
* The style of Mỹ Sơn E1 and F1 dates to the 8th century AD. The temple known as &quot;E1&quot; is now ruined. The style which it established is represented today by two works of art that formerly belonged to the temple but today are housed in the Museum of Cham Sculpture in Da Nang: a pedestal and a tympanum.
* The style exemplified by My Son A2, C7 and F3 is similar to the style of Hòa Lai from the turn of the 9th century.
* The Đồng Dương style of the late 9th century is reflected in Mỹ Sơn A10, A11-13, B4, and B12. This style is named after the Vietnamese town that occupies the site of the 9th century city and Buddhist monastery of Indrapura. The archeological site of the monastery has been largely destroyed; French scholars of the early 20th century were able to create diagrams of its layout and the disposition of its buildings. Numerous striking works of sculpture belonging to this style survive in Vietnamese museums.
* The Mỹ Sơn A1 style of the 10th century is exemplified by Mỹ Sơn B5, B6, B7, B9, C1, C2, C5, D1, D2, and D4. It is the most heavily represented style at My Son, and is known for its elegance and grace. The style&#x27;s namesake and most important architectural exemplar, the once magnificent tower known as &quot;A1,&quot; is largely ruined. It is a mound of earth, surrounded by rubble and the outline of a wall, at the center of which stands a whitish pedestal. A scale model of the former temple created by Japanese researchers as well as a schematic frontal view are exhibited in the Museum of Cham Sculpture in Da Nang. The most striking of the remaining buildings belonging to the style may be the storehouse B5, which exemplifies the saddle-shaped roof peculiar to Cham artchitecture. The My Son A1 style is sometimes also known as the Tra Kieu Style, after the nearby town of Trà Kiệu which may be the site of the historical Cham city of Simhapura. Many architectural ornaments from this style survive and are displayed in the Museum of Cham Sculpture.
* A transitional style of the early 11th century to the middle of the 12th century is exhibited in Mỹ Sơn E4, F2, and the K group of sites.
* The style of Bình Định that prevailed in Cham architecture from the end of the 11th century, when the center of the Cham polity was displaced southward from the area around My Son to Vijaya in Bình Định Province, to the start of the 13th is represented by Mỹ Sơn B1 and groups G and H.

=== Building techniques ===

Most of the temples at Mỹ Sơn were made of red brick, and only one (the temple labelled &quot;B1&quot;) was made of stone. Even the decorative carvings on the Cham temples were cut directly onto the bricks themselves, rather than onto sandstone slabs inserted into brick walls as is observable for example in the 9th century Cambodian temple of Bakong.

To this day, the construction techniques used by the Cham builders are not completely understood. Issues that have not been completely resolved include issues about the firing of the bricks, the mortar between the bricks, and decorative carvings found on the bricks.

* At what point in the building process were the bricks hardened by fire? Were the bricks hardened first, and then arranged in order to build the structures, or were the structures built out of partially hardened bricks, after which the entire structures were heated by fire to finish the hardening of the bricks? The hypothesis that the entire structures were reheated following assembly is supported by evidence that the mortar between the bricks was at some point subjected to high temperatures. The contrary hypothesis is supported by the observation that the structures bear no signs of scarring from large intense fires such as would be needed in order to reheat them as whole.
* How were the bricks stuck together? One hypothesis is that the builders at Mỹ Sơn developed a way to glue bricks together using tree resin native to central Vietnam. Another hypothesis is that the builders used a sticky mortar made from the same clay as the bricks themselves. The latter hypothesis is supported by chemical tests that have found no trace of any organic substance between the bricks, but instead have found mineral substances similar to those present in the core of the bricks. Today the mortar that once held the bricks together has largely decayed, and even a strong wind can knock loose bricks from the structures.
* At what point in the process were the decorative carvings made? Were the walls constructed and then carved, or were the bricks carved first and then assembled so as to create the walls? An examination of the carvings reveals no broken lines as would be expected if the bricks were carved first and then assembled; and as a result scholars have concluded that the Cham craftsmen made their carvings directly onto finished brick walls.

=== Inscriptions ===
The people of Champa maintained written records in both Sanskrit and old Cham. They wrote on perishable materials, such as large leaves, and also created inscriptions in stone. They used scripts borrowed from India. None of the writings on perishable materials have survived. However, numerous stone inscriptions have been preserved, transcribed, and translated into modern languages.

Many of Champa&#x27;s most important inscriptions are on steles, that is to say on slabs or pillars of stone erected precisely for the purpose of hosting inscriptions. Scholars have found approximately 32 steles at Mỹ Sơn, dated between the 5th and the 12th century AD.

The subject-matter of Cham inscriptions is mostly political and religious. They are written from the perspective of kings or very high potentates seeking to affirm their legitimacy and their relationship to the divine. Many of the inscriptions document a gift to a god, such as a gift of land, of people, or of treasure, or a foundation dedicated to a god, such as the foundation of a temple, an altar, or a pedestal. The inscriptions also provide us with important information such as the name of the country (typically &quot;Campadesa&quot; in the Sanskrit inscriptions, &quot;nagara Campa&quot; in the Cham inscriptions), and the names of some of its most important cities: &quot;Simhapura&quot; (&quot;Lion City&quot;), &quot;Virapura&quot; (&quot;Knight City&quot;), &quot;Rajapura&quot; (&quot;King City&quot;), &quot;Vijaya&quot; (&quot;Victory&quot;). Finally, a number of the inscriptions allude to or describe interesting historical events, such as the ongoing wars between Champa and Cambodia in the 12th century.

<text>Lola Lemire Tostevin (born June 15, 1937 in Timmins, Ontario) is a Canadian poet, novelist and biographer. Although not widely known among the general public, she is one of Canada&#x27;s leading feminist writers, and a prominent figure in Canadian literary analysis.

Despite being Franco-Ontarian, born of French-speaking parents and with French as her first language, Tostevin writes primarily in English. She has, however, published work in French as well, and has translated several notable Canadian authors, both English and French, for publication in the other language.

Her work often deals with international themes, and is similar in this way to Hédi Bouraoui.

<text>Henry Oldenburg (also Henry Oldenbourg) (c. 1618 as Heinrich Oldenburg – 5 September 1677) was a German theologian, diplomat, and natural philosopher, known as one of the creators of modern scientific peer review. He was one of the foremost s of 17th-century Europe, with a network of correspondents to rival those of Fabri de Peiresc, Marin Mersenne, and Ismaël Boulliau. At the foundation of the Royal Society in London, he took on the task of foreign correspondence, as the first Secretary.

==Early life==
Born in Bremen, Germany, he was trained in theology and received his degree from the local &quot;Gymnasyum illustre&quot; on 2 November 1639. He had an initial very firm grasp of the German, Latin, and Greek languages. His movements during the 1640s are unclear, but he is thought to have worked as a tutor in England for much of the decade. In 1648 he left England and spent some time in Leiden and Utrecht in the Dutch Republic, where he became conversant in the Dutch language. After a short stay back in Bremen in the spring, he arrived back in London in July 1653 as a diplomatic envoy of the city of Bremen&#x27;s senate to the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell for matters concerning the ongoing First Anglo-Dutch War.

Settling then in England of the Interregnum, he forged a strong relationship with his lifelong patron Robert Boyle, and with John Milton, who wrote of him approvingly that he had &quot;learnt to speak our language more accurately and fluently than any other foreigner I have ever known&quot; (&quot;Correspondence&quot;, 1.34). Oldenburg eventually became the tutor to Boyle&#x27;s nephew, the politician Richard Jones, and travelled with him through France from 1657 to 1660. Here Oldenburg also added to his intellectual baggage the French language, the last European language in which he was completely conversant.

Oldenburg married his second wife, Dora Katherina Dury (1654–77), the daughter of Dorothy and John Dury in London on 13 August 1668. Either through Milton, whom he had met earlier in his diplomatic mission, or through Lady Ranelagh, sister to Boyle and the mother of Richard Jones, Oldenburg gained entry to an important intellectual circle, including his fellow German native, Samuel Hartlib, whose extensive web of correspondents Oldenburg was to take over, John Dury who became his father-in-law, and others such as the economist William Petty. Among Oldenburg&#x27;s correspondents at this time was Baruch Spinoza, whom he was introduced to on a trip to the Netherlands, and to whom he presented a volume of writings on scientific topics by Boyle.

==Secretary of the Royal Society==

After the Restoration he became an early member (&quot;original fellow&quot;) of the Royal Society (founded in 1660), and served as its first secretary along with John Wilkins, maintaining an extensive network of scientific contacts through Europe. He also became the founding editor of the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;. Oldenburg began the practice of sending submitted manuscripts to experts who could judge their quality before publication. This was the beginning of both the modern scientific journal and the practice of peer review. &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; continues today and is the longest running scientific journal in the world.

He was briefly imprisoned in the Tower as a suspected spy in 1667, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Oldenburg&#x27;s correspondence was linked to support from the politician Sir Joseph Williamson; in part Oldenburg supplied Williamson with intelligence information.

Oldenburg enjoyed good health in his lifetime, but he fell seriously ill on 3 September 1677, and he died two days thereafter at his Pall Mall, London home. He was interred on 7 September at St Mary the Virgin, Bexley. His widow died ten days later.

<doc id="1240426" wikidata="Q1735754" url="?curid=1240426" title="Wicked (Maguire novel)">
<text>Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West is an American novel published in 1995, written by Gregory Maguire with illustrations by Douglas Smith. It is the first in &quot;The Wicked Years&quot; series, and was followed by &quot;Son of a Witch&quot; (published in September 2005), &quot;A Lion Among Men&quot; (published in October 2008), and &quot;Out of Oz&quot; (published in November 2011).

&quot;Wicked&quot; is a darker and more adult-themed revisionist exploration of the characters and setting of the 1900 novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; by L. Frank Baum, its sequels, and the 1939 film adaptation. It is presented as a biography of the Wicked Witch of the West, here given the name &quot;Elphaba&quot;. The book follows Elphaba from her birth through her social ostracism, school years, radicalization, and final days. Maguire shows the traditionally villainous character in a sympathetic light, using her journey to explore the problem of evil and the nature versus nurture debate, as well as themes of terrorism, propaganda, and existential purpose.

In 2003, it was adapted as the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical &quot;Wicked&quot;, in-turn adapted into a two-part feature film, with the first film released in November 2024 and the expected in November 2025.

== Background ==
Maguire began contemplating the nature of evil while living in London in the early 1990s. He noticed that while the problem of evil had been explored from many different perspectives, those perspectives were seldom synthesized together. He wondered whether calling a person evil might be enough to cause a self-fulfilling prophecy.
If everyone was always calling you a bad name, how much of that would you internalize? How much of that would you say, all right, go ahead, I&#x27;ll be everything that you call me because I have no capacity to change your minds anyway so why bother. By whose standards should I live?He was also inspired by the 1993 murder of James Bulger, in which both victim and perpetrators were young children.Everyone was asking: how could those boys be so villainous? Were they born evil or were there circumstances that pushed them towards behaving like that? It propelled me back to the question of evil that bedevils anybody raised Catholic.Up to that point strictly a children&#x27;s author, Maguire had difficulty finding an effective way to write about evil, since in his mind, there were no truly evil characters in children&#x27;s literature. In what he later described as &quot;the one great revelation of my life,&quot; Maguire realized that there were in fact villains in children&#x27;s books; however, they were usually written as one-dimensional stock characters in order to provoke a quick emotional reaction from young readers. Wondering whom to write about, he envisioned the Wicked Witch of the West, as played by Margaret Hamilton in the MGM film, delivering her iconic line, &quot;I&#x27;ll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!&quot; Maguire had a lifelong fascination with &quot;The&quot; &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;, both Baum&#x27;s original novel and the film, which he watched every year during its annual broadcast. He decided to tell the Wicked Witch&#x27;s life story using the same large scale and broad moral messages found in the novels of Charles Dickens.

== Plot ==
In the Land of Oz, a minister&#x27;s wife, Melena Thropp, gives birth to a daughter, Elphaba. Elphaba has green skin, sharp teeth, a savage demeanor, and a fear of water. The story details Elphaba&#x27;s difficult childhood before flashing forward to show her at Shiz University with her social climbing roommate Galinda, who is destined to become Glinda.

While at Shiz, the two girls discover that Oz is rife with political tension. Headmistress and Ozian power broker Madame Morrible suggests that Elphaba and Glinda work for her from behind the scenes to help stabilize the political situation in Oz. Preferring more direct action, Elphaba and Glinda travel to the Emerald City, where they meet the Wizard and plead their case. When the Wizard dismisses their concerns, Elphaba takes matters into her own hands. She goes into hiding and joins an underground terrorist group working out of the Emerald City.

Five years later, Elphaba reconnects with former schoolmate Prince Fiyero, now married with three children, and the two begin an illicit affair. While Elphaba makes an attempt at assassinating Madame Morrible, Fiyero is caught in Elphaba&#x27;s hideout and murdered by the Wizard&#x27;s secret police force. Blaming herself for his death, Elphaba takes refuge in a convent. Seven years later, she visits Fiyero&#x27;s family at their castle, Kiamo Ko, in hopes of gaining their forgiveness. She brings along a boy named Liir, implied to be her son by Fiyero. Fiyero&#x27;s family allow her to stay as their guest, but his wife Sarima refuses to hear her apology. While there, Elphaba finds the Grimmerie, a book of spells and magic, and begins to study sorcery, gaining a reputation as a witch.

Elphaba&#x27;s father asks for her help with her sister Nessarose, who has also become a witch and has taken Elphaba&#x27;s hereditary position as ruler of Munchkinland. Tired of being used as a pawn in other people&#x27;s agendas and having no interest in ruling, Elphaba instead renounces her claim. Nessarose promises to give Elphaba her enchanted silver shoes after she dies. When Elphaba returns to Kiamo Ko, she discovers the Wizard&#x27;s troops have taken Fiyero&#x27;s family prisoner.

Seven years later, a storm visits Munchkinland, dropping a farmhouse on Nessarose and killing her. The farmhouse&#x27;s passengers are a little girl named Dorothy Gale and her little dog, Toto. Elphaba and Glinda reunite for the first time in years shortly after Nessarose&#x27;s death. Upon learning Glinda sent Dorothy off with Nessarose&#x27;s shoes, for fear of their power igniting a civil war in Munchkinland, Elphaba is furious, as the shoes were rightfully hers. She fears the shoes will fall into the hands of the Wizard, who may use them to further advance his power and political agenda.

Elphaba meets with the Wizard to beg for the release of Fiyero&#x27;s family in exchange for the Grimmerie. The Wizard explains that he has killed them all except for Fiyero&#x27;s daughter Nor, whom he keeps as a slave. He explains that he comes from a different world, the same world the book comes from, and is not bound by the laws of Oz. Elphaba then seeks out the elderly Madame Morrible to complete the assassination she failed at years earlier, only to discover that she had passed away, mere moments before Elphaba arrived. After bludgeoning the old woman&#x27;s corpse, Elphaba learns from the Clock of the Time Dragon that the Wizard is her biological father, making her the child of two different worlds and thus destined never to fit in anywhere. She returns to Kiamo Ko and Liir informs her he has learned from soldiers stationed nearby that the Wizard has sent Dorothy and her companions on a mission to kill Elphaba.

When Dorothy and her friends arrive at Kiamo Ko, she tells Elphaba that while the Wizard sent her with orders to &quot;kill the Wicked Witch of the West,&quot; Dorothy came to apologize for killing Nessarose. Furious that Dorothy is asking for the forgiveness she herself has been denied, Elphaba waves her burning broom in the air and inadvertently sets her skirt on fire. Dorothy throws a bucket of water on her to save her, unaware that Elphaba is allergic to water. The water melts her away.

Dorothy returns to the Wizard with a green bottle, which he recognizes as the potion he used to drug Melena years earlier. He hastily departs the Emerald City for his own world mere hours before a coup would have overthrown and killed him. The book ends with political chaos reigning over Oz.

== Themes ==
=== Nature of evil ===
According to author Maguire, &quot;Wicked&quot; is primarily about identifying with someone who is ostracized. &quot;The Gazette&quot; called &quot;Wicked&quot; &quot;a cautionary tale...about what happens when we as a society decide to label anyone who differs from the norm as evil.&quot;

Prior to writing &quot;Wicked&quot;, Maguire became interested in examining the nature of evil from the perspective of someone considered evil. He noted that while Baum had deliberately avoided using traditional fairy tale characters in writing the original novel, the Wicked Witch of the West was the sole exception, being depicted as the stereotypical &quot;witch in her castle&quot; figure, with wickedness her single defining character trait. The novel raises the question of whether evil is inborn or acquired. Elphaba is a social outcast despite being of noble birth, which makes her question how much power she truly has over her own life.

=== Propaganda and terrorism ===
Writing for &quot;The American Experience&quot;, Rebecca Onion called &quot;Wicked&quot; &quot;an extended meditation on power and politics.&quot; Maguire has noted the similarities between the words &quot;wicked&quot; and &quot;Hitler,&quot; calling it &quot;no accident&quot; that he chose this title for his book. He recalled reading a newspaper headline in 1991 comparing Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler and feeling firsthand the emotional power of propaganda. Maguire &quot;set out to examine the language and propaganda used to marshal brute force against individuals or minorities that might have been opposed to the war.&quot; In the book, one major plank of the Wizard&#x27;s agenda involves the subjugation of sentient Animals and Madame Morrible promotes this idea using a type of moralistic poem called a &quot;quell.&quot; Elphaba instantly sees the propaganda for what it is.

&quot;Tor&quot; noted that terrorism, committed both by and against the state, plays a major role in the second half of the book. The Wizard keeps an SS-like secret police, the Gale Force, which uses violence to carry out his totalitarian agenda. Elphaba similarly uses terrorism to combat them, though she shies away from targeting children.

=== Life purpose ===
A lifelong Catholic, Maguire remembered the nuns who taught in the Catholic schools of his boyhood home of Albany, New York. He admired their sense of purpose and dedication to their cause, saying that their integrity and inscrutability made them witches in his mind. Elphaba discovers her own purpose as a student at Shiz University, where the murder of her favorite professor, Dr. Dillamond, inspires her to join the cause of Animal rights. As the story progresses, she deepens her commitment to her cause, becoming a political exile for her beliefs.

== As revisionist literature ==
&quot;Wicked&quot; is on its face a revisionist parallel novel for &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; compared it to &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; and &quot;Wild Wood&quot; as part of &quot;a fascinating sub-genre of novels that revisit well-known stories as much in the spirit of criticism as homage.&quot; While previous authors had accepted the existing moral framework of the Oz stories, &quot;Wicked&quot; showed affection for the originals while simultaneously questioning everything they stood for. Maguire presents a sympathetic view of a villainous character by detailing her life story and helping the reader understand how &quot;an innocent if rather green and biting child&quot; can become &quot;a still moralistic terrorist.&quot; He also transformed the Land of Oz itself, changing what he saw as an insular, parochial world into one where different groups and their political agendas intersect and overlap.

== Reception ==
&quot;Wicked&quot; received mostly positive reviews. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called it a &quot;fantastical meditation on good and evil, God and free will&quot; which combined &quot;puckish humor and bracing pessimism.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called it &quot;A captivating, funny, and perceptive look at destiny, personal responsibility, and the not-always-clashing beliefs of faith and magic.&quot; &quot;Library Journal&quot; recommended the book to &quot;good readers who like satire, and love exceedingly imaginative and clever fantasy.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; favorably compared &quot;Wicked&quot; with other &quot;fantasy novels of ideas&quot; such as &quot;Gormenghast&quot; and &quot;Dune&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; was a notable outlier, criticizing the novel&#x27;s strident politics and moral relativism. Reviewer Michiko Kakutani argued that Maguire &quot;shows little respect for Baum&#x27;s original story.&quot; &quot;Wicked&quot;, she felt, &quot;turns a wonderfully spontaneous world of fantasy into a lugubrious allegorical realm, in which everything and everyone is labeled with a topical name tag.&quot;

In 2024 the book was banned in Texas by the Katy Independent School District on the basis that the novel is &quot;adopting, supporting, or promoting gender fluidity&quot; despite also pronouncing a bullying policy that protects infringements on the rights of the student.

==Adaptations==

=== Musical ===

In 2003, the novel was adapted as the Broadway musical &quot;Wicked&quot; by composer/lyricist Stephen Schwartz and librettist Winnie Holzman. The musical was produced by Universal Pictures and directed by Joe Mantello, with musical staging by Wayne Cilento. The Broadway production was followed by long-running productions in Chicago, London, San Francisco, and Los Angeles in the United States, as well as Germany and Japan. It was nominated for ten Tony Awards, winning three, and is the 4th longest-running Broadway show in history, with over 7,400 performances. The original Broadway production starred Idina Menzel as Elphaba and Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda.

=== Unproduced television program ===
In a 2009 interview, Maguire stated that he had sold the rights to ABC to make an independent non-musical TV adaptation of &quot;Wicked&quot;. It would not be based on Winnie Holzman&#x27;s script. On January 9, 2011, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that ABC would be teaming up with Salma Hayek and her production company to create a TV miniseries of &quot;Wicked&quot; based solely on Maguire&#x27;s novel. The miniseries never entered production.

===Films===

In September 2010, &quot;Filmshaft&quot; disclosed that Universal Pictures was beginning work on a film adaptation of the stage musical. In December 2012, following the success of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Marc Platt, also a producer of the stage version, announced the film was going ahead, later confirming the film was aiming for a 2016 release. Universal announced in 2016 that the film would be released in theaters on December 22, 2021, with Stephen Daldry directing. After production was shut down during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic, Daldry left the production due to scheduling conflicts and was replaced by Jon M. Chu. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were cast as Elphaba and Galinda, respectively, with Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero.

The first film of the two-part adaptation was released on November 22, 2024, and the will be released on November 21, 2025.

=== Graphic novel ===
In March 2025, William Morrow Paperbacks will publish the first volume of a graphic novel adaptation of &quot;Wicked&quot;, with illustrations by Scott Hampton.

<text>The bearded sakis, or cuxiús, are five or six species of New World monkeys, classified in the genus Chiropotes. They live in the eastern and central Amazon in South America, ranging through southern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and northern and central Brazil. The species are entirely allopatric, their distributions being separated by major rivers.

Bearded sakis differ from the closely related saki monkeys of the genus &quot;Pithecia&quot; by a pronounced beard, a tuft of hair that extends from its jaw, down its throat to the top of its chest, and is strongly pronounced particularly in the males. The tail is long and hairy, and is used for balance and not grasping. Bearded sakis reach from in size and a weight from .

Like many New World monkeys, bearded sakis are diurnal and arboreal. They inhabit tropical rainforests, usually in the crowns of tree. They move on all four by the branches, spending most of the day searching for food. At the night they sleep clasped to thicker branches, never spending successive nights in the same tree. Bearded sakis live together in groups of approximately 18 to 30 animals. Within the group they communicate with bird-like twitter and high whistles. Sometimes they mingle with other primates such as capuchin and squirrel monkeys.

Fruits form the main part of the diet of the bearded sakis, but they also eat nuts, buds, leaves, insects and small vertebrates.

Once a year (usually in early autumn or late summer) the female bears a single offspring after a 5-month gestation. After about three months it begins to explore its environment independently and on it is briefly cured. Bearded sakis reach full maturity at 4 years of age. Their life expectancy is approximately 15 years.

Bearded sakis are highly sensitive to hunting and habitat destruction. Consequently, two of the five species recognized by IUCN (they do not recognize &quot;C. israelita&quot;, but do recognize &quot;C. sagulatus&quot;) are considered at least vulnerable, with &quot;C. satanas&quot; being endangered.

== Classification ==

Until recently, only two species were recognized in this genus, but &quot;C. israelita&quot; was re-validated in 2003 (having long been considered a synonym of &quot;Chiropotes&quot;), where it – based on differences in colour of pelage, karyotype, and molecular analysis – also was recommended treating &quot;C. chiropotes&quot; and &quot;C. utahickae&quot; as species separate from &quot;C. satanas&quot;. The IUCN note the taxonomic confusion, but lists &quot;C. sagulatus&quot; as a valid species, with &quot;C. israelita&quot; as a synonym.

* Genus &quot;Chiropotes&quot;
**Black bearded saki, &quot;Chiropotes satanas&quot;
** Red-backed bearded saki, &quot;Chiropotes chiropotes&quot;
** Brown-backed bearded saki, &quot;Chiropotes israelita&quot;
** Uta Hick&#x27;s bearded saki, &quot;Chiropotes utahicki&quot;
** White-nosed saki, &quot;Chiropotes albinasus&quot;
** Reddish-brown bearded saki, &quot;Chiropotes sagulatus&quot;

<doc id="1240438" wikidata="Q1277244" url="?curid=1240438" title="In the Spirit of Things">
<text>In the Spirit of Things is the eleventh studio album by American rock band Kansas, released in 1988 (see 1988 in music). It is a very loosely organized concept album, telling the story of a flood hitting the real Kansas city of Neosho Falls in 1951. It was the first Kansas album since 1975&#x27;s &quot;Masque&quot; to lack a hit single.

==History==
According to the author Dan Fitzgerald, Rich Williams was inspired to create this album after having read the book &quot;Ghost Towns of Kansas, Volume II&quot; (1979), specifically the chapter on Neosho Falls.

The album is Kansas&#x27;s last studio effort for a major label. It didn&#x27;t receive much promotion, as MCA Records dropped a slew of &quot;older&quot; artists shortly after its release and famously switched its attention to current younger acts such as Tiffany. Kansas got caught in that decision and the album was a commercial failure. The label did produce several promotional materials for the record, including a glossy video for &quot;Stand Beside Me&quot;. The song was played regularly on MTV and allowed the single to hit the album rock charts, the last Kansas single to chart in any format. Other songs were released in odd formats, such as a 12&quot; promotional single of &quot;I Counted on Love&quot;, an import edited CD single of &quot;House on Fire&quot;, and a small-sized CD single of &quot;Stand Beside Me&quot;. The album would also be the last Kansas release to appear in vinyl format until the release of &quot;The Prelude Implicit&quot; in 2016.

A tour in support of this album included a broadcast by the &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot;, which many years later released the show as a CD.

In its retrospective review, AllMusic deemed the album &quot;one of the group&#x27;s more consistent albums and easily a latter-day highlight.&quot; They criticized the album&#x27;s dated production and the lack of a single to compare to their 1970s hits, but argued it to be one of Kansas&#x27;s most focused efforts.

<doc id="1240442" wikidata="Q3051679" url="?curid=1240442" title="Elphaba">
<text>Elphaba Thropp () is the protagonist in the 1995 novel &quot;Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West&quot; by Gregory Maguire, its musical theatre adaptation, and the musical&#x27;s two-part film adaptation, &quot;Wicked&quot; (2024) and &quot;&quot; (2025). Elphaba is a reimagining of the Wicked Witch of the West from L. Frank Baum&#x27;s 1900 novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.

In the Baum novel, the Witch is unnamed and little is explained about her life; &quot;Wicked&quot; creates a backstory for her and explores the world of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; from her perspective. Elphaba is modeled after Margaret Hamilton&#x27;s portrayal in the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;: green-skinned, clad entirely in black and wearing a tall peaked hat. Maguire formulated the name &quot;Elphaba&quot; from the pronunciation of Baum&#x27;s initials—&quot;L.F.B.&quot;

==Characterization==
As Winnie Holzman observed in an interview with &quot;Playbill&quot;, &quot;It was Maguire&#x27;s brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops – and really the whole plot – is different onstage.&quot; Schwartz justified the deviation, saying &quot;Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda – who becomes Glinda – and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.&quot; In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero&#x27;s appearance as a scarecrow, Elphaba&#x27;s survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda – and eventually becoming the Tin Woodman instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba&#x27;s years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir&#x27;s birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, and Doctor Dillamond not being murdered.

==Portrayals==
The role was originated on Broadway and the West End by Idina Menzel, who won the 2004 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. 

Cynthia Erivo portrayed the character in the film adaptation of the first act of the musical, for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and will reprise the role in the 2025 . Karis Musongole played the character as a child in the first film.

<text>Lincoln Memorial University (LMU) is a private university in Harrogate, Tennessee, United States. LMU&#x27;s campus borders on Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. , it had 1,605 undergraduate and 4,200 graduate and professional students.

LMU is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). In March 2019, the LMU Duncan School of Law received full accreditation by the American Bar Association.

==History==
In the 1880s, an entrepreneur named Alexander Arthur and several associates established a firm called American Association, Ltd., the primary purpose of which was to develop the iron ore and coal resources of the Cumberland Gap area. Arthur founded Middlesboro, Kentucky, for the company&#x27;s employees and furnaces, and constructed a railroad line connecting Middlesboro with Knoxville, Tennessee. Arthur believed Middlesboro would grow into a large industrial city, the so-called &quot;Pittsburgh of the South.&quot; In 1888, he founded the city of Harrogate, which he envisioned would someday be a suburb for Middlesboro&#x27;s elite.

Arthur and American Association spent some two million dollars developing Harrogate, the jewel of which was the Four Seasons Hotel, a 700-room structure believed to have been the largest hotel in the U.S. at the time. The hotel included a lavish dining hall, a casino, and a separate sanitarium. The economic panic of the early 1890s and the subsequent collapse of Arthur&#x27;s London financial backers doomed American Associates and the Four Seasons was sold and dismantled.

In 1896, General Oliver O. Howard, a former Union officer who had helped establish Howard University (named for him), embarked on a lecture tour. Howard&#x27;s agent, Cyrus Kehr, suggested Howard establish a university as a living memorial to President Abraham Lincoln. On June 18, 1896, Howard spoke at the Harrow School, an elementary school at Cumberland Gap founded a few years earlier by Reverend A. A. Myers. After the lecture, Myers asked Howard for assistance in establishing a college for the Cumberland Gap region. Howard related to Myers a conversation he had with Lincoln in 1863 in which the president expressed a desire to do something to help the people of East Tennessee, a majority of whom remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War in spite of the greater state&#x27;s secession, and, remembering Kehr&#x27;s suggestion, agreed to help Myers establish a university in Lincoln&#x27;s honor.

With the help of Howard and Kehr, Myers purchased the Four Seasons property, although the sanitarium building was all that remained of the once lavish hotel. Lincoln Memorial University was chartered on February 12, 1897—Lincoln&#x27;s 88th birthday—with Cyrus Kehr as its first president. Howard joined the university as its managing director in 1898, and under his leadership the university expanded, acquiring among other places Alexander Arthur&#x27;s house, which the university used as a conservatory. Howard mentioned the university and its purpose in a speech at Carnegie Hall in 1901, which helped raise money and allowed the university to pay off its debts.

In 1902, the sanitarium building burned, and its surviving blocks were used to build Grant-Lee Hall, which has since been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Arthur&#x27;s house also burned, but its tower, now called &quot;Conservatory Tower&quot;, still stands. In April 1917, British folklorist Cecil Sharp spent several days at Lincoln Memorial University, where he collected 22 local versions of &quot;old world&quot; ballads such as &quot;Lord Thomas and Fair Ellinor&quot;, &quot;The Daemon Lover&quot;, and &quot;Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight.&quot;

==Literary legacy and the Mountain Heritage Literary Festival==
LMU is known for a rich literary history that includes such renowned authors as James Still (&quot;River of Earth&quot;, &quot;The Wolfpen Poems&quot;), Jesse Stuart (&quot;Taps for Private Tussie&quot;, &quot;The Thread That Runs So True&quot;), Don West (&quot;Clods of Southern Earth&quot;), and George Scarbrough (&quot;Tellico Blue&quot;). At one point, Emma Bell Miles, author and painter, served as Artist-in-Residence at the university, a position that went unfilled until it was taken over by bestselling novelist Silas House (&quot;Clay&#x27;s Quilt&quot;, &quot;The Coal Tattoo&quot;) in 2005. House started the Mountain Heritage Literary Festival that same year and the gathering has grown steadily, featuring the region&#x27;s most celebrated writers (Lee Smith, Earl Hamner, Jr., Ron Rash, Sheila Kay Adams, Denise Giardina, etc.) and becoming one of the premier events of Appalachian literature. Lincoln Memorial University is also home to the Grant Lee Literary Society, which spawned the still surviving Gamma Lambda Sigma Fraternity.

==Richard A. Gillespie College of Veterinary Medicine==
The LMU College of Veterinary Medicine welcomed its inaugural class in 2014 and achieved American Veterinary Medical Association accreditation in January 2019. Though many classes and research facilities are located on the main LMU campus in the Richard A. Gillespie College of Veterinary Medicine building (completed in 2020), the College of Veterinary Medicine&#x27;s hands-on educational facilities are located 12 miles from Harrogate in Ewing, Virginia. The DeBusk Veterinary Teaching Center (DVTC) is housed on 700 acres and provides extensive practical experience and educational opportunities with a wide variety of species. The Large Animal Component of the DVTC provides a working farm environment with a large herd of cattle, and provides a hands-on education site where anatomy, clinical, and surgical skills are taught for dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and sheep.

==DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine== 
The initial plans to open Lincoln Memorial University-DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine (LMU-DCOM) began in 2004. Autry O.V. Pete DeBusk, the Chairman of the LMU Board of Trustees and LMU alumnus, was interested in starting a college of osteopathic medicine at LMU. After conducting a year-long feasibility study, LMU announced it was pursuing the development of a college of osteopathic medicine and named Ray Stowers, D.O., F.A.C.O.F.P., a rural family physician, as vice president and dean. The college was named DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine in honor of its initiator. The four-story, building was opened to its inaugural class of osteopathic medical students on August 1, 2007.

The DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine offers two degrees, a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, and a Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies. The college is accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) and the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

==Duncan School of Law==

In the spring of 2008, Lincoln Memorial University announced plans to seek approval to offer legal education leading to the Juris Doctor degree. The law school, named in honor of Tennessee Congressman John James Duncan, Jr., is located in downtown Knoxville, Tennessee in the building commonly referred to as &quot;Old City Hall&quot;. The entering class of the Fall 2011 full-time program had an average LSAT score of 147 while the part-time program had an average LSAT score of 145. These scores represent 33rd and 26th percentile of all LSAT test takers. The average GPA for the entering class of 2011 is 3.01 for the full-time program and 2.99 for the part-time program.

In February 2009, the law school received approval from the Tennessee Board of Law Examiners, which allows Duncan School of Law graduates to apply to take the Tennessee Bar Examination. LMU&#x27;s law school has 231 students. In December 2011, the American Bar Association refused the school&#x27;s application for provisional accreditation. In reaction, the Duncan School sued the ABA, alleging that the ABA was using accreditation to limit the production of new lawyers, thus violating federal antitrust laws. In January 2012, after a judge denied the school&#x27;s requests for an injunction and temporary restraining order against the ABA, the school filed an appeal with the ABA. As a result of the ABA&#x27;s denial of provisional accreditation, numerous students withdrew or sought to transfer from Duncan School of Law.

In February 2012, Duncan School of Law was sued by a former student for &quot;negligent enrollment.&quot; The case was dismissed in 2013. LMU-DSOL received provisional accreditation in 2014. In total 91% of all LMU-DSOL graduates who have sat for the exam have passed. Since the law school graduated its first class in May 2013, 93 percent of LMU Law graduates who have taken a bar exam have passed it.

LMU-DSOL was granted full accreditation on March 1, 2019.

LMU-DSOL&#x27;s 2021 first-time bar passage rate was 50.67%. Of the 2020 graduating class, 62.7% secured full-time long-term bar passage required or JD-advantage employment within 10 months of graduation.

==Abraham Lincoln Library and Museum==

The university&#x27;s Abraham Lincoln Library and Museum displays and interprets a large collection of memorabilia relating to the school&#x27;s namesake, Abraham Lincoln, and the Civil War. The collection was initially formed from donations by the school&#x27;s early benefactor, General Oliver O. Howard, and his friends.

==Athletics==
LMU sports teams, called the &quot;Railsplitters&quot;, compete in NCAA Division II in the South Atlantic Conference.

LMU currently competes in 21 sports. Men&#x27;s sports are: baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field outdoor, volleyball, and wrestling. Women&#x27;s sports are: basketball, beach volleyball, bowling, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field outdoor, volleyball, and wrestling. Bowling participates as an East Coast Conference affiliate. Beach volleyball and men&#x27;s volleyball are single-division NCAA sports.

LMU does not have a football program, though it did have one in the past. Other sports formerly offered at LMU include fencing and tumbling.

Athletics have been a part of LMU since 1907, when baseball was first organized on campus.

Facilities include the Turner Arena, Mary Mars Gymnasium, Dorothy Neely Field (Softball), Lamar Hennon Field (Baseball), LMU Soccer Complex, LMU Lacrosse Complex, LMU Tennis Complex, LMU Indoor Tennis Center, and LMU Golf Complex. The bowling teams are based out of Hillcrest Lanes in Harrogate, Tennessee and the golf teams are based out of Woodlake Golf Club in Tazewell, Tennessee.

<text>Lake Ōmāpere is the largest lake in the Northland Region of New Zealand. It is located to the North of Kaikohe.

The lake sits within the Kaikohe-Bay of Islands volcanic field. The lake was formed when an ancient lava flow blocked a valley, forming the northern shoreline. It is five kilometres in length and covers 12.3 km2, however it is only 2.6 metres deep (and as low as 1.5 m during summer). The lake has few inflow streams, mostly in the southern part of the lake. The Utakura River (south-western margin) is the main outflow which goes to the Hokianga Harbour. The lake catchment is predominantly pasture, with a few areas of native scrub and mature bush.

== Culture and history ==
Lake Ōmāpere is of great cultural and environmental value to Māori tangata whenua.

In May 1845 the Battle of Puketutu, an engagement of the Flagstaff War, occurred at the pā of Hōne Heke at Puketutu, on the shores of Lake Ōmāpere.

The lake level was lowered between 1903 and 1929, but by 1947 silting had restored much of its level.

== Water quality and ecology ==
The water quality in the lake is generally poor and the lake is prone to blooms of toxic algae. The lake is monitored by Northland Regional Council, and the environmental information can be viewed on the LAWA website.

The Lake Ōmāpere Restoration and Management Project aims to develop and implement a voluntary lake management strategy that will work towards improving the health of the lake and help assist the Lake Omapere Trustees in their role as kaitiaki.

<text>West Virginia University at Parkersburg, abbreviated WVUP and WVU Parkersburg, is a public community college in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Although it was originally part of West Virginia University, it is now an independent public institution with its own board of governors and degree-granting authority. Conceived as a community college to serve seven counties in west central West Virginia, it now offers baccalaureate programs. It is the largest community college in West Virginia and the state&#x27;s fifth largest public college with over 3,900 students.

WVU Parkersburg is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

==History==
The college was founded in 1961 as the Parkersburg Branch of West Virginia University. The school&#x27;s name was changed to West Virginia University-Parkersburg Center in 1966. It became Parkersburg Community College (PCC) in 1971 and was originally governed by the West Virginia Board of Regents. In a reorganization of the state&#x27;s higher education governance structure in 1989, the West Virginia Legislature enacted S.B. 420 which, among other initiatives, renamed PCC as West Virginia University at Parkersburg, designating it a regional campus of WVU, and transferred its governance to the newly formed University System of West Virginia.

In 2008, the governance structure of WVU Parkersburg was changed by the state legislature. WVU Parkersburg is now controlled locally by a board of governors and is part of a statewide network of independently accredited community colleges known as the West Virginia Community and Technical College System (CTCS). The WVU Parkersburg Board of Governors approved a Memorandum of Understanding with WVU on May 18, 2009, which outlined a formal relationship between the two schools and designated WVU Parkersburg as an &quot;affiliated institution” of WVU.

===Naming issues===
The school was founded as the Parkersburg Branch of West Virginia University in 1961. Its name was changed to West Virginia University-Parkersburg Center in 1966 and then Parkersburg Community College in 1971. Under Governor Gaston Caperton in 1990, a redesign of the state system of higher education was proposed. The state Speaker of the House was from Parkersburg and added the renaming to the bill. In 1995 this system was replaced by yet another system of college organization under Governor Cecil Underwood, however the school retained the name WVU Parkersburg.

In 2008, the state adopted another system of college organization and &quot;divorced&quot; the community colleges from their parent institutions. WVU and WVU Parkersburg developed several agreements and a memorandum of understanding in the spring of 2009 allowing WVU Parkersburg to retain its name in an &quot;evergreen&quot; agreement.

==Campus==
WVU Parkersburg is located on the outskirts of the city of Parkersburg. The campus is home to, among various buildings, a library, the main administrative building, the College Activities Center, the Workforce and Community Education building, and the Caperton Center for Applied Technology, which opened in 1999. Recently completed facilities include the Applied Technology Lab, the Early Childhood Learning Center, and Eldon Miller Plaza. WVU Parkersburg does not have any student housing on campus; it is a commuter school.

The school originally opened in an abandoned elementary school on Emerson Avenue in Parkersburg in 1961. The bell from the elementary school, which was cast in 1902 by the Meneely Bell Company, is still used in campus ceremonies and is part of the college&#x27;s official seal. In 1965, Wood County voters approved a bond levy for construction of a new educational complex. The college moved to its current location once construction was completed in 1969.

The Jackson County Center, which opened in 1975, is a smaller campus of WVU Parkersburg and offers a limited number of classes for students living closer to its Ripley, West Virginia location.

WVU Parkersburg&#x27;s Downtown Center opened on Market Street in Parkersburg in January 2013 to serve the school&#x27;s new Culinary Academy. The college has a workforce training lab and classroom at the Polymer Alliance Zone&#x27;s Polymer Technology Park in Davisville, West Virginia. WVU Parkersburg also owns a small farm that is used for the Diversified Agriculture program.

==Academics==
WVU Parkersburg is the first and, thus far, only community college in West Virginia to offer any bachelor&#x27;s degrees after becoming accredited to do so in 1991. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees that are currently awarded at WVU Parkersburg include: the Bachelor of Applied Technology, Bachelor of Applied Science, Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Bachelor of Arts, and the Regents Bachelor of Arts (RBA) degree, which gives adult students college credit for past work and life experience and allows them to gain a general college-level education without selecting a specific major.

WVU Parkersburg also offers associate degree and certificate programs, as community colleges traditionally do, in a wide variety of other academic areas which are not offered as baccalaureate programs. The vast majority of these associate degrees are Associates in Applied Sciences degrees, meaning they are non-transferable into four-year degree programs, and therefore not suitable for a student who seeks to continue their education beyond a two-year degree.

WVU Parkersburg is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Specific programs at the institution are also accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE).

==Athletics==
WVU Parkersburg does not currently field any of its own intercollegiate varsity teams. However, it does field several sport club teams that compete with other colleges, including men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s basketball, volleyball, men&#x27;s soccer, golf and table tennis. These teams are known as the Riverhawks, which refers to the Osprey that can be found on Blennerhassett Island near Parkersburg on the Ohio River. The Riverhawks name was voted upon by the student body during the Spring 2009 semester.

<doc id="1240474" wikidata="Q684254" url="?curid=1240474" title="Drawn &amp; Quarterly">
<text>Drawn &amp; Quarterly (D+Q) is a publishing company based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, specializing in comics. It publishes primarily comic books, graphic novels and comic strip collections. The books it publishes are noted for their artistic content, as well as the quality of printing and design. The name of the company is a pun on &quot;drawing&quot;, &quot;quarterly&quot;, and the practice of hanging, drawing and quartering.
Initially it specialized in underground and alternative comics, but has since expanded into classic reprints and translations of foreign works. &quot;Drawn &amp; Quarterly&quot; was the company&#x27;s flagship quarterly anthology during the 1990s.

It is currently the most successful and prominent comics publisher in Canada, publishing well-known comic artists such as Lynda Barry, Kate Beaton, Marc Bell, Chester Brown, Daniel Clowes, Michael DeForge, Guy Delisle, Julie Doucet, Mary Fleener, Joe Matt, Shigeru Mizuki, Rutu Modan, Joe Sacco, Seth, Yoshihiro Tatsumi, Adrian Tomine and Chris Ware. In 2006, Drawn &amp; Quarterly began publishing the Moomin comic strips of Finnish writer and artist Tove Jansson, in book format, in the series &quot;Moomin: The Complete Tove Jansson Comic Strip&quot;. Drawn &amp; Quarterly has a strong reputation in the comics community and its anthologies have won a number of Harvey Awards.

==Overview==
Drawn &amp; Quarterly has become one of the most influential alternative comics publishers, along with Fantagraphics Books of Seattle, Washington. The publisher has a reputation for the quality of the books it publishes, both in terms of content as well as the books&#x27; paper, binding and design. The publisher&#x27;s owner, Chris Oliveros, has a hands-off relationship with the artists he publishes.

==History==
Drawn &amp; Quarterly was founded in 1990 by Montrealer Chris Oliveros, age 23 at the time.

Oliveros was inspired by Art Spiegelman and Françoise Mouly&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; to publish an arts comics periodical. He borrowed $2,000 from his father to publish the first issue of the anthology magazine &quot;Drawn &amp; Quarterly,&quot; which debuted in April 1990. It was intended to be published four times a year, containing short arts comics. Soon, Oliveros realized there were arts comics which were too long to be contained in his magazine, and began publishing stand-alone comic books and graphic novels, beginning with Julie Doucet&#x27;s comic book &quot;Dirty Plotte&quot;. Seth, Joe Matt, and Chester Brown, Toronto-based cartoonists who soon became associated with the publisher. In the early 2000s, Brown had a surprise bestseller with &quot;Louis Riel&quot;. In 2003, &quot;A Drawn &amp; Quarterly Manifesto&quot; was released, describing to booksellers how to stock and sell graphic novels.

As graphic novels became more popular with the public, Oliveros found the need for a publicist. He asked Peggy Burns, who was doing such work at DC Comics, if she knew someone who could fill the job. Burns offered herself, and moved from New York City to Montreal. She was the company&#x27;s third employee, and soon signed a distribution deal for the publisher with Farrar, Straus and Giroux, which greatly expanded the company&#x27;s exposure, while giving it a literary air. Drawn &amp; Quarterly reduced the number of serialized titles it published, focusing on book-form comics such as collections and graphic novels. The company now employs 25 people.

While at first publishing mainly Canadian and American artists, during the 2000s the publisher expanded its catalogue with European artists like Philippe Dupuy and Charles Berbérian, Lewis Trondheim, and Guy Delisle, as well as exploring the Japanese gekiga movement. It also began publishing the works of Shigeru Mizuki, Susumu Katsumata, Yoshihiro Tatsumi, Oji Suzuki, and Seiichi Hayashi for the first time in English.

In 2015, the publisher produced a collection titled &quot;Drawn &amp; Quarterly: Twenty-Five Years of Contemporary Cartooning, Comics and Graphic Novels&quot;, featuring of out-of-print work, remembrances, and essays by well-known writers such as Margaret Atwood. The same year, Oliveros stepped down as publisher to focus on his own cartooning, intending to self-publish the graphic novel &quot;The Envelope Manufacturer&quot;. In his place, Burns took over as publisher and creative director Tom Devlin became executive editor.

In November 2023, employees of Drawn &amp; Quarterly formed a union with the Fédération du Commerce under the Confédération des Syndicats Nationaux, with certification from the Administrative Labor Tribunal of Quebec.

==Librairie Drawn &amp; Quarterly==

In 2007, Drawn &amp; Quarterly opened an English-language bookshop on Bernard Street in Mile End, Montreal, selling graphic novels, prose literature, non-fiction, poetry and fine art book. In 2017, the store expanded and opened La Petite Librairie Drawn &amp; Quarterly, a children&#x27;s bookshop during the day and event space at night.
Over the years, Librairie D+Q has become one of the leading stores in Canada and North America. The store has hosted events with their own cartoonists such as Lynda Barry, Adrian Tomine, Chris Ware, Leanne Shapton, Seth, Chester Brown as well as novelists including Margaret Atwood, Neil Gaiman, Junot Diaz, Paul Auster, Sheila Heti, Miranda July, David Byrne, Gloria Steinem, Roxane Gay, Carrie Brownstein, Alison Bechdel and many more. 

==Showcase==
From 2003 to 2008, Drawn &amp; Quarterly published &quot;Showcase&quot;, an anthology magazine which offered greater visibility to lesser known authors. The magazine presented up to 3 authors in each of its five issues.

==Imprints==
In 2004, Drawn &amp; Quarterly began an imprint for non-comics art books called Petit Livre. The publisher also has an imprint for children called Enfant, with which they have published the Moomin works of Tove Jansson and Pippi Longstocking comics by Astrid Lindgren and Ingrid Vang Nyman, and contemporary kids books by Elise Gravel, Leanne Shapton and Anouk Ricard.

<doc id="1240480" wikidata="Q1139368" url="?curid=1240480" title="Toyota Sienna">
<text>The Toyota Sienna is a minivan manufactured and marketed by Toyota primarily for the North American market. It is named for the Italian city of Siena, in the region of Tuscany. It replaced the first generation Previa van in 1997 (for the 1998 model year) with a more conventional front-wheel drive layout and shares a heavily revised platform with the Camry. Both the Previa and original Sienna were smaller than the other minivans they competed against, but a redesign in 2003 (for the 2004 model year) increased the dimensions to match those of its competitors.

It was redesigned again in 2010 (for the 2011 model year). The third generation Sienna went on sale in the United States in February 2010 and is the first Sienna to ever receive a &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; award from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. A 2020 redesign (for the 2021 model year) saw the Sienna becoming a hybrid vehicle for its fourth generation. While previous generations of the Sienna were exported to select Asian and European markets, the fourth generation is the first to be produced outside of the United States as Chinese production commenced in July 2021 by two Toyota joint ventures. In China, it is also marketed as the Toyota Granvia.

Following the discontinuation of General Motors&#x27;s all-wheel drive minivans in 2006, the Sienna was the only minivan in its class offered with AWD in North America until the 2021 Chrysler Pacifica was introduced with an AWD option in 2020.

The Sienna is not available in Japan and Australia as it is not produced in a right-hand drive configuration, and the segment in these countries is already occupied by the Alphard/Vellfire and the HiAce/Granvia respectively.

As of the fourth generation, introduced in 2020, the Sienna is now built on Toyota&#x27;s TNGA-K platform, which it shares with most of Toyota’s other large MPVs and crossovers.


== First generation (XL10; 1997) ==

In 1997, Toyota launched the front-wheel drive 1998 model year Sienna in the North American market as a replacement for the mid-engined, rear-wheel-drive Previa. The Sienna debuted with a 3.0-liter &quot;1MZ-FE&quot; V6 engine rated at and of torque. Built on an extended platform of the XV20 Toyota Camry, the Sienna was appropriately marketed as the &quot;Camry of minivans,&quot; capitalizing on the Camry&#x27;s popularity and reputation.

It came in three trim levels: CE, LE, and XLE. The LE and XLE models were equipped with second row captain&#x27;s chairs while the CE models came equipped with a two-passenger bench seat in the second row. The seats may be folded and individually removed as needed. The driver side sliding door and roof rack were standard on the LE and XLE models, but were optional on the CE models. The XLE models offered leather seats and a wood trim package. The Sienna also touted best-in-class fuel economy of city driving and highway driving. It was built in Georgetown, Kentucky. A year after its release, the Sienna faced new competition from the redesigned Honda Odyssey minivan, which was larger and now offered a V6 like the Sienna.

This generation was noteworthy for its impressive safety content as one of the few minivans at the time to offer options including front seat-mounted side torso airbags and Vehicle Stability Control. Anti-lock braking was standard. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the Sienna &quot;Good&quot; in all six frontal crash test measures, which was far better than the Previa.

The reputation of this generation was marred by a class-action settlement for an engine oil sludge problem which affected the V6 engines in many Toyota models. Symptoms of the problem include oil smoke in the exhaust, oil quickly becoming dark or black after an oil change, gasoline odor in the oil, high oil consumption, and eventually engine failure.

=== Safety ===
===2000 facelift===
*2000 (for the 2001 model year): The Sienna underwent a facelift to both front and rear fascias adding a redesigned front grille and bumper. The facelift also included redesigned tail lights sporting a more modern appearance (with clear-lens turn signals as opposed to amber-colored) as well as a change in the look of the speedometer. Toyota also revamped the center console area to add more usability to the HVAC controls along with new locations for the accessory switches (rear vent, power sliding doors, and heated seats). The engine also came equipped with a variable valve timing feature VVT-i boosting output to and . The driver side sliding door became standard on all models, although the roof rack remained optional on the CE models.

== Second generation (XL20; 2003) ==

On 6 January 2003, the second-generation Sienna was unveiled at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Production was moved from the Georgetown plant to Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana.

Toyota assigned Yuji Yokoya as chief engineer on the new Sienna project. Yokoya and his family drove the previous model over throughout North America to find weaknesses from the design.

Changes from the first generation included 45% more volume overall and 39% more cargo space. The seats were in the 60/40 split configuration, and the flat-folding third row seat was offered even with all-wheel-drive. The engine was an updated ULEV certified 3.3-liter &quot;3MZ-FE&quot; V6 paired with a new five-speed automatic transmission. The gear stick was moved from the steering column to the center console and had a gated shift pattern. Seating for eight was optional on lower-level trims, and the third row seating was fold-flat, allowing the van to transport building materials like plywood and drywall sheets.

Trim levels, in order of increasing standard and available features were: CE, LE, XLE and XLE Limited (renamed Limited in later years). The most distinguishable difference on the XLE Limited model was the horizontal chrome bar placed above the rear license plate. The CE had a black trim there, while the LE and XLE had a body-colored trim.

Standard features included remote keyless entry, tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel, and high solar energy-absorbing glass (HSEA) on the windshield and front windows. All 2004–2007 Siennas had a factory tow package (hitch kit and trailer lighting connections not included) and a towing capacity.

All-wheel drive, optional on the more expensive trims included run-flat tires. The all-wheel drive system continuously divided engine power 50:50 front and rear.

Options, depending on the trim level, included HID Xenon headlamps, Dynamic Laser Cruise Control, parking sensors, a convex rear view mirror to enable the driver to see the passengers, a voice-activated navigation system (not voice activated for the 2004/2005 model year) which included a backup camera, 10-speaker JBL audio and rear-seat DVD entertainment system with two 110 V outlets.

Updated styling allowed for a . EPA Fuel economy was 17 mpg city driving and 23 mpg highway for the FWD version. The AWD version got 16 mpg city driving and 22 mpg highway driving. The turning radius was .

=== Safety ===
The Sienna came standard with anti-lock braking system, brake assist, electronic brakeforce distribution, traction control and a tire-pressure monitoring system. Side torso airbags and side curtain airbags were standard on certain 2004 and 2005 LE and XLE trims while optional on others, but became standard on all 2006 trims. Vehicle Stability Control initially optional on lower trims became standard for 2008 models.

The IIHS gives the Sienna an overall &quot;Good&quot; score in their frontal offset crash test with &quot;Good&quot; marks in all six measured categories. All 2006 models and later receive a &quot;Good&quot; overall score, while pre-2006 models without side airbags receive an &quot;Acceptable&quot; score for side impacts.

=== Model year changes ===
* 2006: the front fascia, side molding, headlamps and tail lights were restyled. Blue-backlit electroluminescent &quot;Optitron&quot; gauges were added to LE, XLE, and Limited trims. The &quot;XLE&quot; prefix in &quot;XLE Limited&quot; was removed, and new exclusive equipment for this trim included an optional memory function for the driver&#x27;s power seat and side-view mirrors (also available on XLE as an option) and power-folding exterior side-view mirrors with integrated in-glass LED turn-signal repeaters. Other options included Bluetooth and a power-folding third-row seat. Front row side torso airbags and side curtain airbags for all three rows became standard equipment on all models. The optional rear seat audio system was discontinued. Horsepower and torque ratings were changed to meet SAE&#x27;s new standard to and 222 lb·ft (from and , Toyota also now rates engines on 87 octane).
* 2007: a new ULEV-II certified 3.5-liter &quot;2GR-FE&quot; V6 engine rated at with a rated fuel economy of 17/23 MPG for front-wheel-drive models and 16/21 MPG for AWD models replaced the 3.3-liter V6. This engine had a lower-maintenance timing chain as opposed to the timing belt of previous Sienna engines. The tire pressure monitor was upgraded, and a new seven-spoke alloy wheel design was made exclusive to the Limited and AWD models. 
* 2008: Vehicle Stability Control became standard in all trims.
* 2009: the Sienna remained largely unchanged, except for a revision in pricing to become more competitive through several available comprehensively equipped &quot;extra-value package&quot; offerings. In Canada, base prices were lowered by up to $1,500. Rear power window switches were also modified to comply with new regulations against toggle window switches.
* 2010: the second generation Sienna was unchanged in its final model year.

== Third generation (XL30; 2010) ==

The redesigned Sienna premiered at the Los Angeles Auto Show in early December 2009 for the 2011 model year. It was designed at Calty studios and engineered at Toyota Technical Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan. The new Sienna arrived at dealers in February 2010. In November 2011, exports of the XL30 Sienna to South Korea began, making it the first Toyota minivan sold in the country. In July 2016, the Sienna was officially introduced to the Taiwanese market.

In the U.S., the third-generation Sienna was offered in five trim levels, a base grade, LE, XLE, Limited and for the first time the SE trim. The new SE offers revised bodywork, clear tail lamps, wheels, firmer suspension and revised steering tuning for a sportier ride. All-wheel-drive is only available with the V6 engine on the LE, XLE and Limited model trims. Described by AOL Autos as slipping a sports car in a minivan, chief engineer Kazuo Mori (an avid autocrosser) reportedly had to overcome opposition to get the SE equipment package included in the line-up.

The previous 3.5-liter &quot;2GR-FE&quot; continues, now coupled to a six-speed transmission, but for the first time the Sienna offers a four-cylinder engine, the &quot;1AR-FE&quot;. This is the first time Toyota has offered a four-cylinder engine in a North American minivan since discontinuation of the Estima/Previa in late 1997. An electric power steering (EPS) system replaces the previous hydraulic power steering system. Toyota continued to offer all-wheel drive in the Sienna. As GM discontinued its AWD minivans after the 2006 model year, it was the only North American minivan with an available AWD drivetrain until the 2021 Chrysler Pacifica went on sale in late 2020. Toyota published EPA-estimated mileage figures of city / highway for models powered by the 4-cylinder engine, city / highway for 2WD V6 models, and city / highway for AWD models. An optional tow package for V6 models is rated to tow .

The front dashboard features a &quot;swoop&quot; wood trim, inspired by the Toyota Venza and Lexus RX, that gives front seat occupants a &quot;60/60&quot; split whether in the driver or passenger seat.

New features included an optional sliding second row with &quot;Lounge Seating&quot; recliner style chairs, a feature previously seen on the Lexus LS, and Toyota&#x27;s keyless Smart Key System with push-button start. The rear seat entertainment option now uses a LCD screen which operates in two view modes, a single 16:9-ratio widescreen or two separate 4:3-ratio split screens with separate wireless headphones.

For safety the back-up camera comes with a new 180° panoramic view. Other new options include a Pre-Collision System (PCS) as well as an automatic highbeam dimmer, Safety Connect and a more advanced stability control system known as Vehicle Integrated Dynamics Management. A driver&#x27;s knee airbag is now standard as well.

When the second row seats are removed, the bottom of the second row seats, which is similar to a rack, remains attached to the van floor. This means that with second row seats removed, the floor is not flat.

Toyota is the first automaker to offer a factory installed auto-access seat for disabled people. The one-touch rotating, power ascending/descending lift-up seat can lower to within of the ground.

=== Yearly changes ===
* 2011, for the 2012 model year: Toyota&#x27;s new navigation system with Entune connected navigation system became available.
* 2012, for the 2013 model year: The four-cylinder engine was dropped.
* 2013, for the 2014 model year: The Sienna remained unchanged.
* 2014, for the 2015 model year: Minor refresh with new tail lights for all trim levels except the SE. In the interior, the dash was redesigned replacing the asymmetric swoop with a more conventional and cohesive center display. The previous small info window on top of the dash was also removed and placed in the center display. The center console was also redesigned. The entertainment system was updated to Blu-Ray with HDMI and SD card auxiliary input, from the earlier DVD with RCA jacks. Several technological upgrades could be optioned.

== Fourth generation (XL40; 2020) ==

Toyota announced the fourth-generation Sienna in May 2020 as a 2021 model, and appearing for sale near the end of 2020. It was originally intended to be revealed at the 2020 New York International Auto Show in April, but instead was unveiled virtually on 18 May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released on 27 October 2020 and hit the showrooms shortly after in November. It is built on GA-K platform. In a significant change, all grades of the Sienna came standard with a hybrid powertrain. Despite being hybrid only, Toyota claims that the fourth-generation Sienna can still tow the same capacity as the third-generation model.

The fourth-generation Sienna is offered in the returning LE, XLE and Limited trims, while receiving two additional trims: the sport-oriented XSE (replaced the SE trim), and the top-of-the-line Platinum trim. The Sienna is available with a built-in vacuum cleaner, refrigerated compartment (however, vacuum and refrigerator were later discontinued due to supplier issues), heads-up display, and 360° camera view on the Platinum trim level.

Standard and optional family oriented features for the Sienna include 18 cup holders, 7 USB ports (only one of which is data capable), four-zone climate control, onboard Wi-Fi, rear entertainment system, power sliding doors and liftgate, and a voice amplification system for the driver for better communications with passengers seated in the back. Standard driver-assistance features include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, automated emergency braking, and lane-keeping assist.

Starting in early 2021, the Sienna became available in Taiwan and in Mexico. In July 2021, the Sienna was launched in China where it is locally produced by GAC Toyota, while a rebadged variant bearing the Toyota Granvia () nameplate was produced by FAW Toyota. The Granvia adopted the styling of the North American Sienna XSE.

<doc id="1240486" wikidata="Q1025220" url="?curid=1240486" title="Cadillac SRX">
<text>The Cadillac SRX is a mid-size luxury SUV and compact luxury crossover SUV (CUV) manufactured and marketed by Cadillac over two generations: the first generation as a five-door, three-row, seven-passenger CUV (2003–2009), and the second generation as a five-door, two-row, five-passenger CUV (2010–2016) – the latter becoming Cadillac&#x27;s best selling model in the United States.


==First generation (2004)==

Engine options included the High-Feature V6 and the 4.6 L Northstar V8. It was based on the GM Sigma platform and came with a five or six-speed automatic transmission; rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive and MagneRide were available. As a Sigma platform vehicle, the first generation SRX had a longitudinally mounted front engine, longitudinal transmission mounted behind the engine, and a rear drive differential. The AWD option was implemented with a transfer case mounted to the rear of the transmission, with a propeller shaft forward to a front differential to power the front wheels.

An all-leather interior and curtain side airbags were standard in both models. Heated front seats and wood interior trim were standard in the V8 and available as options in the V6. DVD, sunroof, navigation system, and a power foldable third-row seat were all available options. However the third row was no longer available for the 2010 model year on the SRX.

The base price was US$38,880 for the V6 and US$45,880 for the V8 version.

The SRX won &quot;Car and Driver&#x27;s&quot; Five Best Trucks &quot;luxury SUV&quot; award for 2004, 2005 and 2006 and was nominated for the &quot;North American Truck of the Year&quot; award for 2004.

The first generation SRX never had the V Series performance model available.

The first generation SRX was available through the 2009 model year.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found the 2005-08 SRX worst in its class for driver fatalities with a death rate of 63 compared to its class average of 23.

=== 2005 changes ===
For the 2005 model year, Cadillac added chrome accents to the gauge cluster and made the towing package available on V6 models and V8 models. The towing capacity also grew to .

=== 2006 changes ===
For 2006, power tailgate and satellite radio became standard. New wheel designs were also added. New interior wood trim was added to the center stack and ride height was lowered slightly.

=== 2007 changes ===
For the 2007 model year, a new console was implemented, V8 models received six-speed automatic transmission, and base audio system was changed to Bose. A Sport package was added which included 20-inch wheels, all-wheel drive and limited slip differential. Other added options include Bose 5.1 digital surround sound, Theater package (which included Bose 5.1 digital surround sound, navigation and rear seat entertainment), automatic odor filtration, and Passenger Side Inflatable Restraint Suppression.

=== 2008 changes ===
The 2008 SRX received a new three-spoke steering wheel design.

=== 2009 changes ===
Adaptive Remote Start was added as a new option for the 2009 model year.

==Second generation (2010)==

The second generation SRX followed the Provoq concept presented at the 2008 Detroit NAIAS auto show, using a variation of the Epsilon II platform.

The production SRX debuted in January 2009 with the choice of a 3.0 liter V6 with direct injection derived from the 3.6 liter unit in the Cadillac CTS, or a 2.8 liter turbocharged V6. — and a base MSRP of $34,155. 

As it used the Epsilon platform, the second generation SRX drivetrain was a front transverse mounted V6 engine with a transverse mounted transaxle powering the front wheels. The AWD option was implemented with a power take-off output of the transaxle, and a propeller shaft to a rear differential to power the rear wheels.

2016 was the last model year for the SRX as Cadillac replaced it by the XT5 in the spring of 2016 as a 2017 model.

=== 2011 changes ===
For the 2011 model year, a rear backup camera and Cadillac Premium Care Maintenance program became standard and full keyless access became standard on Luxury and Performance models. In January 2011, General Motors discontinued production of the 2.8 liter turbo-charged V6 engine in the SRX, citing poor sales numbers. Less than 10 percent of SRX buyers opted for the turbo-charged engine. This left the naturally aspirated 3.0 liter V6 as the only engine available for the remainder of the 2011 model year.

=== 2012 changes ===
For 2012, a 3.6 liter V6 with E85 flex-fuel capability was offered in the turbo V6&#x27;s place. The six-speed transmission received an Eco feature for improved fuel economy. Other additions include Xenon Blue exterior color and ebony interior. Also, Bluetooth hands-free technology became standard on all trims and a heated steering wheel became available.

=== 2013 facelift ===
For the 2013 model year, all trim levels of the SRX receive an infotainment system marketed as the &quot;Cadillac User Experience&quot; (CUE) as well as new safety features and active noise cancellation technology. Additional interior features included standard HD radio, Bluetooth audio streaming, additional USB ports, SD card slot and 12-volt outlet, revised headphone and remote design for rear seat entertainment, and revised shift knob, steering wheel, and instrument cluster. The front styling and faux fender vents were revised. Three new colors: Evolution Green Metallic, Glacier Blue Metallic and Silver Coast Metallic were added, and wheels options were revised.

==== 2014 changes ====
For the 2014 model year, 18-inch chrome wheels were added to the Luxury trim and the Driver Awareness package received Intellibeam headlights. Exterior colors Graphite Metallic, Terra Mocha Metallic, and Sapphire Blue Metallic were added caramel and ebony interior accents became options.

==== 2015 changes ====
The 2015 SRX added 4G LTE connection and a standard Wi-Fi hotspot. Exterior colors Cocoa Bronze Metallic and Majestic Plum Metallic were added.

==== 2016 changes ====
For 2016, Cadillac removed the Majestic Plum Metallic color.

===Safety recall===
In May 2010, General Motors recalled about 550 of its 2010 Cadillac SRXs with the turbocharged 2.8-liter V-6 because of a possible engine failure if owners use regular gas and drove aggressively. The automaker said the fuel-filler lid and owner&#x27;s manual warn that the engine should not be worked hard if regular fuel is used. Failures in several vehicles owned by GM and one external user led it to discover that using regular fuel and driving hard could cause possible internal engine damage including connecting rod failures. The automaker decided to conduct a &quot;customer satisfaction program&quot; to recalibrate the engine computer, but the NHTSA considered engine failures to be a safety issue and argued that a recall was required. The 2.8 liter V6 was permanently removed from production after the 2010 model year due to safety recalls and poor sales. 3.0L V6 was the only engine option available for the 2011 model year. The 3.0L V6 was replaced by a 3.6L V6 engine for the 2012 model year as the only engine option available.

<text>A Portuguese Guyanese is a Guyanese whose ancestors came from Portugal or a Portuguese who has Guyanese citizenship. Around 1,910 people identified as Portuguese Guyanese according to the 2012 census

== Demographics ==
People of Portuguese descent were mainly introduced to Guyana as indentured labourers to make up for the exodus of former slaves who left the sugar plantations upon emancipation. The first groups arrived in 1835 until 1882, most having arrived by the 1860s. Most Portuguese trace their ancestry to the North Atlantic island of Madeira, which already had a long history of sugar production, but was beset with economic depression and political issues.

Those who stayed on after their indenture made up a Guyanese middle class, and were an important part of the commercial sector. The rum industry was predominantly owned by Portuguese Guyanese.

Portuguese of Guyana support Roman Catholic churches, schools, and maintain their language through periodicals such as &quot;A Voz do Português&quot;, &quot;A Liberdade&quot;, &quot;O Lusitano&quot;, &quot;Chronica Semanal&quot; and &quot;The Watchman&quot;.

In 1906, the first Portuguese Guyanese ran for public office. There is a &#x27;Portuguese Arrival Day&#x27; on May 3 to mark the first arrival to Guyana.

Some have advanced the idea that the Portuguese presence in the Guianas predates 1834. Portuguese Sephardic Jews had settled in neighbouring Dutch Guiana in the 17th century before the Dutch arrived. Portuguese Jewish communities also exist in Aruba, Barbados, and Curaçao. Some of the Portuguese in Guyana may have their origins in these Dutch-speaking Portuguese groups. They were known as the &quot;Curaçao Portuguese&quot; within the larger Portuguese community.

The number of Portuguese Guyanese (4.3% of the population in 1891) has been declining constantly over the decades. Many Portuguese Guyanese have since emigrated onward and now live in London, Toronto, other parts of the Caribbean and the United States. 

The general success of this group also led to animosity such as the 1856 ‘Angel Gabriel’ Riots in which Portuguese shops were looted and damaged. Even though being of European ancestry, they are viewed as a distinct from British Europeans for their language, religion, and former-indentured status. 

== Notable Portuguese Guyanese==
*Ivor Mendonca – Cricketer for the West Indies
*Peter D&#x27;Aguiar – Businessman and conservative politician

<doc id="1240496" wikidata="Q6925233" url="?curid=1240496" title="Mountain State University">
<text>Mountain State University (MSU) was a private university in Beckley, West Virginia. It closed in 2013. It was formerly named Beckley College and then The College of West Virginia.

Its Beckley campus is now occupied by West Virginia University Institute of Technology. Its other campus in Martinsburg, West Virginia was sold to a private developer.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The university was founded in 1933 as Beckley College, a junior college, and continued as such until 1991, when it achieved four-year status and was renamed The College of West Virginia. In 2001, the school was renamed Mountain State University.

=== Later history ===
Mountain State University&#x27;s former president since 1990, Charles H. Polk, was widely credited for much of the school&#x27;s previous success. However, many blamed Polk along with his senior administration and MSU&#x27;s board of trustees when the university began facing issues over its continued accreditation. Polk and MSU&#x27;s board of trustees were named as defendants in over 300 lawsuits arising out of the loss of the university&#x27;s accreditation. A settlement was reached under which MSU admitted no wrongdoing.

In 2009, Polk received over $1.8 million in compensation. According to &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, Polk was the sixth-highest-paid private-college president in the country that year. However, according to Jerry Ice, then-chairman of the Mountain State University Board of Trustees, Polk’s actual 2009 salary was $450,000, and included a one-time deferred retirement package that the board established in 2004 and was required to pay out in 2009. As a means of recouping the funds for MSU, the board also purchased a $2 million insurance policy on Polk that will be paid back to the institution upon his death.

On January 19, 2012, Jerry Ice, former chairman of Mountain State University&#x27;s board of trustees, announced the termination of Polk&#x27;s employment as president of Mountain State University. Richard E. Sours was chosen to replace Polk as interim president until the university&#x27;s closing.

=== Loss of accreditation ===
On June 28, 2012, the Higher Learning Commission, the regional accrediting authority for the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, withdrew the accreditation of Mountain State University, effective August 27, 2012. The date was subsequently extended until December 31, 2012, to allow the university to &quot;teach out&quot; those students close to graduation.

On August 6, 2012, MSU&#x27;s board of trustees formally appealed the withdrawal of MSU&#x27;s accreditation with the Higher Learning Commission. On December 18, 2012, the appeals panel voted to sustain the commission&#x27;s action. MSU&#x27;s regional accreditation was terminated on December 31, 2012. All degrees conferred by MSU on or before this date are valid and are accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. MSU closed effective January 1, 2013.

In May 2014, the Mountain State University Board of Trustees filed a lawsuit against the Higher Learning Commission seeking to restore the university&#x27;s accreditation. In 2017, the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted the Higher Learning Commission&#x27;s motion for summary judgment, effectively ending MSU&#x27;s lawsuit in favor of the Higher Learning Commission.

On August 13, 2014, UC announced that a settlement had been reached between itself, MSU, and the plaintiffs in various lawsuits arising out of the loss of MSU&#x27;s accreditation. MSU&#x27;s insurance company established an $8.5 million fund to compensate affected students and MSU liquidated its remaining assets. The settlement was given preliminary court approval on October 6, 2014. Final court approval was given on March 9, 2015. MSU&#x27;s former Beckley campus was sold to West Virginia University. MSU ceased to exist as a legal entity on May 17, 2018.

The University of Charleston is the permanent custodian of MSU&#x27;s student records. Transcripts from Beckley College, The College of West Virginia and Mountain State University may be purchased through the National Student Clearinghouse.

=== Reuse of campuses ===
On August 1, 2012, the University of Charleston (UC) announced that they would assist MSU in the &#x27;teach-out&#x27; process, and would admit any MSU student in good standing who chose to attend UC. UC also announced that it would establish new four-year campuses on the Beckley and Martinsburg sites, to be known as the University of Charleston-Beckley and University of Charleston-Martinsburg, respectively.

The University of Charleston established campuses on MSU&#x27;s former Beckley and Martinsburg, West Virginia locations on January 1, 2013. UC later vacated the former Martinsburg campus (the property was sold to a third-party buyer), and established a new location in Martinsburg.

UC vacated the former Beckley campus after the 2014-15 academic year and established a new campus in Beckley. On December 31, 2014, West Virginia University announced that it would purchase MSU’s former Beckley campus for $8 million. On September 1, 2015, the WVU board of governors approved a plan to move the West Virginia University Institute of Technology from its then-current campus in Montgomery to the former MSU campus in Beckley.

== Academics ==
The university offered more than 60 undergraduate, master&#x27;s, and certificate programs, as well as a doctoral degree program. Most of the university&#x27;s programs focused on the professions in business, technology, and health and human services. Many of MSU&#x27;s degree programs were available online.

=== College preparatory school ===
From 2002 to 2010, Mountain State University operated a private, nonsectarian college preparatory school from grades K–12 known as the Academy at Mountain State University, or Mountain State Academy (MSA), in Beckley, West Virginia. The school was also occasionally referred to as &quot;MSU Academy&quot;.

Although founded in 2002, MSA classes first began during the 2003–2004 academic year with grades 8–10. During the 2004–2005 academic year, the academy eliminated its eighth grade class, but added an eleventh grade class to accommodate advancing sophomores. During the 2005–2006 academic year, the academy became a full-fledged high school, adding a twelfth grade to accommodate advancing juniors. The class of 2006 became the academy&#x27;s first graduating class. Members of the class of 2007 were the first students to attend the academy for all four of their respective high school years. The school later added grades 6–8 and eventually grades K–6. The class of 2010 was the academy&#x27;s last graduating class.

MSA students were permitted to take classes at MSU for both weighted academy and college credit free of charge (less the cost of MSU textbooks). Admission to the academy was based on a student&#x27;s scholastic merit. The cost of attending the academy was originally approximately $8,000.00 per academic year, plus the cost of textbooks and meals at MSU. However, the academy later adopted a sliding scale for tuition based on a student&#x27;s household income. All students with a 3.5 cumulative GPA or above were designated as honor graduates. The academy also hosted a chapter of The National Honor Society. MSA students were required to attend the academy for at least three years in order to be considered for the titles of valedictorian, salutatorian, or honorarian.

The academy was permanently closed in August 2010. Enrollment stood at approximately 100 students at the school&#x27;s closing. The academy&#x27;s basketball team, which was nicknamed the Falcons, defeated nationally ranked Oak Hill Academy in 2010.

== Athletics ==
The Mountain State athletic teams were called the Cougars. The university was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (KIAC; now currently known as the River States Conference (RSC) since the 2016–17 school year) from 2007–08 to 2011–12 (all sports excluding men&#x27;s basketball, which only competed as an NAIA Independent during that tenure until a few seasons after [2009–10]). The Cougars previously competed in the defunct West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) (then affiliated with the NAIA, later affiliated in the Division II ranks of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA)) from 1946–47 to 1976–77.

Mountain State competed in nine intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports included basketball, cross country, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports included cheerleading, cross country, soccer, track &amp; field and volleyball.

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===
Mountain State won the 2004 NAIA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. Mountain State was the national runner-up in the 2003 NAIA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. Additionally, the Cougars were the national runner-up in the 2008 NAIA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament and in the 2011 NAIA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. MSU advanced to the final four in 2012.

<text>Jean Maillard (c. 1515 – after 1570) was a French composer of the Renaissance.

While little is known with certainty about his life, he may have been associated with the French royal court, since he wrote at least one motet for them. Most likely he lived and worked in Paris, based on evidence of his print editions, which were prepared there. Since later in his career he set verse by Huguenot poet Guillaume Guéroult, as well as Clément Marot, he may have either become a Protestant or had Protestant sympathies; this could explain his disappearance from Paris around 1570. If he did leave the city then, his destination is unknown. No record of him after that year has been found.

Maillard is mentioned by Rabelais in &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, and also by Ronsard in his &quot;Livre des Mélanges&quot; (1560 and 1572). He was evidently famous during his time, and many of his motets were used as source material for parody masses by composers as distinguished as Palestrina; in addition Lassus reworked some of his music. Claude Goudimel also used a secular chanson of Maillard&#x27;s as source material for a mass.

Six of Maillard&#x27;s masses have survived, and two others are known to have been lost. Considerable other music of his has survived in printed editions, including eighty-six motets, settings of the &quot;Magnificat,&quot; lamentations, &quot;chansons spirituelles&quot;, and secular chansons. Stylistically, his sacred music is more closely related to the contemporary Franco-Flemish idiom of pervasive, dense, complex polyphony than to the relatively clear and succinct style of his fellow French composers. In particular, he used short motifs in close imitation, and often used strict canonic devices. About half of his motets are for four voices; the rest are for five or six, with one motet for seven voices. Many of his motets have the cantus firmus in long note values in the highest voice, while the other voices carry on in a polyphonic, imitative texture.

His &quot;Missa pro mortuis&quot; was an early Requiem mass setting, and one of the only examples from France in the 16th century.

Unlike his sacred music, his secular music was in the prevailing popular idiom of the 1540s.

==Modern editions==

Maillard&#x27;s sacred works are being edited for publication by Raymond H. Rosenstock. His editions of motets already published several years ago by A-R Editions in the USA provide useful further information and authoritative modern transcriptions; he has also edited Maillard&#x27;s masses, published by The Institute of Mediaeval Music in Canada.

<text>The Chrysler PT Cruiser is a compact car that was built by the American company Chrysler from 2001 until 2010. Introduced as a five-door hatchback wagon, a two-door convertible variant was also made from 2005 until 2008.

Originally planned as a Plymouth model, the PT Cruiser was ultimately marketed as a Chrysler when Plymouth was discontinued. Intended to invoke 1930s aesthetics, the exterior of the PT Cruiser was designed by Bryan Nesbitt. The model received an intermediate facelift for the 2006 model year. Interior packaging was noted for its high roof, high h-point seating, and flexible cargo and passenger configurations enabled by a multi-level rear cargo shelf and rear seats a user could fold, tumble, or remove.

The PT Cruiser was produced in Mexico and Austria at the Toluca Car Assembly and Eurostar Automobilwerk factories. By the end of production in July 2010, worldwide production had reached 1.35 million.

In its nameplate, &quot;PT&quot; stands for &quot;Personal Transport&quot; or &quot;Personal Transportation&quot;. &quot;PT&quot; was the PT Cruiser&#x27;s product code for the Mexican-made units.

== Overview ==

The PT Cruiser is a front-wheel drive 5-passenger vehicle, classified as a truck in the US by the NHTSA for CAFE fuel economy calculations but as a car by most other metrics. Chrysler specifically designed the PT Cruiser to fit the NHTSA criteria for a light truck to bring the average fuel efficiency of the company&#x27;s truck fleet into compliance with CAFE standards. A turbocharged GT model was introduced for the 2003 model year. A convertible was introduced for the 2005 model year.

The cars were manufactured at Toluca Car Assembly in Toluca, Mexico. On March 8, 2006, DaimlerChrysler announced that 1,000,000 PT Cruisers had been built. The final PT Cruiser was built on July 9, 2010. A total of 1,050,281 PT Cruisers were marketed in the United States.

The PT Cruiser was also assembled at the Eurostar Automobilwerk in Graz, Austria, for markets outside North America, using the production code PG, for the model year 2002. European PT Cruisers built in 2001 or from 2003 on were manufactured in Mexico under the PT production code. The US version used a 2.4 L four-cylinder gasoline engine. In addition to this standard model, a 2.2 L four-cylinder diesel engine built by Mercedes-Benz was also available in Europe, Asia, and South Africa. A 2.0 L engine (D4RE) was also available outside the US. It produced SAE at 6500 rpm with of torque at 4800 rpm.

In July 2000, the PT Cruiser replaced the Neon in Japan as their small car offering. Chrysler sold over 10,000 PT Cruisers in Japan. The five-door hatchback, two-door convertible, and GT turbo engine package were sold in Japan in right-hand drive configurations. Japanese versions were manufactured at the Austrian factory and were equipped similarly to European specifications. From 2002 until 2007, the PT Cruiser was used in the city of Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture by the Maihama Resort Cab company to serve as a taxi in the vicinity of Tokyo Disneyland because of its fun, retro appearance. The PT Cruiser taxis augmented the Maihama Resort Line service to Tokyo Disneyland. The ten Chrysler PT Cruisers were to help customers &quot;hold on to that lingering Disney feeling all the way home.&quot; The cars were offered in Japan until April 2010, when it was replaced by the Dodge Caliber. 
The PT Cruiser arrived in Australia in mid-2000 and came in only three specification levels: Grand Tourer, Limited, and Touring. Until 2006, the only choice of engine was the 2.0 L. The cabrio was introduced to Australia in 2006. From 2006, all models, including the new cabrio, received the 2.4 L I4 engine coupled to a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual. Sales were never spectacular, and the car&#x27;s reputation for lackluster performance turned buyers to the competition. Sales sharply declined following the facelift despite the newer models having a more powerful engine. Between 2000 and 2009, total sales for Australia were 7,000.

In 2001 &quot;Motor Trend&quot; named the PT Cruiser as its Car of the Year and &quot;Car and Driver&quot; put it on its Ten Best list. the PT Cruiser also won the North American Car of the Year. The PT Cruiser also won the North American Car of the Year, based on a solid majority of top automotive journalists charged with &quot;picking a vehicle that has set new standards or benchmarks in its class while considering aspects such as general design, safety, fuel economy, handling, general roadworthiness, performance, functionality, technical innovation, driver satisfaction and price.&quot;

== Design ==
The PT Cruiser was part of the nostalgia wave that included models such as the Volkswagen New Beetle and the Mini Cooper. Rather than recalling previous namesake models, the PT Cruiser recalled the 1930s and 1940s styling, influenced by the Chrysler Airflow.

The 2000 PT Cruiser grew out of a collaboration with Robert A. Lutz, who was an executive at Chrysler at the time, Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, and Bryan Nesbitt. Nesbitt later went on to design the Chevrolet HHR.

The PT Cruiser&#x27;s design was loosely inspired by the Chrysler Pronto Cruizer concept car while recalling the Chrysler and Desoto Airflow. Aspects of the PT Cruiser&#x27;s rear styling also resembled the Chrysler CCV, a retro-styled compact vehicle recalling the Citroen 2CV, while its high roof evoked the Chevrolet Advance Design trucks.

On launch, the PT Cruiser was described as a market segment-buster. Chrysler&#x27;s Dieter Zetsche characterized it as a continuing example of the automaker&#x27;s innovation for new segments, demonstrating &quot;you can have head-turning style, practicality, and value all in one package.&quot;

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; described the design as &quot;highly distinctive, appeals to a broad segment of the public, and is characteristically American.&quot; The public&#x27;s reaction to the PT Cruiser was polarized, but inspired a solid following among owners. Overall, the car &quot;was a valuable vehicle for many consumers.&quot;

== Updates ==

PT Cruiser models included the Classic edition, Limited edition, Touring edition, Couture edition (2010 only), &quot;Dream Cruiser,&quot; &quot;Street Cruiser,&quot; &quot;Pacific Coast Highway&quot; edition,&quot; and PT Cruiser GT. The non-GT Turbo () edition models (introduced in 2004) were identified by a &quot;2.4L Turbo&quot; badge on the lower right-hand corner of the rear lift-gate. The GT model (introduced in 2003) has a &quot;2.4L Turbo High Output&quot; badge on the right-hand corner of the lift-gate indicating the 215–230 hp engine version.

Updates for 2006 included scalloped headlights, a revised grille no longer extending below the &quot;bumper,&quot; a new lower front fascia that eliminated the patented brake cooling ducts, redesigned taillights, and available round fog lamps. The changes reduced the &quot;retro vibe&quot; that did not satisfy some customers and &quot; exposed the main pitfall of retro design: How do you update old?&quot;

Interior updates included a revised interior with an updated dash with an analog clock in the center stack. The audio system featured a line-in jack for MP3 players integrated into the dash. Features such as satellite radio, a premium sound system by Boston Acoustics with external amplifier and subwoofer, and UConnect hands-free Bluetooth for compatible cell phones also became available in 2006. The standard audio system now included an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player and a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack with six speakers, replacing a cassette player and four speakers. The turbocharged 2.4 L I4 was available in or &quot;High-Output&quot; versions. A &quot;Mopar&quot; cruise control unit became available as an aftermarket unit on 2007 models. Also, in 2007, Chrysler dealers were permitted to order vehicles with separate options (unbundled options from option packages) such as anti-lock brakes and Side Impact Airbags. Sirius Satellite Radio also became an option that could be installed as a dealer option with a factory appearance (i.e., roof mount satellite antenna).

Original plans called for the PT Cruiser to receive a complete redesign for 2007, but that was pushed back. Little was changed as Chrysler was sorting out powertrains, styling, and even positioning as a luxury compact SUV. The convertible and the High Output engine were discontinued for the 2008 model year and sales dropped as information spread that Chrysler was going to discontinue the PT Cruiser shortly.

For 2010, the last year of production, one trim level, the PT Cruiser Classic, was offered. It included a 2.4 L I4 engine producing , standard four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, auxiliary audio input jack and six speakers, rear-mounted spoiler, air conditioning, cruise control, tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), front and rear side SRS airbags, keyless entry with two remotes and panic alarm, ABS anti-lock brakes, and sixteen-inch alloy wheels. Optional features included leather seating surfaces, a power front driver&#x27;s bucket seat, an engine block heater, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and heated dual front bucket seats. Exterior color options were Bright Silver Metallic, Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat, Deep Water Blue Pearl Coat, Inferno Red Crystal Tinted Pearl Coat, Silver Steel Metallic, and Stone White Clear Coat. The only interior color option was Pastel Slate Gray.

== Safety ==
In 2002, Euro NCAP gave the PT Cruiser a three (out of five) stars rating. The car received bad results in the frontal impact test (6 out of 16 possible points). The height of the seats and side airbags helped to attain a maximum score of 16 points in the side impact test. The low frontal scores are partly explained by the cushioning near the knees, designed to protect unbelted occupants, which is not a factor in the EU where passengers must wear seat belts.

For 2008, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the PT Cruiser the highest rating of &quot;Good&quot; overall for occupant protection in frontal crashes and the lowest overall rating of &quot;Poor&quot; for side crashes. It was the only small car to not offer electronic stability control.

<text>SaveRite was a U.S. chain of discount grocery stores owned by Winn-Dixie. The store offered a smaller selection and less customer support than most grocery stores.

The chain&#x27;s marketing was based on its mascot Captain SaveRite, who is shown as a cartoon super-hero resembling Captain America.

Winn-Dixie created the SaveRite brand as an experiment to increase its revenues and opened 11 stores throughout its distribution area. In November 2001, Winn-Dixie announced plans to convert nearly all of its 40-some Winn-Dixie and Winn-Dixie Marketplace brand stores in the metro Atlanta area into SaveRites as a last-ditch effort to keep a hold on its market share, which was rapidly declining due to stiff competition from Wal-Mart, Publix, Kroger, Ingles, Food Lion, and other similar stores.

However, in 2005, SaveRite pulled out of the Atlanta area due to Winn-Dixie&#x27;s decision to close 386 stores. Prior to cuts in February 2006, the only known states that had at least one SaveRite were Mississippi, Florida, and Ohio, most notably in the Orlando metro area and in the Meridian, Mississippi area. On February 28, 2006, Winn Dixie announced that it would close about 11 additional SaveRite stores in Central Florida.

On August 18, 2011, Winn Dixie announced it was converting the six remaining SaveRite locations to the Winn-Dixie banner. The conversion from SaveRite to Winn-Dixie was to take about four months, during which time the stores would remain open. All the SaveRite employees were to continue working for Winn-Dixie.

<text>Camp Leroy Johnson in New Orleans, Louisiana, was located on the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain in the area bounded west by Franklin Avenue, and east by Inner Harbor Navigation Canal. The camp was opened in 1942 as the New Orleans Army Air Base. The site was across the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal from the New Orleans Municipal Airport. In 1947 a formal ceremony was held at the New Orleans Port of Embarkation Personnel Center to rename the base after World War II Medal of Honor recipient Leroy Johnson. After 22 years of service the camp was closed on July 1, 1964, &quot;for economic reasons&quot;.

Johnson was a native of Caney Creek near Oakdale, Louisiana, and served as a Sergeant, U.S. Army. He died on December 15, 1944, near Limon, Leyte, Philippine Islands, shortly after he threw himself on two unexploded Japanese grenades during an assault thus saving two comrades.

Portions of the original property retain military function with the James H. Diamond United States Army Reserve Center located on Leroy Johnson, Drive. The original site also houses the Federal Bureau of Investigation New Orleans Field Office, a portion of the Southern University of New Orleans campus, and the University of New Orleans East Campus including the Lakefront Arena. In 1987 portions of the former camp hosted 130,000 people as part of a pastoral visit by Pope John Paul II. Camp Leroy Johnson is sometimes confused with the original New Orleans Naval Air Station which was located further to the west at the site of the current main campus of the University of New Orleans.

<text>Jędrzej Giertych (7 January 1903 – 9 October 1992) was a Polish right-wing politician, journalist and writer.

== Biography ==
Jędrzej Giertych was born in Sosnowiec on 7 January 1903, the son of Franciszek Giertych (1868–1938), an engineer. He had seven daughters and two sons: the Polish politician Maciej Giertych and the Catholic theologian and Vatican official Wojciech Giertych. Among his 29 grandchildren is the Polish politician Roman Giertych. 

During World War I he attended for a time a German-language Lutheran school in Tallinn, Estonia, then part of the Russian Empire, where his father was deputy manager of a shipyard. His family later moved to Petrograd where they experienced the Russian Revolution, returning to Poland in 1918 after the treaty of Brest-Litovsk.
He was injured at the Battle of Warsaw in 1920 and then became war correspondent during the Spanish Civil War, supportive of the Nationalists, especially of the Carlists. His reports were later published in book form, &quot;Hiszpania bohaterska&quot; (Heroic Spain).

Active politically mainly in the interwar period, Giertych was an ally of Roman Dmowski and a prominent activist of the National Democracy right-wing political camp, mainly the National Party. He was a member of the Central Committee of the party and was elected to be a member of the Warsaw City Council. Giertych support anti-Jewish boycotts, point out that the boycott in Odrzywol in 1935 led to the liquidation of all the Jewish market stalls and their replacement by 200 Polish stalls.

During World War II he was mobilised into the Polish Navy. His unit was soon encircled in the course of the battle for the Hel Peninsula, but he surrendered only on 2 October 1939 and was captured by Germans. He was the first Polish &#x27;incorrigible escaper&#x27; to be imprisoned in the Colditz POW camp Oflag IVC. Moved with the Colditz Polish contingent to Oflag VI-B at Dossel, he was one of the survivors when on 27 September 1944 a British bomb carried by a Mosquito aircraft of No. 139 Squadron RAF, aimed at nearby Kassel, hit the camp in error and killed 90 Polish prisoners. His sister was a member of the Home Army and was wounded during the Warsaw Uprising.

After the war he exiled himself to England, together with his family. During communist rule in Poland, Giertych lived in London, working as a school-teacher. He died in London on 9 October 1992.

== Political views ==
Giertych spent his political life aiming to build a Poland made up of nationalist traditionalist Catholic citizens ready to sacrifice their life for what he called the &quot;greater good of Poland&quot;. Giertych represented the radical &quot;youth faction&quot; of the National Party. They were sceptic as to the need of the parliamentary system, aiming to change the political system of Poland. In 1938 he observed: &quot;We [young faction] rather grew up as a reaction against the spirit of the 19th century, whose most classic effects were socialism, liberalism, parliamentarism.&quot; As to the goals of the &quot;young faction&quot; and the relations with fascism and Nazism, Giertych remarked: &quot;We observe very carefully fascism, hitlerism and other foreign national movements, because we think we can learn a lot from them. We try to learn from their experience, use their lucky ideas, take all positive what they created. Our goal is to take the power in Poland.&quot;

The Jewish-run Anti-Defamation League describes Jędrzej Giertych as having been &quot;notorious for his obsessive anti-Semitism and open
admiration of fascism&quot;. 

After the 1956 events, Giertych belonged to the emigres who voiced support for Gomułka. While living in exile in London, Giertych was expelled from the emigre National Party because of his extremism and antisemitism. He also strongly criticised the Workers&#x27; Defence Committee (KOR). While the Catholic church considered converts equally, Giertych advocated for restrictions based on a racial approach saying that &quot;baptism can turn a Jew only into a Christian, not into a Pole, and such converts ought to be restricted in their rights just like their Jewish brethren&quot;.

Giertych also held imperialist views. In a series of newspaper articles of 1939 he suggested that &quot;in the upcoming war&quot; Poland ought to annex parts of East Germany (&quot;the city of Danzig, East Prussia, upper and central Silesia, including the city of Breslau, and central Pomerania, including Kolberg&quot;); moreover, Poland ought to create &quot;a bunch of buffer states&quot; between the rest of Germany and Poland along the rivers Oder and Neisse.

<text>The Toyota Previa, also known as the in Japan, and Toyota Tarago in Australia, is a minivan that was produced by Toyota from 1990 until October 2019 across three generations.

The name &quot;Previa&quot; is derived from the Spanish for &quot;preview&quot;, as Toyota saw the first Previa as a vehicle that would preview technologies used in future minivans. The Previa was the second largest minivan in Toyota&#x27;s lineup in Japan after the bigger and more luxurious Alphard/Vellfire.


== First generation (XR10/XR20; 1990) ==

The first generation, designed by Toyota designer Tokuo Fukuichi and Calty designer David Doyle in 1987 (patent filed 24 December 1987), was introduced on 27 January 1990, and had only one sliding side door for the rear passengers. It featured a mid-engined platform, where the inline-four cylinder gasoline-powered engine was installed almost flat beneath the front seats, canted at a 75-degree angle from vertical to the right, viewed from the rear of the vehicle. This allowed the designers to maximize interior space for a given exterior size.

The vehicle was sold in Japan as the Toyota Estima, taken from the word &quot;estimable.&quot; In the United States and United Kingdom, it was marketed as the Previa, which is derived from the Italian &quot;previdenza&quot;, meaning providence or foresight.

The first generation Previa is long, wide, and high (with the dual moonroof option), riding on a wheelbase of . It was available in both rear- and all-wheel drive versions (branded All-Trac) and powered by a JIS inline four-cylinder 2.4-liter fuel-injected mid-mounted engine. All-wheel drive models use a viscous-coupled center differential which normally splits torque 50/50 from front to rear. Available with a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual gearbox, this Previa also seated seven or eight people, with three seating configurations offered; however, North America only received two configurations, both seating seven passengers. All first-generation Previa / Estima vans were assembled at the Toyota Auto Body Fujimatsu plant in Kariya, Aichi.

The Previa was available with either four-wheel disc brakes or traditional front disc/rear drum brake setup, with anti-lock brakes (ABS) as an option. Some rear-drive models use independent suspension at all four wheels, with Macpherson struts at the front and double-wishbones in the rear; most models are equipped with a rear suspension which uses a beam axle located by a four-link arrangement with Panhard rod. A lower-cost eight-passenger model, introduced in February 1993, uses the AWD rear suspension.

===Design===
==== Powertrain ====
The Previa / Estima was equipped with a 2.4 L &quot;2TZ-FE&quot; I4 engine with a nominal output of at 5000 rpm and at 4000 rpm. Base models were equipped with a five-speed manual transmission, a four-speed automatic transmission was available as an option; higher trim levels came with the automatic as standard. For the 1994 model year, the 2.4 L &quot;2TZ-FZE&quot; supercharged engine was made available. The supercharger was mounted in the front of the vehicle, driven by a belt off the SADS accessory driveshaft, and engine output increased to at 5000 rpm and at 3600 rpm. In the United States, the five-speed manual transmission was discontinued starting with the 1994 model year.

In Japan, the Estima Lucida and Estima Emina also were available with the &quot;3C-T&quot; intercooled turbodiesel I4 engine.

With either engine, all of the engine-driven accessories, such as the alternator, power steering pump, air conditioning compressor and radiator fan, are accessible from the front hood and are driven by an accessory driveshaft extending forward from the front of the engine, which was named &quot;Supplemental Accessory Drive System&quot; (SADS). A two-liter oil reservoir is also located underneath the hood. Placing these items in front allowed the designers to achieve a nearly-equal front/rear weight distribution, which benefits ride quality and handling. However, it also prevented the installation of a larger engine, and meant that the design and development costs could not be mitigated by sharing the platform with other vehicles. The mid-engine configuration requires the removal of the front right seat, the carpet and an access panel to provide access to the spark plugs.

Fuel efficiency with the naturally aspirated &quot;2TZ-FE&quot; engine is below average at for estimated combined city/highway driving; the small four-cylinder engine needs to work a bit harder owing to the power to weight ratio of the vehicle, compared to contemporary 6-cylinder engines. In instrumented testing, a rear-drive Previa with the naturally-aspirated engine recorded overall. With all-wheel drive and the automatic, observed fuel consumption increased to .

The supercharged &quot;2TZ-FZE&quot; engine is different from the normally aspirated engine, owing to a slight decrease in compression ratio and stronger engine internals. The supercharger is sourced from Aisin and engaged on-demand by an electromagnetic clutch, based on input from the engine control unit. The supercharged engine has improved power and gives slightly better fuel consumption, estimated at on the combined city/highway cycle.

==== Styling &amp; interior ====
All configurations have a driver and front passenger seat forward, and a three-seat bench seat at the rear that splits and folds flat against the sides of the cabin. The eight-seat configuration contains a 2/1 split swiveling bench seat in the middle row, while the seven-seat configurations contain either two independently swiveling captain&#x27;s chairs (referred to as &quot;Quad Seating&quot;), in the middle row or a two-seat bench offset towards the driver&#x27;s side. The third row is better upholstered in the seven-seat version.

The center console is pushed backwards towards the front seat passengers, with contemporary press coverage calling it &quot;pregnant&quot;. The stereo was singled out for praise during a long-term test review conducted by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;.

* The Previa gives a practically panoramic view, excluding the pillars behind the front doors. This has the side effect of effectively turning the van into a greenhouse, causing it to accumulate heat in a short period of time. Solar control glass later became an option to help alleviate the problem.

An option for dual moonroofs was provided. This included a power horizontal-sliding glass moonroof above the middle row of passengers, measuring , and a pop-up glass moonroof above the front seats. The overall height of Previas equipped with moonroofs is increased by so the interior headroom is not reduced.

Previas are affectionately called &quot;eggvans&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot; or &quot;beans&quot;, because of their shape. In Australia, they have been referred to as &quot;Wombats&quot;, because they somewhat resemble the marsupial of the same name. In New Zealand, they are very popular with freedom campers and are referred to as &quot;Bucky&quot; buses.

=== Safety ===

The Previa was the first minivan to meet all US safety standards for passenger cars for the 1992 model year, which included fitment of a driver&#x27;s-side airbag, under-dash knee bolsters, and a center high-mounted stop light.

When the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tested a 1996 model Previa in the moderate overlap front crash test, it revealed many safety issues: the cabin structure was unstable, the steering wheel moved upward all the way to the windshield causing violent head movement, the lap belt tore which allowed the dummy to end up in a partially reclining position, and there were high forces on both of the lower legs. It was given a &quot;Poor&quot; rating as a result.

===Global variations===
In some countries (mainly Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom), unsold Estimas and Lucidas were re-badged as 1995/1996 Previas.

==== Japan ====
In Japan, two smaller versions, the Toyota Estima Lucida and Toyota Estima Emina, were produced from January 1992, each of which were approximately narrower and shorter than the standard model. The original design continued to be sold in Japan, but became known as the &quot;wide-body&quot; Estima.

The reason that the smaller Emina and Lucida models were developed is the vehicle tax system in Japan, which is based on the product of the length and width of the car; the smaller variants fall into a lower tax band. The Estima Emina and Estima Lucida were also available with a 2.2-liter diesel engine (3C-T and 3C-TE). In Japan, the Estima and Estima Emina were exclusive to the dealerships called &quot;Toyota Store&quot;. The Estima Lucida sold at &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; dealerships. The two received small redesigns in 1994 and a facelift in 1996.

==== United States ====

In the United States, the Previa was sold from March 1990 (for the 1991 model year) until 1997. It was imported from Japan to compete with Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s successful Dodge Caravan minivan, and its twins, the Chrysler Town and Country and Plymouth Voyager. Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca and other domestic automakers accused Toyota of dumping the Previa, selling at a price claimed to be up to 30.5% below its actual cost in the United States in order to take market share in the minivan segment from Chrysler. While the United States Department of Commerce found the imported minivans were being sold for less than their fair value, the United States International Trade Commission determined there was no material injury to domestic manufacturers.

While the Previa proved more popular than the Toyota Van which it replaced, it did not acquire significant market share from Chrysler—due to its higher price, controversial styling (for its time), lower fuel economy and engine performance—and also due to Chrysler launching redesigned minivans around the same time.

In the United States, the first generation Previa model variations, in order of lowest to highest price/option features, are: DX, DX All-Trac, DX S/C, LE, LE All-Trac, LE S/C, LE S/C All-Trac. DX is also known as &quot;Deluxe&quot;. S/C indicates the supercharged engine is fitted, and All-Trac means the vehicle is all-wheel drive.

The mid-engine design precluded the fitment of larger engines, which proved a problem as American drivers were used to having more power; for example, the Dodge/Plymouth/Chrysler models were sold with available V6 engines with slightly more power. Its layout did, however, give the Previa greater interior space than the Chrysler competitors, with of cargo capacity, compared to for the short and long-wheelbase Chrysler minivans.

Specific model year changes include:
* MY 1991–1993: North American Previas with the five-speed manual were made from 1990 through to 1993 (model year 1991 to 1993); the manual was discontinued for the 1994 model year, which also is when the supercharged engine was introduced, so no factory-built Previas are equipped with both a manual transmission and supercharged engine.
* MY 1992: Starting in 1991 for model year 1992, North American Previas came with a driver&#x27;s side airbag and third brake-light. Dual airbags became standard in September 1993 for model year 1994, making it the first minivan to offer a passenger airbag as standard.
* MY 1992–1997: From 1991 to 1997 (for the 1992 to 1997 model years), the optional middle-row individual captain&#x27;s chairs came with a swivel feature, allowing them to be turned to face the rear of the vehicle; earlier 1990 to 1991 production (1991 model year) also had captain&#x27;s chairs as an option, but they were fixed and could not swivel.
* MY 1994: Starting with the 1994 model year, Toyota added an option for the &quot;2TZ-FZE&quot; engine, which is equipped with a Roots-type supercharger providing of boost, and an air-to-air intercooler, bringing the engine power up to a competitive with no penalty to fuel efficiency, which remained at an estimated for combined city/highway driving. Previas equipped with the supercharged engine carry an extra &quot;S/C&quot; badge on the tailgate. The S/C engine option was exclusive to the LE for the 1994 model year, and the option was made available for both DX and LE models for 1995. 
* MY 1996: For the 1996 model year, the supercharged &quot;2TZ-FZE&quot; became the standard engine.

The United States version of the Previa was discontinued after the 1997 model year, replaced by the more traditionally designed, front-wheel drive, US-designed and built, Camry-based Sienna.

==== United Kingdom ====
The first UK market Previas were sold in September 1990, with one trim level called GL with the eight-seat package, followed by the seven-seat uplevel GX (introduced in October 1993) and base GS (introduced in March 1995), retaining the GL as the mid-level model; limited edition models included the Solair I (July 1995, based on GX), Motiv-8 (February 1996, based on GS), Solair II (March 1996, based on GS), and Liber-8 (January 1997, based on GS). No diesel engine Previas were made for the UK market.

==== Netherlands ====
The first generation Previa was marketed in the Netherlands between 1991 and 1994. In 1994, the supercharged or SC model was made standard on all Previas. The only engine available was a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine until 1995. Trim levels were base (later renamed to i denoting an injection engine), GL, GLi and GXi. The 2.2-liter diesel version was a popular grey import.

==== Australia ====
In Australia, the van was marketed as the Tarago, offered in GL/GLi, GLS and GLX forms with 7–8 passenger seating from launch in September 1990. In addition to the Australian market, there were various special edition models available, which varied in trim levels. These include the RV (either 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic with 4WD), commemorative Rugby World Cup editions and Getaway. Feature-wise, all of the special edition models are marketed between the base GLi and GLX models. When the later-style update models were released in Australia, the top-of-the-line GLS model was renamed &quot;Ultima&quot; and the Getaway became a mainstay trim level, being renamed Getaway II.
== Second generation (XR30/XR40; 2000) ==
The first generation Previa was sold outside the United States until 8 January 2000, when a newer front-wheel drive second generation replaced it. The second generation was not available in North America, as they received the Toyota Sienna. The second generation Previa had a slightly longer wheelbase (2900 mm) and was both narrower (1790 mm) and lower (1770 mm) than the first one; it switched to FF layout and was based on the Camry platform.

It was produced with sliding rear passenger doors on both sides and offered space for up to six, seven or eight passengers and, as with the first generation, was sold as the Estima in Japan and as the Tarago in Australia. The range available in Australia was the GLi, GLX and Ultima.

Models sold on the European markets were available with both gasoline and diesel-powered four-cylinder engines. The diesel engine was a 2.0-liter &quot;1CD-FTV&quot; with and the gasoline-powered one a 2.4-liter &quot;2AZ-FE&quot; with . Both models featured a five-speed manual transmission as the part of standard equipment, while a four-speed automatic was available as an option on gasoline-powered model.

Australian models (known locally as ACR30R) were only available with the 2.4-liter petrol engine and a four-speed automatic.

In the UK, GS, GLS and CDX trim levels were available. When the facelift was introduced in June 2003, these became T2, T3 and T Spirit respectively.

In Japan, a 3.0-liter V6 engine and a 2.4-liter hybrid version of the Estima were available.

=== Estima Hybrid ===
The Estima Hybrid employed the Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive and used two electric motors. A 2.4-liter gasoline engine and a electric motor power the front wheels, while the rear wheels are propelled by a electric motor. The vehicle had been on sale in Japan since June 2001. Production of the hybrid started in May 2001 at the Motomachi plant and June 2002 at the Fujimatsu plant. It is claimed by Toyota to be the world&#x27;s first hybrid minivan.


== Third generation (XR50; 2006) ==
The third-generation model was introduced in 2006 in Japanese and Australian markets as the Estima and Tarago respectively, and as the Previa in other markets. This generation was notably absent from the European market.

Features include an available second generation Hybrid Synergy Drive drivetrain (only in the Japanese market), automatic parallel and reverse parking (only on Toyota Estima), Lane-Keep Assist (LKA) system which detects the lane markers on the road and steers the car on the right direction (for Estima only), Adaptive Front-Lighting System low beam headlamps which assists to light up the upcoming road around a bend, track-mounted second row reclining seats with footrests, and power-folding split third row seats (for seven-seater models). It received a minor facelift in 2009. G-BOOK was added to the list of optional features. Active driver assist features such as Lane Keeping Assist and Dynamic Radar Cruise Control were offered as an option exclusively to V6 variants.

In some markets such as Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota announced the 3.5-liter V6 model in January 2007, but was dropped from the lineup after its major facelift in 2016.

In the Philippines, the XR50 replaced the XR40 Previa in 2009. It only comes in the 2.4L Q variant. It is powered by Toyota&#x27;s 2.4L 2AZ-FE inline-four engine with VVT-i paired to a 4-speed automatic transmission. It came with power sliding doors, automatic climate control, faux wood trim, 2DIN 6 CD audio system, speakers, remote keyless entry, and leather seats among other features.

=== Estima Hybrid ===
The third generation Estima Hybrid is powered by Toyota&#x27;s 2.4-liter E-Four hybrid system with all-wheel drive. The hybridized Estima bears the model code &quot;AHR20&quot; and is specifically marketed and sold exclusively in China and Japan, with limited importation to Australia. It is said to be similar to that of the Lexus RX 400h, but a generation behind.

=== Tarago ===
The Tarago was released in March 2006 bearing the &quot;ACR50R&quot; model code featuring the 2.4-liter &quot;2AZ-FE&quot; inline-four engine found in the ACV40R Camry. In February 2007, Toyota released the &quot;GSR50R&quot; model with the 3.5-liter &quot;2GR-FE&quot; V6 engine producing and found in the GSV40R Aurion.

The model received a facelift in 2009, with revisions to the headlamps and bumpers. The option of a seven-seater variant was introduced in 2008. Another update was released in 2012 with smart start as standard on all models, smart entry on GLX V6 and Ultima models, new audio systems on all models, automatic headlights and a new &quot;Rustic Brown&quot; colour option. It also received the major facelift in 2016, with updated interior and other new standard features offered, however it still bears its exterior looks mostly unchanged as with the pre-facelift design. It is available as a family van, a taxicab for regular passengers and a specially designed wheelchair accessible taxi featuring a ramp and longer wheelbase.

In May 2019, Toyota revealed the Granvia, which is heavily based on the latest HiAce van. Toyota Australia confirmed the Granvia will replace the Tarago by the end of 2019, however, they were sold alongside each other for a short period of time. As of March 2020, the Tarago has been discontinued in the Australian market and removed from the Toyota Australia website.

=== Facelift (2016) ===
The facelifted model was launched in mid-2016, its dimensions remain mostly unchanged while it receives various new additional equipment to keep up with its competitors. In the interior features a redesigned multifunction steering wheel and a piano black center console that neatly houses a large touchscreen infotainment display. A new safety system &quot;Toyota Safety Sense C&quot; was offered for the first time in the facelifted Estima, but only for Japanese models. The former includes pre-collision system with pedestrian detection function, lane keep assist, high beam assist and radar cruise control.

Along with the new safety features comes with slightly redesigned headlights with LED daytime running lights, tail lights, bumpers, as well as interior with updated steering wheel design, it also becomes the first Toyota to have 360 degree 99% UV cut glass preventing 99% of UV rays from entering into the vehicle creating a cooler environment overall, this 99% UV cut glass also gets a recommendation from Skin Cancer Foundation and has a SPF 50+/PA++++ rating. The Estima drops its 3.5L V6 engine option and now only offers the 2.4L inline-4 producing , and and its hybrid variant.

<text>West Liberty University (WLU) is a public university in West Liberty, West Virginia, United States. Located in the state&#x27;s Northern Panhandle, it was established as an academy in 1837 and is the oldest university in West Virginia. It offers more than 70 undergraduate majors and graduate programs and had an enrollment of approximately 2,500 students in 2022.

WLU&#x27;s athletic teams, known as the West Liberty Hilltoppers, are charter members of the NCAA Division II Mountain East Conference with nearly 400 student-athletes participating in 16 intercollegiate sports, including football, basketball, wrestling, track, acrobatics &amp; tumbling and baseball.

==History==
What is now West Liberty University was established as West Liberty Academy on March 30, 1837, before the state broke away from Virginia during the American Civil War. Under the guidance of Reverend Nathan Shotwell, it was created to respond to the need for higher educational opportunities west of the Appalachian ridge. The institution was originally a normal school and was named after the town in which it is located. West Liberty was so named in the late 18th century as the westernmost point of the new liberty proclaimed by the U.S. Declaration of Independence.

Under the direction of Paul N. Elbin, the youngest president of a four-year college in the U.S. at age 30, the West Liberty Academy transitioned to West Liberty State Teachers College and eventually West Liberty State College. Under Elbin&#x27;s 35-year leadership, the college developed a full curriculum, faculty, staff, student services, and activities including music and theatre.

West Liberty was approved to become a university by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission in November 2008. The West Liberty Board of Governors voted to change to West Liberty University on May 3, 2009. The bulk of its student body comes from the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia, eastern Ohio, and western Pennsylvania.

Dr. Tim Borchers was appointed as the 38th president on May 12, 2023, by the West Liberty University Board of Governors.

The West Liberty University Alumni Association Board of Directors instituted a project in 1990 to demonstrate to current students, visitors, and friends that the college has some very successful graduates. This project, known as the &quot;Alumni Wall of Honor,&quot; is a dramatic way to honor some of the college&#x27;s most distinguished alumni and display pride in the accomplishments of its graduates. The concept was suggested by then Associate Professor of Physics Robert W. Schramm, who is a 1958 graduate of the college and a 2002 Alumni Wall of Honor inductee. The Alumni Wall of Honor was formerly housed in the south end of the Union known now as the Student Leadership Center and is currently located on the second floor of the Elbin Library.

Alumni Park was located in the &quot;heart&quot; of the campus – just outside Main Hall and adjacent to the Union, at the edge of the &#x27;quad&#x27;. In the summer of 2017, these structures were removed due to deterioration. A replacement wall of alumni and friends is expected to be erected within the breezeway of Main Hall. Currently, a fire globe is situated in Alumni Park.

<doc id="1240530" wikidata="Q1241335" url="?curid=1240530" title="Mitsubishi Mirage">
<text>The Mitsubishi Mirage is a range of cars produced by the Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi from 1978 until 2003 and again since 2012. The hatchback models produced between 1978 and 2003 were classified as subcompact cars, while the sedan and station wagon models, marketed prominently as the Mitsubishi Lancer, were the compact offerings. The liftback introduced in 1988 complemented the sedan as an additional compact offering, and the coupé of 1991 fitted in with the subcompact range. The current Mirage model is a subcompact hatchback and sedan and it replaces the Mitsubishi Colt sold between 2002 and 2012.

==Nameplate history==
The Mirage has a complicated marketing history, with a varied and much convoluted naming convention that differed substantially depending on the market. Mitsubishi used the Mirage name for all five generations in Japan, with all but the first series badged as such in the United States. However, other markets often utilized the name Mitsubishi Colt and sedan variants of the Mirage have been widely sold as the Mitsubishi Lancer—including in Japan where the two retailed alongside one another. In Japan, the Mirage was sold at a specific retail chain called &quot;Car Plaza&quot;.

In the United States and Canada, the first four generations were sold through a venture with Chrysler as the Dodge Colt and the similar Plymouth-badged Champ and Colt. Later, the venture brought the Eagle Vista and Summit branded models which sold alongside the aforementioned. Confusingly, Chrysler has also offered an unrelated Dodge Lancer at various stages between the 1950s and 1980s. However, when DaimlerChrysler briefly controlled Mitsubishi through the DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi alliance from 2000 through to 2004, the license to the &quot;Lancer&quot; name was relinquished to Mitsubishi for usage in North America. Thus, after the fifth and final generation Mirage, replacement models in North America have adopted the new name.

Mitsubishi introduced replacements for the fifth series of Mirage, starting in 2000 with a new generation of Lancer—now larger, having moved up to the compact segment. Then in 2002, a subcompact five-door hatchback badged Colt globally became available. By 2003, the Mirage and its derivatives had been completely phased out of mainstream Japanese production. For the 2002-era Colt&#x27;s replacement in 2012, Mitsubishi decided to resurrect the Mirage name internationally for a new sixth generation model.

With the rising popularity of boxy subcompact SUVs in Japan, the Mirage nameplate was used on a domestic market-only model called the Mirage Dingo, from 1999. The Dingo was facelifted in 2001 and canceled in 2003. However, New Zealand sold a very different Mirage from 2002—a rebadged Dutch-manufactured Mitsubishi Space Star labeled Mirage Space Star. This vehicle was not very popular and was discontinued in 2003.
== First generation (1978) ==
Mitsubishi launched the Mirage as a front-wheel drive three-door hatchback in March 1978, as a response to the 1973 oil crisis. A five-door hatchback on a longer wheelbase arrived in September. Since most overseas markets did not have the Minica kei car, the Mirage was usually sold as Mitsubishi&#x27;s entry-level model. Chassis codes were from A151 to 153 for the three-doors, with A155 and up used for the longer five-door version.

Mirage featured four-wheel independent suspension, rack and pinion steering, plus front disc brakes. Power initially came from 1,244 and 1410 cc iterations of the familiar &quot;Orion&quot; engine, putting out , respectively. Of particular note, the 1410 cc variant featured &quot;modulated displacement&quot;—a system that could shut down cylinders under cruising or idle conditions to reduce fuel consumption. Mitsubishi added the moderately more powerful 1.6-liter &quot;Saturn&quot; engine to the range in March 1979, for the 1600 GT model.The Mirage also debuted Mitsubishi&#x27;s &quot;Super Shift&quot; transmission, a four-speed manual with a second lever for &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; range; effectively making the transmission an eight-speed unit. The &quot;Super Shift&quot; was not originally planned. However, Mitsubishi engineers had to make use of the existing &quot;Orion&quot; engine designed for rear-wheel drive applications making use of the longitudinal engine orientation. In the Mirage, sizing constraints as a result of the front-wheel drive layout required the engine to be mounted transversely, thus causing the carburetor to face forwards and run into icing issues. However, the primary implication of the Mirage&#x27;s powertrain orientation — and the issue that demanded the unconventional transmission — was the mounting of the transmission beneath the engine. This required the gearbox to take power down from the clutch, an action not possible directly as this would have dictated that the gearbox rotate in the opposite direction to that required. To overcome this, the use of an extra &quot;idle&quot; transfer shaft was necessitated. It was subsequently realized that for a cost no more than developing a new five-speed transmission, this shaft could be modified as a separate two-speed gearbox controlled by a secondary shift lever mounted alongside the main lever inside the cabin. The ratios on this transfer transmission were, in effect, &quot;underdrives&quot;—consequently marked on the second shift lever as a &quot;power&quot; mode due to increased performance granted by the lower gearing. In contrast, the higher overdrive setting was noted as &quot;economy&quot;. Mitsubishi called this a unique selling proposition.

===Facelift===
In February 1982, Mitsubishi facelifted the Mirage range. Distinguished by the installation of flusher fitting headlamps that extended into the fender panels, stylists also designed a new grille insert. The tail lights were larger, new firmer engine and transmission mounts were fitted, and a new, lighter and more rigid transmission case was developed. The dashboard was also updated, with rotating &quot;satellite&quot; buttons mounted within fingertip reach for light and wiper functions. Another new version for the Japanese market was the 1600SX, a well-equipped five-door automatic fitted with the 1600GT&#x27;s 88-PS engine.At the same time as this facelift, Mitsubishi introduced a four-door sedan variant to Japan under the names Mirage Saloon and Lancer Fiore, which is not to be confused with the unrelated regular Lancer. The Fiore was often abbreviated to Lancer or Lancer F in international markets, eschewing the &quot;Fiore&quot; suffix. The sedan&#x27;s backseat folded in a 60/40 split, just as for the hatchback. With Mirage hatchback and sedan sales in Japan restricted to the &quot;Car Plaza&quot; dealerships, the Fiore was intended to duplicate the Mirage&#x27;s success at the &quot;Galant Shop&quot; — Mitsubishi&#x27;s second retail sales channel. Lancer Fiore received the same 1.2- and 1.4-liter engines, and as a Mirage-derived model line, was substantially smaller than the strict Lancer. Apart from the wider axle track dictated by the switch to front-wheel drive, the original 1973-era Lancer offered a similar dimensional footprint. Unique to the four-door saloons was Mitsubishi&#x27;s new &quot;Modulated Displacement&quot; (MD) engine, a short-lived technology which allowed the engine to run on only two cylinders while under light loads so as to save on petrol. The valves to cylinders 1 and 4 were disabled by means of hydraulic activators at low speeds and low loads.

A more sporting turbocharged version of the 1.4-liter engine was made available in Japan from the time of the facelift as the 1400 GT Turbo, originally only in the three-door hatchback. To handle the additional power, the suspension was made firmer, the brake servo was upgraded, and the driveshaft was changed to an equal-length design featuring a central bearing. The small turbocharger, of Mitsubishi&#x27;s own manufacture, unusually sat between the intake and the twin-barrel carburetor. The engine was equipped with a knock sensor, enabling it to run on petrols of various octane ratings. The compression ratio was also unusual, fairly high for its time at 8.7 to 1. The Turbo also used the twin-range Super Shift transmission. In Japan, the Turbo was also available with the five-door hatchback bodywork, a version that was rarely exported (if at all). Japanese buyers could also opt for the new turbocharged Lancer Fiore/Mirage Saloon 1400GT; all three of these turbo versions arrived in August 1982. Mitsubishi distinguished the 1400GT with a hood mounted air intake, unique interior, uprated suspension and brakes, and the equalization of the drive shaft lengths to reduce torque steering.

In October 1982, the 1200EX Special (hatchbacks) and 1200EL Special (saloons) were launched in Japan; these were well equipped low-cost versions with heated rear windshields and other extras. The 1400MD Super and Marie limited editions were launched in December 1982. Japanese manufacture of all body variants ended in October 1983.

=== North America ===
Chrysler imported this generation of Mirage to the North America as the Dodge Colt and Plymouth Champ from late-1978 for the 1979 model year, in three-door form only until the 1982 model year when the five-door was added. Then from the 1983 model year, Plymouth retired the Champ and adopted the name Colt as well. 0-60 time was over 12 seconds, and the top speed was 90 MPH. The Mirage Turbo was sold as the Plymouth Colt GTS Turbo, only as a two-door hatchback and fitted with a fuel-injected 1.6-litre 4G32T engine which reappeared in the next-generation Colt.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
The facelifted model was also manufactured as the Colt by Mitsubishi Motors Australia at their Clovelly Park, South Australia plant from 1982 to late 1989, with sufficient inventory stockpiled not exhausting until 1990. Initially offered with the 1.4- and 1.6-liter engines in five-door hatchback form, the sedan was produced from 1984.

Australian Colts were given model codes RA (from November 1980), RB (October 1982), RC (April 1984), RD (October 1986), and RE (September 1988). The RE update was distinguished by revised wheel covers, body side projection mouldings, and grille, plus the addition of body colour bumpers. The SE model was dropped, with the range opening up with the fleet-focused XL hatchback with the 1.4-litre engine and a four-speed manual gearbox, stepping up to the 1.6-litre, GLX hatchback and sedan with five-speed manual or optional three-speed automatic.

This model was also briefly exported to New Zealand in the late 1980s, where it shared showroom space with the locally assembled third generation models. Previously, local complete knock down (CKD) assembly of the Colt took place in Petone, Wellington under contract through Todd Motor Corporation (the NZ, Mitsubishi assembly franchise holders), including a variant called the Mirage Panther. The four-door saloon version (known elsewhere as Lancer Fiore) was sold as the &quot;Mirage Geneva&quot; in New Zealand.

=== Europe ===
Many export markets, such as Europe and Australia received the Mirage under the Colt name. In the United Kingdom, where Colt was the marque itself, it was called the Colt 1200 and Colt 1400, after the engine displacements. In most of Europe, it was sold as the Mitsubishi Colt. The Lancer Fiore (sometimes called Lancer F) arrived in early 1983, which is also when the facelift appeared in Europe. European market models usually have the 1200 or the 1400 engine, with on tap. Max power was reached at 5000 rather than 5500 rpm for the Japanese market models, and they were fitted with somewhat gentler cams for a less peaky power delivery. Some European markets also received the Turbo model, which arrived in late 1982. After the introduction of the second generation Mirage/Colt, the original model remained available in Belgium (at least) as the &quot;Mitsubishi Magnum&quot;, only offered as a three-door with the smallest engine and bare-bones equipment.
== Second generation (1983) ==
Mitsubishi launched the second generation Mirage to Japan in 1983, again splitting the range into Mirage (three- and five-door hatchback, plus four-door sedan) and Lancer Fiore (four-door sedan) models. A station wagon version of the Mirage was added in 1985, with a four-wheel drive wagon available from the fall of 1986 with the 1.8-liter gasoline engine. Many export markets sold the hatchbacks as Mirage or Colt, with the sedan and wagon commonly badged Lancer. This wagon model went on to become very popular in both the commercial and private sectors overseas as well as in Japan. C10-series chassis numbers denote front-wheel-drive models, while C30-series numbers are for four-wheel-drive versions (only station wagons).Uprated engines were deployed into the series; 1.3- and 1.5-liter &quot;Orion&quot; gasoline engines replaced the previous 1.2- and 1.4-liter &quot;Orion&quot; units. Mitsubishi also released variants fitted with the 1.6 and 1.8-liter &quot;Sirius&quot; gasoline powerplants, and for the first time a 1.8-liter &quot;Sirius&quot; diesel was added. The 1.6-liter &quot;Sirius&quot; engine also included a turbocharged variant with between and , featuring the latest in computer control engine technology including electronic fuel injection. Power differed for cars with catalyzers, or for markets with lower octane fuel. Some European markets received a smaller 1.2-liter &quot;tax special&quot; as well, with .

The car received a very mild facelift in early 1986, along with some new engine options for the Japanese domestic market. This included a fuel-injected version of a new 1.5-liter engine from the Saturn family, the G31B. The transmissions were updated at the same time. In October 1986, the sedans and hatchbacks were rebadged &quot;Mirage NOW&quot; for the Japanese market. The change included better equipment and a revised lineup, going from the basic XF via the better equipped XL to the mildly sporty X1 X on top. The X1 X featured an Italvolanti steering wheel and alloy wheels by Porsche Design. Also new was the competitively priced and comprehensively equipped Marion version, only available in the three-door body with the 1.3-liter engine, aimed specifically at young female buyers. Meanwhile, the Van received additional safety equipment such as a laminated front windshield and ELR belts, while the 1500 CX Wagon gained power steering and bronze window tint. The second generation Mirage hatchback was replaced in October 1987; the sedans were replaced in January 1988.

The Wagon and Van versions were kept in production with some minor updates until 1991, as there was no station wagon of the third generation Mirage and Lancer. The diesel engine remained the 1.8-liter 4D65 (also available with four-wheel drive) while the petrol 4G13 and 4G15 were updated with the same new twelve-valve heads as were used on the third generation Mirage beginning in 1989. Power outputs climbed by 12 horsepower for both petrol versions, to in Japanese trim.

===Export===
;Europe
The Mirage was available in Europe as the Colt in 1200 L, EL, and GL trims (mostly three-door models only, but a five-door GL was sold in some markets), as the 1300 GL three- and five-door, 1500 GLX three- and five-door, and as the 1800 L/EL/GL (diesel) three- or five-door. The Lancer sedan was available in the same trim levels as the hatchback model (including the 1200 engine), while the wagon versions were available as 1500 GLX and 1800 GL diesel only. The three-door Colt Turbo was also sold in Europe, with the 1.6-liter ECI engine. The Colt Turbo fared badly in competition with its European GTi-class competitors, with period testers criticizing Mitsubishi for not doing much more than adding a turbocharger, spoilers, and fat tires. It was not a thorough engineering job and the car was not able to fully handle the ample power made available.

Some markets also received the 4WD Wagon with the larger 1.8-liter engine, although the diesel-powered 4WD remained available to Japanese customers only. Versions equipped with catalytic converters first became available in Europe in 1985, at the same time as the wagon was introduced. The two-seater commercial type was sold in the Netherlands simply as the &quot;Mitsubishi Wagon&quot;, whereas the better equipped passenger version was called the Lancer Station Wagon.

;North America
The Mirage was not sold in the United States by Mitsubishi until the 1985 model year. As the usual export name Colt was already used by Dodge and Plymouth, while Lancer was in use by Dodge on an unrelated car, Mitsubishi stuck to Mirage for their own version of the car. Mitsubishi made a 25-year licensing deal to use the &quot;Mirage&quot; name with Grand Touring Cars, Inc. of Scottsdale, Arizona for use in the United States, as that company already owned the rights to the name for the Mirage race car series. While Dodge/Plymouth Colt-branded models were available with four-door sedan bodywork as well as a short-lived five-door hatchback - from model year 1988 also a station wagon - Mitsubishi originally marketed the Mirage only as a three-door hatch through its own American dealers, despite the five-door model having repeatedly been rejected by Chrysler&#x27;s marketing organization in favor of the Dodge Omni.

The 1985 Mirage&#x27;s equipment levels were Base, L, LS, and Turbo, with prices set a few hundred dollars beneath those of its Dodge/Plymouth equivalents. The well-equipped LS model was dropped after the first model year, and in 1987 a four-door sedan was added to the lineup. For 1988, only the Turbo Sport hatchback and naturally aspirated standard 4-door sedan remained in price listings, as the new Mitsubishi Precis supplanted the basic hatchback Mirage. As with the Colts sold by Chrysler, the turbo gained a few horsepower for a total of .

;New Zealand
A commercial version of the wagon was sold in New Zealand as the Mitsubishi Express, replacing an earlier model based on the Galant Sigma. The second generation Mirage range was also assembled in New Zealand, but was never sold in Australia, where the original version was kept in production until the third generation replaced it in 1988.

;Southeast Asia
Mitsubishi in Thailand released the three-door hatchback and four-door sedan models with 1.3- and 1.5-liter engine as the Mitsubishi Champ in 1983. Later the series was renamed Mitsubishi Champ II and Champ III, with the hatchback and 1.5-liter versions discontinued. This was also exported to Canada from January 1988 until the end of Champ production in 1994.

In Indonesia, both the sedan and the 5-door hatchback were sold under the Lancer nameplate. Available in two trim levels, SL with 1.4-liter engine and GLX with 1.6-liter engine.

The four-door sedan formed the basis of the Proton Saga, Malaysia&#x27;s first locally built car and manufactured between 1985 and 2008. Proton would later spin the Saga off into its own five-door hatchback called the Saga Aeroback in 1987 (longer, and styled differently from Mitsubishi&#x27;s own five-door hatchback version).
== Third generation (1987) ==
Mitsubishi introduced the more rounded, third-generation Mirage to Japan in October 1987. Masaru Furukawa headed the vehicle design, with Yasukichi Akamatsu given the role of chief engineer. The basic model, a three-door hatchback with upright tailgate and large glasshouse arrived first. The sedan, released to Japan in January 1988 was stylistically distinct with almost vertical rear glass, influenced by the larger Galant. The range was complemented by a five-door liftback in June 1988, but without a station wagon variant, Mitsubishi persevered with the previous model until the release of a new wagon on the fourth generation chassis. As before, Mirage, Colt, and Lancer naming varied between markets with different body shapes often having different titles in the same market. In Japan, sedans were available with the Mirage and Lancer nameplates, while the three-door was sold only as Mirage, and the liftback only as Lancer. Japanese Mirage sedans usually featured the &quot;Vie Saloon&quot; suffix.Engines available were 1.3- and 1.5-liter &quot;Orion&quot; gasoline inline-fours and 1.8-liter &quot;Saturn&quot; gasoline inline-four. For Greece only, a 1.2-liter version of &quot;Orion&quot; engine available in the entry-level models outputted . The 1.8-liter &quot;Sirius&quot; diesel carried over from the previous shape. In Japan, four-wheel-drive versions were also available, fitted with the carbureted 1.5 and fuel-injected 1.6-liter gasoline engines, or 1.8-liter diesel. The top Mirages in Japan were called the &quot;Cyborg&quot;, featuring the turbocharged 1.6-liter motor developing — the same unit as fitted to the GSR sedan.

=== Lancer GSR ===
=== Facelift ===
The third generation received a minor facelift in September 1989, with late models receiving the same modernized engines as were seen in the subsequent generation. In its most potent turbocharged variant, the new 4G61 engine produced at 6000 rpm.

===Markets===
European versions were available as the 1300 GL, 1500 GLX, 1600 and 1800 GTi-16V, and 1800 diesels, with the three-door labelled Colt and the sedan and liftback called Lancer. Mitsubishi retailed a Colt &quot;van&quot; in select European markets, being the three-door body without rear side windows and therefore attracting reduced taxation in these jurisdictions. In March 1990, the , catalyzed 1600 GTi-16V was replaced by a 1.8-liter version with . A few months later, this version also became available with a non-catalyzed engine for those European markets that still eschewed emissions controls. The next generation Lancer did not include a five-door hatchback; since this was a popular bodystyle in Europe Mitsubishi kept offering this model until mid-1994. Beginning in June 1992, the higher line models were fitted with the new 1.6 and 1.8-litre engines from the 4G9 engine family; a version of the 12-valve 1.3 was also on offer.

Since first generation Mirages were still under Australian production as the Colt, all three third generation body types were sold under the Lancer name in that market. Initially, the Australian-specification models were designated as the &quot;CA&quot; series when introduced in 1988, adopting the &quot;CB&quot; designation for the 1990 facelift. The liftback continued to be sold in Australia alongside the fourth generation (&quot;CC&quot;) Mirage-derived Lancer from 1992 through to 1996. Confusingly, the carry-over liftback was also given this &quot;CC&quot; model designation.

North American three-door and sedan sales occurred under the Mitsubishi Mirage name for the 1989 to 1992 model years. Badge engineered variants were also sold in the US as the Dodge/Plymouth Colt (three-door only), and Eagle Summit. In Canada, a Dodge/Plymouth sedan was also offered as the Mitsubishi brand did not operate in the market until the 2003 model year. For the Mitsubishi-badged versions, the top hatchback carried a 1.6-liter &quot;4G61T&quot; turbocharged inline-four engine rated as . For the 1991 model year, the 1.5-liter &quot;4G15&quot; engine&#x27;s new twelve valve heads (three valves per cylinder) boosted power from , and a new GS sedan offered the 1.6-liter &quot;4G61&quot; with and a standard four-speed automatic transmission.
;Model codes


== Fourth generation (1991; CA/CB/CC/CD) ==
In October 1991, the fourth generation Mirage made its debut for the Japanese market alongside the related Lancer. Departing from the previous series, the new Mirage adopted a much rounder body shape — a change duplicated by much of the automotive industry in the early-1990s. As before, the Japanese Mirage lineup comprised the three-door hatchback (now called Mirage Cyborg) and sedan (now with a six-window glasshouse), plus a new coupé body type suffixed Asti. Lancer variants sold in Japan offered unique body variants — a four-windowed sedan and, from May 1992, a station wagon simply named Mitsubishi Libero. A turbocharged model named Libero GT was also available. The Libero was sold as the Lancer Wagon in most export markets, where its introduction coincided with a small update for 1993, featuring new bumpers and adjustments to the engine lineup. The Lancer wagon was sold until 2003 in the Australian and New Zealand markets, primarily for fleet buyers. The wagon was still listed on a dealer website until 2012 in Belize.

=== Hatchback / Coupe ===
=== Station wagon ===
The US specification with longer bumpers has drag coefficient of (coupe) and (sedan) respectively.

Unlike prior generations, the Japanese market Lancer range co-existed with greater differentiation when compared to the Mirage. The Mirage with its sportier appearance and tapered hood, featured elliptical headlamps with a very narrow single-port grille. Lancer variants diverged with more angular styling characterized by the more upright design. The Lancer also featured re-shaped fenders, less rounded headlamps, and a larger dual-port grille. Although both were built on the same platform, the Japanese-specification Lancer sedan received different sheet metal than the Mirage equivalent. More traditional in silhouette, the Lancer sedan (suffixed Vie Saloon) featured a simple four-window glasshouse, whereas the Mirage sedan adopted a more modern six-window glasshouse with abbreviated trunk.

=== Sedan ===
Naming of the various models for export was many and varied. As a Mitsubishi, the three-door was restricted to the Mirage and Colt names, but the Mirage Asti coupé was often badged Lancer as well. With the sedan, export markets only retailed the four-window variation as a Mitsubishi, although this occurred under both the Lancer and Mirage names.

Mitsubishi&#x27;s powertrain choices were vast with this new platform. Front-wheel drive was most common, with all-wheel drive available for some models. Engines ranged from 1.3- to 1.8-liter naturally-aspirated gasoline inline-fours, 1.8 and 2.0-liter turbocharged versions of the same, plus 1.8 and 2.0-liter diesels. Notably, a gasoline V6 engine variant displacing just 1.6-liters was also offered, making it the smallest ever mass-produced V6.

Many performance models were offered in this generation. The entry-level model is powered with 1.6-liter DOHC inline-four engine producing was sold as &quot;Mirage R, RS, Super R, Cyborg or Cyborg R&quot; and &quot;Lancer MR&quot; in Japan. For export model, the car was badged as &quot; Colt or Lancer GTi&quot;, powered with 1.8-liter DOHC naturally aspirated engine rated at . The 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-four, producing , was sold as a &quot;Lancer GSR or RS&quot; and from September 1993, formed the basis of the Lancer Evolution I that used the 2.0-liter &quot;4G63&quot; engine from the successful Galant VR-4 rally car. An electric version of the wagon was released to Japan named the &quot;Lancer Libero EV&quot; and utilizing a nickel–cadmium battery.

;Australia
Australian market versions of this generation were released in late 1992 and were officially referred to as the &quot;CC&quot; series Lancer. Buyers had the choice of the Lancer coupé (available in GL and GLXi equipment levels), sedan (GL, Executive, and GSR), and wagon (Executive). Five-speed manual transmission came fitted as standard, with all variants except the GSR available with automatic—three gears for the base coupé and sedan—and a four-speed unit for the remainder of the lineup. The GL coupé and sedan featured the 1.5-liter carbureted motor, with the 1.8-liter fuel-injected engine reserved for the rest of the series. All engines except in the GSR are single overhead camshaft design; the GSR featured double overhead camshafts, plus a turbocharger and intercooler.

;North America
This model launched in the United States for the 1993 model year as the Mirage, with all variants now sourced from Japan (instead of Japan or Illinois as previously). The same body shapes were also sold as the Dodge and Plymouth Colt in both the United States and Canada. The six-window greenhouse sedan was sold in these countries as the Eagle Summit alongside a coupé of the same name. For the Mitsubishi branded versions sold only in the United States, the coupé and four-window sedan were offered in base, S, ES and LS trim levels. Five-speed manual transmission was standard, although an automatic was optional on all Mirages except the S coupé. Mitsubishi kept the preceding generation&#x27;s base 1.5-liter &quot;4G15&quot; engine with , but fitted the ES and LS sedans with the new 1.8-liter &quot;4G93&quot; engine rated at . For the 1994 model year, Mitsubishi introduced a driver&#x27;s airbag, the LS sedan lost its optional anti-lock brakes, and the LS coupé gained the 1.8-liter engine previously exclusive to sedans. The 1994 model year was the last year of retail sales for Mirage sedans (which became limited to fleets) and for the Dodge and Plymouth Colts altogether (replaced by Chrysler&#x27;s new, American-designed Neon), although the Eagle Summit sedan and coupé remained on sale alongside the Mirage coupé through to 1996. As a consequence, only S and LS Mirage coupés returned for model year 1995, and both benefitted from a new passenger&#x27;s side airbag and covered center console (and therefore the deletion of the motorized front seatbelts). The 1995 Mirage LS coupé gained uprated 14-inch wheels, but deleted access to power windows, power door locks, and cruise control.
;Proton versions

Mitsubishi granted Proton in Malaysia a license to the fourth generation design from 1993 — it remained in produced in a distant form until 2010. The first variant produced, the sedan was badged Proton Wira (1993–2007) and was complemented by a Proton-designed five-door Wira hatchback (1993–2004). Malaysian manufacture of other variants commenced later, with the three-door Satria (1994–2005) and Putra coupé (1996–2000; and 2004–2005). Proton then developed a coupé utility variant which came to fruition in 2002 as the Arena, lasting until 2010.
== Fifth generation (1995; CK) ==


The release of the fifth generation Mirage to Japan in October 1995 introduced a rationalized lineup as a result of the fragile post-bubble economy in Japan. Three body types were issued: first, the three-door hatchback and sedan, then in December 1995, the two-door coupé (Asti). While the sedan grew slightly in size, the coupé shrunk modestly. It was bumped from the subcompact class to compact in the United States. Whereas the previous Mirage sedan sold in Japan featured a six-window profile, the 1995 redesign shared its styling with the Lancer except for minor differences in trim.

For the Lancer, these included a different trunk lid, amber front turn signal lamps, and a restyled grille garnish. No station wagon of this generation was offered, although the previous generation wagon continued over the entire fifth generation production run. While only the sedan formed part of the Lancer range in Japan, both the coupé and sedan were labeled as Mirage and Lancer in export markets. Between 1995 and 2004, the Mitsubishi Carisma supplanted the sedan in some European markets.

A minor facelift arrived in 1997. Of note, the Lancer sedan featured a new grille and reshaped inner-portions of the headlamps to better differentiate it from the Mirage donor model. Both the coupé and sedan benefited from redesigned tail lamps, whereas the three-door only received a redesigned front bumper incorporating a larger grille. In 1997, a classically styled version of the Mirage three-door hatchback became available in Japan, badged Mirage Modarc. The Modarc featured chrome for the grille, side mirrors, door handles, and bumper strips; it also included fog lights and optional alloy wheels. In 2001, the Mirage-based models gained a chrome-trimmed grille insert in limited markets.

Although a new, substantially larger and more expensive generation of Lancer sedan arrived in 2000, many export markets retained the Mirage-derived model up until 2003 when Japanese manufacture concluded and Mitsubishi retired the &quot;Mirage&quot; nameplate worldwide. This is especially true of the hatchback and coupé which were not redesigned due to Mitsubishi&#x27;s financial troubles. In other markets, the newer sedan often co-existed with the old as a more premium offering. Mitsubishi eventually replaced the three-door in 2005 for Europe only with the three-door Colt—the name previously used in many export markets to denote the Mirage from 1978 onwards. A five-door variant of the Colt had earlier been released in 2002. By 2003, the only Mirage sold in Japan was the coupé, now without the Asti designation. Mitsubishi did not tender a replacement for the coupé.

European three-door CJO series models of this generation were sold between 1995 and 2001 as the Colt. Sedans and wagons sold as Lancers.

===Australia===
This generation was sold in Australia between 1996 and 2003, designated the &quot;CE&quot; series. Like the previous generation, this model was available as a coupé and sedan (badged Lancer), and as the three-door titled Mirage. The Lancer wagon lingered on as a &quot;CE&quot; model, despite being a facelifted remnant of the previous generation. Towards the end of its model run, Mitsubishi introduced several limited editions (based on the GLi) to remain competitive with its rivals. These extras such as sports interiors, alloy wheels, and body kits. Despite the introduction of the new generation Lancer sedan to Australia in 2002, the &quot;CE&quot; continued alongside it until production ended in 2003, including the sedan which remained as the basic GLi. The coupé was now only available in GLi and MR trims.

===United States===
In the United States, the fifth generation Mirage arrived for the 1997 model year and was again available in sedan and coupé versions. The 1.5- &quot;4G15&quot; and 1.8-liter engines from the previous iteration returned in DE and LS trims, respectively. The 1998 model year brought a stronger starter and battery; 1999 introduced a minor facelift, plainer seat fabric; and for the LS coupé, white-faced gauges and a tachometer with either transmission (it was formerly exclusive to the manual). For 2000, Mitsubishi added further standard equipment, plus the standardization of the 1.8-liter engine for the DE sedan; anti-lock brakes were deleted from the options list. Mitsubishi renamed the DE sedan as ES for model year 2001. Mirage sedans were replaced with the next generation Lancer for 2002, although the coupé lingered on for 2002 in North America. The production of the model year 1999 Mirage sedans was greatly lowered due to the large demand for the Eclipse; there were only 4,783 Mirage DE (Deluxe Edition) units produced and 3,829 Mirage sedans exported for that model year. In Puerto Rico, the 1.8L Mirage was sold as the Mitsubishi Technica or Mirage Technica for both 2-door and 4-door variants.

===Venezuela===
Venezuela received this series in 1998 as a Lancer where it remained until 2001. After this, the next generation Lancer entered the market and local production of the old sedan recommenced between 2003 and 2010 under the Mitsubishi Signo name. Variants of the Signo comprise the base 1.3-liter GLi, and the 1.6-liter &quot;Plus&quot; and &quot;Taxi&quot; trims.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, MMPC introduced it in 1996 as the Lancer sedan. Initially it was offered in three grades; EL, GL, and the top-spec GLXi which are locally assembled at MMPC&#x27;s Cainta assembly plant. The EL &amp; GL grades are powered by either a 1.3 or 1.5L carburated engine, while the GLXi is powered by a 1.6L inline-four engine all paired to a standard 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission (GL &amp; GLXi only).

In 1997, MMPC added the Limited Saloon &amp; 2-door GSR coupe variants to the lineup. Both grades are still powered by the 1.6L inline-four engine with a choice of a standard 5-speed manual or INVECS 4-speed automatic transmission. The &quot;Limited Saloon&quot; featured redesigned grille, leather upholstery, JBL speakers, taillight garnish, power adjustable seats (driver side only), keyless entry among other features.

In 1998, the 2-door Lancer known as the Lancer GSR received a facelift. It featured strut bar, leather steering wheel and seats, Dual airbags, and ABS. The Lancer GSR is powered by the same 1.6L four-cylinder engine found on the GLXi &amp; Limited Saloon grades. It is paired to a INVECS 4-speed automatic transmission.

In 1999, Mitsubishi added another trim the &quot;MX&quot; to compete with Nissan&#x27;s &quot;Sentra Exalta&quot; &amp; Toyota&#x27;s &quot;Corolla SE-G&quot;. The MX trim is powered by a 1.6L inline-four engine coupled to a 5-speed automatic transmission with manu-matic shift mode respectively. It featured leather seats, automatic climate control and wood paneling.

By mid-2000, Mitsubishi axed the EL &amp; GL model trims in favor of the Lancer &quot;1.6 GLS&quot; trim which featured redesigned front-end &amp; cloth seats. It was launched in 2001.

===Indian production ===
This series also entered Indian production in June 1998 as the Lancer, assembled by Hindustan Motors. Available model variants were LX sedans with either the 1.5-liter gasoline engine or 2.0-liter diesel and a five-speed manual transmission. The gasoline option produces while the diesel only offered . In 2004, the 1.8-liter 4G93 gasoline engine was added, only in conjunction with a four-speed automatic transmission, while the power of the 1.5 was downgraded to . The Lancer was joined by the Lancer Cedia in 2006 and continued to be sold alongside that model until discontinued in 2012.Lancer along with polo (6c) are only cars sold till date that have won the WRC Manufacturer’s and Driver’s championships

===Chinese version===
This generation Lancer entered production in the Chinese market as the Soueast Lioncel in March 2003 and was produced by Soueast Motors up to 2005. Pricing for the Lioncel ranged between 84,000 yuan and 159,800 yuan (12,150 to US$23,120) for the 2004 model year and 78,900 to 133,800 yuan (11,415 to US$19,360) for the 2005 model year. The Mitsubishi Lancer was also produced by the manufacturer with slightly different exterior styling compared to international markets featuring larger headlights and revised taillights. A modified version was known as Mitsubishi Lancer S-Design and was shown at the Guangzhou Auto Show in 2014. The standard engine for the Chinese market Lancer was the 1.6-litre &quot;4G18&quot; engine paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox for the Lancer Classic and Lioncel with an optional 4-speed automatic available on the Lancer. Trim levels for the Lancer were the 1.6 SEi (manual and automatic), 1.6 EXi (manual and automatic) and 1.6 EXi Sports (manual and automatic) with price ranging from 94,800 yuan to 122,800 yuan (15,020 to US$19,460). The Lioncel also shares these trim levels. Production for the Lancer started in May 2006 and ended in 2015.

Another variant called the Soueast Lingyue is a facelifted version of the Lancer and successor to the Lioncel and was produced by Soueast Motors from October 2008 to December 2019. The facelifted Lingyue was launched in August 2010. The Soueast Lingyue ran on a 1.5-litre &quot;4G15&quot; engine for the 2008 model year only where it was replaced by the 1.5-litre &quot;4A91&quot; engine for 2009 models onwards. The Lingyue comes with a 5-speed manual gearbox as standard and a CVT option was available from 2010 to 2014.

=== Successor ===

When Mitsubishi introduced a new independent generation of Lancer in 2000 (without a corresponding Mirage), the old Mirage-based sedan was discontinued in Japan, although production continued for export. The next phase in the Mirage&#x27;s demise was the release of the Colt—a five-door hatchback—in 2002. The Colt replaced the Mirage hatchback, despite the latter being a three-door. Unlike its predecessor, the Colt featured a tall, upright design with a short engine compartment to maximize interior dimensions. Engines for the Colt comprised 1.1-liter three-cylinder, plus 1.3-, 1.5-, and 1.6-liter gasoline inline-fours with a standard five-speed manual and optional continuously variable transmission (automatic).

Sales in export markets did not occur until 2004, with production in Japan no longer being the primary source. European models were instead sourced from Born, the Netherlands with a three-door body produced exclusively at this factory from 2004. Also in 2004, the Colt Plus was launched as a longer version of the standard five-door with greater luggage capacity. Then in 2006, the range expanded further with the release of the Colt CZC—a convertible with a retractable hardtop roof. Colt convertibles were produced only at the Netherlands facility, with final assembly taking part with Pininfarina at Turin, Italy.

Manufacture of the Colt ended in 2012, with the successor model reverting to the Mirage name internationally. Unlike the Colt&#x27;s expensive architecture shared with the Smart Forfour, the emphasis on the Mirage is low pricing to increase Mitsubishi&#x27;s presence in emerging markets.
== Sixth generation (A00/LA, A10; 2012) ==
The Colt was renamed back to Mirage in 2012. The sixth generation was previewed as a concept car at the 2011 Geneva International Motor Show, with series production cars unveiled at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. For some European markets, the name Mitsubishi Space Star is used. The model code is A00, although in Australia it is referred to as the LA.

The Mirage is built at Mitsubishi Thailand&#x27;s Laem Chabang plant, facility number three since 19 April 2012. The car is mainly developed as a response to the Eco Car policy endorsed by the Thailand government. The car effectively doubled Mitsubishi sales figures in the country. Shipments to Japan began in July, with the Australian hitting the market in January 2013. Mitsubishi Motors Philippines began manufacturing both the hatchback and G4 sedan variants of the Mirage for the country&#x27;s market in January 2017.

In designing the Mirage, Mitsubishi&#x27;s objectives were affordability (including in developing economies) and high efficiency. To aid efficiency, minimizing vehicle mass was one engineering focus. &quot;Painstaking efforts to reduce weight&quot;, including the use of high-tensile steel in the body, resulted in a vehicle that is the lightest in its segment in some markets. In North America, it is the lightest 4-door car available (only the 2-passenger Smart Fortwo is lighter).

Reducing aerodynamic drag was another primary design goal. One of the car&#x27;s aerodynamic features resulted in a new patent application. The result is the lowest drag coefficient (Cd) in its class. Depending on drivetrain and options, the car&#x27;s Cd ranges from 0.27 to 0.31.

=== Markets ===

==== Japan ====
Early Japanese models has 1.0-litre 3-cylinder engine with Auto Stop &amp; Go (AS&amp;G), CVT and 165/65 R14 tires. The 1.0-litre three-cylinder car for the Japanese market achieves in the JC08 cycle and will have a sub-1 million yen price tag.

There was no 2016 model year in the North American market.

In August 2024, Mitsubishi Motors North America confirmed that production of the Mirage would cease later in 2024, expecting inventory to last through the summer of 2025. Its discontinuation leaves the Nissan Versa the only automobile in the United States to have a price tag of under $20,000 after destination charge, itself set to be discontinued after 2025 

===First facelift===
At the 2015 LA Auto Show, Mitsubishi previewed the Mirage&#x27;s 2017 facelift. The car received a new front end design, projector headlights with LED daytime running lights, and LED tail lights. The facelift results in a drag coefficient of 0.27&quot;cd&quot;. In addition, engine output was increased from , the suspension was improved through better shock absorbers, revised spring rates, and upgraded brakes (larger discs on front, drums on rear, and different friction material). The interior also saw numerous aesthetic changes from the steering wheel to the HVAC system and a new optional touchscreen infotainment system using Apple&#x27;s CarPlay interface and a 300W Rockford Fosgate audio setup. A Rockford Fosgate Edition of the ES trim, fitted with a 300-watt premium stereo, was sometimes available beginning in late 2015. It is typically referred to as the Mirage RF and is fitted with a small Rockford Fosgate sticker.

===Second facelift===
The second facelift of the Mirage was launched in November 2019, with new front end styling to match the company&#x27;s new design language and allowed for a collision avoidance system to be added. The interior also received updated styling and all models received new touchscreen audio system with support for Apple CarPlay.

In June 2021, an off-road look Space Star Cross is launched in Portugal.

=== Sedan (A10) ===
The four-door sedan version of the Mirage, known as Mitsubishi Attrage or Mitsubishi Mirage G4 in some markets, has been manufactured at Mitsubishi&#x27;s Laem Chabang plant in Thailand since June 2013. The sedan was first introduced as a concept car at the 2013 Bangkok International Motor Show called the Concept G4 sedan. The sedan is only offered with the 1.2-liter engine.

==== Markets ====
The Attrage is sold in few Western European markets such as Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg. The engine is available as a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine that produces 59 kW (80 hp). A continuously variable transmission is available as an option. The Attrage is also sold in Singapore, Turkey, Malaysia, Israel and the Middle East.

===== Philippines =====
According to Masaaki Yamada, senior adviser for Mitsubishi Motors Philippines, the company used the Mirage G4 name in the Philippine market, as they claimed the &quot;Attrage&quot; nameplate has a negative connotation in the Filipino language. &quot;Attrage&quot; sounds too much like &quot;atrás,&quot; Filipino or Spanish for &quot;going backwards&quot;. The Mirage G4 was released in the Philippine dealerships in October 2013.

In the Philippines, the Mirage G4 received its facelift on 28 August 2021. It is offered in the same trim models as the pre-facelift model: GLX (manual &amp; CVT) and GLS (CVT only).

In January 2022, a limited-edition GLS Sport was introduced. Based on the GLS trim, the GLS Sport features sideskirts, grille garnish, and rear lip spoiler. Only 300 units were produced.

The limited-edition Black Series was introduced in November 2022. Based on the GLS trim, the Black Series features front grille red accent, black-painted side mirrors, and high-gloss black 15-inch alloy wheels. It is also packed with enhancements such as the new floor LED illumination and center console LED illumination, both in blue, it also comes with a center arm rest console and a trunk luggage tray as standard. Only 150 units will be produced.

===== Mexico =====

In Mexico, the Attrage is sold as the Dodge Attitude, replacing the Hyundai Accent (RB) from January 2015 model after Hyundai&#x27;s arrival in the Mexican market.

Starting on 1 February 2019, the Mitsubishi Mirage G4 has been sold in Mexico alongside the return of Mitsubishi in the Mexican market, coexisting with the Dodge Attitude. It was facelifted in August 2020.

===== North America =====
For the US market, the Mirage G4 sedan was available from spring 2016 as a 2017 model. It is available in ES and SE trims, with 7 airbags available as standard.

In Canada, sales of the G4 sedan ran 3 model years, from 2017 to 2019. It was cancelled owing to low sales relative to the hatchback (the G4 made up less than 20% of total Mirage sales in 2018).

===== Thailand =====
The Attrage received its facelift in Thailand on 18 November 2019 with the same front fascia as the second facelift Mirage hatchback.

;Reception
The current Mirage has proven to be a polarizing design. It has been met with negative reviews in some markets, and praise in others. Favorable reviews highlight the efficiency of the design, while critics often illustrate the car&#x27;s shortcomings, with a tendency to compare the Mirage with more expensive cars.

&quot;Auto Express&quot; and Ollie Kew of &quot;Car Magazine&quot; all gave the car a two out of five star rating. Peter Anderson of &quot;The Motor Report&quot; gave it two-and-a-half out of five stars. &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine rated the Mirage 3 out of 5 stars for &quot;cost and verdict.&quot; Matt Jones of &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine gave the Mirage an Overall Verdict of 3 out of 10. Sam Wollaston of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the car a Cool Factor rating of 3 out of 10. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; placed the Mirage among the 10 Worst Cars of 2013 and &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine placed the Mirage on its list of &quot;The worst cars you can buy right now.&quot;

Jason Torchinsky of Jalopnik gave the 2014 Mirage an 8 out of 10 for Value and even went on to criticize critics of the Mirage for excessive criticism, saying &quot;I get the appeal of writing a bad review — they&#x27;re a hell of a lot more fun to write than a good review... But you have to keep that critic-lust in check, sometimes, and try and really get to the truth of things.&quot;

On the positive side, Kelley Blue Book gave the Mirage an overall rating of 6.2 (with a Consumer Rating of 9.4/10), quoting that &quot;If the most important thing to you is getting the cheapest new car you can find with the most equipment and best possible fuel economy, you&#x27;ll like the 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage.&quot; The Mirage was named one of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s 12 Greenest Cars of 2014, and was one of two non-hybrid vehicles on the list. In the Philippines, the Mirage was awarded the &quot;2012–2013 Car of the Year&quot; by the Car Awards Group. &quot;Top Gear Philippines&quot; rated the car 18 out of 20, and stated, &quot;For the single person or young couple on a budget, the Mirage is still the sweetest deal in town.&quot; In Denmark, the Space Star received largely positive reviews, and was the fifth most sold car in January–February 2015. The Hispanic Motor Press awarded the Mirage as Best Subcompact in 2014 and recognized the Mirage G4 as Best Subcompact in 2017. Company Vehicle of New Zealand praises the Mirage, calling it &quot;&quot;an ideal city commuter which is absolutely effortless to slip into even the tightest of parking spaces&quot;.&quot; The Automotive Science Group has recognized the Mirage for Best All-Around Performance and Best Economic Performance. Patrick Rall of Torque News praised the 2018 Mirage GT, noting it as a &quot;great winter commuter car&quot; with &quot;lots of features&quot;. Brian Wong of Cars.com called the Mirage GT &quot;fun to drive&quot; and praised its light-weight design. Erik Shilling notes that after eight years on the market, &quot;the Mirage is probably the best kind of car there is: a cheap car that functions, and isn&#x27;t pretending otherwise.&quot;

<text>Shasta Beverages is an American soft drink manufacturer that markets a value-priced soft drink line with a wide variety of soda flavors, as well as a few drink mixers, under the brand name Shasta. The company name is derived from Mount Shasta in northern California and the associated Shasta Springs.

== History ==
Shasta began as &quot;The Shasta Mineral Springs Company&quot; at the base of Mt. Shasta, California, in 1889. In 1928, the name was changed to &quot;The Shasta Water Company&quot;. It produced bottled mineral water from Shasta Springs in Northern California. The water was poured into glass-lined railroad cars and shipped off for local bottling.

In 1931, Shasta produced its first soft drink, a ginger ale. Until the 1950s, the company&#x27;s products were mainly mixers for alcoholic drinks: mineral water, club soda, and ginger ale.

Shasta introduced new marketing strategies in the 1950s, which became industry standards: the packaging of soft drinks in cans, the introduction of low-calorie (i.e., “diet”) soft drinks, and the distribution of cans and bottles directly to grocers through wholesale channels.

By the 1960s, Shasta was a well-known brand of sodas and mixers in most of the western United States and parts of the Southwest. During the 1960s, Shasta was purchased by Consolidated Foods (later known as Sara Lee) and was renamed &quot;Shasta Beverages&quot;. In 1985, it was acquired by the National Beverage Corp., which also owns the similarly marketed Faygo line of soft drinks.

== Advertising ==
In the early 1980s, Shasta was expanding nationally and increasing advertising spending. In 1983, the company&#x27;s ad agency hired Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen (at the time a rising synth pop musician) to write and perform a jingle for a commercial.

==Products==
Shasta currently produces 34 varieties of soft drinks and mixers for mixing alcoholic drinks, including:
* Apple
* Black Cherry and Black Cherry Zero Sugar

In 1993, Shasta Beverages offered flavors such as Mario Punch and Princess Toadstool Cherry, which were produced in 8-ounce cans and marketed to children.

From 2003 to 2006, Shasta Beverages sold soft drinks called &quot;Shasta Shortz: that were also marketed to children. Shasta Shortz products were produced in 8-ounce cans and had sweeter, more candy-like flavors, including Bubble Gum, Camo Orange Creme, Chillin&#x27; Cherry Punch, Cotton Candy, Rah-Rah Root Beer, and Red Grape Stain.

==Ingredients==
Shasta Beverages uses high-fructose corn syrup as the sweetener in their drinks. Shasta diet soft drinks use sucralose and acesulfame potassium as non-nutritive sweeteners. Some of their sugar-based drinks, including their cola, use a combination of high-fructose corn syrup and sucralose. Ingredients for some of their sodas are as follows (in decreasing order by % of product):

*Diet Cola: carbonated water, caramel color, phosphoric acid, citric acid, potassium citrate, sucralose, potassium benzoate (a preservative), caffeine, acesulfame potassium, natural flavor
*Root Beer: carbonated water, high-fructose corn syrup, caramel color, natural and artificial flavors, potassium benzoate (preservative), sucralose
*Tiki Punch: carbonated water, high-fructose corn syrup, citric acid, potassium benzoate, gum acacia, natural and artificial flavor, glyceryl abietate, red 40
*Orange Soda: carbonated water, high-fructose corn syrup, citric acid, potassium benzoate (preservative), modified corn starch, glyceryl abietate, natural flavor, yellow 6, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), sucralose, calcium disodium EDTA, red 40

<text>Live at the Whisky is the second live recording by American rock band Kansas, released in 1992. The U.S. version includes a bonus track &quot;Lonely Street&quot; from 1975. A German version of the release contains an alternative bonus track, &quot;Journey from Mariabronn&quot; which actually includes both &quot;Belexes&quot; and &quot;Journey from Mariabronn&quot; together from that same show. The German bonus track is also available on iTunes, Napster, and other streaming services.

The album notes state that it was recorded in &quot;one take&quot;, and has been criticized by some because of the harsh vocals of singer Steve Walsh, whose voice was failing at that time as a result of a variety of issues, including fatigue and substance abuse. It was the first official Kansas release (other than compilations) not to reach the album charts, and also the first not released on a major record label.

Walsh has stated in interviews that the recording of this CD and video was doomed from the beginning and he is embarrassed of anything that has to do with it. Since the band was funding this CD and video themselves, to save money, the band used videotape instead of film, which caused problems during the filming. Excessive lighting had to be used on stage so the videotape would pick up all the images which then led to excessive heat on stage making the performers sweat which was rather unflattering when watching the finished product. A filter was used during editing that softened the images but it caused the picture to look distorted making purchasers wonder if they had received a defective item.

While the recording of the band was recorded in one take, the vocal track was not and was overdubbed at a later date. Walsh has said this was a very difficult time for him when it came to his substance abuse. He was smoking pot and using cocaine on a daily basis as well as drinking excessively, which caused him to be exhausted and run down so on top of all of those things he also happened to be sick that night. Walsh has also stated that the band has no plans on re-releasing the video in its entirety, they consider it an embarrassment and consider fans lucky if they have a copy. There is a &quot;Director&#x27;s cut&quot; with extra performances of the video that has surfaced in recent years with the original vocal track intact and without the use of the softening filter.

<doc id="1240566" wikidata="Q10858367" url="?curid=1240566" title="Merkur XR4Ti">
<text>The Merkur XR4Ti is a performance-oriented 3-door hatchback sold in North America from 1985 to 1989. A product of the Ford Motor Company, the car was a version of the European Ford Sierra adapted to U.S. regulations. The XR4Ti project was championed by Ford vice president Bob Lutz.

==History==
The Sierra was the successor to Ford of Europe&#x27;s Cortina/Taunus, and was developed while Lutz was chairman of Ford&#x27;s European operations. Due to financial limitations the decision was made to keep the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout of its predecessor, and pursue improved fuel economy through advanced aerodynamics. The Probe III design study unveiled at the 1981 Frankfurt Motor Show foreshadowed the direction Ford would take with the Sierra. Responsibility for the Sierra design was handled by vice president for design Uwe Bahnsen and chief stylist Patrick le Quément. The Sierra was released in Europe in September 1982, and the performance-oriented XR4i appeared in 1983, slotted into the lineup above the Fiesta-based XR2 and Escort-based XR3.

Lutz spearheaded the plan to bring a version of the XR4i to North America to compete with sporty luxury imports like BMW. Although modifications would be needed, his instructions were that the nature of the car not be compromised. The XR4 for America would be turbocharged, adding a &#x27;T&#x27; to its name while keeping the &#x27;i&#x27; indicating a fuel injected engine, as in Europe. The &#x27;Sierra&#x27; name was not used in North America, since it was already used by General Motors for their GMC C/K Sierra pickup truck, and sounded too similar to the Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera.

With their own production lines occupied building Sierras for the European market, Ford contracted out assembly of the XR4Ti. Using body panels from Ford&#x27;s factory in Genk, the cars were largely hand-built by Wilhelm Karmann GmbH in Rheine, Germany. The XR4Ti was introduced at a starting price of US$16,503 ().

Chief executive officer Pete Petersen decided that the car would be sold under the &#x27;Merkur&#x27; brand name. The name means &#x27;Mercury&#x27; in German, and tied the new brand to the Lincoln-Mercury dealers through which the car would be sold. Initially, 800 Lincoln-Mercury dealers enrolled to also become Merkur dealers.

Ford projected sales of 16,000 to 20,000 units per year. These targets were never met, although for the first two years they came close, with over 25,000 units sold. The car continued to struggle to establish its identity in the North American market, both with the public and with dealers.

An increasingly unfavorable dollar/Deutschmark exchange rate put upward pressure on price. By the late 1980s the XR4Ti was facing a redesign to comply with incoming safety regulations in the US. Ford dropped the &#x27;Merkur&#x27; name in 1988, and began to refer to their two European imports by their model names only. Sales dropped off rapidly after 1986, so that in its last year fewer than 3,000 XR4Tis were sold. 1989 was the last year for the XR4Ti.

The XR4Ti was the last vehicle imported by Ford into North America from Germany until 2016, when the Ford Focus RS was introduced.

==Body, chassis, suspension==

The XR4Ti kept the 3-door semi-notchback hatchback body style of the XR4i, including the European version&#x27;s triple side-window profile and bi-plane rear spoiler. The lower body was clad in polycarbonate &#x27;anti-abrasion&#x27; panels that were matte grey in the early cars. The car&#x27;s drag coefficient (formula_1) was 0.328.

The unibody chassis of the European Ford Sierra was modified to meet US safety requirements. The floorpan had reliefs added to accommodate catalytic converters. Side intrusion beams were added to the two doors, and the bumpers were stretched to meet US impact requirements. To accommodate the engine for the US-spec car, the XR4Ti also received a taller hood. Altogether 850 unique parts were developed for the car destined for the US and Canada, and these changes added approximately to the weight.

Suspension was independent front and rear. The front suspension comprised Macpherson struts with concentric coil springs and lower lateral links triangulated by an anti-roll bar. The rear suspension used semi-trailing arms with coil springs ahead of the axle half-shafts, and shock absorbers behind. An anti-roll bar was also fitted at the rear. Spring rates were softened compared to the XR4i, based on feedback from Jackie Stewart, who had been brought in as both a development tester and spokesman for the car. Steering was by a power-assisted rack and pinion with 3.6 turns lock-to-lock. Brakes were disks in front and drums at rear. The car had a two-piece driveshaft and used a giubo as a torsional damper.

==Engine and transmission==
While the European XR4i was powered by a 2.8 L version of the Ford Cologne V6 engine, the only engine offered in the XR4Ti was a turbocharged Lima inline-four - which was the American market version of the &quot;Pinto&quot; engine used in the standard version of the Sierra sold in Europe. This engine featured a cast-iron block, cast iron cylinder head with 2 valves per cylinder, and a single overhead cam driven by a timing belt. The XR4Ti engine also received a Garrett AiResearch turbocharger, fuel-injection and Ford&#x27;s EEC-IV engine control unit. Built in Ford&#x27;s Taubaté Brazil plant, the engine had a bore of and stroke of for a total displacement of . A nearly identical engine was used in the 1983 Mustang Turbo GT and 1983 Thunderbird Turbo coupe. The XR4Ti did not have the intercooler found in the 1984 SVO Mustang or 1987-88 Thunderbird Turbo coupe. Engines in cars equipped with automatic transmissions had maximum boost set to and produced . In cars with manual transmissions maximum boost was raised to and the ECU programming was modified to allow the engine to produce .

The second-order vibrations produced by this large four cylinder engine had been noticeable when it was used in the turbocharged Thunderbird and Cougar models. To minimize these in the XR4Ti without resorting to extreme measures such as adding balance shafts, extensive work was done to reduce noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) in the power-train. The first measure taken to reduce NVH was to redesign the engine&#x27;s external components, including the intake manifold, to increase the stiffness of the bracketing and lighten the components. The second measure was to reduce the amount of vibration transmitted to the body structure by using soft rubber engine mounts. Engine roll was controlled by wide-based mounting brackets, and engine movement due to bumps was limited by having the brackets attached to the body via hydraulic mounts.

The base transmission was a 5-speed manual Ford Type 9 unit, while a Ford C3 3-speed automatic transmission was optional.

==Options and updates==
The XR4Ti arrived on the market with an extensive list of standard and optional equipment.

1985:
* Standard equipment includes flush headlamps, variable ratio power steering, power mirrors, power disc brakes, nitrogen-pressurized shock-absorbers.
* Interior equipment includes air conditioning, a 60/40 folding rear seat, and an AM/FM stereo with integrated cassette player.
* A manual transmission is standard and an automatic is optional. Most cars are equipped with manuals.
* Tires are Pirelli P6 195/60HR14 fitted to 14-inch 8-hole &quot;phone dial&quot; alloy wheels.
* Other features, like power windows, power door locks, cruise control, leather seats, heated front seats, manual moon-roof, and metallic paint, are extra-cost options.

Many changes were made to the car over its five-year life. These include:

1986:
* A central high-mounted stop light is integrated into the lower rear wing.
* Windows now roll down below sill edge.
* Driver&#x27;s side wiper airfoil is dropped.
* Turbocharger outlet tube is now smooth.
* Heater core is upgraded. (Late year change)

1987:
* The XR4Ti inherits many upgrades from the European Sierra Mk.II chassis, including a wider transmission tunnel and different pedal spacing.
* A monochromatic paint scheme that matches the lower body cladding color to the rest of the body becomes a mid-year option. Colors are black, red or white.
* The standard alloy wheels are upgraded to 15-inch 8-slot &quot;pie-spoke&quot; units.
* Tires are now Pirelli P6 195/60HR15.
* The dashboard is redesigned to address premature cracking experienced by earlier cars.
* The diamond-shaped &#x27;Merkur&#x27; badge on the rear is replaced with simple “Merkur” text on the deck-lid.
* The fender-mounted antenna is replaced by an antenna trace bonded to the glass of the rear hatch.
* Redesigned steering reduces turns lock-to-lock to 2.42, and turning circle to 35.4 feet.
* The engine receives a new cam cover.
* The sound system is changed. Joystick balance control is removed.
* Three new paint colors are available.
* Oil level sensor and dash indicator is deleted.
1988:
* The bi-plane rear spoiler is replaced by a simpler single-level wing.
* The rear hatch gets a larger glass panel in the hatch with the change of wing, which combines to raise the coefficient of drag.
* The standard alloy wheels are changed to a BBS-style cast wire-spoke model.
* Beige/brown cladding now offered depending on body color.
* Speedometer scale now goes to 150 mph.
* New interior colors are available.

1989:
* The dashboard ends are shortened slightly to allow the A-pillar trim to extend past it.
* Cruise-control becomes standard equipment.
* Coolant overflow bottle is relocated.

In addition to the changes above many modifications were incorporated as Technical Service Bulletins.

==Special editions==
Several automotive customizers produced versions of the XR4Ti that offered increased performance and improved handling. Among these were Roush, Rapido, and RC Consultants. These conversions were sold as either owner-installed kits or pre-built vehicles. 

One such special, called the &quot;Scorch XS&quot; and built by Ralph Todd, replaced the Ford engine with a twin-turbocharged Nissan VG30DETT V6. Only one of these US $50,000 conversions was built; Scorch Prototype #001. It was later upgraded with larger brakes and wheels. The last magazine article featuring the Scorch listed a revised cost of US $55,000. Creation of other Scorch conversions had been started, but never completed. 

Ford only offered one special edition of the XR4Ti when it launched the XR4Ti K2 in 1987, the result of a tie-in with ski manufacturer K2 Sports. This all-white model came with colored &quot;K2&quot; logos on the front fenders and a roof-mounted ski rack. No mechanical changes were made to the K2 version.

==Performance reviews and legacy==
In their September 1984 road test of the XR4Ti &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; magazine reported a 0-60 mph time of 7.0 seconds, a 1/4 mile time of 15.5 seconds and a top speed of . In later tests by the same magazine the car took 7.8 seconds to accelerate from 0-60 mph, leading the testers to speculate that the earlier press car might have been a ringer, a not-uncommon practice at the time. In their test data they stated the press car came with a limited slip differential, something that was not offered as standard or an option for the XR4Ti during its production. The first test car returned a combined city/highway fuel economy of , and generated 0.80 Gs of lateral acceleration.

Numbers from the March 1985 road test by &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine are comparable. Their car ran from 0-60 mph in 7.9 seconds and reached the end of the quarter mile in 16.0 seconds. Lateral acceleration was measured at 0.767 Gs and the car ran through the R&amp;T slalom at a speed of 59.7 mph. Their car&#x27;s fuel economy was measured as .

Contemporary reviews of the car often mention either the non-intuitive pronunciation of the brand name or the car&#x27;s polarizing appearance. Most praise the car&#x27;s handling, while recognizing areas where it falls short of expectations. Some felt the car showed more body roll while cornering than desired. The disk/drum brake system was felt to be adequate but not outstanding. Others were disappointed that no anti-lock was offered. While &quot;Car and Driver&#x27;s&quot; first report went into great detail about Ford&#x27;s efforts to reduce NVH, their later tests reported that there was still noticeable vibration in the drive-line. Effective use of the car has hampered by what some felt was the engine&#x27;s narrow power band.

Even after production ended the car continued to provoke widely differing opinions. The XR4Ti was on &quot;Car and Driver&#x27;s&quot; Ten Best list for 1985. In 2009 however, the magazine listed that honor as one of the &quot;most embarrassing&quot; awards in automotive history.

In addition to &quot;Car and Driver&quot;&#x27;s change of heart some have numbered the XR4Ti among the 10 worst cars ever made, and &quot;not (Ford&#x27;s) finest hour&quot;.

On the other hand, other articles have called it one of the 10 best forgotten cars, and a car that had unfairly received a bad reputation.

== Technical data ==

==Motorsport==

Despite the XR4Ti never being sold outside of the United States and Canada, Andy Rouse campaigned one in the British Saloon Car Championship. Rouse took the overall title for the 1985 season and the class title for 1986 with 14 wins. In 1986, Eggenberger Motorsport was among the few to use an XR4Ti to compete in the European Touring Car Championship and the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (German Touring Car Championship) with positive results.

Ford used technical feedback from the teams racing the XR4Ti to develop the 1986 Ford Sierra RS Cosworth, which first appeared on race tracks in 1987 and was superseded in mid-1987 by the Ford Sierra RS500. Some of the body panels used to stiffen the Sierra chassis and create the Merkur shell were subsequently branded 909 Motorsport parts for later adaptation to a Sierra shell. Many see the successes and failures of the XR4Ti as being the blueprint for success of the dominant RS500 Sierras.

Between 1986 and 1987, Pete Halsmer and Scott Pruett campaigned the Roush-prepped XR4Ti, although of a tubeframe construction like that of a silhouette racing car, to take the Trans-Am Series title. Along with Paul Miller, the pair also campaigned an XR4Ti successfully in the IMSA series in 1988.

<doc id="1240570" wikidata="Q907913" url="?curid=1240570" title="Harold Hongju Koh">
<text>Harold Hongju Koh (born December 8, 1954) is an American diplomat, lawyer, legal scholar, politician, and writer who served as the legal adviser of the Department of State in the Obama administration. He was nominated to this position by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2009, and confirmed by the Senate on June 25, 2009. He left the State Department in January 2013, returning to Yale University as a Sterling Professor of international law. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2007.

==Early life and family==
Koh was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents grew up in Korea under Japanese rule in an area that later became part of North Korea. He has described his family thus:

They grew up under Japanese colonial rule, forbidden to speak Korean or even to use their Korean names. When their country was divided after World War II, my mother and her family were trapped in North Korea. In desperation, they hiked for days to the border to be picked up and were brought back to Seoul. But even there, they lived under dictatorship. For less than a year in the 1960s, (South) Korea enjoyed democracy. My father joined the diplomatic corps. But one day, tanks rolled and a coup d&#x27;état toppled the government, leaving us to grow up in America.

After the coup, Koh&#x27;s father, legal scholar and diplomat Kwang Lim Koh, was granted asylum in the United States. He moved to New Haven, Connecticut, with his family and took a teaching position at Yale. His wife, Hesung Chun Koh (Harold Koh&#x27;s mother), had a Ph.D. in sociology and taught at Yale as well—they were the first Asian Americans to teach there.

Harold was struck by polio at age six; he went through &quot;two operations, leg braces, and endless rehabilitation&quot; and as a result still walks with a limp.

Koh has six siblings. Howard Koh—a Harvard University public health professor and former Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner—previously served as the United States Assistant Secretary for Health in the Obama administration. His sister Jean Koh Peters also teaches at Yale Law School.

Koh&#x27;s wife, Mary-Christy Fisher, is an attorney employed by the Connecticut Veterans Legal Center; they have two children.

==Education==
Koh graduated in 1971 from the Hopkins School in New Haven, then graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard University in 1975 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in government, before studying at Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar. He later earned a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1980, where he was an editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot;.

In June 2024, Koh received an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Toronto in recognition of his commitment to the public interest and his advocacy for the rule of law and human rights.

==Early career and scholarship==
After law school, Koh was a law clerk for Judge Malcolm Richard Wilkey of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1980 to 1981 and for U.S. Supreme Court justice Harry Blackmun 1981 to 1982. In 1982 and 1983, he worked as an associate at Covington &amp; Burling. From 1983 to 1985, Koh worked as an attorney-adviser to the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the United States Department of Justice during the Reagan Administration.

He joined the Yale Law School faculty in 1985. His students have included John Yoo, with whom he co-authored a paper on &quot;Dollar Diplomacy/Dollar Defense: The Fabric of Economics and National Security Law.&quot; Since 1993 he has been the Gerard C. and Bernice Latrobe Smith Professor of International Law; he became the law school&#x27;s 15th dean in 2004. From 1985 to 1991, Koh largely devoted himself to writing and teaching. A notable paper Koh wrote was a November 1990 legal brief challenging the first president Bush&#x27;s contention that he could fight the Gulf War on his own authority. Koh argued that &quot;the Constitution requires the president to &#x27;consult with Congress and receive its affirmative authorization — not merely present it with — before engaging in war.&#x27;&quot;

In 1992–93, he led a group of Yale students and human rights lawyers in litigation against the United States government to free Haitian refugees interned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. As chronicled in Brandt Goldstein&#x27;s book, &quot;Storming the Court&quot; (Scribner 2005), Koh and the plaintiffs prevailed in the case, &quot;Haitian Centers Council v. Sale&quot;, and the Haitians were released in the spring of 1993. At the same time, Koh and his team of law students argued a related case &quot;Sale v. Haitian Centers Council&quot; (1993) before the U.S. Supreme Court but the court ruled against them on an 8–1 vote.

Koh is the author of nine books, including &quot;The National Security Constitution: Sharing Power after the Iran-Contra Affair&quot; (Yale University Press,1990); &quot;Transnational Legal Problems&quot; (with Harry Steiner and Detlev Vagts, Foundation Press, 1994); &quot;Deliberative Democracy and Human Rights&quot; (with Ronald C. Slye, Yale University Press, 1999); &quot;Transnational Litigation in United States Courts&quot; (Foundation Press, 2008); and &quot;The National Security Constitution in the Twenty-First Century&quot; (Yale University Press, 2024). He has also written over 175 law review articles and legal editorials. He is a prominent advocate of human rights and civil rights; he has argued and written briefs on a wide number of cases before U.S. appellate courts, and has testified before the U.S. Congress more than a dozen times. He has received numerous awards, medals, and honorary degrees.

Blogger David Lat and George Mason professor David Bernstein (contributing to the Volokh Conspiracy), have described Koh as a &quot;highly partisan Democrat&quot; and claim that he has politically polarized Yale Law School during his tenure as dean. Other observers countered that during his tenure prominent conservatives have been appointed to the Yale Law School faculty, and noted that Koh served in both Republican (Reagan) and Democratic (Clinton) administrations. A group of Yale Conservative Law Students offered a vigorous defense of Koh, noting that &quot;Dean Koh has been very supportive of conservative students and conservative student organizations.&quot;

They concluded that &quot;Dean Koh is one of the brightest legal minds of his generation, a credit to the profession we look forward to joining, and an able and effective public servant.&quot; On May 4, 2010, the Friends of the Law Library of the Library of Congress presented Koh with their annual award named for George W. Wickersham.

==Law reform work==
Koh was elected to the American Law Institute in 1992 and was elected to the ALI Council in 2007. He stepped down from the Council when he worked for the Obama administration, but was re-elected to Council when he ended his tenure with the State Department and returned to Yale. He currently serves as a Counselor on the Restatement Fourth, the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, and previously served as an Adviser on the Principles of Transnational Civil Procedure project.

==State Department Legal Adviser==
===Nomination and confirmation===
On March 23, 2009, the White House announced Koh&#x27;s nomination as Legal Adviser to the State Department in the Obama administration, the senior legal adviser to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. His nomination was generally supported in the Senate and among legal colleagues. The nomination drew criticism from some conservative commentators for his views on international law and its use in American legal analysis and jurisprudence, while drawing support from other conservatives such as Ted Olson and Kenneth Starr as well as &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine.

Koh has written in support of the practice of using tenets of international law and foreign legal precedent to inform the deliberative process of judicial decision making in the United States, and has described what he has called &quot;transnational jurisprudence&quot; as essential to maintaining a well-ordered international legal system. Arguing that &quot;concepts like liberty, equality and privacy are not exclusively American constitutional ideas but, rather, part and parcel of the global human rights movement&quot; Koh has traced the influence of decisions from foreign courts throughout the history of the U.S. Supreme Court and the American court system.

Critics of this approach argue that citing foreign decisions as legal precedents threatens American sovereignty and &quot;lends itself to manipulation.&quot; Other commentators have observed that the &quot;use of such nonbinding sources to bolster legal arguments is a central and uncontroversial tenet of the American judicial process.&quot;

On May 12, 2009, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations voted 12–5 in favor of Koh. After a hold was placed on his nomination, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on June 22, 2009, that he would invoke cloture on the nomination. On June 24, 2009, the Senate voted 65–31 to end debate on the nomination, paving the way for a full Senate vote the following day. The following day, Koh was confirmed by the Senate in a 62–35 vote. While working in government, Koh took a leave of absence from Yale Law School.

===Views on targeted killing===

In a March 2010 speech, Koh voiced his strong support for the legality of targeted killing by aerial drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and other countries included by the U.S. government as being within the scope of the war on terror. The State Department&#x27;s legal adviser said that &quot;U.S. targeting practices, including lethal operations conducted with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)&quot;, which the Obama administration has leaned on heavily in its efforts to eliminate al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups in Asia, &quot;comply with all applicable law, including the laws of war&quot;, citing the principles of distinction and proportionality. He said that the U.S. adheres to these standards, and takes great care in the &quot;planning and execution to ensure that only legitimate objectives are targeted, and that collateral damage is kept to a minimum.&quot;

He said the U.S. is in &quot;an armed conflict with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the associated forces&quot;, and therefore has the lawful right to use force to protect its citizens &quot;consistent with its inherent right to self-defense&quot; under international law. Koh identified three elements that the U.S. considers when determining whether to authorize a specific targeted drone killing:

*Imminence of the threat;
*Sovereignty of other States involved; and
*Willingness and ability of those States to suppress the threat the target poses.

He also said that the drone strikes against al-Qaeda and its allies were lawful targeted killing, as part of the military action authorized by Congress, and not assassination, which is banned by executive order. Under domestic law, U.S. targeted killings against 9/11-related entities is authorized by the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. The speech earned praise from the editorial board of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Koh&#x27;s views on targeted killings have been criticized by analysts who have stressed the inconsistency between his critique of Bush&#x27;s War on Terror policy and his later views on law and counterterrorism.

Koh was also criticized by lawyer Jennifer Robinson, who represents activist Julian Assange, for addressing a letter to both her and her client. Robinson felt this was in breach of legal custom.

===Resignation===
On December 7, 2012, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Koh was poised to leave his job at the State Department and return to Yale Law School in January 2013 as a law professor.

<doc id="1240576" wikidata="Q5381158" url="?curid=1240576" title="Environmental Quality Improvement Act">
<text>The Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970 is a United States environmental law which was passed to work in conjunction with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). One of the two major purposes of the Act was to authorize the creation of an Office of Environmental Quality to provide the professional and administrative staff needed for the Council on Environmental Quality. The second major purpose was to &quot;assure that each Federal department and agency conducting or supporting public works activities which affect the environment shall implement the policies under existing law&quot;. To accomplish these purposes, the act gave more responsibilities to the chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality in his new role as director of the Office of Environmental Quality.

==Legislative history==
The Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970 started out as H.R. 4148 in the U.S. House of Representatives Public Works Committee in April 1970. It was taken up by the U.S. Senate Public Works Committee in October 1969 and went to a joint conference between the houses in March 1969. The bill passed the Senate with a vote of 80 to 0 on March 24 and the House on March 25 with a vote of 358 to 0. The lack of any nay votes shows there was broad support for the passage of this bill.

The bill also had six amendments from the years 1973 to 1984 but the amendments mostly dealt with providing additional funding in various years over the amount specified by NEPA. The amounts ranged from a low of an additional $44,000.00/year for 1982–1984 to a high of $3,000,000/year additional funds for 1980 and 1981. Besides providing additional funds, Pub. L. 98-581 (10-30-1984) amended the Environmental Quality Improvement Act to create a fund called the Office of Environmental Quality Management Fund (42 US Code 4375(a)). The fund was established to finance study contracts that are sponsored by both the OEQ and at least one other Federal agency. The fund can also fund Federal Interagency environmental projects such as a task force that the OEQ is participating in. The fund is allowed to receive advance payments from other agencies to finance the proposed study, project or activity.

==Major provisions==
In Section 4372 (a), (b), and (c) of the act, the Office of Environmental Quality (OEQ) is established as an office within the Executive Office of the President of the United States with the chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) as the director of the OEQ. In addition, the president of the United States also picks a deputy director for the OEQ who is also to be approved by the Senate. While the director is allowed to employ the number of people he may need to carry out the work of the OEQ, he is limited to hiring only ten specialists or experts. These specialists or experts also cannot be paid more than a GS-18 pay scale. The function of the OEQ is to provide support for the CEQ and to help the director carry out his new duties as given in Section 4372 (d). The OEQ and the CEQ are simply known jointly as the Council on Environmental Quality and there is not a separate listing for the OEQ within the Office of the President or a separate website from the CEQ.

Another major area in the Environmental Quality Improvement Act was the creation of six new duties or functions given to the director of OEQ. Besides the director fulfilling the duties to the President of the United States and the CEQ under NEPA, the director had to make sure that the following provisions of U.S. Code 4372 (d) 2-7 were carried out as well:.

4372 (d ) 2: assisting the Federal agencies and departments in appraising the effectiveness of existing and proposed facilities, programs, policies, and activities of the Federal Government, and those specific major projects designated by the president which do not require individual project authorization by Congress, which affect environmental quality;

4372 (d) 3: reviewing the adequacy of existing systems for monitoring and predicting environmental changes in order to achieve effective coverage and efficient use of research facilities and other resources;

4372 (d) 4: promoting the advancement of scientific knowledge of the effects of actions and technology on the environment and encourage the development of the means to prevent or reduce adverse effects that endanger the health and well-being of man;

4372 (d) 5: assisting in coordinating among the Federal departments and agencies those programs and activities which affect, protect, and improve environmental quality;

4372 (d) 6: assisting the Federal departments and agencies in the development and interrelationship of environmental quality criteria and standards established through the Federal Government;

and 4372 (d) 7: collecting, collating, analyzing, and interpreting data and information on environmental quality, ecological research, and evaluation.

The last major provision is that the annual Environmental Quality Report required by NEPA (Public Law 91-190) will be sent to each standing committee that has jurisdiction over any part that might be contained in the report. The Environmental Quality Report, as described in NEPA, relates the status and condition of air, aquatic, and terrestrial environments, future and current trends in regards to those environments, how adequate those resources are for providing our economic needs, a review of significant activities all levels of governments, other entities, and individuals are doing in the area of conservation, effect on the environment, and in developing natural resources, and also how existing programs that are lacking will be improved along with recommendations for legislation. The preparation of this report would be an example of one of the duties from NEPA that the director of the OEQ would be responsible for as well.

==Impact==
As part of the duties given to the director by this act, the staff of the OEQ works on many guidances and notices that assist federal agencies and entities with implementing policy on environmental issues. Some recent examples are:

Final Guidance on Improving the Process for Preparing Efficient and Timely Environmental Reviews Under the National Environmental Policy Act – the guidance goes over crucial techniques that agencies are not fully employing in preparing environmental reviews. These environmental reviews (environmental impact assessments and environmental assessments) are important in understanding the environmental impact and what can be done to mitigate it.

Final Guidance, &quot;Federal Greenhouse Gas Accounting and Reporting&quot; – This is the final notice to agencies to help them comply with an annual accounting for Greenhouse Gases as required by Executive Order #13514. The purpose of the annual accounting is to gauge over a number of years if an agency&#x27;s reduction plan for greenhouse gases is effective. It also notes there will be revisions to this guidance as better techniques are created.

Instructions for Implementing Sustainable Locations for Federal Facilities in Accordance With Executive Order 13514 – This gives agencies directions on how to incorporate principles of sustainable locations into the decision making process for where a building should be built or leased. A building that fits in with future regional transportation plans, is near public transport, and is in a pedestrian friendly area would have a more sustainable location.

As noted in Section 4374 (d)5, one of the duties of the director and OEQ is assisting with other agencies in activities that will help improve, protect, and affect environmental quality. An example of this is the chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, Nancy Sutley (the director of OEQ as well), chaired an Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force that among other things looked into effective coastal and marine spatial planning. Another employee of the OEQ also served on the steering committee of this task force to help coordinate its activities.

<text>Acer macrophyllum, the bigleaf maple or Oregon maple, is a large deciduous tree in the genus &quot;Acer&quot;. It is native to western North America. In addition to uses by animals, it is of some culinary and woodworking interest.

==Description==
Bigleaf maple can grow up to tall, but more commonly reaches tall and . The species&#x27; current national champion for size is located in Lane County, Oregon. It is tall with a crown spread of , with an average diameter at breast height (dbh) of about . The previous national champion is located in Marion, Oregon, and is tall with a crown spread of , with an average dbh of about . The bark is gray brown, darkening and developing ridges with age.

The bigleaf maple has the largest leaves of any maple, typically across with five deeply incised palmate lobes, with the largest running to . The stems are long and contain milky sap. In autumn, the leaves turn gold and yellow, contrasting against backdrops of evergreen conifers.
In spring, the tree produces flowers in pendulous racemes long, greenish-yellow with inconspicuous petals. It is hermaphroditic, bearing both male and female flowers in each raceme. The flowers appear in early spring, before the leaves.
The fruit is a paired winged samara, each seed in diameter with a wing. Bigleaf maple begins bearing seed at about ten years of age.

In May 2018 the oldest two Oregon maples in Europe, 175 years old, were removed from Trinity College Dublin (TCD), Ireland. The first had an interior which was beginning to rot, and it fell after inclement windy weather. The second, also infected, was cut down as the same fate was expected. Both were in the adjoining grassy area which was originally the cemetery of All Hallows and is now the Front Square of TCD.

=== Chemistry ===
The fallen leaves, blossoms, and seeds are concentrated with potassium, calcium, and other nutrients.

==Distribution and habitat==
Bigleaf maple mostly occurs near North America&#x27;s Pacific coast, west of British Columbia&#x27;s Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range, from southernmost Alaska to southern California. Some stands are also found inland in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada of central California, and a tiny population occurs in central Idaho.

It usually grows from sea level to elevations of , and more exceptionally . It can form pure stands on moist soils in proximity to streams, but is generally found within riparian hardwood forests or dispersed, (under or within), relatively open canopies of conifers, mixed evergreens, or oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.) In cool and moist temperate mixed woods they are one of the dominant species. Though very rare north of Vancouver Island, it is cultivated in Prince Rupert, near Ketchikan, and in Juneau.

==Ecology==
The tree can live in a wide range of habitats, but thrives in fairly well-hydrated hardwood forests, occurring with red alder, black cottonwood, and willows. It is fairly shade tolerant, but not as much so as vine maple, and benefits from disturbances.
It is not considered to be fire-resistant due to its thin bark, but large trees with thick bark may survive moderate fires. Along with red alder, bigleaf maple often dominates early postfire succession in Douglas-fir forests, and fire can increase its forest presence. It spreads and grows vegetatively from cuttings and stumps of any size in a prolific manner.

Insects fertilize the tree&#x27;s flowers. The winged fruits are eaten by squirrels, and by grosbeaks in the winter. Deer mice have been observed consuming bigleaf maple seeds in the spring in the Sierra Nevada. The foliage is browsed by ungulates such as black-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and horses, as well as by mountain beavers and other rodents.
A western Oregon study found that 60% of bigleaf maple seedlings over tall had been browsed by deer, most several times.

Bigleaf maple is preferred as habitat by the barred owl, an invasive species to coast range habitat, and the presence of the tree is positively associated with Hammond&#x27;s flycatchers.

In the wetter parts of its range, such as in the Olympic National Park and lowland forest around Puget Sound, the bark is often covered with epiphytes such as club moss and licorice fern&quot;.&quot;

Older trees suffer from heart rot.

== Cultivars ==
Cultivars are plants sourced and/or bred for specific characteristics that are deemed to be attractive and/or commercializable to the mainstream public. Given the opportunity, cultivars will near-universally cross with their native counterparts, which brings a risk of contamination to local genetic stock that can be a challenge to identify. Examples of cultivars include:
*&#x27;Mocha Rose&#x27; — foliage in various shades of pink over growing season; red flowers
*&#x27;Santiam Snows&#x27; — green leaves speckled with white
*&#x27;Seattle Sentinel&#x27; — upright, columnar plant habit

==Uses==
Native Americans grew sprouts from the seeds for consumption, wove baskets from the inner bark, and used the leaves to cover food in cooking pits. They also carved the wood into dishes, utensils, and canoe paddles.

Maple syrup has been made from the sap of bigleaf maple trees. While the sugar concentration is about the same as in &quot;Acer saccharum&quot; (sugar maple), the flavor is somewhat different. Interest in commercially producing syrup from bigleaf maple sap has been limited. Although not traditionally used for syrup production, it takes about 40 volumes of sap to produce 1 volume of maple syrup.

The buds of the tree are also considered edible. They are often fried and made into fritters. 

===Lumber===
The bigleaf maple is the only commercially important maple of the Pacific Coast region.

The wood is primarily used in veneer production for furniture, but is also used in musical instrument production (including piano frames), interior paneling, and other hardwood products; the heartwood is light reddish-brown, fine-grained, moderately heavy, and fairly robust. It sometimes shows a quilted figure.

In California, land managers do not highly value bigleaf maples, and they are often intentionally knocked over and left unharvested during harvests for Douglas fir and redwood stands.

<doc id="1240586" wikidata="Q4993151" url="?curid=1240586" title="Merkur Scorpio">
<text>The Merkur Scorpio is a mid-size luxury car that was marketed by the Lincoln-Mercury division of Ford for the 1988 and 1989 model years through its Merkur sub-brand. Marketed above the Merkur XR4Ti in the model line, the Scorpio served as the brand&#x27;s flagship. As a captive import from Ford of Europe, selected Lincoln-Mercury dealers marketed the Scorpio in the United States and Canada.

A near-direct counterpart of the Ford Scorpio Mk I (Ford Granada Mk III in the United Kingdom), the Merkur Scorpio was developed to give Lincoln-Mercury a competitor against European executive cars sold in North America, including the Audi 100, BMW 5-series, Mercedes-Benz 190E, Saab 9000, Sterling 827, and Volvo 740/760.

Following the 1989 model year, Ford ended imports of the Scorpio, closing down the Merkur brand. Lasting only for two model years, the Merkur Scorpio is among the shortest-lived Ford Motor Company nameplates in modern history. Along with unstable pricing due to fluctuating exchange rates and insufficient sales figures, the model line would have required a costly redesign to remain in compliance with upcoming American safety regulations.

The Scorpio was manufactured in Cologne, West Germany, by Ford of Germany (Cologne Body &amp; Assembly). In total, 22,010 examples were imported.

== Model overview ==
While offered as a five-door hatchback, the Merkur Scorpio was similar in appearance to the Mercury Sable. In comparison to the first-generation (1986-1991) Mercury Sable, the Scorpio was 4.5 inches shorter in length (2 inches shorter than the Ford Taurus), 1.3 inches narrower, and 2.7 inches longer in wheelbase; the two models were nearly identical in height.

Styled as a fastback, the Merkur Scorpio provided Lincoln-Mercury an opportunity to market a premium alternative to its traditional Lincoln Continental and Lincoln Town Car sedans with (far) better road manners.

=== Chassis specification ===
The Merkur Scorpio shares its rear-wheel drive Ford DE-1 chassis with its Ford namesake, configured as a long-wheelbase version of the Ford Sierra (extended from 102.7 inches to 108.7 inches).

In contrast to American-designed rear-wheel drive Ford chassis (i.e. Fox, Panther), the DE-1 platform was fitted with four-wheel independent suspension. In one of the first vehicles sold in North America, the Merkur Scorpio was equipped with standard anti-lock brakes (ABS) and four-wheel disc brakes. Within Ford Motor Company, the latter two features were previously exclusive to the Lincoln Mark VII.

In contrast to the XR4Ti, the Merkur Scorpio was fitted with a specific engine for North America. The model line was fitted exclusively with a 144hp 2.9L V6 (the largest engine of the Ford Scorpio). Shared with the Ford Ranger/Bronco II, the V6 was paired with a standard 5-speed manual transmission; a 4-speed overdrive automatic was offered as an option. 

=== Body ===
In contrast to many of its European counterparts, the Scorpio was offered solely as a five-door hatchback (a sedan was not introduced until 1990). As with the Mercury Sable sedan, the Scorpio was designed with blacked-out B and C-pillars for a &quot;floating-roof&quot; effect). Closer in style to the Ford Taurus, the front fascia was designed with a minimal front grille opening.

While less extensive than the redevelopment of the XR4Ti, several changes were made to distinguish the Merkur Scorpio from its Ford counterpart. The rear fascia is unique to Merkur, styled with a full-width taillamp lens (similar to the Mercury Sable). With the exception of divisional badging, the front fascia was largely unchanged; Merkurs are fitted with modified foglamps and headlamps (in compliance with American lighting regulations). Along with standard two-tone lower body trim, the Merkur Scorpio received its own model-specific alloy wheels.

Sharing much of its interior with the Ford Scorpio, the Merkur Scorpio was solely offered in a five-passenger configuration. In contrast to the Sable (or the Lincoln Continental or Town Car), the Scorpio was offered with power-reclining rear seats and a tilt-telescope steering column.

== Pricing ==
At its launch, the Merkur Scorpio was sold with a base price of $23,390 (). Options included automatic transmission, power moonroof and Touring Package. Most North American Scorpios were sold with automatic transmission and the Touring Package which raised the sticker price to $26,405 (). Although smaller in size, the Scorpio rivaled the Lincoln Town Car in price.

To attract customers to the model line, Lincoln-Mercury offered potential Scorpio customers a Guaranteed Resale Value Program, matching the resale value of the Scorpio to the Mercedes-Benz 190E.

== Discontinuation ==
On October 20, 1989, Ford announced it was ending imports of the Scorpio to the United States. As the XR4Ti had ended sales earlier in the year, the decision effectively closed Merkur; lasting only two model years longer than Edsel, it is among the shortest-lived American car brands in postwar history.

Coinciding with lower than anticipated sales (Ford had sought 15,000 sales a year for the brand), Merkur fell victim to unstable exchange rates between the dollar and German mark, leading to increases in price. As passive safety regulations were to be adopted in 1990, the Scorpio was required to adopt automatic seatbelts or airbag(s). The Ford Scorpio was developed with neither feature and passive safety compliance proved too expensive to justify the conversion cost of redeveloping the slow-selling model line for North American sale.

Following the discontinuation of the Merkur Scorpio, Ford of Europe expanded the Granada/Scorpio range by introducing a sedan model at the beginning of 1990 and a wagon model two years later. The Scorpio MkI was produced until 1994.

<doc id="1240590" wikidata="Q17060142" url="?curid=1240590" title="Kalesa">
<text>A kalesa (Philippine Spanish: calesa), is a two-wheeled horse-drawn carriage used in the Philippines. It is commonly vividly painted and decorated. It was the primary mode of public and private transport in the Philippines during the Spanish and the American colonial period. Their use declined with the increasing use of motorized vehicles in the 20th century, until the kalesas stopped being viable in the 1980s. In modern times, they largely only survive as tourist attractions, such as in Vigan, Ilocos Sur.

Kalesas have other names based on the number of passengers they can seat. Small kalesas which can carry one or two passengers in front-facing seats are known as karomata or karumata. Larger kalesas which carry freight or up to six or more passengers in side-facing seats are known as karitela or karetela (also tartanilla in Cebu). However, these terms have become interchangeable over time. Four-wheeled carriages are differentiated as karwahe.

== Description ==

The kalesa looks like a two-wheeled inclined cart, and is drawn by a single horse. It is made from wood, metal, or a combination of both. The kalesa driver commonly called as &quot;kutsero&quot; (Spanish &quot;cochero&quot;) sits on the driver&#x27;s seat in front. Both the driver and the passengers are enclosed by a canopy originating from the back of the cab. Kalesa had specific terminology for drivers. When a &quot;kutsero&quot; wants the horse to turn right, he says &quot;&quot;mano&quot; while he says &quot;silla&quot;&quot; to make the horse turn left.

Kalesas can be differentiated by the number of passengers they can seat. Small kalesas which can carry one or two passengers in front-facing seats are known as karomata or karumata (Philippine Spanish: ). Karomatas had the barest of conveniences and charged the lowest rates, which led to them being characterized as the &quot;commoner&#x27;s carriage&quot;. Larger kalesas that carry freight or up to six passengers in side-facing seats are known as karitela or karetela (Philippine Spanish: ). Karitelas were widely used by small businesses for cheap cargo transport. These terms have become interchangeable over time. In Cebu, karitelas are known as tartanilla. In modern versions, they can seat eight to ten people. They remain an iconic form of transport in Cebu City.

Large four-wheeled versions of the kalesa were known as karwahe (Philippine Spanish: ); while drays drawn by carabao (usually used to transport cargo) were known as garetas or kareton (Spanish &quot;carretón&quot;).

==History==


Kalesa (from Spanish calesa) were first introduced to the Philippines in the 1700s by the Spanish. They became the primary mode of public and private transportation in the islands. They were manufactured by traditional workshops known as . The fodder used to feed the horses were known as , the production of which was also its own significant industry due to the prevalence of kalesas.

Use of the kalesa continued during the American colonial period of the Philippines (1898 to 1946), where they remained the main form of cheap public transport. The American colonial government attempted to introduce rickshaws in 1902 to augment the public transport in Manila, but this was met with resistance by the unionized kalesa drivers (the ) who characterized rickshaws as “making beasts of human beings”. As a result, rickshaws never gained acceptance in the Philippines.

The American colonial government also started the motorization of public transport in the early 20th century, introducing automobiles like jeepneys (&quot;auto calesas&quot;) and buses (&quot;autobuses&quot;) as well as the expansion of the Tranvía electric tram lines (operated by Meralco). These new motorized vehicles competed directly with the kalesas, and the motorized and horse-drawn sectors of public transport were often in conflict. New ordinances were created that restricted the movement of horse-drawn vehicles in favor of motorized transport. Despite this, the kalesas flourished well into the mid-20th century, due to their much more flexible routes, their cheapness, and the significant political power of the unions. The political weight of the unions was referred to in contemporary media as the &quot; vote&quot; and was regarded as synonymous to the voting power of the lower classes. It included the low-income working class and small businesses who relied on the kalesas for both personal transport and delivery of goods. The &quot; vote&quot; had a strong influence in elections, allowing kalesas to avoid most attempts at changing traffic regulations. In the late 1930s, there were still an estimated 7000 kalesas operating in Manila alone.

In 1939, the government proposed measures in a series of public hearings to abolish the kalesas to solve the worsening traffic problems they caused. The strongest proposal to emerge was the immediate buyout of the , with the possibility of retraining them as automobile drivers. This was met with mass protests from the unions which led to the abandonment of these proposals. However, an increasing number of other measures were taken, including a ban on the creation of new kalesa terminals and bans on kalesas from entering certain busy streets or parking near markets.

During World War II, from 1941 to 1945, kalesas survived and provided much-needed services during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. They were also still in use in the postwar years, but they were already in decline and had lost their previous political clout. More restrictions to road access by kalesas were introduced by the 1960s, restricting them to side roads. A few kalesas survived up until the late 1980s before becoming effectively nonviable as a form of public transport in Metro Manila. There were a few kalesas still in use as short-haul public transport around Binondo, Manila, in the 1990s to the 2000s; but they too were replaced by the 2010s with pedicabs, kuliligs, tricycles, and electric tricycles (electric rickshaw and mobility scooters). 

The kalesa in modern times are largely only used as tourist attractions. Tourist kalesas are common in historical colonial-era sites in the Philippines, such as in San Fernando, Pampanga, Vigan and Laoag. Kalesas can also be found in Intramuros, where they cater to tourists and Binondo in Manila, as well as in Iligan, where decorated kalesas can be taken for a ride along a specific street.

Kalesas still being used as public transport survive in only a few areas of the Philippines. In Cebu, karitela-type kalesas, locally known as tartanillas, are still in operation, though they are gradually fading out. Kalesas are also still common as public transport in Cagayan, especially in Tuao, Tuguegarao, and other municipalities of the province.

==Legacy==
Two modern motorized public transport vehicles in the Philippines are named after the kalesa: the jeepney, which was originally known as the &quot;auto &quot; (or &quot;AC&quot; for short) from the 1910s to the 1940s; and the motorela of Northern Mindanao, a portmanteau of &quot;motorized&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

The colorful decorations of the kalesa was also inherited by the post-World War II jeepney. The horse hood ornament of most jeepneys is also a tribute to its kalesa predecessor.

==In popular culture==
Composer Ambrosio Del Rosario composed the original music and National Artist of the Philippines Levi Celério wrote the lyrics for a song entitled &quot;Kalesa&quot;, in honor of the vehicle.

An annual Kalesa Parade is held during the Binatbatan Festival of the Arts of Vigan City.

<text>A thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT LCD) is a type of liquid-crystal display that uses thin-film-transistor technology to improve image qualities such as addressability and contrast. A TFT LCD is an active matrix LCD, in contrast to passive matrix LCDs or simple, direct-driven (i.e. with segments directly connected to electronics outside the LCD) LCDs with a few segments.

TFT LCDs are used in television sets, computer monitors, mobile phones, video game systems, personal digital assistants, navigation systems, projectors, and dashboards in some automobiles and in medium to high end motorcycles.

==History==
In February 1957, John Wallmark of RCA filed a patent for a thin film MOSFET. Paul K. Weimer, also of RCA, implemented Wallmark&#x27;s ideas and developed the thin-film transistor (TFT) in 1962, a type of MOSFET distinct from the standard bulk MOSFET. It was made with thin films of cadmium selenide and cadmium sulfide.

The idea of a TFT-based liquid-crystal display (LCD) was conceived by Bernard Lechner of RCA Laboratories in 1968. In 1971, Lechner, F. J. Marlowe, E. O. Nester and J. Tults demonstrated a 2-by-18 matrix display driven by a hybrid circuit using the dynamic scattering mode of LCDs. In 1973, T. Peter Brody, J. A. Asars and G. D. Dixon at Westinghouse Research Laboratories developed a CdSe (cadmium selenide) TFT, which they used to demonstrate the first CdSe thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT LCD). Brody and Fang-Chen Luo demonstrated the first flat active-matrix liquid-crystal display (AM LCD) using CdSe TFTs in 1974, and then Brody coined the term &quot;active matrix&quot; in 1975.

By 2013, most modern high-resolution and high-quality electronic visual display devices used TFT-based active matrix displays.

As of 2024, TFT LCD displays are still dominant, but compete with OLED for high brightness and high resolution displays, and compete with electronic paper for low power displays.

==Construction==
The liquid crystal displays used in calculators and other devices with similarly simple displays have direct-driven image elements, and therefore a voltage can be easily applied across just one segment of these types of displays without interfering with the other segments. This would be impractical for a large display, because it would have a large number of (color) picture elements (pixels), and thus it would require millions of connections, both top and bottom for each one of the three colors (red, green and blue) of every pixel. To avoid this issue, the pixels are addressed in rows and columns, reducing the connection count from millions down to thousands. The column and row wires attach to transistor switches, one for each pixel. The one-way current passing characteristic of the transistor prevents the charge that is being applied to each pixel from being drained between refreshes to a display&#x27;s image. Each pixel is a small capacitor with a layer of insulating liquid crystal sandwiched between transparent conductive layers of indium tin oxide (ITO).

The circuit layout process of a TFT-LCD is very similar to that of semiconductor products. However, rather than fabricating the transistors from silicon, that is formed into a crystalline silicon wafer, they are made from a thin film of amorphous silicon that is deposited on a glass panel. The silicon layer for TFT-LCDs is typically deposited using the PECVD process. Transistors take up only a small fraction of the area of each pixel and the rest of the silicon film is etched away to allow light to easily pass through it.

Polycrystalline silicon is sometimes used in displays that require higher TFT performance. Examples include small high-resolution displays such as those found in projectors or viewfinders. Amorphous silicon-based TFTs are by far the most common, due to their lower production cost, whereas polycrystalline silicon TFTs are more costly and much more difficult to produce.

==Types==

===Twisted nematic (TN)===

The twisted nematic (TN) display is one of the oldest and frequently cheapest kind of liquid crystal display technologies. TN displays have fast pixel response times and less smearing than other types of LCDs like IPS displays, but suffer from poor color reproduction and limited viewing angles, especially in the vertical direction. When viewed at an angle that is not perpendicular to the display, colors will shift, sometimes to the point of completely inverting. Modern, high end consumer products have developed methods to overcome the technology&#x27;s shortcomings, such as RTC (Response Time Compensation / Overdrive) technologies. Modern TN displays can look significantly better than older TN displays from decades earlier, but overall TN has inferior viewing angles and poor color in comparison to other technology like IPS.

Most TN panels can represent colors using only six bits per RGB channel, or 18 bit in total, and are unable to display the 16.7 million color shades (24-bit truecolor) that are available using 24-bit color. Instead, these panels display interpolated 24-bit color using a dithering method that combines adjacent pixels to simulate the desired shade. They can also use a form of temporal dithering called Frame Rate Control (FRC), which cycles between different shades with each new frame to simulate an intermediate shade. Such 18 bit panels with dithering are sometimes advertised as having &quot;16.2 million colors&quot;. These color simulation methods are noticeable to many people and highly bothersome to some. FRC tends to be most noticeable in darker tones, while dithering appears to make the individual pixels of the LCD visible. Overall, color reproduction and linearity on TN panels is poor. Shortcomings in display color gamut (often referred to as a percentage of the NTSC 1953 color gamut) are also due to backlighting technology. It is common for older displays to range from 10% to 26% of the NTSC color gamut, whereas other kind of displays, utilizing more complicated CCFL or LED phosphor formulations or RGB LED backlights, may extend past 100% of the NTSC color gamut, a difference that is easily seen by the human eye.

The transmittance of a pixel of an LCD panel typically does not change linearly with the applied voltage, and the sRGB standard for computer monitors requires a specific nonlinear dependence of the amount of emitted light as a function of the RGB value.

===In-plane switching (IPS)===

In-plane switching (IPS) was developed by Hitachi in 1996 to improve on the poor viewing angle and the poor color reproduction of TN panels at that time. Its name comes from the main difference from TN panels, that the crystal molecules move parallel to the panel plane instead of perpendicular to it. This change reduces the amount of light scattering in the matrix, which gives IPS its characteristic wide viewing angles and good color reproduction.

Initial iterations of IPS technology were characterised by slow response time and a low contrast ratio but later revisions have made marked improvements to these shortcomings. Because of its wide viewing angle and accurate color reproduction (with almost no off-angle color shift), IPS is widely employed in high-end monitors aimed at professional graphic artists, although with the recent fall in price it has been seen in the mainstream market as well. IPS technology was sold to Panasonic by Hitachi.

===Advanced fringe field switching (AFFS)===
This is an LCD technology derived from the IPS by Boe-Hydis of Korea. Known as fringe field switching (FFS) until 2003, advanced fringe field switching is a technology similar to IPS or S-IPS offering superior performance and color gamut with high luminosity. Color shift and deviation caused by light leakage is corrected by optimizing the white gamut, which also enhances white/grey reproduction. AFFS is developed by Hydis Technologies Co., Ltd, Korea (formally Hyundai Electronics, LCD Task Force).

In 2004, Hydis Technologies Co., Ltd licensed its AFFS patent to Japan&#x27;s Hitachi Displays. Hitachi is using AFFS to manufacture high end panels in their product line. In 2006, Hydis also licensed its AFFS to Sanyo Epson Imaging Devices Corporation.

Hydis introduced AFFS+ which improved outdoor readability in 2007.

===Multi-domain vertical alignment (MVA)===
It achieved pixel response which was fast for its time, wide viewing angles, and high contrast at the cost of brightness and color reproduction. Modern MVA panels can offer wide viewing angles (second only to S-IPS technology), good black depth, good color reproduction and depth, and fast response times due to the use of RTC (Response Time Compensation) technologies. When MVA panels are viewed off-perpendicular, colors will shift, but much less than for TN panels.

There are several &quot;next-generation&quot; technologies based on MVA, including AU Optronics&#x27; P-MVA and AMVA, as well as Chi Mei Optoelectronics&#x27; S-MVA.

===Patterned vertical alignment (PVA)===

Less expensive PVA panels often use dithering and FRC, whereas super-PVA (S-PVA) panels all use at least 8 bits per color component and do not use color simulation methods.S-PVA also largely eliminated off-angle glowing of solid blacks and reduced the off-angle gamma shift. Some high-end Sony BRAVIA LCD TVs offer 10-bit and xvYCC color support, for example, the Bravia X4500 series. S-PVA also offers fast response times using modern RTC technologies.

===Advanced super view (ASV)===
Advanced super view, also called &quot;axially symmetric vertical alignment&quot; was developed by Sharp. It is a VA mode where liquid crystal molecules orient perpendicular to the substrates in the off state. The bottom sub-pixel has continuously covered electrodes, while the upper one has a smaller area electrode in the center of the subpixel.

When the field is on, the liquid crystal molecules start to tilt towards the center of the sub-pixels because of the electric field; as a result, a continuous pinwheel alignment (CPA) is formed; the azimuthal angle rotates 360 degrees continuously resulting in an excellent viewing angle. The ASV mode is also called CPA mode.

===Plane line switching (PLS)===

A technology developed by Samsung is Super PLS, which bears similarities to IPS panels, has wider viewing angles, better image quality, increased brightness, and lower production costs. PLS technology debuted in the PC display market with the release of the Samsung S27A850 and S24A850 monitors in September 2011.

===TFT dual-transistor pixel (DTP) or cell technology===

TFT dual-transistor pixel or cell technology is a reflective-display technology for use in very-low-power-consumption applications such as electronic shelf labels (ESL), digital watches, or metering. DTP involves adding a secondary transistor gate in the single TFT cell to maintain the display of a pixel during a period of 1s without loss of image or without degrading the TFT transistors over time. By slowing the refresh rate of the standard frequency from 60 Hz to 1 Hz, DTP claims to increase the power efficiency by multiple orders of magnitude.

==Display industry==

Due to the very high cost of building TFT factories, there are few major OEM panel vendors for large display panels. The glass panel suppliers are as follows:

==Electrical interface==

External consumer display devices like a TFT LCD feature one or more analog VGA, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort interface, with many featuring a selection of these interfaces. Inside external display devices there is a controller board that will convert the video signal using color mapping and image scaling usually employing the discrete cosine transform (DCT) in order to convert any video source like CVBS, VGA, DVI, HDMI, etc. into digital RGB at the native resolution of the display panel. In a laptop the graphics chip will directly produce a signal suitable for connection to the built-in TFT display. A control mechanism for the backlight is usually included on the same controller board.

The low level interface of STN, DSTN, or TFT display panels use either single ended TTL 5 V signal for older displays or TTL 3.3 V for slightly newer displays that transmits the pixel clock, horizontal sync, vertical sync, digital red, digital green, digital blue in parallel. Some models (for example the AT070TN92) also feature input/display enable, horizontal scan direction and vertical scan direction signals.

New and large (&gt;15&quot;) TFT displays often use LVDS signaling that transmits the same contents as the parallel interface (Hsync, Vsync, RGB) but will put control and RGB bits into a number of serial transmission lines synchronized to a clock whose rate is equal to the pixel rate. LVDS transmits seven bits per clock per data line, with six bits being data and one bit used to signal if the other six bits need to be inverted in order to maintain DC balance. Low-cost TFT displays often have three data lines and therefore only directly support 18 bits per pixel. Upscale displays have four or five data lines to support 24 bits per pixel (truecolor) or 30 bits per pixel respectively. Panel manufacturers are slowly replacing LVDS with Internal DisplayPort and Embedded DisplayPort, which allow sixfold reduction of the number of differential pairs.

Backlight intensity is usually controlled by varying a few volts DC, or generating a PWM signal, or adjusting a potentiometer or simply fixed. This in turn controls a high-voltage () DC-AC inverter or a matrix of LEDs. The method to control the intensity of LED is to pulse them with PWM which can be source of harmonic flicker.

The bare display panel will only accept a digital video signal at the resolution determined by the panel pixel matrix designed at manufacture. Some screen panels will ignore the LSB bits of the color information to present a consistent interface (8 bit -&gt; 6 bit/color x3).

With analogue signals like VGA, the display controller also needs to perform a high speed analog to digital conversion. With digital input signals like DVI or HDMI some simple reordering of the bits is needed before feeding it to the rescaler if the input resolution does not match the display panel resolution.

==Safety==
Liquid crystals are constantly subjected to toxicity and eco-toxicity testing for any hazard potential. The result is that:

* wastewater from manufacturing is acutely toxic to aquatic life,
* but may have an irritant, corrosive or sensitizing effect in rare cases. Any effects can be avoided by using a limited concentration in mixtures,
* are not mutagenic – neither in bacteria (Ames test) nor in mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma assay or chromosome aberration test),
* are not suspected of being carcinogenic,
* are hazardous to aquatic organisms (bacteria, algae, daphnia, fish),
* do not possess any significant bioaccumulation potential,
* are not easily biodegradable.

The statements are applicable to Merck KGaA as well as its competitors JNC Corporation (formerly Chisso Corporation) and DIC (formerly Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals). All three manufacturers have agreed not to introduce any acutely toxic or mutagenic liquid crystals to the market. They cover more than 90 percent of the global liquid crystal market. The remaining market share of liquid crystals, produced primarily in China, consists of older, patent-free substances from the three leading world producers and have already been tested for toxicity by them. As a result, they can also be considered non-toxic.

The complete report is available from Merck KGaA online.

The CCFL backlights used in many LCD monitors contain mercury, which is toxic.
