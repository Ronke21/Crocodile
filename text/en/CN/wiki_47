<text>The Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team is a college football team representing the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, north of the city of South Bend, Indiana. The team plays its home games at the campus&#x27;s Notre Dame Stadium, which has a capacity of 77,622. Notre Dame is one of three schools that competes as an Independent at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level; however, they play five games a year against opponents from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), of which Notre Dame is a member in all other sports except ice hockey.

The Fighting Irish are among the most prestigious college football teams of all time. Since their inaugural season in 1887, Notre Dame has won 11 national championships, including 8 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches&#x27; Poll. Seven Notre Dame players have won the Heisman Trophy. Notre Dame has 948 official victories, with an additional 21 having been vacated by the NCAA in 2016 for self-reported academic misconduct. Notre Dame has had 22 undefeated seasons including 12 perfect seasons. Notre Dame home games have been televised by NBC since 1991.

==History==

===Early history (1887–1917)===

Football did not have an auspicious beginning at the University of Notre Dame. In their inaugural game on November 23, 1887, the Irish lost to Michigan by a score of 8–0. Their first win came in the final game of the 1888 season when the Irish defeated Harvard Prep School of Chicago by a score of 20–0. At the end of the 1888 season, they had a record of 1–3 with all three losses being at the hands of Michigan. Between 1887 and 1899, Notre Dame compiled a record of 31 wins, 15 losses, and 4 ties against a diverse variety of opponents ranging from local high school teams to other universities. In 1894, James L. Morrison was hired as Notre Dame&#x27;s first head football coach. Notre Dame took a significant step toward respectability, prominence, and stability when they hired Morrison. He wrote an acquaintance after his first day on the job: &quot;I arrived here [Notre Dame] this morning and found about as green a set of football players that ever donned a uniform... They want to smoke, and when I told them that they would have to run and get up some wind, they thought I was rubbing it in on them. &quot;One big, strong cuss remarked that it was too much like work. Well, maybe you think I didn&#x27;t give him hell! I bet you a hundred no one ever makes a remark like that again.&quot;
In 1908, the win over Franklin saw end Fay Wood catch the first touchdown pass in Notre Dame history. Notre Dame continued its success near the turn of the century and achieved their first victory over Michigan in 1909 by the score of 11–3, after which Michigan refused to play Notre Dame again for 33 years. By the end of the 1912 season they had amassed a record of 108 wins, 31 losses, and 13 ties. Jesse Harper became head coach in 1913, coaching for five years until retiring in 1917. During his tenure, the Irish began playing only intercollegiate games and posted a record of 34 wins, five losses, and one tie. This period would also mark the beginning of the rivalry with Army and the continuation of rivalry with Michigan State. In an effort to gain respect for a regionally successful but small-time Midwestern football program, Harper scheduled games in his first season with national powerhouses Texas, Penn State, and Army. That year, Notre Dame burst into the national consciousness and helped to transform the collegiate game in a single contest.
On November 1, 1913, the Notre Dame squad stunned the Black Knights of the Hudson 35–13 in a game played at West Point. Led by quarterback Gus Dorais and end Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame team attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward passes from Dorais to Rockne. This game has been miscredited as the invention of the forward pass. Prior to this contest, receivers would come to a full stop and wait on the ball to come to them, but in this contest, Dorais threw to Rockne in stride, changing the forward pass from a seldom-used play into the dominant ball-moving strategy that it is today.

===Knute Rockne era (1918–1930)===

Irish assistant Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918. During his 13 years, the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925, and produced players such as George Gipp and the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;. Rockne&#x27;s offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7–2–2 scheme.

Rockne took over in the war-torn season of 1918 He made his coaching debut on September 28, 1918, against Case Tech in Cleveland, Ohio, and earned a 26–6 victory. Leonard Bahan, George Gipp, and Curly Lambeau were in the backfield. With Gipp, Rockne had an ideal handler of the forward pass. The Irish posted a 3–1–2 record for the season, losing only to the Michigan Agricultural Aggies. The 1919 team had Rockne handle the line and Gus Dorais handle the backfield. The Irish went undefeated and were one of four teams to be selected for the national championship, although Notre Dame does not claim it.
Gipp died at age 25 on December 14, 1920, just two weeks after Walter Camp elected him as Notre Dame&#x27;s first All-American. Gipp likely contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game on November 20 against Northwestern. Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited and they could be fatal even to young, healthy individuals. Rockne was speaking to Gipp on his hospital bed when he was purported to have delivered the famous &quot;Win one for the Gipper&quot; line.
John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10–1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns. Grantland Rice wrote that &quot;Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space&quot; and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team &quot;was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.&quot; Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.

The national champion 1924 team included the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; backfield of Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden. The line was known as the &quot;Seven Mules&quot;. The Irish capped an undefeated, 10–0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl. The 1926 team beat Army and was led by Christie Flanagan, but was undone by a loss to Carnegie Tech in the penultimate game of the season. In this game, Rockne made what an Associated Press writer called &quot;one of the greatest coaching blunders in history&quot; by traveling to Chicago for the Army–Navy Game to &quot;write newspaper articles about it, as well as select an All-America football team.&quot; Carnegie Tech used the coach&#x27;s absence as motivation for a 19–0 win; the upset likely cost the Irish a chance for a national title.

The 1928 team lost to national champion Georgia Tech. &quot;I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Peter Pund,&quot; said Rockne. &quot;Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.&quot; Among the events that occurred during Rockne&#x27;s tenure none may be more famous than the Rockne&#x27;s &quot;Win one for the Gipper&quot; speech. Army came into the 1928 matchup undefeated and was the clear favorite. Notre Dame, on the other hand, was having their worst season under Rockne&#x27;s leadership and entered the game with a 4–2 record. At the end of the half Army was leading and looked to be in command of the game. Rockne entered the locker room and gave his account of Gipp&#x27;s final words: &quot;I&#x27;ve got to go, Rock. It&#x27;s all right. I&#x27;m not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they&#x27;ve got and win just one for the Gipper. I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;ll be then, Rock. But I&#x27;ll know about it, and I&#x27;ll be happy.&quot; The speech inspired the team and they went on to upset Army and win the game 12–6.

The 1929 and 1930 teams both went undefeated, winning national championships, and the 1930 team was led by the likes of Frank Carideo, Joe Savoldi, Marchy Schwartz and Marty Brill. It featured the first and only example of all four members of a backfield being named to an All-American team during the same season. The 1929 team played all of its games on the road while the new Notre Dame Stadium was being built. In 1930, &quot;Jumping Joe&quot; Savoldi scored the first Notre Dame touchdown in the new stadium on a 98-yard kickoff return. Savoldi is also known as &quot;the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame&#x27;s Stadium&quot; based on scoring three touchdowns in the official stadium dedication game against Navy the following week. Rockne coached his last game on December 14, 1930, when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City. The game raised funds for the Mayor&#x27;s Relief Committee for the unemployed and needy of the city. 50,000 fans turned out to see the reunited &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; along with players from Rockne&#x27;s other championship teams take the field against the pros.

On March 31, 1931, Rockne died at age 43 in the crash of a Transcontinental &amp; Western Air airliner in Kansas; he was on his way to help in the production of the film The Spirit of Notre Dame. The crash site is located in a remote expanse of Kansas known as the Flint Hills and now features a Rockne Memorial. As Notre Dame&#x27;s head coach from 1918 to 1930, Rockne posted what has remained for decades the all-time highest winning percentage (.881) for a football coach in the NCAA&#x27;s flagship FBS division. During his 13-year tenure as head coach of the Fighting Irish, Rockne collected 105 victories, 12 losses, 5 ties and 3 national championships. Rockne also coached Notre Dame to 5 undefeated and untied seasons.

===Heartley Anderson (1931–1933)===
Through game broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio, Notre Dame football gained a nationwide following of &quot;subway alumni&quot;, Catholics who became fans whether or not they attended the university. Former Saint Louis head coach Heartley &quot;Hunk&quot; Anderson was promoted from assistant coach and took the helm of the Irish after Knute Rockne&#x27;s death, leading them to a record of 16 wins, nine losses, and two ties. Anderson was a former Irish player under Rockne and was serving as an assistant coach at the time of Rockne&#x27;s death. Notre Dame finished 6–2–1 in 1931. The Irish lost a heartbreaker by a score of 16–14 to USC on November 21 that snapped the program&#x27;s 26-game unbeaten streak. 1933 was a tough year for the Irish as they finished with a 3–5–2 record, the first losing season for the program since 1888. ND suffered a four-game losing streak, failing to score a point in all four losses to Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh, Navy, and Purdue. Anderson resigned as Irish head coach after the 1933 season to accept the position of head football coach at NC State.

===Elmer Layden (1934–1940)===

Anderson was replaced by Elmer Layden, who was one of Rockne&#x27;s &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; of 1924. After graduating, Layden played professional football for one year and then began a coaching career.

Layden&#x27;s 1935 squad posted one of the greatest wins in school history by rallying to defeat Ohio State by a score of 18–13 in a game billed as the &quot;Game of the Century&quot;. His 1938 team finished 8–1, losing only to USC in the season finale. This loss cost them a possible consensus national championship, but the team was named national champion by the Dickinson System. 

Like Rockne before him, Layden was a goodwill ambassador for Notre Dame during his time as head coach. He was able to schedule a home-and-home series with Michigan after meeting with Fielding H. Yost, healing a rift between the two schools. The two teams had not met since 1909, when, after eight straight losses to the Wolverines, the Irish posted their first win. They were scheduled to meet again in 1910, but Michigan canceled the game and refused to play the Irish again. By the time they met again in 1943, Layden had left Notre Dame and Frank Leahy had taken his place.

The Irish posted a record of 47 wins, 13 losses, and three ties in seven years under Layden, the most successful record of a Notre Dame coach not to win a national championship. He left Notre Dame after the 1940 season to become Commissioner of the National Football League.

===Frank Leahy era (1941–1953)===

Boston College head coach Frank Leahy was hired by Notre Dame to take over for Layden in 1941 and was another former Irish player who played during the Rockne era. After graduating from Notre Dame, Leahy held several coaching positions, including line coach of the Seven Blocks of Granite of Fordham University that helped that team win all but two of their games between 1935 and 1937. He then coached the Boston College Eagles to a win in the 1941 Sugar Bowl and a share of the national championship. His move to Notre Dame began a new period of gridiron success for the Irish and ensured Leahy&#x27;s place among the winningest coaches in the history of college football.

Leahy coached the team for 11 seasons from 1941 to 1943 and 1946 to 1953. After finishing in the AP top 10 each of his first two seasons, Leahy&#x27;s 1943 team went 9–1 and captured Notre Dame&#x27;s fourth national championship (and first since the advent of the AP Poll). Quarterback Angelo Bertelli became Notre Dame&#x27;s first Heisman Trophy winner. From 1944 to 1945, Leahy served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was honorably discharged as a captain. Edward McKeever, Leahy&#x27;s assistant coach, became interim head coach when Leahy left for the Navy. During 1944, his one year at the helm, the Irish managed 8 wins and 2 losses. McKeever left Notre Dame in 1945 to take over as head coach of Cornell. For the 1945 season, he was replaced by Hugh Devore, who led the Irish to a 7–2–1 record.

Upon Leahy&#x27;s return in 1946 and due to his status as a veteran himself, the Irish heavily recruited returning veterans who were often much older than incoming freshmen. Largely thanks to this influx of talent, Notre Dame went four consecutive seasons after World War II without losing a game, winning the 1946, 1947, and 1949 national championships in the process. The 1946 game against Army, ending in a 0–0 tie, pitted two of the greatest teams of all time against each other and included three consecutive Heisman Trophy winners (Army&#x27;s Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis and Notre Dame&#x27;s Johnny Lujack, who quarterbacked the 1946 and 1947 Irish). The 1948 team missed out on a national championship due only to a 14–14 tie at USC in the final game of the season. In 1949, Notre Dame went unbeaten and untied for the second time in three seasons behind Heisman Trophy-winning end Leon Hart, who would later be selected first overall in the 1950 NFL Draft. A fifth national championship was lost because of a 1953 tie against Iowa, in a game that featured 1953 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lattner that caused a minor scandal at the time, when it appeared that some Irish players had faked injuries to stop the clock, leading some to nickname those players the &quot;Fainting Irish&quot;.

Leahy retired in 1954 reportedly due to health issues. Perhaps the best example of this occurred during the Georgia Tech game in 1953. Leahy fell ill during the game, which led to him collapsing during halftime. The situation was so dire that a priest was called in to give Leahy Catholic last rites. However, Leahy recovered, and the consequent diagnosis was that he was suffering from nervous tension and pancreatitis.

Leahy has the second highest winning percentage (.864) of any college coach in history. He led the Irish to a record of 87 wins, 11 losses, and nine ties including 39 consecutive games without a loss (37–0–2), four national championships, and six undefeated seasons.

===Terry Brennan (1954–1958)===
The departure of Frank Leahy ushered in a downward slope in Notre Dame&#x27;s performance. 25-year old assistant coach Terry Brennan was hired as Frank Leahy&#x27;s successor as the Notre Dame head coach in 1954 and would stay until 1958. Brennan was a former player under Leahy. Before joining the Irish, he had coached the Mount Carmel High School team in Chicago. His first two seasons the Irish were ranked fourth and ninth respectively in the AP poll, with a loss to Purdue the only blemish on the 1954 team&#x27;s schedule. It was the 1956 season that began to darken Brennan&#x27;s reputation, for it became one of the most dismal in the team&#x27;s history and saw them finish the season with a mere two wins, including losses to Michigan State, Oklahoma, and Iowa. One bright spot in the 1956 season was the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to Paul Hornung, who would go on to a legendary NFL career with the Green Bay Packers. Hornung is the only Heisman winner to win the award while playing for a team that had a losing record. The Irish would recover the following season, posting a record of 7–3 and including in their wins a stunning upset of Oklahoma, in Norman, Oklahoma, that ended the Sooners&#x27; still-standing record of 47 consecutive wins. In Brennan&#x27;s final season, though, the Irish finished 6–4, leading to Brennan&#x27;s firing in mid-December. Brennan&#x27;s tenure can only be properly framed with the understanding that in a time of zero scholarship limitations in college football, Notre Dame&#x27;s administration inexplicably began a process of de-emphasizing football, severely cutting scholarships and hindering Brennan from building a roster of any meaningful depth. He departed with a total of 32 wins and 18 losses.

===Joe Kuharich (1959–1963)===
Former San Francisco, Chicago Cardinals and Washington Redskins head coach Joe Kuharich took the head coaching position at Notre Dame in 1959, realizing a longtime ambition to return to his alma mater. He had earlier been courted by Notre Dame after the 1956 season, after the Irish finished 2–8, but before he had a chance to accept an offer, Terry Brennan was given a reprieve. Kuharich brought a professional touch to Irish football, putting shamrocks on the players&#x27; helmets and shoulder stripes on their jerseys. However, his tenure became one of the worst stretches in program history, including a school-record eight-game losing streak in 1960, a year in which the Irish finished 2–8. The consensus opinion was that Kuharich never made the adjustment from pro football to college football, attempting to use complicated pro coaching techniques with collegiate players, and never adapted to the limited substitution rules in effect at the time, having big, immobile linemen playing both ways in an era where smaller, quicker players were preferred. He often said, &quot;You win some and you lose some&quot;, and seemed perfectly content finishing 5–5 every year. This did not sit well with the Irish faithful, who expected Notre Dame to beat everybody. When the pressure of winning became too much to bear, Kuharich resigned in the spring of 1963 and assumed the post of supervisor of NFL officials. Because it was so late in the spring, the freshman team&#x27;s coach Hugh Devore was named head coach for the 1963 season while the search for a permanent replacement was being conducted.

Kuharich compiled a 17–23 record over four non-winning seasons and remains to this day the only coach ever to have an overall losing record at Notre Dame. Despite his unsuccessful tenure, Kuharich remains the only Irish coach to post back-to-back shutouts over their greatest rival, the USC Trojans, in 1960 (17–0) and 1961 (30–0).

===Ara Parseghian era (1964–1974)===

In 1964, Ara Parseghian left his job as the Northwestern head football coach when he was hired to take over the coaching duties at Notre Dame. He immediately brought the team back to a level of success in Irish football history that was comparable only to Rockne and Leahy. These three coaches have an 80% or greater winning percentage while at Notre Dame – Rockne at .881, Leahy at .864, and Parseghian at .836. Parseghian&#x27;s teams never won fewer than seven nor lost more than three games during the ten-game regular seasons of the era.

In his first year, the Irish improved their record to 9–1 behind Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback John Huarte, but they lost any hope for a national championship in the last game of the season at USC when Craig Fertig connected with a touchdown pass to Rod Sherman. Parseghian earned coach of the year honors from the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association, and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, as well as several others, and a cover story in &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

The 1966 team did finish unbeaten, finishing #1 in the AP Poll and winning the national championship in the process. The Irish had six shutout wins, each by 30 or more points. This includes a season-ending 51-0 win at #10 USC, the largest margin of victory by either side in the rivalry&#x27;s history. This season is most remembered for a 10–10 tie at #2 Michigan State in the &quot;Game of the Century&quot; in which the injury-plagued Irish played for a tie rather than risking a loss.

It was under Parseghian as well that Notre Dame lifted its 40-plus year-old &quot;no bowl games&quot; policy, beginning with the season of 1969, after which the Irish played the #1 Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic, losing in the final minutes in a closely contested game. The following year, Parseghian&#x27;s 9–1 squad ended Texas&#x27; Southwest Conference record 30-game winning streak in the Cotton Bowl. In 1971, Cliff Brown became the first African-American quarterback to start a game for the program. The Irish returned to glory by winning Parseghian&#x27;s second national championship in 1973, sweeping through their regular-season schedule 10–0 and defeating #1 Alabama 24-23 in the Sugar Bowl by taking advantage of a fourth-quarter missed extra point by the Crimson Tide. Due to health issues, Parseghian was forced to retire from coaching after another bowl win over Alabama to conclude the 1974 season.

During Parseghian&#x27;s eleven-year career, the Irish amassed a record of 95–17–4 and captured two national championships. The Irish finished in the AP Top 10 nine times and never ranked lower than #14 at the end of a season. Parseghian was also named coach of the year by several selectors in his national championship years of 1966 and 1973 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.

===Dan Devine era (1975–1980)===

Dan Devine was hired to take over as head coach upon Parseghian&#x27;s retirement from Notre Dame in 1975. Devine was already a highly successful coach and had led Arizona State, Missouri, and the NFL&#x27;s Green Bay Packers. Devine had been a leading candidate for the head coaching job at Notre Dame in 1964, when Ara Parseghian was hired. When approached for the job following Parseghian&#x27;s resignation, Devine accepted immediately, joking that it was probably the shortest job interview in history. When he arrived at Notre Dame he already had a college coaching record of 120 wins, 40 losses, and eight ties and had led his teams to victory in four bowl games. At Notre Dame he would lead the Irish to 53 wins, 16 losses, and a tie as well as three bowl victories.

His lasting achievement came midway through this run, when the 1977 Notre Dame team won the national championship, led by junior quarterback Joe Montana. Before the game against USC, played at home on October 22, Devine changed the team&#x27;s jerseys from navy blue &amp; white to kelly green &amp; gold, later known as the &quot;green jersey game&quot;, resulting in a 49–19 victory over the Trojans. The Irish continued to wear green for the rest of Devine&#x27;s tenure at the school. The championship season climaxed with a 38–10 win in the 1978 Cotton Bowl Classic over previously top-ranked Texas, led by Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell. The win vaulted the Irish from fifth to first in the polls.

The following season, the Irish lost their first two games including a shocking 3–0 loss to Missouri in South Bend, but would recover to finish the regular season 8–3 and earn a berth in the Cotton Bowl against Houston. The Irish used three Montana touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) to recover from a 22-point deficit in the fourth quarter and win 35–34, the largest fourth-quarter comeback in college football history at the time. The game became known as the &quot;Chicken Soup Game&quot; after Montana ate a bowl of chicken soup at halftime while battling the flu. The 1979 and 1980 Irish did not live up to the standards set by earlier Devine teams, although the former season did see Vagas Ferguson set the single-season program rushing record (1,437 yards) that still stands today.

Because he had the unenviable task of following a legend, Devine came under heavy scrutiny while at Notre Dame and it was felt that he was never fully embraced by the Notre Dame community, despite winning a national championship. After a 5–2 start in his first season, rumors of incompetence were circulated and that Devine would be dismissed and replaced by Don Shula or even Ara Parseghian (who went so far as to say he would not return to Notre Dame under any circumstances). Even on the day of the 1977 USC game, &quot;Dump Devine&quot; bumper stickers were being sold outside Notre Dame Stadium. On August 15, 1980, Devine announced that he would be leaving Notre Dame at the end of season, saying he wanted to be able to spend more time with his wife.

===Gerry Faust era (1981–1985)===
Gerry Faust was a surprise choice when hired to replace Devine in 1981. Prior to Notre Dame, Faust had been one of the more successful high school football coaches in the country. As coach of Moeller High School in Cincinnati he amassed a 174–17–2 record over 19 seasons. Many of his players had gone on to play for Notre Dame; indeed, when he arrived in South Bend, he was reunited with nine of his former players from Moeller. Despite his success in the high school ranks, Faust&#x27;s success at Notre Dame was mixed. In his first season, the Irish finished 5–6. In Faust&#x27;s second season, Notre Dame improved slightly to 6–4–1. The most successful years under Faust were the 1983 and 1984 campaigns where the Irish finished 7–5 and made trips to the Liberty Bowl and Aloha Bowl respectively. His final record at Notre Dame was 30–26–1. To avoid being fired, Faust resigned at the end of the 1985 season. He announced his resignation prior to the final game of the year, where Notre Dame suffered a humiliating 58–7 loss at Miami; Allen Pinkett scored the Irish TD. Faust proceeded to take over as head coach at Akron.

===Lou Holtz era (1986–1996)===

Lou Holtz had 17 years of head coaching experience by the time he was hired to lead the Irish. He had previously been head coach of William &amp; Mary, North Carolina State, the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets, Arkansas, and Minnesota. In contrast to Faust, Holtz was well known as a master motivator and a strict disciplinarian. The tone was set with Holtz&#x27;s first meeting with his team as Irish head coach in 1986, immediately demanding his players sit up straight in their chairs and look him in the eye as he spoke. Holtz began in 1986 where his predecessor left off in 1985, finishing with an identical record of 5–6. However, unlike the 1985 squad, which was generally outcoached and outplayed, Holtz&#x27;s 1986 edition was competitive in nearly every game, losing five out of those six games by a combined total of 14 points. That would be his only losing season as he posted a record of 95–24–2 over the next ten seasons adding up to a 100–30–2 record overall.

In 1987, Holtz led the Irish to an 8–4 record. Notre Dame&#x27;s best player was star wide receiver Tim Brown, who would win the Heisman Trophy that season and is Notre Dame&#x27;s seventh and most recent Heisman winner.

The 1988 campaign began with high hopes, as former Notre Dame coaches Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian, and Devine all won their first national championship in their third season with the program. The Irish defeated their first five opponents, ascending to the #4 ranking in the lead-up to a visit from the reigning national champion Miami Hurricanes. In a game which became known as Catholics vs. Convicts due to a popular T-shirt design on Notre Dame&#x27;s campus, the Irish upset the Hurricanes 31–30 when Pat Terrell knocked down Steve Walsh&#x27;s two-point conversion attempt with no time on the clock. When star players Ricky Watters and Tony Brooks showed up late for dinner right before the then top-ranked Irish played second-ranked USC in the final regular season game of 1988, in a controversial move, Holtz took his 10–0 Irish squad to Los Angeles without them. His move was vindicated when the Irish defeated USC anyway. Holtz was named national coach of the year, and a win over No. 3 West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl captured the Irish&#x27;s 11th-all time national championship. 1988 remains Notre Dame&#x27;s most recent undefeated season and national championship.
In 1989, Holtz led the Irish to a 12–1 record. The Irish began the season in the Kickoff Classic game in East Rutherford, New Jersey, against Virginia. The Irish won by a score of 36–13 and ascended to the #1 spot in the AP Poll. Next, top-ranked Notre Dame defeated #2 Michigan by a score of 24–19. After nine more consecutive victories to begin the season 11–0, the Irish would lose to #7 Miami in the final week of the season, ending Notre Dame&#x27;s 23-game winning streak. Holtz would lead the Irish to a victory in the Orange Bowl over #1 Colorado to end the season, finishing #2 in the AP poll behind Miami.

After beginning the 1990 season with a #1 ranking and a victory over #4 Michigan by a score of 28–24 and two more wins for a 3–0 start, the Irish took their first loss of the season, losing to Stanford by a score of 36–31. The Irish would ascend back to #1 on the strength of a home win over #2 Miami, a game that saw the end of the series between the two until 2010. However, late-season losses to Penn State and Colorado in the Orange Bowl would eliminate the Irish from national championship contention. The 1991 Fighting Irish began the season 8-1, but lost back-to-back games for the first time since 1987 when they again lost to Penn State. The Irish would receive a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they defeated Florida by a score of 39–28.

In 1992, Notre Dame finished 10–1–1. After defeating Northwestern to start the season, the Fighting Irish tied #5 Michigan, their first tie of the Holtz era. This season saw the Irish&#x27;s largest win in history against Purdue, a 48–0 win at Notre Dame Stadium, and a 28–3 Cotton Bowl against previously unbeaten #4 Texas A&amp;M.

The Irish enjoyed another successful season in 1993, finishing the season at 11–1. After scoring 27 points in wins over Northwestern and #2 Michigan to start the season, the Irish defeated their next six opponents to enter a matchup with undefeated #1 Florida State 8–0 and ranked just behind the Seminoles at #2. For the first time, ESPN&#x27;s College GameDay decided to make a visit to campus to host the show live on Saturday morning. In a classic, the Irish defeated the Seminoles 31–24, ascending to the #1 ranking a day later. However, a loss to #17 Boston College on a game-winning field goal as time expired by a score of 41–39 ended the Irish&#x27;s national championship aspirations. The Irish would face a rematch with #6 Texas A&amp;M in the Cotton Bowl to finish the season, a game the Irish won by a score of 24–21. Controversially, Notre Dame finished #2 in the AP poll behind a team in Florida State it had beaten.

In 1994, Holtz led Notre Dame to a 6–5–1 record, the Irish&#x27;s worst record since Holtz&#x27;s first season in 1986. The team lost three of four games midseason to drop out of the rankings for the first time since 1986. The Irish would improve to 9–3 in 1995, but lost to #8 Florida State in the Orange Bowl. Lou Holtz&#x27;s final season at Notre Dame in 1996 resulted in an 8–3 record. The season notably saw Notre Dame&#x27;s first participation in the Emerald Isle Classic in Ireland, a 54–27 win over Navy, and an overtime loss to USC, snapping the Irish&#x27;s 13-game non-losing streak against the Trojans.

Holtz&#x27;s option offense, which helped catapult Notre Dame to many victories in the late 1980s and early 1990s, also helped rack up impressive recruiting classes. During the 1989 season, Holtz had the following future NFL players on offense: QB Rick Mirer, RB Ricky Watters, RB Anthony Johnson, RB Rodney Culver RB Dorsey Levens, and WR Raghib Ismail. In 1990, he added RB Jeff Burris (who would later move to safety), FB Jerome Bettis and TE Irv Smith. 1991 saw the additions of RB Reggie Brooks and FB Ray Zellars. 1992 saw the addition of WR Derrick Mayes. For 1993, he added FB Marc Edwards. In 1995, he added RB Autry Denson. From the 1987–1995 NFL Drafts, there were a total of 65 Notre Dame players selected. Overall, Holtz took Notre Dame to one undefeated season, nine consecutive New Year&#x27;s Day bowl games, and top 10 finishes in the AP poll in five seasons, as well as overseeing the majority of the longest winning streak against USC in program history (11 games). Holtz retired from Notre Dame following the 1996 season, but would unretire in 1999 to accept the head coaching position at South Carolina where he would serve until the completion of the 2004 season.

===Bob Davie era (1997–2001)===

Bob Davie, who had been Holtz&#x27;s defensive coordinator from 1994 to 1996, was promoted to head coach when Holtz retired. Davie, who turned down a head coaching offer from Purdue to accept the Irish&#x27;s head coaching position, was a well-respected defensive mind who had also served as defensive coordinator at Tulane and Texas A&amp;M. Davie had also filled in as head coach for one game during the 1995 season when Lou Holtz was dealing with a health issue. One of his first major decisions was to fire long-time offensive line coach Joe Moore, who then successfully sued the university for age discrimination. On Davie&#x27;s watch, the team suffered three bowl game losses (1997 Independence Bowl, 1999 Gator Bowl, and 2001 Fiesta Bowl), and it failed to qualify for a bowl game in two others (1999 and 2001). The highlight of Davie&#x27;s tenure was a 36–20 upset win in 1998 over #5 Michigan, the defending national champions.

On December 17, 1999, Notre Dame was placed on probation by the NCAA. The association&#x27;s Committee on Infractions found two series of violations. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;the main one involved the actions of a booster, Kimberly Dunbar, who lavished gifts on football players with money she later pleaded guilty to embezzling.&quot; In the second series of events, a football player was accused of trying to sell several complimentary game tickets and of using others as repayment of a loan. The player was also said &quot;to have been romantically involved with a woman (not Dunbar), a part-time tutor at the university, who wrote a term paper for another player for a small fee and provided players with meals, lodging and gifts.&quot; The Dunbar violation began while Lou Holtz was head coach: &quot;According to the NCAA committee report, Dunbar, the woman at the center of the more serious violations, had become romantically involved with several Notre Dame football players from June 1995 to January 1998 and had a child with one, Jarvis Edison.&quot; Notre Dame was placed on probation for two years and lost one of its 85 football scholarships each year in what the &quot;Times&quot; termed &quot;minor&quot; penalties.

Davie nearly defeated top-ranked Nebraska in 2000, with the Irish comeback bid falling short in overtime 27–24. The aforementioned 2001 Fiesta Bowl was Notre Dame&#x27;s first invitation to the Bowl Championship Series. The Irish lost by 32 points to Oregon State, but would finish No. 15 in the AP Poll, Davie&#x27;s highest ranking as head coach. Despite Davie&#x27;s rocky tenure, new athletic director Kevin White gave the coach a contract extension following the 2000 season, then saw the team start 0–3 in 2001 – the first such start in school history. Disappointed by the on-field results, coupled with the Joe Moore and Kim Dunbar scandals, the administration decided to dismiss Davie after the 2001 season. His final record at Notre Dame was 35–25.

====George O&#x27;Leary controversy====
On December 9, 2001, Notre Dame hired George O&#x27;Leary, the head coach at Georgia Tech, to replace Davie. However, while researching a story on O&#x27;Leary, New Hampshire Union Leader reporter Jim Fennell uncovered misrepresentations in O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s resume that had influenced the administration&#x27;s decision to hire him. The resulting media scandal embarrassed Notre Dame officials and tainted O&#x27;Leary; he resigned five days later, before coaching a single practice, recruiting a single player, or hiring a single assistant coach. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s tenure is the shortest of any head coach in FBS history. O&#x27;Leary would go on to become the head football coach at the University of Central Florida.

===Tyrone Willingham era (2002–2004)===
Once again in need of a new head coach, the school turned to Tyrone Willingham, the head coach at Stanford. Willingham&#x27;s hiring made him the first African American head coach in Notre Dame football history. Bringing a feeling of change and excitement to campus, Willingham led the 2002 squad to a 10–2 regular season record, including an 8–0 start with wins over #7 Michigan and #11 Florida State, and a #4 ranking. This great early start, however, would be the lone highlight of Willingham&#x27;s tenure, as Notre Dame finished the year with a loss to Boston College, then lopsided losses to USC and North Carolina State in the Gator Bowl. The program faltered over the next two seasons under Willingham, compiling an 11–12 record. During this time, Notre Dame lost a game by at least 30 points on five occasions. Furthermore, Willingham&#x27;s 2004 recruiting class was judged by analysts to be the worst at Notre Dame in more than two decades. Citing Notre Dame&#x27;s third consecutive four-touchdown loss to arch-rival USC compounded by another year of subpar recruiting efforts, the Willingham era ended on November 30, 2004 (after the conclusion of the 2004 season) when the university chose to terminate him and pay out the remainder of Willingham&#x27;s six-year contract.

===Charlie Weis era (2005–2009)===

After Willingham&#x27;s firing, Notre Dame initially pursued Utah head coach Urban Meyer, who had been an Irish assistant from 1996 to 2000 and had a clause in his Utah contract that stated he could take the Notre Dame head coaching job without paying a buyout. After Meyer accepted the Florida head coaching position and turned down the Irish, Charlie Weis left the NFL&#x27;s New England Patriots, where he won three Super Bowls as offensive coordinator, to become head football coach for the Irish beginning with the 2005 season. A first-time head coach when he was hired by Notre Dame, Weis was officially introduced on December 12, 2004. Weis&#x27; hiring as the Irish&#x27;s 30th head football coach made him the first Notre Dame graduate to hold the football head coaching position on a full-fledged basis since Joe Kuharich. Weis signed a six-year contract worth about $2 million annually excluding incentives.

To kick off his inaugural season, Weis led the Irish to back-to-back road wins over ranked teams, the first time that had been done by a Notre Dame coach since Knute Rockne. On September 25, Weis and the Irish traveled to Seattle to face Washington and former head coach Tyrone Willingham, who was hired by the Huskies to be their head coach two weeks after getting fired at Notre Dame. The Irish won by a score of 36–17. Entering the rivalry game with USC, defending national champions and owners of a 27-game winning streak, the Irish had risen to #9 in the AP Poll. In one of the most famous games in the rivalry&#x27;s history, USC defeated Notre Dame 34–31. The game is most remembered for Trojan running back and eventual Heisman winner Reggie Bush, who had already scored three touchdowns that day, illegally pushing quarterback Matt Leinart into the end zone on the final play of the game, in a play now known as the &quot;Bush Push&quot;. The Irish won their remaining five games to earn an appearance in the Fiesta Bowl. There, they were defeated by the Ohio State Buckeyes 34–20 to finish the season 9–3 and #9 in the AP poll, their highest final ranking since 1993. Quarterback Brady Quinn broke numerous team passing records that season and became a top Heisman Trophy contender. Wide receiver Jeff Samardzija was the team&#x27;s leading receiver and also broke Notre Dame&#x27;s single-season records for receiving yards and touchdowns. During the 2005 season, Notre Dame signed Weis to a big raise and ten-year contract extension that was set to keep the coach in South Bend through the 2015 season.

Weis and the Irish went into the 2006 season with a No. 2 preseason ranking in the ESPN/Coaches Poll. They finished the regular season with a 10–2 record, losing only to Michigan and USC. Notre Dame accepted a bid to the 2007 Sugar Bowl, losing to LSU 41–14. This marked their ninth consecutive postseason loss, the longest drought in NCAA history. As a result, Notre Dame dropped to #17 in the final rankings. In the wake of a graduating class that sent eleven players to the NFL, the 2007 season included various negative milestones: the most losses in a single year (9); two of the ten worst losses in program history (38–0 losses to both Michigan and USC); and the first 6-game losing streak for home games. The Naval Academy recorded their first win over the Irish since 1963, breaking Notre Dame&#x27;s NCAA-record 43-game win streak.

In 2008, the Irish started 4–1, but completed the regular season with a 6–6 record, including a 24–23 home loss to Syracuse, the first time that Notre Dame had fallen to an eight-loss team. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen was the team&#x27;s star player, completing over 60% of his passes. Despite speculation the university might fire Weis, it was announced he would remain head coach. Weis&#x27;s Notre Dame squad ended the season breaking the Irish&#x27;s NCAA bowl losing streak by beating Hawaii, 49–21, in the Hawaii Bowl. Weis entered the 2009 season with the expectation from the Notre Dame administration that his team would be in position to compete for a BCS Bowl berth. Notre Dame started the first part of the season 4–2, with close losses to Michigan and USC. Sitting at 6–2, however, Notre Dame lost to Navy for the second time in three years, which became the first loss in a four-game losing streak to finish the season. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen and wide receiver Golden Tate would forgo their senior seasons and enter the NFL Draft. Weis was fired on November 30, 2009. According to Weis&#x27; buyout, he was to be paid $6 million then $2.05 million annually until the contract ran out in December 2015 for a total of about $19 million. During that time, Weis made more money annually not to coach the Irish than his successor, Brian Kelly, made to coach the team.

===Brian Kelly era (2010–2021)===

On December 10, 2009, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly became the 31st head coach of the Fighting Irish after leading the Bearcats to a 12–0 record and BCS bowl-game berth, but he left the team before the bowl game. Kelly&#x27;s hiring surprised very few as he was a northern Irish Catholic who was considered one of college football&#x27;s rising stars. In his first season, Kelly led the Fighting Irish to an 8–5 record. Tragedy struck early in the season when Declan Sullivan, a junior working for the athletic department, died while filming a practice on a scissor lift in dangerously high winds. Dayne Crist started the season at quarterback but was injured for a second consecutive year, this time in the Tulsa game, which the Irish lost. Kelly turned to freshman quarterback Tommy Rees, who led the Irish to victories in the last three games against #15 Utah, Army in Yankee Stadium, and breaking an eight-year losing streak to USC in the LA Coliseum. Kelly guided the Irish to a 33–17 win over Miami (FL) in the 2010 Sun Bowl to finish 2010 with an 8–5 record. With senior wideout Michael Floyd returning for his senior season and an outstanding recruiting class that included several highly touted defensive linemen, Kelly and the Irish looked to improve on their 8–5 record from the prior year. However, an early season upset to a Skip Holtz-led South Florida team and a last-second loss to Michigan in Ann Arbor, games in which the Irish committed 10 total turnovers, left the Irish at 0–2 to start the season. The Irish bounced back to beat #15 Michigan State and had two 4-game winning streaks, with the only loss during that stretch coming at the hands of USC. The Irish also broke Navy&#x27;s 2-game winning streak over Notre Dame. Notre Dame lost 18–14 to Florida State in the 2011 Champs Sports Bowl, concluding the 2011 campaign with an 8–5 record overall, identical to the 2010 season. In the team&#x27;s losses, multiple turnovers from the quarterback position were often the culprit, and as a whole turnovers at critical times in the game often derailed potential Irish comebacks.

On September 12, 2012, during the football program&#x27;s 125th season, Notre Dame announced that it would leave the Big East Conference for the Atlantic Coast Conference, excluding the football and hockey programs. This move became official on July 1, 2013. While the Fighting Irish football team remained an FBS independent, it agreed to play five games per season against ACC teams starting with the 2014 football season. In return, Notre Dame became eligible to participate in the ACC&#x27;s sub-BCS level bowl arrangements.

The 2012 season was another entry in historic third seasons for Notre Dame head coaches. The Irish began the season 7–0, including wins over ranked rivals in Michigan State, Michigan, and Stanford. The game against the Cardinal required a goal-line stand against running back Stepfan Taylor in overtime to preserve the win for the Irish. The season&#x27;s signature win came at #8 Oklahoma with ESPN&#x27;s College GameDay in town. On November 18, after a loss by #1 Oregon, Notre Dame became ranked #1 in the nation in both the AP and Coaches&#x27; polls after reaching 11–0 during the regular season for the first time since 1993, also ranking #1 in the BCS standings for the first time in the 14-year history of the selection system. After defeating USC on November 24, Notre Dame concluded its first 12–0 regular season, and the Irish were soon formally named to appear in the BCS National Championship Game for the first time. In that game, on January 7, 2013, the Irish lost to Alabama 42–14. The strength of the 2012 Fighting Irish was its defense, captained by senior leader Manti Te&#x27;o, who broke the school record for interceptions by a linebacker with 7 and finished second to Johnny Manziel in Heisman Trophy voting.

Coming off the previous year&#x27;s national title game appearance, the Fighting Irish were dealt a blow when 2012 starting quarterback, Everett Golson, was suspended from the University due to an academic violation. Senior Tommy Rees then took over. Notre Dame&#x27;s 2013 season ended with a record of 9–4, a victory over Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl, and a #20 AP poll ranking. The 2014 season started off with 6 straight victories and a #5 national ranking heading into a showdown with #2 Florida State in Tallahassee, Florida. FSU won that game 31–27, on a controversial offensive pass interference call that brought back a last-second Notre Dame touchdown. The Fighting Irish bounced back with a win against Navy before dropping their final 4 games of the season. They did win the Music City Bowl by defeating the LSU Tigers and finished the season at an 8–5 record.

The 2015 Fighting Irish began its season with another new offensive coordinator, Mike Sanford Jr. Led for most of the year by sophomore quarterback DeShone Kizer, the Irish had fourteen plays of over 50 yards during the season, which was a school record, including two touchdowns of over 90 yards (a 91-yard touchdown run by C. J. Prosise and a 98-yard touchdown run by Josh Adams). The Irish only had two in the previous 126 years of Notre Dame football. They finished the regular season averaging 34 points per game, including a 62-point effort against UMass, the most points in a game since 1996. The Irish began the season 10–1 and were in position for a College Football Playoff appearance, but lost a last-second game to Stanford to finish with a 10–2 record and a berth in the Fiesta Bowl. Star linebacker Jaylon Smith was injured early in the game which became a loss to Ohio State. The 2016 season ended with a 4–8 record, Brian Kelly&#x27;s worst win–loss record at Notre Dame. The tone for the season was set early, with a heartbreaking double overtime loss to Texas in the season opener. Just 4 games into the season, Brian Kelly fired defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder. At the end of the season, starting quarterback DeShone Kizer declared for the NFL Draft and backup quarterback Malik Zaire announced he would be transferring in the winter after graduation. Amidst speculation that Kelly&#x27;s job was in jeopardy and that Kelly was looking to leave Notre Dame, athletics director Jack Swarbrick announced that Kelly would return for the 2017 season.

The 2017 season was one of Kelly&#x27;s strongest seasons at ND. An early one-point loss to #2 Georgia was the only blemish on an 8-1 start, keyed by a 49-14 blowout over rival USC. The tough running of running back Josh Adams behind an experienced and talented offensive line, which included future top-10 picks Quenton Nelson and Mike McGlinchey and won the Joe Moore Award as the best offensive line in that nation, allowed Notre Dame to string together 6 consecutive 20+ point victories. However, when #3 Notre Dame visited #7 Miami in South Florida on November 7, an embarrassing 41-8 loss effectively ended the Irish hopes of a playoff run. They ended the season with a win over LSU in the Music City Bowl. The Irish opened the 2018 season at home against Michigan and won, 24–17. After benching quarterback Brandon Wimbush in favor of Ian Book, the Irish then won the remainder of their regular season games, including victories over #7 Stanford, #24 Virginia Tech, #12 Syracuse, and Northwestern. This led to Notre Dame&#x27;s first undefeated regular season since 2012. They were ranked #3 in the nation by the College Football Playoff committee and selected to play in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl against Clemson. Notre Dame&#x27;s undefeated streak came to an end after losing to the eventual national champions 30–3 to finish the season at 12–1. Kelly was named AP Coach of the Year and Home Depot Coach of the Year for the 2018 season.

Kelly and the Fighting Irish started off the 2019 season with a #9 ranking in the AP Poll. Notre Dame won their first two games before dropping a 23–17 result to #3 Georgia. Notre Dame won their next three games before dropping a 45–14 game to #19 Michigan. Notre Dame closed out the regular season with victories in their last five games, followed by a win in the Camping World Bowl 33–9 over Iowa State.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of regular season scheduled games, Notre Dame joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in football for a single season in 2020 and played a full slate of conference matches. The Irish won all ten of their games, including a mid-season contest against perennial conference power and top-ranked Clemson. The Fighting Irish defeated the Tigers 47–40 in double overtime. However, Clemson defeated the Irish in a rematch in the ACC Championship Game 34–10. Notre Dame qualified for the College Football Playoff as the #4 seed. In the College Football Playoff Semifinals against Alabama at the Rose Bowl, Notre Dame lost 31–14 to finish with a 10–2 record. In what would become Kelly&#x27;s final season as head coach in 2021, the Fighting Irish were ranked #9 to begin the season, but struggled in their first two games, beating Florida State 41–38 and Toledo 32–29. Following a 24–13 loss to #7 Cincinnati, Kelly helped lead the Fighting Irish to a seven-game winning streak to finish the regular season 11–1 and earn a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.

On November 29, 2021, Kelly resigned as Notre Dame head coach to accept a ten-year, $95 million contract offer to become head coach at LSU. In so doing, Kelly became the first Irish head coach since Thomas A. Barry in 1907 to leave Notre Dame for another coaching job. Kelly left the Irish as the program&#x27;s all-time winningest head coach.

===Marcus Freeman era (2021–present)===

On December 3, 2021, Notre Dame&#x27;s defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman was promoted to the head coaching position to replace Brian Kelly, becoming the 32nd head coach in program history. The second African American head coach in the history of the Irish football program, Freeman signed a five-year contract worth $4 million annually excluding incentives. Freeman took control immediately, coaching the Irish in their Fiesta Bowl loss to Oklahoma State.

Freeman opened the 2022 season with losses to Ohio State (his alma mater) and Marshall, thus becoming first head coach in Notre Dame history to start his tenure with three losses. He collected his first win the following week against California. Freeman&#x27;s Irish would go on to finish the regular season ranked 19th with a record of 8-4, including an upset win over #5 Clemson. They were awarded a berth in the Gator Bowl where they defeated South Carolina 45–38. In 2023, Freeman guided Notre Dame to a 10-win season. Safety Xavier Watts received the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for college football&#x27;s best defensive player and the team earned victories over #17 Duke (and future Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard), #10 USC, and #19 Oregon State in the Sun Bowl. Notre Dame finished the year ranked #14 in the final AP Top 25.

Freeman and the Fighting Irish held their first home game of the 2024 season against Northern Illinois as the #5 ranked team in the AP Top 25 and as a 28.5-point favorite to win. They fell to the Huskies 16-14, with quarterback Riley Leonard throwing two interceptions and the team giving up two blocked field goals. It was the second early-season home loss for the Irish against a heavy underdog in three years (following the 2022 loss to Marshall), was the first-ever win by a Mid-American Conference football program against a top 5 team, the first-ever Huskie win against a top 10 team, and one of the largest point-spread upsets in modern college football. Despite the upset, the Irish won every remaining game to complete the regular season 11-1 and hosted a home game in the first year of the expanded college football playoffs, in which they beat #10 Indiana 27-17. They then beat the SEC champion #2 Georgia Bulldogs in the Sugar Bowl by a score of 23-10, earning the program&#x27;s first major bowl win since the 1993 season, and followed it up with a 27-24 win over #6 Penn State in the Orange Bowl to advance to the 2025 National Championship Game, their first appearance in the title game since 2012. The Irish fell short of winning a national championship as they were defeated by Ohio State by a score of 34-23. Watts was voted a consensus All-American at safety for the second consecutive year, while Freeman won the Dodd and Bear Bryant trophies for national coach of the year.

===National championships===

*Notre Dame was ranked No. 1 by the Dickinson System in 1924, 1929, and 1930 and awarded the Rissman Trophy. Knute Rockne&#x27;s teams gained permanent possession of this national championship trophy by winning it three times in ten years.
*Notre Dame has won eight wire service national championships awarded by the AP Poll or Coaches Poll, second most in the post-1936 poll era.

*The three Dickinson System and eight wire service national championships make a total of 11, but Notre Dame is often credited with additional national championships. The 1938, 1953, and 1964 seasons are part of the reason for the discrepancy. In the 1938 season, 8–1 Notre Dame was awarded the Knute Rockne Memorial Trophy and the national championship by the Dickinson System, while TCU (which finished 11–0) was awarded the championship by the Associated Press. In the 1953 season, an undefeated Notre Dame team (9–0–1) was named national champion by almost every major selector except the AP and UPI (coaches&#x27;) polls, where the Irish finished second in both to 10–1 Maryland. In 1964 Notre Dame was named national champions by the National Football Foundation and awarded the MacArthur Bowl. As Notre Dame has a policy of only recognizing AP and Coaches&#x27; Poll national championships post-1936, the school does not officially recognize the 1938, 1953, or 1964 national championships.
*Beyond their eleven claimed national championships, Notre Dame has been named national champion by at least one NCAA-designated &quot;major selector&quot; in an additional eleven seasons: 1919, 1920, 1927, 1938, 1953, 1964, 1967, 1970, 1989, 1993, and 2012.

Notre Dame&#x27;s 11 claimed national championships are:
Following its appearance in the 1925 Rose Bowl, Notre Dame did not play in a post-season game for 44 consecutive years (1925–1968), including after many of the team&#x27;s most successful seasons from the Rockne era in the 1920s and the Leahy era in the 1940s. The university&#x27;s stated reasons for its self-imposed hiatus were that bowl games were &quot;glorified exhibitions&quot; that played no part in national championship selections and that they extended the season too far to the detriment of players&#x27; academic progress.

===Appearances in the final Associated Press Poll===
Notre Dame has made 874 appearances in the Associated Press poll over 71 seasons. Notre Dame has spent 591 weeks in the Top 10, 318 weeks in the Top 5, and 98 weeks at No. 1. Notre Dame has finished the year ranked in the final Associated Press poll of the season 56 times:

==All-time records==
===Season records===
Notre Dame&#x27;s all-time record after the 2023 season stands at 948 wins, 338 losses, and 42 ties.

===In-state NCAA Division I record===
===Head coaches===

† George O&#x27;Leary did not coach a single practice or game, resigning five days after being hired for misrepresenting his academic credentials.‡ Kent Baer served as interim head coach for one game at the 2004 Insight Bowl after Tyrone Willingham was fired.

===Bowl games===
Notre Dame has made 44 bowl game appearances, winning 23 and losing 21, with one game vacated. After an initial appearance in a postseason contest in the 1925 Rose Bowl, the Fighting Irish refused to participate in bowl games for more than four decades; Sports Illustrated&#x27;s Dan Jenkins speculated that Notre Dame might have gone to as many as twenty bowl games during the self-imposed forty-five-year hiatus. From 1994 to the 2006 football seasons, Notre Dame lost 9 consecutive bowl games, tied with Northwestern for the most in NCAA history. That streak ended with a 49–21 win over Hawaii in the 2008 Hawaii Bowl. In the process, Notre Dame scored its highest point total in postseason play. The record of 9 consecutive bowl losses was later tied by Northwestern in 2011, then that streak was snapped a year later. The Fighting Irish suffered in a multi-decade skid with an 0-8 record in BCS/Playoff games and an 0-10 record in major bowl games between 1994 and 2025. The losing streak would come to an end when Notre Dame beat Georgia in the 2025 Sugar Bowl.

===Shamrock Series===
Between 2009 and 2016, and resuming again in 2018, Notre Dame has hosted an annual off-site home football game known as the Shamrock Series. The series promotes Notre Dame&#x27;s athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to San Antonio, New York, Greater Washington, D.C., Chicago, Indianapolis, Boston and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Each game in the series also features a unique alternate uniform for the Notre Dame team. Notre Dame has yet to lose a game in the Shamrock Series with a record of 11-0 (including the later-vacated win over Arizona State in the 2013 season).

Prior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. While the Shamrock Series was not held in 2017 or 2023, Notre Dame still featured a unique alternate uniform at one game each of those years, both times against Navy (at Notre Dame in 2017 and in Dublin, Ireland in 2023).

One of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year&#x27;s host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers&#x27; circles, and academic lectures.

The Shamrock Series held in Las Vegas in 2022 was the largest crowd for a college athletic event in Nevada history.
==Players and coaches==
===Heisman Trophy===

===College Football Hall of Fame===

50 former Notre Dame players and 6 coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, located in Atlanta, Georgia. Notre Dame leads all universities in players inducted.

==Uniforms==

Notre Dame&#x27;s home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking &quot;ND&quot; logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking &quot;ND&quot; on the sleeves. These uniforms were introduced by Lou Holtz in 1986 and retained during the tenures of Bob Davie (1997-2001) and Tyrone Willingham (2002–04). In 2005, Charlie Weis removed the interlocking &quot;ND&quot; from the sleeves, replacing it with the player&#x27;s number, the first time the Irish had worn &quot;TV numbers&quot; since 1986, when they were located on the shoulders. These jerseys remained throughout Weis&#x27; tenure. When Brian Kelly succeeded Weis in 2010, the interlocking &quot;ND&quot; returned to the sleeves, and it has remained since.

The Irish traditionally have not worn player names on their jerseys during regular season games, but they were included during the coaching tenures of Dan Devine (1975–80) and Gerry Faust (1981-85). When Notre Dame appeared in the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic, its first bowl game in 45 years, Ara Parseghian had player names placed on the backs of the jerseys, a tradition which was retained for four other bowl appearances under Parseghian. Holtz, Davie, Willingham and Weis (in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl and 2007 Sugar Bowl) did not adhere to this tradition for bowl games they coached, but it returned under Weis for the 2008 Hawaii Bowl and has been continued by Kelly and Marcus Freeman.

Notre Dame&#x27;s helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University&#x27;s famed &quot;Golden Dome&quot;. Notre Dame&#x27;s tradition for the team&#x27;s student managers to spray-paint the team&#x27;s helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc.

During Gerry Faust&#x27;s tenure (1981–85), Notre Dame&#x27;s blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy (although Notre Dame wore green jerseys full-time between the 1977 game vs. USC and the end of the 1980 season) to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves (they also wore a green jersey with sleeve stripes for the 1983 game vs. USC). The navy blue jerseys returned for the 1984 season (the Irish wore a redesigned white jersey during the 1983 Liberty Bowl without sleeve stripes and navy blue names and numbers which was carried over to 1984).

No uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card that lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by Ralph Guglielmi, George Izo, Daryle Lamonica, Coley O&#x27;Brien, Joe Montana, Michael Floyd, Rick Mirer and Ron Powlus, among others. Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen (Elmer Layden) a Heisman Trophy Winner (Paul Hornung) and a National Title winning Quarterback (Terry Hanratty). Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.

In 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For each Shamrock Series game, Notre Dame wears specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants.

Champion supplied football jerseys for Notre Dame for over 50 years until the Irish switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the Notre Dame athletic department began wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour.

=== Green Jerseys ===
Over the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season – or more – at a time. Notre Dame is confirmed to have worn green as far back as 1926 against Penn State, and in 1942 they officially became an alternate color for the team.

Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for special occasions. Sometimes on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game and in the loss to Nile Kinnick-led Iowa in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa&#x27;s black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the green jerseys as a reward to his senior players and in an attempt to end the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team but lost the game 38-0. As of 2023, Notre Dame&#x27;s record in green is 42-15-1, going back to 1975.

On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey, a white jersey with green numbers.

==Facilities==

===Notre Dame Stadium===

Notre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university&#x27;s campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a seating capacity of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football. The &quot;Sporting News&quot; ranks Notre Dame Stadium as #2 on its list of &quot;College Football Cathedrals&quot;. and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football-related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400 million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season.

===Cartier Field===

Cartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football.

===Guglielmino Athletics Complex===
Known by fans as &quot;The Gug&quot; (pronounced &quot;goog&quot;), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame&#x27;s football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, a brand new napping room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family.

===Irish Athletic Center===
The indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and a video board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at its peak.

==Rivalries==


Notre Dame has rivalries with several universities. Although the Fighting Irish competes as an Independent, they play a national schedule that includes annual or otherwise regularly scheduled rivalry games. Army, Boston College, Michigan, Michigan State, Navy, Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Stanford, and USC are among Notre Dame&#x27;s rivals.

===Miami (FL)===

Notre Dame and the Miami Hurricanes first met during the 1955 college football season. They met three times during the 1960s (1960, 1965, and 1967) and proceeded to play each other annually from 1971 to 1990 (except in 1986). Notre Dame consistently dominated the series in the 1970s, but in the 1980s, Miami began to dominate as the once docile rivalry intensified significantly. Both teams were national contenders in the later part of the decade, and both teams cost each other at least one national championship. Hostilities were fueled when the Hurricanes routed the Fighting Irish in the 1985 season finale 58–7, with Miami widely accused of running up the score in the second half. The rivalry gained national attention and both teams played their most famous games from 1988 to 1990. The game known as Catholics vs. Convicts in South Bend was won by the Fighting Irish 31–30. The following year, Miami ended Notre Dame&#x27;s 23-game winning streak with a 27–10 victory. The rivalry ended after the Fighting Irish dashed #2 Miami&#x27;s hopes for a repeat national championship with a 29–20 victory in South Bend. Notre Dame dropped Miami from its schedule due to the intensified rivalry.

The two teams are next scheduled to meet in the 2025 season opener at Hard Rock Stadium. They also will play each other in yet to be scheduled dates in the 2031, 2032, 2034, and 2037 seasons.

===Michigan===

The first meeting between Notre Dame and Michigan was in 1887, the first official football game in Notre Dame&#x27;s history. The two schools have met 44 times in total, the latest matchup in 2019. Through the 2021 season, the two schools are both in the top five in all-time Division I winning percentage, with Notre Dame fourth and Michigan third.

===Michigan State===

Meeting for the first time in 1897, Notre Dame and Michigan State play for the Megaphone Trophy. The two schools played in 64 out of 70 seasons from 1948 to 2017, but have not met since. Their next scheduled game is in 2026. Notable games in the series include the 1966 &quot;Game of the Century&quot;. Through the 2023 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 48–28–1 and the trophy series 33–27–1.

===Navy===

Navy and Notre Dame played 93 games without interruption from 1927 to 2019. Notre Dame had a 43-game win streak during this time frame, the longest streak by one team over another in Division I-A football, which ended in 2007. While the 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the series resumed in 2021. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the series 83–13–1.

===USC===

USC is Notre Dame&#x27;s primary rival, and the schools compete annually for the Jeweled Shillelagh. The rivalry has produced 39 national championships, 15 Heisman Trophy winners, and 184 Consensus All-Americans through the 2021 season. It is considered one of the most prominent rivalries in college football, and has been called the greatest rivalry not dictated by conference affiliation or geography. The teams have played each other annually since 1926, except from 1943 to 1945 and 2020. Notable games in the series include the 1977 &quot;Green Jersey&quot; game and the 2005 &quot;Bush Push&quot; game. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 50–37–5 and the trophy series 35–30–3.

==Gameday traditions==

Due to its long and storied history, Notre Dame football boasts many traditions unique to Notre Dame. Some of these are:

* The tradition of having 23.9 karat gold in the helmet paint continues, with the painting process provided by Hydro Graphics, Inc. and no longer by student managers. The gold particles that are used on the helmet were collected from the re-gilding on the Notre Dame dome in 2007. During the 2011 season, however, a new helmet paint scheme was introduced. While retaining the basic gold helmet and grey facemask look, the new gold is much more reflective than the old; there have already been several variations of this new &quot;gold chrome&quot; look, including brick and fish-scale texturing.
*Formerly, prior to the start of the game, the team attended Mass in semi-formal attire at the Sacred Heart Basilica. At the conclusion of Mass, fans formed a line that the team walked through from the chapel to the stadium. However, in 2011 the team changed its movements prior the game, instead taking buses back to The Gug for final meetings. In 2013, Mass was moved to Friday night; as a result, the walk now originates from the Gug. In 2022, Coach Freeman announced that the tradition of Mass before home games would return.

* Earlier on game day, the Band of the Fighting Irish trumpet section plays Notre Dame, Our Mother &amp; the Notre Dame victory march under the Golden Dome, with visitors standing at the bottom of the rotunda, and behind the band members on each upper floor.
*Coming out of the locker room, players slap the famous &quot;Play Like a Champion Today&quot; sign. This sign originated in 1986 when head coach Lou Holtz stumbled across a black and white photo of a similar sign, and wanted one for his own players. 
* Prior to the start of the game, with around 15–30 seconds left on the pregame clock, a clip of Cathy Richardson singing &quot;Here Come The Irish&quot; is played, followed up by I&#x27;m Shipping Up To Boston, which continues to play until the football is kicked off.
*Between the third and fourth quarters of home games, the Notre Dame Marching Band plays the finale to the 1812 Overture, as the crowd reacts with a synchronized waving of arms, with their fingers in the shape of the current coach&#x27;s first initial. As of 2023, this is an &quot;F&quot; for Marcus Freeman.
*Starting in 1960, Sergeant Tim McCarthy of the Indiana State Police read out a driving safety announcement to the crowd during the fourth quarter. When Sergeant McCarthy began his announcement, the crowd went silent to hear his message, which invariably ended with a pun. Sergeant McCarthy retired from this duty in the 2015 season after 55 years of fan-favorite messages. He was honored on the field on September 26, 2015, to deliver his last in-person address in which he repeated the same announcement he did on his first gameday. He died on October 1, 2020.
*At the conclusion of every home game, the team turns to the student section to salute them by raising their helmets in the air. They do this after a win or after a loss. Then, the band plays the Alma Mater, &quot;Notre Dame, Our Mother&quot;. Those who stay link arms and sing the lyrics.

==Irish in the NFL==
Since the NFL began drafting players in 1936, 495 Notre Dame football players have been selected by NFL teams. Additionally, Notre Dame has had 65 players selected in the first round of the NFL draft, including five overall number one picks. Of the 46 Super Bowls competed, as of 2012, only 14 teams have won the event without an Irish player on the roster. Looking at both participating team rosters, there have only been five Super Bowls that did not feature at least one former Notre Dame player on either team&#x27;s roster – Denver vs. Atlanta, 1999; Dallas vs. Buffalo, 1994; Washington vs. Denver, 1988; Dallas vs. Denver, 1978; and Baltimore vs. Dallas, 1971. Eleven former players have won multiple Super Bowls: Mark Bavaro, Rocky Bleier, Nick Buoniconti, Eric Dorsey, Dave Duerson, David Givens, Terry Hanratty, Bob Kuechenberg, Joe Montana, Steve Sylvester and Justin Tuck.

===Pro Football Hall of Fame===
13 former Notre Dame players, plus 1 non-player alumnus, have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, tying it for first with USC among all college football programs.

*1963: Curly Lambeau – Green Bay Packers (1919–1949), Chicago Cardinals (1950–1951), Washington Redskins (1952–1953).
*1963: Johnny &quot;Blood&quot; McNally* – Milwaukee Badgers (1925–1926), Duluth Eskimos (1926–1927), Pottsville Maroons (1928), Green Bay Packers (1929–1933, 1935–1936), Pittsburgh Pirates (1934, 1937–1938).

==Media==
The Fighting Irish are the only team, professional or collegiate, to have all their games broadcast nationally on the radio and their home games on television. Notre Dame famously left the College Football Association, a consortium that administered television broadcast rights on behalf of over 64 schools, in 1990, in order to establish its own broadcasting deal with NBC. From 1968 to 2007, Westwood One served as the official radio partner for the Irish, broadcasting their games for 40 consecutive years.

Until the 2006 Air Force game, Notre Dame had a record 169 consecutive games broadcast nationally on either NBC, ABC, ESPN, or CBS. The 2006 ND vs. Air Force game was broadcast on CSTV, a college sports channel owned by CBS who had an exclusive contract with the Mountain West Conference, of which Air Force is a member.

===Radio===
Radio rights to the Fighting Irish are held by Skyview Networks, who began distributing the broadcasts as part of a multi-sport arrangement in 2020.

NBC has been televising Notre Dame Home football games since the 1991 season. In addition to TV broadcasts, NBC also maintains several dedicated websites to ND football and Notre Dame Central, which provides complete coverage, full game replays and commentary of the Notre Dame team. NBC&#x27;s television contract with Notre Dame was renewed in April 2013 and was set to continue through the 2025 football season, before another contract renewal was made in 2023. NBC is now set to be the home of Notre Dame football through the 2029 season. It also aired football games on NBC&#x27;s streaming service Peacock started in the 2021 season, with the home opener on September 11, 2021, against Toledo aired exclusively on the streaming service. South Bend NBC affiliate WNDU-TV also produces its own pregame show, &quot;Countdown to Kickoff&quot;, which airs prior to every home game broadcast on NBC. Internationally Sky Sports has been covering Notre Dame Football home games in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Germany since 2018 as a result of Comcast&#x27;s takeover of Sky.

==Future schedules==
Although the Notre Dame football program is not a full member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), it has an agreement to play an average of five ACC schools per season. In return Notre Dame has access to the non-College Football Playoff ACC bowl line-up. Notre Dame utilizes a format of six home games in South Bend, five away games, and one major metropolitan area neutral site &quot;Shamrock Series&quot; home game for scheduling. This includes preserving traditional yearly rivalries with USC, Stanford, and Navy, five rotating ACC opponents (two away ACC games will coincide in even years with away games at Navy and three away ACC games will coincide in odd years with home games against Navy), two home and home series (one home game and one away game), one one-time opponent home game, and the traveling &quot;Shamrock Series&quot; home game.

<text>The [[British Railways]] standard class 2 2-6-2T is a scrapped class of steam locomotive, one of the standard classes of the 1950s.

== Design and construction ==
The class was designed at Derby Works and introduced in 1953. The design derived from the LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-2T which BR had built after nationalisation. Modifications were made to the Ivatt design including a reduced cab to reduce the loading gauge and some standard fittings. BR classified them 2MT, emphasising a mixed-traffic role.

As most services which required 2MT 2-6-2Ts were already served by the 130 Ivatt engines, B.R. only ordered 30 engines, which eliminated pre-grouping steam locomotives as much as possible on local services.

The first 20 engines were outshopped at Crewe Works, and intended for use on ex-London Midland and Scottish Railway routes, then known as the London Midland Region.
The second batch, this time built at Darlington Works, and were also the final steam locomotives built at Darlington were numbered 84020–84029, and intended for Southern Region lines.

== Liveries ==
Only two liveries were carried by the 2MTs- British Railway lined black with the earlier and later emblems. Although all locomotives received the latter, only 84000–84019 received the early emblem as the Darlington built locomotives were constructed in 1957, following the 1956 changeover to the late crest. The Darlington engines carried large high cab-side numerals, whilst the Crewe engines carried standard high numerals.

== Service ==

The LMR locomotives were used on push-pull routes, and were often allocated alongside the Ivatt 2MT 2-6-2T engines with which they shared most of their origins. Numbers 84021–84029, the Southern Region locomotives were all allocated to the Eastern Section depot at Ashford for use on the lines over Romney Marsh and local trains on the Margate via Canterbury West route. Most were transferred away to the North Eastern Region in the early 1960s following electrification, but several locomotives (including some of the LMR allocation) were re-allocated to Eastleigh in 1965 for possible use on the Isle of Wight, replacing life-expired LSWR O2 class engines, which were all over 70 years old by then. However, this plan did not cover a coaching stock replacement, and thus the locomotives were ultimately scrapped.
== Preservation ==
None of the class survived the cutter&#x27;s torch, although their size and configuration would have made them an ideal choice for use on heritage railways. However, four BR Standard Class 2 2-6-0 locomotives – the tender-equipped equivalent – did survive, and one of these, 78059, is being rebuilt into 2-6-2T &quot;84030&quot;. This takes the next number in the original series. 78059 was chosen primarily because it lost its tender, one of several sold for use elsewhere while at Woodham Brothers scrapyard, Barry. Further reasons cited by the Bluebell Railway, where 78059 is based, are the suitability of the locomotive class for the railway&#x27;s service trains, and because the tender version of the class was never allocated to the Southern Region, and hence the tank version (which &quot;was&quot; allocated there) is far more appropriate for the Bluebell&#x27;s Southern Region location. As of 2013, 78059 was considered to no longer exist, as the fitting of the hind engine frame extensions have turned it into 84030.

<text>HMS &quot;Starling&quot;, pennant number U66, was a Modified &quot;Black Swan&quot;-class sloop of the Royal Navy. She was active in the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War and was the most successful anti-submarine warfare vessel of the Royal Navy, being credited with the destruction of fourteen U-boats.

==Construction==

&quot;Starling&quot; was ordered on 18 July 1941 under the 1940 Supplementary War Building Programme; she was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at Govan, Scotland, on 21 October 1941. She was launched on 14 October 1942, and commissioned on 1 April 1943, with a build time of 17 months and 10 days.

==Service history==
&quot;Starling&quot; joined Western Approaches Command in April 1943 under the command of Captain Frederic John Walker, leader of the 2nd Support Group (2SG). This was a flotilla of six sloops not tied down to convoy protection, but free to hunt down U-boats wherever found. The other ships of the group were , , , , and .

&quot;Starling&quot;&#x27;s first patrol in May 1943 was uneventful; There were several major convoy battles during the month, but none involving 2 SG. &quot;Starling&quot;s first success came on 1 June 1943, when the group&#x27;s first U-boat was detected: fortuitously on a fine day and identified by Lt. Earl Howe Pitt. This event was dubbed another &quot;Glorious First of June&quot; by Walker. Over a 15-hour period the group found, tracked and destroyed , in the longest hunt of the Atlantic campaign up to that point.

On their return to Liverpool, &quot;Starling&quot; and 2SG were assigned to &quot;Operation Musketry&quot;, an attempt, in concert with Coastal Command, to interdict the U-boat transit routes across the Bay of Biscay. On 24 June 1943 the group was successful in destroying two U-boats; &quot;Starling&quot; destroyed , but was damaged when she rammed the U-boat to dispatch it. She was forced to return to Britain for repairs, under the temporary command of Cdr. DEG Wemyss of &quot;Wild Goose&quot;, Walker having stayed with the group.

In October, on returning to the group, &quot;Starling&quot; was involved in the battle around convoy ON 207. No successes were recorded, though the convoy battle saw three U-boats destroyed, with no ships lost.

In November 1943, in operations around HX 264, &quot;Starling&quot; and 2 SG accounted for two more U-boats, and .

In December, while in support of SL 140/MKS 31, &quot;Starling&quot; attacked and damaged , forcing it to abandon its attack.

In January 1944, supporting convoy SL 147/MKS 38, &quot;Starling&quot; shared in the destruction of .

In February she took part in the famous &quot;Six in one trip&quot; episode, where 2 SG destroyed six U-boats over a two-week period. &quot;Starling&quot; shared in the destruction of four of these; on 31 January, and on 9 February, and on 19 February.

In March 1944, &quot;Starling&quot; and 2 SG, accompanied by escort carrier &quot;Vindex&quot;, sought and destroyed , a U-boat on weather-reporting duty in the North Atlantic.
Later that month, while supporting Murmansk convoy JW 58, &quot;Starling&quot; met and destroyed in transit to the North Atlantic. She had no other success, though three U-boats were destroyed in attacks on JW 58.

In May the group responded to an attack on by . Though starting from 300 miles away Walker, in an inspired piece of work, divined where to search and after a three-day search gained contact. An 18-hour hunt brought &quot;U-473&quot; to the surface, where she was sunk by gunfire.

In June &quot;Starling&quot; was part of &quot;Operation Neptune&quot; in support of the Normandy landings, and was instrumental in preventing any attacks on the invasion fleet. In all fifteen U-boats were destroyed in attempts to attack the invasion fleet, though &quot;Starling&quot; herself had no success.

In July &quot;Starling&quot; suffered her heaviest blow when Capt. FJ Walker died of a cerebral haemorrhage, brought on by overwork and exhaustion.

Under her new captain, Cdr. NW Duck, &quot;Starling&quot; and 2 SG had another successful patrol in the Bay of Biscay in August when four U-boats were destroyed; &quot;Starling&quot; took part in three of these actions, against , , and .

In September &quot;Starling&quot; moved to 22EG, under Cdr. GWE Castens, but the U-boat war had changed character, and &quot;Starling&quot; saw little further success. The campaign became a hunt for single raiders operating in the shallow coastal waters, where a U-boat could hide among the wrecks on the sea bottom. Hunts for these &quot;lone wolves&quot; was a slow and tedious business, though merchant ship losses were kept to a minimum.

In January 1945 &quot;Starling&quot;, with ships of 22EG, attacked a promising target in the North Channel: They were credited, following examination of German records in the post-war period, with the destruction of . However this assessment was re-evaluated in 1991, and the credit was withdrawn; the attack was deemed to have been on a non-sub target.

With the end of the war in Europe &quot;Starling&quot; was earmarked for duty in the Pacific, but while re-fitting for this the war there ended. In September 1945 &quot;Starling&quot; paid off, and in October went into reserve.

==Post-war service==
In 1946 &quot;Starling&quot; was re-activated for service with , the Royal Navy&#x27;s Navigation Training School. She was modified as a Navigation training ship and remained in service for the next ten years.

In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

During her last year in commission, she visited the Norwegian fjords and the U-boat base at Kiel. Her final voyage was a call at Bootle Liverpool to attend a farewell celebration provided by the local authority and Captain Walker&#x27;s widow took passage on the final sailing from Bootle to Portsmouth where she paid off.

==Battle honours==
* Biscay 1943
* Atlantic 1943–45
* Arctic 1944
* Normandy 1944

==Successes==
&quot;Starling&quot; participated in the sinking of fourteen U-boats:
During the war the &quot;Starling&quot; was credited, along with the sloops , , , and frigate , with sinking the in the North Channel on 16 January 1945. The British Admiralty withdrew this credit in a post-war reassessment.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Starling&quot;″s service in the Arctic convoys (fictionalised as &quot;HMS &quot;Sparrow&quot;&quot;) is described in the prologue to children&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;The Salt-stained Book&quot; by Julia Jones (2011).

<text>A Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches (; also known as &quot;A Sportman&#x27;s Notebook&quot;, &quot;The Hunting Sketches&quot; and &quot;Sketches from a Hunter&#x27;s Album&quot;) is an 1852 cycle of short stories by Ivan Turgenev. It was the first major writing that gained him recognition.

This work is part of the Russian realist tradition in that the narrator is usually an uncommitted observer of the people he meets.

== Writing and publication ==
Turgenev based many of these short stories on his own observations while hunting at his mother&#x27;s estate at Spasskoye, where he learned of the abuse of the peasants and the injustices of the Russian system that constrained them. The frequent abuse of Turgenev by his mother certainly had an effect on this work.

The stories were first published singly in &quot;The Contemporary&quot; between 1847 and 1851 before appearing in 1852 in book form. Turgenev was about to give up writing when the first story, &quot;Khor and Kalinich&quot;, was well received. The work as a whole actually led to Turgenev&#x27;s house arrest (part of the reason, the other being his epitaph to Nikolai Gogol) at Spasskoye.

== The stories ==
===Khor and Kalinych===

Story of two peasants one who is extremely thrifty, and the other an idealist, both of whom work for a petty landowner named Polutykin. This introduces the role of the narrator as the uncommitted observer. Turgenev at once appears as a writer and an artist but also a social reformer and activist. The separation of the two peasants plays a big role in later works by the author, as he explained in a speech given in 1860 where he talks about the dichotomy of his &quot;Hamlet-like&quot; and &quot;Quixotic&quot; characters. The main idea here though is displaying the intelligence of the peasants and the idiocy of their master. It is also perhaps one of his strongest arguments in favor of Westernization in Russia.

===Yermolay and the Miller’s Wife===
Story of the narrator&#x27;s hunter friend and a night they spend at a miller&#x27;s home. This is the first sketch he appears in. The man, Zverkov, gives the reader a clear idea of the injustices of serfdom, this being the main idea of this particular story.

===Raspberry Water===
Story of the narrator meeting and talking to two peasants at a little spring called Raspberry Water (which did exist and still exists in Russia). Here the narrator is very distant, akin to early Realist narrators, and learns of the self-deprivation peasants take upon themselves through the recollections of the old peasant named Foggy.

===District Doctor===
Struck with fever in a small village, the narrator is visited by a district doctor who tells him a story of how he fell in love with a dying girl. It is told from his perspective rather than the narrator&#x27;s.

===My Neighbor Radilov===
Yermolay is with the narrator again. The story consists of them meeting a landowner named Radilov. They have dinner at his house and learn he is not a typical landowner and shows goodwill (he&#x27;s not gloomy about his fate either). He mentions when his wife died and how he didn&#x27;t really shed a tear until he saw a fly crawl over her eye. Radilov disappears at the end and the family he lived with does not know where he went.

===Farmer Ovsyanikov===

The narrator talks with a poor landowner. The landowner tells stories about his and the narrator&#x27;s ancestors, other nobles of the area, and the social ills of serfdom. The story takes place entirely within the freeholder&#x27;s home.

===Lgov===
Yermolay and the narrator go hunting and meet up with Old Knot, an old peasant who is the local fisherman and has held several ridiculous positions in the area. This story is particularly noteworthy for its vivid character descriptions. The group goes hunting in the lake with a pretentious hunter named Vladimir, sink the boat and then wade to shore filthy after great difficulty.

===Bezhin Lea===
The opening of this story begins with a highly stylized and poetic depiction of the beauty of the countryside during the day. The narrator, in one of his hunting expeditions, gets lost in the woods. As night approaches, he comes across a clearing, where he meets up with five peasant boys near a fire who are grazing the horses. The narrator pretends to be asleep and the boys forget he is there and start exchanging scary tales with each other. This story juxtaposes the natural beauty of the world with the terrifying essence of the “supernatural”.

===Kasyan from the Beautiful Lands===

While in a carriage the narrator comes across a funeral procession and goes to Yudin village to get a new axle when theirs breaks. There he meets Kasyan, a fifty-year-old dwarf who lives in the village and who belongs to some unnamed religious sect. He takes them to get a new axle and the narrator notices how at one he seems with his environment and incredibly generous. Kasyan establishes his hatred of established society through his glorification of the world of folklore.

===Bailiff===
Story about the bailiff (Sofron) of a landowner friend of the narrator who is more in control of the land than Arkady Penochkin. He uses the peasants and steals their money from loans. This story is one of the most vivid examples of the peasantry&#x27;s exploitation.

===The Office===
The narrator comes upon a small hut and travels to a village after speaking with an old man there. He comes across a run-down shack that is the main office of the local landowner. He stays there and overhears the head clerk abusing his powers and learns how he uses Losnyakova to abuse the peasants, for example sending away the lover of a young man so they cannot get married. The main idea here is the presentation of the ridiculous bureaucracy created to control the peasants.

===Loner===
At night in a droshky, the narrator comes across a man, Foma, in the forest who watches over his landowner&#x27;s property so peasants don&#x27;t steal wood. He learns the man&#x27;s wife left him and their children alone and finds his home incredibly depressing. Foma eventually hears a peasant chopping down a tree and they go out to confront him. The forester takes him to his home and threatens to turn him into the landowner. The narrator tries to buy the peasant&#x27;s wood so he can be set free, and though they fight at first, Foma eventually agrees and pushes the man out the door. Unlike the previous stories, this work was not featured in “The Contemporary” and was only later added to the sketches in 1852.

===Two Landowners===
Story of two different landowners the narrator knows, with descriptions of mistreatment of the peasants including beatings and descriptions of their miserable huts. This again, gives the reader more callous examples of the treatment of the peasantry.

===Lebedyan===
Story about a village where the narrator comes across the horse fair. Of particular interest is the lieutenant Khlopakov, who uses catch phrases out of context regardless if they sound strange, which amuses his friend Zhukov. The narrator looks at horses and decides to purchase one, which ends up being lame but he gives up trying to get his money back for it when he realizes the seller&#x27;s scheme. Turgenev&#x27;s intentions here were to display the typical events at a local fair.

===Tatyana Borisovna and her Nephew===
Story about the modest landowner Tatyana whom everyone loves because she is so generous. In spite of being illiterate she is generous to everyone and does not care for typical dealings that landowners spend their time on and does not care for other women landowners in her area. In the story her nephew Andryusha (an orphan) comes to live with her and loves to draw. He eventually gains the interest of Pyotr Benevolensky, a local collegiate counsellor who is a minor acquaintance of Tatyana, who then takes him to St. Petersburg to be trained in art. When he returns, after asking his aunt for money through the mail several times, she finds he has become Benevolensky and is corrupted. He is fat and annoying and spends his time poorly singing words to songs written by Glinka. Her friends stop visiting her because he is so annoying.

===Death===
In this story the narrator opens with a hunting story concerning his neighbor. They find the trees in the area dying with many fallen onto the ground because of a terrible frost (this is an actual event from Russia in 1840). After this he and his friend come upon a peasant who they are told has been smashed by a tree and they watch him die. This reminds the narrator of several stories he remembers about dying and he uses them to explain how the Russian character presents itself when dying. Each character continues as if performing a ritual, not lamenting or even caring. One old woman, with her final breath, reaches for a ruble under her pillow to pay the priest who says her last rites. Here Turgenev appears to be commenting on the isolation of human personality in the face of nature.

===Singers===

The narrator comes across a “terrible village” and goes to a tavern set at the end of a ravine. In the tavern he finds that some locals are having a singing contest. The one, Yakov, has the gift of technical prowess. The other, Yasha, has natural talent. Yakov goes first and the group believes he&#x27;s won due to the skill he displays but when Yasha sings, he sings beautifully with the “collective voice of the Russian identity,” leading everyone to cry with no discussion of his skill afterward. Yakov stammers that he won and they are about to drink, but the narrator is disturbed by this since he found the scene so beautiful amongst the horrible surroundings, and he goes outside to sleep while they drink. He leaves while hearing peasant boys calling to each other in the night.

===Pyotr Petrovich Karataev===
While at a post, the narrator meets a lower, uneducated landowner named Karataev who has lost his land because of an IOU. He learns from him that he once fell in love with a peasant girl named Matroyna, owned by another landowner. He attempts to buy her from the woman, but she forbids it because she simply does not want to and sends her away to another village. Karataev, in desperation, finds her and brings her home where he hides her for a time, eluding authorities by placing her away from his home. In the end she gives herself up and Karataev goes off to Moscow, where the narrator finds him later happy amongst friends but completely broke.

===Meeting===
While out hunting, the narrator happens to witness the meeting of a peasant girl who is in love with a pampered, pompous valet. When he comes he treats her disdainfully and leaves her to say he is going away after announcing he cannot marry her. The girl sheds tears and the narrator goes to her when she almost collapses, but she runs away when she notices him.

===Hamlet of the Shchigrovsky District===

In this story the narrator spends the evening at a party of a landowner named Alexander G. Here Turgenev gives excellent descriptions and parodies of the nobility. While attempting to go to sleep, the narrator finds his roommate unable to sleep as well and finds out that he is a man who has realized his uniqueness amongst the upper class, even though he is considered a wit. He is forever cursed to deep introspection and finds in himself nothing save a molded being with no true life. He leaves early in the morning without saying goodbye and the narrator never learns his name.

===Chertopkhanov and Nedopyuskin===
While hunting with Yermolay, the narrator comes across the landowner Chertopkhanov. He goes away on his horse and another man comes up, his friend Nedopyuskin. Chertopkhanov is the inheritor of a mortgaged little village called Unsleepy Hollow. His friend, Nedopyuskin, became close to him when the former saved him from a crowd of nobles who were tormenting him for being the inheritor of an estate despite the fact that he was so completely devoid of any bit of notoriety for anything. The two bachelors became the best of friends and live together at Unsleepy Hollow in peaceful tranquility in spite of the disrepair of the area. They embody the “loner” figure Turgenev was so interested in, able to live independently in the system.

===The End of Chertopkhanov===
Sequel to the previous story, though published much later in 1872. It was originally not part of the sketches. This story is more sequential than the previous, detailing the end of the landowner up to his death. He faces three misfortunes. The first is his love Masha leaving him in true “gypsy” spirit. The second is Nedopyuskin dying of a stroke. The third and final is the loss of his horse Malek Adel, the envy of local landowners who know of Chertopkhanov. One night it is stolen and he does everything in his power to find it, eventually coming across the horse at a fair. He buys it back and brings it home, but something bothers him about it. He begins to realize that the horse is not truly Malek Adel but one that looks like it and in despair he eventually shoots the animal in the head and stays in his bed afterwards. He no longer looks like himself, but when his servant comes up to him the last bit of his being comes forth and he declares that the nobleman Chertopkhanov is dying and no one can stand in his way.

===Living Relic===
This story was originally not part of the sketches either and appeared in another collection of stories first in 1874. Here, the narrator comes back to his home estate to find a beautiful servant named Lukeria in a horrible state. After falling from a porch she succumbs to an unknown digestive disorder (not explicitly stated, but implied) that reduces her to an unmoving, skeletal figure. She spends her time in the shed in the summer and near the house in the winter, moved about by the house servants who remain. The narrator is shaken by her disturbing ability to accept her fate, regardless of how terrible it may be. She is completely unable to move and finds her days accented only by the occasional sounds of new birds in the shed, smells, or a rabbit that may occasionally come in to visit her. She eventually dies in peace, completely aware that the day was coming because she saw it in her dreams. This story is slightly different from the others because of the inclusion of the “unreal” found in Lukeria&#x27;s dream states. The narrator is heartbroken by her condition, but is surprised to find her happy with life in spite of her state. Suggestions have been made that she is so happy because in her inability to move she is also unable to sin.

===The Clatter of Wheels===
Also added later to the sketches, but published after the original group in 1874. In this story Yermolay and the narrator find they are almost out of shot, so they decide to go to Tula to get more and fetch a peasant named Filofey. He takes the narrator there, Yermolay stays behind, but on the way hears a carriage clattering far in the distance that he is sure is a group of bandits who will surely murder them when they catch up. The carriage slowly overcomes them in spite of what they try and eventually comes in front of them. Several men are on it singing and laughing, completely drunk. Filofey tries to steer around but every time he does the head carriage moves into their way. When they come to a bridge the carriage stops and the largest of the men approaches. The narrator is sure they are to be killed but is surprised when he finds the drunk man only asking for a bit of money for drinks, stating they have just come from a wedding and want a bit more to celebrate. The narrator and Filofey are relieved and joke with each other about the event, but learn later on that on that very night a merchant was killed on the road and had his carriage stolen. Though uncertain and still joking, they wonder if the carriage that passed them was not in fact from a wedding at all.

===Forest and Steppe===
The traditional ending to the sketches, found in every edition. Here, Turgenev gives the readers detailed and beautiful descriptions of the hunter&#x27;s life, ending the collection.

==Unfinished works==
===The Russian German===
An incomplete, short fragment first published in 1964 and never part of the original sketches. Here, the narrator comes across a German landowner in Russia. It is likely he kept this sketch out and never finished it because it did not present a picture of the typical, “Russian” landowner. Here though, he seems to be hinting that the “game” of the sketches is in fact the evils of serfdom and the failures of landowners.

===The Reformer and the Russian German===
Another incomplete, though slightly longer, fragment. This may have been a later version of the previous fragment or another fragment itself. It&#x27;s completely different, with different characters, and again provides the readers with examples of the failures and cruelties of serfdom.

== Critical response and legacy ==

Frank O&#x27;Connor wrote

&quot;A Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches&quot; may well be the greatest book of short stories ever written. Nobody, at the time that it was written, knew quite how great it was, or what influence it was to have in the creation of a new art form.

O&#x27;Connor argued that Turgenev&#x27;s style was &quot;interesting principally because episodic interest is almost entirely suppressed&quot; and that Turgenev was the first to abandon narrative in this way.

Vladimir Nabokov wrote

Turgenev&#x27;s plastic musical flowing prose was but one of the reasons that brought him immediate fame, for at least as much interest was contributed by the special subject of these stories. They were all written about serfs and not only present a detailed psychological study, but go even further to idealize these serfs as superior in their human quality to their heartless masters.
Other world writers also admired Turgenev&#x27;s style. Sherwood Anderson was particularly influenced by Turgenev&#x27;s literature. He considered &quot;A Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches&quot; to be a paradigm for his own short stories.

More recently, Turgenev has been criticized for his somewhat idealized characterization of muzhiks. Turgenev&#x27;s muzhiks have been compared to other noble savages in 19th-century fiction (such as American Indians in works by J. F. Cooper).

<doc id="1245710" wikidata="Q3324749" url="?curid=1245710" title="Moses Cleaveland">
<text>Moses Cleaveland (January 29, 1754 – November 16, 1806) was an American lawyer, politician, soldier, and surveyor from Connecticut who founded the city of Cleveland, Ohio, while surveying the Connecticut Western Reserve in 1796. During the American Revolution, Cleaveland was the brigadier general of the Connecticut militia.

==Early life==
Cleaveland was born in Canterbury, Connecticut Colony, to Colonel Aaron Cleaveland (1725–1785) and Thankful Cleaveland (1733–1822). He studied law at Yale College, where he was a member of Brothers in Unity, graduating in 1777. He was commissioned as an ensign in the 2nd Connecticut Regiment of the Continental Army in 1777 during the American Revolution. In 1779, he was promoted to captain of a company of &quot;sappers and miners&quot; (combat engineers) in the newly formed Corps of Engineers. He resigned from the army on June 7, 1781, and started a legal practice in Canterbury.

==Militia career==
Cleaveland was a member of the Connecticut convention that ratified the United States Constitution. He was elected to the Connecticut General Assembly several times and was commissioned brigadier general of militia in 1796. He was a shareholder in the Connecticut Land Company which had purchased land from Connecticut located in northeastern Ohio for $1,200,000. The land was reserved to Connecticut by Congress and was initially known as New Connecticut, but it came to be known as the Western Reserve.

Cleaveland was approached by the directors of the company in May 1796 and asked to lead the survey of the tract and the location of purchases. He was also responsible for the negotiations with the Native Americans living on the land. In June 1796, he set out from Schenectady, New York. His party was composed of 50 people, including six surveyors, a physician, a chaplain, a boatman, 37 employees, a few emigrants, and two women who accompanied their husbands. Some journeyed by land with the horses and cattle, while the main body went in boats up the Mohawk River, down the Oswego River, along the shore of Lake Ontario, and up the Niagara River, carrying their boats over the seven-mile portage at Niagara Falls.

==Personal life==
Cleaveland married Esther Champion on March 2, 1797, with whom he had four children.

==Founding of Cleveland==
At Buffalo, a delegation from the nearby Mohawk and Seneca tribes opposed the party&#x27;s entrance into the Western Reserve, claiming it as their territory, but they waived their rights on the receipt of goods valued at $1,200. The expedition then coasted along the shore of Lake Erie and landed at the mouth of Conneaut Creek on July 4, 1796, which they named Port Independence. Nearby Native Americans were upset at the encroachment on their land, but they were appeased with gifts of beads and whiskey and allowed the surveys to proceed.

General Cleaveland coasted along the shore with a surveying party and landed at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River on July 22, 1796. He ascended the bank and determined that the spot was a favorable site for a city, with the river on the west and Lake Erie on the north. He had it surveyed into town lots, and the employees named the place Cleaveland in his honor. There were four settlers the first year, and growth was slow initially, reaching only 150 inhabitants in 1820. Cleaveland went home to Connecticut after the 1796 expedition and never returned to Ohio or the city that bears his name. He died in Canterbury, Connecticut, where he is also buried, but a statue of him stands in the Cleveland Public Square.

The settlement of &quot;Cleaveland&quot; eventually became known as &quot;Cleveland&quot;. One theory is that Cleaveland&#x27;s surveying party misspelled the name on their original map. In the early 1800s a local newspaper, the &quot;Cleveland Advertiser&quot;, chose the &quot;Cleveland&quot; spelling, which was then adopted by a rival newspaper. A local legend claims that the words &quot;Cleaveland Advertiser&quot; would not fit on a front-page banner, so the printer removed the extra &quot;a&quot; to make room, and the spelling stuck.

== Moses Cleaveland Trees ==
Moses Cleaveland is not only remembered through the city&#x27;s name but through living monuments in the form of trees throughout the Greater Cleveland area. As part of the 150-year anniversary of Moses Cleaveland&#x27;s party coming to the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, Arthur B. Williams of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History proposed that trees should be identified and labeled if they were alive when Moses Cleaveland came to the region where the city would be. In 1946, 242 trees from 23 different tree species were nominated to become an official Moses Cleaveland Tree. 

Each tree&#x27;s age was verified, and the list of Moses Cleaveland Trees was reduced to 150 trees that were accessible to the public. Each tree was fashioned with a commemorative metal plaque that identified it as one of the Moses Cleaveland Trees. Since this project began in 1946, more trees have been designated as Moses Cleaveland Trees in part due to some of the first designated trees having died. There are around 270 Moses Cleaveland Trees as of 2024.

<text>Yeading F.C. were an English football club from Yeading in the London Borough of Hillingdon, west London. In 2007 they merged with Hayes to form Hayes &amp; Yeading United.

==Club history==
Their roots trace to a youth club formed in Yeading in 1960. They have been known as Yeading Football Club after 1965. However, they remained in the junior and intermediate ranks until the 1980s when they were at last granted senior status, joining the old London Spartan League in 1984 and the Isthmian League in 1987. In 1990 they won their first national title, the FA Vase, as well as their regional division of the league. The following year they were promoted to the league&#x27;s Premier Division for the first time but were relegated in 1998.

After the Isthmian League Division One was divided in 2002 they were placed in Division One North. They won the championship of that league in the 2003–04 season, returning to the Premier Division. A strong start to the season was crowned on 5 December 2004 with their being drawn at home to Premiership side Newcastle United in the third round of the FA Cup, after beating Slough Town 3–1. Yeading&#x27;s average league game attendance of 137 contrasted with Newcastle&#x27;s nearly 52,000. After some confusion as to whether the game could be played in front of 2,300 at Yeading&#x27;s ground, The Warren, it was decided to play it on 9 January 2005 at Loftus Road, and the crowd numbered 10,824. A scoreless first half held out hope of an upset but two second-half Newcastle United goals decided the game. Yeading went on to win the Isthmian League championship that season, earning promotion to Conference South.

On 28 October 2006, Yeading were drawn against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup first round. The game was one of the biggest in their history, going up against former back to back European Champions. Yeading were hoping to upset the East Midlands team, but the task proved too much for The Ding, as they were emphatically beaten 5–0.

On 18 May 2007, Yeading announced that they would be forming a merger with fellow Conference South side Hayes. The new club retained its place in the Conference South, and is now known as Hayes &amp; Yeading United.

==Stadium==
The club played at The Warren. The ground is located just off Springfield Road in Hayes, Middlesex. When Yeading merged with Hayes, the Warren fell into disuse as Hayes&#x27; Church Road became the new club&#x27;s ground. It was still used for youth and reserve team purposes until Church Road was sold to fund the building of a new stadium on the same site as The Warren. Following the stadium&#x27;s demolition, The SkyEx Community Stadium was built and opened in 2016. One terrace from The Warren still stands, outside the new stadium behind one of the goals.

==Records==
*FA Cup best performance: third round proper – 2004–05
*FA Trophy best performance: third round proper – 2006–07
*FA Vase best performance: winners – 1989–90

<text>Fathers and Sons (; &quot;Otcy i deti&quot;, ; pre-1918 spelling Отцы и дѣти), literally Fathers and Children, is an 1862 novel by Ivan Turgenev, published in Moscow by Grachev &amp; Co on 23 February 1862. It is one of the most acclaimed Russian novels of the 19th century.

==Plot==
University graduate Arkady Kirsanov returns to his father&#x27;s modest estate, called Marino. Arkady brings his friend, Eugene Bazarov. His father, Nikolay, gladly receives the two young men at his estate, but Nikolay&#x27;s brother, Pavel, soon becomes upset by the strange new philosophy called &quot;nihilism&quot; that the young men advocate.

Nikolay, initially delighted to have his son return home, slowly begins to feel uneasy. A certain awkwardness develops in his regard toward his son, as Arkady&#x27;s radical views, much influenced by Bazarov, make Nikolay&#x27;s own beliefs feel dated. Nikolay has always tried to stay as current as possible, by doing things such as visiting his son at school so the two can stay as close as they can, but this in Nikolay&#x27;s eyes has failed. To complicate this, the father has taken a servant, Fenechka, into his house to live with him and has already had a son by her, named Mitya. Arkady, however, is not troubled by the relationship; on the contrary, he is delighted by the addition of a younger brother.

The two young men stay at Marino for some weeks, then decide to visit a relative of Arkady&#x27;s. There, they observe the local gentry and meet Madame Anna Sergevna Odintsova, an elegant woman of independent means, who cuts a seductively different figure from conventional types of the local provincial society. Both are greatly attracted to her, and she, intrigued by Bazarov&#x27;s singular manner, invites them to spend a few days at her estate, Nikolskoye.

At Nikolskoye, they also meet Katya, Madame Odintsova&#x27;s sister. Although they stay for just a short time, Arkady steadily becomes more independent of Bazarov&#x27;s influence. Bazarov finds falling in love distressing because it runs counter to his nihilist beliefs. Eventually, prompted by Madame Odintsova&#x27;s own cautious expressions of attraction to him, he announces that he loves her. She does not respond positively to his declaration; she finds his devaluation of feelings and of the aesthetic side of existence unattractive. She does not see the possibility of a good future with him. After his avowal of love, and her failure to make a similar declaration, Bazarov proceeds to his parents&#x27; home, and Arkady goes with him.

At Bazarov&#x27;s home, they are received enthusiastically by his parents, who adore him. Bazarov&#x27;s social cynicism is still on display as he settles back into his own family&#x27;s home again. Arkady, who has delighted Bazarov&#x27;s father by assuring him that his son has a brilliant future in store, reproves his friend for his brusqueness. Later, Bazarov and Arkady nearly come to blows after Bazarov speaks insultingly of Arkady&#x27;s uncle and chides Arkady for expressing himself too romantically. Arkady becomes more openly skeptical of Bazarov&#x27;s ideals. After a brief stay, much to the parents&#x27; disappointment, they decide to return to Marino, stopping on the way to see Madame Odintsova, who receives them coolly. Embarrassed, they leave almost immediately and return to Arkady&#x27;s home.

Arkady remains for only a few days and makes an excuse to leave in order to go to Nikolskoye again. Once there, he realizes he is not in love with Odintsova, but instead with her sister Katya. Bazarov stays at Marino to do some scientific research, and tension between him and Pavel increases. Bazarov enjoys talking with Fenechka and playing with her child, and one day he kisses her, against her will. Pavel observes this kiss and challenges Bazarov to a duel. Pavel is wounded in the leg, and Bazarov must leave Marino, going to his parents&#x27; home. Meanwhile, Arkady and Katya have fallen in love and have become engaged.

While back at home, Bazarov begins to help his father as a country doctor. He cannot keep his mind on his work, though, and while performing an autopsy, he cuts himself and becomes infected. On his deathbed, he sends for Madame Odintsova, who arrives just in time to hear Bazarov tell her how beautiful she is. She kisses him on the forehead and leaves; Bazarov dies the following day.

Arkady marries Katya and assumes the management of his father&#x27;s estate. His father marries Fenechka and is delighted to have Arkady home with him. The novel closes with a scene of Bazarov&#x27;s parents praying by his graveside.

==Major characters==
In order of appearance&lt;br&gt;

&quot;Chapter 1&quot;

* Nikoláy Petróvich Kirsánov – A gentleman in his early forties, a widower, &quot;quite grey now, stoutish and a trifle bent,&quot; a liberal democrat, father of Arkády, brother of Pavel; should have followed his father&#x27;s career in the army but broke his leg on the day he was commissioned and had to go into the civil service; owns Maryino, &quot;a respectable little property of his consisting of a couple of hundred serfs—or five thousand acres.&quot; He is thrilled to have his son back from college. 

&quot;Chapter 2&quot;
* Arkády Nikoláyevich Kirsánov – Son of Nikoláy Petróvich; having recently graduated from St. Petersburg University, he brings his friend of Bazarov home to Maryino. He has become a nihilist more from Bazarov&#x27;s influence than from conviction. He becomes enamored of Anna Sergeyevna Odinisov, but cannot compete for her affections with his fascinating friend Bazarov. Later he falls in love with Anna Sergeyevna&#x27;s quiet, modest young sister Katya and marries her. 
* Yevgény Vasílevich Bazárov – A medical student and nihilist, in which role he serves as a mentor to Arkady, and as a challenger to the liberal ideas of the Kirsanov brothers and the traditional Russian Orthodox feelings of his own parents. &quot;A long thin face with a broad forehead...large greenish eyes and drooping, sandy whiskers — the whole animated by a tranquil smile betokening self-assurance and intelligence.&quot; He eventually dies of pyaemia carelessly contracted during a medical examination, accepting his fate with calm resignation. 

&quot;Chapter 4&quot;

* Prokofyich – a servant of the Kirsánovs&#x27;s; &quot;A man of about sixty ... white-haired, lean and dark-complexioned.&quot;
* Pável Petróvich Kirsánov – Nikoláy Petróvich’s brother; &quot;...of medium height ... looked about forty-five ... close-cropped grey hair ... his face the colour of old ivory but without a wrinkle ... unusually regular and clean-cut features ... perfumed mustaches.&quot; A bourgeois with aristocratic pretensions (&quot;an exquisite pink hand having long tapering pink nails&quot;), he prides himself on his refinement but, like his brother, is reform-minded. Although he recognizes Bazarov as the son of a local doctor, he detests him &quot;with every fiber of his being,&quot; thinking him &quot;an arrogant, impudent fellow, a cynic and a vulgarian.&quot;

* &quot;Fénechka&quot; (Feodósya Nikoláyevna) – &quot;...a young woman of about three and twenty with a soft white skin, dark hair and eyes, red childishly-pouting lips and small delicate hands.&quot; Daughter of the late housekeeper at Maryino with whom Nikoláy Petróvich has fallen in love and fathered a son, named Mitya; Arkady welcomes having a little half-brother. The implied obstacles to marriage are difference in class, and perhaps Nikoláy Petróvich&#x27;s previous marriage — the burden of &#x27;traditionalist&#x27; values.
&quot;Chapter 12&quot;
* Matvei Ilyich Kolyazin – A cousin of the Kirsanov brothers who serves as the inspector of the provincial governor in a nearby town. He is pompous and self-important but &quot;he was always being made a fool of, and any moderately experienced official could twist him round his finger.&quot;
* Víktor Sítnikov – A pompous and foolhardy friend of Bazarov who joins populist ideals and groups. Like Arkady, he is heavily influenced by Bazarov in his ideals. &quot;I appreciate the comforts of life...but that doesn&#x27;t prevent me from being a liberal.&quot; 

&quot;Chapter 13&quot;
* Avdótya (Yevdoksíya) Nikitíshna Kúkshina – An emancipated woman who lives in the town where Matvei Ilyich is posted. Kukshina is independent but rather eccentric and incapable as a proto-feminist, despite her potential.
&quot;Chapter 14&quot;
* Ánna Sergéyevna Odíntsova – A wealthy widow, 29 years old, who entertains the nihilist friends at her estate; &quot;...rather a strange person. Having no prejudices of any kind, and no strong convictions even, she was not put off by obstacles and she had no goal in life...Arkady decided he had never yet met such a fascinating woman. The sound of her voice haunted his ears...her every movement was wonderfully flowing and natural.&quot; However, the young Arkady does not fascinate her the way the worldly Bazarov does. They experience a rift, but she hurries to his bedside upon hearing that he&#x27;s dying. 

&quot;Chapter 16&quot;

* Yekaterína (Kátya) Sergéyevna Lókteva – The younger sister of Anna: &quot;...a girl of eighteen with black hair, an olive complexion, a rather round but pleasing face and small dark eyes.&quot; She lives comfortably with her sister but lacks confidence, finding it hard to escape Anna Sergeevna&#x27;s shadow. This shyness makes her and Arkady’s love slow to realize itself.
* The Princess – Ánna Sergéyevna&#x27;s aunt, &quot;...a small shriveled woman with a clenched fist of a face and glaring spiteful eyes under a grey wig...&quot; Rude and overbearing but essentially ignored by the household. 

&quot;Chapter 20&quot;
* Vasíly Ivánovich Bazárov – Bazarov’s father. A retired army surgeon, and a small countryside land/serf holder. Educated and enlightened, he nonetheless feels, like many of the characters, that rural isolation has left him out of touch with modern ideas. He thus retains loyalty to traditionalist ways, manifested particularly in devotion to God and to his son Yevgeny. &quot;&#x27;A comical old chap with a heart of gold&#x27;,&quot; in his son&#x27;s words.
* Arína Vlásevna Bazárova – Bazarov’s mother. A very traditional woman of the 15th-century Moscovy style aristocracy and a pious follower of Orthodox Christianity, woven with folk tales and falsehoods. She loves her son deeply but is also terrified of him and his rejection of all beliefs.

==Historical context and notes==
The fathers and children of the novel refers to the growing divide between the two generations of Russians, and the character Yevgeny Bazarov, a nihilist who rejects the old order.

Turgenev wrote &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; as a response to the growing cultural schism that he saw between liberals of the 1830s/1840s and the growing nihilist movement. Both the nihilists (the &quot;sons&quot;) and the 1830s liberals (the &quot;fathers&quot;) sought Western-based social change in Russia. Additionally, these two modes of thought were contrasted with the Slavophiles, who believed that Russia&#x27;s path lay in its traditional spirituality.

Turgenev&#x27;s novel was responsible for popularizing the use of the term nihilism, which became widely used after the novel was published.

&quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; might be regarded as the first wholly modern novel in Russian literature (Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, another main contender, was referred to by the author as a poem or epic in prose as in the style of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, and was at any rate never completed). The novel introduces a dual character study, as seen with the gradual breakdown of Bazarov&#x27;s and Arkady&#x27;s nihilistic opposition to emotional display, especially in the case of Bazarov&#x27;s love for Madame Odintsova.

The novel is also the first Russian work to gain prominence in the Western world, eventually gaining the approval of well established novelists Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant, and Henry James.

The Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Bazarov adopted his pseudonym from the character of Yevgeny Bazarov in this novel.

<text>Heimat is a series of films written and directed by Edgar Reitz about life in Germany from the 1840s to 2000 through the eyes of a family from the Hunsrück area of the Rhineland-Palatinate. The family&#x27;s personal and domestic life is set against the backdrop of wider social and political events. The combined length of the 5 films — broken into 32 episodes — is 59 hours and 32 minutes, making it one of the longest series of feature-length films in cinema history.

The title &quot;Heimat&quot; () is a German word, often translated as &quot;homeland&quot; or &quot;home place&quot;, but it has been opined that the word has no true English equivalent. Usage has come to include that of an ironic reference to the film genre known as &quot;Heimatfilm&quot; which was popular in Germany in the 1950s. &quot;Heimat&quot; films were characterised by rural settings, sentimental tone and simplistic morality.

Aesthetically, the series is notable for the frequent switching between colour and black-and-white film to convey different emotional states. In 1987 it won a BAFTA for &quot;Foreign Television Programme&quot;.

The first &quot;Heimat&quot; film that covered the years 1918 to 1982, was released in 1984. It was followed by &quot;Die Zweite Heimat&quot; in 1993, that is set during the 1960s. In 2003, a direct sequel to both previous films was released, with lead actors from both films returning as their characters. In 2006, &quot;Heimat Fragments&quot; was released, which was made using unused footage and outtakes from the previous three films, along with newly filmed material to produce. A prequel film to the original was released in 2013.

==Background==
===&quot;Tales from the Hunsrück Villages&quot;===
Before creating the &quot;Heimat&quot; series, Edgar Reitz produced a documentary during 1980–81 about people from his home region, the Hunsrück, where he later set the &quot;Heimat&quot; series. In &quot;Geschichten aus den Hunsrückdörfern&quot; () he showed people who had not left the region, unlike &quot;Heimat&quot;&#x27;s theme of leaving home. This documentary is not considered to be part of the core &quot;Heimat&quot; series but set the stage for the work to come a few years later.

===Autobiographical elements===
Berkeley film and media professor Anton Kaes argued that &quot;auteur&quot; film-maker Reitz&#x27;s trilogy was autobiographical. Reitz and Paul Simon, his fictional character in &quot;Heimat&quot;, had fathers who were skilled craftsmen. Edgar Reitz was born in 1932 and Paul Simon in 1898 in Hunsrück. They grew up there, then left when they were in their twenties and returned in their fifties. Like Hermann Simon in the 1950s, Reitz left rural life for the world of German urban avant-garde arts and intelligentsia. Reitz worked at the Institute of Film Design in Ulm, while Hermann became a celebrated conductor in Munich. Wealthy American entrepreneur Paul Simon returned to Hunsrück only briefly when the war ended, but Hermann Simon&#x27;s return was more permanent. He and his lover Clarissa restored a house overlooking the Rhine that lay in ruins, eventually composing music for representing and celebrating his relationship to &quot;Heimat&quot;. Both Hermann and Reitz &quot;dramatized the tensions between staying home, leaving and returning&quot; (Kaes 1989:164), Hermann through music and Reitz through film.

==Development==
After watching &quot;Holocaust&quot;, Reitz was offended by the American &#x27;melodramaticisation&#x27; of the tragic events and the positive reception the film received. In 1979, Reitz began to make notes of his own life and completed a 250-page screenplay draft based upon his youth. Later in the year, Reitz contacted and together after what was planned to be a single night, they stayed for the next thirteen months in a small hut in Woppenroth writing a script. They became friendly with the local villagers and invited them to comment on the characters and incidents in the story. 
In 1980, Reitz and Steinbach completed a 2,000-page screenplay. The success of &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; had convinced television production companies that there was a market for sagas. After some haggling, Reitz managed to secure funding for the length of the script and remodeling of five Hunsrück villages.

Shooting began on the first film in May 1981, and continued for eighteen months. The cast consisted of 140 speaking parts, 32 full-time actors, 15 non-professional actors and 3,862 extras. Many of the cast had limited stage experience or no acting experience at all. While shooting, the villagers became heavily involved in the project and helped with re-modelling or set changes depending on the time period. Villagers put out advertisements in nearby villages in hope to find authentic items that could be used as props.

During shooting, Reitz decided that certain elements required extra emphasis that only colour could provide. However, Reitz was quick to deny any theories behind the alternations between black-and-white and colour.

Thirteen months were required for editing with Reitz working alongside Heidi Handorf. Together they created an eighteen-hour rough cut that was later trimmed to just over fifteen hours. Post-production continued until the premiere at Munich Film Festival in 1984. The entire project had taken over five years to complete.

While making &quot;Heimat&quot;, Reitz had become interested in developing a series of love stories with the working title of &quot;Men and Women&quot;. However, in October 1985, Reitz decided to make these tales the basis of &quot;Die Zweite Heimat&quot; (). The film follows the character Hermann as he leaves to study music in Munich and meets new friends, who are all following their own dreams.

Running at over 25 hours, &quot;Die Zweite Heimat&quot; took over six years to write and production lasted 557 days, between 1988 and 1992. The cast comprised 71 leading actors, 310 supporting actors and 2,300 extras. The film&#x27;s soundtrack also became the longest soundtrack ever produced.

==Films==

===&quot;Heimat&quot;===
&quot;Heimat&quot;, the original series, premiered in 1984 and follows the life of Maria Simon, a woman living in the fictional village of Schabbach. It was filmed in and around the village of Woppenroth in Rhein-Hunsrück, a rural region of Germany to the west of the Rhineland-Palatinate. Subtitled &quot;Eine Deutsche Chronik — A German Chronicle&quot;, it consists of 11 episodes running in total to 15 hours 24 minutes of screen time. The film spans 1919 to 1982, and depicts how historical events affect the Simon family and the community in which they lived. At the start of each episode, Karl Glasisch narrates the story so far over photographs by Eduard Simon. The digitally remastered version merged some of the episodes together, resulting in seven episodes instead of eleven. No material was cut.
===&quot;Die zweite Heimat&quot; (&quot;Leaving Home&quot;)===
&quot;Die zweite Heimat&quot; (literally &quot;The Second Heimat&quot;; English title &quot;Heimat 2&quot;) (subtitled &quot;Chronik einer Jugend — Chronicle of a Youth&quot;) followed in 1992. It is set during the socially turbulent years of the 1960s and depicts how Maria&#x27;s youngest son Hermann leaves his rural home and makes a new life for himself as a composer in Munich.

Hermann is a musical prodigy whose teenage romance in 1955 with 26-year-old soul-mate Klärchen was considered scandalous by his conservative home village. It resulted in her being expelled and coerced to never contact him again. Hermann felt crushed, vowing never to love again and to leave his village forever. He arrives in Munich at age 19 where he befriends fellow students, and meets future love interest Clarissa. Hermann joins the avant-garde culture surrounding the conservatory, which includes film students, while he also takes odd jobs. Hermann and his friends are gradually drawn to the Foxhole, a mansion headed by a wealthy art patroness said to be a &quot;collector of artists&quot;. A remaster of &quot;Die Zweite Heimat&quot; was released in 2022.
===&quot;Heimat 3&quot;===
&quot;Heimat 3&quot; (subtitled &quot;Chronik einer Zeitenwende — Chronicle of a Changing Time&quot;) premiered in 2004. It continues Hermann&#x27;s story in 1989 as he returns to Schabbach and depicts the events of the period from the fall of the Berlin Wall until 2000. The cinema version consists of six episodes running to 11 hours 29 minutes, although controversially the version broadcast on the German ARD television network in December 2004 was edited into six 90-minute episodes and it is this 20% shorter version which was released on DVD.
===&quot;Heimat-Fragmente&quot; (&quot;Heimat Fragments&quot;)===
&quot;Heimat-Fragmente&quot; (English title &quot;Heimat Fragments&quot;), subtitled &quot;Die Frauen — The Women&quot;, was released in cinemas in 2006 and focuses on the women of the Simon family at the turn of the millennium, and in the 1960s. It uses deleted scenes and outtakes from the previous films, along with newly filmed material to create a narrative that mostly focuses on Lulu looking back on her family history.

===&quot;Die andere Heimat&quot; (&quot;Home from Home&quot;)===
In April 2012, Reitz started filming a prequel to the series: &quot;Die andere Heimat&quot; (literally &quot;The other Heimat&quot;; English title &quot;Home from Home&quot;), with the subtitle &quot;Chronik einer Sehnsucht — Chronicle of a Vision&quot;. The film takes place between 1840 and 1844 and centres around two brothers, their families and love relations from the Hunsrück area and their decision whether to flee hunger and poverty by emigrating to Brazil. Principal filming was completed in August 2012. It was screened at the Venice Film Festival in September 2013. The film was awarded a score of 70 on critical aggregator website Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews.

** Eduard Simon (1897–1967), mayor of Rhaunen who was convinced early in life that there was gold in the Hunsrück streams. He always had trouble with his lungs; during treatment in Berlin, he met and later married Lucie Hardtke (1906–1978), a brothel madam who embraced life in the Hunsrück. They had a child, Horst Simon (1934–1948), who was killed at an early age, after discovering a landmine in the forest.
** Paul Simon (1898–1984), owner of Simon Electric. He married Maria Wiegand in 1922 and fathered Anton and Ernst (&quot;see Maria Wiegand below&quot;). After returning from fighting in World War I, Paul felt claustrophobic in Hunsrück society and ran away to the U.S. in 1928 to start Simon Electric in Detroit, Michigan. He returned in 1945 and visited until 1947. He left again the day of his mother&#x27;s funeral.
** Pauline Simon (1904–1975), assistant jewelry shop owner. Married watchmaker Robert Kröber (1897–1944). Both became modestly wealthy during the 1930s. Parents of Gabi (1935– ) and Robert (1937– ).

===Wiegand family===
* Alois Wiegand (1870–1965), mayor of Schabbach who married Martha Wiegand (1878–1945). Parents of Gustav, Wilfried and Maria. Alois was an abrasive wealthy man who embraced status symbols, and later became a Nazi supporter. With his SS son Wilfried he oversaw the village&#x27;s allegiance to Hitler during World War II.
** Gustav Wiegand (1897–1917), died as a World War I soldier. Not married; no children.
** Wilfried Wiegand (1915–1972), member of the SS during the war. He executed a downed British pilot under false pretenses. At a Schabbach party he revealed that Jews were being sent &quot;up the chimney&quot; and in the vein of Himmler lamented how his SS comrades suffered from this unpleasant task. He became a farmer after the war and was also a member of the Christian Democratic Union. Did not marry and had no children.
** Maria Wiegand Simon (7 August 1900 – 18 September 1982), matriarch of the family after World War II. Married Paul Simon and gave birth to Anton and Ernst.

Anton worked for a German Army propaganda unit during World War II and served on the Eastern Front. There is one scene showing him filming single executions – these are almost certainly partisans given that the time is 1943 (and widespread executions in the field had ceased on the orders of Himmler) and also the fact that the machine gun crew carrying out the executions are German Army regulars and not Einsatzgruppen. After the German defeat and subsequent imprisonment in a Russian labor camp, Anton walked home to Germany in the late 1940s. He arrived 10 May 1947, after walking five-thousand kilometres.

Just as he says, Klärchen is accepted into the Simon household and effectively treated as one of the family, eventually gaining a position with Simon Optik. A 1956 love affair with Hermann Simon, who is 11 years her junior, results in her becoming pregnant, leaving the village and having an abortion. 
* Apollonia (c.1900–?), brief love interest for Paul Simon c. 1920. Was ostracized in Schabbach for her dark complexion. Had a child by a Frenchman and moved to France, never to be seen again.

==Reception==

===Release and awards===
After premiering in Germany, &quot;Heimat&quot; was shown in Venice, London and New York festivals. It was shown in movie screens around the world in separate parts. However, it gained its worldwide exposure on television, across 26 countries. In order to shape the film into eleven episodes, Reitz devised introductory segments in which Kurt Wagner as Glasisch narrated the brief story so far, over photographs by Eduard Simon. In Germany, the broadcast received over fifteen million viewers.

&quot;Heimat&quot; earned Edgar Reitz the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1984 Venice Film Festival, while Marita Breuer won the Darstellerpreis for Best Actress at the 1985 Bavarian Film Awards. In the United Kingdom the film won a BAFTA and the London Film Critics&#x27; Circle award for Best Foreign Language Film.

&quot;Die Zweite Heimat&quot; premiered at the Venice Biennale and broadcast rights were purchased by television companies in 16 different countries. However, the German backers were disappointed that it received a smaller percentage-viewing share than the first. Reitz said the executives overlooked the fact that in 1984 only three channels existed compared to more than twenty in 1992. In the United States the film had a short theatrical run in New York at The Public Theater. It also screened at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and various Goethe-Institut locations across the country. It was not picked up for television by US cable networks.

In Italy the film was shown at a large venue in Rome, that had sold out tickets weekly. Reitz was presented with the &quot;Eurofipa d’honneur&quot; award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1994.

&quot;Die Zweite Heimat&quot; had a weekend premiere for its first five episodes in Munich, on the weekend of 17 - 18 September. An essay was written about the weekend on a Heimat fanpage. Episodes six to thirteen followed for the following eight weeks. A Blu-Ray of the remastered film was released in November 2022 

===Critical reception===
&quot;Heimat&quot; received acclaim around the world. Many were enthusiastic how it never felt like a television movie, but a cinematic experience. Many praised the themes through the film about leaving and returning and simply how we connect to the larger world from our home. Reitz received thousands of letters from ordinary people, thanking him for retrieving and unlocking their memories of the 1919–1982 period. However, critic Leonie Naughton accused the film of presenting a &quot;bourgeois history of the Third Reich, a homespun tale of innocence.&quot;

&quot;Die Zweite Heimat&quot; received a lukewarm reception in the United States. National press coverage was limited to a single review by Stephen Holden in The New York Times, who described Hermann Simon as &quot;a hotheaded romantic&quot; and the film as a &quot;alternately gripping and lyrical 13-episode serial about German life in the 1960s&quot;. Holden also declared the film to be &quot;the ultimate highbrow soap opera for couch potatoes&quot;.

British press for &quot;Die Zweite Heimat&quot; was more enthusiastic with &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; all praising it.

===Lasting impact===

&quot;Heimat&quot; was one of director Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s favourite films. It is ranked  59 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. It also finished in 6th place when BBC Two ran a 40th birthday poll celebrating the station&#x27;s greatest programmes and was 10th in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest TV Dramas&quot;.

&quot;Heimat&quot; has faced some criticism for its selective interpretation of German history, with some writers noting that there is limited treatment of the hyperinflationary spiral of the 1920s, the Great Depression, or certain aspects of Nazi history such as the Holocaust of World War II. In 1985, Timothy Garton Ash wrote in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; that:When you show the 1930s as a golden age of prosperity and excitement in the German countryside, when you are shown the Germans as victims of the war, then you inevitably find yourself asking: But what about the other side? What about Auschwitz? Where is the director&#x27;s moral judgment? To which the colour filters insistently reply: &#x27;Remember, remember, this is a film about what Germans remember. Some things they remember in full colour. Some in sepia. Others they prefer to forget. Memory is selective. Memory is partial. Memory is amoral.&#x27;&quot;Heimat&quot; &#x27;s themes of decadent American values and Western corporate greed rising up against the innocent simplicity of the Hunsrück have been seen as &quot;resurrecting a discourse that prevailed in the nineteenth century about the modernization of Germany&#x27;s society and economy ... no compromises or delicate balances are possible&quot;.

Barbara Gabriel argued that the series was part of a larger movement of national memory work in Germany, provoked in part by the American television series &quot;Holocaust&quot;. As European art in general and German art in particular underwent a resurgence in the 1960s, artists like Günter Grass and Edgar Reitz captured international attention as they grappled with issues of identity in a divided, post-Holocaust Germany.

<text>The 19th of April Movement (), or M-19, was a Colombian urban guerrilla movement active in the late 1970s and 1980s. After its demobilization in 1990 it became a political party, the M-19 Democratic Alliance (), or AD/M-19.

The M-19 traced its origins to the allegedly fraudulent presidential elections of 19 April 1970, where the left-wing populist National Popular Alliance (ANAPO) of former military dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla was defeated by the National Front, a power sharing coalition of the two main establishment parties. M-19 initially proclaimed itself the armed wing of ANAPO, though party leaders denied any association.

The ideology of the M-19 was revolutionary nationalism, but it claimed its main aim was to open up electoral democracy in Colombia. It was inspired by other South American urban guerrilla groups, such as the Tupamaros in Uruguay and the Montoneros in Argentina. At its height in the mid-1980s, the M-19 was the second largest guerrilla group in Colombia (after the FARC), with the number of active members estimated at between 1,500 and 2,000. Its actions during this period included the theft of Bolívar&#x27;s sword as well as the Palace of Justice siege.

The group demobilized in the late 1980s and transitioned to electoral politics, though many of its key leaders would be assassinated. The M-19 Democratic Alliance merged with ANAPO in 2003 to form the Independent Democratic Pole party, the predecessor of today&#x27;s Alternative Democratic Pole. Other former members joined various left-wing parties, including the Green Alliance and Humane Colombia, the latter formed by ex-member Gustavo Petro. Petro would go on to unite these parties in his &quot;Pacto Histórico&quot; coalition, which won the 2022 elections to form Colombia&#x27;s current governing coalition.

==Armed activity==

The M-19&#x27;s history may be divided into two parts: the first was a failed armed revolutionary struggle during the early to mid-1980s, while the second was a relatively constructive reincorporation into civil society and political life during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

=== Theft of Bolívar&#x27;s sword ===
Among the actions performed by the M-19, some significant events stand out. In a highly symbolic action, the M-19 stole one of the swords of Simon Bolivar from a museum in 1974, an event which was used by the group to symbolize what they called a civilian uprising against a regime perceived as unjust. M-19 promised to return the sword by 18 December 1990, the 160th anniversary of Bolivar&#x27;s death. But the organization was unable to keep its pledge and was forced to admit it was no longer in possession of the sword. However, in 1991, M-19 would eventually return the sword.

=== Kidnapping and murder of José Raquel Mercado ===
On 15 February 1976, the M-19 kidnapped the union leader Jose Raquel Mercado, who was the president of Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CTC), charged him with selling out the interests of Colombian workers to U.S. imperialism, and sentenced him to death. The group accused Mercado of taking bribes and collaborating with the CIA. The M-19 had offered to &quot;commute&quot; the labor leader&#x27;s death sentence if the government reinstated thousands of fired workers, gave public employees the right to strike and published a communique in 12 Colombian newspapers. Mercado&#x27;s body was wrapped in plastic, and propped up against a lamppost in a Bogota park.

=== Theft of arms from the north canton ===
On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1979, the group dug a tunnel into a Colombian Army weapons depot, taking over 5000 weapons. It was considered one of the first signs of the group&#x27;s true potential for armed action.

===Dominican Republic embassy siege===
The group is also recognized for other high-profile activities, such as the Dominican embassy siege. The guerrillas stormed the Dominican Republic&#x27;s embassy during a cocktail party on 27 February 1980. They took the largest recorded number of diplomats held hostage to date in Colombia, which accounted for 14 ambassadors, including the United States&#x27;. Eventually, after tense negotiations with the government of Julio César Turbay Ayala, the hostages were peacefully released and the hostage takers were allowed to leave the country for exile in Cuba. Some of them later returned and actively rejoined the M-19&#x27;s activities. Many contemporary rumors and later accounts from the participants in this event have suggested that the Colombian government might have submitted to another of the M-19 demands, by allegedly giving the group 1 to 2.5 million U.S. dollars in exchange for the release of the hostages.

=== First peace talks ===
During the government of Belisario Betancur (1982–1986), Jaime Bateman Cayón, by then top leader of the M-19, proposed a meeting in Panama with the Colombian government toward solving the conflict. But Bateman died on 28 April 1983 in an airplane accident, apparently while on the way to Panama, and the negotiations were suspended.

The negotiations culminated with the Agreements of Corinto, Cauca. A ceasefire was agreed, as well as the continuation of dialogue for the future demobilization of the guerrilla detachment. Nevertheless, sectors of the army opposed to the agreements of La Uribe and Corinto were responsible for attacks against the life of main leaders Iván Marino Ospina, Antonio Navarro Wolff, Carlos Pizarro, Marcos Chalita, etc.

===Palace of Justice siege===
The M-19 initiated the events leading to the Palace of Justice siege. In this attack, on 6 November 1985, some 300 lawyers, judges, and Supreme Court magistrates were taken hostage by 35 armed rebel commandos at the Palace of Justice, the building that houses the Supreme Court of Colombia. They demanded that president Belisario Betancur be tried by the magistrates for allegedly betraying the country&#x27;s desire for peace. When this situation became publicly known, the Colombian Army surrounded the Palace of Justice&#x27;s perimeter with soldiers and EE-9 Cascavel armored reconnaissance vehicles. Initially, the military attempted to negotiate with the hostage takers, but these efforts was ultimately unsuccessful, despite the desperate pleas of some of the more prominent hostages. 

The Betancur administration and its council found themselves in a difficult position. They were not willing to submit to the rebels&#x27; demands, as they allegedly believed that this would set a worrying precedent and considerably jeopardize the government&#x27;s position. Eventually, after tense discussions, it was decided during an emergency meeting that the military would be allowed to handle the situation and attempt to recover the Palace by force. 

During the military assault, Supreme Court President Alfonso Reyes Echandia, was able to contact a Bogota radio station via telephone, during which he begged the authorities to agree to &quot;a ceasefire and dialogue with the rebels.&quot; President Belisario Betancur refused to call off the siege. The building caught fire and ultimately more than 100 people died (including 11 of the country&#x27;s 21 Supreme Court Justices), and valuable legal records were destroyed.

The M-19 lost several of its top commanders during the event. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights said in a 2014 ruling the Colombian state was responsible for forced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial executions during the crisis. In 2015, President Juan Manuel Santos apologized for the Colombian military&#x27;s role in the deaths of civilian victims killed during its assault. 

Citing the court decision, Santos added that he also apologised for violating the right to personal safety of those who were inside the Palace of Justice.

A Special Commission of Inquiry, established by the Betancur government, released a June 1986 report which concluded that Pablo Escobar had no relation with this event, so these allegations could not be proven (though it did not rule out the possibility either). Author Ana Carrigan alleged that the act was a conspiracy of the Colombian government. Others state that the alleged Guerrilla-Cartel relation was unlikely to occur because the two organizations had several standoffs and confrontations, like the kidnapping of Nieves Ochoa, the sister of Medellin cartel founder Juan David Ochoa Vásquez, by M-19. The kidnapping led to the creation of the MAS/Muerte a Secuestradores (&quot;Death to Kidnappers&quot;) paramilitary group by the Medellin cartel. However, her theories and skepticism of Escobar and the Medellin Cartel&#x27;s involvement was greatly discredited by others such as Rex Hudson, who presented allegedly &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; linking the cartel to the plot.

Former Assistant of the Colombia Attorney General, National Deputy Comptroller, author and Professor Jose Mauricio Gaona along with Former Minister of Justice and Ambassador to the United Kingdom Carlos Medellín Becerra, the sons of two of the murdered Supreme Court magistrates, have pushed for further investigations into the presumed links between the M-19 and the Medellín Cartel drug lords. Mayor of Bogota Gustavo Petro, a former M-19 guerrilla, has denied these accusations and dismissed them as based upon the inconsistent testimonies of drug lords. Petro says that the surviving members of the M-19 do admit to their share of responsibility for the tragic events of the siege, on behalf of the entire organization, but deny any links to the drug trade.

== Demobilization and participation in politics ==

Internationally isolated, M-19 saw itself unable to continue the armed struggle: As late as 1988, an attempt was made to solicit weapons shipments from Socialist East Germany, but, following reservations from the Ministry of National Defense, the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry for State Security, the request was denied in the end. The M-19 eventually gave up its weapons, received pardons and became a political party in the late 1980s, the M-19 Democratic Alliance (&quot;Alianza Democrática M-19&quot;, or (AD/M-19)), which renounced the armed struggle. Eventually the M-19 returned Bolívar&#x27;s sword as a symbol of its demobilization and desire to change society through its participation in legal politics.

In 1990, one of its more prominent figures, presidential candidate and former guerrilla commander Carlos Pizarro Leongómez, while aboard an airline flight, was murdered by assassins, supposedly on the orders of drug cartel and paramilitary leaders (disappeared AUC commander Carlos Castaño publicly admitted his own responsibility for the murder in a 2002 book and interviews). Some of its other members were also subject to multiple threats or likewise murdered. Antonio Navarro Wolff replaced the deceased Pizarro as candidate and leader of the party, finishing third in that year&#x27;s presidential race.

Despite the continuation of smaller scale violence against it, the AD/M-19 survived through the 1990s, achieved favorable electoral results on a local level and actively participated as a high-profile political force in the forging of Colombia&#x27;s modern 1991 constitution, which replaced a conservative document dating from 1886. Antonio Navarro was one of the three co-presidents of the Constituent Assembly of Colombia, together with representatives from the Colombian Liberal Party and the Colombian Conservative Party.

Several analysts consider that the AD/M-19 reached its peak at this point in time and, while never disappearing completely from the political background, it began to gradually decline as a party on its own, although many of its ex-members have gained influence in the Independent Democratic Pole coalition.

<text>Touggourt (; or &#x27;the gate&#x27;) is a city and commune, former sultanate and capital of Touggourt District, in Touggourt Province, Algeria, built next to an oasis in the Sahara. As of the 2008 census, the commune had a population of 39,409 people, up from 32,940 in 1998, and an annual growth rate of 1.8%. Touggourt&#x27;s urban area includes the communes of Nezla, Tebesbest and Zaouia El Abidia, for a total population of 146,108.

Touggourt is notable for its date trees. It was formerly surrounded by a moat, which the French filled up. Bradt Travel Guides describe it as &quot;largely a modern town of block architecture&quot; and &quot;largely unattractive. The centre is quiet most of the day due to the heat but is more active at night when people take to the streets.&quot;

== History ==
In 1414 the Sultanate of Tuggert was founded in southern Algeria. The known Sultans (and one female ruler) were:
*Ali II 
*Mabruk (Mubarak)
*Ali III 
*Mustafa 
*Sulayman III 
*1729 Ahmad II 
*Muhammad I al-‘Akhal 
*Ahmad IV 
*Farhat 
*Ibrahim
*Abd al-Qadir I (1st time) + Ahmad V
*Khalid 
*Abd al-Qadir I (2nd time)
*Umar bin Bu-Kumetin
*1756 Muhammad II
*Umar II bin Muhammad
*Ahmad VI
*Abd al-Qadir II
*Farhat II
*1792 Ibrahim II
*1804 al-Khazan 
*1804 Muhammad III 
*1822 ‘Amar (‘Amir) II
*1830 Ibrahim III
*1831 ‘Ali IV bin al-Kabir
*1833 ‘Aisha (Aichouch) (female)
*1840 ‘Abd ar-Rahman
*1852 ‘Abd al-Qadir III
*1852 - 1854 Sulayman IV 
The Tuggurt Expedition (1552) is also a notable historical event.

In 1854 the sultanate was abolished by French colonial authorities in Algeria. 
Touggourt, as it is now spelled, became one of the initial six (1902), then four (1905) autonomous administrative districts of the &quot;&quot; (Southern Territories), which in 1957 were first joined, then reorganized into two regular French départements. Tuggert became part of Oasis (prefecture seat Ouargla).

== Geography ==
Touggourt lies on the western side of an extensive system of oases which supports palm plantations and other agriculture in an area from north to south. Other towns around the oases are Sidi Slimane and Megarine to north, and Tamacine and Balidat Ameur to the south. The system is also associated with more oases further north in El Oued Province including the towns of Djamaa and El M&#x27;Ghair. Beyond the oases, the land is arid and barren, with extensive sand dunes both to the west and east of the city.

== Climate ==
Touggourt has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), with long, extremely hot summers and short, warm winters. Average high temperatures are consistently over 40 °C (104 °F) during June, July, August and September and reach a maximum of nearly 45 °C (113 °F) in July. Average low temperatures in summer are also very high, above 26 °C (82.4 °F) and routinely above 29 °C (86 °F) in the hottest month. Average annual rainfall is around 55 mm (2,16 in) and summers are especially dry. On 30 July 2023, a maximum temperature of was registered in Touggourt.

== Transportation ==
Touggourt lies at the junction of the N3 and N16 roads, northeast of the provincial capital of Ouargla. It is connected by railway to Biskra and is served by the Sidi Madhi Airport.

The N3 highway connects to Megarine, Sidi Slimane, and Biskra to the north and Hassi Messaoud and Illizi to the south. The N16 connects to Taibet and El Oued to the east. Another road, the &quot;Route Messaad Tougourt&quot;, connects to Messaâd and Djelfa to the northwest. Local roads connect to nearby towns Megarine and Tamacine.

==Localities==
The commune is composed of nine localities:

*Quartier de Mestaoua
*Sidi Abdessalem
*Baalouche
*Chateau d&#x27;eau
*Emir Abdelkader
*La gare
*Sidi Bouaziz
*Zone Industrielle
*Nouvelle Zone d&#x27;Activité

<text>Pinus orizabensis, the Orizaba pinyon, is a pine in the pinyon pine group, endemic to central Mexico. It is considered also as a sub-species of &quot;Pinus cembroides&quot; which is classified as &quot;Pinus cembroides&quot; subsp. &quot;orizabensis&quot; D.K.Bailey. It has larger seeds than the type.

The range is localised, confined to a small area in the eastern Eje Volcánico Transversal range (Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt), in the states of Puebla and Veracruz. It occurs at high altitudes, mostly from , in a cooler, moister climate than the other pinyon pines.

==Description==
It is a small to medium-size tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 50 cm. The bark is dark brown, thick and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk. The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in mixed fascicles of three and four, slender, 3–6 cm long, and deep green to blue-green, with stomata confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces.

===Cones===
The cones are globose to ovoid, 4–7 cm long and 3–5 cm broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 16–18 months old, with only a small number of thin scales, typically 6-18 fertile scales. The cones open to 5–7 cm broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening.

The seeds are 12–15 mm long, with a thick shell, a pink endosperm, and a vestigial 2 mm wing; they are dispersed by the Mexican jay, which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a major food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees.

==History==
&quot;Pinus orizabensis&quot; is the most recent pinyon pine to be described, discovered by Dana K. Bailey in 1983 when examining an unusual pinyon cultivated at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; it was found to match wild specimens from the Pico de Orizaba. At first it was described as a subspecies of Mexican pinyon, but further research by Bailey &amp; Hawksworth and others has shown that it is better treated as a distinct species. Some botanists still include it in Mexican pinyon though, despite their occurring together in some sites without evidence of hybridisation. Orizaba pinyon shows better adaptation to rainy temperate climate like England than &quot;Pinus cembroides&quot; which grows in dryer habitats.

&quot;Pinus orizabensis&quot; is most closely allied to Johann&#x27;s pinyon and Potosi pinyon, with which it shares the leaf structure with the stomata confined to the inner faces; it differs from these in the larger cones and seeds, and from the latter in fewer needles per fascicle (3-4 vs 5). Like these two, the white-glaucous inner surfaces of the needles make it a very attractive small tree, suitable for parks and large gardens.

The edible (pine nut) seeds are collected in Mexico to a small extent.

<doc id="1245767" wikidata="Q316560" url="?curid=1245767" title="Sine qua non">
<text>A sine qua non (, ) or conditio sine qua non (plural: &quot;conditiones sine quibus non&quot;) is an indispensable and essential action, condition, or ingredient. It was originally a Latin legal term for &quot;[a condition] without which it could not be&quot;, &quot;but for...&quot;, or &quot;without which [there is] nothing.&quot; Also, &quot;&quot;sine qua non&quot; causation&quot; is the formal terminology for &quot;but-for causation.&quot;

==Origin and spread==
As a Latin term, it occurs in the work of Boethius and originated in Aristotelian expressions. In Classical Latin, the form uses the word (from the verb , , to agree upon), but in later Latin the phrase is also used with , an error in translation as means &quot;construction&quot; and not &quot;condition&quot;.

It has passed from a merely legal usage to a more general usage in many languages, including English, German, French, Italian and Spanish.

==General usage==
US President Andrew Jackson once gave a toast on the occasion of his receiving an honorary doctorate from Harvard University, responding to his listeners, &quot;&quot;E pluribus unum&quot;, my friends. &quot;Sine qua non&quot;.&quot;

In 1938, Jomo Kenyatta, the general secretary of the Kikuyu Central Association and who later became Kenya&#x27;s first prime minister, wrote that the institution of female genital mutilation was the &quot;&quot;condicio sine qua non&quot; of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion and morality&quot;. He was writing in the context of the missionaries&#x27; campaign against female genital mutilation to assert the importance of the rite of passage as an ethnic marker for the Kikuyu, the main ethnic group in Kenya.

The phrase appears in the 1967 book on Dahomey culture by Melville J. Herskovits. He wrote about the need to learn the native language: &quot;This does not mean that a knowledge of a native language is a &quot;Sine qua non&quot; in the study of all problems bearing on primitive cultures. By the use of interpreters and of well recognized and tested techniques, it is possible to obtain the information needed to discover, describe and understand the institutions of a people, and it is such technique that have been employed in this study.&quot;

The term appears in the 1958 commentary on Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians during wartime. In this case, the use of &quot;sine qua non&quot; refers to the assurance for relief aid to go to the civilian population and not to be diverted toward &quot;the benefit of the Occupying Power.&quot;

==Usage in medicine==
In medicine, the term &quot;sine qua non&quot; (in contrast with &quot;pathognomonic&quot;) is often used in regard to any sign, symptom, or finding whose absence would very likely mean absence of the target disease or condition. The test for such a sign, symptom, or finding would thereby have very high sensitivity and thus would rarely miss the condition and so a negative result should be reassuring since the disease being tested for is absent. Examples include:

*The absence of finding one of the appropriate corresponding underlying mutations excludes coeliac disease or certain types of hereditary colon cancer.
*A vaginal pH of less than 4.5 practically excludes bacterial vaginosis.
*Sine qua non was the inspiration behind a brand name of a tricyclic antidepressant manufactured in Germany: (Sinequan) doxepin.

==&quot;But-for&quot; causation in law==
In legal matters, &quot;&quot;but-for&quot;, &quot;sine qua non&quot;, &quot;causa sine qua non&quot;, or &quot;cause-in-fact&quot;&quot; causation, or &quot;condicio sine qua non&quot;, is a circumstance in which a certain act is a material cause of a certain injury or wrongdoing, without which the injury would not have occurred. It is established by the &quot;&quot;but-for&quot; test&quot;: but for the act having occurred, the injury would not have happened.

The defendant&#x27;s negligent conduct is the actual cause of the plaintiff&#x27;s injury if the harm would not have occurred to the plaintiff &quot;but for&quot; the negligent conduct of the defendant. (Perkins)

This type of causation is often contrasted with &quot;substantial-factor&quot; causation. The substantial factor test is used when there are multiple negligent tortfeasors which either (1) all caused the injury, in which case any and all of them are 100% joint and severally liable (treated as the group but suing the money) and the charged defendant would have to implead or sue the others to square the damages, or (2) only one could have actually caused the injury but they were all negligent in the same way and that one cannot be determined, in which case the burden shifts and any of them that cannot show their negligence was not the cause is 100% joint and severally liable. The purpose of this is allow the aggrieved party to get their damages, and make the negligent tortfeasors square up amongst themselves. See e.g. &quot;Hill v. Edmonds&quot; (N.Y., 1966); &quot;Anderson v. Minneapolis, St. P. &amp; S. St. M. Ry. Co.&quot; (Minn., 1920)

In &quot;Rogers v. Bromac Title Servs. LLC&quot;, the United States Fifth Circuit interpreted the language of the Jury System Improvement Act in prohibiting employers from terminating employees &quot;by reason of&quot; jury service as meaning &quot;but-for&quot; causation. That means that the employee must show that the termination of employment would not have occurred &quot;but for&quot; the jury service. That is a higher burden for the plaintiff employee than merely showing that the jury service was a motivating factor for the termination.

<text>The German Wikipedia () is the German-language edition of Wikipedia, a free and publicly editable online encyclopedia.

Founded on 16 March 2001, it is the second-oldest Wikipedia edition (after the English Wikipedia). It has  articles, making it the -largest edition of Wikipedia by number of articles, , behind the English Wikipedia and the mostly bot-generated Cebuano Wikipedia. It has the second-largest number of edits and of active users behind the English Wikipedia. On 7 November 2011, the German Wikipedia became the second edition of Wikipedia, after the English edition, to exceed 100 million page edits.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The German edition of Wikipedia was the first non-English Wikipedia subdomain, and was originally named . Its creation was announced by Jimmy Wales on 16 March 2001. One of the earliest snapshots of the home page, dated 21 March 2001 (revision #9), can be seen at the Wayback Machine site. Aside from the home page, creation of articles in the German Wikipedia started as early as April 2001, apparently with translations of Nupedia articles. After the Catalan Wikipedia, the German Wikipedia was the second non-English edition to contain articles. The earliest article still available on Wikipedia&#x27;s site is apparently Polymerase-Kettenreaktion, dated May 2001.

Andrew Lih wrote that the hacker culture in Germany and the concept solidified the German Wikipedia&#x27;s culture. The geography of Europe facilitated face-to-face meetups among German Wikipedians.

=== Growth, coverage and popularity ===

On 27 December 2009, the German Wikipedia exceeded 1,000,000 articles, becoming the first edition after the English-language Wikipedia to do so. The millionth article was Ernie Wasson. In March 2014, 88% of the edition&#x27;s articles had more than 512 bytes, 57% had more than 2 kilobytes, and the average article size was 4,298 bytes. As of August 2024, the German edition of Wikipedia has nearly 950,000 biographies and 350,000 disambiguation pages.

Compared to the English Wikipedia, the German edition tends to be more selective in its coverage, often rejecting small stubs, articles about individual fictional characters and similar materials. Instead, there is usually one article about all the characters from a specific fictional setting, usually only when the setting is considered important enough (for example, all characters from &quot;Star Wars&quot; are listed in a single article). A dedicated article about a single fictional entity generally exists only if the character in question has a very significant impact on popular culture (for example, Hercule Poirot). Andrew Lih wrote that German Wikipedia users believe that &quot;having no article at all is better than a very bad article.&quot; Therefore, growth on the German Wikipedia leveled before it did for the English Wikipedia, with accelerating growth in article count shifting to constant growth in mid-2006. The number of users signing up for accounts began to steadily decline in 2007 through 2008.

The number of volunteer authors began to stagnate in 2007 and has decreased since then. In Germany, the number of regularly active authors fell by more than a third from the peak of 9,254 at the beginning of 2008 to 5,862 at the end of 2015.

The January 2005 Google Zeitgeist announced that &quot;Wikipedia&quot; was the eighth most-searched query on . In February 2005, Wikipedia reached third place behind Firefox and Valentine&#x27;s Day. In June 2005, Wikipedia ranked first.

=== Lack of diversity, decline of authors and paid editing ===
On the 20th anniversary of Wikipedia, the German-language edition faced a number of problems. According to German media the most significant are a lack of diversity, a decline in active users and the influence of paid editing. While in 2006 there were 8,614 active authors in the German Wikipedia, in December 2018 there were only 5,262. Active Wikipedians only saw about 300 people as the &quot;hard core&quot; of the German Wikipedia who write articles. 

As the number of authors decreases, the influence of a few increases, researchers found. The scientist Taha Yasseri describes those authors as &quot;super editors&quot; who write an excessive number of Wikipedia articles and thus keep the community project alive. It is problematic when &quot;super editors&quot; dominate much-discussed articles, build up an elite circle among themselves and &quot;defend&quot; their area. 

German Wikipedia has been criticized for conflict-of-interest manipulations by who overwhelm a small number of administrators.

With the withdrawal of users and an interpretation of the rules that is not always perceived as appropriate, German Wikipedia can hardly counter the influence of lobby groups and paid editing.

 the size of the German Wikipedia database is about 6 gigabytes.

== Language and varieties of German==
Separate Wikipedias have been created for several other varieties of German, including Alemannic German (:als:), Luxembourgish (:lb:), Pennsylvania German (:pdc:), Ripuarian (including Kölsch; :ksh:), Yiddish (:yi:), Low German (:nds:) and Bavarian (:bar:). These however, have less popularity than the German Wikipedia. There are also the Dutch Low Saxon (:nds-nl:) and the Mennonite Low German Wikipedia.

== Characteristics ==

The German Wikipedia is different from the English Wikipedia in a number of aspects.
* Compared to the English Wikipedia, different criteria of encyclopedic notability are expressed through the judgments of the editors for deciding if an article about a topic should be allowed. The criteria for notability are more specific; each field has its own specific guidelines.
* There are no fair use provisions. Images and other media that are accepted on the English Wikipedia as fair use may not be suitable for the German Wikipedia. However, the threshold of originality for works of applied art is set much higher, which often allows the use of company logos and similar icons, too.
* The use of scholarly sources, in preference over journalistic and other types of sources, is more strongly encouraged. The German Verifiability (&quot;Belege&quot;) guideline classifies scholarly sources as inherently more reliable than non-academic sources; the latter&#x27;s use is – in theory at least – only permitted if there is a lack of published academic sources covering a topic.
* In September 2005, Erik Möller voiced concern that &quot;long term page protection is used excessively on the German Wikipedia&quot;: on 14 September 2005, 253 pages had been in a fully protected state (only editable by admins) for more than two weeks. This was the highest total of any of the Wikipedias, with the second-highest being 166 pages in the Japanese Wikipedia and 138 in the English Wikipedia. , the German Wikipedia still had the highest percentage of semi-protected articles (articles not editable by unregistered or recently registered users) – 0.281% – among the ten largest Wikipedias, but in terms of the fraction of fully protected articles (0.0261%) it ranked fourth, behind the Japanese, Portuguese and English Wikipedias.
* Handling of vandalism and other abuse is less structured: vandals are sometimes blocked on their first edit and without warning if their edit clearly shows lack of interest for actual encyclopaedic work. This is especially true if added text includes unlawful statements, such as Holocaust denial. Similarly, the function is rarely used to confirm usage of multiple accounts by the same person, as suspicious accounts are often blocked on sight.
* Articles on indisputably notable subjects may be deleted if they are deemed too short. While the requirements for minimal articles (called stubs) are equivalent, the German and the English Wikipedia differ greatly in the way they are put into practice.
* On 28 December 2005, it was decided to eliminate the Category &quot;stub&quot; (and the corresponding template identifying articles as ) from the German Wikipedia.
* Users do not have to create an account in order to start a new article.
* Unlike the Cebuano, Polish, Dutch, Italian, Swedish or many other Wikipedias, the German one does not contain large collections of bot-generated geographical stubs or similar articles.
* The German Wikipedia version did not have an Arbitration Committee until May 2007. Currently, German Wikipedia&#x27;s Arbitration Committee plays only a minor role in Wikipedia politics.
* Categories are singular and are not differentiated for gender. Categories are usually introduced only for a minimum of ten entries and are not always subdivided even for larger numbers of items, so that current categories often describe only one property (e.g., nationality). Other categories are subdivided, but differently from in the English Wikipedia. For example, &quot;chemists&quot; are subdivided by century, not by nationality. University professors, on the other hand, will usually be categorized according to where they teach.
* The equivalent to the English Wikipedia&#x27;s and are exzellente Artikel (&quot;excellent articles&quot;) and lesenswerte Artikel (&quot;good articles&quot;; literally: &quot;articles&quot; &quot;worth reading&quot;).
* In 2005, there was a discussion and poll resulting in the decision to phase out the use of local image uploads and to exclusively use Wikimedia Commons for images and other media in the future. The attempt to implement this lasted for about a year and the German &quot;Upload file&quot; page displayed a large pointer to Commons in this time, but since December 2006, there is again a local image upload page without any pointer to Wikimedia Commons. This was prompted by the deletion of images on Commons that are acceptable according to German Wikipedia policies.
* Starting in December 2004, German Wikipedians pioneered Persondata (&quot;Personendaten&quot;), a special format for meta data about persons (name, birth date and place, etc.), introduced in the English Wikipedia in December 2005. In the beginning, the main aim of this system was to aid the search features of the DVD edition of the German Wikipedia (see below). During its introduction in January 2005, &quot;Personendaten&quot; were added to some 30,000 biographical articles on the live Wikipedia, partly aided by a somewhat automatic tool. The template is currently deprecated and is no longer on any pages.
* Like &quot;The Signpost&quot; in the English Wikipedia, the German Wikipedia also has its own internal newspaper, the &quot;Kurier&quot;. However, the &quot;Kurier&quot; is laid out on a single page and is not issued weekly but is continually updated by interested Wikipedians, with older articles being archived.
* In German &quot;Wikipedia&quot; is pronounced .

=== Reviewed versions ===

At Wikimania 2006, Jimmy Wales announced that the German Wikipedia would institute a system of &quot;stable article versions&quot;, also known as sighting, on a trial basis. The system went live in May 2008. Certain users, so-called &quot;active sighters&quot;, are now able to mark article versions as &quot;reviewed&quot;, indicating that the text contains no obvious vandalism. A note in the top right corner of the screen indicates to the reader whether or not the present version of an article has already been reviewed, and provides access to the most recent reviewed version or a more current, unreviewed version as needed.

The German Wikipedia has two levels of &quot;sighting&quot; status which act like the English Wikipedia&#x27;s : &quot;Passive sighter&quot; and &quot;Active sighter&quot;. The former is able to make changes to articles go live immediately if the last edit is marked as sighted, while only the latter allows manually reviewing pending changes.

== Miscellanea ==

===Events ===
The first real-life meetup of Wikipedians took place in October 2003 in Munich. As a result of this meeting, regularly striking round tables (called &quot;Wikipedia-Stammtisch&quot;) established themselves at various places in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The round tables have become an important aspect of collegial exchange within the German-speaking community.

Each spring and autumn, the German Wikipedia organizes a writing contest, where a community-elected jury rates nominated articles. Prizes are sponsored by individual community members and companies. The first contest was held in October 2004 – the article Kloster Lehnin (Lehnin Abbey) was selected as the winner from 44 nominated articles. The second contest, held in March 2005, saw 52 contributions, and the third, in September 2005, 70. A trial to extend the contest to an international level met with limited success, with only the Dutch, English and Japanese Wikipedias participating.

For the March 2006 writing contest, the 150 nominated articles were split into three sections: history and society (56 nominations), arts and humanities (36), and science (46). The article on the Brown Bear (German: &quot;Braunbär&quot;) won, and of the nominated 27 articles reached featured status a few weeks after the contest. In March 2007, the sixth contest was held, with the winner being the article on the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (German: &quot;Haager Konvention zum Schutz von Kulturgut bei bewaffneten Konflikten&quot;).

German Wikipedians organized the first international Wikipedia conference, Wikimania 2005, in August 2005 in Frankfurt. Some 300 people from over 50 countries attended the three-day conference.

From 17 March to 15 April 2006, the Göttingen State and University Library held a special exhibition documenting the first five years of Wikipedia.

In 2006, the University of Göttingen hosted the first Wikipedia Academy. The academy was intended to familiarize the academic world with Wikimedia projects. In 2007, the second such meeting took place, organized in conjunction with the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur (&quot;Academy of Science and Literature&quot;) in Mainz as part of the German Jahr der Geisteswissenschaften (&quot;Year of the Humanities&quot;), which was decreed by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research. A third meeting was organized on 20–21 June 2008 in Berlin, during the Jahr der Mathematik (&quot;Year of Mathematics&quot;); the meeting was hosted by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities.

German Wikipedians have since organised the Foto-Workshop meeting of photographers, with participants from 10 countries.

=== Contacts with &quot;Brockhaus&quot; ===

In April 2004, a complete list of article titles from the leading German encyclopedia &quot;Brockhaus&quot; was uploaded to the German Wikipedia, in an apparent attempt to facilitate the creation of still missing articles. A representative of &quot;Brockhaus&quot; asked for and obtained the deletion of what was believed to be a copyright infringement. As a result of the developing email conversation, a group of five Wikipedians visited the &quot;new media&quot; group of &quot;Brockhaus&quot; in Mannheim on 1 July 2004. The friendly meeting saw a lively discussion of the differing approaches to writing an encyclopedia; it became clear that &quot;Brockhaus&quot; had closely observed Wikipedia for quite some time.

=== Subsidies from the German government ===

In June 2007, a project on renewable resources (WikiProjekt Nachwachsende Rohstoffe) was initiated, the goal being to write and improve articles on the topic. The project was run for three years and was subsidized by the German Ministry of Agriculture with approximately €80,000 a year. It was organised and managed by the private company &quot;nova-Institut GmbH&quot;. Nova GmbH and Wikimedia Deutschland e. V. funded the project with approximately €60,000 a year in addition, so the budget was approximately €420,000 in total.

These funds were mainly used to organise the project and also to search for experts in the field who have not contributed to Wikipedia yet. Nova may also have paid expense allowances to authors.

=== Most-disputed articles ===

According to a 2013 Oxford University study, the article on Croatia was the most disputed article on the German Wikipedia. The top ten most disputed articles then also included Adolf Hitler, Scientology, and Rudolf Steiner. One of the largest disputes about simple sentences, however, concerned the Donauturm in Vienna. Whilst the observation tower shares some architectural aspects with the Fernsehturm Stuttgart, it was never planned for TV broadcasting purposes. The German Wikipedia had a rather lengthy (about 600,000 characters) discussion about the suitable title and categories, inasmuch as numerous Austrian authors denied the description of Donauturm as a &quot;TV tower&quot;. The &quot;Spiegel&quot; coverage of the issue cited a participant with &quot;On good days, Wikipedia is better than any TV soap&quot;.

== Reviews and research ==
In September 2004, the computer magazine &quot;c&#x27;t&quot; compared the German Wikipedia with the Brockhaus Multimedia encyclopedia and the German edition of Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Encarta&quot;. On a scale from 0 to 5, Wikipedia ranked first with a score of 3.4. A few weeks later, the weekly newspaper also compared content from Wikipedia with other reference works and found that Wikipedia only has to &quot;share its lead position in the field of natural science.&quot; The DVD version of Spring 2005 received a rather negative review by Björn Hoffmann – product manager working for the Bibliographisches Institut &amp; F.A. Brockhaus in July 2005.

In November 2005 the OpenUsability project in cooperation with the Berlin-based Relevantive AG conducted a usability test of the German Wikipedia. The study focused on finding information and included a set of recommendations to change the MediaWiki interface. In February 2006, the open usability project led a second test which focused on the experience of new editors. The reports were published in English.

A second test by &quot;c&#x27;t&quot; in February 2007 used 150 search terms, of which 56 were closely evaluated, to compare four digital encyclopedias: Bertelsmann Enzyklopädie 2007, Brockhaus Multimedial premium 2007, Encarta 2007 Enzyklopädie and Wikipedia. With respect to concerns about the reliability of Wikipedia, it concluded: &quot;We did not find more errors in the texts of the free encyclopedia than in those of its commercial competitors&quot;.

In December 2007, German magazine &quot;Stern&quot; published the results of a comparison between the German Wikipedia and the online version of the 15-volume edition of &quot;Brockhaus Enzyklopädie&quot;. The test was commissioned to a research institute (Cologne-based WIND GmbH), whose analysts assessed 50 articles from each encyclopedia (covering politics, business, sports, science, culture, entertainment, geography, medicine, history and religion) on four criteria (accuracy, completeness, timeliness and clarity), and judged Wikipedia articles to be more accurate on average (1.6 on a scale from 1 to 6, versus 2.3 for &quot;Brockhaus&quot; with lower = better). Wikipedia&#x27;s coverage was also found to be more complete and up to date; however, &quot;Brockhaus&quot; was judged to be more clearly written, while several Wikipedia articles were criticized as being too complicated for non-experts, and many as too lengthy.

In 2015, a group of young historians reviewed the Massaker von Katyn article, which was deemed &quot;excellent&quot; by Wikipedia authors. They pointed out more than 130 factual errors and remarked that the article completely ignores the new scientific literature.

== Off-line publication ==
=== CD November 2004 ===
In November 2004, Directmedia Publishing GmbH started distributing a CD-ROM containing a German Wikipedia snapshot. Some 40,000 CDs were sent to registered customers of directmedia. The price was 3 euros per CD.

The display and search software used for the project, &quot;Digibib&quot;, had been developed by Directmedia Publishing for earlier publications; it ran on Windows and Mac OS X (and later also on Linux). The Wikipedia articles had to be converted to the XML format used by &quot;Digibib&quot;.

To produce the CD, a dump of the live Wikipedia had been copied to a separate server, where a team of 70 Wikipedians vetted the material, deleting nonsense articles and obvious copyright violations. Questionable articles were added to a special list, to be reviewed later. The final CD contained 132,000 articles and 1,200 images.

The ISO image was distributed for free via eMule and BitTorrent. In December, the CHIP computer magazine placed the Wikipedia data on the DVD that it distributes with every issue. The Wikipedia materials are published under GFDL while the &quot;Digibib&quot; software may only be copied for non-commercial use, except the Linux version which is GPLed.

=== CD/DVD April 2005 ===
A new release of Wikipedia content was published by Directmedia on 6 April 2005. This package consisted of a 2.7 GB DVD and a separate bootable CDROM (running a version of Linux with Firefox). The CDROM did not contain all the data, but was included to accommodate users without DVD-drives. The DVD used Directmedia&#x27;s &quot;Digibib&quot; software and article format; everything could be installed to a hard drive. In addition, the DVD contained an HTML tree, as well as Wikipedia articles formatted for use with PDAs (specifically, the Mobipocket and TomeRaider formats).

The production of the DVD motivated the &quot;Personendaten&quot; project (see above).

The vetting process was similar to the one for the CD described above and took place on a separate MediaWiki server. The process took about a week and involved 33 Wikipedians, communicating on IRC. To prevent duplication of work, editors would protect every article that they had reviewed; links to protected articles were shown in green. Lists of potential spammed or vandalized articles had been produced ahead of time with SQL queries. Unacceptable articles were simply deleted on the spot. While the XML articles for the earlier CD version had been produced from HTML, this time a script was used to convert Wiki markup directly to the &quot;Digibib&quot; format. The final DVD contained about 205,000 articles, with every article linking to a list of contributors.

Directmedia sold 30,000 DVDs, at €9.90 each. This price included 16% taxes and a one-euro donation to &quot;Wikimedia Deutschland&quot;; production costs were about €2.
The DVD image can also be downloaded for free.

Following the successful launch of the DVD, Directmedia donated high-resolution pictures of 10,000 public domain paintings to Wikimedia Commons (see ).

=== DVD/book December 2005 ===
The next edition of Wikipedia content was issued in December 2005 by the publisher Zenodot Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, a sister company of Directmedia. A 139-page book explaining Wikipedia, its history and policies was accompanied by a 7.5 GB DVD containing 300,000 articles and 100,000 images. The book with DVD is sold for €9.90; both are also available for free download.

The vetting process for this version was different and did not involve human intervention. A &quot;white list&quot; of trusted Wikipedians was assembled, the last 10 days of every article&#x27;s history were examined, and the last version edited by a white-listed Wikipedian was chosen for the DVD. If no such version existed, the last version older than 10 days was used. Articles nominated for cleanup or deletion were not used.

=== DVD December 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 ===

The December 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 edition can be downloaded from .

=== Books ===

==== Wikipress series ====

The December 2005 book about Wikipedia was the first in a series titled &quot;Wikipress&quot;. These books, published by Zenodot, consisted of a collection of Wikipedia articles about a common topic, selected and edited by so-called &quot;Wikipeditors&quot; who may receive compensation from Directmedia. The books were assembled on a separate server from those used for the regular German Wikipedia pages. Every &quot;Wikipress&quot; book was accompanied by an &quot;edit card&quot;, a post card that readers could send in to edit the book&#x27;s contents. &quot;Wikipress&quot; books about the Nobel Peace Prize, bicycles, Antarctica, the Solar System, and Hip hop, amongst others, were released, and other books on topics as diverse as Whales, Conspiracy theories, Manga, Astrophysics, and the Red Cross were in the works. Due to lack of interest, the project was ended after a few books.

==== 100 volume Wikipedia ====

The publisher Zenodot announced in January 2006 that they intend to publish the complete German Wikipedia in print, 100 volumes with 800 pages each, starting with the letter A in October 2006, followed by two volumes each month thereafter, to end with Z in 2010. The project, code named WP 1.0, was to be supported by 25 editors employed by Zenodot as well as a scientific advisory board. Changes made to articles before publication would also be available for incorporation into the online Wikipedia.

In March 2006, Zenodot organized a &quot;community day&quot; to meet with Wikipedians and discuss the project. Groups of Wikipedians had already begun to polish articles with titles Aa-Af in selected topics. In late March it was announced that the project was put on hold and no books would be published in 2006; the reason given was that community support was lacking.

====Bertelsmann====
On 22 April 2008, the publisher Bertelsmann announced that it planned to publish a one-volume encyclopedia in September using content from the German-language Wikipedia. The volume was planned to include abbreviated entries for the 50,000 most commonly used search terms of the prior two years. The book is priced at 19.95 euros, with one euro from every sale going to the German chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation. It was released on 15 September 2008 in hardcover, containing 992 pages and many illustrations.

== Legal issues and controversies ==
=== Deletions ===

The German Wikipedia has been criticized for the deletion of articles because they seem &quot;irrelevant&quot; to those who deleted them, even though they seem expedient, meaningful, well written and extensive enough to other people. These discussions have received press coverage in computer magazines as well as in mainstream media.

=== Unauthorized uses ===
While everyone is free to use Wikipedia content, there are certain conditions, such as attribution, a copy of the license text and no non-free derivative works (see Creative Commons licenses and GNU Free Documentation License for details).

In March 2005, the German news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published an article on the Rwandan genocide in its online edition; it was a copy of Wikipedia&#x27;s article. The article was taken down soon after and replaced with an apology.

In April 2005, the encyclopedia &quot;Brockhaus&quot; published an article about the new pope Josef Ratzinger in its online edition. Because of its close similarity to Wikipedia&#x27;s article, suspicion arose right away that the &quot;Brockhaus&quot; article might have been plagiarism. The article was removed soon after but &quot;Brockhaus&quot; did not apologize or admit guilt (see &quot;The Signpost&quot; ).

=== Large-scale copyright infringement (2003–2005) ===

In mid-November 2005, it was discovered that an anonymous user had entered hundreds of articles from older encyclopedias that had been published from the 1960s to the 1980s in East Germany. The articles were mainly on topics in philosophy and related areas. The user had started in December 2003.

A press release was issued and numerous editors started to remove the copyright protected materials. This was made difficult by the fact that the old encyclopedias were not online and not easily available from many West German libraries, and that the user had used numerous different IP addresses. The Directmedia DVD had to be updated.

=== Bertrand Meyer article hoax ===

On 28 December 2005, the article about computer scientist Bertrand Meyer (creator of the Eiffel programming language) was edited by an anonymous user, falsely reporting that Meyer had died four days earlier. The hoax was reported five days later by the Heise News Ticker and the article was immediately corrected. Major news media in Germany and Switzerland picked up on the story. Meyer himself went on to publish a positive evaluation of Wikipedia, concluding, &quot;The system succumbed to one of its potential flaws, and quickly healed itself. This doesn&#x27;t affect the big picture. Just like those about me, rumors about Wikipedia&#x27;s downfall have been grossly exaggerated.&quot;

=== Naming Tron ===

In 2006, Wikimedia Deutschland, the German chapter of the US Wikimedia Foundation, was drawn into a legal dispute between the parents of the deceased German computer hacker Boris &quot;Tron&quot; Floricic and the Foundation. The parents did not wish Floricic&#x27;s real name to be publicly mentioned, and in December 2005 they obtained a preliminary injunction in a Berlin court against the American Wikimedia Foundation, requiring removal of Floricic&#x27;s name from Wikipedia. The name was not removed. On 19 January 2006 they obtained a second injunction, this time against Wikimedia Deutschland, prohibiting the address codice_1 (which is under control of Wikimedia Deutschland) to redirect to the German Wikipedia at codice_2 (which is controlled by the Wikimedia Foundation and hosts the actual encyclopedia) as long as Wikipedia mentioned Floricic&#x27;s name. Wikimedia Deutschland complied and replaced the redirect with a note explaining the situation, but without mentioning the Tron case specifically. The German Wikipedia remained accessible through codice_2 during this time. One day later, Wikimedia Deutschland achieved a suspension of the injunction, and linked from the note at codice_1 to the German Wikipedia. On 9 February, the court invalidated the injunction, ruling that neither the rights of the deceased nor the rights of the parents were affected by publishing the name; this ruling was upheld on appeal, decided 12 May.

=== Lutz Heilmann controversy ===

In November 2008, Lutz Heilmann, a member of the German parliament, obtained a preliminary injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland e. V., forbidding the forwarding of codice_1 to codice_2. According to Focus Online, Heilmann objected to claims that he had not completed his university degree, and that he had participated in a business venture involving pornography. The report also suggests that the Wikipedia article had been repeatedly altered in line with his claims by an anonymous user operating within the Bundestag building, but Heilmann denied having been involved in an edit war. Wikimedia Germany displayed a page explaining the situation. Heilmann announced on 16 November that he would drop the legal proceedings against Wikimedia Deutschland, regretting that many uninvolved users of the encyclopedia had been affected.

===Superprotect and Media Viewer controversy===
In 2014, the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) &quot;&quot;superprotected&quot; a JavaScript file on German Wikipedia so that no German editors, not even administrators, were allowed to edit it. This was in response towards controversy surrounding the new (see &quot;The Signpost&quot; ). Many German editors left over this dispute. An open letter to the WMF was signed by almost 1,000 Wikimedians. In April 2015 Erik Möller left the WMF; the &quot;superprotect&quot;&quot; feature was disabled in November.

===Reiss Engelhorn Museum===
In 2015, the Reiss Engelhorn Museum sued the WMF and its German chapter Wikimedia Deutschland for alleged copyright violations of 17 public domain pictures.

== Parodies and forks ==

In the millennium years, parodies of the German Wikipedia include &quot;Kamelopedia&quot;, created in April 2004, Stupidedia, created in December 2004, and the German version of Uncyclopedia, created in August 2005.

Ulrich Fuchs, a longtime contributor to the German Wikipedia, produced a fork known as &quot;Wikiweise&quot; in April 2005. It was ad-supported, used its own software (but a similar wiki markup), admitted only registered editors, and prominently displayed the real names of every article&#x27;s major contributors. It has since gone offline.

==Copyright law==

On 21 March 2019, the German Wikipedia went offline to inform users about the European Union&#x27;s copyright law reformation, the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, which had been voted on in the European Parliament on 27 March 2019. Opponents of the reformation were concerned about the restriction of fundamental rights including a free press and the freedom of speech and arts. The blackouts&#x27; purpose was to both inform and protest this controversial decision.

<doc id="1245773" wikidata="Q64392" url="?curid=1245773" title="Edgar Reitz">
<text>Edgar Reitz (born 1 November 1932) is a German filmmaker and Professor of Film at the Staatliche Hochschule für Gestaltung (State University of Design) in Karlsruhe. He is best-known for his internationally acclaimed &quot;Heimat&quot; film series (1984-2013).

== Early life and education ==
Reitz was born in Morbach, Hunsrück. His father Robert was a watchmaker and his business in Morbach was later taken over by Reitz&#x27;s brother Guido. Reitz&#x27;s interest in acting and producing plays began in his school years in Simmern, where he was encouraged by his German teacher Karl Windhäuser. After taking his Abitur, he studied German studies, journalism, art history and theatre studies in Munich from 1952. His first experiences in film-making however were not theoretical; he worked as a camera, editing, and production assistant from 1953.

His interests in the advancement of new developments in film went as far as he cooperated with Wolfgang Georgsdorf and his &quot;Osmodrama&quot; in 2016 which led to a complete scent synchronisation of his movie “home from home” which premiered as an allegedly well functioned cinema on 17 July 2016.

== Institut für Filmgestaltung ==
In 1963 along with Alexander Kluge he founded the &quot;Institut für Filmgestaltung&quot; (Institute for Film Design) which was affiliated to the Ulm School of Design, where he taught film directing and camera theory until the School of Design closed in 1968. As part of the group around Kluge, Reitz was a participant in the Oberhausen Manifesto which was announced at the Oberhausen Short Film Festival of 1962. With this manifesto young German filmmakers demanded nothing less than a new form of cinema: &quot;Der alte Film ist tot. Wir glauben an den neuen.&quot; (&quot;The old film is dead. We believe in the new film&quot;). The manifesto is associated with the motto &quot;Papas Kino ist tot&quot; (&quot;Papa&#x27;s cinema is dead&quot;). Subsequently, the concept of the auteur gained in popularity in Germany, and Reitz played a significant role in shaping this concept in the following years.

== Awards ==
Reitz received one of his first awards for his film &quot;Mahlzeiten&quot; which was awarded the prize for best debut work at the Venice Film Festival in 1967. In 1971 he founded Edgar Reitz Filmproduktion (ERF) in Munich. He now began to collaborate on films with his former academic colleague Alexander Kluge amongst them the 1974 fictitious documentary &quot;In Gefahr und größter Not bringt der Mittelweg den Tod&quot;. The lavish production costs of the 1979 film &quot;The Tailor of Ulm&quot;, which portrays the downfall of the aviation pioneer Albrecht Berblinger, caused Reitz&#x27;s own financial circumstances to suffer. The film was entered into the 11th Moscow International Film Festival. It was during this crisis that the idea for a film project about his homeland, the Hunsrück, first came to Reitz. What began as an attempt at self-discovery, ultimately broadened out into the &quot;Heimat&quot; trilogy (from 1984), which met with critical acclaim, an enthusiastic international audience, and numerous prizes. With this epic and monumental production, Reitz achieved a quite new perspective, an approach, both poetical and realistic, to the past of Germany as it might have played out in the provinces.

In 2004 Reitz was awarded the Carl Zuckmayer Medal by the state of Rhineland-Palatinate for his life&#x27;s work. 
In the same year, he received the Master of Cinema Award of the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg.
Reitz is married to the singer and actress Salome Kammer (who appeared in Heimats 2 and 3) and lives in Munich.

He is an atheist.

<doc id="1245781" wikidata="Q6679471" url="?curid=1245781" title="Lord Justice Clerk">
<text>The Lord Justice Clerk is the second most senior judge in Scotland, after the Lord President of the Court of Session. The current Lord Justice Clerk is Lord Beckett, who was appointed to the position on 4 February 2025, succeeding Lady Dorrian who had been the first female to hold the office.

==History==

In modern times, most judges appointed as Lord Justice Clerk later become Lord President of the Court of Session.

Originally &quot;clericus justiciarie&quot; or Clerk to the Court of Justiciary, the counterpart in the criminal courts of the Lord Clerk Register, the status of the office increased over time and the Justice-Clerk came to claim a seat on the Bench by practice and custom. This was recognised by the Privy Council of Scotland in 1663 and the Lord Justice Clerk became the effective head of the reformed High Court of Justiciary in 1672 when the court was reconstituted. The Lord Justice Clerk now rarely presides at criminal trials in the High Court, with most of their time being spent dealing with civil and criminal appeals.

The Lord Justice Clerk has the title in both the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary and, as &quot;President of the Second Division of the Inner House&quot;, is in charge of the Second Division of Judges of the Inner House of the Court of Session. The office is one of the Great Officers of State of Scotland.

<text>The Carnet de Passages en Douane is a customs document that identifies a traveller&#x27;s motor vehicle or other valuable equipment or baggage. It is required in order to take a motor vehicle into a significant number of countries around the world. The CPD system is managed by the Federation Internationale de l&#x27;automobile, duly mandated by the World customs organization and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.

==Usage==
The &quot;carnet&quot; allows travellers to temporarily import their vehicles, or other items of value such as broadcasting equipment, without having to leave a cash deposit at the border. It is, in essence, an international guarantee for payment of customs duties and taxes to a government should the vehicle or item not be re-exported from that country. Persons who temporarily import their vehicles or items into countries where the &quot;Carnet&quot; is required must agree to obey the laws and regulations of that country and particularly the conditions of temporary importation.

The &quot;Carnet&quot; contains relevant information about the items or vehicle – make, model, colour, engine capacity, seating capacity, registration number, owner and value.

In order to obtain a &quot;carnet&quot;, the owner of the items is required to provide a security based on the countries traveled to, age and market value of the items. Generally, four types of security are acceptable from motoring organisations:

* Cash bond
* Banker&#x27;s letter of indemnity
* Insurance policy
* Loss Prevention Security – US and Canada only

The l&#x27;Alliance Internationale de Tourisme / Federation Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (AIT/FIA) is the International Organizational body that advocates and maintains oversight of CPDs. The AIT/FIA is responsible for the inventory and distribution of CPDs within its CPD network of issuing and guaranteeing organizations. Recently, in May 2021, the AIT/FIA introduced the e-CPD Distribution system for the electronic issuance and authentication of CPDs. This was done to reflect the need for digitalization of official documents, these documents were originally mandated for cross-border mobility use by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).

As the new eCPD Distribution mechanism was implemented, a new rebranding effort was done as well for CPDs.

<text>Leontine Sagan (born Leontine Schlesinger; 13 February 1889 – 20 May 1974) was a theatre director and actress of Jewish descent, whose life and career took her from the Austro-Hungarian Empire to South Africa, Britain and the United States. She is, however, best known for directing a film, &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; (1931), which has been celebrated for its scathing indictment of Prussian military-style schooling, as well as its sensitive portrayal of same-sex intimacy between a teacher and a student at a girls&#x27; school, in the waning years of Germany&#x27;s Weimar Republic,

Sagan was born in Budapest but grew up in South Africa. After returning to Vienna to attend Max Reinhardt&#x27;s Theatre School in Vienna, she acted on Austrian provincial stages, and moved on to major roles in Dresden, Frankfurt and Berlin, where she also directed theatre, first in Germany and, after she had to flee Hitler, in Britain, South Africa, and Australia. She co-founded the National Theatre Organisation of South Africa in 1947, and died in Pretoria, South Africa in 1974, at the age of 85.

==Personal life==
Born in Budapest in 1889, Sagan spent her early childhood in Vienna at a time when these cities were the twin centers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Her father Isidore Schlesinger was largely absent, as he travelled to seek fortune in the South African diamond fields. Leontine and her siblings were raised by a mother who worked, a rarity among educated Europeans at that time, and she credits her mother with inspiring her likewise to seek a career. In 1899, as a child, she and her family moved to South Africa to join her father, just before the Second Boer War, when they settled in Doornfontein, at the time a fashionable district in Johannesburg. She was educated in the German School and later worked for the Austrian consulate in Johannesburg.

After returning to Vienna to study with the famous director Max Reinhardt, Leontine adopted the stage name Sagan and acted on stage first in Austrian provincial theatres and then in the 1910s and 1920s in Vienna, Frankfurt and Berlin. In 1916, she married Austrian art publisher and writer Dr. Victor Fleischer. Fleeing Germany after Hitler came to power in 1933, the pair moved to Britain, and later, in 1939, to South Africa, where they spent the years of World War II (1939–1945). After the war, Sagan directed theatre abroad in Britain and Australia, but remained domiciled in South Africa, where she founded the National Theatre Organisation and also taught theatre practice to black as well as white students.

Despite her long marriage to Fleischer, who died in South Africa in 1950, Sagan expressed interest in lesbian themes and characters throughout her career as an actor and director, before and after making &quot;Mädchen in Uniform.&quot; This film and Sagan&#x27;s choice to play the role of the teacher in English versions of the original stage play, variously titled &quot;Girls in Uniform&quot; and &quot;Children in Uniform&quot;, in Britain and South Africa in the 1930s, as well as her taste for masculine dress as seen in the photographs illustrating her autobiography &quot;Lights and Shadows&quot;, suggests at least a commitment to representing lesbian lives and loves, if not also personal attachments to women.

==Career==
Supported by her mother and savings from working in the Austrian consulate in Johannesburg, Leontine moved to Vienna in 1911 to train with Max Reinhardt, who was already known for elaborate and imaginative sets and direction of intimate drama and mass spectacles, as well as his theatre school. After acting in small roles in provincial Austrian theatres, Sagan moved to Germany, where she played Abel in &quot;Comrades&quot; by August Strindberg in the Munich Kammerspiele This role in a play by a controversial modern playwright led to an engagement at the Albert Theatre in Dresden, where Sagan played Nasya in Maxim Gorky&#x27;s The Lower Depths in 1913, and at the avant-garde Neues Theater in Frankfurt am Main, during World War I, where Sagan originated roles in expressionist plays by Walter Hasenclever and Georg Kaiser. After the war, she played major parts at the Frankfurter Schauspielhaus, in classical German plays by Goethe and Schiller, as well as the lead in a historical drama on Catherine the Great. She appeared in films such as &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; (1926), &quot;The Great Leap&quot; (1927), and &quot;The White Ecstasy&quot; (1930). At the Schauspielhaus she also turned to directing, including Strindberg&#x27;s Ghost Sonata, and G.B. Shaw&#x27;s Caeser and Cleopatra. as well as plays on topical Jewish themes such as anti-Jewish pogroms in &quot;Die Jagd Gottes&quot; (Hunted by God), by the Rabbi Emil Bernhardt Cohn, which proved controversial. Sagan&#x27;s decision to play the lesbian Countess Geschwitz in Frank Wedekind&#x27;s play &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; in 1919 (but not in the later film version of &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; [1929]), early in her career at the Schauspielhaus, reflected not only her interest in lesbian subjects, but also the relative tolerance in the Weimar Republic of lives and institutions which today would be identified as LGBTQ+, including the Institute for Sexology (1919–1933) as well as informal groups.

Although best known for her film &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot;, Sagan came to film directing indirectly. In 1931, she directed &quot;Gestern und Heute [Yesterday and Today]&quot;, a play about an intimate relationship between a teacher and a student at a girls school, by the avowed lesbian Christa Winsloe. On Winsloe&#x27;s recommendation, the feminist Hertha Thiele played the role of the student and caught the attention of Carl Fröhlich, head of the German Film Chamber. Although Fröhlich maintained overall control as artistic supervisor and changed the title to &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot;, allegedly to attract more male viewers, Sagan cast and directed the actors, including Thiele and, in the role of the teacher, Dorothea Wieck. Sagan&#x27;s direction of the all-female cast was ground-breaking not only for its portrayal of lesbian and pedagogical and for its critique of Prussian militarism, but also for the production&#x27;s co-operative and profit-sharing financial arrangements. The film was a national and international hit, despite some censorious responses in the U.S. and Britain. After the war, a more sentimental remake , also titled &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot;, starring Romy Schneider, appeared in 1958, but from the 1970s, renewed interest in lesbian lives and culture at women&#x27;s film festivals brought viewers back to the 1931 original.

After Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, Sagan moved to England. While her husband Victor Fleischer continued until 1938 to manage his publishing house in Vienna, Sagan directed stage plays, in 1933 first a stage version of &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; called &quot;Girls in Uniform&quot; in London, and then in South Africa with the perhaps less controversial title &quot;Children in Uniform.&quot; Her reputation as a director of young people led to work with the Oxford University Dramatic Society, with whom she directed male students and professional actresses in plays by Shakespeare. Her observations of student rivalries at Oxford inspired the script for her second film &quot;Men of Tomorrow&quot; (1934), which Sagan directed for London Film Productions, but this film has since vanished. It was on the strength of Mädchen in Uniform that Sagan was invited to Hollywood by MGM studios, where she stayed for six months in 1936, describing the period as a &quot;joyride&quot;. While writing treatments, she renewed contact with former colleagues who had found work in Hollywood such as screenwriter Salka Viertel, whom Sagan had known as Salome Sara Steuermann when they were both acting in Austria. Although Sagan wrote several treatments, among them one for a fictional film on the South African imperialist Cecil John Rhodes, she had no success in persuading MGM, possibly because Salka&#x27;s husband, the director Berthold Viertel, had already directed a Rhodes biopic for Gaumont in Britain. Sagan&#x27;s treatments based on historical women, such as Florence Nightingale, were likewise unsuccessful.

Instead, Sagan returned to acclaim in the London theatre; she was the first woman to produce plays at London&#x27;s Drury Lane in the West End, where she directed Ivor Novello&#x27;s hit musicals &quot;Glamorous Night&quot; (1935), &quot;Careless Rapture&quot; (1936), &quot;Crest of the Wave&quot; (1937), &quot;The Dancing Years&quot; (1939) and &quot;Arc de Triomphe&quot; (1943). Novello&#x27;s popularity and Sagan&#x27;s directing flair have been credited with saving Drury Lane from potential closure in the 1930s. In 1939 with the outbreak of World War II, Sagan and Fleischer moved to South Africa, where she directed mostly amateur actors but also taught black students at the Hofmeyr School fo Social Work, including later famous people such as the creator of the township musical Gibson Kente. After the war, she returned to directing Novello in London and to take his and other musicals on tour to Australia. Between tours, she was also able to develop theatre in South Africa by co-founding with Andre Huguenet the National Theatre Organisation which toured the country from its base in Pretoria. In February 1948 she directed the NTO&#x27;s first English production &quot;Dear Brutus&quot; by J.M. Barrie, followed by J.B Priestley&#x27;s &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot;.

==Filmography==
&quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; (1931)
featured an all-female cast and was the first film in Germany to be produced cooperatively (both the crew and cast obtained shares rather than a salary). It is based on the play originally titled &quot;Ritter Nerestan&quot; by Christa Winsloe. The film, like the play which Sagan directed as &quot;Gestern und Heute&quot; in 1931, centers on a girls&#x27; boarding school, which was realistically depicted and shot on location at a school, albeit at one for boys. In the film, the school is ruled by a strict Prussian headmistress but, where Winsloe&#x27;s play has the student who has fallen in love with her teacher commit suicide by throwing herself down the stairwell, Sagan revised the plot. In &quot;Mädchen in Uniform,&quot; thesolidarity and intervention from fellow students saves Manuela&#x27;s life; this revised story critique the Prussian education system, in favor of the more liberal systems of the Weimar Republic. But it is as a lesbian classic and more broadly as a feminist film, that &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; has been praised since the 1970s.

The elements that make &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; a lesbian classic are not the titillating images that might be implied by the title, which was in any case chosen by producer Fröhlich—girls holding hands, dressing and undressing, and so on—but rather Sagan&#x27;s sensitive and sophisticated direction of talented actors, the avowedly feminist Hertha Thiele as the student Manuela, and the more subtle contribution of Dorothea Wieck as the teacher Fräulein von Bernberg. Manuela develops a crush on Fräulein von Bernberg, and the film shows the budding attraction between them in shots and reverse shots of the central characters without any explicit declarations. Manuela confesses her love publicly only after she plays the eponymous hero of Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s classic play Don Carlos, a historical tragedy in which the young prince falls in love with his stepmother while also struggling to prepare for his future role as monarch. While Winsloe originally chose the Hungarian romance &quot;Der Ritter Nérestan&quot; as the play within her play, Sagan&#x27;s substitution of &quot;Don Carlos&quot; gave Thiele a script that allowed Manuela&#x27;s declaration to criticize authoritarian rule and by extension the repressive school regime, as well as to express her love to her teacher. The headmistress forbids Fräulein von Bernburg to see or speak to Manuela again but, when Manuela attempts suicide, the other girls rally around her and save her life, while the headmistress is marginalized out of the frame..

While &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; may have been one of the first films to portray lesbian intimacy with seriousness and sensitivity, it played to German audiences who would have seen other films with women in androgynous garb, in German &quot;Hosenrollen&quot;, from Elisabeth Bergner &quot;to&quot; Marlene Dietrich. &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot;″s success in 1931 was due in large part to its celebration by avowed lesbian magazines such as &quot;Die Freundin&quot; and &quot;Der Skorpion&quot; and their readers but also to broad support for feminist and independent women in Weimar Germany. The Nazis suppressed these magazines and the clubs and other institutions that supported them but did not, contrary to claims, ban the film after they took over in 1933. Even after the Nazified German Film Chamber, still run by Fröhlich, stripped the film of credits to Jewish contributors, including Sagan and many of the young women playing students, &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; circulated in Nazi Germany with advertising favoring Wieck, who disavowed any lesbian content and continued to work in Germany, after Sagan, Thiele, and others had to flee the country. Although threatened with censorship in the U.S. and in Britain, the film had enough impact on British audiences to allow Sagan to produce a stage version based on her film plot, first in London and later in South Africa in 1933, in which revival Sagan not only directed but also played the role of Fräulein von Bernberg. In Germany, having been recut by the Nazi Film Chamber to erase any lesbian elements, Sagan&#x27;s original film was eclipsed after World War II by the sentimental remake &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; by Géza von Radványi, starring Romy Schneider. Sagan&#x27;s original was rediscovered and shown at women&#x27;s film festivals only from the 1970s but its rediscovery sparked renewed interest in Sagan and her contribution to German and world cinema. The restored version with full credits and English subtitles was released in videotape and later DVD format in the US in 1994 and in the UK in 2000.

&quot;Men of Tomorrow&quot; (1934), which Sagan directed for London Film Productions and British-Hungarian producer Alexander Korda, was inspired by her observation of student rivalries between athletes and aesthetes among Oxford University men; as the title suggests, Sagan hoped to shift the emphasis from the earlier drama between women of &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; to young men in &quot;Men of Tomorrow&quot;. Made under more prudish British conditions than Weimar Germany, the treatment of same-sex attachments among Oxford &quot;aesthetes&quot; was more subdued and, according to Sagan&#x27;s account of the plot, the central leader of the aesthetes, ends up marrying a young woman from one of the few women&#x27;s colleges at the University. Korda likely had some influence on this conventional heterosexual ending, and his distributors treated the film as a &quot;quota quickie&quot;. Quota quickies were a low-budget films made in Britain with British cast and crew to enable international producers and distributors such as Korda to fulfill a quota of local films so as to reap far greater profits from British releases of U.S. films. Although Sagan&#x27;s may be confused with a later film called Men of Tomorrow (1945), a quite different story about the Boy Scouts, Sagan&#x27;s film, like many quota quickies, has since vanished, as noted in the List of lost films. The Library of Congress once included a flyer from &quot;The Film Daily&quot; advertising the film in 1934 but that too has disappeared.

== Autobiographies ==
Sagan kept notes on her aspirations and career from her adolescence in Johannesburg through her theatrical training in Vienna, and her theatre and film direction in Germany, Britain, South Africa, and Australia. After her death, her niece Helga Kaye gave the manuscripts, newspaper clippings, and photographs to the Historical Papers archive at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) in Johannesburg. Sagan wrote two versions of her autobiography: the German-language manuscript appears to have been written earlier, and covers her work in Austria and Germany in greater detail, while the English-language one is much longer and includes Sagan&#x27;s &quot;joyride&quot; to Hollywood and her post-war work in Britain and across the British Commonwealth as well as in South Africa.

Both published versions of this autobiographical material blend the English and the German texts to cover Sagan&#x27;s life and work across four continents over more than six decades:

<text>Hongkong Post is a government department of Hong Kong responsible for postal services, though operated as a trading fund. Founded in 1841, it was known as &quot;Postal Department&quot; or &quot;Post Office&quot; () before the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. It has been a sub-member of the Universal Postal Union since 1877, and is a separate entity from China Post.

==History==

Merchants traded in Hong Kong on the two sides of Victoria Harbour as early as before the British possession in 1842. They complained about the absence of proper postal services and therefore the Postal Department was established.

The department was founded on 28 August 1841, but the first post office (known as 書信館 at that time), situated near the current site of St. John&#x27;s Cathedral, opened on 12 November 1841. At first, its right to operation belonged to the Royal Mail, until its transfer to the Postmaster General on 1 May 1860.

On 8 December 1862, the office issued the first set of Hong Kong postal stamps. Before this time, only British troops in Hong Kong could use British stamps, while other local residents did not have access to British stamps. Until the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, mail for British forces serving in the then-colony used the British Forces Post Office number, BFPO 1.

The office introduced automated mail sorting in 1989, and machines were installed in the General Post Office.

There is no post code system in Hong Kong, although one has been under consideration since 2000.

Since August 1995, the office has operated as a trading fund and the full title of the head of the Office became &quot;Postmaster General and general manager of the Post Office Trading Fund&quot; ().

==Postal history==
During the colonial era, Hong Kong produced postage stamps simply bearing the name &quot;Hong Kong&quot;, printed alongside the likenesses (in profile) of the reigning monarchs of the United Kingdom, or royal symbols (for example, &quot;EIIR&quot;).

Since Hong Kong&#x27;s transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997, stamps issued have borne the name &quot;Hong Kong, China&quot;. British Hong Kong postage stamps are no longer valid for prepayment of postage and cannot be repurchased by the Post Office.

==Post offices==
As of 2023, Hongkong Post operates 122 post offices (including 3 mobile post offices) throughout Hong Kong. The detailed locations and opening hours of the post offices are on the Hongkong Post website.

== iPostal Kiosk ==
In mid-2021, Hongkong Post launched iPostal Kisok which offers an automated posting service and enables the public to post mail, purchase postage label and make postage enquiry round-the clock. As of July 2023, there are 23 kiosks located across the city.

== Post boxes ==
Hong Kong imported post-boxes from the UK until the practice was discontinued in the 1980s. Before 1997, the post boxes were painted red, as in the United Kingdom, and were engraved with the royal cypher – for example, &quot;EIIR&quot; to represent Queen Elizabeth II. According to fans of Hong Kong&#x27;s history, featuring the regal insignia on many of the George V and George VI post boxes in Hong Kong are unique as they are different in design from other British post boxes in the world. Since the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997, the livery of the boxes became green, and were adorned with the new Hongkong Post logo.
As of October 2015, there are 1,148 free-standing post-boxes in Hong Kong; only 59 colonial post boxes bearing the royal insignia were still in service. In late 2014 Hongkong Post reaffirmed its policy that the remaining 59 colonial-era post boxes would only be replaced if they were seriously damaged or no longer meet the demand of its customers.

=== Controversy ===
This department of government said in March 2015 that it was considering covering up the regal insignia on these post boxes, on grounds that it was &quot;not desirable to have postboxes that show various royal cyphers from different British reigns&quot; and to &quot;avoid confusion&quot;. Controversy ignited in September upon confirmation that royal cyphers would be covered up by fixing metal plates on all but seven of the historical post boxes. The decision was decried by the Conservancy Association, the Mailboxes Searching Team, and activists opposed to the push of pro-Beijing politicians to &quot;de-colonialise&quot; Hong Kong. According to legislator Claudia Mo of the Civic Party, senior HK Post officials she talked with affirmed that the order to obscure regal insignia on the 59 colonial post boxes came from the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB), which Mo said pointed to a political and not administrative decision.

==Services==
===Post===
In addition to making its income from traditional postal delivery, Hongkong Post also sells philatelic products, and is used by the Government and utility companies to accept payment from customers.

===Philately===
Hongkong Post Stamps was a division set up in 1974, charged with promoting and popularising stamp collecting, to meet the ever-increasing demand for Hong Kong stamps by collectors. The division conducts three main areas of work:

*stamp product design and production
*fulfilment and advance ordering service 
*philatelic marketing.

Owing to the territory&#x27;s conservative stamp-issuing policy, stamp collecting in Hong Kong is a popular hobby. Different types of attractively designed stamp products are also popular with stamp collectors around the world.

===Root certificate===
Since 2000, Hongkong Post is a recognized root certificate authority and issues digital certificates under the trade name &quot;e-Cert&quot;.

===Other===

Hongkong Post also provides services listed below:

* &quot;Local Courier Post&quot;
* &quot;Speedpost&quot;
* Periodicals/Circular/Direct mail services
* &quot;e-Post&quot;
* &quot;e-Cert&quot; (Electronic Certificate for e-commerce)
* &quot;e-Business&quot;
* Franking machine
* Postal remittance service (to Canada, Mainland China, Indonesia, Japan, Nepal and the Philippines)
* Electronic remittance service (through Western Union)
* &quot;PayThruPost&quot; (Bill payment)
* Logistics, etc.

==Incidents==

*In 2005, newspapers revealed the presence of pinhole cameras in Cheung Sha Wan Post Office, and this was perceived as a violation of people&#x27;s privacy. Hongkong Post explained that the cameras were necessary for facilitating police investigations into several suspected theft cases.
*In March 2007, two postal staff lost three bags of mail, destined for Wan Chai and the Eastern District, in the management offices of Hongkong Post buildings. Although Hongkong Post eventually found one of the lost bags, 400 letters were reportedly lost.
*In December 2019, Hongkong Post made a notable announcement regarding a modification to one of its new stamp designs. The original design featured black-clad children and the Hongkong Post stated the changes were solely made for aesthetic reasons. But online commentators argued that this change was likely an attempt to avoid any resemblance between black-clad children with anti-government protesters at the time.
*As the demand for delivery services during the coronavirus pandemic surged since November 2020, scammers have cheated more than 100 Hongkongers out of HKD $2.2 million through phishing text messages and emails claiming to be from Hongkong Post.

==Achievements==
* Winner of the 2005 &quot;Hong Kong Awards for Industries – Productivity and Quality Award&quot; for achievement in productivity enhancement and total quality management.
* Winner of the Caring Organisation Logo 2005/06 by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service.
* Winner of the Gold Level Certification in the Universal Postal Union EMS Cooperative Audit and Measurement Programme 2005.
* Winner of the Web Care Award 2005 – Gold Prize from Internet Professional Association.

<doc id="1245832" wikidata="Q3186753" url="?curid=1245832" title="Zero Minus Ten">
<text>Zero Minus Ten, published in 1997, is the first novel by Raymond Benson featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond following John Gardner&#x27;s departure in 1996. Published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and in America by Putnam, the book is set in Hong Kong, China, Jamaica, England and some parts of Western Australia.

Benson&#x27;s working title for the novel was &quot;No Tears for Hong Kong&quot;; this was eventually used as the title for the last chapter in the novel.

==Continuity==
According to Raymond Benson, as far as character continuity was concerned, he had been given free lease by Ian Fleming Publications (then Glidrose Publications) to follow or ignore other continuation authors as he saw fit. Benson took a middle-of-the-road approach to this. While Benson treats Ian Fleming&#x27;s novels as strictly canon, Gardner&#x27;s novels are not, though there are some aspects that he adopts.

For instance, in Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Win, Lose or Die&quot; Bond is promoted to Captain, but Benson&#x27;s novels have Bond holding the rank of Commander again with no explanation. Some of Gardner&#x27;s original recurring characters are also not present, including Ann Reilly (aka Q&#x27;ute), who, by the end of Gardner&#x27;s era, had taken over Q Branch from Major Boothroyd; Benson features Major Boothroyd, again, with no explanation. Some of Gardner&#x27;s changes do remain—for instance, Benson&#x27;s Bond continues to smoke cigarettes from H. Simmons of Burlington Arcade, which dates from Gardner&#x27;s &quot;For Special Services&quot; (1982). Additionally, the Bond girls Fredericka von Grüsse (&quot;Never Send Flowers&quot; / &quot;SeaFire&quot;), Harriet Horner (&quot;Scorpius&quot;), and Easy St. John (&quot;Death is Forever&quot;) are all mentioned. Benson&#x27;s other novels also retain aspects of Gardner&#x27;s series, though there is just as much that he ignores.

Some elements of the films also carry over into Benson&#x27;s novels. M, for instance, is not Sir Miles Messervy, but the female M who was first introduced in the film &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995), although Gardner also introduced this character in his novelisation of that film and retained the character through his final novel &quot;COLD&quot; (1996). Bond also reverts to using his trusty Walther PPK, claiming he had switched to other guns (notably the ASP in Gardner&#x27;s later novels), but felt that it was time he used it again. The follow-up to &quot;Zero Minus Ten&quot;, the novelization to &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, has Bond switching to the Walther P99, which remains Bond&#x27;s main weapon throughout Benson&#x27;s novels. Later novels by Benson also attempt to insert some of the characters from the films into his story. In &quot;The Facts of Death&quot;, for instance, Admiral Hargreaves is present at a party.

==Plot summary==
As the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the British to the People&#x27;s Republic of China nears, Bond is given ten days to investigate a series of terrorist attacks that could disrupt the fragile handover and cause the breakout of a large-scale war. Simultaneously a nuclear bomb is test-detonated in the Australian outback. In Hong Kong, Bond suspects a British shipping magnate, Guy Thackeray, who he catches cheating at mahjong at a casino in Macau. Later, after cheating the cheater and winning a large sum of Thackeray&#x27;s money, Bond attends a press conference where Thackeray announces that he is selling his company, EurAsia Enterprises, to the Chinese; not disclosed to the public is that this is due to a long-forgotten legal document that grants the descendants of Li Wei Tam ownership of the company if the British were to ever lose control of Hong Kong. Because the descendants were believed to have abandoned China, General Wong claims the document on behalf of the Chinese government and forces Thackeray out. Immediately following the announcement, Thackeray is killed by a car bomb planted by an unknown assassin, the latest of a series of assassinations that claimed the lives of the entire EurAsia board of directors, as well as several employees.

Through his Hong Kong contact, T.Y. Woo, Bond also investigates Li Xu Nan, the Triad head of the Dragon Wing society and the rightful descendant of Li Wei Tam. Li&#x27;s identity as the Triad head is supposed to be a secret, though after Bond involves a hostess, Sunni Pei, 007 is forced to protect her from the Triads for breaking an oath of secrecy. When she is finally captured, Bond makes a deal, off the record, to go to Guangzhou and retrieve the long-forgotten document from General Wong that will give Li Xu Nan ownership of EurAsia Enterprises upon the handover at midnight on 1 July 1997. Through Li&#x27;s contacts, Bond successfully travels and meets General Wong in Guangzhou under the guise of a solicitor from England. Bond&#x27;s cover is later blown and T.Y. Woo, who followed Bond, is executed. Bond avenges his friend&#x27;s death by killing General Wong, stealing the document, which he hand-delivers to Li Xu Nan, and rescuing Sunni Pei.

With Li Xu Nan in Bond&#x27;s debt, Bond uses Li&#x27;s contacts to go to Australia to investigate EurAsia Enterprises and find a link between it and the nuclear blast. As it turns out Thackeray is very much alive and has been mining unreported uranium in Australia to make his own nuclear bomb, which he plans to detonate in Hong Kong at the moment the handover takes place in retaliation for the loss of his family&#x27;s legacy. Returning to Hong Kong, Bond, Li Xu Nan, and a Royal Navy captain track down Thackeray&#x27;s nuclear bomb and defuse it. The battle claims the lives of Li Xu Nan as well as Thackeray, who is drowned by Bond in the harbour.

==Major characters==
* James Bond – British Secret Service agent sent to investigate numerous terrorist attacks in Hong Kong as the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the British to the People&#x27;s Republic of China nears.
* M – The successor to Sir Miles Messervy and the head of the British Secret Service, she sends Bond to investigate a number of terrorist attacks in Hong Kong that could potentially disrupt the fragile handover and cause the breakout of a large-scale war.
* Guy Thackeray – A British shipping magnate, his company EurAsia Enterprises is being stripped from him when the handover takes place on 1 July 1997. In retaliation Thackeray uses his company to build, test, and attempt to detonate a nuclear bomb in Hong Kong, making it uninhabitable.
* General Wong – A general from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Although a member of the Communist Party, he is a corrupt and greedy leader who attempts to claim EurAsia Enterprises not only for China, but for himself.
* Li Xu Nan – The head of the Dragon Wing Triad. He is the rightful descendant of Li Wei Tam and heir to EurAsia Enterprises when the handover takes place on 1 July 1997.
* Sunni Pei – A &quot;Blue Lantern&quot; (associated non-member) of the Dragon Wing Triad, she seemingly betrays Li Xu Nan by giving up his identity at a club to Bond. Subsequently, Bond feels obliged to protect her once Li Xu Nan issues a death warrant for her.
* T.Y. Woo – Working for the British Secret Service station in Hong Kong, he meets Bond upon his arrival. He later sets up Bond in a mahjong game at a casino in Macau so that Bond can get to know Guy Thackeray.

==Trivia==
* As the novel begins, Bond is in Jamaica at his newly purchased estate that he dubs &quot;Shamelady&quot;. The estate was previously owned by a &quot;well-known British journalist and author.&quot; The author is in fact Ian Fleming and the estate, Goldeneye, where Fleming wrote every James Bond novel till his death in 1964. Shamelady was suggested to Fleming in 1952 for Goldeneye by his wife, Ann Rothermere. &quot;Shame Lady&quot; is another name for the plant &quot;mimosa pudica&quot;.

<text>Sinus Lunicus (; Latin for &quot;Bay of Lunik&quot;) is an area of lunar mare along the southeast edge of the Mare Imbrium on the Earth&#x27;s Moon. It is formed by the area enclosed by the prominent craters Archimedes to the southwest, Autolycus to the southeast, and Aristillus to the northeast. The bay is open to the northwest, and faces the Montes Spitzbergen, a small chain of mountains.

This bay was named the &quot;Bay of Lunik&quot; by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1970 to honor the landing site of &quot;Luna 2&quot;, the first human space probe to make contact with another interplanetary body. The &quot;Luna 2&quot; landed in the gap between the craters Archimedes and Autolycus on September 14, 1959.

The selenographic coordinates of Sinus Lunicus are 32.4° N and 1.9° W. Its diameter is 120 kilometers. The most distinctive features on the bay are the complex outer s of ejecta from the craters Aristillus and Autolycus, and the small satellite craters Archimedes C and Archimedes D. The albedo of the surface is brightened by overlapping ray material from Autolycus and Aristillus.

<text>Little Woodbury is the name of an Iron Age archaeological site in Britford parish, near Salisbury in the English county of Wiltshire. The site, which is just north of Salisbury District Hospital, is a scheduled monument.

The site lies about south of the centre of Salisbury and north of Odstock village, at . It was partially excavated in 1938 and 1939 by Gerhard Bersu. In excavations like Little Woodbury he introduced the revolutionary approaches in the excavation of settlements (e.g. the identification of timber post remains) developed in continental Europe during previous decades.

== Discovery and excavation ==
Gerhard Bersu, a German archaeologist who had been driven to Britain following discrimination by the Nazis, was commissioned in 1938 by the Prehistoric Society to excavate the site in order to improve knowledge of early British settlement sites, which were until then poorly understood. A settlement had been identified at the site through aerial archaeology by O.G.S. Crawford almost twenty years previously, when he had seen a circular enclosure as a cropmark.

Bersu worked at the site from 12 June to 18 September 1938, and 12 June to 19 July 1939. He dug a network of 4-5m wide parallel trenches, one after the other, across the site. By this method he was able to identify a large roundhouse and several other domestic features such as corn-drying frames, granaries, and storage pits. The postholes of the roundhouse enabled Bersu to argue that these structures were the common domestic building type of the Iron Age; prior to his work it was thought that people lived in clusters of pit-dwellings in the ground. 

Through Bersu&#x27;s identification of animal bone and cereal grains, he convinced other archaeologists to re-evaluate the large holes they had found as storage pits. Though he only excavated around 190 pits, Bersu estimated that there were roughly 360 more unexcavated ones further underground. He posited that since the storage pits could only be used for a limited amount of time before pests and putrefaction set in, they were often replaced by new pits, with only around 12 being open at a time. Stratified layers of loose chalk, humus-soil, burnt and unburnt flints, small potsherds, bones, and powdered ash showed evidence of the pits being refilled as soon as new pits were dug.

During his identification of timber post remains, Bersu was able to assemble a ground-plan of the main roundhouse. It was composed of four elements: two outer rings of post-holes (with a max diameter of 15 m), another concentric ring of post-holes (1.5-2 m further in), a group of posts in a square formation (4 m from the inner ring), and a gap (3 m wide) in the east side of the two outer rings marking the entrance. However, Bersu had difficulty deciding what the configuration of a reconstruction would look like.

When war broke out in 1939, work stopped and Bersu was interned on the Isle of Man. He never returned to the site and post-excavation work was never fully completed. Regardless, Bersu&#x27;s discoveries inspired excavations like West Harling and Itford Hill when it came to the identification of Iron Age settlements.

== Roundhouse reconstruction ==
In 2008, a recreation of the roundhouse was built at the Butser Ancient Farm open-air museum in Hampshire.

<doc id="1245846" wikidata="Q3506525" url="?curid=1245846" title="Pinus johannis">
<text>Pinus johannis, the Johann&#x27;s pine, is a pine in the pinyon pine group, native to North America. The range extends from southeast Arizona and southwest New Mexico, United States, south in Mexico along the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Sierra Madre Oriental to southern Zacatecas and San Luis Potosí. It occurs at moderate to high altitudes, from , in cool, dry climate conditions.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus johannis&quot; is a small to medium-size tree, often just a shrub, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to . The bark is grey-brown, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in mixed fascicles of three and four, slender, long, and deep green to blue-green, with stomata confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces.

The cones are globose, long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 16–18 months old, with only a small number of thin, fragile scales, typically 6-12 fertile scales. The cones open to broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds are long, with a thick shell, a white endosperm, and a vestigial wing; they are dispersed by the Mexican jay, which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a major food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use; some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees.

&quot;Pinus johannis&quot; is nearly dioecious: nearly all individuals produce either male or female cones only, and trees do not appear to change their sex expression over time.

==History==
&quot;Pinus johannis&quot; is a recently described pinyon pine, discovered by Elbert L. Little in 1968 when comparing pinyons growing in Arizona with those of typical Mexican pinyon (&quot;Pinus cembroides&quot;) in Mexico; he described it as a variety of Mexican pinyon, &quot;Pinus cembroides&quot; var. &quot;bicolor&quot;, noting the very different stomatal placing on the leaves; it also differs in needle number, with 3–4 per fascicle, rather than 2–3; in the cones having thinner scales; and in having a denser, more rounded crown. Further research by the French botanist Marie-Françoise Robert-Passini, the American botanists Dana K. Bailey and Frank G. Hawksworth and others, has shown that it is better treated as a distinct species. Although often occurring together with Mexican pinyon, it is reproductively isolated from that by its pollination being a month to two months later in summer, rather than in spring, thereby preventing hybridisation.

As Robert-Passini and Bailey &amp; Hawksworth were working in different areas at about the same time, it was raised to species rank twice, first as &quot;Pinus johannis&quot; by Robert-Passini (naming it after her husband Jean) examining specimens in the Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico, and then later as &quot;Pinus discolor&quot; by Bailey &amp; Hawksworth examining specimens in the northern Sierra Madre Occidental in Arizona.

There are slight differences between the plants in the two ranges; those in the eastern being more shrubby and with larger cones than those in the western range, and also differences in the resin composition; they are though generally very similar and recognition of both as separate species from each other does not appear warranted.

Some botanists also still include &quot;P. johannis&quot; in Mexican pinyon as a variety or even not distinguished at all, accounting for reports of &quot;Mexican pinyon&quot; in Arizona and New Mexico. This is despite the two frequently occurring together at the same sites with no hybridisation.

&quot;Pinus johannis&quot; is most closely allied to Orizaba pinyon (&quot;Pinus orizabensis&quot;) and Potosi pinyon (&quot;Pinus culminicola&quot;), with which it shares the leaf structure with the stomata confined to the inner faces; it differs from the former in the smaller cones and seeds, and from the latter in fewer needles per fascicle (3–4 vs 5).

==Uses==
The edible pine nut seeds are collected in Mexico to a small extent.

The white-glaucous inner surfaces of the needles make it a very attractive small tree, suitable for parks and large gardens.

<text>Macario Sakay y de León (March 1, 1870 – September 13, 1907) was a Filipino general who took part in the 1896 Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire and in the Philippine–American War. After the war was declared over by the United States in 1902, Sakay continued resistance by leading guerrilla raids. The following year he established the Tagalog Republic with himself as president. Sakay was executed by hanging in 1907.

==Early life==
Macario Sakay de León was born on March 1, 1878, along Tabora Street, Tondo, in the City of Manila. He first worked as an apprentice in a &quot;kalesa&quot; (carriage) manufacturing shop. He was also a tailor and a stage actor, performing in a number of plays including &quot;Principe Baldovino&quot;, &quot;Doce Pares de Francia&quot;, and &quot;Amante de la Corona&quot;.

An original member of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; movement, which he joined in 1894, he fought alongside Andrés Bonifacio against the Spanish throughout the Philippine Revolution. In 1899, he continued the struggle for Philippine independence against the United States. Early in the Philippine–American War, he was jailed for seditious activities, and later released as part of an amnesty.

==After the war==
Sakay was one of the founders of the &quot;Partido Nacionalista&quot; (unrelated to the present Nacionalista Party founded in 1907), which sought to achieve Philippine independence through legal means. The party appealed to the Philippine Commission, but the Commission passed the Sedition Law, which prohibited any form of propaganda advocating independence. Sakay took up arms again.

==After the capture of Aguinaldo==
Contrary to popular belief, the Philippine resistance to American rule did not end with the capture of General Emilio Aguinaldo. Several forces remained at large, including one led by Sakay. Sakay&#x27;s rank and association within Aguinaldo&#x27;s Revolutionary Government is unknown. When Aguinaldo surrendered to the US, Sakay seized the leadership of the revolution and declared himself Supreme President of the Tagalog Republic. He said this included all the islands of the Philippines from Luzon to Mindanao. Taking over the Morong–Nueva Ecija command and assigning his deputies to take charge of the other Tagalog regions, Sakay wrote a constitution in which traitors, or supporters of the enemy, were to be punished with exile, imprisonment, or death. In May 1902, Sakay and his men declared open resistance to the US and conducted guerrilla raids that lasted for five years.

==Tagalog Republic==
Around 1902, Sakay established the Tagalog Republic somewhere in the mountains of Rizal. His first military circulars and presidential orders as &quot;President and Commander-in-Chief&quot; were issued in 1903. Sakay&#x27;s military circular No. 1 was dated May 5, 1903, and his Presidential Order No. 1 was dated March 18, 1903.

===Military organization===
In Sakay&#x27;s military circular No. 7, dated June 19, 1903, the government of the Tagalog Republic (called the &quot;Republic of the Philippines&quot;) affirmed the formation of an organized army. The army units were composed of &quot;Kabohans&quot; (eight soldiers, equivalent to a squad), &quot;Camilleros&quot; (nine soldiers), &quot;Companias&quot; (117 soldiers, equivalent to a company, and &quot;Batalions&quot; (801 soldiers, equivalent to battalion). However, in Sakay&#x27;s Second Manifesto, dated April 5, 1904, it said the exact number of soldiers in the army could not be ascertained. There are insufficient documents to provide a basis for historians to speculate on the size of the Republic&#x27;s army, but these demonstrate that Sakay&#x27;s army existed and that it was led by officers appointed and commissioned by Sakay himself.

In Sakay&#x27;s presidential order No. 2, dated May 8, 1903, the government, in search of sources of weapons to carry out its struggle against the Americans, said that it was willing to confer military rank on citizens who could turn over firearms to the Presidential Office or any of the headquarters under its command. Ranks would be conferred by the following schedule: 10 to 15 firearms, rank of lieutenant; 16 to 25 firearms, captain; 26 to 36 firearms, major; 40 to 50 firearms, colonel. In Sakay&#x27;s military order No. 5, dated May 25, 1903, the government assigned the following color codes for the divisions of its army: artillery (red), infantry (light blue), cavalry (dark blue), engineering (dark brown), chief-of-staff (dark green), sanitary (yellow), and marines (gray).

===Planned kidnapping===
According to General Leon Villafuerte, his, Carreon&#x27;s and Sakay&#x27;s forces planned to kidnap Alice Roosevelt Longworth, the daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt, who was planning to visit the Philippines. The plan was to trade her to the Americans in exchange for the immediate recognition of Philippine independence. The kidnapping was not attempted since Longworth postponed her trip by train to Baguio.

==Surrender and betrayal==
In 1905, Filipino labour leader Dominador Gómez was authorised by Governor-General Henry Clay Ide to negotiate for the surrender of Sakay and his men. Gómez met with Sakay at his camp and argued that the establishment of a national assembly was being held up by Sakay&#x27;s intransigence, and that its establishment would be the first step toward Filipino independence. Sakay agreed to end his resistance on the condition that a general amnesty be granted to his men, that they be permitted to carry firearms, and that he and his officers be permitted to leave the country. Gómez assured Sakay that these conditions would be acceptable to the Americans, and Sakay&#x27;s emissary, General León Villafuerte, obtained agreement to them from the American Governor-General.

Sakay believed that the struggle had shifted to constitutional means, and that the establishment of the assembly was a means to win independence. As a result, he surrendered on July 14, 1906, descending from the mountains on the promise of an amnesty for him and his officials, and the formation of a Philippine Assembly composed of Filipinos that would serve as the &quot;gate of freedom&quot;. With Villafuerte, Sakay travelled to Manila, where they were welcomed and invited to receptions and banquets.

One invitation came from the Constabulary Chief, American Colonel Harry H. Bandholtz, to a party in Cavite hosted by the acting governor Colonel Louis J. Van Schaick on July 17; it was a trap. Sakay and his principal lieutenants were disarmed and arrested while the party was in progress.

At his trial, Sakay was accused of &quot;bandolerismo&quot; &quot;under the Brigandage Act of Nov. 12, 1902, which interpreted all acts of armed resistance to American rule as banditry.&quot; The American colonial Supreme Court of the Philippines upheld the decision. Sakay was convicted and sentenced to death, and hanged on September 13, 1907.

Before his death, he made the following statement:
He was buried at Manila North Cemetery later that day.

==Legacy==
* A life-sized statue of Sakay was unveiled at the Plaza Morga in Tondo, by the Manila Historical Heritage Commission on September 13, 2008, the 101st anniversary of his death. That same month, the Senate adopted two separate resolutions honouring Sakay&#x27;s life and his fellow freedom fighters for their contribution to the cause of independence.
* Camp General Macario Sakay in Los Baños, Laguna was named after the general in January 2016, when Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Gen. Hernando Iriberri issued General Order No. 30, changing the camp&#x27;s name from Camp Eldridge, a name the camp had been given during the American occupation a century prior.

<doc id="1245850" wikidata="Q241387" url="?curid=1245850" title="Antipope Victor IV (1159–1164)">
<text>Victor IV (born Octavian or Octavianus: &quot;Ottaviano dei Crescenzi Ottaviani di Monticelli&quot;) (1095 – 20 April 1164) was elected as a Ghibelline antipope in 1159, following the death of Pope Adrian IV and the election of Alexander III. His election was supported by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. He took the name Victor IV, not acknowledging Antipope Victor IV of 1138, whose holding of the papal office was deemed illegitimate.

==Early life and career==
Octaviano Monticelli belonged to the powerful Theophylacti house, whose members often became popes in the 10th through 12th centuries. He was appointed as rector of Benevento in May 1137, and cardinal priest of San Nicola in Carcere in 1138. In 1151 Octaviano became cardinal priest of Santa Cecilia. He was described by John of Salisbury as eloquent and refined, but petty and parsimonious. When he was sent with Cardinal Jordan of Santa Susanna as a papal legate to summon Conrad III of Germany to Italy to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor, he quarrelled with his co-legate and, in John of Salisbury&#x27;s words, &quot;made the Church a laughingstock&quot;. In Germany, he met Frederick, duke of Swabia, who would soon become the new Emperor Frederick Barbarossa; the cardinal was present at the imperial election.

==Reign as pope==
===Election===
Following the death of Pope Adrian IV, the College of Cardinals gathered to elect a new pope. During the Papal election of 4–7 September 1159 they elected the chancellor Rolando, who assumed the title of Alexander III. However, five cardinals, the clergy of St. Peter&#x27;s, and the Roman populace refused to recognize him and elected their own candidate Octaviano on 7 September 1159. He was very popular on account of his liberality, accessibility, and splendour of living. He was considered a great friend of the Germans and rested his hopes on the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Yet it is not to be assumed that the emperor, busy with the Siege of Crema, had desired his election; Rolando was certainly not agreeable to him, yet neither was it to his interest to have an antipope.

===Consecration===
Victor IV was consecrated on 4 October in the abbey of Farfa by Cardinal-Bishop Imar of Tusculum, dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, assisted by Ubaldo, bishop of Ferentino and Riccardo, bishop of Melfi. With the armed assistance of Otto von Wittelsbach and his own armed groups in relatively short time he took control over the City of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter, while Alexander III took refuge in the territory of the Kingdom of Sicily, and later in France.

===Synods===
Both popes sent their legates to the Catholic kingdoms in order to secure their recognition. Frederick was at first neutral, but with clerical advice convoked a synod at Pavia in February 1160, which was attended by about fifty archbishops and bishops. The emperor, after the sacking of Crema the previous month, summoned both popes to Pavia. Alexander III declined, arguing that the pope should be subjected only to the judgment of God. Frederick then declared himself in favour of Victor IV, and the synod decided, as was to be expected, for Victor, and pronounced an anathema upon Alexander. On February 11, 1160, the council ended with a procession to Pavia Cathedral. Here Victor was received by the emperor, who, as a sign of humility, helped him to get off the horse and took him by the hand and led him to the altar and kissed his feet. Most of the episcopate of the Empire followed the decision of the synod. However, this attempt to secure Victor&#x27;s recognition was never completely successful in Germany, since Bishop Eberhard of Salzburg was his principal opponent. In response, Alexander on his side excommunicated both Frederick I and Victor IV.

From 1159 to 1162, Victor participated in four councils; Pavia(February 1160), Lodi(June 1161), St.-Jean-de-Losne(September 1162), and Trier(November 1162). All were convened under the auspices to condemn Alexander III and his supporters.
===Recognition===
King Valdemar I of Denmark also gave his support to Victor IV, but the primate of Denmark archbishop Eskil of Lund became a partisan of Alexander III. It seems that Poland also supported Victor IV. Alexander was nevertheless able to gain the support of the rest of western Europe, because since the days of Hildebrand the power of the pope over the church in the various countries had increased so greatly that the kings of France and of England could not view with indifference a revival of such imperial control of the papacy as had been exercised by the Emperor Henry III. Therefore, France, England, Castile, Sweden, Norway, Scotland, Hungary, Sicily, and the Crusader states in Outremer recognized Alexander III as true pope, even if in some of these countries there were significant Victorine minorities in episcopates or among feudal rulers. The papal schism in Europe was now a fact.

In 1162, King Louis VII of France wavered once more. Frederick then attempted to convoke a joint council at Saint-Jean-de-Losne with Louis VII to decide the issue of who should be the pope. Louis neared the meeting site, but when he became aware that Frederick had stacked the votes for Alexander, Louis decided not to attend the council. As a result, the issue was not resolved at that time. This disastrous meeting had as its result that the king held firmly to the obedience of Alexander. During the years 1162–1165 Alexander lived in France, and from 1163 the pope exerted himself to gain more of Germany for his cause.

==Death==
All uncertainty came to an end on 20 April 1164. That day, while travelling with Rainald of Dassel, Victor IV died at Lucca. When Pope Alexander III learned of the death of his rival, he wept, and reprimanded his cardinals when they showed inappropriate delight. The clergy of the Lucca Cathedral and San Frediano would not allow Victor IV buried there because of his excommunication. Therefore, he was buried in a local monastery. When miracles were reported at his tomb, it was destroyed by order of Pope Gregory VIII in December 1187. Victor&#x27;s successor was Paschal III.

<text>Victor IV (died after April 1139) was an antipope for a short time, from March to 29 May 1138.

==Biography==
Possibly he was born in Ceccano, as Gregorio dei Conti di Ceccano. 

Pope Paschal II created him cardinal-priest of SS. XII Apostoli, at the latest in 1102. He was with the pope at Bèze on 18 February 1107. 
===Investiture controversy===
In February 1111, King Henry V came to Rome to demand his imperial coronation. On 12 February the ceremony took place at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and during the welcome at the door, the pope read out a decree, in which he repudiated lay investiture, and ordered all bishops to surrender their imperial fiefs to the emperor immediately and permanently. The king and the indignant bishops retired to discuss the shocking demand, and, as evening approached, the pope refused the coronation. After Mass, he and the cardinals were taken into custody by Henry&#x27;s armed troops, and on 16 February, after a battle with the Romans in the Borgo, Henry and his captive prelates departed the city. The pope and sixteen cardinals, including Gregory of SS. XII Apostoli, were held captive for sixty-one days, while Henry pressed the pope to agree to his solution to the investiture controversy. On 18 April, at Ponte Mammolo on the Anio River, Gregory was one of the cardinals who were compelled to sign the papal promise to observe the agreement which Henry had drawn up.

In 1111, Pope Paschal delegated Cardinal Gregory to hold a synod in Veroli, to complete business which had begun in the papal court, concerning the crimes of the Archdeacon Grimaldi.

After Paschal&#x27;s meeting with the emperor, criticism of him grew louder and louder, particularly from among the Gregorians, who saw the &quot;Privilegium&quot; as a betrayal of everything they had been doing to free the Church from the State. Paschal retreated from the scorn and the disdain to Terracina, where he was confronted on 5 July by the cardinals, led by Giovanni of Tusculum and Leo of Ostia. Pascal promised he would fix his error, but instead retreated farther, to the island of Ponza.

Pressure mounted on the pope until he was prevailed upon to summon a synod to deal with the &quot;Privilege&quot;. The synod met on 18—23 March 1112, with more than 100 bishops in attendance. The leaders in the movement, who presented the documentary evidence to the Lateran synod, were: the papal legate in Aquitaine, Archbishop Gerard of Angoulême; the bishops Leo of Ostia and Galo of St. Pol-de-Leon; and the cardinals Robert of S. Eusebio and Gregory of SS. XII Apostolorum. It is said that they were responsible for drawing up the final statement, &quot;Privilegium illud.&quot; The council emphatically condemned the &quot;privilege&quot; granted by Pope Paschal. In 1112 Paschal deposed him from his title because he had severely criticised (together with cardinal Robert of Sant&#x27;Eusebio, also subsequently deposed) Paschal&#x27;s policy towards the emperor Henry V.

===Cardinalate restored===
In February 1119, shortly after the election of Calixtus II was announced in Rome, he and Cardinal Robert, along with numerous other schismatics, wrote to the new pope, congratulating that his election was neither simoniac nor motivated by &quot;the tumour of ambition&quot;, and begging his pardon and absolution. Gregory and Robert both knew Archbishop Guy de Bourgogne of Vienne, when he attended the Roman synod of March 1112. They may also have known of Archbishop Guy&#x27;s synod, held in October 1112, in which the council called Pope Paschal a simpleton (&quot;quod rex extorsit a vestra simplicitate&quot;) and excommunicated Henry V. Calixtus restored Gregory to his cardinalate, though his earliest subscription of a papal document is dated 6 April 1123; his signature in second place seems to indicate that he was restored without loss of seniority. He continued to subscribe to papal documents until the summer before the death of Pope Calixtus on 13 December 1124.

Cardinal Gregory also regularly subscribed documents for the new pope, Honorius II (Cardinal Lamberto, Bishop of Ostia). He was at the Lateran in 1125, 1126, 1127, 1128, and 1129.

On 11 April 1126, after a year-long contest of wills, Pope Honorius II excommunicated the abbot of Montecassino, Oderisio II (1123—1126), and all the monks in his faction. When the other faction attempted to conduct an election for his successor, as they claimed was their canonical right, civil war broke out in the Montecassino community between the supporters of Oderisio and the supporters of abbot Nicola (1126—1127). In the crisis, intending to exert papal control over a monastery which was far too independent, Pope Honorius sent Cardinal Gregory of SS. XII Apostolorum to Montecassino, with orders to sort out the situation and have elected the pope&#x27;s candidate, Senioretto, the Provost of the monastery at Capua. This merely fired up Oderisius to hire troops and destroy the Rocca di Bantra, which was held by supporters of abbot Nicola. The election was not successfully managed by Cardinal Gregorio, and, in 1127, Honorius appointed Cardinal Conrad of S. Pudenziana to get Senioretto elected abbot, and then Cardinal Matteo, Bishop of Albano. After the surrender of Oderisio to the pope and the expulsion of Nicola for depleting the church treasury, a proper canonical election, achieved by papal intrusion, finally took place in July 1127.

===Schism===
In the papal election of 14 February 1130, he joined the obedience of Anacletus II (1130–1138). In February 1130, Gregory was one of the twenty-eight cardinals who wrote to Lothair, King of the Romans, explaining the events surrounding the papal election of 1130, and blaming Cardinal Aimeric for having attempted to carry out a coup-d&#x27;état. On 27 March 1130, Cardinal Gregory, along with thirteen other cardinals, subscribed a bull of Pope Anacletus confirming the privileges and property of the monastery of S. Paul outside-the-walls in Rome.

After the death of Pope Anacletus on 25 January 1138, his cardinals were in some uncertainty as to how to proceed. They, therefore, took counsel, first with the family of the Pierleoni, their most important supporters among the Roman aristocracy, and then with King Roger II of Sicily, their most important political ally in Italy. Robert advised them to hold the election. It was to his advantage to have another pope to oppose Innocent and Lothair. The cardinals, therefore, assembled for the election.

Cardinal Gregory was chosen as Anacletus&#x27; successor in mid-March 1138, taking the name Victor IV. However, through the negotiation skills of Bernard of Clairvaux, over a period of eight weeks, he was induced to make his submission to Pope Innocent II on 29 May 1138. Innocent had also bribed the brothers Pierleoni to change sides. Innocent initially restored him as cardinal of SS. Apostoli, but in the Second Lateran Council in April 1139 all the former adherents of Anacletus II were condemned and deposed, despite explicit promises given by Innocent. Then Gregory retired to the priorate of S. Eusebio in Fontanella. The date of his death is not recorded. A successor in the title of SS. Apostoli, Hildebrand, appears for the first time on January 4, 1157.

<doc id="1245853" wikidata="Q7571745" url="?curid=1245853" title="Soviet and communist studies">
<text>Soviet and communist studies, or simply Soviet studies, is the field of regional and historical studies on the Soviet Union and other communist states, as well as the history of communism and of the communist parties that existed or still exist in some form in many countries, both inside and outside the former Eastern Bloc, such as the Communist Party USA. Aspects of its historiography have attracted debates between historians on several topics, including totalitarianism and Cold War espionage.

Soviet and Eastern European studies was also a form of area studies that included the study of various aspects of Soviet society, including agriculture, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), trade relations in the Warsaw Pact, cultural and scientific achievements, nationality policies, Kremlinology, human rights, policies towards religions, imperialism, and collectivization. The wider field included independent study in universities and academia, as well as some support from military and intelligence. Major contemporary journals included &quot;Soviet Studies&quot; (now &quot;Europe-Asia Studies&quot;)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Communisme&quot;, &quot;Journal of Cold War Studies&quot;, &quot;Slavic Review&quot;, and &quot;The Russian Review&quot;, among others. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the field focused on historical studies and began to include comparisons to the post-Soviet years as well as new data from the Soviet archives.

== Historiography ==

The academic field after World War II and during the Cold War was dominated by the &quot;totalitarian model&quot; of the Soviet Union, stressing the absolute nature of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s power. The &quot;totalitarian model&quot; was first outlined in the 1950s by political scientist Carl Joachim Friedrich, who posited that the Soviet Union and other communist states were totalitarian systems, with the personality cult and almost unlimited powers of the &quot;great leader&quot; such as Stalin. The &quot;revisionist school&quot; beginning in the 1960s focused on relatively autonomous institutions which might influence policy at the higher level. Matt Lenoe describes the &quot;revisionist school&quot; as representing those who &quot;insisted that the old image of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian state bent on world domination was oversimplified or just plain wrong. They tended to be interested in social history and to argue that the Communist Party leadership had had to adjust to social forces.&quot; These &quot;revisionist school&quot; historians such as J. Arch Getty and Lynne Viola challenged the &quot;totalitarian model&quot;, which was considered to be outdated, and were active in the former communist states&#x27; archives, especially the State Archive of the Russian Federation related to the Soviet Union. 

Some critics of the totalitarian model, such as Robert C. Tucker, formulated an alternative that also focused on the personality cult of Stalin. Tucker, influenced by George F. Kennan&#x27;s writings on how the Soviet Union had reverted into a tsarist autocracy, emphasized that the Soviet Union was not guided by socialism or ideology but more by ruling class. This perspective emerged significantly from ideas of neo-Freudian psychoanalysis, evaluating Stalin as a deeply paranoid tyrant and in the process creating a more tsarist-type government. Moshe Lewin cautioned historians not to &quot;over-Stalinize&quot; the whole of Soviet history, while he also stated that the Soviet Union developed a &quot;propensity for authoritarianism&quot; after Marxian principles had failed to be established. Lewin argued that the Soviet Union recapitulated a &quot;bureaucratic absolutism&quot; almost Prussian in nature, where the &quot;monarch was dependent on his bureaucracy&quot;. Some revisionists also focused on contradictions of the Soviet regime, such as the idea that Soviet elites had betrayed communist ideals in forming top-down apparatuses, as well as demonstrating national chauvinism in oppressive policies or become anti-leftist despite the state imagery. One example was David Brandenberger&#x27;s concept of National Bolshevism to describe the Stalinist regime&#x27;s turn against internationalism, with Russian cultural hegemony and xenophobia becoming the main ideological currents from the 1930s. Nikolai Mitrokhin highlighted the ethnocentrism and antisemitism of the CPSU and Moscow administration of the Soviet era.

According to John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, the historiography is characterized by a split between traditionalists and revisionists. &quot;Traditionalists&quot; characterize themselves as objective reporters of what they see as a &quot;totalitarian nature&quot; of communism and communist states. They are criticized by their opponents as being anti-communist in their eagerness on continuing to focus on the issues of the Cold War. Alternative characterizations for traditionalists include &quot;anti-Communist&quot;, &quot;conservative&quot;, &quot;Draperite&quot; (after Theodore Draper), &quot;orthodox&quot;, and &quot;right-wing&quot;; Haynes and Klehr argue that &quot;revisionists&quot; categorize all &quot;traditionalists&quot; as conservative to undermine liberal forms of this study, despite the liberal or even left background of many of the founding members of this view on communism, such as Draper and the Cold War liberals. Norman Markowitz, a prominent &quot;revisionist&quot;, referred to traditionalists as &quot;reactionaries&quot;, &quot;right-wing romantics&quot;, and &quot;triumphalist&quot; who belong to the &quot;HUAC school of CPUSA scholarship.&quot; Haynes and Klehr criticize some &quot;revisionists&quot; for characterizing &quot;traditionalists&quot; as &quot;lowercase&quot; ideological &quot;anticommunists&quot; (communism in general) rather than &quot;anti-Communists&quot; (the historically established Communist parties). In their view, &quot;revisionists&quot; such as Joel Kovel imply that &quot;traditionalists&quot; in Communist studies are foremost opposing the establishment of an &quot;ideal&quot; Marxist society, when in practice, traditionalists have criticized the form of &quot;real socialism&quot; that existed in the Soviet system at the time, a form also criticized by many revisionists. Kovel wrote that the &quot;Soviet system while nominally communist was, given its hierarchy, exploitation and lack of democracy, neither communist nor even authentically socialist.&quot; &quot;Revisionists&quot;, characterized by Haynes and Klehr as historical revisionists, are more numerous and dominate academic institutions and learned journals. A suggested alternative formulation is &quot;new historians of American communism&quot;, but that has not caught on because these historians would describe themselves as unbiased and scholarly and contrast their work to the work of anti-communist &quot;traditionalists&quot;, whom they would term biased and unscholarly.

In Communist studies, post-Soviet access to archives, including Eastern Bloc archives and the Venona project&#x27;s decrypts, also bolstered traditionalists&#x27; view on Cold War intelligence that the CPUSA was subsidized by the Soviet Union, and particularly before the 1950s aiding it in espionage, as well as the knowledge that extensive operations were conducted by atomic spies for the Soviet Union. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a United States Senator for the Democratic Party who led the Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy, played a major role in publicizing the Venona evidence. Archives have also shed new light on inter-communist rivalries during the Cold War, such as the &quot;Soviet Chinese spy wars&quot; during the Sino–Soviet split.

== Notable debates ==
=== Totalitarianism, revisionism, and the Holodomor ===

J. Arch Getty&#x27;s &quot;Origins of Great Purges&quot;, a book published in 1985 in which Getty posits that the Soviet political system was not completely controlled from the center and that Stalin only responded to political events as they arose, was a challenge to works by Robert Conquest and part of the debates between the &quot;totalitarian model&quot; and &quot;revisionist school&quot; of the Soviet Union. In an appendix to the book, Getty also questioned the previously published findings that Stalin organized himself the murder of Sergey Kirov to justify his campaign of Great Purge. The &quot;totalitarian model&quot; historians objected to the &quot;revisionist school&quot; of historians such as Getty as apologetics for Stalin and accused them of downplaying the Great Terror. Lenoe responds that &quot;Getty has not denied Stalin&#x27;s ultimate responsibility for the Terror, nor is he an admirer of Stalin.&quot; As the leader of the second generation of the &quot;revisionist school&quot; or &quot;revisionist historians&quot;, Sheila Fitzpatrick was the first to call the group of historians working on Soviet history in the 1980s &quot;a new cohort of [revisionist school] historians.&quot; Most young &quot;revisionist school&quot; historians did not want to separate the social history of the Soviet Union from the evolution of the political system. Fitzpatrick explained in the 1980s, when the &quot;totalitarian model&quot; was still widely used, &quot;it was very useful to show that the model had an inherent bias and it did not explain everything about Soviet society. Now, whereas a new generation of academics considers sometimes as self evident that the totalitarian model was completely erroneous and harmful, it is perhaps more useful to show than there were certain things about the Soviet company that it explained very well.&quot;

Hannah Arendt, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Conquest, and Carl Joachim Friedrich were prominent advocates of applying the totalitarian concept to a comparison of Nazism and Stalinism. It was considered to be outdated by the 1980s and for the post-Stalinist era, and is seen as a useful word, but the old 1950s theory about it is defunct among scholars. Fitzpatrick and Michael Geyer criticize the concept and highlight the differences between Nazism and Stalinism. Henry Rousso defends the work of Friedrich &quot;et al.&quot; while noting the concept is both useful and descriptive rather than analytical, with the conclusion the regimes described as totalitarian do not have a common origin and did not arise in similar ways. Philippe Burrin and Nicholas Werth take a middle position between one making Stalin seem all-powerful and the other making him seem like a weak dictator. Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin take a longer historical perspective and regard Nazism and Stalinism not so much as examples of a new type of society like Arendt, Brzezinski and Friedrich did, but more as historical &quot;anomalies&quot; or unusual deviations from the typical path of development that most industrial societies are expected to follow.

During the debates in the 1980s, the use of &quot;émigré&quot; sources and the insistence on Stalin&#x27;s engineering of Kirov&#x27;s murder became embedded in the two sides&#x27; position. In a review of Conquest&#x27;s work on the Soviet famine of 1932–1933, especially &quot;The Harvest of Sorrow&quot;, Getty writes that Stalin and the Soviet Politburo played a major role, but &quot;there is plenty of blame to go around. It must be shared by the tens of thousands of activists and officials who carried out the policy and by the peasants who chose to slaughter animals, burn fields, and boycott cultivation in protest.&quot; In an analysis of scholarship surrounding the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s, Jeff Coplon says that allegations by &quot;mainstream academics&quot;, including Conquest, of genocide against the Soviet Union were historically dubious and politically motivated as part of a campaign by the Ukrainian nationalist community. In a letter to the editors, Conquest dismissed the article as &quot;error and absurdity.&quot; Michael Ellman states that in the end it all depends on the definition of genocide and that if Stalin was guilty of genocide in the Holodomor, then &quot;[m]any other events of the 1917–53 era (e.g. the deportation of whole nationalities, and the &#x27;national operations&#x27; of 1937–38) would also qualify as genocide, as would the acts of [many Western countries]&quot;, such as the Atlantic slave trade, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s, among many others. Historian Hiroaki Kuromiya finds it persuasive.

As summarized by David R. Marples, Conquest&#x27;s thesis that the famine constituted genocide and was deliberately inflicted is controversial and remains part of the ongoing debates on the Holodomor genocide question. Vladimir N. Brovkin describes it as a challenge to the &quot;revisionist school&quot; of historians, while Alexander Nove states &quot;Conquest seems prone to accept the Ukrainian nationalist myth.&quot; Hiroaki writes that &quot;those who examine the famine from a general Soviet perspective downplay any specific Ukrainian factor, while specialists on Ukraine generally support the concept of a genocidal famine.&quot; The most notable work in the field that maintains the famine was not genocide is by R. W. Davies and Stephen G. Wheatcroft, both of whom cite a letter from Conquest stating &quot;he does not believe that Stalin deliberately inflicted the 1933 famine.&quot;

Sarah Davies and James Harris write that with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the release of the Soviet archives, some of the heat has gone out of the debate. A 1993 study of archival data by Getty &quot;et al.&quot; showed that a total of 1,053,829 people died in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953. Getty and Wheatcroft write that the opening of the Soviet archives has vindicated the lower estimates put forth by the &quot;revisionist school&quot; scholars.

Another major part of the debate involved Soviet nationality policy and Stalin&#x27;s deportations. Historian Jon Chang argued that many self-declared &quot;social historians&quot; generally falling into the revisionist school, relied almost exclusively on archival sources while neglecting oral history, despite social history officially being focused on the lived experiences of the common people. According to Chang, because of this reliance on Soviet archival sources &quot;when it came to the Soviet diaspora peoples and the &#x27;nationalities deportations&#x27; from 1937 to 1950,&quot; some revisionist historians &quot;held that these cases of ethnic cleansing were not racial but ideological in nature, in which both elites and ordinary people could be targeted as &#x27;enemies of the people.&#x27;&quot; This subgroup of revisionists sought to recapitulate a &quot;relatively pure&quot; communism in the Soviet Union and explain all of its policies, such as the nationality operations of the NKVD and deportations of Koreans, as a reflection of Marxism. Eric D. Weitz wrote that, while revisionists on the topic of Soviet deportations &quot;raise the term race, they step around it gingerly and quickly retreat to the safer language of ethnicity and [Soviet] nationality.&quot; He added, &quot;The Soviets explicitly and loudly rejected the ideology of race... Yet at the same time, traces of racial politics crept into Soviet nationalities policies, especially between 1937 and 1953. [...] The particular traits could be the source of praise and power, as with Russians, or could lead to round-ups, forced deportations, and resettlement in horrendous conditions.&quot;

=== Victims of Stalinism ===
According to J. Arch Getty, over half of the 100 million deaths which are commonly attributed to communism were due to famines. Getty writes that the &quot;overwhelming weight of opinion among scholars working in the new archives is that the terrible famine of the 1930s was the result of Stalinist bungling and rigidity rather than some genocidal plan.&quot; As the majority of excess deaths under Joseph Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to the regime.

Stephen G. Wheatcroft posits that &quot;[t]he Stalinist regime was consequently responsible for about a million purposive killings, and through its criminal neglect and irresponsibility it was probably responsible for the premature deaths of about another two million more victims amongst the repressed population, i.e. in the camps, colonies, prisons, exile, in transit and in the POW camps for Germans. These are clearly much lower figures than those for whom Hitler&#x27;s regime was responsible.&quot; Wheatcroft states that Stalin&#x27;s &quot;purposive killings&quot; fit more closely into the category of &quot;execution&quot; than &quot;murder&quot;, given he thought the accused were indeed guilty of crimes against the state and insisted on documentation. Hitler simply wanted to kill Jews and communists because of who they were, insisted on no documentation and was indifferent at even a pretence of legality for these actions.

Michael Ellman says that &quot;the very category &#x27;victims of Stalinism&#x27; is a matter of political judgement.&quot; Ellman says that mass deaths from famines are not a &quot;uniquely Stalinist evil&quot;, and compares the behavior of the Stalinist regime vis-à-vis the Holodomor to that of the British Empire (towards Ireland and India) and the G8 in contemporary times. According to Ellman, the latter &quot;are guilty of mass manslaughter or mass deaths from criminal negligence because of their not taking obvious measures to reduce mass deaths&quot; and a possible defense of Stalin and his associates is that &quot;their behaviour was no worse than that of many rulers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.&quot;

Ellman, Getty, and Wheatcroft in particular, among others, criticized Robert Conquest (Wheatcroft said that Conquest&#x27;s victim totals for Stalinist repressions are still too high, even in his reassessments) and other historians for relying on hearsay and rumour as evidence, and cautioned that historians should instead utilize archive material. During the debates, Ellman distinguished between historians who based their research on archive materials, and those like Conquest whose estimates were based on witnesses evidence and other unreliable data. Wheatcroft stated that historians relied on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to support their estimates of deaths under Stalin in the tens of millions but research in the state archives vindicated the lower estimates, while adding that the popular press has continued to include serious errors that should not be cited, or relied on, in academia.

== Academic journals ==
While this area is now seldom offered as a field of study in itself, in which one might become a specialist, there are related fields emerging, as may be judged by the titles of academic journals, some of which have changed to reflect the passage of time since the fall of communism in the early 1990s and the effects of the end of Soviet rule in Eurasia. These include &quot;Communisme&quot;, &quot;Communist and Post-Communist Studies&quot;, &quot;Demokratizatsiya&quot;, &quot;Eastern European Politics&quot; (previously &quot;Journal of Communist Studies&quot;), &quot;Europe-Asia Studies&quot; (successor of &quot;Soviet Studies&quot;), &quot;Journal of Cold War Studies&quot;, &quot;Journal of Contemporary History&quot;, &quot;Kritika&quot;, &quot;Post-Soviet Affairs&quot;, &quot;Problems of Communism&quot; (renamed &quot;Problems of Post-Communism&quot;), &quot;Slavic Review&quot;, &quot;The Russian Review&quot;, &quot;The Slavonic and East European Review&quot; (succeeded by &quot;Studies in East European Thought&quot;), &quot;Jane&#x27;s Soviet Intelligence Review&quot; (succeeded by &quot;Jane&#x27;s Intelligence Review&quot;), and &quot;Studies in Soviet Thought&quot; (succeeded by &quot;Studies in East European Thought&quot;).

The historiography of strictly communist studies is also changing, with some different models of its aims as well as the major shift caused by access to archives. The access to archives, including post-Soviet archives and the Venona project, also bolstered traditionalist views on Soviet espionage in the United States. Printed journals include &quot;&quot; (&quot;Yearbook for Historical Communist Studies&quot;) and &quot;Slavic Review&quot;. Other serial publications include the &quot;Yearbook on International Communist Affairs&quot; (1966–1991) published by the Hoover Institution Press and Stanford University as well as the &quot;World Strength of the Communist Party Organizations&quot;, an annual report published by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the United States Department of State beginning in 1948.

<doc id="1245855" wikidata="Q4998530" url="?curid=1245855" title="Burger Chef">
<text>Burger Chef was an American fast-food restaurant chain. It began operating in 1954 in Indianapolis, Indiana, expanded throughout the United States, and at its peak in 1973 had 1,050 locations, including some in Canada. The chain featured several signature items, such as the Big Shef and Super Shef hamburgers.

In 1982, the General Foods Corporation, owners of the Burger Chef trademark and name, divested itself of the restaurant chain, gradually selling to the owners of Hardee&#x27;s. The final restaurant to carry the Burger Chef name closed in 1996.

==History==

In 1954, Frank and Donald Thomas patented the flame broiler in their parent company General Equipment Corporation and started their restaurant in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1957, they opened their first Burger Chef.
Burger Chef spread across the United States, following a strategy of opening outlets in smaller towns.

By 1972, its number of locations (1,200) was surpassed only by McDonald&#x27;s (1,600). They offered a double burger, called the Big Shef, and later the quarter-pound (113 gram) hamburger, Super Shef. Subsequently, they added the Works Bar, where customers added their own toppings to hamburgers.

In 1968, General Foods Corporation purchased the chain and continued its rapid expansion. At the time of the purchase by General Foods, Burger Chef had 600 locations in 39 states.

By 1969, international expansion was underway with General Foods building ten Burger Chef outlets in Australia. The expansion ended in 1975 with a US$1.3 million loss (equivalent to $ million in ). It was stated that Australians disliked the limited burger menu compared to varied options available from milk bars. The chain had two mascots: Burger Chef, voiced by Paul Winchell, and Jeff (the chef&#x27;s juvenile sidekick).
In 1972, the chain introduced the Funburger, a hamburger with packaging that included puzzles and a small toy. The following year, the chain introduced the Funmeal, the first kid’s meal that included a burger, french fries, a drink, a cookie, and a small toy; with expanded packaging that included stories about Burger Chef and Jeff&#x27;s adventures and friends (including the magician Burgerini, vampire Count Fangburger, talking ape Burgerilla, and Cackleburger the witch), with riddles and puzzles. When McDonald&#x27;s introduced their Happy Meal in 1979, the chain sued, but ultimately lost.

In 1982, General Foods sold Burger Chef to the Canadian company Imasco, which also owned Hardee&#x27;s, for US$44 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Imasco converted many locations to Hardee&#x27;s restaurants and let franchises and locations near existing Hardee&#x27;s locations convert to other brands. Remaining restaurants that did not convert to Hardee&#x27;s or new names and branding simply closed.

Hardee&#x27;s brought back the Big Shef hamburger for a limited time in 2001, 2007, and 2014 at some Midwestern locations.

===Trademark suit===
In January 2007, River West Brands LLC, of Chicago, Illinois, sued Hardee&#x27;s Food Systems in the US Patents and Trademarks Office, claiming abandonment of the Burger Chef trademark. In 2009, River West Brands dropped its petition for cancellation. Both parties agreed to pay their own attorneys&#x27; fees.

==Slogans==
*1970–1971: &quot;There&#x27;s more to like at Burger Chef.&quot; and &quot;Burger Chef goes all out to please your family.&quot;
*1971–1976: &quot;You get more to like at Burger Chef.&quot;
*1976–1980: &quot;We really give you the works.&quot; and &quot;Open wide America, you never can forget. You get more to like at Burger Chef.&quot;
*1980–1996: &quot;Nowhere else but Burger Chef.&quot;

<doc id="1245859" wikidata="Q411130" url="?curid=1245859" title="Fayalite">
<text>Fayalite (, commonly abbreviated to Fa) is the iron-rich end-member of the olivine solid-solution series. In common with all minerals in the olivine group, fayalite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system (space group &quot;Pbnm&quot;) with cell parameters &quot;a&quot; 4.82 Å, &quot;b&quot; 10.48 Å and &quot;c&quot; 6.09 Å.

Fayalite forms solid solution series with the magnesium olivine endmember forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and also with the manganese rich olivine endmember tephroite (Mn2SiO4).
Iron rich olivine is a relatively common constituent of acidic and alkaline igneous rocks such as volcanic obsidians, rhyolites, trachytes and phonolites and plutonic quartz syenites where it is associated with amphiboles. Its main occurrence is in ultramafic volcanic and plutonic rocks and less commonly in felsic plutonic rocks and rarely in granite pegmatite. It also occurs in lithophysae in obsidian. It also occurs in medium-grade thermally metamorphosed iron-rich sediments and in impure carbonate rocks.

Fayalite is stable with quartz at low pressures, whereas more magnesian olivine is not, because of the reaction olivine + quartz = orthopyroxene. Iron stabilizes the olivine + quartz pair. The pressure and compositional dependence of the reaction can be used to calculate constraints on pressures at which assemblages of olivine + quartz formed.

Fayalite can also react with oxygen to produce magnetite + quartz: the three minerals together make up the &quot;FMQ&quot; oxygen buffer. The reaction is used to control the fugacity of oxygen in laboratory experiments. It can also be used to calculate the fugacity of oxygen recorded by mineral assemblages in metamorphic and igneous processes.
At high pressure, fayalite undergoes a phase transition to ahrensite, the iron-bearing analogue of ringwoodite, i.e., contrary to forsterite there is no intermediate form analogous to wadsleyite; under the conditions prevailing in the upper mantle of the Earth, the transition would occur at ca. 6–7 GPa, i.e., at substantially lower pressure than the phase transitions of forsterite. In high-pressure experiments, the transformation may be delayed, so that it may remain stable to pressures of almost 35 GPa (see fig.), at which point it may become amorphous rather than take on a crystalline structure such as ahrensite.

The name &quot;fayalite&quot; is derived from Faial (Fayal) Island in the Azores where it was first described in 1840.

<doc id="1245860" wikidata="Q7012550" url="?curid=1245860" title="New World Information and Communication Order">
<text>The New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO, also shortened to New World Information Order, NWIO or just, more generally, information order) is a term coined in a debate over media representations of the developing world in UNESCO in the late 1970s early 1980s. The NWICO movement was part of a broader effort to formally tackle global economic inequality that was viewed as a legacy of imperialism upon the global south. 

The term was widely used by the MacBride Commission, a UNESCO panel chaired by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Seán MacBride, which was charged with creation of a set of recommendations to make global media representation more equitable. The MacBride Commission produced a report titled &quot;Many Voices, One World&quot;, which outlined the main philosophical points of the New World Information Communication Order.

==History==
The fundamental issues of imbalances in global communication had been discussed for some time. The American media scholar Wilbur Schramm noted in 1964 that the flow of news among nations is thin, that much attention is given to developed countries and little to less-developing ones, that important events are ignored and reality is distorted. From a more radical perspective, Herbert Schiller observed in 1969 that developing countries had little meaningful input into decisions about radio frequency allocations for satellites at a key meeting in Geneva in 1962. Schiller pointed out that many satellites had military applications. Intelsat which was set up for international co-operation in satellite communication, was also dominated by the United States. 
In 1970, at the 16th Congress of UNESCO, the need for a NWICO was clearly raised for the first time. In the 1970s these and other issues were taken up by the Non-Aligned Movement and debated within the United Nations and its agency responsible for communication, the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). In response to the New International Economic Order (NIEO) of 1974, the expression &quot;New International Information Order&quot; (NIIO) was established to protest the disadvantages countries in the global south faced in relation to information and communication. The Non-Aligned Movement alleged that news agencies in the Western world controlled 95 percent of worldwide information flows, namely Associated Press (AP), Agence France-Presse (AFP), United Press International (UPI), and Reuters. The term &quot;new world information order&quot; was coined by Hedi Nouira, the prime minister of Tunisia, who was the first to use it during a conference in 1974. From 1976 to 1978, the phrase New World Information and Communication Order was generally shortened to New World Information Order or the New International Information Order.

In 1976, for the first time, the slogan of establishing a &quot;New World Information and Communication Order&quot; was clearly proposed. At the start of this discussion, NWICO got associated with the UNESCO starting from the early 1970s.

Mass media concerns began with the meeting of non-aligned nations in Algiers, 1973; again in Tunis 1976, and later in 1976 at the New Delhi Ministerial Conference of Non-Aligned Nations. The &quot;new order&quot; plan was textually formulated by Tunisia&#x27;s Information Minister Mustapha Masmoudi. Masmoudi submitted working paper No. 31 to the MacBride Commission. These proposals of 1978 were titled the &#x27;Mass Media Declaration.&#x27; The MacBride Commission at the time was a 16-member body created by UNESCO to study communication issues.

The UNESCO work on the NWICO was immediately met with criticism from many areas, mainly from Western countries. An interim report released in 1979 by UNESCO was targeted by the American Newspaper Publishers Association and the American Society of Newspaper Editors. While these organizations took issue with some of the early proposals including right of reply and press councils, they also were troubled by the phrase &quot;New World Information and Communication Order&quot;, seeing it as a dog-whistle for the use of government propaganda in the guise of information flow balance. The criticism of UNESCO was sometimes overdrawn, as when &quot;presstime&quot; (the journal of the American Newspapers Publishers Association) carried an article suggesting that a study on U.S.-UNESCO relations commissioned by UNESCO was &quot;a cheap shot against the press&quot; and that &quot;it will add no luster to UNESCO&#x27;s image,&quot; before the book even coming into existence.

In 1980 the MacBride Report was published. The report stated that the right to inform and be informed was critical to modern societies, and that information was a key resource. The report than proposed five main ideas of action to progress these goals

# Include communication as a fundamental right.
# Reduce imbalances in the news structure.
# Strengthen a global strategy for communication while respecting cultural identities and individual rights.
# Promote the creation of national communication policies to be coherent and lasting in the processes of development.
# Explore how the NWICO could be used to benefit a New International Economic Order (NIEO).

Following the release of the report director-general Amadou Mahtar M&#x27;Bow was reelected as the head of UNESCO, and those in favor of the NWICO movement found the report giving them strength. UNESCO received a thirty four percent increase in funding, and the United States agreed in principle to creating a new international body for communication in developing countries &quot;within the framework of UNESCO&quot;. The report itself was controversial, as many viewed it as lending strength to the Communist and nonaligned blocs. M&#x27;Bow backed a compromise resolution that eliminated the more radical proposals of the report, however hard liners resisted these changes. Likewise, the United States warned that they would not provide funds or technical assistance if UNESCO appeared to desire government control of media.

In December 1980 the United Nations formally endorsed the MacBride Report by saying that nations should &quot;take into account&quot; the report in framing of communications policy. The resolution also invited members to promote &quot;the widespread circulation and study&quot; of the report. While not a binding resolution, this move was met with immediate criticism from the British government, saying they did not regard the report as definitive.

In 1983, the 22nd edition of UNESCO established the medium-term plan for the establishment of NWICO from 1985 to 1989. The struggle to establish a new world information order won broad support within the United Nations. Among those involved in the movement were the Latin American Institute for the Study of Transnationals (ILET). One of its co-founders, Juan Somavia was a member of the MacBride Commission. Another important voice was Mustapha Masmoudi, the Information Minister for Tunisia. In a Canadian radio program in 1983, Tom McPhail describes how the issues were pressed within UNESCO in the mid-1970s when the United States withheld funding to punish the organization for excluding Israel from a regional group of UNESCO. Some OPEC countries and a few socialist countries made up the amount of money and were able to get senior positions within UNESCO. NWICO issues were then advanced at an important meeting in 1976 held in Costa Rica.
The only woman member of the commission was Betty Zimmerman, representing Canada because of the illness of Marshall McLuhan, who died in 1980. The movement was kept alive through the 1980s by meetings of the MacBride Round Table on Communication, even though by then the leadership of UNESCO distanced itself from its ideas.

==NWICO failure==
When NWICO appeared to have failed, UNESCO adopted a plan for the medium term, defined as 1990 til 1995, under the title &quot;Communication at the service of humanity&quot; (&quot;La communication au service de l&#x27;humanité&quot;). The plan foresaw the free circulation of information.

The UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions of 2005 puts into effect some of the goals of NWICO, especially with regard to the unbalanced global flow of mass media. However, this convention was not supported by the United States, and it does not appear to be as robust as World Trade Organization agreements that support global trade in mass media and information.

==Issues==
A wide range of issues were raised as part of NWICO discussions. Some of these involved long-standing issues of media coverage of the developing world and unbalanced flows of media influence. But other issues involved new technologies with important military and commercial uses. The developing world was likely to be marginalized by satellite and computer technologies. The issues included:

* News reporting on the developing world that reflects the priorities of news agencies in London, Paris and New York. Reporting of natural disasters and military coups rather than the fundamental realities. At the time four major news agencies controlled over 80% of global news flow.
*The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states &quot;everyone has the right ... to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers&quot;. This was used by supporters to claim the NWICO discussions were, at their core, based upon human rights.
* An unbalanced flow of mass media from the developed world (especially the United States) to the underdeveloped countries. Everyone watches American movies and television shows.
* Advertising agencies in the developed world have indirect but significant effects on mass media in the developing countries. Some observers also judged the messages of these ads to be inappropriate for the Third World.
* An unfair division of the radio spectrum. A small number of developed countries controlled almost 90% of the radio spectrum. Much of this was for military use.
* There were similar concerns about the allocation of the geostationary orbit (parking spots in space) for satellites. At the time only a small number of developed countries had satellites and it was not possible for developing countries to be allocated a space that they might need ten years later. This might mean eventually getting a space that was more difficult and more expensive to operate.
* Satellite broadcasting of television signals into Third World countries without prior permission was widely perceived as a threat to national sovereignty. The UN voted in the early 1970s against such broadcasts.
* Use of satellites to collect information on crops and natural resources in the Third World at a time when most developing countries lacked the capacity to analyze this data.
* At the time most mainframe computers were located in the United States and there were concerns about the location of databases (such as airline reservations) and the difficulty of developing countries catching up with the US lead in computers.
* The protection of journalists from violence was raised as an issue for discussion. For example, journalists were targeted by various military dictatorships in Latin America in the 1970s. As part of NWICO debates there were suggestions for study on how to protect journalists and even to discipline journalists who broke &quot;generally recognized ethical standards&quot;. However, the MacBride Commission specifically came out against the idea of licensing journalists.

==American responses==
The United States government was hostile to NWICO. According to some analysts, the United States saw these issues simply as barriers to the free flow of communication and to the interests of American media corporations. It disagreed with the MacBride report at points where it questioned the role of the private sector in communications. It viewed the NWICO as dangerous to freedom of the press by ultimately putting an organization run by governments at the head of controlling global media, potentially allowing for censorship on a large scale.

While the Carter administration had been responsive to the goals of UNESCO, the Reagan administration took on a different approach. The work of UNESCO was perceived by this administration to limit both individual and press freedoms. Additionally, anti-communist cold war sentiments were gaining increased traction in the United States. The US eventually withdrew its membership in UNESCO at the end of 1984. The matter was complicated by debates within UNESCO about Israel&#x27;s archaeological work in the city of Jerusalem, and about the Apartheid regime in South Africa. The United States rejoined in 2003.
The Independent Media Center (IMC) was established in Seattle, USA, on November 24 of 1999 as a cluster of independent news media and websites. IMC is a new media collective hosted by grassroots organizations generally supportive of the intent of NWICO (while pointing out 1st amendment concerns along the way). Founded by a grass-roots synthesis of anti-Neoliberalists and activists, IMC was considered to be a pioneering effort to gain freedom of the press, and theoretically part of a more democratic &quot;new world information order&quot;.

== Developments ==
The debate on the NWICO that started in the 1970s reflected criticism about non-equitable access to information and media imperialism. The NWICO saw the United Kingdom and the United States back out of UNESCO until 1997 for the UK and 2003 for the US. In 1990–2000, a switch occurred globally, carried by the Internet that contributed to bring more equity to the available content. This was supported by the extension of media powers to developing countries such as Mexico, Korea, Kenya and Nigeria; by the adoption of protectionist measures in regards to the free market by western countries like Canada and France; and with the rise of satellite broadcasting as a transnational means for non-western countries. Still, evidence suggests global media has a strong bias towards the global north. Studies estimate around eighty percent of international news travels through Reuters, Agence France-Press, United Press International, and the Associated Press. Only around twenty percent of this news focuses on developing countries. In the decades following the NWICO debates little changed in this regard as a study on stories relating to Africa in the New York Times and The Washington Post showed in 2000. In this study of 89 articles, all lacked sufficient context linking the West to Africa, and seventy-five of them were negative in content.

=== World Press Freedom Day ===

The 1991 Windhoek Declaration for the Development of a Free, Independent and Pluralistic Press is a statement of press freedom principles by African newspaper journalists. African diplomats in UNESCO, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), and the UN General Assembly commitment were crucial to the success of the Windhoek process. 
UNESCO endorsed the Windhoek Declaration and United Nations General Assembly recognized the 3 May, date of the Declaration, as &quot;World Press Freedom Day&quot;. The Windhoek Declaration has had other significant impacts in the media field. UNESCO adopted the Windhoek framework concerning media development, characterizing it by freedom, pluralism and independence.

The Windhoek Declaration is implemented through the Media Development Indicators (MDIs) framework developed by the International Programme for the Development of Communication Intergovernmental Council in 2006. Resonating with the NWICO, the MDIs help assessing the priority areas for media development that are the promotion of freedom of expression and media pluralism, the development of community media and of human resources.

=== International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) ===

As a result of the &quot;Many Voices, One World&quot; 1980 report UNESCO&#x27;s General Conference launched the International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) the same year in Belgrade. The Programme was adopted by 39 Member States and aimed at strengthening the development of mass media in developing countries. Its mandate since 2003 is &quot;... to contribute to sustainable development, democracy and good governance by fostering universal access to and distribution of information and knowledge by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries and countries in transition in the field of electronic media and the printed press.&quot;

=== World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) ===
In December of 2003 in Geneva and November of 2005, two phases of the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) were held. These gatherings were done to develop a &quot;common vision of the information society&quot; and to overcome the digital divide within the United Nations Millennial Development Goals. This process involved both governmental actors as well as non-governmental organizations and sought to solve many of the issues proposed during the NWICO debate. Critics have noted that WSIS was too narrow minded a process and focused exclusively on an information technology approach.

=== Safety of journalists ===

Threats on journalists are one of the major issues blocking media development. Since 2008, UNESCO Member States submit information on the status of the judicial inquiries conducted on each of the journalists killings condemned by the Organization. This information is included in a public report submitted every two years to the IPDC Council by the Director-General and is basis to the Programme&#x27;s follow-up to killings of journalists.

=== Technological ===

Technological developments have direct effects on access to information and on privacy. Access to information is the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively. According to Guy Berger, &quot;access to digital means of communication, even within the limits established by platform owners, is unprecedented&quot;. Since the NWICO debate, many of the desired developments have come about through access to the internet and mobile phones. Many are now able to seek as well as impart information to the public. The one way information flow from Global North to South has been corrected partially due to this flow of information. The biggest barrier is now lack of access, and as of 2013 only one third of the population has such access (with some of the poorest regions having less than 10% access). 

There has been a significant increase in access to the Internet in recent years, which reached just over three billion users in 2014, amounting to about 42 per cent of the world&#x27;s population. Nevertheless, issues remain such as the digital divide, the gender divide and the security argument. A digital divide is an economic and social inequality with regard to access to, use of, or impact of information and communications technology (ICT).

Social barriers such as literacy and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities between men and women in navigating the tools used for access to information. Also, with the evolution of the digital age, freedom of speech and its corollaries, including freedom of information, and access to information, become more controversial. As new means of communication arise, so too do new restrictions including government control or commercial methods that succeed in turning personal information into a danger.

The increasing access to and reliance on digital media to receive and produce information have increased the possibilities for States and private sector companies to track individuals&#x27; behaviors, opinions and networks. States have increasingly adopted laws and policies to legalize monitoring of communication, justifying these practices with the need to defend their own citizens and national interests. In parts of Europe, new anti-terrorism laws have enabled a greater degree of government surveillance and an increase in the ability of intelligence authorities to access citizens&#x27; data. While legality is a precondition for legitimate limitations of human rights, the issue is also whether a given law is aligned to other criteria for justification such as necessity, proportionality, and legitimate purpose.

<text>Olivia Olson (born May 21, 1992) is an American actress, singer-songwriter, and writer, largely known for her voice roles as Vanessa Doofenshmirtz in &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; and Marceline the Vampire Queen in &quot;Adventure Time&quot;. She also played the character of Joanna in the 2003 film &quot;Love Actually&quot; and its 2017 short sequel &quot;Red Nose Day Actually&quot;.

Along with this, she is also a writer, having written the Boom! Studios graphic novel &quot;Marcy and Simon&quot;, co-authored &quot;Adventure Time: The Enchiridion and Marcy&#x27;s Super-Secret Scrapbook,&quot; and contributed writing to the best-seller &quot;Adventure Time Encyclopedia&quot; for Cartoon Network. In 2023, she began writing for the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; revival.

==Early life==
Olson was adopted at birth and raised in Los Angeles, California. She lives with her father, Martin Olson, mother Kay Olson, and brother Casey Olson. Olson graduated from Agoura High School in 2010. She is of Afro-Jamaican descent through her biological father.

==Career==
Olson has appeared as a singer and actress on television shows and in live theatre, including Comedy Central Stage, the HBO Theater, and The Fake Gallery.

===2003: &quot;Love Actually&quot;===
Olson moved into the mainstream with her role as Joanna Anderson in the 2003 holiday film &quot;Love Actually&quot;, singing the song &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;. Her singing was praised, with director Richard Curtis stating in the commentary in the music section of the &quot;Love Actually&quot; DVD that Olson&#x27;s singing was so perfect, they were afraid the audience would not believe that a ten-year-old could really sing the way she did and would assume she was lip-synching. They had to train her so her singing would sound more believable, and add the sounds of inhalations to the track. This led to guest spots on &quot;The Ellen Show&quot;, &quot;The Tracy Morgan Show&quot; and singing with stars Jack Black and Kristin Chenoweth. Olson also posted original songs on her YouTube account. In 2017, Olson reprised her role as Joanna in &quot;Red Nose Day Actually&quot;, a short film which is a sequel to &quot;Love Actually&quot;.

===2008–2017: &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, and &quot;Beauty Is Chaos&quot;===
From 2008 to 2015, Olson voiced the recurring character Vanessa Doofenshmirtz in the Disney animated series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; along with actor Thomas Sangster (Ferb Fletcher), who played Joanna&#x27;s love interest Sam in &quot;Love Actually&quot;. Olson said that she and Sangster talked &quot;about the whole Ferb-Vanessa situation &#x27;cause it&#x27;s pretty funny.&quot;

In &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, she sings a number of songs, including the duet &quot;Busted!&quot; with Ashley Tisdale as well as popular solo songs, including &quot;I&#x27;m Me&quot;, &quot;Not So Bad a Dad&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun&quot;, &quot;Happy New Year&quot; and many others, including her song in the &quot;Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation&quot; special &quot;Got That Christmas Feeling&quot;. She has written songs for &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; and has written and recorded her own songs with music producers Rick Nowels, Camara Kambon and Hollywood jazz great Rob Mullins, while Olson&#x27;s father wrote &quot;over 200 songs for the series&quot; and various episodes. In 2011, Olson voiced Vanessa in a deleted scene of &quot;Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension&quot;, which included a musical number, but sang a song for the film &quot;I Walk Away&quot;.

Her role as Vanessa led to her role as Marceline the Vampire Queen in &quot;Adventure Time&quot;. During the show&#x27;s production, the show creator, Pendleton Ward, contacted Olson&#x27;s father, Martin Olson, then writing for &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, asking if he knew who played Vanessa in the show. He was not aware, at the time, that Martin was Olson&#x27;s father. She would also voice Marceline in the 2012 video game, &quot;Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why&#x27;d You Steal Our Garbage?!!&quot;.

===2013–2018: &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, and &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;===
In 2010, Olson got the role of Marceline the Vampire Queen on the animated Cartoon Network series &quot;Adventure Time&quot;. Olson said she was impressed by her character&#x27;s fashion design and the costuming for Marceline, saying she occasionally admired the unique designs for the character in episodes. During the audition for the role, Olson first read for Princess Bubblegum, but later read for Marceline. Reportedly when getting into character for the role she often dressed similar to Marceline when she recorded her lines In the show, her father played Hunson Abadeer, the father of Marceline. In the series, Olson also sings Marceline&#x27;s songs, which were written by storyboard artists, or other people affiliated with production. As such, &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised Marceline as a character, noting in particular that &quot;she&#x27;s ... responsible for some of the show&#x27;s best songs.&quot;

The series was a commercial and popular success and her character attracted positive critical attention from critics, and fans alike, along with the production crew of &quot;Adventure Time&quot;. This popularity was even recognized by the company that owns &quot;Adventure Time&quot; with the official press release for the &quot;Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens&quot; companion comic book referring to Marceline as a &quot;fan-favorite&quot;. Olson later said she was &quot;honored&quot; to be voicing a character in a show pushing the limits, including on &quot;what a female character in a TV series brings to the table.&quot;

In the &quot;Adventure Time&quot; mini-series &quot;Stakes&quot;, Olson performs the popular song &quot;Everything Stays&quot;, which was revealed by Olson and Rebecca Sugar at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con. In 2015 Olivia and her father, Martin Olson, co-authored a book adapted from the series Adventure Time, &quot;Adventure Time: The Enchiridion &amp; Marcy&#x27;s Super Secret Scrapbook&quot;. Olivia wrote her section in first person as her character Marceline. The book was illustrated by artists including Mahendra Singh, Tony Millionaire, Renee French, Celeste Moreno and Sean Tejaratchi.

Olson also performed the song &quot;Haven&#x27;t You Noticed (I&#x27;m a Star)&quot;, which was featured on the September 17, 2015, episode of &quot;Steven Universe&quot; entitled &quot;Sadie&#x27;s Song&quot;. It was later featured in the &quot;Steven Universe&quot; mini-episode &quot;Gem Karaoke&quot;, released on October 3, 2016. She appears at Comic-Cons and pop conventions around the world as do other Adventure Time cast members.

Olson frequently posts original music on her YouTube and TikTok account. On July 18, 2013, Olson released her debut EP &quot;Beauty Is Chaos&quot;. By December 2015, she had over 19,000 followers on her YouTube channel.

From 2016 to 2019, Olivia voiced the fourth Powerpuff Girl Bliss on Cartoon Network&#x27;s reboot of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, The character&#x27;s initial announcement was met with negative reactions from some fans, but when rumors began to spread that the character would be black, fans began to express a more optimistic tone. Reviewers later called the character a great step forward in terms of racial diversity and a good addition. Reactions to the character were mainly positive, while others argued she was a stereotype and that the inclusion of the character seemed like tokenism.

In 2019, Olson voiced Jun and PizzaRave in &quot;Fast &amp; Furious: Spy Racers&quot;. In 2020, she voiced Vanessa Doofenshmirtz in the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; film, &quot;Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe&quot;, and Marceline in the &quot;Obsidian&quot; episode of &quot;Adventure Time: Distant Lands&quot;. In the film, Olson sang the song &quot;The Universe Is Against Me&quot; with Ashley Tisdale, who voiced Candace, and Laura Dickinson while in &quot;Obsidian&quot;, she sang &quot;Woke Up&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot; with other performers.

===2018–present: &quot;Nowhere Land&quot; and &quot;The X Factor&quot;===
On June 22, 2018, Olson released the album &quot;Nowhere Land&quot;. She worked with K-pop producers Kairos Music Group and producer/singer/songwriter John Defeo on the project. In October 2019, she began competing in &quot;The X Factor: Celebrity&quot;, being the second act to be evicted from the live shows on October 26, 2019. In 2023, it was revealed that she would be a writer for the Phineas and Ferb revival, in addition to reprising her role as Vanessa.

Olson reprised her role as Marceline the Vampire Queen in the 2023 &quot;Adventure Time&quot; spin-off series &quot;Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake&quot;.

<doc id="1245870" wikidata="Q6090671" url="?curid=1245870" title="It's Pat">
<text>It&#x27;s Pat is a 1994 American slapstick comedy film directed by Adam Bernstein and starring Julia Sweeney, Dave Foley, Charles Rocket, and Kathy Griffin. The film was based on the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) character Pat, created by Sweeney, an androgynous misfit whose gender is never revealed. Dave Foley plays Pat&#x27;s partner Chris, and Charles Rocket, another &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus, plays Pat&#x27;s neighbor Kyle.

The film was released in only 33 theatres in three cities in the United States. &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; was universally panned by critics, and bombed at the box office, only grossing $60,822 against its $8 million budget.

==Plot==
Pat Riley is a chubby, whiny, and obnoxious job-hopper of indeterminate gender who is searching for a steady foundation in life. Pat falls in love with Chris (whose gender is also unrevealed to the audience) and the two get engaged. Meanwhile, Pat&#x27;s neighbor Kyle develops an unhealthy obsession with identifying Pat&#x27;s gender, and begins stalking them. He sends a tape of Pat performing karaoke to a TV show called &quot;America&#x27;s Creepiest People&quot;, bringing them to the attention of the band Ween, who feature Pat in one of their performances, playing the sousaphone. When Pat learns that Ween intended to only use them for one gig, Pat and Chris break up.

Kyle steals Pat&#x27;s laptop containing their diary and tries to coerce them into revealing the computer&#x27;s password, so he can access the files. When Pat only answers that it&#x27;s a word in the dictionary, Kyle begins manually trying every word in a dictionary. He eventually succeeds with the password &quot;zythum&quot; (an Egyptian malt beer), and reads the diary, but does not find the answer to his question, and finally snaps.

Meanwhile, a gang of thugs with the same goal begin harassing Pat, who becomes distraught over the thugs&#x27; use of the term &quot;androgynous&quot;. Pat complains to Kathy, a friend who is a therapist and host of a radio talk show. When Pat gives acerbic reactions to call-in listeners, the station fires Kathy and replaces her with Pat.

Kyle calls into Pat&#x27;s radio show saying he has Pat&#x27;s laptop, and sets up a meeting at the Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! Museum to retrieve it. Pat arrives to find Kyle dressed exactly like them. Kyle demands that Pat strip naked, but Pat runs off into a Ween concert. After Kyle corners them on a catwalk, Pat falls. Their pants get torn off by a hook and they are lowered with their genitalia exposed to the cheering concert audience, but not to Kyle nor the viewer. Kyle is subsequently taken away by security guards. Pat then runs to see Chris, just as Chris is leaving on an ocean liner. In an epilogue, Pat and Chris marry.

During the end credits, Kathy is now hosting her radio show again and the first caller is Kyle, whose obsession with Pat has driven him to cross-dressing.

==Production==
In January 1993, it was announced 20th Century Fox was developing &quot;The Pat Movie&quot; based on the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; character &quot;Pat&quot; starring Julia Sweeney. In order to make the movie, Fox had to negotiate the rights of the character from NBC (though Sweeney herself possessed certain rights regarding the character). &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; producer Lorne Michaels had no involvement with the film which was produced by Charles B. Wessler. After six months worth of work which included a script with input from Quentin Tarantino that involved Pat being pursued by a relentless suitor, Fox grew frustrated with the lack of a workable script and put the film into Turnaround. Following Fox dropping the film, it was reported both Disney and New Line Cinema had begun bidding on the project. Disney eventually won the rights and produced the film through their Touchstone Pictures label with filming taking place in Los Angeles in August.

The film was written by Sweeney, Jim Emerson (Sweeney&#x27;s friend from their days with The Groundlings), and Sweeney&#x27;s former husband Stephen Hibbert. While at the Groundlings, Emerson suggested that the character Pat, at the time a &quot;character based on annoying co-workers who don&#x27;t leave you alone&quot;, be made androgynous.

Three months before the film&#x27;s release, Sweeney commented on her initial reluctance to do a film based on Pat:

:I resisted it completely. I just didn&#x27;t know how we could make it last for two hours. But 20th Century Fox was really keen; our producer was really keen. So we thought, OK, we&#x27;ll write the script. And after three months, we fell madly in love with the script. Unfortunately, Fox did not.

==Release==
The film was given a limited regional theatrical release between August 19-26 1994 in the areas of Seattle, Spokane, and Houston before its release on home video on March 28, 1995

==Reception==
&quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; has a rare 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 11 reviews.

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine called the film &quot;shockingly unfunny&quot;, noting that Sweeney had &quot;perversely turned the relatively harmless TV character into a boorish, egotistical creep for the bigscreen&quot;, the film&#x27;s &quot;only really funny bit is &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; author Camille Paglia, deftly parodying herself, commenting on the significance of Pat&#x27;s androgyny&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; offers a simple message of self-acceptance, asserting that what counts is who you are rather than what your gender may or may not be. The trouble is that its telling is truly terrible.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; called it &quot;yet another tepid film comedy based on a recurring &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch&quot;. They conclude &quot;the story goes nowhere, and if the film ran longer than its 80 minutes, it would have become too tedious to tolerate&quot;.

The film opened in only three cities (33 theaters). Its total gross was $60,822. As a result, the film was pulled from theaters after its opening weekend.

===Accolades===
 &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; was a multiple third place nominee at the 16th Golden Raspberry Awards, though the film&#x27;s cast and crew lost in every category to &quot;Showgirls&quot;: 
* Worst Actress - Julia Sweeney
* Worst New Star - Julia Sweeney
* Worst Picture - Charles B. Wessler
* Worst Screen Couple - Dave Foley and Julia Sweeney
* Worst Screenplay - Jim Emerson, Stephen Hibbert, and Julia Sweeney

At the 1995 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Picture but lost to &quot;Showgirls&quot;. However, Julia Sweeney did win Worst Actress for this film. Later, the Stinkers released their user-constructed &quot;100 Years, 100 Stinkers&quot; list in which visitors determined the 100 worst movies of the 20th century. &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; ranked in the bottom 20 at #7.

<text>Operational Group (, GO) was the highest level type of tactical division of the Polish Army at various points in the 20th century, mainly during the Second World War.

==Polish-Bolshevik War (1919-1921)==
Operational groups first appeared in the Polish tactical scheme during the Polish-Bolshevik War, most probably under the influence of French Military Mission to Poland. After the war they were dissolved.

==Annexation of Trans-Olza (1938)==
In the autumn of 1938, the Independent Operational Group Silesia was created with the purpose of capturing Trans-Olza from Czechoslovakia.

==World War II (1939-1945)==
Prior to World War II, operational groups were recreated on a larger scale. Initially, in March 1939, Operational Groups consisted only of staffs formed around existing corps commands. Some groups were formed during the final mobilization of late August 1939, while others were formed during the war as strategic considerations necessitated. Most were attached to armies, several however were independent. According to the Polish mobilization scheme, they were to become mobile reserves of the Polish armies and other major strategic-scale units. One such group, the Kutno Operational Group, was planned but never created

Independent Operational Groups:
* Independent Operational Group &quot;Polesie&quot; (&quot;Samodzielna Grupa Operacyjna Polesie&quot;) under gen. Franciszek Kleeberg. Created around September 9th-11th.
* Independent Operational Group &quot;Narew&quot; (&quot;Samodzielna Grupa Operacyjna Narew&quot;) under gen. Czesław Młot-Fijałkowski. Created on March 23
* Operational Group &quot;Wyszków&quot; (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Wyszków&quot;) under gen. Wincenty Kowalski. Created on September 1.
* Operational Group &quot;Grodno&quot; (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Grodno&quot;) under gen. Józef Olszyna-Wilczyński. Created in early September; disbanded on September 10 before the battle of Grodno begun; most units moved towards Lwów.

Cavalry Operational Groups:
* Cavalry Operational Group Abraham (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Kawalerii Abraham&quot;) under Roman Abraham
* Cavalry Operational Group Anders (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Kawalerii Anders&quot;) under gen. Władysław Anders
* Cavalry Operational Group No.1 (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Kawalerii Nr 1&quot;)
* Cavalry Operational Group No.2 (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Kawalerii Nr 2&quot;)

Operational Groups formed as parts of armies:
* Operational Group &quot;Bielsko&quot;&quot; (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Bielsko&quot;) under gen. Mieczysław Boruta-Spiechowicz (on September 3 renamed to Operational Group &quot;Boruta&quot;) (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Boruta&quot;)
* Operational Group &quot;Czersk&quot; (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Czersk&quot;) under gen. Stanisław Grzmot-Skotnicki
* Operational Group &quot;Koło&quot; (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Koło&quot;) under gen. Edmund Knoll-Kownacki (on September 6 renamed to Operational Group &quot;Knoll-Kownacki&quot;) (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Knoll-Kownacki&quot;)
* Operational Group &quot;Piotrków&quot; (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Piotrków&quot;) under gen. Wiktor Thommée (on September 6 renamed to Operational Group &quot;Thommée&quot;) (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Thommée&quot;)
* Southern Operational Group (&quot;Południowa Grupa Operacyjna&quot;) under gen. Stanisław Skwarczyński
* Northern Operational Group (&quot;Pólnocna Grupa Operacyjna&quot;) under gen. Jan Kruszewski
* Operational Group &quot;Sieradz&quot; (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Sieradz&quot;) under gen. Franciszek Dindorf-Ankowicz
* Operational Group &quot;Śląsk&quot; (&quot;Samodzielna Grupa Operacyjna Śląsk&quot;) under gen. Jan Jagmin-Sadowski (on September 3 renamed to Operational Group &quot;Jagmin&quot; (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Jagmin&quot;))
* Eastern Operational Group (&quot;Wschodnia Grupa Operacyjna&quot;) under gen. Mikołaj Bołtuć (on September 9 renamed to Operational Group &quot;Bołtuć&quot;) (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Bołtuć&quot;)

In addition, during the invasion of Poland in 1939, several other corps-sized units were formed or improvised. All of them were named after their commanding officers:
# Operational Group Dreszer (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Dreszer&quot;) under Rudolf Dreszer
# Operational Group Orlik-Łukoski (&quot;Grupa Operacyjn Orlik-Łukoski&quot;) under Kazimierz Orlik-Łukoski
# Operational Group Grzmot-Skotnicki (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Grzmot-Skotnicki&quot;) under Stanisław Grzmot-Skotnicki
# Operational Group Kareszewicz-Tokarzewski (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski&quot;) under Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski
# Operational Group Zaulauf under (&quot;Grupa Operacyjna Zulauf&quot;) Juliusz Zulauf

==Post-World War II (1946-1947)==
There were also several operational groups created by the Polish People&#x27;s Army (&quot;Ludowe Wojsko Polskie&quot;) after the war in the years 1946-1947.

<text>In folk music a tune-family is, &quot;a seeming multiplicity of melodies,&quot; reducible, &quot;to a small number of &#x27;models&#x27; or sets.&quot; One can think of the models or sets as deep structures. Often, &quot;different tunes are the same,&quot; and, &quot;the same tune is different.&quot;

Idiolectical (individual) or dialectical (based on context or on locale) variations may exist. Different families may also arise from the use of stock structures or of formulae such as stock phrases and motifs.

<text>Southampton Test is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament by Satvir Kaur, a member of the Labour Party since 2024.

==History==
The constituency was created for the 1950 general election, when the previous two-member Southampton constituency was abolished. The boundaries of the seat have changed at most of the Boundary Commissions&#x27; periodic reviews.

Horace King, the MP between 1950 and 1955, before switching to the neighbouring seat of Southampton Itchen, would later become the first Speaker of the House of Commons from the Labour Party. The seat was contested unsuccessfully in 1955 and 1959 respectively by Anthony Crosland and Shirley Williams, who would both later be elected for other seats and become prominent ministers in the Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s.

Southampton Test proved to be a bellwether (mirroring the national result) from 1966 until 2010, with the exception of the minority government of Harold Wilson from February to October 1974 .

In the 2010 general election, Alan Whitehead for Labour performed better here than John Denham in Southampton Itchen, the other Southampton seat, which the party also held more narrowly that year. The area from 2010 to 2015 was one of four Labour seats in South East England and from 2017 to 2019 among two of eighteen in Hampshire won by Labour candidates. Whitehead was re-elected in 2017 with a majority of over 10,000 votes, and in 2019 over 6,000, making Southampton Test a relatively comfortable Labour seat. Whitehead did not stand at the 2024 general election; he was succeeded by fellow Labour Party member, Satvir Kaur, with a majority of over 9,000.

==Constituency profile==
The seat covers the western part of the City of Southampton and is named after the River Test, one of the city&#x27;s two rivers. It covers some of the leafy northern suburbs (though the northernmost Bassett Ward ceased to form part of the constituency in 1997) and the western port areas as well as the social housing estates of the western fringes. It is traditionally the marginally more affluent of the two constituencies in the city, before 2010 having a higher number of Tory representatives than its neighbour Southampton Itchen – named after the other major river. The area includes the University of Southampton, though its halls of residence fall almost entirely within Romsey and Southampton North or Southampton Itchen.

The seat is home to Southampton&#x27;s football ground at St Mary&#x27;s.

== Boundaries ==

=== Historic ===
1950–1955: The County Borough of Southampton wards of All Saints, Banister, Freemantle, Millbrook, St Nicholas, Shirley, and Town; and the (civil) Parish of Millbrook (which was then in the Romsey and Stockbridge Rural District).

1997–2010: The City of Southampton wards of Coxford, Freemantle, Millbrook, Portswood, Redbridge, St Luke&#x27;s, and Shirley.

2010–2023 The City of Southampton wards of Bevois, Coxford, Freemantle, Millbrook, Portswood, Redbridge, and Shirley.

=== Current ===
Following a review of local authority ward boundaries, which became effective in May 2023, the constituency now comprises the following:

* The City of Southampton wards of: Banister &amp; Polygon (majority); Bevois; Coxford; Freemantle; Millbrook; Portswood; Redbridge; Shirley; Swaythling (small part).
The 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, which was based on the ward structure in place at 1 December 2020, left the boundaries unchanged.

The constituency is bounded to the east by Southampton Itchen, to the north by Romsey and Southampton North and to the west by New Forest East.

<doc id="1245892" wikidata="Q558087" url="?curid=1245892" title="Ann Arbor Railroad (1895–1976)">
<text>The Ann Arbor Railroad was an American railroad that operated between Toledo, Ohio, and Elberta and Frankfort, Michigan (about 294 route miles) with train ferry operations across Lake Michigan. In 1967 it reported 572 million net ton-miles of revenue freight, including 107 million in &quot;lake transfer service&quot;; that total does not include the 39-mile subsidiary Manistique and Lake Superior Railroad.

The company&#x27;s main line is partially abandoned with ownership split between the state of Michigan, the Huron and Eastern Railway, and the shortline Ann Arbor Railroad (founded in 1988).

==History==
The railroad company was chartered September 21, 1895, as successor to the Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railway. In 1905, it was acquired by the Detroit, Toledo &amp; Ironton Railway (DTI) and Eugene Zimmerman assumed presidency of both lines. DTI went bankrupt three years later. Zimmerman remained president until 1909 when he lost control of the line to Joseph Ramsey Jr. and Newman Erb. Ramsey assumed the presidency, serving until 1913 when Erb became president and ran the line for the next eleven years. Erb also served as president of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway 1912 to 1916. Wabash Railroad gained control of Ann Arbor Railroad in 1925.

The company ended its last passenger train, a once a day train in each direction train from the AA&#x27;s Toledo station to its Elberta boat landing, on July 19, 1950. Major stops on the route besides the end points included Ann Arbor, Durand, Owosso, Mt. Pleasant and Cadillac. The passenger side was hampered by the limited number of noteworthy cities en route and the fact that all but the Durand Union Station were in cities in which trains for connecting points were at different stations from the AA station, thus necessitating use of surface transportation for transfer between train stations.

For many years the Ann Arbor was owned by the Wabash Railroad, but Wabash gave up control in 1963 as part of its absorption into the Norfolk and Western. The DT&amp;I, by then itself owned by the giant Pennsylvania Railroad, again gained control in 1963. The combined DT&amp;I and AA were operated as independent subsidiaries of the PRR but suffered from the parent company&#x27;s ill-fated 1968 merger with the New York Central. Upon the resulting Penn Central&#x27;s 1970 bankruptcy, the DT&amp;I and its Ann Arbor subsidiary were sold off to private investors.

The Ann Arbor Railroad owned a subsidiary, the Manistique and Lake Superior Railroad (M&amp;LS), from somewhere shortly after that line&#x27;s origin in 1909 until it was abandoned in 1968.

After itself going bankrupt in 1973 the Ann Arbor ceased operations as a railroad on April 1, 1976. The State of Michigan bought most of the line, subsidizing Conrail as a designated operator. The contract was transferred to the Michigan Interstate Railway on October 1, 1977. Michigan Interstate operated the line as the &quot;Ann Arbor Railroad System.&quot; In 1982, the state split the operating contract among Michigan Interstate from Toledo to Ann Arbor, Tuscola &amp; Saginaw Bay Railway from Ann Arbor to Alma, and Michigan Northern Railway from Alma to Elberta. In 1984 the state ended Michigan Northern&#x27;s contract and designated Tuscola &amp; Saginaw Bay as the operator on that portion.

On October 7, 1988, a new Ann Arbor Railroad began operating the portion south of Ann Arbor; the Great Lakes Central Railroad now serves the remaining portions of the line. Some sections have been abandoned: from Yuma to Elberta and Frankfort (approximately 45 miles), about 10 miles in Shiawassee County, Michigan (in three discontinuous sections), and the trackage around the now-demolished Cherry Street Station in Toledo.

==Train ferries==
The Ann Arbor&#x27;s Lake Michigan train ferry fleet at Elberta started in November 1892 when the Toledo, Ann Arbor and Northern Michigan Railway acquired its first two boats, &quot;Ann Arbor 1&quot; and &quot;Ann Arbor 2&quot;. At its height, the AA served four ports on the west of Lake Michigan:
*Kewaunee, Wisconsin, from 1892 connecting with Kewaunee, Green Bay and Western Railroad,
*Menominee, Michigan, from 1894 connecting with Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, Chicago and North Western Railway, and Wisconsin and Michigan Railroad
*Gladstone, Michigan in Michigan Upper Peninsula, from 1895 connecting with the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad. Later moved to Manistique, Michigan, connecting with Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway via AA subsidiary Manistique and Lake Superior Railroad
*Manitowoc, Wisconsin, from 1896 connecting with Chicago and North Western Railway, and Wisconsin Central Railway

===Fleet===
Altogether, eight boats were built for service with the AA and one was leased from the Grand Trunk Milwaukee Car Ferry Company.

<doc id="1245893" wikidata="Q829138" url="?curid=1245893" title="TV on the Radio">
<text>TV on the Radio (TVOTR) is an American rock band from Brooklyn, New York, formed in 2001. The band consists of Tunde Adebimpe (vocals, loops), Dave Sitek (guitars, keyboards, loops), Kyp Malone (vocals, guitars, bass, loops), and Jaleel Bunton (drums, bass, vocals, loops, guitars). Gerard Smith (bass, keyboards, loops) was a member of the band from 2005 until his death in 2011.

TVOTR has released five studio albums: &quot;Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes&quot; (2004), &quot;Return to Cookie Mountain&quot; (2006), &quot;Dear Science&quot; (2008), &quot;Nine Types of Light&quot; (2011), and &quot;Seeds&quot; (2014), alongside several EPs.

==History==
===2001–2005: Formation, &quot;Young Liars&quot;, and &quot;Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes&quot;===
The first release from TV on the Radio (initially just founding members Adebimpe and Sitek) was the self-released &quot;OK Calculator&quot; (the title being a reference to Radiohead&#x27;s album &quot;OK Computer&quot;.) They were later joined by Kyp Malone and released the &quot;Young Liars&quot; EP in 2003. This was followed by the full-length &quot;Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes&quot;, which earned the band the 2004 Shortlist Music Prize. They released a second EP, &quot;New Health Rock&quot;, later that year.

===2006–2007: &quot;Return to Cookie Mountain&quot;===
The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Return to Cookie Mountain&quot;, leaked in early 2006 and garnered pre-release praise from &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; before its official release in July. The record was released in the US and Canada in September by Interscope. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine named &quot;Return to Cookie Mountain&quot; its Album of the Year for 2006. The record features guest appearances by David Bowie, Omega Moon, Celebration, Dragons of Zynth, Martin Perna and Stuart D. Bogie of Antibalas, Blonde Redhead, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs&#x27; Nick Zinner. Bowie contributed back-up vocals on the song &quot;Province&quot;. In promotion of the album, the band performed &quot;Wolf Like Me&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, which has garnered over two million views on YouTube. During the US tour, TVOTR performed a few covers with Bauhaus vocalist, Peter Murphy, and Nine Inch Nails frontman, Trent Reznor.

===2008–2010: &quot;Dear Science&quot;===
The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Dear Science&quot;, was released on September 23, 2008. It was made available for streaming on their Myspace page and subsequently leaked onto the internet on September 6, 2008. The album was named the best album of 2008 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;,
&quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, MTV, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot;″s readers&#x27; poll, as well as the Pazz and Jop critic&#x27;s poll. It was also named the second best album of 2008 by &quot;NME&quot; and the fourth best by Planet Sound.

On September 22, 2008, TV on the Radio performed &quot;Dancing Choose&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. They also appeared on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; on September 30, 2008, performing &quot;Golden Age&quot; and &quot;Dancing Choose&quot;, which were the same songs they performed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on February 7, 2009. The band performed &quot;Dancing Choose&quot; again on the February 9, 2009, episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;.

On September 3, 2009, Tunde Adebimpe announced that TV on the Radio would be taking a year-long hiatus. Guitarist Kyp Malone&#x27;s solo album, under the name Rain Machine, was released on September 22, 2009, on ANTI-. A solo album by Dave Sitek, &quot;Maximum Balloon&quot;, was released August 24, 2010, and featured a variety of guest vocals by many of his musician friends, such as Karen O, David Byrne, and both of his TVOTR vocalist bandmates. In addition, Sitek produced Holly Miranda&#x27;s album &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Private Library&quot;, which also featured fellow TVOTR members Jaleel Bunton and Kyp Malone.

In March 2010, Tunde Adebimpe designed a charity t-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for Haiti Relief via Partners in Health.

===2011–2013: &quot;Nine Types of Light&quot; and death of Gerard Smith===
On February 7, 2011, the band announced an end to their hiatus, along with an upcoming fourth album.

&quot;Nine Types of Light&quot; was released on April 12, 2011, along with a one-hour film under the same name, containing music videos for all the songs on the album, as well as interviews with various New Yorkers. The film was directed by different directors under Adebimpe&#x27;s supervision.

It was announced in March 2011 that the band&#x27;s bassist, Gerard Smith, was diagnosed with lung cancer. On April 20, 2011, the band announced Smith&#x27;s death on their homepage: &quot;We are very sad to announce the death of our beloved friend and bandmate, Gerard Smith, following a courageous fight against lung cancer. Gerard passed away the morning of April 20th, 2011. We will miss him terribly.&quot;

In May 2013, TVOTR headlined and curated the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival, held at Pontins holiday camp in Camber Sands, England, at which they debuted the new song &quot;Mercy&quot;. They began streaming the studio version of &quot;Mercy&quot; online on July 30, 2013, and released the song for sale at digital music outlets a short time later. They also made the multitracks from &quot;Mercy&quot; available to fans so they could make their own remixes. The next single, &quot;Million Miles&quot;, was released digitally a few months later.

===2013–2024: &quot;Seeds&quot; and hiatus===
On November 8, 2013, via their Facebook page, the band announced they were at work on a new album. They made an official announcement on July 29, 2014, that this new album, titled &quot;Seeds&quot;, was scheduled for a late 2014 release.

In early 2015, it was announced that TVOTR would perform at the Shaky Knees and Boston Calling Music Festivals in May. On April 9, 2015, the band announced a 2015 North American summer tour to promote the new record. The tour began in May and included a concert at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre on July 27.

===2024–present: Return to touring===
In September 2024, the band announced that they would be performing their first shows in five years and re-issuing their debut album for its twentieth anniversary, with ten performances announced for November and December 2024. Dave Sitek did not join TVOTR on these tour dates, though he remains a member of the band. Adebimpe noted: &quot;He&#x27;s just not touring. Everyone does what&#x27;s healthiest for them at this point.&quot;

==Style and influences==
TV on the Radio has said that their eclectic music is due to their appreciation for diverse bands, including Bad Brains, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Nancy Sinatra, Serge Gainsbourg, Brian Eno, and Pixies. Adebimpe covered the Pixies song &quot;Mr. Grieves&quot; under the TVOTR moniker at the beginning of his career, layering his voice over forty times. The band has also cited Prince&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot; as a classic. TV on the Radio have also named post-punk acts Wire and Siouxsie and the Banshees as influences.

<doc id="1245901" wikidata="Q3506484" url="?curid=1245901" title="Pinus culminicola">
<text>Pinus culminicola, commonly known as Potosí pinyon or Potosí Piñón, is a pine in the pinyon pine group, native and endemic to northeast Mexico. The range is highly localised, confined to a small area of high summits in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in Coahuila and Nuevo León, and only abundant on the highest peak, Cerro Potosí (3713 m). It occurs at very high altitudes, from 3000–3700 m, in cool, moist subalpine climate conditions.

==Description==
It is a medium-size shrub, reaching 1.5–5 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 25 cm. The bark is grey-brown, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in fascicles of five, slender, 3–5.5 cm long, and deep green to blue-green, with stomata confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces.

The cones are globose, 3–4 cm long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 16–18 months old, with only a small number of thin, fragile scales, typically 6–14 fertile scales. The cones open to 4–6 cm broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds are 9–12 mm long, with a thick shell, a white endosperm, and a vestigial 1–2 mm wing; they are dispersed by the Clark&#x27;s nutcracker and Mexican jay, which pluck the seeds out of the open cones. The jays, which uses the seeds as a major food resource, store many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new plants.

==History==
Because of its isolation on a handful of remote mountain summits, Potosí pinyon escaped discovery until 1959. It differs from most other pinyon species in needle number, with 5 per fascicle, rather than 1–4, and in its consistently shrubby stature. It is most closely related to Johann&#x27;s pinyon and Orizaba pinyon, like them having the leaf stomata confined to the inner faces; it also differs from the latter in its smaller cones and seeds. Like these two, the white-glaucous inner surfaces of the needles make it a very attractive slow-growing shrub, suitable for small gardens.

Like other pinyons, the pine nut seeds are edible, but the inaccessibility of the plants prevents significant collection for food.

<text>Georgy Mikhailovich Beriev (Beriashvili) ( &quot;Georgij Michajlovič Beriev&quot;; Georgian: გიორგი მიხეილის ძე ბერიაშვილი &quot;Giorgi Mikheilis Dze Beriashvili&quot;; 13 February 1903 – 12 July 1979), was a Soviet Georgian major general, founder and chief designer of the Beriev Design Bureau in Taganrog, which concentrated on amphibious aircraft.

==Biography==
Beriev was born in Tbilisi in the Tiflis Governorate (present day Tbilisi, Georgia) of the Russian Empire. Of ethnic Georgian origin, his antecedents are uncertain, and it is not known when his family name was Russified from Beriashvili to Beriev. After graduating from the railway school in Tbilisi in 1923, he attended the School of Shipbuilding Engineering at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute (now Saint Petersburg State Polytechnic University), and graduated with an engineering degree in 1930. He worked as an aircraft designer at the Central Design Office &quot;WR Menzhinsky&quot;, where he developed the Beriev MBR-2 seaplane. From October 1934 to 1968, he ran the Central Design Office for marine aircraft in Taganrog, where he developed numerous successful, and often unique, amphibious aircraft designs.

In 1947, he was awarded the Stalin Prize for his work on the Be-6. He was also twice awarded the Order of Lenin and twice the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. In 1968, for the Be-12 (1968) design, he was awarded the USSR State Prize.

After retirement, he moved to Moscow and died in 1979.

<text>Goodwin Procter LLP is an American multinational law firm. It is one of the largest law firms in the world as measured by revenue and consists of more than 1,800 lawyers across offices in Boston, Cambridge, Frankfurt, Munich, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, Luxembourg, New York City, Paris, Philadelphia, Santa Monica, Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Singapore, and Washington, D.C. Goodwin focuses on complex transactional work, high-stakes litigation and advisory services in matters involving financial institutions, intellectual property, private equity, real estate capital markets, securities litigation, white collar defense, technology and life sciences.

Goodwin currently has over 2,800 employees worldwide, representing a nearly 30% increase in lawyers and staff since January 2021, and more than a 60% increase overall since 2017. This growth has been mirrored by the firm&#x27;s rising revenues, which increased from $1.33 billion in 2019 to $1.49 billion in 2020, and reaching $1.97 billion in 2021. Between 2010 and 2021, Goodwin&#x27;s annual revenue nearly tripled.

==History==

In 1912, lawyers and former Harvard classmates Robert Eliot Goodwin and Joseph Osborne Procter, Jr. ran into each other on the street and decided to start their own law firm, Goodwin &amp; Procter, which opened its offices on July 1 that year at 84 State Street in Boston. That winter, Robert Goodwin and Amos Taylor represented Mary Newell against the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company for the sum of $110,400 resulting from the April 15, 1912 sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. Another case taken on in the firm&#x27;s early days stemmed from the infamous pyramid scheme orchestrated in Boston by Charles Ponzi. After the scheme was exposed as fraud, Robert Goodwin served as the bankruptcy referee for Middlesex County amid thousands of recovery claims in the bankruptcy courts. When the United States joined the allied cause in World War I in 1917, Robert Goodwin joined the country&#x27;s vanguard deployment in France, eventually rising to the rank of colonel and assuming command of the 101st Field Artillery. After the campaign, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Not long after, Samuel Hoar V, a litigator, was hired, followed by Fred Tarbell Field, a well-respected tax lawyer who was a friend of Procter&#x27;s, and the firm became known as Goodwin, Procter, Field &amp; Hoar. In early 1929, Field was appointed a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (and would later become its Chief Justice), and the firm was renamed Goodwin, Procter &amp; Hoar, a name it would retain for the next 72 years.
The Depression years proved pivotal for the firm&#x27;s future diversification and growth. Liquidation cases, including the unwinding of the Boston Continental Bank, provided a surge of business, as did the proliferation of federal agencies and regulations brought on by the New Deal. Around the same time, Greater Boston&#x27;s manufacturing and maritime industries faded and the financial management industry expanded, presenting new opportunities for work on highly complex financial transactions.

Goodwin Procter also undertook matters involving public service and public policy, including public investigations of corruption and malfeasance, as well as cases with constitutional overtones. When the Massachusetts governor pardoned New England Mafia boss Raymond Patriarca in 1938, the resulting public furor led the Legislature to establish a commission to investigate the state&#x27;s pardon and parole procedures. Sam Hoar, with Don Hurley as his lieutenant, headed the commission, whose resulting investigation led to reform of the pardon laws and impeachment of a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council. More than 70 years later, the Commonwealth would once again call on Goodwin Procter lawyers to examine alleged corruption in the state&#x27;s parole office.

After World War II, partners Leonard Wheeler and Frank Wallis played instrumental roles in the historic Nuremberg Trials, presenting much of the Americans&#x27; case against the Nazis. &quot;It was a most amazing and thrilling experience,&quot; recalled Wallis. &quot;I was speaking to the world - not only the world of today but the world of future generations.&quot; Post-war practice would not be business as usual as the firm reached a generational turning point, with Robert Goodwin entering semi-retirement and Sam Hoar&#x27;s passing in 1952. (Joe Procter had died earlier in 1932.) Goodwin formally retired in 1963, ending a 60-year legal career; he died in 1971.

In 1960, tax partners Allan Higgins and Charlie Post helped draft and secure passage of the Real Estate Investment Trust Act, which was hailed as a significant catalyst for real estate development across the country. In 1963, partner Don Hurley played a role in conceiving, drafting and securing passage of an amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act exempting parent companies of single banks and non-banking subsidiaries from federal restrictions on commercial banks.

In 1969, after more than a half-century in the India Building at 84 State Street, the firm moved to a new office tower at 28 State, where it would remain for 16 years before moving to Exchange Place at 53 State Street in 1985. To celebrate its 75th anniversary in 1987, the firm made a donation of $1 million to the City of Boston to fund initiatives in public education. The donation, called SEED (Support for Early Educational Development), was made up entirely of individual contributions by the firm&#x27;s partners.

With 280 lawyers, Goodwin Procter entered the 1990s as the “largest law firm under one roof in the country,” according to &quot;Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly&quot;. The firm made its first foray outside Boston in 1994 with an office in Washington, D.C., followed by one in New York in 1997. The acquisition of 27 lawyers from a northern New Jersey firm and 13 litigators from a New York products liability shop bolstered the firm&#x27;s IP and litigation practices in New York.

In 1998, Regina Pisa became the first woman to be named chairman and Managing Partner of an AmLaw 100 firm. Under Pisa&#x27;s leadership, Goodwin grew from 300 lawyers primarily in Boston to more than 900 lawyers serving clients from eight locations in the United States, Europe and Asia. In 2004, the firm merged with the Washington, D.C.–based litigation and regulatory mid-sized firm Shea &amp; Gardner. The following year over 60 attorneys from Testa, Hurwitz &amp; Thibeault joined Goodwin Procter as Testa Hurwitz dissolved, a move the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; called possibly &quot;the biggest coup in Boston legal history.&quot; Goodwin first established its West Coast presence in 2006, opening offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It launched its Silicon Valley presence in 2007. The firm went global in 2008 with offices in London (Goodwin&#x27;s first European location) and Hong Kong.

At its century mark in 2012, Goodwin had 850 lawyers and another 720 professional staff serving clients from offices in the United States, Europe and Asia. As part of its centennial celebrations, the firm started its Annual Days of Service tradition, during which employees in each office give back to their communities. In 2015, Goodwin announced the opening of an office in Frankfurt, Germany. In April 2016, Goodwin opened its third European office in Paris, France. Later that year, the firm moved its Boston home to 100 Northern Avenue in the city&#x27;s Seaport District after more than 100 years at the corner of State and Congress Streets. Two years later, Goodwin announced a significant expansion of its European Private Equity and Private Investment Funds practices with a group comprising the bulk of the market-leading and former SJ Berwin investment funds team. In 2019, Goodwin opened new offices in Santa Monica, Luxembourg and Cambridge. In April 2022, Goodwin continued expanding its European operations by opening a second German office in Munich. Goodwin&#x27;s Singapore office, opened in October 2022, marked the firm&#x27;s second location in Asia.

==Clients==

* Japan&#x27;s Kyowa Kirin acquired Orchard Therapeutics for $477.6 million. Goodwin advised the British biopharmaceutical company in the deal.
* The firm advised OpenAI on its fundraising efforts.
* In 2025, Goodwin Procter represented the town of Milton, Massachusetts when the town was sued by the state of Massachusetts for refusing to comply with Massachusetts state law to allow multi-family housing near public transit stations.

==Rankings==

Goodwin currently ranks 17th on the &quot;American Lawyer’s&quot; annual ranking of U.S. law firms by gross revenue, and its lawyers and practice groups are consistently recognized by &quot;Chambers&quot;, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and &quot;Legal 500&quot;.

<doc id="1245931" wikidata="Q265309" url="?curid=1245931" title="Romanian cuisine">
<text>Romanian cuisine () is a diverse blend of different dishes from several traditions with which it has come into contact, but it also maintains its own character. It has been influenced mainly by Ottoman and Turkish cuisine but also a series of European cuisines in particular from the Balkan Peninsula and Hungarian cuisine as well as culinary elements stemming from the cuisines of Central Europe.

Romanian cuisine includes numerous holiday dishes arranged according to the mentioned season and holiday since the country has its religious roots in Eastern Orthodoxy. Romanian dishes consist of vegetables, cereals, fruits, honey, milk, dairy products, meat and game.

Various kinds of dishes are available, which are sometimes included under a generic term; for example, the category &quot;ciorbă&quot; includes a wide range of soups with a characteristic sour taste. Variations include meat and vegetable soup, tripe (&quot;ciorbă de burtă&quot;) and calf foot soup, or fish soup, all of which are soured by lemon juice, sauerkraut juice (), vinegar, or &quot;borș&quot; (traditionally made from bran). The category &quot;țuică&quot; (plum brandy) is a name for a strong alcoholic spirit in Romania.

With the cuisine of Romania being shared by another country, namely Moldova, there are similarities between the cuisines of the two Romanian-speaking countries.

==History==

In the history of Romanian culinary literature, Costache Negruzzi and Mihail Kogălniceanu were the compilers of a cookbook &quot;200 Proven Recipes for Dishes, Pastries and Other Household Works&quot; &quot;(&quot;) printed in 1841. Also, Negruzzi writes in &quot;Alexandru Lăpușneanu&quot;, &quot;In Moldavia, at this time, fine food wasn&#x27;t fashioned. The greatest feast only offered a few types of dishes. After the borș, Greek dishes would follow, boiled with herbs floating in butter, and finally cosmopolitan steaks&quot;.

Cheese has been a part of Romanian cuisine since the beginning of its history. &quot;Brânză&quot; is the generic term for cheese in Romanian.

Maize and potatoes became staples of Romanian cuisine after their introduction to Europe. Maize, in particular, contributed to health and nutrition improvements of Romanians in the 16th and 17th centuries, resulting in a population boom.

For about three centuries, Wallachia and Moldavia, two of the three medieval Romanian principalities, were mildly influenced by their various neighbors, like the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman cuisine changed the Romanian table with appetizers made from various vegetables, such as eggplant and bell peppers, as well as various meat preparations, such as &quot;chiftele&quot; (deep-fried meatballs, a variation of kofta). The various kinds of &quot;ciorbă&quot; and meat-and-vegetable stews, such as &quot;iahnie de fasole&quot; (beans), &quot;ardei umpluți&quot; (stuffed peppers), and &quot;sarmale&quot; (stuffed cabbage) are influenced by Turkish cuisine.

==Description==
Romanian recipes bear the same influences as the rest of Romanian culture. The Turks brought meatballs (&quot;perișoare&quot; in a meatball soup), from the Greeks there is &quot;musaca&quot;, from the Austrians there is the &quot;șnițel&quot;, and the list continues. The Romanians share many foods with the Balkan area and former Austria-Hungary. Some others are original or can be traced to the Romans, as well as other ancient civilizations. The lack of written sources in Eastern Europe makes it impossible to determine today the exact origin for most of them.

One of the most common meals is the &quot;mămăligă&quot; (polenta), served on its own or as an accompaniment. Pork is the main meat used in Romanian cuisine, but beef is also consumed, along with mutton and fish.

Before Christmas, on December 20 (Ignat&#x27;s Day or &quot;Ignatul&quot; in Romanian), a pig is traditionally slaughtered by every rural family. A variety of foods for Christmas are prepared from the slaughtered pig, such as:
* &quot;Cârnați&quot; – garlicky pork sausages, which may be smoked or dry-cured;
* &quot;Lebăr&quot; – an emulsified sausage based on liver with the consistency of the filling ranging from fine (&quot;pâté&quot;) to coarse;
* &quot;Sângerete&quot; (black pudding) – an emulsified sausage obtained from a mixture of pig&#x27;s blood with fat and meat, breadcrumbs or other grains, and spices;
* &quot;Tobă&quot; (head cheese) – based on pig&#x27;s feet, ears, and meat from the head suspended in aspic and stuffed in the pig&#x27;s stomach;
* &quot;Tochitură&quot; – a stew made with pork, smoked and fresh sausage simmered in a tomato sauce and served with &quot;mămăligă&quot; and wine (&quot;so that the pork can swim&quot;). There are many variations of this stew throughout Romania, with some versions combining different meats, including chicken, lamb, beef, pork and sometimes even offal;
* &quot;Pomana porcului&quot;—pan-fried cubed pork served right after the pig&#x27;s sacrifice to thank the relatives and friends who helped with the process;
* &quot;Piftie/răcitură&quot; – inferior parts of the pig, mainly the tail, feet, and ears, spiced with garlic and served in aspic;
* &quot;Jumări&quot; – dried pork remaining from rendering of the fat and tumbled through various spices

The Christmas meal is sweetened with the traditional &quot;cozonac&quot;, a sweet bread made with nuts, poppy seeds, or &quot;rahat&quot; (Turkish delight).

At Easter, lamb is served: the main dishes are &quot;borș de miel&quot; (lamb sour soup), roast lamb, and &quot;drob de miel&quot; – a Romanian dish similar to haggis made from minced offal (heart, liver, lungs), lamb meat and spring onions with spices, wrapped in a caul and roasted. The traditional Easter cake is &quot;pască&quot;, a pie made from yeast dough with a sweet cottage cheese filling at the center.

Romanian pancakes, called &quot;clătite&quot;, are thin (like the French crêpe) and can be prepared with savory or sweet fillings: ground meat, cheese, or jam. Different recipes are prepared depending on the season or the occasion.

Wine is the preferred drink, and Romanian wine has a tradition of over three millennia. Romania is currently the world&#x27;s ninth largest wine producer, and recently the export market has started to grow. Romania produces a wide selection of domestic varieties (Fetească, Grasă, Tămâioasă, Busuioacă, and Băbească), as well as varieties from across the world (Italian Riesling, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Muscat Ottonel). Beer is also highly regarded, generally blonde pilsener beer, made with German influences. There are also Romanian breweries with a long tradition.

According to the 2009 data of FAOSTAT, Romania is the world&#x27;s second largest plum producer (after the United States), and as much as 75% of Romania&#x27;s plum production is processed into the famous &quot;țuică&quot;, a plum brandy obtained through one or more distillation steps.

===Vegetarianism and veganism===
Followers of the Romanian Orthodox Church fast during several periods throughout the ecclesiastical calendar amounting to a majority of the year. In the Romanian Orthodox tradition, devotees keep to a diet without any animal products during these times. As a result, vegan foods are abundant in stores and restaurants; however, Romanians may not be familiar with a vegan or vegetarian diet as a full-time lifestyle choice. Many recipes below have vegan versions, and the vegetables section below contains many common fasting foods.

==List of dishes==

===Soups===

* &quot;Borș&quot; is fermented wheat bran, a souring agent for &quot;ciorbă&quot;. Borș is also used today as a synonym for &quot;ciorbă&quot;, but in the past, a distinction was made between &quot;borș&quot; and &quot;ciorbă&quot; (&quot;acritură&quot;), the souring agent for the latter being the juice of unripe fruits, such as grapes, mirabelle, or wood sorrel leaves.
** &quot;Borș de burechiușe&quot;

** &quot;Ciorbă moldovenească de găină&quot; is a hen sour soup

<text>Scilla siberica, the Siberian squill or wood squill, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to southwestern Russia, the Caucasus, and Turkey. Despite its name, it is not native to Siberia.

Many parts of the plant are poisonous to eat for some animals.

==Description==

Growing to tall by wide, it is a bulbous perennial, with two to four strap-shaped leaves appearing in early spring, at the same time as the nodding, blue, bell-shaped flowers.

The flowers have six tepals and six stamens, and are arranged singly or in racemes of two or three. Petals may be reflexed to the horizontal when sunlight is bright, but are more often cup-shaped. The flowers are usually blue, but those of &quot;Scilla siberica&quot; var. &quot;alba&quot; are white. The stamens of &quot;Scilla&quot; are separate, unlike those of the related genus &quot;Puschkinia&quot;, which are fused into a tube. The pollen is dark blue.

After flowering, the flower stems become limp as capsules (pods) mature. At maturity, the capsules become purple and split open, releasing small, dark brown seeds. When the seeds are mature, the leaves wither and the plant goes dormant until the next spring.

The seedlings are hollow-leaved.

==Cultivation==
&quot;S. siberica&quot; is cultivated for its bluebell-like flowers. It naturalizes rapidly from seed. At , it is suitable for planting in grass, and will spread by seed to form large colonies that go dormant by the time grass needs to be mowed. In the Midwestern United States it is becoming invasive in some situations.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>(&quot;Girls in Uniform&quot;) is a 1931 German romantic drama film based on the play &quot;&quot; (&quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;) by Christa Winsloe and directed by Leontine Sagan with artistic direction from Carl Froelich, who also funded the film. Winsloe also wrote the screenplay and was on the set during filming. Due to the film&#x27;s overt and openly lesbian themes, the film remains an international cult classic and enjoys widespread acclaim from critics.

== Plot ==
Manuela von Meinhardis, whose mother died when she was young and whose father serves in the military, is enrolled at an all-girls boarding school headed by the traditional and iron-fisted Fräulein von Nordeck zur Nidden. Manuela feels out of place in this strict environment. After witnessing Fräulein von Bernburg&#x27;s compassion for the other girls, Manuela develops a passionate love for her teacher. The first spark of love begins with a goodnight kiss. Manuela receives this goodnight kiss on her first night at the school and, while the teacher normally gives all the girls a goodnight kiss on the forehead, Fräulein von Bernburg kisses her on the lips.

After not knowing her recitation for Fräulein von Bernburg&#x27;s class, Manuela is asked to meet her in her room. Fräulein von Bernburg comments on the state of Manuela&#x27;s clothes and gives Manuela one of her own petticoats. Manuela begins to weep and, after some time, confesses her love to Fräulein von Bernburg, who says that she cannot give Manuela special treatment. Shortly after, Ilsa von Westhagen, another student, writes a letter to her parents about the conditions of the school and has a worker smuggle it out.  

When the girls prepare to put on the play Don Carlos by Friedrich Schiller for the headmistress&#x27;s birthday, Manuela plays the lead male role, Don Carlos. Ilsa is also supposed to play a large role but is not allowed to perform after her letter is returned to the school. The play is a success, and Fräulein von Bernburg is moved. During the afterparty, the girls are served punch containing alcohol. Manuela drunkenly confesses her love for Fräulein von Bernburg and tells everyone about the petticoat. The headmistress overhears and Manuela passes out after her speech.  

The headmistress puts her in solitary, but Manuela is moved out of solitary when the princess arrives at the school. After the duchess leaves, the headmistress scolds Fräulein von Bernburg&#x27;s closeness with her students. Fräulein von Bernburg calls Manuela to her office and explains that Manuela is never to speak to her again.  

Upon leaving Fräulein&#x27;s von Bernburg&#x27;s office, Manuela prepares to jump from several stories up in the main staircase. The girls save her, and both Fräulein von Bernburg and the headmistress are shaken. The movie ends with all the girls watching the headmistress as she slowly walks down the stairwell and down the hall in shaken silence.

== Cast ==
==Production==

Winsloe&#x27;s stage play had previously appeared under the title &#x27; (&quot;Knight Nérestan&quot;) in Leipzig with Hertha Thiele and Claire Harden in the lead roles. After Leipzig the play was produced on the stage in Berlin as &#x27; with a different cast and a more prominent lesbian theme, which was again toned down somewhat for the film.

Having mostly played the same roles on stage, the cast was able to produce the film at speed and on a low budget of . It was largely shot at the Potsdam military orphanage, now a teacher training college for women. Carl Froelich&#x27;s studio in Berlin-Tempelhof was also used. The film&#x27;s original working title was &quot;&quot; (&quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;) but this was thought too insipid and changed to increase the chances of box-office success. Although sound had only been used for two years in cinema, it was used artfully.

The film was groundbreaking in having an all-female cast; in its sympathetic portrayal of lesbian &quot;pedagogical eros&quot; (see Gustav Wyneken) and homoeroticism, revolving around the passionate love of a fourteen-year-old (Manuela) for her teacher (von Bernburg); and in its co-operative and profit-sharing financial arrangements (although these failed).

After many screen tests, Winsloe had insisted that her friend Thiele play the lead role. Director Sagan preferred Gina Falckenberg who had done the role on stage in Berlin, but along with having played Manuela in Leipzig, Thiele had played a young lesbian in Ferdinand Bruckner&#x27;s stage play &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Creature&quot;) and although 23 years old when filming began, she was considered to be more capable of portraying a 14-year-old girl.

==Reaction==

The film had some impact in the Berlin lesbian clubs, but was largely eclipsed by the ongoing cult success of &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (1930). The film did, however, generate large amounts of fan mail to the stars from all over Germany and was considered a success throughout much of Europe. The goodnight kiss Hertha Thiele (Manuela) received from Dorothea Wieck (Fräulein von Bernburg) was especially popular. One distributor even asked for more footage of other kisses like it to splice into prints of the film.

From its premiere at the Capitol cinema in Berlin until 1934, the film is said to have grossed some . Despite the collective nature of the filming for which cast and crew received only a quarter of the normal wage, none saw a share of the six million Reichsmarks and Thiele later hinted that the profits had been mostly retained by the producers.

The film was distributed outside Germany and was a huge success in Romania. During a 1980 interview, Thiele said the school play scene caused a &quot;longstockings and kissing&quot; cult when the film was first shown there. It was also distributed in Japan, the United States, England and France.

&quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; won the audience referendum for Best Technical Perfection at the Venice Film Festival in 1932 and received the Japanese Kinema Junpo Award for Best Foreign Language Film (Tokyo, 1934).

Later, an alternate ending which subtly pandered to Nazi ideals enabled continued screening in German cinemas. Eventually even this version of the film was banned as &quot;decadent&quot; by the Nazi regime, which reportedly attempted to burn all of the existing prints. By then, though, several had been dispersed around the world. Leontine Sagan (director) and many others associated with the film fled Germany soon after the banning. Many of the cast and crew were Jewish, and those who could not escape from Germany died in the camps. Assistant director Walter Supper killed himself when it became clear his Jewish wife would be arrested.

Despite its later banning, &#x27; was followed by several German films about intimate relationships among women, such as &#x27; (&quot;Eight Girls in a Boat&quot;, 1932) and &quot;Anna and Elizabeth&quot; (1933), which also starred Wieck and Thiele but was banned by the Nazis soon after its opening night along with the Nazi propaganda film &quot;I for You, You for Me&quot; (&quot;Me for You, You for Me&quot;, 1934).

The film is said to have inspired the 1949 novel &quot;Olivia&quot; by Dorothy Bussy, which treats very similar themes, and which was made into a French film &quot;Olivia&quot; (1951) directed by Jacqueline Audry.

There is a German remake of the film produced in 1958. &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; (1958) was directed by Géza von Radványi and starred Lilli Palmer, Romy Schneider, and Therese Giehse. In this remake, the political criticism on the Prussian Center and the love story between the main characters was played down. Manuela comes to see Fräulein von Bernburg as a motherly figure rather than a romantic one.

There was another remake made in Mexico in 1950. The film is entitled &quot;Muchachas de uniforme&quot; and was directed by Alfredo B. Crevenna. Other films that were inspired by the themes in &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; are &quot;Lost and Delirious&quot; (Lea Pool, Canada 2001) and &quot;Loving Annabella&quot; (Katherine Brooks, 2006). &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; was also the inspiration for René Pollesch&#x27;s play &quot;Mädchen in Uniform -- Wege aus der Selbstverwirklichung&quot; at the German Playhouse in Hamburg (2010).

Since the film&#x27;s release, &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&#x27;s&quot; message - and by extension what the movie symbolizes - has been widely debated by critics; with Christa Winsloe&#x27;s and Leontine Sagan&#x27;s intention to make the movie contested. B. Ruby Rich believes it to be, among other things, &quot;a film about sexual repression in the name of social harmony, about the absent patriarchy and its forms of presence, about bonds between women which represent attraction instead of repulsion, and about the release of powers that can accompany the identification of a lesbian sexuality.&quot; While very few analyses question the film&#x27;s queer messaging, there is a more contentious debate about whether the film is an effective allegory for the 1930s world and the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party.

In his 1947 book &quot;From Caligari to Hitler&quot;, German film critic Siegfried Kracauer argues that the film fails to fully break away from the authoritarian rule as &quot;in the whole film, there is no hint of the possibility that authoritarian behavior might be superseded by democratic behavior.&quot; This, according to Kracauer, exists in several places from the character of Fräulein Von Bernberg, the treatment of Manuela and the ending of the film where the headmistress is forced out of the school after Manuela&#x27;s attempted suicide. The bugles that conclude the film symbolise to Kraucer &quot;that the principle of authority has not been shaken. The headmistress will continue to wield the scepter. And any possible softening of authoritarian discipline would only be in the interest of its preservation.&quot; Many people have refuted this argument however, including Nina Zimink who agrees that the bugle fair does symbolize that not everything is perfect after the departure of the headmistress, states that they signify &quot;optimistic political development&quot; in a world that is quite bleak. Whilst some critics, like Lisa Ohm and Lotte H. Eisner, agreed with Siegfried&#x27;s argument in one regard or another, the primary perspective is to move away from this critical view . Rich, who championed the film as unabashedly queer, states that &quot;intrusion to the film is an antidote to viewing this all-female space as a &quot;free zone&quot; within a patriarchal society, which can be seen to dominate not only in the concrete form of the staircase or Principal, but in the equally threatening form of external authority that waits just outside the school gates&quot;. There are also thinkers like Veronika Mayer who call the film &quot;liberating&quot; especially when placed in contrast to the 1958 film that is far more timid about the lesbian relationship between Manuela and Fräulein Von Bernburg, opting instead to present it as maternal connection.

==Censorship and surviving version==

On October 1, 1931, a ban was placed on &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; at the first inspection committee showing which forbad young people from viewing. On April 8, 1932, the decision for a 2480m shortened version was confirmed.  

The film was released internationally and was very successful. The film had success particularly in Japan, the USA, France, Great Britain, and Mexico. In 1934 the film brought in 6 million Reichsmarks, while the production costs were only 55,000 Reichsmarks.

During the National Socialist rule in Germany, Mädchen in Uniform was banned by Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda. The film was only allowed to be shown abroad. This ban was not so much about the lesbian theme of the film, but rather the depictions of Prussian ruthlessness and the criticisms on authority and discipline.  

At the FSK-Test on December 8, 1949, the film was approved again and the restrictions were lifted. The film was then unofficially distributed as a video shown in women&#x27;s centers. After that, the first public reproduction was in 1977 when a West German broadcasting organization decided to broadcast the film.

The film was almost banned in the U.S., but Eleanor Roosevelt spoke highly of the film, resulting in the film getting a limited release in the US in 1932–33. Prints of the film survived the war, but it was censored heavily until the 1970s, and it was not shown again in Germany until 1977 when it was screened on television.

In 1978, Janus Films and Arthur Krim arranged for a limited re-release in the US in 35mm, including a screening at the Roxie Cinema in San Francisco. Also in 1978, the film was released in its surviving form by Janus Films on VHS with English subtitles.

Versions were released in the U.S. (1994) and the UK (2000) by the British Film Institute.

== Present day views ==
The film has had a lasting impact, both for its boldness in depicting lesbian desires and relationships free from censorship but also for its ability to depict the German political landscape of the 1930s despite being set in pre-World War One Prussia. Whilst critics like Siegfried Kracauer and Lisa Ohm were critical of the film for being too timid on fascism, many contemporary and present-day thinkers have commended the film for its commentary on such matters. Stephen Spender, an English poet and novelist who was a close friend of the writer Christopher Isherwood, was immensely critical of texts like the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;, based on Isherwood&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot;, stating that &quot;there is not a single meal, or club, in the movie &quot;Cabaret&quot;, that Christopher and I could have afforded.&quot; and yet heralded &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; a &quot;masterpiece&quot; for how it was able to present the contemporary environment.

On February 18, 2021, the British Film Institute featured the film in a Big Screen Classics season that primarily centered queer films like &quot;Maurice&quot;, &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, and &quot;Desert Hearts&quot;, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s call for revolutionary empathy is...timeless&quot; a fact amplified by how the film was one of the oldest ones featured in the season. The same year, on November 30, 2021, a Criterion Collection version of the film was released. As a company, Criterion is dedicated to &quot;publishing important classic and contemporary films from around the world... in state-of-the-art restorations with special features designed to encourage repeated watching and deepen the viewer&#x27;s appreciation of the art of film.&quot; Amanda Lee Koe stated in an essay that accompanied the release of the Criterion edition, that &quot;This film belongs to women who are trying to find themselves—and each other—in spite of repressive structures&quot;.

==Quotation from the film==
*&quot;Through discipline and hunger we will become great&quot; (Spoken by the headmistress in reference to disciplining the students) 
*&quot;What you call sin, I call the great spirit of love, which takes a thousand forms.&quot; (Spoken by Fräulein Von Bernburg in reference to the boycott.)
*&quot;I love you so, but you&#x27;re always so distant. I can&#x27;t ever go to your room, or talk to you&quot; ( Manuela discussing her feelings with Fräulein Von Bernburg)
*&quot;Almost all the girls here have a crush on Miss von Bernburg. Oh, God! When I finally don&#x27;t have to listen to that anymore. &quot;Ilse! I envy you! You&#x27;re in her dormitory! Oh, gosh, gosh, gosh! Tell me, is it true that she kisses you at night?&quot; (Ilse von Westhagen introducing Fräulein von Bernburg to Manuela)
*&quot;I fear nothing. Yes! Everybody should know! Long live our beloved Miss von Bernburg!&quot; (Manuela)

==In popular culture==
* In Anthony Powell&#x27;s novel &quot;The Acceptance World&quot; (1955), the narrator, Nick Jenkins, is re-united with his first major love, Jean Templer, after Jean and her sister-in-law, Mona, have returned to the Ritz (London) on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1931, following a screening of the film. Jean is accompanied by her brother Peter. Nick (who has seen the film) is mildly mocked by his old schoolfriend Peter (who has not), for saying that the film is not primarily about lesbians.
* In the film &quot;Henry &amp; June&quot; (1990), this is one of the films shown in the small art-house theater frequented by the main characters.
*The film &quot;Loving Annabelle&quot; (2006) was reportedly inspired by &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot;.
*The album &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; (2009) by the Austrian band Nachtmahr.

<doc id="1245945" wikidata="Q2268536" url="?curid=1245945" title="King of the hill (game)">
<text>King of the hill (also known as king of the mountain or king of the castle) is a children&#x27;s game, the object of which is for a single player to remain on top of a large hill or similar feature as its &quot;king&quot;. Rivals attempt to remove the player and take their place, thus becoming the new king of the hill. 

The way the king can be removed from the hill depends largely on the rules determined by the players before the game starts. Ordinarily, pushing is the most common way of removing the king from the hill, and punching and kicking are not allowed. The potential for rougher versions of the game have led to it often being banned from schools.

&quot;King of the kill&quot; is a method of play in airsoft and the woodsball variant of paintball, as well as an archetype of various first-person shooter videogames.

== Rules ==
There are many versions of the game. These include: 

=== Classic version ===

# The first to get on the hill at the start becomes the king.
# To become a king, you need to go up the hill and push the king off.
# At the end, the king wins.

=== Team version ===
In this version, there are two or more opponent teams

# The king is the leader of the first team to get up the hill at the start.
# To become the new king, the leader of an opposing team must get on the hill and push the king off.
# Allies of the king can push opponents and enemies off, and non-lead opponents can push off allies but not the king.
# At the end, the king and his allies win.

=== &quot;Royal family&quot; version ===
In this version, there is not just the king but also his family, making up teams of four. 

# The king, queen, prince, and princess are the members of the team that get on the hill first.
# The other team&#x27;s players can push off their respective counterpart on the hill and assume the royal role.
# The king or queen has the ability to &quot;kick&quot; an opposing team&#x27;s player from the hill and send them back to their own team in exchange for the person with the same role from the king&#x27;s or queen&#x27;s team.

==Use as a metaphor==

The name of the game has become a common metaphor for any sort of competitive zero-sum game or social activity in which a single winner is chosen from among multiple competitors, and a hierarchy is devised by the heights the competitors achieve on the hill (what Howard Bloom called &quot;the pecking order&quot; in his book &quot;The Lucifer Principle&quot;), and where winning can only be achieved at the cost of displacing the previous winner.

==In sports==
In racket sports, such as tennis or pickleball, a variation of this concept manifests in the recreational game alternately titled King of the Court or Queen of the court. In this game, one player is designated as the &quot;king&quot;/&quot;queen&quot; and occupies one side of the court. Other players, the challengers, line up single file on the other side. One challenger steps up and plays out a singles point (or multiple points) against the king. The point can be started with either a serve or a drop hit. If the challenger wins, they replace the king on the other side of the court and become the new king.

==In video gaming==

The concept of king of the hill in video gaming was introduced by &quot;Core War&quot; players, who would pit their warriors against each other in a fight for survival. King of the hill tournaments have existed for &quot;Core War&quot; since the 1980s.

In video game versions of king of the hill, a player or team must keep control of a specific area (not necessarily a literal hill) for a predetermined amount of time. When that amount of time has elapsed, the round either ends or a new area is designated on the map. Players are primarily removed from the area by being killed.

King of the hill has been featured as a game variant in many video games, especially first-person shooters like &quot;&quot; and the more traditional &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; (and, more recently, &quot;Gears of War 2&quot;). One of the games that popularized such modes is &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;. The &quot;Splatoon&quot; series has a variant of king of the hill called Splat Zones. &quot;Overwatch&quot; had a mode called &quot;Control&quot;, which used king of the hill mechanics. King of the hill is also an option in top-down games such as those in the &quot;Army Men&quot; series.

<doc id="1245946" wikidata="Q7245134" url="?curid=1245946" title="Principia College">
<text>Principia College is a private liberal arts college in Elsah, Illinois. It was founded in 1912 by Mary Kimball Morgan with the purpose of &quot;serving the Cause of Christian Science.&quot; &quot;Although the College is not affiliated with the Christian Science Church, the practice of Christian Science is the cornerstone of campus life.&quot;

Principia sits on bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River between Alton and Grafton in the Metro East region of Southern Illinois, thirty miles north of St. Louis. A portion of the school&#x27;s campus is a designated National Historic Landmark District, for its many buildings and design by architect Bernard Maybeck.

==History==
Although Principia College was born out of The Principia, founded by Mary Kimball Morgan in 1898, the name Principia was not adopted until 1898. As Morgan&#x27;s school grew, the founder of Christian Science, Mary Baker Eddy, approved The Principia&#x27;s reference as a Christian Science school. Emerging from the Principia Lower, Middle, and Upper Schools founded between 1898 and 1906, Principia College was established with a purpose of &quot;serving the Cause of Christian Science through appropriate channels open to it as an educational institution.&quot; The college, however, has no official affiliation with the Christian Science Church and Christian Science is not taught as a subject, but its principles form the basis of community life at Principia. The first Upper School class graduated in 1906 and it is from this class that a junior college was established, whose first alumni graduated in 1917. Principia College has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1923.

Architect Bernard Maybeck was commissioned to design a new college campus in Elsah, Illinois. By 1931, ground was broken on what would become his largest commission.

On the Principia College grounds is Eliestoun House, designed by Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow Jr. and completed in 1890. When Principia began moving to Elsah, guests stayed there, including Mary Kimball Morgan and Bernard Maybeck.

In 1934, Principia College graduated its first class as a full four-year institution. In 1935, the college was officially moved to its present-day location in Elsah. The Principia College campus was once considered as the site for the United States Air Force Academy though ultimately the Air Force chose a location in Colorado Springs, Colorado, instead.

On April 19, 1993, about of the campus was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior. The year 1998 marked centennial celebrations by the school. 

In the 21st century, the school&#x27;s enrollment size has declined due to the dwindling number of Christian Scientists.

==Campus==
===Housing and student life facilities===
There are ten student dormitories on campus: Anderson Hall, Rackham Court, Howard House, Sylvester House, Buck House, Brooks House, Ferguson House, Joe McNabb, Lowrey House, and Clara McNabb. The first six mentioned were designed by former University of California, Berkeley professor and AIA Gold Medal winner Bernard Maybeck in 1935, as was the campus&#x27; chapel. Maybeck attempted to use different architectural styles and building techniques for each of these dormitories and for the chapel. In an effort to ensure success with his designs and materials, he experimented with them through the creation of a small building known affectionately by Principians as the &quot;Mistake House.&quot; In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the Principia College Campus was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois).

== Organization and administration ==

Principia had an endowment of $696.2 million as of June 2020. The endowment size declined by more than $100 million in the decade prior to 2018.

As of 2019, Principia College&#x27;s annual tuition costs were $29,470, with additional costs of $11,610 for room and board (99% of freshmen lived on campus in 2018–2019). In 2017, the school had an acceptance rate above 90%.

==Student life==

Principia College has a diverse student composition and amount of organizations given its size. 20% of its students are international and represent thirty countries on six of the world&#x27;s seven continents. The college has forty student clubs and organizations, among these the Euphrates and Leadership institutes.

<doc id="1245949" wikidata="Q643423" url="?curid=1245949" title="Whole Lotta Love">
<text>&quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It is the opening track on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;, and was released as a single in 1969 in several countries; as with other Led Zeppelin songs, no single was released in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it became their first hit and was certified gold. Parts of the song&#x27;s lyrics were adapted from Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;You Need Love&quot;, recorded by Muddy Waters in 1962; originally uncredited to Dixon, a lawsuit in 1985 was settled with a payment to Dixon and credit on subsequent releases.

In 2004, the song was ranked number 75 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and in March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; placed &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; at number three in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. It was placed 11 on a similar list by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2009 it was named the third greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1. In 2014, listeners to BBC Radio 2 voted &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; as containing the greatest guitar riff of all time.

==Composition and recording==

Jimmy Page came up with the guitar riff for &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; in the summer of 1968, on his houseboat on the River Thames at Pangbourne, Berkshire, England. However, John Paul Jones stated that it probably was developed from a live improvisation during performances of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;. Page denied that the song originated onstage and that he had the riff and the rest took it from there. The chugging riff sounds like twin guitars because Page is playing two guitar strings in unison, while bending one of them to slightly change the pitch. At the same time, John Paul Jones is using the same technique on bass guitar, doubling the guitar part in a lower octave. Page recorded his part while playing through a solid-state amplifier.

Notation for the song indicates the key of E major and a tempo of 92 beats per minute in a compound AABA form. 

During the two day mix of the &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; album, audio engineer Eddie Kramer discovered what he thought was some magnetic tape bleedthrough on Plant&#x27;s vocals on the &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; track, which could not be removed, so he put some echo on it, and Page liked the sound. Page also employed a backwards echo production technique.

==Personnel==
According to Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin:

* Robert Plant – vocals, tambourine
* Jimmy Page – guitars, theremin, backing vocals (?)
* John Paul Jones – bass guitar, bongos, backing vocals, keyboards (?)
* John Bonham – drums, congas, maracas

==Release==
On 7 November 1969, &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; was released as a single in several countries, with &quot;Living Loving Maid (She&#x27;s Just a Woman)&quot; as the B-side. In the US, Atlantic provided an edited 3:12 version as the flipside for radio stations. &quot;Billboard&quot; described the single as a &quot;powerful, commercial swinger that should have no trouble putting [Led Zeppelin] up the Hot 100.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as &quot;a mixture of rock and blues with special production touches and a rousing lead vocal performance.&quot; In the UK, Atlantic Records expected to issue an edited version, and pressed initial copies for release on 5 December 1969, but this was cancelled by request of manager Peter Grant.

==Similarities to &quot;You Need Love&quot;==

In 1962, Muddy Waters recorded a blues vocal, &quot;You Need Love&quot;, for Chess Records. As he had done with &quot;You Shook Me&quot;, Waters overdubbed vocals on an instrumental track previously recorded by blues guitarist Earl Hooker and his band. Willie Dixon wrote the lyrics, which Dixon biographer Mitsutoshi Inaba describes as being &quot;about the necessity of love&quot;:

In 1966, the British band Small Faces recorded the song as &quot;You Need Loving&quot; for their eponymous debut Decca album. According to Steve Marriott, the group&#x27;s vocalist and guitarist, Page and Plant attended several Small Faces gigs, where they expressed their interest in the song. Plant&#x27;s phrasing is particularly similar to that of Marriott&#x27;s, who added &quot;he [Plant] sang it the same, phrased it the same, even the stops at the end were the same&quot;. Similarities with &quot;You Need Love&quot; led to a lawsuit against Led Zeppelin in 1985, settled out of court in favour of Dixon for an undisclosed amount. On subsequent releases, Dixon&#x27;s name is included on the credits for &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;. Plant explained in an interview with &quot;Musician&quot;:
==Accolades==


==Charts==
The single entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart on 22 November 1969. It remained on the chart for 15 weeks, peaking at number four and becoming the band&#x27;s only top-10 single in the US.

==Performances==
Led Zeppelin first performed &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; on 26 April 1969. Other live versions were released officially:
*&quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; (28 September 1976, from a 1973 concert and movie soundtrack)
*&quot;Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions&quot; (11 November 1997, from a 1971 concert)
*&quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (27 May 2003, from a 1972 concert)
*&quot;Led Zeppelin DVD&quot; (2003, from a 1979 and a 1970 concert)

&quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; was the last song Led Zeppelin played live. It was, however, performed again at the band&#x27;s reunions at Live Aid in 1985 (with drummers Phil Collins and Tony Thompson), at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert in 1988, and at the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 Arena, London, on 10 December 2007 (both with drummer Jason Bonham).

In 2008, a reworked version by Jimmy Page on guitar, with Leona Lewis on vocals, was performed in the &quot;London 2012&quot; presentation during the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Both Lewis and the organisers requested that some of the lyrics be changed, notably &quot;I&#x27;m gonna give you every inch of my love&quot;. Lewis felt that the line made little sense coming from a female singer.

==Cover versions==
&quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; has been recorded by several artists. Versions that reached the record charts include:
*1970CCS (or C.C.S.) recorded a mainly instrumental rendition with a flute playing the melody. &quot;Billboard&quot; described their version as a &quot;blockbuster instrumental treatment of the Led Zeppelin hit&quot;, while Nick Coleman of &quot;The Independent&quot; thought that the cover &quot;succeeded in ameliorating the tune&#x27;s sexual specificity without stripping it of its rutty throb&quot;. Released as a single on the RAK label, it reached number 13 on the UK singles chart in November 1970; number 26 in Belgium (Flanders); number 37 on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Singles in Canada; number 58 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; and number 58 on the US &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100 Singles. The UK music variety television programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; used brief versions by CCS members and others as its intro theme music at different times over the years.
*1971King Curtis and the Kingpins recorded an instrumental version with the melody line performed on saxophone. Atco Records released it as a single in the US, where it reached number 64 on the Hot 100 and number 43 on the R&amp;B chart. A live version, recorded at the Fillmore West, is included on Curtis&#x27; 1971 live album &quot;Live at Fillmore West&quot;.
*1975Tina Turner on her 1975 album &quot;Acid Queen&quot;. Released by United Artists Records, her version reached number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and number 45 on the &quot;Record World&quot; R&amp;B chart.
*1996British band Goldbug, including a sample of &quot;Asteroid&quot; (the Pearl &amp; Dean advertising music). It reached number three in the UK singles chart, number 24 in Ireland, and number 9 in the Netherlands. In 2000, band member Richard Walmsley sued his former label Acid Jazz over unpaid royalties relating to the song. Walmsley received thousands of pounds following the battle.

<text>Cerro El Potosí is the highest mountain in the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range of northeast Mexico. It is located in the state of Nuevo León, about 80 km (50 mi) south of Monterrey.

==Flora and fauna==
It is composed of limestone, and is noted for its very diverse flora including several endemic or near-endemic species, such as the Potosi Pinyon. At the foot of the mountain, a series of springs and endorheic basins were the only site in which the pupfish &quot;Cyprinodon alvarezi&quot; and &quot;Megupsilon aporus&quot;, and the dwarf crayfish &quot;Cambarellus alvarezi&quot; lived. The last two are entirely extinct, while &quot;Cyprinodon alvarezi&quot; is extinct in the wild (only survives in captivity).

==Access==
Access was very difficult in the past, but in the 1960s a microwave relay station was built on the summit, with the road built for this providing easy access from the east.

==Protected areas==
In 2000 the upper slopes of the mountain were designated an ecological reserve, covering 9.02 km2. A northern portion of the mountain, including the actual summit, are in the Cuenca Alimentadora del Distrito Nacional de Riego 026 Bajo Río San Juan, a natural resources protection area.

<text>The Henry Hudson Parkway is a controlled-access parkway in New York City. The southern terminus is in Manhattan at 72nd Street, where the parkway continues south as the West Side Highway. It is often erroneously referred to as the West Side Highway throughout its entire course in Manhattan. The northern terminus is at the Bronx–Westchester county line, where it continues north as the Saw Mill River Parkway. All but the northernmost mile of the road is co-signed as New York State Route 9A (NY 9A). In addition, the entirety of the parkway is designated New York State Route 907V (NY 907V), an unsigned reference route.

The owners of the parkway are the New York State Department of Transportation, New York City Department of Transportation, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Amtrak, and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Henry Hudson Parkway was created by the Henry Hudson Parkway Authority, which was run by &quot;master builder&quot; Robert Moses. The highway itself was constructed from 1934 to 1937.

==Route description==


The Henry Hudson Parkway begins at 72nd Street, which also serves as the north end of the West Side Highway and the last remaining section of the West Side Highway&#x27;s predecessor, the Miller Highway. The junction is numbered as exit 9, continuing the numbering scheme used on the West Side Highway. It heads northward along the west side of Manhattan, connecting to West 79th Street with a large interchange and to other surface streets with more intermittent exits along the way. The parkway continues in a northerly direction, running almost parallel to Riverside Drive north of West 158th Street. It passes under the Trans-Manhattan Expressway (I-95 and U.S. 1) and the George Washington Bridge as it continues its progression through Fort Washington Park, Fort Tryon Park, and Inwood Hill Park. It then runs northward across the Henry Hudson Bridge into the Bronx.

Upon entering the Bronx, the parkway passes through Spuyten Duyvil and Riverdale as it continues northward, edging slightly to the northeast. Between exits 20 and 22, Riverdale Avenue is split into service roads along the parkway. At exit 23, NY 9A leaves the parkway for U.S. Route 9 (US 9) while the parkway enters Van Cortlandt Park. Soon after it enters the park, the parkway has an interchange with the Mosholu Parkway, which connects it to I-87. Half a mile later, the parkway becomes the Saw Mill River Parkway as it enters Westchester County.

==History==

=== 20th century ===

In March 1934, the New York State Legislature approved the Henry Hudson Parkway. Work on the parkway began in February 1935; the project was funded by a $3.1 million bond issue. The portion of the parkway north of Dyckman Street opened on December 12, 1936, and the portion south of the George Washington Bridge opened on October 10, 1937. The section of Riverside Drive between the George Washington Bridge and Dyckman Street was incorporated into the northbound roadway of Henry Hudson Parkway. A parallel southbound roadway for the Henry Hudson Parkway was built between these two points; it opened in January 1938.

The parkway ultimately cost $109 million, twice as expensive as the $49 million Hoover Dam that was built in the same period. The Parkway was part of Robert Moses&#x27;s &quot;West Side Improvement&quot; and included covering the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s West Side Line, creating the Freedom Tunnel. The covered portion is partially used for the highway and also expands the Riverside Park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted.

In the late 1940s, new breakdown lanes were constructed in order to improve safety. However, these were not constructed throughout the entire highway. In 1965, Moses proposed constructing a two-lane reversible roadway along the Henry Hudson Parkway between 59th Street and the George Washington Bridge for $160 million. Had the roadway been built, there would have been no intermediate exits. 

As part of a $2.5 billion statewide bond issue in 1971, there was also a proposal to widen the Henry Hudson Parkway south of the George Washington Bridge to an eight-lane expressway in 1971. Local politicians opposed the proposal because it would require seizing parts of Riverside Park. The widening was canceled after state legislators introduced an amendment to prevent the seizure of any parkland.

=== 21st century ===

On May 12, 2005, part of a retaining wall at Castle Village collapsed onto the northbound lanes of the parkway, just north of the George Washington Bridge, shutting it down shortly before rush hour. The clean-up began quickly, and the road re-opened on May 15. The Henry Hudson Parkway is a candidate for designation as a New York State Scenic Byway, the first in New York City. At the request of the Henry Hudson Parkway Task Force, in 2005 the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council approved funding to develop a comprehensive corridor management plan, a requirement for its designation.

<text>The mandibular foramen is an opening on the internal surface of the ramus of the mandible. It allows for divisions of the mandibular nerve and blood vessels to pass through.

== Structure ==
The mandibular foramen is an opening on the internal surface of the ramus of the mandible. It allows for divisions of the mandibular nerve and blood vessels to pass through.

=== Variation ===
There are two distinct anatomies to its rim.
* In the common form the rim is V-shaped, with a groove separating the anterior and posterior parts. 
* In the horizontal-oval form there is no groove, and the rim is horizontally oriented and oval in shape, the anterior and posterior parts connected.
Rarely, a bifid inferior alveolar nerve may be present, in which case a second mandibular foramen, more inferiorly placed, exists and can be detected by noting a doubled mandibular canal on a radiograph.

== Function ==
The mandibular nerve is one of three branches of the trigeminal nerve, and the only one having motor innervation. One branch of it, the inferior alveolar nerve, as well as the inferior alveolar artery, enter the foramen traveling through the body in the mandibular canal and exit at the mental foramen on the anterior mandible at which point the nerve is known as the mental nerve. These nerves provide sensory innervation to the lower teeth, as well as the lower lip and some skin on the lower face.

== Clinical significance ==
Local anaesthetic can be injected around the mandibular foramen to anaesthetise the mandibular nerve, and thereby the mandible the lower teeth on that side, and some skin on the lower face.

== Other animals ==
The mandibular foramen can be found in other mammals, such as horses.

<doc id="1245965" wikidata="Q325611" url="?curid=1245965" title="Homi J. Bhabha">
<text>Homi Jehangir Bhabha, FNI, FASc, FRS(30 October 1909 – 24 January 1966) was an Indian nuclear physicist who is widely credited as the &quot;father of the Indian nuclear programme&quot;. He was the founding director and professor of physics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), as well as the founding director of the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET) which was renamed the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in his honour. TIFR and AEET served as the cornerstone to the Indian nuclear energy and weapons programme. He was the first chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission and secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy. By supporting space science projects which initially derived their funding from the AEC, he played an important role in the birth of the Indian space programme.

Bhabha was awarded the Adams Prize (1942) and Padma Bhushan (1954), and nominated for the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1951 and 1953–1956. He died in the crash of Air India Flight 101 in 1966, at the age of 56. The mysterious circumstances of his death has led to the rise of several conspiracy theories claiming he was assassinated.

==Early life==

=== Childhood ===
Homi Jehangir Bhabha was born on 30 October 1909 into a wealthy Parsi family comprising Jehangir Hormusji Bhabha, a well-known lawyer, and Meherbai Framji Panday, granddaughter of Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit. He was named Hormusji after his paternal grandfather, Hormusji Bhabha, who was Inspector-General of Education in Mysore. He received his early studies at Mumbai&#x27;s Cathedral and John Connon School.

Bhabha&#x27;s upbringing instilled in him an appreciation for music, painting and gardening. He often visited his paternal aunt Meherbai Tata, who owned a Western classical music collection which included the works of Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn and Schubert. Together with his brother and his cousin, it was a ritual for him to listen to records from this collection over the gramophone. Bhabha also received special violin and piano lessons.

His tutor in sketching and painting was the artist Jehangir Lalkala. At seventeen, Bhabha&#x27;s self-portrait won second place at the prestigious Bombay Art Society&#x27;s exhibition.

Tending to a terrace garden of exotic plants and cross-bred bougainvillea and roses, Hormusji was an expert on trees, plants and flowers. He kept books on gardening in the house&#x27;s large private library.

Bhabha showed signs of precocity in the sciences. As a child, he spent hours playing with Meccano sets, and was fond of building his own models rather than following the booklets that accompanied the sets. By fifteen, he had studied general relativity.

Bhabha frequently visited the home of his uncle Dorabji Tata, chairman of the conglomerate Tata Group and then one of the wealthiest men in India. There, he was privy to conversations Dorabji had with national leaders of the independence movement, like Mahatma Gandhi and Motilal Nehru, as well as business dealings in industries like steel, heavy chemicals and hydroelectric power which the Tata Group invested in. John Cockcroft remarked that overhearing these conversations should have inspired Bhabha&#x27;s career as a scientific organizer.

=== University studies in India ===
Though he passed his Senior Cambridge Examination with honours at the age of fifteen, he was too young to join any college abroad. So, he enrolled in Elphinstone College. He then attended the Royal Institute of Science in 1927, where he witnessed a public lecture by Arthur Compton, who would win the Nobel Prize in physics the next year for his 1923 discovery of the Compton effect. Bhabha later said that he first heard of cosmic rays, the subject of his future research, at this lecture.

=== University studies in Cambridge ===
The following year, he joined Gonville and Caius College of Cambridge University. This was due to the insistence of his father and his uncle Dorabji, who planned for Bhabha to obtain a degree in mechanical engineering from Cambridge and then return to India, where he would join the Tata Steel mills in Jamshedpur as a metallurgist.
Within a year of joining Cambridge University, Bhabha wrote to his father:I seriously say to you that business or job as an engineer is not the thing for me. It is totally foreign to my nature and radically opposed to my temperament and opinions. Physics is my line. I know I shall do great things here. For, each man can do best and excel in only that thing of which he is passionately fond, in which he believes, as I do, that he has the ability to do it, that he is in fact born and destined to do it … I am burning with a desire to do physics. I will and must do it sometime. It is my only ambition. I have no desire to be a &quot;successful&quot; man or the head of a big firm. There are intelligent people who like that and let them do it. … It is no use saying to Beethoven &quot;You must be a scientist for it is great thing&quot; when he did not care two hoots for science; or to Socrates &quot;Be an engineer; it is work of intelligent man&quot;. It is not in the nature of things. I therefore earnestly implore you to let me do physics.Sympathetic to his son&#x27;s predicament, Bhabha&#x27;s father agreed to finance his studies in mathematics provided that he obtain first class on his Mechanical Tripos. Bhabha sat the Mechanical Tripos in June 1930 and the Mathematics Tripos two years later, passing both with first-class honours.

Bhabha coxed for his college in boat races and designed the cover of his college magazine the &quot;Caian&quot;. He also designed the sets for a student performance of Pedro Calderón de la Barca&#x27;s play &quot;Life is a Dream&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot; for the Cambridge Musical Society. Encouraged by the English artist and art critic Roger Fry, who praised his sketches, Bhabha seriously considered becoming an artist. However, exposure to work being done at the Cavendish Laboratory at the time motivated Bhabha to focus on theoretical physics. When he registered as a research student in mathematics, he decided to change his name to Homi Jehangir Bhabha, the name he would keep for the rest of his life.

== Early research in nuclear physics ==
Bhabha worked at the Cavendish Laboratory while working towards his PhD degree in theoretical physics supervised by Ralph Fowler. At the time, the laboratory was the centre of several breakthroughs in experimental physics. James Chadwick had discovered the neutron, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton had transmuted lithium with high-energy protons, Francis Aston had discovered chemical isotopes, and Patrick Blackett and Giuseppe Occhialini had used cloud chambers to demonstrate the production of electron pairs and showers by gamma radiation.

In 1931, Bhabha held the Salomons studentship in engineering. In 1932, on a Rouse Ball travelling studentship, he visited Copenhagen, Zurich and Utretcht. Niels Bohr&#x27;s institute at Copenhagen was a major hub of theoretical physics research. At Zurich, Bhabha wrote his first paper in July 1933 with Wolfgang Pauli, which was published in the &quot;Zeitschrift fur physik&quot; in October 1933. During his studentship, Bhabha also visited Hans Kramers, who was then a professor conducting theoretical research in the interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter at Utrecht University. In 1933, Bhabha was selected for the Isaac Newton scholarship, which he held for the next three years and used to fund his time working with Enrico Fermi at the Institute of Physics in Rome. The same year, Bhabha published his first paper on the role of electron showers in absorbing gamma radiation.

The discovery of the positron in 1932 and the formulation of Dirac&#x27;s hole theory to explain its properties had catalysed the creation of the field of high-energy physics. Bhabha chose to make this field the focus of his career, publishing over fifty papers on the topic during his lifetime. He played a key role in the early development of quantum electrodynamics.

Bhabha received his doctorate in nuclear physics in 1935 for his thesis titled &quot;On cosmic radiation and the creation and annihilation of positrons and electrons&quot;.

In 1935, Bhabha published a paper in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; in which he first calculated the cross-section of electron-positron scattering. Electron-positron scattering was later named Bhabha scattering after him.

In 1937, with Walter Heitler, he co-authored a paper, &quot;The passage of fast electrons and the theory of cosmic showers&quot; in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A&quot;, in which they used their theory to describe how primary cosmic rays from outer space interact with the upper atmosphere to produce particles observed at the ground level. Bhabha and Heitler then made numerical estimates of the number of electrons in the cascade process at different altitudes for different electron initiation energies. The calculations agreed with the experimental observations of cosmic ray showers made by Bruno Rossi and Pierre Victor Auger a few years before. Bhabha and Heitler postulated that the penetrating component of cosmic radiation comprised &quot;heavy electrons&quot;, most of which &quot;must have masses nearer to hundred times the electron mass&quot;. The paper was announced in a letter in &quot;Nature&quot;.

The same year, Seth Neddermeyer and Carl David Anderson, among others, also reached similar conclusions in independently published papers in &quot;Physical Review&quot;. Before pions were discovered, observers often confused muons with mesons. When Bhabha&#x27;s collaborator Heitler made him aware of Hideki Yukawa&#x27;s 1935 paper on the theory of the meson, Bhabha realized that this particle was the postulated &quot;heavy electron&quot;. In a 1939 note to &quot;Nature&quot;, Bhabha argued the particle should be christened the &quot;meson&quot; in line with the word&#x27;s Greek etymology, not &quot;mesotron&quot; as Anderson had proposed. Bhabha later concluded that observations of the properties of the meson would lead to the straightforward experimental verification of the time dilation phenomenon predicted by Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.

So far, Bhabha&#x27;s work had been supported by the Senior Studentship of the 1851 exhibition, which he had received for three years, starting in 1936, while continuing to be based in Gonville and Caius College. In 1939, Bhabha was awarded a Royal Society grant to work in P. M. S. Blackett&#x27;s laboratory in Manchester. However, when World War II broke out, Bhabha found himself unable to return to England to take up the assignment.

==Career==

=== Indian Institute of Science ===
Bhabha had returned to India for his annual vacation before the start of World War II in September 1939. War prompted him to remain in India, where he accepted a post of reader in physics at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru headed by Nobel laureate C.V. Raman. In 1940, the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust supported his experimental cosmic ray physics research with a grant.

Bhabha was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1941, and the following year he became the first Indian to receive the Adams Prize. Soon after receiving the Adams Prize, Bhabha was also made a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences and President of the Physics section of the Indian Sciences Congress. While introducing him at the 1941 Annual Meeting of the Indian Academy of Sciences, C.V. Raman described the 32-year-old Bhabha as &quot;the modern equivalent of Leonardo da Vinci&quot;. On 20 January 1942, Bhabha formally accepted professorship and leadership of the Cosmic Ray Research Unit.

As late as 1940, Bhabha was listing his affiliation as &quot;at present at the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore&quot;, suggesting that he viewed his time in India as a temporary period before his return to the UK. In 1941, he wrote to Robert Millikan that he hoped that the war would be over soon, so that &quot;we can all turn again in more favourable conditions to purely scientific activity&quot;. Though he had hoped to work in Caltech, it was impossible for Millikan to invite him there. The restrictions on finance imposed by the war also made it impossible for Wolfgang Pauli to invite Bhabha to Princeton.

During his time in Bengaluru, Bhabha met Vikram and Mrinalini Sarabhai as part of a group interested in Indian culture, and developed an appreciation for Indian architectural and artistic heritage on his tours around the country. In a 1944 letter, he expressed a change of mind and a desire to stay in India:I had the idea that after the war I would accept a job in a good university in Europe or America. … But in the last two years I have come more and more to the view that provided proper appreciation and financial support are forthcoming, it is one&#x27;s duty to stay in one&#x27;s own country.

=== Tata Institute of Fundamental Research ===

In 1943, Bhabha wrote to J. R. D. Tata proposing the establishment of an institute of fundamental research. Tata wrote back:If you and some of your friends in the scientific world will put up concrete proposals backed by a sound case I think there is a very good chance that the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust will respond. After all, the advancement of science of one of the fundamental objectives with which the Tata Trusts were founded, and they have already rendered useful service in that field. If they are shown that they can give still more valuable help in a new way, I am quite sure that they will give it their most serious consideration.
In a letter to the astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Bhabha described that his ambition was to &quot;bring together as many outstanding scientists as possible … so as to build up in time an intellectual atmosphere approaching what we knew in places like Cambridge and Paris.&quot; J. R. D. Tata&#x27;s enthusiasm encouraged Bhabha to send a proposal in March 1944 to Sir Sorab Saklavata, the chairman of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, for establishing a school dedicated to research in fundamental physics. In his proposal he wrote:
The trustees of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust decided to accept Bhabha&#x27;s proposal and financial responsibility for starting the Institute in April 1944. In June 1945, with a grant from the Trust, he established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. While TIFR began functioning in the Cosmic Ray Unit of the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, by October that year, it had moved to Bombay. TIFR initially operated in 6,000 square feet of the bungalow where Bhabha had been born, with Bhabha taking as his office the very room where he had been born. The institute was moved into the old buildings of the Royal Yacht club in 1948. In 1962, an art gallery designed the Chicago-based firm Holabird &amp; Root architect Helmuth Bartsch was inaugurated at TIFR.

Bombay was chosen as the location as the Government of Bombay showed interest in becoming a joint founder of the proposed institute. Inaugurating the Bombay premises in December 1945, the Governor of Bombay Sir John Colville said:We are embarking on an enterprise of importance to the country&#x27;s development, in which great wealth, wisely husbanded and applied, individual initiative and government support are all blended. I do not think there could be a better combination for progress.A former director of TIFR, M. G. K. Menon, said that the institute&#x27;s budget &quot;grew at the rate of about 30% per annum over the first ten years, and about 15% per annum over the second decade&quot;. By 1954, Bhabha had stopped publishing scientific papers but continued to carry out a range of administrative tasks aimed at growing TIFR.

Some of TIFR&#x27;s research groups focused on nuclear chemistry and metallurgy; these were later moved to Trombay to provide the basis for a 1958 plan to integrate nuclear energy into the national power grid. By 1954, the Institute contained an in-house electronics production unit. Under Bhabha&#x27;s leadership, the Institute established a research group under Bernard Peters&#x27; supervision to conduct research on cosmic rays, and later geophysics. This group was the first to identify K minus strange particles.

Bhabha remained the institute&#x27;s Director till his death in 1966.

=== India&#x27;s nuclear energy programme ===

==== Atomic Energy Commission ====
On 26 April 1948, Bhabha wrote to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that &quot;the development of atomic energy should be entrusted to a very small and high-powered body composed of say three people with executive power, and answerable directly to the Prime Minister without any intervening link. For brevity, this body may be referred to as the Atomic Energy Commission.&quot; Pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was established on 10 August 1948. Nehru appointed Bhabha as the commission&#x27;s first chairman. The three-member Commission included S. S. Bhatnagar and K. S. Krishnan. Bhabha, Bhatnagar and Krishnan were also named to the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Ministry of Defence created in July 1948. The details of the workings of the AEC were declared state secrets for two reasons according to Nehru: &quot;the advantage of our research would go to others before we even reaped it, and secondly it would become impossible for us to cooperate with any country which is prepared to cooperate with us in this matter, because it will not be prepared for the results of researches to become public.&quot;

The scholar George Perkovich argues that due to this secrecy and the AEC&#x27;s relative freedom from government control, the &quot;Nehru-Bhabha relationship constituted the only potentially real mechanism to check and balance the nuclear programme&quot;. Yet, rather than being &quot;watchful and balancing&quot;, the relationship was &quot;friendly and symbiotic&quot;. Twenty years younger than Nehru, Bhabha addressed him as &quot;Dear Bhai&quot;, or &quot;Dear Brother&quot;, while Nehru addressed Bhabha as &quot;My dear Homi&quot;. Indira Gandhi later recalled that her father always found the time to speak to Bhabha, both because, she claimed, Bhabha brought to him urgent matters that required immediate attention, and because conversations with him afforded Nehru &quot;warm moments of sensitivity that other people take for granted in their everyday life&quot;, but which are harder to come by in the life of a politician.

When Bhabha realised that technology development for the atomic energy programme could no longer be carried out within TIFR he proposed to the government to build a new laboratory entirely devoted to this purpose. For this purpose, of land was acquired at Trombay from the Bombay Government. Thus, the Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay (AEET) started functioning in 1954. The same year, Bhabha was appointed the secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) under the direct charge of the Prime Minister. Atomic Energy was established as a separate ministry, where earlier the AEC fell under the umbrella of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Scientific Research.

In a 1957 paper in &quot;Nature&quot; summarizing the Indian nuclear energy programme&#x27;s ambitions and work, Bhabha claimed that &quot;[a]lthough the Atomic Energy Commission was established as an advisory body in 1948 in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Scientific Research, no important effort to develop this work was made until a separate department of the Government of India with the full powers of a ministry was established in August 1954.&quot; A former chairman of the AEC, H. N. Sethna, said that until the establishment of the DAE in 1954, &quot;the work of the Atomic Energy Commission had been restricted to the survey of radioactive minerals, setting up plants for processing monazite and limited research activity in the area of electronics, methods of chemical analysis of minerals and the recovery of valuable elements from available minerals.&quot;

At the DAE, Bhabha maintained relative autonomy over priority-setting, and throughout the 1950s and the early 1960s, nuclear policy remained little-discussed in the Parliament and in public life.

==== Three-stage plan ====
Bhabha is credited with formulating a strategy of focusing on extracting power from the country&#x27;s vast thorium reserves rather than its meagre uranium reserves. He presented this plan to the Conference on the Development of Atomic Energy for Peaceful Purposes in New Delhi in November 1954. This thorium-focused strategy stood in marked contrast to all other countries in the world. It became formally adopted by the Indian government in 1958 as India&#x27;s three-stage nuclear power programme.

Bhabha paraphrased the three-stage approach as follows: 
In 1952, Indian Rare Earths Limited, a Government-owned company, was established to extract rare earths and thorium from Kerala&#x27;s monazite sands, with Bhabha serving as its director.

In August 1956, the one-megawatt &quot;swimming-pool&quot; research reactor APSARA was commissioned, making India the first Asian country besides the Soviet Union to have a nuclear reactor. Running on enriched natural uranium fuel supplied by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Commission and thorium, APSARA represented the first stage of Bhabha&#x27;s plan: it would be useful in producing plutonium. It also allowed Indian nuclear scientists to carry out experiments, whereas national research in atomic energy earlier had been largely theoretical. Bhabha was able to secure favourable terms for India partly due to his friendship with Sir John Cockcroft, who had been his colleague at the Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge.

That year, India and Canada signed an agreement for the construction of a natural uranium, heavy water-moderated National Research Experimental (NRX) reactor in Trombay. Bhabha&#x27;s personal friendship with WB Lewis, who headed the Canadian Atomic Energy Agency at the time, proved useful to securing the deal. The reactor, named the Canada India Reactor Utility Service (CIRUS), went critical on 10 July 1960. At forty megawatts, it was the highest-output reactor in Asia at the time, and India&#x27;s first plutonium source. CIRUS also served as the prototype of the successful Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactor type. The reactor&#x27;s low burn produced a large amount of weapons-grade plutonium, some of which was used in India&#x27;s 1974 peaceful nuclear explosion.

To supply CIRUS with heavy water, a heavy water plant with an output of 14 metric tonnes per year was commissioned in Nangal. It began operation on 2 August 1962.

In July 1958, Bhabha decided to build a plutonium reprocessing plant in Trombay. Construction of the Phoenix plant, based on the Purex (plutonium-uranium extraction) technique for extracting plutonium from spent fuel, began in 1961 and was completed in mid-1964. Paired with CIRUS, Phoenix produced India&#x27;s first weapons-grade plutonium in 1964.

Even after the establishment of APSARA, CIRUS, Phoenix and the indigenously produced zero-energy critical reactor ZERLINA, India hadn&#x27;t actually produced nuclear energy. To remedy this, in 1962, General Electric was commissioned to build two light water-moderated nuclear reactors in Tarapur. Because the Tarapur Atomic Power Stations (TAPS) were fueled by enriched uranium, they didn&#x27;t fit into Bhabha&#x27;s three-stage plan. The US&#x27; terms for the Tarapur deal, an $80 million loan at 0.75% interest, were highly favourable to India. Bhabha also managed to negotiate the limitation of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards to the TAPS facility. M. R. Srinivasan, former chairman of the AEC, remarked that Bhabha&#x27;s success in the Tarapur negotiation would have been a proud achievement for an experienced professional diplomat.

==== International Atomic Energy Agency ====

In the 1950s, Bhabha represented India in International Atomic Energy Agency conferences, and served as President of the United Nations Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva, Switzerland in 1955.

According to the IAEA&#x27;s 10 September 1956 draft statute, plutonium and other special fissionable materials would be deposited with the agency, which would have the discretion to provide states with quantities deemed suitable for nonmilitary use under safeguards. Bhabha successfully lobbied against the agency&#x27;s broad authority, arguing in a 27 September 1956 conference that it was the &quot;inalienable right of States to produce and hold the fissionable material required for the peaceful power programmes&quot;. The IAEA&#x27;s final statute required only safeguards on fissile materials and reactors to ensure these weren&#x27;t diverted to military use. Of Bhabha&#x27;s negotiating skills, the US Atomic Energy Commission chairman Glenn Seaborg said: &quot;He was not easy to argue with. Polite but very sure of himself, he was never at a loss for words, and was most articulate. He was a very imposing presence.&quot;

==== Allegations of developing nuclear explosives capability ====

Aware that the negotiated IAEA safeguards weren&#x27;t sufficient to deter a state from developing weapons capability, Bhabha had remarked in his 27 September 1957 speech at the IAEA:[T]here are many States, technically advanced, which may undertake with Agency aid, fulfilling all the present safeguards, but in addition run their own parallel programmes independently of the Agency in which they could use the experience and know-how obtained in Agency-aided projects, without being subject in any way to the system of safeguards.In December 1959, in light of concerns about a possible Chinese nuclear weapons programme, Bhabha claimed to the Parliamentary Consultative Committee on Atomic Energy that India&#x27;s nuclear energy research had progressed to the point where it could build nuclear weapons without external aid. In 1960, in a meeting with Nehru and Kenneth Nichols, who was visiting India as a consultant to Westinghouse, Bhabha estimated that it would take India &quot;about a year&quot; to build a nuclear bomb.

A 1964 US State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research report concluded that although there was no &quot;direct evidence&quot; of an Indian nuclear weapons programme and that it was &quot;unlikely&quot; that India had made a decision to pursue weapons capability, it was &quot;probably no accident&quot; that &quot;everything the Indians [had] done so far would be compatible with a weapons programme if at some future date it appeared desirable to start one&quot;.

A year after Bhabha&#x27;s death, at a memorial lecture held in his honour, John Cockcroft stated that &quot;it was a declared policy of the government of India not to develop nuclear weapons, and Homi Bhabha of course in his official pronouncements followed the policy of his government,&quot; but that Cockcroft &quot;always thought, from private discussions, that his attitude was somewhat ambivalent. After the Chinese nuclear bomb test, he certainly wished to put India into the position of being able to make plutonium bombs, if the government so desired.&quot;

However, M. G. K. Menon, the new director of TIFR, pushed back against Cockcroft&#x27;s statement, arguing that the motivation behind setting up the Indian plutonium reprocessing plant &quot;has sometimes been misunderstood&quot;. He said that because the decision to build the plant was taken before the 1962 Indo-China war, it could not have been built for security reasons and was purely for reprocessing fuel rods. However, Menon conceded that mistrust between the two nations had been public since 1950. India also had knowledge of the Chinese nuclear weapons program before the 1962 war.

In a 2006 interview, P. K. Iyengar, a former chairman of the AEC, was asked whether Bhabha was &quot;keen&quot; on India becoming a nuclear weapons state. In response, Iyengar stated: &quot;Dr Bhabha had in his mind from the very beginning that India should become a Nuclear Weapons State. His emphasis on self-reliance is essentially due to the fact he wanted India to be a nuclear weapons country.&quot;

==== Lobbying to build nuclear explosives ====
After the Chinese nuclear test on 16 October 1964, Bhabha began to publicly call for building nuclear explosives. On the other hand, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Nehru&#x27;s successor, sought security guarantees from the existing nuclear powers, while declaring at the Cairo Conference of Non-aligned Nations that India&#x27;s nuclear establishment was &quot;under firm orders not to make a single experiment, not to perfect a single device which is not needed for peaceful uses of atomic energy&quot;.

On a visit to London on 4 October 1964, anticipating the Chinese test, Bhabha said that India could conduct a nuclear test within a year and a half of a decision to do so, but that he did not &quot;think such a decision will be taken&quot;. A 28 October 1964 &quot;Indian Express&quot; survey found that public opinion leaders across India now took &quot;for granted&quot; Bhabha&#x27;s claim that India could develop a nuclear bomb within a year and a half. Yet, this figure was likely an overestimate. In 1996, Raja Ramanna, the physicist tasked in 1965 with directing the nuclear weapons project, said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think it would have been possible to do what Bhabha said—build a device in 18 months. A crash program could have been done, I suppose, but it would have been very expensive.&quot; By 1965, Bhabha had updated his estimate from eighteen months to at least five years.

About a week after the Chinese test, Bhabha said in an All India Radio broadcast:Atomic weapons give a State possessing them in adequate numbers a deterrent power against attack from a much stronger State. … A two megaton explosion, i.e., one equivalent to 2 million tons of TNT, would cost $600,000 or Rs. 30 lakhs. On the other hand, at current prices of TNT, 2 million tons of it would cost some Rs. 150 crores [$300 million]. This cost estimate ignored the expenses on reactors, reprocessing facilities and infrastructure necessary to design and produce weapons. Nevertheless, despite efforts by the US government and other Indian scientists to correct this estimate, Bhabha&#x27;s arguments supporting the affordability of a nuclear weapons programme continued to be used by the Indian pro-bomb lobby. On 26 October 1964, the Hindu nationalist Jana Sangh editorialized: &quot;We had the chance to do it [detonate a nuclear bomb] before China did it and so we could tell that we meant business and that we were ahead of China. In our criminal folly we missed it.&quot;

A 29 October 1964 US Embassy cable cited an informed source from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs as saying that &quot;pressures within GOI [Government of India] for India to develop its own bomb were building up&quot; and that &quot;Bhabha was the leading advocate for this group and he was actively campaigning to go down nuclear the road&quot;. A six-hour cabinet discussion of nuclear policy had culminated in the Minister of External Affairs Swaran Singh and the influential Minister of Railways S. K. Patil supporting Bhabha, who was attending as an observer, in his proposal for a nuclear weapon-building program. Only two cabinet ministers were against. Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Nehru&#x27;s successor, authorized Bhabha to &quot;come up with estimate of what was involved in India&#x27;s attempting an underground &#x27;explosion&#x27;.&quot;

This repudiated Shastri&#x27;s policy preferences, who, as a Gandhian, showed a strong moral revulsion to building nuclear weapons, and did not wish to increase defence spending during the nation&#x27;s ongoing food crisis. Shastri sought British assistance in making more objective cost estimates. In a November 1964 All India Congress Committee meeting, he disputed Bhabha&#x27;s numbers, arguing that the production of a single nuclear bomb would cost Rs 400 to 500 million, more than two hundred times Bhabha&#x27;s estimate. In a remark likely aimed at Bhabha&#x27;s All India Radio broadcast, Shastri added that &quot;scientists should realise that it was the responsibility of the Government to defend the country and adopt appropriate measures&quot;. Beyond economic considerations, he warned that with the development of an initial weapons capability, India &quot;could not be content with one or two bombs. The spirit of competition was bound to capture her&quot;. As &quot;the majority of speakers [had come] out strongly and frankly in favour of India manufacturing atom bombs&quot; at the meeting, the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; called Shastri&#x27;s successful opposing address &quot;nothing short of a miracle&quot;. After Shastri&#x27;s address, Bhabha clarified that his figures came from an American study on &quot;the peaceful uses of atomic explosions&quot; for civil engineering projects, but maintained that nuclear explosive power could be cost-effective.

On 23 and 24 November 1964, when the Lok Sabha met to discuss India&#x27;s foreign policy, speakers generally assumed that Bhabha&#x27;s eighteen-month timeline for building a nuclear bomb was accurate, and did not suggest that a Soviet or US nuclear umbrella would extend over India in case of a nuclear attack. Ultimately, in part due to uncertainty around the cost of developing a nuclear bomb and its appropriate delivery platforms, the Parliament deferred a decision for or against nuclear weapons. The parliamentarians moved instead to speed the development of technology and know-how which would enable them to establish a nuclear weapons programme if they later decided to do so. Shastri hedged, though, that this policy was subject to change:I cannot say that the present policy is deep-rooted, that it cannot be set aside, that it can never be changed. … Here situations alter, changes take place, and we have to mould our policies accordingly. If there is a need to amend what we have said today, then we will say—all right, let us go ahead and do so. Historians have argued that this marked the beginning of India&#x27;s policy of keeping a &quot;nuclear option&quot;.

On 27 November 1964, the Jana Sangh introduced a motion in the Lok Sabha calling for the development of nuclear weapons. Shastri, reiterating his moral stand for nuclear disarmament, won a voice vote against the motion. However, he reminded the Parliament that the manufacture of nuclear weapons could be completed in &quot;two or three years&quot; if necessary. Then, for the first time, he said that India&#x27;s work on nuclear energy for nonmilitary use would include the development of peaceful nuclear explosives, which he called &quot;nuclear devices&quot;:Dr. Bhabha has made it quite clear to me that as far as we can progress and improve upon nuclear devices, we should do so, as far as development is possible, we should resort to it so that we can reap its peaceful benefits and we can use it for the development of our nation. … Just assume that we have to use big tunnels and we have to clear huge areas, we have to wipe out mountains for development parks, and in this context if it is required to use nuclear devices for the good of the country as well as for the good of the world, so then our Atomic Energy Commission is pursuing these same objectives.Shastri&#x27;s announcement of a program to develop peaceful nuclear explosives fell short of sanctioning an explicit nuclear weapons programme. However, though intended for different purposes, the two kinds of devices are technically similar. Speaking to the Press Trust of India in 1997, Raja Ramanna said:The Pokhran test was a bomb, I can tell you now. … An explosion is an explosion, a gun is a gun, whether you shoot at someone or shoot at the ground. … I just want to make clear that the test was not all that peaceful.Ramanna speculated that the Shastri endorsement of peaceful nuclear explosive research &quot;must have come from Bhabha&quot;. In an interview with the scholar George Perkovich in 1997, Homi Sethna, a former AEC chairman, agreed that Bhabha had prompted this statement, though he added that &quot;Bhabha was able to obtain approval to do theoretical studies only&quot;. Historians have interpreted the shift in Shastri&#x27;s no-bomb position as a concession to the pro-bomb officials within the Congress party and an attempt to win Bhabha&#x27;s support, which could shield Shastri against further attacks on nuclear policy in the Parliament. The new nuclear policy of doing theoretical research on peaceful nuclear explosives also avoided the large economic costs and international recriminations that would follow a full-fledged nuclear weapons programme.

The concession apparently did win Bhabha&#x27;s alignment. After the 1965 Indo-Pakistani war, pressure to build nuclear weapons intensified as the threat from Pakistan introduced new security concerns. Rather than using the renewed political debate to gain additional authorizations, Bhabha denied in an interview that he had received any new instructions from Shastri, saying: &quot;The emergency changed nothing. Why should it?&quot; Historians have interpreted Bhabha&#x27;s comments as an indication that the constraint to building nuclear explosives was not policy, but unmet technological requirements.

After realizing that the eighteen-month timeline for building nuclear weapons capability was too ambitious, Bhabha held several meetings with US officials in secret between 1964 and 1965. In these, he explored the option of importing nuclear explosive capability, especially fissile plutonium and designs of a nuclear device, from the US Atomic Energy Commission as part of Project Plowshare. However, with the emergence of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, this option eventually closed. After Bhabha&#x27;s death, dissatisfied with the NPT&#x27;s refusal to meet India&#x27;s security concerns, scientists at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and the Defence Research and Development Organization began work on the nuclear device used in the 1974 Pokhran test.

== Interest in and patronage of the arts ==
A classical music and opera enthusiast, Bhabha pushed for Vienna to be the headquarters of the IAEA in part to be able to attend the state opera when attending IAEA meetings. According to his brother Jamshed Bhabha,For Homi Bhabha, the arts were not just a form of recreation or pleasant relaxation; they were among the most serious pursuits of life and he attached just as much importance to them as to his work in mathematics and physics. For him, the arts were, in his own words, &#x27;what made life worth living&#x27;.Bhabha was an avid painter, decorating his house with abstracts he painted during the 1930s in England. He was a key patron of the Progressive Artists’ Group, formed in Bombay in 1947 to establish new ways of expressing India&#x27;s post-colonial identity. This group produced artists like F. N. Souza, M. F. Husain, Tyeb Mehta, K. H. Ara and S. H. Raza, some of whose early works Bhabha selected for the TIFR collection. Unique among scientific institutions around the world, TIFR still hosts a large collection of contemporary Indian art, which was opened to the public in 2018.

== Awards and honours ==
Bhabha&#x27;s doctoral thesis won him the Adams Prize in 1942, making him the first Indian to receive the honour. This was followed by a Hopkins Prize by the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1948.

He gained international prominence after deriving a correct expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons, a process now known as Bhabha scattering. His major contributions included work on Compton scattering, R-process, and the advancement of nuclear physics. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1951 and 1953–1956.

He was awarded Padma Bhushan, India&#x27;s third-highest civilian honour, in 1954. In 1957, he was elected an honorary fellow of Gonville and Caius College and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958, and appointed the President of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics from 1960 to 1963. Bhabha received several honorary doctoral degrees in science throughout his career: Patna (1944), Lucknow (1949), Banaras (1950), Agra (1952), Perth (1954), Allahabad (1958), Cambridge (1959), London (1960) and Padova (1961).

==Death==
On 24 January 1966, Bhabha was on board Air India Flight 101, a Boeing 707-420, when it crashed near Mont Blanc in a controlled flight terrain while trying to land at Geneva Airport. All 106 passengers, including Bhabha, and 11 crew members died in the crash. A misunderstanding between Geneva Airport ATC and the pilots about the aircraft position near the mountain was noted to be the official reason of the crash. 

In a ceremony mourning his death, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi quoted:To lose Dr Homi Bhabha at this crucial moment in the development of our atomic energy programme is a terrible blow for our nation. He had his most creative years ahead of him. When we take up the unfinished work he has left behind, we will realize in how many fields he served us. For me, it is a personal loss. I shall miss his wide-ranging mind and many talents, his determination to strengthen our country’s science and enthusiastic interest in life’s many facets. We mourn a great son of India.

===Assassination claims===
Many possible theories have been advanced for the air crash, including a claim that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was involved in paralysing India&#x27;s nuclear program. An Indian diplomatic bag containing calendars and a personal letter was recovered near the crash site in 2012.

Gregory Douglas, a journalist, conspiracy theorist, forger, and holocaust denier who claimed to have conducted telephone conversations with former CIA operative Robert Crowley in 1993, published a book titled &quot;Conversations with the Crow&quot; in 2013. According to Douglas, Crowley claimed that the CIA was responsible for assassinating Homi Bhabha and Prime Minister Shastri in 1966, thirteen days apart, to thwart India&#x27;s nuclear programme. Douglas asserted that Crowley told him a bomb in the cargo section of the plane exploded mid-air, bringing down the commercial Boeing 707 airliner in Alps with few traces. Per Douglas, Crowley said: &quot;We could have blown it up over Vienna but we decided the high mountains were much better for the bits and pieces to come down on&quot;. Conspiracy theorists point to the circumstances surrounding the death of Vikram Sarabhai, who showed no signs of illness prior to his death from a heart attack and was cremated without autopsy, as additional evidence of foreign involvement.

==Legacy==
Bhabha is considered the &quot;father of the Indian nuclear programme&quot; and one of the most prominent scientists in the country&#x27;s history. After his death, the Atomic Energy Establishment at Mumbai was renamed the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in his honour. In 1967, TIFR showcased an exhibition of Bhabha&#x27;s life at the Royal Society, which was later moved to TIFR&#x27;s auditorium foyer. The auditorium was named the Homi Bhabha Auditorium in the late scientist&#x27;s honour and inaugurated by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 9 November 1968. Bhabha encouraged research in electronics, space science, microbiology and radio astronomy. The radio telescope in Ooty, India, which is one of the world&#x27;s largest steerable telescopes, was built at Bhabha&#x27;s initiative in 1970. A number of research institutes received their initial funding from the Department of Atomic Energy under Bhabha&#x27;s supervision, including the Tata Memorial Hospital, the Indian Cancer Research Centre, the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics and the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad. As a member of the Indian Cabinet&#x27;s Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet, Bhabha played a key role in helping Vikram Sarabhai set up the Indian National Committee for Space Research.

The Homi Bhabha Fellowship Council has been giving Homi Bhabha Fellowships since 1967. Other noted institutions in his name are the Homi Bhabha National Institute, an Indian-deemed university and the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, Mumbai, India.

At Bhabha&#x27;s death, his estate, including &quot;Mehrangir&quot;, the sprawling colonial bungalow at Malabar Hill where he spent most of his life, was inherited by his brother Jamshed Bhabha. Jamshed, an avid patron of arts and culture, bequeathed the bungalow and its contents to the National Centre for the Performing Arts, which auctioned the property for Rs 372 crores in 2014 to raise funds for upkeep and development of the centre. The bungalow was demolished in June 2016 by the owner, Smita-Crishna Godrej of the Godrej family, despite some efforts to have it preserved as a memorial to Homi Bhabha.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Rocket Boys&quot; (2022) is a web series inspired by the lives of Homi J. Bhabha, Vikram Sarabhai and A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, in which Bhabha is played by Jim Sarbh. In 2023, the second season was released.

<doc id="1245971" wikidata="Q2444856" url="?curid=1245971" title="Taurus Raging Bull">
<text>The Raging Bull is a DA/SA, large-frame revolver manufactured by the Brazilian Taurus International firearm company beginning in 1997. The Raging Bull has a dual-locking design built on a heavy frame, allowing the revolver to easily fire extremely powerful loads. Because of the powerful nature of these handguns, the Raging Bull has a ported barrel and a cushioned rubber grip to mitigate harsh recoil. As of 2024, it is the most powerful revolver line ever offered by Taurus.

It was chambered for a number of powerful cartridges, notably the .44 Magnum and .454 Casull, however many other powerful chamberings were offered, including the .41 Magnum, .480 Ruger, .218 Bee, .22 Hornet and .30 Carbine. The Raging Bull line was discontinued in 2019, however, that same year it was replaced by the Raging Hunter line. The Raging Hunter series is identical, however it offers a built-in Picatinny rail for scope-mounting. The Raging Hunter series is chambered in .500 S&amp;W Magnum, .454 Casull, .44 Magnum, .357 Magnum and .460 S&amp;W Magnum, which is a new offering for Taurus.

==Design==
In order to highlight the strength and power of the revolver, the line was originally named &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, as both a reference to the legendary boxer Jake LaMotta, but also a reference to the Taurus constellation, the company&#x27;s namesake. The &quot;Raging&quot; line is marketed as a hunter&#x27;s sidearm because it is a potent weapon with plenty of stopping power. The .454 Casull cartridge has been used to hunt animals as large as Cape Buffalo. 

Prior to the Raging Hunter, most Raging Bull variants could still mount commercial optical sights and lasers with the aid of an optional screw-on Picatinny rail. The Raging Bull line also features a distinctive red backstrap on the rubber grip that reduces felt recoil. However, the smaller chamberings (the Raging Hornet, Raging Bee and Raging Thirty) have yellow rubber insert strips instead. Finishes offered for the Raging Bull line include stainless steel, matte stainless steel, nickel-plated, polished blued and matte black. Barrel options on the Raging Bull included 2&quot;, 4&quot;, 6&quot;, 8&quot;, 10&quot;. All models have ported barrels, except for the 22H, 30C, 513, 528 and Ultralite. All models also have fixed front sights and adjustable rear sights.

Functionally, the Raging Bull has a manually operated front cylinder latch (similar to a Dan Wesson revolver), and the front release is located on the crane. Front cylinder latches are required for such high-powered double-action revolvers and are found on the Ruger Super Redhawk and the S&amp;W Model 500 revolver, but, unlike the Raging line, are actuated by the rear cylinder latch, which performs two functions. The manually operated latch on the Raging Bull is equally strong but simpler (and thus less expensive to produce) but requires two hands to open the cylinder.

=== Raging Hunter ===
In 2019, the Raging Bull was replaced by the Raging Hunter, which is identical, but has a tougher finish and a focus on hunting, evidenced by the built-in accessory rail. The Raging Hunter is a series of revolvers developed by Taurus in 2019, chambered for .357 Magnum, .38 Special +P and .44 Magnum. A .454 Casull variant was created in 2020, and another for .460 S&amp;W Magnum in 2021. The Raging Hunter in .460 offers a two-tone 10.5&quot; barrel variant with a built-in muzzle brake, fiber optic front and rear sights and a bottom Picatinny rail. The Raging Hunter won &quot;handgun of the year in American Hunter&#x27;s 2019 Golden Bullseye Awards.&quot; Raging Hunter revolvers are fitted with a Picatinny rail, and may have a barrel length of , , or , allowing for an overall length of , , or , respectively. The Raging Hunter weighs .

<text>The retromolar space or retromolar gap is a space at the rear of the mandible, between the back of the last molar and the anterior edge of the ascending ramus where it crosses the alveolar margin. 

This gap is generally small or absent in modern humans, but it was more often present in Neanderthals, and it was common among some prehistoric Amerindians, such as Arikara and Mandan.

==Retromolar pad==
The retromolar area of a human mandible is covered by the retromolar pad (also known as the piriformis papilla), an elevated triangular area of mucosa. It is composed of non-keratinized loose alveolar tissue covering glandular tissues and muscle fibers. It is important for supporting lower complete and partial dentures as well as landmarking in the fabrication of dentures.

<text>Ziauddin Sardar (; born 31 October 1951) is a British-Pakistani scholar, award-winning writer, cultural critic and public intellectual who specialises in Muslim thought, the future of Islam, futurology Critique of modernity, postmodernism and since and cultural relations. He has written and edited more than 60 books &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine named him as one of Britain&#x27;s top 100 public intellectuals and &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper called him: &#x27;Britain&#x27;s own Muslim polymath&#x27;.

==Brief biography==
Ziauddin Sardar was born in Dipalpur, Punjab, Pakistan. However, he was both educated and brought up in Britain. His family belonged to the Pashtun warrior clan of Durrani that founded the state that ultimately became Afghanistan after the break-up of Persia following the assassination of Nader Shah in 1747. Under the Raj, it was official policy to recruit the so-called &quot;martial races&quot; from what is now modern northern India, Pakistan and Nepal into the military. His grandfather served in the Indian Army under the Raj, was decorated for bravery during the Boxer Rebellion in China, and the family&#x27;s surname was changed from Durrani to Sardar, Urdu for Leader, in recognition of his courage in leading men under fire. Sardar&#x27;s grandfather also served under William Birdwood when he was a junior officer in the Indian Army, and when his son immigrated to Britain, he sought out the company of Birdwood&#x27;s son, Christopher and his daughter-in-law, Lady Birdwood.

Ziauddin Sardar, when growing up in 1960s London, was lectured by Lady Birdwood on his English. In 1968, she tried to recruit him into her anti-immigration crusade, arguing that having a Muslim Pakistani immigrant writing for her magazine, &quot;New Times&quot;, would dispel the charges of racism being made against her. Sardar recalled speaking with fury as he rejected her offer, causing her to storm out of his family&#x27;s house, never to return. Sardar was bullied as a teenager by &quot;Paki-bashing&quot; white youths, and he imagined Lady Birdwood as a &quot;churail&quot;, the seductive, but ferocious female demons of Urdu folklore. Sardar argued that Lady Birdwood with her thesis that to be British was to be white was not &quot;aberration&quot; in British life, but rather was she was the &quot;quintessence&quot; of Britishness. Referring to Lady Birdwood&#x27;s convictions in the 1990s for writing, printing and handing out anti-Semitic literature, Sarder wrote: &quot;Racism as overt as that preached by all her hate literature is merely the flip side of the Great Tradition, the underlying, but unstated message of the &#x27;Great Books of Mankind&#x27; that I read in my childhood. It is the notion of civilization as a one-way street, an inexorable path of progress that must take all peoples towards the same pinnacle, by the same route&quot;.        

He read physics and then information science at the City University, London. After a five-year stint at King Abdul Aziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia – where he became a leading authority on the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca —– he returned to work as Middle East correspondent of the science magazines &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;New Scientist&quot;. In 1982, he joined London Weekend Television as a reporter and helped launch the trend-setting Asian programme &quot;Eastern Eye&quot;. In the early 1980s, he was among the founders of &quot;Inquiry&quot;, a magazine of ideas and policy focusing on Muslim countries, which played a major part in promoting reformist thought in Islam. While editing &quot;Inquiry&quot;, he established the Center for Policy and Futures Studies at East-West University in Chicago.

In 1987 Sardar moved to Kuala Lumpur as an advisor to Anwar Ibrahim, the Education Minister. Ibrahim went on to become Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia and following his imprisonment on abuse of power charges, the leader of the Opposition. He came back to London in the late 1990s to work as Visiting Professor of Science Studies at Middlesex University, and write for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, where he later became a columnist. In 1999, he was appointed editor of &quot;Futures&quot;, the monthly journal of policy, planning and futurology, and became involved in &quot;Third Text&quot;, the prestigious journal of arts and visual culture, which he co-edited till 2005. Also in 1999, he moved to the City University London, London, as Visiting Professor of Postcolonial Studies. From 2001 to 2013, he was Professor of Law and Society in the School of Law at Middlesex University.

After leaving London Weekend Television, Sardar wrote and presented a number of programmes for the BBC and Channel 4. He conceived and presented &quot;Encounters With Islam&quot; for the BBC in 1983, and two years later his 13-half-hour interview series &quot;Faces of Islam&quot; was broadcast on TV3 (Malaysia) and other channels in Asia. In 1990, he wrote and presented a programme on Islamic science for BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antenna&quot; and his six-part &quot;Islamic Conversations&quot; was broadcast on Channel 4 early in 1995. He wrote and presented the highly acclaimed &quot;Battle for Islam&quot;, a 90-minute film for BBC2 in 2005. And followed that with &quot;Between the Mullahs and the Military&quot;, a 50-minute documentary on Pakistan for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot; series. Most recently he wrote the three-part one-hour documentary &quot;The Life of Muhammad&quot; for BBC2, broadcast in July 2011. He has appeared on numerous television programmes, including the &quot;Andrew Marr Show&quot; and &quot;Hard Talk&quot;, and was a regular member of the &#x27;Friday Panel&#x27; on Sky News &quot;World News Tonight&quot; during 2006 and 2007. He appears in various filmed philosophical debates at the Institute of Art and Ideas.

Sardar was amongst the first Commissioners of the UK&#x27;s Equality and Human Rights Commission (March 2005 – December 2009); and served as a Member of the Interim National Security Forum at the Cabinet Office, London, during 2009 and 2010. His journalism and reviews have appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, the UK weekly magazine, &quot;New Statesman&quot; and the monthly magazine &quot;New Internationalist&quot;. Sardar&#x27;s online work includes a year-long project for the Guardian, &#x27;Blogging the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;, published in 2008.

In 2009, Sardar re-launched the defunct Muslim Institute as a learned society that supports and promotes the growth of thought, knowledge, research, creativity and open debate; and became the Chair of the reorganized Muslim Institute Trust. He conceived and launched, in 2011, the quarterly &quot;Critical Muslim&quot;, a ground-breaking journal of freethinking that seeks new readings of Islam and Muslim culture, jointly published by the Muslim Institute and Hurst &amp; Co.

In 2012, he launched the influential quarterly, &quot;Critical Muslim&quot;, which is published by Hurst Publishers and the Muslim Institute, as a paperback book. In 2014, Sardar established the The Center for Postnormal Policy and Futures Studies, which focuses more acutely on his recent work on Postnormal Times.

National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C1672/32) with Ziauddin Sardar in 2016 for its Science and Religion collection held by the British Library.

==Life and thought==
Sardar has lived the life of a scholar-adventurer and has travelled extensively throughout the world. From 1974 to 1979, he lived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he worked for the Hajj Research Centre at the King Abdul Aziz University. During this period he travelled throughout the Islamic world researching his first book, &quot;Science, Technology and Development in the Muslim World&quot; (Croom Helm, 1977). In the early 1980s, he edited the pioneering Muslim magazine &#x27;Inquiry&#x27;, before establishing the Centre for Policy and Futures Studies at East-West University in Chicago. During the 1990s, he lived in Kuala Lumpur. He has also lived in Chicago and The Hague and for short periods in Cairo and Fez.

Sardar describes himself as a &#x27;critical polymath&#x27;. His thought is characterised by a strong accent on diversity, pluralism and dissenting perspectives. Science journalist Ehsan Masood suggests that Sardar &#x27;deliberately cultivates a carefully calculated ambiguity projecting several things at once, yet none of them on their own&#x27;. Futurist Tony Stevenson points out that his &#x27;intellectual aggression&#x27; hides a &#x27;sincere and deep humanity&#x27;: &#x27;while his cultural analysis is surgically incisive, it is largely free of the theoretical correctness of academic thought&#x27;, while he &#x27;draws on a depth of academic thought&#x27;, he &#x27;always remains accessible&#x27;.

The fundamental principle of Sardar&#x27;s thought is that &#x27;there is more than one way to be human&#x27;. &#x27;I do not regard &quot;the human&quot; either as &quot;the&quot; or as a priori given&#x27;, he has said. &#x27;The western way of being human is one amongst many. Similarly, the Islamic way of being human is also one amongst many. The Australian aboriginal way of being human is also another way of being human. I see each culture as a complete universe with its own way of knowing, being and doing – and hence, its own way of being human&#x27;. The corollary is that there are also different ways of knowing. The question that Sardar has always asked is: &#x27;how do you know? The answer depends a great deal on who &#x27;you&#x27; are: &#x27;how you look at the world, how you shape your inquiry, the period and culture that shapes your outlook and the values that frame how you think&#x27;.

He has produced some fifty books over a period of 30 years, some with his long-time co-author Merryl Wyn Davies. These books include the classic studies &quot;The Future of Muslim Civilisation&quot; (1979) and &quot;Islamic Futures: The Shape of Ideas to Come&quot; (1985), a vigorous intellectual assault on postmodern thought, &quot;Postmodernism and the Other&quot; (1998) and &quot;Orientalism&quot; (1999), and the international bestseller &quot;Why Do People Hate America?&quot; (2002). He has published two books on cities: The Consumption of Kuala Lumpur (2000) and &quot;Mecca: The Sacred City&quot;, which won the first prize at the Lahore Literature Festival in 2014 and the Ramnath Goenka Award for Excellence in Journalism for a non-fiction book. Two collections of his essays and critical writings are available as readers: Islam, &quot;Postmodernism and Other Futures: A Ziauddin Sardar Reader&quot; (2003) and &quot;How Do You Know? Reading Ziauddin Sardar on Islam, Science and Cultural Relations&quot; (2006). His two volumes of autobiography, &quot;Desperately Seeking Paradise: Journeys of a Sceptical Muslim&quot; and &quot;Balti Britain: A Provocative Journey Through Asian Britain&quot;, have been highly praised. He wrote &quot;Reading the Qur’an&quot;.

Sardar was the editor of the journal &quot;Futures&quot; from 1999 to 2012.

<text>Janet Cardiff (born March 15, 1957) is a Canadian artist who works chiefly with sound and sound installations, often in collaboration with her husband and partner George Bures Miller. Cardiff first gained international recognition in the art world for her audio walks in 1995. She lives and works in British Columbia, Canada.

==Early life and education==
Janet Cardiff was born in 1957 in Brussels, Ontario, Canada, and grew up on a farm outside of a small village. In 1980, she earned her BFA from Queens University, Kingston, Ontario. In 1983 she earned an MVA from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. While studying in Edmonton, she met George Bures Miller who would become her husband and collaborator. Cardiff&#x27;s training is in photography and printmaking and her early works were large-scale silkscreens. Her first artistic collaboration with Bures Miller, in 1983, was a Super-8 film called &quot;The Guardian Angel&quot;. After this filmmaking experience, Cardiff&#x27;s work began to include elements of narrative sequencing, experiments with sound, and movement.

==Solo works==
Her first major work based on recorded sound was called &quot;The Whispering Room&quot;, a minimal work consisting of a dark space with 16 small round speakers mounted on stands that play the voice of individual characters. As visitors move through the space and the voices, a film projector is triggered playing a slightly slow-motion film.

Some of Cardiff&#x27;s most well-known solo works are her audio walks. Her first was created somewhat serendipitously during a residency at the Banff Centre in 1991. In 1996, she was asked to create a site-specific piece for the museum grounds at Louisiana Museum in Denmark. Since then, she has created notable walks such as &quot;Her Long Black Hair&quot; (2004), in and around Central Park, and &quot;Words Drawn in Water&quot; (2005) for the Hirshhorn Museum.

Cardiff has been included in exhibitions such as Present Tense, Nine Artists in the Nineties, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, NowHere, Louisiana Museum, Denmark, The Museum as Muse, Museum of Modern Art, the Carnegie International &#x27;99/00, the Tate Modern Opening Exhibition as well as a project commissioned by Artangel in London. This project (&quot;The Missing Voice (Case Study B)&quot;) was commissioned in 1999 and continues to run. It is an audio tour that leaves from the Whitechapel Library, next to the Whitechapel tube stop and snakes its way through London&#x27;s East End, weaving fictional narrative with descriptions about the actual landscape. Cardiff represented Canada at the São Paulo Art Biennial in 1998, and at the 6th Istanbul Biennial in 1999 with her partner George Bures Miller.

In her &quot;Forty Part Motet&quot; (2001) she placed 40 speakers in 8 groups, each speaker playing a recording of one voice singing Thomas Tallis&#x27; &quot;Spem in alium&quot;, enabling the audience to walk through the space and &quot;sample&quot; individual voices of the polyphonic vocal music. This work is now part of the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada., the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and of Inhotim in Brumadinho, Brazil. This work was presented at The Cloisters, September to December 2013, that museum&#x27;s first presentation of contemporary art. The work was installed in the Fuentidueña Chapel, which features the late twelfth-century apse from the church of San Martín at Fuentidueña, near Segovia, Spain, providing a transformed acoustic experience.

A mid-career retrospective, &quot;Janet Cardiff: A Survey of Works, Including Collaborations with George Bures Miller&quot;, opened at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, Long Island City, Queens, in 2001 and has travelled to Montréal, Oslo, and Turin. Exhibitions in 2006 include &quot;Good Vibrations–Le arti visive e il Rock&quot;, Palazzo delle Papesse, Centro Arte Contemporanea, Siena; &quot;Anticipation&quot;, The Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago; and &quot;Sonic Presence&quot;, Bergen Kunsthall, Bergen, Norway.

In &quot;Real Time&quot; (1999) was the very first video walk that Cardiff created. It took place in the library of the Carnegie Museum of Art and begins with the participant donning a pair of headphones attached to a small video camera. Upon playback Cardiff says to watch the screen and follow along with what we see and hear for approximately 18 minutes. This piece relies on the discrepancies between what is seen on the video monitor and what is occurring in the library.

==Work with George Bures Miller==
&quot;The Dark Pool&quot; was the first multimedia installation collaboration Cardiff and Miller created and showed in 1995 in Vancouver. The work consists of a dimly lit room, furnished with cardboard, carpets, and collected ephemera and artifacts, through which visitors move, triggering sounds such as musical segments, portions of conversations, and bits of stories. Cardiff and Miller consider the work very personal and, despite offers, have not sold it. 
Cardiff and Bures Miller represented Canada at the 49th Venice Biennale with &quot;Paradise Institute&quot; (2001), a 16-seat movie theatre where viewers watched a film, becoming entangled as witnesses to a possible crime played out in the real world audience and on the screen. Cardiff and Bures Miller have recently had exhibitions at Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco (2018), the Art Gallery of Alberta (2010), Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, Scotland (2008) the Miami Art Museum (2007) Vancouver Art Gallery (2005), Luhring Augustine, New York (2004), Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati (2003), Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) (2002), National Gallery of Canada (2002) and Oakville Galleries, Oakville, Ontario (2000). In 2012, she took part along with her husband in the Kassel’s Documenta. They proposed two installations: the first one is an audio installation in the forest called &quot;Forest (for a thousand years…)&quot; of a 28 minute audio loop. The second one is a 26-minute video walk specially produced for Documenta and called &quot;Alter Bahnhof video walk&quot;. In 2013, the Art Gallery of Ontario and Vancouver Art Gallery organized &quot;Lost in the Memory Palace: Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller&quot;, a selected survey, which took as its focus Cardiff and Miller&#x27;s work from the mid-1990s to 2013. Recent projects include &quot;Thought Experiments in F♯ Minor&quot; (2019), a site-specific, immersive, video installation at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles; and &quot;Cardiff &amp; Miller&quot; (2019), a solo exhibition at Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Monterrey in Mexico.

<text>Marcus Antius Crescens Calpurnianus was a Roman senator, who held several offices, including acting governor of Roman Britain in the late second century AD, and as one of the &quot;quindecimviri sacris faciundis&quot; present at the Secular Games of 204.

An approximate chronology of his career can be established. Two inscriptions found in Ostia attest to Calpurnianus present in that city as &quot;pontifex Volcani&quot; in the years 194 and 195. A fragmentary inscription from Rome attests that after serving as praetor he officially served as &quot;juridicus&quot; in Britain when he had to replace an unnamed consular, then after his election to the &quot;quindecimviri sacris faciundis&quot; the sortition awarded him the office of proconsular governor of Macedonia. Birley notes that most experts date Calpurnianus&#x27; tenure as acting governor to about 200 &quot;on the death or sudden disappearance of Virius Lupus.&quot; However, there is no firm basis to presume he was elected to the &quot;quindecimviri&quot; in 204, nor that the two offices of &quot;juridicus&quot; and proconsul fell close to that year; the duty of acting governor may have fallen on his shoulders when a governor of the province was killed in battle in the far north of the province. Birley lists two or three other incidents around 185 when the legions in Britain attempted to make different legionary commanders emperor. &quot;Further evidence will be needed before this dating of Calpurnianus&#x27; acting governorship can be regarded as definite,&quot; Birley concludes

Little more is known of Calpurnianus. Birley speculates that he &quot;preferred to devote himself to his private or local concerns, for example at Ostia, which was presumably his home.&quot; Birley also notes the existence of Marcus Antius Gratillianus, quaestor of Sicily in 213, and suggests Gratillianus could be Calpurnianus&#x27; son.
