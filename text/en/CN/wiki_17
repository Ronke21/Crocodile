<text>The Essex Regiment was a line infantry regiment of the British Army in existence from 1881 to 1958. The regiment served in many conflicts such as the Second Boer War and both World War I and World War II, serving with distinction in all three. It was formed in 1881 under the Childers Reforms by the amalgamation of the 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot and the 56th (West Essex) Regiment of Foot.

In 1958, the Essex Regiment was amalgamated with the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment to form the 3rd East Anglian Regiment (16th/44th Foot). However, the existence was short-lived and, in 1964, was amalgamated again with the 1st East Anglian Regiment (Royal Norfolk and Suffolk), the 2nd East Anglian Regiment (Duchess of Gloucester&#x27;s Own Royal Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire) and the Royal Leicestershire Regiment to form the Royal Anglian Regiment. The lineage of the Essex Regiment is continued by &#x27;C&#x27; Company of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment.

==History==
===Origins===
The Essex Regiment was formed in 1881 by the union of the 44th (East Essex) and 56th (West Essex) Regiments of Foot, which became the 1st and 2nd battalions respectively of the new regiment. This merger was part of the Childers Reforms of the British Army, which also saw the East Essex Militia and West Essex Militia joining the Essex Regiment as its 3rd and 4th battalions.

A large number of small Rifle Volunteer Corps had been formed in the county as a result of an invasion scare in 1859. In 1880, they were consolidated into four battalions, and in 1883 they were designated as the 1st–4th Volunteer Battalions of the Essex Regiment. Under the mobilisation scheme proposed by the Stanhope Memorandum of 1888, they constituted the Essex Volunteer Infantry Brigade, which was to gather at Warley in case of invasion.

===Second Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902)===
The 1st and 2nd battalions both served in South Africa during the Second Boer War. Notably, the regiment participated in the Relief of Kimberley and the Battle of Paardeberg. The four Volunteer Battalions contributed two Special Service Companies to assist the 1st Battalion and were also awarded the battle honour &quot;South Africa 1900–02&quot;.

After the war ended in June 1902, the 1st battalion was transferred to Bangalore, as part of the Madras command. 966 officers and men left Natal for India in the &quot;SS Ionian&quot; that August. The 570 men of the 2nd battalion returned home on the SS &quot;Pinemore&quot; in October 1902.

The 3rd (Militia) battalion, formed from the Essex Rifles in 1881, was a reserve battalion. It was embodied in December 1899, disembodied in October the following year, and later re-embodied for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War. 17 officers and 532 men returned aboard , arriving in Southampton on 5 October 1902.

===The Haldane Reforms===
As a result of the Haldane Reforms, the regiment&#x27;s militia component, which was renamed the Special Reserve, was reduced to one battalion on 1 April 1908. In addition, the four volunteer battalions transferred to the Territorial Force and were redesignated as battalions of the Essex Regiment:
* 1st Volunteer Battalion became the 4th Battalion at Ongar Road in Brentwood (headquarters since demolished)
* 2nd Volunteer Battalion became the 5th Battalion at Stanwell Street in Colchester (headquarters since demolished)
* 3rd Volunteer Battalion became the 6th Battalion at Portway in West Ham (headquarters since demolished)
* 4th Volunteer Battalion became the 7th Battalion at Cooks Terrace in Silvertown (headquarters since demolished)
The Essex Brigade joined the East Anglian Division of the TF.

In 1910, the Essex and Suffolk Cyclist Battalion, which had been raised in 1908, divided to become the 6th (Cyclist) Battalion, Suffolk Regiment and the 8th (Cyclist) Battalion, Essex Regiment.

===First World War (1914–1918)===

During the First World War, the Essex Regiment provided 30 infantry battalions to the British Army. The 3rd (Special Reserve) (formerly Militia) battalion was mobilised to supply drafts to the two Regular battalions. On the outbreak of war, the Territorial battalions (4th-7th, and 8th (Cyclist) battalions), all formed second line (2/4-2/8th) and eventually third line (3/4th-3/8th) battalions. Three service battalions (9th, 10th and 11th) and one reserve battalion (12th), were formed from volunteers in 1914 as part of Kitchener&#x27;s Army. A further service battalion, the 13th (Service) Battalion (West Ham), was raised by the Mayor and Borough of West Ham. Reserve battalions were created as the war progressed, including the 14th (from the depot companies of the 13th), the 15th, 16th and 17th (from provisional battalions), the 18th (Home Service) and 1st and 2nd Garrison Battalions.

====Battle of the Somme====
The 1st Battalion took part in the first day of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916. The battalion, which comprised W, X, Y, and Z companies, took up position in the British trenches at 3:30 am. At 8:40 am, the battalion received orders to advance and clear the German first-line trenches. It was delayed by heavy enemy fire and congestion in the communication trenches. The Newfoundland Regiment advancing to the left of the Essex battalion was almost entirely wiped out as it advanced towards the German lines. At 10:50 am, the Essex companies were in position and received orders to go &quot;over the top&quot;. The companies came under heavy artillery and machine gun fire almost as soon as they appeared over the parapet, causing heavy losses. The attack became bogged down in no man&#x27;s land. The battalion received orders from 88th Brigade headquarters to recommence the attack at 12:30 pm, but at 12:20 pm the battalion commander advised brigade HQ that &quot;owing to casualties and disorganisation&quot;, it was impossible to renew the attack. The survivors of the battalion received orders to hold their position along the line of &#x27;Mary Redan&#x27; – &#x27;New Trench&#x27; – &#x27;Regent Street&#x27;.

====Thiepval Memorial====
The names of 959 members of the Essex Regiment are recorded on the Thiepval Memorial, commemorating the officers and men of the regiment who died on the Somme and have no known grave.

====Gallipoli====
After serving in home defence, the Essex Brigade (containing the 1/4th, 1/5th, 1/6th and 1/7th battalions and now numbered the 161st (Essex) Brigade in 54th (East Anglian) Division) landed at Suvla Bay in August 1915 in an attempt to restart the stalled Gallipoli Campaign. The four Essex battalions saw some hard fighting, but lost even more men to sickness. They were withdrawn to Egypt in December before the Gallipoli Peninsula was finally abandoned.

====Senussi Campaign====
As soon as it arrived in Egypt, the brigade became involved in the Senussi Campaign, marching out to replace the New Zealand Rifle Brigade guarding the coast railway from Alexandria to Da&#x27;aba. The Essex battalions were relieved from this duty on 4 March 1916 by the 2nd County of London Yeomanry and moved into the No 1 (Southern) Section of the Suez Canal Defences. In August, part of the brigade was moved northwards to counter a Turkish thrust at the canal, and was present at the Battle of Romani, though only 161st Brigade Machine Gun Company was engaged.

====Sinai and Palestine====
In early 1917, 161st Brigade crossed the Sinai Desert to take part in the Palestine Campaign. It was engaged at all three Battles of Gaza. At the First Battle (26 March 1917), the main attack was made by 53rd (Welsh) Division with 161st Brigade in support. Towards the end of the day the 161st Brigade was ordered to take Green Hill: despite heavy fighting the attack was a complete success and the brigade held the whole position by nightfall. However, confusion set in, and 53rd Division withdrew during the night. The men of 161st Brigade were enraged by the order to withdraw. The following day patrols showed that the Turks had not reoccupied the position; 1/7th Battalion was sent up to support the patrols, but a violent Turkish counter-attack finished the battle. Casualties were heavy, including many men missing after the fighting withdrawal.

The brigade was not heavily engaged during the Second Battle of Gaza (17–19 April 1917:) 1/7th Bn was detached and assigned to the Imperial Camel Corps (ICC), which was protecting the left flank of 54th Division, while the rest of the brigade was in divisional reserve and most of its casualties were due to shellfire.

During the summer months, 161st Brigade held the line without suffering serious casualties, and by the end of October was fully up to strength for the forthcoming Third Battle of Gaza (1–3 November 1917). On the morning of 2 November, the 54th Division put in a holding attack at the El Arish Redoubt. The fighting was confused, but the division took all its objectives. However, the 1/7th Bn found that the fourth objective, &#x27;John Trench&#x27;, was a mere scrape in the ground and could not be held. The brigade commander considered that this battalion had the hardest time of all that day. At 04.00 on 3 November, 1/7th made a renewed attempt to take their objective, but were again held up by Turkish machine-gun fire, with heavy casualties. During the rapid pursuit after the fall of Gaza, 1/4th and 1/6th Essex assisted the Anzac Mounted Division, while 1/5th and 1/7th were left marching in the rear.

As well as battle casualties, the whole brigade suffered considerably from influenza during November–December 1917 and throughout 1918. The weakened brigade was mainly engaged in line-holding until September 1918. 54th Division was held in readiness to move to reinforce the Western Front, but in the end was not sent.

The 54th Division returned to the offensive for the Battle of Megiddo (19–25 September 1918), which finally broke the Turkish resistance. To support the breakthrough, 161st Brigade was to secure the Ez Zakur line and then form a defensive flank. The brigade formed up before dawn on 19 September; covered by an overhead barrage from the machine gun companies, it took its objectives successfully. The main assault completely broke through the Turkish lines and opened the way for the cavalry to pursue the defeated enemy. 161st Brigade was left behind for a week on battlefield clearance before joining the pursuit. By the time the Armistice with Turkey was signed on 30 October 1918, 54th Division had reached Beirut.

====Home Defence====
The four Second Line TF battalions (2/4th–2/7th) constituted the 206th (2/1st Essex) Brigade in 69th (2nd East Anglian) Division, which remained on Home Defence throughout the war. The Third Line battalions (3/4th–3/7th) were formed as reserve battalions to provide drafts to the TF units overseas. By September 1916, they had been merged into 4th Reserve Battalion.

====Irish War of Independence (1919–1921)====
The 1st Battalion was stationed in Kinsale in County Cork during the Irish War of Independence.
====Major Percival====
From 1920, Major Arthur Ernest Percival (later a Lieutenant-General) served first as a company commander, then as the battalion&#x27;s intelligence officer. During the First World War, Percival became renowned for his &quot;power of command and knowledge of tactics&quot;.

As such, he and his fellow Essex regimental colleagues were trained in counter-insurgency tactics. Combining both intelligence and rapid response teams in mobile squads, Percival and his Essex veterans staged numerous operations to demoralise and defeat the IRA. Consequently, he and his fellow Essex men were regarded by Irish loyalists as an efficient force. This opinion of their effectiveness appears to have been seconded by the Republicans, who came to regard Percival and the Essex men as one of its primary foes. As the IRA guerrilla war intensified and IRA assassinations were met with reprisals, a large bounty was placed on Percival&#x27;s and the Essex men&#x27;s death. The IRA eventually increased its bounty on Percival to £1,000, a significant sum of money for the period. Although other Essex officers were assassinated by the IRA, all attempts to assassinate Percival failed. In July 1920, the Essex Regiment captured Tom Hales, commander of the IRA&#x27;s 3rd Cork Brigade, and Patrick Harte, quartermaster of the West Cork Brigade. Both men were severely beaten during interrogation - Harte suffered brain damage and died insane at Broadmoor Hospital in 1925.

====Crossbarry====
In March 1921, at Crossbarry, County Cork, the Essex Regiment encircled the IRA&#x27;s &quot;West Cork Flying Column&quot; with 1,200 troops and soon managed to expose a company-sized element of the IRA. The IRA flying column, under the command of Tom Barry, numbered 104 &#x27;volunteers&#x27;. However, rather than attempting to immediately destroy this IRA element, which had been met in contact, Percival, the RIC and the Essex Regiment were ordered to link with the larger regular forces in an attempt to encircle the IRA force.

However, the delay in tempo needed to carry out this move and a lack of communications between the RIC mobile teams and the Regulars, resulted in the pressure being taken off Barry&#x27;s IRA men. This allowed the IRA force to attack and overwhelm a number of isolated army positions, which appeared to create an opening out of the encirclement. Foreseeing a break-out, Percival ordered his Essex and RIC mobile teams to regroup and lay an ambush outside the opening.

Simultaneously, the larger regular force misunderstood Percival&#x27;s objective and thought it saw an opportunity to destroy the entire IRA force in Cork. Consequently, it abandoned most of its encircling positions and regrouped the regulars for a single large attack on the ambush site. Meanwhile, believing his column had little chance of escaping, Barry ordered his IRA men to break out in small groups as best they could through the encirclement. Thus, in a stroke of luck, most of Barry&#x27;s IRA column simply passed through the abandoned encircling army posts. A small IRA detachment did attempt to break out through the British ambush site.

However, as the RIC and Essex group were about to spring their ambush, an Irish regular force racing to the ambush site ran into the IRA detachment and was quickly engaged. In the resulting firefight, the IRA detachment disrupted the British column and then melted away. In Barry&#x27;s book, &quot;Guerrilla Days in Ireland&quot;, written in 1949, he gives a first-hand account on the Essex&#x27;s collision with his flying column.

===Turkey (1922)===
At the conclusion of the First World War, Britain maintained a garrison at Constantinople to ensure the free passage of the sea lanes between the Aegean and Black Seas.

The dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and its transformation into the Turkish Republic coincided with the rise of Greek nationalism, resulting in the Greco-Turkish War. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George increased the size of the British garrison - which included the 2nd Battalion of the Essex Regiment. The garrison was withdrawn in 1923.

===Saar Plebiscite (1935)===
As part of the Treaty of Versailles, the Saarland province, on the border of France and Germany, was put under French control. In 1935, by the terms of the treaty, the people of the Saarland were to determine whether to remain as part of France, or to become German. The British government sent the 13th Brigade, which comprised 1st Battalion, the Essex Regiment, 1st Battalion, the East Lancashire Regiment, and the 16th/5th Lancers, as a supervisory force to the Saarland. The result of the plebiscite was 90.3% voting to join Germany (then under Nazi government).

===Palestine (1936–1939)===
From Germany, the 1st Battalion moved to Catterick in 1935 and thence to Palestine in 1936 where it took part in putting down an Arab revolt.

===India (1922–1935)===
The 2nd Battalion spent the 13-year period from 1922 to 1935 as part of the British garrison in India. During this lengthy time, the 2nd Battalion was stationed at Ambala (1922–1927), Landi Kotal (1927–1929), Nowshera (1929–1931), Nasirabad (1931–1933) and Bombay (1933–1935). The 2nd Battalion spent an additional year overseas in Sudan (1935–1936), before returning to Britain and the regimental depot at Warley near Brentwood in Essex.

===Between the Wars===
In 1920, when the Territorial Force was reformed (and was renamed the Territorial Army), the Essex Regiment again had five territorial battalions. However, this was short-lived, as the 8th (Cyclist) Battalion was soon disbanded.

On 15 December 1935, the 7th Battalion was converted into the 59th (Essex Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery, which was retitled as an AA (Anti-Aircraft) Regiment on 1 January 1939 and as a HAA (Heavy Anti-Aircraft) Regiment on 1 June 1940.

On 1 November 1938, the 6th Battalion duplicated, forming the 1/6th and 2/6th battalions, both of which were equipped with searchlights. On 1 August 1940, both battalions were transferred to the Royal Artillery, becoming the 64th and 65th (Essex Regiment) Searchlight Regiments, Royal Artillery.

===Second World War (1939–1945)===
====Regular Army====

Of the Regular Army units, the 1st Battalion served in many different British and Indian Infantry Brigades in Sudan, Egypt, Libya, Syria and Burma. The battalion served in the 23rd Infantry Brigade, 6th Division, for a few months at the beginning of the war. Rejoining in October 1941, it remained with the brigade until mid-1945, when it joined the 29th Infantry Brigade, part of the 36th British Infantry Division. It served in Tobruk, then in the Anglo-Iraqi War as part Habforce and Kingcol, then in Operation Exporter in the Syria-Lebanon campaign, before moving to India with 23rd Infantry Brigade, part of 70th Infantry Division, previously the 6th Infantry Division, which became the core of Brigadier Orde Wingate&#x27;s &quot;Special Force&quot;.

The brigade&#x27;s role changed to Long Range Penetration in September 1943; the 1st Battalion formed 44 and 56 Columns of the Chindits and operated in the Japanese rear during the battles of Imphal and Kohima, two battles that turned the tide of the war against Japan in the Far East.

The 2nd Battalion, Essex Regiment, was originally part of the 25th Infantry Brigade (containing the 1/7th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey) and 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers) attached to the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and served with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France in 1940. The battalion was evacuated from Dunkirk after the short but fierce Battle of Dunkirk, part of the larger Battle of France.

After Dunkirk the battalion remained with the 25th Brigade until February 1944 when it became part of the 56th Independent Infantry Brigade, alongside the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers and 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, where it was to remain for the rest of the war. The battalion received large drafts of men to bring it up to strength and began training intensively for the Allied invasion of France. The battalion and brigade landed on Gold Beach on D-Day, 6 June 1944, from roughly 1:00 pm and immediately set off inland.

They fought through the Battle for Caen serving again with the 50th Division and briefly with 59th Division. The 56th Infantry Brigade were eventually assigned to the 49th (West Riding) Division, after the 70th Brigade of that division was disbanded due to an Army-wide shortage of trained infantrymen. The battalion and brigade would remain with the 49th Division for the rest of the war, serving mainly with the First Canadian Army. In 1945 they fought in the Second Battle of Arnhem. By the end of the war the 2nd Battalion had suffered over 804 men killed, wounded or missing, with 183 of them paying the ultimate price.

====Territorial Army====

At the onset of war, the two remaining Territorial Army (TA) battalions once again raised duplicate units; all four (1/4th, 1/5th, 2/4th and 2/5th) began the war in the 161st Infantry Brigade, but the 2/4th Battalion, a 2nd Line duplicate of the 1/4th Battalion, was immediately detached to help form the duplicate 163rd Infantry Brigade.

Both brigades were initially part of the 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division, but in January 1941, 161st Brigade was sent by sea to Sierra Leone in West Africa. In June 1941, it was sent the &#x27;long&#x27; way around Africa by sea to join Middle East Command, where it was transferred to the British Indian Army and became 161st Indian Infantry Brigade. The 1/4th Battalion served with the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of 4th Indian Infantry Division, throughout the war; the 1/5th and 2/5th battalions, which merged to form the 5th Battalion and, served with the 18th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of the 8th Indian Infantry Division.

Both battalions saw service in Palestine, North Africa and Italy; and the 1/4th Battalion served with the 4th Indian Division in action at the Second Battle of El Alamein and in the Italian Campaign before being sent to Greece to help calm the Greek Civil War. The 5th Battalion was transferred, in August 1944, to the 13th Infantry Brigade, part of the British 5th Infantry Division and was sent to participate in the final stages of the North West Europe Campaign with the British Second Army and invaded Germany itself.

The 2/4th Battalion remained in the United Kingdom throughout the war, with the 206th Brigade and later the 140th Brigade and 7th Brigade, supplying drafts and replacements to other units of the regiment serving abroad as well as other infantry regiments.

The 64th (Essex Regiment) Searchlight Regiment and 65th (Essex Regiment) Searchlight Regiment were both transferred to the Royal Artillery in August 1940, being renamed 64th (Essex Regiment) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery and 65th (Essex Regiment) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery, respectively. However, they still maintained their own Essex Regiment capbadges and buttons. On the outbreak of war, both were originally assigned to the 41st (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, part of the 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division until November 1940 when the 64th was transferred to the 40th Anti-Aircraft Brigade and the 65th remained with the 41st AA Brigade.

Both regiments remained mainly in East Anglia and eastern England, defending from aerial attacks during the Battle of Britain and during The Blitz. Towards the end of the war in late 1944 and early 1945, both regiments were selected to be converted to infantry. The 64th Searchlight Regiment was subsequently redesignated 639th (Essex Regiment) Infantry Regiment, Royal Artillery and joined the 305th Infantry Brigade. The 65th Searchlight Regiment became 607th (Essex Regiment) Infantry Regiment, Royal Artillery. Both were converted to infantry due mainly to a severe shortage of manpower in the 21st Army Group fighting in North-western Europe, particularly in the infantry.

After defending Essex during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz, 59th (The Essex Regiment) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment (previously the 7th Battalion, Essex Regiment) landed in North Africa with the British First Army in November 1942, and later saw service with the British Eighth Army in the Italian Campaign.

====Hostilities-only====
The 7th (Home Defence) Battalion, Essex Regiment was raised specifically for home defence duties in the United Kingdom. The battalion was created on 2 November 1939 from 8 Group National Defence Companies. The battalion consisted mainly of older and less fit men but who had had previous military experience and younger soldiers around the ages of 18 and 19, and thus not old enough to be conscripted, who later went on to help form the 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion. On 24 December 1941, the battalion was reorganised and redesignated as the 30th Battalion and remained in the United Kingdom until it was disbanded on 31 March 1943.

The 8th Battalion, Essex Regiment was raised at Warley, Essex on 4 July 1940, assigned to 210th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) until late February 1941 when it was transferred to the 226th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). On 1 December 1941, the battalion was transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps and converted to armour, becoming the 153rd (Essex) Regiment Royal Armoured Corps. While the men donned the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps, they continued to wear their Essex Regiment cap badge as did all infantry units converted in this manner.

During the conversion, surplus personnel were formed into &#x27;R&#x27; Company, Essex Regiment, which soon afterwards was designated as V Corps HQ Defence Company. On formation, 153 RAC joined 34th Army Tank Brigade, with which it fought in Normandy, alongside 107 RAC and 147 RAC. However, 153 RAC was disbanded on 28 August 1944, due to a severe shortage of manpower, to be used as replacements for other British tank units in the 21st Army Group.

The 9th Battalion was also raised at Warley on 4 July 1940, the same day the 8th Battalion was raised, and joined the 210th Brigade alongside the 8th Battalion, before both being transferred to 225th Brigade. Now assigned to the 219th Independent Infantry Brigade, the battalion was transferred to the Royal Artillery and converted into the 11th Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery on 1 December 1942, as were the rest of the battalions in the brigade. The regiment served in the Battle of Normandy as part of the 9th Army Group Royal Artillery. The regiment was disbanded after the war in January 1946.
The 50th (Holding) Battalion, Essex Regiment was formed at Colchester on 28 May 1940. On 9 October, it was reorganised as the 10th Battalion and served in the home defence role, assigned to 223rd Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). On 8 December 1942, the brigade was converted into the 3rd Parachute Brigade and the battalion became the 9th Battalion, Parachute Regiment, part of the Army&#x27;s airborne forces. Originally assigned to the 1st Airborne Division, the 3rd Para Brigade was transferred, in May 1943, to help create the 6th Airborne Division.

With most of the 6th Airborne Division, the battalion was involved in the British airborne landings in the early hours of 6 June 1944 (D-Day), code-named Operation Tonga, where the battalion had the task of destroying the Merville Gun Battery. After D-Day, they fought in the Battle of Normandy as normal infantrymen until the middle of August (see 6th Airborne Division advance to the River Seine). They later played a small part in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and a large part in Operation Varsity in March 1945, the largest airborne operation of the war, involving over 16,000 paratroopers, where the 6th Airborne Division fought alongside the US 17th Airborne Division and both divisions suffered relatively heavy casualties in only a short amount of time. The 9th Battalion, Parachute Regiment ended the war in May 1945 near the Baltic Sea and was later sent with the rest of the 6th Airborne Division in Palestine.

The 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion was formed in the United Kingdom on 16 September 1940 from the younger personnel of the 7th (Home Defence) Battalion and from young volunteers – although a person could officially join the British Army at age 18, he couldn&#x27;t be posted for service overseas until he was at least 19. After serving in a home defence role, the unit was disbanded on 31 March 1943, as were all such units of other regiments, due to the British government lowering the age of conscription from 20 to 18. A 19th Battalion was also formed; it carried out line of communication duties in the Middle East and Eritrea.

===Post-1945===
The 2nd Battalion was disbanded in 1948. In 1951–53, the regiment was stationed in Luneburg, Germany, as part of the BAOR (British Army of the Rhine). In mid 1953, the regiment sailed on the Troopship &quot;Asturias&quot; to Korea, where it served for a year. The following year, the battalion joined the Hong Kong Garrison. The 1st Battalion merged with the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment in 1958 to form the 3rd East Anglian Regiment (16th/44th Foot).

In 1964, the regiments of the East Anglian Brigade formed the new Royal Anglian Regiment. The Essex heritage continued in the regiment&#x27;s 3rd Battalion (also known as &#x27;The Pompadours&#x27;). In 1992, the 3rd Battalion was disbanded and the old Essex connection ceased. However, infantry recruits from Essex who wish to serve with others from their county are assigned to companies in the 1st Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment. C (Essex) Company, 1st Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment continues the Essex link.

In 1947, the 59th HAA Regiment was reformed at Walthamstow as the 459th (The Essex Regiment) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, (&#x27;Mixed&#x27; denoting that members of the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps were integrated into the regiment). There were widespread mergers within the TA&#x27;s AA regiments after Anti-Aircraft Command was disbanded in 1955: 459 (M) HAA Regiment absorbed 482 (M) HAA Regiment (the former 82 HAA Regiment, to which 59th had provided a battery on formation) and 599 and 600 HAA Regiments, which had been created from the 1/6th and 2/6th Btns, The Essex Regiment. A further merger in 1961, with 512 (Finsbury Rifles) and 517 (Essex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiments into 300 LAA Regiment, saw the Essex lineage discontinued, the combined regiment later being designated 300 (Tower Hamlets) Light Air Defence Regiment.

==Territorial Army (later Army Reserve)==
The &quot;Essex&quot; tradition also continued in the Territorial Army, renamed the Army Reserve in 2013. The Essex infantry reservists are now represented by 3 (Essex and Hertford) Company, 3rd Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment.

==Regimental museum==
The Essex Regiment Museum is based at Oaklands Park in Chelmsford.

==Essex Regiment Chapel==

The Essex Regiment Chapel is located in Eagle Way, Warley (). The chapel was built in 1857 and is a Grade II listed building. It was originally constructed for the British East India Company, but with the establishment of the Essex Regiment Depot at Warley, the chapel became the regiment&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; church. The chapel&#x27;s interior contains displays of regimental history, memorials, heraldry, and old regimental colours. The chapel is open by appointment, and on regimental heritage days.

The chapel is near the Warley (Brentwood) Army Reserve drill hall, which is the headquarters of 124 Petroleum Squadron, part of the Royal Logistic Corps&#x27; 151 (London) Transport Regiment.

The site of the old regimental depot and barracks at Warley is now the headquarters of the Ford Motor Company in the UK. Most of the barracks have been demolished and only the chapel, the officer&#x27;s mess (now the Marillac Nursing Home) and one of the regimental gyms (Keys Hall), remain.

==Uniform==
The Essex Regiment had inherited a unique facing colour from the 56th Foot: a shade of purple originally described as &quot;deep crimson&quot; and later &quot;Pompadour&quot;. From 1881 the standard white facings of English non-royal regiments were in use but the historic purple was readopted in 1902. In other respects the regiment followed the normal progression from red coats, to scarlet tunics, to khaki service dress and battledress, of the British line infantry.

<text>In the mathematical areas of order and lattice theory, the Kleene fixed-point theorem, named after American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene, states the following:

:Kleene Fixed-Point Theorem. Suppose formula_1 is a directed-complete partial order (dcpo) with a least element, and let formula_2 be a Scott-continuous (and therefore monotone) function. Then formula_3 has a least fixed point, which is the supremum of the ascending Kleene chain of formula_4

The ascending Kleene chain of &quot;f&quot; is the chain

:formula_5

obtained by iterating &quot;f&quot; on the least element ⊥ of &quot;L&quot;. Expressed in a formula, the theorem states that

:formula_6

where formula_7 denotes the least fixed point.

Although Tarski&#x27;s fixed point theorem 
does not consider how fixed points can be computed by iterating &quot;f&quot; from some seed (also, it pertains to monotone functions on complete lattices), this result is often attributed to Alfred Tarski who proves it for additive functions. Moreover, Kleene Fixed-Point Theorem can be extended to monotone functions using transfinite iterations.

== Proof ==
Source:

We first have to show that the ascending Kleene chain of formula_3 exists in formula_9. To show that, we prove the following:

:Lemma. If formula_9 is a dcpo with a least element, and formula_2 is Scott-continuous, then formula_12

:Proof. We use induction: 
:* Assume n = 0. Then formula_13 since formula_14 is the least element.
:* Assume n &gt; 0. Then we have to show that formula_15. By rearranging we get formula_16. By inductive assumption, we know that formula_17 holds, and because f is monotone (property of Scott-continuous functions), the result holds as well.

As a corollary of the Lemma we have the following directed ω-chain:

:formula_18

From the definition of a dcpo it follows that formula_19 has a supremum, call it formula_20 What remains now is to show that formula_21 is the least fixed-point.

First, we show that formula_21 is a fixed point, i.e. that formula_23. Because formula_3 is Scott-continuous, formula_25, that is formula_26. Also, since formula_27 and because formula_14 has no influence in determining the supremum we have: formula_29. It follows that formula_23, making formula_21 a fixed-point of formula_3.

The proof that formula_21 is in fact the &quot;least&quot; fixed point can be done by showing that any element in formula_19 is smaller than any fixed-point of formula_3 (because by property of supremum, if all elements of a set formula_36 are smaller than an element of formula_9 then also formula_38 is smaller than that same element of formula_9). This is done by induction: Assume formula_40 is some fixed-point of formula_3. We now prove by induction over formula_42 that formula_43. The base of the induction formula_44 obviously holds: formula_45 since formula_14 is the least element of formula_9. As the induction hypothesis, we may assume that formula_48. We now do the induction step: From the induction hypothesis and the monotonicity of formula_3 (again, implied by the Scott-continuity of formula_3), we may conclude the following: formula_51 Now, by the assumption that formula_40 is a fixed-point of formula_53 we know that formula_54 and from that we get formula_55

<text>Akubra is an Australian hat manufacturer owned by Tattarang since November 2023. The company is associated with bush hats made of rabbit fur felt with wide brims that are worn in rural Australia. The term &quot;Akubra&quot; is sometimes used to refer to any hat of this kind, however the company manufactures a wide range of hat styles including fedora, homburg, bowler, pork pie, and trilby.

The name is claimed to derive from an Aboriginal (possibly Birpai) word for a head covering.

==History==
Benjamin Dunkerley was born 1840 in Cheshire England . He came from a family of cotton weavers. He later became a hatter and developed such skill with hat making machinery that he visited Germany from time to time to help manufacturers there set up operations. In 1874 Benjamin left England for Tasmania, Australia to check out the hatting prospects. Once immigrated and established in Australia, he sent for his wife Harriet and six children to join him.

In 1876 Dunkerley and David Glenhill established the Kensington Hat Mills in Glenorchy, near Hobart in Tasmania. The business rapidly expanded and was soon employing 30 workers and producing 750 hats per week. However, the business was declared bankrupt in 1879. Once the restrictions on his bankruptcy were lifted, Dunkerley in 1885 re-established Kensington Hat Mills in partnership with H.J Hull. To improve production, Dunkerley invented and registered in 1892 a fur-cutting machine that mechanised the difficult and tedious task of stripping the fur from the skin of rabbits. Realising its potential, he travelled to Manchester in England and took out a patent, which after some delay he was granted in August 1893. During the wait he travelled to New York and filed for a US patent and also sent an application back to Victoria, Australia. He was successful, being granted in all three countries.
Later in that year of 1893 in partnership with James Dugdale, he took out another patent in England, for an invention that improved cones employed in making hat bodies.

Ending his partnership with Hull after a decade working together, Dunkerley relocated to Melbourne in 1895. When a business slump hit the city in 1900, he moved to Sydney, setting up a hat making factory on Crown Street in Surry Hills.

In 1901 Stephen Keir (14 October 1879–11 November 1957), who came from a family of Manchester hatmakers, immigrated to Australia and after working for another hatmaker, entered the employment of Dunkerley in 1904 where he became romantically involved with Benjamin&#x27;s daughter Ada Dunkerley, who also worked in the factory. They married in 1905.

While information is missing on what Dunkerley was calling his business in Melbourne and Sydney, in 1911 Dunkerley Hat Mills Pty Ltd was registered with seven shareholders, 19 employees with Stephen Keir as managing director and Arthur P. Stewart as chairman.

All of the hats that were produced at the factory were sold by Stewart from his store in York Street in Sydney as well as distributing it to other retailers in the city.

On 7 August 1912 Stewart, who, as well as being a shareholder in the company and its chairman, was the distributor and sales agent for the company, registered the name &quot;Akubra&quot; as trademark 13462. Since then, it has been using Akubra as a brand name.

During World War I the company manufactured slouch hats for the Australian army. Slouch hats made of rabbit fur were found to be more hard wearing than the hats made from previous woollen felt. Since then it has continued supplying slouch hats to the Australian armed forces with an estimated over two million produced by 2016.

In 1919 the company moved from its existing cramped and poorly located factory to new bigger premises at Bourke Street, Sydney.

By the 1920s the company had hundreds of employees. When the Depression struck and the demand for hats collapsed Keir&#x27;s proposal (democratically endorsed) of a 10 per cent wage cut for all employees avoided any reduction in numbers.

With the outbreak of World War II the business revived as most of the company&#x27;s production was directed into making slouch hats for the military. Those employees who enlisted had their normal civilian wages preserved by the company to augment their military pay.

In the 1950s, the Akubra Company expanded its range when it won the licence to produce Stetson hats in Australia. In 1972, Mainline Corporation acquired Dunkerley Hat Mills maker of the Aussie Icon Akubra Hats and in 1974 the business was relocated from Sydney to larger premises in Kempsey.

When Stephen Keir retired in 1952 he was succeeded as Managing Director by his eldest son, Herbert. His second son, Stephen Keir II, served as General Manager and succeeded his brother as Managing Director in 1972. His son, Stephen Keir III, became Managing Director in 1980. Following the retirement of Stephen Keir III in 2007, his son Stephen Keir IV became Managing Director.

Akubra was acquired by private investment company Tattarang in November 2023.

==Styles==

Over 100 different styles, various colours and brim widths are produced in the Akubra hat range. The hats are popularly thought of as being worn by older people in rural Australia however in the 1920s Akubra was known more for making &quot;fashion hats&quot; such as Fedoras. The company sells hats in rural and urban areas. In 2014 it was reported that about 140,000 to 180,000 Akubras are sold every year, including &quot;bucket loads&quot; in Melbourne around Melbourne Cup time.

<text>Aigars Kalvītis (born 27 June 1966) is a Latvian businessman and a former politician who was the Prime Minister of Latvia from 2004 to 2007. Currently he is the president of Latvian Ice Hockey Federation and the Chairman of the Board of Latvian gas company Latvijas Gāze. He is the Chairman of the Council of Latvian telecommunications company Tet.

== Education ==
In 1984 Kalvītis graduated from Riga Secondary School No. 41. In 1992 he graduated from the Latvian University of Agriculture with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics and in 1995 he graduated with a magister degree in economics. In the same year he studied in the University of Wisconsin.

== Political career ==

=== Political activities up to 2004 ===
Kalvītis was one of the founders of People&#x27;s Party of Latvia in 1997 and was first elected to Saeima, the Latvian parliament, in 1998. He served as the minister of agriculture from 1999 to 2000 and the minister of economics from 2000 to 2002. Kalvītis was reelected to Saeima and became the leader of the parliamentary faction of the People&#x27;s Party in 2002.

=== Prime minister ===
On 2 December 2004, he became the Prime Minister of Latvia. He was the prime minister of Latvia until his resignation on 5 December 2007.

=== Kalvītis government ===
Kalvītis at first led a coalition government consisting of his own People&#x27;s Party, the New Era Party, the Union of Greens and Farmers and the Latvia&#x27;s First Party. In April 2006, the New Era Party left the government and Kalvītis led a minority coalition government consisting of the other three parties.

His governing coalition retained power in the 7 October 2006 parliamentary election, winning a slight majority of seats and becoming the first government since Latvian independence in 1991 to be re-elected. It consisted of the People&#x27;s Party, Union of Greens and Farmers, the Latvia First/Latvian Way Party, and For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK. For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK was added after the 2006 elections, and strengthened the coalition&#x27;s majority to 59 of the 100 seats. Meanwhile, the People&#x27;s Party became the largest party in Parliament. Kalvītis became its chairman.

=== Retirement from politics ===
On 7 November 2007, Kalvītis announced that he would step down as prime minister on 5 December, after encountering widespread opposition to his dismissal of the head of the anti-corruption bureau, Aleksejs Loskutovs, in the previous month. He accordingly met with President Valdis Zatlers on 5 December and announced his resignation, along with that of his government. According to Kalvītis, speaking on television on the same day, this was necessary to &quot;cool down hot heads&quot;. Kalvītis remained in office in a caretaker capacity until the appointment of his successor Ivars Godmanis. He decided to leave politics altogether on 1 April 2009, by putting down his member of Saeima mandate.

== Business career ==
From 1992 to 1998, he was a manager and Chairman of the Board of various agriculture related businesses. And after his political career he has been Chairman of the Council of various well-known companies like Tet (2009), Latvijas Balzams (2009–2015), and Chairman of the Board of enterprises like Hockey Club Dinamo Riga (2010–2015), the operator of Latvian LNG infrastructure Conexus Baltic Grid (2017) and Latvijas Gāze (2015). He became the president of the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation in October 2016, to succeed Kirovs Lipmans.

== Personal life ==
His wife is Kristīne Kalvīte. He has three sons Kārlis, Roberts and Rūdolfs.

<text>General William Mesny (1842 – 11 December 1919) was an adventurer and writer born on the island of Jersey but spent most of his childhood in Alderney, the family home of the Mesnys. He was the eldest of three children of William Mesny and Mary Rachel Nicolle.

==Biography==
Mesny left home at the age of twelve to sail the oceans until finally, after visiting India and Australia, he settled in a turbulent China in 1860. He served with two of the provincial armies of the Qing dynasty imperial military as a mercenary or, in modern parlance, a foreign adviser.

He spent 59 years in China. He became a Major-General in the Imperial army in 1873 when he was only 30, suggesting that his services were greatly valued by the Chinese. He was also made a &quot;Knight Ying of the Order of the Pa-tu-lu&quot;, the Chinese equivalent of the French Legion d&#x27;honneur. In 1890 he was awarded the decoration of the Pao Hsing (the Star of China).

He always retained British citizenship and was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Horticultural Society, and of the Imperial Institute. At one time he was the senior adviser to the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese armed forces and was given the title of Brevet Lieutenant-General, Chinese Army.

He visited almost every part of China, including Sinkiang. He also visited Tonking (now northern Vietnam) and accompanied Captain William Gill on his expedition in 1877 from Chengdu to Burma via Litang, Batang, Dali, along the Tibetan borderlands to Bhamo. He was a plant collector and sent specimens back to the British Consul in Canton, Dr. Henry Fletcher Hance, a famous botanist. One species, &quot;Jasminum mesnyi&quot;, was named after him.

==Works==
He wrote an informative history of &quot;Tungking&quot; – now northern Vietnam, which also includes details of the Black Flag Army, a pro-Chinese militia then fighting the French occupation.

In his later life he periodically produced a sort of weekly newspaper or journal in Shanghai called &quot;Mesny&#x27;s Chinese Miscellany&quot;. Publication of &quot;Mesny&#x27;s Chinese Miscellany&quot; began in September 1895, and continued through 1896, was revived briefly in 1899 and again in 1905. It was composed of his reminiscences of his life and adventures, snippets of recent news, and thousands of brief articles and notes on a very wide variety of topics relating to China. Mesny also strongly promoted railways and other methods of &quot;modernizing&quot; China.

<text>Wasilków commune is an urban-rural commune (administrative district) in Białystok County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland. Its seat is the Wasilków town, which lies approximately 3 km north of the regional capital Białystok.Wasilków commune is located on the Supraśl River, surrounded by the forests of the Knyszyn Forest.

The comunne covers an area of , and as of 2022 its total population is 20 361 (out of which the population of Wasilków amounts to 12 559, and the population of the rural part of the commune is 7 802).
== History ==
The first traces of settlement in the Wasilków commune date back to the Middle Stone Age. Excavations conducted near the town of Nowodworce provided evidence of the settlement of these areas in the Bronze Age, which lasted in Poland until around 1800 BCE. One of the most interesting was the discovery of a flint mine in the Knyszyn Forest near Rybniki. As a result of the research, about fifty archaeological sites have been discovered in the commune. Traces of prehistoric and early-historic settlements have been found in the vicinity of almost every modern village in the Wasilków commune. However, nothing is known about the beginnings of Slavic settlement in Wasilków.

In the 11th century the territory of Wasilków belonged to Kievan Rus. In 1340, the area of Wasilkow was incorporated into Lithuania by prince Gediminas. However, earlier this area belonged to Mazovia. The first mention in written sources about the area where the town and the Wasilków starosty was later established in 1358.

A breakthrough date in the history of Wasilków is December 8, 1566, when King Zygmunt August granted him city rights and a coat of arms. The city was inhabited by people from the vicinity of Goniądz, Tykocin and Białystok. Two days after granting city rights - on December 10, 1566, King Zygmunt August issued a privilege allowing the creation of a Catholic parish.

In the middle of the 17th century Wasilków was inhabited by about 500 people, and the entire starosty additionally 400 people. The first records from this period appear about Jews who came from Choroszcz and settled in Wasilków. Before the first partition of Poland, Wasilków had about 1,500 inhabitants. After the Third Partition of Poland, Wasilków was incorporated into the Białystok Department of New East Prussia, and from 1807, under the Treaty of Tylża, into the Russian Partition.

Around 1880, Wasilków had 3,880 inhabitants. There were 12 textile factories in the town, ten of which were owned by Jews. All plants employed a total of about 300 people.

The tragic date in the history of the city is May 5, 1895, when a great fire destroyed almost half of Wasilków, and 10 people died in the fire. At the end of the 19th century, Wasilków had approx. 4,000 inhabitants. residents.

In November 1918, there were only two textile factories operating in the city, employing nearly 70 workers. World War II began in these lands on September 16, 1939, with the entry of the German army. Less than a week later, a cavalry detachment of the Soviet Red Army entered the Tui. This is how the Soviet occupation began, during which several dozen of Wasilkow families were deported to Kazakhstan. In August 1941, the Germans established a ghetto in Wasilków, in which about 1,250 Jews were held. The following year, they were taken to Treblinka, where they were murdered.

As a result of the war, the industry in Wasilków ceased to exist. The city was destroyed in 20%. In the post-war period, a significant date is July 1, 1947, when Father Wacław Rabczyński was appointed vicar and administrator of the parish under the invocation of Transfiguration of the Lord in Wasilków. The summary of the activities of Fr. Rabczyński began in 1958 and completed in 1966 the construction of the church of Of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Mercy at Kościuszko Street. Father Wacław Rabczyński was undoubtedly one of the most outstanding figures in the post-war history of the Wasilkow region.

In 1946 Wasilków had 3,948 inhabitants. The determinant of the changes taking place in the post-war years was the development of Emilia Plater Wool Industry Plant, which in its heyday employed about 2,500 employees. In 1959, the construction of an elementary school on Mickiewicza Street began, and in 1982 a primary school on Polna Street, which was officially opened on May 22, 1985.

After World War II, Wasilków became a satellite city of Białystok. On May 27, 1990, the first half-century free and democratic elections to local self-government took place.

In 2022, the number of inhabitants of the city and commune of Wasilków reaches nearly 19 thousand. and is constantly growing. Wasilków has become one of the most dynamically developing local government units in Podlaskie.

<doc id="1234159" wikidata="Q328770" url="?curid=1234159" title="Dino Baggio">
<text>Dino Baggio (born 24 July 1971) is an Italian former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder.

Throughout his career, he played for several Italian clubs, and won the UEFA Cup three times, twice with Parma and once with Juventus. He also had a spell in England with Blackburn Rovers. At international level, he obtained 60 caps for Italy between 1991 and 1999, scoring seven goals, and was part of the team that reached the final of the 1994 FIFA World Cup; he later also represented Italy at UEFA Euro 1996, and at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

Despite sharing a last name, he has no relation to fellow Italian former footballer and teammate Roberto Baggio.

==Club career==
===Early career: Youth career, Torino, and Inter===
Baggio began his football career at age five in Tombolo, a province of Padova. He was spotted by Torino scouts at the age of 13 and taken into the Torino youth system. He made his debut in Serie A as a 19-year-old against Lazio and became a regular member of the starting line-up, making a name for himself as a promising youngster. He emerged as a tenacious, hardworking, consistent, and versatile defensive midfielder during his time at the club, who was capable of playing in several positions. With Torino, he won the 1989–90 Serie B title, followed by the 1991 Mitropa Cup. He was loaned to Inter Milan at the age of 20 in 1991 for the 1991–92 season, making 27 appearances and scoring 1 goal.

===Rise to prominence: Juventus===
At the end of the 1991–92 season, Juventus bought the promising youngster for 10 billion Italian Lire, and during his time at the club, Dino Baggio would play alongside his unrelated namesake Roberto Baggio for two seasons, forming a notable friendship; Dino was often called &quot;Baggio 2&quot; or &quot;the other Baggio&quot; earlier on in his career, to distinguish the two players, as he was younger, and initially less well-known. As Dino Baggio had previously played for city rivals Torino, however, the Juventus fans were not initially pleased by the transfer. His solid and consistent play soon won them over, however, and he quickly became a mainstay in the Juventus midfield, winning the UEFA Cup in 1993, scoring three goals over the two legs of the final; one of his goals came in the first leg, while the other two came in the return leg. He also helped Juventus to a second-place finish in Serie A during the 1993–94 season.

===Domestic and international success: Parma===
After Baggio&#x27;s performances in the 1994 FIFA World Cup and with Juventus, Parma attempted to acquire the midfielder. Baggio initially rejected Parma&#x27;s offer, stating his intention to stay at Juventus. At the time, Juventus were ready to offer Parma a young forward named Alessandro Del Piero instead of Baggio, in order to retain their defensive midfielder; Parma accepted the offer, but before the transfer could be finalised, Dino Baggio changed his mind, and decided he would make the move to Parma. Del Piero stayed with Juventus, and the following season he underwent a breakthrough with the club, later going on to become a club legend.

Baggio moved to Parma at the beginning of the 1994–95 season for 14 billion Lire. During his first season with his new club under Nevio Scala, he immediately won the UEFA Cup, for the second time in his career, scoring a goal in each leg of the 1995 final against his former team, Juventus, increasing his UEFA Cup Final goal tally to five goals. He also reached the final of the Coppa Italia that season, losing out to his former club, also narrowly missing on the Serie A title to his former club, once again, finishing the league season in third place. Despite their European success under Malesani, Parma were unable to win the Serie A title during these years, with their best finish occurring during the 1996–97 season, where they managed a second-place finish, under manager Carlo Ancelotti.

In a match during the 1998–99 UEFA Cup, Baggio was wounded in the head by a knife thrown by a Wisła Kraków supporter in Kraków, which resulted in Wisła being suspended from European cup play for a year. He would go on to win his third UEFA Cup that season, over Olympique Marseille, also winning the Coppa Italia over Fiorentina, followed by the 1999 Supercoppa Italiana over 1998–99 Serie A champions Milan.

Baggio stayed with Parma until the end of the 1999–2000 season, helping the club to a fourth-place finish, and narrowly missing out on an UEFA Champions League spot following a play-off defeat to Inter. During his final season with the club, he also gained notoriety for a particular incident in a home match against his former club, Juventus, on 9 January 2000. Baggio committed a foul on Gianluca Zambrotta, and was shown a controversial straight red card by referee Stefano Farina. In protest, Baggio made the &quot;money sign&quot; towards the referee, and subsequently spat on the ground close to Farina. Baggio was criticised for his behaviour, and was handed a two match ban, in addition to being fined 20 million lire, by his club, for the gesture. He was also prevented by Luciano Nizzola, the FIGC president at the time, from taking part in Italy&#x27;s friendly match against Sweden, on 23 February 2000.

===Later career===
In October 2000, Baggio was sold to the newly crowned Serie A champions Lazio for 10 billion Italian lire, along with Nestor Sensini. He was utilized very little during his time at the club in the 2001–02 and the 2002–03 seasons, and the club failed to win any silverware. At the beginning of the 2003–04 season, he was in talks with English club Wolverhampton, who were newly promoted to the FA Premier League, over a possible loan deal, but negotiations fell through; he was eventually loaned to English club Blackburn Rovers for the season in September 2003, following an impressive trial with the team. He made his first appearance for the club as a substitute in a 3–1 home defeat to Liverpool in the Premier League on 13 September, while his first start for the team came on 24 September, in a 3–1 away defeat to Gençlerbirliği, in the first round of the UEFA Cup; the following month, the team exited the competition following a 1–1 draw in the second leg, during which Baggio made a substitute appearance, replacing compatriot Corrado Grabbi. Baggio&#x27;s manager at Blackburn, Graeme Souness, employed him in an unfamiliar forward role occasion, however, which had a negative impact on his performances. Baggio made 9 appearances for the club in total, scoring once in the league in a 2–1 defeat against Leeds United. Due to his negative performances throughout the first half of the season, Souness attempted to have Baggio return to Italy on loan to newly promoted Serie A side Ancona in January 2004, but the player initially rejected the deal. Soon afterwards, however Lazio loaned him out to Ancona. He made 15 appearances and scored 2 goals, but Ancona finished dead last. He remained with Lazio in 2004–05 season, but did not make a single appearance for the club that season. He retired in 2005 after a short spell with Serie B side Triestina, at the age of 34. In February 2008 it was announced that Dino Baggio decided to come back from retirement and join the Terza Categoria side Tombolo — a team near his hometown, coached by his very first coach, Cesare Crivellaro.

==International career==
At youth international level, Baggio won the 1992 European U-21 Championship with the &quot;Azzurrini&quot;, and in the same year, he took part in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona with the Italian Under-23 side, under manager Cesare Maldini. Baggio made his international debut with the senior Italian squad under Arrigo Sacchi, on 21 December 1991, at the age of 20, in a 2–0 victory against Cyprus, in Foggia. He featured in the match along with fellow debutant Demetrio Albertini, who would play alongside Baggio in midfield with Italy for much of the 1990s. On 24 February, he scored his first goal for Italy, in Oporto, against Portugal.

After representing Italy during their 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, notably scoring the winning goal against Portugal, which allowed Italy to qualify for the tournament, Baggio was named a member of Italy&#x27;s 1994 FIFA World Cup squad under Arrigo Sacchi. In his first World Cup, he combined with his unrelated namesake Roberto Baggio; together, they helped Italy to reach the 1994 World Cup final, scoring decisive goals, only to lose to Brazil on penalties. Dino scored two goals in the tournament: his first was a decisive match-winning header, assisted by Giuseppe Signori, in Italy&#x27;s first-round 1–0 victory over Norway, and his second was the opening goal in a 2–1 win against Spain in the quarter-finals, which came from a strike from distance, assisted by Roberto Donadoni. In the final, he started in midfield against Brazil alongside Albertini in the team&#x27;s 4–4–2 formation, but was later replaced in extra-time by Alberigo Evani; following a 0–0 draw, the match went to a penalty shoot-out, which saw Brazil emerge victorious, with Baggio&#x27;s namesake Roberto missing the decisive final kick. According to &quot;FIFA.com&quot;, the lack of attacking play in the match was in part down to strong holding midfield play by Dino Baggio for Italy, and Dunga and Mauro Silva for Brazil.

Baggio would continue to play in other tournaments for Italy throughout the 1990s, such as Euro &#x27;96, in which the Italians were eliminated in the first round. Baggio also played in every game for Italy at the 1998 World Cup under Cesare Maldini, which would prove to be his last major tournament with the Azzurri; Italy were eliminated on penalties once again by hosts and eventual champions France, after reaching the quarter-finals of the tournament. Baggio was initially in Dino Zoff&#x27;s provisional 26-man Italy squad for Euro 2000, before missing the final cut. He made his final appearance for Italy on 13 November 1999, in a 3–1 home defeat to Belgium in an international friendly match.

In total, Baggio amassed 60 caps and scored 7 goals for the Italy national team between 1991 and 1999. He is remembered as a notable international player of the 90s by the Italian fans due to his World Cup performances, and as he was able to obtain a first-team midfield spot over many other talented players in their prime, such as Roberto Donadoni, Luigi Di Biagio, Demetrio Albertini, Roberto Di Matteo, Nicola Berti, Alberigo Evani, Attilio Lombardo, Diego Fuser, Francesco Moriero, Sandro Cois, Stefano Fiore, Fernando De Napoli, Antonio Conte, Angelo Di Livio, Gianluca Pessotto, Carlo Ancelotti, Giancarlo Marocchi, Giuseppe Giannini, Giuseppe Signori, Roberto Baggio, Roberto Mancini, and Gianfranco Zola, among others.

==Style of play==
Baggio was a complete, well-rounded, hard-working, tenacious and tactically versatile player, who was capable of playing in various midfield positions and was deployed as a central midfielder as well as a box-to-box midfielder throughout his career, although his primary position was in a defensive midfield role, where he excelled at breaking down the opposition&#x27;s attacking plays. Throughout his career, he was deployed in every position on the pitch. A tall, aggressive and dynamic defensive midfielder, he was gifted with physical strength, tackling ability, pace, positional sense and stamina, as well as solid technique, good vision and reliable distribution, which also enabled him to aid his team creatively and start attacks after winning back possession, despite not being the most naturally gifted player on the ball.

Baggio was regarded as one of the greatest Italian players of his generation, and as one of the most consistent midfielders in Serie A during the 90s. Despite functioning primarily as a ball-winner, who would then supply the ball to more creative midfielders, he was also able to contribute offensively and score goals due to his ability to make late attacking runs into the area, as well as his proficiency in the air and his accuracy with his head; he also had a penchant for scoring from powerful, accurate shots and volleys from distance, courtesy of his striking ability, in particular from outside the penalty box. Because of his eye for goal, he was occasionally deployed out of position as a striker by his manager Souness during his time with Blackburn.

<doc id="1234161" wikidata="Q17143375" url="?curid=1234161" title="Waldenbooks">
<text>Walden Book Company, Inc., doing business as Waldenbooks, was an American shopping mall-based bookstore chain and a subsidiary of Borders. The chain also ran a video game and software chain under the name Waldensoftware, as well as a children&#x27;s educational toy chain under Walden Kids. In 2011, the chain was liquidated in bankruptcy.

==History==
On March 4, 1933, Lawrence Hoyt (1902–1982), a former sales manager for Simon &amp; Schuster, and Melvin T. Kafka (1905–1992) opened a rental library within leased space inside a Bridgeport, Connecticut, department store under the name Walden Book Company (named for Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot;, a meditation on simple living in natural surroundings). The pair believed that their business would help people cope with the effects of the Great Depression. Books were lent out for three cents per day to save customers the cost of purchasing the books while providing affordable entertainment. By 1948, Hoyt and Kafka had opened 250 book rental locations. 

Hoyt opened the first Walden bookstore in Pittsburgh in 1962. Within 15 years, the company had grown to over 250 locations in leased locations within various department stores. With the increased availability of low-cost paperbacks after the Second World War, rental library services were eventually replaced with retail book selling.

===Acquisitions===
By the 1970s, the company had sales of just under $200 million. In 1969, it was purchased by the Broadway Hale Stores, a California-based department-stores holding company that was later renamed Carter Hawley Hale in 1974. For the stand-alone bookstores, the company initially traded under the name &quot;Walden Books&quot;, written as two words. During the 1970s, the company gradually changed its trade name to &quot;Waldenbooks&quot;, written as a single word.

In 1984, Waldenbooks acquired three stores that were located in upscale neighborhoods from the bankrupted Brentano&#x27;s chain with the original intent of converting the stores to the Waldenbooks brand, However, Waldenbooks discovered that when they continued to operate the newly acquired stores as Brentano&#x27;s, the new stores were generating more sales than equivalent Waldenbooks, so Waldenbooks decided to continue and expand the Brentano&#x27;s brand in select upscale neighborhoods.

In 1984, Waldenbooks itself was acquired by Kmart after Carter Hawley Hale needed to get cash to defend itself from a hostile takeover attempt. At that time, Waldenbooks was the largest retail bookstore chain. Under Kmart&#x27;s ownership, Walden attempted to expand and diversify its business. In 1985, it opened a discount book outlet chain called Reader&#x27;s Market by converting five existing stand-alone Waldenbooks stores. A year later, Walden discontinued the discount bookstores after disappointing sales figures. Walden later tried this concept within selected Kmart stores.
After terminating the discount book strategy, Walden began experimenting with larger stores by opening Waldenbooks &amp; More stores that included merchandise beyond books, WaldenSoftware computer software stores, and WaldenKids educational toys stores. In 1987, Waldenbooks acquired the U.S. stores of the Canadian bookstore chain Coles Book Stores Ltd. and gradually converted the stores to Waldenbooks. By 1990, Waldenbooks began to convert Waldenbooks &amp; More into even larger Waldenbooks &amp; More Books stores with a greatly expanded book selection.

In 1992, Walden opened nine book superstores under the Basset Book Shop name; ultimately these stores were converted to Borders locations after the merger.

Kmart expanded its bookstore holdings by acquiring Borders in 1992. At that time, Kmart kept Borders and Waldenbooks separate, but converted Waldenbooks&#x27; Bassett stores to the Borders brand.

When Kmart decided to spin off its noncore subsidiaries in 1994, Kmart merged Waldenbooks, Brentano&#x27;s, and Borders to form the Borders-Walden Group. At that time, Waldenbooks had 1,216 stores in all 50 states. In 1995, the renamed Borders Group was able to buy back its stock and it was listed independently on the New York Stock Exchange.

Beginning in 2004, many Waldenbooks locations were rebranded as Borders Express stores. Borders Group, in an attempt to increase profits and lower the overall expense of their Waldenbooks brand, also announced that it was downsizing the Waldenbooks chain to respond to the current &quot;competitive environment&quot;. In January 2010, 200 stores, almost two-thirds of the total, were closed.

On July 18, 2011, Borders Group filed for liquidation to close all of its remaining Waldenbooks and other stores. Liquidation commenced on July 22, 2011.

*In season 4, episode 9 (Nov. 25, 1977 air date) of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; titled &quot;The Mayor&#x27;s Committee from Deer Lick Falls&quot;, Jim Rockford is looking for someone in a mall and stands outside a Waldenbooks.
*In season 6, episode 13 (air date January 26, 1995) of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; titled “The Scofflaw”, several scenes take place in a Waldenbooks, where Jake Jarmel has book signings and interactions with the other characters. A Waldenbooks store is also shown in season 8, episode 21 (“The Muffin Tops”), where J. Peterman signs his autobiography.
*On July 16, 2018, streaming service Netflix released a teaser for the upcoming third season of its hit series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. The ad was made in the style of a 1985 mall advertisement, and includes an image of a &quot;newly opened&quot; Waldenbooks store among its offerings. In reality, the crew of &quot;Stranger Things&quot; did a cosmetic restoration of a portion of the Gwinnett Place Mall in Duluth, Georgia, returning authentic signage and storefronts to the mall to represent many businesses that have since ceased to exist.

<doc id="1234167" wikidata="Q2257964" url="?curid=1234167" title="The Terminal Man">
<text>The Terminal Man is a novel by American writer Michael Crichton. It is his second novel under his own name and his twelfth overall, and is about the dangers of mind control. It was published in April 1972, and also serialized in &quot;Playboy&quot; in March, April, and May 1972. In 1974, it was made into a film of the same name.

==Plot summary==
The events in the novel take place between March 9 and March 13, 1971. Harold Franklin &quot;Harry&quot; Benson, a computer scientist in his mid-thirties, is described as suffering from &quot;psychomotor epilepsy&quot; following a car crash two years earlier. He often has seizures followed by blackouts, and then wakes up hours later with no knowledge of what he has done. During these seizures, he severely beats two people; the day before his admission, he was arrested after attacking a third. He is a prime candidate for an operation to implant an electronic &quot;brain pacemaker&quot; in the amygdala region of his brain in order to control the seizures, which will be performed in the Neuro-Psychiatric Service (NPS) of University Hospital. Two NPS surgeons, John Ellis and Robert Morris, are to perform the unprecedented surgery.

The ramifications of the procedure are questioned by the NPS&#x27;s staff psychiatrist, Janet Ross, and later by her former teacher, Manon, an emeritus professor. Manon raises concerns that Benson is psychotic and predicts that the crimes he commits during the blackouts will not be curtailed. Ellis admits that what they are doing is not a cure for Benson&#x27;s personality disorder, but will simply stimulate the brain preventatively when a computer senses an oncoming seizure. Ellis argues he is not convinced that not operating will do Benson any favors; Benson&#x27;s condition threatens Benson&#x27;s life and those of others, has already undermined Benson&#x27;s legal status three times, and is worsening. Despite the concerns voiced, the team decides to go ahead with the operation.

Forty electrodes are implanted into Benson&#x27;s brain, controlled by a small computer that is powered by a plutonium power pack in his shoulder. Benson must wear a dog tag with instructions to call University Hospital if he is injured, as his power pack may emit radiation. During the procedure, the implant deviates slightly from its planned path, but this is corrected. While he is recovering, a woman identifying herself as Angela Black gives Morris a black wig for Benson following the surgery, whose head was shaved prior to the operation. Morris refuses a man who volunteers to have electrodes put into his brain to stimulate pleasure unchecked, because he realizes that people like Benson could potentially become addicts; he recalls a Norwegian man with schizophrenia who was allowed to stimulate himself as much as desired, to the extent that the man caused himself brain damage. Roger A. McPherson, the head of the NPS, interviews Benson and realizes Manon and Ross were right about his psychosis, ordering nurses to administer thorazine to Benson.

After resting for a day, Benson goes through &quot;interfacing&quot;. The electrodes are activated one by one to test which ones would stop a seizure. Each electrode produces different results; one stimulates a sexual pleasure. Gerhard, one of the technicians administering the test, shows his findings to Ross, who discovers that the seizures are becoming more frequent. She explains that Benson is learning to initiate seizures voluntarily because the result of these seizures is a shock of pleasure, which leads to him having more frequent seizures. Ross further discovers that, due to a clerical error by the nurses, Benson has not been receiving thorazine. She then finds out that Benson, using the wig and disguising himself as an orderly, has evaded the police officer assigned to guard him and escaped from the hospital.

Ross goes to Benson&#x27;s house, where she finds two girls who say he has a gun and possesses blueprints for the basement of the hospital, where the computer mainframe is located. Morris meets Benson&#x27;s boss, who tells him that Benson disliked University Hospital because of its ultra-modern computer system, an upgraded IBM System/360. After Benson&#x27;s dogtag is found at the murder scene of Angela Black, Ross is questioned by police. Benson confronts Ross in her house and attacks her upon having a seizure. Just before losing consciousness, Ross manages to turn on her microwave oven, the radiation of which affects the power pack in Benson&#x27;s shoulder and forces him to flee. Morris uses a book of matches found on Angela&#x27;s body to track Benson to an airport hotel. Finding a mechanic who has been beaten by Benson, Morris is attacked and injured as well.

Back at the hospital, Ross receives a phone call from Benson, which is traced to somewhere inside the building. The hospital&#x27;s computers begin to malfunction, as if somebody were disturbing the mainframe. Ross and Anders go down into the basement, where Anders exchanges fire with and injures Benson before becoming lost in the maze of corridors. Benson goes back to the computer room and finds Ross. Ross picks up Benson&#x27;s gun and, after an internal struggle, shoots and kills Benson unintentionally.

==Background==
At one stage it was known as &quot;The Sympathetic Man&quot;.

Crichton stated that this was his least favorite work.

== Film adaptation ==
The novel was made into a film in 1974.

==Reception==
Like his previous bestseller &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;, reviews for &quot;The Terminal Man&quot; were widely positive. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;an entertaining and unsparing narrative, compressed and scientifically sound.&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the novel &quot;A fascinating, splendidly documented thriller.&quot;
&quot;Life&quot; said it was &quot;An absolutely riveting novel.&quot; John Barkham Reviews called it &quot;A superb thriller...&quot; and said &quot;It will make you think-and shudder.&quot;

The novel was criticized by the American Epilepsy Foundation who said it unfairly linked epilepsy with violence.

==Real life epilepsy device==
Crichton&#x27;s technological sci-fi premise became reality half a century later, in 2023, when a British boy had a neurostimulator fitted inside his skull, sending electrical signals deep into his brain to control seizures.

<doc id="1234174" wikidata="Q795071" url="?curid=1234174" title="Limited government">
<text>In political philosophy, limited government is the concept of a government limited in power. It is a key concept in the history of liberalism.

==History==
Magna Carta and the U.S. Constitution also represent important milestones in the limiting of governmental power. The earliest use of the term &quot;limited government&quot; dates back to King James VI and I in the late 16th century. Scholar Steven Skultety argues that although Aristotle never developed principles and tactics of constitutionalism, Aristotle&#x27;s political philosophy in some ways anticipated the idea of limited government, primarily as a tool for limiting civic distrust and enhancing stability.

John Locke, a liberal philosopher, was an important theorist of liberal government. Writing in his &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;, Locke reasoned that men living in a state of nature would voluntarily join in a social contract, forming a &quot;commonwealth&quot; or government. Locke further reasoned that the powers of the government had to be restricted to only what the people allowed it to do. He cites four specific limitations on government power. Locke&#x27;s first limitation specified that governments could only govern according to promulgated established laws, and that all people were equal under the law, regardless of their material or social status, and Locke&#x27;s second limitation held that laws could only be designed in the name of the common good (2nd Tr., § 136). His third limitation repeated the principle of no taxation without representation, arguing that, &quot;[governments] must not raise taxes on the property of the people, without the consent of the people, given by themselves, or their deputies&quot; (2nd Tr., § 142). Finally, Locke argued in his fourth limitation that the legislature could not delegate law-making authority to any other power without the people&#x27;s consent (2nd Tr., § 141).

When limited government is put into practice, it often involves the protection of individual liberty from government intrusion.

According to The World Justice Project Rule of Law Index which measures adherence to the rule of law in 140 countries and jurisdictions around the globe, checks on government powers eroded in 58% of countries measured from 2021 to 2022.

==Issues==

Amy Gutmann notes that &quot;negative liberalism&quot;, &quot;positive liberalism&quot;, and &quot;democratic liberalism&quot; all advance different conceptions of the proper limits to government. Gutmann connects the first two categories to Isaiah Berlin&#x27;s notions of negative liberty and positive liberty, respectively. Gutmann defends the third category, democratic liberalism, writing that under this view, &quot;a liberal government should be no more nor less limited than is needed, first, to secure basic liberties and opportunities for all individuals, and second to respect the outcomes of fair democratic procedures as long as they are consistent to the constitutional constraints of securing basic liberties and opportunities for all.&quot;

==Relationship to constitutions==
Limited government is closely associated with constitutions and constitutionalism; the United States Constitution of 1789 and the French Constitution of 1793 were both enacted in an effort to reaffirm limited government, although in different ways. The U.S. Constitution achieved limited government through a separation of powers: &quot;horizontal&quot; separation of powers distributed power among branches of government (the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary, each of which provide a check on the powers of the other); &quot;vertical&quot; separation of powers (federalism) divided power between the federal government and the state government. James Madison, one of the authors of the Federalist Papers, noted that the Framers of the American Constitution sought to create a government that was capable of both being controlled and of exercising control. Madison wrote in Federalist No. 51 that &quot;the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department, the necessary constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the others.&quot;

The 1793 French Constitution, on the other hand, cherished legislative supremacy and was based on the idea influenced by Rousseau – that limited government was best achieved through a &quot;rational democratic self-government seeking to give expression to the general will ... as the optimal antidote to the arbitrary rule of absolute monarchy.&quot;

<doc id="1234175" wikidata="Q1263095" url="?curid=1234175" title="Dublin City F.C.">
<text>Dublin City Football Club was a former Irish association football club based in the Northside of Dublin. The club played in the League of Ireland. They were formed in 1999 after a split within Home Farm Everton and they originally played as Home Farm Fingal before changing their name for the 2001–02 season. They disbanded in 2006 due to financial problems.

== History ==
Home Farm is one of the biggest junior football clubs in Ireland and their senior team, from 1970 up to the late 1990s, played in the League of Ireland. However, the link between Home Farm and the senior team was severed in the late 1990s. The senior side was briefly known as Home Farm Fingal in an effort to identify it with the north Dublin area. In 1999, Home Farm Fingal CEO Ronan Seery took over the club and renamed it &quot;Dublin City&quot;. The club was based in Dublin and in 2006, its final year of operation, played their home matches at Dalymount Park. The last manager was Dermot Keely.

Nicknamed &quot;The Vikings&quot;, they adopted the same colours as the Dublin GAA team. Their shirt sponsor was Carrolls of Dublin, a chain of tourist souvenir shops, which sold club-branded merchandise at its stores in the city centre and Dublin Airport.

The club was twice promoted to the League of Ireland Premier Division, winning the 2003 League of Ireland First Division and then defeating Shamrock Rovers in a promotion/relegation play-off in 2005. In addition to its small following, the club had no permanent home ground, playing at various times in Tolka Park, Dalymount Park, Morton Stadium, Richmond Park, and Whitehall Stadium. However, they failed to cultivate a significant fan base, and very low attendance was reported at their games. As a result of these factors, the club experienced financial problems and as of July 19, 2006, Dublin City FC ceased trading and resigned from the league. The results of all their games to that point in the season were expunged from the record.

Ronan Seery issued a statement saying, &quot;Due to ongoing difficulties, our continued existence within the Eircom League simply became untenable and while extremely difficult to make, it is the most prudent and honourable decision and course of action to take.&quot; However, the club was heavily criticised in some quarters, for example by Damien Richardson and Roddy Collins for failing to complete their league fixtures. Roddy Collins, who managed Dublin City in 2004 but left abruptly on bad terms, called the club&#x27;s actions &quot;disgraceful.&quot;

<text>Sir William de Wiveleslie Abney (24 July 1843 – 3 December 1920) was an English astronomer, chemist, and photographer.

==Life and career==
Abney was born in Derby, England, the son of Rev. Edward Henry Abney (1811–1892), vicar of St Alkmund&#x27;s Church, Derby, and his wife, Catharine Strutt. His father was owner of the Firs Estate. William was educated at Rossall School, the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and joined the Royal Engineers in 1861, with which he served in India for several years. Thereafter, and to further his knowledge in photography, he became a chemical assistant at the Chatham School of Military Engineering.

Abney was a pioneer of several technical aspects of photography. His father had been an early photographic experimenter and friend of Richard Keene, an early Derby photographer. Keene became a close friend of William and his brother Charles Edward Abney (1850–1914). Both Abney sons subsequently became founder members of the Derby Photographic Society in June 1884. His endeavors in the chemistry of photography produced useful photographic products and also developments in astronomy. He wrote many books on photography that were considered standard texts at the time, although he was doubtful that his improvements would have a great impact on the subject.

Abney investigated the blackening of a negative to incidental light. In 1874, Abney developed a dry photographic emulsion, which replaced &quot;wet&quot; emulsions. He used this emulsion in an Egyptian expedition to photograph the transit of Venus across the sun. In 1880, he introduced hydroquinone. Abney also introduced new and useful types of photographic paper, including in 1882 a formula for gelatin silver chloride paper. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1876.

Abney conducted early research into the field of spectroscopy, developing a red-sensitive emulsion which was used for the infrared spectra of organic molecules. He was also a pioneer in photographing the infrared solar spectrum (1887), as well as researching sunlight in the medium of the atmosphere.

In 1893 he inherited Meashan Hall from a rich aunt.

He became assistant secretary to the Board of Education in 1899 and advisor to that body in 1903. In 1900 he was Director of the Science and Art Department. He sold his father&#x27;s estate, most of which went for housing in the St Luke&#x27;s Parish of Derby, but retained 11 acres until 1913 when they were purchased by the Council to become the site of Rykneld Secondary Modern School and Rykneld recreation ground.

Abney invented the &quot;Abney level&quot;, a combined clinometer and spirit level, used by surveyors to measure slopes and angles. He was responsible for the &quot;Abney mounting&quot; of a concave grating spectrograph in which the photographic plate was fixed and the entry slit moved to accommodate different regions of the spectrum.

He died on 3 December 1920 in Folkestone, England. He is buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church in Folkestone.

==Family==

He had married twice: firstly in 1864 to Agnes Matilda Smith (died 1888) with whom he had a son and two daughters, and secondly in 1890 to Mary Louisa Mead with whom he had a further daughter.

<doc id="1234177" wikidata="Q2062081" url="?curid=1234177" title="TDM over IP">
<text>In computer networking and telecommunications, TDM over IP (TDMoIP) is the emulation of time-division multiplexing (TDM) over a packet-switched network (PSN). TDM refers to a T1, E1, T3 or E3 signal, while the PSN is based either on IP or MPLS or on raw Ethernet. A related technology is circuit emulation, which enables transport of TDM traffic over cell-based (ATM) networks.

TDMoIP is a type of pseudowire (PW). However, unlike other traffic types that can be carried over pseudowires (e.g. ATM, Frame Relay and Ethernet), TDM is a real-time bit stream, leading to TDMoIP having unique characteristics. In addition, conventional TDM networks have numerous special features, in particular those required in order to carry voice-grade telephony channels. These features imply signaling systems that support a wide range of telephony features, a rich standardization literature and well-developed Operations and Management (OAM) mechanisms. All of these factors must be taken into account when emulating TDM over PSNs.

One critical issue in implementing TDM PWs is clock recovery. In native TDM networks the physical layer carries highly accurate timing information along with the TDM data, but when emulating TDM over PSNs this synchronization is absent. TDM timing standards can be exacting and conformance with these may require innovative mechanisms to adaptively reproduce the TDM timing.

Another issue that must be addressed is TDMoIP packet loss concealment (PLC). Since TDM data is delivered at a constant rate over a dedicated channel, the native service may have bit errors but data is never lost in transit. All PSNs suffer to some degree from packet loss and this must be compensated when delivering TDM over a PSN.

In December 2007 TDMoIP was approved as an IETF RFC 5087 authored by Dr. Yaakov Stein, Ronen Shashua, Ron Insler, and Motti Anavi of RAD Data Communications.

== Background ==
Communications service providers and enterprise customers are interested in deployment of voice and leased line services over efficient Ethernet, IP and MPLS infrastructures. While Voice over IP (VoIP) is maturing, its deployment requires an investment in new network infrastructure and customer premises equipment (CPE). TDMoIP presents a migration path, whereby modern packet switched networks can be used for transport, while the end-user equipment need not be immediately replaced.

TDMoIP was first developed in 1998 by RAD Data Communications (see U.S. patent number 6,731,649) and first deployed in Sweden in 1999 by Utfors (later acquired by Telenor). Utfors employed the first generation TDMoIP product (known as IPmux-4) to provide bundled services including TDM private lines, TDM leased lines and a variety of IP and Ethernet services. In 2001, the IETF set up the PWE3 working group, which was chartered to develop an architecture for edge-to-edge pseudowires, and to produce specifications for various services, including TDM. Other standardization forums, including the ITU and the MPLS - Frame Relay Alliance, are also active in producing standards and implementation agreements for pseudowires.

== Handling TDM structure ==
Although TDM can be used to carry arbitrary bit streams at the rates defined in G.702, there are standardized methods of carrying bit streams in larger units each containing the same number of bits, called frames. TDM framing locks the frame rate to the sampling frequency of voice traffic, so that there are always 8000 frames per second; a T1 frame consists of 193 bits and an E1 frame of 256 bits. 

Unlike unframed TDM for which all bits are available for payload, framed TDM requires dedicating of some number of bits per frame for synchronization and perhaps various other functions (e.g. 1 bit per T1 frame, 8 bits per E1 frame). Framed TDM is often used to multiplex multiple voice channels each consisting of 8000 8-bit samples per second in a sequence of timeslots recurring in each frame. When this is done we have &quot;channelized TDM&quot; and additional structure must be introduced.

In order to efficiently transport slowly varying channel associated signalling bits, second order structures known as multiframes or superframes are defined. For example, for E1 trunks the CAS signaling bits are updated once per multiframe of 16 frames (every 2 milliseconds) while for T1 ESF trunks the superframe is 24 frames (3 milliseconds). Other types of second order structures are also in common use. In GSM cellular networks, the Abis channel that connects the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and Base Station Controller (BSC) is an E1 link with several framing alternatives, all of which have a basic superframe duration of 20 milliseconds. 

The term &quot;structured TDM&quot; is used to refer to TDM with any level of structure, including &#x27;framed TDM&#x27; and &#x27;channelized TDM&#x27;. 

TDMoIP transport is denoted &quot;structured-agnostic&quot; when the TDM is unframed, or when it is framed or even channelized, but the framing and channelization structure are completely disregarded by the transport mechanisms. In such cases all structural overhead must be transparently transported along with the payload data, and the encapsulation method employed provides no mechanisms for its location or utilization. Structure-aware TDM transport may explicitly safeguard TDM structure, in three conceptually distinct ways, which we shall call structure-locking, structure-indication, and structure-reassembly. 

Structure-locking ensures that packets consist of entire TDM structures or multiples/fractions thereof. Structure-indication allows packets to contain arbitrary fragments of basic structures, but employs pointers to indicate where the following structure commences. In structure-reassembly components of the TDM structures may be extracted and reorganized at ingress, and the original structure reassembled from the received constituents at egress.

== TDMoIP format ==
TDMoIP operates by segmenting, adapting and encapsulating the TDM traffic at PSN ingress and performing the inverse operations at PSN egress. Adaptation denotes mechanisms that modify the payload to enable its proper restoration at the PSN egress. By using proper adaptation, the TDM signaling and timing can be recovered, and a certain amount of packet loss can be accommodated. Encapsulation signifies placing the adapted payload into packets of the format required by the underlying PSN technology. For the MPLS case, ITU-T Recommendation Y.1413 contains a complete description of the packet format.

In all cases a TDMoIP packet commences with PSN headers. These are the standard headers used by the PSN technology, e.g. the 20-byte header of UDP/IP, or the label-stack of MPLS. After these headers come the &quot;PW label&quot;, a four-byte MPLS-like label that serves as to demultiplex different TDM PWs. After the PSN header comes the four-byte TDMoIP &quot;control word&quot;. The control word contains a 16-bit packet sequence number (needed to detect packet re-ordering and packet loss), payload length, and flags indicating defect conditions. 

After the control word comes the TDMoIP payload. For structure-agnostic transport (SAToP) this is simply a predetermined number of TDM octets, while for the structure-locked format the payload is an integer number of TDM frames. For structure-indication and structure-reassembly TDMoIP draws on proven adaptation mechanisms originally developed for ATM. A side benefit of this choice of payload types is simplified interworking with circuit emulation services carried over ATM networks. For statically allocated, constant bit-rate (CBR) TDM links, TDMoIP employs ATM adaptation layer 1 (AAL1). This mechanism, defined in ITU-T standard I.363.1 and ATM Forum specification atm-vtoa-0078, was developed for carrying CBR services over ATM. AAL1 operates by segmenting the continuous stream of TDM data into small 48-byte cells and inserting sequencing, timing, error recovery, and synchronization information into them. TDMoIP allows concatenation of any number of AAL1 cells into a packet (note that these are AAL1 cells and not ATM cells, i.e. they do not include the five-byte &quot;cell tax&quot;). By allowing multiple cells per packet, TDMoIP facilitates flexible tradeoffs of buffering delay (which decreases with fewer cells per packet) for bandwidth efficiency (which increases with more cells per packet, due to the per packet overhead). For dynamically allocated TDM links, whether the information rate varies due to activation of time slots or due to voice activity detection, TDMoIP employs ATM adaptation layer 2 (AAL2). This mechanism, defined in ITU-T standard I.363.2, was developed for carrying variable bit rate (VBR) services over ATM. AAL2 operates by buffering each TDM time slot into short minicells, inserting the time slot identifier and length indication, sequencing, and then sending this minicell only if it carries valid information. TDMoIP concatenates the minicells from all active time slots into a single packet. For time slots carrying high-level data link control (HDLC) data, such as data for common channel signaling (CCS), TDMoIP has a special adaptation that encapsulates stretches of non-idle data. 

== Delay ==
The telephony network severely constrains end-to-end delays. ITU-T G.114/G.131 states that one-way transmission times of up to 150 ms are universally acceptable, assuming adequate echo control is provided. These constraints are not problematic for TDM networks, where the major component of the end-to-end delay is electrical propagation time (&quot;light speed delay&quot;). By contrast, IP-based systems typically add various forms of delay, one of which is based on the time it takes to form packets (packetization delay), which is proportional to the packet size divided by the data rate. Packet sizes cannot be made too small or the packet header overhead will become overwhelming. The other form of delay introduced by IP systems is the playout delay, which needs to be added at the recipient to buffer packet delay variation and ensure a smooth playout.
VoIP systems that try to be very bandwidth efficient may also add tens of milliseconds of algorithmic delay in the voice codec. Historically, bad implementations have added additional, operating-system induced delays, which together with the other delays in practice sometimes approach 100 ms even before taking propagation delays into account. 

In contrast, TDMoIP maps TDM octets directly into the payload with no voice compression algorithms and no resultant algorithmic delay. The packetization latency added by TDMoIP depends on the number of cells per packet but is typically in the single millisecond range due to the higher data rate of a complete multiplex as compared to a single VoIP flow. Playout delay considerations do not differ materially between TDMoIP and VoIP, however, so both work best on paths with controlled packet delay variation (strong overprovisioning or &quot;QoS&quot;).

=== Timing recovery ===
Native TDM networks rely on hierarchical distribution of timing. Somewhere in the network there is at least one extremely accurate primary reference clock with a long-term accuracy of 1 x 10^-11. This node, which offers Stratum 1 accuracy, provides the reference clock to secondary nodes with Stratum 2 accuracy. The secondary nodes then provide a time reference to Stratum 3 nodes. This hierarchy of time synchronization is essential for the proper functioning of the network as a whole. 

Packets in the PSN reach their destination with delay that has a random component, known as packet delay variation (PDV). When emulating TDM transport on such a network, this randomness may be overcome by placing the TDM packets into a jitter buffer from which data can be read out at a constant rate for delivery to TDM end-user equipment. The problem is that the TDM source time reference is no longer available, and the precise rate at which the data are to be &quot;clocked out&quot; of the jitter buffer is unknown. 

In certain cases timing may be derived from the TDM equipment at both ends of the PW. Since each of these clocks is highly accurate, they necessarily agree to high order. The problem arises when at most one side of the TDMoIP tunnel has a highly accurate time standard. For ATM networks, which define a physical layer that carries timing, the synchronous residual time stamp (SRTS) method may be used; IP/MPLS networks, however, do not define the physical layer and thus cannot specify the accuracy of its clock. 

Hence, in many cases the only alternative is to attempt to recover the clock based exclusively on the TDMoIP traffic, a technology known as &quot;adaptive clock recovery&quot;. This is possible since the source TDM device is producing bits at a constant rate determined by its clock, although this rate is hidden by the PDV. The task of clock recovery is thus an &quot;averaging&quot; process that negates the effect of the random PDV and captures the average rate of transmission of the original bit stream.

== Packet loss ==
While proper application of traffic engineering and quality of service (QoS) is expected to minimize packet loss, packets will at times arrive at the egress out of order. They may also have been dropped altogether within the PSN. The TDMoIP control word described above includes a 16-bit sequence number for detecting and handling lost and mis-ordered packets. In the case of lost packets, TDMoIP requires insertion of interpolation packets to maintain TDM timing. Misordered packets may be either reordered or dropped and interpolated. 

While the insertion of arbitrary packets may be sufficient to maintain the TDM timing, in voice applications packet loss can cause gaps or errors that result in choppy, annoying, or even unintelligible speech. The precise effect of packet loss on voice quality and the development of packet loss concealment algorithms have been the subject of detailed study in the VoIP community, but their results are not directly applicable to the TDMoIP case. This is because VoIP packets typically contain between 80 samples (10 ms) and 240 samples (30 ms) of the speech signal, while TDMoIP packets may contain only a small number of samples. Since TDMoIP packets are so small, it is acceptable to simply insert a constant value in place of any lost speech samples. Assuming that the input signal is zero-mean (i.e. contains no DC component), minimal distortion is attained when this constant is set to zero. Alternatively, more sophisticated approaches call for optimally predicting the values of missing samples.

<doc id="1234181" wikidata="Q313480" url="?curid=1234181" title="Gianluca Pagliuca">
<text>Gianluca Pagliuca (; born 18 December 1966) is an Italian football coach and former professional goalkeeper.

He is regarded by pundits as one of the greatest goalkeepers of his generation, and one of Italy&#x27;s best keepers ever. Throughout his career, he played for Sampdoria, Inter, Bologna, and Ascoli in Italy, winning several domestic and international trophies. At international level, he represented Italy at three FIFA World Cups (1990, 1994, and 1998), most notably reaching the 1994 World Cup final as Italy&#x27;s starting goalkeeper.

He is the player with the fifth most appearances (592), and the second best penalty-stopper (24 saves) in Serie A behind Samir Handanović, although other specialists such as Júlio César and Handanović have a higher success rate.

==Club career==
Pagliuca was born in Bologna. In his club career, he played for Sampdoria (1987–94), Internazionale (1994–99), Bologna (1999–2006), and Ascoli (2006–07). His most notable successes with Sampdoria include one Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and one &quot;Scudetto&quot;; he also reached a UEFA Champions League final, losing 1–0 to Barcelona in 1992, at Wembley, in spite of his impressive performance.

In 1994, he moved from Sampdoria to Internazionale from a then world record fee for a goalkeeper of £7 million. With the &quot;nerazzurri&quot; he reached two consecutive UEFA Cup finals, losing the first one against Schalke 04 in 1997 and winning the second one in 1998, when he captained the side to a 3–0 win over Lazio. Pagliuca left Inter in 1999, moving to his home town club, Bologna, after the former Juventus boss Marcello Lippi took charge of Inter and signed Angelo Peruzzi from his former club.

After Bologna were relegated to Serie B in 2004–05, despite Pagliuca&#x27;s outstanding season, he stayed with the club for one more year; then he returned to Serie A, accepting a contract with Ascoli for one year starting in summer of 2006. On 17 September 2006, Pagliuca set the record for most Serie A appearances for a goalkeeper, overtaking Dino Zoff, as he started against Messina. He retired at the end of the season.

==International career==

After taking part in the 1990 World Cup without playing a minute, Pagliuca overtook Walter Zenga, Stefano Tacconi and Luca Marchegiani, becoming first choice goalkeeper for Italy at the 1994 World Cup under Arrigo Sacchi. He received the dubious honour of being the first goalkeeper to be sent off in a World Cup match, when he was dismissed for handling outside his area against Norway. However, he returned after suspension to feature from the quarter-finals onwards with his team losing the final to Brazil in a penalty shootout. Despite the loss, Pagliuca became the first ever goalkeeper to save a penalty from a shootout in a World Cup final, denying Márcio Santos his shot.

In 1995, Pagliuca&#x27;s international career was halted by the emergence of Juventus goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi, his perceived career rival, and it would be two years before he returned to the Italy senior squad, although he took part at the Olympics with the under-21 side as an overage player in 1996. Under Cesare Maldini, Pagliuca would have taken part to the 1998 World Cup only as a back-up, but he earned the starting spot because of a last-minute injury to Peruzzi. He made one of the saves of the tournament, again against Norway, when he shot out a hand to prevent Tore André Flo&#x27;s point-blank header from netting. However, Italy lost against host country France in the quarter-final after the penalty shootout, even though Pagliuca blocked Bixente Lizarazu&#x27;s shot.

After the tournament, the emergence of fellow keepers Francesco Toldo and Gianluigi Buffon (who were, themselves, Pagliuca&#x27;s deputies in the 1998 World Cup), along with Peruzzi&#x27;s recovery from his injury, put an end to Pagliuca&#x27;s international career on 39 caps.

== Post-retirement career ==
Pagliuca went into coaching upon retirement. He re-joined his hometown club Bologna as a youth coach in 2014, and was appointed goalkeeping coach of the club&#x27;s primavera (under 19) team in 2016, a role he continues to occupy. He also provides regular interviews and commentary to the Italian and international sporting media.

==Style of play==
An agile, consistent and athletic goalkeeper, Pagliuca was renowned for his excellent reactions, diving saves, and penalty-stopping abilities, as well as his control of the ball, accurate distribution, and deep goal kicks with his left foot. In addition to being very gifted acrobatics-wise, he also possessed a good positional sense. Although he was capable of coming off the line to handle crosses, he performed better between the posts. Nicknamed &quot;The Wall&quot;, due to his goalkeeping abilities and consistency, he also distinguished himself by his strong temper, which occasionally had a negative impact on his performances, when he let his emotions get the better of him.

Under coaches Sven-Göran Eriksson and Arrigo Sacchi, who relied on high defensive lines, Pagliuca used to play as a sweeper-keeper. Known for his dedication, physical conditioning, and work-rate, Pagliuca also stood out for his ability to avoid injury and longevity throughout his career.

==Personal life==

Pagliuca was born in Bologna, Emilia-Romagna and supports local side Bologna FC 1909, to which he also made 248 appearances at between 1999 and 2006. Furthermore, Pagliuca has also spoken of his support for Premier League club Aston Villa F.C.

His son Mattia Pagliuca is also a professional footballer. He made his Serie A debut in December 2020 for Bologna FC 1909 as a winger.

<doc id="1234182" wikidata="Q619097" url="?curid=1234182" title="Apollo Bay">
<text>Apollo Bay is a coastal town in southwestern Victoria, Australia. It is situated on the eastern side of Cape Otway, along the edge of the Barham River and on the Great Ocean Road, in the Colac Otway Shire. The town had a population of 1,790 at the .

It is a major tourist destination in Victoria. It is host to the annual Apollo Bay Seafood Festival, Winter Wild and the Great Ocean Road Running Festival. 

In winter to spring, southern right whales come to the area mainly to breed, bear their calves, and raise them in the warmer, calm waters of South Australia during their migration season. Less frequently, humpback whales can be seen off the coast.

==History==

Apollo Bay is part of the traditional lands of the Gadubanud, or King Parrot people, of the Cape Otway coast. By the early 19th century, the area was being frequented by sealers and whalers from Sydney. One local Indigenous name for the area, of uncertain language origin, is &#x27;Krambruk&#x27;.

The bay was named by a Captain Loutit in 1845 when he sheltered his vessel, the &quot;Apollo&quot;, here from a storm.

The first European settlers were timber cutters in the 1850s who subsequently established sawmills. Although the bay provided a relatively sheltered anchorage, the lack of a suitable pier meant that logs were floated out to sea to be loaded on to ships. A township on Apollo Bay was surveyed in 1853 and named Middleton. In the 1860s, farming land was made available and in the mid 1870s, the first blocks in the township were offered for sale. Middleton post office (with a fortnightly mail delivery) opened on 1 May 1873. A school was opened in 1880.

In 1881, the town and post office was renamed Krambruk. That was changed to Apollo Bay in 1898. During this period almost the only access to the area was by sea, but a coach service from Birregurra to Apollo Bay was inaugurated in 1889. The pier at Point Bunbury was swept away in a storm, as was a second pier at that site. Consequently, the &quot;Long Pier&quot; was built at a more sheltered site in 1892.

The town plan indicated that Pascoe Street would be the main thoroughfare, but the erection of several buildings on Collingwood Street meant that it became Apollo Bay&#x27;s commercial centre. With the upgrade of the road to the town in 1927, and then the completion of the Great Ocean Road in 1932, the area became a tourist destination and an important fishing port.

On 10 July 1932 the coastal steamer &quot;Casino&quot; sank while attempting to berth at the town jetty. Ten people died. Many earlier shipwrecks had occurred along the Cape Otway coastline.

In 1936 a submarine telegraph and telephone cable from Apollo Bay to Stanley provided the first telephone connection to Tasmania from the mainland. The Apollo Bay Telegraph station closed in 1963 and is now a museum.

==Climate==
Apollo Bay has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with mild summers and damp winters.

==Events and festivals==
Events and festivals that have been held in Apollo Bay include:
* Winterwild
* Great Ocean Road Running Festival
* Apollo Bay Seafood Festival
* Apollo Bay and Otway District Agricultural Show
* The Apollo Bay Music Festival (first held in 1993 and last held in 2013). A poster for the festival of 1999 by Jeff Ragus was featured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post in 2006.

==Media==
The local radio station is Apollo Bay Radio (community) on 87.6 FM, broadcasting from studios in Apollo Bay. Also available in Apollo Bay is Mixx FM (commercial) on 95.9 FM, OCR FM (community) on 88.7 FM, Flow FM (commercial) on 97.9 FM, and 774 ABC Melbourne (national) on 89.5 FM.

==Sport==

Apollo Bay is host to various sports clubs, including:
*Apollo Bay Surf Lifesaving Club, which was established in 1952 as a result of a meeting held on the foreshore by interested townspeople and Surf Lifesaving Victoria officials. The Apollo Bay SLSC became the ninth club to be affiliated with Surf Lifesaving Victoria. It is now affiliated with Life Saving Victoria, following the merger of the Victorian branch of the Royal Life Saving Society Australia and Surf Life Saving Victoria.
*Apollo Bay Sailing Club, which provides opportunities for sailing to people of a diverse range of abilities and age groups.

<text>.mx is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Mexico, which in 2009 was re-opened to new registrations by NIC México. In 2009, the .mx ccTLD was rolled out in three steps:
* Sunrise period from 1 May to 31 July 2009, waiting period, registrants who have already registered any other .MX second-level domain were able to register their domain for one year
* Waiting period from 1 August to 31 August 2009, to set up the domains registered in the Sunrise period, and to resolve domain name disputes
* Initial registration period from 1 September to 31 October 2009; in this part the registration will be done with the policy first-come, first-served and only for one year with a special set of prices.

After the three phases, .mx registrations was opened to the public.

==Second-level domains==
Up to August 2009 domain registrations besides .MX, consist of third-level names beneath second-level names which parallel some of the top-level domains:

* .com.mx: Commercial entities (actually unrestricted, like .com)
* .net.mx: Network providers (registration limited to qualifying entities)
* .org.mx: Non-profit organizations (registration limited to qualifying entities)
* .ngo.mx: Non-profit organizations or Civil society organizations (registration NOT limited to qualifying entities)
* .edu.mx: Educational institutions (registration limited to qualifying entities)
* .gob.mx: Federal, State or Municipal Governmental entities only (&quot;.gob&quot; derives from the Spanish word for government: &quot;Gobierno&quot;)

Currently second level domains can be registered directly under .mx.

On 30 April 2009, second level domain registrations were 0.06% of the total. A month later the value was up to 4.9% On 30 April 2010, second level registrations were 21.4% of the total.

<doc id="1234193" wikidata="Q2903347" url="?curid=1234193" title="Bill Scott (voice actor)">
<text>William John Scott (August 2, 1920 – November 29, 1985) was an American voice actor, writer and producer for animated cartoons, primarily associated with Jay Ward and UPA, as well as one of the founding members of ASIFA-Hollywood. He is probably best known as the head writer, co-producer and the voice of several characters from the popular programs &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; and &quot;The Bullwinkle Show.&quot;

==Early life==
Scott was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on August 2, 1920. The family later moved to Trenton, New Jersey. At the age of 15, Bill developed tuberculosis. Having been told that Denver, Colorado was the best place for tuberculosis treatment, the family moved to Denver in 1936. His father worked there as a machinist, and his mother worked as a waitress at the Brown Palace Hotel. Scott graduated from South High School in Denver, and then graduated from the University of Denver in 1941. He majored in Theater and Dramatic Art, and minored in English. He was trained to be a school teacher, but after trying teaching, he decided he wanted a different career. He then worked as a freelance radio performer on several Denver radio stations. 

==Career==
During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army&#x27;s First Motion Picture Unit (reporting to Lt. Ronald Reagan), where he worked with such animators as Frank Thomas. After the war, he became what was then known as a &quot;story man&quot; at Warner Bros., working under director Arthur Davis. After a job as a writer on Bob Clampett&#x27;s &quot;Time For Beany&quot; television puppet show, he later worked at United Productions of America where he was one of the writers who adapted Dr. Seuss&#x27;s original story for the 1950 Academy Award-winning short &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot;, which later became a television show, as well as adapting the 1953 Academy Award-nominated short film of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;. He was later let go by UPA. Scott believed this was because UPA was under political pressure during the Red Scare of the 1950s. He believed UPA that consequently dismissed his co-writer for participating in left-wing activities, and threw out Scott as well in the process. 

Scott then went on to work on animated cartoons for John Sutherland Productions. This work was mainly on behalf of business organizations, such as the United States Chamber of Commerce. While this work reflected more conservative values than his own, he stayed there for four years because the company paid its writers well. He grew weary of the messages his employer wanted in his work, and tried to leave, but said &quot;I kept trying to tell them I quit, but they kept stuffing my mouth with money.&quot; He finally left and went back to work for UPA for a time. 

Scott worked as a voice actor as well when he joined Jay Ward as head writer and co-producer, and voice acted in such television series as &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot; (most notably as Bullwinkle and Mister Peabody, as well as Dudley Do-Right). In a 1982 interview, Scott said, &quot;I got a call from Jay [Ward] asking if I&#x27;d be interested in writing another series, an adventure script with a moose and a squirrel. I said, &#x27;Sure.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t know if I could write an adventure with a moose and a squirrel, but I never turned down a job.&quot; Scott never received an on-screen credit for his voice acting on any of the Ward series.

He also wrote many commercials for General Mills because General Mills had financed much of &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show,&quot; and the Quaker Oats Company, most notably those for Cap&#x27;n Crunch cereal. The voices of Rocky, Nell Fenwick and many of the feminine roles were performed by June Foray, although Scott&#x27;s wife, Dorothy, voiced several female parts as well.

Scott was a voice director on &quot;The Gerald McBoing-Boing Show&quot; and a dialogue director on the 1959 animated comedy feature film &quot;1001 Arabian Nights&quot;.

He starred in the &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; series as George, Super Chicken, and Tom Slick, as well as &quot;Fractured Flickers&quot; and &quot;Hoppity Hooper&quot;. Scott also did live-action acting on the television show &quot;The Duck Factory&quot;, which starred Jim Carrey, as well as featuring noted voice actors Don Messick and Frank Welker. In the episode &quot;The Annie Awards&quot;, Scott plays the emcee at an award ceremony for cartoonists.

Scott was a member of the Screen Cartoonist&#x27;s Guild of which he was President in 1952. He was also a member of the Screen Actors Guild and was elected to the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

==Later career==
Toward the end of his career, Scott worked for Disney, where he voiced Moosel on &quot;The Wuzzles&quot;, and was Gruffi Gummi, Sir Tuxford, and Toadwart, aka Toadie in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; (he was succeeded by Corey Burton, Roger C. Carmel, and Brian Cummings after his death). &quot;Gummi Bears&quot;, his last role, had also reunited him with June Foray, his &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; co-star. Scott was also a singer and performer, active with a Little Theatre group in Tujunga called the Foothill Curtain Raisers, and a church theater, the Ascension Players. He was a member of the choir at Ascension Episcopal Church, Tujunga, and spent time in church leadership there as Senior Warden. He was also a member of the Cañada-Savoy G&amp;S troupe in La Cañada, California.

==Death==
Scott died of a heart attack at age 65 on November 29, 1985, in Tujunga, Los Angeles, California. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the Santa Barbara Channel off Ventura.

<text>United Mizo Freedom Organisation (UMFO), was a political party in the Lushai Hills (today the Indian state of Mizoram). UMFO was founded on 20 July 1947, as a split from the Mizo Union. At the time of Indian independence, UMFO was the second largest political force in the area.

==History==
The Mizo Union was formed on the onset of Indian Independence to decide the political direction of the Mizo people. However, the party became contested with class divisions of common people against the autocracy of chieftainship. The elites and chiefs formed a right wing of the Mizo Union, which opposed a union with India, opting for independence. The issue became polarized closer towards independence. One of the members of the Mizo Union right wing wanted to join the Mizo areas of Burma and form a separate province in Burma. This led to the formation of the United Mizo Freedom Organisation, which was founded under Lalbiakthanga, an ex-Burmese Mizo military officer from Burma, on 5 July 1947. Lalmawia Khiangte a former King&#x27;s Commisionered Emergency Officer under the WW2 Britush Government and former Burmese employee held the position of General secretary.

The aims of the party were listed in eight points:
Pachhunga, the first president of the Mizo Union, who formed the right-wing opposing union, defected to the UMFO. His reputation as a wealthy businessman helped the party gain popularity. Lalwamia conducted a goodwill mission to Burma to meet with the Prime Minister U Nu. U Nu, a close associate of Jawaharlal Nehru and who was dependant on Indian aid for the internal insurgencies, stated with little enthusiasm that the inclusion of the Lushai Hills into Burma should only proceed with the endorsement of the wider Mizo population.

Superintendent L.L Peters convened a conference in Aizawl on 14th August 1947 of party leaders and chiefs to clarify the matter of Mizo ascension to another state. The inquiry concluded that the Lushai hills cannot leave the Indian state as it is an excluded area which is part of Assam legally. This barred the Lushai Hills from ascending to either Pakistan or Burma. A 10 year referendum on remaining within the union with India was proposed but this was not responded to in the inquiry. The union with India changed the party policy aim from Union with Burma to protecting the privileges of the chiefs with their support.

The party struggled with popular support. Public opinion supported the abolishment of chieftainship while the UMFO actively supported perpetuation of the institution. Due to this the party became known as &quot;Zalen Pawl&quot; which refers to the UMFO as the &#x27;party of the privileged&#x27;.

In the 1952 Assam Legislative Assembly election (which the Lushai Hills at that time was part of), UMFO put up three candidates, none of whom were elected. In total, the party received 9070 votes (23.76% of the votes in those three constituencies).

The UMFO had little bearing in opposing the union with India and abolishing chieftainship. In 1954, the India Tribal Union was established and articulated the demand for a hill state separate from Assam. The UMFO supported this notion early on, while the Mizo Union did not. The Mizo Union due to corruption and unpopular initiatives on land reform. The UMFO seized this with advances in Aizawl East and Lunglei constituencies. The skepticism of rejection of increased Mizo autonomy under the States Reorganization Act changed the political climate for the UMFO who did take initiative to increase Mizo autonomy. A memorandum was sent to the States Reorganization Commission for the need to establish a hill state for the hill peoples of Assam. The EITU won 10 of the 15 seats contested in the Assam Legislative Assembly.

The UMFO eventually dissolved the party and merged into the Eastern India Tribal Union (EITU) on 2 October 1957. This was in response to the implementation of Assamese as a state language, which motivated a variety of small hill tribe political parties to unite in contention.

<text>.my is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Malaysia. MYNIC is the agency responsible for the domain, and is under the Ministry of Digital and regulated by the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).

MYNIC administers the name space for .my, as well as its subdomains: .com.my, .org.my, .net.my, .biz.my, .coop.my, .edu.my, .gov.my, .mil.my, and .name.my. This involves the registration of domain names as well as the maintenance and operation of a domain name registry (a central database for .my domain names).

== Second-level global relaunch ==
On 20 June 2024 the .my TLD will relaunch and will be available for any natural or legal person worldwide, dropping the Malaysian presence requirement. MYNIC partnered with Tucows Registry Services for technical operation of the TLD and Internet Naming Co. for marketing the TLD and its relaunch. For this relaunch the domain lifecycle and registration agreement was updated to align more with generic TLDs. All SLDs will be unaffected by this and thus continue to have a local presence requirement.

==Responsibilities==
In addition, MYNIC holds the responsibility of developing top level domain policies, and carries out research projects such as:

* IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)
* DNSSEC (Domain Name Server Security Extensions)
* ENUM (Telephone Number Mapping)
* Anycast and IDN (Internationalised Domain Names)
* Promoting and training activities for the usage of the technologies above

<doc id="1234207" wikidata="Q284295" url="?curid=1234207" title="Kahina">
<text>Al-Kahina (), also known as Dihya, was a Berber warrior-queen of the Aurès (a kingdom in present-day northeast Algeria) and a religious and military leader who lived during the seventh century AD.

Her legacy has been retold through the oral tradition since her lifetime. There are various written accounts of her from precolonial and postcolonial perspectives. Generally, she is known to have united various Berber tribes under her leadership to fight against the ongoing Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, leading the indigenous North African defense of the region then known as Numidia. She fought in multiple battles, notably defeating Umayyad forces in the Battle of Meskiana. Afterwards, she became the uncontested ruler of the whole Maghreb region, and remained so until being decisively defeated and killed at the Battle of Tabarka.

There are various accounts of the circumstances surrounding her death, but she is thought to have died in modern-day Algeria towards the end of the seventh century. She is considered one of the most famous figures of her era in the history of the Berber resistance to the Arab conquest.

==Name==
Her personal name is one of these variations: Daya, Dehiya, Dihya, Dahya or Damya. Her title was cited by Arabic-language sources as &quot;al-Kāhina&quot; (the priestess soothsayer) (). This was the nickname given to by her Muslim opponents because of her alleged ability to foresee the future.

== Origins and religion ==
Al-Kahina led the Jarāwa Zenata tribe. She may have been Jewish. For five years she ruled a free Berber state from the Aurès Mountains to the oasis of Gadames (695–700 AD). But the Arabs, commanded by Musa bin Nusayr, returned with a strong army and defeated her. She fought at the El Djem Roman amphitheater but finally was killed in combat near a well that still bears her name, Bir al Kahina in Aures.

Various sources suggest that she was of Jewish religion or that her tribe were Judaized Berbers. According to al-Mālikī, she was accompanied in her travels by an &quot;idol&quot;. Both Mohamed Talbi and Gabriel Camps interpreted this idol as a Christian icon, either of Christ, the Virgin, or a saint protecting the queen. M&#x27;hamed Hassine Fantar held that this icon represented a separate Berber deity, suggesting she followed traditional Berber religion. However, Al-Kahina being a Christian remains the most likely hypothesis.

The idea that the Jarawa were Judaized comes from the medieval historian Ibn Khaldun, who named them among seven Berber tribes. Hirschberg and Talbi note that Ibn Khaldun seems to have been referring to a time before the advent of the late Roman and Byzantine empires, and a little later in the same paragraph seems to say that by Roman times &quot;the tribes&quot; had become Christianized. As early as 1963, the Israeli historian H.Z. Hirschberg, in retranslating the text of Ibn Khaldun and rigorously repeating the whole document, questioned this interpretation, and in general the existence of large Jewish Berber tribes in the end of Antiquity. In the words of H.Z. Hirschberg, &quot;of all the known movements of conversion to Judaism and incidents of Judaizing, those connected with the Berbers and Sudanese in Africa are the least authenticated. Whatever has been written on them is extremely questionable.&quot;

Over four centuries after her death, Tunisian hagiographer al-Mālikī seems to have been among the first to state she resided in the Aurès Mountains. Seven centuries after her death, the pilgrim at-Tijani was told she belonged to the Lūwāta tribe. When the later historian Ibn Khaldun came to write his account, he placed her with the Jarawa tribe.

According to various Muslim sources, al-Kāhina was the daughter of Tabat, or some say Mātiya. These sources depend on tribal genealogies, which were generally concocted for political reasons during the 9th century.

Ibn Khaldun records many legends about Al-Kahina. A number of them refer to her long hair or great size, both legendary characteristics of sorcerers. She is also supposed to have had the gift of prophecy and she had three sons, which is characteristic of witches in legends. Even the fact that two were her own and one was adopted (an Arab officer she had captured) was an alleged trait of sorcerers in tales. Another legend claims that in her youth, she had supposedly freed her people from a tyrant by agreeing to marry him and then murdering him on their wedding night. Virtually nothing else of her personal life is known.

== Conflicts and legends ==

Al-Kahina succeeded Kusaila as the war leader of the Berber tribes in the 680s and opposed the encroaching Arab Islamic armies of the Umayyad dynasty. Hasan ibn al-Nu&#x27;man marched from Egypt and captured the major Byzantine city of Carthage and other cities (see Muslim conquest of North Africa). Searching for another enemy to defeat, he was told that the most powerful monarch in North Africa was &quot;the Queen of the Berbers&quot; (Arabic: &quot;malikat al-barbar&quot;) Al-Kahina, and accordingly marched into Numidia. In 698, the armies met near Meskiana in the present-day province of Oum el-Bouaghi at the Battle of Meskiana (or &quot;battle of camels&quot;) in Algeria.

Al-Kahina defeated Hasan so soundly that he fled Ifriqiya and holed up in Cyrenaica (Libya) for four or five years. Realizing that the enemy was too powerful and bound to return, she was said to have embarked on a scorched earth campaign, which had little impact on the mountain and desert tribes, but lost her the crucial support of the sedentary oasis-dwellers. Instead of discouraging the Arab armies, her desperate decision hastened defeat.

The story of the Kahina is told by a variety of cultures, and each story often offers a different, or even contradictory, perspective. For example, the story is used to promote feminist beliefs. Additionally, it is even told by Arabs to promote their own nationalism. For the Arabs, they told the story in a perspective that made the Kahina seem like a sorcerer, all in an attempt to discredit her. The story of the Kahina was told to paint colonialism in a positive light. The story was told with a message saying that it represented the freeing of Berbers from the Arabs.

Another, lesser known account of Al-Kahina claimed that she had an interest in early studies of desert birds. While this view may or may not be plausible, some evidence has been recovered at the site of her death place, modern-day Algeria. Several fragments of early parchment with a painting of a bird on them were found, although there&#x27;s no way to conclude the fragments were hers. However, it is possible that she began her interest while in Libya, as the painting was of a Libyan bird species.

== Defeat and death ==

Hasan eventually returned and, aided by communications with the captured officer Khalid bin Yazid al-Qaysi adopted by Al-Kahina, defeated her at the Battle of Tabarka (a locality in present-day Tunisia near the Algerian border) about which there is some uncertainty. According to some accounts, Al-Kahina died fighting the invaders, sword in hand. Other accounts say she committed suicide by swallowing poison rather than be taken by the enemy. This final act occurred in the 690s or 700s, with 703 CE given as the most likely year. In that year, she was, according to Ibn Khaldun, 127 years old. This is evidently yet another of the many myths which surround her. In either case she was beheaded, and her head was sent back to the Umayyad Caliph in Damascus as proof of her death.

According to many historians, Bagay and Khenchla converted, and led the Berber army to Iberia. However, the historian Ibn al-Athīr says they died with their mother.

== Legacy ==
Al-Kahina was adopted as a symbol by North African women, and was used as a symbol against foreign occupation, and later as a symbol against male hegemony. Indeed, already during the period of French colonisation of Algeria, Kahina was a model for the militant women who fought the French. In the Kabyle insurrection of 1851 and 1857, women such as Lalla Fatma N&#x27;Soumer and Lalla Khadija Bent Belkacem, who were known as chief warriors took Kahina as a model.

Anthropologist Abdelmajid Hannoum wrote &quot;though the story of the Kahina may vary from one informant to another, the pattern is the same: the Kahina is the Berber heroine who fought the Arabs for independence.&quot; Feminist scholar Fatima Sadiqi has stated that &quot;Kahina’s female leadership did not rely on institutionalized authority, but on recognized personal charismatic power&quot;.

Also, the French, in the early 20th century, anxious to Frenchify Algeria by Romanising its past, drew parallels between themselves and the Romans. The Algerian nationalists, seeking to tie Algeria to the East instead, draw the same parallels, but for them both Rome and France were colonial powers, responsible for the decline of Phoenician civilisation in the past, and Arabic civilisation in the present. Both ideologies used Kahina&#x27;s mythology as a &quot;founding myth&quot;. On one side, she was the one who fought the Arabs and Islam to keep Algeria Christian, on the other, she was the one who fought all invaders (Byzantines or Arabs) to create an independent state.

In the present day, the image of Kahina is constantly used by Berber activists to showcase how they, as a people, are strong and will not be conquered or diminished by other communities. Her face is often seen in graffiti and sculptures around Algeria to showcase their support for the progressive ideals she represents. While her true appearance is still unknown, artists have depicted her with certain aspects that reinforce the progressive movement she is known to represent. However, not all governments accept the ideals behind Kahina. One statue of Kahina in Baghai was condemned by the government due to blasphemy. The president of the Defense of the Arab Language, Othman Saadi, said that Kahina represented the resistance to Islam, and thus, should be condemned.

<text>Srečko Kosovel () (18 March 1904 – 26 May 1926) was a Slovenian poet, now considered one of central Europe&#x27;s major modernist poets. He was labeled an impressionistic poet of his native Karst region, a political poet resisting forced Italianization of the Slovene areas annexed by Italy, an expressionist, a dadaist, a satirist, and as a voice of international socialism, using avant-garde constructivist forms. He is now considered a Slovenian poetic icon.

Most of Kosovel&#x27;s works were published almost four decades after his early death at 22. In his homeland, Kosovel entered the 20th-century Slovene literary canon as a poet who produced an impressive body of work of more than 1000 drafts, among them 500 complete poems, with a quality regarded as unusually high for his age.

==Life==

Srečko Kosovel was born as the youngest of five children to father Anton Kosovel, a Slovene teacher, who was not allowed to continue teaching in the Slovene language after the Austrian Littoral was annexed by Italy with the Treaty of Rapallo, 1920, and mother Katarina (née Streš) who was 40 years old at the time of his birth and nurtured the artistic talents of their children. Kosovel&#x27;s sister played the piano and one of his brothers was an aspiring writer. Born in Sežana, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Kosovel lived in the nearby village of Tomaj until 1924.

Before the annexation of his native Karst region by Italy, he familiarized himself with works of Slovene culture in general, especially Slovene literature, as well as drama at the Slovene theatre in Trieste, housed in the Trieste National Hall, the cultural center of Slovenes in Trieste.

Kosovel has been compared to Rimbaud, sharing the young age at which they were exposed to human suffering during war. The Battles of the Isonzo—one of the worst engagements of the First World War, began when Kosovel was 12 and officially ended when he was 17—were near Kosovel&#x27;s native village, and Rimbaud&#x27;s native village was near the battles of the Franco-Prussian War. Kosovel had regular contacts with wounded soldiers and saw corpses because the battlefield was only some 15 kilometers from his home, which had a traumatizing effect on him. His parents wanted him to be removed from the vicinity of the war, and so in 1916 both he and his sister moved to Ljubljana, where he stayed until his early death.

With the Treaty of Rapallo and Italian annexation of Slovene territories, including his native Karst region, Kosovel felt robbed of his beloved landscape because this and all Slovene schools and organizations were forbidden by the Fascist regime. Slovene intellectuals were subjected to reprisals, and this has been called one of the tragedies of his short life, evoking in him grief, anger, displacement, and disorientation. This was especially because his new homeland, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, also showed no interest in the suffering of the Slovene minority under the Fascist regime in Italy. Even in his negotiations with Italy in 1923, when Benito Mussolini wanted to modify the Rapallo borders in order for Italy to annex the still-independent state of Rijeka, King Alexander preferred &quot;good relations&quot; with Italy over the proposals for border corrections at Postojna and Idrija proposed by SHS Prime Minister Nikola Pašić. This led to Kosovel&#x27;s political and artistic radicalization. He had contacts with the radical political and insurgent anti-Fascist organization TIGR. In 1926, he visited the Yugoslav town of Zagorje to perform one of his recitals, and while waiting for the train to return to Ljubljana caught a cold, which eventually developed into meningitis. He returned to his home village of Tomaj, where he died on 26 May 1926.

==Work==
His early works were mainly about his feelings of longing for his family and native Karst landscape. Kosovel met his peers, Slovenes that have left Italy-annexed ethnic Slovene areas, at the University of Ljubljana and they established literary magazine called &quot;Lepa Vida&quot; (&quot;The Fair Vida&quot;, a motive from Slovene folk poetry), where Kosovel served as the magazine&#x27;s editor. Kosovel became acquainted with more radical ideas at the &quot;Ivan Cankar Club&quot;, named after the Slovenian radical author, and increasingly became attracted by the revolutionary ideas and the avant-garde Soviet and German works that Ivo Grahor introduced him to.

===The constructivist turn===
In 1925, together with a constructivist artist Avgust Černigoj, Kosovel was considering establishing a new magazine &quot;Konstruktor&quot; (&quot;Constructor&quot;) and started writing his constructivist poems, called &quot;konsi&quot; (&quot;kons&quot; in singular), short for &quot;konstrukcije&quot; (&quot;constructions&quot;). With the constructivism he turned away from a silent lyric to a loud, presumptuous, offensive poetry full of linguistic innovations: language free of syntax and logical ordering, freedom of imagery, use of typography, styles and colors, mathematical symbols, equations, paper collages, and all other sorts of experimental writing.

At about the same time, Kosovel prepared to publish a collection of his early poems, entitled &quot;Zlati čoln&quot; (&quot;Golden Boat&quot;). With this selection of poems, he intended to put an end to his early style, strongly influenced by the impressionist poetry of Josip Murn. He was however crushed by the negative response of both publishing houses and some of his closest friends.

Kosovel then turned exclusively to his constructivist poetry, which he wanted to publish in a collection entitled &quot;Konsi&quot;. He however never managed to achieve this; his constructivist poetry would remain unknown to the public until as late as 1967, when Anton Ocvirk decided to release Kosovel&#x27;s collection under the title &quot;Integrali &#x27;26&quot;.

The same year, in 1925, Kosovel became editor of the magazine &quot;Mladina&quot; (Youth). This had an enormous impact on his life: he had very ambitious plans with the journal, intending to transform it into a nationwide left-wing publication that would attract all modernist and avant-gardiste artists from Slovene Lands and Yugoslavia, as well as serving as the platform for a radical Slovenian political agenda. He remained the programme editor of the paper until his death.

===Late works===
The year 1925 was Kosovel&#x27;s most productive period. It was also a time that saw him shift his politics to the left. As his prose became simpler in style, it had a greater appeal to the proletariat. Kosovel conceived the idea of a proletarians&#x27; writers union and a publishing house called &quot;Strelci&quot; (&quot;Archers&quot;), in which his collection of constructivist poetry could also be published.

==Reception==
The poetry of Kosovel is seen to come from three artistic movements: Impressionism, Expressionism and Constructivism. Kosovel&#x27;s poetry also incorporates elements with Dadaism, Surrealism and Futurism. His style is too complex to be identified by a particular movement or current. His works show his concern with social and political oppression in the Slovene Lands, the fate of Slovenes threatened by foreign powers, the feeling of a decadence of Europe and the hope for a &quot;new dawn&quot;. The Karst region, with its ascetic and rigid scenery, is one of the main motifs in Kosovel&#x27;s poetry. His verses are full of wit, irony, depth and a sentiment of tragedy.

He has been often compared to other brilliant and tragic European authors from his same generation, such as the Hungarian Attila József, Italian Cesare Pavese, or Spanish Federico García Lorca.

Slovene composer Breda Šček set Kosovel’s texts to music.

===Posthumous publications===
In 1927, Alfonz Gspan published his late friend&#x27;s early poems in a booklet consisting of 66 works. In 1946, Anton Ocvirk published Kosovel&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot;, which were received by interest from the literary community. Ocvirk further published &quot;The Golden Boat&quot; in 1954. These publications however omitted Kosovel&#x27;s late works. Only in 1967, a book called &quot;Integrals &#x27;26&quot; was published, edited by Ocvirk. The third volume of &quot;Collected Works&quot; was published in 1977.

Kosovel also left unfinished works in lyrical prose form, sketches, note, diaries and essays and criticisms concerning cultural problems. Much of it was published in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of Kosovel&#x27;s birth, in the monograph entitled &quot;Ikarjev sen&quot; (&quot;Icarus&#x27;es Dream&quot;), edited by the literary critics Aleš Berger and Ludwig Hartinger.

A new selection of Kosovel&#x27;s poetry has been translated into English by Bert Pribac, David Brooks, assisted by Teja Brooks Pribac: &quot;The Golden Boat: Selected Poems of Srečko Kosovel&quot; (Salt 2008). Many further works by Srečko Kosovel have been translated into English by Lesley Zore: &quot;Best of Srečko Kosovel&#x27;s Work, Translated by Lesley Zore&quot; (self-published, 2020-2021).

<doc id="1234219" wikidata="Q846262" url="?curid=1234219" title="Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is a committee of the Bank of England, which meets for three and a half days, eight times a year, to decide the official interest rate in the United Kingdom (the Bank of England Base Rate).

It is also responsible for directing other aspects of the government&#x27;s monetary policy framework, such as quantitative easing and forward guidance. The Committee comprises nine members, including the Governor of the Bank of England, and is responsible primarily for keeping the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation close to a target set by the government, currently 2% per year (as of 2019). Its secondary aim – to support growth and employment – was reinforced in March 2013.

Announced on 6 May 1997, only five days after that year&#x27;s General Election, and officially given operational responsibility for setting interest rates in the Bank of England Act 1998, the committee was designed to be independent of political interference and thus to add credibility to interest rate decisions. Each member has one vote, for which they are held to account: full minutes of each meeting are published alongside the committee&#x27;s monetary policy decisions, and members are regularly called before the Treasury Select Committee, as well as speaking to wider audiences at events during the year.

== Purpose ==

The committee is responsible for formulating the United Kingdom&#x27;s monetary policy, most commonly via the setting of the rate at it which it lends to banks (officially the Bank of England Base Rate or BOEBR for short). As laid out in law, decisions are made with a primary aim of price stability, defined by the government&#x27;s inflation target (2% per year on the Consumer Price Index as of 2016). The target takes the form of a &quot;point&quot;, rather than the &quot;band&quot; used by the Treasury prior to 1997. The secondary aim of the committee is to support the government&#x27;s economic policies, and help it meet its targets for growth and employment. That secondary aim was reinforced by then Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in his March 2013 budget, with the MPC given more discretion to more openly &quot;trade off&quot; above-rate inflation in the medium run to boost other economic indicators. The MPC is not responsible for fiscal policy, which is handled by the Treasury itself, but is briefed by the Treasury about fiscal policy developments at meetings.

Under the Bank of England Act 1998 (c. 11) the Bank&#x27;s Governor must write an open letter of explanation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer if inflation exceeds the target by more than one percentage point in either direction, and once every three months thereafter until prices are back within the allowed range. It should also set out what plans the Bank has for rectifying the problem, and how long it is expected to remain at those levels in the meantime.

In January 2009 the Chancellor announced an Asset Purchase Facility (APF), to be administered by the MPC, aimed at ensuring greater liquidity in financial markets. The committee had already started to cut rates the previous autumn, but the effect of such changes can take up to two years and rates cannot go below zero. By March 2009, faced with very low levels on inflation and interest rates already at 0.5%, the MPC voted to start the process of quantitative easing (QE) – the injection of money directly into the economy – via the APF. It had the Bank buy government bonds (gilts), along with a smaller amount of high-quality debt issued by private companies. Although non-gilts initially made up a non-negligible part of the APF portfolio, as of May 2015 the entirety of the APF was held as gilts. On 7 August 2013, Governor Mark Carney issued the committee&#x27;s first forward guidance as a third tool for controlling future inflation.

Criticism of the MPC has centred on its predominant focus on inflation to the detriment of growth and employment, although that criticism may have been mitigated by the March 2013 revisions to the committee&#x27;s remit. There have also been complaints about the reluctance of lenders to pass on rate changes, and about the extent to which the introduction and management of QE have risked politicising the committee.

== History ==
Traditionally, the Treasury set interest rates. After reforms in 1992, officials held regular meetings and published minutes, but were not independent of government. The result was a feeling that political factors were clouding what should be purely economic judgements on monetary policy.
On 6 May 1997, operational responsibility to set interest rates was granted to the independent Bank of England by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown. Guidelines for the creation of a new &quot;Monetary Policy Committee&quot; were laid out in the Bank of England Act 1998. The Act also set out the responsibilities of the MPC: it would meet monthly; its membership comprise the Governor, two Deputy Governors, two of the Bank&#x27;s Executive Directors and four members appointed by the Chancellor. It should publish minutes of all meetings within six weeks (in October 1998 the committee announced plans to publish far more quickly, after only one). The Act gave the government responsibility for specifying its price stability target and growth and employment objectives at least annually. The original inflation target the government set for the MPC was 2.5% per year on the RPI-X measure of inflation, but in 2003 this was changed to 2% on CPI. The government reserved the right to instruct the Bank on what rate to set in times of emergency.

The years 1998 to 2006 witnessed an unprecedented period of price stability – during which inflation stayed within a percentage point of the target – despite earlier predictions that it could sit outside the range forty or more per cent of the time. A 2007 report produced for the Treasury Committee noted that the MPC&#x27;s independence of government &quot;has reduced the scope for short-term political considerations to enter into the determination of interest rates&quot;. The creation of the MPC, it said, brought with it &quot;an immediate credibility gain&quot;. During this time, the MPC kept interest rates relatively stable between 3.5% and 7.5%.

However, the financial crisis of 2007–08 ended this period of stability, and, on 16 April 2007, the governor (at that time Mervyn King), was obliged to write the first MPC open letter to the chancellor (Gordon Brown), explaining why the inflation had deviated from the target of 2% per year by more than one percentage point (3.1%). By February 2013, he had had to write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the base rate was cut six times to an all-time low of 0.5% in order to avoid deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme of quantitative easing, initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for quantitative easing to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds of quantitative easing in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the base rate at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate forward guidance, which it did on 7 August.

These measures eventually proved insufficient to avoid deflation. Having taken over in August 2013, Governor Mark Carney wrote his first open letter in February 2015 to explain why inflation had fallen below 1% for the first time in the MPC&#x27;s history. This was followed by deflation of 0.1% in April 2015, the first month of negative CPI growth since the 1960s, and triggering a second letter. As of February 2015, Carney has written five such letters. Following the UK&#x27;s vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, the MPC cut the base rate from 0.5% to 0.25%, the first change since March 2009. At the same time, it announced a further round of quantitative easing, valued at £60 billion, bringing the total to £435 billion.

In December 2014, the Bank adopted the recommendations of a report prepared by Kevin Warsh aimed at improving the transparency of the committee&#x27;s decision making processes.

== Composition ==
Following a reshuffle in April 2014, the committee currently comprises:
* The Governor of the Bank
* The three Deputy Governors for Monetary Policy, Financial Stability and Markets and Banking
* The Bank&#x27;s Chief Economist
* Four external members, appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for a renewable three-year term

Each member has one vote of equal weight, for which they can be held publicly accountable. The Governor chairs the meeting and is the last to cast a vote, acting as a casting vote in event of a tie. Representatives from the Treasury may attend the meeting, but only as non-voting observers.

==Meetings==
The MPC meets eight times a year, including four joint meetings with the Financial Policy Committee. After a half-day &quot;pre-MPC meeting&quot;, usually the Wednesday before, meetings are held over three days, typically a Thursday, Monday and Wednesday. Prior to the implementation of the reforms recommended by Kevin Warsh, meetings were generally held monthly on the Wednesday and Thursday following the first Monday of the month, although this was sometimes deviated from. In 2010, for example, the meeting was postponed from the 5/6 to the 7/10 May in order to avoid conflicting with the general election scheduled for the 6th. The May 2015 meeting was similarly delayed.

On the first day of the three, the Committee studies data relating to the UK economy, as well as the worldwide economy, presented by the Bank&#x27;s economists and regional representatives, and topics for discussion are identified and addressed. The second day consists of a main policy discussion during which MPC members explain their personal views and debate the correct course of action. The Governor chooses the policy most likely to command a majority and, on the third day of the meeting, a vote is taken; each member gets one vote. Those in the minority are asked to give the action they would have preferred. The committee&#x27;s decisions are announced at noon the day after the meeting has concluded. Following a procedural change in 2015, minutes of each meeting (including the policy preference of each member) are published on the Bank&#x27;s website at the same time as any decision is announced, resulting in a &quot;Super Thursday&quot; effect. Prior to August 2015, the committee&#x27;s decisions were published at noon on the final day of the meeting, but there was a two-week delay before any minutes were published. Starting with the March 2015 meeting, full transcripts of meetings will also be published, albeit after an eight-year delay.

Outside of meetings, members of the MPC can be called upon by Parliament to answer questions regarding their decisions, via parliamentary committee meetings, often those of the Treasury Committee. MPC members also speak to audiences throughout the country, with the same aim. Their views and expectations for inflation are also republished in the Bank&#x27;s quarterly inflation report.

<text>Telangana Praja Samithi or Telangana Peoples Convention was an Indian political party which fought for statehood for the Telangana region.

==History==
TPS was founded in 1969. The founding president of the party was Ananthula Madan Mohan, but later taken over by Marri Chenna Reddy who spearheaded the Telangana agitation and eventually winning over 10 Lok Sabha seats in the 1971 elections. Telangana Praja Samithi&#x27;s support was not crucial as Indira Gandhi got complete superiority in that election. Chenna Reddy dissolved the Telangana Praja Samiti a few days after the resignation of Kasu Brahmananda Reddy on September 24, 1971. Later the members merged into the Congress party.

The party was revived again in 1983 with Vande Mataram Ramchander Rao, as the President, Pratap Kishore was the General Secretary. After the death of Vandemataram Ram Chander Rao, Gandhian Bhoopati Krishnamurthi (Telangana Gandhi) was elected president and led the party for nearly two decades up to his death in January 2015. After Bhoopati Krishnamoorthi Neera Kishore, was elected as President of Telangana Praja Samithi.

==Movement==
TPS organized a series of strikes and demonstrations throughout the Telangana region to push their demand for a separate state. In June 1969 general strikes in Hyderabad organized by the TPS led to widespread violence as TPS supporters clashed with supporters of a unified Andhra state and with police.

==Elections==
In the 1971 Lok Sabha elections, TPS won 10 out of 11 seats in Telangana. However, in September 1971 TPS merged with Congress, and the Telangana agitations temporarily disappeared and P V Narsimha Rao was made the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.

<doc id="1234228" wikidata="Q33678" url="?curid=1234228" title="Mandinka language">
<text>The Mandinka language (; Ajami: ), or Mandingo, is a Mande language spoken by the Mandinka people of northern Guinea-Bissau, the Casamance region of Senegal, and The Gambia where it is one of the principal languages.

Mandinka belongs to the Manding branch of Mande and is similar to Bambara and Maninka/Malinké but with only 5 instead of 7 vowels. 
The variety spoken in The Gambia and Senegal borders on a pitch accent due to its proximity with non-tonal neighboring languages like Wolof.

==Phonology==

Mandinka is here represented by the variety spoken in Casamance. There is little dialectical diversity.

===Tone===
Mandinka has two tones, high and low. Unmodified nouns are either high tone on all syllables or low tone on all syllables. The definite suffix &quot;-o&quot; takes a low tone on high-tone nouns and a falling tone on low-tone nouns. It also assimilates any preceding short vowel, resulting in a long /oo/ with either low or falling tone. It shortens a preceding long high vowel (&quot;ii&quot; &gt; &quot;io&quot;, &quot;uu&quot; &gt; &quot;uo&quot;; &quot;ee&quot; optionally &gt; either &quot;eo&quot; or &quot;ee&quot;) or assimilates itself (&quot;aa&quot; remains &quot;aa&quot;) leaving only its tone:
:/búŋ/ &#x27;a room&#x27; &gt; /búŋò/ &#x27;the room&#x27;
:/tèŋ/ &#x27;a palm tree&#x27; &gt; /tèŋô/ &#x27;the palm tree&#x27;
:/kídí/ &#x27;a gun&#x27; &gt; /kídòò/ &#x27;the gun&#x27;
:/kòrdàà/ &#x27;a house&#x27; &gt; /kòrdáà/ &#x27;the house&#x27;

In Senegal and Gambia, Mandinka is approaching a system of pitch accent under the influence of local non-tonal languages such as Wolof, Serer, and Jola.

The tonal system remains more robust in the Eastern and Southern Mandinka dialects (Tilibo) spoken in the Guinea-Bissau, Guinea and Eastern Senegal. These conservative dialects merge into other conservative Manding languages like Maninka, the once official language of the Mali Empire, Bambara, and Susu. All of these preserve the typical West African terraced downstep in tonality that is only lightly alluded to in the Western Mandinka dialects spoken in much of Gambia and Senegal.

===Vowels===
Vowel qualities are . All may be long or short. There are no nasal vowels; instead, there is a coda consonant /ŋ/. Long vowels are written double: &quot;aa&quot;, &quot;ee&quot;, &quot;ii&quot;, &quot;oo&quot;, &quot;uu&quot;.

===Consonants===
The following table gives the consonants in the Latin orthography, and their IPA equivalent when they differ.

Syllabic nasals occur, such as in &quot;nnààm&quot; &#x27;yes!&#x27; (response), &quot;ŋte&quot; &quot;I, me&quot;. Word-initial &quot;mb, nd, ndy, ng&quot; occur but are not particularly common; it is not clear whether they should be considered syllabic nasals or additional consonants.

Consonants may be geminated in the middles of words (at least /pp, tʃtʃ, dʒdʒ, kk, ll, mm, nn, ɲɲ/). The only other consonant found at the ends of syllables in native words is , which assimilates to the following consonant, e.g. /ŋs, ŋtʃ, ŋb/ → [ns, ɲtʃ, mb]. Syllable-final /r/ and /s/ are found in French loans (e.g. /kùrtù/ &#x27;pants&#x27;).

==Orthography==
The Latin alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are widely used for Mandinka; the former is official, but the latter is more widely used and older. In addition, the pan-Manding writing system, the N&#x27;Ko script, invented in 1949, is often used in Guinea-Bissau, north east Guinea, and in bordering communities in Ivory Coast and Mali. Additionally, the Garay alphabet, originally developed for Wolof, has seen some limited use.

In the Latin script, c represents , ŋ , and ñ ; the letters v, x, z, and q are not used. Vowels are as in Spanish or Italian and are doubled to indicate length or distinguish words that are otherwise homophones.

The Arabic script uses no extra letters (apart from, rarely, an extra vowel mark for &quot;e&quot;), but some of the letters are pronounced differently from in Arabic.

The Latin and Arabic consonants correspond as follows:

Letters in italics are not normally used in native Mandinka words. ه (h) may also be used to indicate a final glottal stop, which is not noted in the Latin script. The letter ŋ of the Latin script is often indicated with vowel signs in the Arabic script; see below.

The vowels correspond as follows (diacritics are placed over or under the consonant in Arabic):

In addition, a small Arabic 2 (۲) may be used to indicate reduplication, and the &quot;hamza&quot; may be used as in Arabic to indicate glottal stops more precisely.

* Faama: &quot;father,&quot; &quot;leader,&quot; or &quot;king&quot;
* Mansa (title): &quot;sultan&quot;, &quot;king&quot; or &quot;emperor&quot;

<doc id="1234230" wikidata="Q755656" url="?curid=1234230" title="Athlone Town A.F.C.">
<text>Athlone Town Association Football Club is an Irish football club from Athlone who are playing in the League of Ireland. The club is the oldest in the League as it was founded in 1887. First elected to the League of Ireland in 1922, they play their home matches in Lissywollen, their new stadium which opened in 2007. The club&#x27;s colours are blue and black. Away kits vary from year to year although orange and black has been worn most recently.

==History==
===1920s===
Athlone first competed in the League of Ireland in the 1922–23 season, finishing sixth. They were the first non-Dublin club in the Irish Free State to compete in the national Free State League. They competed in the league until 1928 and not again until the 1969–70 season.

Athlone Town won the FAI Cup, their first domestic success in 1924, beating Fordsons. Dinny Hannon scored the only goal of the game, as Athlone went through the whole competition without conceding a goal.

Hannon was one of five Athlone Town players chosen to represent the Irish Free State at the 1924 Paris Olympic Games. The other players were Tommy Muldoon, Frank Ghent, John Joe Dykes and Paddy O&#x27;Reilly.

===Domestic success and European competition===
The club finished second in the league in the 1974–75 season, earning a place in the UEFA Cup, the first time they had ever qualified for European competition. Their first-round game was against Norwegian side Vålerenga who they beat 3–1 at home before drawing 1–1 away. Athlone&#x27;s second round tie was against Italian side AC Milan, drawing 0–0 in the first leg at St. Mel&#x27;s Park, setting a record attendance of 9,000 before losing the second leg at the San Siro 3–0.

Athlone won their first league title in the 1980–81 season. They played KB in Europe the following season, earning a draw in the first leg in Denmark and again at St. Mel&#x27;s Park, going out on the away goal rule.

In the 1981–82 season Athlone Town won the League Cup for the second time, beating Shamrock Rovers. However, they failed to retain their league title that year finishing 4th. Athlone Town were again crowned league champions in the 1982–83 season and qualifying for Europe, and also retained the League Cup, beating Dundalk. Their opponents in Europe on this occasion were Belgian outfit Raymond Goethals managed Standard Liège, losing 3–2 at home and 8–2 in Liège.

In 1985 six new clubs were elected to the league, increasing the league&#x27;s participation to 22. As a result, the current two division (Premier and First) structure was adapted with Athlone Town in Premier Division. In 1987 the club finished last and were relegated to the First Division. Their stay there was short, finishing top of First Division the following season, gaining promotion to the Premier Division. The club remained in the top flight until the 1991–92 season, when they finished eleventh and were subsequently relegated to the First Division.

Athlone Town again gained promotion to the Premier Division in the 1993–94 season, finishing runners-up to Sligo Rovers that season.

===Relegation===
The club were once again relegated in 1996, narrowly missing out on promotion in 2001 by one point to Monaghan United.

Since 2001 Athlone have finished each season in the bottom half of the first division. In that time eight different managers have been appointed. In 2007 the club moved from St Mel&#x27;s Park to a new stadium, which was opened on 9 March when the home side hosted Kilkenny City in the opening game of the season.

On 15 December 2008, the club held an emergency E.G.M. with supporters stating that they were in financial difficulties. Part finance had been raised and the club worked towards raising the rest. The club received funds through the patron scheme with over 350 fans contributing.

On 27 September 2013, Athlone clinched the First Division title with a 1–0 win over Waterford United.

In 2014, Athlone Town had a bad campaign in the Premier Division, finishing last in the championship, in the Leinster Senior Cup it was eliminated in the quarterfinals by St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic, in the FAI Cup it was eliminated in the second round by Longford Town, and in the League Cup lost to Longford Town again in the first round.

In September 2017 the FAI banned goalkeeper Igors Labuts and midfielder Dragos Sfrijan for 12 months after a UEFA investigation found &quot;clear and overwhelming betting evidence&quot; of fixing of Athlone&#x27;s 29 April match against Longford Town in the 2017 League of Ireland First Division. The Professional Footballers&#x27; Association of Ireland said the decision was based on &quot;half-baked innuendo&quot;.

In 2018, a dispute over ownership of Athlone Town Stadium arose.

In November 2020, Athlone Town lost 11–0 to Dundalk F.C. in the FAI Cup semi final, a new record for the biggest win from a team in the history of the competition

There are many youth teams, ranging from u13 boys&#x27; to u17 women&#x27;s team.

The club currently plays in the League of Ireland First Division.

<doc id="1234236" wikidata="Q1047279" url="?curid=1234236" title="Triolet">
<text>A triolet (, ) is almost always a stanza poem of eight lines, though stanzas with as few as seven lines and as many as nine or more have appeared in its history. Its rhyme scheme is ABaAabAB (capital letters represent lines repeated verbatim) and often in 19th century English triolets all lines are in iambic tetrameter, though in traditional French triolets, from the 17th century on, the second, sixth and eighth lines tend to be iambic trimeters followed by one amphibrachic foot each. In French terminology, a line ending in an iambic foot was denoted as masculine, while a line ending in an amphibrachic foot was called feminine. Depending on the language and era, other meters are seen, even in French. The first, fourth and seventh lines are identical, as are the second and final lines, thereby making the initial and final couplets identical as well. In a traditional French triolet, the second and third non-repeating lines rhyme with the repeating first, fourth, and seventh lines, while the non-repeating sixth line rhymes with the second and eighth repeating lines. However, especially in German triolets of the 18th and 19th centuries, one will see this pattern often violated.

==History==

The triolet is a close cousin of the rondeau, the rondel, and the rondelet, other French verse forms emphasizing repetition and rhyme. The form stems from medieval French poetry and seems to have had its origin in Picardy.

The earliest written examples are from the late 13th century. In this century, possibly the earliest surviving triolet is from &quot;Li Roumans dou Chastelain de Couci et de la Dame de Fayel&quot;, where it is referred to as simply a song (&quot;chanson&quot;). Seven more easily datable 13th century triolets (also known as songs) are to be found in &quot;Cléomadès&quot; by Adenet le Roi. In the early 14th century, the songwriter, Jean Lescurel, wrote many triolets under the term of rondel. Lescurel was followed by Guillaume Machaut and, at the end of the century, by Jean Froissart. In the early 15th century, Christine de Pisan experimented with a slightly abbreviated seven-line variation of the triolet which she, like her predecessors, also termed a rondel. Toward the end of this century, Dutch language triolets (though designated as rondels) by Anthonis de Roovere appear. Also, at the end of the 15th century, the term triolet appears for the first time. It was probably first so designated by Octavien de Saint-Gelais, whose colleague André de la Vigne appears to have designated his own triolets as rondelets. In the 16th century, variously designated French and Dutch triolets continue to appear, though they largely lose favor by the end of the century. In the 17th century from 1648 to 1652, triolets designated as triolets became suddenly popular in France during the civil uprisings of the &quot;Fronde&quot; when triolets were used for propaganda purposes and for character assassination. However, what remains easily accessible from this period are, basically, two poems, one by Marc-Antoine Girard, Sieur de Saint-Amant and another by Jacques de Ranchin. Saint-Amant&#x27;s poem is a triolet about writing a triolet and Ranchin&#x27;s, also known as the &quot;king of triolets&quot;, is about falling in love on the first of May. Though the triolet did not recover its former popularity in 18th century France, it did, with the appearance of Théodore de Banville in the mid-19th century, experience a revival of interest with triolets being written by Arthur Rimbaud, Maurice Rollinat, Alphonse Daudet, and Stéphane Mallarmé.

The earliest known triolets composed in English were written in 1651 by Patrick Cary, briefly a Benedictine at Douai, who purportedly used them in his devotions. None of Cary&#x27;s poetry was published until the late 18th century and his triolets did not achieve notice until Sir Walter Scott published them in 1820. Probably, the two earliest publications of a triolet in English were both translations of Ranchin&#x27;s &quot;king of triolets&quot;, with one being published in 1728 and the other in 1806. In 1835 a rondel of Froissart was translated into English as a triolet. In 1870 Robert Bridges became the first English poet to write original triolets in English that were published and achieved recognition in England. This, though, was less through his own efforts than through the impact of an influential article written by Edmund Gosse and printed in 1877 in the Cornhill Magazine reintroducing the triolet to the English public at large, among whom it enjoyed a brief popularity among late-nineteenth-century British poets.

Not only did the triolet come to enjoy popularity in the late 19th century among English writers, but in the 18th and 19th centuries, it also came to enjoy a certain popularity among writers of other European languages. Among the various languages in which the triolet appeared, German writers of triolets, in particular, were not only numerous, but, by and large, made a point of developing it in new directions not seen with English and French writers. In addition to German, the triolet also appeared in Dutch, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and possibly other languages during these two centuries. Moreover, in Brazil in the late 19th century, the triolet spawned a new, somewhat abbreviated, six-line verse form known as the biolet.

Though possessing a long history, triolets, with the exception of France in the years from 1648 to 1652, have always been a relatively rare verse form. Nevertheless, the number of languages in which triolets have been written and the number of poets who have written triolets has steadily increased and it seems to be exhibiting a new vitality with the advent of the 21st century.

==Examples==
The following five triolets were written in 1651, 1806, 1870, 1877 and 1888, respectively, the first four being written by Englishmen and the last by an American.



Robert Fellows&#x27; piece &quot;The first of May&quot; derives its title from an English translation of the first line of an older triolet written by the French poet Ranchin in c. 1690. In reference to Ranchin&#x27;s original French triolet, English poet and literary critic Edmund Gosse claimed that &quot;No more typical specimen of the [early French] triolet could be found&quot;:

==The modern English triolet==
The following is an example of a modern English triolet.

In the last line the punctuation is altered; this is common although not strictly in keeping with the original form. Furthermore, the fact that the &quot;berries now are gone&quot; has a new relevance, the birds are going unfed, creates a new significance from the line repetition.

<text>In U.S. politics (as well as in some other countries utilizing the presidential system), the majority floor leader is a partisan position in a legislative body.

==United States==

In the federal Congress of the United States, the roles of the House majority leader and the Senate majority leader differ slightly. At the state level, the majority leader of a given state legislative chamber usually performs a similar role to that of their federal counterpart.

===Senate===

In the Senate, the vice president of the United States is officially the president of the Senate and the president pro tempore serves as the president of the Senate in the absence of the vice president. However, in reality, the vice president seldom enters the Senate, let alone directly presides over the chamber, unless a tied vote is expected, and the president pro tempore has become a ceremonial role deprived of any leadership ability.

Thus, the majority leader is seen as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Senate, especially in modern times, and thus, in accordance with Senate rules, the presiding officer of the day gives the majority leader priority in obtaining recognition to speak on the floor of the Senate and they determine which bills get voted on. The majority leader is seen as the chief spokesperson for their party in the Senate.

In the United States Senate, the current majority leader is John Thune (R-SD), who was sworn in on January 3rd, 2025.

===House of Representatives===

In the House of Representatives the majority leader&#x27;s presence and power often depends on the session. In some sessions, the majority leader takes precedence over the speaker as House leader and legislative party leader either by force (which usually occurs when the speaker of the House is unpopular) or because the speaker of the House voluntarily surrenders power to the majority leader. In most sessions, the speaker of the House takes precedence as house leader and party leader, with the majority leader being irrelevant and largely powerless outside the fact they might be speaker of the House one day. Except, of course, for the fact that the majority leader (as well as the speaker and the minority leader) are the only members of the House that can speak on the floor for an unlimited amount of time and cannot be interrupted by the chair.

In the United States House of Representatives, the current majority leader is Steve Scalise from Louisiana&#x27;s 1st District.

<doc id="1234241" wikidata="Q1758189" url="?curid=1234241" title="Slane Castle">
<text>Slane Castle () is located in the village of Slane, within the Boyne Valley of County Meath, Ireland. The castle has been the family seat of the Conyngham family since it was built in the late 18th century, on land first purchased in 1703 by Brig.-Gen. Henry Conyngham.

It holds the Slane Festival within its grounds, with the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; claiming in 2004 that &quot;Slane today is the kind of internationally recognised venue that can claim even Madonna&#x27;s attention&quot;. Its sloping lawns form a natural amphitheatre.

==History ==
On the eastward side of the castle demesne, directly between the River Boyne and the village&#x27;s Church of Ireland church in Slane, lay the ruins of St. Erc&#x27;s Hermitage, a 15th-century multi-storey chapel, and with some 500 metres westward of St. Erc&#x27;s Hermitage an ancient well can also be found. In one of the central texts of Irish mythology, the &quot;&quot;, this well is said to have been blessed by the God so that the could bathe in it and be healed, allegedly healing all mortal wounds except decapitation. However, with the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, and the policy of Christian reinterpretation for traditionally pagan sites, the well is now more commonly referred to as &quot;Our Lady&#x27;s Well.&quot;

Prior to the 1688 overthrow of the House of Stuart, Slane Castle had been in the possession of the Flemings, Hiberno-Normans who had aligned themselves with the Jacobites in the War of the Grand Alliance, and thus after the Williamite victory, their property was chosen for confiscation. Christopher, 17th Baron Slane (1669 – 14 July 1726; created The 1st Viscount Longford by Queen Anne in 1713), was the last Fleming Lord of Slane. 

Overlooking the River Boyne, just a few kilometres upstream from Newgrange and the site of the famous Battle of the Boyne, Slane Castle in its existing form was constructed under the direction of William Burton Conyngham, together with his nephew The 1st Marquess Conyngham. The reconstruction dates back to 1785 and is principally the work of James Gandon, James Wyatt and Francis Johnston. Francis Johnston was also the architect responsible for the gothic gates on the Mill Hill, located to the east of the castle.

The Conynghams are originally a Scottish Protestant family, who planted in Ireland in 1611, during the Plantation of Ulster in County Donegal. With that, the family asserted control over lands around the village of &quot;&quot;, near Donegal Town in the south of County Donegal. Concurrently, the then head of the family, Charles Conyngham, renamed the village in his own honour as Mountcharles (pronounced locally in South Donegal as &#x27;Mount-char-liss&#x27;). The family also controlled an extensive estate in West Donegal, especially in The Rosses district.

The association between the Ulster-Scots Conynghams and the Slane Estate in County Meath dates back over 300 years, ever since the property was taken by the family following the Williamite Confiscations in 1701. Around that time, the family moved their main ancestral seat south from County Donegal in west Ulster to Slane.

The present owner of the castle is Henry Conyngham, the 8th Marquess Conyngham - the eldest son of Lord Conyngham is Alex, Earl of Mount Charles.

In 1984, Irish band U2 took up residence at the castle to write and record their album &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;.

In 1991, a fire in the castle caused extensive damage to the building and completely gutted the eastern section facing the River Boyne. The castle reopened in 2001 after the completion of a ten-year restoration programme. In 2003, a cannon associated with the castle was found in the nearby River Boyne.

==Concerts at Slane==

Since 1981, the grounds of Slane Castle have been used to host rock concerts. The natural amphitheatre has an 80,000 person capacity. The concerts were launched by the then Earl of Mount Charles (popularly known for several decades as Henry Mount Charles or Henry Mountcharles; since March 2009, he has been known as The 8th Marquess Conyngham), the owner of the castle.

Performers who have headlined Slane concerts since 1981 include The Rolling Stones, U2, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Queen, David Bowie, Neil Young, Bryan Adams, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Robbie Williams, Madonna, R.E.M., Foo Fighters, Celtic Woman and Oasis. On 28 May 2011, Kings Of Leon headlined the 30th anniversary event at Slane Castle.
Harry Styles performed on the 10th of June 2023.

Celtic Woman filmed their second DVD at Slane Castle, called &quot;Celtic Woman: A New Journey&quot; in August 2006, and in 2001 U2 filmed the DVD &quot;U2 Go Home: Live From Slane Castle&quot;, which was released in 2003. They also recorded their 1984 album, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, there while taking up residence for a time. Parts of Madonna&#x27;s documentary-film &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Tell You a Secret&quot; were filmed at Slane Castle in 2004. Bon Jovi performed at Slane Castle in June 2013.

<text>Max Abraham (; 26 March 1875 – 16 November 1922) was a German physicist known for his work on electromagnetism and his opposition to the theory of relativity.

==Biography==

Abraham was born in Danzig, Imperial Germany (now Gdańsk in Poland) to a family of Jewish merchants. His father was Moritz Abraham and his mother was Selma Moritzsohn. Attending the University of Berlin, he studied under Max Planck. He graduated in 1897. For the next three years, Abraham worked as Planck&#x27;s assistant.

From 1900 to 1909, Abraham worked at Göttingen as a privatdozent, an unpaid lecturing position. Abraham developed his theory of the electron in 1902, in which he hypothesized that the electron was a perfect sphere with a charge divided evenly around its surface. Abraham&#x27;s model was competing with that developed by Hendrik Lorentz (1899, 1904) and Albert Einstein (1905) which seem to have become more widely accepted; nevertheless, Abraham never gave up his model, since he considered it was based on &quot;common sense&quot;. Abraham was a staunch opponent of the theory of relativity.

In 1909 Abraham travelled to the United States to accept a position at the University of Illinois, but ended up returning to Göttingen after a few months. He was later invited to Italy by Tullio Levi-Civita, and found work as the professor of rational mechanics at the Politecnico di Milano university until 1914.

When World War I started, Abraham was forced to return to Germany. During this time he worked on the theory of radio transmission. After the war, he still was not allowed back into Milan, so until 1921 he worked at Stuttgart as the professor of physics at Technische Hochschule.

After his work at Stuttgart, Abraham accepted the position of chair in Aachen; however, before he started his work there he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He died on 16 November 1922 in Munich, Germany.

After his death, Max Born and Max von Laue wrote about him in an obituary: &quot;He loved his absolute aether, his field equations, his rigid electron just as a youth loves his first flame, whose memory no later experience can extinguish.&quot;

<doc id="1234251" wikidata="Q589250" url="?curid=1234251" title="PCF theory">
<text>PCF theory is the name of a mathematical theory, introduced by Saharon , that deals with the cofinality of the ultraproducts of ordered sets. It gives strong upper bounds on the cardinalities of power sets of singular cardinals, and has many more applications as well. The abbreviation &quot;PCF&quot; stands for &quot;possible cofinalities&quot;.

== Main definitions ==
If &quot;A&quot; is an infinite set of regular cardinals, &quot;D&quot; is an ultrafilter on &quot;A&quot;, then
we let formula_1 denote the cofinality of the ordered set of functions
formula_2 where the ordering is defined as follows:
formula_3 if formula_4.
pcf(&quot;A&quot;) is the set of cofinalities that occur if we consider all ultrafilters on &quot;A&quot;, that is,
formula_5

== Main results ==
Obviously, pcf(&quot;A&quot;) consists of regular cardinals. Considering ultrafilters concentrated on elements of &quot;A&quot;, we get that
formula_6. Shelah proved, that if formula_7, then pcf(&quot;A&quot;) has a largest element, and there are subsets formula_8 of &quot;A&quot; such that for each ultrafilter &quot;D&quot; on &quot;A&quot;, formula_1 is the least element θ of pcf(&quot;A&quot;) such that formula_10. Consequently, formula_11.
Shelah also proved that if &quot;A&quot; is an interval of regular cardinals (i.e., &quot;A&quot; is the set of all regular cardinals between two cardinals), then pcf(&quot;A&quot;) is also an interval of regular cardinals and |pcf(&quot;A&quot;)|&lt;|&quot;A&quot;|+4.
This implies the famous inequality
formula_12
assuming that ℵω is strong limit.

If λ is an infinite cardinal, then &quot;J&quot;&lt;λ is the following ideal on &quot;A&quot;. &quot;B&quot;∈&quot;J&quot;&lt;λ if formula_13 holds for every ultrafilter &quot;D&quot; with &quot;B&quot;∈&quot;D&quot;. Then &quot;J&quot;&lt;λ is the ideal generated by the sets formula_14. There exist &quot;scales&quot;, i.e., for every λ∈pcf(&quot;A&quot;) there is a sequence of length λ of elements of formula_15 which is both increasing and cofinal mod &quot;J&quot;&lt;λ. This implies that the cofinality of formula_2 under pointwise dominance is max(pcf(&quot;A&quot;)).
Another consequence is that if λ is singular and no regular cardinal less than λ is Jónsson, then also λ+ is not Jónsson. In particular, there is a Jónsson algebra on ℵω+1, which settles an old conjecture.

== Unsolved problems ==
The most notorious conjecture in pcf theory states that |pcf(&quot;A&quot;)|=|&quot;A&quot;| holds for every set &quot;A&quot; of regular cardinals with |&quot;A&quot;|&lt;min(&quot;A&quot;). This would imply that if ℵω is strong limit, then the sharp bound
formula_17
holds. The analogous bound
formula_18
follows from Chang&#x27;s conjecture (Magidor) or even from the nonexistence of a Kurepa tree (Shelah).

A weaker, still unsolved conjecture states that if |&quot;A&quot;|&lt;min(&quot;A&quot;), then pcf(&quot;A&quot;) has no inaccessible limit point. This is equivalent to the statement that pcf(pcf(&quot;A&quot;))=pcf(&quot;A&quot;).

== Applications ==

The theory has found a great deal of applications, besides cardinal arithmetic.
The original survey by Shelah, &quot;Cardinal arithmetic for skeptics&quot;, includes the following topics: almost free abelian groups, partition problems, failure of preservation of chain conditions in Boolean algebras under products, existence of Jónsson algebras, existence of entangled linear orders, equivalently narrow Boolean algebras, and the existence of nonisomorphic models equivalent in certain infinitary logics.

In the meantime, many further applications have been found in Set Theory, Model Theory, Algebra and Topology.

<text>Albert L. Murray (May 12, 1916 – August 18, 2013) was an American literary and music critic, novelist, essayist, and biographer. His books include &quot;The Omni-Americans&quot;, &quot;South to a Very Old Place&quot;, and &quot;Stomping the Blues&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Murray was born in Nokomis, Alabama. His biological mother, Sudie Graham, gave him up for adoption to Hugh and Mattie Murray. He grew up in the Magazine Point area of Mobile, Alabama.

He attended Tuskegee Institute on scholarship and received a B.S. in education in 1939. One of his fellow students was Ralph Ellison, who would later write the novel &quot;Invisible Man&quot; (1952), which established his reputation and gave him a lifetime income.

Murray briefly enrolled in a graduate program at the University of Michigan before returning to Tuskegee in 1940 to teach literature and composition. In 1941, he married Mozelle Menefee; they had a daughter, Michele. While based at Tuskegee, he completed additional graduate work at Northwestern University in 1941 and the University of Paris in 1951.

===Military service===
Murray joined the United States Army Air Forces in 1943 with the desire to &quot;live long enough for Thomas Mann to finish the last volume of &quot;Joseph and His Brothers&quot;.&quot; In 1946, he transferred to the United States Air Force Reserve and enrolled at New York University on the GI Bill, where he received an M.A. in English in 1948. During this period, he became acquainted with Duke Ellington and solidified his close friendship with Ralph Ellison.

After briefly returning to his position at Tuskegee, he opted to pursue a more financially remunerative career as a member of the Active Guard Reserve in 1951 to better support his young family. Over the next decade, Murray was stationed in a number of locales (ranging from Morocco to California to Massachusetts) and taught a geopolitics course in the Tuskegee ROTC program. In 1962, after a doctor&#x27;s exam revealed signs of heart disease, he retired from the United States Air Force as a major. He and his wife moved to the Lenox Terrace Apartments in Harlem, where they were based for the remainder of their lives.

===Literary career===
Thereafter, Murray began his literary career in earnest, regularly publishing in such periodicals as &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;The New Leader&quot;. The July 3, 1964 edition of &quot;Life&quot; included his article &quot;The Problem Is Not Just Black and White&quot;, which examined seven books on race relations.

Murray published his first book in 1970. &quot;The Omni-Americans&quot; contained a series of essays and reviews on such topics as protest literature and the Moynihan Report on black poverty. In the introduction, he wrote that &quot;the United States is in actuality not a nation of black people and white people. It is a nation of multi-colored people.&quot; According to author Walker Percy, &quot;The Omni-Americans&quot; &quot;may be the most important book on black-white relations in the United States, indeed on American culture, published in this generation.&quot;

He followed that up with a non-fiction book about the American South called &quot;South to a Very Old Place&quot; (1971). It had begun as a reporting assignment by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; editor Willie Morris. &quot;South to a Very Old Place&quot; was reviewed by Toni Morrison in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and was a finalist for the National Book Awards.

Starting with &quot;Train Whistle Guitar&quot; (1974), Murray wrote four novels that featured an alter ego named Scooter. The novels follow Scooter from childhood through college and into his career as a musician and writer.

Murray wrote about the importance of blues and jazz music in such books as &quot;The Hero and the Blues&quot; (1973) and &quot;Stomping the Blues&quot; (1976). He received the 1977 ASCAP Deems Taylor Award for &quot;Stomping the Blues&quot;. In addition, he collaborated with Count Basie on the latter&#x27;s memoir &quot;Good Morning Blues&quot; (1985).

He held visiting lectureships, fellowships, and professorships at several institutions, including the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism (1968), Colgate University (1970; 1973; 1982), the University of Massachusetts Boston (1971), the University of Missouri (1972), Emory University (1978), Drew University (1983), and Washington and Lee University (1993). From 1981 to 1983, he was an adjunct associate professor of writing at Barnard College. He received honorary doctorates from Colgate (Litt.D., 1975) and Spring Hill College (D.H.L., 1995).

As noted, he became close friends with Ralph Ellison after college. Their relationship informed the thinking and writing of both men. &quot;Trading Twelves: The Selected Letters of Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray&quot; was published in 2000. Murray was also a friend of artist Romare Bearden. Bearden&#x27;s six-panel collage &quot;The Block&quot; (1971) was inspired by the view from Murray&#x27;s Harlem apartment. Murray later appeared in the 1980 documentary &quot;Bearden Plays Bearden&quot;.

Murray received greater attention in the 1980s and 1990s due to his influence on critic Stanley Crouch and jazz musician Wynton Marsalis. With Marsalis, Murray was the co-founder of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Crouch wrote about Murray at length in his book &quot;Always in Pursuit&quot;.

Henry Louis Gates Jr. concluded his 1996 &quot;New Yorker&quot; profile of Murray by noting: &quot;This is Albert Murray&#x27;s century; we just live in it.&quot;

He was the inaugural recipient of the Harper Lee Award in 1998.

===Death===
Murray died in Harlem on August 18, 2013. The following month, a memorial service was held at Jazz at Lincoln Center.

The Library of America released an anthology of his nonfiction writing in 2016. Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Paul Devlin served as editors. A follow-up collection with Murray&#x27;s fiction and poetry was published in 2018.

<text>Bray Wanderers Football Club are an Irish association football club playing in the League of Ireland First Division. The club in its present form was founded in 1942 in Bray, and was known until 2010 as &quot;Bray Wanderers A.F.C.&quot; It was elected to the league in 1985, and plays its home matches at the Carlisle Grounds. The club colours are green and white, and it goes by the nickname &quot;The Seagulls&quot;.

== History ==
=== Early Days ===
In 1922, some members of St Kevin&#x27;s Gaelic football club in Bray left the club as a result of a dispute and formed a soccer club called Bray Wanderers. Through the 1930s and 1940s, however, Bray Unknowns were the leading team in the town, playing in the League of Ireland for nineteen seasons from 1924–25 to 1942–43. Bray Wanderers went into decline in the mid-thirties but was reformed in 1942–43 and entered the Athletic Union League Division 3 for the 1943–44 season. By the 1948–49 season Wanderers had reached Division 1 of the AUL but the period in between did not pass without controversy. In 1944 the club reached the Leinster Football Association Shield final but was disqualified for fielding an illegal player in the semi-final. When in Division 2 of the AUL in 1946–47 the club was expelled from the league due to the B team not fulfilling a league fixture, although the club was reinstated the following season. Wanderers won the Junior Cup in 1950-51 and again in 1953–54, defeating Ierne 1–0 in the Final. The following season Wanderers left the AUL and joined the Leinster Senior League.

=== Mid 1900s ===
In 1955–56 Wanderers won the FAI Intermediate Cup, defeating Workmens Club 2–1 in the final. There was also a first appearance in the FAI Cup against Longford Town in 1956. They won the FAI Intermediate Cup again two years later, defeating Chapelizod 2–1 in the final. In 1964–65 they were founder members of the League of Ireland B Division. However they left after just one season and once again went into decline. By 1973 Bray Unknowns were playing in the LSL and the management changed the name to Bray Wanderers in a partially successful effort to amalgamate the two.

=== League of Ireland ===
Bray Wanderers were elected to the League of Ireland when it was expanded to two Divisions for the 1985–86 season. They played their first game as a League of Ireland club on 8 September 1985 in a FAI League Cup match against Dundalk with Jim Mahon scoring the club&#x27;s first goal at senior level. The Wanderers&#x27; secured promotion to the Premier Division by winning the League of Ireland First Division Championship that year. They were relegated back down to the First Division in the 1987–88 season. Wanderers did not regain Premier Division status until the 1990–91 season but had their first major success during their spell in the First Division. They won the FAI Cup in 1990 beating St Francis 3–0 in the first Lansdowne Road final with John Ryan becoming only the second player to score a hat-trick in a FAI Cup final. They made history by becoming the first ever First Division side to win the trophy. Due to this cup win, Wanderers competed in European competition, for the first time in their history in the 1990–91 season. They were defeated, however, by Trabzonspor in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup preliminary round.

After two seasons in the Premier Division, the club was once again relegated to the First Division where they remained for three seasons. In 1995–96 season, Wanderers were promoted back to the Premier Division as First Division champions, but were relegated back down in the following season. The next two seasons followed a similar pattern as they went back up and came straight back down. In 1998–99, a season they got relegated again, Wanderers won their second FAI Cup, defeating Finn Harps after two replays which earned them a spot in the 1999-2000 UEFA Cup against a Roy Hodgson led Grasshoppers.

In 1999–00, the club won promotion back to the Premier Division, and in 2000–01 Wanderers achieved their highest ever league finish of 4th place in the Premier Division. The club could not build on this as they were relegated back down in 2002–03 but were once again promoted in 2004. The club was relegated at the end of the 2009 season, but the demise of Cork City F.C. meant they were reinstated to the Premier Division. Finishing in a promotion/relegation play-off in 2010, the club maintained its Premier status following a penalty shoot-out with Monaghan United.

The following season, finishing sixth in the Premier Division, the club gained a place in the all-Ireland Setanta Cup, but early in 2012 conceded home and away matches to Glentoran FC in the first round of the competition (2–4 &amp; 0–3).

In the 2012 season, Bray finished tenth of 12 clubs in the Premier Division, five points above Dundalk, who had to survive a promotion/relegation battle against Waterford United to ensure their survival in the top flight.

In 2013, Bray were again in the relegation mix, and having finished second-last they played First Division promotion play-off winners Longford Town over two legs, winning 5–4 on aggregate.

On 10 January 2014, it was announced that Alan Mathews would be the new manager with Barry O&#x27;Connor as his assistant. The club ended the season in tenth place, just one point above UCD, and entered the 2015 season as the fourth-longest surviving Premier Division club.

===2015: Five managers in one season===
The club had five first team managers in total across the 2015 season. On 1 April 2015, Mathews resigned suddenly, together with the rest of his backroom team, citing a breakdown in communication with the club&#x27;s new owners: Gerry Mulvey &amp; Denis O&#x27;Connor, who had taken over during the off-season. The club appointed Under-19 coach Maciej Tarnogrodzki as interim senior team manager the following day.
The following month, the club announced that former Shamrock Rovers boss Trevor Croly had signed a three-year contract to manage the club.

Just one month later however, Croly also resigned in a similar fashion to Mathews before him. Mick Cooke was brought in to replace him as the fifth manager of the season (including temporary Player/Manager David Cassidy), and Bray finished the 2015 season in 8th position.

=== 2016 - 2021 ===
In July 2017, after much speculation about the future of the club, majority shareholder and interim chairman Gerry Mulvey released a statement which confirmed that the club was financially stable and outlined big plans for the future of the club. The statement was widely ridiculed, mainly due to its branding of Wicklow County Council as &quot;the North Korea of Ireland for business&quot; after the council&#x27;s repeated refusal to allow the Carlisle Grounds to be rezoned.

In September 2017, the FAI launched an investigation into alleged match-fixing surrounding Bray Wanderers friendly against Waterford on 8 September 2017. The FAI released a formal statement in February 2018 affirming that no evidence to support any charge had been found.

The 2018 season went badly for Bray, with the club losing 28 of their 36 league matches and exiting every cup competition at the first time of asking. The financial situation was not any better, with players voting to strike due to unpaid wages and medical costs. The players were eventually paid before the strike went ahead. On 26 July 2018, after several weeks of speculation over Bray&#x27;s future, the club was taken over by St. Joseph&#x27;s Boys academy director Niall O&#x27;Driscoll. Mulvey remained in a minority role. Bray were officially relegated to the League of Ireland First Division in October 2018, ending a 12-year stay in the top flight of Irish football.

===Merger with Cabinteely===
In November 2021, Bray Wanderers and Cabinteely F.C. announced a merger, technically a takeover of Wanderers by Cabinteely. The newly created team would be known as Bray Wanderers and continue to play in the Carlisle Grounds, with the intention to apply for a First Division licence. Bray&#x27;s former manager Pat Devlin returned for his second spell in the post, and the then Director of Football (DoF) at Cabinteely became the DoF for the new Bray Wanderers.

Since the merger and Devlin&#x27;s return to Bray Wanderers, there have been a number of conflicts. One such incident saw Devlin and fans engage in an &quot;ugly exchange&quot; at an away fixture against Wexford FC. There was even a substantial drop in attendance at the Carlisle Grounds at one point, as Bray experienced one of the worst seasons in their history, going from a title challenging side to one near the bottom of the table. In mid-2022, club chairman Tony Richardson reportedly stated that the club were &quot;making progress&quot; in &quot;eliminating crowd trouble which [..] marred some of their games this season&quot;, and the club stated that it had appointed a &quot;Fan Liaison Officer [..] for dialogue with fans who wish to make their point&quot;. A report in the &quot;Bray People&quot;, after the clubs&#x27;s eighth home league defeat of the season, referred to a &quot;lack of goals&quot; and a video reputedly showing &quot;people throwing pyrotechnics [..] over the walls of the Carlisle Grounds&quot;. With a 5–1 home defeat in Bray&#x27;s final home game of the 2022 season to Cobh Ramblers, the season ended with a 18.75% win record, among the worst season performances in the club&#x27;s history.

===2022 – Present===
In November 2022, former Wexford FC manager Ian Ryan was appointed as head coach, with Devlin remaining as &quot;Head of Football&quot;. In March 2023, Bray progressed to the semi-final of the Leinster Senior Cup with a 2–1 victory over reigning League of Ireland Premier Division champions Shamrock Rovers. Bray Wanderers were eliminated by LSL side Usher Celtic and slipped to a 7th-place finish in the First Division.

Bray started the 2024 season poorly with one win from the opening 8 games. In May 2024, Ian Ryan unexpectedly resigned as manager with Bray in 6th place. Assistants Lorcan Fitzgerald and Paul Heffernan took charge of the club and oversaw an upturn in results, raising Bray to third in the table. On September 10th, Lorcan Fitzgerald also resigned from management leaving Paul Heffernan in sole charge. Bray ended the 2024 regular season in 5th place earning the last play-off position. In the promotion semi-final Bray beat UCD 2–1 on aggregate over two legs after winning the opening leg 2–0 at home. In November, Bray faced Athlone Town in the promition play-off final at Dalymount Park. After going 2–0 down early on Bray pulled one back through Conor Knight&#x27;s deflected shot before Cole Omorehiomwan scored a last minute header to level at 2–2 and force extratime. After a goalless extratime, goalkeeper Jimmy Corcoran saved two penalties as Bray won 4–2 on penalties to advance to the promotion/relegation final. In front of over 5,000 spectators, Bray lost 3–1 to Drogheda United at Tallaght Stadium ending their promotion hopes.

== Ownership ==
The current ownership of the club is as follows:
* 51.0% - IngSoc Holdings (Tony Richardson)
* 41.7% - Milway Dawn (Gerry Mulvey)
* 4.9% - Pat Devlin
* 2.2% - John Deering
* 0.2% - John O&#x27;Brien

== Supporters ==
Up to 2022, Bray Wanderers had a small, but loyal fanbase, with annual average attendances generally around 700–1000 home fans. That fanbase was nearly wiped out prior to the start of the 2022 season. For away matches the Bray Wanderers Supporters Club organise a bus to run direct to the relevant ground. The service was stopped for a period in 2022, but has since resumed.

In March 2008, the Ultra group of Bray Wanderers fans, &quot;Na Fánaithe&quot;, was formed by five members of the supporters club. Unlike similar groups in Dublin, such as &quot;Briogáid Dearg&quot;, &quot;SRFC Ultras&quot;, &quot;Shed End Invincibles&quot; and &quot;Notorious Boo Boys&quot;, Na Fánaithe is a much smaller group.

In July 2022, Bray Wanderers fans formed a new supporters club, the &quot;1985 Seagulls&quot; group.

<text>The Vishal Haryana Party (translation: Greater Haryana Party) was a political party in the Indian state of Haryana, led by Rao Birender Singh.

The party was formed in an effort to bring culturally similar groups in the region together, but recognized a need to gain financial stability in order to maintain the Haryana state. It was first regional party of Haryana and successfully made its own Chief minister only after six months of formation of Haryana state in 1967. Initially, the party included only twenty-nine members, formed from non-Jan Sanghis present in the legislature at the time.

In the 1971 elections, the party released a manifesto that castigated the Congress Party for its &#x27;semi-authoritarian&#x27; governance of the region, as well as promoting their own support for farmers. The success of the party in the 1971 elections was attributed to Singh&#x27;s personality; however, those same results appeared to show that their emphasis on local political issues detracted from further success.

It merged with Congress (I) on 23 September 1978. It officially lost its status as a registered political party as of 23 July 1981.

<doc id="1234263" wikidata="Q5646331" url="?curid=1234263" title="Hampton Wick">
<text>Hampton Wick is a Thamesside area of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, England, contiguous with Teddington, Kingston upon Thames and Bushy Park.

Market gardening continued until well into the twentieth century. With its road and rail connections to London along the M4 corridor, it is within the London commuter belt. 

Although north of the River Thames, the area forms part of the Kingston upon Thames and East Molesey post towns based on the south side of the river. As the river flows north past Hampton Wick and Kingston, it is actually west of Kingston.

==History==
There is evidence of Roman occupation. Kingston Bridge, the first bridge linking the village with Kingston upon Thames is dated from about 1219 and replaced the Roman ford at this point.

Cardinal Wolsey is believed to have lived in Hampton Wick (in Lower Teddington Road) while waiting for Hampton Court Palace to be built. The parish of Hampton was split in the century after this time to form Hampton Wick.

Sir Richard Steele also lived in Hampton Wick, in a house he whimsically called &quot;The Hovel&quot;. He dedicated the fourth volume of &quot;Tatler&quot; to Charles, Lord Halifax &quot;from the Hovel at Hampton Wick, April 7, 1711&quot;, around the time he became Surveyor of the Royal Stables at Hampton Court Palace, Governor of the King&#x27;s Comedians, a Justice of the Peace and a knight.

The Hampton Wick Local Board was established in 1863 with headquarters at the &quot;idiosyncratic, tall, Dutch gabled&quot; Hampton Wick Local Board Office located at 45A High Street. It was built in 1884 by local architect Richard T. Elsam in an &quot;exuberant&quot; Jacobean style. The building presently serves as private housing.

Reverend Frederick Champion de Crespigny was a vicar of Hampton Wick who was also involved in many secular affairs, most notably at the Local Board where he was clerk. An excellent cricketer, he founded and presided the Hampton Wick Royal Cricket Club in Bushy Park in 1863. De Crespigny resided at a now demolished Gothic Revival Vicarage formerly located on Park Road, directly across from the Hampton Wick entrance to Bushy Park at Cobbler&#x27;s Walk.

The architect Edward Lapidge both designed and donated the land for a church, St John&#x27;s Hampton Wick, built in 1831. Lapidge had been born in the village. He also designed the present Kingston Bridge. In 2010, after five years of closure, the church re-opened its doors under the Church of England&#x27;s church planting scheme. Services were resumed in December 2010.

== Hampton Wick in popular culture ==

A tone poem &quot;Hampton Wick&quot; for orchestra was composed by Harry Waldo Warner and won the Hollywood Bowl Competition in 1932, then was premiered by Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in 1934. The music was based on a poem by Onslow Frampton which was the pen name of Warner himself.

In Cockney rhyming slang, &quot;Hampton Wick&quot; (often shortened to &quot;Hampton&quot;) means &quot;dick&quot; or &quot;prick&quot;, both of which are British vulgar slang names for the penis. Hence a character called Hugh Jampton in the 1950s BBC radio programme &quot;The Goon Show&quot; amongst many other similar examples. Another use of the term appeared in the 2000s BBC TV series &quot;The Office&quot; when Tim Canterbury bemoans the quality of Slough&#x27;s nightlife, recollecting a Tudor-themed club memorably displaying a punning notice stating &quot;Don&#x27;t get your Hampton Court&quot; in the men&#x27;s toilets. The title of rocker Sammy Hagar&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Standing Hampton&quot; also relates to the same piece of rhyming slang. Ian Dury used the name, and the phrase &quot;Hamptons don&#x27;t leave fingerprints&quot;, in the song &quot;Blackmail Man&quot; on his 1977 album &quot;New Boots and Panties!!&quot;

Hampton Wick was the setting for the 1970s Thames Television situation comedy &quot;George and Mildred&quot;. The area is near the former Thames studios at Teddington and filming took place at Manor Road in Teddington. &quot;Hampton Wick&quot; was also the title of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;&#x27; first &quot;classic serial&quot; spoof drama in their first BBC series (1973). Hampton Wick is referenced by British singer-songwriter Jamie T in the title track of his 2009 EP &quot;Sticks &#x27;n&#x27; Stones&quot;.
The Two Ronnies also use the word to comic effect in their 1971 sketch &quot;The Ministry of Pollution&quot; where the Minister of Pollution (Barker) says, &quot;North and Southampton will be joined together into one enormous hampton&quot;.

Hampton Wick (Station) also featured in the sitcom &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot; as the first of his train-based excuses for arriving late for work: &quot;Eleven minutes late, staff difficulties, Hampton Wick.&quot;

==Sport and leisure==
Hampton Wick Royal Cricket Club, founded in 1863, is a cricket club at the Royal Cricket Grand Pavilion in Bushy Park. The team currently plays in division three of the Surrey Championship League. The club&#x27;s first eleven finished the 2006 season as unbeaten champions of the Fullers League Division 2 1st-XI league and gained promotion to Division 1.

The Royal Paddocks Allotments are adjacent to Bushy Park and Hampton Wick Royal Cricket Club. They were established following a lease made by King George V in 1921.

==Demography and housing==

==Economy and transport==
The main economic features here are transport. Kingston University has a large hall of residence in the town. Some professional offices are by Kingston Bridge and these include a major office of HSBC bank. The A308 splits the Royal Parks, leading nearby to the A309 and A312 roads, north–south. Equally, the A311 passes through the heart of the district forming its short, convenience High Street and provider further connections than another B road by the park to the larger commercial centre of Teddington, centred less than from Hampton Wick&#x27;s railway station which is another economic hub of the area.

Hampton Wick railway station has connections to London Waterloo.

<text>Derek John de Solla Price (22 January 1922 – 3 September 1983) was a British physicist, historian of science, and information scientist. He was known for his investigation of the Antikythera mechanism, an ancient Greek planetary computer, and for quantitative studies on scientific publications, which led to his being described as the &quot;Herald of scientometrics&quot;.

==Biography==
Price was born in Leyton, England, to Philip Price, a tailor, and Fanny de Solla, a singer. He began work in 1938 as an assistant in a physics laboratory at the South West Essex Technical College, before studying Physics and Mathematics at the University of London, where he received a Bachelor of Science in 1942. He then worked as an assistant to Harry Lowery carrying out research on hot and molten metals, and working towards a London external Ph.D. in experimental physics, which he obtained in 1946. This work led to several research papers and to a patent for an emissive-correcting optical pyrometer. He then went to the USA on a Commonwealth Fund fellowship, working in Pittsburgh and Princeton, returning to England in 1947. He was married that year to Ellen Hjorth in Copenhagen.

In 1948 Price took a three-year position as a teacher of applied mathematics at Raffles College, Singapore, which was to become part of the National University of Singapore. There he met C. Northcote Parkinson, the naval historian, who stimulated a love of history in Price that would change the direction of his career. While in Singapore, he formulated his theory on the exponential growth of science. He was looking after the university&#x27;s complete run of the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;, while Raffles College had its library built. He started reading these, and as he placed the volumes in chronological order he noticed that their yearly height increased exponentially with time. This led to a presentation at the Sixth International Congress of the History of Science in Amsterdam, in 1950.

Returning to England, Price decided to make a career in the history of science, and enrolled for a second Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge, supported by an ICI fellowship. He had initially intended to work on a survey of scientific instruments, but during his studies he discovered &quot;The Equatorie of the Planetis&quot;, a Peterhouse manuscript in Cambridge University Library. The manuscript, written in Middle English, describes an Equatorium, an astronomical calculating instrument, and became the basis of the thesis for his PhD, which he obtained in 1954, and also for a book, published the following year. He believed the work to be by Geoffrey Chaucer, who had written &quot;A Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot;, but it is now attributed to a St Albans monk called John Westwyk.

Price received a Nuffield Foundation award for research in the History of science, which enabled him to work on scientific instruments during 1955–1956. He first prepared a catalogue of the instrument collection of the British Museum, and then a catalogue of all the ancient astrolabes that he was able to locate.

While working on his Ph.D. in Cambridge, Price met Joseph Needham, the historian of Chinese science. As a result of his work on the Equatorium Price was invited to participate in a project on medieval Chinese astronomical clocks. This led to the book &quot;Heavenly Clockwork&quot; by Needham, Wang Ling and Price, which was published in 1960.
Another interest in ancient technology concerned the Antikythera mechanism. This machine had been retrieved from a wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera in 1900, and its function had remained unknown. Price started working on this in the 1950s, and continued on and off for twenty years using various techniques including gamma radiography. He published two papers on the mechanism, in 1959 and 1974, showing that it was a planetary computer, dating from about 80 BCE. Also, with Joseph Noble, he studied the machinery of the Tower of the Winds in Athens, and showed it to be water-driven clockwork, showing times and seasons.

Around 1950, Price adopted his mother&#x27;s Sephardic name, &quot;de Solla&quot;, as a middle name. He was a &quot;British Atheist ... from a rather well-known Sephardic Jewish family&quot;, and although his Danish wife, Ellen, had been christened as a Lutheran, he did not, according to their son Mark, regard their marriage as &quot;mixed&quot;, because they were both atheists.
After obtaining his second doctorate, Price found advancement difficult in England. One colleague alleged that Price, who came from a lower-class background, was &quot;not socially house-trained,&quot; and he suspected that he was turned down for university positions for personal reasons. Price decided to move to the United States. In 1957 he became a consultant to the Smithsonian Institution, and then a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. At Princeton he studied ancient astronomy with Otto Neugebauer. In 1959 he joined the Department of History at Yale University initially as a one-year visitor. He would remain at Yale for the rest of his life.

Price gave a series of lectures in Yale in 1959, which formed the basis for a book, &quot;Science since Babylon&quot; (1961). In 1960, a Department of History of Science and Medicine was formed at Yale, largely through the efforts of John Fulton who had been Professor of the History of Medicine since 1951. Price became Professor of the History of Science, and on Fulton&#x27;s death in 1960 became chairman of the department. In 1962 he became the Avalon Professor of the History of Science.

The quantitative study of science, Scientometrics, and its application to science policy, became the principal focus of Price&#x27;s work from the 1960s onwards. In 1963 his best-known book &quot;Little Science, Big Science&quot; was published. Early in that year, he met Eugene Garfield, founder of the Science Citation Index (SCI), and formed a lasting collaboration. SCI would provide most of the data for his quantitative work, allowing studies not just of the quantity of scientific publication, but, for example, of the impact of those publications, and of the duration of that impact. In 1965, Price gave the first Science of Science Foundation lecture, entitled &quot;The Scientific Foundations of Science Policy&quot;, given at the Royal Institution in London. He argued that as science grew exponentially it presented new challenges to policy-makers, and that they could be helped by the kind of Scientometric work he was carrying out and promoting. Clearly exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely, and the slowing of growth rates will correspond to pressing issues around allocation of resources. He also emphasised the critical importance of communication, referring to the &quot;invisible college&quot;, a network of scientific communication that exists outside formal channels. The lecture was reviewed at length in the journal Nature.

Price died of a heart attack at the home of his oldest friend, Anthony Michaelis, in London, during a visit to attend the wedding of his niece. He was survived by his wife, Ellen, and their three children, Linda, Jeffrey, and Mark.

In 1984, Price received, posthumously, the ASIS Research Award for outstanding contributions in the field of information science.

Since 1984, the Derek de Solla Price Memorial Medal is awarded by the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics to scientists with outstanding contributions to the fields of quantitative studies of science.

==Scientific contributions==
Price&#x27;s major scientific contributions include:
* Price&#x27;s law, on the topic of authors publishing academic literature, proposed that half of the publications come from the square root of all authors. For example, if 100 papers are written by 25 authors, then formula_1 out of the 25 authors will have contributed 50 papers. However, empirical data suggest that Price&#x27;s law is a poor fit, while the related Lotka&#x27;s law is a good fit;
* Studies of the exponential growth of science and the half-life of scientific literature;
* Quantitative studies of the network of citations between scientific papers (Price 1965), including the discovery that both the in- and out-degrees of a citation network have power-law distributions, making this the first published example of a scale-free network;
* Price&#x27;s model, a mathematical theory of the growth of citation networks, based on what would now be called a preferential attachment process (Price 1976). This is closely related to the Matthew effect;
* An analysis of the Antikythera mechanism, an ancient Greek analogue computer and astronomical instrument (Price 1959, 1974).
* A full bibliography is provided by Yagi et al. (1986)

<text>Pseudolarix amabilis is a species of coniferous tree in the pine family Pinaceae. The species is commonly known as golden larch, but being more closely related to &quot;Keteleeria&quot;, &quot;Abies&quot; and &quot;Cedrus&quot;, is not a true larch (&quot;Larix&quot;). &quot;P. amabilis&quot; is native to eastern China, occurring in small areas in the mountains of southern Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and eastern Sichuan, at altitudes of . The earliest known occurrences are of compression fossils found in the Ypresian Allenby Formation and mummified fossils found in the Late Eocene Buchanan Lake Formation on Axel Heiberg Island.

==Growth==
It is a deciduous coniferous tree reaching tall, with a broad conic crown. The shoots are dimorphic, with long shoots and short shoots similar to a larch, though the short shoots are not so markedly short, lengthening about 5 mm annually. The leaves are bright green, 3–6 cm long and 2–3 mm broad, with two glaucous stomatal bands on the underside; they turn a brilliant golden yellow before falling in the autumn, hence the common name &quot;golden larch&quot;. The leaves are arranged spirally, widely spaced on long shoots, and in a dense whorl on the short shoots.

The cones are distinctive, superficially resembling small globe artichokes, 4–7 cm long and 4–6 cm broad, with pointed triangular scales; they mature about 7 months after pollination, when (like fir and cedar cones) they disintegrate to release the winged seeds. The male cones, as in &quot;Keteleeria&quot;, are produced in umbels of several together in one bud.

==Characteristics==
The golden larch is an attractive ornamental tree for parks and large garden. Unlike the true larches, it is tolerant of summer heat and humidity, growing successfully in the southeastern United States where most larches and firs do not succeed. In Europe growth is most successful in the Mediterranean region with notable specimens in northern Italy; further north in the United Kingdom it will grow, but only very slowly due to the cooler summers.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) is a UN Special Political Mission tasked with assisting the people of Afghanistan.

UNAMA was established on 28 March 2002 by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1401.

Reviewed annually, this mandate has been altered over time to reflect the needs of the country and was extended for one year, on 15 March 2024, by the UN Security Council Resolution 2727 (2024).

Resolution 2678 (2023) Stressing the important role that the United Nations will continue to play in promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan.

The Security Council also passed a second Resolution 2679 (2023) calling for an integrated and independent assessment with forward-looking recommendations for an &quot;integrated and coherent approach&quot; to address Afghanistan’s challenges.

The Security Council also recognized that the renewed mandate of UNAMA is consistent with its resolutions 1662 (2006), 1746 (2007), 1806 (2008), 1868 (2009), 1917 (2010), 1974 (2011), 2041 (2012), 2096 (2013), 2145 (2014), 2210 (2015), 2274 (2016), 2344 (2017), 2405 (2018), 2460 (2019), 2489 (2019), 2543 (2020), 2596 (2021), 
2626 (2022)

The United Nations has been involved in the region since 1946 when Afghanistan joined the General Assembly. Agencies such as UNICEF have been operating in Afghanistan since 1949.

==Structure==
UNAMA&#x27;s headquarters is in Kabul and it maintains a field presence across Afghanistan, as well as liaison offices in Pakistan and Iran. The Mission has around 990 staff: 644 Afghan nationals, 255 international staff, 68 international UNVs and 19 national UNVs (Figures from September 2024). The Mission has offices in Bamyan, Faizabad, Gardez, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kabul, Kandahar, Kunduz, Maimana, Pul-i-Khumri, and Jalalabad. The UNAMA opened a temporary remote office in Almaty, Kazakhstan in September 2021 to continue international humanitarian cooperation as result of the Taliban takeover.

Since 2008, and following a directive of the UN Secretary-General, UNAMA is an integrated mission. This means that the Special Political Mission, all UN agencies, funds and programmes, work in a multidimensional and integrated manner to better assist Afghanistan according to nationally defined priorities.

The SRSG is responsible for all UN activities in the country and directly oversees the Security Section, Strategic Communication Service, Human Rights Section, and Peace and Reconciliation. The SRSG&#x27;s Chief of Staff oversees UNAMA&#x27;s Field Offices.

Two deputy Special Representatives (DSRSG) oversee the main pillars of the mission – political and developmental issues. Included under these pillars are mission sections specializing in issues such as political analysis, reporting, and outreach, and donor coordination, as well as the coordination of UN agencies funds and programmes.

===Leadership===
UNAMA is headed by Special Representatives of the Secretary-General (SRSG) for Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, who was appointed to the post in September 2022, replacing Deborah Lyons. Nine Special Representatives have served in this capacity - Lakhdar Brahimi, (former Algerian Foreign Minister) served from October 2001 to January 2004, Jean Arnault held the post from February 2004 to February 2006, followed by Tom Koenigs from March 2006 to December 2007, Kai Eide from 2008 to 2010, Staffan di Mistura from 2010 to 2011, Ján Kubiš from 2012 to 2014, Nicholas Haysom from 2014 to 2016, Tadamichi Yamamoto from 2016 to 2020, and Deborah Lyons from March 2020 to June 2022.

Georgette Gagnon was appointed &quot;Deputy SRSG (political)&quot; in September 2024. Indrika Ratwatte was appointed &quot;Deputy SRSG (humanitarian)&quot; in November 2023.

==Political affairs==
The &quot;Deputy SRSG (political)&quot; also has specific responsibility for political affairs: political outreach, conflict resolution, and regional cooperation. Responsibilities include the analysis and reporting, political affairs, Women, Peace and Security, rule of law and a liaison office in Islamabad.

==Development and Humanitarian Assistance==
UNAMA&#x27;s &quot;Deputy SRSG (humanitarian)&quot; is expected to manage UN support for development efforts in Afghanistan, including capacity building and coordination of humanitarian assistance from international bodies. Ratwatte &quot;(DSRSG humanitarian)&quot; also holds the post of UN Resident Coordinator for Afghanistan, responsible for the coordination of the work of the UN Country Team.

<text>Cobh Ramblers Football Club (CRFC) is an Irish football club. The club, founded in 1922 and elected to the League of Ireland in 1985, hails from Cobh, County Cork and play their home matches at St. Colman&#x27;s Park. The club&#x27;s colours are claret and blue. The club was a founding member of the Cork Athletic Union League in 1947 and is the only one of the 14 founding clubs still in existence today.

==History==

Cobh Ramblers F.C owes its formation in 1922 to the success of a challenge football match between two local field hockey clubs, &#x27;Ramblers&#x27; and &#x27;Cork Tramways&#x27;. Given the town&#x27;s British connections at the time, hockey was relatively popular on Great Island. A desire to play football arose and the Laundry Field, at the rear of Cobh Hospital, was the venue. It was felt that an appetite existed for an official football club and preparations were made for such. At the subsequent meeting held in the Laundry, now the site of Park Road Day Centre, Cobh Ramblers A.F.C was formally established.

The Munster Football Association (M.F.A) had also been established in 1922 and the club became affiliated with the league shortly after inception. Ramblers were too late to enter the very first season, which was a short &#x27;shield&#x27; format and ultimately won by Barrackton. The first full season of the MFA, 1922/23, saw a number of new arrivals including Ramblers, Blackrock Rovers and Shandon. The club was entered into both the South Munster Senior and Junior Leagues, one of only five clubs to feature at both levels. Matches were played at the Laundry Field and Ramblers were permitted to use the Laundry premises for dressing rooms and committee meetings. A first ever final appearance came in the form of the 1923 Munster Junior Cup, as Ramblers lost out to Barrackton in the decider.

The club first won the Munster Senior Cup in 1925. Additional (provincial) Munster Senior Cup titles were captured in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1970s.

At a national level, the club played in the 1976 FAI League Cup, reaching the semi-finals.

Cobh Ramblers joined the League of Ireland in 1985, after many years as a Munster Senior League side. One of the most successful of those teams was the team of 1983, who got to the semi-final of the FAI Cup defeating several senior clubs on the way. They met Sligo Rovers in the semi-final that year, drawing crowds of over 20,000 to Flower Lodge for the home games as St Colmans Park was too small. There were three replays until Sligo finally won 3–2 and went on to win the cup.

In 1985, the FAI announced that the League of Ireland would be expanding through the creation of a second league, the First Division. Ten teams were selected to join the inaugural First Division. Cobh, Bray Wanderers, Derry City, E.M.F.A (Kilkenny City) and Newcastle United (Newcastlewest) were elected to step up from intermediate football whilst Monaghan United stepped up from the League of Ireland B Division. These six teams were joined by the bottom four clubs from the 1984/85 League of Ireland campaign, Drogheda United, Finn Harps, Longford Town and Sligo Rovers.

Cobh won promotion to the Premier Division in 1988, after finishing First Division runners-up to Athlone Town. Lasting just one season in the top flight, they won promotion again at the end of the 1992–93 season, this time as runners-up to Galway United. A play-off win over Finn Harps saw Ramblers retain their Premier Division status at the end of the 1993–94 season, but the club were relegated in second-last place the following year.

With Ramblers having played all but four of their League of Ireland campaigns in the LOI First Division, and local rivals Cork City FC more frequently playing in the LOI Premier Division, the two clubs have historically only met in pre-season friendlies and cup matches. However, during the 2022 and 2024 League of Ireland First Division seasons, when Cork City were playing in the First Division, the two teams played in what some sources described as &quot;derby&quot; games.

On 10 November 2007, Cobh Ramblers beat Athlone Town 1–0 in Lissywoollen to give the club their first piece of Senior Silverware and crowned them First Division Champions. During the 2007 season, they recorded a 27-game unbeaten run, keeping 22 clean sheets. Their points tally of 77 points was also a record for the league.

However, after being relegated from the League of Ireland Premier Division, Ramblers subsequently failed to obtain a licence for the First Division due to financial constraints and so compete in the Newstalk A Championship (Ireland&#x27;s third tier).

In 2010 Ramblers missed out on gaining promotion back to the League of Ireland losing to Salthill Devon in a play off.

The club&#x27;s most noted past player is former Irish international and Manchester United star Roy Keane, while Irish international Stephen Ireland is a product of the Youth System. Westlife singer Nicky Byrne, who was also a footballer on the books at Leeds United, had a spell with the club too.

On 18 March 2014, the club parted company with manager Dave Hill by mutual consent after five years. He was replaced by Martin Cambridge on an interim basis. In March 2015 Martin Cambridge tendered his resignation and Stephen Henderson returned to the club as first team manager. In Oct 2015 Stephen Henderson signed a new three-year contract with the club. In 2016, Henderson guided Ramblers to Munster Senior Cup victory and to a 3rd-place finish in the first division. Cobh Ramblers were the only side to defeat first division champions Limerick that season and this coincided with a run of 5 victories in their last 5 league games to reach the playoffs. They narrowly lost 3–2 on aggregate to Drogheda Utd despite overturning a 2–0 deficit in the return leg at United Park after only nine minutes.

In 2018, Ramblers reached the final of the EA Sports Cup Final. In the semi-final they defeated Dundalk 1–0 at home with striker Chris Hull scoring the winner. After defeating Dundalk, and denying the eventual champions a treble, Ramblers lost the final away to Derry City 3–1.

Having previously been a &quot;member owned&quot; club, in 2024 the club&#x27;s members voted to accept a takeover by FC32, an international investment group which also owns Swiss club AC Bellizona and Austrian club SKN St. Pölten.

St Colman&#x27;s Park, which has a capacity of over 4,000, was redeveloped during the mid-2000s. Construction of a new changing facility and press office along with a new chairman&#x27;s office was completed in 2006 along with new floodlights and a 900-seater stand replacing the old shed. The east stand, too has seen improvement with 450 new seats being installed. Plans for a new 900 seater stand adjacent to the existing stand have temporarily been put on hold due to minor financial difficulties at the club. A new slick surface was also added prior to the clubs admission to the Eircom/Airtricity League Premier Division in 2009.

The stadium has hosted international underage games including games in the 1994 UEFA European Under-16 Championship qualifiers. Munster Schools Senior Cup games have also been staged at the stadium including the final which was won by local Cobh school, Coláiste Muire in 2010.

==Current squad==
As of the 2024 season, the squad included:










==Supporters==
Cobh Ramblers&#x27; fanbase, sometimes known as the &quot;Claret and Blue Army&quot;, used to locate in the East stand, behind the goal. Nowadays they locate at the far end of the South stand. There is also a Cobh Ramblers Supporters Club, who are involved in fundraising for the club.

In 2019, Cobh Ramblers changed the ownership structure of the club and became a fully fan owned entity. This changed in 2024, when the club members voted to &quot;pass [ownership] into the hands of international investors [..] the FC32 group&quot;.

<doc id="1234283" wikidata="Q811241" url="?curid=1234283" title="1907 Romanian peasants' revolt">
<text>A [[peasant revolt]] () took place in Romania between 21 February and 5 April 1907. It started in northern Moldavia and, after three weeks in which it was localized in that area, it quickly spread, reaching Wallachia, including as far as Oltenia. The main cause was the discontent of the peasants over the inequity of land ownership, which was mostly in the hands of just a few large landowners.

Following the fall of the Conservative Party government on March 12, the new Liberal government crushed the revolt violently with the help of the Romanian Army, killing thousands of peasants in the process.

== Background ==
The 1864 land reforms gave the peasants full ownership rights for part of the land for which they previously had only the right to use. However, the peasants remained even after these reforms dependent on the local landlords. Additionally, the peasant population was rising fast, leading to rapidly shrinking properties: from an average family property of in 1896 down to in 1905 and in 1907. The state was also a big landholder; however, its policies for selling the land often did not favor poorer peasants, who were in the greatest need for land.

Needing to supplement their shrinking properties, the peasants were forced to use land owned by the landlords, who owned large estates. As population grew, the peasants became more and more desperate for land, leading to rapidly rising rents. At that time, peasants formed up to 80% of the Romanian population and about 60% of them owned small plots, or no land at all, while the large landowners owned more than half of the arable land.

The National Liberal Party&#x27;s policy to encourage peasant cooperatives was not successful, as many landlords feared the organization of the peasants, preferring to lease to individual peasants rather than to cooperatives. According to Ioan Lahovary, the Conservative Minister of Domains, a landlord could drive out a peasant refusing to pay his rent, but noted that for driving out a cooperative of 500 peasants, a regiment would be needed and the government may refuse to put it at the landlord&#x27;s disposal. As such, by the end of 1907, there were only 103 village cooperatives having a membership of 11,118 leasing , most of it leased from the state.

By 1900, most large landowners preferred to live in the cities and did not want to bother with the administration of their properties. Therefore, the peasants no longer leased directly from the landowner, but sub-leased it from an intermediary lessor (&quot;arendaș&quot;, or Arendators ). The fall of the price of grain on the world markets meant that the lessors would demand ever greater rents in order to make ends meet.

The blame for the revolt was initially put on Jewish intermediaries, given that many of the lessors were of Jewish background, especially in Northern Moldavia. The revolt quickly spread southward, losing some of its anti-Semitic character and becoming basically a protest against the existing system of land tenure.

== Course of events ==

The revolt began on the lands administered by one lessor, Mochi Fischer, in the village of Flămânzi by Trifan Roman Grosu, Ion Dolhescu, and Grigore Roman, due to Fischer&#x27;s refusal to renew the leases of the local peasants. Fischer used to lease about 75% of the arable land in three Romanian counties in Moldavia (the so-called &quot;Fischerland&quot;).

The peasants, fearing that they would remain without work and, more importantly, without food, began to act violently. Scared, Fischer fled to a friend in Cernăuți, leaving the peasants without signed contracts. The fear of remaining out of work, combined with the activities of alleged Austro-Hungarian instigators, led the peasants to revolt. The revolt soon spread across most of Moldavia, with several landowners&#x27; properties destroyed and many lessors killed or wounded. The Conservative government (&quot;Partidul Conservator&quot;), led by Prime Minister Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, couldn&#x27;t handle the situation and resigned, and the Liberals (&quot;Partidul Național-Liberal&quot;) of Dimitrie Sturdza assumed power, with Ion I. C. Brătianu as Minister of the Interior and General Alexandru Averescu as Minister of War.

On 18 March a state of emergency was declared, and then a general mobilization, with 140,000 soldiers being recruited by 29 March. The Romanian Army began firing on the peasants; thousands of peasants perished and more than 10,000 were arrested.

== Casualties ==

=== Peasants ===

The exact number of peasant deaths is unknown, and even the course of events are not clear, because the government, to hide the size of the massacre, ordered the destruction of all documents relating to the uprising.

Historian Markus Bauer mentions a greatly underestimated official figure of 419 deaths, while an unofficial figure, circulated by the press and widely accepted, of about 10,000 peasants killed, has never been proven to be true. The same figure of 419 deaths was mentioned by Ion I. C. Brătianu in the Romanian Parliament. The data available to the Prime Minister Dimitrie Sturdza indicated 421 deaths between 28 March and 5 April 1907. Likewise, about 112 were injured and 1,751 detained. Newspapers patronized by Constantin Mille, &quot;Adevărul&quot; and &quot;Dimineața&quot;, gave a figure of 12,000–13,000 victims. In a conversation with the British ambassador in Bucharest, King Carol I mentioned a figure of &quot;several thousand&quot;.

Prince , the minister plenipotentiary of Austria-Hungary in Bucharest at the time, and also General Averescu estimated the number of dead between 1,000–2,000. According to figures given by Austrian diplomats, between 3,000-5,000 peasants were killed, while the French Embassy mentioned a death toll ranging between 10,000–20,000. Historians put the figures between 3,000–18,000, the most common being 11,000 victims.

Another assessment of the number of victims was made by Major who in February 1910 was appointed by General Grigore C. Crăiniceanu to analyze 32 files that referred to this event. Based on these documents, Dabija drew up a 117-page report which he submitted to the Ministry of War, from which it emerged that 1,786 peasants had been shot.

=== Army ===
Only ten members of the Army were killed in the revolt: an officer, Lt. I. Nițulescu, killed in Stănești, Giurgiu County, two sergeants and seven soldiers. Four others were injured: an officer, Capt. Grigore Mareș, also wounded in Stănești, two sergeants and a soldier. Seventy-five soldiers of the Fifth Dorobanți Regiment (&quot;Vlașca&quot;) appeared before military courts and charged with revolt; 61 were sentenced to hard labor for life and 14 to five years in prison.

== Aftermath ==
Many intellectuals, among them Nicolae Iorga, Alexandru Vlahuță, Ion Luca Caragiale, Constantin Stere, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, and Radu Rosetti, protested against the violent intervention of the forces of repression. Others emphasized that the government had a special responsibility for the fate of the peasantry and the country in general, and therefore an urgent solution to the &quot;peasant question&quot; was required.

The Liberal government began a campaign to repress any kind of political organization of the peasants. Many teachers, priests and other countryside intellectuals were arrested, as were pro-universal suffrage activists Vasile M. Kogălniceanu and Alexandru Vălescu, who were regarded as instigators of the revolt.

The government also began enacting a series of reforms in order to provide some relief to the peasantry, but without expropriating the landlords. The December 23, 1907 law on agricultural contracts limited the degree to which the peasants could be exploited by the landlords and lessors: it set maximum prices for land leases, it set minimum wages for peasants working on landlords&#x27; estates and it established &quot;Casa Rurală&quot;, a bank which was supposed to help peasants to buy lots of from landlords. A law passed on April 12, 1908 banned anyone leasing more than at one time.

== Legacy ==
The events continued to resonate in the Romanian conscience, and were the subject of one of the novels of the interwar period, &quot;Răscoala&quot; (&quot;The Revolt&quot;), by Liviu Rebreanu, published in 1932. A film based on the book, Răscoala, was produced in 1965. The revolt also formed the subject of a painting by Octav Băncilă, and of a monumental statue which can still be seen in Bucharest.

<text>Ide Hill is a village within the civil parish of Sundridge with Ide Hill, in the Sevenoaks District of Kent, England. It stands on one of the highest points of the Greensand Ridge about three miles south-west of Sevenoaks. Its name first appears on record in 1250 as Edythehelle. It is an eponymic denoting &#x27;Edith&#x27;s hill&#x27;, from the Old English hyll &#x27;hill&#x27;. The village lies within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The church is relatively modern. The village had an Anglican chapel in 1806, built by Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London, who lived in nearby Sundridge; St Mary&#x27;s church was built in 1865 and &quot;has the distinction of being the highest church in Kent&quot; at above sea level. There are several old buildings round the sloping village green, including the 18th-century Cock Inn and the Ide Hill Village School, built in 1856 it is the second home of the school which unusually for a church school predates the church building as the school was formed in 1809.

Ide Hill Football Club, who have teams in the Kent County League, the Sevenoaks &amp; District League and the Crowborough &amp; District Junior League, play their home games on the Ide Hill Recreation Ground (behind the Cock Inn). As per the church, the football pitch &quot;has the distinction of being the highest in Kent&quot;.

Two of Kent&#x27;s places of interest are near Ide Hill: Bough Beech Reservoir and Emmetts Garden.

Bough Beech Reservoir was completed in 1969. A large area round it is leased to the Kent Trust for Nature Conservation as a nature reserve.

Emmetts Garden is in the care of the National Trust. It was laid out in the late 19th century. There is a stone seat near the village church to commemorate Octavia Hill, one of the Trust&#x27;s founders.

In his 1933 memoir &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot; George Orwell reports that Ide Hill was notorious for being the worst “spike” (a casual ward or homeless shelter) in all of England. Although in a footnote he confesses to finding it &#x27;not so bad&#x27;.

==Goathurst Common==
Goathurst Common is a hamlet within the civil parish of Sundridge with Ide Hill. It lies to the east of Ide Hill. Its road, Bessels Green Road, leads through Whitley Forest to the village of Bessels Green, near Sevenoaks to the south. There is no current chapel or church. The hamlet did have two but they have been converted into houses. It is a mainly residential area consisting of about sixty houses built since the early 1920s.
Goathurst Common is separated from Ide Hill by Stubbs Wood.

The playing field in Goathurst Common plays host every August Bank Holiday to the Annual Goat Hurling World Championships. This is a modern invocation of an ancient past time that may have given the Hamlet its name [Citation Needed]. The event was revived to celebrate Queen Elizabeth the Second&#x27;s Golden Jubilee on the 2nd of June 2002 and has been held every August Bank Holiday since. Unlike its ancient predecessor, a plush toy goat is hurled across a 30m marked playing area. No goats are harmed during the event.
The woodlands around Goathurst Common were devastated during the Great Storm of 1987, when many trees were brought down by very high winds.

<doc id="1234308" wikidata="Q64272" url="?curid=1234308" title="Rudolph Goclenius">
<text>Rudolph Goclenius the Elder (; born &quot;Rudolf Gockel&quot; or &quot;Göckel&quot;; 1 March 1547 – 8 June 1628) was a German scholastic philosopher. He is sometimes credited with coining the term &quot;psychology&quot; in 1590, though the term had been used by Pier Nicola Castellani and Gerhard Synellius 65 years earlier.

==Life==
He was born in Korbach, Waldeck (now in Waldeck-Frankenberg, Hesse).

Goclenius studied at the University of Erfurt, the University of Marburg and the University of Wittenberg, earning his M.A. in 1571. Subsequently, he directed gymnasiums in his hometown Korbach (1573) and in Kassel (Michaelmas 1575). In 1581, Landgrave Wilhelm IV of Hesse-Kassel, a renowned astronomer, denied Goclenius&#x27;s request to return to Korbach but allowed him to become a professor at the Philipps University of Marburg. There, he held chairs in physics, logic, mathematics, and ethics. Goclenius also served as a counselor to Wilhelm and his son Moritz, the latter of whom sent him to the Synod of Dort in 1618. In 1627, Moritz decided to allow Goclenius to retire peacefully due to his age.

While Goclenius is known for popularizing the term &quot;psychology&quot;, his most significant contribution lies in the field of ontology. Following Aristotle&#x27;s work, he gave this philosophical discipline its name and continued in Aristotle&#x27;s tradition. Ontology is thought to have been further developed in the 17th century by Goclenius.

Johann Balthasar Schupp satirically recounted that Goclenius claimed his work &quot;Analecta&quot; (published 1598 in Lich) was the best book he had ever written.

Jeremias Nicolai, a student at Korbach &quot;Stadtschule&quot; from Autumn 1574 onwards, brother of Philipp Nicolai, reported that Goclenius &quot;promptly&quot; composed a poem about &quot;fiery air phenomena&quot; () observed in the city on November 14, 1574. It was published in Marburg the same year. City historian Wolfgang Medding has suggested that this poem was inspired by an aurora, a hypothesis supported by historical records of auroral observations. Later, he treated auroras (&quot;chasmata&quot;) in a 1604 physics textbook.

On the morning of Trinity Sunday, on June 8, 1628, as Goclenius was preparing to go to church, he suffered a stroke and passed away. The previous day, he had dinner with Hermann Vultejus and his son-in-law Christoph Deichmann, Chancellor of Lippe. Vultejus recalled, that Goclenius was mentally sharp and articulate, just as he had been in his younger days. After his burial, which took place two days later, Wolfgang Riemenschneider (Loriseca) gave a speech in which he praised Goclenius as &quot;leader of today&#x27;s philosophers, Marburgian Plato, European light, Hessian immortal glory&quot;.

==Family==
Goclenius married his first wife, Margarethe, in 1570. Abraham Saur, a jurist in Marburg, recorded the following in his chronicle for April 10:

From this marriage his oldest son, Rudolph Goclenius the Younger, or Rudolf Goclenius, Jr. was born. He went on to become a professor in Marburg and a celebrated mathematician. It is thanks to Rudolph Goclenius, Jr., that a lunar crater bears his name. Additionally, he also worked on cures for the plague and gained fame for his miraculous use with the &quot;weapon salve&quot; or Powder of Sympathy. Among other notable descendants were Theodor Christoph Goclenius (1602–1673, medicine), Eduard Franz Goclenius (1643–1721, law) and Reinhard Goclenius (1678–1726, law).

==Philosophical attitude==
An epigram from the literary games at Kassel in December 1576, contributed by Goclenius to the physics of Wilhelm Adolph Scribonius of Marburg, emphasized the importance of logic and reason in understanding the world - a guiding motif for his work:

Goclenius&#x27;s philosophical views aligned closely with those of Aristotle. He belonged to a group called “Semiramists,” which consisted of Aristotelians advocating both dialectic interpretation of Aristotle&#x27;s teachings and the exposition of Ramism. While serving as a rector at Korbach &quot;Stadtschule&quot; Goclenius even composed a scholarly poem on the death of Petrus Ramus. Friedrich Beurhusius, in a letter to Johann Thomas Freigius in September 1575, mentioned Goclenius as a devoted follower of Ramus, alongside other schoolmen such as Johann Lambach and Bernhard Copius.

In 1610, Johann Heinrich Alsted wrote a manual providing information and advice on academic studies. According to Alsted, Goclenius considered four philosophers—Aristotle, Julius Caesar Scaliger (whose &quot;Exercitationes&quot; he referred to as his &#x27;Bible&#x27;), Jacopo Zabarella, and Jakob Schegk—to be essential reading (cumprimis legendos, meaning &quot;should be read first&quot;). He believed they should form the foundation of what he called the &#x27;Philosophical Library.&#x27; Contemporary authors have slightly modified Goclenius&#x27;s wording to imply that this selection would &quot;suffice&quot; to fill all the pulpits of philosophers. Another author felt compelled to clear up a contemporary semantic misunderstanding, according to which Goclenius&#x27; use of the word &#x27;Bible&#x27; in relation to Scaliger&#x27;s &quot;Exercitationes&quot; indicates an overestimation of reason among Calvinists.

==Works==
In his &quot;Disquisitiones Philosophicae&quot; (Philosophical Inquiries), published in 1599, Goclenius presents a synoptic table that categorizes philosophical doctrines, or liberal arts, into distinct domains of knowledge. It encompasses two main categories: Real Doctrines and Arts Guiding Our Understanding. Real Doctrines delve into objects of our understanding, including Universal Philosophy (which deals with being in general) and Particular Philosophy (addressing specific beings). Within Particular Philosophy, we find Theoretical (or Real) Philosophy (studying essence and quantity) and Practical (or Moral) Philosophy (focusing on ethics and politics). The practice of Physics is the Art of Medicine. The conjunction of Astronomy and Geography is Cosmography. The second category, Arts Guiding Our Understanding, includes Rhetoric, Grammar, and Logic. Given the diversity of his works, this classification system serves as a useful organizing principle, providing an overview of his writings. Additionally, it helps readers understand how Goclenius conceptually structured the world through his main category of Real Doctrines.

Goclenius authored over 70 books, with more than half of them published between 1589 and 1599. Furthermore, his extensive list of publications includes numerous academic disputations. This can be attributed to the statutes set by Landgrave Philip I on January 14, 1564, which mandated that professors at the University of Marburg conduct weekly examinations. Besides this institutional requirement, Goclenius’s conviction that truth is revealed through debate, whether with oneself or others, also played a significant role. Goclenius delivered three hours of lectures daily: one for the general public (pro lectione publica), one for master&#x27;s students (pro magistrandis), and one for bachelor&#x27;s students (pro baccalaureandis).

Notably, he used the term &#x27;ontology&#x27; in his &quot;Lexicon philosophicum&quot; (1613), a term originally coined by Jacob Lorhard in his &quot;Ogdoas Scholastica&quot; (1606).

=== Psychology ===
Goclenius made significant contributions that led to the knowledge field termed ‘psychology.’ Lecture notes from the University of Marburg indicate that he used the term ‘psychology’ as early as 1582 within the framework of a disciplinary classification, similar to J. T. Freigius (1574) and F. Beurhusius (1581). In 1586, he presided over two academic disputations, during which the word ‘psychology’ again appeared in adjectival form as a classificatory term. Although both disputations addressed the field of psychology, they revealed distinct conceptualizations of the soul or mind. The first thesis highlights the rational powers of the soul (vis cognoscendi &amp; eligendi) as central to the human experience. The second thesis, in contrast, denies that the rational aspect alone constitutes the form of man, suggesting a more integrated view (personaliter) of the human being. 

His anthology &quot;ΨΥΧΟΛΟΓΙΑ: hoc est, de hominis perfectione, animo, et in primis ortu hujus&quot;, published in 1590, became the first book to feature the term &#x27;psychology&#x27; in its title. In his dedicatory letter to Hartmann von Berlepsch, Goclenius introduced the theme of the book with an epistemological reflection. He explored the challenging and profound nature of understanding the mind (animus), the differing philosophical views on the sources of truth and knowledge, and the significance of this inquiry despite its difficulty. Regarding the question of the origin of the mind, Goclenius compiled two opposing viewpoints from treatises written between 1579 and 1589. Some suggest that souls are divinely created and placed into bodies (Creationism), while others argue that souls are inherited from parents (Traducianism). He encouraged readers to form their own opinions without condemning differing views. The full title of the book translates to English as &#x27;Psychology: that is, on the perfection of man, his mind, and especially its origin—the comments and discussions of certain theologians and philosophers of our time who are shown on the following page.&#x27; In this context, the term &#x27;psychology&#x27; refers both to the subject of inquiry (&#x27;the perfection of man, his mind, and especially its origin&#x27;) and to the inquiry itself (&#x27;the comments and discussions of certain theologians and philosophers of our time&#x27;).

Research over the past decades has gradually identified the sources of the treatises since the book lacks bibliographic references in the modern sense.

In the 17th century, Goclenius&#x27; ΨΥΧΟΛΟΓΙΑ was widely read and quoted by scholars such as Robert Burton, Daniel Sennert, and Jakob Thomasius. Goclenius himself revisited his ΨΥΧΟΛΟΓΙΑ in a 1604 textbook on natural science and in various philosophical disputations.

Nevertheless, historians of psychology have disagreed on whether Goclenius, with his ΨΥΧΟΛΟΓΙΑ, aimed at an innovative approach for exploring the soul or to establish psychology as an independent field. Friedrich August Carus, in 1808, had referred to Goclenius&#x27; ΨΥΧΟΛΟΓΙΑ as a &quot;Lehrbuch&quot; (&#x27;textbook&#x27;), placed in temporal succession to Casmann’s Psychologia anthropologica (1594). However, this was already disputed in the 19th century. Researchers since then have converged in their classification of this book, with some labeling it as a &quot;Sammelwerk&quot; (&#x27;collection&#x27;, Schüling, 1967), &quot;Sammelband&quot; (&#x27;compilation&#x27;, Stiening, 1999), or &quot;Anthology&quot; (Vidal, 2011). This, at least on a linguistic level, is more in line with the fact that Goclenius used the Latin verb &#x27;congessi&#x27; (collect, bring together) in his dedicatory letter to Berlepsch to characterize his approach.

=== Logic ===
Goclenius&#x27; crowning achievement is his original contribution made to term logic, called the Goclenian Sorites. In the words of the British logician Carveth Read:

&quot;It is the shining merit of Goclenius to have restored the Premises of the Sorites to the usual order of Fig. I.: whereby he has raised to himself a monument more durable than brass, and secured indeed the very cheapest immortality. How expensive, compared with this, was the method of the Ephesian incendiary!&quot;
An example for the use of sorites in an argumentative context is presented by Goclenius in his &quot;Dissertatio De Ortu Animi&quot; which concludes the first edition of the &quot;Psychologia&quot;.

Contrary to Carveth Read&#x27;s assessment, however, Dr. Rudolph Goclenius did not invent the Goclenian Sorites: St. Thomas Aquinas did:

&quot;[A] second demonstration takes as its starting point the conclusion of a first demonstration, whose terms are understood to contain the middle term which was the starting point of the first demonstration. Thus the second demonstration will proceed from four terms the first from three only, the third from five, and the fourth from six; so that each demonstration adds one term. Thus it is clear that first demonstrations are included in subsequent ones, as when this first demonstration—every B is A, every C is B, therefore every C is A—is included in this demonstration—every C is A, every D is C, therefore every D is A; and this again is included in the demonstration whose conclusion is that every E is A, so that for this final conclusion there seems to be one syllogism composed of several syllogisms having several middle terms. This may be expressed thus: every B is A, every C is B, every D is C, every E is D, therefore every E is A.&quot;

==Publications==
Bibliographies of Goclenius&#x27;s writings were compiled by Friedrich Wilhelm Strieder (&quot;Grundlage zu einer hessischen Gelehrten und Schriftsteller Geschichte,&quot; Bd. 4, Göttingen 1784, pp. 428–487; Bd. 9, Cassel 1794, p. 381; Bd. 13, Cassel 1802, pp. 341–343; Bd. 15, Cassel 1806, p. 338) and Franz Joseph Schmidt (&quot;Materialien zur Bibliographie von Rudolph Goclenius sen. (1547-1628) und Rudolph Goclenius jun. (1572-1621)&quot;, Hamm 1979). Schmidt was a historian of medicine based in Hamm (Westphalia). His bibliography is organized into five groups: scientific works, academic writings, occasional writings, writings with Goclenius as editor or author of a foreword, and writings listed in the catalogue of the British Library but not in Strieder&#x27;s Dictionary. Strieder’s bibliography is arranged chronologically.

The reprint in Melander’s book is preceded by a letter from Goclenius to Melander. In the letter, Goclenius expresses his approval of Melander’s work refuting the practice of witch purgation by cold water. He mentions that he was once tasked by William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, through his Chancellor, to investigate the physical causes of witches floating, which led him to compose a speech on the subject.]

<text>The lempira (, sign: L, ISO 4217 code: HNL;) is the currency of Honduras. It is subdivided into 100 centavos.

== Etymology ==
The lempira was named after the 16th-century &quot;cacique&quot; Lempira, a ruler of the indigenous Lenca people, who is renowned in Honduran folklore for leading the local native resistance against the Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; forces. He is a national hero and is honored on both the 1 lempira note and the 20 and 50 centavos coins.

==History==
The lempira was introduced in 1931, replacing the peso at par. In the late 1980s, the exchange rate was two lempiras to the United States dollar (the 20-centavos coin is called a &quot;daime&quot; as it was worth the same as a U.S. dime). As of April 4, 2022, the lempira was quoted at 24.40 HNL to US$1.

==Coins==

In 1931, coins were introduced in denominations of 5, 20 &amp; 50 centavos, and 1 lempira. One, 2 and 10 centavos coins were added in 1935, 1939 and 1932, respectively. The silver 1 lempira coins ceased production in 1937, with the other silver coins (20 &amp; 50 centavos) replaced by cupro-nickel in 1967. The 1 and 2 centavos coins were last minted in 1998 and 1974, respectively.

Coins of the following denominations are currently legal tender. However as of 2024 coins are only very rarely used for payments. In practice only banknotes are used.

*1 centavo
*2 centavos
*5 centavos
*10 centavos
*20 centavos
*50 centavos

==Banknotes==
The Bank of Honduras and the Banco Atlantida issued the first lempira banknotes in 1932. They were in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 lempiras. The Central Bank of Honduras took over production of paper money in 1950, introducing 50 and 100 lempiras notes in 1950, followed by the 500-lempiras note in 1995.

In January, 2010, a new 20-lempira note was introduced to market made by a polymer base, 60 million notes were issued.

In celebration of the bicentennial anniversary of Honduras&#x27;s independence, a new 200 lempira bill was issued. It features 2 scarlet macaws, the national bird of Honduras.

<doc id="1234313" wikidata="Q988797" url="?curid=1234313" title="Pirenópolis">
<text>Pirenópolis, also known as Piri, is a historic municipality located in the Brazilian state of Goiás. It is known for its waterfalls and Portuguese colonial architecture, and a popular festival involving mounted horses called Festa do Divino Espírito Santo which takes place 45 days after Easter. Pirenópolis is located 120 km from Goiânia, the state capital, and 150 km from Brasília, the federal capital.

==History==
The history of Pirenópolis begins in 1727 when it was founded with the name of Minas de Nossa Senhora do Rosário de Meia Ponte, Meia Ponte (half a bridge) because half of the bridge over the Almas River was swept away in a flood. The first colonizers were Portuguese who came for the gold easily found in the Rio das Almas. From 1750 to 1800 there was a golden age when four churches were built and Pirenópolis competed with Vila Boa (present day Cidade de Goiás) as the richest town in the province. After 1800 a downturn over gold mining was set and the part of the population emigrated. With the change of commercial routes to Anápolis, the city became economically isolated. The first newspaper in the province, the Matutina Meiapontense, was published in Meia Ponte in 1830 by Joaquim Alves de Oliveira. In 1890 the city changed its name from Meia Ponte to Pirenópolis, the city of the Pireneus, the mountains located nearby. In 1960 with the construction of Brasília there was an intensive exploitation of the famous Pedra de Pirenópolis (quartzite-micáceo). In the 1980s the hippies arrived with their alternative communities and production of handicrafts. Pirenópolis was born again with a huge influx of tourists, especially from Brasília. Churches were restored and all the electrical wiring was put underground.

==Etymology==
 Pyrenópolis (archaic orthography), later Pirenópolis , means in Greek “the City of the Pireneus”. Its name comes from the mountain range that surrounds the city, that is &quot; Mountain range of the Pireneus &quot;. According to local tradition, the mountain range received this name for having in the region immigrant Spaniards, probably Catalans. Because of some similarity with their native Pyrenees of Europe, a mountain chain situated between Spain and France, they had then given this mountain range the Latin name of &quot;Pireneus&quot;.

== Historic site ==

Listed as an architectural, urbanistic, landscape and historical heritage for IPHAN - the Institute of National Historic and Artistic Heritage, in 1989, the city has a Historical Center with large, ornate houses and churches of the 18th century, such as: First Church of Our Lady of the Rosary (1728–1732), Churches of Our Lady of the Carmo (1750–1754) and the Church of Our Lord of the Bonfim (Pirenópolis) (1750–1754), and buildings such as the Theater of Pirenópolis, a hybrid style between colonial and neo-classic, of 1899, and the Cine-Pireneus, built in the art-deco style, of 1919 and the House of Chamber and Jail constructed in 1919 as an identical restoration of the 1733 original.

==Climate==
The climate is humid sub-tropical with two well-defined seasons: the rainy season, which goes from October to March, and the dry season, which goes from April to September. Parts of the municipality are mountainous and maintain some climatic variations due to altitude.

==Economic information==
The economy is based on agriculture (coffee, citrus fruits, soybeans, and corn), cattle raising (130,000 head in 2006), services, public administration, and small transformation industries. There are several small food, clothing, and furniture industries.

==Tourism==
Major attractions include Igreja Nossa Senhora do Rosário de Meia Ponte, the oldest church in Goiás, and the church Igreja Nosso Senhor do Bonfim. It also has a hippie-like colony which markets clothing and silverwork.

Today Pirenópolis is known all over Brazil for its popular festivals, especially the &quot;Cavalhadas&quot;, introduced in 1826, in which horsemen representing Moors and Christians recreate a battle fought by Charlemagne. This tradition, part of the Festival for the Holy Spirit (Festa do Espírito Santo), was brought to the town by Portuguese settlers.
The Festas de Cavalhadas feature a parade beginning with a bugle fanfare announcing the knight&#x27;s pages, then the mounted knights displaying their colors. Wearing papier-maché helmets, the Christian knights wear blue, the Moors wear red. The battle lasts three days and attracts thousands of visitors to the town. The Cavalhadas take place in medieval costume, with the highlight being the mock battle, performed in the city&#x27;s bullring. The Moors invariably are defeated and convert to Christianity. Cavalhadas

The town has been restored artistically with its stone paved streets and colonial houses (casarões). The Almas River, a tributary of the Tocantins River which flows north to form the Serra da Mesa artificial lake, passes near the town and is crossed by a restored wooden bridge. There are an old theater, cinema, and a museum of the cavalhadas.

The municipality contains part of the Pirineus State Park, created in 1987.
Waterfalls are the primary tourist attraction for Pirenopolis and Corumbá. Around the town, in a distance of 15 km., there are more than twenty spectacular waterfalls with pristine water. Some of them are enormous such as the Salto de Corumba (which disappeared for decades when prospectors diverted the waters for dredging). Other waterfalls are formed by a series of cascades. Many are on private property and are operated as a business. Other falls can be found on hiking trails. One of the longest rivers in the state of Goiás, the Corumbá River has its source near Pirenópolis.

A new attraction to Pirenopolis is the small ecovillage and permaculture design institute located a few kilometers outside of town called the IPEC or The Institute of Permaculture and Ecovillage of the Cerrado. Bringing in foreign students through study abroad programs such as Living Routes, visitors get a first-hand account of the possibilities of sustainable living.

<doc id="1234317" wikidata="Q939489" url="?curid=1234317" title="Benvolio">
<text>Benvolio Montague () is a fictional character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. He is Lord Montague&#x27;s nephew and Romeo&#x27;s cousin. Benvolio serves as an unsuccessful peacemaker in the play, attempting to prevent violence between the Capulet and Montague families.

==Sources==
In 1554, Matteo Bandello published the second volume of his &quot;Novelle&quot; which included his version of &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot;. Bandello emphasises Romeo&#x27;s initial depression and the feud between the families, and introduces the Nurse and Benvolio. Bandello&#x27;s story was translated into French by Pierre Boaistuau in 1559 in the second volume of his &quot;Histoires Tragiques&quot;. Boaistuau adds much moralizing and sentiment, and the characters indulge in rhetorical outbursts.

==Etymology==
The name Benvolio means &quot;good-will&quot; or &quot;well-wisher&quot; or &quot;peacemaker&quot; which is a role he fills, to some degree, as a peacemaker and Romeo&#x27;s cousin. He also wants peace so civil brawls between him and Tybalt can stop but will do anything for his family even if that means war against the Capulets. (For comparison, see the derivation of Malvolio – ill-will – in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.)

==Role in the play==
Benvolio is Lord Montague&#x27;s nephew and Romeo&#x27;s cousin. He is usually portrayed by Shakespeare as a kind and thoughtful person who attempts to look out for his cousin.

Benvolio spends most of Act I attempting to distract his cousin from his infatuation with Rosaline but following the first appearance of Mercutio in I.iv, he and Mercutio become more closely aligned until III.i. In that scene, he drags the fatally wounded Mercutio offstage, before returning to inform Romeo of Mercutio&#x27;s death and the Prince of the course of Tybalt and Mercutio&#x27;s deaths. Benvolio then disappears from the play (though, as a Montague, he may implicitly be included in the stage direction in the final scene &quot;Enter Lord Montague and others&quot; and he is sometimes doubled with Balthasar).

Part of Benvolio&#x27;s role is encouraging Romeo to go to the party, where he falls in love with Juliet.

==Performances==
A mock-Victorian revisionist version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;″s final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio and Paris restored to life and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris&#x27;s love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play &quot;The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby&quot;. He also attempts to romance Rosaline in Sharman Macdonald&#x27;s &quot;After Juliet&quot;.

In the 2019 British musical &quot;&amp; Juliet&quot; Benvolio is portrayed by actress Kirstie Skivington.

==Portrayals==

In 1968 the part of Benvolio was played by Bruce Robinson in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

In the 1996 version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the actor who played Benvolio was Dash Mihok.

<text>.mm is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Myanmar. It was assigned in 1997. Before 1989, the ISO 3166 alpha-2 code for Burma was BU, but no .bu ccTLD was assigned.

On 12 June 2011, the ISO 3166-1 code for Myanmar changed to reflect the MM used for the ccTLD.

==History==
A company run by two Australian immigrants in Myanmar, Eagle Group, set up the first Internet access to Myanmar in 1997. They contracted with British company called Digiserve based in High Wycombe, to provide DNS services for .mm. All .mm DNS queries were handled by Digiserve&#x27;s two name servers acting as root name servers for .mm, &quot;ns1.digiserve.com&quot; and &quot;ns2.digiserve.com&quot; respectively. In 1999, Eagle Group&#x27;s service was shut down by the Burmese government.

Afterwards, these two servers then delegated the SOA authority of .com.mm, .net.mm, .edu.mm and org.mm TLDs to the two name servers managed by Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications, &quot;ns0.mpt.net.mm&quot; and &quot;ns1.mpt.net.mm&quot;, both servers were located in Yangon.

In February 2002, the DigiServe DNS servers were hacked by pro-democracy activists, which resulted in the traffic to all .mm domain names including www.gov.mm being redirected to a website demanding the release of famous student leader Min Ko Naing for a period of three days.

In the beginning of 2005, MPT finally retook management control of .mm name space and replaced Digiserve nameservers with their own.

Businesses in Myanmar could register for domain names within the .net.mm and .com.mm zones through Myanmar Teleport (formerly Bagan Cybertech) or from Myanmar Post &amp; Telecoms directly. .edu.mm, .org.mm, .gov.mm domain names are reserved for official and government use. There is no whois service provided.

Myanmar Teleport&#x27;s service was later shut down by the Burmese government as well, leaving government-owned Myanmar Post &amp; Telecoms as the sole controller for all the services for internet and email.

<text>Devon and Cornwall Police is the territorial police force responsible for policing the ceremonial counties of Devon and Cornwall (including the Isles of Scilly) in South West England. The force serves approximately 1.8 million people over an area of .

==History==
The force was formed on 1 April 1967, by the amalgamation of the Devon and Exeter Police, Cornwall County Constabulary and Plymouth City Police. These three constabularies were in turn amalgamations of 23 city and borough police forces that were absorbed between 1856 and 1947.

Between 1856 and 1947, police in Devon and Cornwall used a number of different names. They were gradually absorbed into two of the existing forces called Devon and Exeter Constabulary and Cornwall County Constabulary, with Plymouth City Police remaining separate. In 1967 these three remaining forces were amalgamated into one called Devon and Cornwall Constabulary or Devon and Cornwall Police.

The archives and objects that relate to Devon and Cornwall Police and its antecedent forces are now held by the Museum of Policing in Devon and Cornwall.

In July 2023, the police and crime commissioner (PCC) suspended Chief Constable Will Kerr over sexual allegations. While that was being investigated, the PCC appointed Acting Chief Constable Jim Colwell. In November 2024, the PCC suspended the acting chief constable over allegations relating to messages sent on a police-provided mobile pone, and in December appointed the retired chief constable of Dorset Police, James Vaughan, as interim chief constable.

===Officers killed in the line of duty===

The Police Roll of Honour Trust and Police Memorial Trust list and commemorate all British police officers killed in the line of duty. Since its establishment in 1984, the Police Memorial Trust has erected 50 memorials nationally to some of those officers.

Since 1814, the following officers of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary and its predecessors were killed while attempting to prevent or stop a crime in progress:
* Town Sergeant Joseph Burnett, 1814 (shot attempting to disarm two drunken soldiers)
* PC William Bennett, 1875 (injured arresting a man for assault)
* PC Walter Creech, 1883 (stabbed by a man he warned)
* PC John Tremlett Potter, 1938 (fatally injured by two burglars he disturbed)
* PC Dennis Arthur Smith, 1973 (shot by a suspect he was pursuing)
* PC Christopher Francis Wilson, 1977 (contracted a fatal illness after being spat on during a disturbance at a football match)
* PC Joseph James Childs and PC Martin Ross Reid, 1978 (drowned after their car was swept into the sea during a storm)

==Suspension of Chief Constable Will Kerr==
Will Kerr, who joined the force in December 2022, was reported on 26 July 2023 as being suspended by Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez. A statement issued by Hernandez&#x27;s office said: &quot;Pursuant to section 38(2) of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, Alison Hernandez, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall, has suspended the Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police, Will Kerr OBE KPM, following allegations of misconduct.

==Oversight==
Since 5 May 2016, the Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner is Alison Hernandez, who represents the Conservative Party. 
The police and crime commissioner is scrutinised by the Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Panel, made up of elected councillors from the local authorities in the police area. Before November 2012, the force was governed by the Devon and Cornwall Police Authority.

==Organisation==
, the force has 3,593 individual police officers, 549 special constables, 320 police community support officers (PCSO), and 2,236 staff. Training for new recruits is held at the Headquarters in Middlemoor. For constables, it consists of eight months training and a two-year probationary period. For special constables it consists of three months of online learning and practical weekends training and a two-year probationary period or less, dependent on the number of tours of duty. For PCSOs, it consists of 18 weeks training and a 15-week probationary period. Recruits receive their warrant card and uniform in the first two months of training.

The force is divided into four Basic Command Units (BCU), each commanded by a Chief Superintendent. Geographically larger BCUs are further split into Local Policing Areas (LPAs), under a Superintendent, which are further sub-divided into Sectors, each under an Inspector. The Plymouth and South Devon BCUs only contain one LPA, being divided directly into sectors. Most sectors contain a police station, while in Plymouth there are numerous neighbourhood bases or police stations (Crownhill, Charles Cross, Plympton, Devonport).

Each BCU will have several specialist teams, including Patrol, Neighbourhood Policing Teams, a Criminal Investigation Department and various pro-active policing units to target persistent criminals and focus on specific operations.

The four BCUs are:
*Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly BCU 
**East Cornwall geographic LPA
**West Cornwall geographic LPA
*South Devon BCU
*Devon BCU
**Exeter East and Mid geographic LPA
**North and West Devon geographic LPA
*Plymouth BCU
**Plymouth geographic area

=== Force contact centre ===

The force contact centre is located at two sites: police HQ in Middlemoor, Exeter and Crownhill police station in Plymouth, both operating 24/7. Calls from all parts of the force are assigned to the next available agent, whichever site they are working from. Calls are answered by trained civilian staff, with police officers in some supporting and supervisory roles. Both 999/112 and non-emergency calls are answered by multiskilled staff, with other duties including the Force Switchboard, found property recording, crime recording, requests from other police forces, emails from the public, and the force website. Radio dispatch officers are located in the control rooms at both sites and deploy police officers following calls for service from the contact centre. The two control rooms use the national Airwave emergency service secure radio system, which is due to be replaced in the early 2020s.

===Operations department===

The operations department provides uniformed operational support to the force, and is responsible for traffic policing and tactical support.

====Roads policing Team====
Devon and Cornwall Police patrol a section of the M5, as well as many &#x27;A&#x27; roads. The team is split up into 5 stations across the force. These are Exeter, Plymouth, Barnstaple, Bodmin and Camborne. They deploy in marked and unmarked high performance vehicles. The unit also has officers that patrol on marked and unmarked motorcycles.

Roads Policing officers conduct proactive enforcement on the roads as well as investigating serious and fatal road traffic collisions. 

Under the Roads Policing Team is the No Excuse Team. This is a proactive roads policing team that deploy predominantly in unmarked high performance vehicles to enforce against Fatal 5 offences.

====Force Support Group====
The Force Support Group (FSG), previously called the Tactical Aid Group (TAG), is predominantly responsible for public order, marine operations, searches and dealing with potentially violent offenders.

The FSG&#x27;s Marine Support Unit, also known as FSG D Section, is responsible for underwater search and marine operations.

====Dog section====
The force has police dogs, which are trained in a variety of roles including drugs dogs, explosives dogs and firearms support dogs. 
The unit, which is headed up by an inspector, is based at headquarters in Middlemoor, in Exeter.

====Armed response ====
Also under Devon and Cornwall&#x27;s Operations Department is the Firearms Unit. All officers are trained as Armed Response Vehicle Officers (ARVOs), with the additional Tactical Firearms Team (TFT) who are SFO&#x27;s. The ARVs are tasked with responding to incidents where firearms and other weapons are involved. They are routinely armed.

==== Air Operations Unit====
Air support is provided by the National Police Air Service (NPAS), which operates a dedicated police helicopter out of Exeter Airport.

The now-closed Air Operations Unit previous flew a MBB/Kawasaki BK 117. It took delivery of a Eurocopter EC145 in April 2010, with its call sign being OSCAR 99. The unit was able scramble in two minutes and could reach most areas of the force within 15 minutes.

===Force crime department===
The force crime department contains the central units of the force&#x27;s Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which also has detectives attached to the larger police stations. It is headed by the force crime manager, a detective chief superintendent. It also comprises the major crime branch, covert operations unit, intelligence unit, performance and co-ordination unit, scientific and technical services unit.

===Other departments===
*The Contingency Planning Unit formulates long-term plans to deal with major incidents, including security for VIP visits, counterterrorist operations and reaction to terrorist attacks.
*The Force Planning and Consultation Unit formulates policy and plans and monitors public opinion on policing matters.
*The Professional Standards Department deals with force discipline and complaints against officers.

== Uniforms and equipment ==

=== Headgear ===
In 2020, the force moved to a gender neutral position on headwear, permitting any officer to wear a (traditionally) male or female hat either the custodian helmet, or a peaked cap with a chequered Sillitoe tartan band, or a bowler hat, also with Sillitoe tartan, under all circumstances.

Traffic police headgear is the same as that for any other vehicle patrol but has a white rather than a black top, originally designed to aid visibility before the advent of fluorescent fabrics.

PCSOs wear a peaked cap or bowler hat, but with a blue band.

Tri Service Safety Officers (TSSOs) wear a peaked cap or bowler, with a grey band.

=== Uniform ===
When on operational duty, officers wear black wicken layer tops with black trousers and a black fleece with POLICE written on the chest and back. All officers are required to wear stab vests when on operational duty. Collar numbers for constables and sergeants, along with rank insignia for sergeants and above are worn either on epaulettes on the shoulder, or on patches on the upper arm, depending on the item of clothing. PCSOs wear a similar uniform, but with blue epaulettes rather than black.

Formal dress comprises an open-necked tunic, and a white shirt/blouse with a black tie for officers of all genders. Constables and sergeants have collar numbers on their epaulettes, sergeants wear rank insignia on their sleeve, while all higher-ranked officers wear name badges and their rank on their epaulettes. Gloves are sometimes worn.

=== Personal equipment ===
From 2018, both officers and PCSOs were provided with personal issue Combat Application Tourniquets for first aid and self aid purposes.

From 2019, officers were issued with Spit Guards, a transparent mesh that covers a suspect&#x27;s face should they spit at officers.

From 2019, after over a decade of false starts, operational officers and PCSOs were issued with Body Worn Video Police body cameras.

Police vehicles contain a variety of equipment, which can include straight batons, traffic cones, road signs, breathalysers, stingers, speed guns and more.

=== Vehicles ===

Devon and Cornwall Police use many different makes of vehicles from several different car manufacturers for different purposes. All marked, operational vehicles use yellow and blue retro-reflective battenberg markings, with the force&#x27;s crest.

== Performance and PEEL inspection ==
In 2010, Devon and Cornwall had the fourth lowest crime rate per 1,000 people in England. Recorded crime dropped by 12% between June 2009 and July 2010, compared to an 8% drop across England and Wales. In this survey, there were drops in all categories of crime except sexual offences and drug crimes, accounted for by increased reporting and more effective targeting of drug offences. 
Confidence in the police and public perceptions of crime were also better than the national average.

His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) conducts a periodic police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (PEEL) inspection of each police service&#x27;s performance. In February 2023, the force was awarded the following grades in its PEEL inspection:

==Budget cuts==
=== Proposed regional merger ===
In 2006, the Home Office announced plans to amalgamate a number of English and Welsh police forces in order to better combat the terrorism and organised crime that crosses force boundaries. The proposed idea would have merged Devon and Cornwall Police with Wiltshire Police, Avon and Somerset Police and Dorset Police. The plans, which would have cut the number of forces in England and Wales from 43 to 24, were abandoned in July 2006. However, in 2010 alternative plans were put forward which would have included Gloucestershire Police in a West Country merger. These plans were criticised by four of the forces involved, expressing concerns that they would lead to poor quality service and a reduction in local policing.

===Austerity===
The program of austerity from 2011 had an impact on the force: 
* The rural crime grant, worth £1.8M to Devon &amp; Cornwall, about the cost of 70 officers, was abolished. 
* The central government grant was cut by 20%.
* In comparison to other forces, the council tax precept was low. Rises in the precept were capped by central government.

The organisation was forced to cut officers, from 3,500 to 2,810. It also had to cut PCSOs and police staff, losing around 350 posts.
Many stations were closed and sold, controversially including a brand new station at St Columb Major. 
The service offered to the public was scaled back: for example in the past victims of car crime or burglary would have seen an officer in person. Since the austerity cuts, the majority of these crimes are &#x27;desktop investigated&#x27; by a centralised team.

A partial reversal of the cuts was announced in 2019 by the (then) new Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who pledged to replace 20,000 of the 21,000 officers cut in England and Wales since 2011.

Devon &amp; Cornwall officer numbers are not expected to return to their 2010 levels until 2023. There are no plans nationally to reverse the cut in police staff.

===Proposed merger with Dorset===
Later, from 2015, plans to merge with Dorset Police were brought to an advanced stage and an outline business case supplied to the Home Office. In the final stage of talks, three of the four parties agreed to proceed, being the Chief Constables of both forces and the Police &amp; Crime Commissioner (PCC) of Dorset. However, Devon &amp; Cornwall PCC Alison Hernandez withdrew her support for the merger, in a U-turn. It is thought her change of heart was a result of pressure from the local authorities, notably members of Cornwall Council and Torbay Council and the plans were shelved.

==Other activities==

===Devon and Cornwall Police Pipes and Drum Band===

The Devon and Cornwall Police Pipes and Drum Band is a band made up of pipe and drums players who play on behalf of the police force in aid of charity. The band plays at fundraising events for Devon Air Ambulance, Help for Heroes and other events, as well at police occasions such as officer graduations.

The band is made up of officers and employees of Devon and Cornwall Police, as well as some members who are not related to the police. The band is not funded or related to the police force but do have permission to use their name and uniform.

===Devon and Cornwall Police Rugby Football Club===

The Devon and Cornwall RFC was formed in 1967 following the amalgamation of the Devon, Cornwall and Plymouth Constabularies clubs. A few midweek and Sunday games were played and players were encouraged to play for club sides on Saturdays. However the Saturday team was disbanded in May 1995 due to operational commitments. Today the force still manages to bring together a team when necessary, and play in the National Cup Competition every year.

===Social media===
In 2015, BBC News Online reported that the force had been involved in a number of social media &quot;blunders&quot;, including officers making inappropriate use of Facebook and Twitter, and a Twitter campaign image that had to be withdrawn when it was pointed out that it appeared to depict a police riot officer beating a person lying on the ground with a truncheon.

===Stella the dog===
Stella was a dog that was seized in 2014. Devon and Cornwall Police said the pit bull-type dog was considered potentially dangerous. The department put the dog in a 3 ft by 9 ft cage in Devon until 2016 when a destruction order for Stella was passed by Torquay Magistrates&#x27; Court. The dog was reported to have not had exercise and was left in the cage for 24 hours a day for nearly two years. The courts had until 8 March 2016 to appeal the euthanasia of Stella. Sgt Allan Knight, from the Devon and Cornwall Police dog handling unit, said: &quot;There will always be some dogs who cannot get walked by staff because of the danger they possess. We are bound by the court process.&quot;

===Sensory learning tool initiative===
Sensory library boards designed to help people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or sensory issues have been introduced to help neurodivergent student police officers training in classroom environments by the Devon and Cornwall Police force. 

== Deaths following Devon and Cornwall Police contact==
There have been a number of deaths of members of the public who have come into contact with Devon and Cornwall Police.

*Thomas Orchard, 32, was arrested and taken to a police station in Exeter, where he was restrained, in October 2012. He died in hospital seven days later.
*Marc Cole, 30, died in Falmouth, Cornwall, in May 2017 after a taser was deployed for 42 seconds, resulting in a cardiac arrest. He had taken cocaine the same day. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) concluded that the performance of its officers was not below standard.
*Andrew Pimlott, 32, died from burns in April 2013. Pimlott, who had drenched himself in fuel, was tasered, which ignited the fuel and caused his burns.
*Leslie (&quot;Les&quot;) Douthwaite, 38, died in April 2015 after being restrained, face down, by police.
*John Coysh, 35, died in police custody in September 2016, from cardiac arrhythmia during alcohol withdrawal.
*Simeon Francis, 35, died in a cell in Torquay police station on 20 May 2020 after being arrested in Exeter. Simeon died of epilepsy, and a subsequent investigation concluded that he was not discriminated against, and there was no case to answer against the force in relation to his death.

==Statistics ==
The force receives 500 to 800 emergency 999 calls, 
plus 2,000 to 2,500 non-emergency 101 calls every day.
In the year ending January 2016, the force dealt with 5,151 missing person reports. Firearms officers were deployed on 351 occasions in the year ending March 2020.

<doc id="1234326" wikidata="Q15334" url="?curid=1234326" title="Gmina">
<text>The gmina ( , plural &quot;gminy&quot; ) is the basic unit of the administrative division of Poland, similar to a municipality. , there were 2,477 gminy throughout the country, encompassing over 43,000 villages. 940 gminy include cities and towns, with 322 among them constituting an independent urban gmina () consisting solely of a standalone town or one of the 107 cities, the latter governed by a city mayor (&quot;prezydent miasta&quot;).

The gmina has been the basic unit of territorial division in Poland since 1974, when it replaced the smaller gromada (cluster). Three or more gminy make up a higher level unit called a powiat, except for those holding the status of a city with powiat rights. Each and every powiat has the seat in a city or town, in the latter case either an urban gmina or a part of an urban-rural one.

==Types==
There are three types of gmina:
#302 urban gmina () constituted either by a standalone town or one of the 107 cities, the latter governed by a city mayor (prezydent miasta), including 66 cities with powiat rights
#638 mixed urban-rural gmina () consisting of a town and surrounding villages and countryside; other than Gmina Nowe Skalmierzyce, seat of an urban-rural gmina is almost always located in the town
#1,537 rural gmina () consisting only of villages and countryside (occasionally of just one village).

Some rural gminy have their seat in a town which itself is outside of the gmina&#x27;s territory. For example, the rural Gmina Augustów is administered from the town of Augustów, but does not include the town, as Augustów is an urban type gmina in its own right.

One hundred and seven urban gminy constitute cities, distinguished from towns through being governed by a city mayor (&quot;prezydent miasta&quot;) instead of a town mayor (burmistrz), the status awarded automatically to all urban gminy over 100,000 inhabitants or those with a status of a city with powiat rights, with some others allowed to retain the earlier awarded title due to historical reasons. 66 among the 107 cities (including all voivodeship seats and all cities over 100,000 inhabitants) have the special status of city with powiat rights (miasto na prawach powiatu). Such a city exercises also powers and duties of a powiat while not belonging to any; nevertheless, it may still be a seat of a regular powiat, albeit without belonging to it administratively (such powiat thus being often &quot;doughnut-shaped&quot;). In such cities, the roles of the powiat organs are fulfilled by the ones of the urban gmina.

&quot;For a complete listing of all the gminy in Poland, see List of Polish gminas.&quot;

==Government==
Polish gminy operate under a mayor-council government. 

The legislative and oversight body of each gmina is the elected municipal council (&quot;rada gminy&quot;), in an urban-rural gmina called the town and gmina council (&quot;rada miasta i gminy&quot;), while in an urban gmina it is called the town/city council (&quot;rada miasta&quot;). 

Any local laws considered non-compliant with the national ones may be invalidated by the respective voivode, whose rulings may be appealed to an administrative court. Decisions in individual cases may in turn be appealed to quasi-judicial bodies named , their ruling subject to appeal to an administrative court. 

Executive power is held in the municipality by a directly elected official, called &quot;wójt&quot; in rural gminy, a town mayor (&quot;burmistrz&quot;) in urban-rural and most urban gminy which contain towns, or a city mayor (&quot;prezydent miasta&quot;) in the 107 urban gminy containing cities, the status awarded automatically to all urban gminy over 100,000 inhabitants or those with a status of a city with powiat rights, with some others allowed to retain the earlier awarded title due to historical reasons. A town or city mayor may be scrutinized or denied funding for his/her projects by the council, but is not politically responsible to it and does not require its confidence to remain in office; therefore, cohabitation is not uncommon. 

In a city with powiat rights, the city mayor additionally has the powers and duties of a powiat executive board and a starosta, while the city council has the powers and duties of a powiat (county) council; both nevertheless being elected under the municipal election rules rather than those applicable to county elections.

A recall referendum may be triggered either in respect to the wójt/town mayor/city mayor or to the municipal council through a petition supported by at least 1/10 of eligible voters, but the turnout in the recall referendum must be at least 3/5 of the number of people voting in the original election in order for the referendum to be valid and binding. In addition, elected bodies of any municipality may be suspended by the prime minister of Poland in case of persisting law transgressions or negligence, resulting in such case in the municipality being placed under receivership.

A gmina may create auxiliary units (&quot;jednostki pomocnicze&quot;), which play a subordinate administrative role. In rural areas these are called sołectwa, in towns they may be dzielnice or osiedla and in an urban-rural gmina, the town itself may be designated as an auxiliary unit. The only gmina which is statutorily obliged to have auxiliary units is Warsaw, which is divided since 2002 into 18 boroughs exercising some devolved powers, though not considered separate entities.

==Administrative tasks and objectives==
Each gmina carries out two classes of tasks:
* own tasks – public tasks exercised by gmina as its inherent exclusive competence and financed by its own means, which serve to satisfy the needs of the community. 
* commissioned tasks – tasks of the central government, delegated entirely or partially to gminas, along with an appropriate mandatory government subvention to support them

The tasks can be also divided into another two categories:
* compulsory – where the municipality cannot abstain from carrying out the tasks, and must set up a budget to carry them out in order to provide the inhabitants with the basic public benefits
* optional – where the municipality can carry them out in accordance with available budgetary means, set out only to specific local needs (on the gmina&#x27;s own responsibility and budget).

=== Own tasks ===
Own tasks include matters such as spatial harmony, real estate management, environmental protection and nature conservation, water management, country roads, public streets, bridges, squares and traffic systems, water supply systems and source, the sewage system, removal of urban waste, water treatment, maintenance of cleanliness and order, sanitary facilities, dumps and council waste, supply of electric and thermal energy and gas, public transport, health care, welfare, care homes, subsidised housing, public education, cultural facilities including public libraries and other cultural institutions, historic monuments conservation and protection, the sports facilities and tourism including recreational grounds and devices, marketplaces and covered markets, green spaces and public parks, communal graveyards, public order and safety, fire and flood protection with equipment maintenance and storage, maintaining objects and devices of the public utility and administrative buildings, pro-family policy including social support for pregnant women, medical and legal care, supporting and popularising the self-government initiatives and cooperation within the commune including with non-governmental organizations, interaction with regional communities from other countries, etc.

=== Commissioned tasks ===
Commissioned tasks cover the remaining public tasks resulting from legitimate needs of the state, commissioned by central government for the units of local government to implement. The tasks are handed over on the basis of statutory by-laws, charters and regulations, or by way of agreements between the self-government units and central-government administration.

<doc id="1234327" wikidata="Q5287620" url="?curid=1234327" title="Document-term matrix">
<text>A document-term matrix is a mathematical matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur in each document in a collection. In a document-term matrix, rows correspond to documents in the collection and columns correspond to terms. This matrix is a specific instance of a document-feature matrix where &quot;features&quot; may refer to other properties of a document besides terms. It is also common to encounter the transpose, or term-document matrix where documents are the columns and terms are the rows. They are useful in the field of natural language processing and computational text analysis.

While the value of the cells is commonly the raw count of a given term, there are various schemes for weighting the raw counts such as row normalizing (i.e. relative frequency/proportions) and tf-idf.

Terms are commonly single words separated by whitespace or punctuation on either side (a.k.a. unigrams). In such a case, this is also referred to as &quot;bag of words&quot; representation because the counts of individual words is retained, but not the order of the words in the document.

==General concept==
When creating a data-set of terms that appear in a corpus of documents, the document-term matrix contains rows corresponding to the documents and columns corresponding to the terms. Each &quot;ij&quot; cell, then, is the number of times word &quot;j&quot; occurs in document &quot;i&quot;. As such, each row is a vector of term counts that represents the content of the document corresponding to that row. For instance if one has the following two (short) documents:
*D1 = &quot;I like databases&quot;
*D2 = &quot;I dislike databases&quot;,
then the document-term matrix would be:

which shows which documents contain which terms and how many times they appear. Note that, unlike representing a document as just a token-count list, the document-term matrix includes all terms in the corpus (i.e. the corpus vocabulary), which is why there are zero-counts for terms in the corpus which do not also occur in a specific document. For this reason, document-term matrices are usually stored in a sparse matrix format.

As a result of the power-law distribution of tokens in nearly every corpus (see Zipf&#x27;s law), it is common to weight the counts. This can be as simple as dividing counts by the total number of tokens in a document (called relative frequency or proportions), dividing by the maximum frequency in each document (called prop max), or taking the log of frequencies (called log count). If one desires to weight the words most unique to an individual document as compared to the corpus as a whole, it is common to use tf-idf, which divides the term frequency by the term&#x27;s document frequency.

== History of the concept ==
The document-term matrix emerged in the earliest years of the computerization of text. The increasing capacity for storing documents created the problem of retrieving a given document in an efficient manner. While previously the work of classifying and indexing was accomplished by hand, researchers explored the possibility of doing this automatically using word frequency information.

One of the first published document-term matrices was in Harold Borko&#x27;s 1962 article &quot;The construction of an empirically based mathematically derived classification system&quot; (page 282, see also his 1965 article). Borko references two computer programs, &quot;FEAT&quot; which stood for &quot;Frequency of Every Allowable Term,&quot; written by John C. Olney of the System Development Corporation and the Descriptor Word Index Program, written by Eileen Stone also of the System Development Corporation: Having selected the documents which were to make up the experimental library, the next step consisted of keypunching the entire body of text preparatory to computer processing.  The program used for this analysis was FEAT (Frequency of Every Allowable Term).  it was written by John C. Olney of the System Development Corporation and is designed to perform frequency and summary counts of individual words and of word pairs.  The  output of this program is an alphabetical listing, by frequency of occurrence, of all word types which appeared in the text.  Certain function words such as and, the,  at, a, etc., were placed in a &quot;forbidden word list&quot; table, and the frequency of these words was recorded  in a separate listing... A special computer program, called the Descriptor Word Index Program, was written to provide this information and to prepare a document-term matrix in a form suitable for in-put to the Factor Analysis Program. The Descriptor Word Index program was prepared by Eileen Stone of the System Development Corporation.Shortly thereafter, Gerard Salton published &quot;Some hierarchical models for automatic document retrieval&quot; in 1963 which also included a visual depiction of a document-term matrix. Salton was at Harvard University at the time and his work was supported by the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories and Sylvania Electric Products, Inc. In this paper, Salton introduces the document-term matrix by comparison to a kind of term-context matrix used to measure similarities between words:If it is desired to generate document associations or document clusters instead of word associations, the same procedures can be used with slight modifications. Instead of starting with a word-sentence matrix &quot;C&quot;... it is now convenient to construct a word-document matrix &quot;F,&quot; listing frequency of occurrence of word Wi in Document Dj... Document similarities can now be computed as before by comparing pairs of rows and by obtaining similarity coefficients based on the frequency of co-occurrences of the content words included in the given document. This procedure produces a document-document similarity matrix which can in turn be used for the generation of document clusters...In addition to Borko and Salton, in 1964, F.W. Lancaster published a comprehensive review of automated indexing and retrieval. While the work was published while he worked at the Herner and Company in Washington D.C., the paper was written while he was &quot;employed in research work at Aslib, on the Aslib Cranfield Project.&quot; Lancaster credits Borko with the document-term matrix:Harold Borko, of the System Development Corporation, has carried this operation a little further. A significant group of clue words is chosen from the vocabulary of an experimental collection. These are arranged in a document/term matrix to show the frequency of occurrence of each term in each document... A correlation coefficient for each word pair is then computed, based on their co-occurrence in the document set. The resulting term/term matrix... is then factor analysed and a series of factors are isolated. These factors, when interpreted and named on the basis of the terms with high loadings which appear in each of the factors, become the classes of an empirical classification. The terms with high loadings in each factor are the clue words or predictors of the categories. 

==Choice of terms==
A point of view on the matrix is that each row represents a document. In the vectorial semantic model, which is normally the one used to compute a document-term matrix, the goal is to represent the topic of a document by the frequency of semantically significant terms. The terms are semantic units of the documents. It is often assumed, for Indo-European languages, that nouns, verbs and adjectives are the more significant categories, and that words from those categories should be kept as terms.
Adding collocation as terms improves the quality of the vectors, especially when computing similarities between documents.

==Applications==
===Improving search results===
Latent semantic analysis (LSA, performing singular-value decomposition on the document-term matrix) can improve search results by disambiguating polysemous words and searching for synonyms of the query. However, searching in the high-dimensional continuous space is much slower than searching the standard trie data structure of search engines.

===Finding topics===
Multivariate analysis of the document-term matrix can reveal topics/themes of the corpus. Specifically, latent semantic analysis and data clustering can be used, and, more recently, probabilistic latent semantic analysis with its generalization Latent Dirichlet allocation, and non-negative matrix factorization, have been found to perform well for this task.

<text>Craig Patrick (born May 20, 1946) is an American former hockey player, coach and general manager, the son of Lynn Patrick and the grandson of Lester Patrick. During the 1980 Winter Olympics, Patrick was the Assistant General Manager and Assistant Coach under Herb Brooks for the United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team, which won the gold medal and defeated the Soviet Union in the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;. From 1989 to 2006, Patrick was the General Manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins where he oversaw back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992, as well as the drafting and signing of some players that would later win a Stanley Cup title for the Penguins in 2009.

==Amateur career==
After spending most of his childhood in Wellesley, Massachusetts, he was sent at age fourteen to Quebec to play junior hockey in the Metropolitan Junior Hockey League for the Lachine Maroons and later the Montreal Junior Canadiens.

He attended the University of Denver where he helped guide the Pioneers hockey team to the NCAA championship in 1968 and 1969. He played on the US National Team for 1969–70 and 1970–71 seasons, including the 1970 and 1971 Ice Hockey World Championship tournaments while serving in the US Army.

==Career as a professional player==
Patrick&#x27;s pro career was comparatively modest but he did play eight seasons in NHL with the California Golden Seals, the St. Louis Blues, the Kansas City Scouts, and the Washington Capitals. He also played briefly for the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the World Hockey Association in 1976–77 before jumping back to the NHL when the Saints folded. He amassed 72 goals, 91 assists, and 163 points in 401 NHL games during his playing career. He also was a member of Team USA at the inaugural 1976 Canada Cup tournament and also played for the U.S. at the 1979 Ice Hockey World Championship tournament in Moscow, shortly before retiring from professional hockey.

== The Miracle on Ice ==
Patrick served as assistant general manager and assistant coach under Herb Brooks for the 1980 US Olympic Gold Medal-winning hockey team, the &quot;Miracle on Ice.&quot;

Patrick was also the general manager for the 2002 US Olympic team, also coached by Brooks, which won the silver medal – the first US hockey medal since the 1980 team. This tournament was further notable as it was largely the same roster that underperformed in the 1998 Olympics, yet aging players like Mike Richter and Phil Housley performed well beyond expectations and were named to the 2002 tournament all-star team.

During both Olympic tournaments, the Team USA defeated the Soviets/Russians. Interestingly, both games were played on Friday, February 22, in their respective years, with a one-goal victory for Team USA. Team USA would also play for the gold medal on Sunday, February 24, but would lose to Canada in 2002.

== NHL management and beyond ==
In 1980, he became director of operations for the New York Rangers and in 1981 became the youngest general manager in Rangers history. He also served as head coach of the Rangers for parts of two seasons (1980–81 and 1984–85).

He was named general manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins on December 5, 1989. During his tenure, the Penguins won two Stanley Cup championships, one President&#x27;s Trophy, and five division titles. Patrick also served as head coach of the Penguins twice, during the 1989–90 and 1996–97 seasons.

His early years as GM of the Penguins are remembered as some of the most productive in the history of the franchise. In 1990, he spent his first round draft pick on Czechoslovakian forward Jaromir Jagr. He traded the Penguins&#x27; second round pick that year to Calgary for Joe Mullen, a player the Flames had considered to be over the hill. Perhaps his most legendary trade occurred March 4, 1991, when he sent John Cullen, Jeff Parker and Zarley Zalapski to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for Ron Francis, Ulf Samuelsson and Grant Jennings. The move was viewed as a huge gamble. Cullen was the fifth leading scorer in the NHL at the time. However, the players Patrick acquired in the trade played big roles in the Penguins&#x27; Stanley Cup championship victories in 1991 and 1992.

===Later years as GM===
The Penguins also reached the conference finals in 1996 and 2001.

However his later years were plagued by the Penguins&#x27; financial woes as well as a series of poor trades.

Perhaps his most infamous trades came in March 1996 when he sent future NHL scoring ace Markus Näslund to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for Alek Stojanov, a role player with just two career NHL goals; a 2003 Sports Illustrated article described this as the &quot;worst trade in NHL history&quot;. Then, in an effort to appease then player and captain Mario Lemieux, Patrick traded top scoring defenseman Sergei Zubov to the Dallas Stars for Kevin Hatcher, a slower moving and older version of Zubov with less upside at that point in their careers.

In July 2001, Patrick sent Jagr and role player Frantisek Kucera to the Washington Capitals for three minor league prospects (Kris Beech, Michal Sivek, Ross Lupaschuk) and nearly US$5 million cash. The deal was forced by the Penguins financial woes (indeed this saved the club much money as Jagr would fail to live up to expectations with the Capitals), as well as Jagr&#x27;s growing dissatisfaction with the Penguins. The trade was nonetheless widely criticized in the Pittsburgh media, as the three prospects acquired in the deal never made any significant contribution to the Penguins&#x27; organization. Another reason for this criticism was that the New York Rangers allegedly were willing to make a deal which would have given Pittsburgh two established players and higher quality prospects. However, many believed Patrick resented the Rangers for firing him earlier in his GM career, which made him ask for a greater and to an extent unfair return. One published report had Patrick demanding Petr Nedvěd, Radek Dvořák and Mike York, as well as two prospects for Jágr, which Rangers GM Glen Sather quickly shot down as Patrick&#x27;s demands were unreasonable.

From the 2001–02 season onwards, Penguins missed the playoffs in the next four seasons of Patrick&#x27;s term as General Manager.

After the 2004–05 lockout, in the 2005 off-season, Patrick drafted teen phenomenon Sidney Crosby with the first overall pick. Patrick also acquired veterans Ziggy Palffy, Sergei Gonchar, John LeClair and Mark Recchi. While 18-year-old Crosby became the youngest player in NHL history to score 100 points, the older free agents had little to show for the millions that Patrick spent on them (though Gonchar would remain a key player in 2008–09). The Penguins finished last in the Atlantic Division for the fourth consecutive time. After 17 years as Penguins General Manager, Patrick was relieved of his duties on April 20, 2006, when his expiring contract was not renewed by team president Ken Sawyer. Succeeding GM Ray Shero praised Patrick&#x27;s selection of Marc-André Fleury, Crosby, and Evgeni Malkin, but also said that work had to be done to build up the depth and third/fourth lines for the long-term, rather than a quick-fix.

Patrick was initially bitter about his firing and stayed away from hockey-related activities for a while afterwards. The Penguins returned to the postseason in 2007, with Crosby being named regular season MVP and winning the scoring title, though they lost in five games to eventual finalists, the Ottawa Senators.

In 2008, Patrick accepted an invitation from owner Mario Lemieux to watch the game in the owners box where the Penguins defeated the Philadelphia Flyers to take the Eastern Conference championship. Patrick&#x27;s later draft picks, Marc-Andre Fleury, Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby were credited with the team&#x27;s advance to the Stanley Cup Finals that year, where they lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. In 2009, these players had instrumental roles in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Stanley Cup win.

===Draft history===
His tenure as GM also saw a hit and miss record in the NHL Entry Draft. Sparkling first round picks early in his tenure such as Jagr, Martin Straka and Naslund were balanced by later first round busts such as Chris Wells, Robert Dome, Craig Hillier, Milan Kraft and Stefan Bergkvist. Productive drafts in the early 2000s produced young talent such as Marc-André Fleury, Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby, but could not reverse the growing opinion in the public or among team management that Patrick had lost his touch.

== Patrick family history ==

Multiple members of the Patrick family have won the Stanley Cup.

Lester (Craig&#x27;s grandfather) with Montreal Wanderers 1906, 1907 (player), Victoria Cougars 1925 (president/manager-coach), New York Rangers 1928 (playing manager-coach), 1933 (manager-coach), 1940 (manager)

Frank (Craig&#x27;s grand uncle) – Vancouver Millionaires 1915 (playing president/manager-coach),

Lynn (Craig&#x27;s father) – New York Rangers 1940 (player)

Murray (Craig&#x27;s uncle) – New York Rangers 1940 (player)

Craig Patrick – Pittsburgh Penguins 1991, 1992 (general manager)

Chris Patrick (Craig&#x27;s cousin, grandson of Murray) - Washington Capitals 2018 (director of player personnel)

Dick Patrick (Craig&#x27;s cousin, son of Murray) - Washington Capitals 2018 (president)

Other family members:

Glenn (Craig&#x27;s brother) – never won the Stanley Cup.

Curtiss (Craig&#x27;s nephew) – minor league hockey player in the AHL and ECHL.

== Other ==
Patrick was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Executive-of-the-Year in 1998 and 1999. He is the third generation of his family to have his name inscribed on the Stanley Cup and the third generation to be enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame (in the Builder Category). Patrick spent two years as athletic director at the University of Denver (his alma mater) in 1988–1989. He was enshrined into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996. He was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy, named for his grandfather, in the 1999–2000 season for his outstanding service to hockey in the United States.

In December 2011, the Columbus Blue Jackets hired Patrick as a senior advisor to Hockey Operations.

On January 9, 2014, the Buffalo Sabres hired Patrick as a Special Advisor in the Hockey Operations Department.

Patrick returned to the Pittsburgh Penguins on November 19, 2018, joining the front office as a professional scout.

In 2020, Patrick joined 3ICE, a professional 3-on-3 ice hockey league, as the league&#x27;s commissioner. In 2023, Patrick also became a head coach for his own team in the league, while still serving as commissioner.

<text>Flag throwing (color guard) is an art and sport mixed all into one. Flag throwing tends to coordinate with marching bands all throughout the world. It has become a competitive art that takes place in schools all over the world.

==History==
The art of flag throwing dates back to medieval guilds (principally in Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Flanders, and Southern Netherlands). A guild&#x27;s banner or flag was considered a symbol of purity, and as such it was not allowed to touch the ground.

==Types==
There are two major categories of flag throwing: classical and acrobatic. In classical flag throwing, the flag is turned left and right around the body in a standing posture. In acrobatic flag throwing, the thrower uses both hands to move the flag in a sitting, lying, or kneeling posture.

<doc id="1234347" wikidata="Q6901572" url="?curid=1234347" title="Monofilament fishing line">
<text>Monofilament fishing line (shortened to just mono) is fishing line made from a single fiber of plastic material, as opposed to multifilament or braided fishing lines constructed from multiple strands of fibers. Most fishing lines are now nylon monofilament because they are cheap to manufacture and can be produced in a range of diameters which have different tensile strengths (called &quot;tests&quot; after the process of tensile testing, or possibly as a portmanteau of &quot;tensile&quot; and &quot;strength&quot;). Monofilament line is also available in different colors, such as clear, white, green, blue, red, and fluorescent.

Monofilament is made by melting and mixing polymers and then extruding the mixture through tiny holes, forming strands of line, which is then spun into spools of various thicknesses. The extrusion process controls not only the thickness of the line but its test as well.

== History ==
DuPont made public in 1938 that their company had invented nylon. This new invention was the first synthetic fiber, fabrics that are commonly used in textiles today. In 1939, DuPont began marketing nylon monofilament fishing lines; however, braided Dacron lines remained the most used and popular fishing line for the next two decades, as early monofilament line was very stiff or &quot;wiry&quot;, and difficult to handle and cast. Early monofilament did, however, have good knot strength and very low visibility to the fish, creating a small loyal following among fishermen. In 1959 DuPont introduced Stren, a thinner and much softer monofilament line that could be used in a large range of reels, including newly introduced spinning and spin casting tackle. Stren&#x27;s monofilament lines soon became a favorite with many fishermen because of its overall ease of use and it spawned a whole host of imitators.

New materials, e.g., Spectra or Dyneema, are finding growing usage as fishing lines. Polyvinylidene fluoride (also sold as fluorocarbon or PVDF) is very much like nylon monofilament, but has several advantages. Optical density is lower, which makes the line less easily discernible. The surface is harder so it is more resistant to sharp fish teeth and wear. Furthermore, PVDF does not take up water and it is resistant to UV-light. It is denser than nylon, too, which makes it sink faster.

Dyneema is also becoming very popular and it is much stronger, but it is used mostly as a braided fishing line. Because the elastic stretching is only a fraction of that of nylon monofilament, the contact with fish or bait is more direct. It is often used for deep water fishing from boats because lower diameters are used, which give less resistance to currents, and the low stretch makes bites easily detectable.

== Specialty lines ==
=== Fluorocarbon line ===
Some modern monofilament lines are made from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a fluoropolymer often marketed as fluorocarbon. Fluorocarbon lines or &quot;fluoro lines&quot; are valued for their similar refractive index to that of water, making it less visible to fish, which may not swallow the bait if it sees the line. Fluorocarbon lines have greater surface hardness than nylon lines and are more abrasion-resistant against underwater rocks and snags, yet are more shock-resilient than braided lines when fighting fish, thus making them ideal to use as leader lines especially when the mainline is braided. They also have less memory, stretch and moisture expansion than nylon lines, making it easier to keep the line taut and transmit vibrations, which is essential in lure fishing where the angler is very reliant on tactile sensitivity. PVDF is also a denser material and therefore not nearly as buoyant as nylon monofilament, and anglers often utilize fluorocarbon lines when they need lighter baits/lures to sink more quickly and stay deeper below the surface without using heavy sinkers.

=== Copolymer line ===
A newer type of modern monofilament lines are composite lines that are fused from at least two different substrates via a process known as copolymerization. Most copolymer lines are nylon-based polymer blends fusing a blend of nylon with another higher-density one, although recently &quot;tripolymer&quot; lines that fuse three different blends of nylon have also appeared on the market. Compared to conventional single-blend (&quot;plain&quot;) monofilament lines, copolymer lines have much higher test weight (strength) especially for small diameters, have less stretch, and are more abrasion-resistant. They are stronger than fluorocarbon lines per diameter but also less rigid, which makes them more shock-resilient and knot-friendly, although also more susceptible to wind-knotting (random entanglement of loose line loops). Like plain monofilament lines, copolymer lines tend to sink slowly in water, and are better suited for lure fishing near the surface (e.g. dry fly fishing).

Some copolymer lines are additionally coated with fluoropolymer (trademarked as &quot;FluoroKote&quot;) to give more fluorocarbon-like surface property and to change the refractive index, as well as to also allow faster sinking as the added fluoropolymers are generally denser than nylon.

==Use==

Monofilament fishing line is used in a huge variety of fishing applications.

Monofilament is not advisable for deepwater fishing, since it can absorb water, resulting in loose knots, and its sensitivity can decrease when it is wet. Monofilament degrades with time and can weaken when exposed to heat, sunlight, and/or saltwater. When stored on a spool for a long time, it may come off the fishing reel in coils or loops. It is advisable to change the monofilament line at regular intervals to prevent degradation.

=== Non-fishing uses ===
Monofilament fishing line is sometimes used in medicine as a pricking tool to examine the dermatomal fine touch.

The transparency of monofilament fishing line makes it desirable for special effects where objects need to look like they are floating unsupported.

It has also been used for string trimmers, musical instrument strings, sewing thread and bent in the shape of a staple for use as a septum piercing retainer.

== Environmental impact ==

Discarded monofilament lines can present serious environmental problems. These lines are extremely difficult to spot when submerged in water, and fish, birds, and other marine life can easily become entangled, causing starvation, amputation, and death. Ingestion is also a serious threat to wildlife. Monofilament lines also present a risk to swimmers and scuba divers. The breakdown of lines, especially in string trimmers, leads to microplastics which may cause starvation or poisoning of organisms in soil or water.

For these reasons, programs have been started to recycle fishing line, to keep it out of the environment. Specialized containers have been designed to collect fishing line for recycling.

<doc id="1234348" wikidata="Q338557" url="?curid=1234348" title="Dundalk F.C.">
<text>Dundalk Football Club ( ; ) is a professional football club that competes in the League of Ireland First Division. It was founded in 1903 as Dundalk G.N.R., the works-team of the Great Northern Railway. It is based in Dundalk, County Louth and its home ground is Oriel Park. The club crest is three martlets on a shield, which was adopted from the town&#x27;s old coat of arms. The team&#x27;s traditional kit colours are white shirts, black shorts, and white or black socks.

Dundalk were a junior club until they were invited to join the Leinster Senior League in 1922–23. After playing at that level for four seasons, they were elected to the League of Ireland for the 1926–27 season. Six seasons later, they became the first club from outside Dublin to win the league title. As of 2024, they have won 49 trophies at national and all-Ireland level, including 14 League titles and 12 FAI Cups, with four League and Cup &#x27;Doubles&#x27;, and they are the only club to have won a league title or an FAI Cup in every decade since the 1930s.

They made their European debut in the 1963–64 European Cup and became the first Irish side to win an away match in Europe in that campaign. Their best performance in the European Cup was in 1979–80, when they reached the last 16, and they reached the last 16 of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1981–82. They are the only Irish club to have qualified more than once for the Europa League group stage and, in 2016–17, they became the first team from Ireland to both win points and win a match at that level of European competition. They remain the only Irish team to have won points in the Europa League group stage as of the 2024–25 European season.

==History==

===Dundalk G.N.R. (1903–1930)===

The Dundalk Great Northern Railway (G.N.R.) Football Club was established during the 1883–84 season as a rugby football club. They played their final rugby match in February 1903, and in September 1903 the club switched codes to association football, setting in motion their journey to become the modern-day Dundalk F.C. The new club, known locally as &quot;the Railwaymen&quot;, adopted the Dundalk Athletic Grounds (a facility near the town centre shared by several sporting codes) as its home ground. They played challenge matches at first, then became founder members of the first Dundalk and District League (DDL), formed in 1906. There are no records of the club being active between 1907–08 and 1912–13, but they re-joined the local league in 1913–14 for what was the final season before the outbreak of World War I.

The local league was dormant during the war, but the G.N.R. club entered both the Irish Junior Cup and Leinster Junior Cup competitions during the war years. After exiting the Irish Junior Cup in January 1917, the club was inactive again for the following two seasons. It re-formed for 1919–20, affiliated with the Leinster Football Association, and joined both the Newry and District League and the revived DDL. The G.N.R. club spent three seasons in the DDL, winning it twice, and represented the district in both Junior Cup competitions those seasons. They reached the Leinster Junior Cup final in 1920 (the club&#x27;s first cup final), which they lost to Avonmore after two replays.

Their junior record led to them being elected to the Leinster Senior League for 1922–23, to replace sides that had been promoted to the nascent Free State League. They spent four seasons at that level, before being elected to the Free State League on 15 June 1926 to replace Dublin club Pioneers as the national league looked to spread to the provinces.

On 21 August 1926, they travelled to Cork to face Fordsons for their league debut, eventually finishing eighth in the 1926–27 season. The team represented the G.N.R. works in name only by this stage, and the club&#x27;s management committee decided to make it independent of the company. New colours of white shirts and blue shorts with a crest of the town&#x27;s coat of arms were adopted in December 1927. They contested their first cup final as a senior club in April 1929, the Leinster Senior Cup final, which they lost after a replay. It was the last time that the club was billed to appear as &#x27;Dundalk G.N.R.&#x27;, and the name of the club was formally changed to &#x27;Dundalk A.F.C.&#x27; in the summer of 1930.

When Dundalk G.N.R. joined the League of Ireland in 1926, it was one of four works-teams in the 10-team league—the others being Jacobs, St. James&#x27;s Gate and Fordsons. Another railway works-team—Midland Athletic of the Midland Great Western Railway—had competed for two seasons but had resigned when the company went through a merger. By 1944–45, Dundalk were the only club with works-team roots remaining. Another works-team, Transport (sponsored by CIÉ), joined in 1948–49 but were not re-elected for 1962–63, leaving Dundalk again as the only surviving club with works-team roots. The works themselves became &quot;Dundalk Engineering Works Ltd&quot; with the demise of the G.N.R.(I) company in 1958.

===First successes (1930–1949)===
With a new manager, Steve Wright, Dundalk finished as runners-up in both the League and the FAI Cup in 1930–31. Proof that they could compete at a national level gave the management committee the confidence to form a membership-based limited company, &#x27;Dundalk A.F.C. Limited&#x27;, in January 1932. In the 1932–33 season, they became the first team from outside Dublin to win a league title, sealing it in Dalymount Park with their first victory over Bohemians. In becoming champions, they also became the first team from outside Dublin or Belfast to win a league title in Ireland since the inception of the original Irish League in 1890. Hoping to improve revenue, the club decided to move from the Athletic Grounds. In 1936, the committee secured land on the Carrick Road owned by P.J. Casey (a former committee member) on a long-term lease, and named it &#x27;Oriel Park&#x27;.

After winning the league title, they were runners-up eight times across the five main competitions (League, Shield, FAI Cup, Dublin City Cup and Leinster Senior Cup), before winning the 1937–38 City Cup, which was their first cup final victory. They won their first FAI Cup (in their fourth appearance in the fina) with victory over Cork United in Dalymount Park in 1942. Five weeks later, they won the inaugural Dublin and Belfast Inter-City Cup to become (unofficially) &#x27;Champions of All Ireland&#x27;. The following September, in the new season, the City Cup was won for a second time.

During the mid-1940s, the management committee relied on player sales to English clubs to bankroll the club, as gate receipts alone did not meet its running costs. After missing out in both the League and the City Cup by a point in 1947–48, the committee decided to invest the surplus from its transfer dealings on several professional players from Scotland and a player-coach, Ned Weir. The investment paid off when the City Cup was won for a third time at the start of the new season by topping its new league format unbeaten, while the club&#x27;s second FAI Cup was won with victory over Shelbourne in the 1949 final. But the new team fell short in both the Shield and the League and, despite the cup double and improved gate receipts, the additional income was not enough to cover the increase in costs.

===Struggles and recovery (1950–1964)===
The attempt to maintain a full-time squad had not paid off and the 1949 cup-winning team was broken up. A surplus from transfer dealings prevented a more serious financial crisis arising, and despite the turnover in players, Dundalk won the Leinster Senior Cup for the first time in 1950–51. The cutbacks started to have an impact, and they finished second from bottom in the league table the following season. They went on a memorable FAI Cup run, however, coming from 3–1 down against Waterford in a semi-final replay to win 6–4 in extra time; then defeated Cork Athletic in the 1952 FAI Cup final (also in a replay), to win the Cup for a third time.

Midway through the 1952–53 season, Club Secretary Sam Prole left to take over at Drumcondra. Prole, a Great Northern Railway employee, had played for Dundalk G.N.R. in junior football, and had been Secretary for 25 years. He had been responsible for the club&#x27;s transfer activities, and player sales tailed off after his departure. The subsequent drop in income obliged the club to cut costs, and they finished bottom of the league in the two seasons after he left. They continued to struggle for the rest of the decade but, in contrast to their league form, they won their fourth FAI Cup with a 1–0 victory over Shamrock Rovers in the 1958 final.

Having not challenged for the League or Shield during the 1950s, they ended the decade at the top of the league table, with new signing Jimmy Hasty, the &#x27;one-armed wonder&#x27;, starring for the side. Although they subsequently fell short of winning the title, the club was competitive again. A second Leinster Senior Cup was won in 1960–61, and a first league title in 30 years followed in 1962–63. That success meant that Dundalk entered European competition for the first time, where they became the first Irish side to win an away leg of a European tie by beating FC Zurich, 2–1 (in a 4–2 aggregate defeat), in the 1963–64 European Cup. They could not manage to retain the title that season, finishing as runners-up, and they were also runners-up in the Shield. But they did win the season-end Top Four Cup for the first time.

===Takeover, rise and fall (1964–1974)===
A poor 1964–65 followed, and the club&#x27;s management committee decided that it was time to hire a modern-style manager, who would have sole responsibility for recruitment and player selection. They appointed Gerry Doyle, who had spent most of his career as both a player and a coach with Shelbourne. The new season saw little improvement, however, and with financial losses growing and investment in Oriel Park needed, it became clear early in the 1965–66 season that the membership-based ownership model could not provide the financial support required to take the club forward. A new public limited company took over in January 1966, after the voluntary liquidation of the old company.

The new board invested heavily in both Oriel Park and the squad ahead of the 1966–67 season, and signed a new player-coach, Alan Fox, from Bradford City. The pay-off was immediate. Dundalk finally won their first League of Ireland Shield, then charged to the league title, winning it by seven points, to seal the club&#x27;s only League and Shield Double. They then won that season&#x27;s Top Four Cup to complete the club&#x27;s first &#x27;treble&#x27; of trophies in one season.

The following season, Oriel Park hosted European football for the first time, under newly installed floodlights, with the visit of Vasas SC of Hungary. But Fox fell out with the club&#x27;s board during the trip to Budapest for the return leg, and he was released the following March, despite his side being set to retain the title. The Dublin City Cup of 1967–68 was his final success at the club. Dundalk subsequently finished as runners-up in the League, qualifying for the 1968–69 Fairs Cup, where they won a European tie for the first time with victory over DOS Utrecht. But fourth-place in the League that season, and another City Cup, was all that the remnants of Fox&#x27;s team could achieve.

Future Ireland manager Liam Tuohy took over in the summer of 1969 and also joined the board, and as a result of his managerial experience, Dundalk entered the new decade at the top of the league table. But Tuohy was obliged to thin the squad and cut the wage bill because of the scale of the debts still hanging over the club from the redevelopment of Oriel Park, and he could not build a side able to sustain a title challenge. The 1971–72 Shield success would be the high point of his reign, and he quit at the end of that season, criticising a lack of local support in the process. His only other trophy at the club was the 1970–71 Leinster Senior Cup.

Dundalk had to sell or release several players to survive after Tuohy left, and they slid down the table with a young, inexperienced team finishing second from bottom in 1972–73. To recover the situation, a new board took over the running of the club, and hired John Smith from Walsall as player-manager. After renegotiating the club&#x27;s debts, they were able to provide Smith with funds to sign several players. Smith delivered a Leinster Senior Cup in his first season, but they subsequently fell away in the league after a good start, and Smith quit two matches into his second season for a job outside football. 

===A trophy-laden era (1975–1995)===

The club then appointed Jim McLaughlin as player-manager in November 1974,
and it was under McLaughlin that they recovered and reached a new level of success. With the remnants of Smith&#x27;s squad, and players unwanted elsewhere, he won his first league title (the club&#x27;s fourth) in 1975–76, losing one match in the process. The title brought European football back to the town for the first time since 1969 and in the following season&#x27;s European Cup, they met PSV Eindhoven and were deemed unlucky not to win the first leg at home. That match started an unbeaten run in Europe in Oriel Park of eight matches over the following five seasons. They ended the 1976–77 season by winning the Leinster Senior Cup, and a week later won the club&#x27;s first FAI Cup since 1958 when they defeated Limerick United in the final.

League form had been mixed in the two seasons following the league title and, despite winning their first League Cup and retaining the Leinster Senior Cup, a poor end to the 1977–78 league season led to rumours that McLaughlin would be let go. The club supported the &quot;reorganisation&quot; he demanded, however, and it used the funds from the sale of three players to Liverpool to invest in the squad and make ground improvements at Oriel. McLaughlin&#x27;s second league title followed in 1978–79, and they went on to defeat Waterford in the Cup final to complete the club&#x27;s first League and Cup Double. The Double winning side&#x27;s 1979–80 European Cup run the following season, where they narrowly missed out on qualifying for the quarter-finals (losing 3–2 on aggregate to Celtic), was the club&#x27;s best European performance until 2016.

They finished as runners-up in the league for the next two seasons, and achieved their only domestic cup double in 1980–81—winning both the League Cup and the FAI Cup. McLaughlin&#x27;s third and final league title at the club arrived in 1981–82, after an early season 10-point gap to Bohemians was overhauled. A trophy-less 1982–83 season, which saw them miss out on Europe, signalled that the team was entering a transition period. McLaughlin resigned in May 1983, saying he needed a change.

After two seasons that ended in mid-table, former player Turlough O&#x27;Connor was appointed ahead of the League&#x27;s split into two divisions in 1985–86. O&#x27;Connor quickly built a squad capable of challenging for honours and his sides consistently finished in the top four for the following eight seasons. They won the 1987 League Cup, and finished as runners-up in both the League and the FAI Cup to qualify for Europe for the first time in five years. The following season started with a visit from Cup Winners&#x27; Cup holders Ajax Amsterdam, and ended with the club&#x27;s second League and Cup Double—with the title being won on the last day of the season, and the FAI Cup being won with victory over Derry City.

O&#x27;Connor won his second League Cup in 1989–90, and another league title followed in 1990–91 in an end of season, winner takes all match in Turners Cross against Cork City. But Dundalk spurned an opportunity to progress in the European Cup, when a 1–1 draw away to Honved was followed by a 0–2 home defeat. Attendances started to drop noticeably during 1992–93, as the new English Premier League broadcast live on BSkyB was growing in popularity. By the end of the season, the board was facing financial issues that threatened the club&#x27;s survival—a &quot;healthy&quot; surplus in 1989, had become a serious deficit, with income falling due to some of the lowest gate receipts in memory. The 1993–94 season started with mixed results, with away victories being followed by defeats at home and, after a home defeat to Monaghan United, O&#x27;Connor resigned.

O&#x27;Connor was replaced by Dermot Keely, who had captained the club under Jim McLaughlin. The older players were released, and a thin squad struggled—missing out on the &#x27;Top Six&#x27; round-robin that decided the title. They played out the final third of the season in a meaningless &#x27;bottom six&#x27; round-robin in front of tiny crowds, which contributed to the worsening financial position. Early the following season, the financial issues came to a head, and several local businessmen formed a new interim company to take the club over, saving it from bankruptcy. Despite the financial problems, Keely led his team to the club&#x27;s ninth league title on a dramatic final day. Starting the day in third place in the table, they needed to win their match at home to Galway United and for both Shelbourne and Derry City to fail to win their games. They won their match and news eventually filtered through that both of their challengers had failed to win, confirming Dundalk as champions.

===Decline (1995–2012)===
The 1994–95 title did not halt the club&#x27;s decline, and Keely did not see out the title defence, quitting midway through the 1995–96 season—reportedly frustrated at being unable to strengthen his squad. Dundalk sank down the table and had to survive a promotion/relegation play-off in 1996–97. The board turned to Jim McLaughlin to try to turn things around, but early in the 1998–99 season it was revealed that the club was in serious financial trouble again and the whole squad had been transfer-listed. An end-of-season collapse saw the club drop from the top-tier for the first time, with relegation confirmed 20 years to the day after they had won their first Double.

The club was taken over by a supporters&#x27; co-op in 2000, and initial expectations were of an immediate return to the top-flight. But Dundalk became embroiled in a losing battle with the league&#x27;s hierarchy and Kilkenny City over the latter playing an improperly registered player, which reached the High Court. The following season, the co-op invested heavily in the playing squad and, under new manager Martin Murray, they were promoted as 2000–01 First Division Champions. Although seemingly well-placed for the return to the top-flight, they were relegated again the following season, with the league being reduced from 12 teams to 10. Despite this setback, Murray&#x27;s side won the club&#x27;s ninth FAI Cup a week later, with victory over Bohemians in the final.

After being relegated again, Dundalk were stuck in the lower reaches of the First Division for the next four seasons. With no sign of promotion, the co-op members agreed to the club being taken back into private ownership by its CEO, Gerry Matthews. They finished second under new manager John Gill in 2006, securing a play-off tie against Waterford United. Even though they won the play-off, they were still denied a place in the 2007 Premier Division, with Galway United (who had finished third in that season&#x27;s First Division) selected by the FAI&#x27;s 2006 IAG Report to be promoted ahead of both Dundalk and Waterford. In 2008, they won promotion back to the Premier Division, pipping Shelbourne to the top spot on the final night of the season. Gill was replaced by Ian Foster for the return to the top flight, despite winning the First Division title.

At first, Dundalk stabilised their position back in the Premier Division—qualifying for the 2010–11 Europa League, leading the league table midway through the 2010 season, and reaching the 2011 Setanta Sports Cup final. But results subsequently deteriorated and, with financial losses mounting as the 2011 season drew to a close, Matthews decided to let Foster&#x27;s contract expire and relinquish control of the club. With the club in danger of insolvency during a disastrous 2012, it was taken over by local businessmen Andy Connolly and Paul Brown (owners of the team&#x27;s official sponsors, Fastfix), and Dundalk subsequently managed to remain in the top-flight by defeating Waterford United in the play-off.

===Revival and dominance (2013–2020)===

Having saved the club, the new owners turned to Stephen Kenny to become the new manager. They mounted an unexpected title challenge in his first season, eventually finishing as runners-up. Kenny kept the nucleus of the new side together for the following season, and went on to guide the club to its first league title since 1994–95. They also won that season&#x27;s League Cup, the club&#x27;s first League and League Cup Double. The 2015 season saw them dominate, winning the club&#x27;s third League and FAI Cup Double—with the title being won by 11-points and the Cup with victory over Cork City in the final. They also won the Leinster Senior Cup—the club&#x27;s first &#x27;treble&#x27; of trophies since 1966–67. A third successive league title was sealed with two games to spare in 2016.

2016 also saw the club qualify for the Champions League play-off round, after they first defeated FH of Iceland, then came from a goal down in the tie to defeat BATE Borisov 3–1 on aggregate. They drew Legia Warsaw for the play-off, with the first leg played in the Aviva Stadium in Dublin in front of a crowd of 30,417. They suffered a 2–0 defeat in the home leg, but shocked Legia in the return leg by taking a 1–0 lead. Legia equalised late in the game and won the tie 3–1 on aggregate. As a result, Dundalk qualified for the group stage of the Europa League. A draw with AZ Alkmaar in the Netherlands, followed by a victory over Maccabi Tel Aviv in Tallaght Stadium, were the first points earned by an Irish club in the group stage of European competition.

The departure of some key players after the European run, and a slow start to the new season, meant that they slipped to runners-up spots in both league and FAI Cup although they won their sixth League Cup. The club&#x27;s European form had attracted interest from abroad, however, and a consortium of American investors led by PEAK6 completed a takeover in January 2018. Kenny&#x27;s side reasserted itself in 2018, winning another League and Cup Double—the second under Kenny and fourth in the club&#x27;s history—breaking points-total and goals scored-total records in the process. In the aftermath, Kenny resigned in order to accept the Republic of Ireland U-21 manager&#x27;s role.
Hoping to achieve continuity, the new owners replaced Kenny with his assistant manager, Vinny Perth, as head coach, with John Gill returning as first-team coach. Despite falling 13-points behind early 2019 leaders Shamrock Rovers in April, they overhauled the deficit within weeks, and subsequently won the club&#x27;s 14th league title, with four games to spare. They also won the League Cup by defeating Derry City on penalties in the final, to secure a second League and League Cup Double. They were denied a first domestic Treble of League, FAI Cup and League Cup, however, when they were beaten in a penalty shoot-out in the FAI Cup Final. But they ended the season with a comprehensive 7–1 aggregate victory over Northern Irish champions, Linfield, in the inaugural Champions Cup.

Early the following season, a goal scored by Jordan Flores went viral and was subsequently nominated for the FIFA Puskás Award. Soon after, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic saw the cessation of football in line with other European countries. The season resumed with a reduced schedule of 18 matches in total and matches being played behind closed doors. Manager Vinny Perth was dismissed following Dundalk&#x27;s exit from Europe in the first qualifying round of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League. He was replaced by Italian Filippo Giovagnoli. Dundalk subsequently qualified for the group stage of the 2020–21 Europa League after victories over Inter Club d&#x27;Escaldes, Sheriff Tiraspol and KÍ Klaksvik in the qualifying rounds. They were drawn in Group B alongside Arsenal, Rapid Wien, and Molde. They failed to win any points and finished bottom of the group.

In the FAI Cup, they had an 11–0 semi-final victory over Athlone Town—setting a new record for the biggest win in the competition&#x27;s history, which was also a new club record victory. They followed that with a 4–2 extra-time victory over Shamrock Rovers, with David McMillan scoring a hat-trick, to win the Cup for a twelfth time and qualify for Europe for a 25th time.

===Upheaval (2021–present)===
The 2021 season saw Shane Keegan named first-team manager, with Giovagnoli reverting to the position of &#x27;coach&#x27; because he did not have a UEFA Pro Licence. The season began with a victory in the President&#x27;s Cup, but after a run of defeats at the start of the league campaign, both Keegan and Giovagnoli left the club. Dundalk struggled for the remainder of the domestic season with their lowest league finish since 2012, and they went out to Vitesse Arnhem in the third qualifying round of the inaugural Europa Conference League. Before the season ended, the club was returned to local ownership when a consortium led by former co-owner Andy Connolly and sports technology firm STATSports agreed a takeover with Peak6. The new owners then installed former captain Stephen O&#x27;Donnell as the club&#x27;s new head coach in the close season.

In his first season in charge, O&#x27;Donnell steered his new-look side to a third-place finish and qualification for the Europa Conference League. They failed to capitalise in 2023, exiting the Conference League in the second qualifying round and finishing mid-table and outside the European qualification places. The club&#x27;s finances were quickly deteriorating and there was another change of ownership in the close season, when it was taken over by a US-based Irish businessman, Brian Ainscough. A poor start to the 2024 season resulted in O&#x27;Donnell being let go, beginning a turbulent month in which he was replaced by Noel King, whose tenure lasted 25 days before he resigned citing medical issues. Head of Football Operations Brian Gartland was sacked during that period, following a clash with the owner over King&#x27;s appointment. Gartland later sued the club for wrongful dismissal and on 29 January 2025, it was ordered by the Workplace Relations Commission to pay him a sum of €64,434 in relation to three separate workplace breaches.

The club hired Jon Daly to replace King and there was a brief improvement in form. However, in September, after several defeats and with seven games left to play, Daly confirmed that players and staff at the club had not been paid. It was subsequently revealed that the club had amassed losses of €1.2 million to the end of 2023 and was in danger of insolvency before the end of the season. Ainscough passed control of the holding company to a Dundalk-based barrister, John Temple, which avoided a mid-season withdrawal from the league. The concurrent collapse in form was not halted and relegation was confirmed before the end of the season, with Daly leaving after the final match. 

Ciarán Kilduff, who had played for the club during Stephen Kenny&#x27;s reign, was named the new manager within days, and the club was belatedly awarded a licence to compete in the 2025 League of Ireland First Division, following Temple&#x27;s efforts to get the debt situation under control, thus avoiding examinership.

==Crest and colours==

===Crest history===

After outgrowing its links with the Great Northern Railway, the football club adopted the then coat of arms of the town of Dundalk (three gold martlets on an azure field) in December 1927, and incorporated the crest on the club&#x27;s new white playing shirts. This coat of arms had represented the town since 1673, when it was granted a charter under Charles II of England. It appears as the &#x27;Corporation Seal&#x27; in a town plan dated 1675. The crest disappeared from the playing shirts in 1930, however, after the urban district council proposed to remove the &quot;three black crows&quot; from the seal of the town. A modified crest was reintroduced to the shirt for the 1952 FAI Cup Final, consisting of three black martlets on a white shield bearing the club name. After some minor redesigns in the following years, the white shield became a red shield with white martlets in 1997, and in 2015 this crest was modified to incorporate a gold star, to commemorate Dundalk&#x27;s tenth League of Ireland title.

===Kit history===
Dundalk&#x27;s colours have been white shirts with black shorts and black or white socks since the start of the 1940–41 season. It is known that the Dundalk G.N.R. club wore blue shirts when it started in 1903. and were reported to be wearing &quot;yellow and black&quot; in 1906, but there is no further evidence of defined club colours in the pre-World War I years. When the club was revived for the 1919–20 season, the colours adopted were black and amber-striped shirts with white shorts. In advance of dropping the &#x27;G.N.R.&#x27; moniker and becoming &#x27;Dundalk A.F.C.&#x27;, the club changed to a strip of white shirts with the town crest as its badge, and blue shorts matching the azure shield of the crest. The new colours were first worn on St Stephen&#x27;s Day 1927 in the opening match of the 1927–28 League of Ireland Shield.

This combination was worn until 1939 but came to be seen as unlucky due to the number of cup final defeats Dundalk had during the 1930s.
Hoping a change would bring luck, the club introduced a sky blue and maroon quartered shirt with white shorts and maroon socks in 1939–40, but they promptly lost to non-league opposition in the first round of that season&#x27;s FAI Cup, and went back to wearing white shirts for the following season, this time paired with black shorts. Possibly by coincidence, when the clubs of the town amalgamated to form the first Dundalk Association Football Club in 1904, the colours chosen were &quot;white shirt, bearing the Dundalk coat of arms, and black pants&quot;. The &#x27;home&#x27; colours have remained essentially unchanged with red trims being incorporated since the 1990s. An all-white kit was introduced for the first time in the 1965–66 season, and was also the combination used in 1973–74 and 2003. All-white kits are still worn occasionally when required to avoid kit clashes.

;Away colours
The earliest photographic record of the team in &#x27;away&#x27; colours comes from the 1928–29 season. For their first visit to play Fordsons after adopting white shirts, Dundalk were obliged to wear borrowed shirts with their own blue shorts and black socks, as the home side also wore white shirts. For the next two seasons, they wore their old black and amber-striped shirts when travelling to face teams wearing white.

The club did not have an official away kit until 1977–78. In the interim, red shirts were worn if change colours were needed. An all-red kit was produced for the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup tie away to Hajduk Split in 1977 and this became the away kit for domestic games that season. An all-red away kit was worn against Tottenham Hotspur in 1981 but otherwise official away colours were not required again until the 1990–91 season, when all-red was again adopted. Since then, away kits have usually been based on red or black. The club has twice introduced away colours that pay homage to its G.N.R. roots—in 2016 and again in 2021.
Prior to 2019, ad hoc third colours had been worn by the team only when both home and away kits clashed with an opponent&#x27;s colours. An official commercially available third kit was introduced that season for the first time—an all-lilac strip with white and black trim. It was designed by then kit supplier CX+ Sport, as part of a fundraising partnership between the club and Temple Street Children&#x27;s University Hospital. The logo of the charity replaced that of the official sponsor Fyffes on the chest of the shirt. This kit was worn in all rounds of the successful 2019 League Cup campaign, and in the early rounds of that season&#x27;s FAI Cup. The next season that the club released third colours was in 2023.
===Kit suppliers===
The club&#x27;s kit supplier is Playr-Fit, who signed a three-year deal beginning with the 2023 season. They replaced Umbro, who had been the supplier between 2007 and 2015, and between 2020 and 2022. Previous suppliers include Dundalk-based companies CX+ Sport (2016–2019) and Eros Sportswear (1985–1988). O’Neills (1976–1984; 1990–2004) have also been a long-term supplier. Erreà (2005) and Diadora (2006) have each been suppliers for one season while Adidas Teamwear was used temporarily during 1982–83. A Cork-based company, Union Sport, supplied kits for two seasons (1988–89 and 1989–90). Their products were notable in that the company used a Confederate flag (the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia) as its logo, which featured prominently on team shirts and other apparel.

==Home grounds==

===Athletic Grounds===
Between 1903 and 1936, Dundalk mostly played at the Athletic Grounds near the town centre (land which was eventually sold in 1959 for a factory development). The Athletic Grounds were owned by the Dundalk Young Ireland&#x27;s Athletic Grounds Company and made available for all local team sports. Dundalk&#x27;s matches were usually played on Sundays, enabling a large Northern Irish contingent of spectators (inconvenienced by Sunday Observance laws) to attend games. When matches had to be moved to Saturdays, the club suffered financially from lower gate receipts. If the Athletic Grounds were unavailable altogether, then matches were played at the grounds of the Dundalk Educational Institution (now Dundalk Grammar School), the grounds at St Mary&#x27;s College, or the Carroll&#x27;s Recreation Ground.

===Oriel Park===
In 1936, the club moved permanently to land on the Carrick Road made available by former committee member P.J. Casey on a long-term land lease and named the new ground &quot;Oriel Park&quot;. Almost 10 years to the day after Dundalk G.N.R. played their first Free State League match away to Fordsons, the same club (as Cork F.C.) were the first visitors to Oriel Park, with the home team winning 2–1. Oriel&#x27;s attendance record is an estimated 18,000, set in 1982 for Dundalk&#x27;s European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup second round tie against Tottenham Hotpsur On occasions when Oriel has been unavailable due to works, matches have been moved to either United Park in Drogheda or Gortakeegan in Monaghan. The ground has had an artificial playing surface since 2005.
;Home grounds for European matches
Dundalk played their first home European match, against F.C. Zurich in the 1963–64 European Cup, in Dalymount Park in Dublin—as Oriel Park did not have floodlights. Floodlighting was installed in 1967 to allow matches to be played there—the first being the visit of Vasas SC of Hungary in the 1967–68 European Cup. The 1995–96 UEFA Cup tie against Malmö was moved to United Park in Drogheda as the Oriel pitch was being re-laid that summer, and the 2002–03 UEFA Cup tie against Varteks was moved to Tolka Park in Dublin because Oriel did not meet UEFA&#x27;s upgraded standards for football stadiums at that time.

Oriel has since been upgraded to a Category 2 Stadium, able to accommodate 3,100 seated spectators for European matches. Matches requiring a ground to have Category 3 status have been played in Tallaght Stadium and matches requiring a ground meeting Category 4 status have been played at the Aviva Stadium.

==Supporters==
The Supporters Club is called &#x27;The 1903&#x27;, in honour of the football club&#x27;s year of formation. There is also a Ladies Supporters Club, the &#x27;Lilywhite Ladies&#x27;. The Dundalk G.N.R. club&#x27;s members formed its first Supporters Club during the 1928–29 season. The Supporters Clubs have raised vital funds in support of the club through the decades, money that was often required to keep the club viable.

Dundalk fans have nicknamed the team &#x27;the Lilywhites&#x27; and supporters also use &#x27;the Town&#x27; as shorthand for the club. Both nicknames have been in use since at least the 1950s. The hashtag &quot;#CmonTheTown&quot; is used by fans on social media. From when the club was first formed until its change of colours in 1927–28, the team&#x27;s nickname was &#x27;the Railwaymen&#x27;. Later, the team was known as &#x27;the Northerners&quot;, or &#x27;the Bordermen&#x27; (due to the town&#x27;s location close to the border with Northern Ireland).

The current generation of fans—who followed the club out of the First Division, through the ownership crisis of 2012, and into the subsequent successful period—style themselves the &#x27;Shedside Army&#x27;. They are responsible for Oriel&#x27;s &#x27;tifo&#x27; displays. One such display—the flying of Palestinian flags in Oriel Park during a Europa League tie—resulted in a UEFA fine for Dundalk of €18,000. Supporters have two mottoes: &quot;&quot;We See Things They&#x27;ll Never See&quot; owing to the roller-coaster of highs and lows the club has experienced; and &quot;Dundalk Will Never Die But You Will&quot;&quot;, a riff on a Mogwai album title that references the club&#x27;s many financial crises. The club anthem has become &quot;Three Little Birds&quot; by Bob Marley and the Wailers (both because of the club crest and because of the sentiments expressed in the lyrics).

===Support base and attendances===

The club&#x27;s support base is the Dundalk Municipal District, the adjacent Carrickmacross–Castleblayney Municipal District of County Monaghan, and south County Armagh. The average Friday night home league attendance is approximately 2,700, with attendances at &#x27;bigger&#x27; matches of approximately 3,500.

===Rivalries===
The Louth Derby is contested between Dundalk and Drogheda United, who entered the League of Ireland in 1963. The clubs played an annual friendly from 1966 to 1984—the Donegan Cup, presented by former Louth TD Paddy Donegan. Apart from one attempt to revive the contest in 1990, it was dropped as the two clubs could not find suitable dates for it during the season after the split of the League of Ireland into two divisions. The friendly was reintroduced as a pre-season match in 1997 with a new trophy—the Jim Malone Cup, in honour of three-time chairman of the board, the late Jim Malone.

The two clubs have rarely competed for honours simultaneously, although they did meet in the final of the 1971–72 League of Ireland Shield, with Dundalk winning 5–0. Many of Dundalk&#x27;s most successful periods have corresponded with Drogheda being at the lower end of the league table or in the First Division, while Drogheda&#x27;s most successful period (between 2004 and 2008) occurred while Dundalk were in the lower tier. The derby has been fractious on occasion, particularly during cup ties between the sides, and there have been clashes between fans after matches. In addition to the Louth Derby, Dundalk fans would see Shamrock Rovers as their main rivals, as Rovers hold the records for both the most league titles and the most FAI Cups, with Dundalk next in the honours list for both competitions.

==Ownership and finances==
Dundalk-based barrister John Temple has been the majority shareholder since 17 September 2024.

===Ownership history===
As an association football club for the employees of the Great Northern Railway works in the town, it was &#x27;owned&#x27; by the company and run by a management committee elected by its members. The club was converted to a membership-based limited company, &#x27;Dundalk Association Football Club Limited&#x27;, on 25 January 1932. This brought it under the ownership of its supporters, who elected a management committee every two years. This ownership structure survived until the end of 1965 when it was voluntarily liquidated by the members and taken over by a public limited company, &#x27;Dundalk Football Club Limited&#x27;, in January 1966.

The financial issues that occurred in late 1994, which saw the club become effectively insolvent, forced the liquidation of the 1966 company. It was taken over by &#x27;Dundalk AFC Interim Limited&#x27;, a new holding company comprising former and current directors under chairman Enda McGuill. But the solvency issues that had faced the club through most of the 1990s arose again in 1998, resulting in relegation that season for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. It was taken over by the &#x27;Dundalk F.C. Co-operative&#x27; in 2000, returning it to a membership-based, supporter-owned model. But the co-op was unable to make the sort of investment in either the team or in Oriel Park required to bring the club back to the Premier Division. 

The co-op decided to sell the training ground, Hiney Park, in order to service debts and pay for work at Oriel. The man who purchased Hiney Park, Gerry Matthews, was subsequently invited to join the board as CEO in 2006. He then took the club into private ownership as &#x27;Dundalk FC Limited&#x27; when it was accepted that the co-op could not continue to support it. It was returned to a solid footing under the ownership of Matthews but his decision to end his financial support in 2012 lead to another threat of insolvency. With the assistance of the Dundalk FC Supporters Trust, the club was rescued by the owners of its official sponsors, Fastfix—Paul Brown and Andy Connolly. They formed a new trading company &#x27;Dundalk Town FC Limited&#x27; and completed a takeover in time for the 2013 season. Brown and Connolly then sold their interest to a consortium of investors led by the American investment firm Peak6 in 2018. 

At the end of the 2021 season, the club was returned to local ownership when a group led by the returning Connolly and the owners of sports technology firm STATSports agreed a takeover deal with Peak6. The club saw another change of ownership at the end of the 2023 season, when Irish-American businessman Brian Ainscough assumed full control of the club. Ainscough&#x27;s ownership lasted less than a year. It was revealed in September 2024 that the club had amassed losses of €1.2 million to the end of 2023 and was in danger of insolvency. Ainscough&#x27;s shareholding in the club was subsequently acquired by Dundalk-based John Temple.

===Sponsorship and income streams===
Dundalk&#x27;s first shirt sponsor was National Aluminium after the introduction of shirt sponsorship in 1980. The company&#x27;s brand remained on the team&#x27;s shirts until 1984. From 1987 until 2002, the official sponsor was Harp Lager (the brand being synonymous with the town). Other long-term sponsors included Fyffes, who had a deal that ran from 2012 until 2020.

For the 2025 season, the team playing shirt&#x27;s chest logo is that of official sponsors ZOMA marketing agency. The shirt&#x27;s sleeve and upper back sponsor is (Renault) Blackstone Motors, and the lower back sponsor is UHY business advisory service. There are several other club partners and academy sponsors.

There are other sponsorship arrangements, such as sponsorship of individual players, and sponsorship of individual home matches. The club&#x27;s Lotto is managed in partnership with Clubforce.

There is a merchandise shop at Oriel Park and an online store on the official website. In addition to sponsorship, Oriel Park is made available for junior and schools football, and is also available for rent to private groups and clubs in other sporting codes. The ground&#x27;s public bar, &#x27;The Lilywhite Lounge&#x27;, is available for social events, as is the members&#x27; bar—the &#x27;Enda McGuill Suite&#x27;.

===Player transfers===
Players in the League of Ireland are typically signed on single or two-year contracts, resulting in large numbers of free agents at the end of each season. As a result, the transfer-fee inflation seen throughout European club football has not been a feature of the game in Ireland, and Dundalk have not benefited financially from player transfers since the Bosman ruling came into effect. Indeed, the PFAI Players&#x27; Player of the Year for 2015 (Richie Towell), and 2016 (Daryl Horgan), both left for EFL Championship clubs at the end of their respective award-winning seasons on free transfers, due to contract expiry.

Transfer fees both paid and received have generally remained undisclosed. The record transfer fee received (when all clauses were eventually triggered and paid) was approximately £80,000 (equivalent to €200,000 in 2019) for Steve Staunton, who was signed by Liverpool in August 1986 for an initial fee of £20,000. Dundalk subsequently received a further estimated £70,000 (equivalent to €150,000 in 2019) when Staunton was transferred by Liverpool to Aston Villa in 1991.

===Media===

====Online====
LOITV is a subscription service that makes all League of Ireland matches available to view live worldwide, with clubs being responsible for producing their own live match coverage.

====Television and radio====
Ireland&#x27;s State-owned public service broadcaster, RTÉ, and main commercial broadcaster, Virgin Media Ireland have broadcast rights for League of Ireland and FAI Cup matches as part of packages from the FAI that include international matches. However, there is little or no income derived from these rights for clubs. Indeed, RTÉ refused to pay the fee asked to broadcast the home leg of Dundalk&#x27;s Champions League victory against BATE Borisov in 2016, a few months after they had been named RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Team of the Year&quot; for 2015.

Live commentary of matches is broadcast on Dundalk FM (a community radio station) and LMFM. The radio broadcasts do not have licensing restrictions and can be accessed online in Ireland and globally from the stations&#x27; websites.

====Documentaries====
Two documentaries centred on the club have been produced. &quot;Once In a Lifetime&quot;, released in 2015, was a retelling of stories of the club&#x27;s 1979–80 European Cup campaign.

&quot;One Armed Wonder: The Extraordinary Story of Jimmy Hasty&quot;, released in 2023, was produced by UEFA TV and told the life story of former Dundalk player Jimmy Hasty. The documentary won the &#x27;Outstanding Short Documentary&#x27; award at the 2024 Sports Emmy Awards.

===Club publications===
The club&#x27;s official website, dundalkfc.com, has been voted &#x27;Website of the Year&#x27; by the Soccer Writers Association of Ireland on eight occasions, most recently for 2021.

A matchday programme is produced for all home matches—the &quot;DFC Magazine&quot;. This programme was voted &#x27;Programme of the Year&#x27; for 10 of the 12 seasons between 2008 and 2019 by the Irish Football Programme Club.

In addition, the following books have been published:

==Records==
The record for the most appearances in all competitions is currently held by Tommy McConville, who appeared in 580 matches in two stints at the club between 1964 and 1986. Several players have won five league titles—Martin Lawlor being the first to reach the mark. Patrick Hoban is the club&#x27;s leading goalscorer in all competitions. Five other players—Joey Donnelly, Eddie Carroll, Joe Martin, Jimmy Hasty, and Paddy Turner—have also scored 100 goals or more. Hoban broke Donnelly&#x27;s club record for league goals during the 2019 season and subsequently became the first Dundalk player to score 100 league goals for the club during the 2022 season. He then broke Donnelly&#x27;s record for goals in all competitions during the 2023 season and finished his Dundalk career in 2023 with 150 goals.

Bob Egan became the first Dundalk player to win an international cap on 20 April 1929, when he represented Ireland in a 4–0 victory over Belgium. The player who has won the most caps while at the club is Billy O&#x27;Neill, who won 11 caps for Ireland—his international career being cut short at the age of 23 by the outbreak of World War II. Mick Fairclough was the most recently capped player, earning two caps in May 1982. In 2021, Raivis Jurkovskis became the first Dundalk player to be capped for a country other than Ireland while at the club.

Dundalk&#x27;s record win is an 11–0 victory over Athlone Town in the 2020 FAI Cup. The record league win is 9–0, achieved against Jacobs in 1932, and again against Shelbourne in 1980. The biggest victory in a European match is 4–0, achieved with home wins against Fram Reykjavík in the 1981–82 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, and Newtown in the 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League.

The record home attendance is 30,417 v Legia Warsaw in the Aviva Stadium, Dublin for the Champions League play-off round in 2016.

===European competition===
Dundalk have qualified for European competition 26 times as of the 2024–25 European season. They made their European debut in the 1963–64 European Cup and in that campaign, they became the first Irish side to win an away match in Europe. Their best performance in the European Cup was in 1979–80, when they reached the last 16, and they reached the last 16 of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1981–82. They have qualified twice for the Europa League group stage and they became the first team from Ireland to both win points and win a match at that level of European competition in 2016–17.

They have played against several major names in European football such as Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Celtic, FC Porto, PSV Eindhoven, Ajax, Red Star Belgrade, Hajduk Split, Legia Warsaw, and Zenit St Petersburg. They have faced opponents from the Netherlands most often, having played ties against PSV, Ajax, DOS Utrecht, AZ Alkmaar, and Vitesse Arnhem.

<text>The Hyundai Pony (Hangul: 현대 포니), is a small automobile produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai from 1975 until 1990. The Pony was South Korea&#x27;s first mass-produced and exported car. It has a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and variants were made with two-door coupé utility, three-door liftback, four-door saloon car, and five-door liftback or estate car body styles. The Pony nameplate remained in use until 2000 on some export versions of the Hyundai Excel and Accent.

== Background ==
Hyundai had already ventured into car production by producing locally built versions of the Ford Cortina under licence from 1968. When the company wanted to develop their own car, they hired George Turnbull, the former managing director of Austin and Morris at British Leyland in 1974. He in turn hired five other top British car engineers, Kenneth Barnett as body designer, engineers John Simpson and Edward Chapman, John Crosthwaite as chassis engineer and Peter Slater as chief development engineer. With Turnbull&#x27;s experience with the Morris Marina, engines and transmissions from Mitsubishi, platform from Mitsubishi&#x27;s Lancer, some parts from the Ford Cortina they were already producing, and a hatchback body styled by Italdesign Giugiaro, they developed the Hyundai Pony.

== First generation (1975) ==
The Pony was presented as a coupé concept car at the Turin Motor Show in October 1974, and the car was introduced in December 1975 as a four-door saloon car to compete with the Saehan Gemini and Kia Brisa. A coupé utility version was added in May 1976, which was called a pickup, although it differed from a typical pickup truck in that its cargo tray was integral with the body rather than being a separate assembly. An estate car arrived in April 1977. In 1981, the small boot lid from the saloon was replaced by a hatchback tail gate creating a new five-door liftback model. This was accompanied with a new three-door liftback. The Pony was loosely based on both the earlier licence-built Ford Cortinas and the Morris Marina, with former British Leyland engineers being hired by Hyundai to design the car.

Hyundai began exporting the Pony to Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Egypt in 1976. European exports began in 1979 with Belgium and the Netherlands, with Greece added shortly thereafter. The pickup version was added in October that year, only available with the smaller, , engine and a payload.

The four-cylinder engine claimed and the engine produced . The 1.4 GLS was tested by the British car magazine &quot;Motor&quot; and top speed was 92 mph with acceleration from 0–60 mph in 15.3 seconds.

=== Lineup ===
*1200:GLS/GL/Standard (UK: T, L, TL, GL)
*1400:GLS/GL (UK: TL, GL, TLS, GLS)
*1600:GLS/GL/Limited (not in all markets)


== Second generation (1982) ==

Introduced in January 1982, the Pony II was similar mechanically to the first-generation version, but was extensively restyled. Only the five-door Liftback and two-door pickup were offered.
With the Pony II, exports also began to the UK in the spring of 1982 – making it the first South Korean car to be sold there. Initially, the Pony was positioned as a budget offering between Eastern Bloc brands (Lada, Skoda) and the lower echelons of established Japanese makes for sales, marking the beginning of a successful foray into this market by Korean carmakers.

=== Engine types ===
For 1984, the Pony came only with a 4G33 Mitsubishi straight-four engine, rated at and of torque. This engine was available with either a four-speed or five-speed manual or a three-speed automatic transmission. The 4G36 engine was not available in Canada. This engine was retained across the line until 1986, after which only the 4G32 engine ( and of torque) was available. In mid-1985, the door handles were blacked out, chrome was removed from the windshield wipers, and the &quot;HD&quot; badge was removed from the centre of the grille and replaced with the lettering &quot;Hyundai&quot; off to the left side. A model 4G32 engine became available in 1985, with optional air conditioning. These powerplants had a hemispherical crossflow cylinder head, two valves per cylinder (chain-driven SOHC), a two-barrel downdraft carburettor (manual choke) and breaker point-type ignition.

Trim levels were &#x27;L&#x27; (standard), &#x27;GL/CX&#x27;, and &#x27;GLS/CXL&#x27;. The &#x27;CX/CXL&#x27; designations were for 1987 model years only. The &quot;L&quot; featured vinyl seats, a fold-down rear bench seat, and usually a four-speed manual transmission mated to a inline-four engine. The &quot;GL/CX&quot; included vinyl-cloth seats, a standard clock (which was mounted in the instrument cluster for 1984–1986 models, and for 1987, a digital clock was added in the centre of the upper dash) rear wiper, passenger-side mirror, tinted glass, lockable fuel door, standard door guards, 50/50 fold-down seats, upgraded interior trim, and (from 1985) an available engine. The &quot;GLS/CXL&quot; included the above with the option of a tachometer, passenger-side vanity mirror, full cloth seats, and (from 1985) a standard 1.6 L engine.

Only the &#x27;L&#x27; and &#x27;CX&#x27; were trim levels for 1987. The &#x27;L&#x27; was the same as the previous &#x27;L&#x27;, however the clock was now digital and the CX had a standard tachometer. From 1986 to 1987, interior colours available were tan or blue. From 1984 to 1985, it was light grey on dark grey. Options included rear window louvers, a front air dam, rear spoiler, GT package (which included a leather-wrapped Momo three-spoke steering wheel), tachometer, different trim and badging, fog lamps, and extra lights in the rear. All GTs came with the more powerful 1.6 engine. The Pony pickup was sold in Europe (only) until the end of the 1980s. The second generation Pony remained on sale until 1988 (until 1990 in South Korea). In some markets the Pony was replaced by a re-badged Hyundai Excel from 1985, particularly in Europe.

=== Canadian-spec (Non-ECC LHD) ===
The Pony II was exported to Canada from 1983, where it was one of the least expensive vehicles on the market, and sales greatly exceeded expectations; initial projections for 1984 called for 5,000 sales, but the final total was 25,123, making it one of the top-selling vehicles in that country. The Pony was released for sale in Canada for the 1984 model year and sales ended in 1987. The Pony was sufficiently popular there that it was sold alongside the Excel until 1987 rather than being replaced by that vehicle as was done in some other markets. The Canadian version of the Pony was modified to meet local standards. Differences between the Canadian Pony versus its European counterparts were bumpers, sealed-beam headlights, side marker lamps instead of indicator repeaters (also in a lower position), and slight alterations in interior instrumentation and trim application.

== Other models ==

=== Concept car ===
The Pony Coupe Concept was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Italdesign and first shown at the 1974 Turin Motor Show. According to Italdesign, the styling exercise was not performed under commission from Hyundai, but that company&#x27;s executives asked to brand the concept as a Hyundai just before the opening of the Turin show. After the positive reception in Turin, the concept Coupe was imported to Korea and featured in domestic advertisements there; reverse engineering the concept began at the Hyundai Ulsan plant, and engineering drawings were made, but the Pony Coupe never reached mass production.

The styling of the Pony Coupe Concept went on to inspire both the DMC DeLorean and Hyundai N Vision 74 concept. The N Vision 74 is equipped with dual electric traction motors (both fitted to the rear axle) with a combined output of and of torque, drawing from a 62.4 kW-hr battery pack and hydrogen tanks storing for an on-board fuel cell.
=== Hyundai Excel ===

In Europe, the front wheel drive Hyundai Excel was sold under the Pony name from 1985 as a replacement for the rear wheel drive version. In other markets, the second generation Pony continued on sale alongside the new Hyundai Excel. Until discontinuation, Excel carried the Pony name.
*The first generation Excel (X1) was called Pony in Europe from 1985 to 1987, and the face-lifted model from 1987–1989 was called the Pony XP.
*For the second generation Excel (X2), the hatchback versions were called Pony in Europe.

The final usage of the name was with the first generation Hyundai Accent, sold as the Pony in France. The Pony name was last used by Hyundai in 2000.

=== Super Pony ===
For the second and third generations, some taxi models of the Hyundai Accent were sold as &quot;Hyundai Super Pony&quot;. The fourth generation used the name &quot;Grand Pony&quot; instead.

=== Pony EV ===
In April 2021, Hyundai displayed the Pony Heritage EV, a restored first-generation Pony converted with an electric vehicle powertrain as a concept, in Hyundai Motorstudio Busan. The powertrain specifications were not available; the interior featured an instrument panel with two three-digit nixie tube displays for state of charge and vehicle speed. The head- and tail-lights feature a pixellated design which Hyundai have called &quot;Pixel Road Trip&quot; or &quot;Parametric Pixel&quot;, reminiscent of 8-bit graphics and matching the design language applied to vehicles under its Ioniq sub-brand, including the contemporary Ioniq 5 production and 45 EV concept vehicles.

<doc id="1234363" wikidata="Q7775414" url="?curid=1234363" title="The Wolf's Hour">
<text>The Wolf&#x27;s Hour is a 1989 World War II horror novel by American writer Robert R. McCammon. It is the story of a British secret agent who goes behind German lines to stop a secret weapon from being launched against the Allies. This agent is a werewolf. The book also includes some of the agent&#x27;s history, namely how he became a werewolf.

==Plot==
In 1942, British spy Michael Gallatin successfully steals German staff maps in North Africa for the British army, who intend to intercept the advance of Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps in the region. Joining his friend Countess Margritta in Cairo, Gallatin is attacked by a German assassin. He narrowly escapes death by strangulation thanks to his lycanthropic power. Having the gift of transforming into a large black wolf with green eyes, he succeeds in killing the assassin, but Margritta is unable to escape and is shot in the head. Tired of the war and feeling responsible for Margritta&#x27;s death, Michael Gallatin retires to Wales.

Two years later, Gallatin is approached by officers who ask him to return to duty. While the Allies are in the midst of organizing a major invasion, disturbing news has reached them from one of their spies in Paris, who holds important information on a large-scale Nazi operation. Refusing the mission at first, Gallatin ends up accepting when he learns that the traitor Harry Sandler, responsible for Margritta&#x27;s death, has been seen in Berlin.

Parachuted near Paris, Gallatin must reach the capital to make contact with the spy Adam, who is under the surveillance of the Gestapo. Gallatin contacts Adam through a Nazi deserter called “Mouse”. He slips a note in Adams pocket that informs Adam to go to an opera at the third act, so Gallatin can receive the information. The Gestapo had followed Adam and shoot him in the head just after the information was disclosed to Michael. Michael escapes by faking suicide using cyanide; he does not swallow the pill. This fake-out allots him time to turn into a werewolf and he kills the fleeing Gestapo. Gallatin and Mouse must make their way east to Berlin, the heart of the Nazis lair, in an attempt to foil a top-secret Nazi plan, “Iron Fist”.

<doc id="1234366" wikidata="Q17012445" url="?curid=1234366" title="Solemn vow">
<text>A solemn vow is a certain vow (&quot;a deliberate and free promise made to God about a possible and better good&quot;) taken by an at least 18 year old person individual after completion of the novitiate in a Catholic religious institute. It is solemn insofar as the Church recognizes it as such.

== Distinction from simple vows ==
Any vow in Catholic religious life other than a solemn vow is a simple vow. Even a vow accepted by a legitimate superior in the name of the Church (the definition of a &quot;public vow&quot;) is a simple vow if the Church has not granted it recognition as a solemn vow. In canon law a vow is public (concerning the Church itself directly) only if a legitimate superior accepts it in the name of the Church; all other vows, no matter how much publicity is given to them, are classified as private vows (concerning directly only those who make them). The vow taken at profession as a member of any religious institute is a public vow, but in recent centuries can be either solemn or simple.

There is disagreement among theologians as to whether the distinction between solemn and simple vows is primarily a matter of ecclesiastical administration or theological in nature; the latter position follows the opinion of Thomas Aquinas, holding that a solemn vow is, regardless of its approbation by the Church, a more strict, perfect and complete consecration to God.

Aquinas held that the only vows that could be considered solemn were those made by receiving the holy orders as a member of the Catholic Hierarchy, or by the religious profession of the rule as a member of a Catholic religious order. 

As a unique exception to this traditional dichotomy, the Benedictine abbots could be consecrated bishops by an analogue apostolic authority (like another bishop, an archbishop, or the pope). This practice was contemplated by the canonical law since the Middle Age, as it is testified by the later life of Peter Cellensis. Since the 18th century, consecrators and episcopal lineage were extended to the Benedictine monks-bishops.

Aquinas, in support of his view, cited the fact that these two vows alone were considered to make the celebration of marriage invalid. He argued that a man who promised, either to a human being or to God (thus making a vow), to marry a certain woman was bound by that promise or vow, but if he broke it and married a different woman, the subsequent marriage was nonetheless considered valid. Similarly, if he made a vow to enter a particular religious institute or become a priest, but instead entered a different institute or decided to marry, the religious profession or the marriage, despite being a violation of his vow, was still considered valid. Once he had received holy orders or made a religious profession, however, any marriage he contracted was considered null and void.

Solemn vows were originally considered indissoluble. Not even the Pope could dispense from them. If for a just cause a religious was expelled, the vow of celibacy remained unchanged and so rendered invalid any attempt at marriage, the vow of obedience obliged in relation, generally, to the bishop rather than to the religious superior, and the vow of poverty was modified to meet the new situation but the expelled religious &quot;could not, for example, will any goods to another; and goods which came to him reverted at his death to his institute or to the Holy See&quot;.

==Vows in religious institutes==

In medieval times religious vows taken by members of religious institutes approved by the Holy See were regarded both as solemn and public. This was declared by Pope Boniface VIII (1235 – 1303).

The situation changed in the 16th century. In 1521, two years after the Fifth Lateran Council had forbidden the establishment of new religious institutes, Pope Leo X appointed a rule with simple vows for those tertiaries attached to existing institutes who undertook to live in a community. In 1566 and 1568, Pope Pius V rejected this class of institute, but they continued to exist and even increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval. Only on almost the last day of the 19th century were they officially reckoned as religious, when Pope Leo XIII recognized as religious all men and women who took simple vows in such congregations.

A special case applied to the Jesuits. In the 16th century, Ignatius of Loyola obtained authorization for the members of the Society of Jesus to be divided into the professed with solemn vows and the coadjutors with dispensable simple vows. Nevertheless, before Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s reforms in the 19th century, these simple vows constituted them religious in the true and proper sense of the word, with the consequent privileges and exemption of regulars, including the vows being a diriment impediment to matrimony, etc. In theory, the recognition as religious for simple vows had universal validity, but in practice, the Roman Curia considered it an exclusive privilege to the Society of Jesus.

==Codes of Canon Law on religious institutes==

On the basis of the distinction between solemn and simple vows, the 1917 Code of Canon Law made several other distinctions in relation to religious institutes, which it defined as legitimately established associations in accordance with which the members make public vows, either perpetual vows or temporary ones that are to be renewed periodically. It reserved the name &quot;religious &quot;order&quot;&quot; for institutes in which the vows were solemn, and used the term &quot;religious &quot;congregation&quot;&quot; for those with simple vows. The members of a religious &quot;order&quot; for men were called &quot;regulars&quot;, those belonging to a religious &quot;congregation&quot; were simply &quot;religious&quot;, a term that applied also to regulars. For women, those with simple vows were simply &quot;sisters&quot;, with the term &quot;nun&quot; reserved in canon law for those who belonged to an institute of solemn vows, even if in some localities they were allowed to take simple vows instead.

However, the 1917 Code abolished the distinction according to which solemn vows, unlike simple vows, were indissoluble. It recognized no totally indispensable religious vows and thereby abrogated for the Latin Church the special consecration that distinguished &quot;orders&quot; from &quot;congregations&quot;, while keeping some juridical distinctions.

A juridical distinction that the 1917 Code maintained was its declaring invalid any marriage attempted by solemnly professed religious or by those with simple vows to which the Holy See had attached the effect of invalidating marriage, while stating that no simple vow rendered a marriage invalid, except in the cases in which the Holy See directed otherwise. Thus solemnly professed religious were barred absolutely from marriage, and any marriage they attempted was invalid. Those who made simple vows were obliged not to marry, but if they did break their vow, the marriage was considered valid but illicit.

Another difference was that a professed religious of solemn vows lost the right to own property and the capacity to acquire temporal goods for himself or herself, but a professed religious of simple vows, while being prohibited by the vow of poverty from using and administering property, kept ownership and the right to acquire more, unless the constitutions of the religious institute explicitly stated the contrary.

These were two of the nine juridical consequences (apart from spiritual effects) of the difference between solemn and simple vows.

After publication of the 1917 Code, many institutes with simple vows appealed to the Holy See for permission to make solemn vows. The Apostolic Constitution &quot;Sponsa Christi&quot; of 21 November 1950 made access to that permission easier for nuns (in the strict sense), though not for religious institutes dedicated to apostolic activity. Many of these institutes of women then petitioned for the solemn vow of poverty alone. Towards the end of the Second Vatican Council, superiors general of clerical institutes and abbots president of monastic congregations were authorized to permit, for a just cause, their subjects of simple vows who made a reasonable request to renounce their property except for what would be required for their sustenance if they were to depart.

The 1983 Code of Canon Law maintains the distinction between solemn and simple vows, but no longer makes any distinction between their juridical effects. For instance, while under the 1917 Code solemn vows rendered a subsequent marriage invalid, but simple vows only made the marriage illicit, the current Code of Canon Law states that &quot;those bound by a public perpetual vow of chastity in a religious institute invalidly attempt marriage&quot;.

Renunciation of the right to own property is now a matter for the constitutions of the religious institute in question and is associated not with the solemnity of the vows but with their perpetuity. The 1983 Code states:

<text>The fractional quantum Hall effect (fractional QHE or FQHE) is the observation of precisely quantized plateaus in the Hall conductance of 2-dimensional (2D) electrons at fractional values of formula_1, where &quot;e&quot; is the electron charge and &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant. 
At the same time, longitudinal resistance drops to zero (for low enough temperatures) as for the integer QHE.
It is a property of a collective state in which electrons bind magnetic flux lines to make new quasiparticles, and excitations have a fractional elementary charge and possibly also fractional statistics. The 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Robert Laughlin, Horst Störmer, and Daniel Tsui &quot;for their discovery of a new form of quantum fluid with fractionally charged excitations&quot;. 
The microscopic origin of the FQHE is a major research topic in condensed matter physics.

== Descriptions==

The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a collective behavior in a 2D system of electrons. In particular magnetic fields, the electron gas condenses into a remarkable liquid state, which is very delicate, requiring high quality material with a low carrier concentration, and extremely low temperatures. As in the integer quantum Hall effect, the Hall resistance undergoes certain quantum Hall transitions to form a series of plateaus. Each particular value of the magnetic field corresponds to a filling factor (the ratio of number of electrons to magnetic flux quanta corresponding to given area)

:formula_2

where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are integers with no common factors. Here &quot;q&quot; turns out to be an odd number with the exception of filling factor 5/2
and few others (7/2 or 2+3/8). The principal series of such fractions are

:formula_3

and their particle-hole conjugates

:formula_4

Depending on the fraction, both spin-polarised and zero-spin fractional QHE states may exist.
Fractionally charged quasiparticles are neither bosons nor fermions and exhibit anyonic statistics. The fractional quantum Hall effect continues to be influential in theories about topological order. Certain fractional quantum Hall phases appear to have the right properties for building a topological quantum computer.

== History and developments ==
The FQHE was experimentally discovered in 1982 by Daniel Tsui and Horst Störmer, in experiments performed on heterostructures made out of gallium arsenide developed by Arthur Gossard. 

There were several major steps in the theory of the FQHE.

*Laughlin states and fractionally-charged quasiparticles: this theory, proposed by Robert B. Laughlin, is based on accurate trial wave functions for the ground state at fraction formula_5 as well as its quasiparticle and quasihole excitations. The excitations have fractional charge of magnitude formula_6.
*Fractional exchange statistics of quasiparticles: Bertrand Halperin conjectured, and Daniel Arovas, John Robert Schrieffer, and Frank Wilczek demonstrated, that the fractionally charged quasiparticle excitations of the Laughlin states are anyons with fractional statistical angle formula_7; the wave function acquires phase factor of formula_8 (together with an Aharonov-Bohm phase factor) when identical quasiparticles are exchanged in a counterclockwise sense. A recent experiment seems to give a clear demonstration of this effect.
*Hierarchy states: this theory was proposed by Duncan Haldane, and further clarified by Bertrand Halperin, to explain the observed filling fractions not occurring at the Laughlin states&#x27; formula_9. Starting with the Laughlin states, new states at different fillings can be formed by condensing quasiparticles into their own Laughlin states. The new states and their fillings are constrained by the fractional statistics of the quasiparticles, producing e.g. formula_10 and formula_11 states from the Laughlin formula_12 state. Similarly constructing another set of new states by condensing quasiparticles of the first set of new states, and so on, produces a hierarchy of states covering all the odd-denominator filling fractions. This idea has been validated quantitatively, and brings out the observed fractions in a natural order. Laughlin&#x27;s original plasma model was extended to the hierarchy states by Allan H. MacDonald and others. Using methods introduced by Greg Moore and Nicholas Read, based on conformal field theory explicit wave functions can be constructed for all hierarchy states.
*Composite fermions: this theory was proposed by Jainendra K. Jain, and further extended by Halperin, Patrick A. Lee and Read. The basic idea of this theory is that as a result of the repulsive interactions, two (or, in general, an even number of) vortices are captured by each electron, forming integer-charged quasiparticles called composite fermions. The fractional states of the electrons are understood as the integer QHE of composite fermions. For example, this makes electrons at filling factors 1/3, 2/5, 3/7, etc. behave in the same way as at filling factor 1, 2, 3, etc. Composite fermions have been observed, and the theory has been verified by experiment and computer calculations. Composite fermions are valid even beyond the fractional quantum Hall effect; for example, the filling factor 1/2 corresponds to zero magnetic field for composite fermions, resulting in their Fermi sea.
Tsui, Störmer, and Robert B. Laughlin were awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work.

== Evidence for fractionally-charged quasiparticles ==

Experiments have reported results that specifically support the understanding that there are fractionally-charged quasiparticles in an electron gas under FQHE conditions.

In 1995, the fractional charge of Laughlin quasiparticles was measured directly in a quantum antidot electrometer at Stony Brook University, New York. In 1997, two groups of physicists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and at the Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique laboratory near Paris, detected such quasiparticles carrying an electric current, through measuring quantum shot noise
Both of these experiments have been confirmed with certainty.

A more recent experiment, measures the quasiparticle charge.

== Impact ==

The FQH effect shows the limits of Landau&#x27;s symmetry breaking theory. Previously it was held that the symmetry breaking theory could explain all the important concepts and properties of forms of matter. According to this view, the only thing to be done was to apply the symmetry breaking theory to all different kinds of phases and phase transitions. From this perspective, the importance of the FQHE discovered by
Tsui, Stormer, and Gossard is notable for contesting old perspectives.

The existence of FQH liquids suggests that there is much more to discover beyond the present symmetry breaking paradigm in condensed matter physics.
Different FQH states all have the same symmetry
and cannot be described by symmetry breaking theory.
The associated fractional charge, fractional statistics, non-Abelian statistics,
chiral edge states, etc. demonstrate the power and the fascination of emergence in many-body systems.
Thus FQH states represent new states of matter that contain a
completely new kind of order—topological order.
For example, properties once deemed isotropic for all materials may be anisotropic in 2D planes.
The new type of orders represented by FQH states greatly enrich our
understanding of quantum phases and quantum phase transitions.

<text>The South Central Florida Express, Inc. (originally known as the South Central Florida Railroad ) is a common carrier shortline railroad in southern Florida run by U.S. Sugar Corporation. Its trains operate from Sebring to Fort Pierce via Clewiston around the southern perimeter of Lake Okeechobee, and serves customers at 26 locations. With of track, the SCXF is the largest private agricultural railroad in the U.S.

The railroad began operation in 1994 on tracks previously owned and operated by CSX Transportation; in 1998, operation expanded on to tracks leased from the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC). In addition to the SCXF, U.S. Sugar has its own private tracks known as the U.S. Sugar Railroad , which consists of multiple branch lines connected to SCXF tracks. In 2021, the SCXF began operating the Sugar Express , a heritage tourist passenger train featuring a steam locomotive pulling historic passenger cars.

==Operation==

The South Central Florida Express (SCXF) is at its busiest during the main sugar harvest, which usually runs from October to March each year. U.S. Sugar is the only sugar company in the continental U.S. that transports sugarcane by rail.

In addition to the SCXF, U.S. Sugar has its own private tracks known as the &quot;U.S. Sugar Railroad&quot;, which is made up of several branch lines running from SCXF tracks to sugar fields near Clewiston and Bryant. Unlike the SCXF, the USSC is not a common carrier and is not subject to Federal Railroad Administration regulations.

Sugarcane harvested from fields along the line on the west and south sides of Lake Okeechobee is taken by rail in specially designed rail cars to U.S. Sugar&#x27;s refinery in Clewiston for processing. The SCXF refers to these trains as &quot;cane trains&quot;, which then take empty cars back out to the fields.

On the east side of the lake, sugarcane is collected the same way and loaded cars are brought to Bryant Yard near Pahokee, where cars are combined on to longer trains before being sent to Clewiston. This movement of trains from Bryant to Clewiston is referred to as the Bryant Turn. Since the junction switch at the entrance to Bryant Yard is oriented north on the main line, Bryant Turn trains are backed out of the yard on to the main line before heading south and west to Clewiston. During harvest season, Bryant Turn trains can run as often as every four hours.

Refined by-products such as sugar crystals and molasses are shipped from the refinery by rail to interchanges on each end of the line, where they are sent throughout the United States. Chemicals for refining sugar are also brought in to the refinery from the interchanges. SCXF&#x27;s western terminus interchanges with CSX on their Auburndale Subdivision in Sebring, and the eastern terminus in Fort Pierce interchanges with the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) in Fort Pierce. The SCXF also has haulage rights with the FEC to Jacksonville to further interchange with CSX and Norfolk Southern.

===Fleet===
The South Central Florida Express operates eight EMD GP11 locomotives (road numbers 302-305, 308, 310, 312), six EMD GP38 locomotives (404-405, 407-410), six EMD GP40 locomotives (501-506), and two EMD SD40 series locomotives (6323 and 6324). U.S. Sugar also operates one SW1500 and one MP15AC switcher engine. To haul raw sugarcane, SCXF and USSC operate about 800 specifically designed rail cars. Nearly all locomotives on both SCXF and USSC tracks carry the USSC reporting mark.

==Route==

The South Central Florida Express operates on of track, making it the largest private agricultural railroad in the U.S. The SCXF owns the tracks between Sebring and Pahokee, and leases the tracks between Pahokee and Fort Pierce from the FEC. The main line is divided into east and west sides, and the Miami Canal on the south side of Lake Okeechobee in Lake Harbor is where the two sides officially connect. The milepost numbers on each side are independent from one another and remain as they did under predecessor companies.

===West side===

The of main-line track on the west side of Lake Okeechobee begins in Sebring at a connection with CSX&#x27;s Auburndale Subdivision just south of Sebring&#x27;s Amtrak station. A short distance south from Sebring is Desoto City Yard, a small three-track switching yard. CSX has trackage rights into Desoto City Yard where interchange between the two companies takes place.

From Desoto City, the line continues south running mostly parallel to US 27 through Lake Placid and Palmdale. Just south of Palmdale, at a point historically known as Harrisburg, the line turns southeast towards Moore Haven. The line crosses the Caloosahatchee Canal on a small swing bridge in Moore Haven.

The line continues southeast from Moore Haven winding through sugar fields before reaching Clewiston. Clewiston is the location of U.S. Sugar&#x27;s refinery which is co-located with SCXF&#x27;s Clewiston Yard. The yard and refinery are located off the main line on a wye known as Sugar Junction. SCXF&#x27;s maintenance facility is also located in Clewiston along W.C. Owen Avenue.

South of Clewiston, the line winds south and east through more sugar fields before coming to a point known as Keela. At Keela, the line splits with a branch line heading south and east to Okeelanta while the main line heads east from Keela to Lake Harbor, where it crosses the Miami Canal and connects with the east side.

====West side history====
The northernmost of the west side between Sebring and Harrisburg was built in 1916 by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad as part of an effort to extend their Haines City Branch south to Immokalee. Harrisburg was named after the Harris track-laying machine used to construct the line. Trackage south of Harrisburg to Immokalee, which went as far south as Everglades City at one time, was abandoned in 1989.

The Atlantic Coast Line built tracks from Harrisburg to Moore Haven in 1918. In 1921, the Moore Haven &amp; Clewiston Railway was built, which extended the Coast Line&#x27;s tracks to Clewiston. The Coast Line leased the Moore Haven &amp; Clewiston Railway in 1925, and extended it to Lake Harbor in 1929. Even in its early days, the line mostly served U.S. Sugar (and its predecessor, the Southern Sugar Company prior to 1931), who built and operated their own small branch near Clewiston and Lake Okeechobee that connected to the Coast Line (the USSC tracks). By 1944, the Atlantic Coast Line completely bought out the Moore Haven &amp; Clewiston Railway.

Through mergers, the Atlantic Coast Line network would become part of CSX by 1986. CSX operated the line as their Sebring Subdivision along the main line to the sugar fields and Okeelanta Subdivision on the branch line to Okeelanta.

The west side was bought from CSX on June 2, 1990, by the Brandywine Valley Railroad, a Lukens Steel Company subsidiary, and sold to U.S. Sugar on September 17, 1994. U.S. Sugar then spun off the railroad into a separate company with its own board of directors to operate independently from the of branch lines U.S. Sugar already owned (USSC trackage).

===East side===

The of main-line track on the east side of Lake Okeechobee continues the line from Lake Harbor east to South Bay and then north to Belle Glade, Pahokee, and Canal Point.

Located just off the main line on a spur between Pahokee and Canal Point is Bryant Yard. Bryant Yard is used to sort cars and consolidate trains from a number of nearby fields before being sent to Clewiston. Bryant Yard was co-located with the now defunct Bryant Sugar Mill, which closed in 2017.

The line crosses the St. Lucie Canal on a small lift bridge in Port Mayaca. The line then continues to follow the lake a short distance before turning northwest to a point known as Marcy. The line crosses CSX&#x27;s Auburndale Subdivision at Marcy before continuing northeast directly to Fort Pierce, where it connects to the FEC.

====East side history====
When the FEC ran the east side, it referred to the line as their K Branch. It was the southernmost segment of the FEC&#x27;s Kissimmee Valley Line to Lake Okeechobee, which originally branched off the FEC main line near New Smyrna Beach and ran south through the Kissimmee Valley. It reached Belle Glade by 1923, and was extended to the Miami Canal in Lake Harbor in 1929 to connect with the Atlantic Coast Line. Most of the Kissimmee Valley Line north of Marcy was abandoned in 1947, and the remaining track was connected to the FEC main line by way of a new track from Fort Pierce known as the Glades Cutoff. The SCXF began leasing the east side line from the FEC on March 2, 1998, and now fully operates the line from milepost K 15 (Cana) south, and has trackage rights into FEC&#x27;s Fort Pierce Yard where the interchange takes place.

==Sugar Express==

In late 2016, U.S. Sugar reacquired USSC No. 148, a 4-6-2 steam locomotive that they previously owned from 1952 to the 1970s. U.S. Sugar originally bought it from the FEC, which ran the locomotive on its Key West Extension. After being reacquired from the Denver and Rio Grande Historical Foundation in Monte Vista, Colorado and a three-year restoration work performed by the FMW Solutions, the No. 148 locomotive now runs on recycled vegetable oil and began its first revenue service, pulling the last cane train of the 2019–2020 harvest season on May 28, 2020.
The South Central Florida Express now runs the No. 148 locomotive as part of USSC&#x27;s heritage tourist passenger train named the &quot;Sugar Express&quot;. During the summer months of 2021, U.S. Sugar acquired an ex-Wabash turntable from St. Louis, Missouri, which will eventually be used to turn the No. 148 locomotive around at Clewiston. In need of rolling stocks for the &quot;Sugar Express&quot;, U.S. Sugar initially leased the Georgia 300 observation car. They also acquired an ex-Pennsylvania Railroad lounge car renamed from &quot;William Penn&quot; to &quot;Palmdale&quot;, along with an ex-Santa Fe and Amtrak baggage car converted into an open-air car and named the &quot;Miami Locks&quot;. Additionally, USSC acquired three ex-Great Northern Railway passenger cars and an ex-Pennsylvania Railroad observation car from the United Railroad Historical Society of New Jersey and the Galveston Railroad Museum, respectively. All of the rolling stock will be repainted in an Illinois Central &quot;City of Miami&quot; homage livery. U.S. Sugar also purchased a second 4-6-2 steam locomotive, Atlantic Coast Line 1504 from the North Florida Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society in Jacksonville, Florida, which will become part of the Sugar Express after it is restored to operating condition. They even acquired a former New Georgia Railroad auxiliary tender from the Southeastern Railway Museum in Duluth, Georgia, to supply extra water for both the Nos. 148 and 1504 locomotives.

On December 12, 2021, the Sugar Express ran its first public excursion, featuring the No. 148 locomotive pulling the &quot;Lake Placid Limited&quot; train from Clewiston to Lake Placid and back. On January 29-30, 2022, U.S. Sugar and Trains Magazine hosted a private photo charter of the No. 148 locomotive pulling passenger and freight consists. On April 23-25, the No. 148 locomotive participated in taking the American Association of Private Railroad Car Owners&#x27; (AAPRCO) special &quot;Sugarland Limited&quot; train on a multi-day tour around the Lake Okeechobee counties. Sugar Express continues to operate a full season of events, including special holiday train events for Lake Placid, Sebring, and Clewiston, Florida, as well as short trips and all-day excursions in and around the Lake Okeechobee region. In 2024, USSC leased a former FEC observation car the &quot;Bay Biscayne&quot; from the East Tennessee Railcar.

<doc id="1234380" wikidata="Q156834" url="?curid=1234380" title="Nerine sarniensis">
<text>Nerine sarniensis, commonly known as Guernsey lily or Raquel is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaryllidaceae. It is the type species of the &quot;Nerine&quot; genus. It is widely cultivated in the temperate world and is particularly associated with the island of Guernsey, as reflected in both its Latin and common names (&quot;sarniensis&quot; means &quot;from Guernsey&quot;), though it does not originate there, nor is it a true lily (it is more closely related to &quot;Amaryllis&quot; and &quot;Sternbergia&quot;). It is native to the Northern and Western Cape Provinces of South Africa, though it is now naturalized in France, Madeira and the Azores.

&quot;Nerine sarniensis&quot; is a bulbous perennial growing to tall by wide, with strap-shaped leaves and umbels of scarlet, lily-like flowers with conspicuous stamens tipped with purple anthers, in late summer and early autumn.

In cultivation &quot;N. sarniensis&quot; requires winter protection in colder areas. Nerine lily is known among florists as one of the longest lasting cut flowers.

<text>Silverbird is the debut solo studio album by English singer-songwriter Leo Sayer. It was originally released in November 1973 by Chrysalis (UK), and Warner Bros. (US). It was co-produced by former British pop teen idol Adam Faith and David Courtney.

Sayer began his career as a recording artist under the management guidance of Adam Faith and David Courtney who signed Sayer to the Chrysalis label in the UK and Warner Bros. Records in the USA. His debut single &quot;Why Is Everybody Going Home&quot; failed to chart, but he shot to national prominence in the UK with his second single, the plaintive music hall-styled song &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, which Sayer memorably performed on British television wearing a pierrot costume and make-up. The single went quickly to No. 2 on the UK chart, as did this debut album, for which Courtney and Sayer wrote all eleven tracks.

==Recording==
The recording of &quot;Silverbird&quot; was a difficult and somewhat experimental process, Adam Faith and David Courtney had many ideas but no real experience in record production. The writers, Sayer and Courtney, were inspired however and the album started to come together at Virgin Records&#x27; Manor Studios in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire. Further recording took place at the Who&#x27;s lead singer Roger Daltrey&#x27;s Barn Studio, Burwash, East Sussex; Nova Studios and Olympic Studios; and later at the Beatles&#x27; Apple studios. At Daltrey&#x27;s the recording took further shape with the team creating, amongst others, the unique &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;.

<text>The T3D (&quot;Torus, 3-Dimensional&quot;) was Cray Research&#x27;s first attempt at a massively parallel supercomputer architecture. Launched in 1993, it also marked Cray&#x27;s first use of another company&#x27;s microprocessor. The T3D consisted of between 32 and 2048 &quot;Processing Elements&quot; (PEs), each comprising a 150 MHz DEC Alpha 21064 (EV4) microprocessor and either 16 or 64 MB of DRAM. PEs were grouped in pairs, or &quot;nodes&quot;, which incorporated a 6-way processor interconnect switch. These switches had a peak bandwidth of 300 MB/second in each direction and were connected to form a three-dimensional torus network topology.

The T3D was designed to be hosted by a Cray Y-MP Model E, M90 or C90-series &quot;front-end&quot; system and rely on it and its UNICOS operating system for all I/O and most system services. The T3D PEs ran a simple microkernel called UNICOS MAX.

Several different configurations of T3D were available. The &quot;SC&quot; (Single Cabinet) models shared a cabinet with a host Y-MP system and were available with either 128 or 256 PEs. The &quot;MC&quot; (Multi-Cabinet) models were housed in one or more liquid-cooled cabinet(s) separately from the host, while the &quot;MCA&quot; models were smaller (32 to 128 PEs) air-cooled multi-cabinet configurations. There was also a liquid-cooled &quot;MCN&quot; model which had an alternative interconnect wire mat allowing non-power-of-2 numbers of PEs.

The Cray T3D MC cabinet had an Apple Macintosh PowerBook laptop built into its front. Its only purpose was to display animated Cray Research and T3D logos on its color LCD screen.

The first T3D delivered was a prototype installed at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in early September 1993. The supercomputer was formally introduced on 27 September 1993.

The T3D was superseded in 1995 by the faster and more sophisticated Cray T3E.

<text>.gq is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Equatorial Guinea. 

The .gq registry allows the creation of emoji domain names.

== History ==
The .gq domain was launched in July 1997 by GETESA, the nation&#x27;s prominent internet service provider.

In October 2014, domain company Freenom partnered with GETESA to try a business model which involved giving away .gq domain names for free. 

Before the public launch, there was a sunrise period to allow trademark holders to register their names. Public domain registration commenced on January 1, 2015.

Following Freenom&#x27;s lawsuit with Meta and its settlement in 2024, it is unclear who will take up registration of the domain, as the company announced it would be exiting the domain business.
== Abuse ==
Due to the lack of cost required to obtain a .gq domain, the TLD has been prone to usage for spam, phishing and other malicious purposes. 

A study conducted by internet security company Symantec found that 92% of the top 50 .gq websites were being used for &quot;shady&quot; purposes. 

Out of all of the websites on a .gq domain that were surveyed by Symantec, a whole 98.94% were being used for malicious purposes.

<doc id="1234389" wikidata="Q7783671" url="?curid=1234389" title="They Came from Somewhere Else">
<text>They Came From Somewhere Else is a British sitcom produced by TVS and broadcast on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom in 1984. It pastiches numerous horror films including &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; and &quot;Carrie&quot;.

The single series comprised six thirty-minute episodes starring Robin Driscoll, Rebecca Stevens, Pete McCarthy, and Tony Haase. The writing is credited to &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; and the series was developed from a 1982 theatrical production by Cliffhanger Theatre Company founded by Driscoll, Stevens and McCarthy and Martin McNicholas.
The story is set in the fictional British new town of Middleford where Wendy, Colin and Martin are leading very dull, formulaic lives. The arrival of an American suffering from amnesia coincides with a series of increasingly bizarre events including a rain of liver, people getting sucked into drains, migraines so severe that they cause heads to explode, and zombies taking over the supermarket. The American observes that the town mysteriously contains no children.

Martin believes a strange, radioactive briefcase is behind the town&#x27;s problems. The American has the key to the briefcase and he, Colin and Wendy open it and learn the truth of the situation: Middleford is a 21st-century rehabilitation prison located on a satellite orbiting Earth. The town&#x27;s residents are all inmates who have had their memories and true personalities erased. Colin was the prison&#x27;s designer but later rebelled against the evil nature of system and was sentenced there himself. The American is a pulp fiction writer who had been tasked with writing new personalities for the inmates until his wife, Wendy, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and he has now come to break her out. Unfortunately, his arrival has triggered a B-movie style doomsday scenario based on his book, &quot;The Night it Rained Liver,&quot; and the only way he can stop it and save Wendy from a grisly death is to sacrifice his own life. The series ends with Wendy making her escape, Colin being recaptured and forced to watch as his prison starts receiving child prisoners, and Martin promising retribution after regaining his own identity as a political activist.

The series has not been repeated since its original broadcast, nor released to home video or streaming services, possibly due to copyright issues arising from TVS&#x27;s loss of its ITV franchise and subsequent sale.

<text>Tobias Dantzig (; February 19, 1884 – August 9, 1956) was a Russian-American mathematician, the father of George Dantzig, and the author of &quot;&quot; (1930) and &quot;Aspects of Science&quot; (New York, Macmillan, 1937).

==Biography==
Born in Shavli (then Imperial Russia, now Lithuania) into the family of Shmuel Dantzig (?-1940) and Guta Dimant (1863–1917), he grew up in Łódź and studied mathematics with Henri Poincaré in Paris. His brother Jacob (1891-1942) was murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust; he also had a brother Naftali (who lived in Moscow) and sister Emma.

Tobias married a fellow Sorbonne University student, Anja Ourisson, and the couple emigrated to the United States in 1910. He worked for a time as a lumberjack, road worker, and house painter in Oregon, until returning to academia at the encouragement of Reed College mathematician Frank Griffin. Dantzig received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Indiana University Bloomington in 1917, while working as a professor there. He later taught at Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, and the University of Maryland, College Park.

Dantzig died in Los Angeles in 1956. He was the father of George Dantzig, a key figure in the development of linear programming.

<text>.gr is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Greece. Registrations are processed via accredited registrars and domain names in Greek characters may also be registered.

==Second level domains==

There are five official second level domains:
==Alternative top domain==
Greece applied for the internationalized country code top-level domain (IDN ccTLD) .ελ (.ΕΛ in capital letters) for domain names composed of letters of the Greek alphabet. 

This was turned down by ICANN in April 2011 because it was too visually similar to .EA in Latin letters should ICANN ever implement such a TLD (EA is an exceptionally reserved ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code element for Ceuta &amp; Melilla).

In 2014, ICANN decided to allow Greece to have the domain .ελ. 

The right to this top-level domain was handed over to Greece in October 2015, and it became operational on the Internet on 10 July 2018.

For the first three months, domains already held under .gr as they already were in Latin or Greek letters or transcribed into Greek characters could be obtained for .ελ only by the holder of that .gr domain. Those restrictions ceased to exist in October 2018.

<doc id="1234398" wikidata="Q245286" url="?curid=1234398" title="FIFA U-17 World Cup">
<text>The FIFA U-17 World Cup, founded as the FIFA U-16 World Championship, later changed to U-17 in 1991 and to its current name in 2007, is the annual world championship of association football for male players under the age of 17 organized by &quot;Fédération Internationale de Football Association&quot; (FIFA). The current champion is Germany, which won its first title at the 2023 tournament.

==History==
The tournament was inspired by the Lion City Cup that was created by the Football Association of Singapore in 1977. The Lion City Cup was the first under-16 football tournament in the world. Following FIFA&#x27;s then secretary-general Sepp Blatter&#x27;s recommendation after he was in Singapore for the 1982 Lion City Cup, FIFA created the FIFA U-16 World Championship.

The first edition was staged in 1985 in China, and tournaments have been played every two years since then. It began as a competition for players under the age of 16 with the age limit raised to 17 from the 1991 edition onward. The 2017 tournament which was hosted by India became the most attended in the history of the tournament, with the total attendance of the FIFA U-17 World Cup reaching 1,347,133.

Nigeria is the most successful nation in the tournament&#x27;s history, with five titles and three runners up. Brazil is the second-most successful with four titles and two runners-up. Ghana and Mexico have won the tournament twice.

A corresponding tournament for female players, the FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup, began in 2008, with North Korea winning the inaugural tournament.

==Structure==
Each tournament consists of a group phase, in which four teams play against one another and standings in the group table decide which teams advance, followed by a knockout phase of successive matches where the winning team advances through the competition and the losing team is eliminated. This continues until two teams remain to contest the final, which decides the tournament winner. The losing semi-finalists also contest a match to decide third place.

From 1985 to 2005 there were 16 teams in the competition, divided into four groups of four teams each in the group phase. Each team played the others in its group and the group winner and runner up qualified for the knockout phase. From 2007 the tournament was expanded to 24 teams, divided into six groups of four teams each. The top 2 places in each group plus the four best third-placed teams advanced to the knockout phase.

Competition matches are played in two 45-minute halves (i.e., 90 minutes in total). In the knockout phase, until the 2011 tournament, if tied at the end of 90 minutes an additional 30 minutes of extra time were played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if still tied. Starting with the 2011 tournament, the extra time period was eliminated to avoid player burnout, and all knockout games progress straight to penalties if tied at the end of 90 minutes.

From 2025 the tournament will take place annually and will have 48 participating teams divided into 4 &#x27;mini-tournaments&#x27; of 12 teams. Each mini-tournament is divided into 3 groups of 4, with the winners and best runner up qualifying to a four-team knockout stage. The winners of each of these mini-tournaments would qualify to a &#x27;final four&#x27; tournament with 2 semi-finals, a third place match and a final to decide the FIFA U17 World Champions. Qatar was announced as host on 14 March 2024.

==Qualification==
The host nation of each tournament qualifies automatically. The remaining teams qualify through competitions organised by the six regional confederations. For the first edition of the tournament in 1985, all of the teams from Europe plus Bolivia appeared by invitation of FIFA.

==Results==

===Teams reaching the top four===
:1&quot;includes results representing West Germany&quot;

===Performances by continental zones===

Africa is the most successful continental zone with seven tournament wins (five for Nigeria, two for Ghana) and six times as runner-up. Notably the 1993 final was contested by two African teams, when the final has been contested by two teams from the same confederation. in 2015, a pair of African teams repeated the 1993 final with Mali replacing Ghana (disqualified for age violation), when Nigeria and Mali made it to the last two standing and Nigeria got their sixth win.

South America has three tournament wins and has been runner-up three times: Argentina has finished in third place on three occasions; Chile has done so on one occasion; and Colombia has finished in fourth place twice, but neither of the latter two have ever appeared in the final.

Europe has five tournaments wins (one each for France, USSR, Switzerland, England and Germany) and has been runner-up seven times. Spain has been runner up on four occasions. Additionally Portugal and Netherlands have won third-place medals in 1989 and 2005 respectively.

The CONCACAF zone has two tournament wins (for Mexico in 2005 and 2011). This confederation has reached the final four times (with Mexico).

Asia has one tournament win (for Saudi Arabia in 1989), the only time that a team from this confederation has reached the final and the only time an Asian team won a FIFA tournament in the male category. (&quot;Australia was runner-up in 1999 but at that time was in the Oceania Football Confederation&quot;).

Oceania has no tournament wins and on one occasion was runner up (for Australia in 1999). Australia has since moved to the Asian confederation.

This tournament is peculiar in that the majority of titles have gone to teams from outside the strongest regional confederations (CONMEBOL and UEFA). Of the fifteen editions held so far, nine (60 percent of the total) have been won by teams from North and Central America, Africa and Asia.

<text>Just a Boy is the second album by English singer-songwriter, Leo Sayer, and was released in 1974. It features his interpretations of two songs (&quot;One Man Band&quot; and &quot;Giving It All Away&quot;) written by Sayer and David Courtney for the Who&#x27;s lead vocalist Roger Daltrey&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Daltrey&quot;. Sayer&#x27;s singles &quot;One Man Band&quot; and &quot;Long Tall Glasses&quot; both hit the charts in the UK and around the world. Leo Sayer was now popular in Europe and made many promotional appearances there. He headlined in Paris at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, the venue known as the home of his then-hero, mime artist Marcel Marceau.

==Album cover artwork==
The cover is a painting by Humphrey Butler-Bowden. It is a tribute to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s artwork for his famous novella &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. The album&#x27;s back cover pointedly depicted a group of new Sayers giving Pierrot the elbow.

==Recording==
Adam Faith, David Courtney and Sayer had already started work on the album, cutting &quot;One Man Band&quot; while Sayer was on an American tour. More recording took place in London. This time the recording went smoothly and the right results were quickly accomplished. Some of the songs, like &quot;Long Tall Glasses&quot;, were written in the studio. Roger Daltrey had first recorded Sayer&#x27;s songs, &quot;One Man Band&quot; and &quot;Giving It All Away&quot; on his 1973 debut solo album, &quot;Daltrey&quot;.

A cover of the song &quot;I Can Dance (Long Tall Glasses)&quot; by the Canadian band Shooter hit the Canadian charts the same week as the Sayer original. The Sayer version reached No. 18, where the Shooter version reached No. 22, both on 3 May chart.

<text>Gummite is a yellow amorphous mixture of uranium minerals, oxides, silicates, and hydrates of uranium, derived from the alteration of uraninite. It is named for its luster.

The material has been known by various other names, mostly due to differences in sample origins, including: eliasite from &quot;Elias&quot; – the name of a mine at Jáchymov, coracite – a variety from Lake Superior, pittinite, pechuran, urangummit, and uranogummite.

<doc id="1234417" wikidata="Q1959523" url="?curid=1234417" title="Gerard Croiset">
<text>Gerard Croiset ( Boekbinder; March 10, 1909July 20, 1980) was a Dutch parapsychologist, psychometrist and psychic. He was often asked to help police detectives trace missing persons, though authenticated successes were few, and compared against the failures, his success rate was ruled no better than chance.

==Background==
Croiset was born in Laren, North Holland, in March 1909. He said he began to become aware of his gifts while a youth working for a watch repairer, and that on one occasion he held a ruler belonging to his employer and saw events which he related to his employer and which his employer confirmed were accurate.

==Early work==
After World War II, Croiset was sometimes consulted by Dutch police authorities for cases involving missing persons, or murder. On one occasion he was said to have examined the property of a murdered woman, and provided accurate information relating to her murder, and also gave the name of her murderer. The name matched a man who was being held in connection with the crime. He gained a reputation as a reliable consultant in the area of missing persons, and his fame extended beyond the Netherlands, as anecdotes about his abilities came to be discussed in other countries. He also gained a reputation as a psychic healer, and would allow people to visit him in his clinic for healing sessions.

==Missing persons cases==
In 1966, he was invited to Australia to aid in an investigation relating to the disappearance of the three Beaumont children, who had disappeared without trace from a beach in Adelaide, South Australia. Although police were skeptical, his expenses were paid by the wealthy property tycoon Con Polites, who was interested in the case, and publicity was such that Croiset&#x27;s ideas were thought to be worthy of consideration. During his brief stay in Australia, he attracted widespread publicity but failed to find any trace of the missing children.

In January 1970, Croiset participated in the investigation of the kidnapping of Muriel McKay, the wife of publishing tycoon Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s Deputy Chairman Alick McKay. Croiset was asked by a McKay family friend, Eric Cutler, to help locate her. Croiset said that she was in a white farmhouse in the north or north-east of London, and that nearby to her was another farm and an abandoned aerodrome. He claimed that if she was not found within 14 days she would be dead. Her body was never found. Brothers Arthur and Nazimoodeen Hosein were convicted of her murder—the first case in British history of a murder conviction without a body. In 1978, the Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police hired Croiset to investigate the disappearance of Genette Tate, but he provided no information of value.

In 1972 he was consulted at various times to assist with the location of a missing aircraft presumed crashed in the Andes mountains. His indications proved to be vague and ultimately incorrect. 

Croiset died in Utrecht in 1980, aged 71.

==Evaluation==
Croiset claimed he helped to solve the case of an assault of a girl in Wierden, the Netherlands. The Chief of Police of Wierden stated however, that the information by Croiset was inaccurate and his communications were not used in the case. He was investigated under controlled conditions by The Belgian Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Phenomena Reputed to be Paranormal and they did not find any evidence of psychic ability.

The skeptic James Lett has written:

The Dutch parapsychologist has written Croiset had genuine psychic powers due to the information he had given in police cases. However it was discovered that much of Tenhaeff&#x27;s data was fraudulent.

<text>Robert David Hall is an American actor, best known for his role as coroner Dr. Albert Robbins, M.D. on the television show &quot;&quot;.

== Early life ==
Hall attended Tustin High School in California and went on to graduate from UCLA in 1971 with a degree in English literature. Hall is a former professional musician and accomplished guitarist, and is also proficient on piano, percussion and mandolin. For several years he was a high-profile radio DJ in Los Angeles. His musical talent has been alluded to in &quot;&quot; several times, as his character Dr. Al Robbins would sometimes sing while performing the autopsy or with Gil Grissom when the latter came to the morgue to collect evidence. He has also done extensive voice work on television commercials and cartoons.

In 1978, Hall was critically injured after being involved in a car crash. An 18-wheeler truck struck and crushed his car. The crash also caused the gasoline tank of the car to explode, causing burns over 65% of his body. He almost died in the crash; both of his legs were amputated afterwards. Hall now comfortably uses prosthetic limbs, allowing for personal mobility. Several of his characters, including his &quot;CSI&quot; character, have openly shared this disability. He is a prominent advocate for disabled Americans.

== Life and career ==
In addition to starring on &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot;, Hall has appeared in such films as &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and &quot;The Negotiator&quot; and has made guest appearances in a number of TV programs including &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. He also furnishes the narration on CourtTV&#x27;s documentary series &quot;North Mission Road&quot;. Currently, Hall is working on the short thriller &quot;The Roymann Closure in the Netherlands&quot;, written by writer/director David Grifhorst and executive producer Jop Douma.

Hall was married to Susan Petroni from 1969 until their divorce in 1974, and Connie Cole from 1979 until their divorce in 1987. His son, Andrew, was born of his second marriage. Hall&#x27;s third and current marriage is to Judy Sterns in 1999.

<doc id="1234438" wikidata="Q1652629" url="?curid=1234438" title="Patriarch Job of Moscow">
<text>Job (; died 19 June 1607) was Metropolitan of Moscow and all Rus&#x27;, the primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, from 1587 to 1589, and the first Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus&#x27; from 1589 to 1605.

He was the seventeenth metropolitan in Moscow to be appointed without the approval of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as had been the norm. In 1589, Jeremias II, the patriarch of Constantinople, regularized Job&#x27;s canonical status and raised him to the status of patriarch. 400 years later, the Russian Orthodox Church canonized him in 1989.

==Early life==
His birth name was Ioann (). As a teenager, Ioann knew most of the biblical texts by heart and strove to become a monk. His father, however, insisted that he marry. Once, Ioann asked his father&#x27;s permission to see his confessor in the Uspensky Monastery in their native town of Staritsa near Tver. Upon his arrival in 1551, Ioann immediately took monastic vows and assumed the religious name of Job. 

==Career==
=== Abbot and bishop ===

Job spent fifteen years in the cloister and finally became its abbot in 1566 with the help of Ivan the Terrible, who had made Staritsa his residence during the time of the Oprichnina. According to Debra A. Coulter, &quot;Job was known as a humble man of impeccable morals, learned for his times, who worked for the good of the church and the promotion of Orthodox Christianity.&quot;

In 1571, Job was transferred to Moscow and appointed abbot of the Simonov Monastery. In 1575, he became the abbot of the Novospassky Monastery. In 1581, Job was consecrated as the bishop of Kolomna.

Though a person of mediocre mental abilities, he nevertheless managed to draw the attention of Boris Godunov by his talent for reading the longest of prayers by heart in a very expressive manner. During the reign of Feodor I (whose government was controlled by Boris Godunov), Job was appointed archbishop of Rostov and the metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia in 1587.

===Patriarch of Moscow===

Arguing that ecclesiastic authority in Russia should be strengthened, Godunov managed to persuade Jeremias II, the patriarch of Constantinople, to establish a patriarchate in Moscow. On , Job was consecrated as the first Russian patriarch with the blessing of Jeremias II. In the decree establishing the patriarchate, the whole Russian tsardom is called a &quot;third Rome&quot;. As Feodor was poorly suited to ruling, the diplomacy was left to Godunov.

The residence of the patriarch was established in the Moscow Kremlin, in a building adjacent to the Church of the Twelve Apostles with Byzantine features. In 1590, a council held in Constantinople confirmed the new status of Moscow, and three years later, the four other Orthodox patriarchs ratified this at another council with the support of 42 bishops.

Job did not approve, however, of Godunov&#x27;s proposal to open a university in Moscow staffed with foreign professors because he believed their influence and non-Orthodox faith would spread heterodoxy and endanger the purity of the Russian Church. Under Job&#x27;s supervision, the Russian churchmen corrected books for the divine services and prepared them for publication.

He assisted in the glorification (canonization) of some of the Russian saints, ordering the celebration of the memory of Basil Fool for Christ in 1588, as well as that of Joseph Volotsky and others. Patriarch Job also favored the construction of new cathedrals and monasteries and Christian missionary activities in the recently conquered Astrakhan Khanate and Siberia. He also corresponded with Catholicos Nicholas V of Georgia and exchanged gifts with him. After the mysterious death of Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich in 1591, Job accepted the non-criminal version of his demise, supporting Boris Godunov every step of the way.

In 1591, he headed the official enquiry into the death of Tsarevich Dmitry in Uglich. After consulting with the church council and the duma of boyars, the patriarch announced his verdict – the tsarevich had accidentally stabbed himself and not been murdered. In that year he also founded the Donskoy Monastery in Moscow.

==Civil career==
After the death of Tsar Feodor I and the refusal of his wife, Irina Godunova, to accept the throne, Patriarch Job became the head of state in 1598. As he was much obliged to Boris Godunov for his promotion to the post of patriarch, Job offered his candidature as tsar to the Land Assembly (Zemsky sobor). On 21 February 1598, he headed a religious procession to Boris Godunov at the Novodevichy Convent, imploring him to accept the throne.

Job was known as a harsh critic of False Dmitry I and he tried to persuade the people of Moscow to remain loyal to the deceased tsar. The armed supporters of the impostor burst into the Cathedral of the Dormition and a boyar named P. F. Basmanov declared Job a traitor. Job&#x27;s formal removal from office was on 24 June 1605, when the council announced his retirement because of old age and ill health. The same council announced the grant of the dignity to the Patriarch Ignatius. Job was sent into exile to his monastery in Staritsa, where he went completely blind.

Job was succeeded by Archbishop Ignatius of Ryazan and only returned to Moscow following the murder of False Dmitry I, the imprisonment of Patriarch Ignatius at the Monastery of the Miracle and the accession of Vasili IV of Russia. On 20 February 1607, at the request of Tsar Vasili Shuisky, Patriarchs Hermogen and Job jointly celebrated the Holy Liturgy at the Dormition Cathedral in the Moscow Kremlin, where he forgave the people of Moscow and gave them his blessing.

==Death==
He died a very sick man in 1607. In 1652, Job&#x27;s relics were transferred to the Cathedral of the Dormition of the Moscow Kremlin, where they remain to this day. Patriarch Job was glorified as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1989.

<text>The Córas Iompair Éireann 113 class locomotives were the first mainline diesel locomotives used in Ireland, being built in January 1950 and October 1951 by CIÉ at their Inchicore Works. They were fitted with Sulzer 6LDA28 engines of (uprated to in 1956), with four Metropolitan-Vickers MV157 traction motors. They were of Bo-Bo wheel arrangement, weighed 80 tonnes and had a maximum speed of . They were initially numbered 1100–1101 in the steam locomotive number series (and designated class C2a), but were subsequently renumbered B113–B114 in 1957.

==History==
They were intended for mixed traffic duties, hauling both freight and passenger trains. When they were first introduced, they were used on some of the express passenger duties between Dublin and Cork. However, with the arrival of production diesel locomotives (the 001 and 101 Classes) from 1955, these two locomotives were used more for freight work, mostly in the area around Dublin.

They suffered from a recurring brake fault and following a serious incident in August 1971 when 114 ran away while working a goods train, both locomotives were withdrawn for modifications to be made to their brakes. In fact, 114 was never reinstated and 113 only worked for a few months at the end of 1974 before it too was stored again. Both were then used at Inchicore Works as part of a sound barrier with 101 Class locomotives. B113 was presented to the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum in May 2011, but 114 was not so lucky and was scrapped in March 1995.

==Preservation==

B113 was preserved by Iarnród Éireann at Inchicore works, Dublin, and received a cosmetic restoration there. It was then transferred to the RPSI&#x27;s depot in Whitehead, County Antrim and later taken to the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum for static display in January 2012, along with NIR 101 Class No. 102. The two locos are currently incapable of running under their own power, and so NIR 111 class locomotives 112 and 113 provided motive power for the move.

<text>Finn Harps Football Club is an Irish football club that play in the First Division of the League of Ireland, as of 2023. The club was founded in 1954 and elected to the league in 1969. They hail from Ballybofey, County Donegal and play their home matches at Finn Park in Ballybofey. The club&#x27;s colours are blue and white, and they go by the nickname Harps. The main successes of the club include winning an FAI Cup in 1973–74 and the First Division title in 2004. They also contested the 1999 FAI Cup Final, a second replay of which ended in a narrow defeat, the first replay having been lost to a draw with 30 seconds left to play.

Finn Harps share a local rivalry with Derry City with whom they contest the Northwest Derby.

==History==

===Early years===
Finn Harps was formed in 1954 as a junior club. The club&#x27;s name derives from the river that runs through Ballybofey – the River Finn – and a traditional Irish symbol – the harp. They first came to national prominence by winning the 1968 FAI Junior Cup. This enabled them to compete in the 1969 FAI Intermediate Cup. After they were knocked out of that competition, club directors Fran Fields and Patsy McGowan decided to apply to the League of Ireland for membership. The club was admitted into the senior ranks in May 1969 and played their first senior game against Shamrock Rovers on 17 August 1969. They lost the game 10–2. After initial worries that the club were not of sufficient standard, the club became a considerable force during the 1970s.

===1970s: A decade of dominance===
Finn Harps won their first senior trophy, the Dublin City Cup, in 1971–72, after a goal from club legend and all-time League of Ireland record goalscorer Brendan Bradley defeated Cork Hibernians at Dalymount Park. This was significant as before others had dismissed the idea of Finn Harps in the league. Two years later, Dalymount Park was again the scene as the club secured its first and only FAI Cup win. Two goals from Brendan Bradley and one from Charlie Ferry saw off the challenge of St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic. Finn Harps qualified for European competitions on four occasions during the 1970s. They appeared in the UEFA Cup three times against Aberdeen, Derby County and Everton respectively, after finishing as runners-up in the league. They appeared once in the European Cup Winners Cup, playing Turkish Cup winners Bursaspor. The club was again runner-up in the League of Ireland Cup finals of 1974 and 1975 to Waterford and Bohemians respectively. Through the 1970s, the club never once finished in the bottom half of the table and were widely respected for their attractive and attacking football style. The 1974 final was the first to be broadcast in colour.

===Slow decline===
The 1980s saw a gradual decline of the club when it came to competing against the best in Ireland. An FAI Cup semi-final in 1981 and a League of Ireland First Division Shield final defeat by EMFA were the highlights of the decade for them and by 1985 the club had been relegated to the newly formed First Division. A series of managerial changes occurred over the following few years in an attempt to raise the club&#x27;s status, but signs of improvement did not appear until the early 1990s. Patsy McGowan took over as manager for the third time at the start of the 1992–93 season. The next three seasons saw the club finish in the play-off position twice, though they were beaten both times (once by Cobh Ramblers and once by Athlone Town). The club let McGowan go before his aim of promotion could be completed. Following this the club&#x27;s fortunes improved.

Nevertheless, Finn Harps won promotion at the end of the 1995–96 season, thus bringing an end to end their 11-season spell in the First Division. During the summer of 1996, a consortium of businessmen offered to take control of the club, but - when their offer was rejected - the manager and certain members of the club committee resigned. The club appointed Charlie McGeever as manager and, despite time being against him, he managed to assemble a squad for the opening of the 1996–97 season. By the season&#x27;s conclusion, he had ensured that the club&#x27;s Premier Division status was retained. Off the field, the remaining committee members set the club up as a co-operative society, selling shares to the ordinary supporters, to ensure that the club would be owned and run by the people whom they felt would truly care about it. A long-term blueprint for the future was put in place.

In 1998–99, Finn Harps finished fourth in the Premier Division; one point behind Shelbourne in third position and just missed out on Europe. They made it to the 1999 FAI Cup Final but lost to Bray Wanderers after a number of replays, leaving themselves with nothing to show (bar the Irish News Cup) for what is considered to be one of their most impressive seasons. After a very poor start to the 1999–00 season, and with the team having won one point from a possible 21, McGeever resigned as manager. The club appointed Gavin Dykes as manager and, though he managed to retain the club&#x27;s Premier Division status, they were forced to go public company due to financial difficulties and debts amounting to £280,000. The following season, and after an abysmal run of results, Dykes resigned. Fan-favourite Jonathan Speak took his place as new financial structures were put into place and a newly appointed fund-raising committee established along with numerous supporter clubs around the country. However, after a run of 14 games undefeated and a late-season fightback, Finn Harps were ultimately relegated to the First Division on the last day of the season. This ended a five-year run in the top flight.

===The yo-yo years===
Speak&#x27;s first full season in charge saw the club finish second to Drogheda United in the First Division, thus securing them a play-off place for promotion. Longford Town beat them on penalties. The following season saw the club finish third and lose at the play-off semi-final stage to Galway United. Speak managed to hold most of the squad together, despite their top-scorer Kevin McHugh (who formed a successful forward partnership with English striker Damien Whitehead) attracting the interest of several Premier Division clubs. Considered bookmaker&#x27;s favourites to lift the 2003 title and win promotion, Finn Harps began well but fell to fourth position after having gone without a win for a month by mid-September. This poor run included a home-loss to the neighbouring northwest club Sligo Rovers and a home-draw against league leaders Dublin City, the latter game billed as a must-win match. Despite losing only two games for the entire season, the nine draws cost Speak his job. Speak&#x27;s assistant, Sean McGowan, took temporary charge until a suitable placement was found and steadied the club with two wins from two. Approaching the final third of the season, the club appointed Noel King as manager. They were rejuvenated and stormed back to the top of the First Division table with a club record-equalling six wins on the trot. With only four games remaining, Finn Harps led the table by a point but losses away to Bray Wanderers and Dublin City handed the title to Dublin City and left Finn Harps in the now-dreaded playoffs once again. They disposed of Bray Wanderers in the semi-finals but lost in the final to local rivals Derry City, who had finished ninth in that season&#x27;s Premier Division.

Noel King lasted six games into the 2004 season before leaving the club by mutual consent, with the amount of travelling the Dubliner had to endure being cited as one of the main reasons for his departure. Sean McGowan, his assistant, once again took charge for two games but within ten days the club announced a shock replacement. Felix Healy, the former Derry City player and manager who had won all domestic major honours with his home-town club, would be the new manager. Fans viewed this as a bold move by the Finn Harps board of directors, considering Healy&#x27;s history with the club&#x27;s fiercest rivals. However, Healy - in the club&#x27;s golden jubilee year - won the club&#x27;s first First Division title and achieved the promotion to the Premier Division that had eluded so many managers before him. However, the following season saw the club struggle in the Premier Division and Harps sacked Healy in July. Anthony Gorman agreed to become player-manager until the end of the season. However, at the season&#x27;s end and with Finn Harps relegated again, Gorman agreed to take the position on a full-time basis only to leave following the 2006 season as his efforts to lead the club to promotion failed. In 2007, after Paul Hegarty took charge of managing the team, financial difficulties that had nearly bankrupted the club some seasons earlier became more prevalent so the club - struggling in the lower half of the First Division - put all players on sale. The 2007 season started sluggishly with a number of defeats and &quot;bore draws&quot; (notably against Monaghan United), but a lengthy unbeaten run left the club in second place in the league, only one point behind Cobh Ramblers. They emerged as victors over Dundalk from the first round of the First Division play-off, with a 2–0 win. The first leg of the final play-off round against Waterford United ended at Finn Park with Harps taking a 3–0 advantage to the Waterford RSC ahead of the return leg, which ended 3–3. Thus, Harps secured promoted to the Premier Division 6–3 on aggregate.

In 2008, Harps began the conversion from a semi-professional, part-time club to a full-time setup over the off-season, with 16 full-time players on the books as of the opening day of the season. The conversion succeeded but relegation beckoned once again for the club, this time on the final day. Though they won their game, Galway United&#x27;s win sealed the fate of Harps. In 2009, Finn Harps played in the FAI First Division, on a semi-professional basis once again. On 11 May 2009, Paul Hegarty left the club, citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;. James Gallagher replaced Hegarty as manager. On 3 May 2011, Peter Hutton took over as manager, while former Northern Ireland international and fellow former Derry City player Felix Healy also arrived to take the role of club director of football. Following the final home game of the 2013 season (a 3–2 win against champions Athlone Town), Hutton announced his resignation as manager.

===Rejuvenation and the &#x27;Ollie Years&#x27;===
On 25 November 2013, the club named Galway native and former Fanad United manager Ollie Horgan as manager for the 2014 season.

In his first season in charge, Horgan led the club to an FAI Cup semi final for the first time in 15 years, before being beaten by Premier Division side St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic in Richmond Park. The 2015 season concluded with Finn Harps securing promotion to the League of Ireland Premier Division by beating Limerick 2–1 on aggregate in a famous relegation/promotion playoff, the second leg of which occurred on 6 November 2015. Against all the odds, Horgan managed to keep Finn Harps in the Premier Division in 2016, however, in their second season back in the top flight they were relegated once again. They spent 2018 in the First Division, achieving immediate promotion - again at the expense of Limerick in the relegation/promotion play-off, though this time on a 3-0 aggregate score.

2019 saw another relegation battle, as Harps defeated Drogheda United in the relegation play-off game in Finn Park to retain their Premier Division status for 2020.

2019-20 marks Harps&#x27;s fiftieth season in the League of Ireland.

In a COVID-19 disrupted 2020 season, Harps again managed to avoid the drop, with a last day of the season win against Waterford F.C. securing their place in the Premier Division again under Horgan, in what was his seventh season in charge of Harps.

The 2021 season got off to a good start with Adam Foley securing a win over Bohemians. May 2021 would see Finn Harps get their first ever away success over Derry City at league level.

The end of the Horgan era for Finn Harps came at the end of the 2022 season, with the departure of manager Ollie Horgan and relegation from the Premier Division. This ended a long spell of years in the Premier Division, with six out of seven seasons spent at the top tier of Irish football for the club.

===New beginnings===
On 2 December 2022, Finn Harps unveiled Dave Rogers as their new manager, on a full-time four-year contract.
Ten days later, Darren Murphy was announced as Rogers new full time assistant manager.
After a disastrous 2023 season on the pitch, Finn Harps parted company with Dave Rogers on 23 September, with assistant manager Darren Murphy placed as interim manager until the end of the season, himself assisted by Tommy Canning and Kevin McHugh.

On 3 November 2023, Harps announced the appointment of Darren Murphy to become the Head Coach for the upcoming season. In his first pre-season match, Harps secured a 2–2 draw in front of the home crowd against Derry City.

Under Darren Murphy, the team had a good start to the season, peaking at 2nd place in the early stages but came short to the play-off places to Bray Wanderers in the 2024 season.

==Stadium==
Finn Harps play at Finn Park in Ballybofey, County Donegal. Finn Park is formed mainly of open terracing surrounding the football pitch. In 2005, the terraces were renovated for health and safety reasons as new concrete surfaces replaced the old viewing slopes. In total, the ground&#x27;s capacity accommodates approximately 6,000 spectators. The stadium has one covered stand, which also caters for 350 seated supporters. The area allocated to supporters of visiting teams is the terrace opposite the seated stand (situated in the Shed End). The pitch dimensions measure 110 yards in length by 80 yards in width. Sitting on the banks of the River Finn, Finn Park is prone to waterlogging in times of wet weather.

===New stadium===
The club planned to move to a new covered 6,600 all-seater stadium just across the River Finn in Stranorlar. The proposal would also feature an FAI Regional Development Centre. Club shareholders gave the club&#x27;s board a mandate in 2005 to proceed with the stadium plans. Planning permission was obtained in mid-2005. Approval to proceed to tender was obtained from the Football Association of Ireland in early 2006 and local developers, Joseph McMenamin and Sons, won the tender process and had their tender approved a year later. Finn Harps received funding of €750,000 in 2007 to commence works at the new stadium. They hoped to be in the new stadium for the 2013 season. Work ceased on the new stadium due to the recession and lack of funds. Work was expected to resume on the stadium in early 2011 but in the end it did not restart until late 2014.

Revised plans were unveiled in May 2022, showing a 6,130 capacity ground, with all four sides covered, and a seating capacity of 3,330.

==Colours and crests==

The traditional colours of Finn Harps are blue and white. The club played in white jerseys and blue shorts upon entry into the League of Ireland. Their away strip was all green. Since that time Harps have played in either white or blue jerseys as their primary colour and used green, yellow or white as their away colours. In the 1975/76 and 1976/77 Harps wore blue and white stripes and repeated this during 1983/84 and 1984/85.

Harps kits and training gear is currently manufactured by Joma Sports, and the club&#x27;s jerseys are sponsored by The Kernan Group, with Marley&#x27;s Travel sponsoring the back. The third kit is currently sponsored by Bluestack Foundation, who is the current Charity Partner. The current home strip is made up of a blue jersey with white stripes, blue shorts and socks with the home goalkeeping kit being green jersey with green shorts and green socks. The current away strip consists of a white jersey with black collared trim, black shorts and black socks, the away goalkeeping kit is made up of a green jersey, green shorts and green socks. Harps current third kit is made up of a mix of colours ranging from blue to purple, with purple shorts and socks. The current third kit is in a partnership with The Bluestack Foundation. The third goalkeeping kit consists of a black jersey with black shorts and black socks.

Finn Harps have sported various crests throughout their history. All, largely circular in composition, have featured a harp and new designs have essentially been modernised updates of the previous crest. The harp has traditionally been a symbol of Ireland. Footballs have also been a common feature.

The modern stylised crests contain the club&#x27;s name in a Gaelic-style font, similar to the Gandalf typeface.

For the club&#x27;s golden jubilee year, 2004, they introduced a new golden crest which was very similar to their early crest. Bar this crest, blue, green and white have been common colours used.

In 2010, Finn Harps decided to play in an all-white kit due to demand from supporters after they wore an all-white kit against Shelbourne to celebrate 40 years in the League of Ireland in 2009. They reverted to blue home kits in 2011.

For the 2021 season, Joma sport has been announced as the jersey partner.

==Supporters==
Finn Harps supporters share a rivalry with their north-west neighbours, Derry City. The most exciting encounter between the two sides was perhaps the 2003 relegation play-off between the two sides. A Brandywell Stadium packed with both sets of fans witnessed a Finn Harps side managed by Noel King (a former Derry City manager) lose a highly charged affair that finished 2–1 to Derry after an extra-time goal from Derry City favourite, Liam Coyle. A rivalry is maintained between the two clubs, yet both have encountered times of trouble in recent years. One team has often been helped by the other in this regard. Harps&#x27; other main derby is with southern neighbours Sligo Rovers. Harps have a good relationship with Shamrock Rovers. The clubs have provided financial assistance to each other in the past and both sets of supporters socialise together when the clubs play one another. The club&#x27;s anthem &quot;The Finn Harps Song&quot; can often be heard being sung by the club&#x27;s supporters and its lyrics &quot;they follow them in Donegal, Derry and Tyrone&quot; illustrates that the main core of the Harps support comes from the North West of Ireland.

==Rivalries==
Finn Harps and Derry City share what is called the Northwest Rivalry. It has been hotly contested since Derry entered the League in 1985. The close proximity of the two Ulster clubs, being only 30 miles apart, has contributed to the rivalry. The strong contrast between the two clubs, Rural/Urban and the gulf in success, has aided the rivalry. Both sets of fans can be frequently heard singing songs about each other. Many players have played for both clubs, such as José Mukendi, but the most notable of whom is Kevin McHugh. Finn Harps also share a rivalry with Sligo Rovers due to the proximity of the clubs. Although this rivalry is viewed as important, the Derry rivalry is seen as more important by Harps fans.

<text>The Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (PBC; ) or Palestine Public Broadcasting Corporation ( ), also known as Palestine TV, was established on 1 July 1994 and is within the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority.

PBC has a subsidiary radio station known as the Voice of Palestine and a satellite channel known as Palestinian Satellite Channel. Palestine TV first began broadcasting in 1996 in Gaza.

==History==
The first head of the PBC was Fatah activist and Arafat loyalist Radwan Abu Ayyash, former head of the Arab Journalists&#x27; Association. PBC had a terrestrial television network, comprising channel 5 in Naplose, channel 21 in Khan Younis, channel 21 in Jericho (very low power), channel 23 in Kasser-Elhakim, channel 25 in the capital Ramallah, channel 30 in Halhul, channel 31 in Jenin and channels 4 and 34 in Betjala. The channel in its early years broadcast twelve hours a day, up to eighteen hours on holiday periods.

On 19 January 2002, the Israel Defense Forces used explosives to destroy the five-story main building and transmission tower of the PBC in Ramallah claiming retaliation for the killing of six people by a Palestinian gunman linked to Fatah. The Israeli Government later singled out PBC for broadcasting material deemed to be anti-Semitic or that incited violence.

The broadcasting corporation is a former European Broadcasting Union associate member, and was alleged to have held negotiations with the European Broadcasting Union to become a full active members. However, Palestine is not a member of the required organisations, and thus does not comply with the criteria. Currently, the broadcaster is a member of the Arab States Broadcasting Union (ABSU).

==Financing==
The PBC was funded partially by the US government until 1998. In 2010, the President of the State of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas issued a decree converting the PBC into a public institution.

<text>James M. Jenness (born 1946) is the chairman of the board and former CEO of the Kellogg Company, succeeding Carlos Gutierrez after President George W. Bush nominated Gutierrez to become Secretary of Commerce on November 29, 2004. Jenness was CEO until December 31, 2006, when he was succeeded by David MacKay.

A native of Chicago, Illinois, Jenness received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in marketing and an MBA from DePaul University. He was a long-time employee of the Leo Burnett advertising agency, eventually becoming vice-chairman and chief operating officer. In 1997, Jenness left Leo Burnett to become CEO of the retail consultancy Integrated Merchandising Systems in Chicago. He resigned as its CEO upon being named CEO at Kellogg.

Although regarded by some as an outsider to Kellogg, Jenness has had a long association with the company. His first assignment at Leo Burnett in 1974 was an advertising campaign for the &quot;Special K&quot; brand of cereal. Since then, he worked on campaigns for most of Kellogg&#x27;s brands. He was named to Kellogg&#x27;s board of directors in July 2000.

<text>Endless Flight is the fourth album by English singer-songwriter Leo Sayer, which was released in 1976. It was released in the US and Canada by Warner Bros. Records and in the UK by Chrysalis Records.

The album consolidated his international popularity, reaching No. 4 in the UK and No. 10 in the US; it also charted strongly in other countries including Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand, and was certified as a platinum album in both the UK and the US, and double-platinum in Canada. The peak of his career came in 1977, when he scored two consecutive US number one hits, first with the disco-styled &quot;You Make Me Feel Like Dancing&quot; (a Grammy Award winner for the year&#x27;s best Rhythm and Blues Song), followed by the romantic ballad, &quot;When I Need You&quot; (1977), which reached number one in both the UK and US. Written by Albert Hammond and Carole Bayer Sager, it was Sayer&#x27;s first UK No. 1 single (after three number two hits). It was also the first of two UK chart-toppers in a row for producer Richard Perry.

<doc id="1234469" wikidata="Q2072385" url="?curid=1234469" title="Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani">
<text>Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani (; 17 September 1932 – 23 October 2016) was the Emir of Qatar from 27 February 1972 until he was deposed by his son Hamad bin Khalifa in a coup on 27 June 1995.

He died during the reign of his grandson, the current Emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

==Early years==
Sheikh Khalifa was born in Doha in 1932. He was the son of Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani and grandson of Emir Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani.

==Career==
In 1957, Khalifa was appointed Minister of Education. Then, he was appointed Deputy Emir. He was named as the heir apparent on 24 October 1960. In the 1960s, he also served as Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.

On 22 February 1972, Sheikh Khalifa became the Emir of Qatar, seizing power from his cousin, Emir Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani in a bloodless coup d&#x27;état. While many Western news outlets referred to it as an overthrow, the Qatari population merely considered it to be a succession of power. His initial activity was the process of the reorganization of the government. He also limited the financial privileges of members of the ruling family. Next, he appointed a foreign minister and an adviser to himself regarding the day-to-day affairs. On 19 April 1972, he amended the Constitution and expanded the Cabinet by appointing more ministers. Diplomatic relations were also established with a number of foreign countries at the
ambassadorial level.

Khalifa&#x27;s reorganization of the system of government saw a dramatic shift in the hierarchy of authority. He immensely reduced the traditional powers afforded to the heir-apparent while projecting all of the power onto himself.

On 18 July 1989, the cabinet was reshuffled for the first time, replacing most of the previous ministers and making it consist of 15 ministers. The Cabinet was again reshuffled under his premiership on 1 September 1992, expanding it to 17 members.

The state revenue from the oil sector had increased as the result of the rising of a number of production sharing agreements with foreign oil companies. Two production-sharing agreements were signed with the Standard Oil Company of Ohio in January 1985 and Amoco in February 1986. In January 1989, another production sharing agreement was signed between Qatar and the French state-owned oil company Elf Aquitaine. In the middle of 1991, production of gas in the Qatar North Field, the world&#x27;s largest single field of non-associated gas (proven gas reserves of around 250 trillion cubic feet and probable reserves of 500 trillion cubic feet), commenced. While the search for finding more oil deposits in Qatar continued, Qatar built an industrial base in order to reduce dependence on the oil sector.

==Dethronement and death==
While Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani was staying in Geneva, Switzerland, in June 1995, his son Hamad bin Khalifa seized power in another bloodless coup d&#x27;état. 
The son accused his father of treason and demanded that Interpol arrest him. The former Emir charged his father with 4 counts that include his execution.
Khalifa lived in France until he returned to Qatar in 2004. He died on 23 October 2016 at the age of 84.

==Marriages and children==
Sheikh Khalifa had five sons and twelve daughters from four wives.

<text>Bleach bypass, also known as skip bleach or silver retention, is a chemical effect which entails either the partial or complete skipping of the bleaching function during the processing of a color film. By doing this, the silver is retained in the emulsion along with the color dyes. The result is a black-and-white image over a color image. The images usually have reduced saturation and exposure latitude, along with increased contrast and graininess. It usually is used to maximum effect in conjunction with a one-stop underexposure.

== Technique ==
Bleach bypass can be done to any photochemical step in the process, be it original camera negative, interpositive, internegative or release print. For motion pictures, it is usually applied at the internegative stage, as insurance companies usually are reluctant to have the camera negative bleach bypassed, or the interpositive (a &quot;protection&quot;/&quot;preservation&quot; element), in the event that the look is agreed to be too extreme, and the cost of the process for each individual release print is most often cost-prohibitive. The effect, however, will render slightly differently at each stage, especially between the camera negative and interpositive stages.

Bleach bypass generally refers to a complete circumvention of the bleach stage of development, and is the most commonly offered service among laboratories. Technicolor&#x27;s ENR and OZ and Deluxe Labs&#x27; ACE and CCE processes are proprietary variants which allow the film to be only partially bleached, giving the cinematographer a more finely tuned control over the effect rendered by the process.

While originally a laboratory technique, a similar effect can also be achieved digitally through digital intermediate color grading.

== Use in film and television ==

&quot;Bleach bypass&quot;, as used in this context, was first used in Kon Ichikawa&#x27;s film &quot;Her Brother&quot; (1960). Kazuo Miyagawa, as Daiei Film&#x27;s cameraman, invented bleach bypass for Ichikawa&#x27;s film, inspired by the color rendition in the original release of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1956), printed using dye-transfer Technicolor, and was achieved through the use of an additional black-and-white overlay. Actually, this is a throw-back to pre-1944 Technicolor, which incorporated a silver-containing &quot;blank receiver&quot; with the silver image printed from the green separation negative, but at 50% density, upon which the color dyes were imprinted by utilizing &quot;imbibition&quot;; this concept may have been employed here, but at a different density.

Despite this early foray into the technique, it remained overlooked for the most part until its use by Roger Deakins for the movie &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

The effect has subsequently become a regular development tool in laboratory work, and has remained in widespread use. Practitioners include cinematographers Rodrigo Prieto, Remi Adefarasin, Darius Khondji, Dariusz Wolski, Walter Carvalho, Oliver Stapleton, Newton Thomas Sigel, Park Gok-ji, Shane Hurlbut, Steven Soderbergh (as &quot;Peter Andrews&quot;), Tom Stern, Vittorio Storaro, and Janusz Kamiński (notably on Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Minority Report&quot;).
