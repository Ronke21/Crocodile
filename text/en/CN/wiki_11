<text>Attila is a popular masculine name in Central and Eastern Europe, Southeastern Europe and Western Asia. Primarily in Hungary, Turkey and Chuvashia. Attila is the most used version in Hungary, however another version of Attila is Atilla and Etele, the female equivalent of which is Etelka. Attila is used as Atilla in Turkish.

==Etymology==
It has been traditionally claimed that the name Attila is formed from Gothic &quot;atta&quot; meaning &quot;father&quot;, through the diminutive suffix -&quot;ila&quot;, the &quot;little father&quot;. Related names are not uncommon among Germanic peoples of the period, i. e. Ætla, Bishop of Dorchester. The Gothic etymology was proposed by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm in the early 19th century. Tom Shippey argued that the Gothic etymology is a product of 19th century Germanic romantic philological revisionism.

Otto Maenchen-Helfen, who considered Gothic etymology, noted that Hunnic names were &quot;not the true names of the Hun princes and lords. What we have are Hunnic names in Germanic dress, modified to fit the Gothic tongue, or popular Gothic etymologies, or both&quot;.

Hyun Jin Kim noted Attila has more natural and probable Turkic etymology. Omeljan Pritsak considered &quot;̕Άττίλα&quot; (Attila) a composite title-name which derived from Turkic *&quot;es&quot; (great, old), and *&quot;t il&quot; (sea, ocean), and the suffix /a/. The stressed back syllabic &quot;til&quot; assimilated the front member &quot;es&quot;, so it became *&quot;as&quot;. It is a nominative, in form of &quot;attíl-&quot; (&lt; *&quot;etsíl&quot; &lt; *&quot;es tíl&quot;) with the meaning &quot;the oceanic, universal ruler&quot;. Peter Golden, citing Pritsak, like László Rásonyi connected Attila&#x27;s name with a note by Menander in which the term &quot;Attilan&quot; was used as the name of the Volga River (Turkic &quot;Atil/Itil&quot;; &quot;great river&quot;). J.J. Mikkola connected it with Turkic &quot;āt&quot; (name, fame). Gerd Althoff considered it was related to Turkish &quot;atli&quot; (horseman, cavalier), or Turkish &quot;at&quot; (horse) and &quot;dil&quot; (tongue).

In 2015, he became the second tight end and ninth player overall to record 100 career touchdown receptions.

==Early life==
Gates was born in Detroit, where he played high school football at Central High School.

==College career==
Gates played basketball rather than football in college. He originally enrolled at Michigan State University wanting to play football under then-coach Nick Saban as well as basketball under coach Tom Izzo. Upon enrolling, he learned that Saban wanted him to play only football. Gates then chose to pursue playing basketball by transferring to Eastern Michigan University. He played there part of a season before transferring to the College of the Sequoias, a junior college in California, to focus on academics. Recruited by Stan Heath, Gates transferred to Kent State University in northeastern Ohio.

As a member of the Golden Flashes, Gates played two seasons as power forward. In his junior season he averaged 16.0 points, 8.1 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game.

As a senior, Gates received honorable mention All-American honors from the Associated Press after averaging 20.6 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game. He finished with a record of 54–16 in two years of playing.

His jersey number, 44, was retired on February 27, 2010, making him just the fourth Golden Flash to receive the honor.

==Professional career==
After being told by scouts that he was too much of a &quot;tweener&quot; to make the NBA, Gates () arranged a workout in front of NFL scouts. Despite never having played college football, as many as 19 teams were believed to have contacted Gates about a tryout. Gates chose to work out first for the San Diego Chargers. Recognizing his potential, the Chargers immediately signed him to a contract as an undrafted free agent.

===2003===
Lost in the disappointment of San Diego&#x27;s league-worst 4–12 record was Gates&#x27; rise from third string to starter. He made his first catch in Week 4 against the Oakland Raiders, scored his first touchdown in Week 10 against the Minnesota Vikings, and enjoyed his first 100-yard receiving game (117 yards) against the Green Bay Packers in Week 15. Gates caught 24 passes for 389 yards and two touchdowns as a rookie. His 16.2 yards per reception were the highest of his career.

===2004===
Gates started off the 2004 season strong with eight receptions for 123 receiving yards in a 27–20 victory over the Houston Texans. In Week 5, he had two receiving touchdowns in a 34–21 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. In Week 8, against the Oakland Raiders, he had another game with two receiving touchdowns in the 42–14 victory. In the following game, he recorded three receiving touchdowns in a 43–17 victory over the New Orleans Saints. Gates had his third consecutive game finding the endzone in the next game against the Oakland Raiders with an eight-catch, 101-yard day in the 23–17 victory. In the following game, against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had two receiving touchdowns in the 34–31 victory. A preferred target of quarterback Drew Brees, Gates finished his second season in the NFL with 81 receptions for 964 yards and 13 touchdowns.

On December 19, Gates tied the NFL single season record for touchdown receptions by a tight end (12) in a 21–0 win over the Cleveland Browns. He went on to break this record in an overtime loss to the Indianapolis Colts on December 26.

Gates was selected to the 2005 Pro Bowl and earned first team All-Pro honors. Gates scored a touchdown in the Wild Card Round overtime loss to the New York Jets.

===2005===
On August 23, 2005, after holding out for a contract extension, Gates signed a six-year deal worth up to $24 million with the San Diego Chargers. Because of his holdout, Gates was suspended for one game–the home opener against the Dallas Cowboys, a loss. In Week 8, against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had ten receptions for 145 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns in the 28–20 victory. In the following game, he had eight receptions for 132 receiving yards in the 31–26 victory over the New York Jets. In Week 14, he had 13 receptions for 123 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in the 23–21 loss to the Miami Dolphins.

Gates went on to have another stellar season, catching 89 passes for 1,101 yards and 10 touchdowns, but the Chargers missed the playoffs by a single win. He was named to the Pro Bowl and earned first team All-Pro honors.

===2006===
With the departure of Drew Brees during the offseason, it was assumed that Gates would suffer a decline in production in 2006, with first-year starter Philip Rivers at the helm. Gates had a relatively quiet start to the season, but he finished the year strongly and ended up with 924 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. He caught two touchdown passes on December 10 in a 48–20 victory the Denver Broncos to help the Chargers clinch their division.

Gates was a Pro Bowler and All-Pro for the third straight year. Undefeated at Qualcomm during the regular season, the Chargers and their fans anticipated a trip to the Super Bowl but they were beaten by the New England Patriots at home by the score of 24–21 in the Divisional Round.

===2007===
Gates started off the 2007 season with nine receptions for 107 yards and a touchdown in the 14–3 victory over the Chicago Bears. In Week 3, he had 11 receptions for 113 receiving yards against the Green Bay Packers. In Week 5, against the Denver Broncos, he had seven receptions for 113 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown in the 41–3 victory. In Week 8 against the Houston Texans and in Week 12 against the Baltimore Ravens, he had two receiving touchdowns in each game.

For his 2007 season, Gates was selected to the Pro Bowl. During the season, he caught 75 passes for 984 yards and nine touchdowns. He was once again a key factor during the Chargers&#x27; 11–5 campaign, but not during the playoffs. Gates dislocated a toe on his right foot just before the postseason, which slowed him down during the Chargers&#x27; playoff run.

Gates was not the only Chargers star player injured: both LaDainian Tomlinson and Philip Rivers had leg injuries which hindered the Chargers&#x27; chances of reaching the Super Bowl. However, the Chargers did eventually play in the AFC Championship, which they lost 21–12 to the New England Patriots.

===2008===

Gates said he was leaning toward having surgery to repair a dislocated left big toe that slowed his performance during the 2007–08 NFL playoffs, but was undecided on whether to have surgery or not, &quot;There is higher chance I&#x27;m going to have surgery&quot;. Gates also pulled out of his fifth Pro Bowl selection because of his injuries alongside his teammate LaDainian Tomlinson. Gates finished the season with 60 receptions for 704 yards and eight touchdowns.

On February 23, 2008, Gates said he would have foot surgery to fix the injury that had slowed him in the final part of the season. He would face a 4–6 month recovery time. Gates seemed questionable for Week 1 and even sounded worried about his status for the opening day of the 2008 season; however, he ended up playing every game despite complaints that his toe was bothering him during the first half of the season.

===2009===
In Week 4, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Gates had nine receptions for 124 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 38–28 loss. In Week 12, against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had seven receptions for 118 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 43–14 victory. In the following game, he had a season-high 167 receiving yards on eight receptions in the 30–23 victory over the Cleveland Browns. He closed the season out with four consecutive games with a receiving touchdown. Finally healthy after consecutive injury-plagued seasons, Gates enjoyed the most productive year of his career. He caught 79 passes for a career-high 1,157 yards and eight touchdowns. He was named to his sixth consecutive Pro Bowl.

The team finished the year with 13 wins, one of the best records of the year. However, they were eliminated in their first postseason game by the New York Jets in the Divisional Round.

===2010===
Gates began the 2010 season by signing a five-year, $36 million contract with $20 million guaranteed. In Week 2, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he recorded two receiving touchdowns in the 38–13 victory. In Week 4, against the Arizona Cardinals, he had seven receptions for 144 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 41–10 victory. In the first nine games of the 2010 season, he had 40 receptions and nine touchdowns.

Despite being limited by foot injuries throughout the second half of the 2010 season, Gates earned a Pro Bowl selection for his seventh consecutive year; however, as a result of his lingering injuries, Gates did not participate in the game. He was ranked 22nd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

===2011===
Gates tried to play through his chronic foot problems but was forced to sit out Weeks 3–5. He came back after the bye week and started every game the rest of the way. In Week 14, against the Buffalo Bills, he had two receiving touchdowns in the 37–10 victory. He finished with more than 60 catches (64) for the seventh time in his career. He also scored seven touchdowns and was voted into his eighth Pro Bowl. Gates became the Chargers&#x27; all-time receptions leader on a six-yard catch on a fourth-and-5, early in the fourth quarter against Detroit. It was his 587th career catch, surpassing Charlie Joiner&#x27;s 586.

===2012===
In Week 6, Gates had two receiving touchdowns in a 35–24 loss to the Denver Broncos, on a night where the Chargers held a 24–0 halftime lead. Gates had another record-breaking season, becoming the fifth tight end in NFL history with 600 career catches and runner-up for most touchdowns in Chargers franchise history with 83. The tight end and his quarterback Philip Rivers connected for a total of 56 touchdown catches, the most out of any quarterback-tight end combination in the NFL. He was ranked 73rd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.

===2013===
Gates had two games on the season going over the 100-yard mark, Week 2 against the Philadelphia Eagles and Week 4 against the Dallas Cowboys. played all 16 games for the first time since 2009, finishing with 70 receptions (77) for the fourth time in his career.

In Week 2, against the Seattle Seahawks, Gates had three receiving touchdowns in the 30–21 victory. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against Seattle. Gates passed Lance Alworth to become the Chargers&#x27; career leader in receiving yards in Week 7 against the Denver Broncos. In the season&#x27;s final game against the Kansas City Chiefs, he became the fourth tight end in NFL history to surpass 10,000 yards in career receiving yards. He finished the season with 12 touchdowns, becoming the fourth player in league history to catch 12 or more touchdowns in a season at age 34. His teammates voted him the Chargers&#x27; Offensive Player of the Year and he was invited as an alternate for the Pro Bowl, but declined. He was ranked 52nd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.

===2015===
On July 2, 2015, it was announced that Gates would be suspended for the first four games of the 2015 season for violating the NFL&#x27;s rules on performance enhancing drugs (PEDs). On October 12, 2015, against the Pittsburgh Steelers in his first game back after from a four-game suspension, Gates scored his 100th and 101st career touchdown receptions. He finished the season with 630 yards and five touchdowns on 56 receptions. On March 9, 2016, Gates signed a two-year contract extension to remain with the Chargers.

===2016===
Gates played in 14 games in 2016, starting nine. The emergence of rookie tight end Hunter Henry affected Gates&#x27;s production. He caught 53 passes for 538 yards and scored seven touchdowns. His 10.3 yards per reception and 57% completion percentage were the lowest of his career.

===2017===
In Week 2, against the Miami Dolphins, he caught his 112th career touchdown pass, which set a new NFL record for most touchdowns as a tight end. Following the emergence of second-year tight end Hunter Henry as a starter, Gates only started four games and finished with 30 receptions for a career-low 316 yards and three touchdowns.

On April 27, 2018, the Chargers informed Gates they would not be bringing him back for the 2018 season.

===2018===
On September 2, 2018, Gates re-signed with the Los Angeles Chargers following an injury to Hunter Henry. In Week 4, against the San Francisco 49ers, he scored his first receiving touchdown of the season. He finished the 2018 season with 28 receptions for 333 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in 16 games and one start.

In what would be his final NFL game, Gates recorded a receiving touchdown in the 41–28 loss to the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round.

===Retirement===
Gates announced his retirement on January 14, 2020. He ended his career with a record 116 touchdown catches by a tight end, including 89 thrown by Rivers for the most ever by a quarterback–tight end duo at the time. He also finished as the Chargers&#x27; franchise leader in receptions (955) and receiving yards (11,841).

In 2020, Gates announced he was joining the Los Angeles Chargers front office as Legends Ambassador.

<text>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn is the seventh studio album by American band Bright Eyes, released on January 25, 2005 by Saddle Creek Records, the same day as their sixth album &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot;. It peaked at number 15 in the US and 43 in the UK. In US it has sold 268,000 units. In 2007 it was awarded a gold certification from the Independent Music Companies Association, which indicated sales of at least 100,000 copies throughout Europe. In contrast to the acoustic nature of &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot;, &quot;Digital Ash in a Digital Urn&quot; is more electronic.

Upon release in 2004, the singles &quot;Take It Easy (Love Nothing)&quot; from &quot;Digital Ash in a Digital Urn&quot; and &quot;Lua&quot; from the album &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot; debuted in the top two slots on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Single Sales chart.

The album was reissued by Dead Oceans alongside a six-track companion EP on November 11, 2022.

==Tour==
After the chart success of the 2004 singles &quot;Lua&quot; and &quot;Take It Easy (Love Nothing)&quot;, the band set off in 2005 on a two-part world tour to promote both &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot;, and &quot;Digital Ash in a Digital Urn&quot;. The first half of the tour promoted the folk-influenced first album, and the latter half featured the more electronic second album. Both records made it into the Top 20 of the Billboard album charts. The tour was captured on &quot;Motion Sickness&quot;, released later in the year.

The album features contributions from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs&#x27; Nick Zinner and the Postal Service&#x27;s Jimmy Tamborello.

<doc id="1231522" wikidata="Q1660153" url="?curid=1231522" title="Biological immortality">
<text>Biological immortality (sometimes referred to as bio-indefinite mortality) is a state in which the rate of mortality from senescence (or aging) is stable or decreasing, thus decoupling it from chronological age. Various unicellular and multicellular species, including some vertebrates, achieve this state either throughout their existence or after living long enough. A biologically immortal living being can still die from means other than senescence, such as through injury, poison, disease, predation, lack of available resources, or changes to environment.

This definition of immortality has been challenged in the &quot;Handbook of the Biology of Aging&quot;, because the increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age may be negligible at extremely old ages, an idea referred to as the late-life mortality plateau. The rate of mortality may cease to increase in old age, but in most cases that rate is typically very high.

The term is also used by biologists to describe cells that are not subject to the Hayflick limit on how many times they can divide. 

==Cell lines==

Biologists chose the word &quot;immortal&quot; to designate cells that are not subject to the Hayflick limit, the point at which cells can no longer divide due to DNA damage or shortened telomeres. Prior to Leonard Hayflick&#x27;s theory, Alexis Carrel hypothesized that all normal somatic cells were immortal.

The term &quot;immortalization&quot; was first applied to cancer cells that expressed the telomere-lengthening enzyme telomerase, and thereby avoided apoptosis—i.e. cell death caused by intracellular mechanisms. Among the most commonly used cell lines are HeLa and Jurkat, both of which are immortalized cancer cell lines. These cells have been and still are widely used in biological research such as creation of the polio vaccine, sex hormone steroid research, and cell metabolism. Embryonic stem cells and germ cells have also been described as immortal.

Immortal cell lines of cancer cells can be created by induction of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressor genes. One way to induce immortality is through viral-mediated induction of the large T-antigen, commonly introduced through simian virus 40 (SV-40).

==Organisms==
According to the Animal Aging and Longevity Database, the list of animals with negligible aging (along with estimated longevity in the wild) includes:
* Blanding&#x27;s turtle (&quot;Emydoidea blandingii&quot;) – 77 years
* Olm (&quot;Proteus anguinus&quot;) – 102 years
* Eastern box turtle (&quot;Terrapene carolina&quot;) – 138 years
* Red sea urchin (&quot;Strongylocentrotus franciscanus&quot;) – 200 years
* Rougheye rockfish (&quot;Sebastes aleutianus&quot;) – 205 years
* Ocean quahog clam (&quot;Arctica islandica&quot;) – 507 years
* Greenland shark (&quot;Somniosus microcephalus&quot;) - 250 to 500 years

===Bacteria and some yeast===
Many unicellular organisms age: as time passes, they divide more slowly and ultimately die. Asymmetrically dividing bacteria and yeast also age. However, symmetrically dividing bacteria and yeast can be biologically immortal under ideal growing conditions. In these conditions, when a cell splits symmetrically to produce two daughter cells, the process of cell division can restore the cell to a youthful state. However, if the parent asymmetrically buds off a daughter only the daughter is reset to the youthful state—the parent is not restored and will go on to age and die. In a similar manner stem cells and gametes can be regarded as &quot;immortal&quot;.

===Hydra===

Hydras are a genus of the Cnidaria phylum. All cnidarians can regenerate, allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Hydras are simple, freshwater animals possessing radial symmetry and contain post-mitotic cells (cells that will never divide again) only in the extremities. All hydra cells continually divide. It has been suggested that hydras do not undergo senescence, and, as such, are biologically immortal. In a four-year study, 3 cohorts of hydra did not show an increase in mortality with age. It is possible that these animals live much longer, considering that they reach maturity in 5 to 10 days. However, this does not explain how hydras are subsequently able to maintain telomere lengths.

===Jellyfish and comb jellies===
&quot;Turritopsis dohrnii&quot;, or &quot;Turritopsis nutricula&quot;, is a small () species of jellyfish that uses transdifferentiation to replenish cells after sexual reproduction. This cycle can repeat indefinitely, potentially rendering it biologically immortal. This organism originated in the Caribbean Sea, but has now spread around the world. Key molecular mechanisms of its rejuvenation appear to involve DNA replication and repair, and stem cell renewal, according to a comparative genomics study.

Similar cases include hydrozoan &quot;Laodicea undulata&quot;, scyphozoan &quot;Aurelia&quot; sp.1 and tentaculata &quot;Mnemiopsis leiydi&quot;

===Lobsters===

Research suggests that lobsters may not slow down, weaken, or lose fertility with age, and that older lobsters may be more fertile than younger lobsters. This does not however make them immortal in the traditional sense, as they are significantly more likely to die at a shell moult the older they get.

Their longevity may be due to telomerase, an enzyme that repairs long repetitive sections of DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as telomeres. Telomerase is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages but is generally absent from adult stages of life. However, unlike vertebrates, lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity. Contrary to popular belief, lobsters are not immortal. Lobsters grow by moulting, which requires considerable energy, and the larger the shell the more energy is required. Eventually, the lobster will die from exhaustion during a moult. Older lobsters are also known to stop moulting, which means that the shell will eventually become damaged, infected, or fall apart, causing them to die. The European lobster has an average life span of 31 years for males and 54 years for females.

===Planarian flatworms===

Planarian flatworms have both sexually and asexually reproducing types. Studies on genus &quot;Schmidtea mediterranea&quot; suggest these planarians appear to regenerate (i.e. heal) indefinitely, and asexual individuals have an &quot;apparently limitless [telomere] regenerative capacity fueled by a population of highly proliferative adult stem cells&quot;.

For sexually reproducing planaria: &quot;the lifespan of individual planarian can be as long as 3 years, likely due to the ability of neoblasts to constantly replace aging cells&quot;. Whereas for asexually reproducing planaria: &quot;individual animals in clonal lines of some planarian species replicating by fission have been maintained for over 15 years&quot;.

<text>Thomas Henderson Docherty (24 April 1928 – 31 December 2020), commonly known as The Doc, was a Scottish football player and manager. Docherty played for several clubs, most notably Preston North End, and represented Scotland 25 times between 1951 and 1959. He then managed a total of 13 clubs between 1961 and 1988, as well as the Scotland national team. Docherty was manager of Manchester United between 1972 and 1977, during which time they were relegated to the Second Division but promoted back to the First Division as champions at the first attempt.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Born in Shettleston Road in Glasgow&#x27;s east end, Docherty began his playing career when he joined junior football club Shettleston. The turning point in his playing career came in 1946 when he was called up for national service in the Highland Light Infantry. While completing his national service, Docherty represented the British Army at football. On demobilisation, he was offered a contract with Celtic in 1947. Docherty would later say that Jimmy Hogan, the club&#x27;s coach, was his greatest influence.

In November 1949, after spending over two years with Celtic, he moved to England and joined Preston North End. With them he won the 1951 Second Division title and got to the 1954 FA Cup Final. Altogether Docherty made close to 300 appearances for the club. He left Deepdale in August 1958 to join Arsenal for £28,000 (£ today). With them he made 83 appearances, scoring once. He then went to play for Chelsea where he brought an end to his playing career in 1962.

===International===
At Preston, Docherty received the first of his 25 full Scotland international caps. His solitary goal came in a 7–2 defeat by England in 1955. He was part of the Scotland squads that played at the 1954 and 1958 FIFA World Cup finals which were held in Switzerland and Sweden, respectively.

==Managerial career==
===Chelsea===
In February 1961, Docherty was offered the post of player-coach of Chelsea. Less than twelve months later, upon Ted Drake&#x27;s departure and with the club facing relegation from the top flight, Docherty took over as manager. He was unable to keep the club in the First Division and the team was relegated at the end of the 1961–62 season.

During his first year in charge he sold many of the club&#x27;s older players and brought in new ones such as Terry Venables, Bobby Tambling, Peter Bonetti and Barry Bridges. He also changed the club&#x27;s home colours, switching from white shorts to blue shorts, the combination that remains as of 2022. The team, nicknamed &quot;Docherty&#x27;s Diamonds&quot;, achieved promotion back to Division One in their first attempt and finished fifth the following year. In 1964–65, Chelsea won the League Cup in April with an aggregate win over Leicester City, but in the FA Cup were beaten 2–0 in the semi-final by eventual winners Liverpool. In that season the club finished third in the league which is the best performance since 1954–55, the season Chelsea won their first league title.

Docherty led Chelsea to the FA and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-finals a year later, before reaching the FA Cup Final in 1967, which they lost to Tottenham Hotspur. He resigned in October 1967. The core of the team Docherty had put together, including Peter Osgood, Charlie Cooke, Ron Harris, Bonetti and John Hollins, went on to win the FA Cup and Cup Winners&#x27; Cup under Docherty&#x27;s successor, Dave Sexton. A decade later Sexton succeeded Docherty as manager of Manchester United.

===Rotherham, QPR, Aston Villa, Porto and Scotland===
The month following his departure from Chelsea, Docherty became manager of Rotherham United. He said of his year there: &quot;I promised I would take Rotherham out of the Second Division – and I took them into the Third. The old chairman said &#x27;Doc, you&#x27;re a man of your word!&#x27;&quot; He was then appointed manager at Queens Park Rangers, only to leave 29 days later after arguing with the club chairman over transfer policy. He then became Doug Ellis&#x27; first manager at Aston Villa in December 1968, for 13 months. On 19 January 1970, with Aston Villa bottom of the Second Division, Docherty was sacked.

From there he went to Porto, where he stayed for 16 months before resigning in May 1971, having failed to usurp Benfica and Sporting CP. On 2 July 1971, he was appointed by Hull City as assistant manager to Terry Neill, but on 12 September he left to become the caretaker manager of Scotland, with that position becoming permanent in November 1971. Scotland were on course to qualify for the 1974 World Cup under Docherty, having won both of their matches against Denmark in qualification Group 8. Docherty managed 12 Scotland games, the last of which was a 2–0 home win against the Danes in November 1972. He left the job a month later and was succeeded by Willie Ormond, who secured qualification for the World Cup by winning a home match against Czechoslovakia in September 1973.

===Manchester United===
In December 1972, Docherty attended a match that Manchester United lost 5-0 to Crystal Palace; in the Selhurst Park boardroom afterwards he was offered the Manchester United job by Matt Busby. His first game in charge of United was against Leeds United at Old Trafford. The game finished 1–1, with Ted MacDougall scoring one of his few goals for United. Although United were in serious trouble when he took them over, because of an ageing squad, he managed to keep them in the First Division in 1972–73. The 1973–74 season saw United continue to struggle and they were eventually relegated to the Second Division.

In the following season, United returned to the top flight as Second Division champions. In 1975–76 they finished in third place in the First Division and also reached the 1976 FA Cup Final, but lost 1–0 to Southampton who were then in the Second Division. Docherty led United to the FA Cup final again in 1977, this time as underdogs, and beat league champions Liverpool 2–1.

Shortly afterwards news that Docherty was having an extramarital affair with the wife of a United physiotherapist, Mary Brown, became public. He was sacked in a blaze of publicity in July 1977 and replaced at Old Trafford by Dave Sexton, the same man who had followed him into the manager&#x27;s office at Chelsea. The affair also resulted in the end of his marriage to Agnes, who had been his wife since December 1949. In 1988, Docherty married Mary, and the couple remained together until his death in 2020. After his sacking, Docherty had a frosty relationship with the club.

===Later career===
Docherty became manager at Derby County in September 1977, where he stayed for two seasons before resigning in May 1979. His next appointment was at Queens Park Rangers in May 1979. When he took over at Loftus Road, Rangers had been relegated to the Second Division (three years after almost winning the league title) and he had to lift the team&#x27;s spirits to start the new season. QPR finished the season four points short of promotion to the First Division. In May 1980, Docherty was sacked by chairman Jim Gregory, then reinstated after just nine days away. In October 1980, he was sacked for the second time in five months.

This was followed by a short spell in Australia coaching Sydney Olympic in 1981. He returned to England in July that year to manage Preston North End, where he had spent nine years as a player. He left after a few months, returning to Australia to manage South Melbourne until the following year. He also managed Sydney Olympic again in 1983.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===

Docherty returned to England once more with Wolverhampton Wanderers just after their relegation from the First Division in 1984. He was sacked just over a year later, however, when Wolves had suffered a second successive relegation, eventually going on to suffer a third relegation in a row the season after Docherty&#x27;s departure.

Docherty&#x27;s time at Wolves was to be a tough task. The club had once been three times champions of England in the 1950s and had also hosted Honved under the floodlights at the Molineux Stadium in 1954, pioneering the way for European club football. They had since gone on to be finalists in the 1972 UEFA Cup and winners of the 1980 League Cup where Andy Gray scored the winning goal after setting a British transfer record when signing for the club.

The club Docherty was taking over as Manager was far away from the historic club Wolves had once been with the chairman in 1978 bankrupting the club with the rebuilding of the Molineux Street stand. A rescue package had to be brought in place during 1982, with the club just hours away from going out of business it was purchased by the Bhatti Brothers, two Saudi Arabian businessmen with help from club legend Derek Dougan.

The brothers were property developers and wanted to develop the land around the stadium but when the council did not grant them permissions they sought to build a supermarket adjacent to the Molineux stadium. Relationship with the club soured and the club was receiving no investment and involvement from the brothers.

Following relegation from the top flight the previous season, several key players left the club, including goalscorers Mel Eaves and Wayne Clarke, as well as Tony Towner and second highest club appearance holder Kenny Hibbitt.

&quot;Tommy Docherty came in as manager and he knew I didn&#x27;t want to be around to see the club in such dire straits&quot;, commented Hibbitt when interviewed on his thoughts on leaving Wolves.

Docherty would also have problems leading into the season with first choice goalkeeper John Burridge, who was making demands of the club but instead of meeting these, Docherty promoted 17 year academy player Tim Flowers into goal, where he remained for the season with Burridge also leaving the club.

The 1984-85 season began at home to Sheffield United in front 14,908 fans. After a good start to the season, later progress started to slowly disintegrated and the club found themselves bouncing around position 13th - 15th position in the table by November.

Wolves were misfiring but despite this, Docherty allowed defender Geoff Palmer, having played 394 times for the club, to move to Burnley. Palmer was a very experienced defender and with him leaving, this left a far less experienced team to that which had finished the previous season. Palmer left the club believing he had fallen out if favour with Docherty and cited that &quot;the club just wasn&#x27;t a nice place to be at the time, it wasn&#x27;t being run properly, and was on its knees.&quot;

Shortly afterwards, Wolves endured a 21-match winless run in all competitions (19 of those in the Second Division). Pressure was mounting in January 1985 and former fan favourite and now Chairman Derek Dougan eventually resigned from his position on the board.

The season performances would also see the club be beaten 5-1 on three occasions. Two were televised live on ITV and the other away at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on the day the club were officially relegated. Docherty&#x27;s final game at home was against Huddersfield Town, where Wolves secured just their eighth victory of the season in front of only 4,422 fans. Wolves finished the season bottom of the table and Docherty left the club in July 1985.

When asked about his time at Wolves Docherty said: &quot;I could hardly say &#x27;no&#x27; when a club as famous as that came in for me... But it was a hopeless task really. There was no money. I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d be able to work with Derek Dougan but I accepted the challenge anyway. As for the Bhattis, I only met them twice – once when they hired me and once when they fired me&quot;.

Docherty took up his final managerial position at Altrincham. He retired from management at the end of the 1987–88 season.

==Personal life==
Docherty married his first wife, Agnes, in December 1949, after he left his native Scotland to sign for Preston North End. They were married for 27 years until Docherty announced his affair with Mary Brown in 1977. Docherty and Agnes had four children together: Mick (himself a former professional footballer and manager), Thomas Jr., Catherine and Peter. After marrying Mary Brown, he had two more children – daughters Grace and Lucy – who were born during the 1980s. Agnes died in September 2002 at the age of 73. In 2008, Tommy Docherty Jr. released a book, &quot;Married to a Man of Two Halves&quot;, which was based on memoirs and newspaper cuttings which he had discovered when clearing out his mother&#x27;s house after her death.

Docherty died on 31 December 2020, aged 92, following a long illness.

<text>The Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) is a scheme developed in 1970 by the American Institute of Physics (AIP) for classifying scientific literature using a hierarchical set of codes. PACS has been used by over 160 international journals, including the &quot;Physical Review&quot; series since 1975. Since 2016, American Physical Society introduced the PhySH (Physics Subject Headings) system instead of PACS.

== Discontinuation ==
AIP has announced that &quot;PACS 2010&quot; will be the final version, but it will continue to be available through their website. The decision was made to discontinue PACS, owing to the administrative complexity of the revision process and its future viability in light of changing technological and research trends. However, PACS is still in use by scientific journals.

In association with Access Innovations, Inc., the AIP has developed a new &quot;AIP Thesaurus&quot;, which it states will enable faster, more accurate and more efficient searches.

<doc id="1231529" wikidata="Q5141631" url="?curid=1231529" title="Coins of the Philippine peso">
<text>Philippine peso coins are issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas for circulation in the Philippines and are currently available in seven denominations. The Philippine peso has been in use since Spanish rule.

==History==

The Philippine peso is derived from the &quot;Spanish dollar&quot; or &quot;pieces of eight&quot; brought over in large quantities by the Manila galleons of the 16th to 19th centuries. From the same &quot;Spanish peso&quot; or &quot;dollar&quot; is derived the various pesos of Latin America, the dollars of the US and Hong Kong, as well as the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen.

===Pre-Hispanic era===
Gold was an important medium of exchange in the various territories of pre-Hispanic Philippines, in the form of stamped gold beads called &quot;piloncitos&quot; and gold barter rings. The original silver currency unit was the &quot;rupee&quot; or &quot;rupiah&quot; (known locally as &quot;salapi&quot;), brought over by trade with India and Indonesia. The &quot;salapi&quot; continued under Spanish rule as a &quot;teston&quot; worth four &quot;reales&quot; or half a Spanish peso.

===Spanish administration===
The Spanish silver peso worth eight &quot;reales&quot; was first introduced by the Magellan expedition of 1521 and brought in large quantities by the Manila galleons after the 1565 conquest of the Philippines; see &quot;Spanish dollar&quot;. The local &quot;salapi&quot; continued under Spanish rule as a half-peso coin. Additionally, Spanish gold &quot;onzas&quot; or eight-&quot;escudo&quot; coins were also introduced with identical weight to the Spanish dollar but valued at 16 silver pesos.

Until the Manila mint was established in 1857 the Philippines had no money of its own. Gold and silver coins brought to it by Spain, China and neighboring countries were in circulation. Denominations consisted of
* In gold &quot;escudos&quot;: , 1, 2, 4, 8 escudos; each escudo worth approximately 2 silver pesos or 16 reales.
* In silver &quot;reales&quot;: , 1, 2, 4, 8 reales; one peso equals 8 reales.
* In copper: , 1, 2 &quot;cuartos&quot;; 20 cuartos in a real and 160 cuartos in a peso.

The &quot;Casa de Moneda de Manila&quot; (or Manila mint) was founded in 1857 in order to supply smaller Philippine currency after the California gold rush of 1848 made silver more expensive and drained the colony of silver and small gold coins. It produced the following denominations according to Spanish standards, with 100 &quot;centimos&quot; equal to a peso:
* In gold: 1, 2, 4 pesos; the 4 pesos weighing 6.766 grams of 0.875 fine gold
* In silver: 10, 20, 50 centimos; the 50 centimos weighing 12.98 grams of 0.9 fine silver (fineness reduced to 0.835 in 1881)

The dearth of pre-1857 copper coins were addressed by counterfeit two-cuarto coins (worth 1/80th of a peso) made by Igorot copper miners in the Cordilleras. In 1897 Spain brought over 1-peso silver coins as well as 5 and 10 &quot;centimos de peseta&quot; to be accepted by Filipinos as 1 and 2 &quot;centimos de peso&quot;.

===United States administration===
The United States also struck coins for use in the Philippines from 1903 to 1945. Denominations included the centavo, one centavo, five centavo, 10 centavo, 20 centavo, 50 centavo, and one peso. The and 1 centavo coins were struck in bronze, the 5 centavo struck in copper (75%) - nickel (25%), the 10, 20, 50 centavo and peso coins were struck in a silver composition. From 1903 to 1906, the silver coins had a silver content of 90%, while those struck after 1906 had a reduced silver content of 75% for 10 through 50 centavos and 80% for the peso. In both cases the silver was alloyed with copper.

The obverse of these coins remained largely unchanged during the years 1903 to 1945. The centavo, one centavo, and five centavo coins depict a Filipino man kneeling against an anvil, with a hammer resting at his side. He is on the left side (foreground), while on the right side (background) there is a simmering volcano, Mt. Mayon, topped with smoke rings. This figure is an allegory for the hard work being done by the native peoples of the Philippines in building their own future.

The obverse of the 10, 20, 50 centavo, and peso coins are similar, but they show the figure of Liberty, a standing female figure (considered by many to be the daughter of the designer &#x27;Blanca&#x27;) in the act of striking the anvil with a hammer. This was done to show the work being done by Americans in building a better Philippines. Liberty appears on the silver coins, instead of the base metal coins.

The reverse of the coins comes in two varieties. The earliest coins were minted when the islands were a US Territory, and they bear the arms of the US Territories. This is a broad winged eagle, sitting atop a shield divided into two registers. The upper register has 13 stars, and the lower register has 13 vertical stripes. The date appears at the bottom, and &quot;United States of America&quot; appears at the top.

When the islands became a US Commonwealth, the arms of the Commonwealth were adopted. This seal is composed of a much smaller eagle with its wings pointed up, perched over a shield with peaked corners, above a scroll reading &quot;Commonwealth of the Philippines&quot;. It is a much busier pattern, and widely considered less attractive.

Coins were minted at the Philadelphia, San Francisco, Denver, and (after it was opened in 1920) Manila mints. Most of the coins struck at the Manila mint occurred after 1925.

Proof sets were struck for collectors from 1903 to 1908. It is likely that a large majority of these sets remained unsold at the time they were issued. The recorded mintage for sets in 1905, 1906, and 1908 is a modest 500.

Defenders of Corregidor threw a large number of silver coins into the ocean, rather than allow the Japanese to accumulate this wealth. A great deal of the booty was later recovered, but many of those were badly corroded.

Among the rarest coins in the U.S. Philippines series from the collectors&#x27; standpoint are the 1906-S One Peso, the 1916-S Five Centavos, the 1918-S Five Centavo Mule, the 1903-S Twenty Centavos (especially in Mint State) and the 1915-S One Centavo.

Three Commemorative coins were minted to celebrate the Commonwealth in 1936. They show President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon and U.S. High Commissioner Frank Murphy, who also has served as the last Governor General of the Islands. The 50 Centavo commemorative has a reported mintage of 20,000 pieces, was struck in 75% silver, and weighs 10 grams (the same specifications as other 50 centavos). The two varieties of One Peso commemorative had reported mintages of 10,000 pieces. They weigh 20 grams, and are 90% silver.

====Culion leper colony coinage====
The Culion leper colony was established in May 1906 by the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands in Culion Island, Palawan. It was modeled after the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement in Molokai, Hawaii. It was issued its own Special Culion Currency due to the erroneous belief that leprosy could be transmitted via handling of money. Only inmates of the colony were allowed to use what was commonly known as &quot;leper money.&quot; It was prohibited for inmates to use regular Philippine currency, and it was prohibited for non-lepers to use the Culion currency. The first and second issues (1913 and 1920) were struck in aluminum by the Frank &amp; Co. die establishment. All subsequent issues were minted by the newly reopened Manila Mint. The third issue (1922) was also aluminum, but the fourth, fifth, and sixth issues (1925, 1927, and 1930) were in copper-nickel alloy. The sixth issue was the final issue. In total, around 169,000 coins were struck for the Culion leper colony, between 1913 and 1930.

By the 1920s, the segregation laws were relaxed. Non-leper settlers (locally known as &quot;sano&quot;) started coming into the island, mostly family members of the thousands of inmates who were forcibly relocated to the island during via the segregation program. However, exchange of money between the leper inmates and the non-leper settlers was still prohibited. In 1942, during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in World War II, Culion was cut off from Manila, leading to a shortage of currency. The local Culion authorities issued an emergency currency printed on paper, with centavo denominations in pink paper and peso denominations in blue paper. The Japanese later attacked the island and destroyed its port, radio tower, and electricity generators, cutting off all supplies and contact to the island. This resulted in widespread starvation that resulted in 2,000 deaths. People who fled the island were also killed. It wasn&#x27;t until 1945 that the US Army Air Corps was able to drop supplies on the island by parachute.

After independence, the segregation law was revised to allow private home isolation and treatment, removing the need for a leper colony. By the 1980s, multi-drug therapies had reduced the status of leprosy to a treatable disease. In 2006, it was declared a leprosy-free area by the World Health Organization. The currency is discontinued but remains popular among coin collectors.

===After Philippine independence, 1946-1994===
After the granting of independence to the Philippines in 1946, no coins were minted for the Philippine Republic until 1958, other than a small silver commemorative issue in 1947 to honor General Douglas MacArthur. A total of 200,000 50 centavos and 100,000 one peso coins were minted with the general&#x27;s image on the obverse and the national coat-of-arms on the reverse. Struck at the San Francisco Mint, they carry the &quot;S&quot; mintmark below the date.

In 1958, the 20 centavos was replaced with a 25 centavos and all coins were resized to be the same diameter as their US equivalents, albeit in more base metals, other than the centavo. The same seated man with anvil and volcano or standing liberty with anvil and volcano designs were retained for the obverses while the seal of the Central Bank of the Philippines dominated the reverse. These coins were minted by the Philadelphia Mint from 1958 through 1963, and then by the Royal Mint in England and the Vereinigte Deutsche Metallweke in West Germany in 1965 (dated 1964) and 1966. In view of all subsequent issues using the Tagalog language, this coinage is often referred to as the English Series since it uses the English language.

The next series was introduced in 1967, introducing images of various Philippine national heroes, and the use of the Tagalog (or &quot;Pilipino&quot;) language, hence being called the Pilipino Series. The sizes of the coins were reduced. These coins were struck by the various US mints, except for some 50 centavos pieces dated 1972 which were minted in Singapore, and a couple commemorative issues struck by the Sherritt Mint in Canada. In 1972 the one peso denomination was reintroduced.
In commemoration of Fedinand Marcos&#x27; declaration of Martial Law (which he titled &quot;Ang Bagong Lipunan,&quot; the new society), a new series of coinage was issued in 1975, referred to as the Ang Bagong Lipunan Series. The 50 sentimo was done away with as a denomination and a new 5 peso issue took its place. A variety of mints provided these coins, including the Royal Mint in England and the Vereinigte Deutsche Metallweke in West Germany, Philadelphia and San Francisco mints in the US, the Franklin Mint (a private mint also in the US), the Sherritt Mint in Canada, and finally the Philippine&#x27;s own mint, once it was opened and able to produce coinage. From this point on, the Philippine Mint (Bangko Sentral Pilipinas, &quot;BSP&quot;) produced nearly all Philippine coinage.

After eight years, the Ang Bagong Lipunan series gave way to a new series titled the Flora and Fauna Series, in which the coins, in addition to featuring various Philippine national heroes as before, also began featuring various plant and animal life forms native to the Philippines. The 50 sentimo and 2 piso denominations were reintroduced, which latter had not been struck as a coin since the Spanish had struck it in gold. The 5 piso denomination was stopped, but resumed (in a new smaller size) concurrent to the final four years of the Improved Flora and Fauna Series which featured reduced sizes for all denominations. The Flora and Fauna Series was struck from 1983 through 1994.

===Philippine issues since 1995===

In 1995, the new BSP Series was introduced, which is still circulating today. Only this current series of coins are legal tender since May 1, 2020, when the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas demonetized the commemorative coins under the Flora and Fauna series. Coins under this series originally included 1, 5, 10 and 25-sentimo, 1-piso and 5-piso. A bimetallic 10-piso coin was added in 2000 to replace the 10-piso note the following year in 2001.

Recently, fake 10 and 5-piso coins dating 2001 and 2002 have entered circulation. Because of this, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas issued a warning and several security measures on importing and falsifying Philippine coins. And it is because the BSP has announced that there is an artificial shortage of coins last June 2006. The BSP has asked the public to use all small coins or to have them exchanged for banknotes in local banks or other financial institution.

Denominations worth 25 sentimo (~US$0.005) and below are still issued but have been increasingly regarded as a nuisance. Proposals to retire and demonetize all coins less than one peso in value have been rejected by the government and the BSP.

On November 29, 2017, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas announced the release of the first coin in the New Generation Currency Series for circulation starting December 2017. As a tribute to the 154th birth anniversary of Andres Bonifacio, the first coin to be released was the new silver-colored 5-peso coin featuring Bonifacio on the obverse, replacing Emilio Aguinaldo. The reverse features the Tayabak plant and the new BSP logo. The rest of the NGC coin series were presented on March 26, 2018.

The rest of the series was released March 2018 consisting of 1, 5 and 25-sentimo and 1, 5 and 10-piso. A 20-peso coin was added to the series on December 17, 2019, in order to replace the overused 20-piso banknote with a coin that could last 10–15 years longer in circulation.

==Formerly circulating coins==

=== Spanish administration ===

===The Philippines under U.S. Sovereignty===
===Commonwealth Issues===
In 1935, when the Commonwealth was established by the Congress of the United States, they issued a three-piece commemorative set (that sold very poorly) to commemorate the occasion. In 1937, the Commonwealth Arms were adapted to all circulating coinage. (Mint marks are &quot;M&quot; for Manila, &quot;D&quot; for Denver, &quot;S&quot; for San Francisco, and no mint mark for Philadelphia)

===Commonwealth Commemorative Issues===
===English series===

In 1958, a new, entirely base metal coinage was introduced, consisting of bronze 1 centavo, brass 5 centavos and nickel-brass 10, 25 and 50 centavos. This series was demonetized after August 31, 1979, except for the 10-centavo that was demonetized only after January 2, 1998.

===Pilipino series===

In 1967, the coinage was altered to reflect the use of Filipino names for the currency units. 1-piso coins were reintroduced in 1972. The series was demonetized after January 2, 1998.

===&quot;Ang Bagong Lipunan&quot; series===

In 1975, the &quot;Ang Bagong Lipunan&quot; (&quot;The New Society&quot;) series, was introduced with ₱5 coins included for this series. Cupro-nickel replaced nickel-brass that year. The series was demonetized after January 2, 1998.This series is special because it also includes special shaped coins, but only apply for the 1 and 5 sentimo coins.


===Flora and Fauna series===

The &quot;Flora and Fauna&quot; series was introduced in 1983 which included ₱2 coins. This series used the Optima typeface. The reduced-size 25-sentimo, 50-sentimo, ₱1 and ₱2 coins were distributed and ₱5 coins was reintroduced starting April 1, 1991. Production of 50-sentimo and ₱2 coins ceased in 1995. The main coins and the commemorative coins associated with the original 1983 larger ₱1 and ₱2 coins were demonetized on January 2, 1998 and May 1, 2020, respectively, making the series had a liability of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) for 37 years from September 30, 1983 to May 2020.

The &quot;Flora and Fauna&quot; series had an error for some coins, in 1983. The text for 10 centavos for scientific name of the Philippine goby was &quot;&quot;Pandaka pygmea&quot; instead of &quot;&quot;Pandaka pygmaea&quot; and the 50 centavo coin for the Philippine eagle was &quot;&quot;Pithecobhaga jefferyi&quot; instead of &quot;Pithecophaga jefferyi&quot;&quot;.

==Circulating coins==
===BSP Coin series===

In December 1995, a new set of coins and notes was issued which carried the new logo of the BSP: 5- and 1-piso and 25-, 10-, 5- and 1-sentimo, with the aim of carrying out the demonetization of all previous series on January 3, 1998. On July 10, 2001, BSP issued the 10-piso coin for general circulation to commemorate its 8th anniversary. It has the profiles of Andres Bonifacio and Apolinario Mabini in a con-joint or in tandem manner on the obverse side. The reverse side bears the seal of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas which is consistent with the common reverse design of the other six denominations. This has been an additional denomination to the current coin circulation and a replacement for the 10-piso NDS banknote. Like with its predecessor Flora and Fauna Series, it also used the Optima typeface.

The 1995, 1997 and 1998 5 peso coins had no mint marks, but coins issued from 1999 onward had mint marks. The 1995, 1997, and 1998 coins (with no mint mark) were minted by the Royal Canadian Mint. However, not all 1997 and 1998 coins were minted by the Royal Canadian Mint, quite a few were minted by the BSP (with mint mark).

===New Generation Currency Coin series===

On March 26, 2018, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas introduced the &quot;New Generation Currency Coin Series&quot; which was circulated through banks the next day. The new series features native Philippine flora. Sentimo denominated coins depict a stylized representation of the Philippine flag on the obverse. Peso denominated coins depict the portraits of renowned national heroes of the Philippines on the obverse. However, the 10-sentimo coin is not included in this series, because it was removed as a general circulation coin. This series uses the Twentieth Century and the Arial typeface (20 peso coin only).

In July 2019, the BSP announced plans to replace the ₱20 bill with a ₱20 coin by the 1st quarter of 2020.

In September 2019, Benjamin Diokno (the current BSP Governor) finally came up on having a solution for the ₱5 coin that is always confused with the current ₱1 coins, the new ₱5 coin that will be minted will have a nonagonal shape. Also, the ₱20 coin was finally designed in the same month and both coins were released on December 17, 2019.


===Current legal tender commemorative coins===

On December 9, 2011, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas issued a commemorative one-peso coin in celebration of the 150th Birth Anniversary of José Rizal. The coins are in the same dimensions as the circulating one peso coins with Rizal&#x27;s face from the front instead of in profile. The new coin also has the new logo of the central bank and is legal tender with the current series.

On December 18, 2013, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas issued a commemorative ten-peso coin in celebration of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Andres Bonifacio. The coins are in the same dimensions but the design changed. These also featured the new logo of the central bank and is also legal tender.

On December 22, 2014, the BSP issued three commemorative coins, a five-peso coin to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of the Leyte Gulf Landings, a five-peso coin honoring Overseas Filipinos with the theme &quot;Bagong Bayani&quot; and a ten-peso coin celebrating the 150th Anniversary of the birth of Apolinario Mabini.

On January 14, 2015, the BSP issued two limited edition commemorative coins for the papal visit of Pope Francis, a 50-peso coin made of nickel-brass steel and a 500-peso coin made of Nordic gold with gold plating. A special logo with the theme &quot;Mercy and Compassion&quot; was minted on the reverse side of both coins, following the Pope&#x27;s papal bull of indiction proclaimed later that year to mark the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy. The coins are minted under a licensing agreement with the Vatican. Both coins are legal tender. Production and issuance of two additional silver and gold coins in 1000-peso and 10,000-peso denominations were called off due to limitations in the procurement process.

On December 21, 2015, the BSP issued a commemorative 10-peso coin in honor of General Miguel Malvar, in time for the 150th year birth anniversary.

On January 27, 2017, the BSP issued a commemorative one-peso coin in honor of the Philippines&#x27; Chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

In August and November 2017, the BSP issued commemorative one-peso coins and 10-peso coin both honoring the 100th anniversary of the birth of educator and historian Horacio de la Costa and the 150th anniversary of the birth of three officers of the Philippine Revolutionary Army, Generals Artemio Ricarte, Isidoro Torres and Antonio Luna.

On March 11, 2022, the BSP issued a commemorative 125-peso coin to honor the 125th martyrdom anniversary of Dr. Jose Rizal.

<doc id="1231545" wikidata="Q2624036" url="?curid=1231545" title="Ignatius of Moscow">
<text>Ignatius (, ) (1540–1620) was a Russian Orthodox bishop of Greek descent who was the second Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia in 1605–1606, even though his status is now disputed and he is frequently omitted from the list of Patriarchs of Moscow by the Russian Orthodox Church.

Ignatius was reported to be of Cretan descent. He came to Russia in 1595 as a member of an ecclesiastic mission, sent by the Patriarch of Constantinople. He took part in the coronation of Boris Godunov. In the early 17th century, Ignatius was appointed Archbishop of Ryazan. After the death of Godunov, he expressed support to False Dmitriy I and, even before the pretender reached Moscow, was swearing in his supporters in Tula. On 30 June 1605, Ignatius was elected patriarch by the council of bishops to replace Patriarch Job, who was sent into exile for refusing to acknowledge the pretender&#x27;s rights for Russian throne. Ignatius performed the coronation of False Dmitriy I on 21 July 1605 and later also celebrated the coronation of his wife Marina Mnishek and their marriage. At that time, Ignatius was also an ardent opponent of the Unia.

After the assassination of False Dmitriy I, Ignatius was removed from his see and confined in the Chudov Monastery by the order of Tsar Vasili IV. In 1610, patriarch Ignatius supported False Dmitriy II. In April this year the patriarch Hermogen, consistently calling on the Russians to participate to arms and the expulsion of the Poles from the country was thrown into prison in the Chudov Monastery. His duties were taken over, this time without the confirmation of this fact by the council, by Ignatius. But the latter did not want to remain in the civil war-stricken Russia and December 27, 1611, made an attempt to escape from Moscow. In the vicinity of Smolensk, Ignatius was assaulted, robbed, and then stopped in the Polish camp outside the city. Polish King Sigismund III Vasa hoped that in the future will be able to renew war with Russia, and intended to use the former patriarch person Ignatius was taken to Vilnius and settled in the Holy Trinity Church of the Basilian Monastery. At that time he also converted from Russian Orthodoxy (&quot;the Disunia&quot;) to Byzantine Rite Catholicism (&quot;the Unia&quot;), thus entering into full communion with the Pope.

The date of the death of Ignatius traditionally were positioned around 1640, but in more recent studies mentioned much earlier years 1618 or 1619. The clergyman was buried in the church of the Holy Trinity in the Basilian monastery in Vilnius. His remains were probably removed from the tomb and exported out of the city by the Russian army after the capture of Vilnius in 1655.

Due to his active role in the installation of False Dmitriy I to the Moscow throne and later conversion to the Unia, Ignatius has suffered from damnatio memoriae in subsequent ages and often is not counted among the legitimate patriarchs by the Russian Orthodox Church. Even though his predecessor Patriarch Job was removed from his post by force, the legitimacy of Ignatius&#x27; election and his status as patriarch was not questioned by his contemporaries.

<text>China poblana (lit. &quot;Chinese woman from Puebla&quot;) is considered the traditional style of dress of women in Mexico, although in reality it only belonged to some urban zones in the middle and southeast of the country, before its disappearance in the second half of the 19th century. &quot;Poblanas&quot; are women of Puebla.

== Fashion design of the &quot;china dress&quot; ==


The fashion design of the &quot;china poblana dress&quot; is attributed to Catarina de San Juan, although it certainly incorporates elements from the diverse cultures that were mixed in New Spain during three centuries of Spanish rule.

According to descriptions written in the 19th century, the era in which the dress was very popular in various cities in the middle and southeast of Mexico, &quot;china&quot; outfit is made up of the following garments:

* A white blouse, with fringing and embroidery of silk and beads, in geometric and floral designs in bright colors. The blouse was sufficiently low-cut to allow part of the neck and the bosom to be seen, which scandalized to no end the &quot;proper&quot; women of nineteenth century Mexican society.
* A skirt called &quot;castor&quot; (or, &quot;beaver&quot;), named after the material it was made from. According to some historians, &quot;castor&quot; was used by well-heeled ladies of the household to make the underskirts of their indigenous maids. The &quot;castor&quot; skirt was decorated with sequins and &quot;camarones&quot; (literally, &quot;shrimp&quot;) that formed geometric and floral shapes. Folkloric dance groups have revived a version that has the coat of arms of Mexico embroidered with sequins, beads, and bugles (a type of bead).
* A white slip with &quot;enchilada stitching&quot;, that is to say with the lower hem criss-crossed with zig-zagged lacework. The slip of a &quot;china poblana&quot; would peek out under the &quot;castor&quot; skirt, and served to keep the form of a woman attired in the &quot;china&quot; dress from showing in silhouette.
* A &quot;loop&quot; that held up the &quot;castor&quot; and the slip to the waist of the woman who wore it. The loop may or may not have been adorned with embroidery, or woven in brocade-style.
* A shawl, sometimes made fine with silk, or in most cases with bobbles. The shawl is a very common garment in Mexico, even today. Women use it to cover themselves from the cold, but it was also used to carry babies or any other thing that was difficult to carry barehanded due to size and weight. The &quot;bobble shawl&quot;, which was most commonly used in &quot;china&quot; dresses, was woven with threads of blue and white color, and originated in the Otomí town of Santa María del Río (San Luis Potosí).
* In some instances, the &quot;china&quot; was accompanied with a scarf or kerchief of silk to hide any cleavage that might peek out of the blouse. Of these scarves, José María Rivera wrote that &quot;these regularly come home on Sunday only to return to the pawn shop on Monday or Tuesday&quot;.
* As footwear, 19th century author Manuel Payno pointed out that despite her financial lackings, a &quot;china&quot;-dress woman would use satin shoes embroidered with silk thread. This type of footwear appears in some nineteenth century Mexican texts as an indicator that the wearer was a &quot;merry woman&quot;. Furthermore, the &quot;china&quot; wearer completed the outfit with beads and jewels that adorned her ears, her cleavage, and her hands.

== Cultural representations of &quot;la china&quot; ==
Nineteenth-century descriptions of women wearing the &quot;china&quot; paint them as simultaneously attractive and too risque for the times. Men saw these women as beautiful for their brown complexion, their &quot;plump&quot; but not &quot;fat&quot; body and face, and, most significantly, their differences from women of higher social strata in their lack of artifices to enhance their beauty. Author José María Rivera notes that if a &quot;china&quot; woman would have seen a corset, she would have thought it a torture device such as used on Saint Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins; and that her face was not some sort of &quot;cake frosting&quot;, an allusion to the &quot;proper&quot; women whose faces would have to be washed to see if the colors run:

In that sense, the wardrobe of the &quot;china&quot; woman was considered too provocative. Contemporary Mexican journalists and foreigners who knew these women in the first half of the nineteenth century call attention to the way in which the fashion of peasant women showed off their feminine forms, or were an appropriate feature of all the graces that were attributed to these women. A verbal portrait was made of them as excellent dancers of jarabe music popular in that era—like &quot;El Atole&quot;, &quot;El Agualulco&quot;, &quot;El Palomo&quot; and others that form part of the folkloric jarabes of the twentieth century—also as models of cleanliness and order; of fidelity to &quot;their man&quot; although also seen as very liberal sexually.

== Origins ==

=== Origin of the fashion design of &quot;la china&quot; ===
As mentioned in the introduction of this article, the Pueblan origin of the &quot;china poblana&quot; outfit has been put in doubt on occasion. The correlation between the &quot;china&quot;—as a popular figure—and the outfit worn by the historic China Poblana—the alluded-to Catarina de San Juan—is a product of the evolution of Mexican culture during the first decades of the 20th century. In fact, &quot;las chinas&quot; became a well defined meme in the 19th century, a little more than a century after the death of Catarina de San Juan. Writer Gauvin Alexander Bailey points out:

<text>Cardistry is the performance art of card flourishing. Unlike card magic, cardistry is meant to be visually impressive and appear very hard to execute.

The term &quot;cardistry&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;card&quot; and &quot;artistry.&quot; People who engage in cardistry are colloquially known as cardists.

Cardistry involves the use of hands to create cuts, displays, fans, patterns, and sequences through the use of playing cards. Various arm-spreads, cuts, shuffles, and springs can be used. The intent is to create a captivating motion and beautiful display. The effects are limited only by the types of cards used, the imagination, and the degree of manual dexterity of the performer. The presentation is typically neither “illusionary” nor purportedly “magic”; rather, it is more like juggling, mime, or similar entertaining activities.

==History==
Conjuring tricks with playing cards became popular around the 19th century. At that time, simple card flourishes—such as the Charlier cut, riffle shuffle, and thumb fan—were often performed by magicians as a way of demonstrating sleight of hand.
American magician Chris Kenner published &quot;Totally Out of Control&quot; in 1992, an instructional book concerning magic tricks with household objects. On page 125 was a two-handed flourish he called &quot;The Five Faces of Sybil&quot;. Making use of all fingers, Sybil ends with a display of the deck in five distinct packets. Kenner referred to Sybil in his book as &quot;a quick cut flourish to demonstrate skill and dexterity&quot;. The cut became the most notable creation from &quot;Totally Out of Control&quot; and would eventually form the nucleus of what is now known as cardistry. Kevin Pang of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine remarked that &quot;every cardist can deftly perform Sybil the way guitarists can run through a blues progression&quot;.

Los Angeles-based magician Brian Tudor released an instructional VHS tape in 1997 dubbed &quot;Show Off&quot; which featured only flourishes, including numerous variations of Sybil. The tape was well received by critics and resulted in growing attention to card flourishing as a performance art.

In 2001 Sybil enthusiasts and twin brothers Dan and Dave Buck released &quot;Pasteboard Animations&quot;, another VHS tape explaining advanced cuts and flourishes. It sold hundreds of copies and was critically praised in a &quot;Genii&quot; magazine review that same year. In 2004, the twins released the instructional DVD &quot;The Dan and Dave System,&quot; which officially separated advanced card flourishing from magic. In 2007, Dan and Dave released &quot;The Trilogy&quot;, a three-disc DVD set. Retailing at $85 per unit, &quot;The Trilogy&quot; is the best-selling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 copies. Virtually every cardist mentions either the &quot;System&quot; or &quot;The Trilogy&quot; as the source of their inspiration.

The term &quot;cardistry&quot; was first presented and popularized for this art form by &quot;Richard Z.&quot; on the decknique.net forums in March 2006.&quot;&quot; Until then, these tricks were known by other names such as card flourishes, card manipuation, card stunts, and xtreme card manipulation.

==Types of cardistry moves==

=== Grips ===
Styles of grips include:
*Biddle grip: Biddle grip is when a deck is stationary on a table and is lifted by taking the thumb and middle and pointer fingers to apply pressure to either side of the deck, and lifting the deck into air.
*Mechanic&#x27;s grip (dealer&#x27;s grip): Mechanic&#x27;s grip is a grip where the deck of cards is placed in the center of the palm of the individual&#x27;s chosen hand. This grip is also commonly known as dealer&#x27;s grip.
*Straddle grip: The straddle grip is a variation of the Mechanic&#x27;s grip with a couple of key differences. In the straddle grip the pinkie finger moves from the right edge to the bottom of the deck, and the thumb points upwards (instead of resting flat as in the mechanic&#x27;s grip). The deck rests on the distal or intermediate phalanges, creating more space between the deck and the palm, thus the deck is lifted slightly.

=== One-handed cuts ===
These moves require only one hand to perform. The Charlier cut is the most familiar one-handed cut; other famous one-handed cuts include Jerry Cestkowski&#x27;s L-cuts, the revolution cut, and Nikolaj Pedersen&#x27;s trigger and its variations.

Charlier cut: This is the classic one-handed cut, where the individual must hold their deck in straddle grip, then release pressure on their thumb to drop half a packet of cards, and follow up by using the ring finger to push the bottom packet through and complete the cut.

Revolution cut: This cut builds on top of the Charlier cut, with a small variation added to it. After the individual uses their ring finger to push the packet of cards to clear the top half of the deck, instead of dropping the packet, the ring, middle and pointer fingers are used to rotate the top packet 180 degrees and then finish the cut.

Scissor cut: This is a cut that begins with the deck in straddle grip, with the thumb peeling off a packet of cards by lifting the thumb on the bottom edge of the deck. After this step, the thumb rotates the cards off the pointer finger until the top packet of cards clears the bottom packet. At this point the thumb brings back the (now) bottom packet back in to complete the cut.

=== Two-handed cuts ===
These moves are performed using both hands to grip/hold packets of cards; they often utilize one-handed cuts as a part of the move. These represent the bulk of all cardistry moves, ranging from beginner moves like the &quot;Five Faces of Sybil&quot;, to highly complex and difficult cuts that require months to master. Dan and Dave greatly popularized this category with cuts like &#x27;Pandora&#x27;. Other cardists like Daren Yeow, Oliver Sogard, Nikolaj Pedersen, Tobias Levin, Patrick Varnavas, Brian Tudor, and Noel Heath have greatly influenced and reformed two-handed cuts.

Swing cut: This is a flourish where the deck should be held in biddle grip in the dominant hand to start, followed by using the pointer finger to lift a small packet of cards. The pointer finger is then extended outwards, the card packet pivoted on the thumb, and the packet dropped onto the other hand. This process should be repeated until the deck is transferred from the dominant hand to the non-dominant hand.

Swivel cut: This is a cut that starts out in biddle grip, where the individual&#x27;s second hand comes in from behind. and with the thumb finger, a small packet of cards is lifted from the thumb sided edge of the deck, pivoted around the pointer finger and dropped in the center palm of the second hand.
Sybil cut: This is a flourish which raises the stakes and requires an immense amount of practice. The cut begins with the deck in Z grip, after which the top packet of the Z grip is split into two packets, after which the bottom packet of Z grip is dropped onto the palm of the hand, while the second hand moves forward in a downward direction (making the side of the card packets parallel with the ground), then the top packets are rotated towards the bottom packet. The open second hand grabs the packet of cards for a moment before the first hand grabs a small packet of cards from the cleared packet and displays the packets. 

=== Displays ===
These moves are either done in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional manner. Types of displays may include 3-D structures; ex: a card house, or a 3-D aspect; ex: Zach Mueller&#x27;s &quot;bloom,&quot; or 2-D displays that showcase repeating motifs or a symmetrical shape; ex: Dave Buck&#x27;s &quot;The Werm.&quot;

Ribbon spread (with turnover): This begins with the deck having a bevel towards the individual and held in biddle grip. The pointer finger is then taken to spread the deck onto a high friction (card mat) flat surface. With the cards spread out in front, the individual grabs one end of the deck, lifts it and places their pointer finger on top and trace across the whole deck to see each individual card turnover.

Five faces of Sybil: This is a flourish that is more advanced and will take rigorous practice to get right. The deck is held in Z grip on the left hand to start, with the top packet of the Z grip being split into two with the pointer finger, followed by the right wrist rotating downwards with the top two packet of cards while holding the third packet between the thumb and pointer finger. After rotating downward enough, the middle packet of Z grip is taken by the left hand with the thumb and middle finger. And lastly the right hand thumb and middle finger break off a small part of the middle packet, to display the five faces of sybil.

The Werm: This cardistry move begins by holding the deck in Z grip, and pivoting the three packets of cards on the pointer and thumb finger to face the ground, with the cards making a reverse U shape, then using the pointer and middle finger rotate a card from the top packet to touch the packet in front, forming a square shape. Lastly, take the thumb to pull a card from the top packet and let the friction between the pinky finger and the second thumb hold the card in place - and ending with the reveal of 5 packets of cards in a lengthwise display.

=== Fans and spreads ===
These moves involve spreading a deck of cards in various ways, typically in a circle. The &#x27;index/thumb fan&#x27; is the most fundamental move in this category; other common moves in this category include the &#x27;riffle fan&#x27; by Dimitri Arleri, the &#x27;LePaul spread&#x27;, and the &#x27;pressure fan&#x27;.

=== Aerials ===
These moves involve cards (or packets of cards) continuously moving in a same direction, typically being caught by the other hand. Some of the most famous moves in this category include the &#x27;Spring&#x27; and the &#x27;Anaconda Dribble&#x27;. Aerials are moves that are completely independent and cannot be blended with other flourishes.

=== Isolations and twirls ===
These moves are mostly done with only a small number of cards. The performer usually fixes the card&#x27;s center and rotates the card without changing its position. Belonging in this category are &#x27;palm shift isolations&#x27;, which were showcased by Jaspas Deck in his 2010 video &quot;Starry Eyed&quot;. Duy and Zach invented many unusual ways to do isolation.

==Cardistry-Con==

Cardistry-Con is an interactive conference centered around the art of cardistry, where cardists from all over the world can gather and explore the potential of an ordinary deck of playing cards. The event aims to promote cardistry, including interviews, panel discussions, live performances, exclusive video screenings, workshops, contests and giveaways.

One of the highlights of the annual event is the Cardistry-Con Awards, which includes categories for deck design as well as technical achievement.

The &quot;beta&quot; Cardistry-Con occurred in 2014 as a subsection of Dan &amp; Dave&#x27;s Magic Con. In 2015, Magic Con was discontinued and an official Cardistry Con took its place. Since then, Cardistry-Con has been held in Brooklyn (2015), Berlin (2016), Los Angeles (2017), Hong Kong (2018), and Portland (2019). The next Cardistry-Con was originally scheduled for mid-2020 in Brussels, Belgium, but was postponed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

<text>A bowl is a typically round dish or container generally used for preparing, serving, storing, or consuming food. The interior of a bowl is characteristically shaped like a spherical cap, with the edges and the bottom forming a seamless curve. This makes bowls especially suited for holding liquids and loose food, as the contents of the bowl are naturally concentrated in its center by the force of gravity. The exterior of a bowl is most often round, but can be of any shape, including rectangular.

The size of bowls varies from small bowls used to hold a single serving of food to large bowls, such as punch bowls or salad bowls, that are often used to hold or store more than one portion of food. There is some overlap between bowls, cups, and plates. Very small bowls, such as the tea bowl, are often called cups, while plates with especially deep wells are often called bowls.

In many cultures, bowls are the most common kind of vessel used for serving and eating food. Historically, small bowls were also used for serving both tea and alcoholic drinks. In Western culture plates and cups are more commonly used.

==Background==

Modern bowls can be made of ceramic, metal, wood, plastic, and other materials. Bowls have been made for thousands of years. Very early bowls have been found in China, Ancient Greece, Crete and in certain Native American cultures.

In Ancient Greek pottery, small bowls, including phiales and pateras, and bowl-shaped cups called kylices were used. Phiales were used for libations and included a small dent in the center for the bowl to be held with a finger, although one source indicates that these were used to hold perfume rather than wine. Some Mediterranean examples from the Bronze Age manifest elaborate decoration and sophistication of design. For example, the bridge spouted vessel design appeared at the Minoan site of Phaistos. In the 4th millennium BC, evidence exists that the Uruk culture of ancient Mesopotamia mass-produced beveled rim bowls of standardized sizes. Moreover, in Chinese pottery, there are many elaborately painted bowls and other vessels dating to the Neolithic period. , the oldest bowl found is 18,000 years old.

In examining bowls found during an archaeological dig in North America, the anthropologist Vincas Steponaitis defines a bowl by its dimensions, writing that a bowl&#x27;s diameter rarely falls under half its height and that historic bowls can be classified by their edge, or lip, and shape.

In many cultures, food and drink are shared in a communal bowl or cup. In Mali, the name of the town of Bandiagara () refers to the communal bowl meals are served in. The name translates roughly to &quot;large eating bowl.&quot; In Zimbabwe, sadza is traditionally eaten from a communal bowl, a tradition that is still maintained by some families, mainly in rural areas. Lakh is a popular boiled porridge made with rolled millet flour pellets (araw/arraw) typically topped at serving with sweetened fermented milk. It is usually served in a communal bowl or platter in Senegal.

In China, it is considered rude and unhygienic for a diner to use his or her own chopsticks to pick up food from communal bowls and plates when such utensils are present.

In some cultures, the communal bowl has a set of social strictures, as evidenced by the Spanish idiom, &quot;¿Cuándo hemos comido en el mismo plato?&quot; (English: When have we eaten from the same dish?).

<text>Blowback is the unintended consequences and unwanted side-effects of a covert operation. 
To the civilians suffering the blowback of covert operations, the effect typically manifests itself as &quot;random&quot; acts of political violence without a discernible, direct cause; because the public—in whose name the intelligence agency acted—are unaware of the effected secret attacks that &quot;provoked revenge&quot; (counter-attack) against them.

==Etymology==
Originally, &quot;blowback&quot; was CIA internal coinage denoting the unintended, harmful consequences—to friendly populations and military forces—when a given weapon is used beyond its purpose as intended by the party supplying it. Examples include anti-Western religious figures (e.g. Osama bin Laden) who, in due course, attack foe and sponsor; right-wing counter-revolutionaries who sell drugs to their sponsor&#x27;s civil populace (see CIA and Contras cocaine trafficking in the US); and banana republic s (see Salvadoran Civil War) who kill American reporters or nuns (e.g. Dorothy Kazel).

In formal print usage, the term &quot;blowback&quot; first appeared in the &quot;Clandestine Service History—Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran—November 1952–August 1953&quot;, the CIA&#x27;s internal history of the 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état, sponsored by the American and British governments, which was published in March 1954. Blowback from this operation would indeed occur with the Iranian Revolution and the Iran hostage crisis. Recent accounts of how blowback functioned in the War on Terror relation to US and UK intelligence and defense propaganda and became an important issue in a 21st Century media environment are discussed by Emma Briant in her book &quot;Propaganda and Counter-terrorism&quot; which presents first-hand accounts and discussions of deliberate and unintended consequences of blowback, oversight, and impacts for the public.

==Examples==

===Nicaragua and Iran-Contra===
In the 1980s, the blowback was a central theme in the legal and political debates about the efficacy of the Reagan Doctrine, which advocated public &quot;and&quot; secret support of anti-Communist counter-revolutionaries. For example, by secretly funding the secret war of the militarily-defeated, right-wing Contras against the left-wing Sandinista government of Nicaragua, which led to the Iran–Contra Affair, wherein the Reagan Administration sold American weapons to Iran (a state unfriendly to the US) to arm the Contras with Warsaw Pact weapons, and their consequent drug-dealing in American cities. Moreover, in the case of Nicaragua v. United States, the International Court of Justice ruled against the United States secret military attacks against Sandinista Nicaragua, because the countries were not formally at war.

Reagan Doctrine advocates, including The Heritage Foundation, argued that support for anti-Communists would topple Communist régimes without retaliatory consequences to the United States and help win the global Cold War.

===Afghanistan and Al Qaeda===
Examples of blowback include the CIA&#x27;s financing and support for Afghan insurgents to fight an anti-Communist proxy guerilla war against the USSR in Afghanistan; some of the beneficiaries of this CIA support may have joined al-Qaeda&#x27;s terrorist campaign against the United States.

===Syria and ISIS===
During the Syrian Civil War, the United States and Saudi Arabia supported and aided anti-Assad armed groups. Some of those groups later shifted loyalty to ISIS.

===Yevno Azef and Russian Imperial secret police===

Russian socialist revolutionary Yevno Azef, as a paid police informant, provided the Russian secret-police Okhrana with information to allow them to arrest an influential member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. After the arrest, Azef assumed the vacant position and organized assassinations, including those of the director of Imperial Russia&#x27;s police and later Minister of the Interior Vyacheslav Plehve (1904) and Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, the Tsar&#x27;s uncle (1905). By 1908, Azef was playing the double role of a revolutionary assassin and police spy who received 1000 rubles a month from the authorities.

=== Soviet disinformation blowback ===
Soviet intelligence, as part of active measures, frequently spread disinformation to distort their adversaries&#x27; decision-making. However, sometimes this information filtered back through the KGB&#x27;s own contacts, leading to distorted reports. Lawrence Bittman also addressed Soviet intelligence blowback in &quot;The KGB and Soviet Disinformation&quot;, stating that &quot;There are, of course, instances in which the operator is partially or completely exposed and subjected to countermeasures taken by the government of the target country.&quot;

<text>Victor Herbert Crowe (31 January 1932 – 21 January 2009) was a Welsh international football player and later football manager.

==Career==
Crowe was born in Abercynon, South Wales but moved to Handsworth, Birmingham with his family when he was two years old. On leaving school, he played for Erdington Albion, the West Bromwich Albion nursery team, but signed for Aston Villa in 1951 and would spend most of his career with the Birmingham club. He established himself in the Villa team when Danny Blanchflower vacated the right-half berth in 1954. He missed the 1957 FA Cup Final due to injury but captained the side to the Second Division title in 1960 and League Cup Final success in 1961. He was capped 16 times by Wales.

As manager, Crowe was unable to prevent Villa being relegated when he took charge towards the end of the 1969–70 season. The following season he led his Third Division team to the League Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur, which Villa lost. He saw his side finish top of Division Three in 1972, however, breaking many records along the way. He was sacked in 1974 after his side finished 14th in Division Two.

In 1975, Crowe went to the United States to take part in the North American Soccer League, taking the manager&#x27;s position with Portland Timbers. He brought a cast of English players with him, many of them young players from the Midlands area, and they proceeded to win the Western Division championship and advanced all the way to the NASL final, losing 2–0 to Tampa Bay Rowdies. In their two home playoff games, &quot;The Lads&quot; success forced the club to add temporary seating to accommodate their fans, and the team played before two crowds in excess of 30,000, totals unheard of in American soccer at the time.

Crowe stayed in Portland through the 1976 season before returning to England. The Timbers beckoned again in 1980, however, and he returned for three more seasons in America before the Timbers club folded after the 1982 season. Although his later teams never captured the success of that first year, he left an indelible mark on soccer in the Pacific Northwest by introducing thousands of Portland area residents to the joys of the game. Today, Portland is a soccer hotbed. In 2001 the Timbers re-emerged as a member of the professional USL First Division, and in 2011 Portland moved into the highest tier of American soccer by joining Major League Soccer. The modern edition of the Timbers play in the same stadium where Crowe and his lads excelled that first year in 1975.

Crowe died on 21 January 2009, at the age of 76, after a long illness.

<text>Blowback is a system of operation for self-loading firearms that obtains energy from the motion of the cartridge case as it is pushed to the rear by expanding gas created by the ignition of the propellant charge.

Several blowback systems exist within this broad principle of operation, each distinguished by the methods used to control bolt movement. In most actions that use blowback operation, the breech is not locked mechanically at the time of firing: the inertia of the bolt and recoil , relative to the weight of the bullet, delay opening of the breech until the bullet has left the barrel. A few locked breech designs use a form of blowback (example: primer actuation) to perform the unlocking function.

The blowback principle may be considered a simplified form of gas operation, since the cartridge case behaves like a piston driven by the powder gases. Other operating principles for self-loading firearms include delayed blowback, blow forward, gas operation, and recoil operation.

==Principle of operation==
In firearms, a blowback system is generally defined as an operating system in which energy to operate the firearm&#x27;s various mechanisms, and automate the loading of another cartridge, is derived from the inertia of the spent cartridge case being pushed out the rear of the chamber by rapidly expanding gases produced by a burning propellant, typically gunpowder. When a projectile (e.g. bullet) is still within the gun barrel, the high-pressure propellant gas behind it is contained within what could be seen as a closed system; but at the moment it exits the muzzle, this functional seal is broken, allowing the propellant gas to be suddenly released in an explosive muzzle blast. The expanding gas also creates a jet propulsion effect rearward in the barrel against the spent cartridge case. This &quot;blowback&quot; is the predominant component of the recoil. Some guns use energy from blowback to perform the automatic bolt cycling /reloading process, while others will use a portion of the blowback to operate only certain parts of the cycle or simply use the blowback energy to enhance the operational energy from another system of automatic operation.

What is common to all blowback systems is that the cartridge case must move under the direct action of the powder pressure, therefore any gun in which the bolt is not rigidly locked, and permitted to move while there remains gas pressure in the chamber, will undergo a degree of blowback action. The energy from the expansion of gases upon firing appears in the form of kinetic energy transmitted to the bolt mechanism, which is controlled and used to operate the firearm&#x27;s operation cycle. The extent to which blowback is employed largely depends on the manner used to control the movement of the bolt and the proportion of energy drawn from other systems of operation. How the movement of the bolt is controlled is where blowback systems differ. Blowback operation is most often divided into three categories, all using residual pressure to complete the cycle of operation: &quot;simple blowback&quot; (often just &quot;blowback&quot;), &quot;delayed/retarded blowback&quot;, and &quot;advanced primer ignition&quot;.

Relating blowback to other types of automatic firearm operation, George M. Chinn wrote that: &quot;In the larger sense, blowback might well be considered a special form of gas operation. This is reasonable because the cartridge case may be conceived of as a sort of piston driven by the powder gases. Actually, blowback involves so many special problems that it is best considered to be in a class by itself. The question whether or not it should be included within the more general class of gas operation or recoil operation is purely academic. The important point is that it partakes some of the properties of both classes and, depending on the particular problem at hand, may be considered to be either one.&quot;

==History==
In 1663 a mention is made in the journal of the Royal Society for that year of an engineer who came to Prince Rupert with an automatic weapon, though how it worked is unknown. In 1854 a hydropneumatically delayed-blowback cannon was patented by Henry Bessemer. In 1856 a crank-operated cannon with a blowback-operated cocking mechanism was patented in the US by Charles E. Barnes. In 1876 a single-shot breech-loading rifle with an automatic breech-opening and cocking mechanism using a form of blowback was patented in Britain and America by the American Bernard Fasoldt. In 1883 Hiram Maxim patented a blowback-operated rifle. In 1884 he would also patent a toggle-lock delayed-blowback-operated rifle. Also in 1884, a few months after Maxim, a British patent for blowback-operated pistols and rifles was filed by Richard Paulson. In 1887 a patent was filed by an American inventor called Carl J. Bjerkness for a blowback-operated rifle. In 1888 a delayed-blowback machine gun known as the Skoda was invented by Grand Duke Karl Salvator and Colonel von Dormus of Austria.

==Simple blowback==

The blowback (sometimes referred to as &quot;simple&quot;, &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; blowback) system represents the most basic auto loading operation type. In a blowback mechanism, the bolt rests against the rear of the barrel, but is not locked in place. At the point of ignition, expanding gases push the bullet forward through the barrel while at the same time pushing the case rearward against the bolt. The expanding gases push the bolt assembly to the rear, but the motion is slowed by the mass of the bolt, internal friction, and the force required to compress the action spring. The design must ensure that the delay is long enough that the bullet exits the barrel before the cartridge case clears the chamber. The empty case is ejected as the bolt travels to the rear. The stored energy of the compressed action spring then drives the bolt forward (although not until the trigger is pulled if the weapon fires from an open bolt). A new cartridge is stripped from the magazine and chambered as the bolt returns to its in-battery position.

The blowback system is practical for firearms using relatively low-power cartridges with lighter weight bullets. Higher power cartridges require heavier bolts to keep the breech from opening prematurely; at some point, the bolt becomes too heavy to be practical. For an extreme example, a 20 mm cannon using simple blowback and lubricated cartridges would need a bolt to keep the cartridge safely in the barrel during the first few milliseconds. Yet the bolt must cycle far enough back to eject the spent casing and load a new round, which would limit the return spring to an average force of . The resulting system, if it could be built, would not have enough energy to cycle reliably or even keep the bolt closed when the gun is tilted up.

Due to the required bolt weight, blowback designs in pistols are generally limited to calibers smaller than 9×19mm Parabellum (e.g., .25 ACP, .32 ACP, .380 ACP, 9×18mm Makarov, etc.) There are exceptions such as the simple blowback pistols from Hi-Point Firearms which include models chambered in .40 S&amp;W and .45 ACP. Simple blowback operation can also be found in small-bore (such as .22LR) semi-automatic rifles, carbines and submachine guns. Most simple blowback rifles are chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. Popular examples include the Marlin Model 60 and the Ruger 10/22. Most blowback carbines and submachine guns are chambered for pistol cartridges such as the 9×19mm Parabellum, .40 S&amp;W and .45 ACP. Examples include the MP 40, Sten and UZI. The bolt can be made bigger and more massive in these weapons than in handguns, as they are intrinsically heavier and designed, ideally at least, to be fired with both hands, often with the aid of a shoulder stock; and these factors help to ameliorate the disruption to the shooter&#x27;s aim caused by the heavy bolt&#x27;s movement. Consequently, simple blowback is adequate for somewhat more powerful rounds in submachine guns than in standard pistols. One of the very few known simple blowback firearms capable of firing fully powered rifle cartridges was the Brixia 930 light machine gun, that required a large bolt to handle the pressure of the round as well as a spring buffer shock absorbing butt plate on the stock to handle recoil. There were also a few rifles that chambered cartridges specifically designed for blowback operation. Examples include the Winchester Model 1905, 1907 and 1910. The only known assault rifle to use simple blowback was the Burton Model 1917. 

Although simple blowback is limited to guns using low-power rounds, it is so efficient that in small-calibre semi-automatic pistols it has become almost ubiquitous. Heavier calibre semiautomatic handguns typically employ a short recoil system, of which by far the most common type are Browning-derived designs which rely on a locking barrel and slide assembly instead of blowback. But blowback guns can be used to fire powerful cartridges if they are of the other two types: API or delayed blowback.
==Advanced primer ignition (API) blowback==

In the API blowback design, the primer is ignited when the bolt is still moving forward and before the cartridge is fully chambered (akin to the fire-out-of-battery principle used in some mountain guns like Canon de 65 M (montagne) modele 1906, although there the bolt is locked and whole ordnance is moving at fire). This requires a very careful design to ensure the proper balance and equalization of forces between the projectile weight, propellant charge, barrel length, bolt weight, and return spring strength. In a simple blowback design, the propellant gases have to overcome static inertia to accelerate the bolt rearwards to open the breech. In an API blowback, they first have to do the work of overcoming forward momentum to arrest the forward motion of the bolt. Because the forward and rearward speeds of the bolt tend to be approximately the same, the API blowback allows the weight of the bolt to be halved. Because the momentum of the two opposed bolt motions cancels out over time, the API blowback design results in reduced recoil.

Advanced primer ignition (API) was originally developed by Reinhold Becker for use on the Becker Type M2 20 mm cannon. It became a feature of a wide range of designs that can be traced back to Becker&#x27;s, including the Oerlikon cannon widely used as anti-aircraft weapons during World War II.

To increase performance of API blowback firearms, larger calibre APIB guns such as the Becker and Oerlikon use extended chambers, longer than is necessary to contain the round, and ammunition for APIB firearms come with straight-sided cartridges with rebated rims (rims that are smaller in diameter than the cartridge itself). The last part of forward motion and the first part of the rearward motion of the case and bolt happen within the confines of this extended chamber. As long as the gas pressure in the barrel is high, the walls of the case remain supported and the breach sealed, although the case is sliding rearwards. This sliding motion of the case, while it is expanded by a high internal gas pressure, risks tearing it apart, and a common solution is to grease the ammunition to reduce the friction. The case needs to have a rebated rim because the front end of the bolt will enter the chamber, and the extractor claw hooked over the rim therefore has to fit also within the diameter of the chamber. The case generally has very little neck, because this remains unsupported during the firing cycle and is generally deformed; a strongly necked case would be likely to split.

The API blowback design permits the use of more powerful ammunition in a lighter gun than would be achieved by using simple blowback, and the reduction of felt recoil results in further weight savings. The original Becker cannon, firing 20×70mmRB ammunition, was developed to be carried by World War I aircraft, and weighed only 30 kg. Oerlikon even produced an anti-tank rifle firing 20×110mmRB ammunition using the API blowback operation, the SSG36. On the other hand, because the design imposes a very close relationship between bolt mass, chamber length, spring strength, ammunition power and rate of fire, in APIB guns high rate of fire and high muzzle velocity tend to be mutually exclusive. API blowback guns also have to fire from an open bolt, which is not conducive to accuracy and also prevents synchronized fire through an aircraft propeller arc.

According to a United States Army Materiel Command engineering course from 1970, &quot;The advanced primer ignition gun is superior to the simple blowback because of its higher firing rate and lower recoil momentum. However, favorable performance depends on timing that must be precise. A slight delay in primer function, and the gun reverts to a simple blowback without the benefit of a massive bolt and stiffer driving spring to soften the recoil impact. [...] The exacting requirements in design and construction of gun and ammunition reduce this type almost to the point of academic interest only.&quot;

API mechanisms are very sensitive to the ammunition used. For example, when the Germans switched their MG FF (an Oerlikon FFF derivative) to their new, lighter mine shell, they had to rebalance the spring strength and bolt weight of the gun, resulting in a new MG FF/M model with ammunition not being interchangeable between the two models. The 30 mm MK 108 cannon was perhaps the apogee of API blowback technology during World War II.

The principle is also used in some automatic grenade launchers, for example in the US Mk 19 grenade launcher or Russian AGS-30.

===Extended chamber blowback===
A closed bolt firing equivalent of Advanced Primer Ignition that uses straight-sided rebated rim cartridges in an extended deeper chambering to contain the gas pressure slightly longer until it reaches a safe level to extract. This operation is almost similar to a simple blowback operation, API blowback firearms that have fired the round at the point where the cartridge is fully chambered operate in a similar way.

==Delayed blowback==

For more powerful rounds that cannot be safely used in simple blowback, or in order to obtain a lighter mechanism than the simple format can provide, the alternative to API is some system of &quot;delayed&quot; or &quot;retarded&quot; blowback, in which the bolt is never fully locked, but is initially held in place, sealing the cartridge in the chamber by the mechanical resistance of one of various designs of delaying mechanism. As with the resistance provided by momentum in API, it takes a fraction of a second for the propellant gases to overcome this and start moving cartridge and bolt backwards; this very brief delay is sufficient for the bullet to leave the muzzle and for the internal pressure in the barrel to decrease to a safe level. The bolt and cartridge are then pushed to the rear by the residual gas pressure.

Because of high pressures, rifle-caliber delayed blowback firearms, such as the FAMAS, AA-52 and G3, typically have fluted chambers to ease extraction. Below are various forms of delayed-blowback actions:

===Roller-delayed===

Roller-delayed blowback was first used in Mauser&#x27;s &quot;Gerät 06H&quot; prototype. Roller-delayed blowback operation differs from roller-locked recoil operation as seen in the MG 42 and gas operated roller locked, as seen in the &quot;Gerät 03&quot; and &quot;Gerät 06&quot;. Unlike the MG 42, in roller-delayed blowback the barrel is fixed and does not recoil, and unlike the &quot;Gerät 03&quot; and &quot;Gerät 06&quot; and StG 44, roller-delayed blowback systems lack a gas piston. These omissions are conducive to relatively light construction by significantly reducing the number of parts required and the amount of machining required to produce a rifle. As the bolt head is driven rearward, rollers on the sides of the bolt are driven inward against a tapered bolt carrier extension. This forces the bolt carrier rearward at a much greater velocity and delays movement of the bolt head. The primary advantage of roller-delayed blowback is the simplicity of the design compared to gas or recoil operation.

The roller-delayed blowback firearm action was patented by Mauser&#x27;s Wilhelm Stähle and Ludwig Vorgrimler. Though appearing simple, its development during World War II was a hard technical and personal effort, as German engineering, mathematical and other scientists had to work together on a like-it-or-not basis led by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer, the director of Mauser Werke&#x27;s Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group. Experiments showed roller-delayed blowback firearms exhibited bolt-bounce as the bolt opened at an extreme velocity of approximately during automatic fire. To counter bolt-bounce the perfect angle choice on the nose of the bolt head had to be found to significantly reduce the opening velocity of the bolt. The extremely high bolt carrier velocities problem was not solved by trial and error. Mathematician Karl Maier provided analysis of the components and assemblies in the development project. In December 1943 Maier came up with an equation that engineers used to change the angles in the receiver to 45° and 27° on the locking piece relative to the longitudinal axis reducing the bolt-bounce problem. With these angles the geometrical transmission ratio of the bolt carrier to the bolthead became 3:1, so the rear bolt carrier was forced to move 3 times faster than the bolthead. The rearward forces on the bolt carrier and receiver were 2:1. The force and impulse transmitted to the receiver increases with the force and impulse transmitted to the bolt carrier. Making the bolt carrier heavier lessens the recoil velocity. For Mausers StG 45(M) project Maier assumed a bolt head and bolt carrier (1 to 3 ratio). The prototype StG 45 (M) assault rifle had 18 longitudinal gas relief flutes cut in the chamber wall to assist the bloated cartridge casing from the chamber walls during extraction. Fluting the end of the chamber provides pressure equalization between the front outer surface of the cartridge case and its interior and thus ensures extraction without tearing the case making extraction easier and more reliable. In 1944 other German companies like Großfuß (de), Rheinmetall and C.G. Haenel showed interest in developing roller-delayed blowback small arms. Großfuß worked on a roller-delayed blowback MG 45 general-purpose machine gun that, like the StG 45 (M), had not progressed beyond the prototype stage by the end of World War II.

After World War II, former Mauser engineers Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor Löffler perfected the mechanism between 1946 and 1950 while working for the French small arms manufacturer Centre d&#x27;Etudes et d&#x27;Armament de Mulhouse (CEAM). In 1950 Ludwig Vorgrimler was recruited to work for CETME in Spain. The first full-scale production rifle to utilize roller-delay was the Spanish CETME battle rifle, which was closely followed by the Swiss SIG SG 510 and the CETME Model B-based Heckler &amp; Koch G3. The G3 bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel&#x27;s breech surface. The G3&#x27;s &quot;bolt head locking lever&quot; is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. Due to the relative low bolt thrust exhibited by pistol cartridges the anti-bounce mechanism is omitted by Heckler &amp; Koch on their roller-delayed blowback firearms chambered for pistols cartridges. Heckler &amp; Koch&#x27;s MP5 submachine gun is the most common weapon still in service worldwide using this system. The Heckler &amp; Koch P9 semi-automatic pistol, CETME Ameli light machine gun, SIG MG 710-3, Heckler &amp; Koch HK21 and Ohio Ordnance REAPR general-purpose machine guns also use it.

Roller-delayed blowback arms are ammunition specific, since they lack an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the arm to various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior. Their reliable functioning is limited by specific ammunition and arm parameters like bullet weight, propellant charge, barrel length and amount of wear. At the moment of cartridge ignition the chamber has to be and remain sealed, until the bullet has exited the barrel and the gas pressure within the bore has dropped to a safe level before the seal is broken and chamber starts to open. For obtaining a proper and safe functioning parameters bandwidth arms manufactures offer a variety of locking pieces with different mass and shoulder angles and cylindrical rollers with different diameters. The angles are critical and determine the unlock timing and gas pressure drop management as the locking piece acts in unison with the bolt head carrier. The bolt gap width determines the headspace and hence the correct positioning of the cartridges in the (closed) chamber. Due to usage wear the bolt gap between the locking piece and bolt head carrier is expected to gradually increase. It can be determined and checked by a feeler gauge measurement and can be altered by changing the cylindrical rollers for rollers with a different diameter. Installing larger diameter rollers will increase the bolt gap and push the locking piece forward. Installing smaller diameter rollers results in the reverse effects.

===Bearing delay===

Bearing delay blowback uses a plurality of ball bearings to delay the movement of the bolt carrier group after firing. MEAN introduced Bearing delay blowback in 2023 with their Bearing Delay Upper Receiver chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum. This system uses the movement of three ball bearings arranged approximately 120° apart from one another that move in a radial direction relative to the center of their bolt. The bearings engage corresponding pockets of the barrel extension when the bolt carrier group is in battery. The bearings are pushed outward due to spring pressure (e.g., a buffer spring) that compresses the carrier into the rear of the bolt. The carrier causes an internal component of the bolt carrier group named the lifter to push the bearings outward. The Lifter has angled grooves that interact with the bearings. Bearing delay is designed to be tuned based on the user&#x27;s preference or configuration of other components by swapping to a lifter with a different geometry. The bearing delay design is described in , , , and .

===Lever-delayed===

Lever-delayed blowback utilizes leverage to put the bolt at a mechanical disadvantage, delaying the opening of the breech. When the cartridge pushes against the bolt face, the lever moves the bolt carrier rearward at an accelerated rate relative to the light bolt. Leverage can be applied with a dedicated part or through inclined surfaces interacting with each other. This leverage significantly increases resistance and slows the movement of the lightweight bolt. The reliable functioning of lever-delayed blowback arms is limited by specific ammunition and arm parameters like bullet weight, propellant charge, barrel length and amount of wear. John Pedersen patented one of the first known designs for a lever-delay system. The mechanism was also used by Hungarian arms designer Pál Király in the 1910s and 1930s and used in the Danuvia 39M and 43M submachine guns for the Hungarian Army. After World War II, Király settled in the Dominican Republic and developed the Cristóbal Carbine (or Király-Cristóbal Carbine) employing a similar mechanism. Other weapons to use this system are the Hogue Avenger and Benelli B76 pistols, the FNAB-43 submachine gun, the TKB-517, VAHAN and FAMAS assault rifles, the Sterling 7.62 and AVB-7.62 battle rifles/light machine guns, and the AA-52 general-purpose machine gun.

===Gas-delayed===
Gas-delayed blowback should not be confused with gas-operation. In gas-delayed guns the bolt is never locked, and so is pushed rearward by the expanding propellant gases, as in other blowback-based designs. However, propellant gases are vented from the barrel into a cylinder with a piston that delays the opening of the bolt. It was used by some World War II German designs for the 7.92×33mm Kurz cartridge, including the Volkssturmgewehr rifle (with little effectiveness) and the Grossfuss Sturmgewehr (with slightly more efficiency), and after the war by the Heckler &amp; Koch P7, Walther CCP, Steyr GB and M-77B pistols.

===Chamber-ring-delayed===

When a cartridge is fired, the case expands to seal the sides of the chamber. This seal prevents high-pressure gas from escaping into the action of the gun. Because a conventional chamber is slightly oversized, an unfired cartridge will enter freely. In a chamber-ring delayed firearm, the chamber is conventional in every respect except for a concave ring within the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired, the case expands into this recessed ring and pushes the bolt face rearward. As the case moves to the rear this ring constricts the expanded portion of the case. The energy required to squeeze the walls of the cartridge case slows the rearward travel of the case and slide, reducing their mass requirements. The first known use of the system was on the Fritz Mann pistol in 1920 and later on the High Standard Corp model T3 experimental pistol developed by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer while working for High Standard. Other firearms that used this system were the LWS Seecamp pistol, the AMT Automag II, and the Kimball .30 Carbine pistol. The SIG SG 510 rifle family incorporates a chamber ring near the shoulder which is used to avoid bolt-bounce rather than a delay element.

Similar operations exist using a fluted chamber for delay. When the round is fired, the cartridge sticks to the fluted chamber walls making a slight delay of extraction. The prototype 6x45mm SAW caliber Brunswick light machine gun is an example that used this operation.

Another example using a ported chamber that uses a barrel chamber with pressure relief ports that allow gas to leak into an annular chamber during extraction. Basically the opposite of a fluted chamber lubrication as it is intended for the cartridge to stick to the chamber wall making a slight delay of extraction. This requires a welded-on sleeve with an internal annular groove to contain the pressure.

===Hesitation locked===

John Pedersen&#x27;s patented system incorporates a breech block independent of the slide or bolt carrier. When in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder located in the frame of the firearm. When the cartridge is fired, the cartridge case, bolt and slide move together a short distance until the breech block strikes the locking shoulder and stops. The slide continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase while the breech remains locked. This allows chamber pressure to drop to safe levels once the bullet departs the barrel. The continuing motion of the slide lifts the breech block from its recess and pulls it rearward, continuing the firing cycle. Straight-walled cartridges are used in this operation as they are less prone to rupturing than tapered (conical) cartridges in firearms with bolt operations that instantly retract rounds when under high pressure from the chamber when firing. The Pedersen Remington Model 51 pistol, SIG MKMO submachine gun and R51 pistol are the only production firearms to have used this design.

===Flywheel delayed blowback===

Flywheel delayed blowback operation is where, during firing, the bolt opening is delayed by the rotational inertia of a flywheel. This is driven by a rack and pinion arrangement on the bolt carrier. The Barnitzke, Kazachok SMG, and the MGD PM-9 uses this operation.

===Toggle-delayed===
In toggle-delayed blowback firearms, the rearward motion of the breechblock must overcome significant mechanical leverage. The bolt is hinged in the middle, stationary at the rear end and nearly straight at rest. As the breech moves back under blowback power, the hinge joint moves upward. The leverage disadvantage keeps the breech from opening until the bullet has left the barrel and pressures have dropped to a safe level. This mechanism was used on the Pedersen rifle and Schwarzlose MG M.07/12 machine gun.

===Off-axis bolt travel===
John Browning developed this simple method whereby the axis of bolt movement was not in line with that of the bore probably during late WWI and patented it in 1921. The result was that a small rearward movement of the bolt in relation to the bore-axis required a greater movement along the axis of bolt movement, essentially magnifying the resistance of the bolt without increasing its mass. The French MAS-38 submachine gun of 1938 utilizes a bolt whose path of recoil is at an angle to the barrel. The Jatimatic and KRISS Vector use modified versions of this concept.

===Radial-delayed===

CMMG introduced the MkG carbine incorporating a radial-delay in 2017. This system uses the rotation of the bolt head to accelerate the bolt carrier of an AR-15 pattern rifle. The bolt locking lugs are adapted to incorporate 120° angles that rotate the bolt as it travels rearward under conventional blowback power. As the bolt rotates 22.5˚, it must accelerate the bolt carrier to the rear through an adapted 50° angle cam-pin slot. This acceleration amplifies the effective mass of the bolt carrier, slowing the speed of the bolt head. This delay allows pressure to drop prior to extraction without the penalty of a heavier bolt carrier assembly. The system is similar to roller and lever-delayed blowback in that it uses the mass of the bolt carrier moving at a faster rate than the bolt head to delay the action from opening. The design is described in .

===Screw-delayed===
First used on the Mannlicher Model 1893 automatic rifle, the bolt in screw-delayed blowback uses a turn bolt that was delayed by angled interrupted threads delayed by a quarter twist to unlock. John T. Thompson designed an autorifle that operated on a similar principle around 1920 and submitted it for trials with the US Army. This rifle, submitted multiple times, competed unsuccessfully against the Pedersen rifle and Garand primer-actuated rifle in early testing to replace the M1903 Springfield rifle. This operation is one of the most simple forms of delayed blowback but unless the ammunition is lubricated or uses a fluted chamber, the recoil can be volatile especially when using full length rifle rounds. Rotation of the bolt should be at least 90° to prevent ruptured cartridges. Another form of this operation using a helical screw to delay rearward movement was the Salvator-Dormus M1893 machine gun and later the prototype Kalashnikov Model 1942 submachine gun in 1942 and the Fox Wasp carbine.

===Detent-delayed===
Detent-delayed blowback uses a spring loaded detent installed inside the bolt (IE: a roll-pin) that locks itself into a notch on the end section of the guide rod closest to the barrel chamber rather than a section of the receiver/trunnion. Removing the detents from the bolt would turn the operation into a simple blowback operation. The Show Low Manufacturing Black-Jack pistol caliber carbine uses this operation.

==Other blowback systems==
===Floating chamber===
David Marshall Williams (a noted designer for the U.S. Ordnance Office and later Winchester) developed a mechanism to allow firearms designed for full-sized cartridges to fire .22 caliber rimfire ammunition reliably. His system used a small &quot;piston&quot; that incorporates the chamber. When the cartridge is fired, the front of the floating chamber is thrust back by gas pressure impinging on the front of the chamber as in a traditional piston. This, added to the blowback energy imparted on the cartridge, pushes the bolt back with greater energy than either force alone. Often described as &quot;accelerated blowback&quot;, this amplifies the otherwise anemic recoil energy of the .22 Rimfire cartridge. Williams designed a training version of the Browning machine gun and the Colt Service Ace .22 long rifle version of the M1911 using his system. The increased recoil produced by the floating chamber made these training guns behave more like their full-power counterparts while still using inexpensive low-power ammunition. The floating chamber is both a blowback and gas operated mechanism.

===Primer actuated===

Primer actuated firearms use the energy of primer setback to unlock and cycle the firearm. John Garand developed the system in an unsuccessful bid to replace the M1903 bolt-action rifle in the early 1920s. Garand&#x27;s prototypes worked well with US military .30-06 ammunition and uncrimped primers, but then the military changed from a fast burning gunpowder to a progressive burning Improved Military Rifle (IMR) powder. The slower pressure rise made the primer actuated prototypes unreliable, so Garand abandoned the design for a gas operated rifle that became the M1 Garand. AAI Corporation used a primer piston in a rifle submitted for the SPIW competition. Other rifles to use this system were the Postnikov APT and Clarke carbine as described in .

A similar system is used in the spotting rifles on the LAW 80 and Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon use a 9mm, .308 Winchester based cartridge with a .22 Hornet blank cartridge in place of the primer. Upon firing, the Hornet case sets back a short distance, unlocking the action.

===Case setback===
The case cartridge itself has been used experimentally to actuate the action similar to Garand&#x27;s primer-actuation. Known prototypes using this method of operation include two 1936 rifle designs, one by Mihail Mamontov and another by Makar Goryainov at TsKB-14, and a 1980s design by A.F. Barishev. The Mamontov and Goryainov rifles are only partially automatic; only the bolt unlocking is powered by the gases pushing the cartridge back, while the rest of the cycle (ejection, reloading) is done manually as in a traditional bolt-action rifle. A major problem with using the case cartridge as piston is that its motion is much faster (about 1 ms) compared to tapping gas further down the bore through a piston—about 5 ms in the Dragunov sniper rifle, which used the same cartridge as Mamontov&#x27;s rifle. Barishev made a fully automatic, but rather bulky mechanism that used a mechanical delay. In his system, the case cartridge pushed back a tilting bolt face, that upon reaching a certain angle pushes backwards an unlocking lever that continues farther before unlocking the bolt. The GRAU however still gave a negative evaluation of Barishev&#x27;s gun, pointing out that the main problems with reliability of firearms using the cartridge case as a piston were known since the 1930s and still unsolved.

==Limited-utility designs==
===Blish lock===

The Blish Lock is a breech locking mechanism designed by John Bell Blish based upon his observation that under extreme pressures, certain dissimilar metals will resist movement with a force greater than normal friction laws would predict. In modern engineering terminology, it is called static friction, or &quot;stiction&quot;. His locking mechanism was used in the Thompson submachine gun, Autorifle and Autocarbine designs. This dubious principle was later eliminated as redundant in the M1 and M1A1 versions of the submachine guns at the insistence of the US Army. Lubrication or fouling would completely defeat any delay. Whatever actual advantage a clean, unlubricated Blish system could impart could also be attained by adding a mere ounce of mass to the bolt.

===Savage rotating barrel===
The Savage system employed the theory that the rifling in the barrel caused a rotational force that would hold the gun locked until the projectile left the barrel. It was later discovered that the bullet had left the barrel long before any locking could occur. Savage pistols were in fact operating as simple blow back firearms. The French MAB PA-15 and PA-8 9mm pistols feature a similar design and work correctly.

===Headspace actuated unlocking===
An unusual operation that uses a bolt head that moves rearwards when firing that allows the cartridge to move backwards or even stretching it until the bolt unlocks. When firing the cartridge moves the bolt head rearwards around 2.5mm until it stops, then rotates the bolt to unlock and cycle the operation.

===Magnet delay===
An operation using a &quot;simple blowback&quot; type bolt that has neodymium magnets to delay its operation. A special buffer using this operation has been developed by TACCOM.

===Pneumatic delay===

Pneumatic/hydraulic delay is where using a &quot;simple blowback&quot; type bolt with the air pressure delaying the operation. The Suomi KP/-31 and the Moore submachine gun is an example that uses this operation.

==Other autoloading systems==
Other autoloading systems are:
* Blow forward, which is similar to blowback, but with the whole barrel being pushed forward rather than the bolt pushed back.
* Recoil operation uses the rearward movement of parts of the weapon counter to the ejecta (bullet and propellant) moving forward, as described by Newton&#x27;s third law of motion.
* Gas-operated reloading

<doc id="1231628" wikidata="Q17009457" url="?curid=1231628" title="Hello (Poe album)">
<text>Hello is the debut album by the American singer-songwriter Poe. It was released in 1995 on Modern Records.

==Background==
Aside from the Detroit studio of album producer RJ Rice, the recording of &quot;Hello&quot; took place at a variety of studios in Los Angeles.

The first music video for the album was for the single &quot;Angry Johnny&quot;; it featured Poe on the skeletal frame of a bed looking forlorn whilst destroying a variety of effects one might associate with romance (like roses or a box of chocolates). The song&#x27;s rage-filled lyrics quickly found her being lumped into the &quot;angry female rocker&quot; category, and the video was heavily played on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Alternative Nation&quot;. The second single, &quot;Hello&quot;, did not fare as well, until a remix version was released two years after the album&#x27;s initial release. At least one other track (Junkie) was remixed as well, since the 1999 CD-quality download of &#x27;Hello&#x27; contains a version of &#x27;Junkie&#x27; with more instrument layers (horns and warbly guitar) that is 6 seconds shorter than the 3:06 original.

&quot;Hello&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on November 20, 1996.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;Poe has enough personality to keep the pleasant and occasionally intriguing album her own, but not enough to make it a strong statement.&quot; &quot;MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide&quot; called the album &quot;a mess of over-personal, overproduced folk songs,&quot; aside from &quot;Trigger Happy Jack&quot; and &quot;Angry Johnny.&quot; &quot;Tulsa World&quot; wrote that Poe &quot;rips and rocks, but she doesn&#x27;t kick out the jams at the expense of the songcraft.&quot; Glen Ballard in an interview on Spotify&#x27;s Landmark series quoted &quot;Around the time, I was making this record Jagged Little Pill, I heard some tracks by an artist named Poe. I heard a couple of these things and it really blew my mind. As much as anything, the Poe record, &quot;Hello&quot;, was probably the biggest influence I had at that time, honestly, because it was a brilliant record that had jazz influence, hip hop, electronic, rock. It was a hybrid of the first degree.&quot;

<text>James Lee Hart (also known as John Hart, born February 23, 1944) is a white supremacist, segregationist activist and political candidate in Buchanan, Tennessee.

==Beliefs==
Hart describes himself as an advocate of eugenics, saying that the United States should be repopulated with members of the &quot;favored races&quot; of Europe and Asia and not the &quot;less-favored races&quot; of Africa. Without such an ethnic cleansing, he argues, &quot;we are now in danger of degenerating back to the level of the subhuman primate once again.&quot; In a campaign brochure, he wrote: &quot;We whites don’t hold minorities back. The minorities hold us back and destroy the civilizations that we create whether in Zimbabwe or Detroit.&quot;

Hart has cited the suicide of his 29-year-old son in 2001 as motivation for his political efforts.

==Political campaigns==
Hart ran for Congress in 2002 as an independent, winning 2.55% of the vote. But he first gained notice in 2004 when he ran as a Republican for the House of Representatives for Tennessee&#x27;s Eighth District. As the only candidate on the primary ballot (facing only a write-in campaign), he won the Republican nomination, despite listing an out-of-state address in candidate filings. The state Republican Party disavowed his candidacy, describing his views on race as &quot;abhorrent and outrageous&quot; and urging &quot;all Republicans and Tennesseans to reject the candidacy of James Hart wholly and unequivocally.&quot; Hart lost to incumbent Democrat John Tanner, receiving 25.6% of the vote.

He attempted to run again in 2006, but Republican state leadership successfully petitioned to have him removed from the ballot on the grounds that he was not a &quot;bona fide&quot; member of the party. Hart&#x27;s attorney in the matter was Richard Barrett, the Mississippi white nationalist leader. He made further attempts in 2008 and 2010, but Republican state leaders were again successful in keeping him off the G.O.P. ballot, pushing him to run as an independent.

He has continued to seek the 8th District seat; in 2022, running as an independent on behalf of &quot;the blue-collar white working man,&quot; he received 2,541 votes, 1.2% of all votes cast. He has also been an independent candidate in elections for the Tennessee House of Representatives at least six times.

<text>Jazzology Records is an American jazz record company and label. It is part of the Jazzology group of labels owned and operated by the George H. Buck Jr. Jazz Foundation.

Jazzology Records was founded in 1949 by George H. Buck, Jr. That year he recorded Art Hodes, Wild Bill Davison, and Tony Parenti. Buck did not record again until 1954, when he created his GHB Records label to concentrate on Dixieland jazz. Over time he released music on other labels that he acquired: American Music Records, Audiophile, Black Swan, Circle, Progressive, Solo Art, and Southland.

<text>VT-4 or Training Squadron 4 is a training squadron of the United States Navy. Initially established as Basic Training Group 9 (BTG-9) in the 1950s, the squadron was redesignated as Training Squadron 4 (VT-4) on 1 May 1960 and based at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

==General information==
*Advanced training for USN Naval Flight Officers (NFO) destined for E-2 Hawkeye, E-6 Mercury, EP-3 Aries, and P-8 Poseidon aircraft.
*The squadron&#x27;s radio callsign is &quot;Buck&quot;.

==History==
Its original mission was providing flight instruction for US Navy and US Marine Corps Student Naval Aviators in the basic jet training syllabus utilizing the T-2A version of the T-2 Buckeye aircraft.

In 1965, Training Squadron FOUR transitioned to the T-2B aircraft and its mission was modified to become the Naval Air Training Command&#x27;s sole site for providing student pilots with basic jet flight instruction in aerial gunnery and carrier qualification.
In 1971, Training Squadron FOUR transitioned to the T-2C aircraft. The squadron mission was changed once again, to provide flight training in all phases of the basic jet syllabus.

In September 1972, Training Squadron FOUR acquired the TF-9J providing flight instruction in both basic and advanced jet training. This mission was unique in the Naval Air Training Command in that student pilots experienced their first flight in a jet aircraft in VT-4 and remained aboard to be subsequently designated Naval Aviators.

November 1973 saw the introduction of the TA-4J to replace the aging TF-9J for advanced flight training.

Beginning in December 1975, VT-4 had the added mission of providing flight instruction for allied foreign military pilots. Flight training has been given to student pilots from Kuwait, Spain, Singapore and Indonesia.

In addition to pilot training, VT-4 has had two other significant missions. From 1973 to 1978, VT-4 provided summer jet orientation flights for midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy and the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. From 1975 to 1979, VT-4 was also responsible for the training of Naval Flight Surgeons.

In December 1985, VT-4&#x27;s mission was changed from strike training to the sole site of E-2/C-2 intermediate training in CNATRA. In this role, the squadron carrier qualified Student Naval Aviators from the multiengine training pipeline, informally called the &quot;prop pipeline,&quot; who we selected to eventually fly the E-2 Hawkeye and C-2 Greyhound aircraft in the Fleet. Graduates of VT-4 would receive their wings and designations as Naval Aviators and proceed to the Fleet Replacement Squadron.

In January 1992, VT-4&#x27;s mission became the E-2/C-2 advanced training site. To accomplish this mission VT-4 flew the T-2C.

During 1996, VT-4 underwent significant change. From a small all Navy Advanced E-2/C-2 pilot training squadron with a student throughput of 36 per year, it became a joint Primary and Intermediate Naval Flight Officer/Navigator training squadron with an annual student throughput of 450. Instructor ranks grew from fourteen Navy pilots to 71 Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force pilots and NFO/Navigators. The squadron transitioned from flying the T-2C to flying the T-34C Turbo Mentor and T-1A Jayhawk. VT-4 also instructs student navigators from Germany, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Norway and Denmark. From April to September 1996 the squadron had primary NFO/NAV and advanced pilot training being conducted simultaneously. Following the final CQ detachment in September, the mission converted entirely to NFO/NAV training. On 30 September 1996, the last VT-4 Naval Aviators earned their wings.

In January 2003, VT-4 initiated instructor orientation flights in the T-6A &quot;Texan II&quot;, the joint Air Force/Navy platform slated to replace the T-34C as the Primary phase syllabus trainer. The T-6A &quot;Texan II&quot; is a single engine, two-seat trainer which is fully aerobatic. It features a pressurized cockpit, a G-tolerance enhancement system and dual zero-zero ejection seats. The T-6A utilizes a state-of-the-art digital cockpit to help familiarize students with what they will encounter in their fleet tours.

In August 2003, VT-4 marked its first training flight in the T-6A &quot;Texan II&quot;.

In April 2005, VT-4 completed the transition to the T-6A &quot;Texan II&quot; and flew its last T-34C &quot;Turbomentor&quot; student sortie.

In December 2010, VT-4 was deactivated and all VT-4 instructors and students became a part of VT-10. VT-4 was reactivated in June 2013, no longer flying the T-39 Sabreliner and has introduced the Multicrew Simulator (MCS) to TRAWING SIX. VT-4 is the winging squadron for all NFOs destined for the E-2 Hawkeye, E-6 Mercury, EP-3 Aries, P-3 Orion and P-8 Poseidon, relieving the respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRS) for those type/model/series (T/M/S) aircraft of that responsibility.

Since its establishment, VT-4 has amassed over 600,000 flight hours. The squadron has logged 42,000 carrier landings.

<doc id="1231662" wikidata="Q5299706" url="?curid=1231662" title="Double Dare (video game)">
<text>Double Dare is a video game published by GameTek and based on the Nickelodeon game show &quot;Double Dare.&quot; The game was originally released by for IBM PC compatibles and the Commodore 64 in 1988. It was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by Rare and re-released for the system in 1990.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Double Dare&quot; can be played by one or two players; single players compete against the computer. Before the game starts, players enter their team names and select from four male and four female avatar. Whichever avatar the player picks, the teammate will be of the opposite gender. The game can also be set for one of three levels of difficulty with higher levels offering less time to answer questions and a more difficult computer opponent.

The game plays exactly like its television counterpart, with two rounds of 10-question trivia rounds and a third round featuring an obstacle course. The rules and scoring from the game show all apply. Toss-up challenges determine which team gets initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player determines the precise speed and angle of whatever object they are throwing to hit a target. Physical challenges are played the same way. Each player uses the up or down arrows on the controller to choose answers for trivia questions. The player with the most money at the end of round two proceeds to the obstacle course.

In order to move through an obstacle, the player needs to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller&#x27;s D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player needs to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception, a triangular jungle gym) and are randomized before a game.

Virtual prizes for beating the obstacle course include a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with an exotic vacation received for completing the last obstacle.

==Reception==
David &amp; Robin Minnick reviewed &quot;Double Dare&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; for &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; and said &quot;Any fan of the TV games will enjoy these 64 versions. And even if you&#x27;re not a fan, we think you&#x27;ll get a kick out of these games anyway.&quot;

<doc id="1231673" wikidata="Q945835" url="?curid=1231673" title="Local extinction">
<text>Local extinction, also extirpation, is the termination of a species (or other taxon) in a chosen geographic area of study, though it still exists elsewhere. Local extinctions are contrasted with global extinctions.

Local extinctions mark a change in the ecology of an area. It has sometimes been followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations, such as with wolf reintroduction.

==Discussion==

Glaciation is one factor that leads to local extinction. This was the case during the Pleistocene glaciation event in North America. During this period, most of the native North American species of earthworm were killed in places covered by glaciation. This left them open for colonization by European earthworms brought over in soil from Europe.

Species naturally become extinct from islands over time; this can be either local extinction if the species also occurs elsewhere, or in cases of island endemism, outright extinction. The number of species an island can support is limited by its geographical size. Because many islands were relatively recently formed due to climate change at the end of the Pleistocene when the sea level rose, and these islands most likely had the same complement of species as found on the mainland, counting the species which still survive at present on a statistically large enough amount of islands will give the parameters with which certain groups of species such as plants or birds will become less biodiverse on a given island over a given period of time, depending on its size. The same calculations can also be applied to determine when species will disappear from nature parks (&#x27;islands&#x27; in many senses), mountain tops and mesas (see sky islands), forest remnants or other such distributional patches. This research also demonstrates that certain species are more prone to extinction than others, a species has an intrinsic extinction-ability (incidence function).

Some species exploit or require transient or disturbed habitats, such as vernal pools, a human gut, or burnt woodland after forest fires, and are characterised by highly fluctuating population numbers and shifting distributional patterns. Many natural ecosystems cycle through a standard succession, pioneer species disappear from a region as the ecosystem matures and reaches a climax community.

A local extinction can be useful for research: in the case of the bay checkerspot butterfly, scientists, including Paul R. Ehrlich, chose not to intervene as a population disappeared from an area in order to study the process.

Many crocodilian species have experienced localized extinction, particularly the saltwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus porosus&quot;), which has been extirpated from Vietnam, Thailand, Java, and many other areas.

Major environmental events, such as volcanic eruptions, may lead to large numbers of local extinctions, such as with the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption, which led to a fern spike extinction.

Heat waves can lead to local extinction. In New Zealand, during the summer of 2017–2018, sea surface temperatures around parts of South Island exceeded , which was well above normal. Air temperatures were also high, exceeding . These high temperatures, coupled with small wave height, led to the local extinction of bull kelp (&quot;Durvillaea&quot; spp.) from Pile Bay.

Lagoa Santa, a lake located in Lagoa Santa, Brazil, has lost almost 70% of the local fish species over the last 150 years. These include &quot;Acestrorhynchus lacustris&quot;, &quot;Astyanax fasciatus&quot;, and &quot;Characidium zebra&quot;. This could be caused by the introduction of non-native species, like &quot;Tilapia rendalli&quot;, into the lagoon, changes in water level and organic pollution.

Local extinctions can be reversed, in some cases artificially. Wolves are a species that have been reintroduced into parts of their historical range. This has happened with red wolves (&quot;Canis rufus&quot;) in the United States in the late 1980s and also grey wolves in Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s. There have been talks of reintroducing wolves in Scotland, Japan, and Mexico.

==Subpopulations and stocks==
When the local population of a certain species disappears from a certain geographical delimitation, whether fish in a drying pond or an entire ocean, it can be said to be extirpated or locally extinct in that pond or ocean. 

A particular total world population can be more or less arbitrarily divided into &#x27;stocks&#x27; or &#x27;subpopulations&#x27;, defined by political or other geographical delimitations. For example, the Cetacean Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the conservation status of the Black Sea stock of harbour porpoise (&quot;Phocoena phocoena&quot;) that touches six countries, and COSEWIC, which only assesses the conservation status of wildlife in Canada, even assesses Canadian species that occur in the United States or other countries.

While the IUCN mostly only assesses the global conservation status of species or subspecies, in some older cases it also assessed the risks to certain stocks and populations, in some cases these populations may be genetically distinct. In all, 119 stocks or subpopulations across 69 species had been assessed by the IUCN in 2006. If a local stock or population becomes extinct, the species as a whole has not become extinct, but extirpated from that local area.

Examples of stocks and subdivisions of world populations assessed separately by the IUCN for their conservation status are:
* Marsh deer (three populations assessed)
* Blue whale, North Pacific and North Atlantic stocks
* Bowhead whale, &quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot; (five populations assessed, from critically endangered to LR/cd)
* Lake sturgeon, &quot;Acipenser fulvescens&quot;, Mississippi &amp; Missouri Basins population assessed as vulnerable
* Wild common carp, &quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot; (distribution in the River Danube)
* Black-flanked rock-wallaby &quot;Petrogale lateralis&quot; (MacDonnell Ranges population and Western Kimberly population)

The IUCN also lists countries where assessed species, subspecies or geographic populations are found, and from which countries they have been extirpated or reintroduced.

<text>The mysterious letters (&quot;muqaṭṭaʿāt&quot;, &quot;ḥurūf muqaṭṭaʿāt&quot;, &quot;disjoined letters&quot; or &quot;disconnected letters&quot;) are combinations of between one and five Arabic letters that appear at the beginning of 29 out of the 114 chapters (surahs) of the Quran just after the Bismillāh Islamic phrase. The letters are also known as &quot;fawātiḥ&quot; () or &quot;openers&quot; as they form the opening verse of their respective surahs.

Four (or five) chapters are named for their &quot;muqaṭṭaʿāt&quot;: &quot;Ṭā-Hā&quot;, &quot;Yā-Sīn&quot;, &quot;Ṣād&quot;, &quot;Qāf&quot;, and sometimes Nūn.

The original significance of the letters is unknown. Tafsir (exegesis) has interpreted them as abbreviations for either names or qualities of God or for the names or content of the respective surahs. The general belief of most Muslims is that their meaning is known only to Allah.

==Inventory==
&quot;Muqatta&#x27;at&quot; occur in Quranic chapters 2–3, 7, 10–15, 19–20, 26–32, 36, 38, 40–46, 50 and 68. Furthermore, the codex of Ubayy ibn Ka&#x27;b additionally had Surah 39 begin with &quot;Ḥā Mīm&quot;, in line with the pattern seen in the next seven surahs. Multiple letters are written together like a word, but each letter is pronounced separately. They are 78 in total, at the beginning of 29 surahs, occurring in 14 distinct combinations. Fourteen out of 28 (or 29, counting &quot;hamza&quot;) letters of the Arabic alphabet are represented.

== Interpretations ==
===Acrophony / abbreviations===
Abd Allah ibn Abbas and Abdullah ibn Masud, are said to have favored the view that these letters stand for words or phrases related to God and His Attributes.

Christoph Luxenberg in &quot;The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran&quot; (2000)
proposed that substantial portions of the text of the Qur&#x27;an were directly taken from Syriac liturgy. His explanation of the disjoined letters is that they are remnants of indications for the liturgical recitation for the Syriac hymns that ended up being copied into the Arabic text. Devin J. Stewart argues the letters are integral to the text and establish a rhyme and a rhythm, similarly to rhyming chants such as, intended to introduce spells, charms or something connected to the supernatural. 

Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, a classical commentator of the Qur&#x27;an, has noted some twenty opinions regarding these letters and mentions multiple opinions that these letters present the names of the Surahs as appointed by God. In addition, he mentions that Arabs would name things after such letters (for example, &#x27;eye&#x27; as &#x27;ع&#x27;, clouds as &#x27;غ&#x27;, and whale as &#x27;ن&#x27;). Amin Ahsan Islahi supported al-Razi&#x27;s opinion, arguing that since these letters are names for Surahs, they are proper nouns. 
Hamiduddin Farahi similarly attaches symbolic meanings to the letters, e.g. Nun (ن) symbolizing &quot;fish&quot; identifying the sura that mentions Jonah, or Ta (ط) representing &quot;serpent&quot; introducing suras that mention the story of Prophet Moses and serpents.

Ahsan ur Rehman (2013) claims that there are phonological, syntactic and semantic links between the prefixed letters and the text of the chapters.

===Scribal intrusion or corruption===
Theodor Nöldeke (1860) advanced the theory that the letters were marks of possession, belonging to the owners of Qur&#x27;anic copies used in the first collection by Zayd ibn Thābit during the reign of the Caliph &#x27;Uthmān. According to Nöldeke, the letters ultimately entered the final version of the Qur&#x27;an due to carelessness. It was also possible that the letters were monograms of the owners. Nöldeke later revised this theory, responding to Otto Loth&#x27;s (1881) suggestion that the letters had a distinct connection with the mystic figures and symbols of the Jewish Kabbalah. Nöldeke in turn concluded that the letters were a mystical reference to the archetypal text in heaven that was the basis for the revelation of the Qur&#x27;an. However, persuaded by Nöldeke&#x27;s original theory, Hartwig Hirschfeld (1902) offered a list of likely names corresponding to the letters. Keith Massey (1996), noting the apparent set ranking of the letters and mathematical improbability that they were either random or referred to words or phrases, argued for some form of the Nöldeke-Hirschfeld theory that the &quot;Mystery Letters&quot; were the initials or monograms of the scribes who originally transcribed the sūras. Though, Massey explains that &quot;the letters, which appear alone (qaf, nun), may not have the same purpose as the collection themselves&quot;, he furthermore admits that the &quot;Mystery Letters&quot; in Surah 42 violate his proposed ranking-theory, thus offering 2 possible scenarios for his theory.

The Hebrew Theory assumes that the letters represent an import from Biblical Hebrew. 
Specifically, the combination &quot;Alif-Lam&quot; would correspond to Hebrew El &quot;god&quot;.
Abbreviations from Aramaic or Greek have also been suggested.

Bellamy (1973) proposed that the letters are the remnants of abbreviations for the Bismillah. Bellamy&#x27;s suggestion was criticized as improbable by Alford T. Welch (1978).

===Numerology===
There have been attempts to give numerological interpretations. Loth (1888) suggested a connection to Gematria. Rashad Khalifa (1974) claimed to have discovered a mathematical code in the Qur&#x27;an based on these initials and the number 19, namely the Quran code or known as Code 19. According to his claims, these initials occur throughout their respective chapters in multiples of nineteen. The number 19 is directly mentioned in the 30th verse of Surah Al-Muddaththir to refer to the 19 keeper angels of Hell.

The Báb used the muqaṭṭaʿāt in his Qayyúmu&#x27;l-Asmáʼ. He writes in an early commentary and in his &quot;Dalá&#x27;il-i-Sab&#x27;ih&quot; (Seven Proofs) about a hadith from Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Shiʻi Imam, where it is stated that the first seven surat&#x27;s muqaṭṭaʿāt have a numerical value of 1267, from which the year 1844 (the year of the Báb&#x27;s declaration) can be derived.

===Mystical===

Sufism has a tradition of attributing mystical significance to the letters. 
The details differ between schools of Sufism; Sufi tradition generally regards the letters as an extension to the ninety-nine names of God, with some authors offering specific &quot;hidden&quot; meanings for the individual letters.

In 1857–58, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, founder of the Baháʼí Faith, wrote his &quot;Commentary on the Isolated Letters&quot; (&quot;Tafsír-i-Hurúfát-i-Muqattaih&quot;, also known as &quot;Lawh-i-Áyiy-i-Núr&quot;, &quot;Tablet of the Light Verse&quot;). In it, he describes how God created the letters. A black teardrop fell down from the Primordial Pen on the &quot;Perspicuous, Snow-white Tablet&quot;, by which the Point was created. The Point then turned into an Alif (vertical stroke), which was again transformed, after which the Muqatta&#x27;at appeared. These letters were then differentiated, separated and then again gathered and linked together, appearing as the &quot;names and attributes&quot; of creation. Baháʼu&#x27;lláh gives various interpretations of the letters &quot;alif, lam, mim&quot;, mostly relating to Allah, trusteeship (&quot;wilayah&quot;) and the prophethood (&quot;nubuwwah&quot;) of Muhammad. He emphasizes the central role of the &quot;alif&quot; in all the worlds of God.

By removing the duplicate letters (leaving only one of each of the 14 initials) and rearranging them, one can create the sentence &quot;نص حكيم قاطع له سر &quot; which could translate to: &quot;A wise and conclusive text has a secret&quot;.

One Western mystical interpretation of the muqattaʿat is given by Rudolf von Sebottendorf in his work &quot;Die Praxis der alten türkischen Freimauerei&quot;; von Sebottendorf interprets them as mantra-like formulas (&quot;Formel&quot;) to be meditated upon (in association with certain gestures) during a set of elaborate meditation exercises. He claims that these exercises are the basis of Freemasonry and alchemy, and that they are practiced by a secret society of Sufis; Muhammad is said to have learned these exercises from a hermit named &quot;Ben Khasi&quot;, taught them to the innermost circle of his successors, and incorporated them into the text of the Qur&#x27;an in order to preserve them unchanged in perpetuity. Commentators, however, note that the practices recommended by von Sebottendorf &quot;bear little resemblance to either Sufism or Masonry&quot;.

== Structural analysis ==

There are 14 distinct combinations; the most frequent are &quot;ʾAlif Lām Mīm&quot; and &quot;Ḥāʾ Mīm&quot;, occurring six times each. Of the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet, exactly one half appear as muqatta&#x27;at, either singly or in combinations of two, three, four or five letters. The fourteen letters are:
&quot;ʾalif&quot; أ,
&quot;hā&quot; هـ,
&quot;ḥā&quot; ح,
&quot;ṭā&quot; ط,
&quot;yā&quot; ي,
&quot;kāf&quot; ك,
&quot;lām&quot; ل,
&quot;mīm&quot; م,
&quot;nūn&quot; ن,
&quot;sīn&quot; س,
&quot;ʿain&quot; ع,
&quot;ṣād&quot; ص,
&quot;qāf&quot; ق,
&quot;rā&quot; ر.
The six final letters of the Abjadi order (&quot;thakhadh ḍaẓagh&quot;) are unused. 
The letters represented correspond to those letters written without Arabic diacritics plus &quot;yāʿ&quot; ي.
It is possible that the restricted set of letters was supposed to invoke an archaic variant of the Arabic alphabet modeled on the Aramaic alphabet.

Certain co-occurrence restrictions are observable in these letters; for instance, &quot;ʾAlif&quot; is invariably followed by Lām. The substantial majority of the combinations begin either &quot;ʾAlif Lām&quot; or &quot;Ḥāʾ Mīm&quot;.

In all but 3 of the 29 cases, these letters are almost immediately followed by mention of the Qur&#x27;anic revelation itself (the exceptions are surat al-ʻAnkabūt, ar-Rūm and al-Qalam); and some argue that even these three cases should be included, since mention of the revelation is made later on in the surah. More specifically, one may note that in 8 cases the following verse begins &quot;These are the signs...&quot;, and in another 5 it begins &quot;The Revelation...&quot;; another 3 begin &quot;By the Qur&#x27;an...&quot;, and another 2 &quot;By the Book...&quot; Additionally, all but 3 of these suras are Meccan surat (the exceptions are surat al-Baqarah, Āl ʾImrān and ar-Raʻd.)

&quot;Lām&quot; and &quot;Mīm&quot; are conjoined and both are written with prolongation mark.
One letter is written in two styles. Letter 20:01 is used only in the beginning and middle of a word and that in 19:01 is not used as such. Alif Lām Mīm (الم) is also the first verse of Surah Al-Baqara, Surah Al-Imran, Surah Al-Ankabut, Surah Ar-Rum, Surah Luqman, and Surah As-Sajda.

<text>Glenn W. Schwartz (March 20, 1940 – November 2, 2018) was an American guitarist who first came to the attention of rock music audiences as the original guitar player of the James Gang, based in Cleveland, Ohio.

==Career==

Schwartz left the James Gang in late December 1967 when he moved to California. He later joined the Los Angeles-based blues band Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and, in 1970, scored a national top 20 hit with the song &quot;Are You Ready?&quot;.

Tired of the rock and roll lifestyle, he left PG&amp;E to join a pioneering Gospel rock group All Saved Freak Band, which was the musical evangelistic arm of an Ohio religious group-turned-cult, the Church of the Risen Christ, headed by Larry Hill. Schwartz&#x27;s life in this cult with Rev. Larry Hill is explored in the book, &quot;Fortney Road: Life, Death, and Deception in a Christian Cult&quot; by Jeff C. Stevenson (2015). All told, Schwartz recorded four albums with the Freak Band before leaving it in 1980.

Through the 1990s and 2000s, Schwartz played weekly blues gigs every Thursday at Major Hoopples just outside Cleveland&#x27;s The Flats neighborhood, often with his brother Gene playing bass. Changes at venues and increasing health issues kept him from playing live for a few years after 2010, but Schwartz returned to the stage for a 75th birthday show and an impromptu jam at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival with Joe Walsh and The Arcs, featuring Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. As of 2016, Schwartz had brought his celebrated guitar playing – and preacher-style stage presence – back to Cleveland bars regularly and has gone back into a Nashville studio with Auerbach.

==Christian conversion==
While in Los Angeles on tour with the James Gang in 1967, Schwartz strolled onto the infamous Sunset Strip and stopped next to a small group of people listening to street preacher Arthur Blessitt, according to Stevenson&#x27;s book. Some time later he professed conversion to Christianity, saying &quot;I was finally blessed by mercy for I heard the Gospel of Christ.&quot;

Following his conversion, his zealous, new-found faith was not accepted well by the band, his family or his friends. As per Stevenson, Schwartz said: &quot;I had some Christian friends who had some round stickers that read &#x27;Real Peace Is in Jesus&#x27; and we stuck those all over our clothes ... We put some on Janis Joplin but she didn&#x27;t like it and took them off. I remember she got pretty upset. At the time, the bikers [Hell&#x27;s Angels] really liked my music and style of guitar playing because it was so out of control like they were. They didn&#x27;t mind I talked about Jesus because they liked the music. But Janis was pretty rude and nasty to them and I know they didn&#x27;t like Janis or her music&quot;.

==Death==
Schwartz died on November 2, 2018, at the age of 78.

<text>Columbia Masterworks was a record label started in 1924 by Columbia Records. In 1980, it was separated from the Columbia label and renamed CBS Masterworks. In 1990, it was revived as Sony Classical after its sale to the Sony Corporation.

==History==

When Columbia Records undertook the project of releasing great classical music for domestic sale in America, the label was still a year away from an &quot;electrical&quot; recording process. In November 1924, the first eight releases had been recorded acoustically. These first eight sets included five symphonic recordings—Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh and Eighth Symphonies, Dvorak&#x27;s &quot;From the New World&quot;, Mozart&#x27;s E-Flat Major (No. 39), and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Pathetique&quot;. Three recordings by quartets were also part of that initial offering. More releases followed in March 1925, and a staggering 18 sets were added that fall. The prices of these sets varied with the number of included discs, from $4.50 to $10.50.

Under the leadership of Columbia&#x27;s president Goddard Lieberson, who later added the rest of the Columbia label to his portfolio, a great many notable classical artists made contributions to the Columbia Masterworks library, such as the conductors Leonard Bernstein, Eugene Ormandy and George Szell; pianists Walter Gieseking, Oscar Levant and Glenn Gould; and the organist E. Power Biggs. Composers Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky also appeared conducting their own works.

==Broadway albums==

In addition to classical music, Columbia also issued cast recordings, soundtrack albums, and spoken-word recordings under the Masterworks name. One of the first spoken word albums of historical significance was the Masterworks release of ten scenes from the Mercury Theatre&#x27;s Broadway production of &quot;Caesar&quot; (Columbia Masterworks Set No. 325), recorded in March 1938 and released in 1939. Sales were such that Columbia engaged Welles and the Mercury Theatre to produce four Shakespeare plays (&quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;) for the phonograph in 1939 and 1940. The sets were opulently bound and included a hardcover book.
The first wildly successful spoken word album was a 1948 Masterworks entry, the first &quot;I Can Hear It Now&quot; album (Columbia M-800 and ML-4095), edited by Edward R. Murrow and Fred W. Friendly and supervised by former CBS staffer J.G. Gude. The album would lead to three sequels, the &quot;Hear It Now&quot; program on the CBS Radio Network in 1950 and the CBS-TV successor, &quot;See It Now&quot;, in 1951. Columbia Masterworks was also the first recording company to release an album of a nearly complete stage production—the record-breaking 1943 Broadway revival of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, starring Paul Robeson, José Ferrer and Uta Hagen. This was released in 1945 as a 17-record 78-RPM album in two binders (M-MM-554), and afterwards as a three-LP set (SL-153). Many years later, in 1962, Columbia Masterworks would release a four-LP album of the complete &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, starring its original Broadway cast: Uta Hagen, Arthur Hill, George Grizzard and Melinda Dillon. And in 1964, Columbia Masterworks would release a complete album of the 1964 Broadway revival of &quot;Richard Burton&#x27;s Hamlet&quot;, starring Richard Burton and directed by John Gielgud—the longest-running &quot;Hamlet&quot; in Broadway history to date.

Columbia Masterworks&#x27; most successful Broadway album was the original cast recording of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (OL-5090, 1956), starring Rex Harrison, Julie Andrews, Stanley Holloway and Robert Coote. This first album was issued only in mono, but the first stereo recording of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;—featuring the same four stars, this time with the London cast—followed in 1959. And in 1964, Columbia Masterworks issued the film soundtrack album of the show, starring Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s &quot;singing voice&quot;, Marni Nixon. The most successful film soundtrack release on Columbia Masterworks was the film version of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, released as OS-2070 in 1961 and being certified triple-platinum as of 2017. Next on the list is &quot;The Graduate&quot;, released in 1968 as OS-3180, featuring the music of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, then the best-selling pop music act on the roster of the parent Columbia label. Partly as a result of the immense popularity of this release, Columbia Masterworks also released a spoken-word recording of excerpts from the soundtrack of the Dustin Hoffman film &quot;Little Big Man&quot;.

Columbia Masterworks was also responsible for the original cast albums of &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; (1948) and &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1949), as well as for the original stage album of &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1957), and the original cast recordings of &quot;&quot; (1959), &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (again 1959), &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; (1958), and &quot;Camelot&quot; (1960). In 1946, Columbia Masterworks released the first album of &quot;Show Boat&quot; featuring the cast of an actual production of the show, not just one or two singers from it as had been done before. This 1946 revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, which starred Jan Clayton, Charles Fredericks, Carol Bruce, Ralph Dumke, and Kenneth Spencer, was the longest-running revival of a show up to that time. They also released a long series of studio cast albums of Broadway shows, such as &quot;The Student Prince&quot;, &quot;The Desert Song&quot;, &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;, &quot;Oh, Kay!&quot;, and again, &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

==Electronic music==

Another genre that Columbia Masterworks released some seminal albums in was electronic music. Early 1964 saw the release of &quot;Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center&quot;, a compilation of avant-garde electronic compositions created at the famed studio by Bulent Arel, Milton Babbitt, Vladimir Ussachevsky, and others. In 1968, Wendy Carlos&#x27;s landmark electronic-music album &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, containing transcriptions of a number of Bach&#x27;s most famous compositions for the Moog synthesizer, was issued on Columbia Masterworks, which continued to release Carlos&#x27;s output until the mid-1980s. Terry Riley&#x27;s &quot;A Rainbow in Curved Air&quot; was released in the summer of 1969. Morton Subotnick&#x27;s &quot;Sidewinder&quot; followed in 1971. The label also released several other classical-meets-synthesiser albums in the wake of the &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; success.

==1980 and later==
Columbia Masterworks was renamed CBS Masterworks in 1980 and separated from the Columbia label. In 1990, it was renamed Sony Classical because of the sale of CBS Records to the Sony Corporation.

The Masterworks name lives on in the label&#x27;s Broadway album label, Masterworks Broadway as well as the name of the label&#x27;s parent Sony Masterworks.

<doc id="1231706" wikidata="Q3401736" url="?curid=1231706" title="Emrys ap Iwan">
<text>Emrys ap Iwan (born Robert Ambrose Jones; 24 March 1848 – 6 January 1906) was a Welsh literary critic and writer on politics and religion. He is often seen as one of the most important forerunners of modern Welsh nationalism.

Born in Abergele, Denbighshire, Emrys was the son of a gardener who was employed on a nearby estate. After working in a shop in Liverpool for a time he trained at Bala Theological College. In 1874, he went to Lausanne, Switzerland, to teach English in a private school and to study languages, developing a love of the French language and literature which had a great influence on his later writings. He later went to Germany to teach English in Bonn and Gießen.

On Emrys&#x27;s return to Wales, the Calvinistic Methodist church refused to ordain him a minister because of his opposition to the policy of building English-language chapels in mainly Welsh-speaking areas of Wales. He was eventually ordained a minister in 1884 and then served as a pastor to several churches in Denbighshire, including Rhewl and Ruthin, for the rest of his life.
Emrys ap Iwan was a fervent advocate of the Welsh language and of Welsh nationalism and believed in self-government for Wales within a federal system of government. He was a prolific writer of newspaper articles in Welsh, three volumes of which were later published, as were two volumes of his sermons. He was a significant influence on the development of 20th-century Welsh political nationalism; a new generation became aware of his life and work through T. Gwynn Jones&#x27;s biography, first published in 1912.

A secondary school in Abergele is named Ysgol Emrys ap Iwan in his honour.

<text>The Ramanujan tau function, studied by , is the function formula_1 defined by the following identity:
:formula_2
where with , formula_3 is the Euler function, is the Dedekind eta function, and the function is a holomorphic cusp form of weight 12 and level 1, known as the discriminant modular form (some authors, notably Apostol, write formula_4 instead of formula_5). It appears in connection to an &quot;error term&quot; involved in counting the number of ways of expressing an integer as a sum of 24 squares. A formula due to Ian G. Macdonald was given in .

==Values==
The first few values of the tau function are given in the following table :

Calculating this function on an odd square number (i.e. a centered octagonal number) yields an odd number, whereas for any other number the function yields an even number.

==Ramanujan&#x27;s conjectures==
 observed, but did not prove, the following three properties of :

* if (meaning that is a multiplicative function)
* for prime and .
* for all primes .

The first two properties were proved by and the third one, called the Ramanujan conjecture, was proved by Deligne in 1974 as a consequence of his proof of the Weil conjectures (specifically, he deduced it by applying them to a Kuga-Sato variety).

==Congruences for the tau function==
For and , the Divisor function is the sum of the th powers of the divisors of . The tau function satisfies several congruence relations; many of them can be expressed in terms of . Here are some:

#formula_9
#formula_10
#formula_11
#formula_12
#formula_13

==Conjectures on &quot;τ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)==
Suppose that is a weight- integer newform and the Fourier coefficients are integers. Consider the problem: 
: Given that does not have complex multiplication, do almost all primes have the property that ?
Indeed, most primes should have this property, and hence they are called &quot;ordinary&quot;. Despite the big advances by Deligne and Serre on Galois representations, which determine for coprime to , it is unclear how to compute . The only theorem in this regard is Elkies&#x27; famous result for modular elliptic curves, which guarantees that there are infinitely many primes such that , which thus are congruent to 0 modulo . There are no known examples of non-CM with weight greater than 2 for which for infinitely many primes (although it should be true for almost all ). There are also no known examples with for infinitely many . Some researchers had begun to doubt whether for infinitely many . As evidence, many provided Ramanujan&#x27;s (case of weight 12). The only solutions up to 1010 to the equation are 2, 3, 5, 7, 2411, and .

<text>Richard Vincent Van Patten (December 9, 1928 – June 23, 2015) was an American actor, comedian, businessman, and animal welfare advocate, whose career spanned seven decades of television. He was best known for his role as patriarch Tom Bradford on the television series &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;.

Van Patten began work as a child actor and was successful on the New York stage, appearing in more than a dozen plays as a teenager. He worked in radio, on &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;. He later starred in numerous television roles including the long-running CBS television series &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;Young Doctor Malone&quot;. Later, he would star or co-star in many feature films, including &quot;Charly&quot;, Mel Brooks&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; and &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, and &quot;Soylent Green&quot;. Van Patten was the founder of Natural Balance Pet Foods and National Guide Dog Month.

==Early life==
Richard Vincent Van Patten was born on December 9, 1928, in the Kew Gardens section of the New York City borough of Queens, the elder child of Richard Byron Van Patten, an interior decorator, and Josephine Rose (née Acerno), who worked in advertising. His younger sister was actress Joyce Van Patten.

His mother was of Italian descent, while his father had Dutch ancestry. He began work as a model and actor as a child making his Broadway debut at the age of 7. He was successful on the New York City stage, appearing in a dozen theatrical plays before reaching his teen years. He later moved to Hollywood and began a lengthy career in film and television.

==Career==
===Actor===
Van Patten&#x27;s career in show business began as a child actor on Broadway in 1935 in &quot;Tapestry In Gray&quot; starring Melvyn Douglas. He was billed as Dickie Van Patten and went on to appear in 12 other Broadway plays as a teenager, including &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;. He moved to television with the role of Nels Hansen in the series &quot;Mama&quot;, starring Peggy Wood, about a Norwegian-American family living in San Francisco in the early 20th century. It ran from 1949 to 1957. In 1949, James Dean, then an unknown, replaced Patten on the show for a time when Patten was drafted into the Army. In 1975, he played &quot;Friar Tuck&quot; on &quot;When Things Were Rotten&quot;, a comic take on Robin Hood, created by Mel Brooks. The series ran for 13 episodes. He was best known as the Bradford family patriarch, Tom Bradford, on &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, which aired from 1977 to 1981, and which was based on a book of the same name by the American journalist Thomas Braden.

Van Patten appeared in episodes of &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;Banacek&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, &quot;The Brian Keith Show&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, and &quot;Happy Days&quot;. He had numerous leading roles in motion pictures including &quot;Joe Kidd&quot;, The &quot;Snowball Express&quot; and &quot;The Santa Trap&quot;. He played a small role in the dystopian film &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973).

Van Patten appeared in several films directed by Mel Brooks, including &quot;High Anxiety&quot;, &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, and &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; as well as cameos in the music videos for &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; and &quot;Bedrock Anthem&quot; by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, and on &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;. He played &quot;Jack Benson&quot; in &quot;Opposite Day&quot; (2009). He also was a commentator for the World Series of Poker from 1993 to 1995.

The Hollywood Walk of Fame honored Van Patten on November 20, 1985, with a Star of Television marker at 1541 North Vine Street. On January 12, 2008, Van Patten received a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars.

On November 1, 2009, Phoenix Books published &quot;Eighty Is Not Enough!&quot;, a book co-authored by Van Patten and Robert Baer, in which Van Patten shared his 80-year journey of insights and anecdotes through the entertainment industry. He discusses his journey from his humble beginning in Queens, New York; his rise as a childhood star on Broadway during the Great Depression; working as an actor on the radio; the advent of television and his role in the second-ever live situation comedy &quot;Mama&quot;; a rough period between acting gigs including spending time as a real estate agent in Queens, New York; a rise back to the top that led the TV icon to the lead role on the popular hit show &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;; and subsequent roles in television and movies.

===Other work===

An animal enthusiast, Van Patten co-founded Dick Van Patten&#x27;s Natural Balance Pet Foods in 1989. Van Patten&#x27;s creation of his own brand of dog food was satirized in comedian John Hodgman&#x27;s 2008 book &quot;More Information Than You Require&quot;, and was rebranded as Dick Van Patten&#x27;s Hobo Chili for Dogs. Van Patten also appeared as a television spokesman for Fisher-Price toys in the late 1980s.

==Personal life==
===Family===

Van Patten was the older brother of actress Joyce Van Patten, and the older half-brother of film director and Emmy award-winning television director/producer Tim Van Patten. He was married to Patricia Helon Poole (also known as Pat Poole and Pat Van Patten; born March 12, 1931) from 1954 until his death. Pat Poole was a professional dancer on Broadway and a June Taylor dancer on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;. They lived in Sherman Oaks, California. They had three sons, all actors: Vincent, Nels, and Jimmy. Nels, who is married to actress Nancy Valen, is named for the character Van Patten played on the CBS&#x27;s &quot;Mama&quot;. Van Patten was related to several other actors through marriages. His sister Joyce married actor Martin Balsam; their daughter is actress Talia Balsam. Talia&#x27;s first husband was actor George Clooney, and she is now married to actor John Slattery. Van Patten&#x27;s son Vince is married to actress Eileen Davidson.

===Illness and death===

In January 2006, Van Patten was taken to Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles following a diabetic stroke. Van Patten, who had Type 2 diabetes, made a full recovery. Van Patten died at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California on June 23, 2015, at age 86. Complications from diabetes were the listed cause.

Willie Aames, who played son Tommy Bradford on &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, called his television father &quot;truly a gem [who] will be missed...As Dick always said &#x27;Remember our times together, gang...Cause these ARE the good ole&#x27; days&quot;. Betty Buckley, Van Patten&#x27;s co-star on the series, said &quot;Every day on the set he was a happy, jovial person, always generous and ready to play, tease, and always keep us all laughing. He was the consummate professional, a wonderful actor, master of comedy, and a kind and generous human being.&quot;

He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.

===Honors===
On November 20, 1985, Dick Van Patten was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2008, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

<text>Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 539 (1842), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 precluded a Pennsylvania state law that prohibited Blacks from being taken out of the free state of Pennsylvania into slavery. The Court overturned the conviction of slavecatcher Edward Prigg as a result.

Occurring under the presidency of John Tyler, &quot;Prigg v. Pennsylvania&quot; weakened the enforcement mechanisms of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 by allowing states to forbid their officials from cooperating in the return of fugitive slaves. But, by asserting federal government authority and responsibility over the area of fugitive slave return, it set the stage for future more stringent laws that would bypass individual state decisions about slavery. (Northern states by this time had abolished slavery, and most prohibited slaveowners from bringing slaves to their states, saying they would be considered free if brought in state.) Later, the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 (part of the Compromise of 1850) required even free states to support capture and return of fugitive slaves with their law enforcement, increasing penalties for non-compliance.

Also, by refusing to take judicial notice of the problem of free blacks being kidnapped in free states and sold into slavery, the &quot;Prigg&quot; decision established an implicit precedent that blacks were entitled to fewer procedural protections than were whites.

==Federal law==
In March 1789, the Constitution of the United States came into force, having been ratified by nine states. Article IV, Section 2 contained two clauses (the Extradition Clause and the Fugitive Slave Clause) related to the legality of fleeing justice, creditors, owners, or other agencies across state borders and to escaped slaves, but it did not mention &quot;slavery&quot; directly:
* &quot;A person charged in any state with treason, felony or other crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall, on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.&quot;
* &quot;No person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.&quot; (This clause was superseded by the Thirteenth Amendment, ratified on December 6, 1865.)

On February 12, 1793, the Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793, the long title of which was
&quot;An Act respecting fugitives from justice, and persons escaping from the service of their masters.&quot;

==State law==
On March 29, 1788, the State of Pennsylvania passed an amendment to one of its laws (An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery, originally enacted March 1, 1780): &quot;No negro or mulatto slave... shall be removed out of this state, with the design and intention that the place of abode or residence of such slave or servant shall be thereby altered or changed.&quot;

On March 26, 1826, the State of Pennsylvania passed a further law:
If any person or persons shall, from and after the passing of this act, by force and violence, take and carry away, or cause to be taken or carried away, and shall, by fraud or false pretense, seduce, or cause to be seduced, or shall attempt so to take, carry away or seduce, any negro or mulatto, from any part or parts of this commonwealth, to any other place or places whatsoever, out of this commonwealth, with a design and intention of selling and disposing of, or of causing to be sold, or of keeping and detaining, or of causing to be kept and detained, such negro or mulatto, as a slave or servant for life, or for any term whatsoever, every such person or persons, his or their aiders or abettors, shall on conviction thereof, in any court of this commonwealth having competent jurisdiction, be deemed guilty of a felony.

==Background==
In 1832, a black woman named Margaret Morgan moved to Pennsylvania from Maryland. There she had been born into slavery and held by John Ashmore. In Maryland, she had lived in virtual freedom but Ashmore had never formally manumitted her. After his death, Ashmore&#x27;s heirs eventually decided to claim her as a slave and hired slavecatcher Edward Prigg to recover her.

On April 1, 1837, Prigg led an assault and abduction on Morgan in York County, Pennsylvania. They took Morgan to Maryland, intending to sell her as a slave (her children, one of whom was born free in Pennsylvania, were also captured and sold). The four men involved in the abduction were arraigned under the 1826 act. Prigg pleaded not guilty and argued that he had been duly appointed by Ashmore heirs to arrest and return Morgan to their estate in Maryland. In a ruling on May 22, 1839, the Court of Quarter Sessions of York County convicted him of violation of the state law.

Prigg appealed to the US Supreme Court on the grounds that the Pennsylvania law was not able to supersede federal law or the US Constitution; the Fugitive Slave Act and Article IV of the Constitution were in conflict with the Pennsylvania law of 1788. The case was &quot;Prigg v. Pennsylvania&quot;, 41 U. S. 539 (1842).
Prigg and his lawyer argued that the 1788 and 1826 Pennsylvania laws were unconstitutional:
* First, because of the injunction in Article IV of the US Constitution: &quot;No person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.&quot;
* Second, because the exercise of Federal legislation, such as that undertaken by Congress in passing the act of the February 12, 1793, supersedes any state law.

As a consequence, they argued, the 1788 Pennsylvania law, in all its provisions applicable to this case, should be voided. The question was whether Pennsylvania law violated the constitutional guarantee of fugitive slave return and the 1793 Act of Congress, passed to implement it.

==Decision==
Writing for the Court, Justice Joseph Story reversed the conviction and held the Pennsylvania law was unconstitutional, as it denied both the right of slaveholders to recover their slaves under Article IV and the Federal Fugitive Slave Law of 1793, which trumped the state law per the Supremacy Clause. Six justices wrote separate opinions.

Although Story ruled the Pennsylvania laws were unconstitutional, his opinion left the door open for the state to forbid state officials to cooperate in the return of fugitive slaves:

As to the authority so conferred upon state magistrates [to deal with runaway slaves], while a difference of opinion has existed, and may exist still on the point, in different states, whether state magistrates are bound to act under it; none is entertained by this Court that state magistrates may, if they choose, exercise that authority, unless prohibited by state legislation.

However, state laws could not interfere with a slave-owner&#x27;s right to go to another state and recapture a fugitive slave by private action, as long as no breach of the peace was committed.

Five of the seven Supreme Court justices (including Story) referred to the commonly held view at the time that the Southern states in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 would not have agreed to the U.S. Constitution if the Fugitive Slave Clause had not been included. Since then historians such as Don E. Fehrenbacher have argued that there is little historical evidence for this.

==Dissent==

Justice John McLean was the sole dissenter in the case. He pointed out that the 1793 fugitive slave act required anyone seizing an accused fugitive slave in a different state to take them before a federal judge or local magistrate to receive certification that the seizure was legal. Prigg had not done this before removing Morgan and her children from Pennsylvania. Therefore, he saw no conflict between Pennsylvania&#x27;s laws criminalizing the forcible removal of blacks from the state and the 1793 law, which required bringing an accused fugitive slave to a judge or magistrate before removing them from the state. In McLean&#x27;s view, Congress possessed the authority for enforcing the constitutional fugitive slave provision, and they had used this authority to allow for the return of fugitive slaves from free states only with the approval of a judge or magistrate. By failing to use this method, Prigg had exceeded any authority he could possibly claim for recovering fugitive slaves, and Pennsylvania&#x27;s laws were consistent with the constitution and the 1793 law in holding him accountable.

McLean felt Pennsylvania&#x27;s laws against forced removal were particularly important for preventing free blacks from being wrongfully enslaved, as without them, slave catchers could easily kidnap free blacks and remove them from a state&#x27;s jurisdiction before said state could investigate or arrest them.

==Effects==
Story&#x27;s phrase &quot;unless prohibited by state legislation&quot; was a catalyst for a number of personal liberty laws enacted by Pennsylvania and other Northern states. The laws prohibited state officials from interfering with runaway or fugitive slaves in any capacity. Runaways could not be caught or incarcerated by state action, cases could not be heard in state courts, and no assistance could be offered by state officials to those wishing to recapture slaves. The Fugitive Slave Act still stood, but its enforcement was left to the federal government in these cases.

Such an emphatic refusal to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act was viewed in the Southern states as a brazen violation of the federal compact. A constituent complained by letter to South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun that the new personal liberty laws &quot;rendered slave property utterly insecure&quot; and constituted a &quot;flagrant violation of the spirit of the U.S. Constitution&quot;.

Increasing sectional tension over slavery resulted in the Compromise of 1850, which covered several issues related to the status of territories acquired in the Mexican–American War. The South allowed California to enter the Union as a free state, but the Northern states would have to agree to a strengthened Fugitive Slave Act, which required law enforcement in free states to cooperate in the capture and return of fugitive slaves within their borders.

The South had been forced to look to the federal government for a national solution. The Supreme Court had pledged itself in advance to support such a solution although aware that many persons in the North would certainly be mobilized against it. In addition, people began to believe that the Court was uniquely qualified to soothe the growing agitation over slavery.

However, the Liberty Party platform of 1843 (which was adopted in advance of the 1844 presidential election) condemned the &quot;Prigg v. Pennsylvania&quot; decision and said that the ruling nullified &quot;habeas corpus&quot; protection for free blacks and took away their &quot;whole legal security of personal freedom.&quot;

<doc id="1231733" wikidata="Q408723" url="?curid=1231733" title="Airglow">
<text>Airglow (also called nightglow) is a faint emission of light by a planetary atmosphere. In the case of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, this optical phenomenon causes the night sky never to be completely dark, even after the effects of starlight and diffused sunlight from the far side are removed. This phenomenon originates with self-illuminated gases and has no relationship with Earth&#x27;s magnetism or sunspot activity.

== History ==
The airglow phenomenon was first identified in 1868 by Swedish physicist Anders Ångström. Since then, it has been studied in the laboratory, and various chemical reactions have been observed to emit electromagnetic energy as part of the process. Scientists have identified some of those processes that would be present in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and astronomers have verified that such emissions are present. Simon Newcomb was the first person to scientifically study and describe airglow, in 1901.

Airglow existed in pre-industrial society and was known to the ancient Greeks. &quot;Aristotle and Pliny described the phenomena of &quot;Chasmata&quot;, which can be identified in part as auroras, and in part as bright airglow nights.&quot;

== Description ==

Airglow is caused by various processes in the upper atmosphere of Earth, such as the recombination of atoms which were photoionized by the Sun during the day, luminescence caused by cosmic rays striking the upper atmosphere, and chemiluminescence caused mainly by oxygen and nitrogen reacting with hydroxyl free radicals at heights of a few hundred kilometres. It is not noticeable during the daytime due to the glare and scattering of sunlight.

Even at the best ground-based observatories, airglow limits the photosensitivity of optical telescopes. Partly for this reason, space telescopes like Hubble can observe much fainter objects than current ground-based telescopes at visible wavelengths.

Airglow at night may be bright enough for a ground observer to notice and appears generally bluish. Although airglow emission is fairly uniform across the atmosphere, it appears brightest at about 10° above the observer&#x27;s horizon, since the lower one looks, the greater the mass of atmosphere one is looking through. Very low down, however, atmospheric extinction reduces the apparent brightness of the airglow.

One airglow mechanism is when an atom of nitrogen combines with an atom of oxygen to form a molecule of nitric oxide (NO). In the process, a photon is emitted. This photon may have any of several different wavelengths characteristic of nitric oxide molecules. The free atoms are available for this process, because molecules of nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) are dissociated by solar energy in the upper reaches of the atmosphere and may encounter each other to form NO. Other chemicals that can create air glow in the atmosphere are hydroxyl (OH), atomic oxygen (O), sodium (Na), and lithium (Li).

The sky brightness is typically measured in units of apparent magnitude per square arcsecond of sky.

== Calculation ==
In order to calculate the relative intensity of airglow, we need to convert apparent magnitudes into fluxes of photons; this clearly depends on the spectrum of the source, but we will ignore that initially. At visible wavelengths, we need the parameter &quot;S&quot;0(&quot;V&quot;), the power per square centimetre of aperture and per micrometre of wavelength produced by a zeroth-magnitude star, to convert apparent magnitudes into fluxes – . If we take the example of a star observed through a normal &quot;V&quot; band filter ( bandpass, frequency ), the number of photons we receive per square centimeter of telescope aperture per second from the source is &quot;N&quot;s:
: formula_1
(where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant; &quot;hν&quot; is the energy of a single photon of frequency &quot;ν&quot;).

At &quot;V&quot; band, the emission from airglow is per square arc-second at a high-altitude observatory on a moonless night; in excellent seeing conditions, the image of a star will be about 0.7 arc-second across with an area of 0.4 square arc-second, and so the emission from airglow over the area of the image corresponds to about . This gives the number of photons from airglow, &quot;N&quot;a:
: formula_2

The signal-to-noise for an ideal ground-based observation with a telescope of area &quot;A&quot; (ignoring losses and detector noise), arising from Poisson statistics, is only:
: formula_3

If we assume a 10 m diameter ideal ground-based telescope and an unresolved star: every second, over a patch the size of the seeing-enlarged image of the star, 35 photons arrive from the star and 3500 from air-glow. So, over an hour, roughly arrive from the air-glow, and approximately arrive from the source; so the &quot;S&quot;/&quot;N&quot; ratio is about:
: formula_4

We can compare this with &quot;real&quot; answers from exposure time calculators. For an 8 m unit Very Large Telescope telescope, according to the FORS exposure time calculator, 40 hours of observing time are needed to reach , while the 2.4 m Hubble only takes 4 hours according to the ACS exposure time calculator. A hypothetical 8 m Hubble telescope would take about 30 minutes.

This calculation shows that reducing the view field size can make fainter objects more detectable against the airglow; unfortunately, adaptive optics techniques that reduce the diameter of the view field of an Earth-based telescope by an order of magnitude only as yet work in the infrared, where the sky is much brighter. A space telescope is not restricted by the view field, since it is not affected by airglow.

== Induced airglow ==
Scientific experiments have been conducted to induce airglow by directing high-power radio emissions at the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere. These radiowaves interact with the ionosphere to induce faint but visible optical light at specific wavelengths under certain conditions. The effect is also observable in the radio frequency band, using ionosondes.

== Experimental observation ==
SwissCube-1 is a Swiss satellite operated by Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. The spacecraft is a single unit CubeSat, which was designed to conduct research into airglow within the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and to develop technology for future spacecraft. Though SwissCube-1 is rather small (10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm) and weighs less than 1 kg, it carries a small telescope for obtaining images of the airglow. The first SwissCube-1 image came down on 18 February 2011 and was quite black with some thermal noise on it. The first airglow image came down on 3 March 2011. This image has been converted to the human optical range (green) from its near-infrared measurement. This image provides a measurement of the intensity of the airglow phenomenon in the near-infrared. The range measured is from 500 to 61400 photons, with a resolution of 500 photons.

== Observation of airglow on other planets ==
The &quot;Venus Express&quot; spacecraft contains an infrared sensor which has detected near-IR emissions from the upper atmosphere of Venus. The emissions come from nitric oxide (NO) and from molecular oxygen. Scientists had previously determined in laboratory testing that during NO production, ultraviolet emissions and near-IR emissions were produced. The UV radiation had been detected in the atmosphere, but until this mission, the atmosphere-produced near-IR emissions were only theoretical.

<text>The Trnava Region (, ; ; ) is one of the eight Slovak administrative regions. It was established in 1996, before which date, most of its districts were parts of Bratislava Region which was established on the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1923. It consists of 251 municipalities, from which 16 have a town status. It is the second most densely populated region in Slovakia.

==Geography==
In the lower, west part of Slovakia, the Trnava region forms a territorial band between the Bratislava Region and the rest of Slovakia, between Austrian and Czech borders in the north and north-west and the Hungarian border in the south. The part north of the Little Carpathians is part of the Záhorie Lowland, with its two subdivisions: hilly Chvojnická pahorkatina and flat Borská nížina. In addition to these, the Myjava Hills and the White Carpathians reach into the area. The fertile Danubian Lowland is located south of the Little Carpathians, again with two subdivisions: the Danubian Flat in the south, containing river island of Žitný ostrov (Rye Island) and the Danubian Hills in the north, where it also borders the Považský Inovec range app. on the line Hlohovec - Piešťany - border with the Trenčín Region. Major rivers are the Danube on the Hungarian border, with part of the Gabčíkovo Dam, Little Danube, which creates with Danube the island of Žitný ostrov, Váh in the east, Dudváh in the centre, and Morava River in the north-west, along the Austrian and Czech borders. The region borders: Austrian Lower Austria and Czech South Moravian Region in the north-west, Trenčín Region in the north, Nitra Region in the east, Hungarian Győr-Moson-Sopron county in the south and Bratislava Region in the west.

==Demographics==
In terms of population, the region is smallest of all Slovak regions. However, the population density is (2020-06-30/-07-01), that is more than Slovak average (110 per km2). Largest towns are Trnava, Piešťany, Hlohovec, Dunajská Streda and Sereď. The level of urbanization is around 49%, represented by inhabitants living in 16 towns. According to the 2001 census, the region had 551,003 inhabitants, with Slovaks forming a majority (73.9%), but there is a significant Hungarian minority in the south (23.7%), forming a majority in the Dunajská Streda District (87%) and are notably represented in the Galanta District (41%). Other minorities are the Czechs and Roma (&lt;1%).

== Economy ==
The region is quite productive in both industry and agriculture. The proximity to the capital city of Bratislava is an asset, as many Trnava residents travel daily to work there. Lately, multinational manufacturing companies such as Peugeot or Samsung, Schäffler, ZF Slovakia, Vaillant Industrial and Bekaert settled in the region.

==Politics==
The current governor of the Trnava region is Jozef Viskupič (OĽaNO). He won with 42,9 % of the vote. In the 2017 elections to the regional parliament the results were as follows:

==Administrative division==

<doc id="1231745" wikidata="Q6689272" url="?curid=1231745" title="Louisiana School for the Deaf">
<text>The Louisiana School for the Deaf is a state school for deaf and hard-of-hearing students in Louisiana, located in Baton Rouge, the state capital. It was established in 1852 as a joint school for blind students. In 1860, its first purpose-built facility was completed and admired as an elegant monument to philanthropy. The schools were divided in 1898, and in 1908, Louisiana School for the Deaf was renamed.

Construction of facilities has continued over the years. In 1978, black students were absorbed when their school was merged into this one. The expanded school now has 22 major buildings, including a football stadium, on a 116-acre campus south of Louisiana State University on Brightside Lane. In 2009, the Louisiana School for the Visually Impaired (LSVI) was relocated here.

==Admission/Enrollment==
Louisiana School for the Deaf offers a comprehensive pre-K–12 education for Louisiana&#x27;s deaf and hard-of-hearing children ages 3–18 at no cost to their families.

Enrolling at the Louisiana School for the Deaf is possible by:
* Parental application: At each IEP conference, parents have the right to review the choices of educational placements available to their child. Louisiana law (Act 433) empowers parents to choose between the program offered by their local school system and the program offered by LSD. Parents can apply directly to LSD at any time during the school year.
* State Department of Education (SDE) referral: The local school system can refer a deaf/hard-of-hearing student to LSD through the SDE.
* The local school system can refer a deaf/hard-of-hearing student to LSD for an evaluation by the LSD Statewide Assessment Center for the Hearing Impaired (SWAC-HI) to determine levels of performance and program needs. The student attends LSD during the evaluation process.

==History==
Before 1838, wealthy families provided private tutors for their deaf children (as for their hearing children) or paid for the children to attend a school for the deaf outside Louisiana. There was no public education in the state. The 1838 Louisiana legislature passed an act on January 16, 1838, to provide state-supported education of deaf white children by enrolling them at other state schools. As a result, 11 children from Louisiana were enrolled at state cost at the Kentucky School for the Deaf.

In 1852, Francis Dubose Richardson, a member of the General Assembly, introduced a bill to provide $25,000 and empowered a Board of Administrators to oversee the establishment of the Louisiana Institute for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind. The bill was passed in March 1852 and approved by the governor. The seven board members were authorized to buy land, make contracts, and do whatever was necessary to begin the school.
The first school was held in the former Baton Rouge College (now the Mayflower North campus). The board recruited James Smedley Brown from the Indiana Asylum of the Deaf and Dumb as superintendent. On December 8, 1852, the 11 Louisiana students and Brown arrived in Baton Rouge.
Notable achievements during 1852–1860 were completion of the state Administration Building on the campus, just south of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. The building was acclaimed as one of the most elaborate and elegant for that era. The new Administration Building was completed in 1858 and stood for 99 years. It was described by the &quot;Daily Gazette and Comet&quot; on July 21, 1857, as &quot;the proud monument to the Christian philanthropy of the Sugar Bowl State.&quot;

The school hired a woman teacher, and began to include vocational training as part of the program. At the request of the school, the legislature appropriated funds for the purchase of a printing press and fonts. The school taught printing as a vocational skill. A carpenter on campus was enlisted to teach carpentry skills.

In 1860, the school had 60 students. By 1862, there were 72 students. As the fighting of the American Civil War drew closer to Baton Rouge during the Mississippi campaign, parents pulled their children out and only orphans remained at the school. Early in 1862, staff and students spotted gunboats on the Mississippi. The Union army found the school an easy target. A cannonball was said to be shot through the wide first-floor hall, landing at the rear of the school. Principal Martin and matron Mary Dufrocq ran to the riverbank a half-mile away and begged the commander to stop shooting and save the school. The Union Army took over the school as a hospital to care for federal soldiers.

In January 1863, the federal troops again seized Baton Rouge and the school, using it as a temporary hospital. Schooling continued. The soldiers ruined the printing equipment. But there was an advantage to having troops on site; General Augur permitted full rations to the school. From 1863 to 1867, the children had enough food and fuel.

On October 15, 1869, a fire destroyed the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy at Pineville. After the fire, governor Warmoth asked the board and administrators and superintendent J.A. McWhorter to use half of the deaf school for the seminary.

Major John Patton, professor of Greek at Louisiana State University, was appointed superintendent. Among his first tasks was to arrange for the deaf students to be relocated to another location. They used the former Heroman Building, on Church and Florida Streets (opposite the former &quot;State-Times and Morning Advocate&quot; building), as the third location of the school.

In 1884, the school had 56 students when Dr. John Jastremski was appointed superintendent. On taking office in 1885, he appointed Edith S. Rambo, who was trained at the Clarke School for the Deaf, as the first oral teacher. The student-operated &quot;Deaf Mute Pelican&quot;, the forerunner of &quot;The Pelican&quot;, began publication in 1859. In 1892, the print shop and sewing department were enlarging. Carpentry, cabinet making, and glazing were taught. In 1892, another articulation teacher was hired, and a shoe shop installed.

The 1898 act separated the two schools for deaf and blind students and set up two boards. It established goals of both sets of children receiving a good education, instruction in hygiene and physical culture (physical education), and industrial (vocational) training, felt to be the key to the changing industrial society. Basketball was brought for the girls and the boys played football.
Superintendent S.T. Walker lobbied to change the institution&#x27;s name to reflect its mission. On July 8, 1908, a bill changing the name to the Louisiana School for the Deaf became law.

The segregated State School for the Blind and Deaf for Blacks, founded by the Reconstruction-era legislature in the late 1860s with other welfare institutions, was later put under the supervision of Southern University, a historically black college. In 1938, it was separated into two schools, as had been done for white children: the School for the Blind and the School for the Deaf. That year, superintendent Dr. J.S. Clark was succeeded by his son, Dr. Felton G. Clark, at the School for the Deaf.
In 1978, state of Louisiana merged the Southern School for the Deaf with LSD. Black students were relocated to the Mayflower Campus (North Campus). They occupied this area until 1985, and completion of more of the new buildings on what is now described as the South Campus on Brightside Lane, south of Louisiana State University.

This 116-acre Brightside campus now holds the 22 major working buildings of the school. In 2009, the Louisiana School for the Visually Impaired (LSVI) was relocated here.

==Campus==
The school has dormitories for students.

==Athletics==
LSD athletics competes in the LHSAA.

Football and Homecoming was brought back in 2010. Other sports offered include: girls&#x27; volleyball, girls&#x27; &amp; boys&#x27; basketball, girls&#x27; &amp; boys track and field, and girls&#x27; &amp; boys&#x27; powerlifting.

===Athletic facilities===
LSD has several gyms, an indoor swimming pool, and a racketball court along with tennis courts and bowling lanes.

==School mascots==
* &quot;Mustangs&quot; (1???-1978): the first school mascot.
* &quot;Wolves&quot; (1938–1978): Southern School for the Deaf mascot.
* &quot;War Eagles&quot; (1978–present): When LSD and SSD merged, school officials asked the students to vote for a new mascot.

==Superintendents/Directors==

Note: * died in office, # reappointed, ^ longest years in service, @ acting, % superintendent title has been dropped and renamed director to the title as of 2006, **&#x27; retired as of October 10, 2008, &amp; interim director

<doc id="1231747" wikidata="Q2170401" url="?curid=1231747" title="Monterrey platyfish">
<text>The Monterrey platyfish (Xiphophorus couchianus) is a species of freshwater fish in family Poecilidae. A live-bearer, it was native to a very small section of the San Juan River system (itself part of the Rio Grande basin) in the vicinity of the city of Monterrey, Mexico. The specific name refers to the American soldier and naturalist Darius N. Couch (1822–1897) who collected the type on a self financed expedition to Mexico.

==Appearance==
The Monterrey platyfish is a dull-colored fish, appearing not unlike a female guppy. Another form, sometimes referred to as &quot;X. aff. couchianus&quot;, was discovered in Apodaca, central Monterrey, in 1983. It has large black blotching, unlike the typical, unspotted form from the Huasteca Canyon. Whether the Apodaca form represents a separate species is presently unclear.

Sexual dimorphism is moderate, the male Monterrey platyfish growing to a maximum overall length of and the female .

==Conservation==
IUCN lists the Monterrey platyfish as &quot;extinct in the wild&quot;. Although once found more widely in the region of Monterrey, populations have been lost to urban sprawl, with water habitats either drying up (due to land reclamation and water extraction) or being heavily polluted. Introduced species is another threat. &quot;Safety populations&quot; are maintained in captivity by the Centro de Resguardo para Peces en Peligro de Extinción at Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, Mexico (maintaining both the typical form and &quot;X. aff. couchianus&quot;), &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; Genetic Stock Center at Texas State University, United States (maintaining typical form), via the American Livebearer Association that mostly includes private aquarists in the United States (maintaining typical form), and by XNP conservation project members, which include public aquariums, universities and private aquarists in several European countries and the United States (maintaining typical form). The species has proven harder to maintain in captivity than most &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; species.

The Monterrey platyfish shares the title as northernmost naturally distributed &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; with the closely related northern platyfish (&quot;X. gordoni&quot;) and marbled swordtail (&quot;X. meyeri&quot;), which are two species that also are restricted to northeastern Mexico and seriously threatened.

<doc id="1231776" wikidata="Q10284378" url="?curid=1231776" title="Photoionization">
<text>Photoionization is the physical process in which an ion is formed from the interaction of a photon with an atom or molecule.

==Cross section==
Not every interaction between a photon and an atom, or molecule, will result in photoionization. The probability of photoionization is related to the photoionization cross section of the species – the probability of an ionization event conceptualized as a hypothetical cross-sectional area. This cross section depends on the energy of the photon (proportional to its wavenumber) and the species being considered i.e. it depends on the structure of the molecular species. In the case of molecules, the photoionization cross-section can be estimated by examination of Franck-Condon factors between a ground-state molecule and the target ion. This can be initialized by computing the vibrations of a molecule and associated cation (post ionization) using quantum chemical software e.g. QChem. For photon energies below the ionization threshold, the photoionization cross-section is near zero. But with the development of pulsed lasers it has become possible to create extremely intense, coherent light where multi-photon ionization may occur via sequences of excitations and relaxations. At even higher intensities (around of infrared or visible light), non-perturbative phenomena such as &quot;barrier suppression ionization&quot; and &quot;rescattering ionization&quot; are observed.

==Multi-photon ionization==
Several photons of energy below the ionization threshold may actually combine their energies to ionize an atom. This probability decreases rapidly with the number of photons required, but the development of very intense, pulsed lasers still makes it possible. In the perturbative regime (below about 1014 W/cm2 at optical frequencies), the probability of absorbing &quot;N&quot; photons depends on the laser-light intensity &quot;I&quot; as &quot;I&quot;&quot;N&quot; . For higher intensities, this dependence becomes invalid due to the then occurring AC Stark effect.

Resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) is a technique applied to the spectroscopy of atoms and small molecules in which a tunable laser can be used to access an excited intermediate state.

Above-threshold ionization (ATI) is an extension of multi-photon ionization where even more photons are absorbed than actually would be necessary to ionize the atom. The excess energy gives the released electron higher kinetic energy than the usual case of just-above threshold ionization. More precisely, the system will have multiple peaks in its photoelectron spectrum which are separated by the photon energies, indicating that the emitted electron has more kinetic energy than in the normal (lowest possible number of photons) ionization case. The electrons released from the target will have approximately an integer number of photon-energies more kinetic energy.

==Tunnel ionization==
When either the laser intensity is further increased or a longer wavelength is applied as compared with the regime in which multi-photon ionization takes place, a quasi-stationary approach can be used and results in the distortion of the atomic potential in such a way that only a relatively low and narrow barrier between a bound state and the continuum states remains. Then, the electron can tunnel through or for larger distortions even overcome this barrier. These phenomena are called tunnel ionization and over-the-barrier ionization, respectively.

<text>Michael Daniel Jones (2 March 1822 – 2 December 1898) was a Welsh Congregationalist minister and principal of a theological college, but is best remembered as a founder of the Welsh settlement in Patagonia known as Y Wladfa and as one of the fathers of modern Welsh nationalism.

Jones was born in Llanuwchllyn, Merioneth (Gwynedd) in 1822. After training for the ministry at the Presbyterian College in Carmarthen and afterwards at Highbury College, London, he spent about eighteen months in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he was ordained to the Christian ministry. He returned to Wales and in 1850 he was inducted minister at Bwlchnewydd and Gibeon in Carmarthenshire, before succeeding his father as the principal of Bala Independent College in 1855.
His name is closely linked with the attempt to establish a Welsh settlement in Patagonia, Argentina, in the 1860s where Welsh would be the language of religion, government, trade, and education. The 150th anniversary (28 July 1865) of this Welsh-Argentine settlement in Rawson, Chubut Argentina was celebrated in 2015.

In 1889, Jones became a member of the first Merionethshire County Council, although he had a majority of only eight votes over his Conservative opponent.

Jones is recognised as the first to advocate a political solution to defending Welsh identity and therefore is seen as one of the most significant forerunners of Welsh nationalism.

<doc id="1231792" wikidata="Q847702" url="?curid=1231792" title="Hornfels">
<text>Hornfels is the group name for a set of contact metamorphic rocks that have been baked and hardened by the heat of intrusive igneous masses and have been rendered massive, hard, splintery, and in some cases exceedingly tough and durable. These properties are caused by fine grained non-aligned crystals with platy or prismatic habits, characteristic of metamorphism at high temperature but without accompanying deformation. The term is derived from the German word &quot;Hornfels&quot;, meaning &quot;hornstone&quot;, because of its exceptional toughness and texture both reminiscent of animal horns. These rocks were referred to by miners in northern England as whetstones.

Most hornfels are fine-grained, and while the original rocks (such as sandstone, shale, slate and limestone) may have been more or less fissile owing to the presence of bedding or cleavage planes, this structure is effaced or rendered inoperative in the hornfels. Though many hornfels show vestiges of the original bedding, they break across this as readily as along it; in fact, they tend to separate into cubical fragments rather than into thin plates. Sheet minerals may be abundant but are aligned at random.

Hornfels most commonly form in the aureole of granitic intrusions in the upper or middle crust. Hornfels formed from contact metamorphism by volcanic activity very close to the surface can produce unusual and distinctive minerals. Changes in composition caused by fluids given off by the magmatic body (metasomatism) sometimes take place. The &quot;hornfels facies&quot; is the metamorphic facies which occupies the lowest pressure portion of the metamorphic pressure-temperature space.

The most common hornfels (the biotite hornfels) are dark-brown to black with a somewhat velvety luster owing to the abundance of small crystals of shining black mica. Also, most common hornfels have a black streak. The lime hornfels are often white, yellow, pale-green, brown and other colors. Green and dark-green are the prevalent tints of the hornfels produced by the alteration of igneous rocks. Although for the most part the constituent grains are too small to be determined by the unaided eye, there are often larger crystals (porphyroblasts) of cordierite, garnet or andalusite scattered through the fine matrix, and these may become very prominent on the weathered faces of the rock.

==Structure==
The structure of the hornfels is very characteristic. Very rarely do any of the minerals show crystalline form, but the small grains fit closely together like the fragments of a mosaic; they are usually of nearly equal dimensions. This has been called pflaster or pavement structure from the resemblance to rough pavement work. Each mineral may also enclose particles of the others; in quartz, for example, small crystals of graphite, biotite, iron oxides, sillimanite or feldspar may appear in great numbers. Often the whole of the grains are rendered semi-opaque in this way. The minutest crystals may show traces of crystalline outlines; undoubtedly they are of new formation and have originated &quot;in situ&quot;. This leads us to believe that the whole rock has been recrystallized at a high temperature and in the solid state so that there was little freedom for the mineral molecules to build up well-individualized crystals. The regeneration of the rock has been sufficient to efface most of the original structures and to replace the former minerals more-or-less completely by new ones. But crystallization has been hampered by the solid condition of the mass and the new minerals are formless and have been unable to reject impurities, but have grown around them.

==Compositions==
=== Pelitic ===
Clays, sedimentary slates and shales yield biotite hornfels in which the most conspicuous mineral is biotite mica, the small scales of which are transparent under the microscope and have a dark reddish-brown color and strong dichroism. There is also quartz, and often a considerable amount of feldspar, while graphite, tourmaline and iron oxides frequently occur in lesser quantity. In these biotite hornfels the minerals, which consist of aluminium silicates, are commonly found; they are usually andalusite and sillimanite, but kyanite appears also in hornfels, especially in those that have a schistose character. The andalusite may be pink and is then often pleochroic in thin sections, or it may be white with the cross-shaped dark enclosures of the matrix that are characteristic of chiastolite. Sillimanite usually forms exceedingly minute needles embedded in quartz.

In the rocks of this group cordierite also occurs, not rarely, and may have the outlines of imperfect hexagonal prisms that are divided up into six sectors when seen in polarized light. In biotite hornfels, a faint striping may indicate the original bedding of the unaltered rock and corresponds to small changes in the nature of the sediment deposited. More commonly there is a distinct spotting, visible on the surfaces of the hand specimens. The spots are round or elliptical, and may be paler or darker than the rest of the rock. In some cases they are rich in graphite or carbonaceous matter; in others they are full of brown mica; some spots consist of rather coarser grains of quartz than occur in the matrix. The frequency with which this feature reappears in the less altered slates and hornfels is rather remarkable, especially as it seems certain that the spots are not always of the same nature or origin. Tourmaline hornfels are found sometimes near the margins of tourmaline granites; they are black with small needles of schorl that under the microscope are dark brown and richly pleochroic. As the tourmaline contains boron, there must have been some permeation of vapors from the granite into the sediments. Rocks of this group are often seen in the Cornish tin-mining districts, especially near the lodes.

=== Carbonate ===
A second great group of hornfels are the calc–silicate hornfels that arise from the thermal alteration of impure limestone. The purer beds recrystallize as marbles, but where there has been originally an admixture of sand or clay lime-bearing silicates are formed, such as diopside, epidote, garnet, sphene, vesuvianite and scapolite; with these phlogopite, various feldspars, pyrites, quartz and actinolite often occur. These rocks are fine-grained, and though often banded, are tough and much harder than the original limestones. They are excessively variable in their mineralogical composition, and very often alternate in thin seams with biotite hornfels and indurated quartzites. When perfused with boric and fluoric vapors from the granite they may contain much axinite, fluorite and datolite, but the altiminous silicates are absent from these rocks.

=== Mafic ===
From diabases, basalts, andesites and other igneous rocks a third type of hornfels is produced. They consist essentially of feldspar with hornblende (generally of brown color) and pale pyroxene. Sphene, biotite and iron oxides are the other common constituents, but these rocks show much variety of composition and structure. Where the original mass was decomposed and contained calcite, zeolites, chlorite and other secondary minerals either in veins or in cavities, there are usually rounded areas or irregular streaks containing a suite of new minerals, which may resemble those of the calcium-silicate hornfelses above described. The original porphyritic, fluidal, vesicular or fragmental structures of the igneous rock are clearly visible in the less advanced stages of hornfelsing, but become less evident as the alteration progresses.

In some districts hornfelsed rocks occur that have acquired a schistose structure through shearing, and these form transitions to schists and gneisses that contain the same minerals as the hornfels, but have a schistose instead of a hornfels structure. Among these may be mentioned cordierite and sillimanite gneisses, andalusite and kyanite mica-schists, and those schistose calcite-silicate rocks that are known as cipolins. That these are sediments that have undergone thermal alteration is generally admitted, but the exact conditions under which they were formed are not always clear. The essential features of hornfelsing are ascribed to the action of heat, pressure and permeating vapors, regenerating a rock mass without the production of fusion (at least on a large scale). It has been argued, however, that often there is extensive chemical change owing to the introduction of matter from the granite into the rocks surrounding it. The formation of new feldspar in the hornfelses is pointed out as evidence of this. While this felspathization may have occurred in a few localities, it seems conspicuously absent from others. Most authorities at the present time regard the changes as being purely of a physical and not of a chemical nature.

==Facies==

The hornfels facies occupies the portion of the metamorphic pressure-temperature space of lowest pressure and low to high temperature. It is subdivided into a low-temperature regime of albite-epidote hornfels, a medium-temperature regime of hornblende hornfels, a high-temperature regime of pyroxene hornfels, and an ultra-high-temperature sanidinite regime. The latter is sometimes regarded as a separate facies. Maximum pressures are around 2 kbar and temperatures are around 300-500 C for the albite-epidote hornfels facies, 500-650 C for the hornblende hornfels facies, 650-800 C for the pyroxene hornfels facies, and above 800 C for the sanidinite facies.

The actual minerals present in each facies depends on the composition of the protolith. For a mafic protolith, the albite-epidote hornfels facies is characterized by albite and epidote or zoisite with minor actinolite and chlorite. This gives way to hornblende, plagioclase, pyroxene, and garnet in the hornblende hornfels facies, which in turn gives way to orthopyroxene, augite, plagioclase, and characteristic trace garnet in the pyroxene hornfels facies and sanidinite facies, the latter two being indistinguishable for this composition of protolith.

For an ultramafic protolith, the albite-epidote facies is characterized by serpentine, talc, tremolite, and chlorite, giving way to forsterite, orthopyroxene, hornblende, chlorite, and characteristic minor aluminum spinel and magnetite in the hornblende facies, which in turn gives way to forsterite, orthopyroxene, augite, plagioclase, and aluminum spinel in the pyroxene hornfels facies. The sanidinite facies for this composition differs from the pyroxene hornfels facies only in the disappearance of aluminum spinel.

For a pelitic protolith, the sequence is quartz, plagioclase, muscovite, chlorite, and cordierite in the albite-epidote facies; quartz, plagioclase, muscovite, biotite, cordierite, and andalusite in the hornblende hornfels facies; and quartz, plagioclase, orthoclase, andalusite, sillimanite, cordierite, and orthopyroxene in the pyroxene hornfels facies. The sanidinite facies features quartz, plagioclase, sillimanite, cordierite, orthopyroxene, sapphirine, and aluminum spinel.

For a calcareous protolith, the sequence is calcite, dolomite, quartz, tremolite, talc, and forsterite for the albite-epidote hornfels facies; calcite, dolomite, quartz, tremolite, diopside, and forsterite for the hornblende hornfels facies; calcite, quartz, diposide, forsterite, and wollastonite for the pyroxene hornfels facies; and calcite, quartz, diopside, forsterite, wollastonite, monticellite, and akermanite for the sanidinite facies.

==Acoustic properties==
Hornfels have the ability to resonate when struck. Michael Tellinger had described these stones in South Africa also known as &quot;ring-stones&quot; due to their ability to ring like a bell. The Musical Stones of Skiddaw are an example of a lithophone made from hornfels.

<text>In astronomy, extinction is the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by dust and gas between an emitting astronomical object and the observer. Interstellar extinction was first documented as such in 1930 by Robert Julius Trumpler. However, its effects had been noted in 1847 by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, and its effect on the colors of stars had been observed by a number of individuals who did not connect it with the general presence of galactic dust. For stars lying near the plane of the Milky Way which are within a few thousand parsecs of the Earth, extinction in the visual band of frequencies (photometric system) is roughly 1.8 magnitudes per kiloparsec.

For Earth-bound observers, extinction arises both from the interstellar medium and the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere; it may also arise from circumstellar dust around an observed object. Strong extinction in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere of some wavelength regions (such as X-ray, ultraviolet, and infrared) is overcome by the use of space-based observatories. Since blue light is much more strongly attenuated than red light, extinction causes objects to appear redder than expected; this phenomenon is called interstellar reddening.

==Interstellar reddening==

Interstellar reddening is a phenomenon associated with interstellar extinction where the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from a radiation source changes characteristics from that which the object originally emitted. Reddening occurs due to the light scattering off dust and other matter in the interstellar medium. Interstellar reddening is a different phenomenon from redshift, which is the proportional frequency shifts of spectra without distortion. Reddening preferentially removes shorter wavelength photons from a radiated spectrum while leaving behind the longer wavelength photons, leaving the spectroscopic lines unchanged.

In most photometric systems, filters (passbands) are used from which readings of magnitude of light may take account of latitude and humidity among terrestrial factors. Interstellar reddening equates to the &quot;color excess&quot;, defined as the difference between an object&#x27;s observed color index and its intrinsic color index (sometimes referred to as its normal color index). The latter is the theoretical value which it would have if unaffected by extinction. In the first system, the UBV photometric system devised in the 1950s and its most closely related successors, the object&#x27;s color excess formula_1 is related to the object&#x27;s B−V color (calibrated blue minus calibrated visible) by:

formula_2

For an A0-type main sequence star (these have median wavelength and heat among the main sequence) the color indices are calibrated at 0 based on an intrinsic reading of such a star (± exactly 0.02 depending on which spectral point, i.e. precise passband within the abbreviated color name is in question, see color index). At least two and up to five measured passbands in magnitude are then compared by subtraction: U, B, V, I, or R during which the color excess from extinction is calculated and deducted. The name of the four sub-indices (R minus I etc.) and order of the subtraction of recalibrated magnitudes is from right to immediate left within this sequence.

==General characteristics==
Interstellar reddening occurs because interstellar dust absorbs and scatters blue light waves more than red light waves, making stars appear redder than they are. This is similar to the effect seen when dust particles in the atmosphere of Earth contribute to red sunsets.

Broadly speaking, interstellar extinction is strongest at short wavelengths, generally observed by using techniques from spectroscopy. Extinction results in a change in the shape of an observed spectrum. Superimposed on this general shape are absorption features (wavelength bands where the intensity is lowered) that have a variety of origins and can give clues as to the chemical composition of the interstellar material, e.g. dust grains. Known absorption features include the 2175 Å bump, the diffuse interstellar bands, the 3.1 μm water ice feature, and the 10 and 18 μm silicate features.

In the solar neighborhood, the rate of interstellar extinction in the Johnson–Cousins V-band (visual filter) averaged at a wavelength of 540 nm is usually taken to be 0.7–1.0 mag/kpc−simply an average due to the &quot;clumpiness&quot; of interstellar dust. In general, however, this means that a star will have its brightness reduced by about a factor of 2 in the V-band viewed from a good night sky vantage point on earth for every kiloparsec (3,260 light years) it is farther away from us.

The amount of extinction can be significantly higher than this in specific directions. For example, some regions of the Galactic Center are awash with obvious intervening dark dust from our spiral arm (and perhaps others) and themselves in a bulge of dense matter, causing as much as more than 30 magnitudes of extinction in the optical, meaning that less than 1 optical photon in 1012 passes through. This results in the zone of avoidance, where our view of the extra-galactic sky is severely hampered, and background galaxies, such as Dwingeloo 1, were only discovered recently through observations in radio and infrared.

The general shape of the ultraviolet through near-infrared (0.125 to 3.5 μm) extinction curve (plotting extinction in magnitude against wavelength, often inverted) looking from our vantage point at other objects in the Milky Way, is fairly well characterized by the stand-alone parameter of relative visibility (of such visible light) R(V) (which is different along different lines of sight), but there are known deviations from this characterization. Extending the extinction law into the mid-infrared wavelength range is difficult due to the lack of suitable targets and various contributions by absorption features.

R(V) compares aggregate and particular extinctions. It is . Restated, it is the total extinction, A(V) divided by the selective total extinction (A(B)−A(V)) of those two wavelengths (bands). A(B) and A(V) are the &quot;total extinction&quot; at the B and V filter bands. Another measure used in the literature is the &quot;absolute extinction&quot; A(λ)/A(V) at wavelength λ, comparing the total extinction at that wavelength to that at the V band.

R(V) is known to be correlated with the average size of the dust grains causing the extinction. For the Milky Way Galaxy, the typical value for R(V) is 3.1, but is found to vary considerably across different lines of sight. As a result, when computing cosmic distances it can be advantageous to move to star data from the near-infrared (of which the filter or passband Ks is quite standard) where the variations and amount of extinction are significantly less, and similar ratios as to R(Ks): 0.49±0.02 and 0.528±0.015 were found respectively by independent groups. Those two more modern findings differ substantially relative to the commonly referenced historical value ≈0.7.

The relationship between the total extinction, A(V) (measured in magnitudes), and the column density of neutral hydrogen atoms column, NH (usually measured in cm−2), shows how the gas and dust in the interstellar medium are related. From studies using ultraviolet spectroscopy of reddened stars and X-ray scattering halos in the Milky Way, Predehl and Schmitt found the relationship between NH and A(V) to be approximately:

:formula_3

(see also:).

Astronomers have determined the three-dimensional distribution of extinction in the &quot;solar circle&quot; (our region of our galaxy), using visible and near-infrared stellar observations and a model of distribution of stars. The dust causing extinction mainly lies along the spiral arms, as observed in other spiral galaxies.

==Measuring extinction towards an object==

To measure the extinction curve for a star, the star&#x27;s spectrum is compared to the observed spectrum of a similar star known not to be affected by extinction (unreddened). It is also possible to use a theoretical spectrum instead of the observed spectrum for the comparison, but this is less common. In the case of emission nebulae, it is common to look at the ratio of two emission lines which should not be affected by the temperature and density in the nebula. For example, the ratio of hydrogen-alpha to hydrogen-beta emission is always around 2.85 under a wide range of conditions prevailing in nebulae. A ratio other than 2.85 must therefore be due to extinction, and the amount of extinction can thus be calculated.

==The 2175-angstrom feature==

One prominent feature in measured extinction curves of many objects within the Milky Way is a broad &#x27;bump&#x27; at about 2175 Å, well into the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This feature was first observed in the 1960s, but its origin is still not well understood. Several models have been presented to account for this bump which include graphitic grains with a mixture of PAH molecules. Investigations of interstellar grains embedded in interplanetary dust particles (IDP) observed this feature and identified the carrier with organic carbon and amorphous silicates present in the grains.

==Extinction curves of other galaxies==
The form of the standard extinction curve depends on the composition of the ISM, which varies from galaxy to galaxy. In the Local Group, the best-determined extinction curves are those of the Milky Way, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).

In the LMC, there is significant variation in the characteristics of the ultraviolet extinction with a weaker 2175 Å bump and stronger far-UV extinction in the region associated with the LMC2 supershell (near the 30 Doradus starbursting region) than seen elsewhere in the LMC and in the Milky Way. In the SMC, more extreme variation is seen with no 2175 Å bump and very strong far-UV extinction in the star forming Bar and fairly normal ultraviolet extinction seen in the more quiescent Wing.

This gives clues as to the composition of the ISM in the various galaxies. Previously, the different average extinction curves in the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC were thought to be the result of the different metallicities of the three galaxies: the LMC&#x27;s metallicity is about 40% of that of the Milky Way, while the SMC&#x27;s is about 10%. Finding extinction curves in both the LMC and SMC which are similar to those found in the Milky Way and finding extinction curves in the Milky Way that look more like those found in the LMC2 supershell of the LMC and in the SMC Bar has given rise to a new interpretation. The variations in the curves seen in the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way may instead be caused by processing of the dust grains by nearby star formation. This interpretation is supported by work in starburst galaxies (which are undergoing intense star formation episodes) which shows that their dust lacks the 2175 Å bump.

==Atmospheric extinction==
Atmospheric extinction gives the rising or setting Sun an orange hue and varies with location and altitude. Astronomical observatories generally are able to characterise the local extinction curve very accurately, to allow observations to be corrected for the effect. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is completely opaque to many wavelengths requiring the use of satellites to make observations.

This extinction has three main components: Rayleigh scattering by air molecules, scattering by particulates, and molecular absorption. Molecular absorption is often referred to as telluric absorption, as it is caused by the Earth (&quot;telluric&quot; is a synonym for &quot;terrestrial&quot;). The most important sources of telluric absorption are molecular oxygen and ozone, which strongly absorb radiation near ultraviolet, and water, which strongly absorbs infrared.

The amount of such extinction is lowest at the observer&#x27;s zenith and highest near the horizon. A given star, preferably at solar opposition, reaches its greatest celestial altitude and optimal time for observation when the star is near the local meridian around solar midnight and if the star has a favorable declination (&quot;i.e.&quot;, similar to the observer&#x27;s latitude); thus, the seasonal time due to axial tilt is key. Extinction is approximated by multiplying the standard atmospheric extinction curve (plotted against each wavelength) by the mean air mass calculated over the duration of the observation. A dry atmosphere reduces infrared extinction significantly.

<text>Max Raabe (born Matthias Otto, 12 December 1962) is a German jazz singer. He is best known as the founder and leader of the Palast Orchester.

== Career ==
Raabe developed an interest in the sound of German dance and film music of the 1920s and 1930s, such as the songs of the Comedian Harmonists, from seeing old films on television and from his parents&#x27; record collection. He formally studied music at the Berlin University of the Arts, intending originally to become a baritone opera singer. He and eleven other students formed the Palast Orchester in 1985. The ensemble initially used music arrangements that Raabe found at various flea markets. 

The orchestra practised these arrangements for one year without any public engagements or performances. The orchestra first performed publicly at the 1987 Berliner Theaterball, in the lobby as a secondary act, but with such success that the audience left the ballroom to hear the orchestra&#x27;s performance in the lobby. Raabe and the Palast Orchester had a hit with his 1992 original, Schlager-styled song &quot;Kein Schwein ruft mich an&quot; (&quot;Nobody ever calls me&quot;, almost literal translation: &quot;No pig calls me&quot;), a pop song in 1920s style.

In addition to covers of vintage music, Raabe writes original songs and music, including film music. He and the orchestra have also created covers of modern pop songs in a 1920–1930s band style, including songs by Britney Spears, Tom Jones, and Salt&#x27;n&#x27;Pepa. 

Raabe has also made a number of cameo appearances as a stereotypical 1920s and 1930s singer and entertainer in a number of films by German directors, such as &quot;Der bewegte Mann&quot; (1994; English title &quot;Maybe, Maybe Not&quot;), Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Invincible&quot; (2001), and Wenzel Storch&#x27;s &quot;Die Reise ins Glück&quot; (2004). His live theatre performances include a 1994 appearance as Dr. Siedler in the Berlin &quot;Bar jeder Vernunft&quot; version of &quot;The White Horse Inn&quot;, and 1999 performances as Mack the Knife in Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; alongside Nina Hagen.

Raabe first performed in the USA in Los Angeles in 2004. In 2005, he performed his first concert in New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall and returned for subsequent engagements with the Palast Orchester in 2007 and 2010. In 2011, Raabe produced an album, &quot;Küssen kann man nicht alleine&quot; (You cannot kiss alone), with former new-wave musician and producer Annette Humpe, who also wrote the lyrics. His latest album, also with Humpe, is &quot;Für Frauen ist das kein Problem&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s no problem for women&quot;), released in 2013.

In 2022, Raabe made an appearance as himself in the 1920s neo-noir series &quot;Babylon Berlin&quot;, in which he performed a single titled &quot;Ein Tag wie Gold&quot;.

<doc id="1231823" wikidata="Q14934808" url="?curid=1231823" title="Glenbrook rail accident">
<text>The Glenbrook rail accident occurred on 2 December 1999 at 8:22 am on a curve east of Glenbrook railway station on the CityRail network between Glenbrook and Lapstone, in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. Seven passengers were killed and 51 passengers were taken to hospital with injuries when a CityRail V set electric multiple unit collided with the rear wagon of the long-haul Perth-to-Sydney Indian Pacific.

== Overview ==

The Indian Pacific train was authorised to pass a red signal at Glenbrook and stopped at the next signal, also red. The driver alighted to use the lineside signal telephone to call the signaller for authority to pass the signal at danger; as a component of the phone was missing, he incorrectly believed it to be defective. A delay of approximately seven minutes resulted despite the locomotive having a radio (at that time it was not a procedure for the National Rail Corporation to use a radio to contact signal boxes).

The interurban train restarted with authority after stopping at the red signal at Glenbrook and collided shortly after with the rear of the Indian Pacific train waiting at the second failed signal. Several factors were involved, from equipment breakdown to poor phrasing of the safe working rules: the most important was that the interurban picked up too much speed and the driver was not able to see the rear of the Indian Pacific around a sharp curve in a deep cutting in time to avoid a collision. This is essentially equivalent to a blind corner.

== Visibility ==
The track was curved to the left, the train was using the left-hand track, the driver was sitting on the left side of the train, and the track was in a narrow rock cutting. These four factors contributed to less than average visibility.

== Inquiry ==

A Commission of Inquiry headed by Justice Peter McInerney investigated the accident.

===Causes===
The Commission found that the accident occurred after a power failure disabled two consecutive automatic signals: due to their fail-safe design, both exhibited danger (red).

Both trains obtained permission from the signalman at Penrith to pass the first signal at danger. The driver of the Indian Pacific obeyed the rule requiring him to proceed with &quot;extreme caution&quot;, but the driver of the interurban train failed to do so and caught up with the Indian Pacific.

The Commission found fault with a number of procedures, their application by railway employees, and the training those employees had received. Among other factors, it found that:

* the signalman was unable to monitor the position of the Indian Pacific, so was unaware it had not cleared the second signal;
* safety-critical communication was too informal;
* the train controller in Sydney told the driver of the interurban train by radio, &quot;it&#x27;s only an auto... just trip past&quot;, thereby potentially misleading the driver into believing that the signal section was clear; the signalman in Penrith was not aware of this exchange;
* the driver of the interurban train failed to proceed with &quot;extreme caution&quot;, as required by the rule, and so was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision.
* training for passing signals at danger was deficient, as was the rule, safeworking unit 245.

===Effects===
The seven people who died were in the front compartment of the first carriage of the interurban train. The rear carriage of the Indian Pacific was a car transport wagon that did not convey passengers, and, in absorbing the brunt of the collision, was arguably the reason there were not any fatalities on board the Indian Pacific. The impact of the collision was such that the front six metres of the interurban car were compressed into just one metre, while also causing the first six carriages of the Indian Pacific to separate from the rest of the train. When the driver of the CityRail train saw the stationary Indian Pacific, he ran from the driver&#x27;s compartment (the dead-man&#x27;s brake was automatically activated) to the lower deck of the double-decker carriage warning the passengers to brace themselves. He was badly injured, but survived because of this. As he ran through, a man from the front compartment ran to the upper deck to warn the passengers and thereby also survived the crash.

A third train, bound for Lithgow, only narrowly avoided colliding with the wreckage when signallers managed to warn the driver to stop just 60 seconds before it reached the crash site.

===The interurban train===
The train was a standard four-car V set, labelled V21. The first carriage, DIM8067, received critical damage to its front and lower compartments, but it was repaired. To avoid any reference and insensitivity to the victims, it was re-numbered DIM8020 and remained in service until it was withdrawn in 2005 following many problems.

<text>Catalyst (later Catalyst Forum) was a left wing independent think tank based in London, set up in 1998 to promote policies directed to the redistribution of power, wealth and opportunity. Though not aligned to any political party, it was generally sympathetic to the Labour movement and described itself as &quot;an organisation of the left&quot;.

The organisation was founded at the high point of Tony Blair&#x27;s modernisation of the Labour Party and struggled to attract funding, especially from the trades unions who had originally been expected to be the most sympathetic to its redistributionist platform. Trades unions, concerned at further exclusion from power either by the electorate or the new Labour Party leadership, took a sharp turn away from too deep an association with the Left at this time and only begun in 2005 and 2006 to develop an increased if cautious interest in left-wing thought as a new generation of activist trades union leaders has emerged.

Former Deputy Labour Leader, Roy Hattersley, who was on the (centre-left) Labour Party&#x27;s right-wing, but egalitarian, was an early supporter, as was John Edmonds, General Secretary of the GMB Union

However, Catalyst was never a political or campaigning organisation and restricted itself to public policy work on redistribution and looking at soft areas like identity politics and public administration that were often neglected on the Left in favour of economics and social policy. It was never associated with the so-called Hard Left.

Catalyst&#x27;s first director was former Director of Policy at the Labour Party, Roland Wales, who was followed by Barbara Gunnell, Martin McIvor, and Jenny Smith. Its founding board of management included: Marjorie Thompson, Mark Seddon, Mike Watts, Nyta Mann, Pat Coyne, Tim Pendry, Hilary Wainwright, and Richard Stone. It had a prestigious Advisory Board. Lack of funds did not stop it from putting out a series of pamphlets, some of which proved contentious. For example, Simon Partridge authored one with a revisionist view of nationalism which was avowedly &quot;left-Burkean&quot;. The organisation adopted creatively low-cost ways of making itself known. Its annual reception became a high point for centre-left political exiles from the Labour Movement to meet and catch up.

It not only survived the modernisation period but re-emerged strengthened in later years with a new generation of academics and intellectuals prepared to develop alternative democratic socialist policies. In 2003 Catalyst won the &quot;One To Watch&quot; category at Prospect magazine&#x27;s annual Think Tank Awards. In 2006 it merged with the Compass organisation.

<text>Oysterhead is an American rock supergroup featuring bassist Les Claypool of Primus, guitarist Trey Anastasio of Phish and drummer Stewart Copeland of The Police, with both Claypool and Anastasio providing vocals. The band&#x27;s eclectic sound has been described as &quot;alt-funk fusion&quot;.

In April 2000 Superfly Presents asked Claypool to assemble a band to perform during New Orleans Jazz Fest. Claypool contacted Anastasio and together they agreed on mutual hero, Copeland. Oysterhead was originally intended to be a singular live performance at New Orleans Saenger Theatre on May 4, 2000. The band compiled a set of almost entirely original material for the show, practicing at Muskegon&#x27;s Frauenthal Theatre. Tickets were scalped for up to $2,000 each; audience members included Francis Ford Coppola and Matt Groening. The band toured in 2001 and was scheduled to tour in 2020. Both times it has toured it has been interrupted due to significant disasters, in 2001 due to the September 11 attacks and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Oysterhead played at The Peach Music Festival in Scranton, PA in July 2021.

==&quot;The Grand Pecking Order&quot;==
In 2001, Oysterhead reformed to record and release an album entitled &quot;The Grand Pecking Order&quot;, which featured nine new tracks in addition to four songs originally debuted in New Orleans. The album was released on October 2, 2001, and was supported by a North American tour, spanning from October 21 to November 18, 2001, accompanied by North Mississippi Allstars, Drums &amp; Tuba, The Cancer Conspiracy, Lake Trout, Mark Ribot y Los Cubanos Postizos and New Orleans Klezmer Allstars. Two pre-tour warm-up shows had been booked at Toad&#x27;s Place in New Haven, Connecticut for September 14, 2001 and the Irving Plaza in New York City, New York (as part of CMJ Music Marathon) for September 15, 2001, but were cancelled in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Oysterhead&#x27;s 2001 tour saw the debut of the Matterhorn, a guitar played by Trey Anastasio featuring a full-size deer antler. On November 15, 2001, the band performed the song &quot;Oz Is Ever Floating&quot; on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

==Reformation at Bonnaroo==
On June 16, 2006, Oysterhead reunited to perform a two-hour set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival. The band performed music from &quot;The Grand Pecking Order&quot; during the set.

==Reformation in 2019==
In October 2019, Oysterhead created social media accounts on Instagram and Twitter and announced they would play two reunion shows in February 2020 at 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado.

While the band went on to schedule additional 2020 tour dates in California and at several US festivals, only the two Colorado dates were performed before the other dates were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Oysterhead resumed touring in 2021.

When asked in March 2022 if the band planned to record a second album, Claypool said it was unclear: &quot;We always talk about it when we&#x27;re sitting around, but all three of us are so busy. We haven&#x27;t really found the time to do it. It&#x27;s an undertaking. You&#x27;ve got three guys that are all alpha dogs in the same room. It&#x27;s more of an undertaking I think, but who knows. I&#x27;ve been talking to Stewart lately about trying to get together and just start jamming on some shit and see what happens.&quot;

<text>Hugolín Gavlovič (born as Martin Gavlovič) (11 November 1712, Czarny Dunajec – 4 June 1787, Horovce) was a Slovak Franciscan priest who authored religious, moral, and educational writings in the contemporary West Slovak vernacular, and was a prominent representative of baroque literature in Slovakia. 

== Career ==
He wrote didactical-reflexive poetry. His works are written in a West Slovak vernacular which &quot;is situated temporally as well as linguistically between the systems described by Pavel Doležal and by Anton Bernolák&quot; (Ďurovič &quot;The Language of Walaska Sskola&quot; 659). His most famous piece of work is &quot;Valašská škola, mravúv stodola&quot; (originally published under the name &quot;Walaska Sskola Mrawuw Stodola&quot;), a work of 17,862 verses, nearly all in fourteen syllables, as well as numerous versified couplet-marginalia.

<doc id="1231856" wikidata="Q777591" url="?curid=1231856" title="For Love of the Game (film)">
<text>For Love of the Game is a 1999 American sports drama film directed by Sam Raimi and written by Dana Stevens, based on Michael Shaara&#x27;s 1991 novel of the same title. Starring Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston, it follows the perfect game performance of an aging star baseball pitcher as he deals with the pressures of pitching in Yankee Stadium in his final outing by calming himself with memories of a long-term relationship.

The play-by-play of the game is announced by longtime Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers baseball broadcaster Vin Scully, who himself called four perfect games in his career, and Steve Lyons.

The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office disappointment, grossing $46.1 million against a $50 million production budget. Costner received a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor.

==Plot==
The Detroit Tigers travel to New York to play a season-ending series against the New York Yankees. At 63–97, the team has long since been eliminated from playoff contention and are playing for nothing but pride against the Yankees, who have a chance to clinch the American League East with a win.

In his Manhattan hotel suite, 40-year-old pitcher Billy Chapel awaits his girlfriend Jane Aubrey, but she doesn&#x27;t show. Jane is a single mother with a teenage daughter Heather whom Billy got to know. The next morning, Billy is told by Tigers&#x27; owner Gary Wheeler that the team has been sold and that the new owners&#x27; first move will be to end Billy&#x27;s 19-year tenure with the Tigers by trading him to the San Francisco Giants. Billy learns from Jane that she is leaving that same day to accept a job offer in London.

Billy is a famous, accomplished pitcher, but has a losing record this season, is near the end of his career, and is recovering from a hand injury. Wheeler hints that Billy should consider retiring rather than join another team. As he goes to Yankee Stadium to make his last start of the year, Billy reflects about Jane, detailing how they met five years prior. These flashbacks are interspersed within the game, along with glimpses of Jane watching the game on a television at the airport.

As the game progresses, Billy dominates the Yankees&#x27; batters, often talking to himself on how to pitch each one. While in the dugout resting between innings, Billy reflects how he shut Jane out of his life after he suffered a career-threatening injury in the off-season. The pain of pitching intensifies as the game progresses.

Billy is so caught up in his thoughts that he does not realize he is pitching a perfect game until he looks at the scoreboard in the bottom of the eighth inning. Friend and catcher Gus Sinski confirms that no one has reached base, and that the whole team is rallying behind Billy to do whatever it takes to keep the perfect game bid alive. Billy&#x27;s shoulder pain has become intense, and after he throws his first two pitches of the inning well out of the strike zone, Tigers manager Frank Perry makes the call to warm up two relief pitchers in the bullpen. The count goes to 3–0 before Billy recalls pitching to his father (now deceased) in the back yard. He rallies and throws a strike, then gets the batter out on the next pitch.

Before the Tigers take the field for the bottom of the ninth inning, Billy has final ruminations about his career and his love for Jane. He autographs a baseball for Wheeler, who has been like a father to him for many years. Along with a signature, Billy inscribes the ball with &quot;Tell them I&#x27;m through. For love of the game.&quot; Ken Strout comes up representing the last chance for New York. Strout chops up the middle just out of the reach of Chapel, heading towards center field. The Tigers&#x27; shortstop dives and throws to first in time to retire Strout, giving Chapel his perfect game.

Billy sits alone in his hotel room as the realization sinks in that everything he has been and done for the past 19 years is over. Despite his amazing accomplishment, Billy weeps not only for the loss of baseball, but for the other love of his life, Jane.

The next morning, Billy goes to the airport to inquire about a flight for London. Jane had missed her flight the night before so she could watch the end of his perfect game. He finds her there waiting for her plane and they embrace and reconcile.

==Cast==

* Kevin Costner as Billy Chapel
* Kelly Preston as Jane Aubrey
* John C. Reilly as Gus Sinski
* Jena Malone as Heather
* Joe Lisi as Pete
* Brian Cox as Gary Wheeler
* J. K. Simmons as Frank Perry

In addition, playing themselves, are television sportscasters Vin Scully and Steve Lyons, as well as Yankee&#x27;s stadium announcer Bob Sheppard.

The pitching coach who prepared Costner for this role was Mike Buddie, a former middle reliever for the Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers. Buddie also had a small speaking role in the film as the character Jack Spellman, the starting pitcher for the Yankees. The Yankees manager is played by Augie Garrido, then head coach of the University of Texas Longhorns. Garrido was previously head baseball coach of California State University Fullerton, which is Costner&#x27;s alma mater.

==Production==
Sydney Pollack was originally slated as the director, with Tom Cruise cast in the part of Billy Chapel. Armyan Bernstein, chief of Beacon Pictures, got Kevin Costner interested in the film. The studio wanted to keep the film&#x27;s budget to $50 million, so Costner helped out by waiving his usual $20 million salary in exchange for a bigger percentage of the film&#x27;s gross; Costner was also given the generous rights of final cut privilege (normally only given to the producer or director, if anyone) and director approval.

Director Sam Raimi, who had previously only done low-budget films, later explained why he agreed to take on the big budget project: &quot;I was simply moved by the screenplay. It was moving and simple and I love baseball. I love baseball and I thought it hadn&#x27;t really been put on film and I wanted to see it on the wide screen format. I thought that would be exciting for the audience, like being at a game. I get so excited by some baseball games I wanted to see if I could put some of that into the picture. And I simply liked it and wanted to try something different.&quot;

The actor playing Billy Chapel as a child in the opening credits is also Costner; the footage is actually old home movies of Costner and his father. J. K. Simmons later joked about the fact that he was only nine days older than Costner, despite being cast as a 63-year-old.

During post-production, a handful of lines (amounting to roughly 10 seconds of film) were edited or cut in order to prevent the film being given an &quot;R&quot; rating under the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. Costner objected to the edits but was overruled by Universal Pictures, and his contract specified that he only had final cut privilege so long as the film was rated &quot;PG-13&quot; and had a running time of less than 2 hours, 10 minutes. A week before the film was to hit theatres, he voiced his complaints in a &quot;Newsweek&quot; interview, a breach of professional etiquette when speaking about a current film that one appears in. Universal Pictures co-chairman Stacey Snider, while agreeing with Costner that the cuts the Motion Picture Association demanded were unjust, stated, &quot;Kevin&#x27;s not the director and it&#x27;s not fair for him to hijack a $50-million asset. I realize this is very much about principle for Kevin, but principle doesn’t mean that you never compromise. Our feeling is that we have backed the filmmaker and his name is Sam Raimi, not Kevin Costner.&quot; Raimi, while supporting Universal&#x27;s decision and agreeing that a &quot;PG-13&quot; rating was a necessity, said he sympathized with Costner&#x27;s feelings and wished the lines could have been kept in without losing the &quot;PG-13&quot; rating. Universal compromised with Costner on the length, allowing a final cut of 2 hours, 17 minutes. Recognizing that he might nonetheless feel betrayed after he had waived his usual fee, Universal offered to pay him the full $20 million fee, but Costner declined.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

In Roger Ebert&#x27;s review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, he gave the film one and a half stars out of four, calling it &quot;the most lugubrious and soppy love story in many a moon, a step backward for director Sam Raimi after &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;, and yet another movie in which Kevin Costner plays a character who has all the right window dressing but is neither juicy nor interesting.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened at No. 2 with a weekend gross of $13,041,685 from 2,829 theaters for a per venue average of $7,023. Ultimately, &quot;For Love of the Game&quot; grossed only $35,188,640 domestically and an additional $10,924,000 in other territories to a total of $46,112,640 worldwide. Based on an estimated $50 million budget, the film lost money.

<text>Patch Adams is a 1998 American biographical comedy-drama film directed by Tom Shadyac and starring Robin Williams (in the title role), Monica Potter, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bob Gunton, Daniel London, and Peter Coyote. Set in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it is loosely based on the life story of medical doctor Hunter &quot;Patch&quot; Adams and the book &quot;Gesundheit: Good Health Is a Laughing Matter&quot; by Adams and Maureen Mylander. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with criticism for the sentimentality and direction. It was a box-office success and grossed $202.3 million against a $50–90 million budget.

==Plot==
In 1969, Hunter &quot;Patch&quot; Adams, after developing suicidal thoughts, admits himself to a mental institution. There, he finds that using humor, rather than doctor-centered psychotherapy, better helps his fellow patients and provides him with a new purpose in life. Because of this, he wants to become a medical doctor and swiftly leaves the facility. Two years later, he enrolls at the Medical College of Virginia as its oldest first-year student.

Adams questions the school&#x27;s soulless approach to medical care, particularly why students do not work with patients until their third year, as well as the methods of the school&#x27;s dean, Walcott, who takes an instant disliking to Adams. Walcott believes that doctors must treat patients his way and not befriend them. Because of this and incidents such as setting up a giant model papier-mâché pair of legs in stirrups during an obstetric conference, he is expelled from the medical school. However, he is reinstated when it becomes apparent to the school that his unorthodox methods often improve his patients&#x27; physical and mental health. Adams encourages medical students to work closely with nurses, learn interviewing skills early, and argues that death should be treated with dignity and sometimes even humor.

Adams begins a friendship with fellow student Carin Fisher, and, during their third year as medical students, develops his idea for a medical clinic built around his philosophy of treating patients using humor and compassion. With the help of Arthur Mendelson, a wealthy man who was a patient who Adams met while in the mental hospital, he purchases in West Virginia to construct the future Gesundheit! Institute. Together with Fisher, medical student Truman Schiff and some old friends, he renovates an old cottage into a clinic. When the clinic opens, they treat patients without medical insurance and perform comedy sketches for them.

Adams&#x27;s close friendship with Fisher soon turns into romance. When she reveals to him that she had been molested as a child, he comforts her and reassures her that she can overcome her pain by helping others. Encouraged, Fisher wants to help a disturbed patient, Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Silver. However, Silver murders Fisher with a shotgun and then immediately kills himself in a murder-suicide. Adams, guilt-ridden by Fisher&#x27;s death, begins to question the goodness in humanity. Standing on a cliff, he contemplates suicide again and asks God for an explanation. He sees a butterfly, and it reminds him that Fisher had always wished that she were a caterpillar that could turn into a butterfly and fly away. The butterfly lands on his medical bag and shirt before flying away. With his spirits revived, he decides to dedicate his work to her memory.

Walcott eventually discovers that Adams has been illegally running a clinic and practicing medicine without a license and attempts to expel him again because of this, also complaining that he has made his patients uncomfortable. Desperate to prove Walcott wrong, Adams files a grievance with the state medical board on the advice of his former medical school roommate, conservative Mitch Roman. Adams succeeds in convincing the board that he must treat the spirit as well as the body. The board, although still finding some of Adams&#x27;s methods very unorthodox, allows him to graduate, and he receives a standing ovation from the packed hearing room.

At graduation, Adams receives his Doctor of Medicine degree and, bowing to the professors and audience, reveals himself to be naked underneath his cap and gown.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Development===

Paul Attanasio was brought in as a script doctor to work on the film prior to shooting.

The film was shot in three locations: Mare Island, California (near San Francisco), Asheville, North Carolina, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A diner was temporarily placed in Point Richmond (a neighborhood in Richmond, California) and served as the university diner. Several interior classroom scenes were filmed on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.

The film has several major departures from Adams&#x27;s real history. One is that the character of Carin Fisher is fictional but is analogous to a real-life friend of Adams (a man) who was murdered under similar circumstances. Another difference is the 47-year-old Robin Williams portraying Adams as enrolling in medical school very late in his life, his older age even being brought up in dialogue. In reality, Adams started medical school immediately and his educational progress was quite normal for a physician: he graduated high school at 18, college at 22, and medical school at 26.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released on December 25, 1998, in the United States and Canada, and grossed $25.2 million in 2,712 theaters in its opening weekend, ranking number one at the box office. It achieved the third-highest December opening weekend, behind &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Scream 2&quot;. It went on to set a record for having the highest Christmas opening weekend, beating &quot;Michael&quot;. The film would hold this record until 2000 when &quot;Cast Away&quot; took it. After its first weekend, it was number two for four weeks. The film grossed $135 million in the United States and Canada, and $67.3 million in other territories, totaling $202.3 million worldwide.

===Critical reception===
On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Patch Adams&quot; has an approval score of 21% based on 71 reviews, and an average rating of 4.2/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Syrupy performances and directing make this dramedy all too obvious.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 26 out of 100, based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s lowbrow comedy, which did not mesh well with its &quot;maudlin streak&quot;, and that the sentiment felt &quot;fabricated&quot;.

Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an F, deeming it &quot;an offensive and deeply false &#x27;inspirational&#x27; drama&quot;, lambasting the over-simplified portrayal of the medical establishment of the time.

Robert K. Elder of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called Monica Potter &quot;the best thing about the otherwise dopey &quot;Patch Adams&quot;.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, and wrote, &quot;Patch Adams&quot; made me want to spray the screen with Lysol. This movie is shameless. It&#x27;s not merely a tearjerker. It extracts tears individually by liposuction, without anesthesia.&quot; It received &quot;Two Thumbs Down&quot; on his television series &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, with particular criticism toward the character of Adams, who was viewed as &quot;overbearing&quot;, &quot;obnoxious&quot;, and &quot;sanctimonious&quot;, as well as noting that they would never trust a doctor who acted like Adams does. Co-host Gene Siskel said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather turn my head and cough than see any part of &quot;Patch Adams&quot; again.&quot;

=== Patch Adams&#x27;s reaction ===
The real Patch Adams has been openly critical of the film, saying that it sacrificed much of his message to make a film that would sell. He also said that out of all aspects of his life and activism, the film portrayed him merely as a funny doctor. At a Conference on World Affairs, he told film critic Roger Ebert, &quot;I hate that movie.&quot;

During a speech in 2010 at the Mayo Clinic, Adams said, &quot;The film promised to build our hospital. None of the profits from the film ever came to us, and so, basically 40 years into this work, we are still trying to build our hospital.&quot; Furthermore, Adams stated,
[Robin Williams] made $21 million for four months of pretending to be me, in a very simplistic version, and did not give $10 to my free hospital. Patch Adams, the person, would have, if I had Robin&#x27;s money, given all $21 million to a free hospital in a country where 80 million cannot get care.

Adams later clarified that he did not hate Williams, and Williams actively supported St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital for several years. After Williams&#x27;s death in 2014, Adams said, &quot;I&#x27;m enormously grateful for his wonderful performance of my early life, which has allowed the Gesundheit Institute to continue and expand our work.&quot;

== Accolades ==
Marc Shaiman&#x27;s score was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score. The film was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Robin Williams).

== Home media ==
&quot;Patch Adams&quot; was released on VHS in 1999 and a Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD on June 22, 1999. On August 16, 2016, the film was released on Blu-ray for the first time.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack for &quot;Patch Adams&quot; was released on December 22, 1998, on CD and cassette by Universal Records.

Tracks 10 through 18 were written and performed by Marc Shaiman.

<text>Volksgrenadier, also spelt Volks-Grenadier, was the name given to a type of German Army division formed in the autumn of 1944 after the double loss of Army Group Centre to the Soviets in Operation Bagration and the Fifth Panzer Army to the Western Allies in Normandy. The name itself was intended to build morale, appealing at once to nationalism (&quot;Volk&quot;) and Germany&#x27;s older military traditions (&quot;Grenadier&quot;). Germany formed 78 VGDs during the war. &quot;Volksgrenadier&quot; divisions were professional military formations with standardized weapons and equipment, unlike the unrelated &quot;Volkssturm&quot; militia.

==History and organization==
The strategic emergency and concomitant manpower shortage resulting from the losses in mid-1944 required the creation of infantry divisions that economized on personnel and emphasized defensive strength over offensive strength. The &quot;Volksgrenadier&quot; divisions met this need by using only six line infantry battalions instead of the normal nine for infantry divisions – already a common reality for many existing divisions. The units also had a higher proportion of submachine guns and light automatic weapons and thus relied more on short-range firepower than in standard German Army infantry units. Automatic weapons like the new &quot;Sturmgewehr 44&quot; and anti-tank weaponry like the single shot &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; were also used by &quot;Volksgrenadier&quot; units. One battalion of one grenadier regiment and the two companies of the engineer battalion were assigned bicycles for transportation instead of motor vehicles.

They were organized around small cadres of hardened veteran soldiers, noncommissioned officers and officers, and then bulked out with anything the Replacement Army could supply: &quot;jobless&quot; personnel of the shrinking &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, recovered wounded soldiers from broken formations returning to duty from hospitals, older men who would have been considered too old or too unfit for the peacetime army, and young men and teenagers from the latest conscription classes were all recruited into the ranks.

==Battles==
&quot;Volksgrenadier&quot; divisions participated in battles in eastern France, the defense of the Siegfried Line, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Scheldt, the Battle of the Bulge, the Battle of Otterlo, the Eastern Front, and in the final battles in Germany itself. Some &quot;Volksgrenadier&quot; divisions performed well, while others were rushed into battle with a minimum of training. Several &quot;Volksgrenadier&quot; divisions, especially those made up of &quot;jobless&quot; &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; personnel drawn from the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, often displayed high motivation and morale which resulted in good cohesion and military effectiveness against the Allied forces in the last eight or so months (about October 1944 through May 1945) of the war in Europe.

<text>Ingrid Julia Chavez (born January 21, 1965) is an American singer-songwriter, poet, and visual artist.

==Early life==
Chavez was born on January 21, 1965, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and raised in Marietta, Georgia. She is of Mexican-American descent. At the age of 10, she was sent by her mother to live with relatives in Atlanta, Georgia. 

Living in a rundown neighbourhood of Atlanta with Steve Snow, her musician boyfriend at the time, and her newborn, she decided to relocate to Minneapolis — her boyfriend&#x27;s hometown — after a burglary of their home, to pursue a career in music.

==Career==
After moving to Minneapolis, in 1986, she auditioned for a number of bands, made the rounds of the Minneapolis music scene, and paid her bills working in a coffee shop. She met Prince in a pub in late 1987, having written to him. Impressed by Chavez&#x27;s voice and poetry, Prince took Chavez under his wing. She was known as &quot;The Spirit Child&quot; on his 1988 &quot;Lovesexy&quot; album (She does the outro on Alphabet St. amongst other things). Prince encouraged Chavez to write 21 poems with the promise that they would make a poetry album together. In January 1988, Ingrid and Prince recorded The Poetry Session at Paisley Park Studios. Prince improvised on keyboards while Ingrid recited her poetry. Shortly after this session the project was put on hold.

In 1989, Chavez formed a band called Skyfish with Richard Werbowenko. They created a six-song album released only on cassette. Chavez ran into Prince a year or so later and handed him a copy of the Skyfish demo. Shortly after the exchange, Prince contacted Chavez and wanted her to listen to a track that he had just finished with the poem &quot;Heaven Must Be Near&quot;. Prince asked Chavez to finish the poetry album.

It was at this time that Chavez was asked to play the part of Prince&#x27;s romantic interest in his 1990 film &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot;. During the filming Chavez went into the studio with Lenny Kravitz and Andre Betts and co-wrote and recorded what became Madonna&#x27;s sultry 1990 hit &quot;Justify My Love&quot;. She received a large out-of-court settlement for not being credited on the single&#x27;s release.

In 1992, not long after recording vocals with David Sylvian for the songs &quot;Heartbeat (Tainai Kaiki II) - Returning to the Womb&quot; and &quot;Cloud #9&quot; on Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, Chavez married Sylvian, and over the years contributed her trademark breathy vocals to a number of her baritone-voiced husband&#x27;s releases.

During the mid-1990s, Chavez worked with Sylvian and Werbowenko on a second solo album titled &quot;Little Girls with 99 Lives&quot;. Chavez and Sylvian sent out demos to record labels and close friends, yet could not strike up interest in a deal. The album would have included tracks entitled &quot;Lighthouse&quot;, &quot;Snowfall&quot;, &quot;Whose Trip Is This?&quot;, &quot;Starred and Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Kall/Les Fleurs Du Mal&quot;, and &quot;Remembering Julia&quot;—the latter four of which can be found as B-sides on the 2-CD UK single of David Sylvian&#x27;s &quot;I Surrender&quot;. These four tracks were later collected and released as an EP titled &quot;Little Girl with 99 Lives&quot; Ep in 2010 through Ingrid&#x27;s Ten Windows records.

In 1996, Tommy Roberts, a former Minneapolis recording engineer who recorded the Skyfish demo, contacted Chavez and asked her to be in a band with him. She joined the band, called Ova, and recorded a four-song EP. Chavez became pregnant and decided to let go of the project and focus on her family.

Chavez teamed up with Chicago native, Marco Valentin to form the duo Black Eskimo in 2011. The 12-song full-length &quot;Deep &amp; Heady&quot; CD was released on November 25, 2013, via Bandcamp. Their song &quot;My Sky&quot; won for Song of the Year (Spoken Word Category) at the 14th Annual Independent Music Awards. In celebration of this award the My Sky Poetry and Music Journal was released. This was the first album released in a physical format as a poetry and music journal.

Ingrid&#x27;s third solo album was due to be released in late 2018. &quot;Memories of Flying&quot; features collaborations with Charles Webster, Ganga, Mashti, Deep Dive Corp., Marco Valentin, and David Hurn.

==Personal life==
Chavez has a son, Tinondre, born circa 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia. She also has two daughters, Ameera and Isobel, with English singer and musician David Sylvian, whom she married in 1992 and divorced in 2003; the disintegration of the marriage informed Sylvian&#x27;s 2003 studio album &quot;Blemish&quot;. Chavez currently lives in New Hampshire focusing on photography, writing and new recording projects.

==Discography==
=== Ingrid Chavez ===

Ingrid Chavez is Chavez&#x27;s debut solo album, which was released in 1991 on Paisley Park Records. The album was initially intended to set her spoken-word poetry to music supplied by Prince. It was recorded gradually from late 1987 to mid-1991. When Warner Bros. pushed for the album to have sung vocals in place of the spoken word, Prince abandoned the project. Five of the album&#x27;s tracks (&quot;Elephant Box&quot;, &quot;Slappy Dappy&quot;, &quot;Jadestone&quot;, &quot;Whispering Dandelions&quot; and &quot;Heaven Must Be Near&quot;) ended up as spoken word with atmospheric music by Prince under his Paisley Park alias, and the remainder were relatively poppy tracks with sung vocals, co-produced by Ingrid with Prince&#x27;s studio hands Michael Koppelman and Levi Seacer Jr.

The album spawned three singles, &quot;Elephant Box,&quot; &quot;Hippy Blood,&quot; and &quot;Heaven Must Be Near.&quot; Each were supported with remix packages that featured contributions by Eric Kupper, Junior Vasquez, and Larry &#x27;Tee&#x27; Robinson.

<doc id="1231888" wikidata="Q220550" url="?curid=1231888" title="Ján Kollár">
<text>Ján Kollár (; 29 July 1793 – 24 January 1852) was a Slovak writer (mainly poet), archaeologist, scientist, Lutheran pastor, politician, and main ideologist of Pan-Slavism.

== Life ==
He studied at the Lutheran Lyceum in Pressburg (Pozsony, Kingdom of Hungary, now Bratislava, Slovakia). In 1817 he enrolled in the University of Jena. His attendance at the Wartburgfest (18 October 1817) has since been credited as being a formative experience with regards to his views on Pan-Slavism.

He spent most of his adult life as a chaplain to the populous but poor Slovak Lutheran community in Pest (Kingdom of Hungary, today part of Budapest, Hungary). From 1849, he was a professor of Slavic archeology at the University of Vienna, and several times he also acted as a counselor to the Austrian government for issues around the Slovaks. He entered the Slovak national movement in its first phase.

His museum (since 1974) in Mošovce was installed in the former granary, which was the only masoned part of Kollár&#x27;s otherwise wooden birth-house. The rest of the house burned down in a fire on 16 August 1863. In 2009 a replica was rebuilt of the original birth-house, which is now a museum.

== Views ==
He worked out a conception of Slav reciprocity. He admitted 4 standard languages: Russian, Polish, Czechoslovak and Serbo-Croatian.

==Works==
Besides writing poetry he also wrote technical literature.

* Slávy Dcera (1824; The daughter of Sláva), collection of two (37 and 39 sonnets) cycles

In this work he worked out the conception of Slavic reciprocity. He expressed his feelings to a woman but this love had transformed to a love to his homeland. The main thematics of this work are:
•love 
•patriotism

It is divided into 5 chapters and it has a foreword.

Předzpěv (Prelude)
The author expressed his fears that the Slovaks will disappear from the face of Europe like other Slavic tribes before. He asked the Slovaks to ask for help from the Russian nation.

1. Sála 
This part contains love sonnets. Kollár glorifies his love Mína, depicting her as an ideal of a Slavic maid, the daughter of goddess Sláva.

2. Labe, Rén, Vltava
In these parts, the author takes us to places where Slavic tribes lived before. He is disappointed because these areas belong to foreign countries now.

3. Dunaj
The author arrives to Slovakia, disillusioned by the poverty of this area. He is highly disappointed and longs for death.

4. Léthé

5. Acheron
Mína becomes a fairy and takes the author to Slavic heaven and hell.

* &quot;O literární vzájemnosti mezi kmeny a nářečími slavskĭmi&quot; (Reciprocity Between the Various Tribes and Dialects of the Slavic Nation, edited and translated into English by Alexander Maxwell)

== Legacy ==

* Guta (Gúta) is a town in southern Slovakia with a Hungarian majority. It was renamed &quot;Kolárovo&quot; in 1948.
* Streets in Stara Pazova, Kisač, Padina and Belgrade in Serbia are named in his honor.
* The gymnasium in Bački Petrovac (Serbia) bears his name.

<doc id="1231892" wikidata="Q3494283" url="?curid=1231892" title="List of Teen Titans episodes">
<text>&quot;Teen Titans&quot; is an American animated television series based on the DC Comics series of the same name by Bob Haney and Bruno Premiani. Developed by Glen Murakami, Sam Register, and David Slack for Cartoon Network and Kids&#x27; WB, it was produced by DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation with Sander Schwartz serving as executive producer and Glen Murakami, Bruce Timm, and Linda M. Steiner signing on as producers. The series follows the adventures of a team of crime-fighting teenaged superheroes, consisting of the leader Robin (Scott Menville), foreign alien princess Starfire (Hynden Walch), the technological genius Cyborg (Khary Payton), the dark sorceress Raven (Tara Strong), and the green shapeshifter Beast Boy (Greg Cipes).

Inspired by the success of the DC Comics based series &quot;Justice League&quot;, the series was created in a semi-serialized format, utilizing anime styles and mixing it with American style animation. The show was greenlit in September 2002 and began airing on Cartoon Network on July 19, 2003, and on Kids&#x27; WB on November 1. The series lasted five seasons, each consisting of 13 episodes. The series was concluded with a television movie titled &quot;Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo&quot; that premiered on September 15, 2006. Each season has a story arc revolving around a main character: Robin (season one), Terra (season two), Cyborg (season three), Raven (season four), and Beast Boy (season five). The series&#x27;s alternative network, Kids&#x27; WB, aired two seasons of the show. All five seasons of the series were released on DVD, starting with the first season on February 7, 2006, and ending with the fifth season on July 22, 2008.

<text>Admiral Sir Max Kennedy Horton, (29 November 1883 – 30 July 1951) was a British submariner during the First World War and commander-in-chief of the Western Approaches in the later half of the Second World War, responsible for British participation in the Battle of the Atlantic.

==Early life==
Max Horton was born in Anglesey to Robert Joseph Angel Horton and Esther/Hester Maude Goldsmid, of the famous Goldsmid/D&#x27;Avigdor Goldsmid Anglo-Jewish family.

Horton joined the Royal Navy officer training ship, HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; on 15 September 1898. Whilst on , he was involved in the rescue efforts when ran aground off Cape Spartel and was subsequently awarded the Board of Trade Medal for Saving Life at Sea in silver.

==First World War==
The outbreak of war saw Lieutenant-Commander Horton in command of one of the first British ocean-going submarines, the 800-ton . At dawn on 13 September 1914, he torpedoed the German light cruiser six miles southwest of Heligoland. &quot;Hela&quot; was hit amidships with the two torpedoes, fired from a range of 600 yards. All but two of her crew were rescued by the and another German ship. Although pursued most of the day by German naval forces, &quot;E9&quot; managed to reach Harwich safely. Entering the port, Horton initiated the tradition of British submariners of hoisting the Jolly Roger after a successful patrol.
Three weeks later, Horton sank the German destroyer off the mouth of the river Ems. For sinking the cruiser and the destroyer, Horton was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).

Sent to the Baltic Sea as part of a British flotilla, Horton sank a number of merchant vessels and, on 2 July 1915, damaged the German armoured cruiser SMS &quot;Prinz Adalbert&quot;. On 31 December 1914, Horton was promoted to Commander.

In 1917, Horton was awarded the bar to his DSO for long and arduous services in command of overseas submarines. Three years later, as a captain, he was awarded a second bar to his DSO for distinguished service in command of the Baltic submarine flotilla.
==Interbellum==
During the 1920s, Horton served as captain of HMS &quot;Conquest&quot; and of the battleship HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;. Promoted to rear admiral on 17 October 1932, he became Commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron with his flag in the battleship HMS &quot;Malaya&quot; in December 1933 and Commander of the 1st Cruiser Squadron with his flag in HMS &quot;London&quot; in 1935. Promoted to vice admiral in 1937, he was given command of the Reserve Fleet that year.

==Second World War==
With the onset of World War II, Horton was put in command of the Northern Patrol enforcing the distant maritime blockade of Germany in the seas between Orkney and the Faroes. In 1940, he was made Rear Admiral Submarines. In the opinion of Horton&#x27;s biographer, Rear Admiral William Scott Chalmers, a new regulation which required the post holder to be an officer who had served aboard submarines in the Great War, was forced through for the sole purpose of ensuring that Horton was on a very short list of qualifiers for this post, almost ensuring his rapid transfer to Aberdour, so great was the desire of some within the Admiralty to have Horton revitalize the submarine arm.

Horton moved his headquarters from Aberdour, where he was under the control of the fleet commanders at Scapa Flow, to Northways in north London, officially because he wanted a freer hand in running his command, but purportedly because Northways was located near some of his favourite golf courses. Horton, an avid golfer, is said to have played a round of golf almost every day during the war (since most of the convoy battles took place at night), and was generously handicapped at a &quot;financial 8&quot;.

He was responsible for the creation of convoy rescue ships, which accompanied some Atlantic convoys to rescue survivors from ships sunk by enemy action. Rescue ships were typically small freighters with passenger accommodations. Conversion to rescue service involved enlarging galley and food storage areas and providing berthing and sanitary facilities for approximately 150 men. The ships carried scrambling nets along the sides, and boats suitable for open sea work instead of normal lifeboats. Rescue ships normally included a small operating room for an embarked naval doctor and sick bay staff.

Having been promoted to full Admiral on 9 January 1941, Horton was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches Command on 17 November 1942. Here he instituted a series of tactical changes in the way the escort ships were to be used. In addition to the existing escort group system, in which groups of ships were assigned to defend the perimeter of convoy boxes, Horton instituted a system of support groups, who would also travel with the convoys, but have much more freedom in pursuing submarines to the death, even if such action necessitated leaving the convoy for longer periods of time than were considered acceptable for escort groups. Horton&#x27;s support groups proved to be decisive in the crucial spring of 1943, taking the battle to the U-boats and crushing the morale of the U-boat arm with persistent and successful counterattacks. Horton is widely credited, along with his predecessor, Admiral Sir Percy Noble, as being one of the most crucial figures in the Allied victory in the Atlantic. In August 1945, Max Horton, at his own request, was placed on the retired list in order to facilitate the promotion of younger officers. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in June 1945 and was Bath King of Arms from January 1946. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of Liverpool.

==Memorials==
There is a memorial to him in Liverpool Cathedral.

In 2019, a full size sculpture of Horton was funded by the Rhosneigr community and placed in Rhosneigr, where he was born. 

In 2021 a footstone was funded by the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation in his honour. The footstone reads, &quot;Admiral Sir Max Horton, RN, Honouring British Commonality and Diversity, Commander-in-Chief responsible for British participation in the Battle of the Atlantic WWII. Admiral Horton was of Jewish heritage born in Anglesey. &#x27;Be strong and of good courage&#x27; Joshua 1:9, Donated by the Hackney Branch of the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women and the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation.&quot; https://www.sdjewishworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Admiral-Horton-with-JASHP-plaque19735.jpg

An anti-submarine trawler, , was sunk on 27 April 1941 by .

<text>Brian James Williams (born July 18, 1946) is a Canadian sportscaster who is best known for his coverage of the Olympic Games.

==Early life==
Williams&#x27; father was a physician. His father&#x27;s work caused the Williams family to relocate to such places as Invermere, British Columbia; New Haven, Connecticut; Edmonton, Alberta; Hamilton, Ontario (where he graduated from Westdale Secondary School); Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan and Grand Rapids, Michigan (where he graduated from Aquinas College with a B.A. in history &amp; political science in 1969). After graduating, he spent a year as a teacher at a Grand Rapids school.

==Broadcasting career==

Williams began his involvement in broadcasting when he applied for a part-time job at his college&#x27;s classical station WXTO which was located in the tower of the Aquinas College&#x27;s Administration Building. Williams also was the first to travel with the Aquinas College &quot;Tommies&quot; Basketball team announcing the &quot;Tommies&quot; basketball games via a one-man telephone connection. Williams&#x27; college goal was to go back to Canada and become a sports journalist.

Williams was long associated with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s sports coverage since joining the network in 1974, after radio employment at Toronto&#x27;s CFRB and CHUM.

===CBC===
Williams served as the studio host for the CBC&#x27;s coverage of the CFL, Formula 1 and horse racing and was the play-by-play announcer for the network&#x27;s coverage of Toronto Blue Jays baseball. He was the principal studio anchor for CBC&#x27;s Olympic Games coverage for the 1984 Winter, 1984 Summer, 1988 Winter, 1988 Summer, 1992 Winter, 1996 Summer, 1998 Winter, 2000 Summer, 2002 Winter, 2004 Summer and 2006 Winter Olympics. Williams also covered the 2002 FIFA World Cup for CBC.

Williams also worked with Peter Mansbridge during &quot;2000 Today&quot;, CBC&#x27;s coverage of the millennium.

===CTV and TSN===
On June 5, 2006, Williams announced plans to move in December 2006 to rival CTV, and its sports network TSN. However, on June 8, 2006, the CBC fired Williams, thereby causing him to join CTV/TSN effective immediately as on-site host of TSN&#x27;s Canadian Football League coverage. (This position should not be confused with the &quot;studio host&quot; position that remains held by Rod Smith.)

Williams was chosen to head the CTV broadcasting team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

On February 22, 2010, while providing coverage of the Winter Olympics, Williams did a skit with Brian Williams, the anchor of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, at CTV&#x27;s Olympic set. Some in the media dubbed this the new &quot;Battle of the Brians,&quot; as NBC&#x27;s Williams compared his own modest set to CTV&#x27;s expensive Olympic studio.

Williams anchored CTV&#x27;s coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He criticized the International Olympic Committee for not properly honouring the Israeli delegates who were slain during the 1972 Summer Olympics.

He continues to appear, as of 2019, as a contributor to &quot;CFL on TSN&quot;, as host of TSN&#x27;s coverage of the Canadian Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, and as host of figure skating coverage on both networks and also contributes content to TSN Radio.

He was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2010.

===Radio===
Until 2019, Williams co-hosted &quot;Don Cherry&#x27;s Grapeline&quot; on Sportsnet Radio, along with Don Cherry, for thirty-five years, first on CFRB radio in Toronto, and then as a syndicated show on Sportsnet.

===Retirement===
Brian Williams announced his retirement from broadcasting on 2 December 2021 after a 50-year career.

==Quirks==
His unique voice and quirks such as frequently announcing the time, sometimes in several different time zones at once, has made him one of Canada&#x27;s most distinctive broadcasters. He is a frequent subject of parody on Canadian comedy shows such as &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;.

== Honours ==
In 2011, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions to sports broadcasting, notably that of amateur sports, and for his community involvement&quot;.

In 2022, he was awarded the Order of Sport, marking his induction into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

===Commonwealth honours===

He became a performer and writer for the CBS comedy-variety television show &quot;Hee Haw&quot;. Here he became an American TV star, becoming familiar as half of the stone-faced singing duo (with Archie Campbell) performing dozens of variations on &quot;Pfft! You Were Gone&quot; (&quot;Where, Oh Where Are You Tonight?&quot;). Tapp also played various recurring characters: hayseed Cousin Clem, pompous senator Samuel B. Sternwheeler, storekeeper Mr. Gordon, and Lavern Nagger, the forever put-upon husband of Ida Lee Nagger (Roni Stoneman).

Gordie Tapp was the special guest star on episode #54 of the popular weekly variety program &quot;The Bobby Vinton Show&quot; in October 1977. The program was produced in Toronto and aired across the United States and Canada. Gordie performed a duet of &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot; with Vinton.

Tapp was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 1990. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1998 for his work in helping raise funds for organizations such as the Canadian Muscular Dystrophy campaign and Easter Seals.

In 1999, he was awarded the Order of Ontario — the highest honour in the province of Ontario.

<doc id="1231911" wikidata="Q4591514" url="?curid=1231911" title="1996 Manchester bombing">
<text>The 1996 Manchester bombing was an attack carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) on 15 June 1996. The IRA detonated a lorry bomb on Corporation Street in the centre of Manchester, England. It was the biggest bomb detonated in Great Britain since the Second World War. It targeted the city&#x27;s infrastructure and economy and caused significant damage, estimated by insurers at million (equivalent to £ in ), a sum surpassed only by the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing, also by the IRA.

At the time, England was hosting the Euro &#x27;96 football championships and a Russia vs. Germany match was scheduled to take place in Manchester the following day. The IRA sent telephoned warnings about 90 minutes before the bomb detonated. At least 75,000 people were evacuated from the region, but the bomb squad were unable to defuse the bomb in time. More than 200 people were injured, but there were no fatalities despite the strength of the bomb, which has been largely credited to the rapid response of emergency services in evacuating the city centre.

Although Manchester had been targeted by the IRA before, it had not been subjected to an attack on this scale. In February 1996, the IRA had ended its seventeen-month ceasefire with a large truck bomb attack on London&#x27;s Docklands financial district, though the 3,300-pound bomb of Manchester was three times the size of the Docklands bomb. The Manchester bombing was condemned by the British and Irish Governments and US President Bill Clinton. Five days after the blast, the IRA issued a statement from Dublin in which it claimed responsibility but regretted causing injury to civilians.

Several buildings were damaged beyond repair and had to be demolished, while many more were closed for months for structural repairs. Most of the rebuilding work was completed by the end of 1999, at a cost of £1.2 billion, although redevelopment continued until 2005. The perpetrators have not been caught, and although Greater Manchester Police (GMP) had suggested it was unlikely that anyone will be charged in connection with the bombing, a suspect was arrested on 8 September 2022. The bombing has, however, been viewed by some as a &quot;catalyst&quot; for Manchester&#x27;s mass regeneration, turning it into a modern &quot;powerhouse&quot; city with above-national average economic growth in the 20 years following the bombing.

==Background==
From 1970, the Provisional Irish Republican Army was carrying out an armed campaign with the ultimate objective of bringing about a united Ireland. As well as attacking military and political targets, it also bombed infrastructure and commercial targets in Northern Ireland and England. It believed that by damaging the economy and causing severe disruption, it could pressure the British government to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland. Manchester had been the target of earlier IRA bombs. As part of the IRA&#x27;s sabotage campaign in 1939-40 multiple bombings took place in Manchester and other English cities. In 1973 and 1974, firebombs damaged city centre businesses for which one man was later imprisoned. In April 1974, a bomb exploded at Manchester Magistrates&#x27; Court, injuring twelve. In 1975, IRA bomb factories were found in Greater Manchester, and five men were imprisoned for planning attacks in North West England. On 3 December 1992, the IRA detonated two small bombs in Manchester city centre, forcing police to evacuate thousands of shoppers. More than 60 were hurt by shattered glass and the blasts cost an estimated £10 million in damage and business losses.

The Downing Street Declaration of 1993 allowed Sinn Féin, a political party associated with the IRA, to participate in all-party peace negotiations on condition that the IRA called a ceasefire. The IRA called a ceasefire on 31 August 1994. John Major&#x27;s government, dependent on Ulster Unionist Party votes, then began insisting that the IRA must fully disarm before there could be any all-party negotiations. The IRA saw this as a demand for total surrender and believed the British were unwilling to hold negotiations. It ended its ceasefire on 9 February 1996 when it detonated a powerful truck bomb in Docklands, one of the two financial districts of London. The blast killed two people and caused an estimated £150 million worth of damage. The IRA then planted five other devices in London within the space of 10 weeks.

The IRA planned to carry out a similar bombing in Manchester. The city may have been chosen because it was one of the host cities of the Euro &#x27;96 football tournament, attended by visitors and media organisations from all over Europe, guaranteeing the IRA what Margaret Thatcher called the &quot;oxygen of publicity&quot;. A Russia vs Germany match was to take place at Old Trafford in Manchester a day after the bombing. The year before, Manchester had also won its bid to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games, at the time the biggest multi-sport event ever to be staged in Britain.

On 10 June 1996, multi-party negotiations began in Belfast. Sinn Féin had been elected to take part but were barred because the IRA had not resumed its ceasefire or agreed to disarm.

==Details of the bombing==
The IRA&#x27;s South Armagh Brigade was tasked with planning and carrying out the attack. It had also been responsible for the Docklands bombing in February, and the Bishopsgate bombing in 1993. Its members mixed the explosives in the Republic of Ireland and shipped them by freight from Dublin to England. In London, the bomb was assembled and loaded into the back of a red and white Ford Cargo van. On 14 June it was driven north towards Manchester, accompanied by a burgundy Ford Granada which served as a &quot;scout car&quot;.

===Discovery===
At about 9:20 am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van was parked on Corporation Street, outside the Marks &amp; Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb&#x27;s timer, two men—wearing hooded jackets, baseball caps and sunglasses—left the vehicle and walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked them up in a Ford Granada car, which was later abandoned in Preston. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40 am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers, and a hospital.

The first policeman to arrive on the scene noticed wires running from the van&#x27;s dashboard through a hole into the back and reported that he had found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.

===Evacuation===
At 10:00 am, there were an estimated 75,000–80,000 people shopping and working in the vicinity. An evacuation of the area was undertaken by police officers from Bootle Street police station, supplemented by officers drafted into Manchester to control the football crowds. The police were helped by security guards from local shops.

One group worked to move people away from the bomb while another, assisted by firefighters and security guards, established a continuously expanding cordon around the area to prevent entry. By 11:10 am the cordon was at the greatest extent that available manpower would permit, about a quarter of a mile (400 m) from the truck and in circumference.

===Explosion===
The bomb squad arrived from their Liverpool base at 10:46 am and attempted to defuse the bomb using a remote-controlled device, but they were unable to defuse the bomb, resulting in the timer expiring and activating the device. The bomb exploded at 11:17 am, causing an estimated £700 million (£ as of ) of damage and affecting a third of the city centre&#x27;s retail space. The Marks &amp; Spencer&#x27;s and the sky bridge connecting it to the Arndale Centre were destroyed, along with neighbouring buildings. It was the largest peacetime bomb ever detonated in Great Britain, and the blast created a mushroom cloud which rose 300 metres (1,000 feet) from the ground. The explosion could be heard up to away and left a crater 15 metres wide. Glass and masonry were thrown into the air, and behind the police cordon – up to away, people were showered by falling debris. There were no fatalities, but 212 people were injured. A search of the area for casualties involved a brief confusion when mannequins blasted out of shop windows were mistaken for bodies. Hospitals across Greater Manchester were made ready to receive those injured in the blast. The police commandeered a Metrolink tram to take 50 of the casualties to North Manchester General Hospital, which treated 79 in total; a further 80 were cared for at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, and many others were treated in the streets by ambulance crews assisted by doctors and nurses who happened to be in the city centre that morning.

==Reaction==

The bombing was condemned by British Prime Minister John Major and his government, by the opposition, and by individual members of parliament (MPs) as a &quot;sickening&quot;, &quot;callous&quot; and &quot;barbaric&quot; terrorist attack. Early on, Major stated that, &quot;This explosion looks like the work of the IRA. It is the work of a few fanatics and ... causes absolute revulsion in Ireland as it does here&quot;. Sinn Féin was criticised by Taoiseach John Bruton for being &quot;struck mute&quot; on the attack in the immediate aftermath. Bruton described the bombing as &quot;a slap in the face to people who&#x27;ve been trying, against perhaps their better instincts, to give Sinn Féin a chance to show that they could persuade the IRA to reinstate the ceasefire&quot;. The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, stated he was &quot;deeply outraged by the bomb explosion&quot; and joined Bruton and Major in &quot;utterly condemning this brutal and cowardly act of terrorism&quot;. Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams, stated that he was &quot;shocked and saddened&quot; by the bombing. He insisted that his party was committed to achieving a peace settlement and argued &quot;it is sheer folly to return to the old agenda of excluding Sinn Féin and seeking to isolate republicans&quot;. On 20 June 1996, the IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing, and stated that it &quot;sincerely regretted&quot; causing injury to civilians. The IRA statement continued:
The bombing came five days after the beginning of the peace talks in Belfast, and represented the IRA&#x27;s opposition to talks which excluded republicans. The attack was part of a political strategy by the IRA to be included in negotiations on the IRA&#x27;s own terms. According to historian Richard English: &quot;What they were doing with their return to bombings like the Manchester bomb was saying, &#x27;We can still return to war if we want to. We can still put off a huge bomb in your cities and devastate them and therefore you have to deal with us.

In an effort to allay fears that Manchester&#x27;s considerable Irish community might be subjected to reprisal attacks, Councillors Richard Leese and Martin Pagel – leader and deputy leader of Manchester City Council respectively – made a public visit to the Irish World Heritage Centre in Cheetham Hill. There were ultimately only a few incidents, the most serious of which occurred on the evening of the bombing, when a gang of ten men rampaged through an Irish-themed bar in the centre of Middleton, shouting the Ulster loyalist slogan &quot;No surrender&quot; and smashing furniture and windows. Seven days after the bombing, Manchester Council held a &#x27;family fun day&#x27; in front of the Town Hall in Albert Square to encourage shoppers and visitors back into the city centre, the first of a &quot;series of events and entertainments&quot;. The Euro &#x27;96 football match between Russia and Germany at Old Trafford went ahead as planned the day following the bombing, after the stadium had been heavily guarded overnight and carefully searched; the game, which Germany won 3–0, was watched by a capacity crowd of 50,700.

==Investigation==
In an effort to trace the route of the Ford van, police examined CCTV footage from every major road and motorway taken in England within two days of the bombing. Footage revealed that the van was driven south along the M1 motorway into London on the Friday afternoon before the attack. It was seen again heading north along the motorway at 7:40 pm, accompanied by the Ford Granada. Detectives surmised that the van had been loaded with explosives in London and that the Granada was intended to be the getaway vehicle. The van was last recorded travelling east along the M62 motorway towards Manchester at 8:31 am on the morning of the explosion.

Police in Manchester were aware that their Metropolitan Police colleagues in London were investigating a suspected IRA unit based in the capital, and wondered whether the London unit was responsible for the Manchester bombing. On 15 July, Metropolitan police arrested six men suspected of IRA membership: Donal Gannon, John Crawley, Gerard Hanratty, Robert Morrow, Patrick Martin, and Francis Rafferty. Each was tried and convicted of &quot;conspiracy to cause explosions at National Grid electricity stations&quot;, and sentenced to 35 years in jail. Police in Manchester meanwhile worked to establish if the men were also responsible for the Manchester bomb.

Their investigation was led by Detective Chief Inspector Gordon Mutch of the GMP. The van&#x27;s last registered owner told police that he had sold it to a dealer in Peterborough, who had in turn sold the van on to a man calling himself Tom Fox, two weeks before the bombing. After the purchase price was delivered in cash by a taxi driver, the dealer was instructed to take the van to a nearby lorry park, and leave it there with the keys and documents hidden inside.

On checking records of telephone calls made to the dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone it appeared that the calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford van. One call was to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23 am on the morning of the bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their van in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone&#x27;s registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17 days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered enough evidence to bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.

At a meeting attended by the commander of Special Branch in Manchester, a GMP assistant chief constable and a &quot;senior officer&quot; from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), it was decided, for reasons never made public, not to present the findings of the investigation to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the body responsible for undertaking criminal prosecutions in England. The three may have felt that as the IRA suspects were already in police custody they were no longer a threat, or that to pursue the case against them may have jeopardised ongoing undercover operations. It was not until 1998 that the police finally sent their file to the CPS, who decided not to prosecute.

In September 2022, a man was arrested in connection with the bombing. According to GMP, the suspect was held at Birmingham Airport on 8 September on suspicion of terrorism offences and was interviewed by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing for the North West, before being released without charge.

===Leak===
Early in 1999, Steve Panter, chief crime reporter for the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, leaked classified Special Branch documents naming those suspected of the bombing. The documents also revealed that the man suspected of organising the attack had visited Manchester shortly after the bombing and been under covert police surveillance as he toured the devastated city centre before returning to his home in South Armagh. Suspicion fell on Mutch as the source of the leaked documents after an analysis of mobile phone records placed both him and Panter at the same hotel in Skipton, North Yorkshire, about from Manchester on the same evening.

On 21 April 1999, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; named Declan McCann as &quot;a prime suspect in the 1996 Manchester bomb plot&quot;. McCann denied involvement in the bombing in a statement given by his solicitor. The newspaper reported that the file sent by GMP to the Crown Prosecution Service contained the sentence: &quot;It is the opinion of the investigating officers of GMP that there is sufficient evidence to charge [him] with being a party in a conspiracy to cause explosions in the United Kingdom.&quot; The man denied any involvement. The Attorney General wrote in a letter to a local MP that the advice given to the CPS by an independent lawyer was that &quot;there was not a case to answer on the evidence available ... a judge would stop the case&quot;: the Attorney General further wrote that the decision not to prosecute was not influenced by the government. The newspaper also identified the six men arrested in London on 15 July as having planned the attack. By July 2000, all six had been released under the terms of the 1998 Belfast Agreement.

Up until September 2022, Panter and Mutch were the only people to have been arrested in connection with the bombing. Mutch was tried for &quot;misconduct in a public office&quot; during an 11-day trial held in January 2002 but was acquitted. During the trial, Panter was found in contempt of court for refusing to reveal his source, an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment without the right of appeal. GMP announced in 2006 that there was no realistic chance of convicting those responsible for the bombing.

==Reconstruction==
About twelve buildings in the immediate vicinity of the explosion were severely damaged. Overall, of retail space and of office space were put out of use. Insurers paid out £411 million (£ as of ) in damages for what was at the time one of the most expensive man-made disasters ever, and there was considerable under-insurance. Victims of the bombing received a total of £1,145,971 in compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority; one individual received £146,524, the largest amount awarded as a result of this incident.

According to Home Office statistics, an estimated 400 businesses within half a mile (0.8 km) of the blast were affected, 40% of which did not recover. The heaviest damage was sustained by the three buildings nearest the bomb: Michael House, comprising a Marks &amp; Spencer store and a six-storey office block; Longridge House, offices for Royal and Sun Alliance, an insurance company; and the Arndale Centre, a shopping mall. Michael House was deemed beyond economic repair and demolished. Marks &amp; Spencer took the opportunity to acquire and demolish the adjacent Longridge House, using the enlarged site for the world&#x27;s biggest branch of the store. The company&#x27;s fortunes changed during construction, and Selfridges subsequently co-occupied the building; Marks &amp; Spencer leased part of the Lewis&#x27;s store in the interim. The frontage of the Arndale was badly damaged and was remodelled when this area of the city centre was redeveloped.
The glass domes of the Corn Exchange and the Royal Exchange were blown in. The landlord of the Corn Exchange invoked a &quot;force majeure&quot; condition in the lease to evict all tenants, and the building was converted into a shopping centre. The dome of the Royal Exchange shifted in the blast; its reconstruction took two and a half years and cost £32 million, paid for by the National Lottery.

The possibility of rebuilding parts of the city centre was raised within days of the bomb. On 26 June 1996, Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister, announced an international competition for designs of the redevelopment of the bomb-affected area. Bids were received from 27 entrants, five of whom were invited to submit designs in a second round. It was announced on 5 November 1996 that the winning design was by a consortium headed by EDAW.

===Subsequent redevelopment===

Much of the 1960s redevelopment of Manchester&#x27;s city centre was unpopular with residents. Market Street, near the explosion and at that time the second-busiest shopping street in the UK, was considered by some commentators a &quot;fearful&quot; place, to be &quot;avoided like the plague&quot;. Until Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s third consecutive election victory in 1987, the staunchly Labour-controlled Manchester Council believed that Manchester&#x27;s regeneration should be funded solely by public money, despite the government&#x27;s insistence on only funding schemes with a significant element of private investment. Graham Stringer, leader of Manchester City Council, later admitted that after the 1987 General Election result &quot;there was no get out of jail card. We had gambled on Labour winning the General Election and we lost.&quot; Thatcher&#x27;s victory effectively put paid to Manchester&#x27;s &quot;socialist experiment&quot;, and Stringer shortly afterwards wrote a letter of capitulation to Nicholas Ridley, then Secretary of State for the Environment, saying, &quot;in a nutshell; OK, you win, we&#x27;d like to work together with you&quot;.

Efforts at improvement before the bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre – the exterior of which was widely unloved – from the rest of the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that &quot;the bomb was the best thing that ever happened to Manchester&quot;, as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that &quot;I take exception to his [Rooney&#x27;s] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb was the best thing to happen to Manchester&quot;. Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. &quot;The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann&#x27;s Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we&#x27;ve got nothing to touch that in Manchester&quot;. Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying &quot;people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That&#x27;s rubbish.&quot; There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre before the bombing, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid. Tom Bloxham, chairman of property development group Urban Splash and of the Arts Council England (North West), agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s:

==Memorials and legacy==
A pillar box that survived the blast, despite being yards from the explosion, now carries a small brass plaque recording the bombing. It was removed during construction and redevelopment work, and returned to its original spot when Corporation Street reopened. The plaque reads:

A Thanksgiving service for the &quot;Miracle of Manchester&quot; was held at Manchester Cathedral on 24 July 2002, to coincide with the arrival of the Commonwealth Games baton, attended by Queen Elizabeth II and The Duke of Edinburgh. At 11:17 am on 15 June 2006, a candle was lit at a memorial held at Manchester Cathedral to mark the tenth anniversary of the bombing.

===In popular culture===

&quot;One Man&#x27;s Fool&quot;, the closing track on Genesis&#x27; 1997 album &quot;Calling All Stations&quot;, was inspired by the bombing. Tony Banks stated in a SongFacts interview:

<text>Georg (Göran) Wahlenberg (1 October 1780 – 22 March 1851) was a Swedish naturalist. He was born in Kroppa, Värmland County.

Wahlenberg matriculated at Uppsala University in 1792, received his doctorate in Medicine in 1806, was appointed &quot;botanices demonstrator&quot; in 1814, and professor of medicine and botany in 1829, succeeding Carl Peter Thunberg. He was the last holder of the undivided chair that in the previous century had been held by Linnaeus. After his death in 1851, the chair was divided into more delimited professorships, and botany became the main duty of the borgströmian professorship, at the time held by Elias Fries.

Wahlenberg made his main work in the field of plant geography and published, among other things the &quot;Flora lapponica&quot; (1812) and other works on the plant world of northernmost Sweden. He was among the first major scholars to contribute to the plant taxonomy and geography of the High Tatras in the Habsburg monarchy where he carried out research in 1813 (he also determined mountain elevations, but some were later disproved by Ludwig Greiner). Two of the highest mountain lakes in the Tatras, now in Slovakia, are named Upper Wahlenberg Tarn (&quot;Vyšné Wahlenbergovo pleso&quot;; elevation ) and Lower Wahlenberg Tarn (&quot;Nižné Wahlenbergovo pleso&quot;; ) in his memory.

Wahlenberg was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1808.

The flowering plant genus &quot;Wahlenbergia&quot; and the crustose lichen genus &quot;Wahlenbergiella&quot; are named after him, as was a species of wood-rush: &quot;Luzula wahlenbergii&quot;. He died in Uppsala.

<doc id="1231928" wikidata="Q331511" url="?curid=1231928" title="Naskh (tafsir)">
<text>Naskh () is an Arabic word usually translated as &quot;&quot;. In tafsir, or Islamic legal exegesis, &quot;naskh&quot; recognizes that one rule might not always be suitable for every situation. In the widely recognized and &quot;classic&quot; form of &quot;naskh&quot;, one &quot;ḥukm&quot; &quot;ruling&quot; is abrogated to introduce an exception to the general rule, but the text the &quot;ḥukm&quot; is based on is not repealed.

Some examples of Islamic rulings based on &quot;naskh&quot; include a gradual ban on consumption of alcohol (originally alcohol was not banned, but Muslims were told that the bad outweighed the good in drinking) and a change in the direction of the qibla, the direction that should be faced when praying salat (originally Muslims faced Jerusalem, but this was changed to face the Kaaba in Mecca).

With few exceptions, Islamic revelations do not state &quot;which&quot; Quranic verses or hadith have been abrogated, and Muslim exegetes and jurists have disagreed over which and how many hadith and verses of the Quran are recognized as abrogated, with estimates varying from less than ten to over 500.

Other issues of disagreement include whether the Quran, the central religious text of Islam, can be abrogated by the Sunnah, the body of traditional social and legal custom and practice of the Islamic community, or vice versa — a disagreement in Sunni Islam between the Shafiʽi and Hanafi schools of fiqh; and whether verses of the Quran may be abrogated at all, instead of reinterpreted and more narrowly defined — an approach favored by a minority of scholars.

Several ayat (Quranic verses) state that some revelations have been abrogated and superseded by later revelations, and narrations from Muhammad&#x27;s companions mention abrogated verses or rulings of the religion. The principle of abrogation of an older verse by a new verse in the Quran, or within the hadiths is an accepted principle of all four Sunni madhāhib, or schools of fiqh, and was an established principle in Sharia by at least the 9th century. Starting in the 19th century, modernist and Islamist scholars have argued against the concept of &quot;naskh&quot;, defending the absolute validity of the Quran.

An abrogated text or ruling is called &quot;mansūkh&quot;, and the text or ruling which abrogates it is called &quot;nāsikh&quot;.

== Definition and etymology ==

In the Arabic language, &quot;naskh&quot; () can be defined as abolition, abrogation, cancellation, invalidation, copying, or transcription, according to the &quot;Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic&quot;.

As an Islamic term, there is a lack of agreement among scholars on what exactly &quot;al-Naskh&quot; is, (according to several sources). 
*According to Louay Fatoohi, &quot;the term &quot;naskh&quot; never appears in the Qur&#x27;an in the meaning it acquired in Islamic law&quot;. A detailed examination of the two Quranic verses &quot;seen by scholars as providing support to the principle of abrogation&quot;, shows that neither actually refers to &quot;the concept of abrogation&quot;.
*Israr Ahmad Khan states that those who have read &quot;the works of Abu Ubayd, al-Nahhas, Makki, Ibn al-Arabi, Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Zarkashi, al-Suyuti, and al-Dehlawi on the issue of abrogation will be confused regarding its definition&quot;.
*John Burton complains that the &quot;greatest imaginable confusion reigns as to the definition of the term &quot;naskh&quot;&quot;, and that &quot;an appalling degree of muddle&quot; surrounds the meaning of verse Q.2:106 — &quot;the Abrogation verse&quot;. And that &quot;the constant confusion of &#x27;suppression&#x27; with &#x27;supersession&#x27;&quot; causes the reader &quot;endless difficulty&quot;.
*Ahmad Ali Al-Imam states &quot;most scholars ... differ on many points&quot;, of naskh, &quot;particularly on its meaning, modes, and examples&quot;.

Disputes over what defines &quot;naskh&quot; include 
*whether the &quot;wording&quot; of the Quran can be abrogated while the &quot;ruling&quot; based on it is not (most scholars believe the ruling must be abrogated also), 
*whether a verse in the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; can abrogate a ruling in the &quot;Sunnah&quot;, and
*whether any &quot;Islamic&quot; revelation may be abrogated at all, or whether when God talks about replacing revelation (in &quot;the abrogation verses&quot; of the Qur&#x27;an: Q.2:106 and Q.16:101, see below) He is referring &quot;only&quot; to revelation which came &quot;before&quot; the Quran

Another issue was how broadly naskh should be defined, with early Muslim scholars having including things that later scholars did not consider &quot;naskh&quot;, such as:
#exceptions to earlier verses,
#particularization of the meaning of a verse (known as &quot;taksees&quot;, see below), and
#clarifications of earlier verses.

Definitions of &quot;naskh&quot; given by Islamic scholars include: 
*&quot;abrogation, revocation, repeal. Theoretical tool used to resolve contradictions in Quranic verses, hadith literature, &quot;tafsir&quot; (Quranic exegesis), and &quot;usul al-fiqh&quot; (roots of law), whereby later verses (or reports or decisions) abrogate earlier ones,&quot; (Oxford Dictionary of Islam);
*an exegetical (explaining) theory of the repeal or abolition of a law for divine commands in the Quran and the Hadith, wherein the contradictory verses, within or between these Islamic scriptures, are analyzed (David S. Powers); Through &quot;Naskh&quot;, the superseding verse as well as the superseded verse(s) are determined for the purposes of formulating Sharia.
*&quot;obliteration, cancellation, transfer, suppression, suspension&quot; depending on the context, (Badshah, Naeem, et al.);
*suspension or replacement of one Sharia ruling by another with the conditions that the ruling that suspends/replaces is of a subsequent origin, and that the two rulings are enacted separately from one another, (Recep Dogan);
*removal of an Islamic command by a legally valid argument (&quot;raf al-hukm al-Shar&#x27;i bi dalil shar&#x27;i&quot;) (Al-Zurqani).

== Scriptural basis ==
===Quran===
According to non-Muslim scholar of Islam John Burton, &quot;no single verse&quot; in the Quran &quot;unequivocally points to the naskh of any other verse&quot;, (nor does any &quot;irreproachable&quot; hadith identify &quot;any one verse as having either undergone or effected naskh&quot;). Islamic Modernist mufti Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905) also stated &quot;the Quran nowhere announced that verse so-and-so is &quot;naskh&quot;, or that verse such-and-such is &quot;mansukh&quot;.&quot;

Many of the verses believed to indicate the principle of naskh do not contain any form of the word &quot;naskh&quot;, i.e. any word with the triconsonantal root n-s-kh. Instead, they use &quot;in place of&quot; (&quot;baddal&quot;), &quot;efface&quot; (&quot;yamhua&quot;), &quot;withdraw&quot; (&quot;nadhhabanna&quot; لَنَذْهَبَنَّ), or &quot;forget&quot; (&quot;tansha&quot; تَنسَىٰٓ) which are all interpreted to refer to the process of &quot;naskh&quot;:
* 
*

Of the four verses within the Qur&#x27;an that &quot;do&quot; contain some form of the word &quot;naskh&quot; — verses Q.7:154, Q.45:29, Q.22:52, and Q.2:106 — in two cases the word has nothing to do with abrogation of divine revelation, but is used in the context of texts and scribal activity: 
*—and 
The two verse that do involve abrogation are
*, a verse allegedly referring to the Satanic Verse(s), (see below) and
*, which is called a &quot;Verse of abrogation&quot;.

==== Verses of abrogation ====
Q2:106 and Q16:101 are the two &quot;verses of abrogation&quot; contained in the Quran.

They establish the principle in Islam that an older divine revelation may be abrogated and substituted with another one, 
a principle that has been historically accepted and applied by vast majority of Islamic jurists of both the Quran and the Sunnah.

Only Q.2:106 uses a form of the word &quot;naskh&quot; (specifically &quot;nanskh&quot; meaning &quot;we abrogate&quot;).
Although there &quot;are no less than a dozen&quot; readings/interpretations of verse Q.2:106 (according to Khaleel Mohammed citing John Burton), the &quot;majority of exegetes&quot; (scholars of the interpretation of the Quran), find 2:106 indicative of two varieties of abrogation (see below):
*&quot;supersession&quot;, i.e. the &quot;suspension&quot; and replacement of the old verse without its elimination (process known as &quot;naskh al-hukm duna al-tilawa&quot;, or &quot;ibdāl&quot; in Arabic)&quot; or
*&quot;suppression&quot;, i.e. the nullification/elimination of the old verse from the &quot;Mus&#x27;haf&quot; (the written Quran compiled after Muhammad&#x27;s death) (process known as &quot;naskh al-hukm wa-&#x27;l-tilawa&quot;, or &quot;ibtāl&quot; in Arabic).

Two verse also suggest abrogation can refer to either these two meanings,
*—suggests naskh is supersession/substitution (&quot;tabdīl&quot;, related to &quot;ibdāl&quot;).
*—refers &quot;solely to eradication or nullification&quot; according to scholar Al-Fakhr al-Razi.
In addition, traditional non-religious Arabic sayings, poetry, etc. used to determine the meaning of Quranic terms also suggest abrogation means either suppression or supersession.

The verse Q.16:101 was employed by the founder of the Shafi&#x27;i school of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence — Imam Shafi&#x27;i — as proof that a Qur&#x27;anic verse can only be abrogated by another Qur&#x27;anic verse. (see below)

;Dissenting views

Orthodox/pro-naskh scholars (like Ali b. Muhammad b. Ibrahim &#x27;Ala al-Din, known as al-Khazin) argues that Abrogation Verse 2:106 was revealed in response to allegations by unbelievers in Mecca &quot;that Muhammad decides a ruling, then abrogates it!&quot;. However, according to Mohammed al-Ghazali this explanation cannot be true because the verse was revealed in Mecca where at the time &quot;no such laws&quot; were being abrogated. 
Another argument against the orthodox interpretation of the verse is that the word translated as &quot;revelation&quot; (&quot;ayah&quot;) in the two Verses of Abrogation is ambiguous, and what is abrogated may be something other than a verse in the Quran. &quot;Ayah&quot; is more accurately translated (according to Khaleel Mohammed) as &quot;sign&quot; — as in a sign &quot;sent down by God to guide humankind to Him&quot; — revelation being only one kind of sign.

==== Satanic verses and abrogation ====

The one other Quranic verse using &quot;naskh&quot; in sense of abrogation is Q22:52.

This verse is cited by historian and exegete Tabarī in connection with the incident of the so-called &quot;Satanic Verses&quot;. Tabarī&#x27;s interpretation (&quot;Tafsīr&quot;) states that God removed some of the early verses that the devil had cast into the Quran (making worship of other deities permissible) and replaced them in later verses.
It supports an interpretation of &quot;naskh&quot; as eradication (&quot;izāla&quot;) so as not to be found in the written Quran (&quot;Mus&#x27;haf&quot;) and thus made acceptable the idea of &quot;naskh&quot; as the nullification of a verse and ruling — &quot;naskh al-hukm wa-&#x27;l-tilāwa&quot; — without any (immediate) replacement.
Ibn Taymiyyah also identified &quot;something that Satan has managed to insinuate into Revelation through Prophetic error&quot; is naskh-ed by a divine verse, (which he calls &quot;al-naw&#x27; al-ikharmin al-naskh&quot;).

But later exegetes such as Makkī insist that since the verse was insinuated by the Devil into the Prophet&#x27;s recital, and not revealed by God, that verse Q.22:52 only provides for establishes the Islamic legitimacy of the concept of &quot;naskh&quot; for satanic not divine revelation. According to the current orthodox interpretation, the verses were actually a fabrication by Quraysh tribesmen and enemies of Muhammad. However &quot;a number&quot; of classical scholars like Musa b. &#x27;Uqbah, Ibn Ishaq, Abu Ma&#x27;shar, al-Tabari, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Mardawayh and Ibn Hajar al-&#x27;Asqalam have accepted the report about this episode as genuine&quot; (according to Ahmad Hasan), based on the &quot;isnad&quot; (chain of transmitters of the report), other eminent classical scholars reject the report which if it were true would mean &quot;that Satan could tamper with the Divine Revelation&quot;.

===Sunnah/hadith===
==== Hadith/commentary abrogating Quranic verses ====
Evidence for the abrogation (or not) of Quranic verses comes from collections of hadith, and tafsir.
Eight hadith in Sahih Bukhari mentions abrogation: 
*the abrogation of the direction of prayer (the changing of the Qibla from Jerusalem to the Ka&#x27;ba—at Mecca)
*the abrogation is denied in #4505, but this is contradicted in #4506, and #4507.
*, which is supposed to have been abrogated by , is referred to in #4530, and in #4531. Yet other scholars say it wasn&#x27;t abrogated since is mandatory mourning period without remarrying after her husband dies while is that inheritors don&#x27;t force her out of her husband&#x27;s house for a year unless she wanted to leave, which is why it says &quot;then no blame on the guardians&quot;.
*that is abrogated is mentioned in #4545, and #4546.

Several hadith in Sahih Muslim mention abrogation of Quranic verses, including.
*the abrogation of by in #125.

Three verses in Sunan Abu Dawood, two verses in Malik&#x27;s &quot;Muwatta&quot; and two verses in Tafsir ibn Kathir mention abrogation.

;Abrogation of Hadith 
As for abrogation of sunnah/hadith, there is no equivalent to the Quranic &quot;Verses of abrogation&quot; in the sunnah. No &quot;generally accepted statements can be adduced from the sunnah to vindicate the application of the theory to Sunnah texts&quot;, according to John Burton.
However scholars state that hadith were abrogated just as the Quran was. &quot;Kitab al-I&#x27;tibar&quot; states that early Muslim Urwah ibn Zubayr declared, &quot;I testify that my father told me that the Prophet would make a statement, then subsequently replace in with another statement, just as the Quran, in certain places, supersedes other parts.&quot; Abu al-&#x27;Ala&#x27; ibn al-Shikhkhir (d. 107/725),
a &quot;Tabi&#x27;i&quot;, (i.e. one of the generation of Muslims who followed the &quot;Sahaba&quot; -- the companions of Muhammad) is reported to have said much the same thing according to a Sahih Muslim hadith.

== History ==
In &quot;general terms&quot;, the idea of a divine process whereby the decisions of a monotheist God can be superseded by His later decisions precedes &quot;even the foundation of Islam itself,&quot; (according to John Burton), being found in &quot;Epistle to the Hebrews&quot; 8:13; 10:9 of the New Testament.

While Muhammad is reported to have abrogated parts of the sunnah by &quot;explicit abrogation&quot; (see below), there are no reports of him talking about abrogated verses in the Quran or explaining any theory of abrogation. Thus the classical theory of naskh &quot;cannot go back to the Prophet&quot;. This is an argument against the theory according to its opponents — &quot;it is inconceivable that the Prophet had left such an important problem to the discretion of the people ...&quot;

;Reports of companions emphasizing its importance
There are, however, introductory stories in almost all classical &quot;naskh&quot; works about how (younger) companions of Muhammad — some of his &quot;oldest and most determined supporters&quot; revered by pious Muslims — emphasized the importance of belief in and knowledge of the theory of naskh.
Many recount an incident where a Kufan preacher is banned from expounding the Quran on account of his ignorance of the principles of &quot;naskh&quot; by an early &quot;&#x27;ilmic&quot; authority figure (usually Rashidun Caliph &#x27;Alī, but sometimes also Ibn &#x27;Abbās, cousin of Muhammad and hadith narrator).

In one report Ali told a judge who had no knowledge of nasikh that he was &quot;deluded and misleading others&quot;, in another he evicted a preacher from a mosque for being ignorant of the science of abrogation. Umar is reported to have told Muslims that despite the fact that Ubay ibn Ka&#x27;b was &quot;the best Quranic expert among us ... we ignore some of what&quot; he says because he disregarded abrogation and told others he refused to &quot;abandon anything I heard from the Messenger of Allah&quot;.

Another set of Hadith emphasize how those who speak publicly on &quot;fiqh&quot; (Islamic law) without expert knowledge in naskh not only endanger their own immortal souls but also the souls of those who listening to them.

Some (John Burton) have questioned the authenticity of these hadith, finding them suspiciously convenient for proponents of naskh and especially for experts in the field. (Not only do they provide validity for the theory from &quot;the mouths of men believed to have known the Prophet&#x27;s mind best&quot;, but the reports specifically call for judicial or religious offices in the community to be occupied by those trained in &quot;this indispensable knowledge&quot;.)

;Early reliable evidence
However even if these reports were later fabrications and the rules of naskh were not directly passed down from Muhammad to the Salaf Muslims, it is known that the &quot;idea&quot; that some Qur&#x27;anic verses were abrogated can be found towards the end of the first century of Islam, and the development of &quot;theories&quot; of naskh can be dated &quot;with certainty&quot; to the time of Imam Shafi&#x27;i (d. 204 AH).

The early schools of law that were in existence towards the end of the first century of Islam included the idea of abrogation in the Qur&#x27;anic verses. Ibrahim al-Nakha&#x27;i (d. 96 AH/714) is reported to have said that the part of verse Q.5:106 — which allows a non-Muslim to bear witness to the bequest of a Muslim during a journey if the Muslim is on their death bed — was abrogated to require the witness to be a Muslim.

The principle of abrogation (without its &quot;naskh&quot; terminology) makes an early appearance in the &quot;Muwatta&#x27;&quot; of Mālik (d.179 AH/795 ) according to John Burton and Ahmad Hasan. At one point Malik notes that &quot;his teacher Zuhrī had told him that the Muslims had adopted as standard the latest of all the Prophet&#x27;s reported actions&quot; when there is a conflict. In another chapter Mālik states that of the two conflicting Qur&#x27;an rulings, &quot;one had replaced the other&quot;. Elsewhere, Mālik &quot;rejects the notion that a ruling remains valid despite the withdrawal&quot; of the (supposed) Qur&#x27;an verse the ruling is based on.

However, according to Abdul-Rahim, &quot;the earliest extant materials ever written&quot; on the &quot;tafsir&quot; genre, naskh al-Qur&#x27;an came earlier than Malik. The two works — &quot;Kitab al-Nasikh wa al-Mansukh fi Kitab Allah Ta&#x27;ala&quot; by Qatadah ibn Di&#x27;amah al-Sadusi (d. 117/735) and &quot;Kitab al-Nasikh wa al-Mansukh&quot; by Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn Shihab al-Zuhri (d. 124/742). — begin &quot;immediately to point to the abrogated in the Qur&#x27;an&quot; feeling no need to elucidate what naskh is. According to Abdul-Rahim, the fact that these and other early works followed this practice indicates a &quot;widespread understanding of naskh&quot; in the Muslim world at that time.

;Meaning
&quot;Naskh&quot; meaning evolved as early applications of the concept were abandoned (like other technical terms within Islamic exegesis — such as &quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;, the historical context in which Quranic verses were revealed). In early works of &quot;tafsīr&quot; (before about 150 AH), &quot;Naskh&quot; was used to refer to a ruling that narrowed rather than replaced an earlier one (&quot;nasakha min [al-āya]&quot; — &quot;an exception is provided to [the verse]&quot;). This usage was later reformulated by Shāfi&#x27;ī as &quot;takhsīs&quot; (specification/exception).

;Theory
The &quot;elaboration of the theories&quot; of naskh can be dated with certainty to the last half of the second century of Islam, when Imam Shafi&#x27;i (d.204 AH/820), in his work &quot;Risāla&quot;, (and in the somewhat later &quot;Ikhtilāf al-Hadīth&quot;&quot;) worked to resolve the &quot;apparent discrepancies between certain Qur&#x27;ānic verses and others; between certain &quot;hadith&quot; and others; and, most serious of all, between certain Qur&#x27;ānic verses and certain &quot;hadīths&quot;&quot;, according to John Burton. Ibrahim al-Nakha&#x27;i (d. 96/714) is reported to have said that verse Q.5:106 was abrogated &quot;Naskh&quot; as &quot;a technical term meaning &#x27;abrogation&#x27;&quot; was used &quot;early on in exegesis, for example, in Muqātil&#x27;s [d. 149-150] &quot;Khams mi&#x27;a āya&quot; and his &quot;tafsīr&quot;. Ilm al-Nasikh wa&#x27;l-Mansukh&quot; (Knowledge of the Abrogating and Abrogated) became one of the Islamic sciences.

John Burton argues, naskh become more important following the establishment of the principle of As-Shafi&#x27;i that hadith of Muhammad overruled all other reports from Companions or others on the same subject. This doctrine led to the growth in hadith attributed to the Prophet. Since &quot;far too many&quot; of these hadith &quot;were mutually contradictory&quot;—some contradicting the Quran -- &quot;their use might court the risk&quot; of failing to follow divine law (the view of some of the Mu&#x27;tazila of the era). For proponents of the As-Shafi&#x27;i doctrine a practical problem was the contradictions would lead to an abandonment of basing Islamic law on prophetic hadith.

;Medieval times
At least by the eleventh century the classical concept of naskh of the Quran and Sunnah was widely accepted enough for one scholar — Ibn Hilal al-Nahwi — to assert that &quot;whoever says&quot; that there is no abrogation in Islam &quot;is not a believer, but rather a &quot;kafir&quot;, denying that with which Muhammad came. He must renounce his position or be killed&quot;.

;Modernist dissent
A &quot;celebrated icon&quot; of deniers and rejecters of naskh was the fourth-century Hijri scholar, Abu Muslim al-Isfahani, who was very much in the minority and whose work on naskh &quot;Jami&#x27;al-Ta&#x27;wil&quot; (al-Amidi, al-Ihkam, v.3, 115), has been lost to history. But &quot;concentrated criticism of the abrogation concept only started in the latter part&quot; of the nineteenth century, according to Khaleel Mohammad. According to Karel Steenbrink, &quot;most&quot; of the modernist or reformist scholars of that era (Muhammad Abduh, Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan, and Rashid Rida), considered the theory of abrogation of the Quran invalid. Muhammad al-Ghazali, writing in 1992, stated 
&quot;the position taken by all the modern scholars whom I have met, or listened to, or whose works I have read, is contrary to the understanding of naskh that became so widespread among the later exegetes, namely that there exists naskh (if accepted) as meaning the abrogation of verses of the Qur&#x27;an.&quot;

Two lesser known scholars who wrote work and spoke against naskh of Islamic revelation in more depth in the 20th century were Muhammad Amin (an Azhar graduate, active at the beginning of the 20th century), and &#x27;Abd al-Muta&#x27;al al-Jabri (who wrote his Master&#x27;s thesis—entitled &quot;Naskh As I Understand It In The Islamic Shari&#x27;ah&quot;—at the University of Cairo in 1949).

== Need and scope==
===Dealing with apparent contradictions===

Islam teaches that the Quran was revealed to Muhammad over 23 years (609–632 CE) until the year of his death. The customs and practices of Muhammad over this same period are known as the Sunnah, and reports of them are known as ahadith. From early in Islam&#x27;s history, some scholars thought that contradictory commands existed in the Quran, among hadith of the Sunnah, as well as between verses of the Quran and the hadith.

Since Islam calls on humanity to obey the Quran and imitate the behavior of the prophet, and also because &quot;a defining claim of Sunni Islam&quot; is that no two authentic hadith could contradict each other or the Quran, (and because some verses in the Quran at least seemed to contradict each other) scholars worked to resolve these apparent contradictions in the verses that give regulations to Muslims. This became especially important, (as mentioned above), after the principle of fiqh was established that in forming Islamic law, hadith attributed to Muhammad overruled those attributed to all other early Muslims on the same issue. This led to the growth in the number of these hadith and contradictions between them, created a danger to their legitimacy as the basis of sharia law.

While hadith tell of rules of naskh being passed down directly from Muhammad&#x27;s closest Companions (sahabah) and future Muslim leaders — others believe it more likely ideas about naskh originated later. Ahman Hasan speculates that the idea of the abrogation of certain Qur&#x27;anic verses &quot;emerged&quot; early in the history of Islam when commentators and the jurisconsults seeking to reconcile the &quot;apparently contradictory verses&quot;, looked to the Quranic verses such as Q.16:101 — &quot;... We put a revelation in place of (another) revelation ...&quot; — to develop a theory that some later verses replaced the commands of earlier ones. John Burton argues that naskh was first employed by Islamic scholars (&quot;usulis&quot;) in the second century of Islam working to develop principles (&quot;usul al-fiqh&quot;) for the Islamic law (fiqh) and seeking to explain why some fiqh rulings were not founded on Quranic/Sunnah revelation. By this time the Islamic empire spanned three continents and fiqh had been established in the different regions but usulis found rulings in certain verses of the Quran and parts of the Sunnah had been ignored in their formulation. To explain this, Burton argues, they developed the concept of naskh to declare that the verses/parts had been abrogated.

In theory, &quot;naskh&quot; formed part of a hierarchy of techniques used by scholars of Islamic law working with hadith. Scholars first strove to &quot;harmonize&quot; hadith, (i.e. to make them fit together by reinterpreting them). If that failed they would look for signs of abrogation (that one saying/doing/inaction by Muhammad was earlier than the other and had been replaced by the later saying/doing/inaction). If there was no opportunity for abrogation, they would check the &quot;isnad&quot;—chains of transmission of the hadith—to see if the transmission of one hadith was superior to another. Finally, if they found no difference in the &quot;isnad&quot;, they would approve the hadith they found &quot;closest to the overall message of the Quran and Sunnah&quot;.

;Problem
But according to scholars such as David S. Powers and John Burton, while the doctrine of abrogation may have cleared up contradictions, it &quot;poses a difficult theological problem&quot; because it seems to suggest God was changing His mind, or has realized something He was unaware of when revealing the original verse. For an eternally all-knowing deity this was theologically impossible and logically absurd — in fact an act of &quot;unbelief&quot; in Islam itself. Also foreclosing on the possibility of any improvisation of Quranic verses was the belief of Sunni scholars that the Quran was not written/spoken during the course of its revelation, in fact not even created/written by God, but is as ageless as God himself, &quot;uncreated&quot;, an &quot;attribute&quot; of God (like being all-powerful, beneficent, merciful, etc.), its original copy being the &quot;mother of the book&quot; — &quot;umm al-kitab&quot; — kept in the presence of God (Q.13:39; Q.43:4), the earthly Quran being only a copy of it. (The Mu&#x27;tazila argued that the Qur&#x27;an could not be both eternal and subject to abrogation, with a new verse abrogating an earlier one.)

Skeptics such as Ali Dashti found the naskh process suspiciously similar to the human process of &quot;revising ... past decisions or plans&quot; after &quot;learning from experience and recognising mistakes&quot;. When the Quran defends abrogation/naskh against those who scoffed at it (&quot;Do not you know that Allah over every thing?&quot; Q.2:106; &quot;they say, &quot;Thou art but a forger&quot; ... Allah knows best what He reveals&quot; Q.16:101), Dashti asks if the &quot;scoffers&quot; were suspicious &quot;precisely because God is capable of everything&quot;, and so would have no need to abrogate a verse after revealing it.

Roslan Abdul-Rahim points out that after a verse was revealed criticizing Muslim slackers and urging Muslims to fight jihad, a blind Muslim (&#x27;Abd Allah ibn Umm Maktum) protested to Muhammad that his eyesight prevented him from fighting. &quot;Almost instantaneously&quot; another verse was sent down amending the first with the qualifier &quot;except the disabled&quot;. 

===Rationale===
At least in part in answer to these criticisms, some explanations and defenses have been offered for the theory of abrogation — principally that the revising of commands by God to his creatures is all done according to a plan.:
*aspects of the Quran&#x27;s message and the Prophet&#x27;s teachings had to change as circumstances changed in the Muslim community encountered over the course of Muhammad&#x27;s more than two decade term as prophet
**&quot;one rule might not always be suitable for every situation. Far from Allah changing his mind, abrogation demonstrates the wisdom of Allah in legislating rules for their appropriate time and context. For most rules in Islam, there exist circumstances that warrant an exception to the rule.&quot; (Abu Amina Elias)
**Rather than a way for scholars to deal with contradictions in scripture, preachers argued that &quot;naskh&quot; was God&#x27;s way of dealing with different situations the Muslim community encountered over the course of Muhammad&#x27;s more than two decade term as prophet. It &quot;was quite possible for something to be beneficial for them in one situation, and detrimental in another&quot;, (such as fasting during Ramadan, where eating is allowed at night, but forbidden in the day), so that God might well abrogate something after it was no longer beneficial. (Ibn Qudamah)
**&quot;Islam abrogates all previous codes of which it is the perfection — If contemporary law is subject to constant alteration to meet changing conditions, why is it impossible that laws given to one people at one time should be abrogated elsewhere at another time?&quot; (Al-Shahrastani)
**&quot;Naskh&quot; an expression of &quot;the notion that aspects of the Quran&#x27;s message and the Prophet&#x27;s teachings developed over time&quot;. (Or, since God is all knowing, &quot;naskh&quot; was said to be what happened when the expiration points were reached for of those rulings God intended as temporary all along.) (J.A.C. Brown)
**God &quot;knows the temporariness or permanence of any ruling from the time He issues it.&quot; (Louay Fatoohi)
*Major changes in behavior called for by Islam (banning of consumption of alcohol) should be abolished gradually, meaning that the early lenient commands are abrogated by later stricter ones — demonstrating that this abrogation was pre-planned, not the correction of a mistake;
*Alternately naskh provides &quot;takhfīf&quot; (lightening), abrogation &quot;was generally directed to making things easier&quot;, (al-Suyuti) either by introducing a more lenient rule—or if introducing a more onerous one, helping believers by giving them the opportunity to earn greater reward in the Hereafter by obeying the challenging rule.
*Verses are abrogated to replace them with something that will improve human welfare. (Al-Zamakhshari)
*The &#x27;style&#x27; of Divine revelation is &quot;direct and absolute&quot;, without &quot;clauses, exceptions and qualification&quot;. This makes necessary the occasional modification of these broad commands with &quot;more specific&quot; meanings, which is &quot;generally&quot; what &quot;naskh&quot; does. (Cyril Glasse)
*It serves a way for God to test the obedience of believers, who may be troubled and confused that God changed divine law to declares something good that at one time was denounced as evil and vice versa. (Ibn Kathir)
*Finally, the question &quot;why?&quot; itself is out of line.
**&quot;abrogation as a mechanism that perfectly reflects God&#x27;s omnipotence. God can change any ruling with another at any point in time He sees fit&quot; (Louay Fatoohi);
**&quot;God orders men&#x27;s actions as He pleases and must not be asked what He is doing&quot; (Al-Shahrastani);
**&quot;The sound mind does not deny that there could be a Naskh in Allah&#x27;s commandments, for He decides what He wills, just as He does what He wills&quot; (Ibn Kathir).

====Alcohol====
:see:&quot;Khamr#Scriptural basis&quot;

The &quot;classical&quot; and oft cited example of how naskh was used in stages to guide a major change in the behavior of the faithful was the banning of alcohol, implemented in three verses. It has been described as an act of wisdom, needed because an abrupt total ban would have been too harsh and impractical. &quot;Arab society in the beginning was not ready to abandon drinking alcohol. They needed to strengthen their faith in order to overcome their desire to drink.&quot;

The first verse gently discouraged Muslims from drinking alcohol:

The second prohibited Muslims from being drunk during one kind of activity—praying salat:

And finally, once Muslim were &quot;ready for it&quot;, alcohol (along with gambling) was totally prohibited:

====Ratio of enemy warriors to Muslims====
Two verses Imam Al-Shafi&#x27;i cites as &quot;the clearest evidence&quot; for naskh concern the number of enemies each Muslim warrior is expected to vanquish. (Unlike with those concerning alcohol, the abrogating verse is more lenient not more strict.)
A verse calling for overcoming ten unbelievers
... is abrogated by one reducing the number of enemy Muslims are expected to fight to only two:

Another example of this &quot;takhfīf&quot; (lightening) is lifting the burden of lengthy nocturnal prayers in that had been required by .

====The Sword verse(s)====
A verse(s) of major importance in Muslim-non-Muslim relations is the &quot;Sword verse&quot; (as, to a lesser extent, are similar verses such as ).
Among &quot;medieval exegetes and jurists&quot; there was &quot;a broad consensus that and abrogated &quot;all the other statements&quot; in the Quran &quot;on the issue of waging war&quot;.

In modern times, the sword verse has been used by extremist groups and individuals to justify their killing of non-Muslims civilians, according to Lohay Fatoohi (although some dispute this), and Mahfuh Halimi argues extremist advocates of violence maintain the verse of the sword Q.9:5 abrogates &quot;more than a hundred&quot; verses of the Quran advising or advocating &quot;peace, coexistence, patience, tolerance, and forgiveness as the basis for relations between Muslims and non-Muslims.&quot; Critics have called this a case of passages called for killing abrogating ones calling for tolerance. and a classic example of determining the validity of a verse by determining when it was revealed.

Verses counseling patience and forbearance that are said to be abrogated by 9:5 (according to Fatoohi) include:
*
Similarly verse Q.9:29 is considered by Nahhās &quot;to have abrogated virtually all verses calling for patience or forgiveness toward the People of the Book&quot; (according to Reuven Firestone). (The verse abrogates more early verses of the Quran than any other according to some Muslim Islamic scholars, while others have concluded it does not abrogate any verses.
====Length of the period (&quot;`iddah&quot;) widows must wait before remarrying====

This abrogation has been called a classic&#x27; instance&quot; of the classic&#x27; mode&quot; of naskh by Usulis (i.e. students/scholars of the principles of fiqh) that &#x27;proves&#x27; &quot;&quot;the fact&quot; of Naskh&quot;. It (is thought to have) shortened the &quot;`iddah&quot;, i.e. the waiting period for widows (also divorcees, but these verses refer only to widows) before re-marriage, from one year ...
... to four months and ten days: 

But Q.2:240 makes no mention of a waiting period before marriage, but only financial provisions (&quot;maintenance and residence&quot;, aka &quot;matāʿ&quot;) for widows. And other scholars say it wasn&#x27;t abrogated since Q.2:234 is about the mandatory mourning period for a woman without remarrying after her husband dies while Q.2:240 is that inheritors don&#x27;t force her out of her husband&#x27;s house for a year unless she wanted to leave, which is why it says &quot;then no blame on the guardians&quot;. This &quot;did&quot; conflict with &quot;the details of the rules to govern inheritances laboriously worked out in the fiqh&quot;, (according to non-Muslim critic and scholar John Burton). Burton argues that protecting established fiqh rulings from the contradiction of Quranic verses such as Q.2:240 (and not addressing conflicts between different lines of revelation) was what motivated the usulis who developed the theory of naskh.

====Questions raised====
In reply to the rationale of gradual introduction of the ban on alcohol, some (Farooq Ibrahim) have noted that while hadith often explain events that the Quran refers to cryptically, there is no explanation or mention of a strategy of gradual banning of alcohol consumption found in any Sahih hadith. Nor was a gradual process used in other Islamic prohibitions. The worship of multiple gods, and of having intercessors before God were both banned with no evident concern over whether they were too harsh or impractical.

Burton suggests that the idea that naskh can be explained as &quot;takhfīf&quot; (lightening) is of limited usefulness because it is applied to both naskh that make things easier for Muslims in the temporal world — like no longer requiring lengthy nocturnal prayers or lowering the number of enemies each Muslim warrior is expected to vanquish; and abrogation that makes things more difficult — for example, the extension of the ritual fast from a few days () to the entire month of Ramadan (). Here the changes are claimed to be lightening because they will help Muslims attain a greater reward in the Hereafter. Still other abrogation — such as the switching of the &quot;qibla&quot; — would seem to have no effect on the difficulty or ease for Muslims of either temporal life or the afterlife.

The doctrine (expressed here by Louay Fatoohi) that God &quot;knows the temporariness or permanence of any ruling from the time He issues it&quot;, seems hard to square with two verses mentioned above; where God promises that Muslim warriors will overcome ten times that number of unbelievers (Q.8:65), before revealing an abrogating verse — &quot;Now God has alleviated your burden, knowing that there is weakness in you,&quot; and lowering the number of unbelievers promised to be overcome to only double the number of Muslims (Q.8:66), suggesting that God abrogates after learning of an area of Muslims&#x27; weakness.

A question raised over how aspects of the Quran&#x27;s message and the Prophet&#x27;s teachings needed to change over the course of Muhammad&#x27;s mission as times/circumstances changed, was why the need for change stopped with the death of Muhammad. Muhammad Abduh (reputedly) asks why naskh was employed during the 23 years of the Quran&#x27;s revelation, but could not be employed over the next 1400+ years when social &amp; life changes were far greater.

===Limits of application===
Scholars have proposed some limits on the application of abrogation.

Naskh concerns itself with only revelations pertaining to positive laws — commandments (&quot;amr&quot;) or prohibitions (&quot;nahy&quot;).) In Tabarī&#x27;s words:

(However, according to John Burton, this was not true among &quot;some of the oldest exegetes&quot; who &quot;included indiscriminately under &quot;naskh&quot; all and every verse where they noted a degree of contradiction, however slight ...&quot;)

Naskh is applied almost exclusively to the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah. According to Mohammad Hashim Kamali, its application to &quot;Ijma`&quot; and &quot;Qiyas&quot; — secondary sources of Sunni Islamic law unlike the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah not divinely revealed — &quot;has been generally overruled&quot;, as abrogation &quot;is not relevant&quot; to &quot;Ijma&quot; (the consensus or agreement of Muslim scholars on a religious issue), and the theory of naskh &quot;has no place&quot; in &quot;Qiyas&quot; (the process of deductive analogy in Islamic scripture in order to apply a known injunction (&quot;nass&quot;) to a new circumstance and create a new injunction). Islamic jurists cannot abrogate, it is confined to the lifetime of the Prophet in the Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah.

In addition, subjects of Islam that Naskh does not apply to include:
*Attributes of God,
*Belief in the principles of the faith,
*the doctrine of Tawhid (monotheism/oneness of God)
*the doctrine of the hereafter.
*the Sharia of Islam itself
*the ulema (scholars of Islam) are also in agreement &quot;that rational matters and moral truths such as the virtue of doing justice or being good to one&#x27;s parents, are not changeable and are therefore not open to abrogation&quot;.

If these conditions are met, there are several more that must be satisfied concerning the text to be abrogated and the text abrogating:
*the two texts must be of &quot;equal strength in regard to authenticity (&quot;thubut&quot;) and meaning (&quot;dalalah&quot;)&quot; — otherwise the weaker test is over ruled;
*the two texts must be &quot;genuinely in conflict&quot; — otherwise they should be reconciled with one another;
*the two texts must be &quot;separate and are not related to one another in the sense of one being the condition (&quot;shart&quot;), qualification (&quot;wasf&quot;) or exception (&quot;istithna&quot;) to the other&quot;.

According to scholar John Burton three &quot;elements&quot; are necessary &quot;in any one alleged instance of naskh&quot;, namely:
:a) the divine origin of both injunctions;
:b) a conflict between two enactments such that it is `quite impossible to implement the two texts jointly`
:c) knowledge of the relative dates of both revelations.

Scholar Recep Dogan, gives &quot;types of evidence&quot; allowed for &quot;naskh&quot;. (These are also three in number, but only one — chronology — is the same as Burton&#x27;s &quot;necessary elements&quot;):
:a) report(s) from Muhammad or his companions,
:b) &quot;ijma&quot; (consensus of the mujtahids upon naskh), and
:c) knowledge of the chronology of the Qur&#x27;anic revelation.

Chronology

Since an abrogating verse must have been revealed after the verse it abrogates, the validity of abrogation requires a knowledge of the chronology of the primary sources.
This has historically been a difficult task because the verses in the Qur&#x27;an are not arranged by chronology but rather by size of chapters, and even within a chapter, the verses are non-chronologically arranged, so that the context of each revelation is not ascertainable from verses near a verse, or the sequential verse number. 
Verses Q.2:190, Q.2:191 and Q.2:192, for example, were revealed to Muhammad six years after the verse Q.2:193. 
Thus chronology depends on &quot;the agreement of scholars&quot; (&quot;ijma&quot;) and on &quot;Tafsir&quot; reports or the recollection of Hadith transmitters to explain which verse or prophetic statement was revealed before another.
(According to at least one non-Muslim scholar — Andrew Rippin — naskh texts in Islam have not demonstrated that verses rendered invalid by shariah law were revealed earlier, but simply assumed they must have been.)

== Types/varieties ==
===Implicit and explicit naskh ===

Most cases of naskh are &quot;implicit&quot; (&quot;dimni&quot;) — i.e. as noted above they depend on &quot;the agreement of scholars&quot; (&quot;ijma&quot;) to determine if a verse was abrogated. However, a few revelations involve &quot;explicit&quot; (&quot;sarih&quot;) naskh, specifically mentioning some earlier command to be abrogated and replaced with another — though none of them use any form of the word &quot;naskh&quot;.

*Quranic verses 2:143-50 commands Muhammad and the Muslims to turn their faces away from &#x27;the direction of prayer that you faced before&#x27; (Jerusalem) to a new one, one that &#x27;pleases your heart,&#x27; (by which is meant the &quot;Kaaba&quot; in the Al-Haram Mosque of Mecca).
*In one hadith Muhammad is reported to have said: &#x27;I had prohibited you from visiting graves, but visit them, for indeed in visiting them there is a reminder [of death].&#x27; 

===Total and partial naskh ===
Abrogation may be divided into two more types: total abrogation and partial abrogation:

;&quot;Total abrogation&quot;
In the case of &quot;total abrogation&quot; (or &quot;naskh kulli&quot;), all of the specific statement within the Quran or hadith that the ruling is based on (the &quot;nass&quot;) is abrogated by another, and a new ruling (&quot;hukm&quot;) is enacted to replace the entire old ruling. An example is found in two Qur&#x27;anic verses on the waiting period (&quot;`iddah&quot;) of widows before remarriage.
Al-Baqarah 240 has been interpreted to prescribe a waiting period of one year:
But another verse shortened the waiting period to four months and ten days:

;&quot;Partial abrogation&quot;
In the case of &quot;partial abrogation&quot; (&quot;naskh juzi&quot;), one verse is only partially abrogated by another. The part not abrogated remains operative. An example of this is the Qur&#x27;anic verse on slanderous accusations of adultery against women (known as &quot;qadhf&quot;).
The &quot;ayah of qadhf&quot; — An-Nur 4 — establishes a general rule that anyone who accuses chaste women of adultery (&quot;zina&quot;) must produce four witnesses for proof:

The &quot;ayah of imprecation&quot; (&quot;li&#x27;an&quot;) — an-Nur 6 — replaces the four witnesses requirement, but only for one kind of person — the husband of the alleged adulteress. It allowing him to pursue charges of &quot;zina&quot; against his wife provided he takes four different oaths to tell the truth and invoked the curse of God upon himself if he is telling a lie. This partially repeals Ayah Q.24:4.

;&quot;takhsees&quot;
&quot;Takhsees&quot; [&#x27;specification&#x27;, also spelled &quot;takhsis&quot;] and &quot;istithnā&quot; (exception) resemble &quot;partial naskh&quot; described above. Like partial naskh, &quot;takhsees&quot; qualifies a general ruling [&quot;aam&quot;], so that it only applies in certain cases.

Examples include 
#the qualification of the Quranic injunction in Q.5:38 to amputate the hand of the thief, the &quot;takhsees&quot; given by Muhammad requires that the thief must have stole something above a certain value.
#the qualification on entering uninhabited houses. verse Q.24:27 states: &#x27;Do not enter houses other than your houses,&#x27; but verse Q.24:29 gives an exception: &#x27;There is no blame upon you for entering houses not inhabited in which there is convenience for you.&#x27; (At-Tabari)

&quot;Takhees&quot; is sometimes called another name for partial naskh. However (according to Deen Communication Limited), &quot;Takhsees&quot; differs from naskh in that
*it may involve revelations making observations, predictions, etc., rather than laws and rulings [&quot;ahkaam&quot;];
*it need not be revealed &quot;after&quot; the verse/hadith it is qualifying; and
*need not be restricted to the Qur&quot;an or Sunnah, but may apply to &quot;ijmaa`&quot;, or &quot;qiyaas&quot; and
*may be based on common sense or &quot;ijtihaad&quot;.

===Naskh of ruling, Naskh of verse, or both===
Another set of types of naskh are those divided by what is abrogated — ruling, text, or both. (John Burton calls these the three &quot;modes&quot; of the theory of &quot;naskh&quot;.)
:1. naskh al-hukm dūna al-tilāwa, also &#x27;supersession&#x27; or &quot;ibdal&quot;. The types of naskh mentioned above involve abrogation of an Islamic regulation/ruling (&quot;hukm&quot;), but not the text it is based on. If the regulation/ruling is based on a Qur&#x27;ānic verse, that verse is still found in the &quot;Mus&#x27;haf&quot; (the written Quran). This mode of &quot;naskh&quot; — known as — has received widespread recognition, and has been called the &quot;classic&quot; mode of naskh.

But there are two other less accepted (and much less common) varieties of naskh that &quot;do&quot; abrogate text, i.e. involve revealed verses that were omitted from the text of the &quot;Mus&#x27;haf&quot;(and thus creates a distinction between the Qur&#x27;an as temporally contingent document-i.e. the &quot;mus&#x27;haf&quot;- and the Qur&#x27;an as the unity of all revelation ever sent down to Muhammed).
(These naskh do not involve Sunnah/hadith because if the wording of a hadith was deleted during the time of Muhammad, there is no way of knowing it ever existed.)

:2. naskh al-tilāwa dūna al-hukm (also &quot;naskh al-tilawah&quot; or &quot;naskh al-qira&#x27;ah&quot;), is the abrogation of the wording but not the ruling. In this mode of abrogation, Quranic text (this naskh does not apply to the Sunnah) is deleted, but the rule is a still-functional. Proof of the verse&#x27;s existence is preserved within tradition (i.e through a hadith report) as well as in the &quot;Fiqh&quot;; and 
:3. naskh al-hukm wa al-tilawah, (also known as &quot;ibtal&quot; or suppression), that is abrogation of both the verse and the ruling.

According to Ahmad Hassan, these last two types of abrogation of wording/scripture are &quot;not supported by conclusive evidence&quot;. According to John Burton, one of the two types -- #2, abrogation of the wording but not the ruling—is acknowledged &quot;only by a minority of scholars&quot;.

1. &quot;naskh al-hukm dūna al-tilāwa&quot;

Examples of verses in the written Quran (&quot;Mus&#x27;haf&quot;) that no longer provide a basis for a regulation/ruling (hukm) include most cases of abrogation mentioned above (the two cases of explicit abrogation that involved hadith being the exceptions).

Some have asked why the verses were not edited out of the &quot;mus&#x27;haf&quot; when it was compiled. Doesn&#x27;t retaining the verse run the risk of causing confusion to those inadvertently following the repealed rule? A number of rationales have been given for the practice. Tampering/doctoring with sacred texts has been rejected since medieval times — according to Liaquat Ali Khan. Al-Suyuti gives two reasons for their not being purged: 
1) it was meritorious to recite the Word of Allah, whether or not the verses had been abrogated;

...the Qur&#x27;ān was revealed so that its rulings might be known and their implementation rewarded; but... the Qur&#x27;ān is also recited with reverence, since it is the word of God, for whose recitation the pious Muslim is likewise rewarded. Further, to leave the wording, following the abrogation of the ruling was to provide for men a constant reminder of the compassion and mercy shown by their gracious Lord [&quot;ar-Rahman&quot;] Who had lightened the burden of some his previous requirements. 
2) the verses were &quot;a reminder of God&#x27;s mercy&quot;, since abrogation &quot;was generally directed to making things easier&quot;, Muslim could read them and see how their burden had been eased by God&#x27;s abrogation.

Another question raised is whether abrogating rulings (&quot;al-hukm&quot;) but not Quranic wording (&quot;al-tilawa&quot;) contradicts the verse of abrogation Q.2:106 which states &quot;any &quot;ayah&quot; We cause to be superseded or forgotten, We replace with something better or similar&quot;, and not &quot;any &quot;hukm&quot; We cause to be superseded or forgotten ...&quot; The Arabic word &quot;Ayah&quot;, is the word used in the Quran for verses in that book, although it is also used for other of God&#x27;s &quot;signs&quot;. If God intended for sharia rulings and not wording to be abrogated why wouldn&#x27;t verse Q.2:106 say so?
Tafsir scholar Tabarī ingeniously explains this problem away by noting that the faithful believe that no one part of the Quran can be &quot;superior&quot; to any other part (because the Qur&#x27;an was composed by the divine author and is &quot;Mu&#x27;jaz&quot;, or so miraculous it is impossible to imitate). However 2:106 talks of God replacing &quot;ayah&quot; &quot;with something better or similar&quot;. Since all verses of the Quran are all equally wondrous, ayah in this context cannot be referring to the words of the Quran. The principle of &quot;mu&#x27;jaz&quot;, however, does not carry over to shari&#x27;a law whose &quot;wording&quot; is not divine (those its substance is) and whose quality may vary in excellence. Thus, by process of elimination, John Burton explains, &quot;the only other thing it [&quot;ayah&quot; in Q.2:106] can refer to is the ruling derived from the verse,&quot; i.e. &quot;the rulings of the shari&#x27;a&quot;, &quot;hukm&quot;.

Still another issue was how ayah could be forgotten (&quot;cause to be forgotten&quot;) when a prophet like Muhammad was meant to be protected from flaws like forgetting. This was explained by modifying the definition of &quot;cause to be forgotten&quot; (&#x27;aw nasaha) to &quot;defer&quot; or &quot;leave&quot;.

2. &quot;naskh al-tilāwa dūna al-hukm&quot;

This form of naskh — abrogation of the wording (&quot;al-tilāwa&quot;) of some part of the Quran but not the ruling (&quot;al-hukm&quot;) based on that part — is acknowledged &quot;only by a minority of scholars&quot;.

The traditional evidence offered for it is the lack of verses for &quot;rajm&quot; [stoning adulterers], and &quot;rada&quot; [kinship from breastfeeding] in the Quran, notwithstanding the fact that both are generally accepted parts of traditional Islamic law. In the first case, a punishment of stoning to death (lapidation) for adultery is found in the Islamic law of the founders of all four surviving schools of Sunni fiqh (&quot;madhab&quot;) and by the majority of scholars of fiqh, but the penalty prescribed for adultery in the &quot;mus&#x27;haf&quot; is flogging (in Q.24:2).

An explanation for this is that a &quot;stoning verse&quot; (&quot;āyat al-rajm&quot;) was abrogated but not the ruling. (Another is that hadith calling for the stoning punishment abrogate the flogging punishment in the Quran, see below.) Muhammad&#x27;s favorite wife Ā&#x27;isha, claims that there was a stoning verse in Quran that was lost, as do other hadith.
(John Burton quotes a commentary/gloss on Aisha&#x27;s hadith describing how she might explain the abrogation of text.)

However, evidence for the existence of this verse has been criticized as weak, the hadith unreliable, and followers of Maliki and Hanafi fiqh believe evidence for stoning being the proper Islamic punishment comes not from an alleged Quranic verse but from reports of Muhammad calling for execution of adulterers by stoning found in collections of sound (&quot;sahih&quot;) hadith — meaning that the hadith on stoning abrogate the flogging verse in the Quran. Ahmad Hasan agrees that the punishment of &quot;rajm&quot; is based on the Sunnah of the prophet and argues that the wording of the Verse of Rajm found in hadith &quot;appears to be manifestly of a different style than that of the Quranic verses&quot;. He also believes that &#x27;Umar&#x27;s explanation for not including it in the &quot;mus&#x27;haf&quot; does not make sense.

Sahih al-Bukhari 6829, Book 86, Hadith 56, Hadith 816 states:
`Umar said, &quot;I am afraid that after a long time has passed, people may say, &quot;We do not find the Verses of the Rajam (stoning to death) in the Holy Book,&quot; and consequently they may go astray by leaving an obligation that Allah has revealed. Lo! I confirm that the penalty of Rajam be inflicted on him who commits illegal sexual intercourse, ...

Roslan Abdul-Rahim argues &quot;the cases of &quot;rajm&quot; [stoning], and &quot;rada&quot; [kinship from breastfeeding] do not support this form of abrogation: 
The trouble with this understanding however is, Q.2:106, the report of Ubayy questioning the Prophet, and the exchange between &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Zubayr with &#x27;Uthman ibn &#x27;Affan, all suggest that naskh is not synonymous with forgetfulness, disappearance of revelations or the exclusion of revelatory texts from the Qur&#x27;an.

(&#x27;Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, once allegedly asked &#x27;Uthman why Q.2:240 was still included in the Qur&#x27;an despite having been repealed. &#x27;Uthman reportedly answered, &quot;O my nephew, I will not change anything from it (Qur&#x27;an) from its place&quot;, suggesting abrogated verses were not deleted.)
This form of &quot;naskh&quot; also poses the question of why a verse important enough to be the basis of immutable &quot;hukm&quot; (ruling) dealing with life and death would disappear from the written Quran (&quot;mus&#x27;haf&quot;), and what scripture allows it.

Another report used to support &quot;naskh al-tilāwa dūna al-hukm&quot; — where Aisha states that a Quranic verse requiring only five suckling of a child to establish foster-parentship was abrogated but which later became the basis of a certain rule in Islamic law — is argued against by Ahmad Hasan on the grounds that rule was rejected by &quot;the ancient schools of [Islamic] law&quot;. Hasan also argues against the report that some surahs (&quot;muawwadhatdn&quot;) were not included in the &quot;mus&#x27;haf&quot; saying that &quot;certain companions&quot; heard Muhammad reciting a &quot;qunut&quot; or &quot;du&#x27;a&quot; prayer and thought it was part of the Qur&#x27;an.)

In support of this form of naskh was Al-Shafi&#x27;i, who disagreed with Maliki and Hanafi and maintained that the Sunnah cannot abrogate the Quran and the Quran cannot abrogate the Sunnah. (This left &quot;naskh al-tilāwa dūna al-hukm&quot; as the way to explain the punishment of stoning.) While Shāfi&#x27;ī never postulated the existence of a &quot;stoning verse&quot;, he did acknowledge the probability of &quot;abrogation of wording but not ruling&quot;, as well as acknowledging Aisha&#x27;s claim that there was a stoning verse in Quran, which had been lost.

3. &quot;naskh al-hukm wa-&#x27;l-tilāwa&quot;

Examples of abrogation of both ruling and wording — where a ruling is voided and its text omitted from the &quot;mus&#x27;haf&quot; so that the only evidence that it ever existed is in hadith — include the alleged &quot;Satanic Verses&quot; mentioned above, and a (much less controversial) report on how a wet nurse may become a foster parent, (specifically on how many times a wet nurse may breast-feed someone&#x27;s child before that child is forbidden to marry any of the wet nurse&#x27;s natural children. A hadith attributed to Aisha states that &quot;among the things that were revealed of the Qur&#x27;an was that ten definite breastfeedings make a person a mahram&quot;.

Liaquat Ali Khan states that &quot;very few Muslim jurists concede that any portion of the Quran has been removed&quot; through this mode of abrogation. And John Burton writes that this mode is generally acknowledged, in part due to the many alleged instances of revelation being erased:

As to how both ruling and wording were abrogated, supporters point to divine intervention into the memories of Muhammad and his companions causing them to forget a revelation.

&quot;Qur&#x27;ān-forgetting is clearly adumbrated in the Qur&#x27;ān&quot;, according to Burton, and couple of verses of the Quran talk of God taking away a revelation or causing it to be forgotten: 
* 
A number of hadith also attest to the phenomenon of forgetting revelation — some describing the forgetting as &quot;a natural failure&quot; of Muhammad&#x27;s or companions memory, and others as a &quot;miraculous intervention&quot; by God. One claims that entire suras which the Muslims had previously recited, would be discovered one morning to have been completely erased from memory.

The question of whether not just some but &quot;all&quot; abrogated verses (&quot;mansukh&quot;) were deleted from the &quot;mushaf&quot;, (meaning that contrary to scholarly consensus, there is no &quot;classic&quot; mode of naskh, no #1. &quot;naskh al-hukm dūna al-tilāwa&quot;, because nothing included in the &quot;mushaf&quot; has been abrogated, no &quot;mansukh&quot; is found there) has been raised by Roslan Abdul-Rahim.

According to Roslan Abdul-Rahim, one Bukhari hadith reports that the compiler of the &quot;mushaf&quot; himself — the third calif &quot;Uthman ibn Affan&quot; — declared that he would not &quot;shift [any verse] from its place&quot;, indicating no verses would have been excluded from the &quot;Mushaf&quot;, even if abrogated.
*Hadith. Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 6: Volume 60: Hadith 53 Ibn Az-Zubair &#x27;said to &#x27;Uthman bin &#x27;Affan (while he was collecting the Qur&#x27;an) regarding the Verse: &quot;Those of you who die and leave wives ...&quot; (2.240) &quot;This Verse was abrogated by another Verse. So why should you write it? (Or leave it in the Qur&#x27;an)?&quot; &#x27;Uthman said. &quot;O son of my brother! I will not shift anything of it from its place.

In addition, according to Abdul-Rahim, verse Q.2:106 and the report of Ubai questioning the Prophet, also suggest that naskh is not synonymous with forgetfulness of revelation. (&#x27;Abd al-Rahman b. Abza reports that on one occasion, the scribe Ubayy—noticing that Muhammad had skipped a previously recited verse -- &quot;asked if the Prophet had forgotten a verse or that it had been abrogated ...&quot;)

===Abrogation of Quran and Sunnah by one another===
Yet another way of classifying naskh is by what &quot;kind of revelation&quot; is abrogated and what kind is abrogating. 
Some scholars (a minority) believe that different types of revelation cannot abrogate each other — a part of the Sunnah can never abrogate a verse of the Quran and vice versa.
Distinguishing between which of the two kinds of revelations are involved in abrogating and in being abrogated creates four variations of &quot;naskh&quot; in this classification: 
#a ruling from a verse of the Quran is abrogated by another conflicting ruling from another verse in the Quran (almost all the examples of naskh mentioned above are this form);
#a ruling in the Sunnah is abrogated by another conflicting ruling from the hadith (the two examples of Explicit Abrogation mentioned above — visiting graves and storing sacrificial meat — are examples of this form of &quot;naskh&quot;);
#a ruling from a verse of the Quran is abrogated by a conflicting hadith (an example being the abrogation of the ayah of bequest in al-Baqarah 2:180 explained below):
#when a ruling from the Sunnah is abrogated by a conflicting ruling from a verse in the Qur&#x27;an (an example being the change in the qiblah from Jerusalem to Mecca, a Sunnah practice abrogated by Q.2:144, also explained below).

Regarding variety #3, (Sunnah abrogating the Quran), a consensus of scholars believe that Quranic verse 2:180 — the &quot;ayah of bequest&quot; in al-Baqarah:
...has been abrogated by a hadith included in Sunan Abu Dawood collection. 
*Abu Dawud, Sunan Abi Dawud 2870. &quot;... no bequest must be made to an heir.&quot;

An example of variety #4, (abrogation of part of the Sunnah by a Qur&#x27;anic verse) is found above as an example of Explicit Naskh above — namely what the &quot;qiblah&quot; (direction facing during salah prayer) should be. This direction was originally Jerusalem/Quds according to hadith included in the collection Sahih al-Bukhari (41)
*... when the Prophet first came to Madinah ... he prayed facing towards Bayt al-Maqdis for sixteen or seventeen months.&quot; (John Burton notes that there is no reference in the Quran to praying in the direction of Jerusalem.)

... was abrogated by Ayah 144 of Surah al-Baqarah:

==== Arguments on abrogation between sources====
While abrogation by the same type of revelation — i.e. varieties #1 and #2 — are accepted by all scholars (i.e. all who support the orthodox theory of abrogation), abrogation between types of revelation — #3 and #4 — are not.

The scope of Naskh doctrine between sources has been one of the major differences between the Shafi&#x27;i and Hanafi fiqhs, with Shafi&#x27;i sect of jurisprudence forbidding abrogation by the Sunnah of the Qur&#x27;ān, while Hanafi sect allowing abrogation by the Sunnah of the Qur&#x27;ān.

The Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islam maintained that a Sunnah practice from a Hadith can never abrogate a Quranic verse, (according to Yusuf Suiçmez). In contrast, the Hanafi fiqh of Sunni Islam, from the days of Abu Hanifa, along with his disciples such as Abu Yusuf, believe that Sunnah can abrogate a Quranic verse.
* 
(Q.10:15 specifically refers to the Quran and both verses uses the word &quot;ayah&quot;, which is the term used to refer to Quranic verses — although as mentioned earlier &quot;ayah&quot; is also used to refer to other &quot;signs&quot; of God.)

For Al-Shāfi&#x27;ī &quot;I merely follow what is being revealed to me&quot; in meant to that &quot;the sunnah cannot abrogate the Book&quot; but only &quot;follow what it laid down in&quot; it, (according to Yusuf Suiçmez).

Al-Shafi&#x27;i adduces Q.2:106 as &quot;categorically&quot; allowing abrogation of the Quran only by the Quran, according to Ahmad Hasan, and argues that the Quran cannot abrogate the Sunnah because if this were allowed a &quot;host of rules framed by the Prophet would be cancelled&quot;. (Stoning of adulterers would be replaced by flogging, etc.) According to another scholar, (John Burton), Al-Shafi&#x27;i argues that it is not possible for the Quran to abrogate the Sunnah because &quot;were a Sunnah to be replaced, for example by a Quran revelation, a fresh Sunnah would accompany this revelation, in order to demonstrate that the Prophet&#x27;s later Sunnah had superseded his earlier Sunnah ...&quot;, i.e. having spoken a revelation contradicting what he said or did to his companions, God&#x27;s messenger would correct what he spoke or did.

&quot;Shāfi&#x27;ī set his face decidedly against any acceptance of the idea then current that in all such cases the Qur&#x27;ān had abrogated the Sunnah, or the Sunnah the Qur&#x27;ān,&quot; Burton writes. Shafi&#x27;i insisted that &quot;... any verbal discrepancies between the Qur&#x27;ān and the reported sayings or reports of the practices of Muhammed — the Sunnah of the Prophet&quot; were illusions that &quot;could always be removed on the basis of a satisfactory understanding of the mechanism of revelation and the function of the prophet-figure&quot;.

Shafi&#x27;i&#x27;s stance was a reaction to larger developments within Islamic jurisprudence, particularly the reformulation of the &quot;fiqh&quot; away from early foreign or regional influences and toward more eminently Islamic bases such as the Quran. This assertion of Qur&#x27;anic primacy was accompanied by calls for an abandonment of the Sunnah. Shāfi&#x27;ī&#x27;s insistence upon the impossibility of contradiction between Sunnah and Qur&#x27;an can thus be seen as one component in this larger effort of rescuing the Sunnah:

According to Burton, another argument against this &quot;crossover&quot; of types of revelation in abrogation revolved around concern that unbelievers would use it to argue against the validity of Islam.
If the Sunnah &quot;naskhed&quot; the Quran, unbelievers would be able to say that &quot;Muhammad was saying or doing the opposite of what he alleged was being revealed to him by God&quot;; while if the Quran abrogated the Sunnah they could claim that &quot;God was belying the man who claimed to be His Prophet&quot;.

;Replies
One reply to these arguments against crossover of kinds of revelation in abrogation was that the Sunnah — like the Quran — &quot;had also been revealed to Muhammad&quot;, and if the Sunnah abrogated the Quran or vice versa, it was &quot;merely&quot; a matter of &quot;one element of revelation&quot; replacing &quot;another&quot;. The argument that the Sunnah/Muhammad&#x27;s actions were of divine origin/revelation was based on Quranic verse 
(The opposite point of view — that the Sunnah could not naskh the Quran was based on:) 

While for Al-Shāfi&#x27;ī, &quot;I merely follow what is being revealed to me&quot; in meant to that &quot;the sunnah cannot abrogate the Book&quot; but only &quot;follow what it laid down in&quot; it, the Hanafi jurists used that verse to justify their opinion that abrogation of the Qur&#x27;an by the life actions of Muhammad (Sunnah) was based solely on his Divine inspiration, that when he acted or said anything, any abrogation implicit through his action, of the earlier Qur&#x27;anic ruling was from Allah alone. Hanafi school stated, adds Suicmez, that to accept that &quot;a Sunnah can abrogate the Qur&#x27;an entails honoring of Muhammad&quot;.

Another argument for allowing abrogation between the Quran and the Sunnah and against the Al-Shafi&#x27;i position that Burton believes had no effective counter-argument was the issue of the penalty for adultery in Islamic law. As mentioned above this was stoning death (something widely supported by the Sunni schools of fiqh including the school of Al-Shafi&#x27;i, but this punishment was found only in the Sunnah; in the Quran, verse Q.24:2 clearly called for 100 strokes of the lash — not execution — as a penalty for adultery. The only explanation for this was that this point of Islamic law was based on abrogation of the Quran by the Sunnah.

===Abrogation of Jewish and Christian texts===
One type of abrogation over which there is little dispute among Muslims is &quot;external naskh&quot;, the abrogation of earlier Jewish and Christian religious laws handed down in the Tanakh and New Testament by Islamic revelation. 
John Burton states that it &quot;cannot be doubted&quot; that Muhammad believed this. 
A wide variety of Islamic scholars — Syed Ahmad Khan, — also states that &quot;naskh&quot; applies &quot;between religions&quot;, i.e. that the Qur&#x27;an has cancelled &quot;the laws enunciated in the earlier Divine Scriptures like the Old and the New Testaments&quot;.

=== Quantity ===

There has never been a consensus among Islamic jurists about which and how many Quranic passages (or Sunnah in the Hadiths) naskh affects. Neal Robinson sees scholars estimation of the number of abrogating verses waxing and then waning over the centuries. 
Az-Zuhri (d.742), an early authority in the subject, held that 42 ayas had been abrogated. After his time, the number steadily increased until an upper limit was reached in the eleventh century, with Ibn Salama claiming that there were 238 abrogated ayas, and al-Farisi claiming that there were 248. In subsequent generations, a reaction set in: Egyptian polymath al-Suyuti (d.1505) claimed that there were only 20, and Shah Wali Allah of Delhi (d.1762) whittled the number down to 5.
David S. Power gives a higher peak number of abrogated verses of over 550 at around the 10th century CE.
According to John Burton, the number of verses alleged to have been expunged from the &quot;mus&#x27;haf&quot; (internal naskh within the Quran or &quot; naskh al-hukm wa-&#x27;l-tilāwa&quot;) was higher—564 verses or almost 1/10 of the total content of the &quot;mus&#x27;haf&quot; 

Far smaller tallies include: 
*The 10th century scholar Abu Ja&#x27;far an-Nahaas and 16th century Islamic scholar Al-Suyuti both found only 20 cases of abrogation.
*Az-Zarqaani concludes that only 12 cases of abrogation have occurred. 
*The 18th century Muslim scholar Shah Wali Allah, have suggested that just five instances of abrogation exist in the Quran. 
*The 19th century Islamic scholar Sayyid Ahmad Khan stated that &quot;no verse of the Quran is abrogated&quot;. While himself disagreeing with them by citing the works of modern Egyptian scholars that claim that there is no Naskh at all in the Quran and that the Naskh verse came within a specific occasion, that being the changing of the Qibla, concluding that the theory grew out of desire of the Ulama to establish Fiqh rulings which they otherwise would not have been able to pass.

As mentioned above, one reason for the difference in tallies of abrogated verses comes from a confusion over the difference between &quot;naskh&quot; (abrogation) and &quot;takhsees&quot; (clarification). (An example being verse Q.8:1 which says the &quot;spoils are for Allah and His Messenger&quot;, whereas Q.8:41 says &quot;one-fifth is for Allah and His Messenger&quot;. While many scholars declared that verse Q.8:41 cancels (&quot;naskh&quot;) Q.8:1, it might be more accurate to say, Q.8:41 &quot;explains&quot; (&quot;takhsees&quot;) how much of the spoils of Q.8:1 &quot;are for Allah and His Messenger&quot;.)

Yasir Qadhi declares that calling &quot;takhsees&quot; verses &quot;naskh&quot; inflated the number of naskh verses. Similarly, Ibn Al-Qayyim and Abu Amina Elias argue that what early Muslims called abrogating is now considered interpretation:
 The general meaning of the righteous predecessors when using the words &#x27;abrogating&#x27; and &#x27;abrogated&#x27; is sometimes the complete removal of the previous ruling – and this is the technical term of the latter generations – or sometimes the removal of the general, absolute, and outward meaning, whether by specification, restriction, interpreting an absolute as limited, or by explanation and clarification. Even they would refer to is as exceptional and conditional.
== Scholarly questions and alternatives ==

=== Questions/criticism===
==== Muslim====
While belief in the theory of &quot;naskh&quot; of Islamic revelation is part of Sunni Muslim orthodoxy, there are more than a few scholars who do not accept it, including most twentieth century modernist reformist scholars. In addition some non-mainstream sects of Islam — such as the Mu&#x27;tazili, Zaidiyah, and Quranists, and more recently the Ahmadiyya — have rejected &quot;naskh&quot; on the rationalist grounds that the word of God can not contain contradictions. Other scholars did/do not dismiss the theory of naskh but consider it poor scholarship.

One medieval scholar we know about — Abu Muslim al-Isfahani (d. 322/933) — &quot;denied the theory of naskh entirely&quot;. More recently there have been Aslam Jairajpuri (d. 1955), and Modernist Syed Ahmad Khan (d. 1439/1898), revivalist scholar Mohammed al-Ghazali, Khaleel Mohammed, and contemporary scholar Ahmad Hasan.

According to David Powers, Islamic scholars have asked how an eternal, all-knowing, all-powerful God, would need to change His mind, i.e. His eternal divine will, and would reveal rulings wrong or imperfect in the first place. Islamic Modernist scholars, (according to scholar Karel Steenbrink), consider the theory of naskh &quot;an insult to the integrity and value of the uncreated revelation of God.&quot; Hasan believes the theory of abrogation of the Quran contradicts its &quot;eternal validity&quot;. Mohammed al-Ghazali quotes &quot;jurist and historian&quot;, al-Khidri, as &quot;categorically rejected&quot; naskh of Quranic verses, saying abrogation &quot;does not occur except to make specific, or limit, or explain that which is otherwise general and unconditional.&quot; Mohammed al-Ghazali also quotes Rashid Rida as quoting the first part of Q.2:106 — &quot;We do not abrogate (naskh) a sign or cause it to be forgotten&quot; — in his opposition to naskh. Syed Ahmad Khan &quot;vehemently&quot; rejected abrogation of Islamic revelation.

Some Muslim scholars (Al-Sha`rani and Shah Wali Allah) were skeptical of the use of Naskh, considering it a sort of short cut to be avoided. According to contemporary scholar Jonathan A.C. Brown, the Sufi jurist Al-Sha`rani considered claims of abrogation to be 

the recourse of those mediocre and narrow-minded jurists whose hearts God had not illuminated with his Light. They could not perceive all the interpretive possibilities in the words of God and the Prophet … By taking the shortcut of stamping Quranic verses or Hadiths &#x27;abrogated&#x27;, such ulama had restricted the interpretive plurality that God had intended in the Shariah. For Sha&#x27;rani only when a Hadith included the Prophet&#x27;s own clear abrogation, like his report about visiting graves, could it be considered Naskh.

Shah Wali Allah was similarly skeptical of the ulama&#x27;s excessive indulgence in abrogation to explain the relationship between Quranic verses or hadiths. In all but five cases, he found explanations for how to understand the relationship between scriptural passages without recourse to abrogation.
Although not a denier of naskh, Abdul-Rahim notes that 
not only were the early Muslims unable to agree on every alleged instance of naskh, they also could not agree on the details of the alleged instances, the number of instances; and the classification of the instances.

Among the arguments Islamic Modernist mufti Muhammad Abduh offers against naskh of the Quran (mentioned earlier) is that &quot;the Quran nowhere announced that verse so-and-so is naskh, or that verse such-and-such is Mansukh&quot;. Nor is Naskh an article of faith of Islam, like belief in the prophets, angels, books of Allah. It is &quot;merely a technique employed by the exegetes of the first century.&quot;

Since an abrogating verse must have been revealed after an abrogated verse, being able to determined which verse came first is crucial, but (according to Abduh) scholars do not
 &quot;possess an undeniable indication that one verse is earlier or later than any other verse, ... They merely asserted without proof that one verse was later than another. ... even more surprising is the absence of a single agreed hadith from the Prophet which might be taken to be a certain documentary proof that verse so-and-so is the nasikh of verse so-and-so.&quot;

This raises the question of whether human scholars deciding what had been abrogating are not introducing a &quot;man-made&quot; element into divine revelation.

====Non-Muslim====

John Burton argues that the theory of naskh was an &quot;invention of fiqh scholars&quot;, used not to develop fiqh but to validated already existing fiqh doctrine. (Burton is among those in the &quot;mainstream&quot; of the Islamic studies field of fiqh/Islamic law led by Ignác Goldziher and Joseph Schacht who hold that fiqh doctrine did not grow directly and organically from the Quran and sayings and doings of Muhammad but was already established and sometimes in contradiction with the Quran when the theory of naskh was established.)

A &quot;careful examination of the Quran itself produces no evidence that naskh of the sort fiqh scholars had in mind is envisioned in or exemplified by the Quran.&quot; This sort of naskh would be the &quot;classical&quot; form of abrogation, namely abrogation of rulings but not text as (1. &quot;naskh al-hukm dūna al-tilāwa&quot;). But if this was the case, would not Q.2:106 read: 
*&quot;Whatever &quot;existing ritual or legal regulation&quot; We suppress or cause to abandon, We shall bring in its place another superior to it or at least similar to it... &quot;
... instead of what it does say: 
*&quot;What We abrogate (of) &quot;a sign&quot; or [We] cause it to be forgotten, We bring better than it or similar (to) it.&quot;
Furthermore, Burton argues (according to Bernard Weiss) that rather than fiqh scholars deciding which of two (or more) conflicting verses should be the basis of a ruling in Islamic law by determining which verse came later, the scholars searched for &quot;text that supported&quot; an already established doctrine of Islamic law and then postulating &quot;a chronology&quot; whereby that supportive text came &quot;later and the non-supportive text earlier&quot;.

====Defense====

The principle of &quot;naskh&quot; is acknowledged by both Sunnis and Shī&#x27;a, and the vast majority of their scholars accept that there are significant contradictions within the Quran, within the Hadiths, between the Quran and the Hadiths, and that the doctrine of abrogation as revealed by the Quran is necessary to establish Sharia.

Scholar Roslan Abdul-Rahim defends the concept of naskh pointed out the numerous Islamic scholars who have studied and written on the subject and how &quot;very elaborate, sophisticated and ... complex&quot; scholarly discussion of naskh became. &quot;Over seventy&quot; scholars — both classical and contemporary — have written &quot;solely on naskh&quot;. Critics have noted the lack of consensus on what verses or Quran and hadith are abrogated, but Abdul-Rahim replies that while &quot;the Muslim scholars of antiquity&quot; may have disagreed about what revelations of the Qur&#x27;an were abrogated, at &quot;the conceptual level of definition&quot; they agreed.

He asks rhetorically &quot;How could a long tradition established by a community bounded by faith and integrity, and supported by continuity and sustainability be so wrong? ... Could they have not understood or simply misunderstood something that is naturally ingrained in the language of their own culture?&quot; While it is true that scholars have not been able to agree on the instances, number, details or classification of naskh, this is no reason to conclude that naskh &quot;as a theory and a phenomenon is false&quot; and he quotes philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn: &quot;failure to achieve a solution discredits only the scientist and not the theory&quot;.

Some orthodox scholars, such as Ibn Hilal al-Nahwi found the theory so crucial to Islamic belief that they declared takfir against those who opposed it. Eleventh century scholar Ibn Hilal al-Nahwi (mentioned above) declared that &quot;whoever says&quot; that there is no abrogation in Islam &quot;is not a believer, but rather a &quot;kafir&quot;,&quot; and &quot;must renounce his position or be killed&quot;.
More recently, Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz (Wahhabi scholar and Grand Mufti of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at the time), responded to an article which included some ideas against the concept of abrogation, by stating that the author was guilty of &quot;an act of clear disbelief, a repudiation of Islam, and denial of Allah the Glorious and His Prophet on whom be peace ... It is obligatory upon the governing authority to have that man brought to the courts and ask that he retract his statements, and to rule upon him according to that which the pure Shari&#x27;ah summons&quot;. (Ibn Baz having called for the execution of Muslims guilty of what he considered acts of unbelief on other occasions.)

=== Alternative Theories===

Among those who deny the orthodox theory of &quot;Naskh&quot; out of concerns over how God would change his eternal will, some Islamic scholars have used rationalization and reinterpretation to deal with contradictory verses. In addition, theories have been developed as to how to deal with contradictions in the Quran and/or Sunnah, and what Q.2:106 (&quot;None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause it to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar ...&quot;) is referring to if not orthodox naskh of the Quran.

;Naskh as abrogation of Jewish and Christian texts

As mentioned above, the idea that Islamic revelation abrogates earlier Jewish and Christian religious laws handed down by monotheist messengers before Muhammad, is widely accepted among Muslims. However, an argument advanced by (at least some of) the minority of scholars who oppose the idea of abrogation of the Quran is that &quot;naskh&quot; in Q.2:106 refers to &quot;only&quot; to &quot;the abrogation of the codes of law revealed to the earlier Prophets&quot;, and &quot;not&quot; to abrogation of the Quran. John Burton, Muhammad al-Ghazali, Ahmad Hasan argue that the abrogation verse Q.2:106 was revealed after a series of verses talking about the People of the Book.

Burton notes that the verses, among other things, abrogated many aspects of the Jewish Halakha. According to Muhammad Sameel &#x27;Abd al-Haqq, there are &quot;many&quot; commentators and other scholars who believe that in ayah Q.2:106 (&quot;None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause it to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar ...&quot;) the phrase &quot;Our revelations&quot; refers to the revelations &quot;before&quot; the Qur&#x27;an; &quot;something better or similar&quot; refers to the Quran itself. According to Mohammed al-Ghazali, &quot;The revelation of the Qur&#x27;an, ... is an abrogation of some of the legislation of the People of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians). ... There is no contradiction in the Qur&#x27;an whatsoever ...&quot;
Ahmad Hasan writes: &quot;If we read this passage (Q.2:106) with reference to its context, there remains no doubt that the Qur&#x27;an is speaking about the annulment of the Law revealed unto the Prophets of the Children of Israel&quot;. As to why &quot;some of the most eminent authorities of &quot;tafsir&quot;&quot; have not agreed with this explanation, he argues it is because
#the Arabic word that is translated as &quot;revelation&quot; in verses Q.2:106 and Q.16:101 (&quot;ayah&quot;) is also the word used &quot;in common parlance&quot; to refer to the verses that make up the surahs of the Quran.
#the word used to describe the Quran, the Jewish Torah or the Christian New Testament in the Quran is &quot;kitab&quot; (literally &quot;book&quot;). 
However, to believe Q.2:106 and Q.16:101 are referring to verses in the Quran, Hasan says,

is an error. &quot;Ayah&quot; literally means &#x27;a sign&#x27;, token, or mark by which a person or thing is known and is synonymous with &quot;`alamah&quot;. It, by implication, also means &#x27;a message, or communication sent from one person or party to another&#x27; and is in this sense synonymous with &quot;risalah&quot;.

====Resolving contradictions without chronology====
Two theories have been proposed to deal with contradictory commands of revelation without the chronology of verses and the abrogation of earlier ayat in favor of later ones:
;Abrogation of (later) Medinan verses, not earlier ones 

The Quran has been divided by scholars into those verses revealed while Muhammad was in Mecca (the Meccan surah) preaching to develop a following, and those revealed after he left Mecca to govern the city of Medina (the Medinan surah). Sudanese Islamic scholar Mahmoud Mohammed Taha has advanced the idea that the Meccan surah contain &quot;the basic and pure doctrine of Islam&quot;, and should form the &quot;basis of the legislation&quot; for modern society. These Meccan verses give more prominence to the position of women and praise other prophets and their communities — i.e. Jews and Christians. Taha argues that the Medinan surah, though revealed later in the mission of Muhammad, are not corrections of Meccan revelations but contain specialized commands/doctrine, &quot;compromises&quot; for the political climate, which while appropriate for their time are not eternal and are not necessarily appropriate for the 20th or 21st century.

;Replace abrogation with application of commands according to circumstances
Ahmad Hasan argues that since the Quran is valid for eternity, the solution to any contradictions found within it is not to abrogate earlier verses, but to recognize that Qur&#x27;anic revelations varied to keep &quot;pace with the changing conditions and environment&quot; and must be studied and applied to their &quot;historical context&quot;. In the case of the Meccan surahs that ask &quot;Muslims to be patient and to tolerate the aggression of the infidels&quot; (for example: Q.2:109; Q.6:106; Q10:109; Q15:85; Q29:46), and which conflict with the Medinan Sword Verse (Q.9:5) that calls on Muslims to attack &quot;the infidels and kill them wherever they are found&quot;; neither is a pure/basic doctrine, nor a temporary tactic. The Meccan surahs were revealed when the Muslims were/are weak and could not retaliate against aggression, Medinan surahs when Muslim were/are strong. The proper command to implement is the one for &quot;conditions similar to those in which they were revealed&quot; — apply the Sword Verse when Muslims are strong, the earlier verses when they are not. Mohammed al-Ghazali also states, &quot;There is no contradiction in the Qur&#x27;an whatsoever, for every verse has a context within which it functions. ... He, the Legislator who knows the conditions in which the verses may be applied, and it is in this manner that the Qur&#x27;anic verses are to be considered in light of the state of human affairs — with wisdom and exhortation.&quot;

In their rejection of the theory of &quot;naskh&quot; the Ahmadiyya also argue that a ruling is considered valid not because it was revealed after any other on a given subject, but because it is most suited to the situation at hand. Ahmadiyya believe all Qur&#x27;anic verses have equal validity, in keeping with their emphasis on the &quot;unsurpassable beauty and unquestionable validity of the Qur&#x27;ān&quot;, but in Ahmadī &quot;fiqh&quot; rulings apply to the specific situation for which a verse/hadith was revealed

== Literature ==
In addition to being discussed within general works of jurisprudence, &quot;naskh&quot; generated its own corpus of specialized legal manuals. These treatises invariably begin with an introduction designed to impress the importance and high Islamic credibility of the science, often by an appeal to &quot;&#x27;ilmic&quot; authority figures of the past (as in the story of &#x27;Alī and the Kufan preacher). As is made clear in these stories, &quot;none may occupy judicial or religious office in the community who is not equipped with this indispensable knowledge and who is incapable of distinguishing nāsikh [abrogator] from mansūkh [abrogatee].

The remainder of the introduction then typically treats the various modes of &quot;naskh&quot;, &quot;naskh&quot;″s applicability between Sunnah and Qur&#x27;ān, and- in appeasement of theological scruples- why &quot;naskh&quot; is not the same as badā&#x27;, or inconstancy of the Divine Will. Following this comes the core of the treatise, an enumeration of abrogated verses in &quot;sūra&quot; order of the Qur&#x27;ān. In their consideration of &quot;nāsikh wal-mansūkh&quot; the taxonomic predilections of these authors comes out, evinced in their discussions of special verses considered &quot;marvels&quot; (&quot;ajā&#x27;ib&quot;) of the Qur&#x27;an, such as the verse which abrogates the greatest number of other verses (Q.9:5), the verse which was in effect longest until it was abrogated (Q.46:9), and the verse which contains both an abrogatee and its abrogator (Q.5:105).

<text>Ján Hollý (contemporary orthography: Gán Hollí; 24 March 1785, Bur-Szent-Miklos – 14 April 1849, Jókő) was a Slovak poet and translator. He was the first greater Slovak poet to write exclusively in the newly standardized literary Slovak language. His predecessors mostly wrote in various regional versions of Czech, Slovakized Czech or Latin. Hollý translated Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and wrote his own epic poetry in alexandrine verse to show that the Slovak language recently standardized by Anton Bernolák was capable of expressing complex poetic forms.

== Life ==
Hollý studied in Skalica (Szakolca), Pressburg (Pozsony) and Trnava (Nagyszombat). He was a Catholic priest at Madunice (Madunicz) near Piešťany (Pöstyén), where he wrote all his major works sitting below a big tree. Hollý was an active member of the Slovak national revival movement. He used the topic of Great-Moravian ruler Svätopluk to encourage the nation, and is regarded as the founding father of Slovak poetry.

<doc id="1231942" wikidata="Q3641285" url="?curid=1231942" title="Bob Cratchit">
<text>Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Cratchit is a fictional character in the Charles Dickens 1843 novel &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. The overworked, underpaid clerk of Ebenezer Scrooge, Cratchit has come to symbolise the poor working conditions, especially long working hours and low pay, endured by many working-class people in the early Victorian era.

Cratchit&#x27;s son, Tiny Tim, is also a defining character in the novel.

==In the novel==
Scrooge threatens to sack his clerk if he asks for more coal to heat the fire. Cratchit wears his woollen scarf at work as he is so cold. When Cratchit timidly asks Scrooge for Christmas Day off work so he can be with his family, he notes it only comes once a year. Scrooge reluctantly agrees on the condition that Cratchit comes to work early the day after Christmas.

Cratchit and his family live in poverty because Scrooge is like any other employer at the time. Cratchit&#x27;s son, Tiny Tim, is very ill. According to the Ghost of Christmas Present, Tim will die because the family is too poor to give him the treatment he needs. While Scrooge is the &quot;ogre&quot; of the Cratchit family, with Cratchit&#x27;s wife calling him out for his stinginess, Bob shows a generous spirit, as he mildly insists that they toast his health for Christmas Day. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows Scrooge the Cratchit family mourning the death of Tiny Tim, with Bob returning from the graveyard where Tim&#x27;s funeral will take place, and paying his respects to Tim&#x27;s body upstairs.

After Scrooge decides to change his ways on Christmas Day, he anonymously sends a Christmas turkey to Cratchit for his family&#x27;s dinner. The next day, Scrooge states that he will increase Cratchit&#x27;s salary immediately and promises to help his struggling family, expressing by offering Cratchit a drink of &quot;smoking bishop&quot;, and even telling him to buy a coal-scuttle for his room. Bob is at first taken aback by Scrooge&#x27;s transformation. 

==Family==
The Cratchit family has been described as &quot;impoverished, hardworking, and warmhearted&quot;.

Seven members are mentioned in the original story, five of whom are named:
* Mrs. Cratchit, Bob Cratchit&#x27;s wife, who is named &quot;Emily&quot; in some adaptations.
* Martha Cratchit, the eldest daughter, who works as an apprentice at a milliners, on the morning of Christmas Day.
* Belinda Cratchit, the second daughter.
* Peter Cratchit, the heir, for whom his father is arranging employment at the weekly rate of five shillings and sixpence.
* Timothy &quot;Tiny Tim&quot; Cratchit. The youngest child, he is desperately ill and walks with a crutch.

== In other media ==
The character of Bob Cratchit has been featured in works based on &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

* &quot;Cratchit&quot; by Alexander Knott premiered at London&#x27;s Park Theatre, with John Dagleish as Bob. The play &quot;explores what might happen if Cratchit was visited by the Ghost of Christmas yet-to-come and shown a bleak vision of the future, where the gap between rich and poor has grown beyond measure.&quot;
* The character has been featured in the 2002 musical comedy &quot;Mrs. Bob Cratchit&#x27;s Wild Christmas Binge.&quot;

<text>Admiral Thomas Boulton Fargo (born June 13, 1948) served in the United States Navy during the late 20th century and early 21st century. He served as Commander, United States Pacific Command, at Camp H. M. Smith, Hawaii from May 2, 2002 to February 26, 2005. He was the twentieth officer to hold the position.

==Biography==
Born in San Diego, California, in June 1948, Fargo attended high school in Coronado, California, and Sasebo, Japan, and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in June 1970.

His father, Thomas A. Boulton, was a naval officer who was killed in a plane crash in 1957. His mother, Helen, remarried in 1960 to Captain William Fargo, US Navy. Helen was a Lieutenant in the US Navy Nurse Corps during World War II; both Thomas and William graduated from the Naval Academy (Class of 1943 and Class of 1939, respectively.)

Trained in joint, naval and submarine commands, Fargo served in a variety of sea and shore duty assignments. At sea, his five assignments in both attack and ballistic missile submarines included Executive Officer aboard and Commanding Officer of . While commander of the &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, Fargo hosted aboard several members of the cast of the movie &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; as they were researching their roles as submarine crew members. He served as Commander, Submarine Group SEVEN, Commander Task Force SEVEN FOUR, and Commander Task Force ONE FIVE SEVEN in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf from 1992 to 1993. He commanded the United States FIFTH Fleet and Naval Forces of the Central Command during two years of Iraqi contingency operations from July 1996 to July 1998. Fargo served as the 29th Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet from October 1999 to May 2002.

Ashore, Fargo served in the Bureau of Naval Personnel and with the Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet and has had multiple assignments in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations.
After his selection to Flag rank in 1994, Admiral Fargo has served as Director of Operations (J-3), U.S. Atlantic Command during the Haiti intervention; as Director, Assessment Division (N-81) for the Chief of Naval Operations; and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans, Policy and Operations (N3/N5).

While serving as Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), Fargo informed the United States Congress of his plans to retire from the Navy. Although an Air Force flag officer was nominated to succeed him, the Senate declined to confirm the nominee, as it was customary to fill that post with a Navy flag officer. President Bush accordingly extended Fargo&#x27;s mandatory retirement date. Fargo ultimately retired from military service in 2005, when the Senate confirmed Admiral William J. Fallon to succeed him as Commander of USPACOM.

Admiral Fargo is a 1989 recipient of the Vice Admiral James Bond Stockdale Award for Inspirational Leadership. His personal decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal (four awards), the Defense Superior Service Medal, and the Legion of Merit (three awards). In February 2005 he was appointed an honorary Officer of the Order of Australia &quot;for distinguished naval service, particularly for strengthening the Australia-United States alliance whilst Commander United States Pacific Command&quot;.

In 2010, the National Bureau of Asian Research appointed Fargo as the second holder of the 
Shalikashvili Chair in National Security Studies.

In 2019, Fargo became the 22nd chairman of USAA.

==Awards and decorations==

==The Hunt for Red October==
Admiral Fargo served as the inspiration for the character of Commander Bart Mancuso in the film &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. Scott Glenn spent several days preparing for his role aboard the &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;. It was during this time that he decided to base his portrayal of his character on then-Commander Fargo.

Fargo had told Glenn, &quot;I&#x27;ve given orders to all the men on board to treat you as equal rank with me so every time for the next few days while we are out, when someone comes up and reports to me, they are going to turn around and report to you, and I&#x27;m going to tell you what we are going to do about it. There may be once or twice that I&#x27;m going to ask you to go to your quarters when we are dealing with stuff that is top secret.&quot;

&quot;Tom Fargo was a strong, tough commander, but he had a degree of relaxation and looseness that I never would have expected.&quot; – Scott Glenn.

&quot;He was incredibly confident...he was this guy you would follow into hell.&quot; – Alec Baldwin.
