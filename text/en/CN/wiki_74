<text>Andrea Albert Pierre Casiraghi (born 8 June 1984) is the elder son of Caroline, Princess of Hanover, and her second husband Stefano Casiraghi. He is the eldest grandchild of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and American actress Grace Kelly. Casiraghi is currently fourth in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne, following his twin cousins and his mother.

==Family background and early life==
Casiraghi was born on 8 June 1984 at the Princess Grace Hospital Centre in La Colle, Monaco, to Princess Caroline of Monaco and her husband, the Italian businessman and athlete Stefano Casiraghi.

The eldest grandchild of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and his wife, former American actress Grace Kelly, Casiraghi was named after his father&#x27;s childhood friend, his maternal uncle Prince Albert and his maternal great-grandfather Prince Pierre, Duke of Valentinois. Casiraghi&#x27;s godparents are his maternal aunt Princess Stéphanie and his paternal uncle, Marco Casiraghi. His sister Charlotte was born on 3 August 1986, and his brother Pierre on 5 September 1987.

On 3 October 1990, Casiraghi&#x27;s father died in a speedboat accident in Monaco. He was buried several days later in Monaco&#x27;s Chapel of Peace. Princess Caroline did not know how to tell her children that their father had died, so her father, Prince Rainier, did so. To protect her children from excessive media attention, Caroline moved to Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, and later to Paris.

Despite his parents not having married in the Church, as required for legitimacy under church law, he and his younger sister and brother were legitimised by Pope John Paul II in February 1993, eight months after his mother was granted an annulment of her first marriage (to Philippe Junot) by a Pope&#x27;s decree in June 1992, making him and his siblings dynasts and clearing the way for their possible succession to the throne of Monaco.

In 1999, his mother married Ernst August, Prince of Hanover, and gave birth to Princess Alexandra of Hanover. Besides a half-sister, Casiraghi gained two stepbrothers, Ernst August, Hereditary Prince of Hanover, and Prince Christian of Hanover, through his mother&#x27;s remarriage.

==Education and career==
Growing up mostly in France, Casiraghi earned his international baccalaureate in December 2002 from the International School of Paris, where his mother gave the commencement speech in June the following year, confirming that she was an ISP parent. Following a period at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, he eventually graduated in 2006 with a B.A. degree in visual arts and international politics from the American University of Paris.

He was an intern at the embassy from Qatar to Monaco, which, like most of Monaco&#x27;s embassies, is based in Paris. In 2014, he started a Master of Business Administration at IE Business School (formerly known as Instituto de Empresa) in Madrid.

== Philanthropy and social activities ==
Since 2004, Casiraghi has been involved, to varying degrees, with the World Association of Children&#x27;s Friends (AMADE), a philanthropic organization founded in 1963 by his grandmother Grace; it is currently presided over by his mother Princess Caroline. He spent eight months teaching children in Senegal, Togo, and Niger. In August 2006, Casiraghi visited Manila on behalf of a joint venture of AMADE and the Virlanie Foundation. Since 2007, he has been the patron of the Motrice Foundation, which funds research into cerebral palsy. Casiraghi was a guest of honor at the 149th Hospices de Beaune charity auction that was held in November 2009.

In 2011, Andrea bought a pair of loafers from a Tod&#x27;s boutique in Milan. This shopping trip was well publicized for a reason. The following summer, he donated them to the &quot;Small Steps Project&quot;. The &quot;Small Steps Project&quot; gives celebrity-worn shoes to the poorest children in the world.

In 2011, Casiraghi and his siblings Charlotte and Pierre hosted Monaco&#x27;s annual Rose Ball, in the absence of Prince Albert, Princess Caroline and Princess Stéphanie who were mourning the sudden death of their aunt Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy, a few days earlier. Casiraghi gave the speech at the start of the event. The same year, he attended the wedding of his uncle Prince Albert and Charlene Wittstock, which took place on 1 and 2 July 2011.

==Personal and family life==
In July 2012, Princess Caroline released a statement announcing that her son Andrea Casiraghi and Tatiana Santo Domingo had become engaged after a seven-year relationship. On 6 November 2012, Santo Domingo said in an interview for &quot;La Voz Libre&quot; that she was expecting her first child. She gave birth to a son, Alexandre Andrea Stefano &quot;Sasha&quot; Casiraghi, on 21 March 2013, at Portland Hospital in London, England. As his parents were not married at the time of birth, he was not then included in the Monegasque line of succession. However, due to their subsequent marriage their son currently occupies the fifth position in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne.

Casiraghi and Santo Domingo were married in a civil ceremony in the Princely Palace of Monaco on 31 August 2013. A religious ceremony was later held in Gstaad, Switzerland, on 1 February 2014. Their second child, a daughter named India, was born in London on 12 April 2015. Their third child, a boy named Maximilian Rainier, was born in Monaco on 19 April 2018.

Casiraghi is fluent in French, Italian, Spanish, English and German. His hobbies and interests include reading, football, horse riding, water sports, skiing and collecting Swatch watches.

==Media==
In December 2011, Casiraghi had his driving licence suspended after being caught speeding at 200 km/h near Lyon, France. Casiraghi is regularly tracked by the tabloids and paparazzi. The media nicknamed him as an &quot;enfant terrible&quot; and &quot;rebel angel&quot;. In 1999, he was included in the &quot;People Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; list. In 2003, he was featured in a &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; article about young royals and was voted the most stylish male royal by &quot;Hello Magazine&quot;&#x27;s readers. In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; placed him the tenth on their &quot;20 Hottest Young Royals&quot; list.

<text>Westmead Hospital is a major teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. Opened on 10 November 1978, the 975-bed hospital forms part of the Western Sydney Local Health District, and is a teaching hospital of Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney.

The hospital serves a population of 1.85 million people and is located on one of the largest health and hospital campuses in Australia. In 2016/17, Westmead Hospital provided more than 1.5m occasions of care to outpatients, in addition to approximately 107,000 inpatients. Annually, there are over 21,000 medical operations, almost 5,800 births, and more than 75,000 presentations to emergency department.

Westmead Hospital is located on the junction of Darcy and Hawkesbury Roads in Westmead and provides a full range of tertiary medical and dental services except for paediatrics which is serviced by the adjacent Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead, relocated from Camperdown to Westmead in 1995. The Hospital includes a large Dental Clinical School and extensive clinical pathology and medical research facilities. From 1995 to 2017 the statewide NETS (NSW), the Newborn and paediatric Emergency Transport Service was hosted at Westmead Hospital, prior to moving to make way for a new acute services block for the hospital.

Located nearby are the Cumberland Hospital (providing outpatient and inpatient psychiatric care) and Westmead Private Hospital, a division of Ramsay Health Care.

==History==
===Parramatta===
The history of health service in western Sydney began with a tent hospital established in Parramatta to meet the medical needs of convicts, military personnel, and early settlers in 1789. The hospital at Parramatta saw many changes over the years, firstly in 1818, it was known as the Colonial Hospital and later, in 1897, the hospital was expanded and became known as the Parramatta District Hospital.

As population expanded in Sydney&#x27;s west, the services provided at Parramatta became inadequate to meet demand. The hospital was the first major tertiary referral health centre in outer Sydney. Prior to its existence, referral health services were provided in inner-city centres such as the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, the Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney Hospital, Royal North Shore Hospital and St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital.

The Westmead Hospital, initially known as the Westmead Centre, was established on 10 November 1978 (opened by Premier Neville Wran with former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam as guest of honour), changing the role of Parramatta Hospital.

Acute services were relocated to Westmead Hospital with the Parramatta building continuing to function as the rehabilitation arm of Westmead Hospital. In 1991, all services moved out of the old Parramatta Hospital and in 1995 the building was decommissioned and redeveloped into the Parramatta Justice Precinct. Parramatta Community Health Centre, located in Jeffery House, still operates on part of the original site.

===Area Health Services===
Westmead Hospital, together with the Parramatta Hospital, was initially governed by a local hospital Board. When local boards were restructured into Area Health Services by the Government of New South Wales, Westmead Hospital became part of the Western Sydney Area Health Service, together with Westmead Dental Hospital, Cumberland Hospital (mental health services), district hospitals at Blacktown, Auburn and Mount Druitt. In 2005, the boundaries of the Area Health Services were changed, and, up until 31 December 2010, Westmead Hospital was one of two tertiary teaching hospitals (together with Nepean Hospital in Penrith), part of the Sydney West Area Health Service.

===Local Hospital District===
Following the formation of Local Health Networks on 1 January 2011, Westmead Hospital became part of the Western Sydney Local Health District, together with Westmead Dental Hospital, and district hospitals at Blacktown, Auburn and Mount Druitt.

===Major refurbishments===
In 2004, a contract worth in excess of A$142 million for refurbishment and development of new facilities at Westmead Hospital was awarded to Thiess. As works were nearly completion in July 2007, NSW Minister for Health, Reba Meagher together with NSW Member for Parramatta Tanya Gadiel inspected the new Women&#x27;s Health and Newborn Care Centre that provides a new birthing unit, special care nursery and neonatal intensive care unit, 41 bed maternity ward, antenatal and gynaecology inpatient wards and ambulatory care clinics in the one location. It is expected that by 2011, more than 5,000 babies will be born at Westmead Hospital each year.

Refurbishment of cancer wards at Westmead Hospital occurred at around the same time; based on the US-style comprehensive cancer centre model. In 2011, the facilities were renamed as the Crown Princess Mary Cancer Centre Westmead. Inspecting the facilities during 2007, Ms Meagher stated: 
:&quot;This means that patient care at every level will be organised to ensure smooth transition between hospital inpatient services, community treatment or palliative care as people&#x27;s care needs change. The co-location of a range of speciality cancer services means patients will be able to receive diagnoses and a range of treatments and rehabilitation without the need to make separate trips.&quot;
Other facilities to be refurbished under the Theiss contract included facilities for intensive care and renal treatments.

In March 2012, a food-court style emporium was opened on the ground level precinct introducing a wide variety of cuisines to the standard hospital fare, including a sweets and desserts cafe, kebabs, pizza, fresh salads and sandwich bar, gelato station, and various selections of hot foods. A number of retail stores including a hair and beauty salon, phones outlet, pharmacy and convenience store is also under development.

==Services==
As well as General Wards, there are a range of high dependency wards at Westmead Hospital including a Coronary Care Unit, an Intensive Care Unit, a Special Care Nursery, High Dependency Wards, and a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. For a full list of service, refer to the table in links below.

Westmead Emergency Department is one of the busiest in Australia seeing over 52,000 adult patients annually. It is supported by tertiary specialist services including 24 hours and 7 days a week interventional cardiology, trauma services, cardiothoracic surgery, neurosurgery and toxicology.

Westmead Medical Research Foundation provides fundraising support and community advocacy for medical research and patient care at Westmead.

Westmead Hospital is the base for the New South Wales helicopter operations of CareFlight air ambulance service. Its aircraft and trained medical and operational crews respond to emergencies threatening the life, health and safety of people caused through medical emergency, illness, natural disaster, accidents or mishap. Within Westmead Hospital exists the Trauma Service, which provides research and education of injury prevention, and death statistics.

==Teaching and research==
Since its establishment in 1978, the Westmead Clinical School of Sydney University at Westmead Hospital has been a place of innovation and growth. The Faculty of Medicine is Australia&#x27;s oldest and largest medical faculty (established as Sydney Medical School in 1856) undertaking teaching and research in health and medicine of international standing. As part of the Western Clinical School, teaching facilities at Westmead form an integral part of education as the largest of the University&#x27;s centres of clinical care in Sydney. The University supported the establishment of research clinicians in all key staff specialist postings at the hospital in 1978.

The Hospital accepted its first dental patients in 1980. The Westmead Hospital Dental Clinical School (now the Westmead Centre for Oral Health) has become a major facility for the Faculty of Dentistry for both undergraduate and postgraduate education and training.

Medical research has been taking place at Westmead Hospital since the early 1980s. In 1996, medical research facilities were consolidated through the establishment of the Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research (WMI). Initially with just 60 scientists and doctors, the Institute now has over 450 medical research scientists.

<doc id="1255782" wikidata="Q546241" url="?curid=1255782" title="Virgin of Vladimir">
<text>The Virgin of Vladimir, also known as Vladimir Mother of God, Our Lady of Vladimir (), is a 12th-century Byzantine icon depicting the Virgin and Child and an early example of the &quot;Eleusa&quot; iconographic type. It is one of the most culturally significant and celebrated pieces of art in Russian history. Many consider it a national palladium with several miracles of historical importance to Russia being attributed to the icon. Following its near destruction in the thirteenth century, the work has been restored at least five times.

The icon was painted by an unknown artist most likely in Constantinople, or painted by Luke the Evangelist and sent through Anatolia to Thrace. It was sent to Kiev as a gift before being transferred to the Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir. It is traditionally said that the icon did not leave Vladimir until 1395, when it was brought to Moscow to protect the city from an invasion by Timur, although the historical accuracy of this claim is uncertain. By at least the sixteenth century, it was in the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow where it remained until it was moved to the State Tretyakov Gallery after the Russian Revolution.

It was subject to an ownership dispute in the 1990s between the gallery and Moscow Patriarchate, which ended with its relocation to the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi. An arrangement was made to operate the church with dual status as a house church and part of the museum. The icon remains there today, and is only accessible via an underground passage from the gallery to the church, where liturgies are still held.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

The icon is dated to the earlier part of the 12th century, and arrived in Rus&#x27; around 1131. This is consistent with accounts given in Rus&#x27; chronicles. Similar to other high quality Byzantine works of art, it is thought to have been painted in Constantinople. Only the faces are original, with the clothes repainted after suffering damage when a metal cover or riza was placed over them and in a fire in 1195.

In about 1131, the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople sent the icon as a gift to grand prince Yuri Dolgorukiy of Kiev. Academic Sona Hoisington attributes this in part to a greater effort by Byzantines to convert and Christianize the Slavic peoples at the time. It was kept in a Vyshhorod nunnery until Yuri&#x27;s son, Andrey of Bogolyubovo, brought it to Vladimir in 1155.

In a traditional account the horses transporting the icon had stopped near Vladimir and refused to go further. Accordingly, many people of Rus interpreted this as a sign that the &quot;Theotokos&quot; wanted the icon to stay there. The place was named Bogolyubovo, or &quot;the one loved by God&quot;. Andrey placed it in his Bogolyubovo residence and built the Assumption Cathedral to legitimize his claim that Vladimir had replaced Kiev as the principal city of Rus. The icon was soon moved to the Assumption Cathedral after its consecration in 1160.
Following the consecration of the Assumption Cathedral, which was soon followed by other churches dedicated to the Virgin, there is no record of the icon ever leaving Vladimir until 1395. However, its presence did not prevent the sack and burning of the city by the Mongols in 1238, when the icon was damaged in the fire. It was restored soon after the event, and again in 1431 and in 1512.

=== Transfer to Moscow ===

A legend formed that the icon was painted by Luke the Evangelist from life; the first written account of this story dates back to 1512. The intercession of the &quot;Theotokos&quot; through the image has also been credited with saving Moscow from Tatar hordes in 1451 and 1480.

The image was brought from Vladimir to Moscow in 1395, during Tamerlane&#x27;s invasion. The site where the Muscovites met the Vladimir delegation is commemorated by the Sretensky Monastery which is considered to be built where it occurred. However, no archeological evidence supports this claim, and much of the fifteenth-to-sixteenth century church was destroyed after renovations by the Russian Orthodox Church. Vasily I of Moscow spent a night crying over the icon, and Tamerlane&#x27;s armies retreated the same day. The Muscovites refused to return the icon to Vladimir and placed it in the Dormition Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin.

David Miller suggests that the icon was in fact normally still in Vladimir, with some excursions to Moscow, until the 1520s. Crediting the icon with saving Moscow in 1395 does not appear in sources until the late 15th century and the full version of the story until accounts of 1512 and then the 1560s. From the 16th century, the &quot;Vladimirskaya&quot; began to be featured as an important symbol in a series of politicized legends linking Moscow to pre-Mongol Rus and positioning it as the centre of Christianity after Rome and Byzantium—initially to sustain the imperial pretensions of Ivan IV, and later to influence state policy under the Riurikid and Romanov dynasties.

=== Post-revolution ===
Under the Bolsheviks, the icon came into the possession of the State Tretyakov Gallery. Displayed as a work of art, it was first put on display in the gallery in 1930 and kept there for at least the next 11 years. During the Battle of Moscow, Joseph Stalin allegedly had the icon flown around the city as the Germans began to invade. This was first described by Moscow city official Viktor Volokhov in his 2012 book &quot;&quot;.

In 1993, it was moved to the Epiphany Cathedral for a Divine Liturgy in the wake of tensions between President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian Duma. Though it was damaged during the excursion, it was soon restored and given to the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi.

== Description ==
The icon is a tempera painting on wood, in size, with the central portion being original and the rest being a later expansion undertaken possibly to accommodate a larger riza. The icon depicts Jesus Christ as a child being held in the arms of his mother, Mary. They embrace cheek to cheek, with the child gazing towards and reaching for Mary. She holds him with one arm and solemnly looks out towards the viewer. The faces and hands are painted with greenish olive &quot;sankir&quot;, a mix of ochre pigment and soot, and transparent layers of brighter ochre; the child&#x27;s face is rendered in a lighter shade than the mother&#x27;s, perhaps to reflect the difference in their age. The child&#x27;s clothes are painted with dark ochre and gold. The original painting bore the inscription ΜΡ ΘΥ, an abbreviation for &#x27;Mother of God&#x27;, of which only parts survive.

In its nine centuries of existence, the icon has been restored and overpainted at least five times to deal with damage and deterioration, including a fifteenth century restoration thought to have been led by Andrei Rublev. It is mainly the faces of Mary and Jesus and the gold ground above her head that are original twelfth-century paint. In the past, the icon has been covered with several elaborately designed &quot;oklad&quot; and &quot;riza&quot; (revetments) which caused damage to the frame. The reverse, which is much less well known, contains an image of the Hetoimasia (&#x27;prepared throne&#x27;) and instruments of Christ&#x27;s Passion that was painted in century (prior to that the reverse side had a painting of an unidentified saint).

Among icons of Virgin Mary with Jesus, &quot;Our lady of Vladimir&quot; is classed as an Eleusa icon (Russian: &quot;Oumilenie&quot;), due to the tender attachment between mother and child. Theologians and believers have also commented upon the icons symbology and the religious sentiments it inspires. Contemplating the icon, theologian Henri Nouwen, remarked that the Virgin&#x27;s eyes glance at neither the child or the viewer but appear to &quot;look inward and outward at once&quot;; that her free hand gestures towards the baby to &quot;open a space for us to approach Jesus without fear&quot;; and, that the child is shown as &quot;a wise man dressed in adult clothes.&quot; Literary scholar, S. S. Averintsev interpreted the mix of maternal tenderness and poignant sorrow seen in Mary&#x27;s expression, as representative of the emotions generated by the events of Nativity and Calvary, respectively. Jesus&#x27;s bare feet are seen as symbolizing his physical reality; his garments of gold, the Kingdom of Heaven; and the three stars on Mary&#x27;s dress (one occluded by the child), &quot;her virginity before, during and after her son&#x27;s birth.&quot;

Its artistic quality has been highly praised. Art historian David Talbot Rice said that &quot;[Our Lady of Vladimir] ...is admitted by all who have seen it to be one of the most outstanding religious paintings of the world.&quot; Art historian George Heard Hamilton praises its &quot;craftsmanship and conception&quot;, and notes how in its representation of the subject&#x27;s faces, the icon subtly transitions from its normal use of contour lines to a refined surface texture. It is painted in an artistic style typical for Byzantine art of the period with features including smaller mouths, refined eyes, and elongating Mary&#x27;s nose. However, by avoiding the use of demarcating line, as became common in later Byzantine art, and by setting up the complex interplay of the mother and child&#x27;s glances, the icon adds to the illusion of life in the piece. The child&#x27;s features are reminiscent of classical sculpture, though the artist renders an expression truer to an actual infant&#x27;s. The expressive and humanistic character of the icon differentiates it from earlier Byzantine art and exemplify the artistic developments seen during the Komnenos dynasty.

== Significance ==
=== In Russian history ===
The icon is generally considered to be one of the most cherished symbols in Russian history. Academic David Miller has ascribed this to its close connection to Russian national consciousness throughout its existence. Its transfer from Kiev to Vladimir was used by Bogolyubsky to legitimize Vladimir&#x27;s claim as the new center of government in Kievan Rus&#x27;.

Additionally, its intimate association with important Russian historical events gave Our Lady of Vladimir the distinction of being a national palladium. The most recent of these events being the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis when it was brought to the Epiphany Cathedral at the request of Patriarch Alexy II and Mayor of Moscow Yury Luzhkov in their attempt to bring peace to the country.

=== As a religious icon ===
Our Lady of Vladimir&#x27;s veneration is also likely enhanced by the fact that the &quot;Theotokos&quot; is regarded as the holy protectress of Russia. The venerated image has been used in celebration of coronations of tsars, elections of patriarchs, and other important ceremonies of state. The icon has three feast days held throughout the year in celebration to specific events it is associated with:

* to celebrate Moscow&#x27;s protection from Crimean Khan Mehmed Giray in 1521.
* for, in 1480, for their victory against Khan Ahmed during the Great Stand on the Ugra River.
* to commemorate the Muscovite deliverance from pending invasion by Tamerlane.

== Location and display ==
Our Lady of Vladimir is on display at the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi. As a result of an agreement between the Tretyakov and Moscow Patriarchate, the church is both an active Russian Orthodox house church and functioning museum. Previously, there had been a contentious ownership dispute between the two.

In 1997, the Tretyakov completed a full restoration of the church. Security improvements to store and display art were added, and an underground passageway was additionally made to connect it to the State Tretyakov Gallery. In order to house the famous icon, a temperature controlled bulletproof glass case was commissioned. On 7 September 1996, Our Lady of Vladimir was first installed in the special case located within the church, and the next day Patriarch Alexy II consecrated the church. According to Archpriest Nikolai Sokolov, the rector for the church, the case would able to withstand the firing of a Kalashnikov rifle as well as many other potential hazards.

Due to its dual status as both church and museum, visitors are allowed to pray before the icon and divine Liturgies are regularly held on selected days. However, visitors can only enter the church through the Tretyakov Gallery and via the underground passageway.

== Copies and influence ==

Even more than most, the original icon has been repeatedly duplicated for centuries, and many copies also have considerable artistic and religious significance of their own. According to Suzanne Massie, it became a standard for many Russian contemporary depictions of Mary.

In preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics, a chapel was constructed for athletes to be able to pray before competition which hosted a copy of the icon.

<doc id="1255785" wikidata="Q6774579" url="?curid=1255785" title="Martha Tabram">
<text>Martha Tabram (née White; 10 May 1849 – 7 August 1888) was an English woman killed in a spate of violent murders in and around the Whitechapel district of East London between 1888 and 1891. She may have been the first victim of the unidentified serial killer Jack the Ripper.

Although not one of the canonical five Ripper victims whom historians have broadly acknowledged, she is considered the next most likely candidate.

==Early life==
Tabram was born Martha White in Southwark, London, on 10 May 1849. She was the youngest of five children born to Charles Samuel White, a warehouseman, and his wife, Elisabeth Dowsett. In order of birth, her four older siblings were Henry, Stephen, Esther and Mary Ann. She was 5 feet 3 inches (160 cm) tall and had dark hair.

In May 1865, Tabram&#x27;s parents separated; six months later, her father died of natural causes at the age of 59. According to his daughter Mary Ann, her father had been unable to work for several months prior to his death.

==Marriage==
On Christmas Day 1869, Martha married a foreman furniture packer named Henry Samuel Tabram. The service was conducted at Trinity Church in St. Mary&#x27;s Parish, Newington. In 1871, the couple moved to a house close to Martha&#x27;s childhood home. She and Henry had two sons: Frederick John Tabram (born February 1871) and Charles Henry Tabram (born December 1872).

Because of Martha&#x27;s drinking, which was heavy enough to cause alcoholic fits, the Tabrams&#x27; marriage was troubled. Martha&#x27;s husband left her in 1875. For about three years he paid her an allowance of 12 shillings a week, then reduced this to two shillings and sixpence when he heard she was living with another man.

Tabram lived on and off with Henry Turner, a carpenter, from about 1876 until three weeks before her death. This relationship was also troubled by Martha&#x27;s drinking and occasionally staying out all night. She, and her sons, were listed as being overnight inmates at the Whitechapel Union workhouse&#x27;s casual ward at Thomas Street on the census night of 1881. By 1888 Turner was out of regular employment and the couple earned income by selling trinkets and other small articles on the streets, while lodging for about four months at 4 Star Place, off Commercial Road in Whitechapel. Around the beginning of July, they left abruptly, owing rent, and separated for the last time about the middle of that month. Tabram moved to a common lodging house at 19 George Street, Spitalfields. By the time of her death, Tabram&#x27;s economic situation had become so desperate that she was forced to trade sex for money on the streets.

==6 August 1888==

On 6 August 1888, the night before her murder, Tabram was drinking ale and rum with another woman, and some-time prostitute, Mary Ann Connelly, known as &quot;Pearly Poll&quot;, and two soldiers in a public house, the Angel and Crown, close to George Yard Buildings. The four of them paired off, left the public house and separated at approximately 11:45 p.m., each woman with her own client. Martha and her client went to George Yard, a narrow north–south alley connecting Wentworth Street and Whitechapel High Street, entered from Whitechapel High Street by a covered archway next to The White Hart Inn. George Yard Buildings, a block of tenement flats built in 1876, were on the western side of the alley, near the northern end to the back of Toynbee Hall. Pearly Poll and her client went to the parallel Angel Alley.

===Murder===

In the early hours of the following morning, a resident of the Buildings, one Mrs. Hewitt, was awoken by cries of &quot;Murder!&quot;, but domestic violence and shouts of that nature were common in the area and she ignored the noise. At 2:00 a.m., two other residents, husband and wife Joseph and Elizabeth Mahoney, returned to the Buildings and saw no one on the stairs. At the same time, the patrolling beat officer, PC Thomas Barrett, questioned a grenadier loitering nearby, who replied that he was waiting for a friend. At 3:30 a.m., resident Albert George Crow returned home after a night&#x27;s work as a cab driver and noticed Tabram&#x27;s body lying on a landing above the first flight of stairs. The landing was so dimly lit that he mistook her for a sleeping vagrant and it was not until just before 5:00 a.m. that a resident coming down the stairs on his way to work, dock labourer John Saunders Reeves, realised she was dead.

Reeves fetched Barrett, who sent for Dr. Timothy Robert Killeen to examine the body. Killeen arrived at about 5:30 a.m. and estimated that Tabram had been dead for around 3 hours. Her killer had stabbed her 39 times in the body and neck, including nine times in the throat, five in the left lung, two in the right lung, one in the heart, five in the liver, two in the spleen, and six in the stomach, also wounding her lower abdomen and genitals. She was lying on her back and her clothing was raised to her middle, exposing her lower half, which indicated the body lay in a sexual position. Killeen, however, could supply no evidence of intercourse. The testimony of the residents and Dr Killeen indicated that Tabram was killed between 2:00 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. Residents had seen and heard nothing amiss between these times.

==Investigation==
The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police Force, Edmund Reid of H Division Whitechapel, was in charge of the investigation. He arranged for PC Barrett to visit the Tower of London on 7 August in the hope that Barrett could identify the man he had seen standing in the street. Barrett did not recognise any of the men. A parade of all the soldiers on leave on the night of the murder was arranged at the Tower on 8 August, and this time PC Barrett picked out a man. On being asked to re-examine his choice, Barrett picked out another man, and the first was allowed to leave. Barrett explained his change of heart by stating that the man he had seen in George Yard had no medals, whereas the man he had selected at first did. Barrett&#x27;s second choice, John Leary, claimed that on the night of the murder he had gone drinking in Brixton with a buddy, Private Law. According to Leary, they had missed each other at closing time and he had gone for a walk before meeting up with Law in the Strand at about 4:30 a.m., whereupon they had another drink in Billingsgate before returning to the Tower. Law was interviewed, separately from Leary, and his version of the night&#x27;s events corresponded exactly with Leary&#x27;s. On the strength of their corroborating statements and because of Barrett&#x27;s uncertain identification, Leary and Law were dismissed from the inquiry. Another soldier from the Tower, Corporal Benjamin, who was absent without leave, was also dismissed from the investigation after it transpired that he had been visiting his father in Kingston-upon-Thames.

Connelly was not wholly cooperative with police and hid with a cousin for a while near Drury Lane, not coming forward until 9 August. She missed an identity parade arranged at the Tower for 10 August, but attended the rescheduled one on the 13th. Connelly failed to recognise the clients and claimed that the men that night had worn white cap-bands. As such bands were worn only by the Coldstream Guards, rather than the Grenadier Guards at the Tower, Connelly was taken to another identity parade at Wellington Barracks on the 15th, where she picked out two soldiers, but both had solid alibis. One had been at home with his wife, while the other had been in the barracks.

Tabram&#x27;s body was formally identified by her estranged husband on 14 August. At the time of her death, she was wearing a black bonnet, a long black jacket, a dark green skirt, a brown petticoat and stockings, and spring-sided boots showing considerable wear. She was tall and had dark hair. The inquest into her death was concluded by deputy coroner for South-East Middlesex George Collier on 23 August at the Working Lad&#x27;s Institute, Whitechapel Road, with a verdict of murder by person or persons unknown. No suspect was ever arrested for Tabram&#x27;s murder.

==Jack the Ripper==
Contemporary newspaper reports published at the beginning of September linked Tabram&#x27;s murder to those of Emma Elizabeth Smith on 3 April and Mary Ann Nichols on 31 August, though before she died, Smith had told the police that a gang had attacked her. The later killings of Annie Chapman on 8 September, of both Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes on 30 September and of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November were also linked at the time to Tabram&#x27;s. The last five murders mentioned are now generally referred to as the &quot;canonical five&quot; victims of Jack the Ripper. All were knife murders of impoverished prostitutes in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts, generally perpetrated in darkness in the small hours of the morning, in a secluded site to which the public could gain access, and which occurred on or close to a weekend or holiday.

The police did not connect the murder with Smith&#x27;s, but they did connect her death with the later five murders. Later students of the Ripper murders have largely excluded Tabram from the list of Ripper victims, chiefly because her throat was not cut in the manner of later victims, nor was she eviscerated. This view was advanced by Sir Melville Macnaghten, Assistant Chief Constable of the Metropolitan Police Service Criminal Investigation Department, who implied that Tabram was murdered by an unidentified soldier or soldiers in an 1894 memorandum on the murders. Dr Killeen, who performed the post mortem on Tabram, strengthened this belief with his opinion that two weapons were used—one of Tabram&#x27;s wounds, which penetrated the chest bone, was inflicted with a weapon longer and stouter than the others, a dagger or possibly a bayonet, while the others were inflicted with a shorter, slimmer knife.

Several 20th-century psychological reports have assumed Mary Ann Nichols to have been Jack the Ripper&#x27;s first victim, but add that her murder was unlikely to have been his first attack. Some have suggested the Ripper may have murdered Tabram before perfecting his &quot;modus operandi&quot; of overpowering and cutting the throats of his victims. Other researchers, however, such as Philip Sugden in &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot;, and Sean Day in Peter Underwood&#x27;s &quot;Jack the Ripper: One Hundred Years of Mystery&quot;, do view Tabram as a probable Ripper victim.

Sir Melville Macnaghten was only actively involved in the Whitechapel murders investigation between 1889 and 1891; thus, his notes reflect only the opinions of some police officers at the time and include several factual errors in the information presented pertaining to possible suspects. Serial killers have been known to have changed their murder weapons, but especially to develop their &quot;modus operandi&quot; over time, as the Ripper did with increasingly severe mutilations. While the five canonical Ripper murders were located roughly north, south, east and west of Whitechapel, Tabram&#x27;s murder occurred close to their geographic centre. It is possible that her murder was one of the first committed by the Ripper before he had chosen his later &quot;modus operandi&quot;.

In 1998 an Australian researcher, Ted Linn, produced his findings in a booklet called &quot;The Case of the Redhanded Copycat&quot;, in which he outlines his case that Martha&#x27;s husband, Henry Samuel Tabram, was the real Ripper. He bases this on cryptographic clues he claims to have found in letters written by the Ripper and other evidence.

<doc id="1255794" wikidata="Q1945493" url="?curid=1255794" title="Ford Focus RS WRC">
<text>The Ford Focus RS WRC is a car built for the Ford World Rally Team by Ford Europe and M-Sport and based on the Ford Focus Climate 2-litre production hatchback, developed to compete in the World Rally Championship. The RS stands for &quot;Rallye Sport&quot; and the WRC for &quot;World Rally Car&quot;, the car&#x27;s FIA specification. The Focus RS WRC was in competition from 1999 to 2010, winning 44 world rallies and two manufacturers&#x27; world titles (2006 and 2007). It was replaced by the Ford Fiesta RS WRC.

Like all contemporary World Rally Cars, the car is heavily modified from the production version, with which it shares only the basic shape and some parts of the bodyshell. The car features four-wheel drive, rather than the front-wheel drive of the road car. The engine used in the 2007 Focus WRC is based on Ford&#x27;s 2.0 Litre Duratec from other models in the Focus range as rallying rules do not permit the standard 2.5-litre engine of the Focus ST or road going RS. As with most rally cars, the 2.0-litre engine is heavily modified and performance was increased using a turbocharger. The 2009 Ford Focus RS WRC uses a Ford 1998cc Pipo built I4 Duratec WRC engine (four cylinders, 16 valves, bore 85 mm and stroke 88 mm), Pi electronic engine management system, Garrett turbocharger (with required 34 mm inlet restrictor), air intercooler, and a catalytic converter.

The car&#x27;s transmission is a permanent four-wheel drive with an M-Sport designed active centre differential, Pi electronic differential control units, M-Sport/Ricardo five-speed sequential gearbox with electro-hydraulically controlled shift and an M-Sport/Sachs multi-disc carbon clutch.

==History==
The first version of the car was built in 1999 to replace the Ford Escort WRC. It debuted in the Monte Carlo Rally with Colin McRae and Simon Jean-Joseph behind the wheels of the two cars. It was immediately on the pace, setting many fastest stage times, but the use of an illegal water pump meant that the two cars were excluded from the event. McRae gave the Focus its first win two events later on the Safari Rally Kenya finishing over 15 minutes ahead of the second placed Toyota of Didier Auriol. Despite coming close on several occasions, the car never won either the drivers or manufacturers title. This included McRae losing the 2001 title by 2 points after crashing out of the final round.

In 2003, Ford released a newly designed Focus RS WRC, named Focus RS WRC 03, for competition during the second part of the season. The car, with most parts redesigned from the ground up, featured a lighter body shell and a new aerodynamically enhanced front bumper and wing. Markko Märtin drove the car to two world rally victories. The 2004 and 2005 Focus RS WRCs were evolutions based on the RS WRC 03. The Focus RS WRC 04 won three events with Märtin at the wheel. By 2005, the car was no longer very competitive and Ford had a winless season.

From the last rally of the 2005 season, Ford campaigned a brand new model, the Focus RS WRC 06, following the launch of the new road-going version of the car. The engine chosen for this Focus was a Duratec motor developed by the French engine specialist Pipo Moteur. In the hands of Marcus Grönholm and Mikko Hirvonen, the car took eight world rally wins in the 2006 season, winning the first manufacturers&#x27; championship for Ford since 1979.
The Focus RS WRC 07 is based on the 2006 model, and according to Ford&#x27;s technical director Christian Loriaux &quot;the changes on the new car are mainly to save weight and to improve efficiency, driveability and performance at the bottom end of the range.&quot; The car debuted very successfully at the 2007 Rally Finland as Ford&#x27;s Finns Grönholm and Mikko Hirvonen finished in first and second. Ford successfully defended the manufacturers&#x27; championship in 2007. The car later made history at the 2008 Swedish Rally when Jari-Matti Latvala used it to become the youngest-ever driver to win a world rally.

The Focus RS WRC 08 is based on the 2007 model. The Focus WRC 08 was in competition for the first time with its new front aero design at the 2008 Rallye Deutschland. The 2008 version of the Focus RS WRC includes design style changes as well as engine improvements. Style changes to the grill area reflect the looks of the recently previewed Focus RS Mk II road sport car. The 2008 RS WRC was driven to its only victory at the 2008 Rally Japan.

The 2009 version of the Focus RS WRC debuted at the 2009 Rally d&#x27;Italia Sardegna, leading Ford to a 1-2. It includes small design style changes. Style changes were made to the lights frame and rear bumper to bring the look closer to the Focus RS Mk II 2009 road sport car. The 2009 Focus RS WRC remained the last of Ford&#x27;s WRC cars based on the Focus. It was replaced by the Ford Fiesta RS WRC after the 2010 season.

The Ford Focus RS WRC appeared in 173 World Rally Championship events, winning 44 and collecting 142 podium places.

<text>Tracey Jane McAndrew (born 6 November 1973), known as Nell McAndrew, is an English glamour model, TV presenter and fitness trainer. She is also an accomplished amateur athlete, with a marathon personal best time of 2:54:39. She was named Yorkshire Woman of the Year in 2003 and won Rear of the Year in 2005.

==Early life==
McAndrew was born in Leeds on 6 November 1973. She has an older sister and two younger brothers. After leaving school she briefly worked as a clerk for the Yorkshire Bank.

==Career==
McAndrew first signed up with a modelling agency as the result of a suggestion by her hairdresser. She started her modelling career as a catalogue and magazine model and as a Marilyn Monroe lookalike. For a modelling assignment in Germany, she was required to shave her head. In the UK, she first appeared on television as one of the hostesses on the game show &quot;Man O Man&quot; in 1996. She later appeared in the &quot;Daily Star&quot; as a Page 3 girl but it was her role as the Lara Croft model for the video game &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; between 1998 and 1999 that brought her to the public&#x27;s attention. McAndrew was fired from her stint as Croft in 1999 after posing nude for &quot;Playboy&quot;. This was partly due to &quot;Playboy&quot; printing references to Lara Croft and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; on the cover, which were removed when Eidos, the maker of the game, threatened a lawsuit.

She has since enjoyed a successful career as a glamour model, frequently appearing in &quot;FHM&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;Loaded&quot;. She has also appeared in fitness magazines, including &quot;Shape&quot; and &quot;Personal Trainer&quot;.

McAndrew, affectionately referred to as a forces sweetheart, has visited the British Armed Forces at bases all over the world.

She has had a television career as a presenter on &quot;Racing Rivals&quot;, &quot;Born to Fight&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot; and &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;. She has been a contestant on various gameshows and reality shows including &quot;Fort Boyard&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, &quot;Celebrities Under Pressure&quot;, &quot;Family Fortunes&quot; and &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;.

Her first fitness video, &quot;Peak Energy&quot; was released in 2002 and became a best seller. It was followed up by &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; in December 2003 and &quot;Ultimate Challenge, Ultimate Results&quot; in December 2004.

In 2003 she was voted the &quot;Yorkshire Woman of the Year&quot; and in 2005 she won Rear of the Year.

McAndrew has been part of a number of PR campaigns for Yorkshire Water, including a digital version of her in their Sewer Raider item on the company website. She also fronted an advertising campaign for Activia Yoghurt.

In January 2009, McAndrew helped Benenden Healthcare Society, a mutual not-for-profit healthcare organisation, launch their &quot;Fresh Start, Get on Track&quot; campaign, appearing in nationwide radio interviews and online webchats.

==Sport==
McAndrew&#x27;s time in the 2005 London Marathon was fast enough that she qualified to run in the British Championship women&#x27;s race in future events.

For the 2008 Great North Run, she competed with the fun runners dressed as Wonder Woman to help raise funds for charity.

In March 2012 McAndrew was the first woman across the finish line in the five-mile National Lottery Olympic Park Run in a personal best time of 29 minutes and 21 seconds.

With a marathon personal best time of 3:08:25, McAndrew was aiming for her first sub-three-hour marathon in the 2012 London Marathon: &quot;2:59:59 I&#x27;d be ecstatic, but if I could get anything under 3:08 I&#x27;ve still got a personal best, which is still amazing, but it&#x27;s just that kind of magic number of three hours ... I just want to get under that three hours.&quot; She went on to finish the race in 2:54:39, beating her previous personal best by 13 minutes and 46 seconds. Subsequently commentators Steve Cram and Brendan Foster noted that only 88 British women had run a sub-3-hour marathon during 2011. It was 47th fastest time by a British woman that year and the 9th fastest by a British woman over 35.

On 11 September 2016, she took part in the Great North Run to raise funds for Alzheimer&#x27;s Society and Cancer Research UK.

==Personal life==

After announcing their engagement in September 2004, McAndrew married property developer Paul Hardcastle twice: first in November 2004 in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England, then again at a marriage blessing in December 2004 in Dubai. McAndrew and her husband have a son, Devon, born on 24 August 2006.

In March 2009 she revealed that she was still breastfeeding her son, and talked about the criticisms she was receiving for this practice.

McAndrew gave birth to a second child, a daughter, in March 2013.

==Charitable activity==
McAndrew has supported a range of charities including Breast cancer awareness, Help the Aged, the British Heart Foundation, DEBRA, Cancer Research UK, the Lymphoma Association and SSAFA. She is also a Vice president of the Leeds Rugby Foundation charity.

Launching the Cancer Research UK Race for Life 2008 in London&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park, she joined a group of other women whose training outfits were painted on their bodies.

McAndrew ran for the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society in the Bupa Great North Run in Newcastle in September 2010. In March 2012 she set a personal best half marathon time of 1:21.54 whilst running for Cancer Research UK at the Bath Half Marathon.

<doc id="1255798" wikidata="Q5158851" url="?curid=1255798" title="Concord Repatriation General Hospital">
<text>Concord Repatriation General Hospital (abbreviated CRGH), commonly referred to as Concord Hospital, is a district general hospital in Sydney, Australia, on Hospital Road in Concord. It is a teaching hospital of Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney, where it is referred to as Concord Clinical School, and a major facility in the Sydney Local Health District and the former Sydney South West Area Health Service. The NSW Statewide Severe Burn Injury Service and the Bernie Banton Centre, an asbestos diseases research institute, are located there.

Parts of the television series &quot;All Saints&quot; were filmed at CRGH.

==History==
Prior to the Second World War, the Yaralla Estate on which the hospital is built belonged to philanthropist Thomas Walker and subsequently his daughter Dame Eadith Walker. A small hospital had already been established on the site, known as the Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital. Following the death of Dame Eadith in 1937, the property was bequeathed to the Crown for development as a public hospital.

The current hospital was commissioned in 1939 as a general hospital for the Australian Army and opened on 11 March 1941. When completed in 1942, the 2,000-bed Yaralla Military Hospital (113th Australian General Hospital [A.G.H.]) was the largest hospital in the Southern Hemisphere. The main hospital building (currently known as the Multi Building) was one of the tallest buildings in Sydney when completed and its design won architects Stephenson &amp; Turner the Sulman Award in 1946.

Following the war, the hospital became a repatriation hospital for returned servicemen under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth government, with a change in name to Repatriation General Hospital, Concord (RGHC). In 1963, RGHC became a teaching hospital of the University of Sydney.

Recognising the growing community need, the hospital began providing care for general community patients in 1974, including the opening of an emergency department in 1977. In 1993, the hospital was transferred to the Central Sydney Area Health Service of the New South Wales Department of Health as a public hospital and renamed to the current Concord Repatriation General Hospital.

==Memorials==
Although it is no longer under the jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs, the hospital retains a historical significance to the veterans community in New South Wales. A number of memorials maintain these links, including:

*Australian Hospital Ship &quot;Centaur&quot; memorial, a stained-glass window adjacent to the main entrance of the hospital
*Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway and memorial rose garden, forming the major part of the designated route for commuting to/from Rhodes railway station.
*Anzac Day remembrance services

==Future==
During mid-2006, construction work commenced on a new mental health precinct at the northern end of the hospital grounds. On completion the Sydney South West Area Mental Health Service (SSWAHMS) will relocate the majority of its existing services from The Rozelle Hospital to the new facilities at CRGH.

<doc id="1255803" wikidata="Q7244522" url="?curid=1255803" title="Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane">
<text>The Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) is a major Australian teaching hospital of the University of Queensland, located in Brisbane, Queensland. It is a tertiary level teaching hospital with all major medical and surgical specialities onsite except for obstetrics, gynaecology, paediatrics, and medical genetics. It has a catchment population of 1.6 million people with 1038 beds and 5,800 full-time equivalent staff. In 2005, the hospital received Magnet Recognition.

The hospital is located on Ipswich Road in Woolloongabba, an inner-city suburb of Brisbane.

==History==

The hospital is built on the site of the 1883 Diamantina Orphanage, named after Diamantina Bowen, wife of the first Governor of Queensland, and the former Queensland School for the Deaf, which closed in 1988. In 1901, it became Diamantina Hospital for Chronic Diseases. In 1943, it became the South Brisbane Auxiliary Hospital and then the South Brisbane Hospital in 1956.

In 1959, it became the Princess Alexandra Hospital and was opened by and named after HRH Princess Alexandra, to mark the Centennial of Queensland. In 2000, a new building was opened to replace the ageing red-brick hospital complex built in the 1950s. The current emergency department is situated on the site of the former nurses&#x27; quarters building, while the demolished pathology wing was located at the front of the campus off Ipswich Road.

Major milestones for the hospital included: opening of its first short-stay medical assessment unit in 1960, dialysis unit in 1963, ICU in 1964 (which was a 12-bed bay in the operating theatre recovery area), spinal unit in 1965, renal transplant unit in 1969, and coronary care unit in 1971. 

==Electronic health records==
It was the first hospital in Queensland to be fully digitised in 2016, a process led by Dr Stephen Ayre, a former general practitioner, who was then the executive director. Observations and vital signs from patient monitoring devices are automatically uploaded to patient records. All records are visible to all clinicians. Within a year this resulted in significant benefits:
* 14% fewer drug administration and monitoring errors 
* 33% fewer drug dispensing and supply incidents, 
* 17% fewer emergency readmissions within 28 days of discharge, 
* drug costs per weighted activity unit came down by 14%, 
* 56% fewer stage 3 &amp; 4 hospital-acquired pressure ulcers
* healthcare associated infections down 37%. 
* early identification of deteriorating patients went up by 59%.

==Units==
Queensland&#x27;s spinal injuries unit and the liver and kidney transplantation services are based at the hospital. The Cardiothoracic Surgery Unit opened in 1998. In the following years the unit performed more than 10,000 operations.

===Emergency department expansion===

From 2009 to 2011 major expansion works were undertaken, including the doubling in size of the emergency department, the construction of a helipad with express elevators, and new oncology bunkers for cancer treatment.

==Centres==
The P.A. Hospital Foundation is located at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. The foundation raises money for medical research on the P.A. Hospital campus. In April 2008, the Diamantina Institute for Cancer, Immunology and Metabolic Medicine was opened at the hospital. In July 2011, the Diamantina Health Partners, Queensland&#x27;s first academic health science centre, was opened. The Diamantina Health Partners head office is located within the Translational Research Institute on the P.A. Hospital campus. In mid-2014, the Diamantina Health Partners joined with the Mayne Health Science Alliance and Children&#x27;s Health Queensland to form the Brisbane Diamantina Health Partners Academic Health Science System, also housed within the Translational Research Institute on the Princess Alexandra Hospital campus.
The hospital is the state centre of excellence for renal transplant, liver transplant, trauma surgery and spinal injuries.

==Transport==
The PA Hospital can be accessed by the dedicated PA Hospital busway station, the Dutton Park Railway Station and by buses on Ipswich Road or Cornwall Street. A taxi rank is also located on Ipswich Road. In March 2008 a new 1400 bay car park was opened to service visitors and staff parking needs.

<doc id="1255815" wikidata="Q7517196" url="?curid=1255815" title="Silylene">
<text>Silylene is a chemical compound with the formula SiR2. It is the silicon analog of carbene. Due to presence of a vacant p orbital, silylene rapidly reacts in a bimolecular manner when condensed. Unlike carbenes, which can exist in the singlet or triplet state, silylene (and all of its derivatives) are singlets.

Silylenes are formal derivatives of silylene with its hydrogens replaced by other substituents. Most examples feature amido (NR2) or alkyl/aryl groups.
Silylenes have been proposed as reactive intermediates. They are carbene analogs.

==Synthesis and properties==
Silylenes are generally synthesized by thermolysis or photolysis of polysilanes, by silicon atom reactions (insertion, addition or abstraction), by pyrolysis of silanes, or by reduction of 1,1-dihalosilane. It has long been assumed that the conversion of metallic Si to tetravalent silicon compounds proceeds via silylene intermediates:
:Si + Cl2 → SiCl2
:SiCl2 + Cl2 → SiCl4
Similar considerations apply to the direct process, the reaction of methyl chloride and bulk silicon.

Early observations of silylenes involved generation of dimethylsilylene by dechlorination of dimethyldichlorosilane:
:SiCl2(CH3)2 + 2 K → Si(CH3)2 + 2 KCl
The formation of dimethylsilylene was demonstrated by conducting the dechlorination in the presence of trimethylsilane, the trapped product being pentamethyldisilane:
:Si(CH3)2 + HSi(CH3)3 → (CH3)2Si(H)−Si(CH3)3

A room-temperature isolable &quot;N&quot;-heterocyclic silylene is , first described in 1994 by Michael K. Denk et al.
The α-amido centers stabilize silylenes by π-donation. The dehalogenation of diorganosilicon dihalides is a widely exploited.

==Related reactions==
In one study diphenylsilylene is generated by flash photolysis of a trisilane:

In this reaction diphenylsilylene is extruded from the trisila ring. The silylene can be observed with UV spectroscopy at 520 nm and is short-lived with a chemical half-life of two microseconds. Added methanol acts as a chemical trap with a second order rate constant of which is close to diffusion control.

<doc id="1255817" wikidata="Q1070642" url="?curid=1255817" title="Chessington World of Adventures">
<text>Chessington World of Adventures Resort is a theme park, zoo and hotel complex in Chessington, Greater London, England, around southwest of Central London. The complex originally opened as Chessington Zoo in 1931; the theme park aspect was developed by The Tussauds Group, debuting on 7 July 1987 as one of the first combined animal-amusement parks in the UK. The theme park, which features over 40 rides, is now owned by Merlin Entertainments, following its merger with The Tussauds Group in 2007. Under Merlin, Chessington has been increasingly developed into a resort and tourist destination, including two on-site hotels, swimming pools, a campground, spa and fitness facilities.

The Chessington Zoo has over 1,000 animals, including western lowland gorillas, sea lions, and Sumatran tigers. It is split up into several areas; Trail of the Kings, Sea Lion Bay, Children&#x27;s Zoo, Amazu, Penguin Bay, a Sea Life Centre and Wanyama Village and Reserve.

Chessington World of Adventures was ranked in 2022 as the twentieth most-visited park in the UK, with an attendance of roughly 1.5 million guests, behind Alton Towers, Thorpe Park and Legoland Windsor. In 2020, due to restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the park experienced an unexpectedly short operating season and temporarily closed its gates. Despite a significant drop in attendance during the pandemic, Chessington actually ranked as the third most-visited park in the UK for 2020 with .51 million visitors, behind Alton Towers and Thorpe Park.

Chessington World of Adventures is separated into different themed areas, loosely inspired by a range of world cultures. ‘Adventure Point’ is a colonial English &quot;market square&quot;,&#x27;‘Mexicana&#x27; borrows from the Wild West and Latin America, &#x27;Shipwreck Coast&#x27; is a nautical harbour town, &#x27;Wild Woods&#x27; is a Central European-styled area with Bavarian architecture, &#x27;Forbidden Kingdom&#x27; mirrors the ancient Middle East, &#x27;Land of the Tiger&#x27; reflects the Far East, and &#x27;Wild Asia&#x27; is based on an Indian jungle. Major attractions include: Vampire, Dragon&#x27;s Fury, KOBRA, Tiger Rock, The Gruffalo River Ride Adventure, Mandrill Mayhem, and Croc Drop.

==History==

The mansion at Chessington World of Adventures Resort known today as the Burnt Stub was originally built in 1348, in Chessington, Surrey. In the English Civil War it became a royalist stronghold, and Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Parliamentary forces razed it to the ground. The Burnt Stub site was rebuilt as an inn, until the 18th century, when the Vere Barker family rebuilt it in neo-gothic Victorian style.

===Founding of zoo===
The resort has its roots in Chessington Zoo, which opened in 1931; it was started by Reginald Stuart Goddard, who had bought the estate to showcase his private collection of animals. It was once the largest private zoo in England. After Goddard died in 1946, the Pearson Publishing Company took over the zoo and managed it until 1978, when The Tussauds Group, a subsidiary of the Pearson Group, took control.

===Founding of theme park===
In 1984, due to the zoo&#x27;s declining attendance, Tussauds&#x27;s commissioned John Wardley to come up with plans to revitalize the park. Wardley had a huge influence on the rides being created at both Chessington and its sister parks Thorpe Park and Alton Towers. The decision was made to open a theme park to complement the zoo, and so Chessington World of Adventures was born. On 7 July 1987 Chessington World of Adventures opened to the public in a ceremony including Prince Edward. The park was built on a relatively small budget of around £12 million, to test the still-emerging theme park market.

In its first year, the park opened with the roller coaster &quot;Runaway Mine Train&quot;, the log flume &quot;Dragon River&quot;, the monorail &quot;Safari Skyway&quot;, the dark ride &quot;The 5th Dimension&quot;, and the &quot;Chessington Railroad&quot; as the main attractions (all supplied by the German ride manufacturer Heinrich Mack GmbH &amp; Co). Smuggler&#x27;s Galleon (a swinging ride) reached heights of 20 meters; it was later renamed Black Buccaneer.

The new park development adopted a pay-once price structure as opposed to the fairground&#x27;s former pay-per-ride format. Other support rides were also opened and the park opened five themed areas: Calamity Canyon, Mystic East, Market Square, Toy Town and Circus World.

The 1990 season expanded Chessington with the opening of the Transylvania area, featuring &quot;The Vampire&quot; (opening and still operating as the only suspended rollercoaster outside of America) and &quot;Prof. Burp&#x27;s Bubble Works&quot;. Both of these major rides had a significant and positive impact on the park&#x27;s popularity. By this time &quot;Smugglers&#x27; Galleon&quot; and the Smugglers&#x27; Cove area had been created.

The 1995 season arrived with &quot;Rameses Revenge&quot;, the park&#x27;s first inverting ride. &quot;Rameses Revenge&quot; was new in the Forbidden Kingdom area; an area which had opened the previous year in conjunction with the &quot;Terror Tomb&quot; dark ride. Also new for 1995 was &quot;Seastorm&quot; in Pirates&#x27; Cove, and the &quot;Carousel&quot;, located next to the explorer gate. By 1997, the park had a maximum capacity of 15,000 guests.

In 1999, Chessington opened the hardcore thrill ride &quot;Samurai&quot; in the Mystic East. 1999 also saw the rename of Calamity Canyon into Mexicana, following the opening of &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; the year before. Beanoland, bringing two new rides to the park: &quot;Billy&#x27;s Whizzer&quot; and &quot;Rodger the Dodger&#x27;s Dodgems&quot; was built in 2000 on the former site of Circus World 

===Development as resort===

On 22 May 2007, The Tussauds Group was taken over by Merlin Entertainments Ltd, which owns other brands such as Sea Life Centres. Besides Chessington, Merlin also purchased Alton Towers, the nearby Thorpe Park, and Madame Tussauds, which made Merlin the second largest entertainment operator in the world in terms of attendance numbers, behind Disney. As Chessington World of Adventures and Thorpe Park are located within 20 miles of each other, Merlin Entertainments has made efforts to market the two parks to different age groups: Thorpe Park caters to teenagers and young adults, while Chessington World of Adventures Resort is for families and people of all ages. In June 2007, the park opened the &quot;Safari Hotel&quot; next to Chessington Zoo, themed to a safari lodge. 2008 saw the opening of the Chessington Sea Life Centre.

Also in 2010, the Wanyama reserve was opened, giving the Africa-themed Safari hotel guests a view of animals. The Wild Asia area was also added, with its KOBRA ride. In 2011 the Ocean Tunnel and surrounding rooms in the Sea Life Centre were re-themed to Azteca. In 2012 a new land themed to Africa replaced ToyTown. In 2013, Chessington introduced &quot;&quot;, with visitors touring the area in a safari truck. In the same year, the annual Halloween Hocus Pocus event included a new attraction, &quot;The Mystery of Hocus Pocus Hall&quot;, featuring projection-mapped visual effects.

In 2014, &quot;nearly £15 million&quot; was invested in the resort as the whole, with a new wing built next to the Safari Hotel, advertised as a second standalone hotel, named &quot;Azteca Hotel&quot;. The Safari Hotel also received a second pool.

==Theme park==

Chessington World of Adventures opened on 6 July 1987. Its main ethos centres around the idea of bringing together a collection of the different cultures and experiences from around the world; a considerable amount of the park is built on the stereotypical setting of each area it is focused on. Major attractions include: &quot;Vampire&quot;, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Fury&quot;, &quot;KOBRA&quot;, &quot;&quot;, Scorpion Express, Mandrill Mayhem and &quot;Croc Drop&quot;.

The theme park comprises 11 themed lands, each with a cultural setting. The central area of the park, Adventure Point, resembles an old English market town, whereas Land of the Tiger is themed around China with the water ride Tiger Rock being there since 1987, but being rethemed to Tiger Rock (and the surrounding area) in 2018. Mexicana is inspired by a small town in America&#x27;s old far-west. Shipwreck Coast is a nautical adventure land. Wild Woods is modeled on a central European high street with Bavaria in Germany and the Transylvania region of Romania as its key influences. Forbidden Kingdom is based on Ancient Egypt with hieroglyphics carved onto its surroundings. Wanyama Village and Reserve is based on an African Safari, and the Rainforest is based on the Amazon. Land of the Dragons is one of the two &quot;fantasy&quot; themed area of the theme park and is a self-contained dragon-themed land with rides mostly for young children except for Dragons Fury, a big spinning rollercoaster that surrounds the area. The other one is World of Jumanji, which is based on the movies of the same name, with mostly thrill rides in the area.

Among the newer lands is Wild Asia which opened in 2010 as a replacement for Beanoland with an Indian jungle theme. In 2017, the existing Transylvania area was renamed &quot;Wild Woods&quot; in conjunction with the opening of The Gruffalo River Ride Adventure. In 2018, Mystic East was renamed &quot;Land of the Tiger&quot;, with the addition of new tiger enclosures and the partial refurbishment of Dragon Falls as Tiger Rock.

Shipwreck Coast is an area adjacent to Adventure Point, originally themed to a Cornish fishing village. Rides include the Blue Barnacle, a swinging pirate ship and &quot;Seastorm&quot;, a circular family boat ride that simulates a sea storm.

These are &quot;Barrel Bail Out&quot;, a watermania ride and &quot;Trawler Trouble&quot;, a Rockin&#x27; Tug relocated from Thorpe Park.

===Land of the Tiger===

In July 2017, Chessington filed for planning permission to partially redesign the area to include new tiger enclosures, including walkways over guests&#x27; heads, and a new themed feature for the log flume, to be renamed &quot;Tiger Rock&quot;. The park&#x27;s ferris wheel Peeking Heights was demolished to make way for the tiger enclosures. The area closed for redevelopment on 10 September 2017, reopened in 2018. The ride has two drops, one with a rock tunnel, the other going through a tiger rock mouth. The area has been re-decorated and re-designed, with a new entrance by Land of the Dragons and Wild Asia.

===Wild Woods===

The area, originally named &#x27;Transylvania&#x27;, was created in 1990, modeled on a mock Barvarian town street, with tall European Architecture.

For 2006, it was rethemed to an Imperial Leather toiletries factory. Bubbleworks closed on 6 September 2016 and was replaced by &quot;The Gruffalo River Ride Adventure&quot; in March 2017.

The area was created as a quaint, &#x27;Central-European&#x27; town square to one side, where the entrance to &quot;Prof. Burp&#x27;s BubbleWorks&quot;, shops and eateries were located amongst the town buildings, then a path set back from the town leads to the castle entrance of &quot;The Vampire&quot;. After the park&#x27;s various changes of management, the area was repeatedly changed in a piecemeal fashion to more of a haunted Halloween style, though most of the fascia remains under various repaints and alterations. Vampire&#x27;s entrance was moved to an unthemed metal archway in 2001 and the original BubbleWorks entrance recycled as a &#x27;Fastrack&#x27; queue in recent years.

Opening in 2002 &quot;Tomb Blaster&quot; is a dark ride shoot out game where riders shoot laser guns at targets and is a retheme of the &#x27;Terror Tomb&#x27; dark ride. One side of Forbidden Kingdom is architecturally designed as an Arabic market town, while Tomb Blaster is set in an Ancient Egyptian courtyard tomb area, though much detail has been removed throughout the area over the years.

The second attraction located in Forbidden Kingdom is a brand new family drop tower &quot;Croc Drop&quot;. The ride opened as a replacement to Rameses Revenge in March 2021, and is themed around the Egyptian crocodile god Sobek. The ride&#x27;s slogan is, ‘Brave the drop, release the curse!’

===Land of the Dragons===
Land of the Dragons is the park&#x27;s main children&#x27;s area. Opening in 2004, it is a self-contained, dragon-themed land containing rides and attractions designed to appeal to very young children apart from one. It is one of the two areas of the park not themed to a time or place from world culture. There are two play areas in the land: &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, a large soft play area, and adjacent to this is &quot;Canopy Capers&quot;, an outdoor treehouse rope bridge attraction. &quot;Griffin&#x27;s Galleon&quot; is a Kontiki rock&#x27;n&#x27;tug ride and &quot;Sea Dragons&quot; is a spinning boat ride.

Aside from the children&#x27;s attractions, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Fury&quot; is an intense spinning roller coaster encompassing the area with its layout.

===Wild Asia===

Wild Asia, opened in early 2010 as a loosely Indian-themed jungle area, with temple ruins and ancient statues the area is a retheme of the old &#x27;Beanoland&#x27; area themed to the Beano children&#x27;s comic books. The attraction &quot;Lorikeet Lagoon&quot; opened with the area in 2010 as part of Chessington&#x27;s plan to add zoo enclosures within the theme park, visitors may feed the lorikeets nectar. The area has a number of thrill rides, including &quot;KOBRA&quot;, a Zamperla flat ride that opened in 2010, &quot;Monkey Swinger&quot; a wave swinger with a water element that opened in 2000, &quot;Tuk Tuk Turmoil&quot; bumper cars, which are themed as Asian rickshaw tuk tuks. The last attraction in the area is &quot;Temple of Mayhem&quot;, an indoor play area where children can fire foam balls, with a minimum age limit of 4 years and a maximum height restriction of 1.4m. The area did feature a small Zamperla magic carpet ride themed around tours of the jungle called &quot;Jungle Bus&quot;, which was replaced with a like-for-like ride system in 2022.

=== The Rainforest ===
The Rainforest is a small area aimed at families. Its architecture is recycled from the previous &quot;Toytown&quot; theme, with the original caricatured buildings redressed as African huts. Its previous name &quot;Africa&quot; has been home of the Madagascar franchise since opening in 2012. In 2020 it was refurbished as The Rainforest with a new mini log flume, River Rafts, relocated from Weymouth Sea Life Centre.

===Wanyama Village &amp; Reserve===
Wanyama Village &amp; Reserve is Chessington&#x27;s African area in the form of a large animal reserve. It has &quot;&quot; as the key attraction, a safari truck adventure through an undiscovered area of Africa. Making up part of the ZUFARI landscape is the Wanayama Village and Reserve, an African themed area of the zoo. The ZUFARI field and Wanyama Reserve are used as a backdrop to the Safari Hotel. ZUFARI&#x27;s total size is 22 acres and has flamingos, giraffe, ostrich, Nile lechwe, white rhino, Grevy&#x27;s zebra, scimitar horned oryx and sitatungas. Along the pathways of Zufari are various African-style paintings on fences. In the centre of the Wanyama section of ZUFARI is a large faux-stone carving of a lion. A winding waterfall runs along its side. The area&#x27;s name was changed in 2020 from ZUFARI to Wanyama Village &amp; Reserve.

===World of Jumanji===
Chessington&#x27;s newest themed area, &#x27;The World of Jumanji&#x27; opened on 15 May 2023, becoming Chessington&#x27;s 11th themed area. The area features a B&amp;M Shuttle Launched Wing coaster, Mandrill Mayhem and two SBF Visa Group attractions, Mamba Strike and Ostrich Stampede. As well as three rides, the area features extensive theming, immersive &#x27;carnival style&#x27; games, themed food and retail experiences, and finally play equipment and a treasure hunt around the area.

===The operating season===
The operating season usually starts around 20 March all the way to the start of November. Chessington usually opens around Christmas holidays and the February half terms for certain events, which include opening up some selective rides for those events.

==Zoo==
In 1931, Reginald Goddard opened the Chessington Zoo. In 1946 when Goddard died, the Pearson Publishing Company took over the zoo and managed it until 1978, when The Tussauds Group took control of the park. A number of animals were moved to other zoos during the construction of the theme park. In 1990 the polar bears left the park, as did the hippos and elephants in 1993. In 1994 the snow leopards were relocated to the lion and tiger area. For a time the attraction was called Animal Land, before returning to Chessington Zoo in 2007.

The zoo is generally open simultaneously with the theme park, but also remains open over the winter when the theme park is closed. Zoo entrance is included with the standard ticket price.

As of 2015 the zoo has over 1,000 animals, many of which are endangered and some being extinct in the wild. Chessington Zoo is split up into different areas and walkthroughs. The rhea, mara, wallabies, meerkats and agouti were previously the Monkey Walk area. Monkey Walk was replaced by Creatures Features which in turn was later replaced by the Wanyama Village in 2010. There is also a Children&#x27;s Zoo, where children may feed domestic farm animals.
The &quot;Safari Skyway&quot;, an elevated monorail with an entrance in the Market Square theme park area, takes riders around various animal enclosures at the zoo. The ride closed in 2015 due to cost of continued maintenance. An animal presentation in front of the Burnt Stub Mansion hosts the Animal Antics show at different times throughout the day. Near the entrance to the Zoo, there are enclosures for otters and reindeer. Chessington Zoo also has an area called Sealion Bay, which features sea lion presentations several times a day. 

The Trails of the Kings; a walkthrough attraction home to enclosures for western lowland gorillas, Asiatic lions, fossa, Carpathian lynx, and binturong. In 2007 the Trail of the Kings section of the zoo underwent an inspection with the outcome that the gorilla enclosure was too small. A bigger building for the gorillas was completed in 2010. As of 2013, there are 10 gorillas at Chessington, as well as two infants born in 2012.

The Wanyama Village &amp; Reserve opened in late May 2010, in an area behind the Safari Hotel and houses animals such as Grévy&#x27;s zebra, sitatunga antelope, ostrich, dorcas gazelle, Nile lechwe, fennec fox, dwarf mongoose, southern ground hornbill, Kirk&#x27;s dik-dik, Aloatran gentle lemur, black-cheeked lovebird, crested porcupine, meerkats, scimitar horned oryx, common eland and Ankole cattle. It is part of the ZUFARI animal reserve. The area is open to guests staying in the Safari Hotel during the evening.

The AMAZU Treetop Adventure opened in April 2014 on the former site of the Monkey &amp; Bird Garden. The area features adventure trail walkways, play areas and Aztec theming. The area has spider monkeys, saki monkeys, red-handed tamarins, golden-headed lion tamarins, Bolivian squirrel monkeys, Geoffroy marmosets, capybara, military macaws, Ecuadorian red-lored amazons, giant wood rail, agouti and three-banded armadillo. The animals in the area can either be viewed on ground or through the Amazu raised walkways, some of which, go through the enclosures.

Penguin Bay is a new area that opened in March 2015 as part of the Year of the Penguins. It features the long time residents of Chessington Zoo Humboldt penguins in a beach themed area. Seating for the demonstrations is aboard a shipwreck with a canopy. The new enclosure features glass walls to allow for better public viewing.

===Chessington Sea Life Centre===
In 2008, Chessington Zoo opened Chessington Sea Life Centre on the site of the old children&#x27;s Zoo, as an attempt to both determine if the park had a positive future and also to attract more multi-day visits. The Sea Life Centre, which is part of a franchise operated by Merlin Entertainments, has a number of exhibits including a Ray Pool and a touch pool. The Sea Life Centre is split into four areas: Our Shoreline, The Reef, Amazonia and Azteca which features the signature Ocean Tunnel.
&quot;Our Shoreline&quot; is the oldest area and has sea creatures found on the coast of Britain, featuring rays, seahorses and starfish. The area also has smaller exhibits including clownfish and crabs. The Touch Pool is also found here, in the centre of the area. The following area is named &quot;The Reef&quot;, which features clownfish, cleaner shrimp, regal tang, slipper lobster and upside-down jellyfish

Next to this area is Amazonia, which opened in 2009. It is a slightly smaller version of the same exhibit that has appeared at other Sea Life Centres. It includes red-bellied piranhas, common octopus, tetras and other, smaller exhibits.

Azteca opened in 2011, it features a 10-meter Ocean Tunnel, which has sea creatures including: bonnethead sharks, lion fish, starry pufferfish, surgeon fish, angle fish, catshark and epaulette shark. The tunnel existed before the 2011 addition but was redeveloped for the arrival of new fish. Aside from the Ocean Tunnel, Azteca also has jellyfish, seahorse and northern wolffish. The placement of the area has resulted in the division of the Our Shoreline area, which is now separated into two areas.

==Accommodation==
Currently, Chessington World of Adventures operate two on-site hotels and a Glamping experience.

===Safari Hotel===

The Safari Hotel is a four star hotel themed to appear like a Safari Lodge. It was originally named the Safari Lodge Hotel in 2007, before changing to the Chessington Resort Hotel in 2010. The hotel was then refurbished and relaunched for 2014 and has since been known simply as the Safari Hotel.

The hotel opened in June 2007 and was originally operated by Holiday Inn until it was fully taken over by Merlin Entertainments in May 2014. The hotel features various African elements with giraffe sculptures in the foyer and Zafari Bar &amp; Grill. The hotel&#x27;s check in area features a reptile enclose, which has a variety of animals housed in it depending on the time of year.

When the hotel was integrated as a resort in 2010, the Wanyama Village &amp; Reserve opened with access from the hotel.

===Azteca Hotel===

The Azteca Hotel is the newer of the two and opened in 2014. The hotel is four star and themed around an ancient aztec temple. The hotel has three floors, with each floor themed to a different level of the temple. The top floor (named &quot;Temple Summit&quot;) is decorated to give the impression that guests are on top of the structure looking out at the wildlife around.

The hotel&#x27;s &quot;Temple Restaurant&quot; has a heavy emphasis on special effects, with a large tower sitting in the centre of the room. Every thirty minutes, it makes a display of water fountains, it also features rapid lighting sequences and ultraviolet markings. Around the perimeter of the restaurant is a trail of leaf cutter ants which pass the tables. At the entrance to the restaurant is a tank of red bellied piranha. Due to the hotel being built partly into the side of a hill, the Temple Restaurant has no windows, and instead has a series of screens built into the walls, showing various animated videos of the South American wildlife.

The hotel is linked to the Amazu area of Chessington Zoo, which is also aztec themed. Due to the location of the hotel in relation to the car parks, check in is located in the Safari Hotel.

===Explorer Glamping===
Launched on 27 May 2016, Chessington&#x27;s Explorer Glamping site comprises a total of 31 standard, and four deluxe tents. The Glamping site is located in the south west of the park, behind Lorikeet Lagoon in the Theme Park. The &#x27;Explorer&#x27;s Outpost&#x27; restaurant is available to residents.

==2014 court case==
In June 2012, a four-year-old girl fell 4.2 metres (nearly 14 feet) while in line waiting for a ride. The park was summoned by Health and Safety Executive which claimed a health and safety breach. In the same month, park owner Merlin Entertainments initiated a court case to seek an injunction against Peter Cave, owner of survey consultancy Peer Egerton Limited. The consultancy firm had been hired by Merlin to prepare a report on the safety of the park, after the 2012 accident. Cave&#x27;s firm found 2,000 defects and potential safety hazards. This led to a dispute between Cave and Merlin, culminating in court proceedings to prevent the park from reopening after its 2012 winter break. Merlin won this case and the park reopened.

Cave then set up a campaign to warn the public and staff of the findings, including sending out 80,000 emails. Merlin claimed to have spent the £4.6 million on repairs and improvements that Cave had recommended and named the allegations &quot;baseless&quot;. But High Court Judge Elisabeth Laing ruled that the campaign was a &quot;matter of public interest&quot; and refused the injunction to silence Cave.

==Green belt restrictions==
Due to the majority of the theme park being located on green belt lands the park is subject to several restrictions. Most significant are restrictions in height (no building higher than the tree line), noise (with time restrictions) and traffic management.

Various rides have had to have been built in pits due to these restrictions. It is most noticeable on Blue Barnacle, Croc Drop and Rattlesnake. The resort cannot operate Vampire past 11pm. The resort was not allowed to build anything higher than the Peeking Heights Ferris Wheel, which has since been removed from the park.

<text>David Bellhouse (February 8, 1764 – 1840) was an English builder who did much to shape Victorian-era Manchester, both physically and socially.

==Biography==
Born in Leeds, Bellhouse received no formal education. An autodidact, he taught himself to read and write and the elements of arithmetic and technical drawing. In 1786, he moved to Manchester where he married Mary Wainwright and took up employment as a joiner with the building firm of Thomas Sharp. Sharp died in 1803 and his family had little appetite for the business so it was acquired by Bellhouse.

During the Industrial Revolution there was a mass movement of workers towards Manchester to take up employment in the cotton spinning and textile industry. This created a demand for cheap housing and Bellhouse and his partners were among several tradesmen builders who made their fortunes in property speculation. From the early nineteenth century, Bellhouse expanded into the construction of complete factories and into work as a surveyor and valuer.

His firm enjoyed the sole contracts for the erection of several public buildings, including the Portico Library, Islington Mill and the old Town Hall in King Street.

Bellhouse was active in Manchester cultural life being a founder member of the Portico Library and the Royal Manchester Institution, now the Manchester Art Gallery. Bellhouse and his wife supported many social and charitable causes, especially for workers&#x27; education, and Bellhouse was one of the founders of the Manchester Mechanics&#x27; Institute (fore-runner of UMIST).

In 1824, he was elected one of the Police Commissioners who comprised Manchester&#x27;s local government, making use of the office in furthering his building enterprise. He held the post until 1832.

Bellhouse and his wife had five sons who continued the family building trade.

==E. T. Bellhouse==
Edward Taylor Bellhouse (1816–1881), one of the grandsons of David Bellhouse (1764–1840), founded E. T. Bellhouse and Co. This company was a famous manufacturer of iron buildings. Prince Albert ordered an iron ball-room for Balmoral Castle.

<doc id="1255834" wikidata="Q2658204" url="?curid=1255834" title="British Chinese">
<text>British Chinese (), also known as Chinese British or Chinese Britons, are people of Chineseparticularly Han Chineseancestry who reside in the United Kingdom, constituting the second-largest group of Overseas Chinese in Western Europe after France.

The United Kingdom has the oldest Chinese community in Western Europe. The first waves of immigrants came between 1842 (the end of the First Opium War) and the 1940s (the end of World War II), largely through treaty ports opened as concessions to the British for the Opium Wars, such as Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Shanghai. British Chinese communities began to form in British ports in Liverpool, London, Cardiff, and Glasgow. In the Liverpool area, by the end of World War II, an estimated 900 Eurasian children were born to Chinese fathers and white mothers.

Since the middle of the 20th century, many British Chinese have been descended from people of former British colonies, such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. This shifted in the late-1970s with new waves of Chinese migrants coming from Vietnam, mainland China, and Hong Kong. Following new national security laws imposed by China onto Hong Kong, the United Kingdom offered a pathway to citizenship for British National (Overseas) status holders residing in Hong Kong – the majority of whom are ethnically Chinese. Two years since the introduction of the BN(O) visa immigration route in 2021, 144,500 Hong Kongers have arrived in the United Kingdom.

According to the 2021 Census, the Chinese ethnic group numbered 502,216, or 0.8% of the United Kingdom population. British Chinese live in every major British city, most notably including London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield and Cambridge. Compared with most other ethnic minorities in the UK, the Chinese are amongst the most geographically dispersed. The six cities of Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Manchester, and Newcastle upon Tyne host Chinatowns.

Overall, as a demographic group, the British Chinese are amongst the highest income earners, the highest academic achievers and the least likely to receive any welfare support from the government. They also place well on socioeconomic metrics with the lowest arrest and incarceration rates, lowest overweight or obesity rates, and the lowest school suspension rates.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;Asian&quot; in the United Kingdom usually refers to those of South Asian heritage, such as Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans and Kashmiris. Furthermore, although Chinese have a long history of settling in the United Kingdom, the 1991 census was the first to introduce a question on ethnicity; earlier censuses only recorded country of birth. In the 2001 census, Chinese was not included in the broad &#x27;Asian or Asian British&#x27; category, but in the &#x27;Chinese or other ethnic group&#x27; category instead. The &#x27;Chinese or other ethnic group&#x27; category continues to be used by some public bodies and governmental departments, with those who identify as Chinese not counted under the &#x27;Asian or British Asian&#x27; category. In the 2011 census, the question for ethnic group allowed for the option of &quot;Chinese&quot; for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and &quot;Chinese, Chinese Scottish or Chinese British&quot; for Scotland.

The terms &quot;British-born Chinese&quot; (BBC) and &quot;Scottish-born Chinese&quot; (SBC) have become common ways of describing ethnic Chinese who were born in the United Kingdom. However, the newer term of &quot;British Chinese&quot; began to emerge in the 1990s as a way to articulate a bicultural identity. Diana Yeh argues that the term is also a means to negotiate and offer agency to individuals often rejected as not being &quot;British&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot; enough, yet also not being as visible as &quot;Black&quot; or &quot;Asian&quot; ethnic minorities. Along with the term &quot;British Chinese,&quot; there has been an increasing use of more inclusive umbrella terms such as &quot;British East Asian&quot; (BEA) and &quot;British East and Southeast Asian&quot; (BESEA), especially in the arts sector and in the face of racism during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==
Britain has been receiving ethnic Chinese migrants more or less uninterruptedly on varying scales since the 19th century. While new immigrant arrivals numerically have replenished the Chinese community, they have also added to its complexity and the already existing differences within the community. Meanwhile, new generations of British-born Chinese have emerged.

===First Chinese===
The first recorded Chinese person in Britain was Shen Fu Tsong (1691), a Jesuit scholar who was present in the court of King James II in the 17th century. Shen was the first person to catalogue the Chinese books in the Bodleian Library. The King was so taken with him he had his portrait painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller and hung it in his bed chamber. The portrait of Shen is in the Royal Collection; it currently hangs in Windsor Castle.

William Macao (1831) was the earliest recorded Chinese person to settle in Britain. He lived in Edinburgh, Scotland from 1779. Macao married a British woman and had children, and was the first Chinese person to be baptised into the Church of Scotland. He worked for The Board of Excise at Dundas House, St Andrew Square, Edinburgh for 40 years, beginning as a servant to the clerks and retiring as Senior Accountant. He was involved in a significant naturalisation law case and for two years, until the first decision was overturned on appeal, was legally deemed a naturalised Scotsman.

A Chinese man known as John Anthony (1805) was brought to London in 1799 by the East India Company to provide accommodation for the Lascar and Chinese sailors in Angel Gardens, Shadwell in London&#x27;s East End. Antony had left China around 11 years of age in the 1770s making several journeys between London and China. He was baptised into the Church of England, about six years before his death, and anglicised his name, settled in London, and married Ester Gole in 1799. Wishing to buy property, but unable to do so while an alien, in 1805 he used part of the fortune he had amassed from his London work to pay for an Act of Parliament to naturalise him as a British subject; thus being the first Chinese person to gain British citizenship. However, he died a few months after the Act was passed.

===1800s to World War II===

Chinese migration to Britain has a history of at least a century and a half. From the 1800s until 1945, it is estimated 20,000 had emigrated to Britain. The British East India Company, which controlled the importation of popular Chinese commodities such as tea, ceramics and silks, began employing Chinese seamen in the middle of the 19th century. Those who crewed ships to Britain had to spend time in the docks of British ports while waiting for a ship to return to China, establishing the earliest Chinatowns in Liverpool and London.

In 1901 there were 387 Chinese people living in Britain, and which grew to 1,219 in 1911. These communities consisted of a transnational and highly mobile population of Cantonese seamen and small numbers of more permanent residents who ran shops, restaurants, and boarding houses that catered for them.

During this time period, mixed marriages between Chinese men and white women were increasingly commonplace in Britain. Such relationships often attracted racist attention. In nineteenth century portside communities, for example, the wives of Chinese men were often given nicknames such as &quot;Canton Kitty&quot; and &quot;Chinese Emma&quot; to ridicule their interracial relationships. Racist attitudes continued into the twentieth century as Chinese men were increasingly vilified and associated with the &quot;Yellow Peril,&quot; a racist stereotype that depicts people from East and Southeast Asia as an existential threat to the West.

Yellow Peril imagery was used to shame mixed marriages, portraying Chinese men as a danger to white women and &quot;the purity of the Anglo-Saxon blood&quot;.

In World War II as more men were required to crew British merchant ships, the Chinese Merchant Seamen&#x27;s Pool of approximately 20,000 was established with its headquarters in Liverpool. However, at the end of the war few Chinese who had worked as merchant seamen were allowed to remain in Britain. The British Government and the shipping companies colluded to forcibly repatriate thousands of Chinese seamen, leaving behind British wives and mixed-race children.

More than 50 years later in 2006, a memorial plaque in remembrance for those Chinese seamen was erected on Liverpool&#x27;s Pier Head.

=== Post-World War II ===
In the 1950s, they were replaced by a rapidly growing population of Chinese from the rural areas in Hong Kong&#x27;s New Territories. Opening restaurants across Britain, they established firm migration chains and soon dominated the Chinese presence in Britain. In the 1960s and 1970s, they were joined by increasing numbers of Chinese students and economic migrants from Malaysia and Singapore.

Chinese migration to Britain continued to be dominated by these groups until the 1980s, when rising living standards and urbanization in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia gradually reduced the volume of migration from the former British Colonies. After the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, a new wave of Hong Kong migrants settled in Britain, some of whom were civil servants. Many of these migrants were skilled professionals or business owners, and the migration continued into the 2000s. At the same time in the 1980s, the number of students and skilled migrants from the People&#x27;s Republic of China began to rise. Since the early 1990s, the UK has also witnessed a rising inflow of economic migrants from areas in China without any previous migratory link to the UK, or even elsewhere in Europe. A relatively small number of Chinese enter Britain legally as skilled migrants. However, most migrants arrive to work in unskilled jobs, originally exclusively in the Chinese ethnic sector (catering, Chinese stores, and wholesale firms), but increasingly also in employment outside this sector (for instance, in agriculture and construction). Migrants who enter Britain for unskilled employment are from both rural and urban backgrounds. Originally, Fujianese migrants were the dominant flow, but more recently increasing numbers of migrants from the Northeast of China have arrived in the UK as well. Migrants now tend to come from an increasing number of regions of origin in China. Some Chinese unskilled migrants enter illegally to work in the black economy, in dangerous jobs with no employment rights, as the Morecambe Bay tragedy of February 2004 showed. Some claim asylum in-country, avoiding deportation after exhausting their appeals.

In July 2020, following the implementation of new national security laws in Hong Kong by China, the United Kingdom offered a pathway to citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) status holders in Hong Kong – the majority of whom are ethnically Chinese. As of the end of the first quarter of 2024, over 173,500 applications for the BN(O) visa immigration route have been submitted by Hong Kongers and their dependants, over 164,900 visas were granted and around 144,400 people have arrived.

==Demographics==
===Population===


The 2021 United Kingdom census recorded a population of 502,216 or 0.8% of the population in the United Kingdom. When broken down by country, England recorded 431,188 (0.8%), Wales recorded 14,458 (0.5%) and Northern Ireland recorded 9,495 (0.5%). The equivalent census was recorded a year later in Scotland with a population of 47,075, or 0.9% of the population. The five local authorities with the largest proportion of British Chinese were the City of London (6.35%), Cambridge (4.37%), Tower Hamlets (3.31%), Westminster (3.24%) and Camden (3.20%). The three capitals of the other constituent countries of the United Kingdom held the highest proportion of British Chinese in their respective countries with Edinburgh at 2.93%, Cardiff at 1.38%, and Belfast at 1.37%.

According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, the British Chinese population totalled 433,150, or 0.7% of the population. 393,141 in England and Wales (0.7% of total population), 33,706 in Scotland (0.64% of total population), and 6,303 in Northern Ireland (0.35% of total population). Compared with most ethnic minorities in the UK, the British Chinese tend to be more geographically dispersed. However, significant numbers of British Chinese can be found in Greater London (124,250), spread across a number of its boroughs, with the next four cities with the largest British Chinese populations being Manchester (13,539), Birmingham (12,712), Glasgow (10,689), and Edinburgh (8,076). In Wales, the city with the most British Chinese was Cardiff (4,168) and, in Northern Ireland, it was Belfast (2,378). In England and Wales, 23.7% British Chinese were born in the UK, whereas over half (55.3%) were born in East Asia and 13.4% were born in Southeast Asia.

===Language===
Yue Chinese, which includes Cantonese and the Siyi languages, is spoken by 300,000 Britons as a primary language, whilst 12,000 Britons speak Mandarin Chinese and 10,000 speak Hakka Chinese. The proportion of British Chinese people who speak English as a first or second language is unknown.

===Religion===


The 2011 census found that British Chinese were the UK&#x27;s least religious ethnic minority group, with more than half not identifying with a religious tradition.

The largest religious affiliation is to various forms of Christianity. While the 2011 census in England and Wales has a single category of &quot;Christian,&quot; this is broken down more for Scotland (25% Roman Catholic, 26% Church of Scotland, and 49% other Protestant) and Northern Ireland (32% Catholic, 18% Presbyterian Church in Ireland, 10% Church of Ireland, 3% Methodist, and 35% other Protestant). The number of Protestants includes the rise of independent British Chinese churches.

The next largest religious affiliations are Buddhism and Islam. However, Northern Ireland did not include data on Buddhism or Islam in 2011, but included Islam in 2021.

==Community==

Historically, British Chinatowns originated as enclaves of Chinese communities and can be found in many major cities, such as London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Sheffield and Aberdeen. Today, Chinatowns have relatively few Chinese people living there, and they have become tourist attractions where Chinese restaurants and businesses predominate.

There exist several organisations in the UK that support the Chinese community. The Chinese community is a non-profit organisation that runs social events for the Chinese community. Dimsum is a media organisation which also aims to raise awareness of the cultural issues that the Chinese community face. The Chinese Information and Advice Centre supports disadvantaged people of Chinese ethnic origin in the UK.

Since 2000, the emergence of Internet discussion sites produced by British Chinese young people has provided an important forum for many of them to grapple with questions concerning their identities, experiences, and status in Britain. Within these online fora and in larger community efforts, the groups may self identify as &#x27;British-born Chinese&#x27; or &#x27;BBCs&#x27;.

===London===


The Chinese population is extremely dispersed, according to Rob Lewis, a senior demographer at the Greater London Authority: &quot;The reason for their thin spread all over London, is because of the idea that you want to set up a Chinese restaurant that&#x27;s a little way away from the next one.&quot; According to the 2011 census, Greater London included 124,250 British Chinese, making up 1.5% of the overall population.

There are Chinese community centres in Chinatown, Kensington and Chelsea, Southwark, Westminster, Camden, Greenwich, Lewisham and Tower Hamlets. Major organisations include the London Chinese Community Centre, London Chinatown Chinese Association, and the London Chinese Cultural Centre.

The Westminster Chinese Library, based at the Charing Cross Library (), holds one of the largest collections of Chinese materials in UK public libraries. It has a collection of over 50,000 Chinese books available for loan and reference to local readers of Chinese; music cassettes, CDs, and video films for loan; community information and general enquiries; a national subscription service of Chinese books; and Chinese events organised from time to time. The library also hosted a photography exhibition in 2013 as part of the British Chinese Heritage project, with photographs and stories of Chinese workers.

Based in Denver House, Bounds Green the Ming-Ai (London) Institute has undertaken a number of heritage and community projects to record and archive the contributions made by British Chinese people to the local communities in the United Kingdom.

Chinese New Year celebrations in London have been celebrated since the 1960s and are famous for colourful parades, fireworks, and street dancing. Other activities include a family show in Trafalgar Square with dragon and lion dances and traditional and contemporary Chinese arts by performers from both London and China. There are fireworks displays in Leicester Square, as well as cultural stalls, food, decorations, and lion dance displays throughout the day in London Chinatown. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, London&#x27;s Chinese New Year celebrations in 2021 were shifted online.

The London Dragon Boat Festival is held annually in June at the London Regatta Centre, Royal Albert Docks. It is organised by the London Chinatown Lions Club.

Also held annually in London is the widely acclaimed, British Chinese Food Awards that promotes entrepreneurship, talent and Chinese food across the UK.

==Racism==

Michael Wilkes from the British Chinese Project said that racism against British Chinese people is not taken as seriously as racism against African, African-Caribbean or South Asian people, and that a lot of racist attacks towards the Chinese community go unreported, primarily because of widespread mistrust in the police.

===Chinese labourers===

From the middle of the 19th century, Chinese were seen as a source for cheap labourers for the building of the British Empire. However, this resulted in animosity against Chinese labourers as competing for British jobs. Hostilities were seen when Chinese were being recruited for work in the British Transvaal Colony (present day South Africa), resulted in 28 riots between July 1904 to July 1905, and later becoming a key debating point as part of the 1906 United Kingdom general election. This would also be the source of the 1911 seamen&#x27;s strike in Cardiff, which resulted in rioting and the destruction of about 30 Chinese laundries.

While Chinese were recruited to support British war efforts, after the end of the Second World War, the British Government sought to forcibly repatriate thousands of seamen in a Home Office policy HO 213/926 to &quot;Compulsory repatriation of undesirable Chinese seamen.&quot; Many of the seamen left behind wives and mixed-race children that they would never see again. A network has also been established for families of Chinese seamen who were repatriated after the Second World War.

===2001 Foot-and-mouth outbreak===
Government reports in early 2001 highlighted the smuggling of illegal meat as a possible source for the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak, some of which was destined for a Chinese restaurant. This reportedly resulted in a drop in 40% of trade for Chinese catering businesses throughout some 12,000 Chinese takeaways and 3,000 Chinese restaurants in the United Kingdom, which made up about 80% of the British Chinese workforce at the time. Community leaders saw this as racist and xenophobic, with a scapegoating of the British Chinese community for the spread of the disease.

===COVID-19 pandemic===

On 12 February 2020, Sky News reported that some British Chinese said they were facing increasing levels of racist abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was recorded that hate crimes against British Chinese people between January and March 2020 tripled the number of hate crimes in the previous two years in the UK. According to the London Metropolitan Police, between January and June 2020, 457 race-related crimes were committed against British East and Southeast Asians.

Verbal abuse has been one of the common forms of racism experienced by British Chinese. Just before the lockdown in February 2020, British Chinese children recalled experiences of fear and frustration due to bullying and name calling in their schools. According to a June 2020 poll, 76% of British Chinese had received racial slurs at least once, and 50% regularly received racial slurs, a significantly higher frequency than experienced by any other racial minority.

Racism during the pandemic has also impacted a number of Chinese-owned business, especially within the catering business, as well as an increase in violent assaults against British East and Southeast Asians.

British Chinese have sought ways to support one another, especially in response to racism coming out of the pandemic. A grassroots group known as Britain&#x27;s East and Southeast Asian Network was formed to promote positive representation of the community in the UK. Religious groups have also offered a source of solidarity, such as through British Chinese churches and mainstream churches like the Church of England, the latter through the group The Teahouse.

==Socioeconomics==
Since the relatively elevated immigration of the 1960s, the Chinese community has made rapid socioeconomic advancements in the UK over the course of a generation. There still exists a segregation of the Chinese in the labour market, however, with a large proportion of the Chinese employed in the Chinese catering industry. Overall, as a demographic group, the British Chinese are well-educated and hold the highest records of academic attainment, least likely to receive any welfare support from the government (including social housing) and earn higher incomes when compared to other demographic groups in the UK. The British Chinese also fare well on many socioeconomic indicators, including the lowest arrest and incarceration rates, the lowest school suspension rates, higher proportions in high socio-economic jobs and high rates of health. Despite this, the Chinese are amongst the most likely ethnicity in the UK to endure racism and face-to-face discrimination. They also hold lower rates of home ownership and are the second least wealthy among major British ethnic groups. In the three-year period to 2022/23, 45% of children in households from a Chinese ethnic group were experiencing child poverty after housing costs.

===Education===
The British Chinese community place an exceptionally high value on post-secondary educational attainment; emphasise effort over innate ability; give their children supplementary tutoring irrespective of financial barriers; and restrict their children&#x27;s exposure to counter-productive influences that might hinder educational attainment via the Confucian paradigm and the sole belief of greater social mobility. The proportion of British Chinese achieving 5 or more good GCSEs stood at a relatively high 70%. According to the 2001 census, 30% of the British Chinese post-16 population are full-time students compared to a UK average of 8%. When it comes to the distinguished category of being recognized as the &quot;paragon immigrants&quot;, British Chinese are also more likely to take maths and science-intensive courses such as physics and calculus. A study done by the Royal Society of Chemistry and Institute of Physics revealed that British Chinese students were four times more likely than White or Black students in the United Kingdom to achieve three or more science A-levels. In spite of language barriers, among recent Chinese immigrants to the UK (who do not have English as a first language) 86% of pre-teens reached the required standard of English on the national curriculum exam. The overall result of 86% was one percentage point above the British Indians and remained the highest rate among all ethnic groups in the United Kingdom.

The British Chinese community has been hailed as a socioeconomic &quot;success story&quot; by British sociologists, who have for years glossed over socioeconomic difficulties and inequalities among the major ethnic groups in Britain. The degree educational advantages varies widely however: minorities of European descent fare best, together with the British Chinese. The group has more well-educated members, with a much higher proportion of university graduates than British-born whites. These latter have not been negligible: research has shown that the Chinese as a group face both discrimination and problems accessing public and social services. Many have activated ill-conceived stereotypes of the Chinese as a collectivist, conformist, entrepreneurial, ethnic group, and conforming to Confucian values, which is a divergence of British-Chinese culture and construction of ethnic identity. Educational attainment is greatly espoused by parental reasoning as the British Chinese community cites higher education as a route to ensure a higher ranking job.

According to a study done by the London School of Economics in 2010, the British Chinese tend to be better educated and earn more than the general British population as a whole. British Chinese are also more likely to go to more prestigious universities or to get higher class degrees than any other ethnic minority in the United Kingdom. Nearly 45% of British Chinese men and more than a third of British Chinese women achieved a first or higher degree. Between 1995 and 1997, 29% of British Chinese have higher educational qualifications. This was the highest rate for any ethnic group during those two years. Between 2006 and 2008, the figure had risen to 45%, where it again remained the highest for any ethnic group. In terms of educational achievement at the secondary level, Chinese males and females perform well above the national median. A tenth of Chinese boys are ranked in the top 3% overall, and a tenth of Chinese girls in the top 1%. Due to the rigorous primary and secondary school system in East Asian countries such as China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, Britons of Chinese, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese descent rank within the top 5 in British as well as international scholastic mathematical and scientific aptitude tests and tend to score better in these subjects than the general population average. British Chinese remain rare among most Special Educational Needs types at the primary and secondary school level, except for Speech, Language and Communication needs, where first-generation Chinese pupils are greatly over-represented with the influx of first-generation immigrants coming from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

According to Department for Education statistics for the 2021–22 academic year, British Chinese pupils in England attained the highest level of academic performance at both A-Level and GCSE. 36.8% of British Chinese pupils achieved at least 3 As at A Level and an average score of 66.1 was achieved in Attainment 8 scoring at GCSE level. Trevor Phillips, former Chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has argued that Chinese and Indian-heritage pupils achieve high standards of academic attainment regardless of the school attended or poverty levels. British Chinese pupils in receipt of free school meals, a proxy for socioeconomic status, on average outperform all other ethnicities including those in higher socioeconomic status (not in receipt of free school meals).
 



===Employment===
First generation British citizens of Chinese backgrounds remain over-represented in self-employment, however, rates of self-employment fell between 1991 and 2001 as second generation British Chinese chose not to follow their parents into business and instead choose to find employment in the paid labor market. First and second-generation British Chinese men have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, with an unemployment rate of 4.08% and 4.32% compared with slightly higher figures of 5% for White Irish (first and second generation). Vertical segregation is also apparent for men and women in the British Chinese community. British Chinese men are twice as likely to be working than White British men to be in professional jobs (27%, and 14% respectively). Chinese men have the third highest rate of employment in managerial jobs at 31%. This compares to 45% for Indian men, 35% for white men and 23% for Black Caribbeans.

A colossal rate of diversity in British self-employment and entrepreneurship in the British Chinese Community has been considerably high. East Asian British groups (Chinese, Japanese, South Korean) and British South Asian groups (Indian, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani) typically have higher rates of self-employment than Whites, while Black groups (Black African and Black Caribbean) have lower rates. Self-employment rates in the British Chinese community is generally higher than the national average. For instance, White British had self-employment rates of 17% in 2001, but the British Chinese self-employment rate was 28%, the higher than the British Indian rate of 21%, British Pakistanis of 27%, and the highest overall among Britain&#x27;s main ethnic groups. However, overall aggregate self-employment fell between the decade of 1991 to 2001 as the proportion of British Chinese with higher qualifications grew from 27% to 43% between the years of 1991 to 2006. 75% of male British Chinese entrepreneurs worked in the distribution, hotel, and catering industries. In 1991, 34.1% of British Chinese men and 20.3% of British Chinese women were self-employed and the rate was the highest among all Britain&#x27;s major ethnic groups during that year. In Scotland for 2001, self-employment rates for British Chinese men dropped to 27.8% and 18.3% for British Chinese women, yet overall rates still remained the highest among all of Britain&#x27;s major ethnic groups. The overall self-employment rate in 2001 was 23%. Common business industries for the British Chinese include restaurants, business services, medical and vet services, recreational and cultural services, wholesale distribution, catering, hotel management, retail, and construction. By 2004, overall British Chinese self-employment was just under 16%, as one in five (21%) of British Pakistanis were self-employed and more British Chinese choose to acquire higher qualifications via education. By 2006, 29% of all
Chinese men were classed as self-employed compared to 17% of white British men and 18% of Chinese women compared to 7% of White British women.

===Economics===
British Chinese men and women also rank very highly in terms of receiving wages well above the national median. According to a 2009 report by the National Equality Panel, British Chinese men had the highest median wage for any ethnic group with £12.70 earned per hour, followed by the medians for White British men at £11.40, and Multiracial Britons at £11.30 and British Indian men at £11.20. British Chinese women also had a high median wage, third only to Black Caribbean women and Multiracial Briton women with a median wage of £10.21 earned per hour. However, British Chinese women were also more likely to experience more pay penalties than other ethnic groups in the United Kingdom despite possessing higher qualifications. When comparing to White British males, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women have the highest gender pay gap while British Chinese women have reversed the gender pay gap. In 2019, the British Chinese had a median hourly pay of £15.38, second only to the White Irish group. In 2022, the median hourly pay for the British Chinese rose to £17.73, 23% higher than the White British. Despite this, research from the Resolution Foundation published in 2020 has found that the ethnic group has the second lowest median total household net wealth at £73,500 – behind Other Whites (£122,800), British Bangladeshis (£124,700), British Caribbeans (£125,400), British Pakistanis (£232,200), White British (£324,100), and British Indians (£347,400). The group were found to have made little progress in increasing net wealth over the decade compared to other ethnicities, and were one of the only ethnic groups in which the average person inherits nothing.

Comparing total income among women from different ethnic groups, a 2010 report by the Government Equalities Office found that British Chinese, Black Caribbean and Black African women had the highest average individual incomes. British Chinese, British Indian and White British women had the highest average equivalent household incomes. Though British Chinese women had both high individual and equivalent household incomes, they also had very dispersed incomes. In the 2016 to 2019 period, the British Chinese community had the second highest percentage of households in the highest income quintile after housing costs (24%). On the other end of the scale, 34% of the community lived in households classified as low income (after housing costs) compared to 22% of all households. In the 2011 to 2014 period, 49% of British Chinese lived in low income households compared to 21% of all households.

A study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2011 found that British Chinese have one of the lowest poverty rates among different ethnic groups in Britain. The British Chinese adult poverty rate was 20% and the child poverty rate stood at 30%. Of the different ethnic groups studied, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, and Black Africans had the highest rates of child and adult poverty overall. In contrast, British Chinese, Black Caribbeans, British Indians and White British had the lowest rates.

===Health and welfare===
In 2001, Chinese men and women were the least likely to report their health as &quot;not good&quot; of all ethnic groups. Chinese men and women had the lowest rates of long-term illness or disability which restricts daily activities. The British Chinese population (5.8%) were least likely to be providing informal care (unpaid care to relatives, friends or neighbours). Around 0.25% of the British Chinese population were residents in hospital and other care establishments. Fewer than 10% of the Chinese adult population drank above the recommended daily alcohol guidelines on their heaviest drinking day.

In 2021, the Chinese ethnic group were the least likely (5.2%) to smoke of all ethnic groups, falling to 1.7% for Chinese women. 37.5% of British Chinese were overweight or obese compared to 63.5% of the general population in the same year.

The Chinese National Healthy Living Centre was founded in 1987 to promote healthy living, and provide access to health services, for the Chinese community in the UK. The community is widely dispersed across the country and currently makes the lowest use of health services of all minority ethnic groups. The Centre aims to reduce the health inequality between the Chinese community and the general population. Language difficulties and long working hours in the catering trade present major obstacles to many Chinese people in accessing mainstream health provision. Language and cultural barriers can result in their being given inappropriate health solutions. Isolation is a common problem amongst this widely dispersed community and can lead to a range of mental illnesses. The centre, based close to London&#x27;s Chinatown, provides a range of services designed to tackle both the physical and psychological aspects of health.

===Politics===
A survey conducted in 2006, estimated that around 30% of British Chinese were not on the electoral register, and therefore not able to vote. This compares to 6% of whites and 17% for all ethnic minorities.

In a bid to increase voter registration and turnout, and reverse voter apathy within the community, campaigns have been organized such as the &quot;British Chinese Register to Vote&quot; organised by Get Active UK, a working title that encompasses all the activities run by the Integration of British Chinese into Politics (the British Chinese Project) and its various partners. The campaign wishes to highlight the low awareness of politics among the British Chinese community; to encourage those eligible to vote but not on the electoral register to get registered; and to help people make a difference on issues affecting themselves and their communities on a daily basis by getting their voices heard through voting.

Research conducted by UK in a Changing Europe in 2023 has suggested that British Chinese and British Indian voters held more economically right-wing views, but held the most socially liberal attitudes, in particular towards the LGBT community, compared to other ethnic minorities in the UK. Survey data indicated Conservatives (40 per cent) led Labour (37 per cent) by 3 points amongst the British Chinese.

==Arts==
The esea contemporary (formerly Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art or CFCCA) is the international agency for the development and promotion of contemporary Chinese artists. Established in 1986, it is based in Manchester, the city with the second largest Chinese community in the UK, and the organisation is part of the region&#x27;s rich Chinese heritage. The Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art also hosts the International Chinese Live Art Festival which showcases work by Chinese artists from across the world.

The Yellow Earth Theatre company is a London-based international touring company formed by five British East Asian performers in 1995. It aims to promote the writing and performing talents of East Asians in Britain.

The China Arts Space is an organisation that promotes East Asian visual and performing arts. British lecturers Dr Felicia Chan and Dr Andy Willis, of the University of Manchester and University of Salford respectively, have proposed that artists of Chinese heritage in the UK were accepted inclusively under the label British Asian in the 1980s.

==Further reading==
There have been very few books written on the history of the Chinese in Britain. The main historical survey of British Chinese is , which explores the migration of Chinese to Britain and their economic and social standing. Another work, , overviews the lives of Chinese who travelled to Britain over 300 years from the first in 1687. Most other works which exists are mainly surveys, dissertations, census figures, and newspaper reports.

<text>Oslo Cathedral () — formerly Our Savior&#x27;s Church () — is the main church for the Church of Norway Diocese of Oslo, as well as the parish church for downtown Oslo. The present building dates from 1694 to 1697.
The Norwegian royal family and the Norwegian Government use the cathedral for public events. It was closed for renovation in August 2006 and re-opened with a festive high mass on 18 April 2010.

==History==
The current Oslo Cathedral is the third cathedral in Oslo, Norway. The first, Hallvards Cathedral, was built by King Sigurd I of Norway in the first half of the 12th century, and was located by the Old Bishop&#x27;s Palace in Oslo, some east of today&#x27;s cathedral.

For almost 500 years, Hallvards Cathedral was the most important church in the city. After a great fire in Oslo during 1624, King Christian IV decided to move the city a few kilometers west to be protected by Akershus Fortress. Construction of a new church was begun in 1632, on the main square in the new city. After that, Hallvards Cathedral fell into disrepair and decayed.

In 1639 the second cathedral, (Holy Trinity), was built. This cathedral burnt down after only 50 years, however, and the current cathedral was built to replace it. The church was likely designed by Jørgen Wiggers, councillor of state (&quot;etatsråd&quot;). The current cathedral was erected on a small rocky outcrop in the east end of what would later become Stortorvet. The foundation stone was laid in 1694 and the church was consecrated in November 1697.

In August 2001, Oslo Cathedral was the site of the wedding of Prince Haakon, and Princess Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby.

==Restoration==

The cathedral was rebuilt between 1848 and 1850 after a plan by German-born architect, Alexis de Chateauneuf (1799–1853). Another German-born architect, Heinrich Ernst Schirmer (1814–1887) was the construction manager for the project. When Chateauneuf became ill in 1850, Schirmer retained Wilhelm von Hanno (1826–1882) to complete the project.

Oslo Cathedral is located at Stortorvet square north/north-east of Karl Johans gate, between Kirke gate and Dronningens gate. The cathedral&#x27;s lower end is surrounded by the Bazaar (), a curved long building with a tower covered in green copper like the cathedral. Integrated with Basarene is the Fire Watch () which served as Oslo&#x27;s main fire station from 1860 until 1939, when today&#x27;s main fire station at Arne Garborgs plass was opened. The cathedral, Basarene and Brannvakten are all built in red brick. Both Basarene and Brannvakten were built between 1840 and 1859 from the plans of city architect, Christian H. Grosch.

Artwork from recent times in the cathedral includes stained-glass windows in the choir by Emanuel Vigeland installed between 1910 and 1916, west portal bronze doors executed by Dagfin Werenskiold (1892–1977) in 1938, and the silver sculpture with communion scene by Italian sculptor Arrigo Minerbi dating from 1930. The ceiling decorations are by Norwegian painter Hugo Lous Mohr (1889–1970). In the latter half of the 1990s, the main organ built by Ryde &amp; Berg of Fredrikstad, was mounted behind the old baroque facade.

Restoration was completed at the time of the city&#x27;s 900 anniversary in 1950. The church was restored under the plans of architect Arnstein Arneberg. The neo-Gothic interior was removed and the original furnishings brought back. Arneberg also designed the chapel on the south side of the church. The church was closed in August 2006 for renovation and was opened in April 2010 in the presence of Harald V of Norway and the Norwegian royal family.

==Carillon and carillonneurs==
 In 1924 Oslo Cathedral received a donation of 24,000 NOK for a carillon in the belfry, but this was never implemented. In 2003 a second donation, by Ørnulf Myklestad, resulted in a 48-bell concert carillon under the direction of carillonneur Vegar Sandholt. This carillon is inside the tower, not the belfry; the acoustic problems arising from this location have been highlighted in a 2005 masters thesis by Laura Rueslåtten for the Scandinavian Carillon School.

From December 2016 the carillon has been in regular use for hour, quarter-strokes and ritornelles, with contributions by Vegar Sandholt and Kåre Nordstoga, programmed and maintained by Brynjar Landmark, and with 18 different melodies between 7:00 am and midnight, changing according to the calendar.

<doc id="1255844" wikidata="Q6728328" url="?curid=1255844" title="Madoc, Ontario (village)">
<text>Madoc is a community in the municipality of Centre Hastings, Hastings County, Ontario, Canada. It is located at the junction of Highway 7 and Highway 62, southeast of Bancroft, halfway between Toronto and Ottawa.

==History==
Madoc was originally named MacKenzie&#x27;s Mills after Donald MacKenzie, who built a sawmill and grist mill here. It was briefly named Hastings but was renamed Madoc Township after the legendary Welsh prince Madoc ap Owain Gwynedd, credited by some with discovering North America in 1170. When people traveled by horse and carriage during the 19th century from Toronto to Ottawa, Madoc was the halfway stop over, allowing the passengers and horses to rest. The community separated from the namesake township and remained an incorporated municipality until 1998.

The area has had a rich mining history. Gold was discovered at nearby Eldorado in 1866. Fluorite was extracted from the area during the 1930s and 1940s. The talc mine, under the name Canada Talc (Cantalc), that was in production in Madoc for almost 114 years by 2010 is now shutting down. It is one of only three mines in the world that has been in steady operation for more than one hundred years.

On January 25, 1998, the Village of Madoc amalgamated with Huntingdon Township to form Centre Hastings. Madoc is the largest community in the municipality. Its post office services locals with lock boxes and rural routes.

In 2008, Madoc celebrated its 130th anniversary.

==Attractions==
O&#x27;Hara Mill Homestead and Conservation Area features the O&#x27;Hara Sawmill. It is reputedly the only water-powered upright frame saw left in Ontario. It has been restored to operating condition by volunteers and is a centre piece of the revitalized homestead and conservation area. Being near the junction of highways 7 and 62, it offers an intriguing rest stop to travellers.

The village has a premier skateboard park with splash pad, canteen, night-time lighting with bleachers and performing arts centre with music stage made from straw-bale construction.

An outdoor public swimming pool is located at 65 Queen Victoria St. W. in Madoc. It is run through the Municipality of Centre Hastings.

A public boat launch at Moira Lake South of the town offers a boat launch, swimming and a beachfront. As of 2013 a boat launch revitalization project has started, led by Madoc Kiwanis Club and will feature a new boat launch, boat ramp and docking area and marshland boardwalk, safe swimming area and more parking.

The Tim Hortons restaurant in Madoc pours more than 3,000 cups of coffee a day, making it one of the busiest within the chain.

The Tri-Lakes Medical Centre opened in Madoc in June 2009.

==Notable people==
People born here include:
*Allan Roy Dafoe, delivered and cared for the Dionne Quintuplets.
*Colin Scott Dafoe, surgeon with Marshall Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Partisans in Yugoslavia during the Second World War.

<doc id="1255846" wikidata="Q3783111" url="?curid=1255846" title="Hanover Square, Westminster">
<text>Hanover Square is a green square in Mayfair, Westminster, south west of Oxford Circus where Oxford Street meets Regent Street. Six streets converge on the square which include Harewood Place with links to Oxford Street, Princes Street, Hanover Street, Saint George Street, Brook Street and Tenderden Street, linking to Bond Street and Oxford Street.

==History==
Development of the land that would become Hanover Square began shortly after the accession of the Elector of Hanover as King George I in 1714. The land was owned by Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough, who was a soldier and statesman best known for his role in the Glorious Revolution. He sold off numerous plots for the building of upmarket town houses and villas.

In honour of the coronation of the new English king, the area was named Hanover Square. This reflected the century-long Whig Ascendancy because its name echoed the staunch and predominant support among the British Establishment towards the Hanoverian succession of 1714, and the Act of Settlement 1701 that permanently codified the exclusion of Catholics from the English throne. &quot;Early Hanover Square was decidedly Whig and most decidedly military&quot;, commented architectural historian Sir John Summerson.

Some early residents of Hanover Square included Generals Earl Cadogan, Sir Charles Wills, Stewart, Evans, Lord Carpenter, Hamish Smith and John Pepper, &quot;names conspicuously associated with episodes in Marlborough’s war and the &#x27;Fifteen&#x27;.&quot;

The parish church of St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, is 100 metres south of the square (co-fronting Saint George and Maddox Streets), built on land given by William Steuart. In 1759 James Abercrombie, commander-in-chief of British forces in North America during the French and Indian War, resided in St George Street. Merged or subdivided buildings in many cases, their numbering scheme remains since the early 19th century and is Nos. 1 to 25, consecutively.

While a few of the 18th-century houses remain largely intact, most houses have been replacements of later periods. It is now predominantly occupied by offices, including the London office of &quot;Vogue&quot;.

In the 2010s, the north west corner of the square was removed and rebuilt as part of the Crossrail project. A new Bond Street entrance for the Elizabeth line was built, with commercial office space in a new building above.

<text>The Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, popularly known as the Lit. &amp; Phil., is one of the oldest learned societies in the United Kingdom and second oldest provincial learned society (after the Spalding Gentlemen&#x27;s Society).

Prominent members have included Robert Owen, John Dalton, James Prescott Joule, Sir William Fairbairn, Tom Kilburn, Peter Mark Roget, Sir Ernest Rutherford, Alan Turing, Sir Joseph Whitworth and Dorothy Hodgkin.

== History ==
It was established in February 1781, as the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, by Thomas Percival, Thomas Barnes, Thomas Henry, Thomas Butterworth Bayley and others. The first formal meeting of the society took place on 14 March 1781. Meetings were held in a back room of Cross Street Chapel until December 1799, after which the society moved into its own premises in George Street. John Dalton conducted his experiments at these premises.

The Society&#x27;s original premises on George Street were destroyed during the Manchester Blitz (around January 1941), at which time its library comprised more than 50,000 volumes as well as historic artefacts, portraits, and archives. Its replacement (built in the 1960s) was constructed using high alumina cement (referred to as having &quot;concrete cancer&quot;) and was demolished in the 1980s. It became a registered charity (No. 235313) in 1964.

Membership is open to anyone aged over 16 years and lectures are held both in person at venues in Manchester City Centre, and (since 2020) online. There are on average 30 lectures each season and non-members are welcome to attend. The society has more than 400 members.

The Society operates from an office situated in Colony Jactin House, Ancoats, Manchester, and has three permanent staff.

== Activities ==
The Society organises a range of lectures, including the Wilde, Joule and Dalton Lectures and three lectures annually specifically for Young People. The most prestigious lectures are the Percival Lecture and the Manchester Lecture, and in some years the most distinguished speakers are presented with the Dalton Medal. Since the local universities ceased offering extra-curricular courses the Lit. &amp; Phil. has seen an increase in both membership and in the attendance of non-members at lectures.

== Members ==
Notable Members, in addition to those above, have included the Nobel Laureates, Sir Robert Robinson, Sir Norman Haworth, and Niels Bohr, as well as Chaim Weizmann, Hans Geiger, Sir William Roberts, Lyon, Lord Playfair, William Gaskell, Sir William de Wiveleslie Abney, Charles William Sutton, Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, Joseph Jordan, Henry Moseley, Sir Adolphus William Ward, Stanley Jevons, James Prince Lee, Sir Edward Leader Williams, William Axon, Sir Henry Hoyle Howorth, Samuel Greg, Sir Edward Frankland, Samuel Hibbert-Ware and Moses Tyson.

Honorary Members have included Stephen Hawking, William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, Robert Bunsen, Sergey Kapitsa, Dmitri Mendeleev, Sir Cyril Hinshelwood, Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw, Jöns Jacob Berzelius and John Mercer.
== &quot;Memoirs&quot; ==
The society&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs and Proceedings&quot; (first published in 1783) was, at the time of its launch, the only regular scientific journal in the United Kingdom except for the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;.

The &quot;Manchester Memoirs&quot; has been published continuously since the first edition.

It contains the transactions of the society (most notably the text of many recent lectures) and is distributed to members and to similar institutions and libraries throughout the world by subscription. Copies are also available for purchase by non-members.

== Dalton Medal ==
Named in honour of the Society&#x27;s longest-serving President, the scientist John Dalton, the Dalton Medal is a distinction rarely bestowed and is the Society’s highest award. It is given to those who have made a distinguished contribution to science.

Since 1898 the medal has been awarded on only fifteen occasions: all recipients have been Fellows of the Royal Society and many have been Nobel Laureates.

Several medallists have had Manchester and University of Manchester/Owens College connections with the Departments of Physics and Astronomy, Chemistry and Engineering. 

So far, only one woman has been a recipient of this medal.

<text>Ickenham () is a London Underground station located in Ickenham in the London Borough of Hillingdon.
The station is on the Uxbridge branch of both the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines, between Hillingdon and Ruislip stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 6.

==History==

The Metropolitan Railway (Harrow and Uxbridge Railway) constructed the line through Ickenham between Harrow on the Hill and Uxbridge and commenced services on 4 July 1904 with, initially, the only intermediate stop being at Ruislip. At first, services were operated by steam trains, but track electrification was completed in the subsequent months and electric trains began operating on 1 January 1905.

Progressive development in the north Middlesex area over the next two decades led to the gradual opening of additional stations along the Uxbridge branch to encourage the growth of new residential areas. On 25 September 1905 a small halt was opened as Ickenham Halt by the Metropolitan Railway, following lobbying by the Ickenham Parish Council. The railway company had been reluctant to open a station in the area due to a perceived lack of revenue and so a compromise was reached with the halt.

The new halt brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings. Villagers living near the halt sold flowers from their gardens and served teas. The parish council later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms, which were built in December 1905. A booking hut followed in 1910. The platforms, which had been too short for trains to call at fully, were extended in 1922.

On 1 March 1910, an extension of the District line from South Harrow to connect with the Metropolitan Railway at Rayners Lane was opened, enabling District line trains to serve stations between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge from that date. On 23 October 1933 District line services were replaced by Piccadilly line trains.

The station was rebuilt into its present form between 1970 and 1971 replacing the &#x27;halt&#x27; structures dating from 1905.

In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step free access by 2022, as part of a £200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube.

<text>The Muldjewangk is a water-creature in Ngarrindjeri mythology that inhabited the Murray River, particularly Lake Alexandrina. It was used as a deterrent for Aboriginal children who wished to play near the riverside after dark. Sometimes they are portrayed as evil merfolk, and other times as a gargantuan monster. Accounts are inconsistent as to whether there are many of the creatures, or a single &quot;The Muldjewangk&quot;.

A legend tells of a Muldjewangk who once attacked a steamboat owned by European settlers. The captain saw two great hands grasping the hull of the boat so he grabbed his gun. Aboriginal elders on board warned the captain not to shoot, but their pleas fell on deaf ears. The elders warned the captain that he would suffer as a result of his actions. Soon after, the captain broke out in weeping red blisters over his body, and took six months to die.

The Muldjewangk pesters Ngurunderi (see Murray River) and his wives when they settle on the banks of Lake Alexandrina by wrecking their fishing nets.

Large clumps of floating seaweed are said to hide Muldjewangks and are to be avoided. Large footprints have also been seen. Some elders now say the Muldjewangks no longer inhabit the river system.

<text>Le Rénovateur is the only French-language newspaper in the Lao PDR (Laos). It is published weekly by the &quot;Lao Press in Foreign Languages&quot;, which is a specialised agency of the Ministry of Information and Culture

It was started in 1998 after the communist government decided to start a new policy in order to open the country. It was helped in the beginning by the Agence intergouvernementale de la Francophonie, an international organisation that promotes the French language, especially in Africa and in South-East Asia. Its first editor-in-chief was Douangta Manokoun, with the support of a French advisor, Michel Leroy. Since the newspaper&#x27;s 200th edition, FrancoNet Canada has helped it to publish on-line. The French Cultural Center of Vientiane pays someone to correct the articles written by Laotian journalists.

&quot;Le Rénovateur&quot; is sometimes described as a propaganda newspaper by the opposition living abroad. In 2003, &quot;Le Rénovateur&quot; published an interview with Mr Phivath, the lawyer of Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud, European journalists arrested because they were investigating reports of the war between the Laotian Army and the country&#x27;s Hmong tribespeople in the jungle of Saysomboun special zone. The interviews were censored, but received the &quot;Prix de la libre expression&quot; (Free-Speech Prize), given by the Union de la Presse Francophone.

Also in 2003, &quot;Le Rénovateur&quot; published stories about working in garment sweat shops, film censorship at the beginning of the socialist revolution, and the difficulties of being gay in Vientiane.

Created by Soumsanouk Mixay, the newspaper was taken over Savankhone Razmountry in 2003.

<text>The following languages are listed as unclassified by the &quot;Ethnologue&quot; (17th edition), though in their descriptions some are identified with an established family, or have been retired as spurious. Since the 15th edition, several other unclassified languages were found to be related to known languages once better data was collected, and some, such as &quot;Amikoana&quot; and &quot;Miarrã&quot;, were found to be spurious and their ISO codes were retired. Languages which became extinct before 1950 are the purview of Linguist List and are being gradually removed from &quot;Ethnologue&quot;; they are listed as an addendum to this page.

There are 48 unclassified languages in the 25th edition of Ethnologue published in 2022.

<doc id="1255896" wikidata="Q643966" url="?curid=1255896" title="Citroën C4">
<text>The Citroën C4 is a car produced by Citroën, part of Stellantis. It was positioned to be the successor to the Citroën Xsara. The first generation production started in September 2004. For its first two generations, the C4 was a compact car/small family car, but it has been redesigned as a subcompact crossover SUV for its third generation.

In June 2020, the third-generation C4 was released in the form of coupe SUV, abandoning the traditional C-segment hatchback/saloon body style.


==First generation (2004)==
===Debut===
To cope with the market, Citroën was dedicated and committed to building a new model that would appeal to many customers. At the Geneva Motor Show in 2004, a concept from the Citroën line&#x27;s definitive made-bodied coupé revealed the willingness of the French company to employ it in competition. The car was finally unveiled at the 2004 Paris Motor Show, after being officially launched to retail on September 2, 2004. However, that version was a more domesticated hatchback coupé or five-door.

===Design===
The C4&#x27;s design was created by a team that included Donato Coco, Jean Pierre Ploué and Bertrand Rapatel. Building on the floor of its cousin, the Peugeot 307, the C4 was immediately made available in two body variants: five-door hatchback and three-door coupé. The front is common to both versions, with the grille formed from virtual extensions of the central crest. The saloon is much more rounded and features softer shapes, so they can boast a Cd of just 0.28, while the coupe is more angular, with a rear split into two parts, including lights.

The rear window of the coupé is reminiscent of the older Honda CR-X from the early 1990s, as well as the last three-door Mazda 323C. These two versions of the C4 Picasso are more detached, taking over the grille of the saloon and coupe, but the cut of the headlamps are different, aesthetically combining corners and curves. The rear lights incorporate the design as in those of the saloon but were adapted to the different shape of the body. Internally, the dashboard features a central instrument panel that centralizes all heating and cooling controls, audio, and a satellite navigation screen. The instrument panel contains digital and analog displays of the speedometer, petrol levels, and other gauges. Lighting can be customized to change color from white to blue.

The revolution, however, is placed in canonical position, behind the wheel. The latter is multifunctional and characterized by having a fixed hub. The cabin is equipped with numerous storage compartments and the luggage compartment is regular in shape, with a capacity of 352 liters, increasing to 1,200 after lowering the rear seat backrest. The load threshold is quite high, hitting loads of heavy objects. There are laminated side windows and exterior mirrors, with a casing specially designed to prevent wind noise and improve the comfort inside.

The saloon version is manufactured in Argentina, where it is sold alongside the five-door and the imported three-door version. The C4 Saloon is exported from there to Brazil and Hungary as the C4 Pallas and to Spain, Turkey, and Greece as the C4 Sedan. A longer four-door saloon version with a different rear end is also built and sold in China as the Citroën C-Triomphe. A panel van based on the coupé bodyshell is available in some markets, including Ireland.

===Technology===
A major selling point of the C4 was its extensive use of technology. For example, the car features the &quot;lane departure warning system&quot; (only in the top-of-the-range &quot;exclusive&quot; model), which alerts the driver if he or she crosses a road marking without using the turn signals; directional headlights; perfume dispenser integrated into the ventilation system; translucent dashboard; transparent glass roof; electronic stability program (ESP), and a fixed steering wheel hub, which lets the driver operate several functions of the car without removing their hands from the wheel.

The fixed hub also allows for the first production use of a &quot;shaped&quot; driver airbag. Because the hub maintains a constant position, the airbag can be optimally shaped to spread the load across the greatest possible area of the driver&#x27;s body in a collision, thus reducing the chances of serious injury. In addition, the car features an innovative centrally mounted translucent LCD speedometer display that remains clearly visible in all lighting conditions.

The car&#x27;s in-car entertainment, integrated into the car&#x27;s information system via VAN bus, is not Digital audio broadcasting (DAB) ready. MP3 playback is supported by the entry level audio system and high-end audio, with double-layer sound-insulated windows and integrated navigation system available as extras. In September 2007, a USB box accessory (Ref: 9702.EZ) was released to enable full iPod connectivity with the standard RD4 radio.

The C4 does not feature Citroën&#x27;s Hydractive suspension, which is reserved for higher class models, such as the C5 and C6. The Picasso version can feature a pneumatic rear suspension. The C4 breaks with the past on other fronts, in particular by removing the rear autodirezionale solution, used up to that time on the Xsara and ZX. The suspension is the usual type MacPherson strut front suspension with coil springs, while the rear has interconnected wheels with torsion beam and torsion bars. The braking system includes ventilated discs on the front, and rear solid discs with ABS and ESP (not standard versions with basic fittings). The steering is rack and pinion with electro-hydraulic power steering.

===2008 facelift===
At the 2008 Moscow International Automobile Salon, Citroën presented a facelifted Citroën C4. Both hatchback and coupé were subject to a slight cosmetic makeover that involved the front end, which now sported a &quot;mouth&quot; and larger trapezoid shape. The grille was redesigned, making it slightly curved. There were also minor updates at the back. The redesign led to a slight lengthening of the car body, and was the occasion for more news: from the mechanical point of view was the arrival of the 1.6 Prince, with variable valve timing and aspiration, and turbocharged and direct injection, already mounted on the Peugeot 207 and 308, as well as the Mini. Ride comfort was improved, and the more simplified saloon and the coupe were offered for the same price. In addition, the diesel versions were available with Airdream pack, which allowed for slightly reduced emissions and consumption.
===C-Triomphe / C4 Pallas / C4 Sedan===
The saloon version was introduced as the Citroën C-Triomphe, a mid-size saloon automobile produced from April 2006 for the Chinese market by Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën Automobile, a joint venture between the French PSA Group (Peugeot-Citroën) and the Chinese manufacturer Dongfeng.

This new model range was designed to supplement other Chinese models, such as the Fukang and the Elysée, rather than being a direct replacement.

In April 2007, Citroën announced that the four-door C4 would be built in Argentina. The Argentinian and Brazilian versions are sold as the C4 Pallas and C4 Sedan in some South American and European markets.

The car is a notchback saloon version of the European C4 model, since the Chinese market prefers traditional three-box saloons over hatchbacks. It did not keep the designation, however, because in Chinese, the number &quot;4&quot; is unlucky. The saloon is much larger than the hatchback: its length is over the hatchback&#x27;s and its wheelbase measures against of the hatchback. This caused the C-Triomphe saloon to be classified in the large family car class. The C-Triomphe has a number of unique features, such as an integrated air freshener, which allows the driver to choose the scent of the interior.

=== C-Quatre ===
In 2009, in China, the C-Triomphe was accompanied by the Citroën C-Quatre, a smaller (length , wheelbase ), cheaper, and more fashionably styled saloon version of the C4. A hatchback C-Quatre was also manufactured et sold locally. Late 2011, the hatchback got an offroad-looked variant called C4 Cross. In 2012, Citroën unveiled a new facelift version of the whole C-Quatre range at the Shanghai Motor Show.

=== C4 saloon (BZ3; 2015) ===
In China, a saloon version simply called Citroën C4 (or by its full name, Dongfeng Citroën C4 Sega, sometimes transcribed C4 Shijia) was available from 2015 to 2019. The Citroen C4 was based on the original Citroen C-Quatre (which it quickly replaced), with the same old platforms and the same wheelbase, and both cars also share the 1.6-liter base engine. Unlike the C-Quatre, the C4 was a failure in China, with 102,597 vehicles manufactured during its whole career. More 4-door C-Quatre were sold during the year 2012 alone.
===Picasso version===

The C4 Picasso is the MPV version of the C4 range. It has been made available since 2006 in two versions: 5-seater C4 Picasso and 7-seater C4 Grand Picasso. The C4 Picasso received a facelift in 2010, with updated engine, headlights, and mechanics. The engine range is composed largely of the same version of the engine as used on the hatchback and coupé, plus the petrol 1.8, and was also available in bi-fuel (natural gas or LPG) in many markets.

===Advertising===

The car&#x27;s advanced technology was the focus of a well-known television advertising campaign showing the car transforming into a giant dancing Transformer, accompanied by the song &quot;Jacques Your Body (Make Me Sweat)&quot; by Les Rythmes Digitales. At the end of the sequence, the robot transforms back into a car, over the slogan &quot;Alive With Technology&quot;. The dance moves were based on the concept of a Transformers break dance routine, developed from moves recorded by the agents from Justin Timberlake&#x27;s choreographer Marty Kudelka. Although the advertisement was produced by a music group from Canada, and the scenery was downtown Vancouver, the car is not available in North America. The entire sequence and scenery were digitally created. Apple Shake was used to digitally generate visual effects. This commercial has since been credited to District 9 director Neill Blomkamp.

The follow-up ad featured a similar transformer robot ice skating at high speed across a frozen lake, dodging around obstacles and executing a hockey stop in front of a group of engineers before transforming back into a car. It featured the song &quot;Walking Away (Tocadisco Remix)&quot; by The Egg.

The third ad broadcasting shows a third transformer robot sprinting along a road, changing to car form and back to robot form during the run. It features the song &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot; by Brahms. It is not on the Citroën C4 website.

The fourth ad featuring yet another transforming robot is being aired in Europe for the revamped C4. The robot struts through town showing off, accompanied by a cover version of the Bee Gees song &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; by MC Lita.

In July 2007, filming began in São Paulo, Brazil, for a commercial for South America, starring North American actor Kiefer Sutherland and Argentine actress Araceli González. One month early, a controversial advertisement announcing the collision of an asteroid with planet Earth, given the appearance of real news, was used in Brazil to promote the release of C4 Pallas, and there is an asteroid named 2 Pallas.

A video game titled &quot;Citroën C4 Robot&quot; was developed by Istanbul-based developer 2GEN Studio and released on April 21, 2008. It is a free racing advergame in which the player can either create an account and try to beat another player&#x27;s record or can play offline.

==Second generation (B7; 2010)==
===Debut===
The second-generation Citroën C4 made its debut at the 2010 Paris Salon before it was launched in September. After its launch, it debuted at the Paris Motor Show in October 2010 and went on sale in Europe under the Citroën brand one month later. The new model was slightly bigger than the last and was only available with five doors. A three-door version was omitted by the French company because of the low sales of the previous generation three-door, and to avoid the risk of cannibalizing the DS3 sales. The derived first-generation DS4 (B75) was offered as a more stylish and luxurious alternative.

===Design===
Compared to the outgoing model, the average new design of the French line is less eccentric. In general, the lines are less rounded, the front is characterized by large clusters with aggressive design &quot;cut&quot; on the top and a &quot;step&quot; on the underside. Clearly visible in the front grille is the Citroën, formed by extensions of the central logo. The engine hood is made more aggressive by two longitudinal ribs, while the bumper, which is also aggressive, has a rather large mouth, flanked by two air intakes and two slots for the fog lights.

The side view shows two longitudinal ribs, one just above the line of door handles and the other at the bottom. The tail is characterized by clusters that penetrate partially into the side and partly in the boot lid. The large bumper appears massive from the rearview but at the same time, it raises the threshold for overload. The dashboard of the second C4 series is characterized by blue-lit instrumentation in different shades, combining analog and digital technology. The dashboard, with the now ever-present display, is also modern in styling, and has some ribs, especially at the top, which complement the external lines of the bodywork. The steering wheel doesn&#x27;t have a fixed hub like the first generation. The seats have a sporty design, with padded side panels, but offer little lateral support. The sofa is divisible according to the now familiar pattern 60–40, but it is not tilting. The luggage compartment offers up to 408 liters for the standard, expandable up to 1,183, by lowering the rear seat backrest.
The second-generation C4 received a facelift in 2015. The hatchback stayed in production until early 2018.

===Engines===

The second series of C4 is provided with specific tires with low rolling resistance, and out of the 200 kg of polymer used in each sample, about 30 are environmentally friendly.

The structure of the Mk2 C4, and C4-II, is derived from that of the first series: even the wheelbase was unchanged, but there are some new features in this case. To make the car more comfortable, suspension geometry was slightly modified, and new bushes are used, albeit still MacPherson struts in front and torsion beam at the rear. The brakes are disc all around, the front ones being ventilated, with ABS and ESP standard across the range. The rack and pinion steering with electro-hydraulic power steering is carried over from the previous C4. The engine range includes three petrol and four diesel engines:
*1.4 VTi: 1397 cc, 
*1.6 VTi: 1598 cc, 
*1.6 THP: 1598 cc, turbo, 
*1.6 HDi: 1560 cc, 
*1.6 HDi 16v: 1560 cc, 
*1.6 e-HDi 16v: 1560 cc, with Start &amp; Stop
*2.0 HDi 16v: 1997 cc, 

The e-HDi engine, which debuted on the C4 (and simultaneously on the C4 Picasso based on the first series), is mated to a 6-speed automatic gearbox, as well as the 1.6 engine THP. The other engines are available with a manual 5-speed (1.4 VTi, 1.6 VTi and 1.6 HDi 92 hp) or 6-speed (1.6 HDi112 hp and 2.0 HDi). The 1.6 VTi is also available with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

===C4L, C4 Lounge and C4 Sedan (B73; 2012)===
At the end of 2012, Citroën unveiled the saloon version called &quot;C4L&quot;. The saloon version was designed by the new PSA Style Centre in Shanghai. It is produced for the Chinese market in the Wuhan plant, and for the Russian market in the Kaluga plant.

The platform is the same as the C4 hatchback, with the wheelbase increased by . The engine range was composed of the 1.6 VTI Prince THP from , and the new 1.8 VTI with only for the Chinese market. All models are equipped with stop-start system.

The C4 saloon is manufactured in El Palomar, Argentina, and was planned for launch in the Latin American market in late 2013. In 2013, it contained 62% of regionally-made parts.

The name of the vehicle is C4L in China, C4 Lounge in South America and C4 Sedan in Russia.

It was facelifted in 2016 for China and Russia, and in 2017 for South America. The design of the three versions has been standardized on the occasion of this facelift.

In 2019, the Chinese model received a new interior.

In China, the C4L was discontinued in 2020. The C4 Lounge was also discontinued in Brazil late 2020, but stayed manufactured in Argentina to sold in local market until 2021. The Russian market C4 Sedan was assembled up to 2022.
==Third generation (C41; 2020)==
The third-generation C4 (C41) was revealed on 16 June 2020 with a coupe SUV styling. The interior receives a significant upgrade, as there are more upmarket materials and a larger, wider touchscreen. The new C4 and ë-C4 are larger and based on an all-new EMP1 platform shared with the DS 3 Crossback, Opel Mokka, Opel Corsa, Peugeot 2008 and Peugeot 208.

A four-door fastback-styling saloon version called the C4 X was unveiled in June 2022.

=== ë-C4 ===

The electric drive version, named the ë-C4, features a electric motor and a 50 kWh battery, capable of of range under the WLTP test.

=== C4 X and ë-C4 X (C43; 2022) ===

A longer variation of the C4 with a saloon body style, called the C4 X, was unveiled in June 2022. It is the first Citroën to be designed under Pierre Leclercq supervision. According to Citroën, the C4 X merges the elements of a fastback, a 4-door saloon and an SUV.

The C4 and the C4 X have the same wheelbase. Using the traditional saloon-style boot opening, the cargo capacity has been increased from in the C4 to in the C4 X.

An electric version, called ë-C4 X, is also available. It is the only version offered in many countries (UK, Benelux, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Nordic countries) where the ICE C4 X was not sold. However, due to customer demand the ICE C4 X was made available in the UK in June 2023.

===2025 facelift===
At the 2024 Paris Motor Show, Citroën unveiled the facelifted models of both the C4 and C4 X which are inspired from the Oli concept car previewed in 2022. Both models have a redesigned front fascia with the inclusion of latest brand logo and the C4 received a redesigned rear fascia with new LED taillights. Inside, there are new Advanced Comfort seats with thicker foam padding, a new 7&quot; digital instrument cluster and the touchscreen infotainment system receives updated software. Other changes include new mild hybrid engines and the manual transmission option has been discontinued.

=== C4 Cactus (2014–present) ===

The C4 Cactus is a subcompact crossover produced in PSA&#x27;s Villaverde factory in Madrid, Spain since the first quarter of 2014. Sales commenced in France in June 2014. Although branded as the C4 Cactus, it is based on the smaller PF1 platform that underpins the C3 and the DS 3. In Europe, it was succeeded by the third generation C4, dropping the &quot;Cactus&quot; suffix.

==Sales and production==

==C4 in rallying==

A much-anticipated C4 World Rally Car, intended to replace the multiple World Rally Championship-winning Citroën Xsara WRC, was first sighted in 2004 with testing duties assigned to double world rally champion Carlos Sainz. Having once been earmarked for a late 2005 competitive debut, the decision by the controlling PSA Group to withdraw both Citroën and stablemates Peugeot from works participation at the end of the 2005 season led to the momentary abandonment of the project.

Since then, however, the marque etched in a comeback for the 2007 season, during which a revived C4 WRC was scheduled for its official debut, with the then-thrice world champion Sébastien Loeb as the official first driver, and Dani Sordo, the 2005 Junior World Rally Champion, later confirmed alongside him after an impressive 2006 season for the Spaniard. In their official debut at the 2007 Monte Carlo Rally, the two C4 WRCs finished 1–2, with Loeb winning ahead of Sordo. Loeb has subsequently secured the 2007, 2008, and 2009 drivers&#x27; titles, with Citroën claiming the 2008 and 2009 manufacturers&#x27; championships.

In the 2009 season, Citroën&#x27;s satellite team, Citroën Junior Team, ran a C4 WRC for Evgeny Novikov, Conrad Rautenbach, and the 2008 junior world champion Sébastien Ogier. For the 2010 season, the team ran a C4 WRC for Ogier and the Formula One world champion Kimi Räikkönen. The 2003 world rally champion Petter Solberg competes in a C4 WRC for his private team. The C4 WRC was replaced by the DS3 WRC for the 2011 WRC season.

Citroën also unveiled a hybrid concept WRC car at the 2008 Paris Motor Show. The Citroën C4 WRC Hymotion4 uses a KERS system similar to that in the Peugeot 908 HY.

==Awards==
The first generation C4 scored second place at the 2005 European Car of the Year awards. It won the 2006 World Car Design of the Year, as well as the &quot;Autosport&quot; Rally Car of the Year in 2010

The second generation C4 (from 2010 onwards) was awarded a Euro NCAP Advanced Award for its eTouch Emergency &amp; Assistance System.

In 2023, the Citroën ë-C4 won the category of the &#x27;Best Used Small Electric Car&#x27; at the Carbuyer Best Used Car Awards.

==Model car releases==
The C4 Coupe has been produced by Majorette, Norev, and Solido, and the hatchback has been produced by Norev, and NewRay. The Citroën C4 WRC has been produced by Hot Wheels.

<text>Club Atlético Unión (; mostly known as Unión de Santa Fe ) is a sports club from Santa Fe, the capital city of the Santa Fe Province, in Argentina. The club was founded on 15 April 1907.
Unión is mostly known for its football team and currently plays in the Argentine Primera División.

Other sports practised at the club include basketball, futsal, gymnastics, field hockey, swimming, karate, rugby union, roller skating, and volleyball. The basketball team competes in Liga Nacional de Básquet, the top division of basketball in Argentina.

== History ==

The club was established by a group of fourteen former members of Santa Fe Foot-ball Club, on April 13, 1907 after a meeting held in the Baragiola family on Catamarca street. Guillermo Drenner was appointed as president of the institution. Initially the club was named &quot;Club United&quot; after a proposal from founding member Cayetano Bossi, who alleged that the club should represent the friendship ties of the founders. The name changed to &quot;Unión Foot-Ball Club&quot; in 1907, remaining until 1918 when it was translated to &quot;Club Atlético Unión&quot; in Spanish language.

The first shirt worn was white with black collar. In 1907 a meeting was held with the purpose of choosing the club colors. Some of the models proposed were a red, white and black striped, while other members proposed a white and red striped shirt (inspired on legendary Alumni Athletic Club uniform), which finally won after being voted by the majority.

The first match played by the team was vs a San Carlos Centro on 15 May 1907, won by Unión 4–1. Unión was also a founding member (along with Argentine, Central Santa Fe, Brown, Red Star, Sarmiento, San Justo Football Club y Estudiantes de Comercio) the &quot;Liga Regional Santafesina&quot;, where the team won the title four consecutive times. In 1910 the club moved their field to a land on Boulevard Pellegrini and San Jerónimo. In 1911 Unión requested affiliation to &quot;Liga Rosarina de Football&quot; which would allow them to play with stronger teams and more competitive tournaments so teams of Liga Rosarina participated in national cups with teams from Buenos Aires. The LRF accepted the request in 1912, and Unión debuted there vs. Argentino (3–3 tie). The first win in Liga Rosarina was vs Aprendices Rosarinos with the following line-up: José Luis Peíteado; Saúl Galetti, Domingo Pallavidini; José Ayala, Alfredo González, Domingo Gómez; Gregorio Aguirre, Arturo Pérez, Manuel Montenegro, Elías Pieretti, Domiciano Roa.

On 26 November 1966, Unión was promoted to the Primera División for the first time, after defeating Talleres (RE) 3–0 and winning the 1966 Segunda División title.

Unión&#x27;s supporters are called &quot;unionistas&quot;, &quot;tatengues&quot;, while the squad is usually nicknamed &quot;El Tate&quot;. The colours of the club consist of red and white vertical stripes.
Managed by Juan Carlos Lorenzo in 1975, Unión made a great campaign in the 1975 championship with a group of notable players such as goalkeeper Hugo Gatti, midfielders Victorio Cocco and Rubén Suñé and forwards Ernesto Mastrángelo and Leopoldo Luque among others.

In 1979 Unión played the final matches of the Nacional championship, but lost at the hands of River Plate, because the goal scored by River in the first match (with a final score of 1–1) ended up in an average over Union according to the away goals rule applied to that tournament.

Amongst the most famous footballers who played for Unión are Leopoldo Luque, World Cup winner with Argentina in 1978, and Nery Pumpido, the goalkeeper of the national team that won the World Cup in Mexico 1986.

==Rivalry==
Unión and Colón are the two largest football clubs in Santa Fe. The Clásico Santafesino has been played since 1913 and is known as one of football&#x27;s fiercest and most important rivalries in Argentina. Unión and Colón have played 147 games all time against each other in the Amateur and Professional Era, with Unión winning 48, Colón winning 43, 51 draws and 5 no contest (there are no records for those matches, which took place between 1913 and 1917).

<doc id="1255905" wikidata="Q3291097" url="?curid=1255905" title="Borabenzene">
<text>Borabenzene is a hypothetical organoboron compound with the formula C5H5B. Unlike the related but highly stable benzene molecule, borabenzene would be electron-deficient. Related derivatives are the boratabenzene anions, including the parent [C5H5BH]−.

==Adducts==
Adducts of borabenzene with Lewis bases are isolatable. Since borabenzene is unavailable, these adducts require indirect methods. 4-Silyl-1-methoxyboracyclohexadiene is used as a precursor to the borabenzene:

: + → + MeOSiMe3

The pyridine adduct is structurally related to biphenyl. It is a yellow whereas biphenyl is colorless, indicating distinct electronic structures. The pyridine ligand is tightly bound: no exchange is observed with free pyridine, even at elevated temperatures.

<text>Princess Alexandra of Hanover (Alexandra Charlotte Ulrike Maryam Virginia; born 20 July 1999) is a Monegasque figure skater and the fourth child of Princess Caroline of Monaco and the third of Ernst August, Prince of Hanover.

== Early life and family ==
Alexandra was born on 20 July 1999 in Vöcklabruck, Upper Austria. She was christened on 19 September that year by Horst Hirschler, Landesbischof of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover, in a ceremony at her father&#x27;s hunting lodge Auerbach, near Grünau im Almtal, Upper Austria. Her godparents are her paternal aunt Alexandra, Princess of Leiningen, maternal half-sister Charlotte Casiraghi, Ulrike Ulmschneider, Maryam Sachs, Virginia Gallico, George Condo, and Eric Maier. She was named after each of her godmothers.

She has half-siblings from her parents&#x27; previous marriages. From her father&#x27;s previous marriage, she has two half-brothers, Hereditary Prince Ernst August and Prince Christian of Hanover. From her mother&#x27;s previous marriage, she has two half-brothers, Andrea and Pierre Casiraghi, and one half-sister, Charlotte Casiraghi. Her maternal uncle, Albert II, is the sovereign of Monaco. She is a granddaughter of American actress Grace Kelly. On her father&#x27;s side, she is a descendant of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, Wilhelm II, German Emperor, and King Christian IX of Denmark. She is also a first cousin once removed of Queen Sofía of Spain and King Constantine II of the Hellenes, and a second cousin of King Felipe VI of Spain.

Alexandra is the only one of Princess Caroline&#x27;s four children who bears any royal style or title. While she is formally styled as &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra of Hanover&quot; in Monaco, she is afforded the style and title out of courtesy elsewhere. She is 13th in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne. Through her father, she was in the line of succession to the British throne until 2018, when she was confirmed into the Catholic Church.

In 2024 Princess Alexandra completed her Master of Arts in History and Literature at Columbia University in Paris.

== Figure skating career ==
Alexandra began skating when she was ten years old after receiving ice skates as a Christmas present. When she was 11 years old, she competed at a competition in Toulon, France. At the age of 12, she competed in the &quot;Skate 7&quot; class at the 10th Figure Skating Championship in Monaco, finishing in second place. She was awarded the cup of the Monegasque Federation of Skating.

Alexandra represented Monaco in figure skating at the 2015 European Youth Olympic Festival in Austria and in two competitive events during the 2015–16 season at the ISU Junior Grand Prix of Figure Skating.

== Personal life ==
When Alexandra was 11 years old, German entertainment magazine &quot;Freizeit Revue&quot; published an article about and photographs of her competing at a figure skating competition in France. The article also covered her mother&#x27;s dating life and other personal matters. Alexandra sought injunctive relief and sued the magazine, taking the case to the German Federal Court of Justice.

In March 2015, Alexandra attended Monaco&#x27;s Rose Ball for the first time. However, it was not until the next year&#x27;s ball that she entered the event with her family, thus gaining the notice of the society press.

In October 2018, Alexandra converted to Catholicism, thereby renouncing her distant place in the line of succession to the British throne.

<text>HP Foods Limited, formerly based in Birmingham, England was best known as the producer of HP, Lea &amp; Perrins, and Daddies sauce brands. It was also the UK licensee, from Heinz, of Chinese food and condiment brand Amoy Food.

Formerly the Midlands Vinegar Company and Smedley HP Foods Limited, it was acquired by Imperial Foods, a division of Imperial Group. Edward Eastwood and his nephew Edwin Samson Moore established the Midland Vinegar Company at Aston, Birmingham in 1875.

In 1939, the &quot;Birmingham Gazette&quot; noted that H.P. Sauce Ltd. also produced H.P. Tomato Ketchup, H.P. Salad Cream, H.P. Mayonnaise and the sweet pickle, Pickante. The company&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiaries included the Midland Vinegar Co., F.G. Garton &amp; Co., Mallors (Worcester Sauce), Tower Yeast Company, and Lea and Perrins. 

HP Foods Ltd was retained by Imperial&#x27;s parent company Hanson plc even after the demerger of the Imperial Group. It was sold to Groupe Danone SA in 1988 for £199 million. It was sold by Danone to Heinz in June 2005 for £470 million. However, in October of that year the takeover was referred by the UK&#x27;s Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission. After a review the Competition Commission approved the takeover and Heinz started integrating this new company into the business.

In 2007, the Aston factory was demolished, and production of HP and Daddies sauce brands was moved to the Netherlands. Bottling of Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce was returned to Worcester, having been moved in 2005 to the Aston factory. During this time, the sauce continued to be manufactured but not bottled at the Midlands Road site.

<text>The VLF transmitter DHO38 is a VLF transmitter used by the German Navy near Rhauderfehn, Saterland, Germany. It is used to transmit coded orders to submarines of the German Navy and navies of other NATO countries.

DHO38 has transmitted since 1982 on 23.4 kHz with a power of up to 800 kilowatts. The transmitter is able to transmit signals in a range from 14 to 50 kHz. DHO38 uses an umbrella antenna which is carried from eight steel tube masts with a height of 352.8 metres. Each pylon stands on three-metre-tall ceramic cylinders, which serve as insulators for voltages up to 300 kV. The masts are equipped with cylindrical oscillation dampers for better protection against storms. The transmitter is capable of transmitting signals to submarines worldwide to depths of approx. 30 metres.

== Transmission ==
The signal from DHO38 is an MSK-coded signal with 4 x 50 baud on all 4 channels on frequency 23.4 kHz. All transmissions from DHO38 are encrypted. The messages transmitted via DHO38 are processed at the naval telecommunications center Glücksburg. They are sent &quot;by cable&quot; from German and NATO offices to the protective structure there and are prepared for transmission by the responsible telecommunications operators.

<doc id="1255921" wikidata="Q387120" url="?curid=1255921" title="SEAT Arosa">
<text>The SEAT Arosa (&quot;Typ&quot; 6H) is a city car that was manufactured by the Spanish automaker SEAT from 1997 to 2004. The model débuted in March 1997 at the Geneva Motor Show, while its facelifted version was presented in October 2000 at the Paris Motor Show. It shared a platform with the Volkswagen Lupo and was mostly identical apart from equipment, styling and trim levels.

The successor, SEAT Mii, started production in December 2011.

==Pre facelift (1997–2000)==
Named after Vilagarcía de Arousa, a municipality in the province of Pontevedra, Spain, it was only available as a three door, four-seater hatchback.

The Arosa, launched in 1997, was to a large extent identical to Volkswagen&#x27;s own city car, which was introduced later in the end of 1998, Volkswagen Lupo, and both cars were based on the Volkswagen Group A00 platform, a shortened version of the A03 platform used by the larger Volkswagen Polo and SEAT Ibiza. 

The Czech motor vehicle manufacturer, Škoda, also planned their own version of the Arosa by 1998, but it was never officially introduced.

The Arosa was initially manufactured at a Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg, Germany, and only in May 1998 was the production moved to SEAT facilities in Martorell, Spain. The Arosa was designed by the same man who designed the Bugatti Veyron 16.4, Jozef Kabaň. Production lasted from February 1997 to August 2000.

==Facelift (2000–2004)==
The model later received a facelift in October 2000. The Arosa replaced the SEAT Marbella in the Spanish brand&#x27;s lineup, but itself was not replaced by any SEAT, when production ceased in July 2004. A successor eventually arrived in January 2012, with the Mii. Apart from its exterior restyling, the facelift model featured a restyled interior, with a new dashboard. 

Due to the decision taken by Volkswagen to use the Fox instead of developing any genuine replacement for the Lupo, SEAT was unable to produce their own version. In the United Kingdom, 2,500 Arosas found homes in the country in 2003, accounting for around seven per cent of the firm’s sales. Production lasted from September 2000 to July 2004.


===Engines===
The Arosa was available with the following units:

<text>Karl Ristenpart (26 January 1900 – 24 December 1967) was a German conductor.

== Career ==
Born in Kiel, Germany, he studied at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin and in Vienna. He was heavily involved in creating three orchestras in his lifetime, most notably the Chamber Orchestra of the Saar. With this group he created one of the earliest recorded collections of Bach&#x27;s orchestral music. These recordings were made between 1954 and 1967 as Les Discophiles Français, Erato and Club Français du Disque releases in France and appeared then under license with various American labels (notably Nonesuch) on both LP and cassette.

Following an out-of-print period, in 2000 the French Accord label, Universal released a six-CD set comprising the entire set of Ristenpart recordings of Bach orchestral works. The conductor and his colleagues from Saarbrücken also recorded performances of works by Mozart and Haydn, among others. The lasting fame he received for these interpretations of Baroque and early Classical music overshadowed the fact that with his Saar orchestra he actually recorded works by approximately 230 composers, at least half of them belonging to the 20th century, for the Saar radio. A possible influence in this direction was Hermann Scherchen, with whom Ristenpart&#x27;s mother was acquainted before 1914 and to whom she was married between 1919 and 1920. (Hermann Scherchen was a politically active conductor responsible for the premiere performances of what were at the time controversial pieces by composers such as Berg and Xenakis.)

In 1932 Ristenpart became the conductor of a little string ensemble in Berlin, whose core was composed of women friends of his wife, the pianist and harpsichordist Ruth Christensen. This ensemble came to be known as the Karl Ristenpart Chamber Orchestra and often played for the Berlin radio and the Deutschlandsender, mostly for exhausting live night broadcasts abroad. But Ristenpart&#x27;s career as a promising young conductor in Germany was hobbled by his refusal to join the Nazi Party.

Following World War II, Ristenpart returned to devastated Berlin and put works by Gustav Mahler, his favorite composer, on the program of his first public concert in the summer of 1945. With Berlin divided into several foreign sectors, his unblemished political record allowed him to be named conductor for the &quot;Radio in the American Sector&quot; of Berlin (RIAS). In 1946 he thus started to record music, from Monteverdi to Stravinsky, with the forces of his former Karl Ristenpart Chamber Orchestra, supplemented by vocal soloists and top musicians from other Berlin orchestras, under the label &quot;RIAS-Choir and Chamber Orchestra&quot;. This constituted the second of his important periods of orchestra development and the beginning of his breakthrough to international fame as a conductor, which was mostly built on his ambitious J.S. Bach concert cycle from March 1947 to December 1952. From this period dates the legendary Archiv production featuring baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Töttcher playing oboe and oboe da caccia in Bach&#x27;s cantatas Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen, BWV 56 and Ich habe genug, BWV 82. But the worsening of the post-war political situation in Germany in the early 1950s, particularly in Berlin where circulating between the various sectors became increasingly difficult, also created financial problems for radio broadcasting. When it became clear at the end of 1952 that the RIAS could not go on subsidizing all its orchestras, Ristenpart accepted an offer to create a new chamber orchestra for the Saar radio, with which he was also to produce LPs for Les Discophiles français (an unusual arrangement linked to the fact that the &quot;autonomous&quot; Saar region was still under French administration at the time).

Ristenpart began working in the summer of 1953 as conductor of the Saar Chamber Orchestra, which, out of an initial 16, included 10 young musicians who had come along with him from Berlin. Among them were the Hendel Quartet, whose leader, Georg Friedrich Hendel, became the orchestra&#x27;s first violin soloist. The ensuing collaboration with top French instrumental soloists was especially fruitful, leading to many tours, recordings and partnerships with soloists such as flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal and the members of his wind ensemble Le Quintette à vent Français. Some 170 LP-records featuring Ristenpart and his Saar Chamber Orchestra have been marketed under license by various record companies all over the world. These include two complete sets of the Brandenburg concertos, the Orchestral Suites and The Art of Fugue, several albums of Bach vocal cantatas, many Telemann, Vivaldi, many Mozart and Haydn works, but also award-winning records of Britten, Roussel and Hindemith pieces.
In December 1967, Ristenpart suffered a heart attack while on tour in Portugal with the chamber orchestra of the Gulbenkian Foundation and died in a Lisbon hospital on Christmas Eve. The Chamber Orchestra of the Saar was unable to survive long the dimming of its guiding light. After four years under the baton of the reputable cellist Antonio Janigro, and the death in a car accident of its core musicians, first-violin Georg Friedrich Hendel and his wife Betty Hindrichs-Hendel, first-cellist, it merged with the Saarbrücken Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1973.

<doc id="1255947" wikidata="Q1323676" url="?curid=1255947" title="Glide (API)">
<text>Glide is a 3D graphics API developed by 3dfx Interactive for their &quot;Voodoo Graphics&quot; 3D accelerator cards. It started as a proprietary API, and was later open sourced by 3dfx. It was dedicated to rendering performance, supporting geometry and texture mapping primarily, in data formats identical to those used internally in their cards. Wide adoption of 3Dfx led to Glide being extensively used in the late 1990s, but further refinement of Microsoft&#x27;s Direct3D and the appearance of full OpenGL implementations from other graphics card vendors, in addition to growing diversity in 3D hardware, eventually caused it to become superfluous.

== Glide wrappers and emulators ==
Glide emulator development has been in progress since the late 1990s. During 3dfx&#x27;s lifetime, the company was aggressive at trying to stop these attempts to emulate their proprietary API, shutting down early emulation projects with legal threats. However, just before it ceased operations and had its assets purchased by Nvidia, 3dfx released the Glide API, along with the Voodoo 2 and Voodoo 3 specifications, under an open source license, which later evolved into an open source project.

<doc id="1255949" wikidata="Q554610" url="?curid=1255949" title="Artur Rodziński">
<text>Artur Rodziński (2 January 1892 – 27 November 1958) was a Polish and American conductor of orchestral music and opera. He began his career after World War I in Poland, where he was discovered by Leopold Stokowski, who invited him to be his assistant with the Philadelphia Orchestra. This engagement led to Rodziński becoming music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He also prepared the NBC Symphony Orchestra for Arturo Toscanini before the Italian conductor&#x27;s debut with them. A dispute in Chicago led to Rodziński&#x27;s dismissal in 1948, whereupon he shifted his career to Europe, eventually settling in Italy, although continuing to maintain a home in Lake Placid, New York. In November 1958, beset by heart disease, he made his professional return to the United States for the first time in a decade, conducting acclaimed performances of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Exhausted, he checked into Massachusetts General Hospital where he died 11 days later.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Rodziński was born in Split, Kingdom of Dalmatia, on 2 January 1892. Soon afterward his father, of Polish descent and a general in the Austro-Hungarian Army, returned with his family to Lemberg, Austrian Galicia, where Artur first studied music. Under pressure from his father, enrolled in the University of Vienna to study law, where he eventually earned his diploma, but he was also simultaneously enrolled at the Royal Academy of Music and the Performing Arts where his teachers included Joseph Marx and Franz Schreker (composition), Franz Schalk (conducting), and Emil von Sauer and (piano). As a young man during World War I, Rodziński fought in the Austro-Hungarian Army; upon Poland&#x27;s independence, he enlisted in the Polish Land Forces, where he was wounded in action.

He returned to Lemberg, now Lwów, which after the war had been granted to newly independent Poland. He was first engaged as répétiteur at the Lwów Opera, eventually making his debut as a conductor in 1920 with Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot;. The following year he conducted the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra and was appointed director of the National Opera of Warsaw. It was there that while visiting Poland Leopold Stokowski heard Rodziński conduct a performance of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. Impressed, Stokowski went to meet Rodziński back stage and invited him to guest conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra. He made his American debut at Philadelphia&#x27;s Academy of Music on November 15, 1925 conducting the Philharmonic Society of Philadelphia, an orchestra that consisted of members from the Philadelphia Orchestra who played on Sunday evenings. Rodziński&#x27;s program consisted of the Act I prelude to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Sixth Symphony, the symphonic poem &quot;Powracające fale&quot; by Mieczysław Karłowicz, and two dances from the opera &quot;Halka&quot; by Stanisław Moniuszko.

===Apprenticeship under Stokowski (1925–1929)===
Subsequent to his American debut, Rodziński continued his role as guest conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra and Philharmonic Society of Philadelphia until August 1926. Stokowski had declared since 1925 his intention to appoint Rodziński as his assistant conductor, but was stalled by the former orchestra&#x27;s board, which balked at the choice. The appointment was finally approved in September 1926. Rodziński thereafter adopted a number of the elder conductor&#x27;s mannerisms and techniques, including how to style his hair, some of which he maintained until the end of his life.

Over the span of the next few years, Rodziński&#x27;s renown grew. He rehearsed the Philadelphia Orchestra in performances of new music that Stokowski would lead in concert. A lighting system similar to a traffic signal was devised through which Stokowski could silently indicate to his assistant his interpretive requests in mid-rehearsal. Rodziński came to resent this system, which he later used as a reminder to treat his own assistants with respect. He acknowledged that his training allowed him to easily grasp and execute new scores in his later career. In addition to his work with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Rodziński conducted at the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company, as well as taught at the Curtis Institute of Music, where he coached many young musicians who would play with him in later years. He also toured with the Philadelphia Orchestra in the southern United States in performances that drew critical acclaim. &quot;[T]he magic wielding of the baton by Dr. Rodziński made this the most satisfying concert I have attended in recent years,&quot; wrote one critic in South Carolina. In 1926, when the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra was reestablished after being defunct for 16 years, Rodziński, with the support of Stokowski, was considered for the role of music director.

As Rodziński&#x27;s career developed, the conductor increasingly resented his manager Arthur Judson, who also managed the Philadelphia Orchestra. Rodziński repeatedly expressed irritation that Judson did not do enough to advocate on his behalf; later he was dismayed to find that his manager often acted against his best interests. After conducting the New York City premiere of Nikolai Myaskovsky&#x27;s Sixth Symphony in November 1926, Rodziński came to the attention of William Andrews Clark Jr., a wealthy philanthropist from Southern California who had founded the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1919 and himself had an acrimonious relationship with Judson. Their meeting led to guest engagements in Los Angeles. Rodziński made his debut there on January 19, 1928, as a replacement for then music director Georg Schnéevoigt, who was in Detroit at the time. His demeanor and skill quickly won the admiration of the orchestra; the concert itself drew praise from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;:

The word fiery best describes [Rodziński&#x27;s] conducting. ... His magnetism was immediately felt both by the orchestra and the audience. There were no barriers in either case, as the railing was down and he used no music between himself and his orchestra. The fire was restrained, however, and although on occasions he would break into long abandoned movements of the arms, his commands to the orchestra were usually given with significant gestures of the hand and descriptive curling of the fingers. In those fingers and the leonine head he expressed the prima-donna conductor, a type we have known little in the West, but immensely interesting type withal.

Rodziński&#x27;s subsequent successes as guest conductor in Los Angeles culminated with the announcement that he would succeed Schnéevoigt beginning October 1929. He resigned from his post at the Philadelphia Orchestra and said that he was leaving on the best of terms.

===Los Angeles (1929–1933)===

Before the start of the Los Angeles Philharmonic&#x27;s 1929–1930 season, Rodziński journeyed to the city with his family on May 23, 1929. They settled into the Chapman Park Hotel, which was located in what is today Koreatown; later the family moved into a home in Santa Monica. Rodziński supervised auditions for new musicians and discussed programming for the coming season with Clark and the Philharmonic&#x27;s managers. He and his family also spent part of the summer vacationing in Santa Barbara. Soloists for Rodziński&#x27;s first season in Los Angeles were announced in June; they included Sergei Prokofiev, Vladimir Horowitz, Jacques Thibaud, Josef Lhévinne, Gregor Piatigorsky, and Claire Dux. By September, the orchestra had announced their forthcoming programs. Rodziński insisted on expanding the programming of new music:

When people go into art galleries nowadays, they see new pictures by modern artists as well as the old masterpieces ... why shouldn&#x27;t it be so in the concert hall?

Among the works that Rodziński scheduled for local premieres in his first season were Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Fourth Symphony, Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s First Symphony, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold&#x27;s suite from his incidental music to &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;.

===Cleveland (1933–1943)===

Rodziński was named the second music director of the Cleveland Orchestra in 1933, following the departure of Nikolai Sokoloff. One of Rodziński&#x27;s main contributions to Cleveland&#x27;s music scene was integrating opera into the Cleveland Orchestra&#x27;s repertoire. In addition, he sought to perform more contemporary music, including works by Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Alban Berg, Dmitri Shostakovich, Jerome Kern, and the first Cleveland performances of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;.

Under Rodziński&#x27;s leadership, the orchestra presented the United States premiere of Shostakovich&#x27;s opera, &quot;Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,&quot; in 1935, a year after its debut in the Soviet Union. The conductor secured the rights to the American premiere of the opera through the mediation of William Christian Bullitt Jr., then the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union and himself an admirer of Shostakovich&#x27;s opera. Rodziński competed against his mentor Stokowski for the performance rights. Although Rodziński worried about the Cleveland audience&#x27;s reception for the provocative opera, the orchestra&#x27;s performances proved a success. Shostakovich himself had faith in Rodziński&#x27;s performance: &quot;When you see the Cleveland Orchestra&#x27;s presentation of the American premiere of my opera in Severance Hall the last day of January, you will see no traditional opera…I have repudiated all old forms of opera.&quot;

One of the most famous recordings made during Rodziński&#x27;s tenure in Cleveland was of an orchestral arrangement of Kern&#x27;s 1927 musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;, made by the composer himself as &quot;Show Boat Scenario for Orchestra&quot; after being suggested to compose it by the conductor. The piece was recorded by the orchestra in 1941; Rodziński conducted it 38 times over a three-year period.

Rodziński was guest conducting the New York Philharmonic on December 7, 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Although Rodziński declined to announce the news—the concert was being broadcast live on the radio—he led the Philharmonic in a performance of the Star-Spangled Banner. Later, he noted that the demands of World War II on young men should inspire orchestras to take the then unprecedented step of adding women to their ranks, saying that they would be &quot;an excellent addition to any first class symphony orchestra.&quot; Rodziński championed equal treatment for women in all fields of classical music from early in his career: &quot;It makes no difference, there are no rules, women surely can be just as great artists as men ... if they have talent or genius, they are all the same.&quot;

Between December 1939 and February 1942, Rodziński and The Cleveland Orchestra made an extensive series of recordings for Columbia Records. He also appeared with the New York Philharmonic in 1934 and 1937, receiving positive reviews for his concert performance of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elektra.&quot; In addition, Rodziński was active across Europe, becoming the first naturalized American citizen to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic at the Salzburg Festival in 1936 and 1937. At Arturo Toscanini&#x27;s recommendation, Rodziński was asked by NBC to select musicians for the new NBC Symphony Orchestra. Later, he trained the orchestra, guided some of its first recordings (issued on the budget label World&#x27;s Greatest Music with neither conductor nor orchestra identified), and led its concerts before Toscanini&#x27;s arrival. This engagement inspired Rodziński to depart Cleveland for New York, where he became music director and conductor of the New York Philharmonic beginning in the 1943–44 season.

===New York and Chicago===
Rodziński was appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1943. Although his four-year tenure was marked by struggles with Arthur Judson, the manager of the orchestra, Rodziński achieved high standards of performance. The renowned music critic and composer Virgil Thomson wrote about Rodziński&#x27;s tenure at the Philharmonic: &quot;We now have an orchestra that is a joy to hear...and we owe it all to Artur Rodziński.&quot; During Rodziński&#x27;s time on the podium the Philharmonic recorded extensively, again for Columbia, performed weekly live broadcasts on CBS Radio, and appeared in the feature film &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot;.

However, despite the quality of the orchestra&#x27;s performances, numerous artistic matters such as the prerogative of the music director to dismiss musicians, select soloists and determine repertoire were persistent grounds of contention. Not willing to compromise on these matters, Rodziński resigned in 1947. His reputation as a conductor was so prominent at this time that his resignation was the subject of a cover story in &quot;Time&quot; magazine in February 1947.

The Chicago Symphony Orchestra had been interested in engaging Rodziński for some time, and now he decided to accept the leadership of that orchestra immediately, starting with the 1947–1948 season. Here again, an inability to work with the board resulted in his swift departure after only one season. His short tenure still had a significant impact upon the orchestra and local audiences through performances such as an account of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; with Kirsten Flagstad.

===Last years===

After his departure from Chicago, Rodziński&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. There was little recording activity available to him in the U.S., and so he settled in Europe once more. Here his status as a major musician was recognized and he was invited to lead significant productions, such as the 1953 first performance of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; at the Maggio Musicale in Florence, as well as traditional repertoire works.

He conducted at La Scala and worked extensively for Italian radio, conducting well received readings of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and &quot;Tristan&quot;, and Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;. He re-established his presence as a recording artist through a contract with Westminster Records, for whom he recorded extensively with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (under the pseudonym &quot;Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of London&quot;) from 1955. His final recordings were for EMI in 1958.

By this time, the state of Rodziński&#x27;s health had become fragile. He was warned by his Italian doctor that further conducting activity would put his life at risk. However, he returned to Chicago in 1958 to conduct &quot;Tristan&quot; once again, this time with the Chicago Lyric Opera and soprano Birgit Nilsson. His return was a triumph, but these were his last performances and he died shortly afterwards.

==Personal life==
Rodziński was married twice and had two sons. In 1917 he married the concert pianist Mme. Ilse, and in 1918 they had a son, Witold, who became an historian, sinologist, and diplomat. In 1934, while living in Cleveland, he married Halina Lilpop Wieniawski (1905-1993), who was from a well-known Warsaw family.

Their infant son Richard was the subject of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s amusing canon &quot;I am almost sure when your nurse will change your diapers.&quot; Richard served as artistic administrator at the San Francisco Opera and Metropolitan Opera companies in the 1960s and 1970s. He recently retired from his position as president of the Van Cliburn Foundation and in 2009 became the General Director of the International Tchaikovsky Competition. In 1976 Halina Rodziński wrote the autobiography &quot;Our Two Lives&quot;, still the most extensive published account of Rodziński&#x27;s life and career.

==Recordings==

Rodziński recorded for Columbia Records (with the Cleveland Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic); RCA Victor (with the Chicago Symphony); Westminster Records (the Royal Philharmonic); and EMI. A few of his later recordings were taped in stereo and have remained in circulation to this day. His complete recording of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; for Westminster was recorded in stereo in 1956.

The stereo version was originally released on 2-track reel-to-reel audio tape. On LP it was initially released only in mono, then later in stereo as stereo record albums became available in 1958. The stereo &quot;Nutcracker&quot; was re-released in 2001 by Deutsche Grammophon on compact disc.

Live recordings of some of his broadcast performances with the New York Philharmonic and the RAI-Radio Italiana orchestra have also become available on independent labels. Rodziński&#x27;s highly acclaimed 1937 concert performance of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elektra&quot; with soprano Rose Pauly and the New York Philharmonic has been restored and was issued on CD by the Immortal Performances label in 2014.

<text>Jinghong (; ; , , ; , ; , ; also formerly romanised as &quot;Chiang Hung&quot;, &quot;Chengrung&quot;, &quot;Cheng Hung&quot;, Jeng Hung, &quot;Jinghung&quot;, &quot;Keng Hung&quot;, &quot;Kiang Hung&quot; and &quot;Muangjinghung&quot;) is a city in and the seat of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, in the far south of China&#x27;s Yunnan province, and the historic capital of the former Tai kingdom of Sipsongpanna.

==History==
The town was founded as Chiang Hung (Cheli), by Tai king Phanya Coeng in 1180.

===Kingdom of Chiang Hung (Sipsongpanna)===
During the Mongol Yuan Dynasty in China, the Tai kingdom of Sipsongpanna began a close and long-lasting relationship to Lanna, another historic Tai kingdom that lay south. In 1296, Lanna&#x27;s capital Chiang Mai was founded by Mangrai, whose maternal grandfather was King Rung Kaen Chai () of Jinghong (i.e.: Sipsongpanna).

The kingdoms of Sipsongpanna and Lanna maintained ties through migration and intermarriage.

In 1401, the Sipsongpanna Tai ruler Tau Se Da Xam (pinyin: Dao Xianda) attacked a smaller Tai area to the north unknown as Weiyuan equivalent to modern Jinggu). The Ming administration sought to retaliate but adopted a cautious response of diplomacy and Tau Se Da Xam withdrew his troops. About this period Sipsongpanna began to pay tribute to the Ming.

In 1405 the Sipsongpanna Tai attacked Chiang Mai, in conjunction with Ming Chinese troops.

In 1421 the Chinese attempted to cause a split in Sipsongpanna by backing multiple administrations during a period of civil strife, but their plan failed to succeed.

1448 saw the defeat of Mong Mao, a Tai state in eastern Burma, by a combination of Chinese, Sipsongpanna and allied forces united under the Ming.

In the 1450s another struggle for succession arose in Sipsongpanna, with one faction backed by Kengtung and one by Chiang Mai. Despite the Kengtung faction&#x27;s victory, conflict started with that state shortly afterwards.

The Burmese Toungoo state arose in the 1530s to crush Chiang Mai, and its influence also extended to Kengtung and Sipsongpanna, which like other Tai kingdoms soon began to pay tribute.

==Geography and climate==

Jinghong has a latitude range of 21°27&#x27;–22°36&#x27; N and a longitude range of 100°25&#x27;–101°31&#x27; E. It borders Pu&#x27;er City to the north, Mengla County to the east and Menghai County to the west, as well as Burma&#x27;s Shan State to the south. The city is limited to the south by Hengduan Mountains, and the Lancang River (Mekong) passes through Jinghong. Two bridges near the city span this river, which flows south-east towards Laos.

Climatically, Jinghong has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;) bordering on the tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;). The city has a generally humid climate with strong monsoonal influences. Summer is long and there is virtually no &quot;winter&quot; as such; instead, there is a dry season (December thru April) and wet season (May thru October). Annual sunshine hours amount to between 1800 and 2300 and annual rainfall ranging from . The coolest month are December and January, averaging , while the warmest is June, at ; the annual mean is . However, high temperatures reach their peak in April before the onset of the monsoon from the Indian Ocean.

==Administrative divisions==
Jinghong City has 1 subdistrict, 5 towns, 3 townships and 2 ethnic townships. 
;1 subdistrict
* Yunjinghong Subdistrict ()
;5 towns

;3 townships
* Jingne ()
* Dadugang ()

<doc id="1255957" wikidata="Q3442402" url="?curid=1255957" title="Gayle language">
<text>Gayle, or Gail, is an English- and Afrikaans-based gay argot or slang used primarily by English and Afrikaans-speaking homosexual men in urban communities of South Africa, and is similar in some respects to Polari in the United Kingdom, from which some lexical items have been borrowed. The equivalent language used by gay South African men who speak Bantu languages is called &quot;IsiNgqumo&quot;, and is based on a Nguni lexicon.

Gayle originally manifested as &quot;moffietaal&quot; (Afrikaans: literally, &quot;homosexual language&quot;) in the drag culture of the Cape Coloured community in the 1950s. It permeated into white homosexual circles in the 1960s and became part of mainstream white gay culture.

Besides a few core words borrowed from Polari (such as the word &quot;varda&quot; meaning &quot;to see&quot;, itself a borrowing from Lingua Franca), most of Gayle&#x27;s words are alliterative formations using women&#x27;s names, such as &quot;Beulah&quot; for &quot;beauty&quot;, &quot;Priscilla&quot;, meaning &quot;police&quot;, and &quot;Hilda&quot; for &quot;hideous&quot;. Men, especially other homosexual men, are often referred to by female pronouns in some circles, as is the custom among many homosexual countercultures throughout the world.

Gayle arose for the same reason that most antilanguages develop, to ensure in-group preference in diverse societies. However it also fulfilled other functions such as to &quot;camp up&quot; conversation, and provide entertainment in a subculture where verbal wit and repartee are highly valued.

A comprehensive study of Gayle was undertaken by linguist Ken Cage in 2002, and his Master’s Thesis was published as “Gayle, the language of Kinks and Queens” (2003: Jacana Media). This book, although out of print now, was the first attempt to publish a history of Gayle, as well as a basic dictionary of the argot.

More recently, Gayle has experienced a resurgence and increased popularity following the Showmax series Beaulah: Queens Van die Kaap - a 2024 reality TV show that documents the lives and talents of prominent and upcoming drag queens from the Cape Town drag scene. 
Gayle has also seen some vitality on Tik Tok.

<doc id="1255961" wikidata="Q1772402" url="?curid=1255961" title="Zero waste">
<text>Zero waste, or &quot;waste minimization&quot;, is a set of principles focused on waste prevention that encourages redesigning resource life cycles so that all products are repurposed (i.e. &quot;up-cycled&quot;) and/or reused. The goal of the movement is to avoid sending trash to landfills, incinerators, oceans, or any other part of the environment. Currently 9% of global plastic is recycled. In a zero waste system, all materials are reused until the optimum level of consumption is reached.

Zero waste refers to waste prevention as opposed to end-of-pipe waste management. It is a &quot;whole systems&quot; approach that aims for a massive change in the way materials flow through society, resulting in no waste. Zero waste encompasses more than eliminating waste through reducing, reusing, and recycling. It focuses on restructuring distribution and production systems to reduce waste. Zero waste provides guidelines for continually working towards eliminating waste.

According to the &quot;Zero Waste International Alliance&quot; (ZWIA), zero waste is the complete recovery of a product&#x27;s resources &quot;with no discharges to land, water, or air that threaten the environment or human health.&quot;

Advocates expect that government regulation is needed to influence industrial choices over product and packaging design, manufacturing processes, and material selection.

Advocates say eliminating waste decreases pollution and can also reduce costs due to the reduced need for raw materials.

== Cradle-to-Grave ==

The cradle-to-grave is a linear material model that begins with resource extraction, moves to product manufacturing, and ends with a &quot;grave&quot; or landfill where the product is disposed of. Cradle-to-grave is in direct contrast to cradle-to-cradle materials or products, which are recycled into new products at the end of their lives so that ultimately there is no waste.

Cradle-to-cradle focuses on designing industrial systems so that materials flow in closed-loop cycles, which means that waste is minimized and waste products can be recycled and reused. Cradle-to-cradle goes beyond dealing with waste issues after it has been created by addressing problems at the source and redefining problems by focusing on design. The cradle-to-cradle model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations.

The cradle-to-cradle framework has evolved steadily from theory to practice. In the industrial sector, it is creating a new notion of materials and material flows. Just as in the natural world, in which one organism&#x27;s &quot;waste&quot; cycles through an ecosystem to provide nourishment for other living things, cradle-to-cradle materials circulate in closed-loop cycles, providing nutrients for nature or industry.

The spread of industrialization worldwide has been accompanied by a large increase in waste production. In 2012 the World Bank stated that 1.3 billion tons of municipal waste was produced by urban populations and estimates that the number will reach 2.2 billion tons by 2025 (Global Solid Waste Management Market - Analysis and Forecast). The increase in solid waste production increases the need for landfills. With the increase in urbanization, these landfills are being placed closer to communities. These landfills are disproportionately located in areas of low socioeconomic status with primarily non-white populations. Findings indicated these areas are often targeted as waste sites because permits are more easily acquired and there was generally less community resistance. Additionally, within the last five years, more than 400 hazardous waste facilities have received formal enforcement actions for unspecified violations that were considered to be a risk to human health.

There is a growing global population that is faced with limited resources from the environment.[7] To relieve the pressures placed on the finite resources available it has become more important to prevent waste. To achieve zero waste, waste management has to move from a linear system to be more cyclical so that materials, products, and substances are used as efficiently as possible. Materials must be chosen so that they may either return safely to a cycle within the environment or remain viable in the industrial cycle.[8]

Zero waste promotes not only reuse and recycling but, more importantly, it promotes prevention and product designs that consider the entire product life cycle.[8] Zero-waste designs strive for reduced material use, use of recycled materials, use of more benign materials, longer product lives, repair ability, and ease of disassembly at end of life.[3] Zero waste strongly supports sustainability by protecting the environment, reducing costs and producing additional jobs in the management and handling of wastes back into the industrial cycle.[8] A Zero waste strategy may be applied to businesses, communities, industrial sectors, schools, and homes.

Benefits proposed by advocates include:
* Saving money. Since waste is a sign of inefficiency, the reduction of waste can reduce costs.
* Faster Progress. A zero-waste strategy improves upon production processes and improves environmental prevention strategies which can lead to taking larger, more innovative steps.
* Supports sustainability. A zero-waste strategy supports all three of the generally accepted goals of sustainability - economic well-being, environmental protection, and social well-being.[8]
* Improved material flows. A zero-waste strategy would use far fewer new raw materials and send no waste materials to landfills. Any material waste would either return as reusable or recycled materials or would be suitable for use as compost.[8]

== Health ==

A major issue with landfills is hydrogen sulfide, which is released from the natural decay of waste. Studies have shown a positive association between increased lung cancer mortality rates and increased morbidity and mortality related to respiratory disease and hydrogen sulfide exposure. These studies also showed that the hydrogen sulfide exposure increased with proximity to the landfill.

Household chemicals and prescription drugs are increasingly being found in large quantities in the leachate from landfills. This is causing concern about the ability of landfills to contain these materials and the possibility of these chemicals and drugs making their way into the groundwater and the surrounding environment.

Zero waste promotes a circular material flow that allows materials to be used over and over, reducing the need for landfill space. Through zero waste the number of toxins released into the air and water would be decreased and products examined to determine what chemicals are used in the production process.

Health issues related to landfills:
* Birth defects, low birth weight, and exposure to particulates and nitrogen dioxide are associated with close proximity to landfills.
* Respiratory diseases and lung cancers are related to the release of hydrogen sulfide from landfills.
Zero waste promotion of a cyclical product life can help reduce the need to create and fill landfills. This can help reduce incidents of respiratory diseases and birth defects that are associated with the toxins released from landfills. Zero waste can also help preserve local environments and potable water sources by preventing pollutants from entering the ecosystem.

== History ==

The California Integrated Waste Management Board established a zero waste goal in 2001. The City and County of San Francisco&#x27;s Department of the Environment established a goal of zero waste in 2002, which led to the City&#x27;s Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance in 2009.

A group that would become the Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA) held its first meeting in 2002, chaired by British economist and environmentalist Robin Murray.

In 2008, Zero Waste was a term used to describe manufacturing and municipal waste management practices. Bea Johnson, a French American woman living in California, decided to apply it to her 4-person household. In 2009, she started the blog &quot;Zero Waste Home&quot;, and in 2010, was featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The International Day of Zero Waste was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 14, 2022. The event has been held annually on March 30 since 2023. &quot;During International Day of Zero Waste, Member States, organizations of the United Nations system, civil society, the private sector, academia, youth and other stakeholders are invited to engage in activities aimed at raising awareness of national, subnational, regional and local zero-waste initiatives and their contribution to achieving sustainable development. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) jointly facilitate the observance of International Day of Zero Waste.&quot;

Milk can be shipped in many forms. One of the traditional forms was reusable returnable glass milk bottles, often home delivered by a milkman. While some of this continues, other options have recently been more common: one-way gable-top paperboard cartons, one-way aseptic cartons, one-way recyclable glass bottles, one-way milk bags, and others. Each system claims some advantages and also has possible disadvantages. From the zero-waste standpoint, the reuse of bottles is beneficial because the material usage per trip can be less than other systems. The primary input (or resource) is silica-sand, which is formed into glass and then into a bottle. The bottle is filled with milk and distributed to the consumer. A reverse logistics system returns the bottles for cleaning, inspection, sanitization, and reuse. Eventually, the heavy-duty bottle would not be suited for further use and would be recycled. Waste and landfill usage would be minimized. The material waste is primarily the wash water, detergent, transportation, heat, bottle caps, etc. While true zero waste is never achieved, a life cycle assessment can be used to calculate the waste at each phase of each cycle.

Online shopping orders are often placed in an outer box to contain multiple items for easier transport and tracking. This creates waste for every order, especially when there is only a single item. In response, some products are now designed not to require an outer box for safe shipping, a feature known as ships in own container.

== Recycling ==
It is important to distinguish recycling from Zero Waste. The most common practice of recycling is simply that of placing bottles, cans, paper, and packaging into curbside recycling bins. The modern version of recycling is more complicated and involves many more elements of financing and government support. For example, a 2007 report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency states that the US recycles at a national rate of 33.5% and includes in this figure composted materials. In addition, many multinational commodity companies have been created to handle recycled materials. At the same time, claims of recycling rates have sometimes been exaggerated, for example by the inclusion of soil and organic matter used to cover garbage dumps daily, in the &quot;recycled&quot; column. In US states with recycling incentives, there is constant local pressure to inflate recycling statistics.

Recycling has been separated from the concept of zero waste. One example of this is the computer industry where worldwide millions of PC&#x27;s are disposed of as electronic waste each year in 2016 44.7 million metric tons of electronic waste was generated of which only 20% was documented and recycled. Some computer manufacturers refurbish leased computers for resale. Community Organizations have also entered this space by refurbishing old computers from donation campaigns for distribution to undeserved communities.

=== Software recycling ===
A clear example of the difference between zero waste and recycling is discussed in &quot;Getting to Zero Waste&quot;, in the software industry. Zero waste design can be applied to intellectual property where the effort to code functionality into software objects is developed by design as opposed to copying code snippets multiple times when needed. The application of zero waste is straightforward as it conserves human effort. Also, software storage mediums have transitioned from consumable diskettes to internal drives which are vastly superior and have a minimal cost per megabyte of storage. This is a physical example where zero waste correctly identifies and avoids wasteful behavior.

=== Use of zero waste system ===

Zero waste is poorly supported by the enactment of government laws to enforce the waste hierarchy.

A special feature of zero waste as a design principle is that it can be applied to any product or process, in any situation or at any level. Thus it applies equally to toxic chemicals as to benign plant matter. It applies to the waste of atmospheric purity by coal-burning or the waste of radioactive resources by attempting to designate the excesses of nuclear power plants as &quot;nuclear waste&quot;. All processes can be designed to minimize the need for discard, both in their own operations and in the usage or consumption patterns which the design of their products leads to. Recycling, on the other hand, deals only with simple materials.

Zero waste can even be applied to the waste of human potential by enforced poverty and the denial of educational opportunity. It encompasses redesign for reduced energy wasting in industry or transportation and the wasting of the earth&#x27;s rainforests. It is a general principle of designing for the efficient use of all resources, however defined.

The recycling movement may be slowly branching out from its solid waste management base to include issues that are similar to the community sustainability movement.

Zero waste, on the other hand, is not based in waste management limitations to begin with but requires that we maximize our existing reuse efforts while creating and applying new methods that minimize and eliminate destructive methods like incineration and recycling. Zero waste strives to ensure that products are designed to be repaired, refurbished, re-manufactured and generally reused.

== Significance of dump capacity ==

Many dumps are currently exceeding carrying capacity. This is often used as a justification for moving to Zero Waste. Others counter by pointing out that there are huge tracts of land available throughout the US and other countries which could be used for dumps. Proposals abound to destroy all garbage as a way to solve the garbage problem. These proposals typically claim to convert all or a large portion of existing garbage into oil and sometimes claim to produce so much oil that the world will henceforth have abundant liquid fuels. One such plan, called Anything Into Oil, was promoted by Discover Magazine and Fortune Magazine in 2004 and claimed to be able to convert a refrigerator into &quot;light Texas crude&quot; by the application of high-pressure steam.

=== Corporate initiatives ===

An example of a company that has demonstrated a change in landfill waste policy is General Motors (GM). GM has confirmed their plans to make approximately half of its 181 plants worldwide &quot;landfill-free&quot; by the end of 2010. Companies like Subaru, Toyota, and Xerox are also producing landfill-free plants. Furthermore, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has worked with GM and other companies for decades to minimize waste through its WasteWise program. The goal for General Motors is to find ways to recycle or reuse more than 90% of materials by selling scrap materials, adopting reusable boxes to replace cardboard, and recycling used work gloves. The remainder of the scraps might be incinerated to create energy for the plants. Besides being nature-friendly, it also saves money by cutting out waste and producing more efficient production. Microsoft and Google are two other big companies that have Zero Waste goals. These two companies have goals to keep the majority of their waste out of landfills. Google has six locations that have a Zero Waste to Landfill goal. These locations have a goal to keep 100% of their waste out of landfills. Microsoft has a similar goal, but they are only trying to keep 90% of their waste out of landfills. All these organizations push forth to make our world clean and produce zero waste.

A garden centre in Faversham, UK, has started to prevent plastic plant pots from being passed down to customers. Instead, it reuses the plastic pots only locally in the garden center, but upon selling it to its customers it repots the plants in paper plant pots. It also sells plants wrapped in hessia and uses a variety of techniques to prevent handing down (single-use) plastics to customers

=== Re-use or rot of waste ===

The waste sent to landfills may be harvested as useful materials, such as in the production of solar energy or natural fertilizer/de-composted manure for crops.

It may also be reused and recycled for something that we can actually use. &quot;The success of General Motors in creating zero-landfill facilities shows that zero-waste goals can be a powerful impetus for manufacturers to reduce their waste and carbon footprint,&quot; says Latisha Petteway, a spokesperson for the EPA.

==Market-based campaigns==

Market-based, legislation-mediated campaigns like extended producer responsibility (EPR) and the precautionary principle are among numerous campaigns that have a Zero Waste slogan hung on them by means of claims they all ineluctably lead to policies of Zero Waste. At the moment, there is no evidence that EPR will increase reuse, rather than merely moving discard and disposal into private-sector dumping contracts. The Precautionary Principle is put forward to shift liability for proving new chemicals are safe from the public (acting as guinea pig) to the company introducing them. As such, its relation to Zero Waste is dubious. Likewise, many organizations, cities and counties have embraced a Zero Waste slogan while pressing for none of the key Zero Waste changes. In fact, it is common for many such to simply state that recycling is their entire goal. Many commercial or industrial companies claim to embrace Zero Waste but usually mean no more than a major materials recycling effort, having no bearing on product redesign. Examples include Staples, Home Depot, Toyota, General Motors and computer take-back campaigns. Earlier social justice campaigns have successfully pressured McDonald&#x27;s to change their meat purchasing practices and Nike to change its labor practices in Southeast Asia. Those were both based on the idea that organized consumers can be active participants in the economy and not just passive subjects. However, the announced and enforced goal of the public campaign is critical. A goal to reduce waste generation or dumping through greater recycling will not achieve a goal of product redesign and so cannot reasonably be called a Zero Waste campaign. Producers should be made responsible for the packaging of the products rather than the consumers in EPR like campaigns by which the participation of the Producers will increase.

==How to achieve==

National and provincial governments often set targets and may provide some funding, but on a practical level, waste management programs (e.g. pickup, drop-off, or containers for recycling and composting) are usually implemented by local governments, possibly with regionally shared facilities.

Reaching the goal of zero waste requires the products of manufacturers and industrial designers to be easily disassembled for recycling and incorporated back into nature or the industrial system; durability and repairability also reduce unnecessary churn in the product life cycle. Minimizes packaging also solves many problems early in the supply chain. If not mandated by government, choices by retailers and consumers in favor of zero-waste-friendly products can influence production. More and more schools are motivating their students to live a different life and rethink every polluting step they may take. To prevent material from becoming waste, consumers, businesses, and non-profits must be educated in how to reduce waste and recycle successfully.

===The 5 R&#x27;s of Bea Johnson===

In the book &quot;Zero Waste Home: The Ultimate Guide to Simplifying your Life by Reducing your Waste&quot; the author, Bea Johnson, provides a modified version of the 3 Rs, the : Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rot to achieve Zero Waste at home. The method, which she developed through years of practicing waste free living and used to reduce her family&#x27;s annual trash to fit in a pint jar, is now widely used by individuals, businesses and municipalities worldwide.

===Zero Waste Hierarchy===
The Zero Waste Hierarchy describes a progression of policies and strategies to support the zero-waste system, from highest and best to lowest use of materials. It is designed to be applicable to all audiences, from policymakers to industry and the individual. It aims to provide more depth to the internationally recognized 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle); to encourage policy, activity and investment at the top of the hierarchy; and to provide a guide for those who wish to develop systems or products that move us closer to zero waste. It enhances the zero-waste definition by providing guidance for planning and a way to evaluate proposed solutions. All over the world, in some form or another, a pollution prevention hierarchy is incorporated into recycling regulations, solid waste management plans, and resource conservation programs. In Canada, a pollution prevention hierarchy otherwise referred to as the Environmental Protection Hierarchy was adopted. This Hierarchy has been incorporated into all recycling regulations within Canada and is embedded within all resource conservation methods which all government mandated waste prevention programs follow. While the intention to incorporate the 4th R (recovery)prior to disposal was good, many organizations focused on this 4th R instead of the top of the hierarchy resulting in costly systems designed to destroy materials instead of systems designed to reduce environmental impact and waste. Because of this, along with other resource destruction systems that have been emerging over the past few decades, Zero Waste Canada along with the Zero Waste International Alliance have adopted the only internationally peer-reviewed Zero Waste Hierarchy that focuses on the first 3Rs; Reduce, Reuse and Recycle including Compost.

==Zero waste jurisdictions==

Various governments have declared zero waste as a goal, including:

* Brazil
** Florianópolis, Santa Catarina
* Canada
** Vancouver (see Zero Waste 2040 Strategy)
* Italy
** Capannori, Tuscany

* Japan
** Kamikatsu, Tokushima recycles 80% of its waste at the Kamikatsu Zero Waste Center, and aims for zero waste.
*Sweden (Country wide)
*United States
** Austin, Texas
** Boulder, Colorado
** Fort Collins, Colorado
** Chula Vista, California
** Minneapolis, Minnesota
** San Francisco, California
** San Jose, California
** Oakland, California

An example of network governance approach can be seen in the UK under New Labour who proposed the establishment of regional groupings that brought together the key stakeholders in waste management (local authority representatives, waste industry, government offices etc.) on a voluntary basis. There is a lack of clear government policy on how to meet the targets for diversion from landfill which increases the scope at the regional and local level for governance networks. The overall goal is set by government but the route for how to achieve it is left open, so stakeholders can coordinate and decide how best to reach it.

Zero Waste is a strategy promoted by environmental NGOs but the waste industry is more in favor of the capital intensive option of energy from waste incineration. Research often highlights public support as the first requirement for success. In Taiwan, public opinion was essential in changing the attitude of business, who must transform their material use pattern to become more sustainable for Zero Waste to work.

California is a leading state in the United States for having zero-waste goals. California is the state with the most cities in the Zero Waste International Alliance. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, multiple cities have defined what it means to be a Zero Waste community and adopted goals to reach that status. Some of these cities include Fresno, Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco, Pasadena, Alameda, and San Jose. San Francisco has defined zero waste as &quot;zero discards to the landfill or high-temperature destruction.&quot; Here, there is a planned structure to reach Zero Waste through three steps recommended by the San Francisco Department of the Environment. These steps are to prevent waste, reduce and reuse, and recycle and compost. Los Angeles defines zero waste as &quot;maximizing diversion from landfills and reducing waste at the source, with the ultimate goal of striving for more-sustainable solid waste management practices.&quot; Los Angeles plans to reach this goal by the year of 2025. To reach this goal, major changes will have to be made to product creation, use, and disposal.

==Zero-waste stores==
Retail stores specializing in zero-waste products and supply practices have opened in various countries, including Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. there are over 200 stores in the UK which sell products either unpackaged or with minimal packaging, and where shoppers can bring their own container to take away their purchases.

<text>Rugby Radio Station was a large British government radio transmission facility just east of the Hillmorton area of the town of Rugby, Warwickshire in England. The site straddled the A5 trunk road, with most of it in Warwickshire, and part on the other side of the A5 in Northamptonshire. First opened in 1926, at its height in the 1950s it was the largest radio transmitting station in the world, with a total of 57 radio transmitters, covering an area of . Traffic slowly dwindled from the 1980s onwards, and the site was closed between 2003 and 2007.

The tallest masts on the site were tall, and could be seen from up to away, making the site for many years a major local landmark. Since closure, part of the site has been used for a large housing development called Houlton, named after Houlton, Maine, USA the American town which received the first transatlantic phone call from the station in 1927.

==History==
Following the end of the First World War the British government set about implementing plans for an Imperial Wireless Chain to link the countries of the British Empire. It was decided that the new wireless service would be state-run by the Post Office. The site east of Hillmorton, was chosen in 1923. Part of the site had previously been occupied by RAF Lilbourne between 1915 and 1920.

Its large very low frequency (VLF) transmitter came into service on 1 January 1926 and was originally used to transmit telegraph messages to the Commonwealth as part of the Imperial Wireless Chain. After the 1950s this transmitter, active as callsign GBR on 16.0 kHz, using Morse code and later on 15.975 kHz with frequency-shift keying FSK and minimum-shift keying MSK, was used by the British Navy for transmitting messages to submerged submarines. Criggion radio station acted as a reserve. The GBR transmitter was shut down on 1 April 2003 and was replaced by a new one at the Skelton transmitting station.

In 1927, a second transmitter was installed to initiate the first transatlantic commercial telephone service; linking New York and London on 60 kHz using single-sideband modulation. This transmitter was decommissioned in 1956 and became the time signal transmitter MSF. This new function developed from the decision, in 1951, to use the station to transmit modulated standard frequencies for scientific reference purposes. In 1972 these transmissions were consolidated onto the present frequency of 60 kHz and a further reference, that of a time signal, was added. In 1977 this took the form of the rolling &quot;slow code&quot; in use until April 2007, when BT&#x27;s contract to transmit the time signal also passed to VT Communications, using their Anthorn radio station in Cumbria.
The aerial system at the VLF transmitter existed between 1926 and 2004 and consisted of twelve 250 metre (820 ft) high, guyed steel-framework masts insulated against ground and carrying an aerial wire. This wire was mainly destroyed by heavy iceloads in the winter of 1940. After the shutdown of GBR, the facility was only used for transmitting the MSF time signal. Therefore, eight of the twelve masts were obsolete and demolished on the night of 19 June 2004 to 20 June 2004.

A trial transmission of the LORAN-C navigation system was run at the station from June 2005 until March 2007. The remaining four &#x27;tall&#x27; masts were demolished on 2 August 2007. The site is now being developed into a large new housing estate named Houlton, the first homes of which were occupied in December 2017. The power and transmission buildings, as well as a water tower have been reused as part of Houlton School.

<doc id="1255967" wikidata="Q2174802" url="?curid=1255967" title="Rufus Payne">
<text>Rufus &quot;Tee Tot&quot; Payne (February 4, 1883 – March 17, 1939) was an early-20th-century African-American blues musician from Greenville, Alabama, who was more widely known by his nickname Tee Tot.

Payne&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Tee Tot&quot; is an ironic pun for &quot;teetotaler&quot;. It is said that Payne received his nickname because he usually carried a homemade mixture of alcohol and tea wherever he went.

==Early life==
According to Alabama historian Alice Harp, Payne was born in 1883 on the Payne Plantation in Sandy Ridge, Lowndes County, Alabama.

==Career and influence==

Some say Tee Tot played the blues alone; others state that he led a little combo that played pop songs and hokum numbers and was a street musician.

Tee Tot is best known for being a mentor to Hank Williams. Rufus Payne met Hank Williams when Hank was eight years old, and legend has it that he would come around and play Hank&#x27;s guitar, showing Hank how to improvise chords. His influence in exposing Williams to blues and other African American influences helped Williams successfully fuse hillbilly, folk and blues into his own unique style, which in turn expanded and exposed both white and black audiences to the differing sounds.

==Death==
Payne died at a charity hospital in Montgomery, Alabama, on March 17, 1939, at the age of 56. He is buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Montgomery; as the exact location of his gravesite is unknown, a memorial to him stands near the entrance to the cemetery, paid for by Hank Williams Jr. and other members of the Grand Ole Opry.

==Tributes==
Hank Williams, Jr. paid tribute to Tee Tot&#x27;s influence on his father through &quot;The Tee Tot Song&quot; on his &quot;Almeria Club&quot; album.

He was portrayed by actor Rex Ingram in the 1964 Hank Williams biopic &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;.

<doc id="1255970" wikidata="Q405071" url="?curid=1255970" title="Mitsubishi Astron engine">
<text>The Mitsubishi Astron or 4G5/4D5 engine, is a series of straight-four internal combustion engines first built by Mitsubishi Motors in 1972. Engine displacement ranged from 1.8 to 2.6 litres, making it one of the largest four-cylinder engines of its time.

==Design==
It employed a hemispherical cylinder head, chain-driven single overhead camshaft (SOHC) and eight valves (two per cylinder). United States passenger car versions had a small secondary intake valve referred to as the &quot;Jet Valve&quot;. This valve induced swirl in the intake charge, enabling the use of leaner fuel/air mixtures for lower emissions. It was designed as a cartridge containing the valve spring and seat which simply screwed into a threaded hole in the head, similar to a spark plug but inside the cam cover. The rocker arms for the intake valve were widened on the valve end to accommodate the cartridge, which was equipped with a very soft valve spring in order to avoid wear on the camshaft intake lobe. Modifications to the head were thereby reduced as the Jet Valve negated the necessity for a three-valve-per-cylinder design.

In 1975, the &quot;Astron 80&quot; introduced a system dubbed &quot;Silent Shaft&quot;: the first use of twin balance shafts in a modern engine. It followed the designs of Frederick Lanchester, whose original patents Mitsubishi had obtained, and proved influential as Fiat/Lancia, Saab and Porsche all licensed this technology.

The 4D5 engine is a range of four-cylinder belt-driven overhead camshaft diesel engines which were part of the &quot;Astron&quot; family, and introduced in 1980 in the then new fifth generation Galant. As the first turbodiesel to be offered in a Japanese passenger car, it proved popular in the emerging SUV and minivan markets where Mitsubishi was highly successful, until superseded by the 4M4 range in 1993. However, production of the 4D5 (4D56) continued throughout the 1990s as a lower-cost option than the more modern powerplants. Until now it is still in production, but made into a modern powerplant by putting a common rail direct injection fuel system into the engine.

== 4G54 (2.6 liters)==
The SOHC eight-valve 4G54 (also known as the G54B) displaces , with bore &amp; stroke at . The G54B for the US market had a cylinder head with additional jet valves to improve emissions (MCA-Jet system). The engine was fitted to various Mitsubishi models from 1978 to 1997 and to the American Chrysler K-cars and their derivatives between 1981 and 1987. It was primarily set up longitudinally for use in rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive platforms but also as a transverse engine in the front-wheel drive platform of the Mitsubishi Magna and Chrysler K platform. Chrysler commonly marketed the engine &quot;Hemi,&quot; whereas the Australian-made version was marketed as the &quot;Astron II&quot; and featured &quot;Balance Shaft&quot; technology, which was subsequently licensed to Porsche and other automakers. The original engine featured a Mikuni two-barrel carburetor with a secondary vacuum actuator; later versions adopted EFI. Chrysler commonly paired this engine with its A470 3-speed automatic transmission; in Australia, Mitsubishi adapted it to a 5-speed manual transmission and its &quot;ELC&quot; (Electronic Control) 4-speed automatic transmission, featuring electronic overdrive. Chrysler eventually replaced the 4G54 with its own 2.5 L engine, whereas Mitsubishi replaced it with a 2.4 L engine codenamed 4G64.

<doc id="1255983" wikidata="Q2756011" url="?curid=1255983" title="Byron Leftwich">
<text>Byron Antron Leftwich (born January 14, 1980) is an American former professional football quarterback and coach who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 10 seasons. He played college football for the Marshall Thundering Herd, twice receiving MAC Most Valuable Player honors, and was selected seventh overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2003 NFL draft. Leftwich held a starting role with the Jaguars during his first four seasons and spent the remainder of his career as a backup for the Atlanta Falcons, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. With the Steelers, he was a member of the team that won Super Bowl XLIII.

Following his retirement, Leftwich began a coaching career under Bruce Arians with the Arizona Cardinals. He rejoined Arians as the offensive coordinator of the Buccaneers, a position he held from 2019 to 2022, and helped the team win Super Bowl LV.

==Early life==
Leftwich attended Howard D. Woodson High School in Washington, DC, and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. He garnered an honorable mention on &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s All-Met football team in 1997 as a senior. He was also first-team All-DCIAA East in basketball his senior year.

==Playing career==
===College===
Leftwich starred at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia. He was the MVP of the 2000 Motor City Bowl. Leftwich gained recognition after quarterbacking a 64–61 overtime victory over East Carolina in the 2001 GMAC Bowl, in which he competed against future teammate David Garrard. He is also remembered for being carried by linemen Steve Sciullo and Steve Perretta after breaking his shin, specifically the left tibia, and returning to the game, taking Marshall down the field on multiple series as he rallied his team to a 17-point comeback against Akron in November 2002, although Marshall still lost 34–20.

Because ESPN began broadcasting Mid-American Conference (MAC) games on Tuesdays and Wednesdays—days without other football on television—in 2000, nationwide &quot;MACtion&quot; audiences watched Leftwich&#x27;s teams. Leftwich, along with fellow Marshall alumni Chad Pennington, Randy Moss, and Doug Chapman, is credited for helping the MAC gain more national attention; Marshall is now a member of the Sun Belt Conference. In his career at Marshall, Leftwich completed 939 of 1,442 passes (65.1 percent) for 11,903 yards, 89 touchdowns and 28 interceptions. He amassed 12,090 yards of total offense on 1,632 plays, ranking second on the school&#x27;s all-time list behind Pennington.

===Professional===
====Jacksonville Jaguars====
Publicity from MACtion games helped make the obscure Leftwich a top ten draft selection. At the 2003 NFL draft, the Minnesota Vikings and Baltimore Ravens agreed to a trade to move the Ravens into position to take him with Minnesota&#x27;s seventh overall selection. However, one of the teams had second thoughts at the last minute and the Vikings missed the allotted time for their pick. As a result, the Vikings had defaulted on their selection and consequently moved back to the ninth pick. The Jaguars, who were originally slotted to be drafting eighth overall, were taken up to the seventh pick, and they used it to take Leftwich.
Leftwich took over as the Jaguars starting quarterback in game four of his rookie year after Mark Brunell was injured in the previous week&#x27;s matchup against the Indianapolis Colts.

For the first 10 games of the 2005 regular season, Leftwich was developing into the quarterback the Jaguars believed he would become when they picked him in the first round. He attained a passer rating of 89.3, ninth-best in the NFL, and a 3:1 touchdown:interception ratio (15:5).

However, in the Week 12 game against the Arizona Cardinals, Leftwich suffered a broken ankle after being sacked by Cardinals&#x27; safety Adrian Wilson on the first play of the game. Leftwich missed the remaining five games of the regular season. He returned against the New England Patriots in the AFC Wild Card round of the playoffs. The Patriots won 28–3.

Leftwich entered his fourth NFL season as the Jaguars&#x27; starting quarterback, but without veteran wide receiver Jimmy Smith, who suddenly retired in May 2006. Leftwich led the Jaguars to victories on national television in consecutive weeks against the favored Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers to begin the 2006 season. Leftwich suffered an ankle injury in a Week 4 loss to the Washington Redskins. Following a Week 6 loss to the Houston Texans, Leftwich had surgery to repair the ankle, which effectively ended his season.

David Garrard replaced Leftwich for the remainder of the season. In his first seven games as Leftwich&#x27;s replacement, Garrard led the Jaguars to five wins and two losses and an 8–5 record through 13 games. Garrard&#x27;s and the team&#x27;s success in Leftwich&#x27;s absence led to speculation that the Jaguars might seek to replace Leftwich permanently with Garrard. However, the Jaguars lost the three final games of the season, preventing the team from making the playoffs, and Garrard struggled in each game. Garrard&#x27;s ineffectiveness prompted Jaguars head coach Jack Del Rio to replace him with backup Quinn Gray.

In February 2007, Del Rio publicly reaffirmed his commitment to Leftwich, formally naming him as the team&#x27;s starter over Garrard and Gray.

After observing Leftwich&#x27;s and Garrard&#x27;s performances throughout the 2007 preseason, in the week preceding the first regular season game of 2007, Del Rio named Garrard the team&#x27;s starter and declared that Leftwich would be either cut or traded. The Jaguars cut Leftwich on September 1, 2007.

====Atlanta Falcons====
On September 17, 2007, Leftwich was flown out to Atlanta to meet with Atlanta Falcons officials, citing a possible signing with the team. On September 18, Leftwich signed a two-year deal with the Falcons with incentives attached that could make the deal worth up to $7 million.

Leftwich entered the season as a backup to starter Joey Harrington. After replacing Harrington late in Week 5, Leftwich got the start in Week 7 and played very well, before having to leave the game with an ankle sprain. He got the start again in Week 11 after returning from his injury. Harrington regained his starting position and Leftwich did not play again. On February 15, 2008, he was released by the Falcons. He worked out for the Tennessee Titans in July.

====Pittsburgh Steelers (first stint)====
On August 10, 2008, Leftwich was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers to a one-year deal after Pittsburgh&#x27;s backup Charlie Batch was injured in a preseason game. The contract was worth $645,000 and included a $40,000 signing bonus. Leftwich started the 2008 season as the backup to quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. &quot;I&#x27;m the guy sitting in the bullpen,&quot; he stated prior to the first game of the 2008 season. &quot;If something were to happen, I have to go out there.&quot; Leftwich performed well throughout the season when called upon, appearing in five games. During the 2008 season, he completed 21 of 36 attempts for 303 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions for a 104.3 passer rating, in addition to rushing for one touchdown. Leftwich earned a Super Bowl ring as the Steelers&#x27; backup when the Steelers defeated the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII.

====Tampa Bay Buccaneers====
Leftwich agreed to terms on a two-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on April 12, 2009.

On August 29, Buccaneers head coach Raheem Morris named Leftwich the team&#x27;s starter for the 2009 regular season.

On September 28, Buccaneers benched Leftwich after a disappointing loss to the New York Giants and an 0–3 start to the season. Josh Johnson was named the Tampa Bay Buccaneers&#x27; new starting QB, while Leftwich moved down to third string behind Josh Freeman. After spending several games inactive due to an elbow injury, on November 24 Leftwich was placed on injured reserve, ending his 2009 season.

====Pittsburgh Steelers (second stint)====
Leftwich was traded to the Steelers in exchange for a 2010 seventh-round draft pick on April 20, 2010. He was expected to be the starter while Ben Roethlisberger served his four-game suspension, but suffered a knee injury during the preseason finale against the Carolina Panthers. Leftwich was cut from the Steelers on September 18, 2010, in a temporary move to make room for defensive lineman Steve McLendon, who was signed due to an injury to Casey Hampton. However, on September 19, Steelers quarterback Dennis Dixon was injured in a win over the Tennessee Titans and Leftwich was re-signed on the morning of September 20. Leftwich made one appearance during the regular season finale, in relief of Roethlisberger, once the game was out of reach for the opposing Cleveland. The final score was 41–9 and he completed 5 passes out of 7 attempts for a total of 42 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Leftwich was the Steelers backup quarterback for their playoff run and Super Bowl XLV loss to the Green Bay Packers.

During week 3 of the 2011 preseason against Atlanta, Leftwich broke his left arm after landing awkwardly while running with the ball. On September 2, he was placed on the Injured Reserve list, causing him to miss the entire season. He later re-signed with the team in April 2012.

During Week 10 of the 2012 season, Ben Roethlisberger was knocked out of the game against the Kansas City Chiefs at Heinz Field, injuring his SC joint and rib on the only sack of the game. Leftwich came into the game and completed seven of 14 passes for 73 yards, helping lead the team to a go-ahead fourth quarter field goal in a game that would eventually be tied before the Steelers finally won in overtime. Two days after the win against the Chiefs, the Steelers announced that Leftwich would be the starter in Week 11 against the Baltimore Ravens at home. He had a career-long rush of 31 yards for a touchdown in the opening drive in the loss against the Ravens. However, in the process, he broke his rib and he was sidelined after the game, which would be the last one of his career.

==Coaching career==
===Arizona Cardinals===
On May 9, 2016, Leftwich was hired by the Arizona Cardinals as a coaching intern during training camp. He was given the duty to help train the Cardinals quarterbacks. On January 27, 2017, Leftwich was hired by the Cardinals as their quarterbacks coach under head coach Bruce Arians, who had been his offensive coordinator on the Pittsburgh Steelers. Shortly after Bruce Arians retired as head coach of the Arizona Cardinals and Steve Wilks took his place. On October 19, 2018, after the Cardinals fired offensive coordinator Mike McCoy, Leftwich was promoted to take over his role as interim offensive coordinator. On December 31, 2018, Leftwich was fired by the Cardinals, along with head coach Steve Wilks and the team finished 3–13, their worst record since 2000.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
On January 8, 2019, Leftwich was hired by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as their offensive coordinator, reuniting with new head coach Bruce Arians. Arians, who was returning from retirement, said in an interview with ESPN that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t have taken the job if it wasn&#x27;t for general manager Jason Licht, and probably wouldn&#x27;t have taken the job if Byron Leftwich wasn&#x27;t available&quot;.

After the 2020 regular season, Arians stated that he had delegated the offense to Leftwich, and expressed frustration that the coordinator was not interviewed by other NFL teams for a head coaching position. At the end of that season, their second with Arians and Leftwich, the Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV. After the 2021 season, Leftwich received multiple head coaching interviews but was not hired by any organization.

On January 19, 2023, Leftwich was fired from the Buccaneers organization.

<doc id="1255986" wikidata="Q5645225" url="?curid=1255986" title="Hamilton University">
<text>Hamilton University was an unaccredited institution based in Evanston, Wyoming. According to the Oregon Office of Degree Authorization, it was first established in Hawaii as American State University. It has since been closed by court order in Wyoming and has relocated to the Bahamas under the name Richardson University.

==History==
Since it had no real students and no faculty and was housed in buildings which had once been a Motel 6, Hamilton was widely thought to be a diploma mill. The school issued degrees based on &quot;life experiences.&quot; Candidates for a degree were required to answer a few questions and write a small project of 2,000 words (about seven typed pages). The school issued Bachelor&#x27;s, Master&#x27;s, and even PhDs. The presence of a small church built in the parking lot had served to make the activity tax free due to federal and state laws, even though the church building had no pews; people in Evanston had never seen services there.

CBS News reported in 2004 that Hamilton was operated by Rudy Marn of Key West, Florida. Marn, an art collector and philanthropist, has a history of running diploma mills. In 2008, Marn pleaded guilty to tax fraud and was sentenced in October 2008 by Casper federal court to two years in prison and ordered to pay $620,000 in restitution to the IRS. Marn, Bureau of Prisons # 10728-091, served time in Federal Correctional Institution, Beaumont Low in the Federal Correctional Complex, Beaumont, and was released in September 2010.

The website used the .edu domain, because unaccredited institutions were allowed to use such domains before October 29, 2001.

==Academics and accreditation==
Hamilton claimed to be accredited by the American Council of Private Colleges and Universities (ACPCU). The ACPCU, which was &quot;set up by Hamilton, for Hamilton&quot; has no authorization from the United States Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. Former FBI consultant John Bear called it a &quot;fake accrediting agency set up by the Wyoming-based diploma mill, Hamilton University.&quot;

==Criticism and controversy==
An investigation by the TV news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; revealed that some people in positions of power actually held phony degrees issued by Hamilton University, such as Cessna CEO Jack J. Pelton. A statement by the company did not deny the allegations, asserting that Mr. Pelton was chosen for his field experience more than for his academic achievement.

The most notable &quot;graduate&quot; of Hamilton University was former U.S. government official Laura Callahan, a key figure in the &quot;Project X&quot; email scandal involving the disappearance of thousands of White House emails which had been subpoenaed by Congress. Callahan&#x27;s diplomas from HU had enabled her to get a high position in the United States Department of Homeland Security. A probe of her claims evolved into an investigation by the Government Accountability Office of Federal employees who had paid diploma mills with taxpayer funds.

When the CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot; video crew visited the campus, there was no evidence of any students or faculty, but three office workers present.

==People with Hamilton degrees==
*Laura Callahan, former senior director at the United States Department of Homeland Security
*Ben Hanlon, the father and leader of the Wild Hanlons from the NBC television show &quot;Treasure Hunters&quot;, claims a Masters and PhD from Hamilton University
*Jack J. Pelton, former CEO of Cessna Aircraft Co and current Chairman of the Experimental Aircraft Association

<text>The Skelton Transmitting Station is a radio transmitter site at near Skelton, Cumbria, England, about north-west of Penrith, run by Babcock International and owned by the Ministry of Defence. Shortwave broadcasts from this station ended on 30 March 2023, replaced by Woofferton. Skelton&#x27;s lattice mast is the tallest structure in the UK.

==History==
===Construction===
The site was built by J. L. Eve Construction during the Second World War, for long-distance short-wave transmissions, across Europe.

===Transmissions===
In 1946, the BBC was heralding the site as being &quot;the World&#x27;s largest and most powerful (shortwave) radio station&quot;.

The main purpose of it was shortwave broadcasting. The site was capable of Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) on at least 3955 kHz and 3975 kHz (75m broadcast band) beamed at 121° towards Germany and Central Europe. On AM the frequencies of 5995 kHz and 6195 kHz (49m broadcast band) and 9410 kHz (31m broadcast band) and 12095 kHz (25m broadcast band) were known.

A Royal Navy very low frequency (VLF) transmitter is also located there. It is used to transmit encrypted orders to submarines, including the Trident SLBM fleet. It uses as its aerial a 365-metre (1,198 foot) high guyed steel lattice mast, which is insulated against ground and is the tallest structure in the UK. The transmitter went into service in 2001.

<text>Stagecoach East Scotland is a bus operator providing services in eastern Scotland, with its regional base in Dunfermline, Fife. The company is a subsidiary of the Stagecoach Group.

==History==
Stagecoach began long distance express coach services in 1981 from its base in Perth, expanding into local bus operations when it bought McLennan of Spittalfield in 1985. Deregulation of bus services under the Transport Act 1985 in October 1986 gave Stagecoach the opportunity to expand operations in Perth, thus fierce competition with the dominant operator Strathtay Scottish began, which eventually saw Stagecoach&#x27;s then-Perth Panther subsidiary emerge as the largest provider of bus services in the Perth area. On the breakup and privatisation of the state-owned Scottish Bus Group, Stagecoach was successful in acquiring two of the subsidiaries, namely Northern Scottish in March 1991 and Fife Scottish in July 1991, the latter of which would form the basis of Stagecoach East Scotland&#x27;s operations following a protracted legal battle between Stagecoach and a management buyout team. 

In August 2003, the United Kingdom&#x27;s first entirely commercial demand responsive bus service was launched by Stagecoach East Scotland in Fife. Trading as Yellow Taxibus and using the AA Buses Ltd legal name (transferred from Stagecoach West Scotland where it was purchased with the AA Buses operation in Ayrshire), the operation combined the benefits of a fixed bus route with the flexibility of pre-booked taxi pick-ups. Yellow Taxibus operated a fleet of eight-seater Mercedes-Benz Vito vehicles on a high-frequency service between Dunfermline and Edinburgh seven days a week; however after a two-year trial, the loss-making service was withdrawn in November 2005.

On 14 December 2005 Stagecoach purchased the Barnsley-based Traction Group, the largest remaining private bus company in the United Kingdom, for £26 million. The Traction Group owned Strathtay Scottish, which Stagecoach had pushed out of Perth some 16 years earlier. The Strathtay operations bridged the gap between Stagecoach&#x27;s Fife, Perth and Bluebird operations, giving the group a vast swathe of the country extending from Edinburgh through to Perth, northwards to Aberdeen and round to Inverness, with only Travel Dundee and First Aberdeen being the major non-Stagecoach operators within that area. Unusually, despite the Strathtay fleet receiving the corporate livery, fleet vehicles were branded with &quot;Strathtay&quot; with &quot;Part of the Stagecoach Group&quot; straplines.

In March 2008, it was announced that Stagecoach Fife had purchased Rennies of Dunfermline for an undisclosed sum, following the retirement of Rennies&#x27; owner. The Rennies fleet consisted of 60 vehicles, including 18 double-deckers which were all leased from Stagecoach in Fife. Rennies were formerly based at Dunfermline (Wellwood Mill), before moving to Cowdenbeath in 2016.

In Spring 2014, Stagecoach entered the South Queensferry area, replacing a withdrawn service to Edinburgh which had been run for many years by First Scotland East. However, the South Queensferry operation incurred huge losses and was withdrawn in June 2017, with Lothian Buses subsequently taking it over.

In May 2023, Stagecoach East Scotland began operating autonomous Alexander Dennis Enviro200AV as part of the CAVForth scheme on route &quot;AB1&quot; across the Forth Road Bridge. Following lower-than-expected passenger numbers, however, the AB1 route ceased operations on 14 February 2025, with Stagecoach noting that the demonstration service &quot;has significantly advanced the understanding of the operational and regulatory requirements for autonomous services&quot;. CAVForth plan to continue their research into autonomous public service vehicles.

==Services==

Stagecoach East Scotland operates under six different brands:
*Stagecoach in Perth, a trading name of Stagecoach (Scotland) Ltd, is used for services in and around Perth.
*Stagecoach in Fife is used for services throughout Fife and beyond to Dundee and Edinburgh, and is a trading name of Fife Scottish Omnibuses Ltd. It has operated a number of experimental services including Yellow Taxibus.
*Stagecoach Strathtay is the brand used for services within the city of Dundee and throughout Angus, with some services reaching Perth and into Aberdeenshire. 
*Rennie&#x27;s, now based at former Fife Scottish Cowdenbeath bus depot operates tours and school buses with the company. Rennie&#x27;s also provides fleet support (e.g: additional services during peak times) in the Dunfermline area.
* The company also provides vehicles for Megabus and Scottish Citylink long distance express work within Scotland, and beyond to Manchester and London.

===Express and Experience City Connect===
In October 2007, Stagecoach&#x27;s Fife operations received a £4.5 million investment in upgrading the regional express network, with services branded as &quot;Express City Connect&quot; and &quot;Experience City Connect&quot;. Express services from West Fife to Edinburgh received nine new Scania OmniLink tri-axle single-deckers featuring leather seating and free Wi-Fi, while the rest of the network received 20 Plaxton Profile bodied Volvo B7R coaches, also equipped with leather seating and free Wi-Fi.

In 2011, further new Plaxton Elite coaches were delivered to Stagecoach to help deal with the increase in passengers on the X59 service, with further examples being delivered between 2012 and 2017. This has resulted in the City Connect brand receiving the accolade of Top Express Operation at the UK Coach Awards in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively.

In 2023, Stagecoach ordered several brand-new Volvo 9700DD coaches for operation on services connecting Fife with Glasgow. Most have entered service with the operator in late 2024 and 2025.

===Gold===
In October 2007, Stagecoach in Perth commenced operations of the first of two Stagecoach Goldline services, operated as a trial for the wider Stagecoach Group in conjunction with a service run by Stagecoach Warwickshire. Stagecoach in Perth&#x27;s Goldline service 7 was operated using eight new Alexander Dennis Enviro300 single-deck buses, fitted out to a higher interior standard and painted in a special gold and blue livery. Since these trials, the brand, renamed to Stagecoach Gold, has expanded to Stagecoach subsidiaries across the United Kingdom, with Perth&#x27;s Gold service 7 later upgraded in 2012 to operate Alexander Dennis Enviro350H hybrid electric buses. However, the service has since been stripped of Gold status.

===Park &amp; Ride sites===
Since 1999, Stagecoach East Scotland has operated and provide numerous park &amp; ride sites across their operating area.

* Ferrytoll Park &amp; Ride located in Fife, north of the Forth Road Bridge (in partnership with Fife Council), opened in November 1999.
* Halbeath Park &amp; Ride located on the outskirts of Dunfermline in Fife (in partnership with Fife Council), opened in November 2012. Halbeath is also served by Scottish Citylink, FlixBus, Megabus and other long-distance transport operators
* Broxden Park &amp; Ride located on the western edge of Perth, which also connect with Scottish Citylink and Megabus services (in partnership with Perth &amp; Kinross Council).
*Kinross Park &amp; Ride located to the East of Junction 6 on the M90 motorway.

==Fleet and depots==

As of February 2025, Stagecoach East Scotland operates 477 buses and coaches from eight depots:
*Arbroath (Peasiehill Road)
*Blairgowrie (Haugh Road)
*Cowdenbeath (Broad Street) (Rennies)

<doc id="1256011" wikidata="Q5644362" url="?curid=1256011" title="Hamchang">
<text>Hamchang is an &quot;eup&quot; in Sangju City, North Gyeongsang province, South Korea. It comprises 30 distinct &quot;ri&quot; (the smallest South Korean administrative division), and has a population of 8,427 (from 2003 registration figures). There are two elementary schools, a middle school and a high school. Hamchang was once the capital of a small kingdom, Goryeong Gaya. Although its role today is far less central, it remains an important local town, served by intercity buses as well as the Gyeongbuk Line railroad.

==Geography==
Hamchang is located about 19 kilometers north of the Sangju city center, and borders Jeomchon in Mungyeong City directly on the north. Within Sangju, it adjoins the local districts of Ian-myeon, Gonggeom-myeon, and Sabeol-myeon. It covers a total area of 43.37 km². Of this 16.87 km² are vacant. The vacant land is mostly mountainous, but contains no high peaks; Obong Mountain itself stands a mere 192 meters high. Hamchang&#x27;s eastern border is formed by the Yeong River, which flows between Mungyeong&#x27;s Yeongsun-myeon and Hamchang-eup. The Iancheon stream runs from west to east across southern Hamchang and into the Yeong, which shortly thereafter meets the Nakdong.

==History== 

In the early Three Kingdoms period, the small kingdom of Goryeong Gaya is traditionally supposed to have been based in Hamchang, making it by far the northernmost state of the Gaya confederacy.

The reputed tomb of Goryeong&#x27;s founder, who is also the progenitor of the Hamchang Kim lineage, is located near the town center. On Obong Mountain, other tombs dating to the Three Kingdoms period have been excavated. These are sometimes associated with Sabeol-guk, a minor state which appears in early Silla records . What relation may have existed between Sabeol-guk and Goryeong Gaya, or whether they were in fact the same kingdom, is not known.

By the early 6th century, the Hamchang area was securely under Silla control. It was subsequently administered as part of the &quot;ju&quot; of Sangju. At this time, Hamchang was known by various names which appear to suggest a connection with Goryeong Gaya, such as Goreung (고릉, 古陵), Gonyeong (고녕, 古寧), and Godongnam-gun (고동람군, 古冬欖郡).

In the Goryeo period, in 964, the area became known as Hamnyeong-gun (함녕군, 咸寧郡). The name changed to the present &quot;Hamchang&quot; in 1018. In the Joseon period, the Hamchang area was designated as Hamchang-hyeon in 1490 and Hamchang-gun (Hamchang County) in 1895. In 1914, it became known as Hamchang-myeon and was included in Sangju County. It received its present designation as Hamchang-eup by presidential decree on December 1, 1980.

<doc id="1256013" wikidata="Q1377906" url="?curid=1256013" title="Culture of Europe">
<text>The Culture of Europe is diverse, and rooted in its art, architecture, traditions, cuisines, music, folklore, embroidery, film, literature, economics, philosophy and religious customs.

== Definition ==

Whilst there are a great number of perspectives that can be taken on the subject, it is impossible to form a single, all-embracing concept of European culture. Nonetheless, there are core elements which are generally agreed upon as forming the cultural foundation of modern Europe. One list of these elements given by K. Bochmann includes:
* A common cultural and spiritual heritage derived from Greco-Roman antiquity, Christianity, Judaism, the Renaissance, its Humanism, the political thinking of the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the developments of Modernity, including all types of socialism;
* A rich and dynamic material culture, parts of which have been extended to the other continents as the result of industrialization and colonialism during the &quot;Great Divergence&quot;;
* A specific conception of the individual expressed by the existence of, and respect for, a legality that guarantees human rights and the liberty of the individual;
* A plurality of states with different political orders, which share new ideas with one another.
* Respect for peoples, states, and nations outside Europe.

Berting says that these points fit with &quot;Europe&#x27;s most positive realizations&quot;.
The concept of European culture is arguably linked to the classical definition of the Western world. In this definition, Western culture is the set of literary, scientific, political, artistic, and philosophical principles which set it apart from other civilizations. Much of this set of traditions and knowledge is collected in the Western canon. The term has come to apply to countries whose history has been strongly marked by European immigration or settlement during the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the Americas, and Australasia, and is not restricted to Europe.

The Nobel Prize laureate in Literature Thomas Stearns Eliot, in his 1948 book &quot;Notes Towards the Definition of Culture&quot;, credited the prominent Christian influence upon the European culture: &quot;It is in Christianity that our arts have developed; it is in Christianity that the laws of Europe have--until recently--been rooted.&quot;

== History ==

In the 5th century BCE, Greek philosopher Herodotus conceptualized what it was that divided Europe and Asia, differentiating Europe, as the West (where the sun sets), from the East (where the sun rises). A later concept of Europe as a cultural sphere emerged during the Carolingian Renaissance of the late 8th and early 9th century, limited to the territories of Europe that practiced Western Christianity at the time.

Europe underwent social change and transition from the Middle Ages to modernisation, when the cultural movement Renaissance, from the 15th to 16th century, spread values and art techniques across the continent.

== Art ==

=== Prehistoric art ===
Surviving European prehistoric art mainly comprises sculpture and rock art. It includes the oldest known representation of the human body, the Venus of Hohle Fel, dating from 40,000 to 35,000 BC, found in Schelklingen, Germany, and the Löwenmensch figurine, from about 30,000 BC, the oldest undisputed piece of figurative art. The Swimming Reindeer of about 11,000 BCE is among the finest Magdalenian carvings in bone or antler of animals in the art of the Upper Paleolithic. At the beginning of the Mesolithic in Europe, the figurative sculpture was greatly reduced, and remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the Gundestrup cauldron from the European Iron Age and the Bronze Age Trundholm sun chariot. The oldest European cave art dates back to 40,800 and can be found in the El Castillo Cave in Spain, but cave art exists across the continent. Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces, but fewer of those paintings have survived because of erosion. One well-known example is the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi in the Saimaa area of Finland.

The Rock Art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin forms a distinct group with the human figure the main focus, often seen in large groups, with battles, dancing, and hunting all represented, as well as other activities and details such as clothing. The figures are generally rather sketchily depicted in thin paint, with the relationships between the groups of humans and animals more carefully depicted than individual figures. Prehistoric Celtic art is another distinct grouping from much of Iron Age Europe and survives mainly in the form of high-status metalwork skillfully decorated with complex, elegant, and mostly abstract designs, often using curving and spiral forms. Full-length human figures of any size are so rare that their absence may represent a religious taboo. As the Romans conquered Celtic territories, the style vanished, except in the British Isles, where it influenced the Insular style of the Early Middle Ages.

=== Classical art ===

Ancient Greek art stands out among that of other ancient cultures for its development of naturalistic but idealized depictions of the human body, in which largely nude male figures were generally the focus of innovation. The rate of stylistic development between about 750 and 300 BC was remarkable by ancient standards, and in surviving works is best seen in Ancient Greek sculpture. There were important innovations in painting, which have to be essentially reconstructed due to the lack of original survivals of quality, other than the distinct field of painted pottery. Black-figure pottery and the subsequent red-figure pottery are famous and influential examples of the Ancient Greek decorative arts.

Roman art was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting and sculpture, but was also strongly influenced by the more local Etruscan art of Italy. The sculpture was perhaps considered as the highest form of art by Romans, but figure painting was also very highly regarded. The Roman sculpture is primarily portraiture derived from the upper classes of society as well as depictions of the gods. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Among surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in Campania, in Southern Italy, especially at Pompeii and Herculaneum. Such painting can be grouped into four main &quot;styles&quot; or periods and may contain the first examples of trompe-l&#x27;œil, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape. Early Christian art grew out of Roman popular, and later Imperial, art and adapted its iconography from these sources.

=== Medieval art ===
Medieval art can be broadly categorized into the Byzantine art of the Eastern Roman Empire, and the Gothic art that emerged in Western Europe over the same period.

Byzantine art was strongly influenced by its classical heritage but distinguished itself by the development of a new, abstract, aesthetic, marked by anti-naturalism and a favor for symbolism. The subject matter of monumental Byzantine art was primarily religious and imperial: the two themes are often combined, as in the portraits of later Byzantine emperors that decorated the interior of the sixth-century church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. However, the Byzantines inherited the Early Christian distrust of monumental sculpture in religious art, and produced only reliefs, of which very few survivals are anything like life-size, in sharp contrast to the medieval art of the West, where monumental sculpture revived from Carolingian art onwards. Small ivories were also mostly in relief. The so-called &quot;minor arts&quot; were very important in Byzantine art, and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation Consular diptychs or caskets such as the Veroli casket, hardstone carvings, enamels, glass, jewelry, metalwork, and figured silks were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era.
Migration Period art includes the art of the Germanic tribes on the continent, as well the start of the distinct Insular art or Hiberno-Saxon art of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic fusion in the British Isles. It covers many different styles of art including the polychrome style and the Scythian and Germanic animal style. After Christianization, Migration Period art developed into various schools of Early Medieval art in Western Europe, which are normally classified by region, such as Anglo-Saxon art and Carolingian art, before the continent-wide styles of Romanesque art and finally Gothic art developed.Romanesque art and Gothic art dominated Western and Central Europe from approximately 1000 AD to the rise of the Renaissance style in the 15th century or later, depending on the region. The Romanesque style was greatly influenced by Byzantine and Insular art. Religious art, such as church sculpture and decorated manuscripts, was particularly prominent. Art of the period was characterized by a very vigorous style in both sculpture and painting. Colors tended to be very striking and mostly primary. Compositions usually had little depth, and needed to be flexible to be squeezed into the shapes of historiated initials, column capitals, and church tympanums. Figures often varied in size in relation to their importance, and landscape backgrounds, if attempted at all, were closer to abstract decorations than realism.

Gothic art developed from Romanesque art in Northern France in the 12th century AD, led by the concurrent development of Gothic architecture. It spread to all of Western Europe, and much of Southern and Central Europe. In the late 14th century, the sophisticated court style of International Gothic developed, which continued to evolve until the late 15th century. In many areas, especially England and Germany, Late Gothic art continued well into the 16th century. Gothic art was often typological in nature, showing the stories of the New Testament and the Old Testament side by side. Saints&#x27; lives were often depicted. Images of the Virgin Mary changed from the Byzantine iconic form to a more human and affectionate mother, often showing the refined manners of a courtly lady.

Secular art came into its own during the gothic period alongside the creation of a bourgeois class who could afford to patronize the arts and commission works. Increased literacy and a growing body of secular vernacular literature encouraged the representation of secular themes in art. With the growth of cities, trade guilds were formed, and artists were often required to be members of a painters&#x27; guild—as a result, because of better record-keeping, more artists are known to us by name in this period than any previous.

=== Renaissance art ===

Renaissance art emerged as a distinct style in northern Italy from around 1420, in parallel with developments which occurred in philosophy, literature, music, and science. It took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, but was also influenced by the art of Northern Europe and contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance artists painted a wide variety of themes. Religious altarpieces, fresco cycles, and small works for private devotion were very popular. Painters in both Italy and northern Europe frequently turned to Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s &quot;Golden Legend&quot; (1260), a highly influential sourcebook for the lives of saints that had already had a strong influence on Medieval artists. Interest in classical antiquity and Renaissance humanism also resulted in many Mythological and history paintings. Decorative ornament, often used in painted architectural elements, was especially influenced by classical Roman motifs.

Techniques characteristic of Renaissance art include the use of proportion and linear perspective; foreshortening, to create an illusion of depth; sfumato, a technique of softening of sharp outlines by subtle blending of tones to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality; and chiaroscuro, the effect of using a strong contrast between light and dark to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality.

=== Mannerism, Baroque and Rococo ===
Renaissance Classicism spawned two different movements—Mannerism and the Baroque. Mannerism, a reaction against the idealist perfection of Classicism, employed distortion of light and spatial frameworks in order to emphasize the emotional content of a painting and the emotions of the painter. Where High Renaissance art emphasizes proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant. The style is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities. It favors compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity of earlier Renaissance paintings.

In contrast, Baroque art took the representationalism of the Renaissance to new heights, emphasizing detail, movement, lighting, and drama. Perhaps the best-known Baroque painters are Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, and Diego Velázquez. Baroque art is often seen as part of the Counter-Reformation— the revival of spiritual life in the Roman Catholic Church. Religious and political themes are widely explored within the Baroque artistic context, and both paintings and sculptures are characterized by a strong element of drama, emotion, and theatricality. Baroque art was particularly ornate and elaborate in nature, often using rich, warm colors with dark undertones. Dutch Golden Age painting is a distinct subset of Baroque, leading to the development of secular genres such as still life, genre paintings of everyday scenes, and landscape painting.

By the 18th century, Baroque art had developed into Rococo in France. Rococo art was even more elaborate than the Baroque, but it was less serious and more playful. The artistic movement no longer placed emphasis on politics and religion, focusing instead on lighter themes such as romance, celebration, and appreciation of nature. Furthermore, it sought inspiration from the artistic forms and ornamentation of Far Eastern Asia, resulting in the rise in favor of porcelain figurines and chinoiserie in general. Rococo soon fell out of favor, being seen by many as a gaudy and superficial movement emphasizing aesthetics over meaning.

=== Neoclassical, Romanticism, and Realism ===

Neoclassicism began in the 18th century as a counter-movement opposing Rococo. It desired for a return to the simplicity, order, and &#x27;purism&#x27; of classical antiquity, especially ancient Greece and Rome. Neoclassicism was the artistic component of the intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. Neoclassicism had become widespread in Europe throughout the 18th century, especially in the United Kingdom. In many ways, Neoclassicism can be seen as a political movement as well as an artistic and cultural one. Neoclassical art places emphasis on order, symmetry, and classical simplicity; common themes in Neoclassical art include courage and war, as were commonly explored in ancient Greek and Roman art. Ingres, Canova, and Jacques-Louis David are among the best-known neoclassicists.

Just as Mannerism rejected Classicism, Romanticism rejected the aesthetic of the Neoclassicists, specifically the highly objective and ordered nature of Neoclassicism, favoring instead a more individual and emotional approach to the arts. Emphasis was placed on nature, especially when aiming to portray the power and beauty of the natural world, and emotions. Romantic art often used colors in order to express feelings and emotions. Romantic art was inspired by ancient Greek and Roman art and mythology, but also takes much of its aesthetic qualities from medievalism and Gothicism, as well as later mythology and folklore. Among the greatest Romantic artists were Eugène Delacroix, Francisco Goya, J. M. W. Turner, John Constable, Caspar David Friedrich, and William Blake.

In response to these changes caused by Industrialisation, the movement of Realism emerged, which sought to accurately portray the conditions and hardships of the poor in the hopes of changing society. In contrast with Romanticism, which was essentially optimistic about mankind, Realism offered a stark vision of poverty and despair. While Romanticism glorified nature, Realism portrayed life in the depths of an urban wasteland. Like Romanticism, Realism was a literary as well as an artistic movement. Other contemporary movements were more Historicist in nature, such as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which attempted to return art to its state of &quot;purity&quot; prior to Raphael, and the Arts and Crafts Movement, which reacted against the impersonality of mass-produced goods and advocated a return to medieval craftsmanship.

== Music ==

=== Classical music ===
===Pre-1600===
This broad era encompasses early music, which generally comprises Medieval music (500–1400) and Renaissance music (1400–1600), but sometimes includes Baroque music (1600–1760).

===Post-1600===
This era includes the common practice period from approximately 1600 to 1900, as well as the modernist and postmodernist styles that emerged after 1900 and which continue to the present day.

=== Modern music ===
Folk music: Europe has a wide and diverse range of indigenous music, sharing common features in rural, traveling, or maritime communities. Folk music is embedded in an unwritten, oral tradition, but was increasingly transcribed from the nineteenth century onwards. Many classical composers used folk melodies, and folk music continues to influence popular music in Europe, however its prominence varies across countries. See the list of European folk music.

Popular music: Europe has imported many different genres of popular music, including Rock, Blues, R&amp;B Soul, Jazz, Hip-Hop and Pop. Various modern genres named after Europe are rooted in Electronic dance music (EDM), and include Europop, Eurodisco, Eurodance and Eurobeat. Popular music can vary considerably across Europe. Styles of music from nations formerly under Ottoman rule enrich this variation, with their native musical traditions having fused with Ottoman musical influences over centuries.

=== Prehistoric architecture ===
The Neolithic long house was a long, narrow timber dwelling built by the first farmers in Europe beginning at least as early as the period 5000 to 6000 BC. Knap of Howar and Skara Brae, the Orkney Islands, Scotland, are stone-built Neolithic settlements dating from 3,500 BC. Megaliths found in Europe and the Mediterranean were also erected in the Neolithic period. See Neolithic architecture.

=== Ancient classical architecture ===

Ancient Greek architecture was produced by the Greek-speaking people whose culture flourished on the Greek mainland, the Peloponnese, the Aegean Islands, and in colonies in Anatolia and Italy for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD. Ancient Greek architecture is distinguished by its highly formalized characteristics, both of structure and decoration. The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the Doric Order, the Ionic Order, and the Corinthian Order, was to have a profound effect on the Western architecture of later periods.

Ancient Roman architecture adopted the external language of classical Greek architecture for the purposes of the ancient Romans, but differed from Greek buildings, becoming a new architectural style. The two styles are often considered one body of classical architecture. Roman architecture flourished in the Roman Republic and even more so under the Empire, when the great majority of surviving buildings were constructed. It used new materials, particularly concrete, and newer technologies such as the arch and the dome to make buildings that were typically strong and well-engineered. Large numbers remain in some form across the empire, sometimes complete and still in use.]

=== Medieval architecture ===
Romanesque architecture combines features of ancient Roman and Byzantine buildings and other local traditions. It is known for its massive quality, thick walls, round arches, sturdy pillars, groin vaults, large towers, and decorative arcading. Each building has clearly defined forms, frequently of a very regular, symmetrical plan; the overall appearance is one of simplicity when compared with the Gothic buildings that were to follow. The style can be identified right across Europe, despite regional characteristics and different materials, and is most frequently seen in churches. Plenty of examples of this architecture are found alongside the Camino de Santiago.

Gothic architecture flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Originating in 12th century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as &quot;Opus Francigenum&quot; (&quot;French work&quot;), with the term &quot;Gothic&quot; first appearing during the latter part of the Renaissance. Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault (which evolved from the joint vaulting of Romanesque architecture), and the flying buttress. Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys, and churches of Europe.

=== Renaissance and baroque architecture ===

Renaissance architecture began in the early 14th and lasted until the early 17th century. It demonstrates a conscious revival and development of certain elements of ancient Greek and Roman architectural thought and material culture, particularly the symmetry, proportion, geometry, and the regularity of parts of ancient buildings. Developed first in Florence, with Filippo Brunelleschi as one of its innovators, the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities. The style was carried to France, Germany, England, Russia, and other parts of Europe at different dates and with varying degrees of impact

Palladian architecture was derived from and inspired by the designs of the Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580). Palladio&#x27;s work was strongly based on the symmetry, perspective, and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans. From the 17th century, Palladio&#x27;s interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism. It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century, and continued to be popular in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings.

Baroque architecture began in 16th-century Italy. It took the Roman vocabulary of Renaissance architecture and used it in a new rhetorical and theatrical fashion. It was, initially at least, directly linked to the Counter-Reformation, a movement within the Catholic Church to reform itself in response to the Protestant Reformation. Baroque was characterized by new explorations of form, light, and shadow, and a freer treatment of classical elements. It reached its extreme form in the Rococo style.

=== 19th-century architecture ===

Revivalism was a hallmark of nineteenth-century European architecture. Revivals of the Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque styles all took place, alongside revivals of the Classical styles. Regional styles, such as English Tudor, were also revived, as well as non-European styles, such as Chinese (Chinoiserie) and Egyptian. These revivals often used elements of the original style in a freer way than original examples, sometimes borrowing from multiple styles at once. At Alnwick Castle, for example, Gothic revival elements were added to the exterior of the original medieval castle, while the interiors were designed in a Renaissance style.

Art Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles which dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration. The buildings were covered with ornament in curving forms, based on flowers, plants, or animals: butterflies, peacocks, swans, irises, cyclamens, orchids, and water lilies. Façades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome ceramic tiles. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament.

=== 20th-century and modern architecture ===
Art Deco architecture began in Brussels in 1903–04. Early buildings had clean lines, rectangular forms, and no decoration on the facades; they marked a clean break with the Art Nouveau style. After the First World War, art deco buildings of steel and reinforced concrete began to appear in large cities across Europe and the United States. Buildings became more decorated, and interiors were extremely colorful and dynamic, combining sculpture, murals, and ornate geometric design in marble, glass, ceramics, and stainless steel.

Modernist architecture is a term applied to a group of styles of architecture that emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after World War II. It was based upon new technologies of construction, particularly the use of glass, steel, and reinforced concrete; and upon a rejection of the traditional neoclassical architecture and Beaux-Arts styles that were popular in the 19th century. Modernist architecture continued to be the dominant architectural style for institutional and corporate buildings into the 1980s, when it was challenged by postmodernism.

Expressionist architecture is a form of modern architecture that began during the first decades of the 20th century, in parallel with the expressionist visual and performing arts that especially developed and dominated in Germany. In the 1950s, the second movement of expressionist architecture developed, initiated by the Ronchamp Chapel Notre-Dame-du-Haut (1950–1955) by Le Corbusier. The style was individualistic, but tendencies include Distortion of form for an emotional effect, efforts at achieving the new, original, and visionary, and a conception of architecture as a work of art.

Postmodern architecture emerged in the 1960s as a reaction against the austerity, formality, and lack of variety of modern architecture, particularly in the international style advocated by Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Embraced in the USA first, it spread to Europe. In contrast to Modernist buildings, Postmodern buildings have curved forms, decorative elements, asymmetry, bright colors, and features often borrowed from earlier periods. Colors and textures unrelated to the structure or function of the building. While rejecting the &quot;puritanism&quot; of modernism, it called for a return to ornament, and an accumulation of citations and collages borrowed from past styles. It borrowed freely from classical architecture, Rococo, neoclassical architecture, the Viennese secession, the British Arts and Crafts movement, the German Jugendstil.

Deconstructivist architecture is a movement of postmodern architecture which appeared in the 1980s, which gives the impression of the fragmentation of the constructed building. It is characterized by an absence of harmony, continuity, or symmetry. Its name comes from the idea of &quot;Deconstruction&quot;, a form of semiotic analysis developed by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida. Besides fragmentation, Deconstructivism often manipulates the structure&#x27;s surface skin and creates by non-rectilinear shapes which appear to distort and dislocate elements of architecture. The finished visual appearance is characterized by unpredictability and controlled chaos.

== Literature ==


Western literature, also known as European literature, is the literature written in the context of Western culture in the languages of Europe, and is shaped by the periods in which they were conceived, with each period containing prominent western authors, poets, and pieces of literature.

The best of Western literature is considered to be the Western canon. The list of works in the Western canon varies according to the critic&#x27;s opinions on Western culture and the relative importance of its defining characteristics. Different literary periods held great influence on the literature of Western and European countries, with movements and political changes impacting the prose and poetry of the period. The 16th Century is known for the creation of Renaissance literature, while the 17th century was influenced by both Baroque and Jacobean forms. The 18th century progressed into a period known as the Enlightenment Era for many western countries. This period of military and political advancement influenced the style of literature created by French, Russian and Spanish literary figures. The 19th century was known as the Romantic era, in which the style of writing was influenced by the political issues of the century, and differed from the previous classicist form.

As the Western Roman Empire declined, the Latin tradition was kept alive by writers such as Cassiodorus, Boethius, and Symmachus. The liberal arts flourished at Ravenna under Theodoric, and the Gothic kings surrounded themselves with masters of rhetoric and of grammar. Some lay schools remained in Italy, and noted scholars included Magnus Felix Ennodius, Arator, Venantius Fortunatus, Felix the Grammarian, Peter of Pisa, Paulinus of Aquileia, and many others. The later establishment of the medieval universities of Bologna, Padua, Vicenza, Naples, Salerno, Modena and Parma helped to spread culture and prepared the ground in which the new vernacular literature developed. Classical traditions did not disappear, and affection for the memory of Rome, a preoccupation with politics, and a preference for practice over theory combined to influence the development of Italian literature.

William Shakespeare was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world&#x27;s pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England&#x27;s national poet and the &quot;Bard of Avon&quot; (or simply &quot;the Bard&quot;). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.

Dante Alighieri, widely known mononymously as Dante, was an Italian poet, writer, and philosopher. His &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, originally called (modern Italian: &quot;Commedia&quot;) and later christened by Giovanni Boccaccio, is widely considered one of the most important poems of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the Italian language. Dante is known for establishing the use of the vernacular in literature at a time when most poetry was written in Latin, which was accessible only to educated readers. His &quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot; (&quot;On Eloquence in the Vernacular&quot;) was one of the first scholarly defenses of the vernacular. His use of the Florentine dialect for works such as &quot;The New Life&quot; (1295) and &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; helped establish the modern-day standardized Italian language. His work set a precedent that important Italian writers such as Petrarch and Boccaccio would later follow.

Miguel de Cervantes was a Spanish writer widely regarded as the greatest writer in the Spanish language and one of the world&#x27;s pre-eminent novelists. He is best known for his novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, a work considered as the first modern novel. The novel has been labelled by many well-known authors as the &quot;best book of all time&quot; and the &quot;best and most central work in world literature&quot;.

Leo Tolstoy was a Russian writer. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential authors of all time. He received nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature every year from 1902 to 1906 and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901, 1902, and 1909. Tolstoy never having won a Nobel Prize was a major Nobel Prize controversy, and remains one.

== Science ==


The history of science covers the development of science from ancient times to the present. It encompasses all three major branches of science: natural, social, and formal. Protoscience, early sciences, and natural philosophies such as alchemy and astrology during the Bronze Age, Iron Age, classical antiquity, and the Middle Ages declined during the early modern period after the establishment of formal disciplines of science in the Age of Enlightenment.

Science&#x27;s earliest roots can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia around 3000 to 1200 BCE. These civilizations&#x27; contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine influenced later Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, wherein formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Latin-speaking Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but continued to thrive in the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire. Aided by translations of Greek texts, the Hellenistic worldview was preserved and absorbed into the Arabic-speaking Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age. The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived the learning of natural philosophy in the West. Traditions of early science were also developed in ancient India and separately in ancient China, the Chinese model having influenced Vietnam, Korea and Japan before Western exploration. Among the Pre-Columbian peoples of Mesoamerica, the Zapotec civilization established their first known traditions of astronomy and mathematics for producing calendars, followed by other civilizations such as the Maya.

Natural philosophy was transformed during the Scientific Revolution in 16th- to 17th-century Europe, as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions. The New Science that emerged was more mechanistic in its worldview, more integrated with mathematics, and more reliable and open as its knowledge was based on a newly defined scientific method. More &quot;revolutions&quot; in subsequent centuries soon followed. The chemical revolution of the 18th century, for instance, introduced new quantitative methods and measurements for chemistry. In the 19th century, new perspectives regarding the conservation of energy, age of Earth, and evolution came into focus. And in the 20th century, new discoveries in genetics and physics laid the foundations for new sub disciplines such as molecular biology and particle physics. Moreover, industrial and military concerns as well as the increasing complexity of new research endeavors ushered in the era of &quot;big science,&quot; particularly after World War II.

== Philosophy ==

Western philosophy, also known as European philosophy, refers to the philosophical thought, traditions and works of the Western world. Historically, the term refers to the philosophical thinking of Western culture, beginning with the ancient Greek philosophy of the pre-Socratics. The word &quot;philosophy&quot; itself originated from the Ancient Greek (φιλοσοφία), literally, &quot;the love of wisdom&quot; , &quot;to love&quot; and σοφία &quot;sophía&quot;, &quot;wisdom&quot;. European philosophy is a predominant strand of philosophy globally, and is central to philosophical enquiry in the Americas and most other parts of the world which have fallen under its influence. The Greek schools of philosophy in antiquity provide the basis of philosophical discourse that extends to today. Christian thought had a huge influence on many fields of European philosophy (as European philosophy has been on Christian thought too), sometimes as a reaction. Many political ideologies were theorized in Europe, such as capitalism, communism, fascism, socialism, or anarchism.

The scope of ancient Western philosophy included the problems of philosophy as they are understood today; but it also included many other disciplines, such as pure mathematics and natural sciences such as physics, astronomy, and biology (Aristotle, for example, wrote on all of these topics). The Classical period of ancient Greek philosophy centers on Socrates and the two generations of students who followed. Medieval philosophy roughly extends from the Christianization of the Roman Empire until the Renaissance. It is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical Greek and Hellenistic philosophy, and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then-widespread sacred doctrines of Abrahamic religion (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) with secular learning. Some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of faith to reason, the existence and unity of God, the object of theology and metaphysics, the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation. 

The Renaissance (&quot;rebirth&quot;) was a period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern thought, in which the recovery of ancient Greek philosophical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic, metaphysics, and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality, philology, and mysticism. The term &quot;modern philosophy&quot; has multiple usages. For example, Thomas Hobbes is sometimes considered the first modern philosopher because he applied a systematic method to political philosophy. By contrast, René Descartes is often considered the first modern philosopher because he grounded his philosophy in problems of &quot;knowledge&quot;, rather than problems of metaphysics.

German idealism emerged in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It developed out of the work of Immanuel Kant in the 1780s and 1790s. Transcendental idealism, advocated by Immanuel Kant, is the view that there are limits on what can be understood since there is much that cannot be brought under the conditions of objective judgment. Kant wrote his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (1781) in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting approaches of rationalism and empiricism, and to establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysics. Although Kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a conceptual or categorical framework on the stream of pure sensory data—a framework including space and time themselves—he maintained that things-in-themselves existed independently of human perceptions and judgments; he was therefore not an idealist in any simple sense. Kant&#x27;s account of things-in-themselves is both controversial and highly complex. Continuing his work, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world, and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy.

The three major contemporary approaches to academic philosophy are analytic philosophy, continental philosophy and pragmatism. They are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. The 20th century deals with the upheavals produced by a series of conflicts within philosophical discourse over the basis of knowledge, with classical certainties overthrown, and new social, economic, scientific and logical problems. 20th-century philosophy was set for a series of attempts to reform and preserve and to alter or abolish, older knowledge systems. Seminal figures include Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Jean-Paul Sartre.

== Religion ==


Christianity has been the dominant religion shaping European culture for at least the last 1700 years. Modern philosophical thought has very much been influenced by Christian philosophers such as St Thomas Aquinas and Erasmus. And throughout most of its history, European values have been nearly synonymous with Christian culture. Christian culture is said to have been the predominant force in western civilization, guiding the course of philosophy, art, and science. The notion of &quot;Europe and the Western World&quot; has been intimately connected with the concept of &quot;Christianity and Christendom&quot;. Many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.

Religion has been a major influence on the societies, cultures, traditions, philosophies, artistic expressions and laws within present-day Europe. The largest religion in Europe is Christianity. However, irreligion and practical secularisation are also prominent in some countries. In Southeastern Europe, three countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Albania) have Muslim majorities, with Christianity being the second-largest religion in those countries. 

Little is known about the prehistoric religion of Neolithic Europe. Bronze and Iron Age religion in Europe as elsewhere was predominantly polytheistic and included Ancient Greek religion, Ancient Roman religion, Slavic paganism, Finnish paganism, Celtic polytheism and Germanic paganism. Modern revival movements of these religions, and religions influenced by them, include Heathenism, Rodnovery, Romuva, Druidry, Wicca. 

The Roman Empire officially adopted Christianity in AD 380. Most of Europe underwent Christianisation during the Early Middle Ages, with the process being essentially complete with the Christianisation of Lithuania in the High Middle Ages, with the exception of Al-Andalus. The notion of &quot;Europe&quot; and the &quot;Western World&quot; has been intimately connected with the concept of &quot;Christendom&quot;, and many even consider Christianity as the unifying belief that created a European identity, especially since Christianity in the Middle East was marginalized by the rise of Islam from the 8th century. This confrontation led to the Crusades, which ultimately failed militarily, but were an important step in the emergence of a European identity based on religion. Despite this, traditions of folk religion continued at all times, largely independent from institutional religion or dogmatic theology.

The Great Schism of the 11th century and Reformation of the 16th century tore apart Christendom into hostile factions, and following the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, atheism and agnosticism have spread across Europe. Nineteenth-century Orientalism contributed to a certain popularity of Hinduism and Buddhism, and the 20th century brought increasing syncretism, New Age, and various new religious movements divorcing spirituality from inherited traditions for many Europeans. Recent times have seen increased secularisation and religious pluralism. Smaller religions include Indian religions, Judaism, and some East Asian religions, which are found in their largest groups in Britain, France, and Kalmykia.

Christianity is the largest religion in Europe, with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves Christian in 2010, As 2010, Catholics were the largest Christian group in Europe, accounting for more than 48% of European Christians. The second-largest Christian group in Europe was the Orthodox, who made up 32% of European Christians. About 19% of European Christians were part of the Protestant tradition. Russia is the largest Christian country in Europe by population, followed by Germany and Italy. In 2012 Europe constituted in absolute terms the world&#x27;s largest Christian population. Historically, Europe has been the center and cradle of Christian civilization. Christianity played a prominent role in the development of the European culture and identity.

According to Scholars, in 2017, Europe&#x27;s population was 77.8% Christian (up from 74.9% 1970), these changes were largely result of the collapse of Communism and switching to Christianity in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries.

== Cuisine ==
The cuisines of European countries are diverse by themselves, although there are common characteristics that distinguish European cooking from cuisines of Asian countries and others. Compared with traditional cooking of Asian countries, for example, meat is more prominent and substantial in serving-size. Dairy products are often utilized in the cooking process. Wheat-flour bread has long been the most common source of starch in this cuisine, along with pasta, dumplings, and pastries, although the potato has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the European colonization of the Americas.

== Fashion ==

The earliest definite examples of needles originate from the Solutrean culture, which existed in France and Spain from 19,000 BC to 15,000 BC. The earliest dyed flax fibers have been found in a cave in Georgia and date back to 36,000 BP. See Clothing in ancient Rome, 1100–1200 in fashion, 1200–1300 in fashion, 1300–1400 in fashion, 1400–1500 in fashion, 1500–1550 in fashion, 1550–1600 in fashion, 1600–1650 in fashion, 1650–1700 in fashion, Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Italian fashion has a long tradition. &quot;Top Global Fashion Capital Rankings&quot; (2013), by Global Language Monitor, ranked Rome sixth and Milan twelfth. Major Italian fashion labels—such as Gucci, Armani, Prada, Versace, Valentino, Dolce &amp; Gabbana—are among the finest fashion houses in the world. Jewellers such as Bulgari, Damiani, and Buccellati were founded in Italy. The fashion magazine &quot;Vogue Italia&quot; is one of the most prestigious fashion magazines in the world. Italy is prominent in the field of design, notably interior, architectural, industrial, and urban designs. Milan and Turin are the nation&#x27;s leaders in architectural and industrial design. The city of Milan hosts Fiera Milano, Europe&#x27;s largest design fair. Milan hosts major design- and architecture-related events and venues, such as the &quot;Fuori Salone&quot; and the Milan Furniture Fair, and has been home to the designers Bruno Munari, Lucio Fontana, Enrico Castellani, and Piero Manzoni.

=== Olympics ===

Ancient Olympic Games, or the ancient Olympics, were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of ancient Greece. They were held at the Panhellenic religious sanctuary of Olympia, in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. The originating Olympic Games are traditionally dated to 776 BC. The games were held every four years, or Olympiad, which became a unit of time in historical chronologies. These Olympiads were referred to based on the winner of their &quot;stadion&quot; sprint, e.g., &quot;the third year of the eighteenth Olympiad when Ladas of Argos won the &quot;stadion&quot;&quot;. They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule in the 2nd century BC. Their last recorded celebration was in AD 393, under the emperor Theodosius I, but archaeological evidence indicates that some games were still held after this date. The games likely came to an end under Theodosius II, possibly in connection with a fire that burned down the temple of the Olympian Zeus during his reign.

During the celebration of the games, the Olympic truce (&quot;ekecheiría&quot;) was announced so that athletes and religious pilgrims could travel from their cities to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns. The games became a political tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rival city states. Politicians would announce political alliances at the games, and in times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods for victory. The games were also used to help spread Hellenistic culture throughout the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious celebrations. The statue of Zeus at Olympia was counted as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Sculptors and poets would congregate each Olympiad to display their works of art to would-be patrons.

The ancient Olympics had fewer events than the modern games, and for many years only freeborn Greek men were allowed to participate, although there were victorious women chariot owners. Moreover, throughout their history, the Olympics, both ancient and modern, have occasionally become arenas where political expressions, such as demonstrations, boycotts, and embargoes, have been employed by nations and individuals to exert influence over these sporting events. As long as they met the entrance criteria, athletes from any Greek city-state and kingdom were allowed to participate. The games were always held at Olympia rather than moving between different locations like the modern Olympic Games. Victors at the Olympics were honored, and their feats chronicled for future generations.
The modern Olympic Games are the world&#x27;s leading international sporting events. They feature summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world&#x27;s foremost sports competition, with more than 200 teams, representing sovereign states and territories, participating. By default, the Games generally substitute for any world championships during the year in which they take place (however, each class usually maintains its own records). The Olympics are staged every four years. Since 1994, they have alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during the four-year Olympiad.

Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, which encompasses all entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games. The Olympic Charter defines their structure and authority.

The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in numerous changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental Games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC need to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World Wars I and II led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics; and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 restrictions.

=== Contemporary sports ===

* Association football, which has its origins in the United Kingdom. The oldest association is The Football Association of England (1863), and the first international match was between Scotland and England (1872). It is now the world&#x27;s most popular sport and is played throughout Europe.
* Cricket has its origins in southeast England. It is popular throughout England and Wales, and parts of the Netherlands. It is also popular in other areas in Northwest Europe. It is however, very popular worldwide, especially in Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and the Indian subcontinent.
* Cycling, which is also immensely popular as a means of transport, has most of its sporting adherents in Europe. Tour de France is the world&#x27;s most-watched live annual sporting event. The bicycle itself is probably from France (see History of the bicycle).
* The discus throw, javelin throw, and shot put have their origins in ancient Greece. The Olympics, both ancient and modern, have their origins too in Europe, and have a massive influence globally.
* Field Hockey, as a modern game, began in 18th century England, with Ireland having the oldest federation. It is popular in Western Europe, the Indian subcontinent, Australia and East Asia. Ice hockey, popular in Europe and North America, may derive from this sport.
* Golf, one of the most popular sports in Europe, Asia, and North America, has its origins in Scotland, with the oldest course being at Musselburgh.
* Handball, which is popular in Europe and elsewhere, has its origins in antiquity. The modern game is from Denmark and Germany, with Germany having been involved in both the first women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s internationals.
* Rugby League and Rugby Union were both created in England. They both have similar origins to football. Rugby Union is the older of the two codes and has rules that date from 1845 (see articles: History of rugby league and History of rugby union). They acrimoniously split in the late 19th century over the treatment of injured players. Rugby league gradually changed its laws over the next century with the result that today both sports have little in common, apart from the basics. They have both been carried abroad by colonization, particularly to many former British colonies. American Football and Canadian Football are derivatives of rugby.
* Tennis which originates from England, and related games such as Table Tennis, derive from the game Real Tennis which is from France. It is popular throughout the world.

=== Regional sports ===

In addition, Europe has numerous national or regional sports which do not command a large international following outside of emigrant groups. These include:
* Alpine Wrestling in Switzerland.
* Bandy in Russia, Sweden, and Finland
* Basque Pelota in parts of Spain and France, and which has been brought to the Americas by emigrants.
* Bullfighting in Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France near the Spanish Border.
* Gaelic Football in Ireland, which influenced Australian rules football.
* Gaelic Handball (Ireland) which was taken to the United States in the form of American Handball.
* Hurling in Ireland.
* Korfbal in the Netherlands and Belgium.
* Pesäpallo &quot;(Boboll)&quot; in Finland
* Pétanque, Boules, Irish Road Bowling, Skittles, Bocce, and Bowls and others are variations of bowling games which are popular throughout Europe and have been spread around the world.
* Rounders from England now popular in northwest Europe from which Baseball derives.
* Shinty in Scotland, which influenced ice hockey in Canada (&quot;see also Shinny&quot;).
* Trotting in southern Europe.

Some sports competitions feature a European team gathering athletes from different European countries. These teams use the European flag as an emblem. The most famous of these competitions is the Ryder Cup in golf. Some sporting organizations hold European Championships like European Cricket Council, the European Games, the European Rugby Cup (Club/Regional competition), the European SC Championships, the FIRA - Association of European Rugby, the IIHF, the Mitropa Cup, the Rugby League European Federation - European Championship, the Sport in the European Union and the UEFA.

== Symbols ==

A number of symbols of Europe have emerged since antiquity, notably the mythological figure of &quot;Europa&quot;. Several symbols were introduced in the 1950s and 1960s by the European Council. The European Communities created additional symbols for itself in 1985, which was to become inherited by the European Union (EU) in 1993. Such symbols of the European Union now represent political positions in support of EU policies and European integration as advocated by Europeans.

&quot;Europa&quot; was used as a geographical term, for one of the great divisions of the known world, by Herodotus (in a reduced geographical scope, referring to parts of Thrace or Epirus, also in the Homeric hymn to Apollo). It became the geographical term for the landmass west of the Tanais in the Roman-era geography by Strabo and Ptolemy. &quot;Europa&quot; first began to be used in a cultural sense, denoting the territory of Latin Christendom, in the Carolingian period. &quot;Europa&quot; is a feminine name, the name of a nymph in Hesiod, and in a legend first related by Herodotus, the name of a Phoenician noble-woman abducted by Greeks (in Herodotus&#x27; opinion, Cretans). The classical legend of Europa being abducted not by Greek pirates but by Zeus in the shape of a bull is told in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. According to the account, Zeus took the guise of a tame white bull and mixed himself with the herds of Europa&#x27;s father. While Europa and her female attendants were gathering flowers, she saw the bull, and got onto his back. Zeus took that opportunity and ran to the sea and swam, with her on his back, to the island of Crete. There he revealed his true identity, and Europa became the first queen of Crete. Zeus gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus and three additional gifts: Talos, Laelaps and a javelin that never missed. Zeus later re-created the shape of the white bull in the stars, which is now known as the constellation Taurus.

Europa regina (Latin for &quot;Queen Europe&quot;) is the cartographic depiction of the European continent as a queen. Introduced and made popular during the mannerist period, &quot;Europa Regina&quot; is the map-like depiction of the European continent as a queen. Made popular in the 16th century, the map shows Europe as a young and graceful woman wearing imperial regalia. The Iberian Peninsula (&quot;Hispania&quot;) is the head, wearing a crown shaped like the Carolingian hoop crown. The Pyrenees, forming the neck, separate the Iberian Peninsula from France (Gallia), which makes up the upper chest. The Holy Roman Empire (Germania and other territories) is the centre of the torso, with Bohemia (sometimes Austria in early depictions) being the heart of the woman (alternatively described as a medallion at her waist). Her long gown stretches to Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, Livonia, Bulgaria, Muscovy, Macedonia and Greece. In her arms, formed by Italy and Denmark, she holds a sceptre and an orb (Sicily). In most depictions, Africa, Asia and the Scandinavian peninsula are partially shown, as are the British Isles, in schematic form.

Charlemagne (; King of the Franks from 768; Holy Roman Emperor c. 742814), also known as Charles the Great, is considered the founder of the French and German monarchies. Known as &quot;Pater Europae&quot; («Father of Europe»), he established an empire that represented the most expansive European unification since the fall of the Western Roman Empire and brought about a renaissance that formed a pan-European identity whilst marking the end of Late Antiquity. There was also a contemporary intellectual and cultural revival which profoundly marked the history of Western Europe. This gave Charlemagne a legendary standing that transcended his military accomplishments.

The Roman Catholic Church venerates six saints as &quot;patrons of Europe&quot;. Benedict of Nursia had been declared &quot;Patron saint of all Europe&quot; by Pope Paul VI in 1964.
Pope John Paul II named between 1980 and 1999 Ss. Cyril and Methodius, Bridget of Sweden, Catherine of Siena and Teresa Benedicta of the Cross as co-patrons.

A flag of Europe was introduced by the Council of Europe in 1955, originally intended as a &quot;symbol for the whole of Europe&quot;, 
but due to its adoption by the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1985, and hence by the European Union (EU) as the successor organisation of the EEC, the flag is now strongly associated with the European Union so that it no longer serves the function of representing &quot;Europe as a whole&quot; at least since the early 2000s. 
The flag has notably been used by pro-EU protestors in the colour revolutions of the 2000s, e.g., in Belarus in 2004 by the pro-EU faction in the Euromaidan riots in Ukraine in 2013, and by the pro-EU faction in the Brexit campaigns of 2016.

<text>Friezland is a village in the civil parish of Saddleworth in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It is situated four miles east of the town of Oldham.

Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Friezland lies between the village of Grasscroft and nearby town of Mossley. Friezland is situated on the banks of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, and has a church, a church hall and a primary school. 
It is also the original home of Friezland Brass Band . The band has now set up a base in neighbouring village Uppermill, Saddleworth.

Friezland railway station was opened in 1886 by the LNWR on its loop line from Diggle to Stalybridge. The station itself was situated in what is, in the present day, outside of Friezland&#x27;s boundaries and more closer to the centre of nearby Greenfield. It closed to passengers in 1917.

<doc id="1256038" wikidata="Q3824593" url="?curid=1256038" title="The Night Land">
<text>The Night Land is a horror and fantasy novel by English writer William Hope Hodgson, first published in 1912. As a work of fantasy it belongs to the Dying Earth subgenre. Hodgson also published a much shorter version of the novel, titled &quot;The Dream of X&quot; (1912).

==Publication history==
&quot;The Night Land&quot; was revived in paperback by Ballantine Books, which republished the work in two parts as the 49th and 50th volumes of its Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in July 1972. H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s essay &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot; describes the novel as &quot;one of the most potent pieces of macabre imagination ever written&quot;. Clark Ashton Smith wrote of it:

When the book was written, the nature of the energy source that powers stars was not known: Lord Kelvin had published calculations based on the hypothesis that the energy came from the gravitational collapse of the gas cloud that had formed the sun and found that this mechanism gave the Sun a lifetime of only a few tens of million of years. Starting from this premise, Hodgson wrote a novel describing a time, millions of years in the future, when the Sun has gone dark.

==Plot summary==

The beginning of the book establishes the framework in which a 17th-century gentleman, mourning the death of his beloved, Lady Mirdath, is given a vision of a far-distant future where their souls will be re-united, and sees the world of that time through the eyes of a future incarnation. The language and style used are intended to resemble those of the 17th century, though the prose has features characteristic of no particular period, such as an almost complete lack of dialogue or proper names. Ian Bell has suggested that John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667) was probably a partial inspiration for Hodgson&#x27;s novel, especially in view of the hellish visions of sombre intensity that mark both works, and the use of massive structures (the Temple of Pandemonium in Milton and the Last Redoubt in &quot;The Night Land&quot;).

The 17th-century framing becomes inconsequential as the story focuses on the future. The Sun has gone out and the Earth is lit only by the glow of residual vulcanism. The last few millions of the human race are gathered together in the Last Redoubt, a gigantic metal pyramid, nearly high, which is under siege from unknown forces and Powers outside in the dark. These are held back by a shield known as the &quot;air clog&quot;, powered from a subterranean energy source called the &quot;Earth Current&quot;. For thousands of years vast living shapes known as the Watchers have waited in the darkness near the pyramid. It is thought that they are waiting for the inevitable time when the Circle&#x27;s power finally weakens and dies. Other living things have been seen in the darkness, some of unknown origins, and others that may once have been human. Hodgson uses the term &quot;Abhuman&quot; to name several different species of intelligent beings evolved from humans who interbred with alien species or adapted to changed environmental conditions, and are seen as decayed or maligned by those living inside the Last Redoubt.

To leave the protection of the Circle means almost certain death, or, worse, destruction of the soul. The narrator establishes mind contact with an inhabitant of a forgotten Lesser Redoubt. First, one expedition sets off to succour the inhabitants of the Lesser Redoubt, whose own Earth Current has been exhausted, only to meet with disaster. After that the narrator sets off alone into the darkness to find the girl he has made contact with, knowing now that she is the reincarnation of his past love.

At the conclusion of the adventure the narrative does not return to the framework story, but ends with the homecoming of the couple and the narrator&#x27;s inauguration into the ranks of their most honoured heroes.

==The Dream of X==
The abridged version of the novel was first published in the United States in 1912 in chapbook form as &quot;Poems and a Dream of X&quot; (New York: R. H. Paget, 1912), in an extremely limited print run. In this edition, the 200,000-word novel was condensed to a 20,000-word novelette, originally for the purpose of establishing copyright; also included was a novelette entitled &quot;Mutiny&quot;, an abridged version of the story &quot;&#x27;Prentices&#x27; Mutiny&quot;, and thirteen of Hodgson&#x27;s poems, which were later included in his other posthumously published books of poetry. The abridgement by itself was republished in a limited edition in 1977, with an introduction by Sam Moskowitz and color illustrations by Stephen Fabian, under the title &quot;The Dream of X&quot; (West Kingston, R.I.: Donald M. Grant, 1977).

The 1943 science fiction novel &quot;Earth&#x27;s Last Citadel&quot;, by Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore, was influenced by &quot;The Night Land&quot;: both novels depict a future Earth with humanity confined to a fortress.

Greg Bear&#x27;s short story &quot;The Way of All Ghosts&quot;, dedicated to William Hope Hodgson, is set in the Way, the artificial space-time structure featured in several of Bear&#x27;s novels, beginning with &quot;Eon&quot; (1985). A recurring character from these novels, Ser Olmy, is given a mission to investigate an experiment which had gone horribly wrong. The experimenters had attempted to open a gate into a universe of pure order, and the survivors find themselves trapped in a region of the Way that has transformed to a chaotic state resembling the Night Land.

Another work of Greg Bear&#x27;s, &quot;City at the End of Time&quot; (2008), shares a number of plot elements with &quot;The Night Land&quot; and contains a specific reference to the Last Redoubt, giving William Hope Hodgson himself a cameo role in the story line.

The short-fiction collections &quot;William Hope Hodgson&#x27;s Night Lands: Eternal Love&quot; (2003) and &quot;William Hope Hodgson&#x27;s Night Lands: Nightmares of the Fall&quot; (2007) contain short stories set in a universe combining &quot;The Night Land&quot; with &quot;The House on the Borderland&quot;. A third collection (to be titled &quot;The Days of Darkening&quot;) was still in progress . The first collection was nominated for a British Fantasy Award for Best Anthology by the British Fantasy Society in 2004.

James Stoddard&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Night Land, A Story Retold&quot; (2011) is a retelling of &quot;The Night Land&quot;, intended for modern readers who may be unwilling to read the archaic language of the original. While retaining the story of &quot;The Night Land&quot;, it departs from the original by naming the main character, adding brief scenes, and using dialogue (the original version had none). An early draft of the second chapter of Stoddard&#x27;s rewrite appears in &quot;William Hope Hodgson&#x27;s Night Lands: Eternal Love&quot;.

&quot;Awake in the Night Land&quot; (2014) is a new collection of stories set in the world of Night Land written by John C. Wright, published by Castalia House.

A copious amount of fan fiction (as well as fan art and music) has also been collected on a &quot;Night Land&quot; website based in the UK.

<text>Louisa Gabriella Bobb (born 19 July 1969), known professionally as Gabrielle, is an English singer and songwriter. Born in Hackney, London, she released her debut single, &quot;Dreams&quot;, in 1993, and it topped the UK Singles Chart the same year. Her other singles include &quot;Going Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Give Me a Little More Time&quot;, &quot;Walk On By&quot;, and &quot;If You Ever&quot; – a duet with East 17.

After a few inactive years, Gabrielle made a comeback with &quot;Rise&quot;, which became her second UK number one, in 2000. Her album of the same name reached the top spot on the UK Albums Chart, where it stayed for three weeks. The song &quot;Out of Reach&quot;, from the soundtrack to &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;, reached number four on the UK Singles Chart. She released the compilation &quot;Dreams Can Come True, Greatest Hits Vol. 1&quot; in 2001.

==Early life==
Gabrielle was born on 19 July 1969 in London, as Louisa Gabriella Bobb to parents from Dominica. She and her three brothers were brought up by their mother, Patricia. Gabrielle credited her mother for her love of soul and reggae music.

Gabrielle has had ptosis, the drooping of one eyelid, since childhood: in public, she covers her eye with sunglasses, an eyepatch, a hat or hair. In school, she suffered from depression and was sometimes suicidal. After finishing her A-levels, she abandoned an idea to study law and began singing in nightclubs.

==Career==
===1993–1998: &quot;Find Your Way&quot; and &quot;Gabrielle&quot;===
Gabrielle&#x27;s real first name is Louisa, but she goes by a distorted version of her middle name, Gabriella. In an interview with Smooth Radio, she said: &quot;I actually always thought I was Louise Gabrielle. But I’m actually Louisa Gabriella. &#x27;Yes. Let’s call you Gabrielle. Let’s call you Gabrielle for now.&#x27; I was chuffed, because I didn’t have to make up a name. I was able to use my middle name. And that’s how it came about.&quot;

.In June 1993, Gabrielle released her debut single, &quot;Dreams&quot;, co-written by Gabrielle and Tim Laws and produced by Richie Fermie. In its earliest version, the song sampled the melody of Tracy Chapman&#x27;s 1988 hit &quot;Fast Car&quot;. This was later removed after copyright infringement. &quot;Dreams&quot; topped the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in June 1993 having entered the British charts at number 2, which was the highest chart entry a debut act had ever scored in the UK at that time. The song also peaked at number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the US and at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart. In Australia, the song made number two on the ARIA Chart. The second single &quot;Going Nowhere&quot; from the same album was written by Gabrielle and George McFarlane and produced by Pete Cragie. &quot;Going Nowhere&quot; reached number nine on the UK singles chart and number 18 ranking in Ireland. It was the second biggest hit from the album &quot;Find Your Way&quot;. In December 1993 Gabrielle released her third single from her debut album. &quot;I Wish&quot;, written by Gabrielle and Jon Douglas, it was not as successful as its predecessors, which both reached the UK top ten. &quot;I Wish&quot; charted at number 26 on the UK singles chart. &quot;Because of You&quot; was the fourth and final single from Gabrielle&#x27;s debut album Find Your Way. Written by Gabrielle, George McFarlane and Ray Saint John, &quot;Because of You&quot; peaked at number 24 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Find Your Way&quot; peaked at number nine on the UK Albums Chart.

Gabrielle released her self-titled second studio album in 1996, reaching number 11 in the UK Album Chart eventually going platinum. &quot;Gabrielle&quot; also reached number 80 on the MegaCharts in the Netherlands. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Give Me a Little More Time&quot;, returned Gabrielle to the UK top ten, peaking at five, spending ten weeks inside the UK top 20. The song also peaked at nine in Ireland. It is her fourth biggest selling single in the UK and has been certified silver. &quot;Forget About the World&quot; was released as the second single from the album. Written by Gabrielle, Wolff, Dean, Barson, who wrote previous single, &quot;Give Me a Little More Time&quot;, &quot;Forget About the World&quot; did not perform as well as its predecessor, peaking at 23 in UK. It was the lowest charting single from the album and the only single to miss the top 15. The third single &quot;If You Really Cared&quot; was written by Gabrielle, Wolff, Dean, Barson, who wrote previous single, &quot;Give Me a Little More Time&quot; and &quot;Forget About the World&quot;, &quot;If You Really Cared&quot; returned Gabrielle to the UK top 20 after the last single missed out. &quot;If You Really Cared&quot; peaked at 15 in the UK Singles Chart. Shai&#x27;s &quot;If I Ever Fall in Love&quot; was covered in 1996 as a duet by East 17 and Gabrielle, and renamed &quot;If You Ever&quot;. It reached number two in the UK and four in Latvia. It was also one of only three songs by Gabrielle to reach the Top 20 in Australia, peaking at 16. It was the highest-charting single from both aforementioned albums. The song was also the 11th biggest selling boyband single of the 1990s in the UK selling 510,000 copies and has received a Gold sales status certification. In 1997, UK singer Gabrielle released her version of &quot;Walk On By&quot; as the fifth and final single from her album. It reached number seven in the UK.

===1999–2001: &quot;Rise&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===
Gabrielle began recording her third studio album &quot;Rise&quot; in 1998 through 1999. &quot;Rise&quot; was released on 18 October 1999 in the United Kingdom, and 15 August 2000 in the United States. The album became Gabrielle&#x27;s biggest selling album to date with it becoming her only number one album. The album became a huge commercial success, spending three weeks at number one in the UK Albums Chart, and achieving 4× Platinum status. &quot;Sunshine&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single and peaked at number nine in the UK giving her her sixth UK top ten hit. &quot;Rise&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single. It was her second number one single in the UK (and thus far, last). Written by Gabrielle, Ollie Dagois, Ferdy Unger-Hamilton and Bob Dylan, and produced by Johnny Dollar, the song used a sample from Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;. The song reached number one on the UK singles chart for two weeks in January 2000. The song has sold 460,000 copies in the UK as stated by the Official UK Charts Company making the song one of the 14th best selling of 2000 in the UK. The album of the same name also reached the top spot in the UK Albums Chart, where it stayed for three weeks. It spent 87 weeks in the charts.
&quot;When a Woman&quot; was released as the third single from &quot;Rise&quot; in June 2000. The song reached number six on the UK Singles Chart and was the second-highest-charting single from the album. It became Gabrielle&#x27;s eighth top ten hit. &quot;Should I Stay&quot; was released as a single in 2000 and was the fourth and final single released from the &quot;Rise&quot; album. The song charted at 13 in the UK Singles Chart, the fourth top 15 hit from the album. The video for the single is very moody and depicts the atmosphere of the song more so than having a linear storyline. The song samples part of the BBC News theme. In 2004, it was used in the second episode of the BBC drama serial &quot;Blackpool&quot;.

Gabrielle released her first greatest hits collection on 12 November 2001, entitled &quot;Dreams Can Come True, Greatest Hits Vol. 1&quot;. The album achieved success in the UK where it was certified as a four times platinum seller and became the fifth best selling album of 2001. It was also the 76th biggest selling album of that Decade in the UK. The lead single from the greatest hits album was &quot;Out of Reach&quot; which was also from the soundtrack to the film &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;. The song reached number four in the UK and nine in Australia, making it her second biggest hit in the country and also the 37th highest selling single of 2001. It remained on the chart there for more than 20 weeks. In New Zealand, the song was the tenth most successful single of 2001. The song has sold 320,000 copies in the UK as stated by the Official UK Charts Company. The second and final single from the album was &quot;Don&#x27;t Need the Sun to Shine (To Make Me Smile)&quot;. The single managed to peak at number nine in the UK Singles Chart, the song was also her eighth consecutive top 15 hit in the UK and her tenth top ten hit.

An arena tour of the United Kingdom followed in June 2002.

===2004–2009: &quot;Play to Win&quot;, &quot;Always&quot; and touring===
Gabrielle once again teamed with frequent collaborators Jonathan Shorten and trio Julian Gallagher, Richard Stannard, and Ferdy Unger-Hamilton to work on her fourth studio album &quot;Play to Win&quot;. Released in May 2004, it reached number ten on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Elsewhere however, the album failed to chart noticeably. &quot;Stay the Same,&quot; &quot;Play to Win&quot;″s lead single, peaked at number 20 on the UK Singles Chart but became Gabrielle&#x27;s lowest-charting single in eight years, albeit her tenth consecutive top twenty hit. Second and final single &quot;Ten Years Time&quot; missed the top 40. In support of the album, a UK concert tour followed.

In October 2007, Gabrielle&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Always&quot; was released. While the album received positive reviews from music critics, its preceding single &quot;Why,&quot; a duet with Paul Weller, failed to enter the top forty. Similarly, &quot;Always&quot; missed the top ten, peaking at number eleven on UK Albums Chart, and entered the UK R&amp;B Album Chart at number 4. The final single from the album, &quot;Every Little Teardrop&quot; was released; however, it failed to chart. The same year, Gabrielle set off on a sell out UK tour of 14 dates which earned positive reviews on her performances. In mid-2008, she headlined the Zermatt Unplugged music festival along with Alanis Morissette, as well as the Birmingham Pride. In addition, Gabrielle won an Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Collection. and was also Al Green&#x27;s special guest on the UK dates of his 2008 tour.

=== 2010–2020: &quot;Now and Always: 20 Years of Dreaming,&quot; and &quot;Under My Skin&quot;===
Following a lengthy break, in November 2013, Gabrielle released the album &quot;Now and Always: 20 Years of Dreaming&quot;. Consisting of 34 tracks, including most of her singles, a number of album tracks, remixes from her remix album &quot;Rise Underground&quot;, and seven brand new tracks, the compilation was produced through Island Records to coincide with the release of her debut single, &quot;Dreams&quot;, 20 years ago. The singer worked with several new collaborators on the new material on the album, including producers Naughty Boy and Syience as well as songwriter Emeli Sandé. In support of the album, a remix version of &quot;Dreams&quot; featuring Naughty Boy was released, while &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; served as the album&#x27;s only single. A minor success, &quot;Now and Always: 20 Years of Dreaming&quot; peaked at number 38 on the UK Albums Chart. A headline UK tour promoting the album, entitled The 20 Years of Dreaming Tour, took place March 2014.

Gabrielle released &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, her sixth studio album, worldwide on 17 August 2018. Her first studio album in 11 years, it marked her first full-length release through BMG Rights Management. The release of &quot;Under My Skin&quot; marked 25 years since the release of her debut single, &quot;Dreams&quot;. Its release was preceded by lead single &quot;Show Me&quot;.

===2021-present: &quot;Do It Again&quot; and &quot;A Place in Your Heart&quot;===
In 2021, she participated in the second series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Harlequin&quot; and finished in fourth place. She then announced the release of her seventh studio album &quot;Do It Again&quot; for 5 March. Later that year Gabrielle appeared in Stormzy&#x27;s music video for &quot;Mel Made Me Do It&quot;.

Gabrielle&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;A Place in Your Heart&quot;, was released in May 2024.

==Artistry==
Gabrielle&#x27;s first two studio albums were inspired by &quot;classic soul connotations&quot; such as Marvin Gaye, Barry White and Bobby Womack. However, the albums also contained influence &quot;by early-&#x27;80s British pop&quot; Soul II Soul, Lisa Stansfield and Mantronix. Gabrielle&#x27;s third album Rise spoke of &quot;optimism, romanticism, devotion, and a keen survival instinct&quot;. &quot;Play to Win&quot; incorporated a mix of genres. Gabrielle spoke about the album&#x27;s influences saying &quot;There&#x27;s also a couple of songs which lean more to Country, so there will be a couple of surprises for them.&quot; She also talked about the genres on the album, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with Country. Yeah, I&#x27;m a black woman, but I&#x27;d like to think that I can just sing &#x27;songs&#x27;. This album is diverse but people buying my music can expect diverse music; it&#x27;s about love, life and optimism.&quot;

Gabrielle cited her high school teacher as one influence, saying that she was &quot;inspired the moment her teacher asked her to construct her first poem. Her poetry began to develop into songs, and then she began to sing.&quot; Other inspirations came through in an eclectic collection of 1980s pop: Madonna, Culture Club, Haircut One Hundred, Duran Duran, Adam and the Ants and Wham!. &quot;You know, it was all pop, and at the same time I was a huge Michael Jackson fan, so I had a big picture of him, you know, when he looked really beautiful, and he was dark chocolate and you just wanted to lick him, although they were innocent thoughts those days, when I was younger.&quot;

==Personal life==
Gabrielle has a son, born in 1995, and a daughter, born in 2003. 

From 1992 to 1995, Gabrielle was in a relationship with Tony Antoniou, with whom she had her son. In 1995, Antoniou was arrested, and later convicted, for the murder of his stepfather; Antoniou killed Walter McCarthy, decapitated him and then dumped his body. Gabrielle was cleared of any involvement at all by police; in a 1999 interview, she shared, &quot;When it first came out, there was no association with me,&#x27; she remembers. &#x27;But once the press got wind of it and there was the major thing of me being questioned, my whole world just came in on me [...] It was made out that I went on the stand and said he didn&#x27;t do it. I mean, the man confessed. But it was almost like I&#x27;d been (adopts whining voice) &#x27;He couldn&#x27;t possibly have done it&quot;.

<text>Carl Drega (January 19, 1935 – August 19, 1997) was an American spree killer who killed four people in Colebrook, New Hampshire, on August 19, 1997.

Drega had several long-term disputes with town and state government officials over his property in Columbia since the early 1980s. Drega shot and killed two New Hampshire state troopers, a judge and a newspaper editor in Colebrook. He also wounded four law enforcement officers before being shot to death in a gunfight with police in Bloomfield, Vermont.

==Background==

Carl Drega was born on January 19, 1935, in New Haven, Connecticut, to Polish immigrants. He claimed to have served in the U.S. military during the Korean War. Drega later worked in construction and lived in Manchester, New Hampshire, later moving into a home in Bow, New Hampshire, he built for himself and his wife Rita from 1969 to 1970. However, Rita was diagnosed with cancer the following year and died in 1972.

Drega had a long history of conflict with government officials over code enforcement issues, starting in the 1970s over whether he could use tar paper to side his vacation house in Columbia, New Hampshire, on the banks of the Connecticut River. He claimed that, in 1981, a rainstorm caused of the riverbank to collapse. Drega decided to dump and pack enough dirt to repair the erosion damage, saying this would restore his lot to its original size. State officials, on the other hand, contested that Drega was trying to change the course of the river. In 1995, the town selectman Vickie Bunnell accompanied a town tax assessor to Drega&#x27;s property in a dispute over an assessment. Drega fired shots into the air to drive them away. Drega bought a Colt AR-15 rifle and armored vest, and began equipping his property with early-warning electronic noise and motion detectors.

==Shooting==

On August 19, 1997, at about 2:30 p.m., New Hampshire state trooper Scott Phillips stopped Drega in the parking lot of LaPerle&#x27;s IGA supermarket in neighboring Colebrook for having too much rust on his pickup truck. Drega got out of his truck with his rifle and fired upon Trooper Phillips, who was hit but returned fire before retreating into a nearby field. Drega followed Phillips into the field and murdered him.

Trooper Leslie Lord pulled into the LaPerle&#x27;s parking lot moments later, and from approximately 150 feet (45 m) away, Drega shot and killed Lord before he could get out of his police car. Drega then stole Phillips&#x27; police car, and drove to the office of Colebrook District Court judge Vickie Bunnell. Bunnell reportedly carried a handgun in her purse out of fear of Drega, but may not have had it with her that day. Seeing Drega approaching the building with his rifle, she warned fellow staffers to evacuate as she ran for an exit. Drega shot Bunnell in the back from a range of about , killing her. Dennis Joos, editor of the local &quot;Colebrook News and Sentinel&quot;, attempted to disarm Drega after Bunnell fell. During the struggle Drega shot and killed Joos.

Drega returned to his property and set his house on fire. New Hampshire Fish &amp; Game Warden Wayne Saunders observed Drega driving the state police car. Drega turned and crossed the state line to Bloomfield, Vermont, exited the police car and fired upon Saunders. Saunders was hit with several bullets through his vehicle in his arm and shoulder, including one that struck his badge, saving him from a likely fatal wound. Saunders retreated under the hail of fire by driving in reverse, and crashing into the Connecticut River.

Drega set up his last stand on a dead end road on the Vermont side of the river. Police from numerous state, local and federal agencies descended upon Drega&#x27;s position. Drega sprang his ambush, shooting NH state trooper Jeffrey Caulder in the lower abdomen, NH state trooper Robert Haase in the foot, and U.S. Border Patrol agent John Pfeifer in the chest.

After the gunfire died down, agents moved a police vehicle to the scene in an attempt to evacuate Pfeifer before he bled to death. But once the vehicle approached, Drega began firing again, forcing the officers to take cover. Eventually, NH state trooper Charles West and Border Patrol agent Stephen Brooks advanced up a slope to Drega&#x27;s position. As Drega stepped out from behind a tree to fire, Brooks opened up with his M14 rifle while West fired a slug from his Remington 870 shotgun, killing Drega and ending the gunfight. Agent Pfeifer recovered from his wounds and went on to continue his career in the Border Patrol for more than 20 years.

==Memorials==

U.S. Route 3 between Pittsburg and Colebrook is named the Trooper Leslie G. Lord Highway and from Colebrook to North Stratford the Trooper Scott E. Phillips Highway. The Vickie Bunnell Preserve surrounds Bunnell Mountain (formerly Blue Mountain) in Columbia. A memorial stone to the four murder victims was erected by the town of Colebrook near the &quot;News and Sentinel&quot; building. Below their names is the inscription, &quot;Their Deeds Are Their Memorials&quot;.

==Career==
After a brief appearance in the 1971 film &quot;Klute&quot;, and small roles in TV series such as &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, and &quot;Cannon&quot;, Dobson signed a contract with Universal Studios in 1972. It led to his role of Det. Bobby Crocker, Lt. Theo Kojak&#x27;s young partner, in the TV series &quot;Kojak&quot;, opposite Telly Savalas. For the role, he had to borrow a suit. He had twice auditioned and failed, then called his agent, telling him, &quot;&#x27;Do what you have to do,&#x27; so he called in a favor and I read for them [again]. I was a military policeman in the Army, so I knew how to hold a gun and throw somebody against a wall. I got a call [the next night] asking if I&#x27;d sign a contract.&quot; Dobson auditioned for a third time and finally won the role. He remained with &quot;Kojak&quot; for its entire five-season run from 1973 to 1978, and later reunited with Savalas for the 1990 TV movie, &quot;Kojak: It&#x27;s Always Something&quot;, his character having become an assistant district attorney. They remained friends until Savalas&#x27;s death from bladder cancer in 1994.

In 1976, Dobson was on &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot; with Savalas (Captain), Adrienne Barbeau, Gary Burghoff, Pat Harrington, Bill Macy, Lee Meriwether, Mackenzie Phillips, Loretta Swit, and Jimmie Walker. In 1978, Dobson played Pete Lomas in the two-part TV movie &quot;The Immigrants&quot;, based on the novel by Howard Fast. 

In 1981, Dobson starred as Det. Jack Shannon, a San Francisco police officer who is a single father, on the CBS series &quot;Shannon&quot;. However, the show failed to gain substantial ratings and was cancelled after nine episodes. A more successful TV role for Dobson followed in 1982 as M. Patrick &quot;Mack&quot; MacKenzie in the prime-time soap opera &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, opposite Michele Lee. He joined the show at the beginning of its fourth season in September 1982 and remained in the role until its cancellation in 1993. Dobson won five Soap Opera Digest Awards for his work on the series. He later reunited with his &quot;Knots Landing&quot; co-stars for a miniseries, &quot;Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac&quot; in 1997, and again in the 2005 non-fiction special &quot;Knots Landing Reunion: Together Again&quot;.

Dobson also appeared in a number of feature films, most notably the World War II movie &quot;Midway&quot; (1976) alongside Henry Fonda and Charlton Heston, as Ensign George Gay — a pilot and the sole survivor of Torpedo Squadron Eight from the Aircraft Carrier &#x27;s ill-fated opening attack against the Japanese fleet on June 4, 1942. Another prominent role was as Bobby Gibbons, the husband of Cheryl Gibbons (Barbra Streisand) in the 1981 romantic comedy &quot;All Night Long&quot;. He also had a small role as a priest in the well-received 2007 psychological horror film &quot;1408&quot;.

Dobson continued to appear in a number of television roles, including the syndicated &quot;F/X: The Series&quot; for one season (1996–1997) and the daytime drama series &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (2003), &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; (2006–2007), and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, where he was the fourth and final actor to play original character Mickey Horton. He featured in 15 episodes of the show from April to October 2008. The character then left with no explanation, before being &quot;killed off&quot; in January 2010. Although Mickey is best remembered for being portrayed by veteran soap actor John Clarke for almost 40 years, Dobson instead appeared as Mickey in the character&#x27;s final appearances in 2008.

===Stage roles===
Dobson starred in the Tony Award winning play &quot;&#x27;Art&#x27;&quot; at the Royal George Theater in Chicago. He originated the role of Steve Gallop in the world premiere of the American Theatre Critics Association nominated stage play &quot;If it was Easy...&quot; at The 7Stages Theater in Atlanta, Georgia, and appeared in many other stage roles across the United States.

He starred with Richard Thomas in the 2009 stage production of &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;. Dobson stated, concerning actors who are afraid of being typecast, &quot;You should be so lucky.&quot;

===Affiliations===
Dobson, a former Army soldier (MP), served twice as chairman of the National Salute To Hospitalized Veterans. Having long assisted with the needs of hospitalized veterans, Dobson received the AMVETS (American Veterans) Silver Helmet Peace Award and the American Legion Award. Dobson, was a life member of AMVETS and also a charter member of AMVETS MOH Richard A. Pittman Post #1947 - Stockton, California.

==Personal life and death==
Dobson married his wife, Susan, in 1968. They had three children: Mariah, Patrick and Sean. He was the chairman of the United Veterans Council of San Joaquin County (UVCSJC). Dobson died after struggling with an autoimmune deficiency on September 6, 2020, in Stockton, California. UVCSJC reported his death the following day. He was 77.

<text>Grimeton Radio Station () in southern Sweden, close to Varberg in Halland, is an early longwave transatlantic wireless telegraphy station built in 1922–1924, that has been preserved as a historical site. From the 1920s through the 1940s it was used to transmit telegram traffic by Morse code to North America and other countries, and during World War II was Sweden&#x27;s only telecommunication link with the rest of the world. It is the only remaining example of an early pre-electronic radio transmitter technology called an Alexanderson alternator. It was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2004, with the statement: &quot;Grimeton Radio Station, Varberg is an exceptionally well preserved example of a type of telecommunication centre, representing the technological achievements by the early 1920s, as well as documenting the further development over some three decades.&quot; The radio station is also an anchor site for the European Route of Industrial Heritage. The transmitter is still in operational condition, and each year on a day called Alexanderson Day is started up and transmits brief Morse code test transmissions, which can be received all over Europe.

==History==
Beginning around 1910 industrial countries built networks of powerful transoceanic longwave radiotelegraphy stations to communicate telegraphically with other countries. During the First World War radio became a strategic technology when it was realized that a nation without long-distance radio capability could be isolated from the rest of the world by an enemy cutting its submarine telegraph cables. Sweden&#x27;s geographical dependence on other countries&#x27; underwater cable networks, and the temporary loss of those vital connections during the war, motivated a decision in 1920 by the Swedish Parliament that the Royal Telegraph Agency build a &quot;big radiotelegraphy station&quot; in Sweden to transmit telegram traffic across the Atlantic.

At the time, there were several different technologies used for high power radio transmission, each owned by a different giant industrial company. Bids were requested from Telefunken in Berlin, The Marconi Company in London, Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in New York and Société Française Radio-Electrique in Paris. The transmitter chosen was the 200 kW version of the Alexanderson alternator, invented by Swedish-American Ernst Alexanderson, manufactured by General Electric and marketed by their subsidiary RCA. This consisted of a huge rotating electromechanical AC generator (alternator) turned by an electric motor at a fast enough speed that it generated radio frequency alternating current, which was applied to the antenna. It was one of the first transmitters to generate sinusoidal continuous waves, which could communicate at longer range than the damped waves which were used by the earlier spark gap transmitters. The alternator was chosen because it was already used in most other transatlantic radio stations, reducing potential compatibility problems. The fact that it was designed by a Swede may have also played a part. 

After careful calculations, the station was located in Grimeton, on the southwest coast of Sweden nearest North America, which allowed good radio wave propagation conditions over the North Atlantic to America, and also Norway, Denmark, and Scotland. The site was purchased in autumn 1922, construction began by the end of the year, and the station was finished in 1924. Two 200 kilowatt Alexanderson alternators were installed, to allow maintenance to be performed on one without interrupting radio traffic. To achieve daytime communication over such long distances, transoceanic stations took advantage of an earth-ionosphere waveguide mechanism which required them to transmit at frequencies in the very low frequency (VLF) range below 30 kHz. Radio transmitters required extremely large antennas to radiate these long waves efficiently. The Grimeton station had a huge multiply-tuned flattop antenna 1.9 km (1.2 miles) long consisting of twelve (later reduced to eight) wires supported on six 127 m (380 foot) high steel towers, fed at one end by vertical feeder wires extending up from the transmitter building. The station started operation in 1924, transmitting radiotelegraphy traffic with the callsign SAQ on a wavelength of about , later changed to , to RCA&#x27;s Radio Central receivers on Long Island, New York. It immediately took over 95% of the Swedish telegram traffic to the United States. 

The Alexanderson alternator technology was becoming obsolete even as it was installed. Vacuum tube electronic oscillator transmitters, which used the triode vacuum tube invented by Lee De Forest in 1907, replaced most pre-electronic transmitters in the early 1920s. However the large capital investment in an alternator transmitter caused owners to keep these huge behemoths in use long after they were technologically obsolete. By the mid-1930s most transatlantic communication had switched to short waves, and, beginning in 1938, vacuum tube shortwave transmitters were installed in the main building, using dipole and rhombic antennas in a neighbouring field. The Alexanderson alternator found a second use as a naval transmitter to communicate with submarines, as VLF frequencies can penetrate a short distance into seawater.

During the Second World War 1939–1945, the station experienced a heyday, when it was one of Scandinavia&#x27;s gateways to the outside world. Underwater communication cable connections had once again been quickly severed by nations at war and the radiotelegraphy transmissions were a link to the outside world. Several new transmitters were therefore added to the station. As users during the war included the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs and various embassies and legations, the radio station’s transmissions were subject to interception by signals intelligence operations such as the British Y service.

Following the war, additional transmitters were installed and the number of destinations increased, reaching a peak in the 1950s when the station operated twelve shortwave transmitters and one electronic longwave transmitter (as well as the original Alexanderson system), maintaining traffic to some twenty different countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas. By that point, the telegraphic transmissions had shifted from Morse code to radioteletype and the station also provided radiofax and radiotelephony services.

By the 1960s, many of the transmitters were beginning show their age and were subsequently decommissioned, being replaced by more modern equipment. However, rather than refitting the original station building, a new facility was built in 1966 to house the new transmitters, a move which allowed for the preservation of the older equipment. Several new antennas were also erected in the mid-to-late 1960s, but these investments were relatively short-lived in their original context as they coincided with the move away from using fixed radio stations for international communications in favour of satellites and new types of cables. Instead, focus would eventually shift to long-range maritime radio.

Out of the original system, one of the alternator transmitters had been gradually dismantled and scrapped in the 1950s to free up space in the station building. The remaining alternator continued to be used for naval transmissions until the early 1990s, when a modern solid-state LF transmitter replaced it.

Grimeton Radio Station is now the only station left in the transatlantic network of nine long wave stations that were built during the years 1918–1924, all equipped with Alexanderson alternators. In 2004 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The Grimeton transmitter is the last surviving example of an Alexanderson alternator, the only radio station left from the pre-vacuum tube era, and is still in working condition. Each year, on a day called Alexanderson Day, either on the last Sunday in June, or on the first Sunday in July, whichever comes closer to 2 July, the site holds an open house during which the transmitter is started up and transmits test messages on 17.2 kHz using its call sign SAQ, which can be received all over Europe.

== Technical description ==


The electromechanical transmitter in Grimeton transmitted at a frequency of 17.2 kHz, i.e. in the VLF range, and was thus able to reach America.

In principle, an electric generator (A) is used for this purpose. This is set in rotation by a motor (500 HP, 711.3 rpm) via a gearbox (setup ratio: 2.97) and thus generates a continuous sinusoidal AC voltage (B) of 17.2 kHz or 17,200 Hz. 

For comparison, generators of the public electricity networks produce an alternating voltage of 50 or 60 Hz, depending on the country. To produce such high frequencies with a generator, a fast-rotating generator (2115 revolutions per minute) with a special design is necessary. 

In Grimeton, mainly Morse signals were transmitted. To send information with the generated alternating voltage, the texts to be sent are translated into a sequence of short and long pulses according to the Morse code by means of a Morse key (D). The switchgear (C) uses these pulses to control the transmission of the AC voltage to the antenna (F). When the key is pressed, the AC voltage is passed on to the antenna and transmitted from there. If the key is not pressed, the AC voltage is suppressed by the switchgear and no signal is transmitted. Thus, for example, as shown in (E), the letter A can be transmitted by a short and a long wave packet and detected at the receiver. 

The AC voltage generated has a voltage of 2000 volts and a power of 200 kW (although these days it is usually limited to about 80 kW). Such strong signals cannot be switched on and off by a simple switch, it would cause considerable sparking. In Grimeton, a different effect was used for this purpose.

As known from historical radios, the antenna and the adjacent coils and capacitors form an resonant circuit, which must be tuned to the desired frequency so that the energy is optimally transmitted. In Grimeton, the tuning of this oscillating circuit is now disturbed in the switchgear (C) when the Morse key is not pressed, thus suppressing transmission. Thus it is possible to influence an AC power of 200kW with a small power (3 kW DC).


The antenna resonant circuit essentially consists of the antenna (I), a transformer (D) and a magnetic amplifier (G). 

As usual in electric generators, an alternating voltage is generated in adjacent coils (B) in the generator (A) by means of rotating magnetic fields. In Grimeton, these coils are mounted on the stator, divided into 2x32 sectors, on both sides to the rotor. The individual windings of a sector are connected to corresponding primary windings (C) of the transformer (D). When the primary voltages are transmitted to the secondary winding (E) of the transformer, these voltages are superimposed to form a strong, sinusoidal output signal which is output to the antenna and transmitted.

The control winding (F) and the magnetic amplifier (G) are responsible for controlling the transmission process by the Morse key (H). The magnetic amplifier is an arrangement of coils and capacitors whose AC resistance is indirectly influenced by the Morse key and a DC source. When the Morse key is open, the solenoid amplifier short-circuits the control winding (F), to put it simply. The short-circuiting of (F) disturbs the transmitting oscillating circuit, so that finally no more than 9 % of the normal antenna current flows [2, page 53]. The situation described above (full transmit or no transmit at all) can therefore only be achieved approximately, but this is sufficient in practice.

In order to achieve the necessary transmission frequency, the generator of the Alexanderson alternator type must not only rotate quickly, but it also needs a special construction with many magnetic poles. For this purpose, the steel, and thus magnetizable rotor disk (A) is provided at the edge with 488 slots (B), which are filled with a non-magnetic material. By means of the coils (D), a continuous magnetic field (E) is generated in the stator by means of direct current, in which the coils (C) are also located. Due to the rotating rotor disk, this magnetic field between the coils (C) is alternately reinforced by the steel disk and the non-magnetic slots are damped. This cyclically changing magnetic field induces a sinusoidal voltage in the coils (C).

The above sketch is not to scale, the air gap between rotor and stator frame is only 1mm wide. The rotor is a steel disc measuring 1.6 m in diameter and approximately 7.5 cm thick at the periphery.

==Antenna system==
To achieve maximum range, like other transoceanic radiotelegraphy stations of this era it transmitted in the VLF band, at a frequency of 17.2 kilohertz and so the wavelength is approximately 17442 meters. Even though the antenna is approximately 2 km long, it is short compared with the wavelength and so it is not very efficient. 

The antenna system consists of antenna wires supported by masts, such as those used for high-voltage power lines. The six antenna masts each have a 46m cross-arm at the top and are 127m high. Today they carry 8 antenna conductors although originally there were 12. 

The multiple-tuned antenna used at Grimeton is a pre-WW1 invention by E F W Alexanderson, which uses a number of vertical radiator wires interconnected by the flat-top wires, which serve both as top capacitance and as a high-voltage transmission line.

Each vertical wire is terminated in a ground-mounted tuning inductance (or &quot;coil&quot;) which serves to tune out the capacitive reactance of the wire, and to establish the proper phase relationship between the currents in the wires.

By dividing the total current flowing into the ground or counterpoise system between several connection points, the equivalent ground loss resistance may be substantially reduced compared to the case when all current is fed into a single vertical radiator.

This increases the antenna efficiency by about an order of magnitude.

<text>The IBM 3850 Mass Storage System (MSS) was an online tape library used to hold large amounts of infrequently accessed data. It was one of the earliest examples of nearline storage.

== History ==

Starting in the late-1960s IBM&#x27;s lab in Boulder, Colorado began development of a low-cost mass storage system based on magnetic tape cartridges. The tapes would be accessed automatically by a robot (known as an &quot;accessor&quot;) and fed into a reader/writer unit that could work on several tapes at the same time. Originally the system was going to be used as a directly attached memory device, but as the speed of computers grew in relation to the storage, the product was re-purposed as an automated system that would offload little-used data from hard disk systems. Known internally as &quot;Comanche&quot; while under development, IBM management found a number of niche uses for the concept, and announced it officially as the IBM 3850 on October 9, 1974. After more than a decade (comparable to the IBM 2321 Data Cell, 1964–1975), it was withdrawn August 5, 1986.

== Description ==
The Mass Storage System consisted of a library of cylindrical plastic cartridges, two inches wide and long, each holding a spool of tape long storing 50 MB; each virtual disk required a pair of cartridges. These cartridges were held in a hexagonal array of bins in the IBM 3851 Mass Storage Facility. New cartridges were rolled into the facility and were automatically stored in a vacant bin. The data were accessed via virtual IBM 3330 disk drives, and physically cached on a combination of 3330 and 3350 &quot;staging drives&quot;, the data being transferred automatically between cartridge and disk drive in processes called &quot;staging&quot; and &quot;destaging&quot;. These were all connected together with the IBM 3830 Storage Control (also used for disk storage alone), the entire system making up a 3850 unit.

Cartridges were moved into and out of read stations by two motorized accessor arms, electrically connected via flat cable on a drum. Stage time for data from cartridge to disk was typically 15 seconds, including about two seconds to move the cartridge into a read station, and eight to ten seconds to read the 200-foot tape.

The recording method was unusual for its time. The drive pulled the tape from the cartridge and wound it once around a cylindrical mandrel in a helix, then stopped the tape. The drive&#x27;s head, mounted on a rotating drum, then rotated once to read or record a diagonal track. The drive then wound the tape a small step forward and the head rotated to do the next track. Depending on technical definitions this might be even considered a first example of a digital helical scan recording, long before Exabyte&#x27;s helical drive (which was based on analog video helical recording systems developed earlier).

When free disk space was required a group of cylinders were selected to be destaged to tape, these were transferred with minimal or no change of format. Each tape could store 202 cylinder images of 19 tracks each, half of the 404 cylinders in a 3330 disk pack. Cylinder locations on the tape were fixed and identified by markers along the edge.

== Models ==

Several models of the 3851 were available. The smallest A1 holding 706 cartridges storing 35.3GB, while the largest A4 held 4,720 cartridges storing 236GB in a long unit. All of the units were also available in the &quot;B models&quot; which added a second controller for on-line backups, as well as offline storage. A second series was released on March 6, 1980, doubling maximum capacity to 472GB. The entire series was discontinued on August 5, 1986.

<text>The casual subculture is a subset of football culture that is characterised by the wearing of expensive designer clothing and hooliganism. Many participants dislike the term &#x27;casuals&#x27;, preferring the term ‘dresser’, with regional variations including Perry boys, trendies, and scallies.

The subculture emerged in the United Kingdom during the late 1970s, as a significant number of young men attending football matches began wearing clothing produced by designer sportswear brands, including Burberry, Fred Perry, Sergio Tacchini, Lacoste, Fila, Lyle &amp; Scott, and Ellesse. In the 1980s, casuals also began to wear other Italian brands including Stone Island and C.P. Company.

Casuals have been portrayed in films and television programmes such as &quot;ID&quot;, &quot;The Firm&quot;, &quot;The Football Factory&quot;, and &quot;Green Street&quot;. The documentary &quot;Casuals: The Story of the Legendary Terrace Fashion&quot; featuring Pat Nevin, Peter Hooton and Gary Bushell amongst others is about the fashion that started in the late 70s and into the 1980s.

==History==

The designer clothing and fashion aspect of the casual subculture began in the mid-to-late 1970s. One well documented precursor was the trend of Liverpool youths starting to dress differently from other football fans – in Peter Storm jackets, straight-leg jeans and Adidas trainers. Liverpool F.C. fans were the first British football fans to wear continental European fashions, which they picked up while following their teams at matches in Europe during their run of strong performance in the UEFA Cup and European Cup in the 1970s and 80s.

The other documented precursor, according to Colin Blaney, was a subculture known as &quot;Perry Boys&quot;, which originated in the mid-1970s as a precursor to the casuals. The Perry Boys subculture consisted of Manchester football hooligans styling their hair into a flick and wearing sportswear, Fred Perry shirts and Dunlop Green Flash trainers.

<text>Kimberly Quinn (formerly Fortier; &quot;née&quot; Solomon; born 1961) is an American journalist, commentator and magazine publisher and writer; latterly the publisher of British conservative news magazine &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

==Early life==
A native of Los Angeles, California, she is one of two daughters of businessman Marvin Solomon and actress Lugene Sanders. She is of Jewish heritage. She majored in Victorian Studies at Vassar College.

==Professional career==
She has written for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot; and UK newspapers &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, and &quot;The Independent&quot;. She was the Communications and marketing director for Condé Nast Publications in the UK. She took her position at &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1996. On 24 November 2006, Kimberly Quinn resigned from her post at &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

She has written a series of time travel adventures for young adults; the Chronicles of the Tempus series. The first work, &quot;The Queen Must Die&quot; (2010) was followed by &quot;The Queen at War&quot; (2013).

==Personal life==
In 1987, Quinn married American investment banker Michael Fortier; the couple divorced in 2000, following revelations of her affair with Stephen Quinn, publisher of &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;GQ&quot; magazines. In 2001, she married Quinn; during this marriage, she had an affair with David Blunkett, Home Secretary in Tony Blair&#x27;s ministry. Quinn&#x27;s three-year affair with David Blunkett ended acrimoniously in mid-2004. The affair was revealed by the &quot;News of the World&quot; in August 2004, according to the prosecution in the &quot;R v Brooks, Coulson and six others&quot; trial in October 2013, after the newspaper had intercepted voicemails.

During that period, Quinn gave birth to one son and became pregnant with a second child. The paternity of the two children became a matter of dispute. Blunkett&#x27;s paternity of Quinn&#x27;s elder child, William, was confirmed by DNA tests. Following the end of the affair between Quinn and Blunkett, moves by him to gain informal access to the first child were rejected by Quinn, and in early December 2004 Blunkett petitioned the Family Division of the High Court to grant him legal access. Controversy around a number of matters arising from the affair, particularly concerns over the handling of the visa of Quinn&#x27;s nanny, contributed to Blunkett&#x27;s resignation in mid-December 2004. Shortly after Blunkett&#x27;s resignation, it was revealed by the &quot;News of the World&quot; that Quinn had also had an affair with Simon Hoggart, a political journalist and regular contributor to &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

In February 2005, Quinn gave birth to a second son, Lorcan Quinn. A month later, Blunkett announced that DNA tests had revealed he was not the father of Quinn&#x27;s second child. Blunkett has said that Quinn&#x27;s elder son attended a Jewish nursery.

<text>Alexanderson Day is the day of the open house at the Swedish government&#x27;s VLF transmitter Grimeton, call sign SAQ, located near Varberg. Named after the Swedish radio engineer Ernst Fredrik Werner Alexanderson, it is held either on the last Sunday in June, or on the first Sunday in July, whichever comes closer to 2 July. On Alexanderson Day, Christmas Eve, and at other times during the year, the only workable Alexanderson alternator transmitter in the world is used to transmit short Morse messages on 17.2 kHz, which should be easily receivable in all of Europe. The transmitter is preserved as a historical remnant of early radio technology and as an example of VLF (Very Low Frequency) equipment.

These transmissions cannot be received by ordinary radios because of their low frequency. Modern enthusiasts often monitor the transmissions using a PC with a coil connected to the soundcard input and FFT analysis software, or a short-wave receiver with an upconverter, or any of several receivers designed to receive VLF transmissions directly. In recent years, Software-defined radio receivers have proven to be very useful and effective in receiving transmissions from SAQ around the world.

<text>Command Prompt, also known as cmd.exe or cmd, is the default command-line interpreter for the OS/2, eComStation, ArcaOS, Microsoft Windows (Windows NT family and Windows CE family), and ReactOS operating systems. On Windows CE .NET 4.2, Windows CE 5.0 and Windows Embedded CE 6.0 it is referred to as the Command Processor Shell. Its implementations differ between operating systems, but the behavior and basic set of commands are consistent. is the counterpart of in DOS and Windows 9x systems, and analogous to the Unix shells used on Unix-like systems. The initial version of for Windows NT was developed by Therese Stowell. Windows CE 2.11 was the first embedded Windows release to support a console and a Windows CE version of . The ReactOS implementation of is derived from FreeCOM, the FreeDOS command line interpreter.

==Operation==
 interacts with the user through a command-line interface. On Windows, this interface is implemented through the Win32 console. may take advantage of features available to native programs of its own platform. For example, on OS/2 and Windows, it can use real pipes in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the standard error stream. ( uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.)

Multiple commands can be processed in a single command line using the command separator .

When using this separator in the Windows , each command must complete successfully for the following commands to execute. For example:

C:\&gt;CommandA &amp;&amp; CommandB &amp;&amp; CommandC
In the above example, will only execute if completes successfully, and the execution of depends on the successful completion of . To process subsequent commands even if the previous command produces an error, the command separator should be used. For example:
C:\&gt;CommandA &amp; CommandB &amp; CommandC
On Windows XP or later, the maximum length of the string that can be used at the command prompt is 8191 (213-1) characters. On earlier versions, such as Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0, the maximum length of the string is 2047 (211-1) characters. This limit includes the command line, individual environment variables that are inherited by other processes, and all environment variable expansions.

Quotation marks are required for the following special characters:
and white space.

==Comparison with COMMAND.COM==
On Windows, is mostly compatible with but provides the following extensions over it:

* More detailed error messages than the blanket &quot;Bad command or file name&quot; (in the case of malformed commands) of . In OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.
* Supports using of arrow keys to scroll through command history. (Under DOS this function was only available under DR DOS (through HISTORY) and later via an external component called .)
* Adds rotating command-line completion for file and folder paths, where the user can cycle through results for the prefix using the , and for reverse direction.
* Treats the caret character () as the escape character; the character following it is to be taken literally. There are special characters in and that are meant to alter the behavior of the command line processor. The caret character forces the command line processor to interpret them literally.
* Supports delayed variable expansion with , allowing values of variables to be calculated at runtime instead of during parsing of script before execution (Windows 2000 and later), fixing DOS idioms that made using control structures hard and complex. The extensions can be disabled, providing a stricter compatibility mode.

Internal commands have also been improved:

* The command was merged into the command, as part of its switch.
* and commands limit the scope of changes to the environment. Changes made to the command line environment after commands are local to the batch file. command restores the previous settings.
* The command allows subroutines within batch file. The command in only supports calling external batch files.
* File name parser extensions to the command are comparable with C shell.
* The command can perform expression evaluation.
* An expansion of the command supports parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to file names.
* The new and commands provide access past navigated paths similar to &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;back&quot; buttons in a web browser or File Explorer.
* The conditional command can perform case-insensitive comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons. (This was available in DR-DOS, but not in PC DOS or MS-DOS.)

<text>In physics and engineering, a phasor (a portmanteau of phase vector) is a complex number representing a sinusoidal function whose amplitude and initial phase are time-invariant and whose angular frequency is fixed. It is related to a more general concept called analytic representation, which decomposes a sinusoid into the product of a complex constant and a factor depending on time and frequency. The complex constant, which depends on amplitude and phase, is known as a phasor, or complex amplitude, and (in older texts) sinor or even complexor.

A common application is in the steady-state analysis of an electrical network powered by time varying current where all signals are assumed to be sinusoidal with a common frequency. Phasor representation allows the analyst to represent the amplitude and phase of the signal using a single complex number. The only difference in their analytic representations is the complex amplitude (phasor). A linear combination of such functions can be represented as a linear combination of phasors (known as phasor arithmetic or phasor algebra) and the time/frequency dependent factor that they all have in common.

The origin of the term phasor rightfully suggests that a (diagrammatic) calculus somewhat similar to that possible for vectors is possible for phasors as well. An important additional feature of the phasor transform is that differentiation and integration of sinusoidal signals (having constant amplitude, period and phase) corresponds to simple algebraic operations on the phasors; the phasor transform thus allows the analysis (calculation) of the AC steady state of RLC circuits by solving simple algebraic equations (albeit with complex coefficients) in the phasor domain instead of solving differential equations (with real coefficients) in the time domain. The originator of the phasor transform was Charles Proteus Steinmetz working at General Electric in the late 19th century. He got his inspiration from Oliver Heaviside. Heaviside&#x27;s operational calculus was modified so that the variable p becomes jω. The complex number j has simple meaning: phase shift.

Glossing over some mathematical details, the phasor transform can also be seen as a particular case of the Laplace transform (limited to a single frequency), which, in contrast to phasor representation, can be used to (simultaneously) derive the transient response of an RLC circuit. However, the Laplace transform is mathematically more difficult to apply and the effort may be unjustified if only steady state analysis is required.

==Notation==
Phasor notation (also known as angle notation) is a mathematical notation used in electronics engineering and electrical engineering. A vector whose polar coordinates are magnitude formula_1 and angle formula_2 is written formula_3 formula_4 can represent either the vector formula_5 or the complex number formula_6, according to Euler&#x27;s formula with formula_7, both of which have magnitudes of 1.

The angle may be stated in degrees with an implied conversion from degrees to radians. For example formula_8 would be assumed to be formula_9 which is the vector formula_10 or the number formula_11

Multiplication and division of complex numbers become straight forward through the phasor notation. Given the vectors formula_12 and formula_13, the following is true:

:formula_14,

:formula_15.

==Definition==
A real-valued sinusoid with constant amplitude, frequency, and phase has the form:

:formula_16

where only parameter formula_17 is time-variant. The inclusion of an imaginary component:

:formula_18

gives it, in accordance with Euler&#x27;s formula, the factoring property described in the lead paragraph:

:formula_19

whose real part is the original sinusoid. The benefit of the complex representation is that linear operations with other complex representations produces a complex result whose real part reflects the same linear operations with the real parts of the other complex sinusoids. Furthermore, all the mathematics can be done with just the phasors formula_20 and the common factor formula_21 is reinserted prior to the real part of the result.

The function formula_22 is an &quot;analytic representation&quot; of formula_23 Figure 2 depicts it as a rotating vector in the complex plane. It is sometimes convenient to refer to the entire function as a &quot;phasor&quot;, as we do in the next section.

==Arithmetic==
===Multiplication by a constant (scalar)===
Multiplication of the phasor formula_24 by a complex constant, formula_25, produces another phasor. That means its only effect is to change the amplitude and phase of the underlying sinusoid:
formula_26

In electronics, formula_25 would represent an impedance, which is independent of time. In particular it is &quot;not&quot; the shorthand notation for another phasor. Multiplying a phasor current by an impedance produces a phasor voltage. But the product of two phasors (or squaring a phasor) would represent the product of two sinusoids, which is a non-linear operation that produces new frequency components. Phasor notation can only represent systems with one frequency, such as a linear system stimulated by a sinusoid.

=== Addition ===

The sum of multiple phasors produces another phasor. That is because the sum of sinusoids with the same frequency is also a sinusoid with that frequency:
formula_28
where:
formula_29

and, if we take formula_30, then formula_31 is:
* formula_32 if formula_33 with formula_34 the signum function;
* formula_35 if formula_36;
* formula_37 if formula_38.

or, via the law of cosines on the complex plane (or the trigonometric identity for angle differences):
formula_39
where formula_40

A key point is that &quot;A&quot;3 and &quot;θ&quot;3 do not depend on &quot;ω&quot; or &quot;t&quot;, which is what makes phasor notation possible. The time and frequency dependence can be suppressed and re-inserted into the outcome as long as the only operations used in between are ones that produce another phasor. In angle notation, the operation shown above is written:
formula_41

Another way to view addition is that two vectors with coordinates and are added vectorially to produce a resultant vector with coordinates (see animation).
In physics, this sort of addition occurs when sinusoids interfere with each other, constructively or destructively. The static vector concept provides useful insight into questions like this: &quot;What phase difference would be required between three identical sinusoids for perfect cancellation?&quot; In this case, simply imagine taking three vectors of equal length and placing them head to tail such that the last head matches up with the first tail. Clearly, the shape which satisfies these conditions is an equilateral triangle, so the angle between each phasor to the next is 120° ( radians), or one third of a wavelength . So the phase difference between each wave must also be 120°, as is the case in three-phase power.

In other words, what this shows is that:
formula_42

In the example of three waves, the phase difference between the first and the last wave was 240°, while for two waves destructive interference happens at 180°. In the limit of many waves, the phasors must form a circle for destructive interference, so that the first phasor is nearly parallel with the last. This means that for many sources, destructive interference happens when the first and last wave differ by 360 degrees, a full wavelength formula_43. This is why in single slit diffraction, the minima occur when light from the far edge travels a full wavelength further than the light from the near edge.

As the single vector rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, its tip at point A will rotate one complete revolution of 360° or 2 radians representing one complete cycle. If the length of its moving tip is transferred at different angular intervals in time to a graph as shown above, a sinusoidal waveform would be drawn starting at the left with zero time. Each position along the horizontal axis indicates the time that has elapsed since zero time, . When the vector is horizontal the tip of the vector represents the angles at 0°, 180°, and at 360°.

Likewise, when the tip of the vector is vertical it represents the positive peak value, () at 90° or and the negative peak value, () at 270° or . Then the time axis of the waveform represents the angle either in degrees or radians through which the phasor has moved. So we can say that a phasor represents a scaled voltage or current value of a rotating vector which is &quot;frozen&quot; at some point in time, () and in our example above, this is at an angle of 30°.

Sometimes when we are analysing alternating waveforms we may need to know the position of the phasor, representing the alternating quantity at some particular instant in time especially when we want to compare two different waveforms on the same axis. For example, voltage and current. We have assumed in the waveform above that the waveform starts at time with a corresponding phase angle in either degrees or radians.

But if a second waveform starts to the left or to the right of this zero point, or if we want to represent in phasor notation the relationship between the two waveforms, then we will need to take into account this phase difference, of the waveform. Consider the diagram below from the previous Phase Difference tutorial.

=== Differentiation and integration ===
The time derivative or integral of a phasor produces another phasor. For example:
formula_44

Therefore, in phasor representation, the time derivative of a sinusoid becomes just multiplication by the constant formula_45.

Similarly, integrating a phasor corresponds to multiplication by formula_46 The time-dependent factor, formula_47 is unaffected.

When we solve a linear differential equation with phasor arithmetic, we are merely factoring formula_21 out of all terms of the equation, and reinserting it into the answer. For example, consider the following differential equation for the voltage across the capacitor in an RC circuit:
formula_49

When the voltage source in this circuit is sinusoidal:
formula_50

we may substitute formula_51

formula_52
where phasor formula_53 and phasor formula_54 is the unknown quantity to be determined.

In the phasor shorthand notation, the differential equation reduces to:
formula_55

Since this must hold for all formula_17, specifically: formula_57 it follows that:
{\mathrm{d}t} \operatorname{Im}\left(V_\text{c} \cdot e^{i\omega t}\right) + \frac{1}{RC} \operatorname{Im}\left(V_\text{c} \cdot e^{i\omega t}\right)
 = \frac{1}{RC}\operatorname{Im}\left(V_\text{s} \cdot e^{i\omega t}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;
|Eq.2}}

It is also readily seen that:
formula_58

Substituting these into and , multiplying by formula_59 and adding both equations gives:
formula_60

Solving for the phasor capacitor voltage gives:
formula_61

As we have seen, the factor multiplying formula_62 represents differences of the amplitude and phase of formula_63 relative to formula_64 and formula_65

In polar coordinate form, the first term of the last expression is:
formula_66
where formula_67.

Therefore:
formula_68

=== Ratio of phasors ===

A quantity called complex impedance is the ratio of two phasors, which is not a phasor, because it does not correspond to a sinusoidally varying function.

== Applications ==

=== Circuit laws ===

With phasors, the techniques for solving DC circuits can be applied to solve linear AC circuits.

; Ohm&#x27;s law for resistors: A resistor has no time delays and therefore doesn&#x27;t change the phase of a signal therefore remains valid.
; Ohm&#x27;s law for resistors, inductors, and capacitors: where is the complex impedance.
; Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws: Work with voltages and current as complex phasors.

In an AC circuit we have real power () which is a representation of the average power into the circuit and reactive power (&quot;Q&quot;) which indicates power flowing back and forth. We can also define the complex power and the apparent power which is the magnitude of . The power law for an AC circuit expressed in phasors is then (where is the complex conjugate of , and the magnitudes of the voltage and current phasors and of are the RMS values of the voltage and current, respectively).

Given this we can apply the techniques of analysis of resistive circuits with phasors to analyze single frequency linear AC circuits containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Multiple frequency linear AC circuits and AC circuits with different waveforms can be analyzed to find voltages and currents by transforming all waveforms to sine wave components (using Fourier series) with magnitude and phase then analyzing each frequency separately, as allowed by the superposition theorem. This solution method applies only to inputs that are sinusoidal and for solutions that are in steady state, i.e., after all transients have died out.

The concept is frequently involved in representing an electrical impedance. In this case, the phase angle is the phase difference between the voltage applied to the impedance and the current driven through it.

===Power engineering===
In analysis of three phase AC power systems, usually a set of phasors is defined as the three complex cube roots of unity, graphically represented as unit magnitudes at angles of 0, 120 and 240 degrees. By treating polyphase AC circuit quantities as phasors, balanced circuits can be simplified and unbalanced circuits can be treated as an algebraic combination of symmetrical components. This approach greatly simplifies the work required in electrical calculations of voltage drop, power flow, and short-circuit currents. In the context of power systems analysis, the phase angle is often given in degrees, and the magnitude in RMS value rather than the peak amplitude of the sinusoid.

The technique of synchrophasors uses digital instruments to measure the phasors representing transmission system voltages at widespread points in a transmission network. Differences among the phasors indicate power flow and system stability.

=== Telecommunications: analog modulations ===

The rotating frame picture using phasor can be a powerful tool to understand analog modulations such as amplitude modulation (and its variants) and frequency modulation.

formula_69
where the term in brackets is viewed as a rotating vector in the complex plane.

The phasor has length formula_1, rotates anti-clockwise at a rate of formula_71 revolutions per second, and at time formula_72 makes an angle of formula_2 with respect to the positive real axis.

The waveform formula_74 can then be viewed as a projection of this vector onto the real axis. A modulated waveform is represented by this phasor (the carrier) and two additional phasors (the modulation phasors). If the modulating signal is a single tone of the form formula_75, where formula_76 is the modulation depth and formula_77 is the frequency of the modulating signal, then for amplitude modulation the two modulation phasors are given by,

formula_78
formula_79

The two modulation phasors are phased such that their vector sum is always in phase with the carrier phasor. An alternative representation is two phasors counter rotating around the end of the carrier phasor at a rate formula_77 relative to the carrier phasor. That is,

formula_81
formula_82

Frequency modulation is a similar representation except that the modulating phasors are not in phase with the carrier. In this case the vector sum of the modulating phasors is shifted 90° from the carrier phase. Strictly, frequency modulation representation requires additional small modulation phasors at formula_83 etc, but for most practical purposes these are ignored because their effect is very small.

<text>A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering (personal) digital fabrication.

A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make &quot;almost anything&quot;. This includes prototyping and technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.

While fab labs have yet to compete with mass production and its associated economies of scale in fabricating widely distributed products, they have already shown the potential to empower individuals to create smart devices for themselves. These devices can be tailored to local or personal needs in ways that are not practical or economical using mass production.

The fab lab movement is closely aligned with the DIY movement, open-source hardware, maker culture, and the free and open-source movement, and shares philosophy as well as technology with them.

== History ==
The fab lab program was initiated to broadly explore how the content of information relates to its physical representation and how an under-served community can be powered by technology at the grassroots level. The program began as a collaboration between the Grassroots Invention Group and the Center for Bits and Atoms at the MIT Media Lab in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF, Washington, D.C.) in 2001.

Vigyan Ashram in India was the first fab lab to be set up outside MIT. It is established in 2002 and received capital equipment by NSF-USA and IIT Kanpur.

While the Grassroots Invention Group is no longer in the MIT Media Lab, The Center for Bits and Atoms consortium is still actively involved in continuing research in areas related to description and fabrication but does not operate or maintain any of the labs worldwide (with the excmobile fab lab).
The fab lab concept also grew out of a popular class at MIT (MAS.863) named &quot;How To Make (Almost) Anything&quot;. The class is still offered in the fall semesters.

== Popular equipment and projects ==
Flexible manufacturing equipment within a fab lab can include:
* Mainly, a rapid prototyper: typically a 3D printer of plastic or plaster parts
* 3-axis CNC machines: 3 or more axes, computer-controlled subtractive milling or turning machines
* Printed circuit board milling or etching: two-dimensional, high precision milling to create circuit traces in pre-clad copper boards
* Microprocessor and digital electronics design, assembly, and test stations
* Cutters, for sheet material: laser cutter, plasma cutter, water jet cutter, knife cutter.
== FabFi ==

One of the larger projects undertaken by fab labs include free community FabFi wireless networks (in Afghanistan, Kenya and US). The first city-scale FabFi network, set up in Afghanistan, has remained in place and active for three years under community supervision and with no special maintenance. The network in Kenya, (Based in the University of Nairobi (UoN)) building on that experience, started to experiment with controlling service quality and providing added services for a fee to make the network cost-neutral.

== Fab Academy ==
Fab Academy leverages the Fab Lab network to teach hands-on, digital fabrication skills. Students convene at Fab Lab &quot;Supernodes&quot; for the 19 week course to earn a diploma and build a portfolio. In some cases, the diploma is accredited or offers academic credit. The curriculum is based on MIT&#x27;s rapid prototyping course MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything. The course is estimated to cost US$5000, but varies with location and available scholarship opportunities. All course materials are publicly archived online here.

== Fab City ==
Fab City has been set up to explore innovative ways of creating the city of the future. It focuses on transforming and shaping the way how materials are sourced and used. This transformation should lead to a shift in the urban model from &#x27;PITO to DIDO&#x27; that is, &#x27;product-in, trash-out&#x27; to, data-in, data-out&#x27;. This can eventually transform cities into self-sufficient entities in 2054; in line with the pledge that Barcelona has made.
The Fab City links to the fab lab movement, because they make use of the same human capital. The Fab cities make use of the innovative spirit of the users of the fab labs.

== Green Fab Labs ==
&quot;The Green Fab Lab Network,&quot; which started in Catalonia&#x27;s Green Fablab, promotes environmental awareness through entrepreneurship. For example, they promote distributed recycling, where locals recycled their plastic waste turning locally sourced shredded plastic into items of value with fused particle fabrication/ fused granular fabrication (FPF/FGF) 3D printing, which not only is a good economic but also a good environmental option.

== List of labs ==
Listing of all official Fab Labs is maintained by the community through website fablabs.io. As of November 2019, there existed 1830 Fab Labs in the world in total. Currently there are Fab Labs on every continent except Antarctica.

<text>The took place in 1181. Retreating from the Battle of Sunomata-gawa, Minamoto no Yukiie attempted to make a stand by destroying the bridge over the Yahagi River (矢作川 &quot;Yahagi-gawa&quot;) and putting up a defensive shieldwall. He was forced to withdraw in the end, but the Taira pursuit was soon called off when their leader, Tomomori, fell ill.

<doc id="1256102" wikidata="Q1541739" url="?curid=1256102" title="Hart to Hart">
<text>Hart to Hart is an American mystery television series that premiered on August 25, 1979, on ABC. The show stars Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers as Jonathan and Jennifer Hart, respectively, a wealthy couple who lead a glamorous jetset lifestyle and regularly find themselves working as unpaid detectives in order to solve crimes in which they become embroiled. The series was created by novelist and television writer Sidney Sheldon. The series ended after five seasons on May 22, 1984, but was followed by eight made-for-television movies, from 1993 to 1996.

==Premise==
The premise of the show is summed up in the opening credits sequence, narrated by Max, the Harts&#x27; majordomo (Lionel Stander), as he introduces the characters:

Several early first season episodes originally included a slightly differently worded intro, with some alternative accompanying shots. This is replaced with the standard first season opening in syndication and later digital releases:

Beginning with Season 2 onward, the opening lines were slightly changed:

Jonathan Hart (Robert Wagner) is the CEO of Hart Industries, a global conglomerate based in Los Angeles. His wife Jennifer (Stefanie Powers) is a freelance journalist. Living the jetset lifestyle, the Harts often find themselves involved in cases of smuggling, theft, corporate and international espionage and, most commonly, murder. At their opulent Bel Air estate, they are assisted by Max (Lionel Stander), their shared mansion&#x27;s loyal, gravel-voiced majordomo, who also helps with their cases. The Harts&#x27; beloved pet dog is a Löwchen called Freeway, so named because he was a stray that they found wandering on the freeway. The Harts own a Mercedes-Benz 300 TD diesel wagon, a dark green Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible (replacing the Series III Bentley custom cabriolet in the first season), and a yellow Mercedes-Benz SL roadster (1979 450 SL, replaced by a 1981 380 SL) with personalized California vanity plates &quot;3 HARTs&quot;, &quot;2 HARTs&quot;, and &quot;1 HART&quot; respectively. The opening credits sequence (stock footage drawn from the series pilot) shows Jonathan Hart driving a red Dino 246 GTS. They also own a Grumman Gulfstream II private jet, which is featured at the start of the opening credits.

Critics have long noted that the premise of &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; strongly resembles that of &quot;The Thin Man&quot; series of 1930s and 1940s films, as well as &quot;The Thin Man&quot; television series of the 1950s, which also depict a wealthy and glamorous crime-fighting couple who have a dog and no children.

==Production==
Screenwriter and novelist Sidney Sheldon had originally written a script in the early 1970s for CBS, titled &quot;Double Twist&quot;, about a married couple who were spies. The script remained unfilmed for several years until producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg decided to update the idea for a potential television series. They offered the script to screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz, who had by that time written several screenplays, including three James Bond films.

They instructed Mankiewicz to make the script more contemporary for a potential weekly series. They proposed to Mankiewicz that if his draft was successful, he could direct the pilot episode. Mankiewicz reworked Sheldon&#x27;s original script and renamed it &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, emphasizing the romantic aspect of the couple. As planned, Mankiewicz made his directorial debut with the pilot episode, and remained a creative consultant to the series. The first ten episodes were developed by Mankiewicz and the series&#x27;s original story editor, Bob Shayne.

Spelling&#x27;s and Goldberg&#x27;s initial choice for the role of Jonathan Hart was Cary Grant. However, Grant (seventy-five years old at the time) had effectively retired from acting over a decade earlier; his last film, &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run,&quot; had been released in 1966. They then decided to find a younger actor who might embody the same style, zest and persona that Grant was famous for, and offered the role to Robert Wagner. No one else was seriously considered for the role; George Hamilton had a high profile at the time and was suggested, but Aaron Spelling said that if he was signed for the role, &quot;the audience will resent him as Hart for being that rich. But no one will begrudge RJ [Wagner] a nickel.&quot;

ABC wanted Wagner&#x27;s then-real life wife Natalie Wood to co-star with him as Jennifer Hart, but Wagner did not think it was a good idea. (Wood did make a cameo appearance in the pilot, as an actress playing Scarlett O&#x27;Hara.) Initial choices for the role of Jennifer Hart included Suzanne Pleshette, Kate Jackson (months removed from ending a three-year turn starring as detective Sabrina Duncan on &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;) and Lindsay Wagner (no relation), but Wagner suggested Stefanie Powers, who had previously worked with him when she made a guest appearance in an episode of his action-adventure series &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; in 1970.

Wagner wanted Sugar Ray Robinson to portray Max, but ABC-TV executives were worried about a black man as majordomo for a rich white couple. Eventually they signed Lionel Stander, who had also worked with Wagner in an episode of &quot;It Takes a Thief.&quot; In that episode, &quot;King of Thieves&quot;, he had also played a character named Max, who was likewise a lifelong friend.

The main title theme for the series was scored by Mark Snow.

Fashion and jewelry designer Nolan Miller, who later designed the clothes for &quot;Dynasty,&quot; was the costume designer for the show.

The ranch-style house used for exterior filming had previously belonged to actors Dick Powell and his wife, June Allyson. Powell was an old friend of both Robert Wagner and Aaron Spelling. The actual estate, known as Amber Hills, is situated on in the Mandeville Canyon section of Brentwood, Los Angeles. In the series, the Harts&#x27; address is given as 3100 Willow Pond Road, Bel Air: the real address of the house is 3100 Mandeville Canyon Road. One episode was shot in San Diego, California.

As with most of the Spelling library series under the control of Sony Pictures Television, the series was remastered from the original masters in the 2000s for widescreen high definition presentation. This version of the series is currently a regular part of the schedule for Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries.

==Episodes==

==TV movies==
In 1993, almost a decade after the series ended, Wagner and Powers reunited for a series of &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; TV movies. Eight 90-minute telemovies were made in total between 1993 and 1996. The first five aired on NBC; the final three were produced for CTV Television Network and The Family Channel in the US:

Lionel Stander reprised his role as Max in five of the movies before his death from lung cancer on November 30, 1994. His last screen appearance was in &quot;Secrets of the Hart,&quot; which aired in March 1995.

==Remakes==
In 2002, Alan Cumming was attached to star in a series being developed for ABC that was being touted as a &quot;gay &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;.&quot; Titled &quot;Mr and Mr Nash,&quot; the planned series featured a gay couple, both interior designers, who &quot;stumble upon a murder each week&quot;, but it never went into production. In September of 2015, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that NBC had made a script commitment to a &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; remake series featuring a gay male couple. Written by Christopher Fife and produced by Carol Mendelsohn and Julie Weitz, the new series was described as &quot;a modern and sexy retelling of the classic series that focuses on by-the-book attorney Jonathan Hart and free-spirited investigator Dan Hartman, who must balance the two sides of their life: action-packed crime-solving in the midst of newly found domesticity.&quot; But as of late September of 2020, that series was not known to be in production either.

==Home media==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the first two seasons of &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; on DVD in Regions 1 &amp; 2 in 2005/2006.

In 2010/2011, Sony Pictures released all eight TV movies on DVD individually via the Warner Archive Collection. These were Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) releases and are available exclusively through WBShop.com and Amazon.com. On October 2, 2012, Sony released all eight TV movies in two volume collections titled &quot;Hart to Hart: TV Movie Collection, Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Hart to Hart: TV Movie Collection, Volume 2&quot;. These are also manufacture-on-demand (MOD) releases, available via Amazon.com, and are part of the Sony Choice Collection.

On September 4, 2014, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series for Region 1. They released Season 3 in December 2014, Season 4 in February 2015, the fifth and final season in June 2015, and The Complete Series on May 30, 2017.

==Awards and nominations==
==&quot;The Greatest Event in Television History&quot; (2013)==
On June 6, 2013 (June 7 in the Eastern Time Zone), Adult Swim aired an edition of &quot;The Greatest Event in Television History.&quot; Hosted by Jeff Probst, the program went behind the scenes during the making of a shot-for-shot remake of the &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; opening sequence, with Adam Scott and Amy Poehler respectively in the roles of Jonathan and Jennifer Hart, and Horatio Sanz as Max. The remake followed a similar effort in the fall of 2012, adapting the opening credit sequence of &quot;Simon &amp; Simon.&quot;
