<text>Argentan () is a commune and the seat of two cantons and of an arrondissement in the Orne department in northwestern France. As of 2019, Argentan is the third largest municipality by population in the Orne department.

==History==

Argentan is situated near the river Orne. Although the region was heavily populated during the Gallo Roman period the town is not mentioned until 1025–1026. The toponym comes from the Gaulish words (&quot;silver&quot;) and (&quot;market&quot;). The town grew in importance during the Middle Ages.

Throughout the Middle Ages, Argentan alternated between prosperity and destruction, as English forces occupied the city several times. The Plantagenets had considered this town as one of the most important of Normandy.

During the reign of Louis XIV, Colbert set Alençon against Argentan in an economic competition on lace making. Thus, the &quot;point d&#x27;Argentan&quot; (&quot;Argentan stitch&quot;) and the &quot;point d&#x27;Alençon&quot; (&quot;Alençon stitch&quot;) were created. Argentan became a very important town for traditional industry. It also gained in religious importance with the building of a Benedictine Abbey and two churches, &quot;Saint-Martin&quot; and &quot;Saint-Germain&quot;. Several mansions (&quot;hôtels particuliers&quot;) were also built.

During World War I, the French 104th Infantry Regiment/14th Infantry Brigade was stationed at Argentan. It participated in the battle of Verdun in 1916.

During World War II, the city was almost totally destroyed. On 5 June 1944, on the eve of the Allied D-Day landing on the beaches of Normandy, the city suffered an important air raid in which the train station was destroyed. The city suffered further damage when it was bombed on 6 and 7 June by B-17 and B-24 bombers of the U.S. Eighth Air Force. The greatest part of the city was, however, left in ruins two and a half months later, at the end of August, during the battle of the Argentan-Falaise Pocket. The U.S. Third Army, under the command of general George S. Patton liberated Argentan after eight days of violent combat against the German 9th Panzer Division and the 2nd SS Panzer Division &quot;Das Reich&quot;. The U.S. 80th Infantry Division liberated the city in the morning of 20 August.

<doc id="1260136" wikidata="Q3274806" url="?curid=1260136" title="Outtake">
<text>An outtake is a portion of a work (usually a film or music recording) that is removed in the editing process and not included in the work&#x27;s final, publicly released version. In the digital era, significant outtakes have been appended to CD and DVD reissues of many albums and films as bonus tracks or features, in film often, but not always, for the sake of humor. In terms of photos, an outtake may also mean the ones which are not released in the original set of photos (i.e. photo shoots and digitals).

==Film==
An outtake is any take of a movie or a television program that is removed or otherwise not used in the final cut. Some of these takes are humorous mistakes made in the process of filming (commonly known to American audiences as bloopers). Multiple takes of each shot are always taken, for safety. Due to this, the number of outtakes a film has will always vastly outnumber the takes included in the edited, finished product.

An outtake may also be a complete version of a recording that is dropped in favor of another version.

Often outtakes can be found as special features on DVDs and Blu-rays. Purpose-made &quot;outtakes&quot; can also be found playing over credits at the end of a film or TV program. Well known examples of this are Jackie Chan and Disney/Pixar films, although in the latter only three movies were made with such as (&quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;). Pixar films, being computer-generated, do not feature &quot;real&quot; outtakes, but rather staged ones in which the animation features &quot;mistakes&quot;.

Outtakes may also enter stock footage libraries and appear in future productions. For example, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Everything&quot; (1921) started as an outtake from &quot;The Affairs of Anatol&quot; (1921) and was then expanded with additional footage.

It is generally considered that the inclusion of outtakes in a film&#x27;s finished product started with &quot;Hooper&quot; (1978), helmed by stunt-man-turned-director Hal Needham and starring Burt Reynolds. Needham decided to include outtakes in the film&#x27;s end credit scrawl to highlight alternate camera angles for the impressive stunts performed for the movie. Needham also interspersed comedic outtakes of the actors as well.

The inclusion was so successful with fans that Needham continued to insert comedic outtakes in his future directorial efforts such as &quot;Smokey &amp; The Bandit 2&quot; (1980), &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981), &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; (1983) and &quot;Cannonball Run 2&quot; (1984).

===Criticism===
Film critic Gene Siskel has been critical of outtakes being played over a film&#x27;s credits, saying of the film &quot;Liar Liar&quot;:

This picture ends over the credits with outtakes. I hate that. I don&#x27;t even care if they&#x27;re funny, I still hate it because to me it&#x27;s almost like an act of desperation from the filmmakers saying &quot;Well we&#x27;re not sure if we made a funny picture, but we&#x27;re gonna throw this stuff in and we&#x27;ll leave you laughing on the way out.&quot;

==Television==
The British programme &quot;It&#x27;ll be Alright on the Night&quot;, has been running on ITV since 1977 featuring outtakes. The BBC&#x27;s answer to this was &quot;Auntie&#x27;s Bloomers&quot;, eventually replaced by &quot;Outtake TV&quot;. Prior to these series, production errors were rarely seen for pre-recorded programmes, since these were edited out before transmission. Nowadays, it is common to see outtakes at the end of films, or compiled into programmes like these.

==Music==
Just like a movie outtake, music outtakes are recordings that are not used in a final version of an album. Collections of this sort of material are often compiled and distributed illegally by fans, and known as a bootlegged recording. Sometimes, artists release collections of outtakes, sometimes grouped with other rarities such as demos and unreleased songs.

Occasionally collections of outtakes become recognized as part of an artist&#x27;s major creative output, especially in cases where an artist is unusually prolific or dies young. One example would be &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot; by Dave Matthews Band, an album that was considered unfinished and not ready to be distributed, yet is widely considered part of the discography of the band by their fans. An example of the former is the fourteen-volume &quot;Bootleg Series&quot; from Bob Dylan, which contains many important Dylan songs omitted from his albums, some of which were made famous by other artists. An example of the latter is the CD &quot;Time of No Reply&quot; by Nick Drake, a British singer-songwriter who died almost unknown at the age of 26 in 1974, but whose music became highly influential on other artists in subsequent decades.

==Video games==
In a similar vein as a music outtake, video game outtakes are elements (characters, levels, items, cutscenes, etc.) that were not used in a game&#x27;s final version. These can be unlocked via hacking or officially through demos.

Examples include &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;, whose notable abandoned level &quot;Stormy Ascent&quot; can be unlocked through hacking. Similarly, Donkey Kong, Silver the Hedgehog, Cream the Rabbit, Jet the Hawk, Espio the Chameleon, Big the Cat and a Goomba can be unlocked via hacking on &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot;.

<text>&quot;Let Us All Unite and Celebrate Together&quot; (; ; ; ; ) is the anthem of the African Union (AU). It was written as a poem titled &quot;Proud to be African&quot; by Ethiopian poet Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin, while the music was composed by Kenyan choral composer Arthur Mudogo Kemoli. It had served as the anthem of the former Organisation of African Unity since 1986 before being adopted by the newly formed Union in 2002.

== History ==
The anthem was written as a poem titled &quot;Proud to be African&quot; by Ethiopian poet Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin. Kenyan choral composer Arthur Mudogo Kemoli composed the anthem&#x27;s music in Dakar, Senegal in 1986 and it was selected as the anthem of the AU&#x27;s predecessor, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), as part of a contest. That same year, the OAU honoured Tsegaye with the OAU African Unity Anthem Prize for writing the anthem.

After the AU&#x27;s formation in 2002, it organised a contest to establish official symbols of the Union, including a flag, emblem and anthem. The competition&#x27;s brief for the anthem included that its short form for official ceremonies (first stanzas or two verses and chorus) should not exceed one minute in length and that each entry should include lyrics, sheet music, a good recording and an explanatory note and be submitted in one of the working languages of the AU. The brief stated that the symbols should draw inspiration from a number of values including struggle, independence, labour, unity, justice and hope. The competition was to last until 25 April 2003 and the three best entries were to be presented and the symbols chosen at a session of the AU Assembly in Maputo, Mozambique in July 2003 with the first-, second- and third-place winners receiving US$7,000, US$5,000 and US$3,000 cash prizes, respectively.

The competition did not attract many participants; eventually, it was abandoned and the old OAU symbols were instead retained as the new symbols for the AU (including the OAU anthem, which was retained as the anthem of the new bloc).

<doc id="1260184" wikidata="Q1048170" url="?curid=1260184" title="Casper Meets Wendy">
<text>Casper Meets Wendy is a 1998 American fantasy comedy film based on the Harvey Comics cartoon characters Casper the Friendly Ghost and Wendy the Good Little Witch. The film is a sequel to &quot;&quot;, and the second spin-off/prequel of &quot;Casper&quot; (1995). Saban Entertainment co-produced the project.

This was Hilary Duff&#x27;s first major film, and was released on September 22, 1998, six days before her 11th birthday. The film also marks the second &quot;Casper&quot; film for co-star Cathy Moriarty, who previously starred as the main antagonist in the 1995 film.

The film was met with mostly negative reviews from critics, but was considered an improvement to its predecessor. Its television premiere was October 24, 1999 on Fox Family.

==Plot==
The Ghostly Trio cause panic at a baseball game, and their nephew Casper fails to settle the terrified crowd. The park empties, and after watching their effect with satisfaction, Casper&#x27;s uncles plan a vacation.

Meanwhile, a malevolent warlock named Desmond Spellman is told by the Oracle in the Mirror that in the future, a good little witch named Wendy will surpass him. Desmond plans to get rid of her with the advised &quot;Mystic Abyss&quot;, a dimensional rift that can destroy living beings. He then creates a pair of spies: Jules and Vincent, and assigns them to bring Wendy to him from where she is living in the country with her three mischievous aunts: Gert, Gabby and Fanny.

Jules and Vincent arrive at Wendy&#x27;s house to escort the young witch to Desmond, but she narrowly escapes with her aunts. To keep Wendy safe from Desmond, her aunts hide and vacation at the same resort hotel in which Casper and his uncles are vacationing. Wendy meets a boy named Josh Jackman and they start to become friends until he shows his true colors by pushing a girl away from her game at the arcade and ignoring Wendy when she tries to talk to him in the middle of the game. Casper and Wendy meet in a barn and become friends, but they fear that their guardians will not get along because ghosts and witches are natural enemies. Casper and Wendy devise a plan to make them meet at a party. Casper gets the Ghostly Trio to possess three men who happen to resemble them. Wendy convinces her aunts to go to the party to meet men. Thanks to their plotting, they meet and soon the Trio are flirting with the three witches, who are posing as regular women.

The plan is spoiled when the possession wears off and the Trio&#x27;s real selves are revealed to Wendy&#x27;s aunts, who, in turn, reveal their real selves and threaten them with magic. Wendy explains to Casper that she and her aunts cannot use high-level magic or else Desmond will be able to track them down. When the Trio suspects Casper is protecting the witches, they pressure him into blurting out that the witches cannot use their powers, prompting the Trio to terrorize Wendy and her aunts. Wendy feels she has no choice but to cast a high-level spell to cover the Trio in plaster, alerting Desmond of her location.

Distraught that Casper broke his promise, Wendy ends their friendship. Casper soon confronts his uncles and tells them that Desmond is coming after the witches and they should help, at which the Trio scoff and refuse. Before the witches can evacuate the resort, Desmond and his spies arrive. After finding and confronting the witches, Desmond explains the Oracle&#x27;s prediction, and after she tries to resist him, summons the Mystic Abyss and casts Wendy into it, with Casper diving inside in an attempt to rescue her. While inside together, Wendy apologizes to Casper for yelling at him and ending their friendship. Wendy&#x27;s aunts battle Desmond but are no match for him. Before Desmond can turn the witches into fertilizer, a giant three-eyed monster appears and frightens the warlock who trips over Wendy&#x27;s broom and falls into the Abyss himself. The monster turns out to be the Ghostly Trio, who had a change of heart. While they hold the door to the Abyss open, Wendy&#x27;s aunts pull her and Casper out.

Both Casper and Wendy are unconscious from being inside the Abyss, but with encouragement and comfort from their guardians, Casper is restored by his uncles, and Wendy is treated by her aunts. After a touching reunion between the witches and an awkward one between the ghosts, the witches thank the Trio for helping them and the Trio admit it was nice getting to know them. Casper and Wendy&#x27;s friendship is restored. The Oracle then proclaims that Wendy is the greatest witch because she did something no other witch ever could: she befriended a ghost. Later, Casper, his uncles, Wendy, and her aunts, all bid each other goodbye. Wendy assures Casper they will see each other again very soon. Before flying back home with her aunts, Wendy gives Casper a goodbye kiss, causing him to blush.

<doc id="1260189" wikidata="Q666300" url="?curid=1260189" title="Arizona bark scorpion">
<text>The Arizona bark scorpion (Centruroides sculpturatus, once included in &quot;Centruroides exilicauda&quot;) is a small light brown scorpion common to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. An adult male can reach of body length, while a female is slightly smaller, with a maximum length of .

== Predators ==

Arizona bark scorpions are eaten by a wide variety of animals such as pallid bats, birds (especially owls), reptiles, and other vertebrates. Some examples include spiders, snakes, peccaries, rodents, and other scorpions. Development, pesticides and collecting scorpions for research or the pet trade also reduces the bark scorpion population.

The painful and potentially deadly venom of Arizona bark scorpions has little effect on grasshopper mice. Scientists have found the scorpion toxin acts as an analgesic rather than a pain stimulant in grasshopper mice.

== Life cycle ==
Arizona bark scorpions have a gestation period of several months, are born live, and are gently guided onto their mother&#x27;s back. The female usually gives birth to anywhere from 25 to 35 young. These remain with their mother until their first molt, which can be up to three weeks after birth. Arizona bark scorpions have a life expectancy of about six years.

Arizona bark scorpions, like most other scorpions, are incredibly resilient. During US nuclear testing, scorpions, along with cockroaches and lizards, were found near ground zero with no recorded adverse effects.

== Habitat ==
The Arizona bark scorpion is nocturnal, and particularly well adapted to the desert: layers of wax on its exoskeleton make it resistant to water loss. Nevertheless, Arizona bark scorpions hide during the heat of the day, typically under rocks, wood piles, or tree bark. Arizona bark scorpions do burrow, and are commonly found in homes, requiring only 1/16 of an inch for entry.

Arizona bark scorpions prefer riparian areas with mesquite, cottonwood, and sycamore groves, all of which have sufficient moisture and humidity to support insects and other prey species. The popularity of irrigated lawns, and other systems which increase environmental humidity in residential areas, has led to a massive increase in the number of these animals in some areas.

&quot;Centruroides&quot; scorpions are unusual in that they are the only genus in the Southwest that can climb walls, trees, and other objects with a sufficiently rough surface. Arizona bark scorpions practice negative geotaxis, preferring an upside down orientation, which often results in people being stung due to the scorpion being on the underside of an object.

The Arizona bark scorpion preys on small and medium-sized animals such as beetles, spiders, crickets, cockroaches, other insects and other scorpions.

The range of the Arizona bark scorpion is from southern California, southern Arizona, southern Nevada, extreme southwestern Utah and western New Mexico. They are also found in Baja California, Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico.

== Venom ==

The Arizona bark scorpion is the most venomous scorpion in North America, and its venom can cause severe pain (coupled with numbness, tingling, and vomiting) in adult humans, typically lasting between 24 and 72 hours. Temporary dysfunction in the area stung is common; e.g. a hand or possibly arm can be immobilized or experience convulsions. It also may cause loss of breath for a short time. Due to the extreme pain induced, many victims describe sensations of electrical jolts after envenomation. Two recorded fatalities have occurred in the state of Arizona since 1968; the number of victims stung each year in Arizona and New Mexico is estimated to be in the thousands. 

=== Antivenom===
An antivenom was developed for this species at Arizona State University by Dr. Herbert L. Stahnke, and produced in quantities sufficient to treat individuals within the state of Arizona. This antivenom was not FDA approved, but use within the state of Arizona was allowable and very successful in shortening the duration of symptoms and hospitalization. Production of this antivenom ceased by 2000 and the product was unavailable by 2004. A Mexican-produced antivenom, Anascorp [Antivenin Centruroides (scorpion) F(ab′)2, Laboratorios Silanes, Instituto Bioclon SA de CV], received FDA approval on August 3, 2011, and is now in use.

=== First aid ===
Basic first aid measures can be used to help mediate Arizona bark scorpion stings:
* Clean sting site with soap and water
* Apply a cool compress (cool cloth)
* Take acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen for local pain and swelling

=== Medical emergencies ===
Arizona poison control centers suggest immediate medical attention if severe symptoms occur, particularly in young children. The Poison Center may be reached at 1-800-222-1222.

== UV lighting ==

Arizona bark scorpions, like most other scorpions, will glow when exposed to a blacklight. This is particularly useful in scorpion detection, since Arizona bark scorpions are active during the night, and can be easily spotted using this method. Typical UV LED flashlights enable their human operator to readily detect Arizona bark scorpions at a distance of approximately six feet. Newly molted Arizona bark scorpions will not glow under ultraviolet light for a few days after molting.

== Control and prevention ==
Arizona bark scorpions are tan or light beige tone in color and very small, making them difficult to detect especially on natural terrain (rocky land, multiple vegetation and soil textured land). They often look for places to hide, and they will not seek out humans unless provoked or defending young. Several methods of control have historically been used to control Arizona bark scorpions, such as physical barriers (scorpions are unable to climb smooth surfaces), pesticides, glue boards, and removing any scorpion congregation areas in the vicinity of the building.

<text>Your Computer was an Australian computer magazine published by the White House Publishing Group (under licence from Motorword Pty Ltd.) and printed by The Lithgo Centre, Waterloo. Starting with the very first issue in May/June 1981 (102 pages) (with a limited print run of 30,000) at the recommended price of $2.00. Around 1985 the magazine was later published by Federal Publishing Company (Hannanprint Group) and printed by Macquarie Print. The monthly magazine&#x27;s final issue was May/June 1997. The first editor of the magazine was Les Bell.

The articles in &quot;Your Computer&quot; catered for beginners to computing, through to highly technical programming techniques, industry updates, resources, user group and microcomputer-specific columns, and published many special features of Australian technology companies. Articles were written by both full-time magazine staff and freelance contributors, including Les Bell, Matt Whalen, Bill Bolton, Stewart White and Lloyd Borrett. Cartoonist Brendan J Ackhurst was also a frequent contributor of illustrations to the magazine. For many years, the magazine was focused on home computers such as the Commodore 64, Apple II, MicroBee and many others. It never specialized on any one market, and so catered for hobbyists, serious hobbyists, and professionals, and remained platform agnostic.

<text>A metapopulation consists of a group of spatially separated populations of the same species which interact at some level. The term metapopulation was coined by Richard Levins in 1969 to describe a model of population dynamics of insect pests in agricultural fields, but the idea has been most broadly applied to species in naturally or artificially fragmented habitats. In Levins&#x27; own words, it consists of &quot;a population of populations&quot;.

A metapopulation is generally considered to consist of several distinct populations together with areas of suitable habitat which are currently unoccupied. In classical metapopulation theory, each population cycles in relative independence of the other populations and eventually goes extinct as a consequence of demographic stochasticity (fluctuations in population size due to random demographic events); the smaller the population, the more chances of inbreeding depression and prone to extinction.

Although individual populations have finite life-spans, the metapopulation as a whole is often stable because immigrants from one population (which may, for example, be experiencing a population boom) are likely to re-colonize habitat which has been left open by the extinction of another population. They may also emigrate to a small population and rescue that population from extinction (called the &quot;rescue effect&quot;). Such a rescue effect may occur because declining populations leave niche opportunities open to the &quot;rescuers&quot;.

The development of metapopulation theory, in conjunction with the development of source–sink dynamics, emphasised the importance of connectivity between seemingly isolated populations. Although no single population may be able to guarantee the long-term survival of a given species, the combined effect of many populations may be able to do this.

Metapopulation theory was first developed for terrestrial ecosystems, and subsequently applied to the marine realm. In fisheries science, the term &quot;sub-population&quot; is equivalent to the metapopulation science term &quot;local population&quot;. Most marine examples are provided by relatively sedentary species occupying discrete patches of habitat, with both local recruitment and recruitment from other local populations in the larger metapopulation. Kritzer &amp; Sale have argued against strict application of the metapopulation definitional criteria that extinction risks to local populations must be non-negligible.

Finnish biologist Ilkka Hanski of the University of Helsinki was an important contributor to metapopulation theory.

== Predation and oscillations ==

The first experiments with predation and spatial heterogeneity were conducted by G. F. Gause in the 1930s, based on the Lotka–Volterra equation, which was formulated in the mid-1920s, but no further application had been conducted. The Lotka-Volterra equation suggested that the relationship between predators and their prey would result in population oscillations over time based on the initial densities of predator and prey. Gause&#x27;s early experiments to prove the predicted oscillations of this theory failed because the predator–prey interactions were not influenced by immigration. However, once immigration was introduced, the population cycles accurately depicted the oscillations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra equation, with the peaks in prey abundance shifted slightly to the left of the peaks of the predator densities. Huffaker&#x27;s experiments expanded on those of Gause by examining how both the factors of migration and spatial heterogeneity lead to predator–prey oscillations.

== Huffaker&#x27;s experiments on predator–prey interactions (1958) ==

In order to study predation and population oscillations, Huffaker used mite species, one being the predator and the other being the prey. He set up a controlled experiment using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact. At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties similar to those of Gause in creating a stable predator–prey interaction. By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse. These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model. Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of spatial heterogeneity and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker&#x27;s experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator–prey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.

== The Levins model ==

Levins&#x27; original model applied to a metapopulation distributed over many patches of suitable habitat with significantly less interaction between patches than within a patch. Population dynamics within a patch were simplified to the point where only presence and absence were considered. Each patch in his model is either populated or not.

Let &quot;N&quot; be the fraction of patches occupied at a given time. During a time &quot;dt&quot;, each occupied patch can become unoccupied with an extinction probability &quot;edt&quot;. Additionally, 1 − &quot;N&quot; of the patches are unoccupied. Assuming a constant rate &quot;c&quot; of propagule generation from each of the &quot;N&quot; occupied patches, during a time &quot;dt&quot;, each unoccupied patch can become occupied with a colonization probability &quot;cNdt&quot; . Accordingly, the time rate of change of occupied patches, &quot;dN/dt&quot;, is

: formula_1

This equation is mathematically equivalent to the logistic model, with a carrying capacity &quot;K&quot; given by

: formula_2

and growth rate &quot;r&quot;

: formula_3

At equilibrium, therefore, some fraction of the species&#x27;s habitat will always be unoccupied.

== Stochasticity and metapopulations ==

Huffaker&#x27;s studies of spatial structure and species interactions are an example of early experimentation in metapopulation dynamics. Since the experiments of Huffaker and Levins, models have been created which integrate stochastic factors. These models have shown that the combination of environmental variability (stochasticity) and relatively small migration rates cause indefinite or unpredictable persistence. However, Huffaker&#x27;s experiment almost guaranteed infinite persistence because of the controlled immigration variable.

== Stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) ==

One major drawback of the Levins model is that it is deterministic, whereas the fundamental metapopulation processes are stochastic. Metapopulations are particularly useful when discussing species in disturbed habitats, and the viability of their populations, i.e., how likely they are to become extinct in a given time interval. The Levins model cannot address this issue. A simple way to extend the Levins&#x27; model to incorporate space and stochastic considerations is by using the contact process. Simple modifications to this model can also incorporate for patch dynamics. At a given percolation threshold, habitat fragmentation effects take place in these configurations predicting more drastic extinction thresholds.

For conservation biology purposes, metapopulation models must include (a) the finite nature of metapopulations (how many patches are suitable for habitat), and (b) the probabilistic nature of extinction and colonisation. Also, in order to apply these models, the extinctions and colonisations of the patches must be asynchronous.

== Microhabitat patches (MHPs) and bacterial metapopulations ==

Combining nanotechnology with landscape ecology, synthetic habitat landscapes have been fabricated on a chip by building a collection of bacterial mini-habitats with nano-scale channels providing them with nutrients for habitat renewal, and connecting them by corridors in different topological arrangements, generating a spatial mosaic of patches of opportunity distributed in time. This can be used for landscape experiments by studying the bacteria metapopulations on the chip, for example their evolutionary ecology.

== Life history evolution ==
Metapopulation models have been used to explain life-history evolution, such as the ecological stability of amphibian metamorphosis in small vernal ponds. Alternative ecological strategies have evolved. For example, some salamanders forgo metamorphosis and sexually mature as aquatic neotenes. The seasonal duration of wetlands and the migratory range of the species determines which ponds are connected and if they form a metapopulation. The duration of the life history stages of amphibians relative to the duration of the vernal pool before it dries up regulates the ecological development of metapopulations connecting aquatic patches to terrestrial patches.

It supersedes the &quot;Journal of Youth Services&quot;, which was published together with the Association for Library Service to Children until 2002. The magazine serves as a mode of continuing education for librarians working with young adult populations (ages 12–18). The content of the magazine includes current news in the field, showcasing the best practices, providing news from related fields, spotlighting significant events of YALSA, and providing in depth reviews of professional literature. The fall issue contains award announcements, speeches by award-winning authors, and background information on books. The journal publishes articles about teen habits, literacy, and interests. Additionally, it serves as mode of communication for members of the association and as a record for the organization.

==History==
&quot;Young Adult Library Services&quot; started as &quot;Top of the News&quot; in 1942. &quot;Top of the News&quot; was published by the Division for Children and Young Peoples, which had been created in 1941. The Division for Children and Young Peoples was succeeded by the Children&#x27;s Services Division and the Young Adult Services Division in 1957. From then on &quot;Top of the News&quot; was published jointly by both divisions. The name of the journal changed to &quot;Journal for Youth Services&quot; (JOYS) in 1987 to adequately reflect the contents and interests of the membership. In 1993, with the restructuring of the Young Adult Services Division into the Young Adult Library Services Association, JOYS was restructured as well. With an aim of creating a more informed readership, JOYS began publishing speeches from programs from YALSA and the Children&#x27;s Services Division, which had been renamed Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC) in 1977. They also increased the pool of referees from 33 to 50. In 2002 this magazine was split in two: &quot;Young Adult Library Services&quot; and &quot;Children and Libraries&quot;. &quot;Young Adult Library Services&quot; has been the recipient of the 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2016 Apex Awards of Excellence for a magazine or journal over 32 pages.

<text>Accoona was an internet company with offices in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Shanghai, China. Their main product was a search engine that claimed to use artificial intelligence to better understand searches. On June 23, 2005, in the ABC Times Square Studios, the AI Accoona Toolbar, driven by a Fritz 9 prototype, played against the chess grandmaster Rustam Kasimdzhanov. In addition to traditional searches, it allows business profile searches, and its signature &quot;SuperTarget&quot; feature. Their exclusive partnership with &quot;China Daily&quot;, a large Chinese internet portal, was seen as a highly strategic move.

The CEO of Accoona was Valentine J. Zammit, formerly of 24/7 Real Media and DoubleClick.

After IPO problems, Accoona shut down on October 5, 2008.

In October 2008 the web page said: &quot;Dear Accoona search users, Due to an overwhelmingly competitive search market, Accoona.com and Accoona.cn will no longer be active. We thank you for your previous support. Sincerely, Accoona Management.&quot;

Accoona&#x27;s domains and search facilities were acquired by Masterseek B2B (business-to-business) search engine on October 30, 2008.

==Partnerships==
Accoona provided the search technology to the Chinese portals Sina.com and Sohu. They also formed a 20-year exclusive partnership with &quot;China Daily&quot;. Through this partnership and its widespread Chinese affiliates, Accoona expected 10 million hits daily from the otherwise isolated Chinese user base.

Accoona signed a million dollar deal with FAST Search from Norway to help enhance their rankings.

==Press==
* Accoona received attention after selecting former President Bill Clinton as a spokesperson on December 8, 2004.
* Accoona also received significant coverage from the webmaster community after many forum sites were spammed with promotional Accoona entries.
* Accoona was selected among the &quot;50 Coolest Websites&quot; of 2006 by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

<doc id="1260226" wikidata="Q100145" url="?curid=1260226" title="Caravaggio, Lombardy">
<text>Caravaggio (; ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Bergamo, in Lombardy, Italy, east of Milan. It is the home town of renaissance era artists Caravaggio and Polidoro da Caravaggio.

==History==
The town received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on December 22, 1954.

==Geography==
Caravaggio borders with the municipalities of Bariano, Brignano Gera d&#x27;Adda, Calvenzano, Capralba (CR), Fornovo San Giovanni, Misano di Gera d&#x27;Adda, Morengo, Mozzanica, Sergnano (CR) and Treviglio. Its &quot;frazioni&quot; are Masano and Vidalengo.

==Main sights==
The city is best known for the Sanctuary (15th century).

Other sights include:
*The Gallavresi Palace (or the Marchioness Palace), now the Town Hall. It dates to the second half of the 13th century.
*Church of &quot;San Fermo e Rustico&quot;, in Lombard-Gothic style, built in the 13th century over a pre-existing holy edifice. The two aisles were added in 1429. It has a façade in brickwork with a marble central portal, surmounted by a large rose window. It is flanked by a high bell tower, built in 1500 by governor Giovanni Dandolo. The interior houses the Holy Sacrament Chapel (late 15th-early 16th century), in Bramantesque style, variously attributed to Giovanni Battagio; also present are works by Bernardino Campi, Giovanni Moriggia, Giulio Cesare Procaccini and Nicola Moietta.
*Church of &quot;Santa Liberata&quot; (16th century), with frescoes.
*Porta Nuova arch (18th century)
*Teatro Amerighi, named after the family of the painter Michelangelo Amerighi da Caravaggio, it was a theatre designed by the Liberty style architect Carlo Bedolini and built at the beginning of the 20th century. It has been probably the most important cultural and social spot of the city for decades before being destroyed at the end of the Second World War. In the area it was considered like a little Teatro alla Scala.

==People==
*Giovanni Francesco Straparola, Renaissance writer and poet.
*Giovanni Mangone, 16th century architect and sculptor.
*Michelangelo Merisi o Amerighi da Caravaggio, Italian Baroque painter, who is named after the town.

<doc id="1260235" wikidata="Q7870776" url="?curid=1260235" title="USS Keystone State (1853)">
<text>USS Keystone State was a wooden sidewheel steamer that served in the Union Navy during the American Civil War. She was a fast ship for her day and was used effectively to blockade Confederate ports on the Atlantic coast. She participated in the capture or destruction of 17 blockade runners. In addition to her military service, &quot;Keystone State&quot; had a lengthy commercial career before the war. Renamed &quot;San Francisco&quot;, she also sailed commercially after the war. The ship was built in 1853 and scrapped in 1874.

== Construction and characteristics ==
&quot;Keystone State&quot; was commissioned by the Philadelphia and Savannah Steam Navigation Company. She was intended to carry passengers and cargo as one of a pair of vessels offering weekly service between the two cities. Her hull was built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the Vaughn &amp; Lynn Shipyard. Her frame was built of live oak and locust wood, and she was planked with white oak. The ship was long, with a beam of , and a depth of hold of . She displaced 1,364 tons.

She was propelled by a coal-fired side-lever steam engine. Steam was produced in two boilers. The engine had a single cylinder that was in diameter, with a stroke of . The engine was built by the Southwark Foundry &amp; Machine Company of Philadelphia, operated by Merrick &amp; Sons. The steam engine drove paddlewheels which were in diameter with face of . Her maximum speed was 14 knots, but the state of her hull and machinery reduced her maximum speed to as little as 10.5 knots on occasion.

The ship had two masts and was rigged as a bark. She could sail, but was slower and less maneuverable than under steam.

As originally built, she had 46 staterooms, a couple of salons, a dining room, ladies&#x27; parlor, smoking room, and a passenger library. She had running water in the washrooms, storage for ice, and cold rooms to keep food fresh for passengers. Her original cost was reported as $180,000.

&quot;Keystone State&quot; was launched on 18 June 1853. Sea trials of the newly completed ship took place on 19 September 1853. She was immediately placed in commercial service.

Her namesake, The Keystone State, is a nickname for Pennsylvania.

== Philadelphia and Savannah Steam Navigation Company (18531861) ==
&quot;Keystone State&quot; completed her first trip from Philadelphia to Savannah on 23 September 1853 after a 56.5 hour run. This was considered a fast sailing at the time. This trip inaugurated weekly scheduled service between the two cities. She and &quot;State of Georgia&quot; alternated departures and each completed a single one-way trip per week. Cabin passage cost $20 and steerage was $8.

On a north-bound trip in March 1854, a black man was found stowed-away inside the housing of one of the paddle wheels. This position was extremely dangerous and he was compelled to call for help. He claimed he was a free person, but being unable to prove his status, he was put ashore, jailed, and returned to Savannah.

On the night of 10–11 May 1855, while inbound to Philadelphia, she was hit by two small vessels. At 10 pm the schooner &quot;Adrian&quot;, carrying coal for Fall River, Massachusetts, ran into &quot;Keystone State&quot; and sank in 15 minutes. The ship lowered a boat and managed to save three of her crew, but two others perished. Four hours later the schooner &quot;Little Tom&quot; hit the &quot;Keystone State&quot; and sank. This time the ship&#x27;s boat was able to rescue the entire crew of five. A more serious collision occurred at 1 am on the foggy night of 25 May 1856 when &quot;Keystone State&quot; hit the bark &quot;Cavalier&quot;. &quot;Keystone State&#x27;s&quot; bow was crushed and she immediately began to flood. Her steam pumps barely kept up with the incoming water, and her captain was able to run the ship up onto the mud flats near Norfolk, Virginia, to keep her from sinking. While the colliding ships were briefly locked together, the 1st and 3rd mates and three sailors of &quot;Cavalier&quot; leapt aboard &quot;Keystone State&quot;. Despite the damage, &quot;Keystone State&quot; was back to her regular runs between Philadelphia and Savannah within a month.

In November 1855 the Philadelphia and Savannah Steam Navigation Company came to the conclusion that there was not enough business for two ships on the route, and switched &quot;State of Georgia&quot; to sailing between Philadelphia and Charleston, South Carolina. &quot;Keystone State&quot; continued her service to Savannah.

&quot;Keystone State&quot; primarily carried agricultural commodities north. In August 1855 she brought 3,300 sacks of wheat to Philadelphia. In November 1856 her cargo included 104 bales of cotton, and in December 1856, 50 casks of rice. In return, the ship carried a variety of manufactured or processed goods south. In March 1861 her cargo for Charleston included 950 barrels of whiskey, 350 hogsheads of bacon, 750 barrels of beer, 260 bales of cloth, 200 barrels of flour, 300 packages of boots and shoes, 100 cases of hats and caps, 70 carriages, and 250 boxes of candles.

At approximately 2 am on 18 August 1857 &quot;Keystone State&quot; hit and sank the barge &quot;A. Groves, jr.&quot; which was under tow by the tug &quot;Artisan&quot; in the Delaware River. The owner of the barge sued the Philadelphia and Savannah Steam Navigation Company claiming that &quot;Keystone State&quot; should have maneuvered to avoid the collision. The case ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court which found in favor of &quot;Keystone State&quot;, and reaffirmed maritime rules of the road that remain in place today.

On 7 September 1857 the ship was bound for Savannah, 75 miles south of Cape Henlopen, when the side lever on her steam engine broke. She had to be towed to Norfolk, where her passengers debarked, and then was towed back to Philadelphia for repairs. She was back in operation the next month. She suffered another engine failure due to a broken side lever in June 1860 and was out of service for about a month while repairs were made in Philadelphia.

The Philadelphia and Savannah Line ceased operations at the beginning of 1858 due to a lack of business, and the ship was idled. March 1858 found &quot;Keystone State&quot; making her first trip from Philadelphia to Charleston, South Carolina. Cabin fare on this new route was $15 and steerage $5. In the tensions leading to the Civil War, sailing between Philadelphia and Charleston became more difficult. In November 1860, &quot;Keystone State&quot; was required to lower the United States flag and fly the Palmetto Flag before she could sail into Charleston. At the beginning of 1861 United States army troops in Charleston prepared for hostilities by consolidating on Fort Sumter. The army released the civilian workers at the Charleston forts, and about 100 took passage north on &quot;Keystone State&quot;. The ship continued to sail to Charleston right to the brink of the war. She arrived back in Philadelphia on her last civilian trip to the south on 10 April 1861.

==Civil War service (18611865)==

=== Navy charter (1861) ===
Secessionists began bombarding Fort Sumter on 12 April 1861. The Union Navy was largely unprepared for war and reacted by acquiring civilian ships. Acting on orders from Commodore Hiram Paulding, the commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Captain Samuel F. DuPont, chartered &quot;Keystone State&quot; for naval service on 19 April 1861. DuPont received the order in the morning and chartered the ship in three hours. Her charter rate was $600 per day. She was towed to the Navy Yard that day, and even during the tow machinists worked to convert her to a naval vessel. At 6 pm that evening DuPont began loading her with more than 50 Marines, 50 sailors, ammunition, seven days of coal, and two weeks of provisions. The ship was armed with four 24-pounder guns. She sailed at dawn on 20 April 1861, under the command of Lieutenant Maxwell Woodhull, to deliver arms and troops to Washington, D.C.

On her way to Washington, &quot;Keystone State&quot; arrived off the Norfolk Navy Yard on the morning of 21 April 1861, by which time it was aflame to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Confederacy. She worked with several other Navy ships to extricate USS &quot;Cumberland&quot; from the docks through the obstacles placed by the Confederates, and helped evacuate sailors from the Navy Yard and USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. She reached Washington on 23 April 1861. On 24 April 1861, now under the command of Lieutenant Stephen D. Trenchard, she was ordered to New York to take on supplies, and then to sail to back Washington, D.C. The ship arrived in Washington on 1 May 1861. On 3 May 1861 &quot;Keystone State&quot; embarked gun carriages and ordinance supplies from the Washington Arsenal for delivery to Fort Washington and Fortress Monroe. She then sailed back to New York to pick up yet more supplies to reinforce Washington, including five guns. She reached Washington on 14 May 1861.

President Lincoln imposed a blockade of Confederate ports on 19 April 1861. The announcement caught a number of foreign vessels in port. As they sailed home, many were snapped up by the Union Navy. The British brig &quot;Hiawatha&quot; was heavily laden with tobacco when she sailed for Liverpool on 19 May 1861. USS &quot;Minnesota&quot;, part of the blockading force based on Fortress Monroe, fired two shots at her and then sent a prize crew aboard to take possession. &quot;Hiawatha&quot; was towed to New York by &quot;Keystone State,&quot; arriving on 23 May 1861. On board, &quot;Keystone State&quot; had 115 women and children who were fleeing the conflict in the South, mostly from the Norfolk area. On that same day she was ordered to sail to Philadelphia to be returned to her owners, ending her charter.

Still short of ships, the Navy purchased &quot;Keystone State&quot; for $125,000 on June 10, 1861. She was moved to the Philadelphia Navy Yard where she underwent a survey of needed repairs beginning the next day. Repairs began within a week of acquisition, and included dry-docking and replacing the copper sheeting on her hull. Her battery was upgraded to four 32-pounder guns.

She was commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 19 July 1861, Commander Gustavus H. Scott in command.

===Gulf Blockading Squadron (1861)===
Upon commissioning, &quot;Keystone State&quot; was assigned to the Gulf Blockading Squadron. She sailed from Philadelphia in search of the commerce raider CSS &quot;Sumter&quot;. The chase went from Kingston, Jamaica to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. She then circumnavigated Puerto Rico, stopping in Martinique along the way. &quot;Keystone State&quot; sailed to Port of Spain, Trinidad, where she found that she had missed &quot;Sumter&quot; by five days. She visited many other Caribbean ports and sailed as far south as Aspinwall, Panama before returning to the United States. While she failed in her mission to stop the &quot;Sumter&quot;, she did capture a blockade runner. The steamer &quot;Salvor&quot; was sailing from Havana to Tampa with a cargo that included 600 pistols and 500,000 percussion caps when she was captured by &quot;Keystone State&quot; near the Dry Tortugas on 14 October 1861. The ship returned to Philadelphia, via Key West, with &quot;Salvor&quot; in tow, on 25 October 1861.

While Keystone State was at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, she had her armament upgraded again. She was equipped with six 8-inch guns, two 32-pounders, and a Parrott rifle.

At Philadelphia, Commander William E. Le Roy took command of the ship on 12 November 1861. The sidewheeler left port on 8 December 1861. She visited Bermuda still searching for &quot;Sumter&quot;, and arrived back at Fortress Monroe on 26 December 1861 with nothing to show for her cruise but two cases of smallpox.

===South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, (1861–1863)===

In January 1862 &quot;Keystone State&quot; was assigned to South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Her first assignment was to blockade the port of Fernandina, Florida. She engaged Confederate batteries at Amelia Island while on station, apparently with little damage on either side. &quot;Keystone State&quot; captured the British schooner &quot;Mars&quot; off Fenandina on 5 February 1862. She was laden with a cargo of salt.

In March 1862, &quot;Keystone State&quot; was part of Flag Officer DuPont&#x27;s fleet which captured Fernandina and the surrounding islands, putting an end to the need to blockade the port.

On her next cruise, she was assigned to blockade the port of Georgetown, South Carolina. On 10 April 1862, she chased schooner &quot;Liverpool&quot; of Nassau ashore where she was burned to the water&#x27;s edge. Schooner &quot;Dixie,&quot; bound for Nassau with a cargo of 100 bales of cotton, 234 barrels of turpentine, 40 bushels of peanuts, and 3,000 pounds of rice, was captured on 15 April 1862.

After returning to port for coal and supplies, &quot;Keystone State&quot; returned to blockade duty, this time off Charleston. On 29 May 1862 she captured the British steamer &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; in bound from Nassau with 50 crates of Enfield rifles in cargo. The schooner &quot;Cora&quot; was taken two days later. &quot;Keystone State&quot; took schooner &quot;Sarah,&quot; laden with cotton, and &quot;Catalina&quot;, off Charleston on 20 June 1862. She captured the schooner &quot;Fanny&quot; attempting to slip into Charleston with a cargo of salt on 22 August 1862. &quot;Keystone State&quot; participated in the capture of schooner &quot;Annie Dees&quot; on 17 November 1862.
At dawn on 31 January 1863, &quot;Keystone State&quot; was at anchor, part of the blockading force off Charleston Harbor. Two Confederate ironclads, CSS &quot;Palmetto State&quot; and CSS &quot;Chicora&quot; came out of the early morning fog to challenge the Union ships. They attacked USS &quot;Mercedita&quot; and succeeded in ramming her, disabling her machinery, and killing several of her crew. They turned next to &quot;Keystone State,&quot; which was hit by ten shells&quot;.&quot; At approximately 6 am, a shot ripped into &quot;Keystone State&quot;″s steam drum, killing 19 men and wounding a further 20. Since she carried a crew of 163 men, her losses were a quarter of the crew. USS &quot;Housatanic&quot; engaged the ironclads, which retired to Charleston, but &quot;Keystone State&quot; was on fire, leaking badly, and had two feet of water in the hold. She was taken under tow by USS &quot;Memphis&quot; and reached Port Royal, South Carolina, where temporary repairs were made.

The ship got underway on 22 February 1863 for blockading duty off St. Simons Sound, Georgia. She served there until departing for Philadelphia on 2 June 1863 for permanent repairs. &quot;Keystone State&quot; was found to be &quot;very much out of order&quot; on her arrival at the Navy Yard and faced months of work. She was decommissioned on 10 June 1863 and her crew given a 10-day furlough. The ship was hauled out in a floating drydock to repair hull damage from her encounter with the Confederate ironclads. Her engines were overhauled.

===North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, 1863–1865===
&quot;Keystone State&quot; was recommissioned on 3 October 1863, Commander Edward Donaldson in command, and stood out to sea on 27 October. Three days later she joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Wilmington, North Carolina. Sometime around the turn of the year, Donaldson yielded command of the ship to Commander Pierce Crosby. By this point in the war, Wilmington was the last major Confederate port, concentrating both blockaders are blockade runners alike. &quot;Keystone State&quot; participated in the capture of six ships during her final year of blockade duty including the steamer &quot;Margaret and Jessie&quot; in 1863, and &quot;Caledonia&quot;, &quot;Rouen&quot;, &quot;Lilian&quot;, &quot;Elsie&quot;, and &quot;Siren&quot; in 1864&quot;.&quot;

The ships captured by &quot;Keystone State&quot; not only helped the war effort, but were profitable for the ship&#x27;s crew as well. Under the laws of the day, special courts evaluated whether ships were captured legally, which ships had participated in their capture, and how much the captured ships were worth, net of expenses. Prize courts then awarded cash in the form of prize money to ship&#x27;s crews. &quot;Keystone State&quot; was lucky in prize money: 

In addition to participating in the capture of sixteen ships listed above, &quot;Keystone State&quot; also plucked from the sea almost 300 bales of cotton thrown overboard by blockade runners seeking to destroy valuables that would fall into the hands of their captors. These generated almost $200,000 of prize money for &quot;Keystone State&quot;.

====First Battle of Fort Fisher, December 1864====
In order to finally close Wilmington to blockade runners, the Union determined to take the forts on the Cape Fear River, starting with Fort Fisher. Admiral David Porter assembled a fleet at Fortress Monroe for the offensive. Porter commanded &quot;Keystone State,&quot; now captained by Commander Henry Rolando, to lead the reserve line of battle. At 7:30 am on 24 December 1864 Rolando signalled the reserve division to get underway, and by 8:00 am the ships were steaming westward towards Fort Fisher in line of battle. At 2:52 pm &quot;Keystone State&quot; began firing over and between the ships in the first echelon, to support Army troops as they landed and fought to take the fort. She ceased firing at approximately 5:00 pm. During this action she fired 56 rounds from her 30-pounder Parrott rifle, 24 rounds from her 50-pounder Parrott rifle and 14 rounds from the 32-pounder broadside gun. However, late in the afternoon, the Union Army commander, General Benjamin Franklin Butler, decided that the Confederate works could not be taken and ordered his troops to reembark. &quot;Keystone State&quot; withdrew to Beaufort for coal and supplies.

====Second Battle of Fort Fisher, January 1865====
Porter immediately began planning for a second assault, this time with a different Army general in charge of the land forces. Most of the fleet that participated in the first battle also joined the second fight. &quot;Keystone State&quot; was one of three exceptions. She was loading coal in Beaufort when the fort fell. She arrived at the scene of the battle on 16 January 1865 with a coal schooner in tow.

After Fort Fisher fell, the campaign to take Wilmington continued on the river. On 20 January 1865, Keystone State towed the monitor &quot;Monadanock&quot; over the Cape Fear River bar. Admiral Porter requested use of the monitor &quot;Montauk&quot; for the final assault on Wilmington, and &quot;Keystone State&quot; was assigned to tow the ship up the Cape Fear River on 21 January 1865. During February 1865, &quot;Keystone State&quot; supported Army advances along the shore of the River.

Porter&#x27;s success in closing the last major Confederate port meant that blockaders such as &quot;Keystone State&quot; no longer had a role to play. She got underway on 13 March 1865 towing monitor to Hampton Roads, and arrived at Baltimore, Maryland, on 20 March 1865.

Commander Rolando was detached from the ship and &quot;Keystone State&quot; decommissioned on 25 March 1865. She was sold at auction at Washington, D.C., on 15 September 1865 to Marshall O. Roberts for $54,000.

== Commercial service (18661872) ==

=== North American Steamship Company (18661868) ===
Marshall Roberts led a commercial shipping business which sailed between New York and San Francisco via ships in the Atlantic and Pacific connected by an overland crossing of Nicaragua. He sent &quot;Keystone State&quot; to the Morgan Iron Works in New York to be converted into a civilian merchant vessel suitable for this trade. The ship was renamed &quot;San Francisco.&quot; Roberts sold control of the company to William H. Webb in 1866 and it became known as the North American Steamship Company. &quot;San Francisco&quot; completed multiple trips between New York and Greytown, Nicaragua before the company closed in 1868.

=== New York and Mexican Mail Steamship Line (18661869) ===
Beginning in July 1868, Webb chartered &quot;San Francisco&quot; to the New York and Mexican Mail Steamship Line owned by Francois Alexandre. She sailed from New York to Havana, Cuba to Sisal, Mexico, and finally to Vera Cruz, Mexico, before returning to New York. Her last run on this route was in February 1869.

=== Bermuda (18701872) ===
The government of Bermuda solicited offers for regular steamship service between New York and Hamilton. Webb offered &quot;San Francisco&quot; in response to the tender offer. The ship arrived in Hamilton on 7 August 1870 for inspection, as required by Bermudian law. It was not clear that a ship of her size could enter Hamilton Harbor, and in fact, she grounded on her first attempt. A more experienced pilot guided her in safely, however, and the ship was accepted by the government. Thereafter &quot;San Francisco&quot; completed two roundtrips per month between New York and Hamilton. A first-class passage in either direction cost $30, and a steerage berth cost $15. The government of Bermuda paid Webb 240 pounds sterling per round-trip as a subsidy. This original contract was set to expire on 31 December 1871, but Webb won a renewal in November 1871.

Concern over &quot;San Francisco&#x27;s&quot; ability to enter Hamilton was well founded. She went aground again on 18 September 1870. While entering Hamilton Harbor on 5 December 1870, the ship hit a rock and sank in 15 feet of water. She was refloated and repaired at the Royal Naval Dockyard.

&quot;San Francisco&quot; brought people, mail, news, food, and manufactured goods of all kinds to Bermuda. She was so important to the island that the Colonial Secretary ordered a special flag to be flown from government telegraph stations from the moment the ship was first sighted inbound to Hamilton. The ship was significant to the export economy of Bermuda as well. On 22 April 1871 she cleared Hamilton with the single largest cargo that had ever been shipped from the island, over 9,000 barrels and 20,000 boxes of various crops. While Bermuda was a colony of Great Britain, there was no direct steamship service between the two islands. Thus, British government officials sailed the Atlantic to New York, and then completed their trip to Bermuda aboard &quot;San Francisco&quot;. In May, 1871, the ship received a 17-gun salute from the Royal Artillery at Fort Albert upon arrival in Hamilton with Major General John Henry Lefroy, the new governor, aboard.

Webb&#x27;s renewal application in November 1871 stated that the 240 pound sterling per round-trip subsidy was not enough to cover his losses operating &quot;San Francisco&quot; on the route, and he expected that the government would work to improve the profitability. Apparently, the situation did not improve and Webb notified the government in late December 1872 that he would abandon the route in January 1873.

== &quot;San Francisco&quot; scrapped (1874) ==
Webb found no further use for the ship and there are no newspaper accounts of her sailing again after returning from Bermuda. On 8 July 1874 &quot;San Francisco&quot; cleared New York for Fall River, Massachusetts. She was towed there by the tug &quot;Cora L. Staples&quot;. She was broken up in Fall River.

<text>Dalkey Archive Press is an American publisher of fiction, poetry, foreign translations and literary criticism specializing in the publication or republication of lesser-known, often avant-garde works. The company has offices in Funks Grove, Illinois, in Dublin, and in London. The publisher is named for the novel &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot;, by the Irish author Flann O&#x27;Brien. It is owned by nonprofit publisher Deep Vellum.

Founded in Elmwood Park, Illinois in 1984 by John O’Brien, Dalkey Archive Press began as an adjunct press to the literary magazine &quot;Review of Contemporary Fiction&quot;, itself founded by John O&#x27;Brien, John Byrne, and Lowell Dunlap and dedicated to highlighting writers who were overlooked by the mainstream critical establishment. Initially, the press reprinted works by authors featured in the &quot;Review&quot; but eventually branched out to other works, including original works that had not been published. Until 1988, Dalkey Archive was a two-person operation: O’Brien and office manager/typesetter Shirley Geever. That year O’Brien hired Steven Moore as managing editor. Later editors include Chad Post (who went on to found Open Letter Books), and authors Martin Riker, Danielle Dutton, and Jeremy Davies.

In 1992, the press accepted an invitation to move from suburban Chicago to Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois. In December 2006, Dalkey Archive relocated to University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to be part of the university&#x27;s commitment to global projects that complement the press&#x27;s commitment to translations.

Modeled on such publishers as Grove Press and New Directions, Dalkey Archive&#x27;s emphasis is decidedly upon literary fiction, usually of a modernist or postmodernist bent. In the publisher&#x27;s own words, Dalkey Archive &quot;place[s] a heavy emphasis upon fiction that belongs to the experimental tradition of Sterne, Joyce, Rabelais, Flann O&#x27;Brien, Beckett, Gertrude Stein and Djuna Barnes.&quot; One of the publisher&#x27;s primary goals is to keep all of its books in print, regardless of their commercial success, in the interest of maintaining the availability of works that it deems culturally and educationally valuable.

In 2011, Dalkey founder John O’Brien was awarded the Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Book Critics Circle. In 2015, O’Brien was appointed Chevalier in the Ordre des Arts &amp; des Lettres in recognition of his significant contribution to French arts and literature by the Minister of Culture and Communication of France; its authors and translators have been recipients of many major awards, including the Nobel Prize, the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize, the Helen and Kurt Wolff Translator&#x27;s Prize, the Vondel Prize, and the Premio Valle-Inclán award.

Founder and publisher John O’Brien died on November 21, 2020. He left behind 7 dogs, daughter Kathleen O’Brien, sons Emmett, William, and Kevin, brothers Chip and Eddie, and many other family and friends. Shortly afterward, Dalkey Archive Press was acquired by Deep Vellum.

<text>Retha Marvine Warnicke (born 1939) is an American historian and Professor of History at Arizona State University.

==Career==
Warnicke graduated with a BA from Indiana University, magna cum laude, in 1961. She then moved on to Harvard University, where she earned her MA and PhD in 1963 and 1969, respectively. During her junior year, she joined Phi Beta Kappa and in her senior year, she was granted the Listenfelt Scholarship, for outstanding Undergraduate History Major, following in 1961 with the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.

From 1965 to 1966, Warnicke was an instructor at Phoenix College. She went on to teach at Arizona State University (ASU) as a lecturer from 1966 to 1967. She then left to pursue her PhD before returning to ASU to continue as a lecturer from 1969 to 1973. Warnicke rose through the ranks to assistant professor, then associate professor and finally professor in 1973, 1976 and 1984, respectively. She was the director of graduate studies at the history department from 1987 to 1992, and she was chair of the history department from 1992 to 1998.

Warnicke was the first woman hired in the history department of ASU, and was one of the first to teach a women&#x27;s history course. Through her advocacy, lobbying efforts and participation in numerous search committees, the history department began to add women and minority men to the department – and as a result, the history department is nearly half female and has a large minority presence. In addition to her efforts in the history department, Warnicke has also devoted much of her time to affirmative action and faculty rights.

Warnicke specializes in politics and protocol at the Tudor court, women&#x27;s issues in the Early Modern Period (1400 – c. 1700) and Jacobean funerary rites for women. She authored numerous articles, including &quot;Inventing the Wicked Women of Tudor England: Alice More, Anne Boleyn and Anne Stanhope&quot; and &quot;Sexual Heresy at the Court of Henry VIII&quot;. Warnicke is the author of seven monographs, including &quot;The Marrying of Anne of Cleves: Royal Protocol in Tudor England&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 2002), &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (Routledge, 2006), and &quot;Wicked Women of Tudor England: Queens, Aristocrats, and Commoners&quot; (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012). Her most recent book is &quot;Elizabeth of York and Her Six Daughters-in-Law: Fashioning Tudor Queenship, 1485–1547&quot; (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017). The newest book examines the lives and reigns of Elizabeth of York, wife of Henry VII, and her six daughters-in-law, Henry VIII&#x27;s six queens, by comparing them within important spheres of influence—as mothers, diplomats, and domestic managers, as well as participants in social and religious rituals.

She is best known for her controversial theories over the life of Henry VIII&#x27;s second wife, Anne Boleyn. These theories were outlined in various articles in the mid-1980s, &quot;Anne Boleyn&#x27;s Childhood and Adolescence&quot; and &quot;Sexual Heresy at the Court of Henry VIII&quot;. The theories were built on and elaborated in her 1989 book &quot;The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn: Family politics at the court of Henry VIII&quot;.

==Warnicke&#x27;s theories on Anne Boleyn==
* She argued against the general theory that Anne Boleyn was born around 1501. Instead, she believes that Anne was born much later—in the summer of 1507.
* The popular rumours that Anne had several small deformities—like an extra fingernail or moles—are incorrect, since rumours of deformities only began after Anne&#x27;s death and no-one who met her ever commented on them;—&quot;... the two [descriptions] cannot logically be reconciled to each other. Had there been even a hint of a deformity in Anne&#x27;s appearance, the Venetian, as well as the Imperial ambassadors...would have eagerly revealed this intriguing fact to their respective governments.&quot;
* &quot;For many historians Anne remains the lady with the extra fingernail who was too flirtatious, even if in a harmless courtly way, for her own safety and well being. The result of this interpretation is that the responsibility for her tragic death resides with her, the victim, rather than with the king and his ministers, the ones who orchestrated her execution.&quot;
* Most importantly, she argues that Anne miscarried a deformed fetus in January 1536 which fueled 16th-century fears of witchcraft and sexual deviance and led to her execution—&quot;In an attempt to understand her by the terms of her society, information from a wide range of sources will be used to support the argument that she miscarried a defective fetus in 1536. It was because Henry VIII viewed this mishap as an evil omen, both for his lineage and his kingdom, that he had her accused of engaging in illicit sexual acts with five men and fostered rumors that she had afflicted him with impotence and had conspired to poison both his daughter Mary and his illegitimate son, Henry, Duke of Richmond.&quot;

Warnicke&#x27;s theories were harshly criticised by some other historians—particularly E. W. Ives and George W. Bernard. She defended her arguments in a 1993 article &quot;The Fall of Anne Boleyn Revisited&quot;, although she did not insist on some points as rigorously as before. She suggested that Ives&#x27;s theory on Anne&#x27;s fall (that it was caused by foreign policy and palace politics) was based on an over-reliance on Spanish sources and that his theory on her youth was ridiculous. Warnicke was even harsher with G.W. Bernard&#x27;s suggestion that Anne might have been guilty of adultery in 1536. She called it a &quot;dubious assertion&quot; with no reliable documentary proof. She concluded:

As long as the lurid charges against the Queen exist only in unsubstantiated indictments and contradictory diplomatic writings, historians ought to remain sceptical about factional theories of her adulterous guilt or of factional politics. At the least, they owe it to the past not to further obscure the facts.

In her &quot;author&#x27;s note&quot; to bestseller &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;, Philippa Gregory said her novel&#x27;s conclusion was based upon Warnicke&#x27;s findings in &quot;The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn&quot;, but Warnicke has publicly distanced herself from the novel and its presentation of the Boleyns.

<doc id="1260292" wikidata="Q7802123" url="?curid=1260292" title="Tiled printing">
<text>Tiled printing is a method that computer programs use to enable users to print images larger than a standard page. This method was popularized by a program called The Rasterbator. A tiled printing program overlays a grid on the printed image in which each cell (or tile) is the size of a printed page, and then prints each tile. A person can then arrange the tiles to reconstruct the full image.

Tiled printing has been widespread since the days of mainframe computers. An early example is the Unix codice_1 program which created very large printable text banners out of ASCII characters in some Unix variants. Programs were available to convert images to ASCII art that when printed large enough and viewed sufficiently far away, appeared to be smoothly shaded. Modern software may use halftoning to achieve a similar effect.

Another form of tiled printing, inspired by continuous feed printers, involves making a long message of letters, possibly with inline graphics of the same height, and printing it sideways over several pages to make a banner. This type of printing is usually associated with The Print Shop, a 1980s software package.

Since high-resolution images are used to create the prints, a large amount of ink is used in the process. Ink jet printers are used to make tiled printouts without sacrificing the resolution of the original image at reasonable cost. These decorations are sometimes called &quot;rasterbations&quot;, after a popular tiled printing program, &quot;The Rasterbator.&quot; The Rasterbator program accepts users images and divides them into a grid format. Users can specify how big the final product should be, in terms of pages. The application then produces PDF images that when printed out, form the entire picture.

==World records==
Rasterbation is often the subject of record-breaking attempts to create the largest and most impressive tiled prints. The title of the world&#x27;s largest rasterbation was previously held by &quot;the Doomtech crew&quot;. However, in June 2007 the graduating class of the University of Toronto Schools, a Toronto high school, produced a rasterbation incorporating 1462 sheets of &quot;×14&quot; legal-sized paper. This achievement surpassed the previous record by over two hundred sheets, but then was overtaken by a group from Groton School in May 2008. The Groton School Rasterbation used more than 1500 sheets of 11x14&quot; paper and was 100&#x27; tall, making it the largest ever.

In June 2012, another graduating class from the University of Toronto Schools produced 74 rasterbations in one night, each incorporating 143 sheets of ×11&quot; letter-sized paper, for a record-shattering total of 10,582 sheets. Each rasterbation included the face of one of the graduating students with a doorway cut out of his or her gaping mouth - altogether, they created a corridor of mouths throughout the school&#x27;s hallways.

In March 2013, a rasterbation of Edvard Munchs iconic painting The Scream was created at Norway&#x27;s largest computer party The Gathering (TG), as part of the art project &quot;Scream from nature&quot;. It is the largest known reprint of any Munch painting. The rasterbation, made by the crew at Sørlanet, consisted of 1,517 (37 × 41) sheets of A4 paper, and measured .

<text>Basil Eldon &quot;Buzz&quot; Hargrove (born March 8, 1944) is a Canadian labour leader and the former National President of the Canadian Auto Workers. He is currently serving as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at Toronto Metropolitan University&#x27;s Ted Rogers School of Management.

Born in Bath, New Brunswick, Hargrove first became involved in the automotive sector as a line worker for the Chrysler assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario. He succeeded Bob White as president of the CAW in 1992. On July 8, 2008, he announced his intention to retire, before he turned 65, in September 2008. The CAW National Executive Board and staff endorsed then CAW Local 444 president Ken Lewenza to replace Hargrove as National President, and on September 6, 2008, Lewenza was formally elected to the position at a special union convention.

In 1998, Hargrove co-authored the book &quot;Labour of Love: The Fight to Create a More Humane Canada&quot; with Wayne Skene. Also in 1998, Brock University honoured him with a Doctorate of Laws degree. He has received honorary doctorates from the University of Windsor in 2003, from Wilfrid Laurier University in 2004, from the University of New Brunswick in 2008, and from Queen&#x27;s University in 2009. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Hargrove is seen as a proponent of social unionism, and his supporters claim that he has steered the CAW to become a more activist union. In the field of electoral politics, however, under his leadership the CAW has broken from its longtime support for the left-wing New Democratic Party and lent increasing support instead for the Liberal Party of Canada.

Hargrove is married to Denise Small, a mediation officer for the Ontario Labour Relations Board.

==1999 Ontario election==
Hargrove was the leading advocate of tactical voting (sometimes also called &quot;strategic voting&quot;) in the 1999 Ontario provincial election. Hargrove proposed this approach in an attempt to defeat the Progressive Conservative Party government of Mike Harris. Hargrove&#x27;s support for this approach, and his union&#x27;s subsequent commitment of resources in its pursuit, marked the CAW&#x27;s first major departure from its previous policy of unconditional support of the Ontario New Democratic Party, although the CAW had been somewhat estranged from the Ontario NDP ever since the union had opposed the &quot;Social Contract&quot; austerity measures imposed by the previous 1990-1995 Bob Rae NDP government. The 1999 election, however, was the first time that the union did not at least formally endorse the NDP, instead urging its members (and all voters) to vote for the candidate, NDP or Liberal, that had the best chance of defeating the Progressive Conservative candidate.

Tactical voting not only failed to prevent the re-election of the Tories to another majority government but also was blamed by New Democrats for the party&#x27;s poor electoral performance, returning only 9 Members of Provincial Parliament, down from 17 in the 1995 election.

An attempt, following the 1999 Ontario election, to expel Hargrove from the Ontario NDP was defeated, but Hargrove&#x27;s relationship with provincial leader Howard Hampton remained acrimonious.

==Federal politics pre–2006==

Hargrove was also a long-time critic of federal NDP leader Alexa McDonough, calling for her resignation on several occasions. He criticized McDonough for her effort at modernizing federal NDP policy, which involved moving towards the political centre and adopting &quot;Third Way&quot; policies. Hargrove stated repeatedly that NDP should move to the left instead.

In 2002, he planned to run for the NDP leadership, but found a &quot;notable lack of enthusiasm&quot; for his potential candidacy. He instead endorsed CAW lawyer Joe Comartin who placed fourth.

Hargrove was initially much more publicly supportive of McDonough&#x27;s successor, Jack Layton, and the CAW unequivocally supported the federal NDP in the 2004 federal election. The NDP made significant gains in popular vote but gained only 5 seats for a total of 19, well short of its aspirations of 40 or more.

Hargrove reportedly played a role in bringing Prime Minister Paul Martin and Jack Layton together to negotiate a budget agreement to keep the federal Liberal government in power in exchange for including NDP proposals in the 2005 federal budget.

However, Hargrove sharply criticized Layton when he joined with Conservative leader Stephen Harper and Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe to bring down the Liberal government with a vote of non-confidence in November 2005. He also echoed his earlier criticism of McDonough by suggesting that Layton, too, was not sufficiently moving the party to the left. The eventual bringing down of the Liberal minority government led to a Conservative minority in the subsequent election.

==2006 federal election==
===Tactical voting===
For the 2006 Canadian federal election, Hargrove resumed his previous endorsement of tactical voting and urged CAW members (and all voters) to vote for the candidate, NDP or Liberal had the best chance of defeating the Conservative candidate. During the final days of the 2006 campaign, Hargrove urged all progressive voters in Canada to vote Liberal, which he claimed was the only party that could prevent the Conservative Party of Canada from winning the election. He publicly stated that &quot;ideology does not matter&quot; when the reporter asked about his position.

Despite the qualification of his stated support for NDP incumbents and candidates in 40 &quot;winnable&quot; ridings, Hargrove&#x27;s speech was widely reported by the media as an endorsement of the Liberals. When questioned by a reporter on this, Hargrove also stated that he &quot;did not like the campaign that Jack Layton was running,&quot; criticizing Layton for &quot;spending too much time attacking the Liberals.&quot;
 No doubt his photo-op appearance with Paul Martin in matching CAW jackets contributed to this impression. He has been reported as saying that voters should support incumbent NDP MPs and NDP candidates in ridings &quot;where they can defeat the Conservatives.&quot;

===Break with NDP===
Hargrove&#x27;s strategy caused some controversy among long-time NDP activists and union members who saw him as reneging on core labour and left-wing values. In response, they carried anti-Hargrove placards at rallies and distributed buttons with the slogan: &quot;Buzz Off. I&#x27;m voting NDP.&quot;

Traditional NDP supporters were also opposed to aligning their movement with the Liberals, who were embroiled in the Sponsorship and income trust scandals.

Despite being one of Hargrove&#x27;s 40 endorsed NDP candidates, Sid Ryan, president of the Ontario chapter of the Canadian Union of Public Employees and the candidate for Oshawa, blamed his loss on tactical voting. Ryan claimed Hargrove&#x27;s statement confused potential NDP supporters in his riding and caused some of them to vote Liberal even though the Liberal candidate was not a viable contender. A poll in Oshawa found that the proportion of voters sampled who initially planned to vote for Ryan before switching their support to the third-place Liberal candidate late in the campaign (thinking it might help prevent a national Conservative victory) significantly exceeded the narrow margin of Ryan&#x27;s loss - if the poll is accurate then the tactic did indeed result in Tory Colin Carrie&#x27;s election.

Some pointed out that Hargrove&#x27;s call for strategic voting has also caused financial harm to the NDP under Canada&#x27;s system of public financing for federal elections, which pays a subsidy to each federal party based on their popular vote.

===Controversy===
On January 18, 2006, Hargrove made a widely criticized speech at a Liberal rally in Ontario where he urged voters in Quebec to vote for the Bloc Québécois in preference to the Conservatives, calling Conservative leader Stephen Harper&#x27;s view of Canada &quot;a separatist view&quot; and recommending &quot;anything to stop the Tories&quot;. The statements forced Liberal leader Paul Martin to defend Harper later in the day by saying &quot;I have profound differences with Mr. Harper, but I have never questioned his patriotism&quot;. Afterwards, many commentators viewed Hargrove as having been an active hindrance to the gaffe-filled Liberal campaign.

Hargrove also attacked the principles of Albertans, and Stephen Harper in particular (though Harper was actually born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, moving to Alberta only in his early twenties), saying &quot;His sense, is about Alberta, where the wealth in Alberta, everyone recognizes, is much greater than it is anywhere in Canada. The principles that (Harper&#x27;s) brought up with, and believes in coming out of there, don&#x27;t sit well with the rest of Canada.&quot;
===Results===
Near the end of the 2006 campaign, sensing the momentum that would result in a Conservative victory, NDP leader Jack Layton defied Paul Martin and Hargrove&#x27;s pleas to unite all progressive voters under the Liberal banner. Layton intensified his attacks on the Liberal scandals, while also pledging to use the NDP&#x27;s clout in a minority government to &quot;keep the Conservatives in check&quot;.

The NDP increased their caucus to 29 seats, a significant gain over the 2004 election. Hargrove afterwards argued that strategic voting had prevented the Conservatives from forming a majority government and suggested that the three main opposition parties could form a coalition to get several key pieces of legislation passed.

===Suspension from the NDP===

Following the election, on February 11, 2006, the provincial executive body of the Ontario NDP voted to suspend Hargrove&#x27;s NDP membership and effectively expel him from the party for supporting the Liberals. This move also automatically suspended his membership in the federal party; the NDP, unlike other major Canadian parties, is integrated at the federal and provincial/territorial levels. Hargrove stated he was &quot;shocked and surprised&quot; by this decision, but he would not apologize for his actions during the 2006 election nor would he commit not to endorse candidates for other parties in the future. On February 23, 2006, Hargrove also confirmed that he would not appeal the Ontario NDP executive body&#x27;s decision.

The CAW retaliated against the NDP for Hargrove&#x27;s suspension by severing all union ties with the Party, a move formalized at the CAW&#x27;s 2006 convention.

==2006 CAW leadership race==

On December 9, 2005, Hargrove confirmed that he would seek a sixth and final three-year term as CAW President at the union&#x27;s convention in Vancouver, British Columbia, in August, 2006. This would be the final term that Hargrove would be eligible to serve under the CAW constitution, which provides for mandatory retirement at age 65. Hargrove was to be 62 years old at the time of the upcoming CAW convention.

On February 8, 2006, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; reported rumours that, for the first time, Hargrove may face an opposing candidate for the CAW presidency. CAW Local 1256 chair and Oakville and District Labour Council President Willie Lambert was subsequently confirmed as an opposition candidate. In 1999, Lambert won the support of over 40% of voting delegates at that year&#x27;s Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) convention, in an unsuccessful challenge to Wayne Samuelson for the OFL presidency.

On February 13, 2006, the CAW&#x27;s former chief economist Sam Gindin raised a series of questions about the political, electoral and bargaining orientation of the CAW in an open letter addressed to Hargrove. That letter, Hargrove&#x27;s response and Gindin&#x27;s response to Hargrove were posted on the Canadian political website &quot;rabble&quot;. Gindin later wrote another piece criticizing recent bargaining concessions by the CAW at the General Motors plant in Oshawa, Ontario, which was published in the Socialist Project bulletin on March 22.

On May 22, 2006, auto parts workers at A.G. Simpson in Oshawa, Ontario, went on strike against their employer. Hargrove characterized the dispute as a &quot;wildcat&quot; (unauthorized) strike and criticized the workers involved, describing the situation as a &quot;powder keg&quot; that threatened other auto workers jobs. Hargrove&#x27;s rival Lambert, however, fully supported the workers, joining the picket line and condemning Hargrove&#x27;s conduct in an open letter. The labour dispute was successfully resolved on May 25, 2006, although the workers involved remained critical of Hargrove and the National CAW&#x27;s interventions.

On June 22, 2006, the executive committee of CAW Local 1256, Lambert&#x27;s home local, adopted a motion to reconsider its support for Lambert&#x27;s campaign and lend support instead to Hargrove. Lambert alleges that the local executive took this action at the prompting of Hargrove&#x27;s executive assistant, Hemi Mitic, who allegedly threatened to dissolve Local 1256 and merge it into the larger CAW Local 707. Both Mitic and the local union president, James MacKenzie, deny this allegation. The motion to reconsider support for Lambert was overwhelmingly defeated by the general membership of Local 1256 on July 9, 2006, confirming that Local 1256 continued to support Lambert.

The CAW&#x27;s Constitutional Convention, at which the leadership election was scheduled to occur, took place Tuesday, August 15 through Friday, August 18 at the Vancouver Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre. Delegates were scheduled to vote for CAW executive officers on Thursday, August 17. However, on Wednesday, August 16, the union announced that Lambert had withdrawn his candidacy for CAW president, leaving Hargrove unopposed. This was, however, a half-truth. According to standard union practice, candidates for CAW offices must be nominated before they can run. As Lambert was not himself a delegate, the decision on whether or not he was able to contest the presidency fell to the nearly 1000 elected delegates present. Since no one came forward, even delegates from his own local which had recently declared its unanimous support for his candidacy-—Lambert was effectively barred from contesting the leadership and Hargrove was therefore acclaimed for another term.

Basking in the glow of his &quot;victory&quot;, Hargrove concluded his acceptance speech by proposing to his long-time girlfriend Denise Small. Small accepted. The two were subsequently married at a small, private ceremony in Toronto on December 22, 2007.

Hargorve criticized the Ontario legislature when all three parties (Liberals, Progressive Conservatives, and NDP) passed emergency back-to-work legislation, after a wildcat strike by the Toronto Transit Commission union.

==2007 Ontario election==

In the 2007 Ontario provincial election the CAW as a union again endorsed strategic voting. Hargrove, however, again went further to slam both the NDP and its leader, Howard Hampton. He told the editorial board of the Toronto Star that the NDP had &quot;lost complete touch&quot; with the people of Ontario and that he saw &quot;absolutely no reason to vote NDP.&quot; Hargrove then went on to lavish praise on the Ontario Liberals, claiming the party had been &quot;more left than the NDP over the last four years&quot; and predicting left-leaning voters would vote Liberal in the upcoming election. The Ontario Liberal Party ultimately won a second consecutive majority government.

<text>Kara Lynn Joyce (born October 25, 1985), is an American former competition swimmer and four-time Olympic silver medalist. She competed as a member of the United States Olympic Team at the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympics.

==Early years==
Joyce was born in Brooklyn, New York. She split her high school years between Irondequoit, New York at Eastridge High School, Webster, New York and Ann Arbor, Michigan, where the family relocated to in 2001. It was in Ann Arbor that Joyce began training with Club Wolverine under Jon Urbanchek. Joyce also chose to compete for her high school team, the Ann Arbor Pioneers. In her senior year of high school, she set five Michigan high school state records, four of which were national high school records at the time. (Her state records are in the 50-yard, 100-yard and 200-yard freestyle as well as the 200-yard and 400-yard freestyle relays. While only able to swim a total of four events, Joyce set the 50-yard freestyle record by leading-off the 200-yard freestyle relay.)

In total, Joyce broke five national high school records.

==College career==
Joyce attended the University of Georgia (UGA), where she swam for coach Jack Bauerle&#x27;s Georgia Bulldogs swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition from 2004 to 2007. During her first year, Joyce won two individual NCAA championships (50-meter and 100-meter freestyle, short course), and helped Georgia to its third consecutive national runner-up finish. As a sophomore, she along with junior Mary DeScenza led Georgia to its first NCAA Women&#x27;s Swimming and Diving Championship in four years and defended her individual titles in the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle, as well as adding a fourth place in the 200-yard freestyle. Joyce was also a key swimmer on four of Georgia&#x27;s five NCAA Championship relays. En route to their victory, the Bulldogs became the first team in NCAA swimming history to win all five relays.

During the 2006 NCAA Championships, contested at UGA&#x27;s Gabrielsen Natatorium, Joyce led the Bulldogs to a second-place finish with five NCAA titles and Swimmer of the Year honors. On the first day of the meet, she broke the American record in the 50-yard freestyle, previously held by former Bulldog Maritza Correia. Joyce defended her 100-yard freestyle title and added to that with a win in the 200-yard freestyle. By winning all three, she became the first swimmer in the 25-year history of the Women&#x27;s NCAA Championships to win the 50-yard, 100-yard, and 200-yard freestyle events.

Joyce earned All-American honors three consecutive years. She was the recipient of the 2006–07 Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year.

==International career==

===2004 Athens Summer Olympics===

At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Joyce earned a pair of silver medals as a member of the 4×100-meter freestyle and the 4×100-meter medley relays. In her individual events, Joyce finished fifth in both the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle races.

===2005 World Aquatics Championships===
At the 2005 World Aquatics Championships, Joyce received a bronze medal competing in 4×100-meter freestyle relay.

===2007 World Aquatics Championships===
===2008 Beijing Summer Olympics===
At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Joyce once again earned a pair of silver medals as a member of the 4×100-meter freestyle and the 4×100-meter medley relays. In her individual event, Joyce finished sixth in the 50-meter freestyle.

===2012 Summer Olympics===
At the 2012 United States Olympic Trials in Omaha, Nebraska, the qualifying meet for the U.S. Olympic team, Joyce qualified for her third Olympics by finishing second in the 50-meter freestyle with a time of 24.73 seconds. Additionally, she placed 18th in the heats of the 100-meter freestyle.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Joyce posted a time 25.28 seconds in Heat 8 of the 50-meter freestyle, forcing her into a swim-off with two other competitors for the sixteenth and final spot in the 50-meter semi-finals. Spurred on by the home crowd, British competitor Amy Smith won the swimoff with a time of 24.82, ending Joyce&#x27;s participation in the event.

<text>Manzanera is a small town and municipality in the province of Teruel, part of the autonomous community of Aragón, Spain. It is in the Gúdar-Javalambre comarca and it has 540 people. It is close to the ski area called Javalambre.

== Geography ==
Manzanera is a settlement located in the South of Aragon, at an altitude of above sea level in the Sierra de Javalambra, where the tallest point of the province is located as well as one of the tallest of the Iberian System, near the Province of Castellón. It enjoys a continental Mediterranean climate with cold winters and mild summers.

The municipality is composed of various settlements besides the main nucleus of Manzanera, these are Los Cerezos, Alcotas, El Paúl, Los Olmos, Las Alhambras, and Paraíso Bajo; as well as some uninhabited neighbourhoods such as Torre de Alcotas, Torre de los Peones, and Paraíso Alto. There are several country houses, called &quot;masías&quot;, scattered throughout the municipal limits. Manzanera is located about from Teruel and from Valencia, the nearest highways are the A-23 and N-234, found from town. 

The River Albentosa, a tributary of the River Mijares, flows through Manzanera. The river forms just one kilometre before reaching town after the union of the small rivers called Torrijas (which in turn just received the waters from the River Paraíso) and Los Olmos.

<doc id="1260328" wikidata="Q7054302" url="?curid=1260328" title="North Bronx">
<text>The North Bronx is the northern section of the Bronx, one of the five boroughs of New York City. It is bordered by Westchester County to the north, the South Bronx to the south, the Hudson River to the west and the Long Island Sound to the east. The western part is more urbanized and hilly than its eastern counterpart, just like the rest of the borough. Despite being recognized as different from the South Bronx, the actual borders of the North Bronx is undefined. One commonly set border is Fordham Road/Pelham Parkway, the upper limit for widespread poverty and arson during the 1970s and 1980s.

Overall, the North Bronx is better off than the South Bronx despite gentrification occurring in both. The North Bronx has the affluent cluster of neighborhoods centered around Riverdale, including the former, Fieldston, Spuyten Duyvil, Hudson Hills, and to a lesser extent, Kingsbridge. The North Bronx is home to the largest shopping district along Fordham Road, with shops as far west as University Avenue and as east as Third Avenue. Tracey Towers, the second tallest buildings in the Bronx are located here. Only the Harlem River Park Towers are taller, at 404 feet compared to 400 feet for Tracey Towers. However, the North Bronx is home to the largest housing development in Co-op City.

Neighborhoods include Riverdale, Bedford Park, Fordham, Norwood, Woodlawn Heights, Wakefield, Baychester, and Co-op City.

==History==
European contact with the Bronx first occurred almost 400 years ago. In 1609, Henry Hudson, probably the first European to see the shoreline, sought cover from a storm for his vessel the Halve Maen in Spuyten Duyvil Creek. Thirty years later in 1639, the mainland was settled by Jonas Bronck, a Swedish sea captain from the Netherlands who eventually built a farmstead at what became 132nd Street and Lincoln Avenue; a small group of Dutch, German, and Danish servants settled with him.

Most of the eastern half of the area now known as the Bronx was bought in 1654 by Thomas Pell (named for Pelham Bay, Bronx) of Connecticut, who invited sixteen families to form the village of Westchester near what is now Westchester Square. Westchester was between 1683 and 1714 the seat of Westchester County (which included the Bronx until the second half of the nineteenth century) and as a chartered borough was the only town in the colony with an elected mayor. In addition, it was the first town without a property qualification for suffrage: settlers chose a representative to the provincial assembly and had their own municipal court. Horses, cattle, sheep and wheat were the main agricultural products and a cottage industry in cloth making thrived.

During English rule most inhabitants were English, of English descent, or Dutch. Anglicanism was the religion sanctioned by colonial law, but Presbyterians, Quakers, and members of the Dutch Reformed church were in the majority. The first blacks, slaves from the West Indies, soon made up 10 to 15 percent of the population. Native Americans left the area soon after 1700.

The North Bronx saw constant conflict During the American Revolution. Battle of Pell Point 18 about 750 men led Colonel John Glover Marblehead Massachusetts stayed march four thousand and Hessians enabling evacuate his White Plains In Westchester. For much rest war Bronx remained hands was subjected raids rebels that caused widespread destruction. November 1783, however Governor Clinton began a from Van Cortlandt Mansion take possession New York City departing English.

During the early nineteenth century the chief occupations of lower Westchester County were growing wheat and raising livestock; between 1800 and 1830 the population rose from 1755 to 3023. Severe famine in Ireland and the growth of industry and commerce in the city drew thousands of Irish to the Bronx as laborers.

Many Irish immigrants were employed in the construction of the High Bridge over the Harlem River, the New York and Harlem Railroad, and the Croton Aqueduct. Much of the area consisted of fertile lands that yielded fruits, vegetables, and dairy products for sale in the city. The first railroad tracks were laid over these lands, and rural stations eventually became the centers of new villages such as Melrose, Tremont, and Riverdale, Bronx.

After the Second World War, new housing was built and the makeup of the population changed. Construction ranged from luxury apartment buildings in Riverdale to public housing in the southern Bronx. Longtime residents and former servicemen moved from older housing into privately built housing in the North Bronx. As commuting by automobile became more convenient, high-rise apartment building were erected in neighborhoods along the new roads, including Spuyten Duyvil and Riverdale. Co-op City, a complex of 15,372 units built in the North Bronx between 1968 and 1970, housed sixty thousand people and was among the largest housing developments in the world.

<text>Lalitpur Metropolitan City (, ), also known as Patan (, ), Yala (), and Manigal, is a metropolitan city and fourth most populous city of Nepal with 299,843 inhabitants living in 49,044 households per the 2021 census. It is located in the south-central part of Kathmandu Valley, a large valley in the high plateaus in central Nepal, at an altitude of 1,400 metres (4,600 feet).

It is best known for its rich cultural heritage, particularly its tradition of arts and crafts. It has a multi-ethnic population with a Hindu and Buddhist majority. Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu. Tourism is an important part of the city&#x27;s economy and it is renowned for its festivals and feasts, ancient art, and the making of metallic, wood and stone statues. Lalitpur is also home to Patan Durbar Square, which has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

== Etymology and culture ==
One of the most used and typical Newar names of Lalitpur is &quot;Yala.&quot; It is said that King Yalamber or Yellung Hang named this city after himself, and ever since this ancient city was known as Yala. There are many legends about its name. The most popular one is the legend of the god Rato Machhindranath (also known as Bunga Dyah), who was brought to the valley from Kamaru Kamachhya, located in Assam, India, by a group of three people representing the three kingdoms centered in the Kathmandu Valley. One of them was called Lalit, a farmer who carried god Rato Machhindranath to the valley all the way from Assam, India. The purpose of bringing the god Rato Machhindranath to the valley was to overcome the worst drought there. There was a strong belief that the god Rato Machhindranath would bring rain in the valley. It was due to Lalit&#x27;s effort that the god Rato Machhindranath was settled in Lalitpur. Many believe that the name of the town is kept after his name &quot;Lalit&quot; and &quot;pur&quot; meaning township.

In May, a chariot festival honoring the deity known as Bunga Dyah Jatra is held in Patan. It is the longest and one of the most important religious celebrations in Patan. During the month-long festival, an idol of Rato Machhendanath is placed on a tall chariot and pulled through the city streets in stages.

==History==

=== Ancient history ===
Lalitpur is believed to have been founded in 249 BC by the Emperor Ashoka. It was further expanded by the Mallas during the medieval period.

Later Lalitpur is said to have been re-established by King Veer Deva in 299 AD, but there is unanimity among scholars that Patan was a well established and developed town since ancient times. Several historical records including many other legends indicate that Patan is the oldest of all the cities of Kathmandu Valley. According to a very old Kirat chronicle, Patan was founded by Kirat rulers long before the Licchavi rulers came into the political scene in Kathmandu Valley. According to that chronicle, the earliest known capital of Kirat rulers was Thankot. Kathmandu, the present capital was most possibly removed from Thankot to Patan after the Kirati King Yalamber came into power sometimes around second century AD.

=== Malla era ===
The Licchavi era was followed by the Malla era. Rulers from Tirhut, upon being attacked by the Delhi Sultanate, fled north to the Kathmandu valley. They intermarried with Nepali royalty, and this led to the Malla era. The early years of the Malla era were turbulent, with raids and attacks from Khas and Turk Muslims. There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu&#x27;s population, including the king Abhaya Malla. These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era (such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan), and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city. Despite the initial hardships, Kathmandu rose to prominence again and, during most of the Malla era, dominated the trade between India and Tibet. Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade.

During the later part of the Malla era, Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities: Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur. These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal. These states competed with each other in the arts, architecture, esthetics, and trade, resulting in tremendous development. The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings, squares, and temples, as well as the development of waterspouts, the institutionalisation of trusts (called guthis), the codification of laws, the writing of dramas, and the performance of plays in city squares. Evidence of an influx of ideas from India, Tibet, China, Persia, and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king Pratap Malla. Books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition (e.g. Tantrakhyan), medicine (e.g. Haramekhala), religion (e.g. Mooldevshashidev), law, morals, and history. Amarkosh, a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD, was also found. Architecturally notable buildings from this era include Kathmandu Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the former durbar of Kirtipur, Nyatapola, Kumbheshwar, the Krishna temple, and others.

=== Modern era ===
In 1768, Lalitpur was annexed to the Gorkha Kingdom by Prithvi Narayan Shah without any battle.

==Geography==
Lalitpur is on the elevated tract of land in Kathmandu Valley on the south side of the Bagmati River, which separates it from the city of Kathmandu on the northern and western side. The Karmanasa Khola acts as the boundary on the eastern side. It was developed on relatively thin layers of deposited clay and gravel in the central part of a dried ancient lake known as the Nagdaha. The city has an area of 15.43 square kilometres and is divided into 29 municipal wards.
===Climate===
Climate is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfa&quot; (Humid Subtropical Climate).

==Historical monuments==

The city was initially designed in the shape of the Buddhist Dharma-Chakra (Wheel of Righteousness). The four &quot;thurs&quot; or mounds on the perimeter of Patan are ascribed around, one at each corner of its cardinal points, which are popularly known as Asoka Stupas. Legend has it that Emperor Asoka (the legendary King of India) visited with his daughter Charumati to Kathmandu in 250 BC and erected five Asoka Stupas, four in the surrounding and one at the middle of the Patan. The size and shape of these stupas seem to breathe their antiquity in a real sense. There are more than 1,200 Buddhist monuments of various shapes and sizes scattered in and around the city.

The most important monument of the city is Patan Durbar Square, which has been listed by UNESCO as one of seven Monument Zones that make up the Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site. The seven monument zones were included in the World Heritage List in 1979 as one integrated site. The monument zones are declared as protected and preserved according to the Monuments Preservation Act of 1956. The Square was heavily damaged on 25 April 2015 by an earthquake.

Lalitpur was planned in Vihars and Bahils. Out of 295 Vihars and Bahils of the valley 56% of them are in Patan. The water conduits, stone spouts, jaladroni (water tanks), artistic gate ways, Hindu temples and Buddhist Vihars adorn the city.

Connection to Kathmandu over the Bagmati River is provided by a host of road and pedestrian bridges.

<text>Charlie Dominici (June 16, 1951 – November 2023) was an American singer, best known as the second vocalist for the progressive metal band Dream Theater, having replaced Chris Collins (while the band was called Majesty) and later being replaced by James LaBrie. Dominici fronted his own self-named progressive metal band, that released three albums.

==Biography==
Charlie Dominici was born in Brooklyn, New York, and soon after moved with his family to the Five Towns region in Nassau County, Long Island. His album debut was with folk duo Billy and Charles (consisting of Dominici and Carly Simon collaborator Billy Mernit) in 1970. Professionally, he came into prominence as a member of Franke and the Knockouts, in which he played guitar and sang backing vocals. He auditioned for Dream Theater in 1987 and was hired for the job in November of that year.

Dominici performed on the band&#x27;s debut album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot;. However, Dominici was older than the rest of the band and there were personal and creative differences at work. It was felt that, despite being a very talented singer, his decidedly &quot;pop&quot; vocal style did not fit in with the distinctive progressive direction that the band&#x27;s compositions were taking. According to Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, &quot;It was like having Billy Joel singing in Queensrÿche.&quot; A good singer in the wrong band, they amicably parted ways shortly thereafter.

Dominici remained in contact with Dream Theater throughout their career, despite lapsing out of the music business and obtaining a job as a finance manager in the automobile business. Dominici was hired by Mike Portnoy to sing at his wedding to Marlene Apuzzo. He started working on an album with his brother, guitarist Kane Daily, that never saw the light of day. In 2003, he released a song on his website titled &quot;Now the Time Has Come&quot; but it was taken down after a few months, and the track did not feature any guitars, only piano.

Dominici&#x27;s voice was also heard on the YtseJam Records release &quot;When Dream and Day Unite Demos&quot; which featured pre-production and vocal demos of several songs, as well as Dominici singing Beatles covers and the traditional Christmas song &quot;O Holy Night&quot;.

On March 6, 2004, Dominici joined his former bandmates onstage in Los Angeles for the first time in 15 years for a special performance celebrating the 15th anniversary of the band&#x27;s first album, singing on &quot;To Live Forever&quot; (a non-album track written in the same time period) and &quot;Metropolis&quot; along with LaBrie and former keyboardist Derek Sherinian. This performance was later released as &quot;When Dream and Day Reunite&quot;, the DVD version which also features footage from the band&#x27;s 1989 tour with Dominici.

Despite having not actively sung since leaving Dream Theater in 1989, this performance gave him the itch to make music again and in 2005, he released a solo album entitled &quot;O3: A Trilogy, Part 1&quot;, the first album of a three-album concept piece. The second installment of the trilogy was released in February 2007 and the final part was released in April 2008.

Dominici opened for Dream Theater at three shows at their Chaos in Motion Tour in June 2007.

On November 17, 2023, Dominici&#x27;s former Dream Theater bandmates announced that he died at the age of 72.

<text>Ferdinand Ludwig Adam von Saar (30 September 1833 in Vienna, Austria – 24 July 1906 in Döbling) was an Austrian novelist, playwright and poet.

Together with Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach he was one of the most important realistic writers in the German language of the late 19th century in Austria. His work was set to music by composer Pauline Volkstein.

<text>In fluid mechanics, a splash is a sudden disturbance to the otherwise quiescent free surface of a liquid (usually water). The disturbance is typically caused by a solid object suddenly hitting the surface, although splashes can occur in which moving liquid supplies the energy. This use of the word is onomatopoeic; in the past, the term &quot;plash&quot; has also been used. 

Splash also happens when a liquid droplet impacts on a liquid or a solid surface; in this case, a symmetric &quot;corona&quot; (resembling a coronet) is usually formed as shown in Harold Edgerton&#x27;s famous milk splash photography, as milk is opaque. Historically, Worthington (1908) was the first one who systematically investigated the splash dynamics using photographs.

Splashes are characterized by transient ballistic flow, and are governed by the Reynolds number and the Weber number. In the image of a brick splashing into water, one can identify freely moving airborne water droplets, a phenomenon typical of high Reynolds number flows; the intricate non-spherical shapes of the droplets show that the Weber number is high. Also seen are entrained air bubbles in the body of the water, and an expanding ring of disturbance propagating away from the impact site.

Sand is said to splash if hit sufficiently hard (see dry quicksand) and sometimes the impact of a meteorite is referred to as splashing, if small bits of ejecta are formed.

Physicist Lei Xu and coworkers at the University of Chicago discovered that the splash due to the impact of a small drop of ethanol onto a dry solid surface could be suppressed by reducing the pressure below a specific threshold. For drops of diameter 3.4 mm falling through air, this pressure was about 20 kilopascals, or 0.2 atmosphere.

A plate made of a hard material on which a stream of liquid is designed to fall is called a &quot;splash plate&quot;. It may serve to protect the ground from erosion by falling water, such as beneath an artificial waterfall or water outlet in soft ground. Splash plates are also part of spray nozzles, such as in irrigation sprinkler systems.

<doc id="1260391" wikidata="Q71427061" url="?curid=1260391" title="Jimmy Thomas">
<text>Jimmy Thomas (January 20, 1939 – April 25, 2022) was an American soul singer and songwriter. He was best known as a vocalist for Ike Turner. Thomas joined Turner&#x27;s Kings of Rhythm in 1958, and remained with the band when the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue was formed in 1960. He released solo singles on Turner&#x27;s labels Sue, Sputnik, and Sonja Records. After his departure from Turner, Thomas continued recording as a solo artist, eventually relocating to London. He formed his own label, Osceola Records, in 1979.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===
Thomas was born in Osceola, Arkansas on January 20, 1939. Raised by his aunt and uncle, Thomas grew up listening to blues musicians such as Big Maceo, Tampa Red, Walter Davis, and Sonny Boy Williamson. In his teens, Thomas formed his first band called the Rock and Roll Trays. They performed popular R&amp;B and blues tunes in clubs around Osceola. In 1958, Albert King recommended that Thomas travel to East St. Louis and audition for a spot as a vocalist in Ike Turner&#x27;s band the Kings of Rhythm.

=== Kings of Rhythm ===
By 1956, Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm were one of the most popular live attractions in the St. Louis and East St. Louis club scene. In 1958, Turner was looking for a new vocalist following the departure of Clayton Love. Thomas replaced Love and was soon joined by singer Tommy Hodge. Around the time Thomas and Hodge joined the Kings of Rhythm, Turner shifted from his usual blues oriented sound to producing R&amp;B material. That year, Thomas made his recording debut during the group&#x27;s Cobra Records sessions in Chicago. He was featured on Turner&#x27;s singles released on Stevens Records in 1959. In St. Louis, Thomas also performed with Benny Sharp, Eugene Neal, and Albert King.

=== Ike and Tina Turner Revue ===
In 1960, Turner wrote &quot;A Fool in Love&quot; for Art Lassiter. When Lassiter failed to show up for the recording session, one of Turner&#x27;s background vocalists, Little Ann, sang the lead. Little Ann was renamed Tina Turner, and the single was released on Sue Records. Following the success of the single, Turner formed the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue which included the Kings of Rhythm and a trio of female vocalists called the Ikettes. In 1961, Thomas and Ikette Wilhelmina Weaver (as Jimmy &amp; Jean) released the single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe&quot; / &quot;I Want Marry You&quot; on Sue. After Ike &amp; Tina had a string of hit records, Turner relocated the band to Los Angeles in 1962. When the hits dried up they began to tour vigorously. Thomas recalled, &quot;We would only be in L.A. three months out of the year, we be touring like nine months.&quot; Since they couldn&#x27;t rely on records, the revue strengthened their live act by added dance routines. Thomas and Tina Turner would change the routines and have dance battles onstage.

In 1962, Thomas released his single &quot;You Can Go&quot;/&quot;Hurry And Come Home&quot; on Sue Records. In between touring, Turner formed multiple record labels to release singles. Thomas released solo singles on Turner&#x27;s labels Sputnik and Sonja. In 1964, the revue released their first live album, &quot;Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue Live&quot;, which features Thomas&#x27; rendition of &quot;Feel So Good&quot; by Junior Parker. His rendition of &quot;Down In The Valley&quot; is included on the revue&#x27;s follow-up live album, &quot;Live! The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Show&quot;, released in 1965.

=== Solo career ===
While the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue were touring the UK with the Rolling Stones in 1966, Thomas befriended producers Denny Cordell and Tony Visconti, who invited him to learn production. Thomas released the single &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will (There&#x27;s a Way)&quot; on Mirwood Records in 1966. After leaving Ike &amp; Tina Turner, he worked local jobs in Los Angeles before relocating to London in 1969. He began producing his own solo records such as the Northern soul classic &quot;The Beautiful Night&quot; released on Parlophone in 1969. In 1973, Thomas wrote and produced a solo LP, &quot;Abyss&quot;, released on Contempo, a London label owned by John Abbey, founder of &quot;Blues and Soul&quot; magazine. Thomas formed his own label, Osceola Records, in 1979.

Beginning in the 1970s, Thomas provided background vocals for various acts, including Gary Wright, David Essex, Voyage, Mikael Rickfors, Lloyd Cole &amp; The Commotions, Madness, Miguel Bosé, Blue Mercedes, and Kevin Rowland.

=== Death ===
His death in April 2022 was confirmed online by his friend P. P. Arnold.

<text>East Anglian English is a dialect of English spoken in East Anglia, primarily in or before the mid-20th century. East Anglian English has had a very considerable input into modern Estuary English. However, it has received little attention from the media and is not easily recognised by people from other parts of the United Kingdom. The dialect&#x27;s boundaries are not uniformly agreed upon; for instance, the Fens were traditionally an uninhabited area that was difficult to cross, so there was little dialect contact between the two sides of the Fens leading to certain internal distinctions within that region.

Linguist Peter Trudgill has identified several sub-dialects, including Norfolk (Broad Norfolk, Norwich), Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, and various Fenland dialects.

== History ==
In Jacek Fisiak&#x27;s and Peter Trudgill&#x27;s book, &quot;East Anglian English,&quot; they describe the important influence East Anglian English has had on the development of the English language. In addition to its influence in the Standard English that is known today all around England, there is evidence according to Oxford English Dictionary that East Anglian English grammar was heard in North Carolina.

Very little is known about the Anglo-Saxon East Anglian dialect; a Suffolk charter (of Æthelflæd, before 991) is included in . S. L. Bensusan set out to record elements of the East Anglian dialect and records a statement made by a local when she caught him making notes on the sleeve of his shirt: &quot;Whatever you bin makin&#x27; them little owd squiggles on y&#x27;r cuff fower?&quot; Bensusan replied that he was &quot;writing history&quot;. He then recorded her retort: &quot;You dedn&#x27;t wanter done that. Telly f&#x27;r why. When you&#x27;ve got y&#x27;r shirt washed there won&#x27;t be nawthen left. I&#x27;ve never wrote nawthen all me born days, ne yet me husban&#x27;, an he got all his teeth an&#x27; I kin thread me needle without spectacles. Folk don&#x27;t wanter write in this world, they wanter do a job o&#x27; work.&quot;

Trudgill identifies possible influences as the Viking occupation of the area and the Dutch protestant refugees, the Strangers.

== Grammar ==

* Third-person singular zero is the lack of &quot;-s&quot; in third-person verb conjugations and is considered as the &quot;best-known dialect feature&quot; of East Anglian English. Examples include &quot;she go&quot; or &quot;that say&quot;.
* Use of the word &quot;do&quot; with the meaning of &quot;or&quot;, &quot;or else&quot; &quot;otherwise&quot;, for example &quot;You better go to bed now, do you’ll be tired in the morning&quot; And &quot;do&quot; idiomatically used as &quot;now you must&quot; 
* &quot;That&quot; is used in place of central pronoun &quot;it&quot;, e.g. &quot;that&#x27;s cloudy&quot;, &quot;that&#x27;s hot out there&quot; and &quot;that book, that&#x27;s okay, I like it&quot;. The final example still uses &quot;it&quot;, but only when it is the object of a verb. The word &quot;that&quot; usually denotes &quot;it&quot; when &quot;it&quot; is the subject of the clause, so that &quot;it is&quot; becomes &quot;that is&quot; and &quot;it smells funny&quot; becomes &quot;that smell funny&quot;. This does not imply emphatic usage as it would in Standard English and indeed sentences such as &quot;When that rain, we get wet&quot;, are entirely feasible in the dialect. (Incidentally, &quot;it&quot; is almost never heard as the first word of a sentence in the speech of a true Norfolk dialect speaker, e.g. &quot;It&#x27;s a nice day today&quot; is virtually always rendered by &quot;Thass a nice day today&quot;.) 
* &quot;Time&quot; is used to mean &quot;while&quot;, for example, &quot;You sit down, time I get dinner ready.&quot;
* &quot;Now&quot; can also mean &quot;just&quot;, i.e. &quot;I am now leaving&quot; also means &quot;I am just leaving&quot;.
* Some verbs conjugate differently in Norfolk or Suffolk. The past tense of &#x27;show&#x27;, for example is &#x27;shew&#x27;, and of the verb to snow, &#x27;snew&#x27;, swam becomes &#x27;swum&#x27;. The past of drive is &#x27;driv&#x27;. e.g. &#x27;I driv all the way to Yarmouth, and on the way back that snew.&#x27; &#x27;Sang&#x27; is always &#x27;sung&#x27; (&#x27;She sung out of tune&#x27;), and &#x27;stank&#x27; is always &#x27;stunk&#x27; (&#x27;After they had mucked out the pigs their clothes stunk&#x27;). Many verbs simply have no past tense, and use the present form. e.g. &#x27;Come&#x27;, &#x27;say&#x27; and &#x27;give&#x27;. &#x27;When my husband come home, he say he give tuppence for a loaf of bread&#x27; meaning &#x27;When he came home, he said, he gave tuppence...&#x27;. This even applies to a verb like &#x27;go&#x27;. &#x27;Every time they go get the needle out, it moved&#x27;. Verbs whose past participles differ from their active past tenses e.g. &#x27;spoken&#x27;, are mostly ignored in Norfolk. e.g. &#x27;If you were clever you were spoke to more often by the teacher&#x27;, or &#x27;If I hadn&#x27;t went up to Mousehold that night&#x27;.
* The present participle, or ...ing, form of the verb, such as running, writing etc. is mostly rendered in the Middle English form of &#x27;a-runnin&quot;, &#x27;a-jumpin&quot; etc. &#x27;She&#x27;s a-robbin&#x27; me&#x27;.

== Accent ==

East Anglian English shows some of the general accent features of South East England, including:
*Non-rhoticity; in fact, one of the first English-speaking regions to lose rhoticity; 
*G-dropping; 
*The trap–bath split, though the quality of may be fronter than RP;
*The foot–strut split, though the quality of , , may be more back and close than that of RP; 
*Widespread glottal reinforcement of stop consonants, so that are pronounced with the glottal closure slightly following the oral closure, so that &quot;upper&quot; is pronounced as , &quot;better&quot; as or now commonly , and &quot;thicker&quot; as .
However, several features also make East Anglian accents unique:

=== Vowels ===
* Norfolk smoothing results in a pronunciation of two or three vowel syllables with a single long vowel; for example, &quot;player&quot; is rather than . Where the suffix &quot;-ing&quot; is preceded by a vowel or diphthong, there is a smoothing effect that results in a single vowel. Thus &quot;go+ing&quot; is usually pronounced as a single syllable rather than as a two-syllable word ending in , and &quot;doing&quot; is rather than . This phenomenon is the only one in East Anglia that is spreading, in the 21st century, from north to south (the opposite direction from the typical south-to-north influences coming out of London).
* The vowel found in // is a very front vowel , unlike RP or London English where it is a back vowel.
* Words containing sounds (as in ) can be more fronted or raised compared against most other English dialects: often, or .
* Single-syllable words with the vowel spelt such as &quot;roof&quot; and &quot;hoof&quot; have the vowel to give and respectively.
* The toe–tow merger typical of most Modern English dialects may continue to be resisted. The vowel ( in RP) generally has a quality that can be represented with a narrow glide like in Norfolk: thus words with the spelling , and such as &quot;boat&quot;, &quot;toe&quot;, &quot;code&quot; sound to outsiders like &quot;boot&quot;, &quot;too&quot;, &quot;cood&quot; respectively. An exception is that of words spelt with , , such as &quot;soul&quot;, &quot;know&quot;, &quot;told&quot; which have a wider glide quite similar to the RP , or even wider . However, the toe-tow merger is indeed well-established in Ipswich (Suffolk) and Colchester (Essex), in the 21st century expanding gradually into Norfolk.
** A third phonetic distinction once existed within the set, causing a subset of these words (specifically, certain closed- and single-syllable words), such as &quot;coat&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;home&quot;, &quot;stone&quot;, and &quot;whole&quot; to be pronounced with . Thus, &quot;whole&quot; was a homophone with &quot;hull&quot;: . This was extremely old-fashioned even by the late 20th century.
* The pane–pain merger typical of most Modern English dialects may continue to be resisted. In the speech of older Norwich residents and in rural East Anglia, the vowel, , is in words spelt with or such as &quot;rain&quot; and &quot;day&quot;, but or (similar to &quot;air&quot;) in words spelt such as &quot;take&quot;, &quot;late&quot;. This has largely given way throughout most of East Anglia to a merger towards .
* The near-square merger variably occurs, particularly among the working class, so that the and vowels and sound the same in Norwich. Thus &quot;beer&quot; and &quot;bear&quot; sound the same, the vowel quality being . This may be considered to be a related case to that of smoothing.
* as in is pronounced or : . Since the mid-20th century, this very open realisation has largely disappeared, at least in urban East Anglia.
* (as in ) is traditionally , a narrower glide than RP, but since the second half of the 20th century, a backer realisation is favoured, .

=== Consonants ===
*Yod-dropping occurs after all consonants. Yod-dropping after alveolar consonants () is found in many English accents, and widely in American pronunciation, so that words like &quot;tune&quot;, &quot;due&quot;, &quot;sue&quot;, &quot;new&quot; are pronounced , , , , sounding like &quot;toon&quot;, &quot;doo&quot;, &quot;soo&quot;, &quot;noo&quot;. Additionally, in East Anglia, yod-dropping is found after any consonant, and this seems to be a unique regionalism. Therefore, RP is pronounced as Norfolk (where stands for any consonant). For example, &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;few&quot;, &quot;huge&quot;, &quot;accuse&quot; have pronunciations that sound like &quot;bootiful&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;hooge&quot;, &quot;akooz&quot;. A parallel case involves the vowel of : in RP the word is pronounced with initial , but Norfolk speakers omit the and smoothing results in so that &quot;cure&quot; sounds like &quot;cur&quot;.
* H-dropping is rarer than in most other parts of England. (However, H-dropping is indeed typical in urban Norwich.)
* Clear L is possible in all contexts in speakers born before 1920. In contexts where RP pronounces as &quot;dark L&quot; , these older Norfolk speakers have &quot;clear L&quot; so that the sound in &quot;hill&quot; and &quot;milk&quot; sounds similar to the clear L heard at the beginning of words such as &quot;lip&quot;. The process known as L-vocalization (whereby, for example, the in &quot;hill&quot;, &quot;well&quot;, &quot;help&quot; is pronounced as a back rounded vowel like ) is not as widespread in this accent as elsewhere in Southern England, though it is increasingly prevalent in Suffolk.

=== Prosody ===
In addition to the above phonological features, East Anglian English also has a distinct rhythm. This is due to the loss of unstressed syllables associated with East Anglian speakers. There appears to be no agreed framework for describing the prosodic characteristics of different dialects (see Intonation). Writing in 1889, the phonetician Alexander John Ellis began his section on East Anglian speech with these comments:

There does appear to be agreement that the Norfolk accent has a distinctive rhythm due to some stressed vowels being longer than their equivalents in RP and some unstressed vowels being much shorter. Claims that Norfolk speech has intonation with a distinctive &quot;lilt&quot; lack robust empirical evidence.

===Norwich accent===
In addition to above features, one specific accent is associated with urban Norfolk and namely its largest city, Norwich.
* Whereas RP has the rounded vowel in words containing the spellings , , or (such as &quot;often&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, &quot;cough&quot;, &quot;trough&quot; and &quot;cloth&quot;), Norfolk may have as in the vowel of . This is a manifestation of the lot-cloth split.
* The vowel of is traditionally realised as an unrounded vowel . However, the rounded RP variant is encroaching even in urban Norwich.
* In older Norfolk dialect the spelling could be pronounced as and the spelling as ; thus &quot;three&quot; sounds the same as &quot;tree&quot; and &quot;shriek&quot; is pronounced as .
* Norfolk smoothing (mentioned above) is particularly advanced.

==Portrayal==

The treatment of the Norfolk dialect in the television drama &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; in 1999 in part prompted the foundation of the Friends of Norfolk Dialect (FOND), a group formed with the aim of preserving and promoting Broad Norfolk.

Arnold Wesker&#x27;s 1958 play &quot;Roots&quot; used Norfolk dialect.

During the 1960s, Anglia Television produced a soap opera called &quot;Weavers Green&quot; which used local characters making extensive use of Norfolk dialect. The programme was filmed at the &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; village of Heydon, north of Reepham in mid Norfolk.

An example of the Norfolk accent and vocabulary can be heard in the songs by Allan Smethurst, aka The Singing Postman. Smethurst&#x27;s Norfolk accent is well known from his releases of the 1960s, such as &quot;Hev Yew Gotta Loight Bor?&quot;. The &quot;Boy John Letters&quot; of Sidney Grapes, which were originally published in the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot;, are another valid example of the Norfolk dialect. Beyond simply portrayers of speech and idiom however, Smethurst, and more especially Grapes, record their authentic understanding of mid-20th century Norfolk village life. Grapes&#x27; characters, the Boy John, Aunt Agatha, Granfar, and Ole Missus W, perform a literary operetta celebrating down-to-earth ordinariness over bourgeois affectation and pretence.

Charles Dickens had some grasp of the Norfolk accent which he utilised in the speech of the Yarmouth fishermen, Ham and Daniel Peggoty in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. Patricia Poussa analyses the speech of these characters in her article &quot;Dickens as Sociolinguist&quot;. She makes connections between Scandinavian languages and the particular variant of Norfolk dialect spoken in the Flegg area around Great Yarmouth, a place of known Viking settlement. Significantly, the use of &#x27;that&#x27; meaning &#x27;it&#x27;, is used as an example of this apparent connection.

The publication in 2006 by Ethel George (with Carole and Michael Blackwell) of &quot;The Seventeenth Child&quot; provides a written record of spoken dialect, though in this case of a person brought up inside the city of Norwich. Ethel George was born in 1914, and in 2006 provided the Blackwells with extensive tape-recorded recollections of her childhood as the seventeenth offspring of a relatively poor Norwich family. Carole Blackwell has reproduced a highly literal written rendering of this.

An erudite and comprehensive study of the dialect, by Norfolk native and professor of sociolinguistics Peter Trudgill can be found in his book &quot;The Norfolk Dialect&quot; (2003), published as part of the &#x27;Norfolk Origins&#x27; series by Poppyland Publishing, Cromer.

<doc id="1260395" wikidata="Q2070261" url="?curid=1260395" title="Percy Jocelyn">
<text>The Rt Rev. and Hon. Percy Jocelyn (29 November 1764 – 3 September 1843) was Anglican Bishop of Clogher in the Church of Ireland from 1820 to 1822. He was forced from his position due to being caught in homosexual practices, which had been outlawed under the Buggery Act 1533.

==Early life==
He was the third son of The 1st Earl of Roden, whose family estates were in Castlewellan, County Down, by his wife Lady Anne Hamilton. He graduated with a B.A. from Trinity College Dublin. At Trinity, he was regarded as something of a bookworm, spending much of his time in his rooms on Library Square. He was later described as &quot;a tall thin young man with a pale, meagre and melancholy countenance, and so reserved in his manners and recluse in his habits that he was considered by everybody to be both proud and unsociable&quot;.

==Career==
He was rector of Tamlaght, archdeacon of Ross (1788–1790), treasurer of Armagh (1790–1809), a prebend of Lismore (1796–1809), and bishop of Ferns and Leighlin (1809–1820) before becoming bishop of Clogher.

===1811 scandal===
In 1811, James Byrne (who had been a coachman for Jocelyn&#x27;s brother, John) accused him of &quot;taking indecent familiarities&quot; and of &quot;using indecent or obscene conversations with him&quot;. Byrne was sued for criminal libel by Bishop Jocelyn and on conviction was sentenced to two years in gaol and also to public flogging. After he recanted his allegations at the prompting of the bishop&#x27;s agent, the floggings were stopped.

===1822 scandal===

On 19 July 1822, Bishop Jocelyn, then aged 57, was caught in a compromising position with a 22-year-old Grenadier Guardsman, John Moverley, in the back room of The White Lion public house, St Albans Place, off The Haymarket in Westminster. He and Moverley were released on bail, provided by The 3rd Earl of Roden and others. Jocelyn broke bail and moved to Scotland where he worked as a butler under an assumed name. He was declared deposed in his absence by the Metropolitan Court of Armagh in October 1822 for &quot;the crimes of immorality, incontinence, Sodomitical practices, habits, and propensities, and neglect of his spiritual, judicial, and ministerial duties&quot;. A public subscription was raised to raise money for James Byrne, whose 1811 conviction was now recognised as a miscarriage of justice.

Bishop Jocelyn was the most senior British or Irish churchman to be involved in a public homosexual scandal in the 19th century. It became a subject of satire and popular ribaldry, resulting in more than a dozen illustrated satirical cartoons, pamphlets, and limericks, such as:

:&quot;The Devil to prove the Church was a farce&quot;
:&quot;Went out to fish for a Bugger.&quot;
:&quot;He baited his hook with a Soldier&#x27;s arse&quot;
:&quot;And pulled up the Bishop of Clogher.&quot;

(This rhyme is dependent on the English reader&#x27;s ignorance of the pronunciation of Irish placenames; the see is pronounced like &quot;KLAW-er&quot; or &quot;KLOH-er.&quot;)

The scandal was so great, that in the days following, &quot;it was not safe for a bishop to show himself in the streets of London&quot;, according to Charles Manners-Sutton, Archbishop of Canterbury at the time. In August 1822, The 2nd Marquess of Londonderry (better known to history as Lord Castlereagh), who was both the Foreign Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons, had an audience with King George IV where he said that he was being blackmailed, and that &quot;I am accused of the same crime as the Bishop of Clogher&quot;. Lord Londonderry committed suicide shortly afterwards and was thought to have been in a paranoid state at the time.

==Legacy==
After Bishop Jocelyn&#x27;s death, it was reported that he had been living quietly for four years at Salisbury Place, Edinburgh, under the assumed name Thomas Wilson, and had previously lived in Glasgow. The plate on his coffin carried no inscription except (in Latin): &quot;Here lie the remains of a great sinner, saved by grace, whose hopes rest in the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot;.

However, some years ago the Jocelyn family vault in Kilcoo Parish Church in Bryansford, County Down, Northern Ireland, was opened and it was discovered that it contained one more coffin than the number of grave markers indicated, and that the extra coffin was unmarked. This extra coffin may be that of the dethroned Bishop of Clogher.

For 178 years after the scandal, the Church of Ireland refused to let historians see its papers on the affair. In the 1920s, Archbishop D&#x27;Arcy of Armagh ordered that they be burned, but this order was not obeyed. The files were released for Matthew Parris&#x27;s research for his book &quot;The Great Unfrocked&quot;.

<text>A railway crane (North America: railroad crane, crane car or wrecker; UK: breakdown crane) is a type of crane used on a railway for one of three primary purposes: freight handling in goods yards, permanent way (PW) maintenance, and accident recovery work. Although the design differs according to the type of work, the basic configuration is similar in all cases: a rotating crane body is mounted on a sturdy chassis fitted with flanged wheels. The body supports the jib (UK; North America: boom) and provides all the lifting and operating mechanisms; on larger cranes, an operator&#x27;s cabin is usually provided. The chassis is fitted with buffing (UK) and/or coupling gear to allow the crane to be moved by a locomotive, although many are also self-propelled to allow limited movement about a work site.

For cranes with a jib that extends beyond the length of the chassis, an idler car (also known as a &#x27;jib carrier&#x27; (UK) or &#x27;boom car&#x27; (North America)) is provided to protect the jib and to allow the crane to be coupled within a train. The idler car is usually a long, flat wagon (i.e. a flatcar) that provides a means of securing the jib for transportation; storage areas for special equipment or supplies are usually fitted too. It was not uncommon for the idler car to be built on a withdrawn revenue-earning wagon, such as on the Great Western Railway after the Grouping and in the 1930s (where they were referred to as &#x27;match trucks&#x27;).

==Usage==
Railroad cranes are usually designed specifically for one of three purposes:

===Goods yard cranes===
Usually the smallest of the railroad cranes, goods yard cranes were used in the larger goods yards to provide lifting capability in areas away from the ground-mounted goods cranes normally provided in such yards.

They were often small enough to be operated by hand, and were not normally self-propelled, instead requiring the use of a shunting engine to move them into position. Once cheap road-going mobile cranes were available, these superseded the rail-mounted variety due to their greater flexibility and mobility.

===Maintenance cranes===
The most varied forms of crane are used for maintenance work. General purpose cranes may be used for installing signalling equipment or pointwork, for example, while more specialised types are used for track laying.

===Breakdown cranes===
The largest cranes are used for accident recovery work, usually forming part of a breakdown train that includes staff accommodation and recovery equipment. These are large enough to lift derailed rolling stock back onto the track, although two or more cranes may be required to safely recover a locomotive. In North American terminology, a &#x27;breakdown crane&#x27; is often referred to as a &#x27;wrecker&#x27; and the train of which it is a part is referred to as a &#x27;wreck train&#x27;. The members of the crew that recovers the wrecked car(s) or locomotive(s) are referred to as &#x27;wreckers&#x27;.

==Construction==
A railroad crane generally resembles a conventional fixed-location crane except that the platform the crane sits on is a heavy-duty reinforced flat car. Directly underneath the center of gravity for the crane is a pivot point that allows the crane to swivel around 360°; in this way the crane can locate its boom over the worksite no matter what its location is along the track. The trucks on the car under the crane will often include traction motors so that the crane is able to move itself along the track, and possibly tow additional cars.

Larger cranes may be provided with outriggers to provide additional stability when lifting. Sleepers (ties) are often carried on the idler car to put under the outriggers to spread the weight applied to the trackbed.

Breakdown cranes (sometimes called wrecking cranes or &#x27;big hooks&#x27;) were necessary to every railroad to recover derailed rolling stock and locomotives, while also assisting with bridge building and yard construction.

==History==

In the early days of the railways, locomotives and rolling stock were small enough to be re-railed manually using jacks and tackle, but as they became bigger and heavier this method became inadequate.

Enter into this the steam crane and cable winch. Appearing about 1890, the cranes (the proper rail terminology is “Derrick”) increased in size, commensurate with the rise of steel Pullman cars, so by 1910 steam cranes reached their peak of development (on the railroad). Many of these 1910-era cranes were so useful and powerful, that they remained in service until the 1980s. The combination of a quick-firing steam boiler, heavy steam winch, and cable hook could little be improved upon, and thus remained in service. Also, steam engines did not mind being parked for months, with a little care, and were ready to go to work when needed.

In the 1980s, big, hydraulic controlled diesel cranes appeared. Also, these cranes had the ability to travel on the highway so as to better able to get to the scene of an accident. They are much more mobile, and are able to manoeuvre around an accident scene, better than a crane only limited to rail access. In the United States the advent of contractors to cleanup and re-rail a line to productive status came in around the late 1970s and early 1980s. The use of caterpillar tractor mounted sidebooms (pipelayers) enabled the contractors to mobilize around a site without having the need for crane mats and multiple lifting locations.

In the 1990s a new generation of railway cranes was developed. While the conventional diesel hydraulic road cranes were adopted with some small trolleys to move on the rail track, the new generation had a professional high speed railway chassis for up to . The superstructure is also diesel hydraulic with telescopic boom and counterweight and designed to the railway&#x27;s specific needs. These cranes can travel with suspended loads and keep levelled even on an elevated track, due to the automatic cant compensation. It is possible to work on one outrigger only, work with boom in horizontal position under bridges or under the overhead wires. Capacities are as high as 200 tonnes. It makes this new generation useful for maintenance work and switch and crossing renewal, as well as recovery work.

==Preservation==

Most heritage railways in the UK have one or more preserved railway cranes, either just as historic exhibits, or as fully functioning examples assisting with the operation of the railway. Although not normally required for re-railing activities, they are exceptionally useful for track relaying and the restoration of locomotives and rolling stock, and help to avoid expenditure on outside contractors.

Three cranes of various sizes are preserved at the Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California. They are all cranes once owned by the Western Pacific Railroad and two of them, a small, self-propelled Burro Crane and a large, 200-ton capacity Industrial Brownhoist crane, are maintained in operable condition.
All Japanese railway cranes had already retired. Road cranes are used for re-railing and maintenance works. Type &quot;so-30&quot; railway crane for accident recovery is preserved at Otaru synthesis museum. Type &quot;so-80&quot; railway crane for accident recovery is preserved at Sakuma railpark. Type &quot;so-300&quot; railway crane for bridge construction is preserved at Usuitouge tetsudo bunkamura.

Several breakdown cranes are preserved in the various Australian states. Examples preserved in New South Wales as X10 Class and include 1048 a 30T steam crane built by Cowans Sheldon, preserved at Rothbury. 1050 a 50T steam crane built by Craven Bros, preserved at Dorrigo. 1055 a 35T steam crane converted to diesel built by Ransome &amp; Rapier, preserved at Canberra. 1060 a 120T steam crane converted to diesel built by Krupp Ardelt, preserved at Dorrigo. 1073 a 70T steam crane built by Craven Bros converted to diesel, preserved Richmond Main. 1080 a 50T steam crane built by Industrial Brownhoist, preserved Junee. 1081 a 50T steam crane built by Industrial Brownhoist, preserved Dorrigo.

<doc id="1260401" wikidata="Q7038408" url="?curid=1260401" title="Nine Noble Virtues">
<text>The Nine Noble Virtues, NNV, or 9NV are two sets of moral and situational ethical guidelines within certain groupings of Heathens, typically those with folkish views such as Odinists and members of the Ásatrú Folk Assembly (AFA). One set was codified by former member of Sir Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists and National Socialists, John Yeowell (a.k.a. Stubba) and John Gibbs-Bailey (a.k.a. Hoskuld) of the Odinic Rite in 1974, and the other set codified by Stephen A. McNallen of the Asatru Folk Assembly in 1983. However, others believe that the earlier set, the one the Odinic Rite claim they codified, were originally put together and labelled as the Nine Noble Virtues (the “9NV”) by Edred Thorsson during his time with the original AFA. They are supposedly based on virtues found in historical Norse paganism, gleaned from various sources including the Poetic Edda (particularly the Hávamál and the Sigrdrífumál), and as evident in the Icelandic Sagas).

The Nine Charges are a different list of more explicitly phrased moral or ethical guidelines codified at about the same time.
The Six-Fold Goal is yet another list of virtues, given as &quot;Right, Wisdom, Might, Harvest, Frith and Love&quot; by Stephen Flowers (a.k.a. Edred Thorsson) in 1989.

The Aesirian Code of Nine is also used by some practitioners of Heathenism, consisting of &quot;honor, knowledge, protect, flourish, change, fairness, conflict, balance and control.&quot;

==Nine Noble Virtues==
The list of &quot;Nine Noble Virtues&quot; is due to either John Yeowell (a.k.a. Stubba) and John Gibbs-Bailey (a.k.a. Hoskuld), members of Odinic Rite, or alternatively due to Edred Thorsson, at the time member of the &quot;Asatru Free Assembly&quot;.
Stephen A. McNallen compiled a similar list under the title &quot;Some Odinist Values&quot; in the Asatru Folk Assembly journal &quot;The Runestone&quot;.

&quot;Nine Noble Virtues&quot; 
#Courage
#Truth
#Honour
#Fidelity
#Discipline
#Hospitality
#Self Reliance
#Industriousness
#Perseverance

&quot;Some Odinist Values&quot; 
#Strength is better than weakness
#Courage is better than cowardice
#Joy is better than guilt
#Honour is better than dishonour
#Freedom is better than slavery
#Kinship is better than alienation
#Realism is better than dogmatism
#Vigor is better than lifelessness
#Ancestry is better than rootlessness
==Nine Charges==
The Nine Charges were codified by the Odinic Rite in the 1970s.
#To maintain candour and fidelity in love and devotion to the tried friend: though he strike me I will do him no scathe.
#Never to make wrongsome oath: for great and grim is the reward for the breaking of plighted troth.
#To deal not hardly with the humble and the lowly.
#To remember the respect that is due to great age.
#To suffer no evil to go unremedied and to fight against the enemies of Faith, Folk and Family: my foes I will fight in the field, nor will I stay to be burnt in my house.
#To succour the friendless but to put no faith in the pledged word of a stranger people.
#If I hear the fool&#x27;s word of a drunken man I will strive not: for many a grief and the very death groweth from out such things.
#To give kind heed to dead people: straw dead, sea dead or sword dead.
#To abide by the enactments of lawful authority and to bear with courage the decrees of the Norns.

Avahi is a system which enables programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network. For example, a user can plug a computer into a network and have Avahi automatically advertise the network services running on its machine, facilitating user access to those services.

== Software architecture ==
Avahi implements the Apple Zeroconf specification, mDNS, DNS-SD and RFC 3927/IPv4LL. Other implementations include Apple&#x27;s Bonjour framework (the mDNSResponder component of which is licensed under the Apache License).

Avahi provides a set of language bindings (Python, Mono, etc.) and ships with most Linux and BSD distributions. Because of its modularized architecture, major desktop components like GNOME Virtual file system and KDE input/output architecture already integrate Avahi.

== Avahi vs. Bonjour ==
The Avahi project started in 2004 because Apple&#x27;s Zeroconf implementation, Bonjour, used the GPL-incompatible Apple Public Source License. In 2006 Apple relicensed parts of Bonjour under the Apache License.

Avahi&#x27;s performance resembles that of Bonjour, sometimes exceeding it; however Avahi can lose services when managing large numbers of requests simultaneously.

==History==
Avahi was developed by Lennart Poettering and Trent Lloyd. It is the result of a merger in 2005 of Poettering&#x27;s original mDNS/DNS-SD implementation called &quot;FlexMDNS&quot;, and Lloyd&#x27;s original code called &quot;Avahi&quot;. While most of today&#x27;s code originates from the former project, the name of the latter was used for the joint project. Development on &quot;FlexMDNS&quot; started in late 2004, and work on the original &quot;Avahi&quot; began in early 2004.

Avahi was originally developed under the freedesktop.org umbrella, but has now become a separate project. Avahi, however, makes use of freedesktop.org&#x27;s D-Bus IPC layer.

The name &quot;Avahi&quot; is the Malagasy native name and scientific Latin name of a genus of woolly lemur, a family of primates indigenous to Madagascar. Trent Lloyd found the name and liked it, and it stuck. The logo reflects this.

<text>Steve Rauschenberger (born August 29, 1956) is an American politician who served as a Republican member of the Illinois State Senate from 1993 to 2007.

==Early life==
Steve Rauschenberger was born on August 29, 1956, in Elgin as one of six children to John Rauschenberger, a member of the Illinois Republican State Central Committee, and Shirley Rauschenberger. He attended Elgin Area School District U46 public schools and was a National Merit Finalist in high school. In 1978, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia. In 1980, he purchased his family&#x27;s business, Rauschenberger Furniture Co., and went on in 1985 to buy Ackemann Brothers Corp., of which he is currently president and general manager. He became active with his children in Boy Scouts and served as a member of the Elgin Downtown Advisory Commission.

==Illinois Senate==

===1992 Election===
In 1991, Republican Senator John Friedland chose not to run for re-election in the 33rd district. At that time, the 33rd included Streamwood and Bartlett in Cook County, Elgin, South Elgin, West Dundee, East Dundee, Carpentersville, Maple Park, Hampshire, Burlington, Sugar Grove and Campton Township in Kane County and Hinckley in DeKalb County. Rauschenberger ran for the seat, citing a change in the tax code that cost retailers millions by forcing them to change their accounting practices. In an upset, Rauschenberger defeated State Representative James Kirkland in the March primary. In May, businessman and lawyer Thom McNamee became the Democratic nominee. Rauschenberger ran on a platform of privatization of government services, opposition to tax hikes, an increase in earned income tax credits, opposition to the proposed Fox Valley Freeway and restoring the state&#x27;s financial health.

===Tenure===
During his early years in the Senate, he was a member of a group dubbed the &quot;Fab Five.&quot; The group was made up of conservative state senators elected in 1992 who were anti-tax, pro-balanced budget and often challenged the Republican leadership of Senate President Pate Philip and Governor Jim Edgar. The group&#x27;s other four members were, Peter Fitzgerald, Dave Syverson, Patrick O&#x27;Malley and Chris Lauzen. As a result of the group&#x27;s clout Rauschenberger became chair of the influential Appropriations Committee during his first term. As Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Rauschenberger negotiated the multibillion-dollar state budget. He also served as the Senate negotiator for KidCare, the state health insurance program for children in low-income, working families.

During the 2001 redistricting process, Rauschenberger was drawn into the 22nd legislative district which included much of his old territory in Elgin, Dundee and Hanover townships and added Schaumburg Township. He won re-election in the new district with 56% of the vote. In 2003, when the Democratic Party took a majority in the Illinois Senate, he lost his chairmanship of the appropriations committee, but was appointed to be an Assistant Republican Leader under Frank Watson. He also served as Minority Spokesman on the Joint Task Force on Immigrants and Refugees

In the Senate, Rauschenberger&#x27;s legislative agenda including supporting statewide tax caps, increasing the income tax exemption, enacting &quot;pro-life&quot; policies and balancing the budget. He also received high ratings from the Illinois Federation of Independent Business during his tenure.

During his time in the Illinois Senate, Rauschenberger was active with the National Conference of State Legislatures including serving as co-chair of the Taskforce on Telecommunications and Electronic Commerce, an executive board member and Vice President. In 2006, he was elected President of the NCSL. He was also active in the Republican Party serving as the Hanover Township Republican Committeeman from 1994-2002 and as President of the John Ericsson Republican League, a Swedish American Republican organization.

==Runs for Higher Office==

===United States Senate election, 2004===
In May 2003, Jim Edgar announced that he would not seek the US Senate seat being vacated by retiring US Senator Peter Fitzgerald. Rauschenberger was one of the many people speculated who could run for the seat. On September 23, 2003, Rauschenberger announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. Despite being heavily out matched in fundraising, he rode a late surge fueled by sweeping editorial endorsements, including the Chicago Tribune to finish third in the March 16, 2004 Illinois U.S. Senate Republican primary election that was won by Jack Ryan.

During the general election, Jack Ryan dropped out of the race after revelations regarding his divorce. Subsequently Rauschenberger became a front-runner to replace Ryan as the Republican nominee in Senate race against then-State Senator Barack Obama, including being promoted by Don Manzullo. Rauschenberger announced on July 8, 2004 that he would not seek the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate—in part because he was never convinced he would have the financial support needed to wage a competitive campaign against Barack Obama who had announced two days earlier having raised $4 million in the second quarter of 2004. His withdraw was followed by speculation about a potential Mike Ditka candidacy.

===Illinois gubernatorial election, 2006===
In August 2005, Senator Rauchenberger sought the Republican nomination Governor of Illinois in the 2006 election. However, citing a crowded field, Rauchenberger dropped out of the race for governor and joined Ron Gidwitz&#x27;s campaign as his running mate for lieutenant governor. Though the two positions are nominated in the primary independently, candidates for both often run together during the primary campaign, promoting a single &quot;ticket.&quot; During the race, he vowed to drop out if Judy Baar Topinka won the nomination. He ultimately lost to Topinka&#x27;s running mate and DuPage County States Attorney Joe Birkett.

==Post political career==
After leaving the Senate in 2007, he founded Rauschenberger Partners, a lobbying firm where he serves as president. He also took on the role of President of the United Republican Fund until his resignation in 2010. In 2008, he ran to become the Republican National Committeeman representing Illinois, but lost to Pat Brady at the 2008 State Convention of the Illinois Republican Party.

During the 2008 Republican Party presidential primaries, Rauschenberger ran to be a delegate to the 2008 Republican National Convention from Illinois&#x27;s 14th congressional district for the presidential campaign of former Governor Mitt Romney.

During the 2010 election cycle Rauschenberger chose to run against Mike Noland, his successor as state senator and the Democratic incumbent. He was endorsed by Illinois Citizens for Ethics, Illinois Family Action, Illinois Federation of Independent Business, National Rifle Association, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the United Republican Fund of which he was president. On election night, Noland defeated Rauschenberger by 585 votes.

In May 2015, Rauschenberger became president of the Technology &amp; Manufacturing Association, a nonprofit organization that represents precision manufacturing and supplier companies in Illinois.

<doc id="1260420" wikidata="Q277614" url="?curid=1260420" title="Anti-predator adaptation">
<text>Anti-predator adaptations are mechanisms developed through evolution that assist prey organisms in their constant struggle against predators. Throughout the animal kingdom, adaptations have evolved for every stage of this struggle, namely by avoiding detection, warding off attack, fighting back, or escaping when caught.

The first line of defence consists in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as camouflage, masquerade, apostatic selection, living underground, or nocturnality.

Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in aposematism, by mimicking animals which do possess such defences, by startling the attacker, by signalling to the predator that pursuit is not worthwhile, by distraction, by using defensive structures such as spines, and by living in a group. Members of groups are at reduced risk of predation, despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and the likelihood that the predator will attack some other individual.

==Avoiding detection==
===Staying out of sight===

Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands. Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.

===Camouflage===
Camouflage uses any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination by countershading or counter-illumination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and colour. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and blend in with the ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. In addition, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.

===Masquerade===
Animals can hide in plain sight by masquerading as inedible objects. For example, the potoo, a South American bird, habitually perches on a tree, convincingly resembling a broken stump of a branch, while a butterfly, &quot;Kallima&quot;, looks just like a dead leaf.

===Apostatic selection===

Another way to remain unattacked in plain sight is to look different from other members of the same species. Predators such as tits selectively hunt for abundant types of insect, ignoring less common types that were present, forming search images of the desired prey. This creates a mechanism for negative frequency-dependent selection, apostatic selection.

==Warding off attack==
Many species make use of behavioral strategies to deter predators.

===Startling the predator===

Many weakly-defended animals, including moths, butterflies, mantises, phasmids, and cephalopods such as octopuses, make use of patterns of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. In the absence of toxins or other defences, this is essentially bluffing, in contrast to aposematism which involves honest signals.

===Pursuit-deterrent signals===

Pursuit-deterrent signals are behavioral signals used by prey to convince predators not to pursue them. For example, gazelles stot, jumping high with stiff legs and an arched back. This is thought to signal to predators that they have a high level of fitness and can outrun the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely to outrun them.
White-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous (often black and white) tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected.
Warning calls given by birds such as the Eurasian jay are similarly honest signals, benefiting both predator and prey: the predator is informed that it has been detected and might as well save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack.

=== Playing dead ===

Another pursuit-deterrent signal is thanatosis or playing dead. Thanatosis is a form of bluff in which an animal mimics its own dead body, feigning death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching.
An example of this is seen in white-tailed deer fawns, which experience a drop in heart rate in response to approaching predators. This response, referred to as &quot;alarm bradycardia&quot;, causes the fawn&#x27;s heart rate to drop from 155 to 38 beats per minute within one beat of the heart. This drop in heart rate can last up to two minutes, causing the fawn to experience a depressed breathing rate and decrease in movement, called tonic immobility. Tonic immobility is a reflex response that causes the fawn to enter a low body position that simulates the position of a corpse. Upon discovery of the fawn, the predator loses interest in the &quot;dead&quot; prey. Other symptoms of alarm bradycardia, such as salivation, urination, and defecation, can also cause the predator to lose interest.&#x27;

=== Distraction ===


Marine molluscs such as sea hares, cuttlefish, squid and octopuses give themselves a last chance to escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may mimic food or otherwise confuse predators. In response to a predator, animals in these groups release ink, creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator&#x27;s feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud.

Distraction displays attract the attention of predators away from an object, typically the nest or young, that is being protected, as when some birds feign a broken wing while hopping about on the ground.

===Mimicry and aposematism===

Mimicry occurs when an organism (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This results in the mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages. There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve aposematic coloration, or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator.

In Batesian mimicry, a palatable, harmless prey species mimics the appearance of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic&#x27;s risk of attack. This form of mimicry is seen in many insects. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar colours and markings, including Batesian mimics, which are in effect parasitic on the chemical or other defences of the unprofitable models. Some species of octopus can mimic a selection of other animals by changing their skin color, skin pattern and body motion. When a damselfish attacks an octopus, the octopus mimics a banded sea snake. The model chosen varies with the octopus&#x27;s predator and habitat. Most of these octopuses use Batesian mimicry, selecting an organism repulsive to predators as a model.

In Müllerian mimicry, two or more aposematic forms share the same warning signals, as in viceroy and monarch butterflies. Birds avoid eating both species because their wing patterns honestly signal their unpleasant taste.

===Defensive structures===

Many animals are protected against predators with armour in the form of hard shells (such as most molluscs and turtles), leathery or scaly skin (as in reptiles), or tough chitinous exoskeletons (as in arthropods).

A spine is a sharp, needle-like structure used to inflict pain on predators. An example of this seen in nature is in the sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine on the front of each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and in some species are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog&#x27;s short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.

Many species of slug caterpillar, Limacodidae, have numerous protuberances and stinging spines along their dorsal surfaces. Species that possess these stinging spines suffer less predation than larvae that lack them, and a predator, the paper wasp, chooses larvae without spines when given a choice.

==Safety in numbers==
Group living can decrease the risk of predation to the individual in a variety of ways, as described below.

===Dilution effect===

A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group &quot;dilute&quot; their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.

===Selfish herd===

The selfish herd theory was proposed by W.D. Hamilton to explain why animals seek central positions in a group. The theory&#x27;s central idea is to reduce the individual&#x27;s domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in which the individual is more likely to be attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals are predicted to strive constantly to gain this position. Testing Hamilton&#x27;s selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O&#x27;Rainn (2010) studied brown fur seal predation from great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.

===Predator satiation===


A radical strategy for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill a large majority of the emerging stage of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence. Predators may feast on the emerging population, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey. Periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years, are often used as an example of this predator satiation, though other explanations of their unusual life-cycle have been proposed.

===Alarm calls===

Animals that live in groups often give alarm calls that give warning of an attack. For example, vervet monkeys give different calls depending on the nature of the attack: for an eagle, a disyllabic cough; for a leopard or other cat, a loud bark; for a python or other snake, a &quot;chutter&quot;. The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they look up and run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and look around for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.

===Improved vigilance===

In the improved vigilance effect, groups are able to detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, the more likely it is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises its head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches&#x27; heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.

===Predator confusion===

Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator.

==Fighting back==

Defensive structures such as spines may be used both to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against a predator. Methods of fighting back include chemical defences, mobbing, defensive regurgitation, and suicidal altruism.

===Chemical defences===

Many prey animals, and to defend against seed predation also seeds of plants, make use of poisonous chemicals for self-defence. These may be concentrated in surface structures such as spines or glands, giving an attacker a taste of the chemicals before it actually bites or swallows the prey animal: many toxins are bitter-tasting. A last-ditch defence is for the animal&#x27;s flesh itself to be toxic, as in the puffer fish, danaid butterflies and burnet moths. Many insects acquire toxins from their food plants; &quot;Danaus&quot; caterpillars accumulate toxic cardenolides from milkweeds (Asclepiadaceae).

Some prey animals are able to eject noxious materials to deter predators actively. The bombardier beetle has specialized glands on the tip of its abdomen that allows it to direct a toxic spray towards predators. The spray is generated explosively through oxidation of hydroquinones and is sprayed at a temperature of 100 °C. Armoured crickets similarly release blood at their joints when threatened (autohaemorrhaging). Several species of grasshopper including &quot;Poecilocerus pictus&quot;, &quot;Parasanaa donovani&quot;, &quot;Aularches miliaris&quot;, and &quot;Tegra novaehollandiae&quot; secrete noxious liquids when threatened, sometimes ejecting these forcefully. Spitting cobras accurately squirt venom from their fangs at the eyes of potential predators, striking their target eight times out of ten, and causing severe pain. Termite soldiers in the Nasutitermitinae have a fontanellar gun, a gland on the front of their head which can secrete and shoot an accurate jet of resinous terpenes &quot;many centimeters&quot;. The material is sticky and toxic to other insects. One of the terpenes in the secretion, pinene, functions as an alarm pheromone. Seeds deter predation with combinations of toxic non-protein amino acids, cyanogenic glycosides, protease and amylase inhibitors, and phytohemagglutinins.

A few vertebrate species such as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.

The slime glands along the body of the hagfish secrete enormous amounts of mucus when it is provoked or stressed. The gelatinous slime has dramatic effects on the flow and viscosity of water, rapidly clogging the gills of any fish that attempt to capture hagfish; predators typically release the hagfish within seconds. Common predators of hagfish include seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, but few fish, suggesting that predatory fish avoid hagfish as prey.

===Communal defence===

In communal defence, prey groups actively defend themselves by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing themselves to be passive victims of predation. Mobbing is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, red colobus monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by chimpanzees, a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group&#x27;s females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees. Fieldfares are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.

===Defensive regurgitation===
Some birds and insects use defensive regurgitation to ward off predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator&#x27;s feathers to mat, leading to the loss of flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.

European roller chicks vomit a bright orange, foul smelling liquid when they sense danger. This repels prospective predators and may alert their parents to danger: they respond by delaying their return.

Numerous insects utilize defensive regurgitation. The eastern tent caterpillar regurgitates a droplet of digestive fluid to repel attacking ants. Similarly, larvae of the noctuid moth regurgitate when disturbed by ants. The vomit of noctuid moths has repellent and irritant properties that help to deter predator attacks.

===Suicidal altruism===
An unusual type of predator deterrence is observed in the Malaysian exploding ant. Social hymenoptera rely on altruism to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony. When a worker ant&#x27;s leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied submandibular glands, expelling corrosive irritant compounds and adhesives onto the predator. These prevent predation and serve as a signal to other enemy ants to stop predation of the rest of the colony.

==Escaping==
===Flight===
The normal reaction of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding, falling, swimming, running, jumping, burrowing or rolling, according to the animal&#x27;s capabilities. Escape paths are often erratic, making it difficult for the predator to predict which way the prey will go next: for example, birds such as snipe, ptarmigan and black-headed gulls evade fast raptors such as peregrine falcons with zigzagging or jinking flight. In the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and gliding. Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the sonar clicks of bats. Among fish, the stickleback follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating merganser duck.

===Autotomy===

Some animals are capable of autotomy (self-amputation), shedding one of their own appendages in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator&#x27;s grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be regenerated later. Certain sea slugs discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as crabs can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among vertebrates, many geckos and other lizards shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.

==History of observations==

Aristotle recorded observations (around 350 BC) of the antipredator behaviour of cephalopods in his &quot;History of Animals&quot;, including the use of ink as a distraction, camouflage, and signalling.

In 1940, Hugh Cott wrote a compendious study of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism, &quot;Adaptive Coloration in Animals&quot;.

By the 21st century, adaptation to life in cities had markedly reduced the antipredator responses of animals such as rats and pigeons; similar changes are observed in captive and domesticated animals.

<doc id="1260426" wikidata="Q1424442" url="?curid=1260426" title="Romanian Socialist Party (2003)">
<text>The Romanian Socialist Party (, PSR) is a political party in Romania formed as the Socialist Alliance Party (PAS) in 2003. It developed out of the wing of the Socialist Party of Labour (PSM) that objected to the merger of PSM with the Social Democratic Party (PSD) in July 2003 and wanted the PSM to continue as a socialist party. The Romanian authorities did not recognize this group as part of PSM, and instead it took the name Socialist Alliance Party.

After absorbing the &quot;United Left Party&quot; in 2009, the party merged into the Socialist Alternative Party in late 2013. In late 2014, the merged party changed its name to the Socialist Party of Romania, replacing the party of the same name defunct since 2013. The unregistered present day Romanian Communist Party (PCR; which has since gained registration after changing its name to the Communitarian Party of Romania) had argued that the PSR is a pseudo-communist party.

The then-PAS decided to rename itself the Romanian Communist Party at an extraordinary party congress in July 2010, placing itself in the tradition of the party of the same name founded in 1921. The renaming was however rejected by the Bucharest tribunal.

In 2013, it won 34 local seats. The party is led by a 165-member National Committee, a 60-member Directive Committee and a 60-member Executive Bureau. PSR was a founding member of the Party of the European Left.

==Ideology==
Unlike its predecessor, the Socialist Party of Labour, the Romanian Socialist Party is more progressive on social issues, supporting socialist feminism. However, much like its predecessor, it is nationalist and supports Communism nostalgia.

The Party supports Romanian membership in the European Union, and even calls for European federalism. However, it strongly rejects the Romanian membership in NATO.

<doc id="1260441" wikidata="Q235443" url="?curid=1260441" title="Jessica Stam">
<text>Jessica Elizabeth Stam (born 23 April 1986) is a Canadian model. She is considered to be part of the crop of models described as &quot;doll faces.&quot; In 2007, &quot;Forbes&quot; named her fifteenth in the list of the World&#x27;s 15 Top-Earning Supermodels, earning at an estimated total of $1.5 million in the past 12 months.

==Early life and discovery==
Stam was born in Kincardine, Ontario, to Rick and Deb Stam, and grew up on a farm alongside her six brothers: Nathan, Aaron, Mathew, Christopher, Justin, and Micah. She came from a religious family and attended Sacred Heart High School in Walkerton, Ontario. Her original intention was to become a dentist. Stam was discovered in a local Tim Hortons coffee shop by Michèle Miller (an agent at the International Model Management agency in Barrie, Ontario) who found Stam on the way back from Canada&#x27;s Wonderland (a theme park just outside Toronto).

==Career==

=== Early beginnings 2002–2004 ===
Stam won the Los Angeles Model Look contest in 2002. Photographer Steven Meisel jump-started her career and soon after cast her in every advertisement campaign of his. &quot;I guess I&#x27;m his muse&quot;, she has said, and she has credited him with helping her become a supermodel. She has appeared on the cover of UK, Turkish &amp; German &quot;Vogue&quot; and in advertisements for Marc Jacobs, Anna Sui, Giorgio Armani and others.

In 2004, Stam appeared in the short film &quot;Agent Orange&quot;. She was sued by New York Model Management, because of a breach of contract. Fashion designer Marc Jacobs created &quot;The Marc Jacobs Stam&quot;, a bag inspired by and named after her.

=== Modelling breakthrough 2006–2009 ===
Stam walked a total of 64 shows combined during the New York, Milan, and Paris Fashion Weeks in 2006. In January 2006, she appeared in the Rochas ad campaign, shot and directed by Bruno Aveillan. Stam fell at the Chloé Fall 2006 show in Paris, while wearing &quot;ridiculously high patent-leather pumps&quot; that got caught on each other as her feet crossed on the runway. Her fall received millions of views on YouTube and took first spot on the &quot;Top Five Runway Falls&quot; list by &quot;New York Magazine&quot;. For the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show in 2006, she opened the first &quot;Pink&quot; segment ever. Her appearance also included a featurette showing a Victoria&#x27;s Secret commercial shoot and what a model sees when walking the runway.

She was presented, along with nine other models, on the May 2007 cover of American &quot;Vogue&quot; as one of the &quot;World&#x27;s Next Top Models.&quot; During Paris&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2007 Haute Couture fashion week, she walked for Chanel, Christian Lacroix, Christian Dior, Givenchy, and Jean Paul Gaultier. In July 2007, earning an estimated total of $1.5 million in the previous 12 months, &quot;Forbes&quot; named her fifteenth in the list of the World&#x27;s 15 Top-Earning Supermodels. Currently, she stars in campaigns for Bulgari, Dior, Lanvin and Escada. She also appeared in the F/W 2007 Christian Dior, DKNY, Miss Sixty, Loewe and Roberto Cavalli ad campaign. She has also walked in the 2006, 2007, and 2010 Victoria&#x27;s Secret fashion shows. For F/W 08, Stam could be seen in ads for Giorgio Armani&#x27;s &quot;Onde&quot; fragrance, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Bulgari. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; featured Jessica Stam in their article on &quot;How to Walk Like a Model&quot; and taught a DKNY intern her runway moves.

=== Continued success 2009–present ===
She returned as the face of Bulgari, and in March 2009 she appeared on the cover of Tokyo Numéro. She starred in the fall Fendi campaign, shot by Karl Lagerfeld.

<text>The Ref (Hostile Hostages in some countries) is a 1994 American Christmas black comedy crime film directed by Ted Demme, written by Richard LaGravenese and Marie Weiss, and starring Denis Leary, Judy Davis, and Kevin Spacey. The plot centers on a burglar who, while evading capture from the police, is forced to take a bickering, dysfunctional family hostage on Christmas Eve. The burglar finds himself having to act as a de facto marriage counselor, or &quot;referee&quot;, between the squabbling husband and wife, a situation that becomes more complicated when the husband&#x27;s relatives drop by for Christmas dinner.

The film was released on March 11, 1994 and was a box office disappointment, though positive reviews praised its dark humor, dialogue, and performances. It later found a wider audience through home video and cable TV airings, becoming a cult movie and an alternative to traditional Christmas movies during the holiday season.

==Plot==
On Christmas Eve in an affluent Connecticut hamlet, Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur are in a marriage counseling session with therapist Dr. Wong. Caroline has had an affair, and Lloyd is miserable and blames the behavioral problems of their 15-year-old son Jesse on his wife&#x27;s coddling of him. Caroline, meanwhile, calls out Lloyd for his inability to stand up to his domineering mother, Rose.

In the same town, cat burglar Gus is in the midst of stealing jewelry from a mansion. His plan goes awry when he accidentally sets off the alarm and is chased out by a guard dog. His getaway car, driven by his partner Murray, is no longer there. At a convenience store, he runs into Lloyd and Caroline and takes them hostage, ordering them to drive him to their house. Along the way, Caroline and Lloyd keep arguing, with Gus having to repeatedly intercede and tell them to shut up.

At the Chasseur house, Gus has Lloyd and Caroline tied up while they continue to bicker. Knowing that Murray usually seeks refuge at seedy bars, Gus calls the local bar and manages to get in touch with him. He instructs Murray to steal a boat for their getaway. The police set up roadblocks and impose a curfew to look for Gus, while two officers go door-to-door. Lt. Huff, the police chief, is less than concerned because the town rarely sees criminal activity like this.

Jesse, who has been away at a military school, arrives home earlier than his parents expect. Unbeknownst to them, Jesse has been blackmailing the school&#x27;s commanding officer, Siskel, with photographs of an affair. He is stashing the money with plans of running away. Gus has Jesse tied up along with his parents. Jesse, unhappy with his home life, pleads to join Gus into a life of crime. Gus calls Jesse out on his naivety and tells the boy he should appreciate his comfortable upbringing.

As the police search for Gus expands, he is forced to continue hiding out in the Chasseur home while waiting on Murray. Complicating matters are visiting neighbors, such as George, who is dressed up as Santa Claus and arrives to deliver a fruitcake for the family. Later, Lloyd&#x27;s family—his brother Gary, sister-in-law Connie, their two children Mary and John, and Rose—arrive to celebrate Christmas Eve. Rose is extremely wealthy and bullies everyone in the family. To hide any suspicion that Lloyd and Caroline are being held hostage, Gus pretends to be Dr. Wong and tells Lloyd&#x27;s family his presence is needed as part of &quot;experimental therapy&quot;. Jesse is tied up and gagged upstairs in his parents&#x27; closet. During the family dinner, Caroline and Lloyd are unable to stop fighting, which comes to a head when Rose reveals that Lloyd told her about Caroline&#x27;s affair, and Caroline demands a divorce. Gus&#x27; pointed comments goad Lloyd to finally stand up to his wife and his mother. Everyone finds out who Gus really is after Rose attempts to go upstairs; Gus has her tied up and gagged.

Siskel turns up at the door and reveals how he is being blackmailed. Jesse manages to untie himself, and his parents discover his hidden money. George, still dressed as Santa, but now very drunk, returns to the home, protesting why he never gets a gift in return. He spots the gun and realizes who Gus is but gets knocked out. The state police arrive, and Lloyd, having a change of heart, decides he cannot &quot;spend [his] life sending everyone [he] care[s] about to prison.&quot; He instructs Jesse to take Gus to the docks using a path through the woods. Gus, in George&#x27;s Santa suit, makes it safely to a boat where Murray awaits.

Back at home, the couple&#x27;s bickering drives away the police. Having aired out their differences throughout the evening with Gus&#x27; assistance, they make up and decide to stay together. Their reconciliation is interrupted when John informs them that &quot;grandma Rose is eating through her gag.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
Richard LaGravenese co-wrote the film with his sister-in-law Marie Weiss. It was inspired by their families. LaGravenese said, &quot;Both Marie and I are Italian Catholics who married into Jewish families, so we do have those big holiday dinners.&quot; Weiss began writing the script in 1989 after she and her husband moved from New York to California. Inspiration came from an argument she had with him and she thought, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if there were a third party to step in and referee?&quot; She wrote several drafts and consulted with LaGravenese in 1991 and they took it to Disney. The studio approved the project within 20 minutes. LaGravenese spent a year revising the script until he finally got &quot;tired of doing rewrites for executives.&quot; 

The script was then put aside until director Ted Demme and comedian Denis Leary came across it. Demme had directed Leary in &quot;No Cure for Cancer&quot;, a stand-up comedy special for Showtime. The studio cast Leary based on the sarcastic funny-man persona he cultivated in MTV spots that Demme directed. Leary joined the project as part of a three-picture deal with Disney. Their involvement motivated LaGravenese to come back to the project. Executive producer Don Simpson described the overall tone of &quot;The Ref&quot; as &quot;biting and sarcastic. Just my nature.&quot;

After test audiences responded poorly to the film&#x27;s original ending—Gus turns himself in to show Jesse that a life of crime leads nowhere quickly—a new ending was shot in January 1994.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened on March 11, 1994, with its widest release in 861 theaters. Its total gross at the domestic box office was only $11,439,193, after coming in at #4 opening weekend, behind &quot;Guarding Tess&quot;, &quot;Lightning Jack&quot; and &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;. 

Leary blamed the film&#x27;s poor box office performance on the studio&#x27;s method of marketing, as they released the film in early spring rather than the holiday season and also chose to center his MTV-style persona in trailers and TV spots. &quot;They did me like the MTV guy. And they shortchanged what the movie was all about,&quot; he said. Leary made fun of himself in a humorous article written for a 1995 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; where he pretends to interview Pope John Paul II. Leary asks the Pope if he has seen &quot;The Ref&quot;, and the Pope responds that he was told it was very vulgar, as evident by its unpopularity.

===Critical reception===
 On Metacritic, the film has an average weighted score of 59 out of 100 based on 27 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot; 

Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a grown-up film that delights in undermining Christmas cliches.&quot; She praised its &quot;gleeful irreverence, dark wit and cynicism&quot;, adding, &quot;The Ref&quot; &quot;is a film to warm the hearts and touch the nerves of dysfunctional families everywhere.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Kenneth Turan said &quot;its comic venom is refreshing for as long as it lasts&quot;. Many praised the casting and writing as among the film&#x27;s strengths. Jeff Shannon of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; said &quot;the Australian Davis - for my money the finest actress around, bar none - is simply uncanny in her command of East Coast gentility combined with razor-sharp timing and comedic expression&quot;. Of Leary, James wrote, &quot;Here he has subtly wiped the abrasiveness away from his [stand-up] style without making Gus seem mushy. For the first time he displays his appeal and potential as an actor instead of a comic with a sneering persona&quot;.

The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;″ Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four. He wrote, &quot;Material like this is only as good as the acting and writing. &quot;The Ref&quot; is skillful in both areas.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Peter Travers praised the performances of Spacey and Davis, saying &quot;They are combustibly funny, finding nuance even in nonsense. The script is crass; the actors never.&quot; Glenn Kenny of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a grade of &quot;A−&quot;, writing &quot;The Ref&quot; features &quot;some of the sharpest dialogue heard in a Hollywood flick since the heyday of Hecht and MacArthur&quot; and that &quot;this nasty romp delivers so many honest laughs, you may end up watching it twice in the same night to make sure you weren&#x27;t hallucinating&quot;.

Negative reviews opined that the film&#x27;s biting humor goes too far and that the movie &quot;can&#x27;t sustain its defiantly misanthropic tone&quot;. Owen Gleiberman, also of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave the film a &quot;C−&quot; rating and wrote, &quot;&quot;The Ref&quot; is crushingly blunt-witted and monotonous in its celebration of domestic sadism.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hal Hinson criticized Leary&#x27;s performance: &quot;A stand-up comic trying to translate his impatient, hipster editorializing to the big screen, he doesn&#x27;t have the modulation of a trained actor, only one speed (fast) and one mode of attack (loud).&quot;

The film was among 500 nominated for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs list. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the film at No. 51 in its list &quot;61 Best Movies You&#x27;ve Never Seen.&quot;

In 2016, Jason Bailey wrote of the film for &quot;Flavorwire&quot;: &quot;It was, if anything, a film ahead of its time; its cynical attitude towards the holidays predates &quot;Bad Santa&quot; by nearly a decade (and there are numerous other echoes of that film in this one), and its expert pivots between comedy and drama are more early 21st century than late 20th.&quot; Eric Walkuski of &quot;JoBlo&quot; called it &quot;a Christmas movie for people who don&#x27;t like Christmas movies, if you will&quot;.

<text>Agent Orange is an American short silent film directed by Tony Scott. The film is about a psychedelic love story taking place in a &quot;shadowy dreamscape&quot;. In 2004, the film was shot at 1 and 6 frames per second, noticeably altering motion and exposure. It was produced by Amazon.com&#x27;s Amazon Theater.

The Orange Boy was played by Christopher Carley, and Orange Girl played by supermodel Jessica Stam. Troy Cephers played the janitor.

It was filmed on a Panavision Hollywood camera, with Eastman Kodak film.

== Plot ==
While waiting in a subway station, a young man catches a glimpse of a beautiful woman, dressed entirely in orange. Before he can reach her, her subway car speeds off.

The young man repeatedly visits the station, each time failing to make contact with the mysterious woman. Revealing he also wears all orange attire.

He plasters posters along the station&#x27;s walls, only for them to be torn down minutes later by a janitor.

After finally giving up hope, a paper plane land in front of him. It is one of his posters. He looks up to see his dream girl. They stare at each other, before smiling.

<text>Dorian Edward West MBE (born 5 October 1967) nicknamed &quot;Nobby&quot; is a former English international rugby union footballer.

West was born in Wrexham, Wales, but his family moved to England when he was young. Before professionalism, he was a police officer with the Leicestershire Constabulary&#x27;s armed response unit.

He made his debut at Leicester Tigers and played for them as a flanker but a move to Nottingham in 1991 saw him convert to hooker. He rejected the offer of a trial for Wales.

He moved back to Leicester in 1996 where he became an understudy to Richard Cockerill. His form improved and he was noticed by England coach Clive Woodward during matches when Cockerill was away on international duty. This resulted in him being picked on the England bench for the 1998 match against France, coming on to replace Cockerill. The next week Cockerill was injured, but second-choice Mark Regan who had been injured for the match against France was fit again, so West was again selected on the bench, and came onto win his second cap.

Cockerill&#x27;s loss of form would see West gradually replace him as first-choice hooker at Leicester, and West had another run of caps in the England starting line-up in 2001. He played in the 2001 Six Nations, and was selected for the England tour to Canada and the US, where he added 3 caps. After the end of the tour he was called up whilst on holiday as a replacement for the British &amp; Irish Lions and performed so well he was on the bench for the final two tests. He failed to keep his shirt to Northampton Saints&#x27; hooker Steve Thompson, but was a useful squad member. At Leicester West enjoyed great domestic success, and started both the 2001 and 2002 Heineken Cup finals.

West was captain of England for the world cup warm-up game against France in Marseilles in August. During the 2003 Rugby World Cup, West was included in the 22 man squad for five of the games, playing in two; starting against Uruguay and coming on as a replacement for the semi-final against France. He was also on the bench for the final, and since his return has been appointed MBE in the New Year&#x27;s Honours.

He announced his retirement from international rugby after the end of the 2003 World Cup and turned to coaching becoming forward coach for the England U21s.

On 8 June 2007, it was announced he had signed as forwards coach to recently relegated Northampton Saints alongside former England Saxons head coach, Jim Mallinder.

He is currently forwards coach for Sale Sharks.

<doc id="1260464" wikidata="Q544473" url="?curid=1260464" title="Angus L. Macdonald Bridge">
<text>The Angus L. Macdonald Bridge is a suspension bridge crossing Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia, Canada; it opened on April 2, 1955.

The bridge is one of two suspension bridges linking the Halifax Peninsula to Dartmouth in the Halifax Regional Municipality.

It is named after the former premier of Nova Scotia, Angus L. Macdonald, who had died in 1954 and had been instrumental in having the bridge built. The bridge was designed by Philip Louis Pratley, one of Canada&#x27;s foremost long-span bridge designers who had also been responsible for the Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver. The bridges have a similar design, which is most notable in the towers. The contractor was Dominion Bridge Company Ltd.

The bridge regularly experiences traffic congestion during rush hours as a result of the structure&#x27;s proximity to the downtown cores of Halifax and Dartmouth, as well as its narrow width. Large commercial vehicles are not permitted to cross and must use the wider MacKay Bridge to the northwest. Public transit buses are allowed to cross and the bridge links several Halifax Transit routes. In 2014/15 the average number of vehicle crossings per month was 1,183,095.

As of January 3, 2022 the toll charge to cross for regular passenger vehicles is $1.25 cash or $1.00 with the MACPASS electronic toll system. The original toll, when the Macdonald opened in 1955, was 40 cents plus 5 cents per passenger. There was also a separate toll for trucks, cyclists, pedestrians, motorcycles and horses/rider.

==History==
Construction of the bridge took place between 1952 and 1955. Caissons were used for underwater work. Five workers died falling from catwalks during construction. The bridge opened on April 2, 1955, and originally cost $11.5 million.

==1999 modernization==
A modernization project was undertaken in the late 1990s and completed in 1999 which saw the original two lanes and one sidewalk and utility corridor expanded to three lanes, with the centre lane being reversible to assist with traffic flow during peak periods.

To reduce the weight of the roadway, asphalt and concrete were removed and special steel plating (an orthotropic deck) was used in its place. This deck is 35% lighter than the old one. New pedestrian and bicycle lanes were attached to the outside of the structure to replace the original sidewalks.

External aesthetic lights were added during the modernisation project which saw the bridge&#x27;s towers lit for the first time on a continuous basis every evening from sunset until midnight. Critics derided the effort as a waste of electricity, given Halifax Harbour&#x27;s frequent foggy weather conditions. The lighting was estimated by the bridge authority to cost in excess of $50,000 a year in 1999.

==Safety barriers==
The Angus L. Macdonald Bridge has attracted media attention as the spot where well known environmental activist Tooker Gomberg is believed to have committed suicide on March 3, 2004.

In June 2004 the Department of National Defence filed a lawsuit against the Bridge Commission alleging that snow, ice, bottles and other debris rained down on HMC &quot;Dockyard&quot; below, endangering staff. The DND first sought $527,000 in damages for its efforts to protect employees, an amount that was later increased to $1.04 million. The lawsuit claimed that the issue had been exacerbated when chain link fencing on the bridge had been removed during the 1999 modernization. In July 2007, as part of the settlement, barriers were installed along 22% of the pedestrian lane at the bridge&#x27;s western end (Halifax abutment) to prevent suicide attempts and protect navy staff below.

Initially, the Halifax-Dartmouth Bridge Commission was concerned that the structure was not capable of handling the additional weight of installing safety barriers along the entire span of the bridge. Subsequent computer modeling eliminated the previous concerns, and on May 13, 2009 the general manager and CEO of the Halifax-Dartmouth Bridge Commission, Steve Snider, announced that a tender for the long-called for extension of the barriers along the full length of the bridge would be issued in June 2009. By March 2010, the remaining sections of the safety barrier had been installed. The bridge now has safety barriers installed along 100% of its pedestrian walkways.

==2015 &quot;Big Lift&quot; project==
Beginning in 2015 another major renovation of the bridge started which saw the temporary removal of the pedway and bike lanes. At a cost of $150 million, every piece of steel that makes up the suspended spans, except the towers and two main cables, were replaced; the non-suspended approach spans remained. New vertical cables were required due to the relocation of the stiffening trusses from above deck level to below deck level. Construction mostly occurred overnight with the bridge open to traffic during the day, but many full-weekend closures were necessary. The replacement portion of the project was completed in February 2017.

After the Lion&#x27;s Gate Bridge, this was only the second time that a suspension bridge had its suspended spans completely replaced while continuing to allow regular traffic flow during the daytime. Principal engineering work for the project was done by the same firm that managed the work on the Lion&#x27;s Gate Bridge.

During the Big Lift project Halifax Transit continued to run its regularly scheduled conventional bus service across the Macdonald bridge, except during times when the bridge was closed. During scheduled closures, Halifax Transit operated a shuttle service using the MacKay Bridge.

Halifax Harbour Bridges also operated a free, 24-hour-a-day shuttle service during construction to accommodate the bridge&#x27;s pedestrian and bicycle users. It operated on a load-and-go basis during the weekday morning and afternoon rush hours, and on a 30-minute schedule at all other times of the day and overnight.

<doc id="1260465" wikidata="Q2917619" url="?curid=1260465" title="Alan Nunn May">
<text>Alan Nunn May (sometimes Allan) (2 May 1911 – 12 January 2003) was a British physicist and a confessed and convicted Soviet spy who supplied secrets of British and American atomic research to the Soviet Union during World War II.

== Early life and education ==
May was the youngest of four children of Walter Frederick Nunn May, a brassfounder, and Mary Annie, née Kendall. He was born in Bedruthan, Park Hill, Moseley, Birmingham, and educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham. As a scholarship student at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he achieved a first in physics, which led to doctoral studies under Charles Ellis and lectureship at King&#x27;s College London.

== Career ==
=== Early communist ties ===
May joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in the 1930s and was active in the Association of Scientific Workers. The Cambridge Five spy ring member Donald Duart Maclean was also at Trinity Hall during an overlapping period.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, May initially worked on radar in Suffolk and then with Cecil Powell in Bristol on a project that attempted to use photographic methods to detect fast particles from radioactive decay. James Chadwick recruited him to a Cambridge University team working on a possible heavy water reactor. The team was part of the British Tube Alloys directorate that was merged into the American Manhattan Project, the successful effort to create a nuclear weapon. In January 1943, the Cambridge team, including May, was transferred to the Montreal Laboratory, which was building a reactor at Chalk River, near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. May&#x27;s Canadian position ended in September 1945, and he returned to his lecturing post in London.

=== Soviet espionage ===
He had let his membership of the Communist Party lapse by 1940, but at Cambridge, when he saw an American report mentioning that Germany might be able to build a dirty bomb, he passed that on to a Soviet contact. In Canada, he was approached by Lieutenant Angelov of the GRU (Soviet military intelligence) for information on atomic research. He continued his espionage by secretly supplying small samples of the isotopes uranium-233 and 235. The courier of the samples was not informed of the danger of radiation, developed painful lesions and needed regular blood transfusions for the rest of his life. May also borrowed library research documents on nuclear power, many from the US, for copying. The Canadian Royal Commission later investigated and states that he was paid with two bottles of whisky and at least C$700. May said that he accepted the money under protest and promptly burnt it. Angelov gave him details for a rendezvous with the GRU next to the British Museum, in London, after his return.

=== Convicted of espionage ===
A GRU cipher clerk in Canada, Igor Gouzenko, defected to the West in Ottawa in September 1945, around the time that May&#x27;s Canadian assignment ended. Gouzenko passed along copies of GRU documents implicating May, including details of the proposed meeting in London. May did not go to the British Museum meeting, but he was arrested in March 1946 and confessed to espionage. On 1 May 1946, he was sentenced to ten years&#x27; hard labour. He was released in late 1952, after serving six-and-a-half years.

May refused to define his actions as treason and claimed in a statement after his release from prison that he believed that he had &quot;acted rightly&quot; as a spy because of being &quot;wholeheartedly concerned with securing victory over Nazi Germany and Japan, and the furtherance of the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy.&quot;

Blacklisted from universities in Britain, May worked for a scientific instruments company and in 1961 he went to work at the University of Ghana, where he conducted research in solid-state physics and created a science museum.

== Personal life and death ==
In 1953, May married Hilde Broda, the ex-wife of Engelbert Broda. They had a son and a stepson from Hilde&#x27;s previous marriage.

He returned to Cambridge in 1978 and died there in a hospital on 12 January 2003. Cause of death was pneumonia and pulmonary disease.

A 2002 statement, released after his death, confessed to his spying activities and detailed how he got embroiled with the Soviet Union, though his reasoning for passing along nuclear secrets was simply that he felt the Soviets &quot;ought to be informed&quot;. It was passed to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in 2003 and had been dictated to a relative in late 2002.

== Legacy ==

May&#x27;s arrest and sentence in 1946 first showed publicly that the Soviet Union had obtained atomic secrets by espionage. His clearance by MI5 also led to American distrust of Britain, and the McMahon Act. He passed on information on atomic reactors, but unlike Klaus Fuchs (who was arrested in 1950) he knew little of weapon design.

May is a major character in the 2003 novel &quot;The Cloud Chamber&quot;, by Clare George, a fictional account of Cambridge physicists in the 1930s which centres on the scientific excitement of the interwar years contrasted with the vexing moral questions faced by scientists during World War II. The main character is a fictional physicist and pacifist who studied and worked at Cambridge&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory with May before the war. George&#x27;s acknowledged inspiration for the story was her grandfather, a real-life physicist whose true story follows several of the particulars of her character, Walter Dunnachie.

<text>Pernitz is a town in the district of Wiener Neustadt-Land in the Austrian state of Lower Austria.

==History==

The origin of the name &quot;Pernitz&quot; is the Slavic word &quot;perenica&quot;, which refers to a stream on which charcoal is used. The Slavic settlement was preceded by a Celtic settlement. The name was first mentioned in 1165 in the Falkensteiner Codex. Since the 17th century Pernitz experienced growth, interrupted by the plague in 1679, and the Second Turkish Siege in 1683.

In 1828, a road was built to the Triesting valley. It was connected by railway to Leobersdorf and Gutenstein in 1877. Pernitz received water in 1904 and electricity in 1908. It became a market town in 1961.

<doc id="1260478" wikidata="Q3139527" url="?curid=1260478" title="Holt Renfrew">
<text>Holt, Renfrew &amp; Co., Limited (doing business as Holt Renfrew and colloquially Holt&#x27;s) is a Canadian luxury department store chain founded in 1837 by William S. Henderson. The original William Ashton &amp; Co. store in Quebec City, Lower Canada (now Quebec) operated as a fur shop. The company serviced the greater North American and European markets with its mail order catalog beginning in the late 1800s, and was appointed Furriers in Ordinary to several members of the British royal family from 1886 to 1921.

The present-day Holt Renfrew name comes from the additions of business partner George Richard Renfrew in 1862, and company president John Henderson Holt in 1900. The company became a full-line retailer with the opening of the multi-level Sherbrooke Street store in Montreal in 1937. It was acquired by Wittington Investments (owned by the Weston family) in 1986, and was affiliated with the European department stores Selfridges, Brown Thomas, and de Bijenkorf until the Weston family divested of the Selfridges Group in 2022. , Holt Renfrew operates six department stores in four Canadian provinces, including the flagship store on Bloor Street West in Toronto and the former Ogilvy store (now Holt Renfrew Ogilvy) on Saint Catherine Street in Montreal.

Holt Renfrew is comparable to American department stores Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. It competes with Saks Fifth Avenue and Canadian departments stores including Hudson&#x27;s Bay and Simons.

== Operations during the 19th century ==
In 1837, William S. Henderson, an Irish-born merchant, bought his partners&#x27; interest in their Quebec City fur shop and went into business for himself, thereby marking the traditional founding date of Holt Renfrew. Three years earlier, Henderson had arrived by ship from Londonderry with a load of hats and caps. The merchandise sold well and other overseas crossings followed. Eventually, Henderson set up shop at Quebec under the name William Ashton &amp; Co. An early company advertisement noted a line of wholesale and retail garments and accessories that included Ladies&#x27; fur muffs, boas and tippets, in addition to Buffalo Robes and Bear skins, procured as well as &quot;manufactured on this premises.&quot; By 1847, the store, then renamed William S. Henderson &amp; Co., had established itself at 12 Buade Street. Eventually the store moved to larger premises at 35 Buade where it remained for many years. Over the decades that followed, the store&#x27;s ownership changed hands, as various partners came and went, and the firm&#x27;s name underwent revision. W.S. Henderson eventually sold the store to his brother John, a Montreal businessman, and it became John Henderson &amp; Co. In 1862, with the addition of business partner George Richard Renfrew, the store&#x27;s name changed to Henderson, Renfrew and Company. By the time of Confederation, in 1867, Henderson had retired and Renfrew and V.H. Marcou, whom Henderson had sent to Quebec to manage the business, had become the new principals, with the firm renamed Renfrew &amp; Marcou.

By the middle of the 19th century, the company had begun promoting its fur garments beyond Quebec to a larger North American and European market. An 1890 mail order fur catalogue listed nine different medals and diplomas won at London, Paris, and Philadelphia exhibitions from 1851 to 1888. During its history, the store served many notable patrons. Admirers of John A. Macdonald, Canada&#x27;s first Prime Minister, had decided the coat he had worn during an 1883 visit to Quebec City was not befitting his status as first minister and bought him a new fur coat from the company. Then, in 1886, G.R. Renfrew &amp; Co. received its most prestigious honour, being named &quot;Furriers in Ordinary&quot; by Her Majesty Queen Victoria. The Queen had purchased a number of fur items from the company&#x27;s display at the Indian &amp; Colonial Exhibition held that year at London, England. The &quot;Quebec Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote at length about the appointment:

Visitors to the late provincial exhibition in this city will remember that lithographed copies in duplicate were shown of the royal letters patent from the Mistress of the Robes at Windsor Castle, notifying Messrs. G.R. Renfrew &amp; Co. of their appointment as furriers to the Queen. At the same exhibition this firm exposed a duplicate set in sable to that purchased from them by Her Majesty the Queen in person, at the Indian &amp; Colonial Exhibition in London. In common with many of our readers, we are not of opinion that a firm, any more than a private individual is the better individually, for rubbing against royalty, but we are speaking of business affairs in a business sense, and there is no doubt that Queen Victoria would not have patronized Messrs. G.R. Renfrew &amp; Co. when she wanted a new muff, nor appointed them as her special furriers, unless she was satisfied that their articles were the very best of the kind manufactured, and that she could not do as well elsewhere. It is upon the knowledge of these facts that we congratulate Messrs. G.R. Renfrew &amp; Co., and feel a legitimate pride in the success of our fellow citizens abroad. At home their success is exemplified by the large number of awards made [by] their exhibits, and also by the splendid stock which they always keep on hand in the mammoth establishment.

It was, in fact, the first of a series of royal warrants issued by members of the British Royal Family. In 1901, Holt, Renfrew &amp; Co. was appointed furriers to Her Majesty Queen Alexandra and then to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, in 1903. In 1910, the company was appointed by royal warrant furriers to His Majesty King George V. The last of the royal warrants was issued by the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII, in 1921.

In 1889, the company established its first store outside of Quebec City with a new retail outlet at 71 and 73 King Street East, Toronto. William Henderson had by this time retired and his nephew, Allen E. Renfrew, had become partner.

== Operations during the 20th century ==

In 1900, John Henderson Holt, who began his career as a company clerk, was appointed president and the firm became known as Holt, Renfrew &amp; Co. By 1908, the company&#x27;s structure had changed again and it had become Holt, Renfrew &amp; Co., Limited. Meanwhile, the company continued to display its furs at various international expositions, such as the Franco-British Exhibition, held in London, England, that same year. Described as a &quot;great merger of fur firms&quot; by the press, in 1910 Holt Renfrew acquired Dunlop, Cook Co. Limited, and established new premises at Montreal, on fashionable St. Catherine St. W., in addition to taking over the firm of W. J. Hammond, &quot;the largest fur house in the West,&quot; at Winnipeg, Manitoba. With the death of John H. Holt in 1915, A.E. Renfrew was appointed company president, a position he held until his retirement in 1919.

In 1937, in conjunction with the company&#x27;s 100th anniversary, Holt Renfrew unveiled a new six-storey Montreal headquarters and flagship store. Designed by the Canadian architectural firm of Ross and Macdonald, the structure was built in what became known as the Streamline Moderne style of Art Deco. Women’s Wear Daily wrote of the limestone structure, located at the corner of Sherbrooke and Mountain streets, as &quot;one of the most modernly and attractively appointed retail establishments on this continent&quot; and further commented that &quot;throughout the store the aim has been to secure an effect of luxury and good taste.&quot; Press reports also noted the new store&#x27;s commitment to haute couture and how &quot;New York fashions, as well as London and Paris models, are represented in the dress, coat, sportswear, millinery and other fashion departments.&quot; Holt Renfrew also retailed the work of Canadian high-fashion designers such as Marie-Paule Nolin, whose salon and workroom were hosted by the store during the 1940s.

With the outbreak of armed conflict in Europe and Canada&#x27;s early entry into World War II, Holt Renfrew&#x27;s fashion reflected the new homefront realities. With the rationing of textiles and other materials, the company&#x27;s designs featured shorter sleeves and raised hemlines. Retail expansion during this time was muted, with the exception of Holt Renfrew&#x27;s acquisition of Simon Furs of Ottawa in 1945.

=== Post-Second World War era ===
The conclusion of war saw Holt Renfrew re-emerge as Canada&#x27;s leading furrier and fashion retailer, closely associated with the haute couture of the post-war era. In 1947, on the eve of the impending marriage of Princess Elizabeth, heir to the British throne, and Prince Philip, the company was commissioned by the Canadian government to design the country&#x27;s official wedding gift for the princess. President Alvin J. Walker flew to London, England, with a selection of 85 samples to personally show and take measurements for the Labrador wild mink coat.

Early in the post-war period, Holt Renfrew re-established close working relationships with the leading fashion houses of Europe and North America. By 1947, Alvin Walker signed an agreement with the House of Christian Dior to sell its Paris haute couture in Canada. With Dior&#x27;s &quot;New Look,&quot; and its renewed emphasis on luxury and femininity in women&#x27;s fashion making headlines, it was the beginning of an extended relationship that &quot;linked the name of Holt Renfrew to the most famous fashion designer in the world at the time.&quot; The arrangement soon evolved into an exclusive one as Walker secured an agreement to solely represent Dior in the Canadian marketplace. Newspaper ads for Dior fashion explicitly noted, &quot;only at Holt Renfrew in all of Canada.&quot; Along with Dior, the couture models of other well-known Paris designers were also featured:

Holt Renfrew&#x27;s own fashionists attended the recent Winter Openings of the leading couturiers in Paris. The models selected by them are here...they have arrived by air express. This collection...the largest ever imported by H.R...presents a composite and perfect picture of the New Fashion created by Paris...the dramatic &quot;Wing Line&quot; by CHRISTIAN DIOR...the lovely subtle straightline with sudden flare sponsored by PIERRE BALMAIN...the flattering backward drapery by JACQUES FATH...the sylph-line skirt and Bryonic corsage by MOLYNEUX...the higher waistline ROBERT PIGUET...the tubular skirt with stiffened pockets by JACQUES GRIFFE...and the most perfect black dresses by BALENCIAGA. Included are all types of costumes from the typically Parisian tailleur...for the morning promenade in the Bois...to gay short evening dresses and formal gowns with daring decolletes and short irregular trains.

Holt Renfrew also secured exclusive Canadian rights to the haute couture of Italian designers Simonetta Visconti and Fabiani. Its representatives not only made frequent trips to the fashion houses of Paris, London, New York and Milan but also attended all major fur and fashion shows. One magazine writer commented on how the &quot;eternal watchfulness of Holt Renfrew buyers on the world&#x27;s fashion fronts and their close liaison with outstanding designers and creators of fashions plays an important part in the rapidly growing roster of Holt Renfrew customers.&quot; The company hosted some of the leading international designers. In 1952, Mr. Christian Dior was guest of honour at Holts in Montreal. Three years later, Dior was present for a fashion show of his creations at Holt Renfrew&#x27;s new Toronto store, located along the Mink Mile at 144 Bloor Street West – the country&#x27;s first ever all stainless steel building, noteworthy for its &quot;modern facade of blue glass and gleaming material.&quot; Dior models, from Paris and New York, were specially flown in for the runway event.

=== 1950–1999 ===
The 1950s, also saw the retailer establish new stores in secondary markets, including Edmonton in 1950, Calgary and London in 1953. The chain also opened outlets in some of the country&#x27;s most prominent luxury hotels, including the Royal York, the Chateau Frontenac, and the Château Laurier.

The 1960s, saw Holt Renfrew build on its reputation as a high-end luxury retailer, closely associated with the leading European fashion houses. In 1962, the company announced that it had secured an exclusive agreement to represent Paris designer Yves Saint Laurent and his haute couture in Canada. At the same time, the chain promoted new, more affordable, ready-to-wear fashion designed to attract a younger clientele. It established in-store shops for its Miss Renfrew line, marketed to &quot;Young Careerists, College Girls, and Young Matrons,&quot; who wished to dress fashionably on a budget.

Holt Renfrew&#x27;s retail expansion continued with mall openings at Toronto&#x27;s Yorkdale Shopping Centre in 1964, and Place Ste-Foy, Quebec City, in 1965. By the mid-Sixties, Holt Renfrew experienced a change of ownership with the announcement that the Canadian Acceptance Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of C.I.T. Financial of New York, had acquired 93 percent of the company&#x27;s shares – that after a brief period of ownership by English retailer Blackett &amp; Son Ltd. In 1971, Canadian Acceptance Corporation sold Holt Renfrew to Los Angeles-based department store holding company Broadway-Hale (later renamed Carter Hawley Hale).

The decade also saw a change in leadership as Alvin J. Walker retired after 25 years as company president in 1967. He was succeeded by Lenard M. Shavick. Shavick, who joined Holt Renfrew in the post-war years as a buyer, saw to the chain&#x27;s continued close relationship with the fashion houses of Europe and North America with frequent buying trips aboard. &quot;Every year, Shavick makes three or four trips to the fashion capitals while his staff of 18 buyers follow through with as many as 60 or 70 of their own.&quot; Shavick further saw to the expansion of the chain&#x27;s retail footprint with eleven new stores for a total of 23 outlets by 1971. He unveiled Holt Renfrew&#x27;s first West Coast store at the new Pacific Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1975. Four years later, he oversaw the development of the company&#x27;s new Toronto flagship store, at 50 Bloor Street West, with some of retail space, at a cost of $6.5 million. In 1983, the chain&#x27;s Edmonton branch opened a $6 million, store in Manulife Place – the city&#x27;s newest and tallest building.

The 1980s, saw Holt Renfrew return to Canadian ownership after Carter Hawley Hale of Los Angeles put Holt, its only foreign asset, up for sale. In April 1986, an agreement with Wittington Investments Limited, a Weston family holding company led by W. Galen Weston, was announced. With Michael Brickell as company president, Galen Weston as chairman and wife Hilary M. Weston as vice-chairman, the chain underwent dramatic changes, including the introduction of new retail formats and extensive interior renovations to its lead Toronto and Montreal stores. The new owners gutted some at the Bloor Street West flagship to accommodate new designer boutiques, as the retailer moved to restore a sense of luxury and intimacy. They hired New York retail designer Naomi Leff to guide the renovations and changes to its merchandising mix. In Montreal, they began work to revitalize the grandeur of the original 1937 Art Deco architecture of the Sherbrooke St. store and added Giorgio Armani and Yves Saint Laurent shops to both Toronto and Montreal. A new high-end Holt Renfrew retail magazine, called &quot;Point of View,&quot; was launched a year later.

The 1990s, under president Joel Rath, saw further expansion with some 62 thousand square feet of retail space added, in particular to Holt&#x27;s landmark Montreal store. The Sherbrooke Street site doubled its space in a $30 million expansion that pushed into adjoining buildings to accommodate luxury brand boutiques including Chanel. The decade closed with the appointment of veteran British retailer Andrew Jennings as company president. Jennings vowed to make Holt Renfrew &quot;one of the world&#x27;s great fashion and lifestyle stores.&quot;

== Operations during the 21st century ==
The company entered the new millennium with the relaunch of its retail magazine under the name &quot;Holts.&quot; The seasonal publication became separate women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s editions in 2006. Holt Renfrew also began sponsoring a series of large scale promotional events. In 2002, it hosted &#x27;Viva Italia,&#x27; a celebration of Italian fashion and the performing arts. A year later, the retailer marked &#x27;Flick,&#x27; a Sixites theme gala that coincided with the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2004, Holt Renfrew and Vanity Fair presented &#x27;Vinyl,&#x27; a &quot;hot pink, style-in-the-groove&quot; celebration of music and fashion.

With the departure of Andrew Jennings, Caryn Lerner took over as president in 2004. Lerner, the first woman to lead Holt Renfrew, had previously held senior management positions at QVC, Jones New York, Barneys New York and Bloomingdale&#x27;s and Escada.
In 2005, Holt Renfrew underwent an extensive rebranding. Led by Alannah Weston, creative director at Selfridges and daughter of Holt Renfew chairman W. Galen Weston, a new logo, reflecting the company&#x27;s historic past, and magenta colour was adopted across the chain. Other changes included the return of children&#x27;s wear and more retail space devoted to footwear.
More than three decades after opening its first Vancouver outlet, Holt Renfrew unveiled a new store at 737 Dunsmuir Street in June 2007. Described by one design critic as a &quot;glossy monument to high-end chic the store featured a pillowed glass exterior and a three-storey atrium. At , the new space represented more than double the retail square footage of the old store at 633 Granville Street, located at the opposite end of the Pacific Centre. Two years later, a new Calgary store was officially unveiled. Both retail spaces were the design work of the New York City firm of Janson Goldstein.

=== 2010–present ===

In 2010, Canadian retail executive Mark Derbyshire replaced Caryn Lerner as president. Derbyshire expressed his desire to do more to appeal to the men&#x27;s segment of the fashion market.

In 2012, Holt Renfrew marked its 175th anniversary with a series of major events across the country. Birthday celebrations were capped off with the release of limited edition HR175 designer merchandise and a large street party at its Bloor Street West store. In 2013, the company announced a new retail initiative called &quot;hr2,&quot; a chain of outlets focused on mid-priced designer merchandise and luxury goods. The hr2 stores were closed in 2017.
== Retail formats ==
=== Full-line stores ===
Holt Renfrew also has contributed to promote new brands, such as Greta Constantine, designed by Kirk Pickersgill and Stephen Wong.

In October 2014, the company opened a menswear-only location called Holt Renfrew Men at 100 Bloor St W, next to the Harry Rosen Inc. flagship store, to complement the existing Holt Renfrew flagship store at 50 Bloor St W.

In July 2016, the company opened a location at Square One Shopping Center in Mississauga, Ontario, while a smaller Sherway Gardens location nearby closed the same month.

The closure of the Ottawa and Quebec City stores was announced in August 2014.

==== Holts Café ====
The Bloor Street, Yorkdale, Montreal, and Vancouver locations include &quot;Holts Café&quot;, an informal diner-like restaurant concept, that features tartine made from Poilane bread that is flown in directly from Paris, France. The 80-seat Vancouver location was designed by Yabu Pushelberg. Holts Cafés long planned for Square One and Calgary have not materialized.

=== Defunct formats ===
Other recent closures include the &quot;Last Call&quot; end-of-the-line store at Vaughan Mills in Vaughan, Ontario, and the Last Call outlet in Winnipeg. The remaining Holt Renfrew personal shopping suites and a cosmetics outlet in Winnipeg closed in 2015. The Edmonton store which had been in the podium of Manulife Place since 1982 closed on January 11, 2020, ending the chain&#x27;s 70 years of continuous operation in the city. This is as the company has been focusing on larger stores with or more.

<text>Radovan Richta (6 June 1924 – 21 July 1983) was a Czechoslovak philosopher who coined the term technological evolution; a theory about how societies diminish physical labour by increasing mental labour.

Richta&#x27;s first work was &quot;Člověk a technika v revoluci našich dnů&quot; (&quot;Man and Technology in the Revolution of Our Day&quot;), published in 1963. This work did much to bring the concept of technology into the forefront of philosophical thought during the 1960s. Richta then went on to publish &quot;Civilizace na rozcestí&quot; (&quot;Civilization at the Crossroads&quot;) in 1966. &quot;Crossroads&quot; was a compilation work published by 60 authors (including and led by Richta) that &quot;attempt[ed] to analyze the social and human implications of the scientific and technological revolution&quot;. The concepts touched on in &quot;Crossroads&quot; are considered by some philosophical historians to be very ground-breaking for their time.

Richta developed the famous term of &quot;Socialism with a human face&quot; serving as a motto of the Prague Spring period. He became the director of the Institute for Philosophy and Sociology of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1969–1982.

== Life ==
Richta was born in Prague. During World War II, Richta organized a resistance movement against the Nazis, and his organization became part of the communist resistance in the critical moment of the worst persecution (or man-hunting). Richta was arrested and held prisoner for several months. He was saved by the Swiss Red Cross when they collected prisoners with the worst cases of tuberculosis and extracted them to Switzerland. Shortly after the rescue Richta&#x27;s former fellow prisoners were executed on 2 May 1945.

After the war Richta became quite ill, and beginning in 1958 he periodically spent time in sanatoria. In between bouts of sickness, and in a compromise with his doctors who prescribed complete bed rest, Richta studied and worked very hard.

In the 1960s Richta took on the role of the leader of an interdisciplinary research team. In 1963 they released their first works - &quot;Člověk a technika v revoluci našich dnů&quot; (&quot;Man and technology in the revolution of our days&quot;) and &quot;Komunismus a proměny lidského života&quot; (K povaze humanismu naší doby) (&quot;Communism and changes of human life.

<text>Ubud is a town on the Indonesian island of Bali in Ubud District, located amongst rice paddies and steep ravines in the central foothills of the Gianyar regency. Promoted as an arts and culture centre, it has developed a large tourism industry. It forms a northern part of the Greater Denpasar metropolitan area (known as &quot;Sarbagita&quot;).

Ubud is an administrative district (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) with a population of 74,800 (as of the 2020 Census) in an area of 42.38 km2. The central area of Ubud &quot;desa&quot; (village) has a population of 11,971 and an area of 6.76 km2, and receives more than three million foreign tourists each year. The area surrounding the town is made up of farms, rice paddies, agroforestry plantations, and tourist accommodations. As of 2018, more tourists visited Ubud than Denpasar to the south.

== History ==

Eighth-century legend tells of a Javanese priest, Rsi Markandya, who meditated at the confluence of two rivers (an auspicious site for Hindus) at the Ubud locality of Campuhan. Here he founded the Gunung Lebah Temple on the valley floor, the site of which remains a pilgrim destination.

The town was originally important as a source of medicinal herbs and plants; Ubud gets its name from the Balinese word &quot;ubad&quot; (medicine).

In the late 19th century, Ubud became the seat of feudal lords who owed their allegiance to the king of Gianyar, at one time the most powerful of Bali&#x27;s southern states. The lords were members of the Balinese Kshatriya caste of Suk and were significant supporters of the village&#x27;s increasingly renowned arts scene.

Antonio Blanco, a Spanish-American artist, lived in Ubud from 1952 until he died in 1999. A new burst of creative energy came in the 1960s after the arrival of Dutch painter Arie Smit and the development of the Young Artists Movement. The Bali tourist boom since the late 1960s has seen much development in the town.

In 2002, terrorist bombings caused a decline in tourism throughout Bali including Ubud. In response to this, a writer&#x27;s festival was created, Ubud Writers and Readers Festival to help revive tourism, the island&#x27;s main economic lifeline.

== Streets ==
The main street is Jalan Raya Ubud (Jalan Raya means &quot;main road&quot;), which runs east–west through the center of town. Two long roads, Jalan Monkey Forest and Jalan Hanoman, extend south from Jalan Raya Ubud.

== Buildings ==
Puri Saren Agung is a large palace located at the intersection of Monkey Forest and Raya Ubud roads. The residence of Tjokorda Gede Agung Sukawati (1910–1978), the last ruling monarch of Ubud, is still owned by the royal family. Dance performances and ceremonies are held in its courtyard. The palace was also one of Ubud&#x27;s first hotels, opening its doors back in the 1930s.

Some Hindu temples exist, such as Pura Desa Ubud, which is the main temple, Pura Taman Saraswati, and Pura Dalem Agung Padangtegal, the temple of death. The Gunung Kawi temple is the site of the royal tombs. Goa Gajah, also known as the Elephant Cave, is located in a steep valley just outside Ubud near the town of Bedulu.

The Moon of Pejeng, in nearby Pejeng, is the largest single-cast bronze kettle drum in the world, dating from circa 300BC. It is a popular destination for tourists interested in local culture.

== Transportation ==
Like other towns popular with tourists in Bali, it is not permitted to order a metered taxi or ride-sharing service for pickup within Ubud. Instead, a taxi and price must be negotiated with a member of the local taxi cooperative. This protectionist system ensures the driver is from the local area, and also keeps the fares inflated to up to 10 times the rates available elsewhere.

== Economy ==
The economy of Ubud is highly reliant on tourism which focuses on shopping, resorts, museums, yoga, and zoos. There is a strong focus on sustainable economy regarding the retail industry in Ubud, with many Bali-grown brands favoring materials and ingredients that would not cause much waste to the environment. From home and living amenities to tropical clothing brands, Ubud has quite a unique array of retail selections that have proven attractive to tourists from around the world.

One of the initiatives that have boosted Ubud as another popular tourist destination in recent years is the Ubud Food Festival (UFF). Happening in less than a week every April, this festival brings fellow restaurateurs and restaurants in Ubud together to create either special menus or particular promotions that may not be available in other months.

In contrast to the tourist area in southern Bali, the Ubud area is less densely populated by locals. However, tourists far outnumber locals, with the Gianyar regency seeing 3,842,663 tourist arrivals in 2017 - 1.3 million alone visiting Ubud Monkey Forest.

== Culture ==
The town and area have some art museums, such as the Blanco Renaissance Museum, the Puri Lukisan Museum, the Neka Art Museum, and the Agung Rai Museum of Art. The Museum Rudana in Peliatan is nearby. Galleries promoting local and overseas crafts are abound, too, in Ubud. Some often hold exhibitions focused on stimulating a dialogue between both local and international artists, and less about selling artworks. One of the primary examples is BIASA ArtSpace, founded by art enthusiast and fashion designer Susanna Perini.

The &quot;Tek Tok&quot; is a traditional Balinese dance that is accompanied by the musical sound of mouth &#x27;Tek Tok&#x27; altogether with various combinations of body movement and other sounds. 
The story Draupadi Parwa told in the Tek Tok Dance tells a moral message, when a woman who embodies the values of patience, sacrifice, compassion, devotion, and holy sincerity is disrespected, then disasters and calamities will befall a kingdom or state. This story also conveys the message that truth, virtue, devotion, and genuine compassion will always be protected by God. The Tek Tok dance performance is held regularly at the Bali Culture Center (BCC) in Ubud four times a week. Ubud Writers and Readers Festival (UWRF) is held every year, which is participated by writers and readers from all over the world.

Many Balinese dances are performed around Ubud including the Legong by the Peliatan Dance Group, the first troupe to travel abroad.

==Climate==
Ubud has a tropical rainforest climate (Af).
==Administration==
Ubud kecamatan/district is made of up the following desa (villages): Kedewatan, Sayan, Singakerta, Peliatan, Mas, Lodtunduh, Petulu, and Ubud itself.

== Nature ==
The Mandala Suci Wenara Wana is known to Westerners as the Ubud Monkey Forest. The grounds contain an active temple and are located near the southern end of Monkey Forest Street. This protected area houses the Pura Dalem Agung Padangtegal, and as of June 2017, approximately 750 crab-eating macaques (&quot;Macaca fascicularis&quot;) monkeys live there.

The Campuhan Ridge Walk is a hill in nearby Campuhan, from where one can see two rivers, Tukad Yeh Wos Kiwa, and Tukad Yeh Wos Tengen, merge. A one-meter wide paved-block track runs about two kilometers to the top of the hill which is a popular spot to watch the sunset.

Goa Gajah: Also known as the Elephant Cave, Goa Gajah is an archaeological site with intricate carvings and a tranquil meditation cave.

Tegunungan Waterfall is one of the highest waterfalls in the Ubud area of Bali. With a height of more than 40 meters from the ground, this waterfall is surrounded by green scenery.

<text>Herbert Geoffrey Willans, RNVR, (4 February 1911 – 6 August 1958), an English writer and journalist, is best known as the creator of Nigel Molesworth, the &quot;goriller of 3B&quot; and &quot;curse of St. Custard&#x27;s&quot;, as in the four books with illustrations by Ronald Searle.

Willans was born in Smyrna (now İzmir) in Turkey, where his father was a superintendent of the Ottoman Aidan Railway.

He was educated at Blundells School in Tiverton, and became a schoolmaster there. He also taught at Sutherland House, Surrey and Carn Brea School, Bromley. He enjoyed sailing in small boats. During the Second World War he took part in the Greek campaign and the Battle of Crete in the Eastern Mediterranean, serving on the corvette . He later joined the carrier .

Molesworth first appeared in &quot;Punch&quot; in 1939, and later became the protagonist and narrator of four books: &quot;Down with Skool!&quot; (1953), &quot;How to be Topp&quot; (1954), &quot;Wizz for Atomms&quot; (1956) and, after Willans&#x27;s death, &quot;Back in the Jug Agane&quot; (1959). All four were collected in &quot;The Compleet Molesworth&quot;. Comic misspellings, erratic capitalisation and schoolboy slang are threads running through all the books.

According to Ronald Searle in his obituary of Willans in &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;His cunning was more refined than Bunter ... Willans was delighted that schoolmasters, far from feeling publicly disrobed, were in fact giving away his books as end of school prizes.&quot;

Willans wrote other books. A review in &quot;The Times&quot; described his novel &quot;The Whistling Arrow&quot; (1957) as having a futuristic aeroplane as the &#x27;heroine&#x27;; &quot;It is his apparent strength in writing about planes and the people that flew them.&quot; The reviewer compared it with one of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s earlier novels. The idea of a &#x27;whistling arrow&#x27; was popularised by the Walt Disney Studio film &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; (1952), starring Richard Todd, where arrows that whistled were used as signals between Robin Hood and his outlaw band.

Willans also co-wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;The Bridal Path&quot; (1959), which starred George Cole, but he died of a heart attack in London at the age of 47 before the film was released. He also wrote a number of other, mostly humorous, books, including &quot;The Dog&#x27;s Ear Book&quot; (also with Searle), &quot;My Uncle Harry&quot; (an exploration of the British gentlemen&#x27;s club), &quot;Fasten Your Lapstraps!&quot; (an account of the early days of intercontinental flight) and &quot;Admiral on Horseback&quot; (a more serious one about the Royal Navy).

<doc id="1260508" wikidata="Q7370262" url="?curid=1260508" title="Rotary combination lock">
<text>A rotary combination lock is a lock commonly used to secure safes and as an unkeyed padlock mechanism. This type of locking mechanism consists of a single dial which must be rotated left and right in a certain combination in order to open the lock.

==Design and operation==

An externally-accessible &quot;dial&quot; is manipulated to release the shackle of a padlock or a lock bolt securing a door. The dial is connected to an internal mechanism, usually containing three separate &quot;wheels&quot; with notches, called &quot;gates&quot;. Each wheel must be aligned to allow a &quot;fence&quot; to drop into the gates, releasing the &quot;lever&quot; that holds the lock in place, allowing the lock to open. Generally, this is accomplished by moving the dial to three (or more) positions, usually denoted by numbers, in a specific sequence of alternating clockwise and anti-clockwise turns.

The wheels are generally arranged in a stacked wheel pack sharing a single axis of rotation, and the individual rotary position of each wheel can be manipulated by turning the dial left and right. The dial is mechanically connected via its &quot;spindle&quot; to a &quot;cam&quot; that is equipped with a &quot;drive pin&quot; — a sort of nub — that can engage a corresponding small catch (known as a &quot;fly&quot;) on the side of the closest wheel facing the cam; the fly either can be fixed or move within a limited range. On the opposite face of that closest first wheel is another drive pin, which can engage a fly on the side of the second wheel (next-closest to the cam) that is facing the first wheel. Similarly, the second wheel has another drive pin on its opposite face that can engage a fly on the third wheel. Many combination locks have three wheels, but the lock may be equipped with additional wheels, each with a drive pin and fly, in a similar manner. The number of wheels in the mechanism determines the number of specific dial positions that must be entered to open the lock, so a three-sequence combination is required for a three-wheel lock.

As the dial rotates, there will not be enough space for the drive pin on the cam to pass the fly on that face of the first wheel closest to the cam, and so the first wheel will begin to rotate with the dial once the drive pin on the cam engages the fly of the first wheel. The first wheel (closest to the cam) is said to be &quot;picked up&quot; when this occurs. As this first wheel rotates, its drive pin will in turn engage the fly on the second wheel and the second wheel will begin rotating with the dial and the closest wheel in a similar fashion. Once all wheels are &quot;picked up&quot; and rotating together with the dial, the dial is rotated until the first position/number of the combination is indicated, which means the wheel furthest from the cam is in place and its gate is aligned under the fence. The number of wheels also determines the number of rotations past the first position required to reset the lock; since picking up all the wheels requires a number of rotations equal to the number of wheels, the final wheel (furthest from the cam) cannot be not picked up and positioned until the minimum number of rotations is completed.

After the furthest wheel is positioned, by reversing the rotation of the dial, all the drive pins and flys disengage; as the dial continues to rotate in the opposite direction, the cam will again &quot;pick up&quot; the wheels in sequence (starting from the first wheel, closest to the cam) until all the wheels (save the wheel furthest from the cam) rotate together. In this way, the remaining wheels are rotated without disturbing the alignment of the furthest wheel. Once the second position/number is indicated, the next-to-furthest wheel is in place and its gate is properly aligned with the fence. The rotation of the dial is then reversed again until the remaining wheels are picked up and the gate of the next wheel is aligned with the fence. In this way, by turning the dial back and forth to the correct sequence of positions, all the wheels will be aligned with their gates positioned under the fence.
Once the gates are aligned on all the wheels, the fence drops into the gates, allowing the &quot;nose&quot; of the lever to engage with a corresponding gate in the cam. Further rotation of the dial moves the lever, retracting the locking mechanism and opening the lock.

When the cams are aligned and the shackle is put back in (after it was taken out after unlocking), the force required to push it back in rattles the system and may often cause the cams lose their alignment, thus locking once more.

===Wheel sandwich construction===
Wheels are typically made of a three-layer sandwich. The outer layers, known as the &quot;wheel case&quot;, contain the gate and surround the externally-toothed &quot;wheel center&quot;, &quot;change key cam&quot;, and &quot;lever arm&quot;s. When a change key is inserted into the lock mechanism, it forces apart the lever arms, which then permits the wheel center to rotate freely. This in turn allows the owner to set a custom combination.

===Additional security===
Some rotary combination locks include internal &quot;relockers&quot; or &quot;relocking devices&quot; that separately lock the shackle or bolt when an attack is detected, including mechanical levers that respond to attempts to dislodge the locking mechanism (&quot;punching&quot;), thermal (fusible) links that melt in response to a cutting attempt, or tempered glass that breaks in response to a drilling attempt.

Wheels may be made of radiotransparent materials such as Nylon, Lexan, or Delrin to prevent the use of X-ray imaging to determine the wheel position and required combination.

<text>Isabel Bassett (born August 23, 1939) is a Canadian broadcaster and former politician. From 1999 until 2005 she was the chair and CEO of TVOntario/TFO, Ontario&#x27;s provincial public television network. She has been a controversial figure at times, but is also a highly regarded pioneer in Canadian broadcasting.

==Background==
Bassett was born Isabel Glenthorne Macdonald in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She received a Bachelor of Arts from Queen&#x27;s University and a Master of Arts from York University in 1973. As well, she graduated from teacher&#x27;s college and taught English and French at Humberside Collegiate Institute.

Bassett first entered Canadian public life as a journalist for the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; in the 1960s. She later joined CTV, where she became a prominent reporter and documentary producer, including a stint with &quot;W5&quot;, after marrying Baton Broadcasting owner John W. H. Bassett on July 17, 1967. Although her documentary work for CTV won numerous awards, she was sometimes accused of having been given her position solely because she was married to the owner. John Bassett died in 1998, and Isabel subsequently began a relationship with cabinet colleague Ernie Eves. Bassett has also written a number of books on the political, social and historical achievements of Canadian women.

==Politics==
In the federal election of 1993, Bassett ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the Toronto riding of St. Paul&#x27;s. She lost to Liberal Barry Campbell by over 15,000 votes.

Bassett was elected in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal candidate Carolyn Bennett (later a federal Member of Parliament) by about 3,500 votes. She served as the Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for St. Andrew—St. Patrick for the next four years. On October 10, 1997, she was appointed Minister of Citizenship, Culture and Recreation in the government of Mike Harris. Despite the Harris government&#x27;s right-wing reputation, Bassett is a Red Tory, and was one of the most socially progressive members of the Harris cabinet.

In the 1999 provincial election, Bassett was defeated in the new provincial riding of St. Paul&#x27;s by Liberal candidate Michael Bryant. She was one of several Toronto Progressive Conservatives defeated in the city due to the unpopularity of Harris&#x27; government.

===Cabinet positions===

==TVOntario==
After the election, Bassett was appointed as head of TVOntario by Mike Harris. Her mandate was to refocus the network on educational programming; however, Bassett successfully found ways to ensure that the network&#x27;s most popular non-educational programs, such as &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; and &quot;Studio 2&quot;, could continue to air.

Bassett&#x27;s position again became controversial when Eves became Premier of Ontario in 2002, with media critics noting the potential conflict of interest inherent in Bassett remaining as head of TVOntario while simultaneously in a common law relationship with the provincial premier. However, Bassett was popular within TVOntario, and the controversy soon subsided. She remained chair and CEO of TVOntario until September 29, 2005, when the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty separated the two positions. Bassett&#x27;s successors were film producer Peter O&#x27;Brian as chair, and former Astral Media executive Lisa de Wilde as CEO.

==Honours==
In 2016, she was made a member of the Order of Ontario.

On June 30, 2016, Bassett was made a Member of the Order of Canada for &quot;her community engagement and commitment to the advancement of women and public service, notably in educational broadcasting.&quot;

<text>Cel-Ray is a celery-flavored soft drink from Dr. Brown&#x27;s.

==History==
Dr. Brown&#x27;s sodas are kosher, are often sold in Jewish delicatessens and restaurants, and can also be found in specialty grocers and grocery stores that specialize in American food in Israel. The flavor, derived from celery seed extract, is reminiscent of ginger ale but with a pronounced celery flavor that is more pungent or peppery than ginger ale.

Dr. Brown&#x27;s Celery Tonic was, according to the company, first produced in 1868 in Brooklyn, New York. It was served in New York delicatessens starting in 1869 and sold as a bottled soda starting in 1886. The Food and Drug Administration objected to its being called a &quot;tonic&quot;, and in the 1900s the name was changed to Dr. Brown&#x27;s Cel-Ray (soda). Cel-Ray was so popular in the 1930s among New York City&#x27;s Jewish community that it earned the nickname &quot;Jewish Champagne&quot;. Dr. Brown&#x27;s briefly produced a diet Cel-Ray, but it was discontinued due to low sales. Other &quot;celery tonics&quot;/&quot;celery sodas&quot; were produced in the 1890s, but only Dr. Brown&#x27;s celery product remains today.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1954 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Half Magic&quot; by Edward Eager, the children are intrigued by the &quot;celery soda&quot; available at their local soda shop.
* The character of Billy Rose (played by James Caan) in the 1975 film &quot;Funny Lady&quot; habitually drinks celery tonic as an alternative to alcohol.
* In the 1982 film &quot;Tootsie&quot;, not referred to as &quot;Cel-Ray&quot;, rather &quot;celery tonic&quot; as the reason of what was spilled on the video tape and hence why a live performance of that day&#x27;s show was required.
* In the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; season eight episode &quot;The Pothole&quot;, Jerry says that he bruised his lip drinking a Cel-Ray.
* In the book &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay,&quot; Cel-Ray is a favorite drink of Sammy Clay&#x27;s father, the Molecule Man, or the World&#x27;s Strongest Jew.
* Cel-Ray is used as a plot point in the web series &quot;Emma Approved.&quot;
* In the 2004 novel &quot;Wake Up, Sir!&quot; by Jonathan Ames, Cel-Ray is the favorite drink of the narrator.
* In issue #205 of &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot;, Gordo asks Rikki to pick up a six pack of Cel-Ray for him.
* In the 2013 novel &quot;Bleeding Edge&quot; by Thomas Pynchon, Cel-Ray is referred to as &quot;Jewish champagne&quot; and served at &quot;a possibly make-believe Jewish delicatessen, Bagels &#x27;n&#x27; Blintzes&quot;.
* in &quot;History of the World, Part II&quot; in Season 1 Episode 3, a vendor offers Stalin a celery soda.

<doc id="1260519" wikidata="Q4966763" url="?curid=1260519" title="Bridgeton, Glasgow">
<text>Bridgeton (, ) is a district to the east of Glasgow city centre. Historically part of Lanarkshire, it is bounded by Glasgow Green to the west, Dalmarnock to the east and south, Calton to the north-west at Abercromby Street/London Road and Broad street to the north-east.

==History==

It started as a small weaving village in 1705, when the third John Walkinshaw marked out a portion of his Goosefauld estate for rent. However, not much interest was shown until 1776 when Rutherglen Bridge was built over the River Clyde and the area became known as &quot;Bridge Town&quot; (or &quot;Brig Toun&quot; in Scots). The area was incorporated into the city of Glasgow officially in 1846. A major employer was carpet manufacturer James Templeton &amp; Co. Bridgeton used to be bounded by a village named Mile-End to the north, however this district seems to have vanished over the years, resulting in Bridgeton&#x27;s boundary moving north to Crownpoint Road.

==Bridgeton Cross==

Bridgeton Cross, also known as &#x27;The Toll&#x27; is a major junction, the meeting point of London Road (A74 towards Celtic Park), Dalmarnock Road (A749), Main Street, James Street (leading to Glasgow Green), Olympia Street and Orr Street.

The intersection is notable for the , a Victorian (1875) cast iron bandstand covering the centre of the Cross. The Category A listed landmark structure and surrounds was renovated in the early 21st century, resulting in improved public realm areas and the complete refurbishment of the Umbrella.

Bridgeton Cross is the location for Bridgeton railway station (opened in 1895, closed in 1964, reopened in 1979) which is on the Argyle Line connecting the area to central Glasgow. The Category B listed building which previously housed Bridgeton Central railway station (1892-1979) is a short distance away. A number of local buses also pass along London Road and Dalmarnock Road.

The Cross is also the location for the &quot;Olympia Theatre&quot; (built 1911), which after lying abandoned for many years has undergone rebuilding and reopened in 2012 as a library and community facility for the people of Bridgeton. There are several public houses in the vicinity, with most themed around Rangers F.C.

In 1893 William Millard started &quot;Millers Linoleum Stores&quot;, renting sheds in Charles Street (now Olympia Street) from the North British Railway Company. On 26 June 1913 planning permission was granted to build a two-storey warehouse on this land, which had now been purchased by Millard. Under the directorship of William&#x27;s great-grandson David Millard, the building was sympathetically renovated in 2013. Believed to be the only surviving family business from the 1800s in the area, &quot;Millers 1893&quot; continues to operate.

==Points of interest==
Bridgeton has one of Glasgow&#x27;s original Carnegie libraries, designed by the Invernesian architect, James Robert Rhind. Since 2014, the library has been in use by the Glasgow Women&#x27;s Library, holding a lending library, archive and museum collection, who have made significant renovations both inside and out.

After the 2014 Commonwealth Games was held in Glasgow, Bridgeton now has international-class sporting facilities within walking distance: the Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome are located in nearby Dalmarnock, with the &quot;Crownpoint Sports Complex&quot;, a modern outdoor athletics track, also located in the area adjacent to St Mungo&#x27;s Academy.

Bridgeton has been the centre of the Orange Order in Scotland. Their marches are a fairly common sight in Glasgow during the summer months but reach a peak around the Twelfth of July when the parades commemorating the Battle of the Boyne are in full flow. In 2019, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reported that concerns over an incident during the 2018 Apprentice Boys of Derry (Bridgeton) march had led to suggestions that Glasgow council reroute the march to avoid passing near two Catholic churches.

The Glasgow Vintage Vehicle Trust, one of the largest voluntary commercial and passenger vehicle preservation groups in Scotland are based at Bridgeton Bus Garage which opened on 5 June 1965 on a site bordered by London Road to the south, Fordneuk Street to the West, Broad Street to the north and Rimsdale Street to the east. It replaced the former tram depot at Dalmarnock which had suffered fire damage. In 1870 a grocer name of John Wilson of 13 Main Street and a few friends from the local bowling club founded Bridgeton Burns Club, a charity which continues to this day, assisting local children.

Bridgeton&#x27;s use as a Glasgow Bus Garage was brief, the tendency was to use a smaller fleet of larger buses and that led to the garage being closed in 1976, however it was then taken on by Strathclyde Regional Council for its Internal Transport fleet, servicing everything from light vans to Gritting Lorries. In this capacity it later passed to Glasgow City Council who when they ceased using it for that purpose were prevailed upon to rent it out for vehicle preservation.

==Football==
For four decades in the mid-20th century, Bridgeton was represented in the Scottish Junior Football Association by Bridgeton Waverley F.C. Initially a local Juvenile team, upon joining the Junior setup they played at Shawfield Stadium (home of Clyde F.C.), then moved to &quot;Barrowfield Park&quot; which was bought and demolished by Glasgow Corporation for the construction of the housing scheme of the same name in the 1930s. Waverley then moved to &quot;New Barrowfield&quot; on the edge of the Parkhead district. After they folded in the 1960s, that site became the training ground of Celtic F.C.

Another Junior club which became defunct around the same time, Strathclyde F.C., was also based in the area. Strathclyde&#x27;s predecessor senior league club Thistle F.C. had their roots in Bridgeton/Dalmarnock, as did the aforementioned Clyde and the 19th century side Eastern F.C. who both once played at another Barrowfield Park.

Although Celtic&#x27;s stadium is nearby the district is now known for a large and passionate Rangers following.

<doc id="1260534" wikidata="Q158470" url="?curid=1260534" title="Mount Agung">
<text>Mount Agung (, ) is an active volcano in Karangasem Regency, Bali, Indonesia. It is located southeast of Mount Batur volcano, also in Bali. It is the highest point on Bali, and dominates the surrounding area, influencing the climate, especially rainfall patterns. From a distance, the mountain appears to be perfectly conical. From the peak of the mountain, it is possible to see the peak of Mount Rinjani on the nearby island of Lombok, to the east, although both mountains are frequently covered in clouds. Agung is a stratovolcano, with a large and deep crater. Its most recent eruptions occurred from 2017–2019.

== History of eruptions ==

=== 1843 eruption ===

Agung erupted in 1843, as recorded in a report by Heinrich Zollinger:

=== 1963–64 eruption ===
The eruption of 1963 was one of the largest and most devastating eruptions in Indonesia&#x27;s history.

On February 18, 1963, local residents heard loud explosions and saw clouds rising from the crater of Mount Agung. On February 24, lava began flowing down the northern slope of the mountain, eventually traveling 7 km in the next 20 days. On March 17, the volcano erupted (VEI 5), sending debris 8 to 10 km into the air and generating massive pyroclastic flows.
These flows devastated numerous villages, killing an estimated 1,100–1,500 people. Cold lahars caused by heavy rainfall after the eruption killed an additional 200. A second eruption on May 16 led to pyroclastic flows that killed another 200 inhabitants. Minor eruptions and flows followed and lasted almost a year.

The lava flows missed, sometimes by mere metres, the Mother Temple of Besakih. The saving of the temple is regarded by Balinese as miraculous and a signal from the gods that they wished to demonstrate their power but not destroy the monument that the Balinese had erected.

During the eruptions and earthquakes, the wreck of the US transport ship, USAT Liberty, which had been grounded at nearby Tulamben during World War II after being torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, slipped off the beach and settled totally underwater.

Andesite was the dominant lava type with some samples mafic enough to be classified as basaltic andesite. The eruption had global effects on temperatures.
=== 2017–2019 seismic activity and eruption ===

In late 2017, the area experienced 844 volcanic earthquakes, peaking at 300 to 400 earthquakes on 26 September. The frequency and intensity of these quakes caused much alarm among seismologists, as similar volcanoes have historically been known to erupt with even fewer warning signs. Alert was raised to the highest level and about 122,500 people were evacuated from their houses around the volcano. The Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority declared a 12-kilometre exclusion zone around the volcano on 24 September.

Evacuees gathered in sports halls and other community buildings around Klungkung, Karangasem, Buleleng, and other areas. By late October 2017, the activity of the volcano decreased significantly, leading to lowering of the highest status of emergency on 29 October.

On 21 November, activity increased once again. A phreatic eruption took place, with the ash cloud top reaching above sea level. Thousands of people immediately fled the area, and over 29,000 temporary refugees were reported to be housed in over 270 locations nearby. Early on Saturday 25 November a magmatic eruption 
began. The resulting eruption plume was reported to rise about 1.5–4 km above the summit crater, drifting towards the south and dusting the surroundings with thin layer of dark ash, leading some airlines to cancel flights bound for Australia and New Zealand. An orange glow was later observed around the crater at night, suggesting that fresh magma had indeed reached the surface. On 26 November 2017, another eruption occurred, the second in less than a week. Ngurah Rai International Airport was closed 26 November 2017, leaving many tourists stranded. Lahars were reported in the Selat district south of the volcano. More than 100,000 people in a radius of the volcano were ordered to evacuate.

Australia&#x27;s Bureau of Meteorology reported on 27 November that ash from the eruption had been observed at an altitude of 9,144 m. By the beginning of December, the eruption reduced to minor emissions of steam and smoke. On 12 December, a picture of the crater was taken showing a steadily growing lava dome occupying approximately one third of the crater.

In June 2018, Agung erupted with 2 km high plumes interrupting air traffic. On 3 July, a Strombolian explosion occurred, sending debris in all directions. In late May 2019 an eruption spewed lava and rocks over about 3 km, with some ash falling on nearby villages and temporarily interrupting international flights.

== Influence on the climate ==
In Bali, the wet or rainy season runs from November to March – but it does not wet the whole island equally. The mountain range of Gunung Agung creates a rain shadow that divides the island between a dry northern part (narrower) and a wet southern part (broader). In the 1984–2009 period, the average annual rainfall in the northern part was 1761.3 mm / year, while the southern part received 2024.5 mm / year.

Of the 27 wildfires recorded in Bali&#x27;s forests and savannas in September 2023, 13 – nearly half – occurred in the area surrounding Mount Agung in the Karangasem Regency; 5 fires were in the Buleleng Regency (northern part of the island) and 5 were near Mount Batur in the Bangli Regency. (Temperatures decrease from April to July, then rise again from August onward.)

==Religious beliefs==
Balinese people believe that Mt Agung is a replica of Mt Meru, the central axis of the universe. The most important temple on Bali, Pura Besakih, is high on the slopes of Gunung Agung.

<doc id="1260546" wikidata="Q1139342" url="?curid=1260546" title="Creation Research Society">
<text>The Creation Research Society (CRS) is a Christian fundamentalist group that requires of its members belief that the Bible is historically and scientifically true in the original autographs, belief that &quot;original created kinds&quot; of all living things were created during the Creation week described in Genesis, and belief in flood geology. 

The organization has produced various publications describing what it calls creation science, including a journal and a creation-based biology textbook; use of the textbook in public schools was ruled unconstitutional in &quot;Hendren v. Campbell&quot;. 

During the first few years of its existence, different beliefs about Creationism and disagreement over its statement of beliefs resulted in various members of the CRS board and voting members being forced out of the organization.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
Walter E. Lammerts formed the organization in the 1950s after becoming concerned that the American Scientific Affiliation was falling under the influence of theistic evolution. It was originally named the Creation Research Advisory Committee in February 1963, and headed by Walter E. Lammerts and William J. Tinkle with assistance from Henry M. Morris. The committee originally consisted of ten creationists: Lammerts, Tinkle, Morris, John W. Klotz, Frank Lewis Marsh, Edwin Y. Monsma, Duane Gish, Wilbert H. Rusch, John J. Grebe, and R. Laird Harris. The CRS was later formed in June 1963, with the original advisory committee constituting the new society&#x27;s &#x27;steering committee&#x27;, with Karl W. Linsenmann, David A. Warriner and John N. Moore joining it at that time. At about the same time, Morris recruited Harold Slusher, Thomas G. Barnes, Willis L. Webb and later Clifford L. Burdlick. Finally, Paul A. Zimmerman joined it. By the end of the year had expanded to approximately fifty members. Members with at least an M.Sc. or equivalent were eligible to be voting members.

===Textbook project===
In response to the Sputnik-inspired emphasis on science education, and the resultant Biological Sciences Curriculum Study textbooks (which emphasised evolution for the first time), creationists in the early 1960s were searching for an orthodox and up-to-date creationist biology textbook. The CRS responded with &quot;Biology: A Search for Order in Complexity&quot;, published in 1970 by Christian publisher Zondervan, which was a mixed success, selling out its first run of 10,000, and being approved by a number of state textbook committees but being adopted by few public schools. After an Indiana school attempted to make exclusive use of it, a state court ruled that its use in public schools was unconstitutional (in &quot;Hendren v. Campbell&quot;) stating:
== Beliefs and stated purpose ==

The statement of belief was an issue of discussion among the 10 founders during its formation, with typical wrangling over wording, and little consensus beyond keeping out anyone supportive of evolution. There was concern whether Flood Geology would be able to explain all geologic evidence, and whether the six literal-day creation included the creation of the universe.

The CRS adopted the following statement of belief, mandatory for all members:

The society&#x27;s stated purpose is &quot;publication and research which impinge on creation as an alternate view of origins&quot;.

The CRS&#x27;s statement of belief was cited in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling of Edwards v. Aguillard. Its mandate that members affirm that the origin story described in Genesis was an established fact was cited by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. as evidence there was a fundamentalist sectarian objective in the field of creation science, and also a fundamentalist sectarian objective in Louisiana&#x27;s 1981 Balanced Treatment Act, a law requiring creation science instruction in the state&#x27;s public schools wherever scientific evolution was taught. The judge ruled, &quot;the intent of the Louisiana Legislature was to promote a particular religious belief&quot; and therefore the teaching of creationism was unconstitutional.

=== Publications ===
The &quot;Creation Research Society Quarterly&quot; has been published since July, 1964. &quot;Creation Matters&quot; containing popular level articles has been published bi-monthly since 1996. CRS has also published an assortment of special papers, monographs and books. Creationist publications have been criticized by scientists, such as Massimo Pigliucci, as &quot;nonsense&quot; in their attempt to blend faith with empirical fact. Glenn R. Morton is an author of more than 20 articles published by CRS in an attempt to &quot;solve scientific problems&quot; of Young-Earth Creationism. Morton later left the creationist movement complaining &quot;The reaction to the pictures, seismic data, the logic disgusted me. They were more interested in what I sounded like than in the data!&quot;.

===Early purges===
The organization&#x27;s early growth allowed Lammerts to purge committee members who were insufficiently active or orthodox. Four committee members were removed: Monsma and Webb for inactivity, Harris for opposing a literal six-day creation, and Warriner after losing his university position and suggesting that the society hire him as a paid promoter. These members were replaced by George F. Howe, Bolton Davidheiser and H. Douglas Dean. Dean and Davidheiser left after only two years, Dean because of his unorthodox views on Evolution, and Davidheiser because he was unable to work with Seventh Day Adventists on the committee. Marsh, an Adventist, left about the same time because he interpreted the society&#x27;s weekend meetings as a religious affront.

By the end of 1964, the society had grown sufficiently that Lammerts decided to purge the society of Old Earth, Gap and Day Age creationists:
In 1967, Lammerts arranged for Morris to succeed him as chairman of the board, in order to ensure continuing fidelity to flood geology. Historian of creationism Ronald L. Numbers states that the Society &quot;acquired a well-deserved reputation for welcoming only committed flood geologists.&quot;

===Laboratory===
The Creation Research Society maintains a working electron microscope laboratory (scanning EM and transmission EM) at the Van Andel Creation Research Center in Chino Valley, AZ, although they will be moving their operation center and research laboratories to the campus of Arizona Christian University, Glendale, AZ. In 2013 Mark Armitage and Kevin Anderson of the CRS published their findings of soft tissues in &quot;Triceratops&quot; horn collected at the Hell Creek Formation in Glendive, MT.

<text>Reformist Party ORA () was a social-democratic political party in Kosovo. The party supported Kosovo independence.

The party was normally referred to as ORA, which in Albanian means the Hour.

ORA was founded as &quot;Civil List ORA&quot; () in the summer of 2004. During the legislative elections on 24 October 2004, the party won 6.2 per cent of the popular vote and 7 out of 120 seats in the Assembly of Kosovo and formed together with the Democratic Party of Kosovo, a strong opposition. However, in the election held in November 2007, it failed to pass the 5% threshold required to win seats in parliament, netting only about 4,2% of votes.

The following were members of Kosovo Albanian parliament from ORA: Nazim Jashari, Teuta Sahatqija, Gazmend Muhaxheri, Genc Gorani, Fatmire Mullhaxha Kollcaku, Ylber Hysa and Veton Surroi. Surroi was a member of the &#x27;Kosovo Unity Team&#x27;, a five-member team of the most senior negotiators that represents the people of Kosovo in the talks for the final status of Kosovo.

The last leader of the party, Teuta Sahatqija, took over the leadership on 2 March 2008.

In February 2010, ORA decided to dissolve as a political entity and join the Democratic League of Kosovo.

<text>The  (; French cinematheque), founded in 1936, is a French non-profit film organization that holds one of the largest archives of film documents and film-related objects in the world. Based in Paris&#x27;s 12th arrondissement, the archive offers daily screenings of films from around the world. It is the second oldest cinematheque in France, after the one in Saint-Étienne, which was founded in 1922.

==History==

The collection emerged from the efforts of Henri Langlois and Lotte H. Eisner in the mid 1930s to collect and screen films. Langlois had acquired one of the largest collections in the world by the beginning of World War II, only to have it nearly wiped out by the German authorities in occupied France, who ordered the destruction of all films made prior to 1937. He and his friends smuggled huge numbers of documents and films out of occupied France to protect them until the end of the war.

After the war, the French government provided a small screening room, staff and subsidy for the collection, which was relocated to the Avenue de Messine. Significant French filmmakers of the 1940s, and 1950s, including Robert Bresson, René Clément, Henri-Georges Clouzot and Jacques Becker frequented screenings at the Cinémathèque. Directors of the New Wave (&quot;la Nouvelle Vague&quot;) school — Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Roger Vadim, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, and Pierre Kast — also received much of their film education by attending the collection&#x27;s screenings.

A meeting in 1945, in Basel between Langlois and Freddy Buache led, via Lausanne&#x27;s first film club, to the founding in 1950 of the Swiss Film Archive.

In 2003, film critic Serge Toubiana became general manager of the Cinémathèque in April, a position he held until December 2015. From September 2003 to June 2007, the producer and director Claude Berri is president of the Cinémathèque, succeeding Jean-Charles Tacchella.

On February 28, 2005, the halls of the Palais de Chaillot and the Grands Boulevards were closed and the new site of the , at 51 rue de Bercy, opened to the public on September 28.

On January 1, 2007, the merged with the BiFi. From June 2007, Claude Berri being ill, it was chaired by Costa-Gavras. In January 2016, critic Frédéric Bonnaud succeeded Serge Toubiana as general manager.

==The events of May 1968==
In June 1963, the Cinémathèque moved to the Palais de Chaillot with funds provided by André Malraux, Minister of Culture, and became subject to government overview. 

In February 1968, under pressure from the Ministry of Finance, Malraux required changes in the management of the Cinémathèque and dismissed Henri Langlois.

A defence committee was formed, uniting notable French filmmakers (Alexandre Astruc, Claude Berri, Robert Bresson, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, Jean Eustache, Georges Franju, Abel Gance, Jean-Luc Godard, Joris Ivens, Pierre Kast, Chris Marker, Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer, Jean Rouch, François Truffaut) together with major actors (Jean-Pierre Léaud, Claude Jade, Jean Marais and Françoise Rosay). Foreign filmmakers such as Charles Chaplin and Stanley Kubrick added their support. Protests were organized.

Confrontations followed between young people, largely students, and what they saw as an authoritarian centre-right government, out of touch with the concerns of the younger generation. These demonstrations were precursors of and merged into the widespread student revolt that erupted from March 1968 onwards, escalating into nationwide unrest in May. Before then, the government had backed down over the Cinémathèque, reinstating Langlois as head in April 1968.

==Location==

After numerous incidentsincluding multiple relocations from one small screening room to another through the 1950s, and a fire in its last premisesthe moved in 2005 to 51, rue de Bercy in the 12th arrondissement of Paris, a postmodern building designed by Frank Gehry, an American architect.

The Bibliothèque du film, which was created in 1992 to show the history of cinema, its production, impact and artistic strength, merged with the .

 operates the Musée de la cinémathèque, formerly known as Musée du cinéma Henri-Langlois, in the new building.

==Tributes==
In celebration of the Centennial of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum and the City Center of Music and Drama in New York co-sponsored &quot;Cinémathèque at the Metropolitan Museum&quot;. The exhibition showed seventy films dating from the medium&#x27;s first seventy-five years on thirty-five consecutive evenings from July 29 to September 3, 1970. The films were selected by Henri Langlois for their significance and contributions to the history of filmmaking, including work from official film industries as well as current and early avant garde directors.

The Cinémathèque&#x27;s closing is noted in François Truffaut&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot;. The Cinémathèque also appears in the Paul Auster 2002 novel &quot;The Book of Illusions&quot; and the 1998 Harvey Danger song &quot;Private Helicopter&quot;.

The Cinémathèque and the events surrounding the dismissal of Langlois in 1968 features heavily in Gilbert Adair&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;The Holy Innocents&quot; also known as &quot;The Dreamers&quot; and in its 2003 film adaptation by Bernardo Bertolucci.

<text>The Soko J-22 Orao () is a Yugoslavian/Serbian twin-engined, subsonic ground-attack and aerial reconnaissance aircraft. It was developed and built in collaboration by SOKO in Yugoslavia and by Avioane Craiova in neighbouring Romania, being known in the latter as the IAR-93 Vultur.

The Orao was designed as either a single-seat main attack version or as a combat-capable twin-seat version, the latter being principally intended for advanced flight- and weapons-training duties. It was developed as a joint Yugoslav-Romanian project, known as YuRom, during the 1970s. Early ambitions to produce a supersonic fighter were scuppered by Britain&#x27;s unwillingness to permit the desired engine to be license-produced in Eastern Europe. Further difficulties in fitting an afterburner to the older Rolls-Royce Viper also hindered development and the performance of early-build aircraft.

First flying during November 1974, the resulting aircraft would equip the air forces of both Romania and Yugoslavia, as well as several of Yugoslavia&#x27;s successor states. On 22 November 1984, the Orao became the first Yugoslav-designed aircraft to exceed Mach 1, albeit achieved while in a shallow dive. During the 1990s, the type saw action during the Yugoslav Wars, typically flying ground-attack missions in and Kosovo. As of July 2019, the Serbian Air Force and Air Defence was the only entity still operating the type.

==Development==
===Origins===
During 1970, the neighbouring nations of Romania and Yugoslavia began discussions on the subject of jointly developing a new ground-attack orientated fighter aircraft. On 20 May 1971, the Romanian and Yugoslavian governments signed an agreement for the formation of &quot;YuRom&quot;, a joint research and development venture between the two nations. According to aviation author John C. Fredriksen, the announcement was a logical extension of political policy, as the two nations&#x27; heads of state, Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Nicolae Ceaușescu, had both historically sought to avoid overreliance upon the Soviet Union, preferring to build ties and cooperative projects with other friendly or neutral nations.

The research programme was headed by Dipl. Dr. Engineer Teodor Zanfirescu of Romania and Colonel Vidoje Knezević of Yugoslavia. The aircraft was intended to be a replacement for both the lightly armed Soko J-21 Jastreb and the Republic F-84 Thunderjet that were then in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army&#x27;s (JNA) arsenal. The requirements called for a lightweight aircraft that featured a relatively simple and rugged structure, that would use locally produced equipment and avionics, capable of operating from austere airstrips (including the ability to operate either from grass or damaged runways), as well as being reliable and easy to maintain.

The resulting design was of a conventional twin-engine monoplane, featuring a high-mounted wing complete with all-swept flight surfaces. According to Fredriksen, the design emphasised simplicity as well as modernity. Due to political sensitivities and a strong desire to avoid one nation upstaging the other, the aircraft featured two separate names; in Romania, it was known as the IAR-93 Vultur while in Yugoslavia it was referred to as the J-22 Orao.

The design team had originally planned to develop a single-engined aircraft capable of supersonic speeds, but the United Kingdom would not authorize the license to produce the British engine that the designers had selected; the rejection was reportedly due to Romania being a member of the Soviet-aligned Warsaw Pact. In its place, the less-powerful Rolls-Royce Viper was chosen as the powerplant, as Soko already possessed experience with license-building this engine. It was originally intended that an afterburner would be developed for the Viper engine, but there were prolonged difficulties with this project. Due to these complications, none of the pre-production aircraft or any early production examples would be equipped with afterburners; these would be largely restricted to conducting reconnaissance missions. During the 1980s, both countries developed slightly different versions of the aircraft to take advantage of the afterburning engines that had since become available.

===Into flight===

During 31 October 1974, the Yugoslav prototype &quot;25002&quot; conducted its first flight from Batajnica Air Base near Belgrade, with Major Vladislav Slavujević at the controls. For political reasons, this flight was timed to deliberately coincide with the first flight of the IAR-93 Vultur prototype. The third aircraft, numbered &quot;25003&quot;, which was a pre-production two-seater version, performed its first flight on 4 July 1977. This aircraft was lost almost one year later, the cause of the accident was attributed to the occurrence of tail flutter.

Construction of further pre-production aircraft was unimpacted by the loss; during 1978, the first batches of pre-production machines were delivered to the Air Force Aircraft Testing Facility in Belgrade. Subsequent serial production was established at a facility outside Mostar, (now in Bosnia and Herzegovina); this facility would be abandoned in early 1992 and heavily damaged during the Yugoslav Wars. The Yugoslav Army reportedly stripped most of the equipment from the Mostar factory and transported as much as possible to the Utva facility in Pancevo, Serbia. However, in spite of this effort, volume production of the J-22 would never be resumed either in Yugoslavia or in its successor states.

During October 1983, the first afterburner-equipped J-22 Orao was flown in Yugoslavia. On 22 November 1984, an Orao No 25101 broke the sound barrier while in a shallow dive at an angle of 25 degrees, piloted by test pilot Marjan Jelen, above Batajnica airport.; this instance made the J-22 the first Yugoslav-designed aircraft to exceed Mach 1. The aircraft is incapable of breaking the sound barrier in level flight, so it is classified as being a subsonic aircraft.

==Design==
The J-22 Orao is a twin-engined combat jet aircraft designed for performing close air support (CAS), ground-attack and tactical reconnaissance missions, it also features a limited air-defense capability. Twin-seat aircraft, designated &quot;NJ-22&quot;, were primarily intended for performing tactical reconnaissance; they were also used to train air crew, being suitable for both the advanced flight and weapons training syllabuses. In terms of its configuration, it featured a shoulder-mounted wing and a pair of 23 mm twin-barrel cannon within the lower forward fuselage. It could be outfitted with a range of armaments, including bombs, rockets, and air-to-surface missiles. The cockpit was furnished with Martin-Baker-built zero/zero ejection seats. The engine-driven starter and generators were supplied by Lucas Industries. Access to the engine for servicing and inspection was eased by the design of the rear fuselage, which was detachable.

The Orao was provisioned with standard communication and navigation equipment, the latter including a Honeywell-built SGP500 twin-gyroscope navigation system. It incorporated a fire control and weapons management system, which used the Thomson-CSF-built VE-120T head-up display (HUD). Additional avionics included GEC-Marconi&#x27;s three-axis stability augmentation system and Rockwell Collins&#x27; VIR-30 (or DME-40) VHF omnidirectional range and instrument landing system. In terms of defensive sensors and systems, it was equipped with an Iskra SO-1 radar warning receiver (RWR) and provision for up to three chaff/flare dispensers, as well as a P10-65-13 passive jammer pod. Further pods could be optionally fitted, including an optical/infrared reconnaissance pod or an optical reconnaissance/jammer pod.

Various upgrade programmes for the J-22 had been proposed during the 1990s; reportedly, such efforts would have been focused upon the aircraft&#x27;s avionics. However, such ambitions were heavily undermined by the dismantling of the Mostar factory during the Yugoslav Wars and the collapse of Romania&#x27;s communist government. During the late 2010s, Serbia launched a major modernisation programme involving both its J-22 and NJ-22 fleets. Unofficially referred to as &quot;Orao 2.0&quot;, this work involved the installation of new navigation and targeting systems, including Safran&#x27;s Sigma 95 inertial navigation system, a mission computer and multi-function displays, into the NJ-22&#x27;s rear cockpit which, along with new weapons, is intended to make the type more effective in ground attack missions. A more comprehensive second phase is to achieve the &quot;complete digitalisation&quot; of the aircraft&#x27;s cockpit.

==Operational history==

The first Yugoslav Air Force unit to receive the J-22 was the 351st reconnaissance aviation squadron of the 82nd Aviation Brigade, Cerklje. Until the 1991 war, . There were also about three squadrons partly equipped with J-22s.

At the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, in Slovenia, J-22s flew over in a show of force, but did not drop any bombs. During 1991, the first offensive action to be conducted by the J-22 occurred when the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) used them to strike targets in Croatia.

As a result of the conflicts of the 1990s, the majority of the former Yugoslav Air Force&#x27;s aircraft were relocated to the Union of Serbia and Montenegro, with smaller numbers ending up under the control of the other new states created by the break-up of Yugoslavia. The JNA left a squadron equipped with nine Oraos in the Bosnian-Serb Republika Srpska, with these aircraft becoming part of the new Republika Srpska Air Force, based at Mahovljani Airport outside Banja Luka. The airworthiness of these aircraft soon deteriorated due to the combination of limited funding and the impact of international embargoes. By June 2003, the Republika Srpska Air Force had a force of seven J-22 Oraos. These aircraft were ultimately inherited by the unified Bosnian Air Force. By 2008, all of Bosnia&#x27;s J-22s had been placed into storage while the nation negotiated with neighbouring Serbia to potentially buy them; reportedly, Serbia was viewed as the only viable customer for the type. 
Several ex-Yugoslav Air Force J-22s were also operated by the Air Force of the Republic of Serbian Krajina following the withdrawal of the JNA from Croatia.

During 1999, Yugoslav J-22s saw limited combat against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), reportedly flying 36 combat missions. One J-22, piloted by Lt. Colonel Života Ðurić, was lost on 25 March 1999 in unclear circumstances, either through malfunction, pilot error or ground fire from KLA units. In addition, eleven aircraft were destroyed on the ground, the majority of these at Ponikve Air Base, when a NATO air strike hit one hangar that reportedly had six J-22 and two Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 aircraft inside.

By 2019, the Serbian Air Force was reportedly operating a fleet comprising ten J-22 and NJ-22 Oraos; in addition to these airworthy examples, the service reportedly also had further airframes in storage, including the IJ and INJ reconnaissance variants. According to aerospace periodical &quot;Flight International&quot;, the Orao&#x27;s service life had been originally anticipated to be around 24 years; based on structural inspections, some airframes are in such good condition that this forecast could be effectively doubled; following an overhaul, individual J-22s can be approved to perform a further 1,000 flight hours.

<text>Alan Stivell (; born Alan Cochevelou on 6 January 1944) is a Breton and Celtic musician and singer, songwriter, recording artist, and master of the Celtic harp. From the early 1970s, he revived global interest in the Celtic (specifically Breton) harp and Celtic music as part of world music. As a bagpiper and bombard player, he modernized traditional Breton music and singing in the Breton language. A precursor of Celtic rock, he is inspired by the union of the Celtic cultures and is a keeper of the Breton culture.

== Musical career ==
=== Early life and career beginnings ===

Alan Stivell was born in the Auvergnat town of Riom. His father, Georges (Jord in Breton) Cochevelou, was a civil servant in the French Ministry of Finance who achieved his dream of recreating a Celtic or Breton harp in the small town of Gourin, Brittany and his mother Fanny-Julienne Dobroushkess was of Lithuanian-Jewish descent. In 1953, Alan began playing the instrument at the age of nine under the tutelage of his father and Denise Megevand, a concert harpist. Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art, and history, as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance, and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at the age of eleven and studied traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in, and won, several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band. Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture, in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany.

Stivell&#x27;s first recording came in 1960 (&quot;Musique gaelique&quot;), a single that was followed by the LP &quot;Telenn Geltiek&quot; in 1964. He already recorded solo harp and harp backing singers in 1959 with &quot;Breiz ma bro&quot; (&quot;Brittany my country&quot;) and a &quot;Mouez Breiz&quot; EP (&quot;Voice of Brittany&quot;) with the female singer Andrea Ar Gouilh. His stage name, Stivell, means &quot;fountain&quot; or &quot;spring&quot; in Breton. The name refers both to the Breton renewal and to his surname Cochevelou (an evolution of &quot;kozh stivelloù&quot;, &quot;the old fountains&quot;).

=== Stivell and the Celtic harp revival ===
With a new bardic harp with bronze strings, Stivell began experimenting with modernized styles of music that became known as Celtic rock. In 1966, Alan Stivell began to perform and record as a singer. The following year, he was signed by Philips Records. This was during the birth of the New Breton and Celtic music movement.

In 1968, after two years of touring and regular appearances at the American Students and Artists Center in Paris, Alan joined the Moody Blues onstage to perform in London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall.

In 1970, Stivell released his first hits, the single &quot;Broceliande&quot; and the album &quot;Reflets&quot;, both on the Philips record label. He became closely associated with the burgeoning Breton roots revival, especially after the release of the purely instrumental 1971 album &quot;Renaissance of the Celtic Harp&quot;, which won one of the most famous awards in France, the prize of the Académie Charles Cros.

The music critic Bruce Elder wrote of the album &quot;Renaissance of the Celtic Harp&quot;: 

On 28 February 1972, Stivell performed a concert in the Olympia theater, a famous music hall in Paris, where Alan and his band played music combining traditional Celtic music with modern sounds (electric guitar, drums, etc.). This concert made Stivell and his music well known throughout France. At this time, Stivell&#x27;s eclectic approach to music was very new and was considered risky, but it soon became popular. Over 1,500,000 records of that concert (&quot;À l&#x27;Olympia&quot;) were sold. Alan Stivell&#x27;s newfound fame propelled him to tour across France, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. He continued recording, and published a collection of Breton poetry in 1976. With his 1980 &quot;Symphonie Celtique&quot;, he mixed for the first time elements of rock, a symphonic orchestra, Celtic instruments and such non-European ethnic elements as Berber vocalist Djourha and sitarist Narendra Bataju.

The folk music revival faded somewhat in the 1980s. Though Alan Stivell still maintained a popular following, he did not reach the heights of popularity that he had in the 1970s. He continued touring in many parts of the world and recording for a loyal fanbase. He also worked with the English musician Kate Bush.

=== Celtic fusions and world music ===

In the 1990s, Stivell recorded with the French singer Laurent Voulzy, Irish traditional performer Shane MacGowan and Senegalese singer Doudou N&#x27;Diaye Rose. The album was &quot;Again&quot;, and it became very popular in France, initiating the beginning of a Celtic new wave. Stivell&#x27;s records in the late 1990s contained more pronounced rock elements, and he performed at a rock festival called Transmusicales in Rennes. He continued working with a variety of musicians, inviting Paddy Moloney (of The Chieftains), Jim Kerr (of Simple Minds), Khaled and Youssou N&#x27;Dour to be in his very international &quot;1 Douar&quot; / &quot;1 Earth&quot; album.

The 1998 French-language hit &quot;La Tribu de Dana&quot; by rap trio Manau, one of the best-selling French singles of all time, featured a very similar musical arrangement to Stivell&#x27;s &quot;Tri Martolod&quot;. Although Stivell sued Manau for the unauthorised sampling, the group claimed that they had modified the original sufficiently, through the addition of lyrics and other changes, to avoid any charges of plagiarism. Stivell is now credited for a part of &quot;La Tribu de Dana&quot;&#x27;s arrangements.

Stivell&#x27;s CD album &quot;Again&quot; in 1993 was the base for a new wave of his popularity, especially in France and Brittany. Other albums received good critical reviews, such as &quot;Brian Boru&quot; or &quot;1 Douar&quot; (&quot;1 Earth&quot;).
In 2002 Stivell released &quot;Au-delà des mots&quot; (&quot;Beyond Words&quot;), his twenty-first LP. The album featured him playing six different harps, specially dedicated to the Celtic Harp Revival&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

In 2004, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Celtic harp revival in Brittany, he wrote a book in collaboration with Jean-Noël Verdier: &quot;Telenn, la harpe bretonne&quot; (&quot;Telenn, the Breton harp&quot;). The same year, the DVD &quot;Parcours&quot; was published by Fox-Pathé.

In 2006, a new CD album called &quot;Explore&quot; came out in France and other countries, distributed through Harmonia Mundi. The album explored fusions of Celtic music with electro-rock, raga and hip-hop with a unique and personal vocal style and an original mix of lyrics in Breton, English and French.
In 2009, the title of his album &quot;Emerald&quot; celebrated his emerald anniversary with his fans (i.e. forty years together) and paid homage to the sea and the Celtic lands (color blue-green, &quot;Glaz&quot; in Breton language). In 2013, a new CD album and DVD called &quot;Olympia 40th Anniversary&quot; came out in France (Universal) as a result of the concert performed at the Olympia mythical music hall on 16 February 2012.

On 2 October 2015, Stivell released a new CD album called &quot;&quot; through &quot;WorldVillage&quot; in France (and other countries), his first one of the 2010s, coinciding with his career&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The album is also available as a &quot;Leclerc limited edition&quot; including 3 bonus tracks (2 alternative mixes and a brand new instrumental) and a 60-page booklet.

== Critical acclaim ==
Music critic Bruce Eder has stated: &quot;[Alan Stivell&#x27;s] harp recordings, with their enveloping lyricism and tightly interwoven patterns of variations, can appeal to more serious listeners of new age music. Stivell&#x27;s main audience, however, lies with fans of Celtic music and culture, and English folk music. Embracing ancient and modern elements, but (apart from his folk-rock work) making no compromises to modern melodic sensibilities, his music captures the mystery and strangeness of Breton, Irish, Welsh, and Scottish landscapes that are both ageless and timeless. It is haunting, mysterious, and beautiful, with no equivalent in modern popular music and few peers in the realm of commercial folk music.&quot;

== Interviews ==
An English translation of Stivell&#x27;s interview for &quot;Le Peuple Breton&quot; by Peter Barry was published in the Scottish political, current affairs and arts review, &quot;Calgacus&quot; in 1975. 

In the 1978 book &quot;Racines interdites&quot; (&quot;Forbidden Roots&quot;), a series of interviews with Stivell covers questions about the Breton language, history and geography, as well as his utopian vision of a world living in meditative harmony with nature. Lyrics for 17 of Stivell&#x27;s songs are reprinted at the back of the book.

== Legacy ==

Alan Stivell has influenced multiple contemporary artists, most notably folk metal band Eluveitie. Their biggest hit &#x27;Inis Mona&#x27; shares a melody with the traditional Tri Martolod. Where it is played on bagpipes, tin whistle and hurdy-gurdy with the addition of harsh vocals, electric guitar, bass guitar and drums.

<text>An engineer&#x27;s degree is an advanced academic degree in engineering which is conferred in Europe, some countries of Asia and Latin America, North Africa and a few institutions in the United States. The degree may require a thesis but always requires a non-abstract project. The duration of study typically ranges from 4 to 5 years, depending on the country and university. Additionally, there may be further requirements for certifications or licenses to practice engineering after graduation.

== North America ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, the engineer&#x27;s degree requires a year of study beyond a master&#x27;s degree or two years from a bachelor&#x27;s degree and often includes a requirement for a research thesis.

At the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School the thesis is required to be &quot;more extensive and complete in problem scope and solution than a master&#x27;s thesis&quot;, although &quot;not necessarily meeting the test of original research and contribution to fundamental knowledge that is applied to PhD dissertations.&quot; At UCLA, the engineer degree is explicitly set at the level of the preliminary PhD examination, i.e. not including the contribution to fundamental knowledge.

The engineer&#x27;s degree was originally a first degree at the same level as a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was empowered by its 1824 charter to award Civil Engineer and Topographical Engineer degrees alongside the Bachelor in Science, and awarded the first Civil Engineer degrees in 1835. Civil Engineer degrees were also awarded by Dartmouth College (from 1845), the University of Michigan (from 1855) and by Yale University (from 1860), while Columbia University awarded Engineer of Mines degrees from 1867. By the early 20th-century engineer&#x27;s degrees were commonly at graduate level – a survey by a committee of the Association of American Universities in 1916 found that this was the case in over two-thirds of the universities surveyed. The committee recommended that engineer&#x27;s degrees be reserved for study beyond master&#x27;s level.

The engineer&#x27;s degree in Mexico is a five year program that takes you beyond the master&#x27;s degree level. It is a terminal degree that certifies you to practice with a license. Internationally, that degree can be considered to be equivalent to a doctorate in engineering. This can be verified through reputable sources such as Collins online translation dictionary, that translates &quot;ingeniero&quot; to doctor for Mexico, it gives the example Ing. Quintanilla ~Dr.Quintanilla. .The international Engineering alliance graduate attributes and professional competencies gives the qualifications and credentials of the professional engineer in all the signatory countries Mexico and Chile included.The Unirank system can be used to determine the level of a five year engineering program from an accredited and reputable school. For example, the engineering program at the university of Quintana roo goes from bachelor&#x27;s to doctoral level according to the degree matrix level.

== Latin America ==
In Latin America, a degree or title of &quot;Ingeniero&quot; is awarded after completing five years of college. This may be translated as &quot;Engineer&quot;, however, its international academic equivalence depends on each country&#x27;s educational system and can be compared to a six-year post-master&#x27;s degree. Its award may imply obtaining a state licence to legally practice in the field or a professional certification outside the academic environment.

=== Chile ===
Chile&#x27;s higher education system differs from the US model, with a six-year &quot;Título Profesional en Ingeniería&quot; granting the title of engineer. This professional title encompasses a bachelor&#x27;s degree in science, allowing graduates to enter a master&#x27;s or doctoral program. Alternatively, graduates can proceed directly to a doctorate after the six-year program. Therefore, a Chilean professional title in engineering is academically equivalent to a six-year post-master&#x27;s degree.

== Europe ==
Prior to the Bologna Process, In most countries of continental Europe, universities specializing in technical fields traditionally awarded their students an engineer&#x27;s degree after five years. This degree was typically the first university-awarded degree after finishing secondary education and completing it granted qualifications to further pursue a doctorate.

Following German custom in higher education, the engineer&#x27;s degree was called the &quot;Diplom&quot;. In addition to Germany itself, this system was common in states like Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

Following the introduction of the Bologna process, universities divide higher-education studies in three cycles, corresponding to a three to four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree, a one to two-year master&#x27;s degree and a doctoral degree. Accordingly, engineering studies are now divided in two parts: first, the bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;baccalaureus&quot;, three to four years) and the second optional part (one to two years), after which either the traditional engineer&#x27;s degree or a master&#x27;s degree (e.g. MEng or MSc) is awarded. These can often, however, still be combined into a single &#x27;integrated&#x27; degree programme in many countries, normally lasting five or six years (although only four years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland). But in the UK when one considers the whole formation of a fully qualified Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer it is a minimum of eight years. Countries have varied in the implementation of the Bologna process, meaning the combination of first (bachelor&#x27;s) and second (master&#x27;s) cycles, even when taken as a single degree, can last from four to six years, although many countries have set five years as the minimum.

Most traditional universities continue to have a primary academic degree program, for example, a five-year &quot;Civilingenjör&quot; in Sweden, that is distinct from the 3+2 scheme that awards the bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees but a student who has done both at a Swedish technical university will in most cases also fulfill the requirements for the &quot;civilingenjör&quot; degree.

In France, an important part of engineering is taught in &quot;écoles d’ingénieurs&quot;, which are part of the French &quot;grandes écoles&quot; system. Since the Bologna Process, the &quot;Diplôme d’ingénieur&quot; is officially considered to be at the level of a master&#x27;s degree, equivalent to an integrated bachelor&#x27;s and 
master&#x27;s degree.

In German, the traditional engineer&#x27;s degree is called Diplom-Ingenieur (Dipl. -Ing.; in Austria DI is also used). This degree is generally equivalent to a combined bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s degree, which is not to be confused with the old Magister degree. 

Europe has the international professional engineering qualification and title of European Engineer (EUR ING) which is obtained through peer review after seven years of education, training and professional experience.

=== Belarus and Ukraine ===

In Belarus and Ukraine, the degree is &quot;спеціаліст інженер&quot; (specialist engineer), a first degree after five years of education.

=== Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia (former Yugoslavia) ===
In Croatia, the old system included the engineer&#x27;s degrees &quot;diplomirani inženjer&quot; (abbr. &quot;dipl.ing.&quot;) which was awarded by university faculties and a lower ranked engineer&#x27;s degree &quot;inženjer&quot; (abbr. &quot;ing.&quot;) which was awarded by polytechnics, in a similar vein to the situation in the Netherlands. The old &quot;dipl.ing.&quot; degree could later be upgraded to a &quot;magistar&quot; (abbr. &quot;mr.&quot;, Magister degree) and then a &quot;doktor&quot; (abbr. &quot;dr.&quot;, Doctorate). The situation was the same in other countries previously part of Yugoslavia. In Serbian, the abbreviation is &quot;dipl.inž&quot;. Serbian titles of &quot;magistar&quot; (abbr. &quot;mr&quot;, Magister degree) and &quot;doktor&quot; (abbr. &quot;dr&quot;, Doctorate) in abbreviated versions are used without full stop as a punctuation mark at the end.

=== Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia ===

In the western Slavic-speaking countries, the engineer&#x27;s degree is called &quot;inżynier&quot; (Polish), &quot;inžinier&quot; (Slovak) or &quot;inženýr&quot; (Czech) and the abbreviation is &quot;inż.&quot; in Poland and &quot;Ing.&quot; in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which may be written before the person&#x27;s name.

In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the degree of &quot;Ing.&quot; is given for complete university studies in technical (like engineering), economic or agricultural fields. In one of these cases it can be equivalent to a &quot;Master of Science in Engineering&quot;.

In Poland, the degree of &quot;inżynier&quot; is available after 3.5 or 4 years of studies (like the &quot;licencjat&quot; in non-engineering science) after a final thesis is completed. A &quot;magister inżynier&quot; (abbreviated &quot;mgr inż.&quot;) refers to a &quot;Master of Science in Engineering&quot;, after completing five years of study and a written thesis. Originally there were &quot;inżynier&quot; studies that lasted for four years and afterward one could obtain the &quot;magister&quot; title in two years of studies—the total of six years resulted in two degrees, &quot;magister&quot; and &quot;inżynier&quot;. In the early 1960s a new track of studies was developed to speed up education and the &quot;magister inżynier&quot; five-year track was created. Whichever way one obtained the education the &quot;magister inżynier&quot; (mgr inż. before the name) was the equivalent degree with &quot;inżynier&quot; designating the professional level and &quot;magister&quot; designating the academic level.
After the Bologna process the first level is &quot;inżynier,&quot; obtainable after nominally three years of studies (although some are longer) with the same professional privileges as before and &quot;masters&quot; after one or two years gives the same academic and professional designation as before. But the ultimate shortening of the period of studies resulted in some professional groups (e.g. architects) demanding that &quot;magister inżynier&quot; be made a basis for professional rights.

=== Finland ===

In Finnish, the engineer&#x27;s degree is called &quot;diplomi-insinööri&quot; and abbreviated &quot;dipl.ins.&quot;, &quot;DI&quot; or &quot;M.Sc.(Tech.)&quot;. It is possible to obtain after five years of studying or even faster, but the average is around six years. Under the Bologna process, this is split into two parts, the first being one where the students can get the intermediate &quot;tekniikan kandidaatti&quot; (&quot;B.Sc.(Tech.)&quot;) degree.

The degree of &quot;insinööri (AMK)&quot; is a bachelor&#x27;s degree from a Finnish University of Applied Sciences (&quot;ammattikorkeakoulu&quot;), similar to a German &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;, but it is not interchangeable with the academic &quot;tekniikan kandidaatti&quot;.

Due to the Bologna process, a new master&#x27;s degree called &quot;Insinööri (ylempi AMK)&quot; or Master of Engineering has been introduced. It carries a requirement of two years of work experience after the degree of &quot;insinööri (AMK)&quot; and further studies.

=== France ===

In France, the main way to become an engineer is :

* Have a &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot;, delivered by the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; (or some technical universities), or have a Master&#x27;s degree in Engineering from a University.

The &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot; is a postgraduate degree in engineering usually awarded by the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; in engineering. It is generally obtained after five to seven years of studies after the &quot;baccalauréat&quot;. It is considered more prestigious by recruiters than a Master&#x27;s degree due to the electricity of the program. 

In France, the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot; grants the title of &quot;ingénieur diplômé,&quot; a distinction from the less regulated term &quot;ingénieur.&quot; This diploma is equivalent to a combined Bachelor and Master of Science in Engineering, recognized in the US and EU. Graduates can pursue double degrees, doctoral studies, and careers in academia or industrial research. In France, any institution issuing the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot; must be accredited by the state. In France particularly, the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot; must be accredited by the &quot;Commission des Titres d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot;. Note that the best institutions are usually part of the &quot;Conférence des Grandes écoles&quot;.

France is unusual in that it is mainly the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; in engineering that are accredited and are certified to issue the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot;, which is differentiated from bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in engineering issued by public universities (&quot;universités&quot;). Universities in France are comprehensive institutions composed of several faculties covering various fields (natural sciences, engineering, law, economics, medicine, humanities, etc.) with a large student body. On the other hand, &quot;grandes écoles&quot; in engineering are much smaller and recruit their students through a more selective process (typically a few hundred students per year per institution, and a few thousand students per year country-wide).

=== Germany and Austria ===

In German, the traditional engineer&#x27;s degree is called &quot;Diplom-Ingenieur&quot; (&quot;Dipl.-Ing.&quot;; in Austria &quot;DI&quot; is also used). This degree is generally equivalent to a Master&#x27;s degree, which is not to be confused with the old &quot;Magister&quot; degree. The German &quot;universities of applied sciences&quot; (&quot;Fachhochschule&quot;) awarded the traditional engineering degree &quot;Diplom-Ingenieur (FH)&quot; (&quot;Dipl.-Ing. (FH)&quot;). This superseded &quot;Ing. (Grad)&quot;, which was previously awarded by universities of applied sciences and engineering schools after three years of study. A requirement for the degree was to write a &quot;Diplom&quot; thesis. Most programs that used to lead to a &quot;Dipl.-Ing.&quot; degree lead to master&#x27;s degrees today, as the &quot;Diplom-Ingenieur&quot; as an academic title is phased out because of the Bologna Process. However, some universities continue to hand out so-called equivalence certificates that certify the equivalence of a &quot;Dipl.-Ing.&quot; with the newly introduced MSc degrees. Since 2009, most universities in Germany offer bachelor&#x27;s degree programmes (BSc, BEng and others) and master&#x27;s programmes that lead to the academic degrees such as Master of Science, Master of Engineering, Master of Business Administration and others.

In Austria there also exists the &quot;Ingenieur&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;Ing.&quot;). This is not an academic degree as it is given to graduates of &quot;HTLs&quot; (&quot;Höhere Technische Lehranstalt&quot;), secondary schools with technical focus. The Austrian engineers&#x27; law (&quot;Ingenieurgesetz&quot; 2017) specifies the criteria for obtaining the title: graduation from a technical high school (HTL), verifiable practical experience of three years, and an oral examination with a certified committee to prove advanced skills and knowledge in their field. Since 2017, &quot;Ingenieur&quot; titles obtained under these criteria are included in the National Qualifications Framework on level 6, the same level as that of the bachelor&#x27;s degree. However, the &quot;Ingenieur&quot; does not entitle holders to direct admission to university master&#x27;s degree programmes.

=== Greece ===
In Greece, the title of &quot;Engineer&quot; is awarded by higher education institutions. There are two types of engineer. The title &quot;Diplomate Engineer&quot; (Diplomate in Greek: Διπλωματούχος; Kάτοχος ενός Διπλώματος/Δίπλωμα/Diploma; Diploma holder) is awarded after completion of a five-year undergraduate engineering degree (diploma) programme at a polytechnic university. These degrees are 300 ECTS credits, leading to a qualification at ISCED level 7, equivalent to an integrated master&#x27;s degree.

The title of &quot;Graduate Engineer&quot;(Greek translation: &quot;Πτυχιούχος Μηχανικός&quot;, English explanation: &quot;Bachelor of Engineering Degree Holder&quot;), is awarded after completion of a four-year (three and a half years from 1983 to 1995) undergraduate engineering degree programme at a technological educational institute (TEI). These are 240 (previously 210, 1983–1995) ECTS credits leading to an award at ISCED level 6, equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. TEIs existed from 1983 to 2019; they were reformed between 2013 and 2019 and their departments incorporated into existing higher education institutions.

=== Italy ===
In Italy there was the engineering degree obtained after five years university and then one had to pass a state examination to be a professional engineer by law. Completion of an engineering degree has historically demanded much effort, so that, on average, the five-year course took eight years to finish and less than 5% of the students graduated within five years.

Later, until 2001, there were two degrees: a three-year &quot;diploma in ingegneria&quot; (BEng level, title abbrev. &quot;dipl. ing.&quot;) and a five-year &quot;laurea in ingegneria&quot; (MEng level, title abbrev. &quot;ing.&quot;). However, the two degree courses were not in sequence but one as an alternative to the other (most students attended the traditional five-year degree). Since 2001 reform, the bachelor&#x27;s level is called &quot;laurea&quot; (abbrev. &quot;L&quot;) and master&#x27;s degree level was called &quot;laurea specialistica&quot; (abbrev. &quot;LS&quot;) and is now called &quot;laurea magistrale&quot; (abbrev. &quot;LM&quot;). Accordingly, today after three years of engineering studies, the degree called &quot;laurea in ingegneria&quot; (BEng level) and the title of &quot;dottore in Ingegneria&quot; (abbrev. &quot;dott.&quot;) can be obtained. After two additional years of engineering studies, the degree called &quot;laurea magistrale in ingegneria&quot; (MEng level) and the title of &quot;dottore magistrale in Ingegneria&quot; (abbrev. &quot;dott.&quot;) can be obtained. After a &quot;state exam&quot; one becomes &quot;Ingegnere&quot; (abbrev. Ing). In Italy the state accreditation system, degrees and titles are regulated by state law.

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, somebody holding an engineer&#x27;s degree is an &quot;ingenieur&quot;. There are two types of engineers with different abbreviations:
* &quot;ir.&quot; is obtained by university graduates (&quot;Wetenschappelijk onderwijs&quot; or WO). It is at academic level and the highest engineer qualification. - five years study (3 B.Sc. + 2 M.Sc.), or 6 years for engineers that graduated prior to the Bologna agreement.
* &quot;ing.&quot; is obtained by graduates from polytechnics (&quot;hoger beroeps onderwijs&quot; or HBO). - four years study (4 B.Eng. or B.ASc.)

Names are traditionally prefixed with the &quot;ir.&quot; or &quot;ing.&quot; titles. Use of these titles is regulated and protected by Dutch law. Under the Bologna agreement, the titles are increasingly interchanged with the English-language degrees (B.Sc. for ing., M.Sc. for ir.).

Completion of Dutch engineering qualifications has historically demanded much effort and talent. On average the four-year course takes 4.5 years to finish. 

=== Romania and Moldova ===

Romania and Moldova followed the French system. One needs a baccalaureate diploma to be accepted at the university. The engineering degree was called &quot;Diploma de inginer&quot; and the graduate was called a &quot;Inginer diplomat&quot;. These five years of study are equivalent to a Bologna Master (M.Sc/M.Eng/MCA). The five-year course concludes with a comprehensive set of specialising exams (&quot;examen de diploma&quot;). Marks nine and 10 are considered exceptional. Some universities had called &quot;Diploma de Sub-inginer&quot; which was a three-year course equivalent with a college degree. Following the Bologna process, the graduates obtain the &quot;Inginer licentiat&quot; degree, after following a four-year program. In this case the &quot;Inginer Master&quot; degree is obtained after an additional one- or two-year graduate program.

=== Russia ===

As of 2012 in Russia, following degrees correspond to the &quot;engineer&#x27;s degree&quot; in the sense of this article:
* Инженер - &quot;engineer&quot;, which was formerly awarded after four, five, six years of study, may also contain clarification on the nature of engineering field, such as &quot;mining engineer&quot; or &quot;systems engineer&quot;.
* Инженер по специальности - &quot;engineer at specialty&quot; (where specialty&#x27;s name is mentioned), currently awarded after five or six years of study, may also contain clarification on the nature of engineering field, such as &quot;engineer-ecologist at specialty Rational usage of natural resources and protection of the environment&quot;
* Инженер-исследователь по специальности - &quot;engineer-researcher at specialty&quot; (where specialty&#x27;s name is mentioned), was formerly awarded after seven years of study
* Бакалавр по направлению - &quot;bachelor at area&quot; (where area&#x27;s name is mentioned), currently awarded after four years of study and &quot;area&quot; is an engineering area, corresponding to one or more of former &quot;specialties&quot;
* Магистр по направлению - &quot;magister (master) at area&quot; (where area&#x27;s name is mentioned), currently awarded after two years of study to those already having any higher-education degree and &quot;area&quot; is an engineering area, corresponding to one or more of former &quot;specialties&quot;
Anything but &quot;bachelor&quot; is considered &quot;second-level&quot; higher education and gives access to postgraduate education for &quot;candidate of sciences&quot; degree, &quot;bachelor&quot; is considered &quot;first-level&quot; higher education degree and gives access to study for master&#x27;s (magister) degree.

Post-graduate scientific degrees in engineering areas include кандидат технических наук - &quot;candidate of technical sciences&quot; and доктор технических наук - &quot;doctor of technical sciences&quot;. Sometimes in English translations &quot;...of technical sciences&quot; is exchanged for &quot;...of engineering&quot;.

=== Spain ===
The situation in Spain is very similar to France but without the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; and Germany-UK in relation to the Technical Engineering Degrees. Long cycle Engineer&#x27;s degrees (Ingenieros) traditionally used to be (at least nominally) six-year programs but the tendency since the mid-1990s has been to reduce them to five years. The last step to get the degree is the &quot;Proyecto de Fin de Carrera&quot; (Degree Project), which involves a combination of application development and some research work. Students submit a dissertation that they have to defend. The Spanish official name for the degree is &quot;Ingeniero&quot; (Engineer) or other degree called &quot;Ingeniero Técnico&quot; (Technical Engineer), which is a three to four years degree (involving also a Final Degree Project) and is equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering, the Technical Engineer in Spain has full competencies and legal authority in their field; however, certain engineering professions require by law a master&#x27;s degree in their respective field, a degree called &quot;master habilitante&quot; or &quot;habilitating master&#x27;s degree&quot;. A distinctive characteristic of Spanish engineering degrees is that the average duration of studies up to graduation is about 40 percent above the nominal duration and that the drop-out rate is considerable due to stricter examination standards.

=== United Kingdom ===
Durham University established the first school of engineering in the UK in 1837, which awarded the academic rank of Civil Engineer between 1840 and 1852. After the school was re-established in Newcastle, the title of Civil Engineer was again awarded between 1887 and 1894. The supplemental charter of Queen&#x27;s College, Birmingham in 1852 also specified that it could award the academic rank of Civil Engineer. The Birmingham school of engineering was wound down when the institution was reconstituted in 1867.

== Africa ==
Most countries follow the French system of higher education, the engineer&#x27;s degree was called the &quot;Diplôme d’ingénieur&quot;. 

Similar to France, an important part of engineering is taught in &quot;écoles d’ingénieurs&quot;, which are part of the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; system. Since the Bologna Process, the &quot;Diplôme d’ingénieur&quot; is officially considered to be at the level of a master&#x27;s degree, equivalent to an integrated bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree.

=== Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria ===

In Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria, the main way to become an engineer is to have a &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot;, delivered by the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; (or some technical universities), or have a master&#x27;s degree in engineering from a University.

The &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot; is a postgraduate degree in engineering usually awarded by the &quot;grandes écoles&quot; in engineering. It is generally obtained after five to seven years of studies after the &quot;baccalauréat&quot;. It is considered more prestigious by recruiters than a master&#x27;s degree due to the electricity of the program.

Each holder of the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot; is conferred the title of &quot;ingénieur diplômé&quot; (graduate engineer). This is distinguished from the term &quot;ingénieur&quot; (engineer) which is less regulated. The &quot;diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur&quot; is recognized as equivalent to a combined Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in engineering in the United States and in the countries of the European Union (also in France).

Most &quot;grandes écoles&quot; allow their students to join a double degree with a university (in France or abroad). Furthermore, &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot; graduates can pursue a selective PhD after their engineering studies and later join academia or an industrial research and development department.

In Morocco and Tunisia, any institution issuing the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot; must be accredited by the state. The best institutions are usually part of the &quot;Conférence des Grandes écoles&quot;.

=== Egypt and South Africa ===
Egypt and South Africa do not follow the French education system and offer the traditional bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programs, which can be taken separately. The &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot; is not offered.

== Asia ==

=== Indonesia ===
Prior to 2014, Indonesia still uses the Dutch degree classification inherited from colonial administration. The term &quot;engineer&quot; (Indonesian: &quot;insinyur&quot; from Dutch: &quot;ingenieur&quot;) was used as an academic title, for a bachelor degree in engineering who graduated from a university in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and sometimes used in the field of applied science. However, after the academic title of Bachelor of Engineering (&quot;Sarjana Teknik&quot;) (S.T.) was conformed, the title of Engineer (Ir.) was no longer used by universities as an academic title but as a professional title stipulated in the Regulation of the Ministry of Education and Culture Number 154 of 2014 concerning Graduate Degree in Science and Technology.

The status of Engineer (Ir.) was thus raised to a professional title similar to the professional titles of Medical Doctor (dr.), Dentist (drg.), Midwife (Bd.), Nurse (Ns.), Pharmacist (Apt.), Accountant (Akt.), and Psychologist (Psi.). In other words, currently not all university graduates who hold an S.T. degree immediately have the right to be called engineers.

Names are traditionally prefixed with the &quot;ir.&quot; or &quot;ing.&quot; titles or suffixed with the S.T. degree. Use of these titles is regulated and protected by Indonesian law.

=== Vietnam ===
The Engineer&#x27;s Degree in Vietnam is awarded to students who complete a specialized engineering program at the university level. The duration of these programs can vary depending on the specific program and institution. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) of Vietnam governs the naming and recognition of degrees. Although Vietnam is moving towards alignment with international standards, there might be some variations in nomenclature. The actual degree certificate may state &quot;The Degree of Engineer&quot; followed by the specific field of study. As of December 30, 2019, the Vietnamese National Qualifications Framework places the Engineer&#x27;s degree, Doctoral degree, and Architecture degree at Level 7, making them equivalent to a Master&#x27;s degree within this framework. However, this does not necessarily mean that the Engineer&#x27;s degree is recognized as equivalent to a Master&#x27;s degree in all other countries.

<doc id="1260584" wikidata="Q6907628" url="?curid=1260584" title="Moon tree">
<text>Moon trees are trees grown from seeds taken into orbit around the Moon, initially by Apollo 14 in 1971, and later by Artemis I in 2022. The idea was first proposed by Edward P. Cliff, then the Chief of the United States Forest Service, who convinced Stuart Roosa, the Command Module Pilot on the Apollo 14 mission, to bring a small canister containing about 500 seeds aboard the module in 1971. Seeds for the experiment were chosen from five species of tree: loblolly pine, sycamore, sweetgum, redwood, and Douglas fir. In 2022, NASA announced it would be reviving the Moon tree program by carrying 1,000 seeds aboard Artemis I.

== History ==
After the flight, the seeds were sent to the southern Forest Service station in Gulfport, Mississippi, and to the western station in Placerville, California, with the intent to germinate them. Nearly all the seeds germinated successfully, and after a few years, the Forest Service had about 420 seedlings. Some of these were planted alongside their Earth-bound counterparts, which were specifically set aside as controls. After more than 40 years, there was no discernible difference between the two classes of trees. Most of the Moon trees were given away in 1975 and 1976 to state forestry organizations, in order to be planted as part of the nation&#x27;s bicentennial celebration. Since the trees were all of southern or western species, not all states received trees. A Loblolly Pine was planted at the White House, and trees were planted in Brazil, Switzerland, and presented to Emperor Hirohito, among others.The locations of many of the trees that were planted from these seeds were largely unknown for decades. In 1996, a third-grade teacher, Joan Goble, and her students found a tree in their local area with a plaque identifying it as a Moon tree. Goble sent an email to NASA, and reached employee Dave Williams. Williams was unaware of the trees&#x27; existence, as were most of his colleagues at NASA. Upon doing some research, Williams found some old newspaper clippings that described the initial actions taken by Roosa to bring these seeds to space and home to be planted.
Williams posted a page on NASA&#x27;s official website asking for public help to find the trees. The page also contained a table listing the locations and species of known Moon trees. Williams began to hear from people around the United States who had seen trees with plaques identifying them as Moon trees. Williams began to manage a database listing details about such trees, including their location and species. In 2011, an article in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine described the effort, and provided Williams&#x27; email address, encouraging anyone to write who might have data on existing Moon trees. As of 2022, efforts were continuing to identify and locate existing trees; the NASA page remains active.

In March 2021, the Royal Astronomical Society and the UK Space Agency asked for the help of the public to identify up to 15 Moon Trees that may be growing in the United Kingdom. As of April 2021, none of the trees that supposedly came to the UK have been identified.

===Current efforts===
The Moon Tree Foundation is an organization run by Roosa&#x27;s daughter, Rosemary, which seeks to plant Moon trees in regions around the world. The foundation sponsors and hosts ceremonies to plant new trees, with seeds produced by the original generation of trees that grew from the seeds carried by Roosa in 1971.

<doc id="1260585" wikidata="Q3276037" url="?curid=1260585" title="Color commentator">
<text>A color commentator or expert commentator is a sports commentator who assists the main (play-by-play) commentator, typically by filling in when play is not in progress. The person may also be referred to as a summariser (outside North America) or analyst (a term used throughout the English-speaking world). The color analyst and main commentator will often exchange comments freely throughout the broadcast, when the main commentator is not describing the action. The color commentator provides expert analysis and background information, such as statistics, strategy, and injury reports on the teams and athletes, and occasionally anecdotes or light humor. Color commentators are often former athletes or coaches of the sport being broadcast.

The term &quot;&quot; refers to levity and insight provided by a secondary announcer. A sports color commentator customarily works alongside the play-by-play broadcaster.

==United States and Canada==
Commentary teams typically feature one professional commentator describing the passage of play, and another, usually a former player or coach, providing supplementary input as the game progresses. Color commentators usually restrict their input to times that the ball or the puck is out of play, or there is no significant action on the field or the court. They usually defer to the main commentator when a shot on goal or another significant event occurs. That sometimes results in them being talked over or cut short by the primary commentator. Former players and managers also appear as pundits and carry out a similar role to that of the co-commentator during the pre-game show before a given contest and the post-game show after it.

In American motorsports coverage, there may be as many as two color commentators in the booth for a given broadcast. 
In the 2010s, some sports broadcasters began to employ rules analysts, a contributor—typically a former referee—who provides analysis and opinions of calls made by referees officiating the game. The practice was first popularized in the NFL, with Fox hiring former officials Mike Pereira and Dean Blandino. The practice has since been extended to other sports, with officials such as Steve Javie (basketball), Dave Jackson (hockey), and Joe Machnik (soccer) having taken on similar roles for ESPN/ABC and Fox respectively. CBS similarly hired Gene Steratore in 2018; consistent with his background, he has been employed for both NFL and college basketball coverage.

==United Kingdom==
The term &quot;color commentator&quot; is largely unknown outside American sports such as football. In the United Kingdom, the equivalent role is usually called &quot;summariser&quot; but other terms used are &quot;analyst&quot;, &quot;pundit&quot; or simply &quot;co-commentator&quot;. Cricket coverage on ESPNcricinfo uses similar terminology.

==Australia and New Zealand ==

<text>Christian Theological Seminary is an ecumenical seminary related to the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and located in Indianapolis, Indiana. It provides five degree-level education courses, three dual-degree programs, a Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) program, and a Ph.D. in African American Preaching and Sacred Rhetoric. As of 2019, the seminary had an enrollment of 139 students.

==History==
CTS was founded by abolitionists as part of North Western Christian University in 1855. North Western Christian University became Butler University in 1877; in 1958, CTS became a freestanding institution. In 2017, Butler University purchased about of the CTS campus; Butler renamed its new land Butler South. CTS retained approximately on the west end of the parcel and holds a 100-year lease to space on the campus, including parts of the seminary, chapel, library, and counseling building. CTS continues as a freestanding institution on the Butler campus.

==Academics==
Christian Theological Seminary offers nine graduate degree programs and eight certificate programs, including: Masters of Divinity (MDiv), Masters of Theological Studies (MTS), Doctor of Ministry (DMin), Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in African American Preaching and Sacred Rhetoric, Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling (MACMHC), Master of Arts in Marriage + Family Therapy (MAMFT), and three joint degree programs. 

==Campus==
Christian Theological Seminary is located on the campus of Butler University in Indianapolis within walking distance of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. The main building, a mid-century &quot;pre-Gothic&quot; building designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes that opened in 1966 and two historic mansions on the campus were purchased by Butler University in 2018. The CTS campus is housed in the North and West wings of the main seminary building, and the CTS Counseling Center is housed in the largest of the two historic mansions on the Southwest side of the campus. CTS is also home to the Lilly Endowment Clergy Renewal Program and the Faith &amp; Action Project.

In 2021, a six-person panel of American Institute of Architects (AIA) Indianapolis members identified the seminary&#x27;s Sweeney Chapel (1966) among the ten most &quot;architecturally significant&quot; buildings completed in the city since World War II.

==Library==
The Christian Theological Seminary Library contains more than 210,000 volumes as well as over 1,300 current periodical subscriptions. Microfilms, audio-visuals, manuscripts, and special materials on the Restoration movement are available to scholars. The CTS Library is also home to the Congregational Resource Center, a resource library that contains videos, curriculum, denominational resources, and Vacation Bible School resources that are available on loan to pastors and leaders of local congregations. The CTS library also houses the Writing Center.

<text>Guillermo Cabrera Infante (; Gibara, 22 April 1929 – 21 February 2005) was a Cuban novelist, essayist, translator, screenwriter, and critic; in the 1950s he used the pseudonym G. Caín, and used Guillermo Cain for the screenplay of the cult classic film &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (1971).

A one-time supporter of the politics of Fidel Castro, Cabrera Infante went into exile to London in 1965. He is best known for the novel &quot;Tres tristes tigres&quot; (literally: &quot;three sad tigers&quot;, published in English as &quot;Three Trapped Tigers&quot;), which has been compared favorably to James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

== Biography ==
Born in Gibara in Cuba&#x27;s former Oriente Province (now part of Holguín Province), in 1941 he moved with his parents, to Havana, which would be the setting of nearly all of his writings other than his critical works. His parents were founding members of the Cuban Communist Party.

Originally he intended to become a physician, but abandoned that in favor of writing and his passion for the cinema. Starting in 1950, he studied journalism at the University of Havana. Under the Batista regime he was arrested and fined in 1952 for publishing a short story which included several English-language profanities. His opposition to Batista later cost him a short jail term.

He married for the first time in 1953. From 1954 to 1960 he wrote film reviews for the magazine &quot;Carteles&quot;, using the pseudonym G. Caín; he became its editor in chief, still pseudonymously, in 1957. With the triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959 he was named director of the Instituto del Cine. He was also head of the literary magazine &quot;Lunes de Revolución&quot;, a supplement to the Communist newspaper &quot;Revolución&quot;; however, this supplement was prohibited in 1961 by Fidel Castro.

He divorced in 1961 and in the same year married his second wife, Miriam Gomez, an actress. Having fallen somewhat out of favor with the Castro regime (the government&#x27;s ban on a documentary on Havana nightlife made by his brother led to his being forbidden to publish in Cuba), he served from 1962 to 1965 in Brussels, Belgium, as a cultural attaché. During this time, his sentiments turned against the Castro regime; after returning to Cuba for his mother&#x27;s funeral in 1965, he went into exile, first in Madrid, then in London.

In 1966 he published &quot;Tres tristes tigres&quot;, a highly experimental, Joycean novel, playful and rich in literary allusions, which intended to do for Cuban Spanish what Mark Twain had done for American English, recording the great variety of its colloquial variations. It won the 1964 Premio Biblioteca Breve for best unpublished novel.

He co-wrote the script for Richard C. Sarafian&#x27;s 1971 cult film &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; under the pseudonym Guillermo Caín.

Although he is considered a part of the famed Latin American Boom generation of writers that includes his contemporary Gabriel García Márquez, he disdained the label. Ever an iconoclast, he even rejected the label &quot;novel&quot; to describe his most acclaimed works, such as &quot;Tres tristes tigres&quot; and &quot;La Habana para un infante difunto.&quot; He was influential to Puerto Rican and Cuban writers such as Luis Rafael Sánchez (&quot;La guaracha del Macho Camacho&quot;) and Fernando Velázquez Medina (&quot;Última rumba en La Habana&quot;).

In 1997 he received the Premio Cervantes, presented to him by King Juan Carlos of Spain. He died on February 21, 2005, in London, of sepsis. He had two daughters from his first marriage.

<text>Squirrel fishing is the &quot;sporting&quot; practice of &quot;catching&quot; squirrels and attempting to lift them into the air using a nut (such as a peanut) tied to a string or fishing line and optionally some kind of fishing pole.

There has been some debate over where modern squirrel fishing originated. Squirrel fishing occurred at least as early as 1889 in the United States.
The practice was popularized either by Nikolas Gloy and Yasuhiro Endo at the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University or by the Berkeley Squirrel Fisher&#x27;s Club (BSF), an official student group at the University of California, Berkeley that has been featured in the campus newspaper. , Ohio State University also had a squirrel fishing club. Michigan State University joined in 2015.

<doc id="1260600" wikidata="Q5420357" url="?curid=1260600" title="Existential humanism">
<text>Existential humanism is humanism that validates the human subject as struggling for self-knowledge and self-responsibility.

==Concepts==

Søren Kierkegaard suggested that the best use of our capacity for making choices is to freely choose to live a fully human life, rooted in a personal search for values, rather than an external code.

Jean-Paul Sartre said &quot;existentialism is a humanism&quot; because it expresses the power of human beings to make freely-willed choices, independent of the influence of religion or society. Unlike traditional humanisms, however, Sartre disavowed any reliance on an essential nature of man – on deriving values from the facts of human nature – but rather saw human value as self-created through undertaking projects in the world: experiments in living.
Albert Camus, in his book &quot;The Plague&quot;, suggests that some of us may choose to be heroic, even knowing that it will bring us neither reward nor salvation; and Simone de Beauvoir, in her book &quot;The Ethics of Ambiguity&quot;, argues that embracing our own personal freedom requires us to fight for the freedoms of all humanity.

==Criticism==

Martin Heidegger attacked Sartre&#x27;s concept of existential humanism in his &quot;Letter on Humanism&quot; of 1946, accusing Sartre of elevating Reason above Being.

Michel Foucault followed Heidegger in attacking Sartre&#x27;s humanism as a kind of theology of man, though in his emphasis on the self-creation of the human being he has in fact been seen as very close to Sartre&#x27;s existential humanism.

<doc id="1260606" wikidata="Q1186316" url="?curid=1260606" title="Democratic Party of Kosovo">
<text>The Democratic Party of Kosovo (, PDK) is one of the largest political parties in Kosovo. It was originally a social-democratic party coming out of the demilitarised Kosovo Liberation Army after the Kosovo War, with most of the leadership coming from Albanian nationalists and former members of the People&#x27;s Movement of Kosovo. However, during its congress in January 2013, it positioned itself as a centre-right party and is considered to be a conservative party.
The Democratic Party of Kosovo since July 2021 is headed by Memli Krasniqi, the former Vice –President of the Assembly of Kosovo, Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports.

== History ==
The party was founded on 10 October 1999 from the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army as the Party for the Democratic Progress of Kosovo (&quot;Partia për Progres Demokratik e Kosovës&quot;), but was renamed on 21 May 2000. The party has increased in size and regional scope, initially winning the elections of 2007 and winning most of the regional elections in the municipal elections of 2009. PDK renewed its governing mandate after winning the elections of 2010. Members of the Party for the Democratic Progress of Kosovo (which was later called the Democratic Party of Kosovo) were blacklisted by the US under then-President George W. Bush in 2001.

In the 2004 legislative elections, the party won 28.9% of the popular vote and 30 out of 120 seats in the Assembly of Kosovo; in 2007 PDK won a majority for the first time with 35% of the vote. In 2010&#x27;s disputed elections, PDK won again with 32% of the vote.

After 14 years of leadership of Hashim Thaçi who had to resign from party leadership to take the position of the President of the country, in May 2016, Parliament Speaker Kadri Veseli became party president by acclamation. He was elected with no votes against and no abstentions.

=== Elections in 2010 ===
Parliamentary elections were held on 12 December 2010, the first such elections organized in Kosovo since their declaration of independence. After early results, Hashim Thaçi, who was on course to gain 32 per cent of the vote, claimed victory for PDK, the Democratic Party of Kosovo. He said he intended to continue governing for another 4 years. After accusations of vote-rigging, voting was repeated in several municipalities. With more than 30 per cent of the vote, Thaçi formed a coalition with the New Kosovo Alliance, led by the ex-president, Behgjet Pacolli. It was in fourth place with 8 percent of the popular vote.

The turnout at the election was significantly higher than usual, augmented by Serbs who decided to vote in the disputed republic. Following the confirmation of the final election results, PDK and AKR formed a government with a program dedicated to EU integrations. The new government included many of the younger generation of PDK members, such as Bedri Hamza, Memli Krasniqi, Vlora Çitaku, Blerand Stavileci, Petrit Selimi, etc.

== Controversies ==

MPs Rrustem Mustafa and Latif Gashi resigned their offices in 2015 after receiving confirmed sentenced for war crimes. In April 2016, PDK MP Azem Syla was sought for arrest in connection to a large criminal group which appropriated socially owned property located in Prishtina’s suburbs amounting 30 million EUR.

Seven out of ten current mayors belonging to the PDK have been investigated, charged or convicted of abuse of office and other criminal activity. Sami Lushtaku of Skenderaj has been sentenced to 12 years for war crimes while he is being investigated for a corruption case. He ran for mayoral reelections and is serving in office both from prison. Nexhat Demaku of Drenas has been sentenced to one year and is being investigated in another case. Salim Jenuzi of Dragash was charged but found not guilty. Bajram Mulaku of Vushtrria and Begzad Sinani of Kamenica were investigated but not charged. Sinani is again under investigation for alleged illegal hunting. Former Lipjan mayor Shukri Buja was sentenced to four months suspended imprisonment for not declaring property to the Anti-Corruption agency, while Vitia Mayor Nexhmedin Arifi to 18 months suspended imprisonment for misuse of official position. Xhabir Zharku of Kaçanik was convicted to three years in prison for threats related to a privatisation case and illegal possession of a firearm forcing him to resign his position but was allowed to escape to Sweden where he now lives. Ramadan Muja of Prizren was convicted by a court of first instance. The case has been returned to retrial meanwhile Muja has run for and won a second term as mayor. Former Ferizaj Mayor Bajrush Xhemajli started serving a two-year sentence in 2014 after being convicted for killing a person in a traffic accident in 2009. The prosecution also investigated the former mayor of Gjilan Qemal Mustafa for road tenders but did not file charges. Sokol Bashota of Klina was being investigated for abuse of office in 2016.

In 2000 the brother of PDK leader Hashim Thaçi Gani Thaçi was found during a raid in Prishtina with a million German marks (500,000 euros) in cash. The origin of the money was uncertain.

Former Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi was in office when about 1.5 million euros were embezzled is a case related to the production of passports by an Austrian company. Later about 200,000 of them were discovered in a chauffeur of Kadri Veseli. Adem Grabovci, leader of PDK parliamentary group, was involved in the &quot;Pronto&quot; scandal, a leak of audio recordings of an EULEX investigation, in which Adem Grabovci, Hashim Thaçi and Vlora Çitaku discuss employment of an uncle of Grabovci, Curr Gjoci. Shortly afterwards, Gjoci was appointed Director of the University Clinical Centre in Prishtina. In another scandal Grabovci&#x27;s sons beat several police officers. They were sentenced to a prison sentence of six months which converted to 3,000 EUR fine each.

<doc id="1260621" wikidata="Q4816229" url="?curid=1260621" title="Atlantean (film series)">
<text>Atlantean is a quartet of documentary films and accompanying book (&quot;The Atlantean Irish&quot;, Lilliput, 2005) by Irish filmmaker Bob Quinn. The films and book dismissed as myth the popular belief in origins of the inhabitants of Ireland and proposed instead that they are part of a common &#x27;Atlantean&#x27; culture that includes the western seaboard of Europe and North Africa.

==Overview==
Quinn focused on various traditional aspects of Irish culture and argued for their non-Celtic nature. One aspect he stressed is the role of sailing in Connemara society, where his films were made. Quinn investigated the history of the Atlantic sea lanes from the Baltic Sea, Ireland, Britain, as far south as the Mediterranean and North Africa. Quinn suggested that Ireland&#x27;s first inhabitants came by boat sometime after the end of the last ice age – probably from the warmer, more populous south. As navigation gave rise to coastal settlement over long periods of time, overseas trade and cultural exchanges continued until at least the North African pirates of the 17th century. These connections can be seen in ship building styles and sailing techniques, for example in similarities between the Galway Púcán and the Arab Dhow.

Another aspect focused on by Quinn is the sean-nós or &quot;Old Style&quot; of Irish song and dance. The non-European feel of &quot;sean-nós&quot; singing in particular has often been commented upon. Quinn originally proposed a North African origin for &quot;sean-nós&quot;, but later agreed that it is shared by the Tatars of Tatarstan, thus an archetypal musical form older than the Book of Kells. Quinn argues that Irish language, music and art are related to ancient Iberian, Mediterranean and North African culture, in particular the indigenous Berbers of North Africa.

According to Quinn, the idea of &quot;Celtic&quot; origins was a Greek term – Keltoi (Κελτοί) – used to describe any &quot;barbarian&quot; who was not Greek. The Romans perpetuated the slur until 1707 when Edward Lluyd resurrected it as a compliment. It was taken for granted by Anglo-Irish antiquarians who found it a useful way of distinguishing themselves not only from the English but from the &quot;mere Irish&quot;. The term also developed &quot;untermensch&quot; resonances (see Matthew Arnold).

Bob Quinn developed these ideas into a book: &quot;The Atlantean Irish: Ireland&#x27;s oriental and maritime heritage&quot;. Barry Cunliffe, distinguished Professor Emeritus of European Archaeology and author of &quot;Facing the Ocean&quot; (2001) wrote the introduction to Quinn&#x27;s &quot;Atlantean Irish&#x27;.&#x27;

==Evidence==
The &#x27;Celtic&#x27; Origin of the Irish has long been questioned by archaeologists. In recent years, the discovery of mitochondrial DNA has been used as a method to map the historical migration of mankind&#x27;s genetic groups. Such genetic tests, conducted in Ireland in 2004, seemed to confirm that the theory of Celtic origins of Ireland&#x27;s population was genetically unfounded but recent advances in genetic testing (especially recent Ancient DNA findings) are giving an almost opposite picture from the older testing interpretations. In earlier tests, Bryan Sykes, genetic scientist and author of bestseller &quot;The Seven Daughters of Eve&quot;, while analysing European DNA groups identified what he called the &quot;Clan of Tara&quot; – a genetic group that originated in what is now Tuscany, Italy 17,000 years ago during the Ice Age and that spread along the coasts of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic seaboards of continental Europe, Ireland and Western Britain. Sykes did not conduct genetic tests in North Africa amongst Berbers.

==Criticisms==
The Atlantean thesis has not generally been accepted by the Irish academic establishment, who have criticised Bob Quinn for his alleged lack of scholarly methodology and the absence of hard evidence to back his theories. Quinn&#x27;s response to this is to assert that traditional landlubber methods of scholarship ignore the maritime dimension of Irish history and can fail to recognise the deeper, more intuitive links that may exist between cultures and countries. He also asserts that a close-minded, elitist attitude among academics prevents a more sympathetic appraisal of his work. More controversially, he maintains that critics of his work are guilty of an unconscious racism, or in his own words, of being afraid of the idea that Irish people might have &#x27;a touch of the tar&#x27; about them.

<doc id="1260649" wikidata="Q2788567" url="?curid=1260649" title="Ceoltóirí Chualann">
<text>Ceoltóirí Chualann ( ) was an Irish traditional band, led by Seán Ó Riada, which included many of the founding members of The Chieftains. Ceoltóirí is the Irish word for musicians, and Cualann is the name of an area just outside Dublin where Ó Riada lived. Ó Riada&#x27;s work with Ceoltóirí Chualann is credited with revitalizing the use of the bodhrán as a percussion instrument in Celtic music.

In 1960 Ó Riada was looking for musicians to perform music for the play &quot;The Song of the Anvil&quot; by Bryan MacMahon. Paddy Moloney, at the age of 20, was called to participate in the project, along with his friend Sean Potts on tin whistle, Sonny Brogan on accordion and John Kelly on fiddle.

They rehearsed weekly in Ó Riada&#x27;s house in Galloping Green, on the outskirts of Dublin.

Following its success, Ó Riada had the idea of forming Ceoltóirí Chualann, a band to play traditional Irish songs with accompaniment and traditional dance tunes and slow airs, arranged with instruments: harpsichord, bodhran, piano, fiddle, accordions, flute, pipes and whistles. The idea of actually arranging folk music, or dance music, had been done on at least one or two 78rpm recordings in the past, but they were folk tunes done in a classical way, highly orchestrated.
Another aim was to revitalize the work of blind harpist and composer Turlough O&#x27;Carolan.

The band was launched during the Dublin Theatre Festival in September 1960, at the Shelbourne Hotel, at an event called &quot;Reacaireacht an Riadaigh&quot; (Ó Riada&#x27;s Recital). Included in the program were traditional singers, writer Seán Ó Ríordáin and poet Seán Ó Tuama. In March of the following year Ó Riada recorded the first of a series of radio programmes for which he retained the name &quot;Reacaireacht an Riadaigh&quot;, and included music played by Ceoltóirí Chualann. Soon after the band&#x27;s formation, Peadar Mercier and Seán Keane joined.

Ceoltóirí Chualann continued to play until 1969. Their music was featured in the 1968 documentary, &quot;The Village&quot;, by Mark McCarty (director) and Paul Hockings (anthropologist). During 1969 they recorded two albums, &quot;Ó Riada&quot; and &quot;Ó Riada Sa Gaiety&quot;. The latter of those two albums was not released until after 1971, when Seán Ó Riada died.

<text>A rural municipality (RM) is a type of incorporated municipality in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. A rural municipality is created by the Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 49 of &quot;The Municipalities Act&quot;.

Saskatchewan has 296 rural municipalities, which are located in the central and southern portions of the province. They had a cumulative population of  and an average population of in the 2016 Census of Population. Saskatchewan&#x27;s largest and smallest rural municipalities are the RM of Corman Park No. 344 and the RM of Glen McPherson No. 46 with populations of 8,568 and 72 respectively.

The northern half of the province does not lie within any rural municipality, but is rather administered by the provincial government through the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District.

<doc id="1260657" wikidata="Q7632624" url="?curid=1260657" title="Succession to the Crown Bill 2004">
<text>&quot;This is about the planned bill introduced in 2004. For other proposed bills of the same name, see Succession to the Crown Bill&quot;

The Succession to the Crown Bill was a British Private Member&#x27;s Bill aimed at reforming the manner of succession to the British monarchy published in the House of Lords by Labour peer Lord Dubs on 9 December 2004, and withdrawn by him on 14 January 2005, after the Government said that it would block the Bill.

It would have involved three major measures: firstly, the change of the form of primogeniture used from male-preference to gender-neutral (absolute) primogeniture—that is, that the eldest child would succeed regardless of gender; secondly, that the Acts of Union 1707, both in Scotland and in England, as well as other relevant legislation, be altered to remove the clauses forbidding the monarch or heirs from marrying any Catholic; and, thirdly, the revocation of the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which requires descendants of King George II (other than descendants of princesses who married foreigners) to obtain the Sovereign&#x27;s consent to marry. However, the provisions of the Act of Settlement 1701, barring the monarch from &quot;being&quot; Catholic, would have still remained in force.

The most immediate effect of the Bill passing and becoming law would have been the moving of Princess Anne from her then position of ninth on the line of succession to the British throne to fourth, displacing Prince Andrew, Duke of York. It was unclear as to how the Bill would have affected the line of succession in the other 15 Commonwealth realms as it explicitly applied to the United Kingdom only. The Bill drew on the recommendations of the Fabian Society&#x27;s Commission on the Future of the Monarchy, which reported in 2003. Lord Dubs is a member of the Fabian Society&#x27;s executive committee.

<text>The Albanian Christian Democratic Party of Kosovo (, PSHDK) is a political party in Kosovo. It embraces Christian-democratic ideals in Kosovo, although not all of its members are Catholic, as is the case in some other countries.
At the last legislative elections, 24 October 2004, the party won 1.8% of the popular vote and 2 out of 120 seats.

The president of Albanian Christian Democratic Party of Kosovo is Nikë Gjeloshi.

The Albanian Christian Democratic Party of Kosovo is a close ally of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), consequently, the first post-war minister of transport and telecommunications of the Kosovo Government was a member of PShDK. The Albanian Christian Democratic Party of Kosovo platform supports Kosovo independence and like all other Kosovo Albanian political parties does not take part in the general elections in Serbia nor any other election or referendum organized by the Serbian parliament.

<text>Máire Ní Chathasaigh (; born 1956) is an Irish harpist, composer and singer.

==Biography==
She was born in Bandon, County Cork, Ireland, in a musical family. She learned to playthe harp when she was eleven. She created new harp ornamentation techniques that made its stylistically accurate performance possible. Having won All-Ireland (Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann) harp competitions at under-fourteen and under-eighteen levels, she then, in the mid-1970s, won the Senior All-Ireland competition three years in succession. She also won the Pan-Celtic Harp Competition at junior and senior levels.

She was the 2001 recipient of TG4 Gradam Ceoil Ceoltóir na Bliana / Musician of the Year, awarded &quot;for the excellence and pioneering force of her music, the remarkable growth she has brought to the music of the harp and for the positive influence she has had on the young generation of harpers&quot;.

In 1985 she recorded &quot;The New-Strung Harp,&quot; the first harp album to concentrate primarily on traditional Irish dance music. Her stylistic innovations made her famous in the Celtic music scene.

Her partnership with English guitarist Chris Newman made its début on the main stage at the 1987 Cambridge Folk Festival. Since then they have toured as a duo all over Europe, North America, Australasia and Japan.

In 1988 they recorded &quot;The Living Wood&quot;, their first duo album, and since then they have recorded six further duo albums and a quartet album, &quot;Heartstring Sessions&quot;, with Ní Chathasaigh&#x27;s sister Nollaig Casey and Nollaig&#x27;s husband Arty McGlynn (all four toured together in Europe, North America and Australasia as the Heartstring Quartet). In 2015 Ní Chathasaigh recorded a trio album, &quot;Sibling Revelry&quot;, with her sisters Nollaig Casey and Mairéad Ní Chathasaigh. All albums were critically-acclaimed.

She features on the cover of the book &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; and the June–July 2017 issue of Germany&#x27;s &quot;Folk Magazin&quot; and of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Treoir&quot;. She and Chris Newman were featured on the cover, and in an article within, the April / May 2021 issue of &quot;The Living Tradition&quot; magazine.

She is profiled in &quot;Celtic Women in Music&quot; by Mairéad Sullivan, &quot;The Rough Guide to Irish Music&quot; and a number of magazine and newspaper articles.

A TV documentary programme about Ní Chathasaigh and her sister Nollaig (also featuring their sister Mairéad, together with Chris Newman and Nollaig&#x27;s late husband Arty McGlynn) was originally broadcast on TG4 on November 29, 2020, and re-broadcast 13 February 2022, as part of its &quot;&#x27;Sé mo Laoch&quot; series. It can currently be watched on the TG4 Player here.

Máire has been giving masterclasses and disseminating her ideas and techniques in Ireland, the UK, Europe, North America and Australasia since the mid-1970s. Her arrangements have been published in two books, &quot;The Irish Harper Vols. I and II&quot;, and she has an honours degree in Celtic Studies from University College Cork.

<doc id="1260687" wikidata="Q73260904" url="?curid=1260687" title="Schreckstoff">
<text>In 1938, the Austrian ethologist Karl von Frisch made his first report on the existence of the chemical alarm signal known as Schreckstoff (fright substance) in minnows. An alarm signal is a response produced by an individual, the &quot;sender&quot;, reacting to a hazard that warns other animals, the receivers, of danger. This chemical alarm signal is released only when the sender incurs mechanical damage, such as when it has been caught by a predator, and is detected by the olfactory system. When this signal reaches the receivers, they perceive a greater predation risk and exhibit an antipredator response. Since populations of fish exhibiting this trait survive more successfully, the trait is maintained via natural selection. While the evolution of this signal was once a topic of great debate, recent evidence suggests schreckstoff evolved as a defense against environmental stressors such as pathogens, parasites, and UVB radiation and that it was later co-opted by predators and prey as a chemical signal.

==Background==
Chemical alarm systems have been identified in a number of different taxa, including gastropods, echinoderms, amphibians and fishes. One of the most well-studied chemical alarm signals is schreckstoff, the use of which is widespread in the superorder Ostariophysi (e.g., minnows, characins, catfishes, etc.). About 64% of all freshwater fish species and 27% of all fish species worldwide are found in the ostariophysan superorder, which highlights the widespread use and importance of this chemical alarm system in fishes.

==Schreckstoff in ostariophysans==
The production of schreckstoff has been shown to be metabolically expensive and is therefore part of a conditional strategy that can only be employed by individuals with access to sufficient resources. One putative active ingredient in schreckstoff is hypoxanthine-3N-oxide (H3NO), which may be produced in club cells which will henceforth be referred to as &quot;alarm substance cells&quot;. The nitrogen oxide functional group was found to be the main chemical trigger of antipredator behavior in receivers. Schreckstoff is a mixture, and fragments of a glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, are able to trigger fear responses. The precursor polysaccharide is a component of mucus, and fragments are proposed to be produced during injury. Like schreckstoff obtained from skin extract, chondroitin sulfate activates a subset of olfactory sensory neurons.

Production of and responses to schreckstoff change over the course of ontogeny. For example, young brook sticklebacks (&quot;Culaea inconstans&quot;) are more likely to be caught in minnow traps that have been baited with conspecific skin extracts than adults. This result indicates young brook sticklebacks do not make the association between schreckstoff and the potential presence of a predator as readily as adults. Whether this association strengthens over time as a result of learning or physiological development remains unclear.

In addition to changes across ontogeny, the degree to which schreckstoff is produced varies within the breeding season. Male fathead minnows (&quot;Pimephales promelas&quot;) cease production of schreckstoff during the breeding season, but still exhibit antipredator behaviors in response to schreckstoff during this time. Schreckstoff production may be halted at this time because male fathead minnows often incur mechanical damage while building their nests. It would be detrimental to a male to produce schreckstoff while building a nest, as it would inadvertently repel females, thereby decreasing the likelihood of obtaining a mate. By ceasing schreckstoff production during the breeding season, males circumvent this problem. The cessation of alarm substance cell production appears to be controlled by androgens.

==Hypotheses for the evolution of schreckstoff==
A number of different hypotheses have been proposed for the evolution of schreckstoff. The first hypothesis is that the evolution of schreckstoff has been driven by kin selection. Support for this hypothesis would include evidence that individuals live in groups of closely related kin and that the release of chemical alarm signals increases the likelihood that related individuals will avoid predation. The second hypothesis, predator attraction, suggests the release of schreckstoff may attract additional predators which will interfere with the predation event, increasing the likelihood that the prey will escape and survive the attack. This hypothesis assumes predators will be attracted to schreckstoff and will interfere with one another either through competition for the captured prey or through predation of one another. It additionally assumes, despite the fact that the prey has already incurred mechanical damage, it is possible for the prey to escape and recover from the attack. Testing and validating these assumptions would provide support for the predator attraction hypothesis. The third hypothesis proposes that schreckstoff has an immune function, providing protection against pathogens, parasites and/or UVB radiation. For this hypothesis to be supported, a correlation between alarm substance cell production and the presence of pathogens and parasites would need to be observed. Direct evidence that schreckstoff inhibits the growth of aquatic pathogens and parasites would provide additional support for the immunity hypothesis. Another hypothesis is that schreckstoff is a breakdown product of mucus and club cells, induced by injury. Selection for the alarm response is primarily at the level of the receiver.

===Kin selection hypothesis===
One of the first hypotheses for the evolution of schreckstoff centered on W.D. Hamilton’s theory of kin selection. Under the theory of kin selection, the sender of the chemical alarm signal would be willing to incur the costs of sending this signal if the benefits to related individuals were sufficiently high. In a situation where the sender of the signal is paying great costs (i.e., it releases the chemical alarm signal because it has incurred potentially mortal mechanical damage), the benefits to closely related kin would have to be great. Under the framework of kin selection, behaviors that are seemingly detrimental to the sender are selected because they benefit individuals that are likely to share alleles by common descent. In this way, the frequency of the sender&#x27;s alleles in the next generation is increased by their presence in successful kin.

To apply kin selection theory to the evolution of schreckstoff, a number of conditions must be met. First, evidence must exist for the release of schreckstoff by the sender confers benefiting the receivers. Second, it must be shown that individuals in the order Ostariophysi associate mainly with family members. If either of these two assumptions is violated, then the kin selection hypothesis would not be supported.

Some evidence exists in support of the first assumption that the release of schreckstoff confers quantifiable advantages to the receivers of this chemical signal. A laboratory experiment revealed that fathead minnows exposed to conspecific schreckstoff survived 39.5% longer than controls when placed in a tank with a predatory northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;). This finding suggests schreckstoff increases vigilance in receivers, resulting in a quicker reaction time following detection of the predator.

The second assumption, that individuals in the order Ostariophysi associate with close family members, does not appear to be supported by empirical evidence. In shoals of European minnows (&quot;Phoxinus phoxinus&quot;), no difference in relatedness was found within and between shoals, indicating individuals are not associating more closely with relatives than nonrelatives. Shoal composition has not been examined in all members of the ostariophysan order, and shoals composed entirely of family members may yet be discovered. Nevertheless, the finding that schreckstoff production is maintained in a species where the function is clearly unrelated to kin benefits provides strong evidence against kin selection as a mechanism for the evolution of schreckstoff.

Fathead minnows have also been found to produce fewer epidermal alarm substance cells (and therefore less schreckstoff) when in the presence of familiar shoalmates. The results of this study indicate one of two scenarios, neither of which is compatible with the hypothesis that schreckstoff evolved by kin selection. First, if schreckstoff evolved by kin selection, more epidermal alarm substance cells would be expected to be produced in the presence of kin than nonkin. This means familiar shoalmates in fathead minnows should be closely related kin and schreckstoff production should be increased when in shoals with familiar individuals. The study did not find this to be the case. Second, these results indicate individuals either do not associate with kin at all or production of schreckstoff varies depending on how familiar the focal fish is with the individuals with which it shoals. In conclusion, evidence does not support the hypothesis that schreckstoff evolved because it bolstered the inclusive fitness of the sender through increased survival of kin.

===Predator attractant hypothesis===
The predator attractant hypothesis proposes that the main purpose of schreckstoff is to attract additional predators to the area. According to this hypothesis, additional predators will interact with the initial predator, and these interactions will provide the sender with an opportunity to escape. A number of conditions must be met to support this hypothesis. First, schreckstoff must attract predators. Second, subsequent predators must disrupt the predation event, thereby increasing the probability that the prey will escape. Third, the sender must be able to recover from the mechanical damage incurred during the predation event.

A study provides support for the first condition that the release of schreckstoff must attract predators. This experiment revealed that schreckstoff extracted from the skin of fathead minnows attracted both northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;) and predatory diving beetles (&quot;Colymbetes sculptilis&quot;). Additionally, a natural study showed that predatory fish were seven times more likely to strike a lure baited with a sponge soaked in fathead minnow skin extract than a sponge soaked in either water or skin extract from a nonostariophysan convict cichlid (which presumably does not produce schreckstoff).

While the previous two studies provided examples of systems in which schreckstoff acts to attract additional predators, a system was found for which this was not the case. Spotted bass (&quot;Micropterus punctulatus&quot;) were exposed to skin (containing schreckstoff) and muscle (control, containing no schreckstoff) extracts from five different co-occurring prey species. The spotted bass were not attracted to any of the schreckstoff treatments. This result indicates schreckstoff does not always attract relevant predators in the area. Northern pike are an introduced species in many areas, so were not likely to be coevolving with fathead minnows during the evolution of the schreckstoff system. This system may be more ecologically relevant and little evidence suggests schreckstoff evolved as a predator attractant. In conclusion, the debate continues over whether or not the first condition for this hypothesis has been met.

The second condition that needs to be met in support of the predator attraction hypothesis is that additional predators must occasionally disrupt predation events, increasing the probability that prey will escape. In the northern pike/fathead minnow system, additional northern pike may interfere with a predation event in one of two ways. First, additional northern pike of the same size interfere with a predation event by coming into contact with the main predator (biting it, etc.). Second, additional pike of larger size attracted to schreckstoff may prey on the initial predator.

The probability that fathead minnows escape after being captured by a northern pike significantly increases when a second pike interferes with the predation event. The northern pike have an age-structured population biased towards younger, smaller individuals. If a younger pike attacks a fathead minnow and attracts an older, larger conspecific, then the younger pike may be at risk of cannibalism and will be inclined to release the prey to focus on escape. In regards to the second condition, additional predators do appear to disrupt predation events, increasing the probability that the sender will escape. The final condition, that individuals need to successfully recover from a predation event, appears to be satisfied. Support for this condition comes from the observation that many small fishes in natural populations exhibit scars, presumably from failed predator attempts.

While the evidence that schreckstoff attracts predators is mixed, studies indicate multiple predators will interfere with each other and prey can recover from predation events when they manage to escape. The extent to which predators are attracted to a predation event depends upon the speed at which schreckstoff diffuses through its aquatic environment, which in turn depends upon water flow parameters. This hypothesis indicates schreckstoff evolved as a way of increasing the probability of survival during a predation event and its role as a predator cue for conspecifics evolved subsequently. Supported by more empirical studies than the kin selection hypothesis, the predator attraction hypothesis remained popular for quite some time.

===Schreckstoff as a possible defense against pathogens, parasites and UVB radiation===
The final hypothesis posits that schreckstoff has an immune function and may be the first line of defense against pathogens, parasites, and/or UVB radiation. Evidence for this hypothesis is strong. A recent comprehensive study revealed that exposure to parasites and pathogens that penetrate the skin of ostariophysans stimulated the production of alarm cells. Additionally, increased exposure to UV radiation was correlated with an increase in alarm cell production.

The role of schreckstoff in immune response was further strengthened by the finding that skin extracts from fathead minnows inhibited the growth of &quot;Saprolegnia ferax&quot; (a water mould) in culture. In contrast, skin extracts from swordtails (&quot;Xiphophorus helleri&quot;), which are not believed to produce schreckstoff, increased &quot;S. ferax&quot; growth compared to controls. Cadmium, a heavy metal and an immunosuppressant in vertebrates, inhibits the production of alarm cells when fishes are infected with Saprolegnia. Furthermore, a follow-up study treated fathead minnows with cortisol, a well-known immunosuppressant, which significantly reduced alarm cell investment in conjunction with leukocyte activity. The results of these extensive studies strongly suggest schreckstoff&#x27;s main function is to provide immunity against a number of environmental threats aimed at the fish&#x27;s epidermis.

If schreckstoff evolved as a defense against pathogens, parasites, and UVB radiation, then the release of schreckstoff into the environment subsequently allowed for both predators and prey to exploit this system. Predators in some systems may use schreckstoff as a cue for an easy meal, either by disrupting the predation event to steal the prey item for themselves or by preying on the initial predator. Nearby conspecifics then exploit schreckstoff as a chemical cue, alerting them to the presence of a predator in the area.

==Ecological considerations==
The most convincing research to date indicates alarm substance cells serve as an immune system response and the ecological ramifications of this substance as a chemical alarm signal developed subsequently. This finding generates a number of interesting research questions. First, as mentioned earlier, males in many ostariophysan species cease production of alarm substance cells during the breeding season, presumably so females are not inadvertently repelled from the nest when males incur mechanical damage during nest building. In light of the immune hypothesis, alarm substance cells possibly are instead produced less during the breeding season because increased testosterone levels may decrease immune responses. Additionally, this finding indicates males are at a greater risk from UVB radiation, as well as parasite and pathogen infection, during the breeding season.

The role of schreckstoff as an immune response has additional implications in this age of increasing environmental change. Environmental stressors, including UVB radiation, pollution, and parasites, are increasing in the environment, and are likely to continue increasing over time. UVB radiation exposure is increasing due to decreases in stratospheric ozone, diseases are becoming increasingly important at both local and global scales, and pollutants, including heavy metals, are being introduced into ecosystems. If cadmium, the heavy metal affecting the fish&#x27;s ability to produce schreckstoff in response to environmental stressors, increased in concentration in the environment, the immune response of many ostariophysan fishes would be compromised.

<text>Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (; HUM) is a Pakistan-based Islamist jihadist group operating primarily in Kashmir. The group had links to Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar.

The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by Bahrain, the United Nations, the United Kingdom and the United States. In response the organization changed its name to Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. The group splintered from Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI), a Pakistani group formed in 1980 to fight the Soviet military in Afghanistan. The Government of India has declared and banned HuM as a jihad organisation.

==Post Soviet–Afghan War==
Harkat-ul-Mujahideen was originally formed as a splinter group of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami in 1985. In 1989, at the end of Soviet–Afghan war, the group entered Kashmiri politics by use of militants under the leadership of Sajjad Afghani and Muzaffar Ahmad Baba Alias Mukhtar. In 1993 the group with Harkat-ul-Jehad-al-Islami to form Harkat-ul-Ansar.

Immediately following the merger India arrested three senior members: Nasrullah Mansur Langaryal, chief of the former Harkat-ul Mujahideen in November 1993; Maulana Masood Azhar, General Secretary in February 1994, and Sajjad Afghani (Sajjad Sajid) in the same month in Srinagar. Muzaffar Ahmad Baba was killed in an encounter at Pandan Nowhatta with the BSF in January 1994.

As a response the group carried out several kidnappings in an attempt to free their leaders, all of which failed. It was linked to the Kashmiri group al-Faran that kidnapped five Western tourists in Kashmir in July 1995; one, Hans Christian Ostrø, was killed in August 1995 and the other four reportedly were killed in December of the same year.

In 1997, the United States designated Harkat-ul-Ansar as a terrorist organization, and in response it renamed itself to Harkat-ul-Mujahideen.

In 1999, Sajjad was killed during a jailbreak which led to the hijacking, by the group, of Indian Airlines Flight 814 in December, which led to the release of Maulana Masood Azhar, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar by the Indian Government. Azhar did not, however, return to the HUM, choosing instead to form the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM), a rival militant group expressing a more radical line than the HUM, in early 2000.

==Post 9/11 attacks==
The group again came to the attention of the US after the 9/11 attacks, leading President George W. Bush to ban the group, this time under its Harkat-ul-Mujahideen moniker, on 25 September 2001.

The long-time leader of the group, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, in mid-February 2000 stepped down as HUM &quot;emir&quot;, turning the reins over to the popular Kashmiri commander and his second-in-command, Farooq Kashmiri. Khalil assumed the position of HUM Secretary General.

HUM is thought to have several thousand-armed supporters located in Pakistani Kashmir, and India&#x27;s southern Kashmir and Doda regions. It uses light and heavy machine guns, assault rifles, mortars, explosives, and rockets. HUM lost some of its membership due to defections to the Jaish-e-Mohammed.

The group is based in Muzaffarabad, Rawalpindi, and several other towns in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but members conduct insurgent and terrorist activities primarily in Kashmir.

The group&#x27;s current leader, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, lives openly in the Islamabad suburb of Golra Sharif. He has denied having any contact with Osama bin Laden.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Osama Bin Laden&#x27;s seized cellphones attest Harkat-ul-Mujahideen&#x27;s continued contact with Osama Bin Laden and its bases and fighters shared with the Taliban over the years following the war in Afghanistan.

==Designation as terrorist organization==

The countries and organizations below have officially listed the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM) as a terrorist organization.

==Harkat ul-Ansar==

Harkat ul-Ansar (HuA) was an Islamic terrorist organization founded by Abdelkader Mokhtari in 1993. It was the result of a merger between Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI). Many of its operations were conducted in Jammu and Kashmir.

Soon after its founding, several members of its leadership were arrested by Indian Security Forces. In November 1993, the former head of HuM, Nasrullah Mansur Langrayal, was arrested. In February 1994, the HuA general secretary, Maulana Masood Azhar and chief commander, Sajjad Afghani, were captured in the Chattargul area of Anantnag district.

It was labeled a terrorist organization in 1997 by the United States because of its connections with Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden. The ban severely limited the funding of the group, and as a result HuA was reorganized as a reincarnated Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. At the time, Azhar split from the group to form Jaish-e-Mohammed. In 1998, U.S.&#x27;s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in its report stated, &quot;HuA, an Islamic terrorist organisation that Pakistan supports in its proxy war against Indian forces in Kashmir, increasingly is using terrorist tactics against Westerners and random attacks on civilians that could involve Westerners to promote its pan-Islamic agenda.&quot; CIA also stated that Hua had abducted at least 13 persons, of which 12 were from western countries in the period from early 1994 to 1998.
