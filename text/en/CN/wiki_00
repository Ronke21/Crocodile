<text>Reginald Stanley Judson, (29 September 1881 – 26 August 1972) was a New Zealand recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest military award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; given to British and Commonwealth forces. He was awarded the VC for his actions in the Second Battle of Bapaume during the First World War.

Born in Wharehine, Judson was a boiler maker when he enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force for service in the First World War. He was severely wounded in September 1916 during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. After two years of medical treatment and recovery, he returned to active duty in France in June 1918. Prior to the Second Battle of Bapaume, he had already received the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Medal, with all three medals being earned in a four-week period between July and August 1918. After the war he joined the New Zealand Staff Corps as a commissioned officer. He retired in 1937 and performed secretarial work as well as becoming involved in local body politics. He returned to the military during the Second World War and served on the home front. After retiring from the military for a second time in 1946, he took up farming at Mangonui in Northland. He died in Auckland in 1972, at the age of 90.

==Early life==
Reginald Stanley Judson was born into a farming family at Wharehine, north of Auckland, in New Zealand, on 29 September 1881, the son of Emma Frances Judson ( Holmden) and Edgar William Judson. After being educated at Port Albert and completing a mechanical engineering apprenticeship, he worked as a boilermaker and engineer in Auckland, living in the suburb of Ponsonby. In 1905 he married Ethel Grice and the union resulted in four children.

==First World War==
Judson enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in October 1915 and embarked for the Middle East in January 1916 as a reinforcement with the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. In February, shortly after arriving in Egypt where the New Zealand Division was in the process of being formed, he was transferred to 1st Battalion, Auckland Infantry Regiment. Two months later, the division was transferred to the Western Front. Promoted to corporal, he participated in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette on 15 September 1916, where he was seriously wounded. He was evacuated to England and spent several months recovering from his injuries. Once his health permitted, he performed training duties and then spent a period of time in charge of a Royal Engineers depot in Codford.

In June 1918, Judson, now a sergeant, returned to his battalion which, along with the rest of the New Zealand Division, was engaged in fighting on the Somme in France. Late the following month, he rescued six of his fellow soldiers during a German counterattack near Hebuterne. For this action, he was recommended for the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM). On 16 August, he was at the forefront of a bayonet charge at Bucquoy that earned him the Military Medal (MM).

Ten days later, Judson participated in the Second Battle of Bapaume, an early engagement of the Hundred Days Offensive. The actions which led to Judson being awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), the DCM and the MM took place over a period of just four weeks. The citation for Judson&#x27;s VC was published in the same edition of the &quot;London Gazette&quot; as the citation for his DCM. His VC citation read as follows:
In September, Judson was a victim of a gas attack and returned to England to recover his health. He then attended an officer training school, first at Cambridge and then at Aldershot. By this time the war had ended and it was not until February 1919 that Judson was commissioned as a second lieutenant.

==Interwar period==
Before departing England, Judson, along with three other New Zealanders who had been awarded the VC, received his medal from King George V in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 27 February 1919. After an extended stay in hospital, he left for New Zealand in June 1919.

Discharged from the NZEF in October 1919 and having decided on a career as a professional soldier, Judson joined the New Zealand Staff Corps. He served in posts in Auckland and then New Plymouth, where he was the area officer. Due to his war wounds (eight fragments of shrapnel remained in his chest and abdomen) and the aftereffects of his gassing, his health was fragile, and he had two periods of extended sick leave in 1924 and 1934. Despite being regarded as a reliable and conscientious officer, promotion opportunities in the postwar Staff Corps were limited, and when he retired in 1937, it was with the rank of captain.

Judson&#x27;s marriage to Ethel had ended in divorce in 1920. Eight years later he married Kate Lewis, a war widow, and had a fifth child. On his retirement, Judson&#x27;s pension was insufficient to support him and his children. Unable to return to his civilian trade of engineering due to poor health, he found employment as a secretary at a school in Auckland. A year later, he was voted onto Auckland City Council for the Citizens and Ratepayers Association and served for nine years. He was one of six candidates who stood for selection for the electorate by the National Party for the , but Harry Merritt was chosen instead.

==Later life==
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Judson volunteered for military service. To be eligible, he deceived the authorities about his age. He served on the home front for the duration of the war, commanding the Guards Vital Points Battalion in Auckland. He retired from the military in September 1946 with the rank of major.

Judson moved to Mangonui in Northland and took up farming. He was also community minded, and served as a justice of the peace as well as being a coroner. He retired in the late 1950s, and returned to Auckland where he died on 26 August 1972. He was buried at Waikumete Cemetery, survived by his wife and four children. One of his sons, Reginald, served in the Second World War with the 24th Battalion as a chaplain and won the Military Cross during the Italian Campaign.

==Medal==
Judson&#x27;s Victoria Cross was displayed at the QEII Army Memorial Museum, Waiouru. On 2 December 2007 it was one of nine Victoria Crosses that were among a hundred medals stolen from the museum. On 16 February 2008, New Zealand Police announced all the medals had been recovered as a result of a NZ$300,000 reward offered by Michael Ashcroft and Tom Sturgess.

<text>Sixt SE is an international mobility service provider with about 2,000 locations in more than 100 countries. Sixt SE acts as a parent and holding company of the Sixt Group, which is internationally active in the business areas of vehicle rental, car sharing, ride-hailing, and subscription.

The majority of the company is owned by the Sixt family, who manage the company. The remaining share is tradeable stock: SIX2 (XETRA).

== History ==
=== Foundation ===


In 1912, Martin Sixt founded the company with a fleet of three cars, creating the first car rental company in Bavaria. During the First World War, the fleet was confiscated and used by the German Army. After the war, business resumed, but the fleet was once again seized by the German Army at the outbreak of World War II. When the war concluded, the company rebounded, establishing a taxi fleet for members of the United States Army stationed in Germany. It then opened a taxi business in Munich with the first radio taxis. In 1951, the car rental company Auto Sixt was founded.

=== 1980s ===
In 1982, Auto Sixt was renamed Sixt Autovermietung GmbH, with the name Sixt/Budget in the logo. The company was transformed again in 1986, this time becoming Sixt AG, a corporation traded on the German stock exchange. In 1988, the subsidiary Sixt Leasing GmbH was established.

=== 1990s ===
In 1993, the operating business of the AG was handed over to another subsidiary, Sixt GmbH &amp; Co Autovermietung KG. Sixt AG acted thereafter as a holding company of the group. Also in 1993, Sixt bought the assets of its competitor &quot;Autoverleih Buchbinder&quot;, operating the brand briefly before finally discontinuing it. Sixt had failed to secure the naming rights, and subsequently Buchbinder was re-established and continued operating in the market.

In 1999, the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) issued a landmark judgment against Sixt for illegal price fixing, requiring it to pay damages to its franchisees. Sixt had de facto controlled the pricing for the independent franchisees&#x27; prices, as they were part of the Germany-wide reservation system. In the event of pricing discrepancies, the rental agreements were returned to Germany. This was deemed inadmissible under German antitrust law (price fixing of the second hand) and forbidden by the BGH.

=== 2000s ===
In 2003, the corporation was forced to defend itself against hedge fund manager Florian Homm, who had speculated on declining stock prices. Homm was ultimately fined for price manipulation. In 2005, the Management Board Compensation Disclosure Act (VorstOG) entered into force. Sixt AG became the first company in Germany to exercise the right not to disclose directors&#x27; salaries without a shareholder vote of at least 75% majority. CEO Erich Sixt held at this time 56.8% of Sixt ordinary shares, corresponding to 89% of votes at the general meeting, meaning he was essentially able to determine the outcome. Overall, 98% of the voters approved the non-disclosure of executive pay.

In 2006, Sixt made a bid to take over its competitor, Europcar, when owner Volkswagen offered it for sale. In addition to antitrust concerns (Sixt at that time had approximately 23% market share, Europcar 22%), there was also resistance from the Europcar works council, which feared job cuts after the merger. Volkswagen finally accepted an offer by the French investment company Eurazeo. Since 2007 and via subsidiary companies, Sixt has operated the online brokerage of motor vehicles with the websites Autocommunity Carmondo, Mystocks, RadAlert, Winebase, and autohaus24.

=== 2010s ===

In 2010, former employees claimed that Sixt was opposed to setting up a works council. The company&#x27;s management denied the allegation. In 2011, the company opened its first branch in the USA in Florida. In 2013, Sixt AG was converted to the legal form of a European Company (Societas Europaea) and since then has been called Sixt SE. As part of the transition, a European Works Council (&quot;Sixt Europe Leaders Forum&quot;) was founded in 2013. In May 2015, Sixt brought its subsidiary Sixt Leasing AG to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

At the beginning of 2018, Sixt sold its shares in car sharing service DriveNow for 209 million euros to its joint venture partner BMW. In February 2019, Sixt started an own mobility platform and a new car sharing service named Sixt share. The services car rental, car sharing, ride hailing and car subscriptions are all combined into one app.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020, Sixt sold all its shares in Sixt Leasing SE in order to focus its business on its mobility services. In June 2020, Sixt acquired 10 concessions at U.S. airports from Advantage Rent a Car. The acquisition increased the number of Sixt stations in the United States to more than 85. At end of July 2020, Lyft and Sixt announced a joint venture, where Lyft app users can rent a car from both partners through the app.

In December 2021, the company expanded to Australia via a partnership with the NRMA. 160 branches and a total of 16,000 vehicles are thus franchised under the Sixt brand.

In 2022, Sixt becomes the first car rental company in Europe to offer BYD vehicles.

In December 2023, the company announced it was phasing out Teslas from its lineup following a price cut that hurt residual values in its lineup. The next month, the company announced it was buying as many as 250,000 vehicles from Stellantis NV. The order would be a combination of traditional combustion engine vehicles, plug-in hybrids, and electric cars to be used in Europe and North America. These moves came amid an industry-wide shift in how non-traditional cars would be used. At the time of the announcement, the company still had plans to electrify up to 90% of its fleet in Europe.

== Sponsorships ==
Sixt signed a sponsorship agreement with Galatasaray before the start of the 2020-21 football season.

<text>Sidney Henry Kibrick (born July 2, 1928) is an American former child actor primarily of the 1930s, most notable for appearing in the &quot;Our Gang/Little Rascals&quot; short subjects film series, featuring in more than two dozen, between 1933 and 1939.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kibrick was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA on July 2, 1928; his elder brother was actor and fellow &quot;Our Gang&quot; cast member Leonard Kibrick, born in 1924. He attended Mount Vernon Junior High and the University of Southern California.

===&quot;Our Gang (film shorts)&quot;===
Kibrick&#x27;s family relocated to Los Angeles when he was five and he was discovered at the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre with his mother, where the film producer was scouting for children to appear in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; film short subjects, which were created by Hal Roach. Kibrick initially featured in a brief non-dialogue appearance as an extra in the feature film &quot;Dead End&quot;, and was observed as one of three or so children huddled together during one of the river dock scenes. He made his uncredited film debut in &quot;Out all Night&quot; (1933), and after a few more uncredited roles was cast as a regular in 1935. Although his character was then unnamed, from 1937 to 1939 he was given the character name of &quot;Woim&quot; (a Brooklyn accent vernacular pronunciation of &quot;worm&quot;), who was the sidekick of the neighborhood bully &quot;Butch&quot;, played by Tommy Bond.

===Post-&quot;Our Gang&quot;===
Kibrick, after leaving his Hollywood showbiz career behind, worked as a real estate developer. He kept in touch with Our Gang members at reunions, some of which he used to host. In 1991, he acknowledged that he had avoided the tragic lives that former child actors often ended up having as adults. In 2022, he attended an exhibit at the Hollywood Museum, honoring the 100th anniversary of the series and, as of August 2023 at the age of 95, is cited as the last surviving Our Gang cast member.

<doc id="1227380" wikidata="Q600178" url="?curid=1227380" title="HSBC (Hong Kong)">
<text>The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (), commonly abbreviated as HSBC and formerly known as HongkongBank (; styled &quot;Wayfoong&quot; by the bank), is the Hong Kong–based Asia-Pacific subsidiary of the HSBC banking group, for which it was the parent entity until 1991. The largest bank in Hong Kong, HSBC operates branches and offices throughout the Indo-Pacific region and in other countries around the world. It is also one of the three commercial banks licensed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to issue banknotes for the Hong Kong dollar.

The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank was established in British Hong Kong in 1865 and was incorporated as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1866, and has been based in Hong Kong (although now as a subsidiary) ever since. It is the founding member of the HSBC group of banks and companies, and, since 1990, is the namesake and one of the leading subsidiaries of the London-based HSBC Holdings. The company&#x27;s business ranges from the traditional High Street roles of retail banking, commercial banking, corporate banking to investment banking, private banking and global banking.

==Hong Kong banking==

Under the HSBC brand, the bank maintains a network of around 220 branches throughout Hong Kong, from which it offers a wide range of financial products and services. For some time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the bank was known by the name HongkongBank in its native city, although it now trades as HSBC. During that period, it also adopted the idiosyncratic practice of calling its ATMs &quot;Electronic Teller Card (ETC)&quot; machines.

===Headquarters===

The HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building is located in No 1 Queen&#x27;s Road Central in the Central district on Hong Kong Island. It was also home to HSBC Holdings&#x27;s headquarters until the latter firm&#x27;s move to London to meet the requirements of the UK regulatory authorities after the acquisition of the Midland Bank in 1992. It was designed by British architect Norman, Lord Foster, and was the most expensive building in the world based on usable floor area at the time it was built.

===Hong Kong dollar bank notes===

HSBC is one of the three commercial banks which are authorised to issue banknotes for Hong Kong - the other two being the Bank of China (Hong Kong) and Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong). Of the total notes in circulation measured by value, HSBC is the most prolific issuer, its notes representing 67.7% of those in issue. Hong Kong is unusual in that it is one of the few countries or territories where commercial banks are still permitted to issue their own banknotes.

=== Closure of bank accounts ===
In June 2023, it was reported that HSBC had closed the bank accounts of the pro-democracy League of Social Democrats (LSD), and had refused to give reasons for its decision.

==Cultural references==

In Hong Kong, the local population sometimes refers to the bank as 獅子銀行, &quot;the Lion Bank&quot;, after the pair of lion sculptures outside the bank&#x27;s headquarters, which also appear in some banknotes. Local films and television series set in Hong Kong, especially comedies, use this nickname when referring to the bank.

Although the Hong Kong Government changed the official spelling of &quot;Hongkong&quot; to &quot;Hong Kong&quot;, by the instructions of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, on 3 September 1926, HSBC uses the older &quot;Hongkong&quot;, as the bank&#x27;s name was conceived before the official declaration of the modern two-word name, and it was decided to retain the single word spelling in the bank&#x27;s name: &quot;Hongkong&quot;.

The English humorist P. G. Wodehouse was a junior employee at the bank&#x27;s London office in Lombard Street from 1900 to 1902, and used the bank as an inspiration for some of his early work, especially his 1910 novel &quot;Psmith in the City&quot;.

<text>Pilėnai (also &quot;Pillenen&quot; in German) was a hill fort in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Its location is unknown and is subject to academic debates, but it is well known in the history of Lithuania due to its heroic defense against the Teutonic Order in 1336. Attacked by a large Teutonic force, the fortress, commanded by Duke Margiris, tried in vain to organize a defense against the larger and stronger invader. Losing hope, the defenders decided to burn their property and commit mass suicide to deprive the Order of prisoners and loot (cf. scorched earth). This dramatic episode from the Lithuanian Crusade has caught the public imagination, inspired many works of fiction, and became a symbol of Lithuanian struggles and resistance.

== Sources ==

The attack and the defense of Pilėnai were briefly mentioned in several contemporary chronicles, including &quot;Epitome gestarum Prussiae&quot; by a Sambian canon, &quot;Der Chronist von Wolfenbüttel&quot; (Chronicler of Wolfenbüttel), &quot;Annalista Thorunensis&quot; (Annals of Thorn), and &quot;Kurze Reimchronik von Preussen&quot; (Short Rhymed Chronicle of Prussia). However, these sources recite the basic facts and do not provide enough information to reconstruct the events.

The only contemporary source that describes the events in greater detail is the chronicle of Wigand of Marburg. However, Wigand&#x27;s original German text has not survived. His work is known from a Latin translation commissioned by Jan Długosz in 1464. Several excerpts of the original German text were published by Caspar Schütz (died 1594) and (died 1597). When Theodor Hirsch prepared Wigand&#x27;s chronicle for publication in &quot;Scriptores Rerum Prussicarum&quot;, he included these excerpts alongside the Latin translation. In particular, Hirsch believed that Schütz&#x27;s text on Pilėnai was more complete and accurate copy of Wigand than the Latin translation. This opinion has been widely accepted and historians used Schütz&#x27;s text, which paints a much more heroic and dramatic picture of Pilėnai, as Wigand&#x27;s original. This long-standing belief has been challenged by Lithuanian historian Darius Baronas. He has shown that Schütz&#x27;s text was an unreliable and embellished retelling of Wigand&#x27;s work. Therefore, the only reliable source is the Latin translation of Wigand&#x27;s chronicle.

==Attack and defense==

The Teutonic Order waged the decades-long Lithuanian Crusade against the pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania in hopes of converting it to Christianity. In early 1336, the Order organized another large campaign into Lithuania. Their force included Louis, Margrave of Brandenburg, counts of Henneberg (most likely ) and Namur (most likely Guy II, Marquis of Namur), and other nobles from France and Austria. In total, according to Wigand of Marburg, there were 200 nobles. Another German chronicle, known as &quot;Der Chronist von Wolfenbüttel&quot;, counted a total of 6,000 soldiers.

On the feast day of Saint Matthias (February 25), this large force attacked Pilėnai, located in Trapėnai land, where some 4,000 people from four different lands sought shelter from the invasion. Wigand&#x27;s description of further events paints a chaotic and bloody scene. He claims that the people panicked as soon as they saw the Christian army and decided to burn their belongings and commit suicide. It was said that one old woman killed a hundred people with an ax before killing herself. Others managed to escape on horseback. Duke Margiris attempted to organize defense, but soon was overwhelmed by the attackers who threw burning wood and stones into the fortress. Margiris then cut his wife with a sword, threw her body into the fire, and killed his loyal guards and followers. Thus, Pilėnai fell and the Order collected the remaining prisoners and loot. &quot;Kurze Reimchronik von Preussen&quot; mentioned that 5,000 people were killed and only a handful escaped.

That is all of the information available from contemporary sources. Later historians and authors added many heroic and dramatic details. For example, they added a large pyre and murder of children and women; the 4,000 people seeking shelter in the fortress became 4,000 armed soldiers; Lithuanians bravely and determinedly defended the fortress but chose death over converting to Christianity and becoming slaves of the Order; Margiris cut his wife in half and then killed himself; the Teutonic soldiers were moved by the terrible sight and noble sacrifice and returned to Prussia without loot. Possibly some of these details were inspired by similar events from the antiquity, including mass suicides in Astapa following the destruction of Illiturgis (206 BC), to &quot;death or victory&quot; defense of Abydos (200 BC), and mass suicide during the desperate siege of Masada ().

It is difficult, if not impossible, to objectively evaluate the events as all that is known about Pilėnai comes from a single source, a German chronicler who saw Lithuanians as heathens and enemies. While there is written evidence about suicides in medieval Lithuania, Pilėnai is the only known instance where a ruler killed his own men.

==Location==

The exact location of Pilėnai is unknown and historians propose many different locations. &quot;Annalista Thorunensis&quot; and Wigand of Marburg mentioned that it was located in Trapėnai land (&quot;terra Troppen&quot;) but its location is also unknown.

Maciej Stryjkowski (1547–1593) identified Punia as the location of Pilėnai (). This opinion, while not based on any historical arguments, spread widely to historical works and was popularized by various works of fiction. Punia hill fort became known as Margiris Hill and in 1973 a monument was erected in memory of Margiris (the monument is inscribed with four lines from a poem by Maironis). The town organizes events to commemorate the events of 1336.

Based on superficial etymological connections, Teodor Narbutt identified Pilėnai with Pilionys (Naujaupis) hill fort in the Kėdainiai District () and Jonas Basanavičius with Piliakalniai hill fort in the Vilkaviškis District (). Zenonas Ivinskis searched for Pilėnai along the lower reaches of the Neman River. He agreed with Kazys Paunksnis and identified Pilėnai with the Pypliai hill fort near the confluence of Nevėžis and Neman ().

Alvydas Nikžentaitis focused on the location of Trapėnai and determined that it was a triangle between Viešvilė, Ančia River (tributary of Šešuvis), and Veliuona. Further, he paid particular attention to &quot;Ycoine&quot; mentioned by Jean d&#x27;Outremeuse in connection with Margiris&#x27; duel with King John of Bohemia in 1329 and identified it with Jūkainiai village in the Raseiniai District. There are five hill forts within a distance from Jūkainiai, including the Molavėnai-Graužai hill fort (). In 1995, Gintautas Zabiela organized a survey of these hill forts and determined that one of them is likely not even a hill fort and other three, including Molavėnai, lacked sufficient cultural layer and archaeological artifacts. An archaeological excavation of Molavėnai outer bailey in 2009 found only a few minor items (fragments of clay pots, pieces of iron, stone grinders) that are dated to the 1st–5th century. Excavation of of the upper bailey produced no artifacts but revealed up to thick layer of clay (cf. earthen floor) used to increase hill fort&#x27;s height which would date it to the second half of the 14th century.

According to Zabiela&#x27;s survey in 1995, the fifth hill fort, Ižiniškiai (), is now severely damaged by erosion and human activities but was a strong hill fort with a large settlement. Zabiela surveyed additional six hill forts in 1996, including Ivangėnai-Karšuva hill fort near Skaudvilė () but concluded that Ižiniškiai remained the most probable location of Pilėnai. Tomas Baranauskas disagreed with Nikžentaitis&#x27; analysis and searched for Pilėnai in the area of five hill forts that, according to Guillaume de Machaut, were captured by the Teutonic campaign to Medvėgalis in 1329. He concluded that Pilėnai stood in Pilės hill fort near Kaltinėnai in Tauragė District (). However, an excavation of area in 1990 produced no artifacts.

Bilionys hill fort in the Šilalė District () was first suggested by German historian Johannes Voigt. This version is supported by Stasys Kasparavičius who noted that Bilionys is sometimes known as Pilionys and is very similar to Pillenen mentioned in written sources. Additionally, Bilionys is located just south of Medvėgalis which was attacked in 1329 and also likely defended by Margiris. Bilionys must have been a large and strong fortress as its upper bailey but there is no mention in written sources that it was attacked while neighboring hill forts were attacked several times. However, etymological connection between Bilionys and Pilėnai is dubious as the toponym Bilionys likely derived from a personal name. Nevertheless, since 2012 Verkiai Regional Park organizes events to commemorate Pilėnai on Bilionys hill fort.

==Cultural significance==

The heroic defense of Pilėnai inspired many artistic works. The events were described by Władysław Syrokomla in his epic poem &quot;Margier&quot; (1855). The 4000-line poem inspired an opera by Konstanty Gorski which premiered in 1927. The poem also prompted novel &quot;Kunigas&quot; (1881) by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski. This novel, in turn, inspired an opera by Marcelinas Šikšnys (1905). In 1933, Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius published a collection of legends from Dainava, including a story about Pilėnai. Maironis and Paulius Širvys composed short poems on the events.

The opera &quot;Pilėnai&quot; was written by the musical composer Vytautas Klova, and the libretto was written by Jonas Mackonis. The opera premiered in 1956, and is often performed in Lithuania. In 2001 the performances took place at the Trakai Island Castle. The Lithuanian Opera Company of Chicago performed the work in 2006 to commemorate its 50th anniversary.

In 2002, there was a proposal to create Duke Margiris state award for defending Lithuanian independence with emphasis on loyalty and sacrifice. It was intended for members of armed and unarmed resistance during the Soviet and Nazi Germany occupations in 1940–90.

==Historiography==
The story of Pilėnai spread from one history book to another, from Simon Grunau, Maciej Stryjkowski, Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz, to Teodor Narbutt, but these are just retellings and embellishments of Wigand&#x27;s original information.

<text>The Card is a comic novel written by Arnold Bennett in 1911 (entitled Denry the Audacious in the American edition). It was later made into a 1952 movie, starring Alec Guinness and Petula Clark.

Like much of Bennett&#x27;s best work, it is set in the Staffordshire Potteries. It chronicles the rise of Edward Henry (&quot;Denry&quot;) Machin from washerwoman&#x27;s son to Mayor of Bursley (a fictitious town based on Burslem). This is accomplished through luck, initiative and a fair bit of cheek (in slang a card is a &#x27;character&#x27;, an &#x27;original&#x27;; a clever, audacious, person).

Denry Machin returned, as the slightly more mature &quot;Edward Henry&quot;, in Bennett&#x27;s sequel &quot;The Regent&quot; (1913) (titled &quot;The Old Adam&quot; in its first US edition).

==Plot==
The novel begins when &quot;Edward Henry Machin first saw the smoke on May 27, 1867&quot;—the very day of Bennett&#x27;s own birth. At age 12, Denry begins his career by altering his marks in a test sufficiently to earn him a scholarship to grammar school. At 16, he leaves school to work for Mr Duncalf, the town clerk and a solicitor. Duncalf is responsible for organising an exclusive ball; Denry &quot;invites&quot; himself, then also a few others in exchange for things he will need, such as lessons from dance instructor Ruth Earp. On a bet, he audaciously asks the energetic, beautiful Countess of Chell to dance. Everyone, including Machin, is in awe of the Countess (apparently based on the real-life Duchess of Sutherland) and he thus earns himself the reputation of a &quot;card&quot; (a &quot;character&quot;, someone able to set tongues wagging) – a reputation he is determined to cement.

Later, when Duncalf treats a disgruntled client brusquely, Denry leaves his employ after persuading the client to hire him as a rent collector. When some of the tenants fall behind, he begins loaning them money (at a highly profitable interest rate). Ruth herself is several months in arrears and tries to sneak away in the middle of the night. Denry catches her by accident, but rather than being angry, he admires her audacity and starts courting her.

While on holiday at the seaside resort town of Llandudno with Ruth and her friend Nellie Cotterill, he witnesses a shipwreck and the rescue of the sailors. Noting the interest generated, he buys a lifeboat, hires some of the stranded mariners as rowers, and conducts tours of the picturesque wreck. However, Ruth&#x27;s spendthrift nature becomes alarmingly apparent during the trip and they break up.

By the end of the summer, Denry has made a substantial profit from the sightseers, which he uses to finance his boldest venture. He starts up the Five Towns Universal Thrift Club. Members deposit money little by little; once they have accumulated half the sum they need to purchase whatever it is they want, the club allows them to buy on credit, but only from stores associated with the club. Denry makes money by getting a discount from the vendors in return for access to his large customer base. When his capital starts to run out, he arranges an &quot;accident&quot; for the Countess&#x27;s coach. He drives conveniently by and gives her a lift to an urgent appointment. On the way there, he talks her into becoming the club&#x27;s sponsor, ensuring easy financing. This proves to be the making of Denry&#x27;s fortune.

With his great success, he is appointed a town councillor. He also backs a new daily newspaper (to be bought out at a profit by its established rival anxious to keep its monopoly) and tricks his obstinate mother into moving into a luxurious new house. At this point, Ruth reappears in Denry&#x27;s life, now the widow of a rich older man. He considers renewing their relationship, but at the last moment, realises that Nellie is the one for him and marries her.

The crowning achievement comes when Denry decides to become the youngest mayor in the history of Bursley. To sway the voters, he purchases the rights to footballer and native son Callear, the &quot;greatest centre forward in England&quot;, for the failing Bursley football club.

His antics are regarded with affection and admiration by most others, as shown by the book&#x27;s final exchange:
&quot;What a card!&quot; said one, laughing joyously. &quot;He&#x27;s a rare &#x27;un, no mistake.&quot;

&quot;Of course, this&#x27;ll make him more popular than ever,&quot; said another. &quot;We&#x27;ve never had a man to touch him for that.&quot;

&quot;And yet,&quot; demanded Councillor Barlow, &quot;what&#x27;s he done? Has he ever done a day&#x27;s work in his life? What great cause is he identified with?&quot;

&quot;He&#x27;s identified,&quot; said the speaker, &quot;with the great cause of cheering us all up.&quot;
==Adaptations==
A film of the novel, &quot;The Card&quot; (retitled &quot;The Promoter&quot; for American audiences), adapted by Eric Ambler and directed by Ronald Neame, was released in 1952. It starred Alec Guinness as Denry Machin, Petula Clark as Nellie Cotterill, Valerie Hobson as the Countess, and Glynis Johns as Ruth Earp. The movie was mostly faithful to the novel, though it omitted the newspaper caper, Denry outmanoeuvring his mother into moving, and a few other minor misadventures. 
In 1973, the married songwriting team of Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent composed the score for a musical stage version of the same name in London&#x27;s West End. (The pair wrote a considerable number of Clark&#x27;s pop hits in the 1960s and &#x27;70s.) Although not a huge success, an original cast album was released, and one of the show&#x27;s tunes, &quot;Nothing Succeeds Like Success&quot;, was recorded by Clark as one of her album tracks.

In 1974 Olivia Manning adapted &quot;The Card&quot; and another of Bennett&#x27;s works featuring Denry, &quot;The Regent&quot; (1913) into an eight part BBC Radio play: &quot;Denry - The Adventures Of A Card&quot;. Graham Armitage portrayed Denry and Ursula O&#x27;Leary the Countess of Chell.

In 2007, it was once again adapted as a two-part play for BBC Radio 4. Again, the adaptation was faithful to the novel, with the omission of the newspaper incident.

In 2023, the novel was adapted by Deborah McAndrew into a play. Directed by Conrad Nelson and performed by the Claybody Theatre, the play opened in Fenton, one of Stoke-on-Trent&#x27;s six towns. The production later moved to Newcastle-under-Lyme&#x27;s New Vic Theatre.

<text>The Buddhist calendar is a set of lunisolar calendars primarily used in Tibet, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam as well as in Malaysia and Singapore and by Chinese populations for religious or official occasions. While the calendars share a common lineage, they also have minor but important variations such as intercalation schedules, month names and numbering, use of cycles, etc. In Thailand, the name Buddhist Era is a year numbering system shared by the traditional Thai lunar calendar and by the Thai solar calendar.

The Southeast Asian lunisolar calendars are largely based on an older version of the Hindu calendar, which uses the sidereal year as the solar year. One major difference is that the Southeast Asian systems, unlike their Indian cousins, do not use apparent reckoning to stay in sync with the sidereal year. Instead, they employ their versions of the Metonic cycle. However, since the Metonic cycle is not very accurate for sidereal years, the Southeast Asian calendar is slowly drifting out of sync with the sidereal, approximately one day every 100 years. Yet no coordinated structural reforms of the lunisolar calendar have been undertaken.

Today, the traditional Buddhist lunisolar calendar is used mainly for Theravada Buddhist festivals. The Thai Buddhist Era, a renumbered Gregorian calendar, is the official calendar in Thailand.

==Structure==

The calculation methodology of the current versions of Southeast Asian Buddhist calendars is largely based on that of the Burmese calendar, which was in use in various Southeast Asian kingdoms down to the 19th century under the names of Chula Sakarat and Jolak Sakaraj. The Burmese calendar in turn was based on the &quot;original&quot; &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; system of ancient India (believed to be Ardharatrika school). One key difference with Indian systems is that the Burmese system has followed a variation of the Metonic cycle. It is unclear from where, when or how the Metonic system was introduced; hypotheses range from China to Europe. The Burmese system, and indeed the Southeast Asian systems, thus use a &quot;strange&quot; combination of sidereal years from the Indian calendar in combination with the Metonic cycle better for tropical years.

===Epochal date===
In all Theravada traditions,the calendar&#x27;s epochal year 0 date was the day in which the Buddha attained &quot;parinibbāna&quot;. However, not all traditions agree on when it actually took place. In Burmese Buddhist tradition, it was 13 May 554 BCE (Tuesday, Full moon of Kason 148 Anjanasakaraj). But in Thai Buddhist tradition, it was 11 March 545 BCE, the date which the current Thai lunisolar and solar calendars use as the epochal date. Yet, the Thai calendars for some reason have fixed the difference between their Buddhist Era (BE) numbering and the Christian/Common Era (CE) numbering at 543, which points to an epochal year of 544 BCE, not 545 BCE. In Myanmar, the difference between BE and CE can be 543 or 544 for CE dates, and 544 or 543 for BCE dates, depending on the month of the Buddhist Era (as the Buddhist calendar straddles the Gregorian calendar—currently from April to April).

===Month===

====Types====
The calendar recognizes two types of months: synodic month and sidereal month. The Synodic months are used to compose the years while the 27 lunar sidereal days (Sanskrit: &quot;nakshatra&quot;), alongside the 12 signs of the zodiac, are used for astrological calculations. (The Burmese calendar also recognizes a solar month called &quot;Thuriya Matha&quot;, which is defined as 1/12th of a year. But the solar month varies by the type of year such as tropical year, sidereal year, etc.)

====Waxing and waning====
The days of the month are counted in two halves, waxing and waning. The 15th of the waxing is the civil full moon day. The civil new moon day is the last day of the month (14th or 15th waning). Because of the inaccuracy of the calendrical calculation systems, the mean and real (true) New Moons rarely coincide. The mean New Moon often precedes the real New Moon.

====Number of days per month====
As the Synodic lunar month is approximately 29.5 days, the calendar uses alternating months of 29 and 30 days.

====Month numbering====
Various regional versions of Chula Sakarat/Burmese calendar existed across various regions of mainland Southeast Asia. Unlike Burmese systems, Kengtung, Sipsongpanna, Lan Na, Lan Xang and Sukhothai systems refer to the months by numbers, not by names. This means reading ancient texts and inscriptions in Thailand requires constant vigilance, not just in making sure one is correctly operating for the correct region, but also for variations within regions itself when incursions cause a variation in practice.

===Year===
The Buddhist calendar is a lunisolar calendar in which the months are based on lunar months and years are based on solar years. One of its primary objectives is to synchronize the lunar part with the solar part. The lunar months, normally twelve of them, consist alternately of 29 days and 30 days, such that a normal lunar year will contain 354 days, as opposed to the solar year of ~365.25 days. Therefore, some form of addition to the lunar year (of intercalation) is necessary. The overall basis for it is provided by cycles of 57 years. Eleven extra days are inserted in every 57 years, and seven extra months of 30 days are inserted in every 19 years (21 months in 57 years). This provides 20819 complete days to both calendars. This 57-year cycle would provide a mean year of about 365.2456 days and a mean month of about 29.530496 days, if not corrected.

As such, the calendar adds an intercalary month in leap years and sometimes also an intercalary day in great leap years. The intercalary month not only corrects the length of the year but also corrects the accumulating error of the month to extent of half a day. The average length of the month is further corrected by adding a day to Nayon at irregular intervals—a little more than seven times in two cycles (39 years). The intercalary day is never inserted except in a year which has an intercalary month. The Hindu calendar inserts an intercalary month at any time of year as soon as the accumulated fractions amount to one month. The Burmese calendar however always inserts the intercalary month at the same time of the year, after the summer solstice while the Arakanese calendar inserts it after the vernal equinox.

====Burmese====
The Burmese calendar year consists of 354, 384 or 385 days.

Note: The Arakanese calendar adds the intercalary day in Tagu, not in Nayon.

====Cambodian, Lao and Thai====
The Cambodian, Lao and Thai lunisolar calendars use a slightly different method to place the intercalary day. Instead of it in a leap year as in the Burmese system, the Thai system places it in a separate year. Thus, the Thai small leap year has 355 days while the Thai great leap year has 384 days.

===New Year&#x27;s Day===
Since the main purpose of Buddhist calendar is to keep pace with the solar year, the new year is always marked by the solar year, which falls at the time when the Sun enters Aries. The date, which at the present falls on the 17th of April, has slowly drifted over the centuries. In the 20th century, the New Year&#x27;s Day fell on April 15 or 16th but in the 17th century, it fell on April 9 or 10th. Thailand and Cambodia no longer use the traditional lunisolar calendar to mark the New Year&#x27;s Day.

===Cycle===
The Cambodian, Lao and Thai systems give animal names to the years from a cycle of 12. The practice also existed in Burma in the Pagan period but later died out.

The Cambodian calendar also maintains a 10-year naming cycle (numbered one to ten). Cambodians use multiple systems to identify a given year. For instance, 2017 is identified as 2561 Buddhist Era, the year of Rooster, Nuppasak (Year 9). The Thai lunar calendar also uses a similar numbered 10-year cycle. Each number in the cycle corresponds to the last digit of the year in the &quot;Chula Sakarat&quot; calendar.

==Accuracy==

The Southeast Asian Buddhist calendars use lunar months but try to keep pace with the solar year, by inserting intercalary months and days on the Metonic cycle (in the case of the Burmese calendar, on a modified Metonic cycle). However, the solar year as defined by the Buddhist calendars is really a sidereal year, which is nearly 24 minutes longer than the actual mean tropical year. Therefore, like all sidereal-based calendars, the lunisolar calendars are slowly drifting away from the seasons. The calendars are drifting one day approximately every 60 years and 4 months.

The accumulating drift against the seasons means the New Year&#x27;s Day which used to fall on 22 March (near the vernal equinox) in 638 CE now falls on 17 April in 2013 CE. There is no known internationally concerted effort to stop this drift. Thailand has moved its &quot;Buddhist Era&quot; to the Gregorian calendar under the name of Thai solar calendar. In Myanmar, Burmese calendarists have tried to deal with the issue by periodically modifying the intercalation schedule in the Metonic cycle. One major downside of this approach is that it is not possible to publish future calendars more than a few years (often even a year) ahead.

==History==
The Buddhist Era was first introduced to Southeast Asia along with Buddhism in the early centuries CE. It was not a separate calendar but simply a year numbering system that employed the organization and calculation methods of the prevailing lunisolar calendars in use throughout the region. In the early centuries CE, the reference civil calendar of the Buddhist calendar prevalent in Southeast Asia was the Saka Era (Mahāsakaraj Era), which is said to have been adopted by the Pyu state of Sri Ksetra in 80 CE. The Saka Era was gradually replaced by the Burmese Era or Culāsakaraj, first in Myanmar in 640 CE, and in other Theravada kingdoms of Southeast Asia between the 13th and 16th centuries. Theravada Buddhist tradition also recognizes pre-Buddhist Anjana Sakaraj (Añjana&#x27;s Era) since the events of the Buddha&#x27;s life are recorded in that era.

The tradition of using different reference calendars continued in Siam in 1912 when King Vajiravudh decreed that the Buddhist Era would now track the Thai solar calendar, the Siamese version of the Gregorian calendar with the New Year&#x27;s Day of 1 April. Therefore, the Thai Buddhist Era year of 2455 began on 1 April 1912 (as opposed to 15 April 1912 according to the lunisolar calendar). The Thai Buddhist Era was further realigned to the Gregorian calendar on 6 September 1940 when Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram decreed 1 January 1941 as the start of the year 2484 BE. As a result, the Year 2483 was only 9 months long, and the Thai Buddhist Era equals that of the Common Era plus 543 years.

==Current usage==
The lunisolar calendar is used to mark important Buddhist holidays. Many of the holidays are celebrated as public holidays.

==Computer support==
The Thai-style &quot;Buddhist calendar&quot;, which is the Gregorian calendar with the Buddhist era, is supported in Java 8, iOS, and macOS.

<doc id="1227392" wikidata="Q1811379" url="?curid=1227392" title="Protected areas of Romania">
<text>This is a list of protected areas of [[Romania]].

About 5.18% of the area of Romania has a protected status (12,360 km2), including the Danube Delta, which makes half of these areas (2.43% of Romania&#x27;s area).

==National parks==
There are 14 national parks totaling 3,223 km2:


===Proposed hunting===
The Romanian parliament discussed in September 2008 a bill aiming to open 13 national parks to sustainable hunting, in order to manage the wildlife biodiversity in these areas and promote greater tourism and the accompanying revenue necessary to support and maintain the parks. However, after several protests from environmental organizations, the law was rejected by President Traian Băsescu. Nowadays, hunting is prohibited in national parks of Romania.

==Natural parks==
There are 17 natural parks totaling 5,492.33 km2:

==Natural reserves==
Natural reserves are natural areas protected by law in order to protect and conserve important habitats and natural species. The dimensions of natural reserves vary and depend on the area needed by protected natural elements. Besides scientific activities, the administrations of natural reserves encourage traditional activities and ecotourism that do not affect the natural landscape. Here is not permitted to use natural resources.

There are 617 natural reservations totaling 2,043.55 km2.

==Scientific reserves==
Scientific reserves are also protected areas that, like the previous ones, aim at protection and preservation of natural habitats. The difference is that scientific reserves can not be visited by tourists. These areas typically contain rare plant and animal species or particular natural elements, reason why here are prohibited any human activities, excepting research and education activities. Entry without permission in scientific reserves is punishable by considerable fines.

There are 55 such reservations totaling 1,112.77 km2.

==Natural monuments==
There are 234 natural monuments totaling 77.05 km2.

<doc id="1227393" wikidata="Q864959" url="?curid=1227393" title="Bir Hakeim">
<text>Bir Hakeim (, , sometimes written &quot;Bir Hacheim&quot;) is the site of a former Ottoman fort in the Libyan desert. The fort was built around the site of an ancient Roman well, dating to the period when the oasis was part of Ottoman Tripolitania. It is about west of Sollum on the Libyan coast and south-east of Gazala. Bir Hakeim is best known for the battle of Bir Hakeim, which took place there during World War II.

The battle occurred during the Battle of Gazala (26 May – 21 June 1942) when the 1st Free French Brigade of &quot;Général de brigade&quot;, future Maréchal de France Marie-Pierre Kœnig defended the site from against much larger German and Italian forces, commanded by &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Erwin Rommel.

Capitaine Pierre Messmer was one of the French officers of the 13th half-brigade of the French Foreign Legion. Messmer had graduated from St Cyr Military School. He was commanding the 3rd battalion of the Legion. Plenty of his soldiers were from Spanish and German origin, and many of them Jews. The Kaddish was said most evenings at Bir-Hakeim. The other half-brigade of the 1st Free French Division included units that did not belong to the French Foreign Legion, like the Bataillon de Marche n°2 de l&#x27;Afrique équatoriale française (BM2), the Bataillon du Pacifique (French Polynesia, New Caledonia and New Hebrides), the 1st Bataillon of Infanterie de Marine, the 1st Regiment of Artillerie, the 1st Bataillon of Fusiliers Marins in association with the troop D of the 43rd Battery of the 11th City of London Yeomanry Regiment, and the 22nd North-African French Armored Company.

Pierre Messmer was the first French Foreign Legion soldier to be elected to the Académie Française. He would later become Prime Minister of the French Republic under President Georges Pompidou.

During these 14 days, 3700 French soldiers immobilized 40 000 Axis soldiers. Out of these 3700, 800 died or went missing. This half-brigade had already fought the German Army at Narvik on 27 May 1940. 

Although the Afrika Corps captured Tobruk ten days later, the delay imposed on the Axis offensive by the defence of Bir Hakeim influenced the cancellation of Operation Herkules, the planned German invasion of the Suez Canal and Malta. The stand by the Free French gave the defeated and retreating British Eighth Army enough time to recover from its heavy losses, and to reorganize. The British then stopped the German advance at the First Battle of El Alamein. The Algerian and Moroccan units of the 1st Free French Division gave birth to the French Expeditionary Corps under the command of Général Alphonse Juin, future Maréchal de France, and Général Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert. They were also instrumental in the Battle of Monte Cassino. There, the 3rd Division d&#x27;Infanterie Algérienne (3rd DIA), and the Groupement des Tabors Marocains of Général Augustin Guillaume were recognized in breaking through the German defences of the Gustav Line.

This battle would serve as the namesake for Bir-Hakeim (Paris Métro), a station on the Paris Métro, and Pont de Bir-Hakeim, a bridge.

Bir Hakeim was also the site of a daring rescue during World War I. On 14 March 1916, Major Hugh Grosvenor led an armoured car squadron, part of the Western Frontier Force, to Bir Hakeim after having traveled 120 miles across the desert from Sollum. There they rescued 91 British POWs from HMS &quot;Tara&quot; and HMT &quot;Moorina&quot;. German U-boats had captured the British sailors after torpedoing their vessels and had turned their prisoners over to the local Senussi, who were allied with the Germans.

As a result of the Italo-Turkish War (1911-1912), Italy captured the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (province), which became known as Italian Libya. The Italian army stationed a unit of its Zaptié Meharista at Bir Hakeim.

<doc id="1227394" wikidata="Q764525" url="?curid=1227394" title="Nyctanthes arbor-tristis">
<text>Nyctanthes arbor-tristis is a species of &quot;Nyctanthes&quot; native to South Asia and Southeast Asia. It is commonly known as night-blooming jasmine, tree of sadness, tree of sorrow, hengra bubar, coral jasmine, as seri gading in Singapore and as shiuli in the Bengal region. Despite its common name, the species is not a &quot;true jasmine&quot; and not of the genus Jasminum. 

==Names==

The tree is called the &quot;tree of sorrow&quot; because the foliage becomes droopy as blooming flowers fall off during early morning. The Latin specific epithet &quot;arbor-tristis&quot; means &quot;sad tree&quot;. In India and Nepal, &quot;Nyctanthes arbor-tristis&quot; is known as pārijāta (पारिजात). In other Indian languages, it is known as &quot;harsinghar&quot; (Hindi), &quot;sephalika&quot; (Sanskrit), &quot;shiuli/shephali&quot; (Bengali), &quot;pavalamallikai&quot; (Tamil), &quot;prajakta&quot; (Marathi), &quot;parijaata&quot; (Kannada), &quot;pavizhamalli&quot; (Malayalam), and &quot;siharu&quot;. In Malaysia it is known as seri gading and in China it is referred to as nai hua or hung mo li.

== Description ==
&quot;Nyctanthes arbor-tristis&quot; is a shrub or a small tree growing to tall, with flaky grey bark. The leaves are opposite, simple, long and broad, with an entire margin. The flowers are fragrant, with a five- to eight-lobed white corolla with an orange-red centre; they are produced in clusters of two to seven together, with individual flowers opening at dusk and finishing at dawn. The fruit is a bilobed, flat brown heart-shaped to round capsule diameter, each lobe containing a single seed.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;N. arbor-tristis&quot; is native to Indo-China, Himalaya and Sumatera to Jawa. It grows in dry deciduous forests and hillsides.

==Uses==
The leaves have been used in Ayurvedic medicine and Homoeopathy for sciatica, arthritis, and fevers, and as a laxative. An orange dye from the corolla, nyctanthin, is used to dye silk. In India, flowers are used to make garlands and used for worship. 

== Culture ==
The flower of &quot;Nyctanthes arbor-tristis&quot; is the official state flower of West Bengal and is called shiuli or shephali in Bengali. The &quot;shiuli&quot; flowers bloom during the autumn season in Bengal and are offered to goddess Durga on the festival of Durga Puja. The flowers are associated with the autumn season and Durga Puja in Bengal. Many Durga puja songs and poems have mentions of this flower.

The native people of Tripura use the plant to help predict weather and rainfall.

== Literature ==

The &quot;parijata&quot; is a divine tree featured in Hindu history. The Mahabharata and the Puranas describe the &quot;parijata&quot; tree, as one of five trees, to have emerged during the legend of the Samudra Manthana. Krishna is described to have battled with Indra to uproot the &quot;parijata&quot; from his capital of Amaravati and plant it in his own city of Dvaraka. In regional tradition, Satyabhama grew aggrieved when Krishna offered his chief consort Rukmini a parijata flower. To placate her envy, Krishna confronted Indra and had the &quot;parijata&quot; tree planted near Satyabhama&#x27;s door. Despite having the tree planted near her dwelling, the flowers of the tree fell in the adjacent backyard of Rukmini, the favourite wife of Krishna, because of her superior devotion and humility.

The tree is the subject of a work named &quot;Parijatapaharanamu&quot; in Telugu literature, written by Nandi Thimmana, the court-poet of Krishnadevaraya. The poet Kalidasa sings about the flower in his Sanskrit poem &quot;Ritu samhara&quot;.

<text>Stig Fredrik Strömholm (born 16 September 1931), Swedish, former rector magnificus of Uppsala University and past president of Academia Europaea.

==Early life and education==
Strömholm was born on 16 September 1931 in Boden, Sweden, the son of Major Fredrik Strömholm, and his wife Gerda (née Janson). He was the brother of diplomat Sten Strömholm and the half-brother of photographer Christer Strömholm. In 1934, when Strömholm was three years old, his father died by suicide, reportedly due to chronic headaches caused by a riding accident many years earlier.

Strömholm passed &quot;studentexamen&quot; in 1949 and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Uppsala University in 1952. He completed his reserve officer training in 1954, earned his Candidate of Law degree in 1957, and his Licentiate of Law degree in 1960. He obtained his Doctor of Law degree from Uppsala University in 1966. In 1959, he completed a Diploma in Comparative Legal Studies at Cambridge University and earned his Doctorate in Law from the University of Munich in 1964.

==Career==
Strömholm served as a judicial clerk in the Uppsala County judicial district (&quot;Uppsala läns domsaga&quot;) from 1958 to 1960, as a fiscal officer at the Svea Court of Appeal from 1961 to 1966, and as an associate professor in comparative law at Uppsala University starting in 1966. He also held a research position in comparative law and was a state advisor for social research.

Strömholm was Professor in Jurisprudence in Uppsala from 1969, and Professor in Private Law and Conflict of Laws there 1982–1997. After an appointment as prorector (deputy vice-chancellor) of Uppsala University 1978–1989, he was rector magnificus (vice-chancellor) of the university 1989–1997.

On his retirement from the rectorial chair in 1997, he received a Festschrift, &quot;Festskrift till Stig Strömholm&quot; (Uppsala 1997), in two volumes and 925 pages, including a partial bibliography ().

==Personal life==
In 1958, Strömholm married Gunilla Forslund (1935–2013), the daughter of director Johan Forslund and Betty Forssell. They had two children: Christina (born 1962) and Fredrik (born 1965).

<doc id="1227401" wikidata="Q5226086" url="?curid=1227401" title="Darwood Kaye">
<text>Darwood Kenneth Smith (September 8, 1929 – May 15, 2002), also known as Darwood Kaye, was an American child actor most notable for his semi-regular role as the bookish rich kid Waldo in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects series from 1937 to 1940. As an adult, Smith became a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, ministering at several churches until his death in 2002.

Kaye was discovered in 1935 while his family was on vacation in Hollywood, California; he was asked to come to the studios for a screen test, and made some uncredited appearances in films in 1936.

==&quot;Our Gang&quot;==
Kaye had a small role in Hal Roach&#x27;s 1937 &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedy &quot;Glove Taps&quot;. His first speaking part was in &quot;Hearts Are Thumps&quot;, released the same year. In most of his &quot;Our Gang&quot; appearances, Kaye portrayed &quot;Waldo&quot;, a rich kid with an officious, studious nature who competed with schoolmates &quot;Alfalfa&quot; Switzer and &quot;Butch&quot; Bond for the affections of little Darla Hood.

Kaye appeared with other &quot;Our Gang&quot; cast members in live performances in the early 1940s. A 1940 &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; article about the &quot;Our Gang&quot; cast said that Kaye and another cast member &quot;display the most essential characteristics of actors in that neither is affected by the constantly unsympathetic roles they must play. Darwood is easily recognizable as a &#x27;regular guy&#x27; in any juvenile company and conducts himself with good manners and lack of effrontery which distinguish him from Waldo.&quot; According to &quot;Variety&quot;, he and Switzer performed &quot;an eccentric tap routine which registered well for nice laughs and applause&quot; in San Antonio in late December 1940.

Kaye remained a semi-regular in &quot;Our Gang&quot; through 1940, by which time production of the series had moved from the Hal Roach studio to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He appeared in a total of 21 &quot;Our Gang&quot; films. After leaving the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series Kaye appeared as &quot;Waldo&quot; in &quot;Barnyard Follies&quot; at Republic Pictures in late 1940. Minor roles in other films included the musical &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot; (1943) and &quot;Kansas City Kitty&quot; (1944); in both he played &quot;Killer&quot;.

==Pastor Smith==
After serving in the U.S. Army for a year and a half, Smith attended La Sierra University, a Seventh-day Adventist college in Riverside, California. He married another student attending La Sierra, Jean Venden, in June 1951, with whom he had four sons: Dan, David, Richard, and Donald.

Smith became a minister in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, ministering at churches in the nearby cities of San Diego, Palm Springs, Escondido, Santa Maria, Oceanside. and in northern California at the Saint Helena SDA church.

In 1957, the Smiths moved to Siam (present day Thailand), where Darwood, now known as Pastor Ken Smith, did missionary work. Three years later, the couple&#x27;s fourth son, Donald, was born in Bangkok. The Smiths remained in Thailand for fourteen years before going back to the U.S. permanently. Smith continued his clerical career, ministering in several Southern California churches and supervising missionary work.

==Death and legacy==
On May 15, 2002, Smith was severely injured in a hit and run crash on Arlington Avenue in Riverside, California. He died later that evening at Riverside Community Hospital, surrounded by his family. He was buried at the Crestlawn Memorial Park in Riverside.

His son David wrote the biography &quot;Finding Waldo: From Little Rascal to Adventist Pastor by Darwood Kaye&quot; (Pacific Press, 2009).

<doc id="1227404" wikidata="Q1346874" url="?curid=1227404" title="Kevin Godley">
<text>Kevin Michael Godley (born 7 October 1945) is an English singer-songwriter, drummer and music video director. He was a singer and drummer of the art rock band 10cc and later was part of collaboration duo Godley &amp; Creme with Lol Creme.

== Early life ==
Kevin Michael Godley was born on 7 October 1945 in Prestwich, Lancashire, England, to a Jewish family, and went to North Cestrian Grammar School in Altrincham. 

While attending art college in Manchester Godley met future creative partner Lol Creme. Godley and Creme joined the R&amp;B combo the Sabres.
== 10cc and Godley &amp; Creme ==
They became involved in a number of bands such as the Mockingbirds, Hotlegs and later 10cc. As part of the bands Godley was a songwriter, lead vocalist, played drums, percussion and keyboards. Godley and Creme recorded four studio albums with 10cc. In 1977, early in the recording of the band&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Deceptive Bends&quot;, unimpressed with the songs by bandmates Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman and eager to work on other projects outside of the band, Godley and Creme left.

In 1977, they released their first album project – &quot;Consequences&quot; – a concept album demonstration piece for the &quot;Gizmo&quot; a device that enabled an electric guitar to mimic orchestral instruments the pair had begun developing early on in the 10cc years. &quot;Consequences&quot; is a story about meek Walter Stapleton divorcing his French playgirl wife, with English comedian and satirist Peter Cook voicing the parts of two solicitors, the irascible Pepperman and the alcoholic Haig, and Haig&#x27;s downstairs resident and reclusive musician Mr Blint, who constantly interrupts them and confuses the proceedings, and singer Sarah Vaughan. The album was released as a three-LP box set. 

&quot;Consequences&quot; attained a niche following and had one single released from it, &quot;Five O&#x27;clock in the Morning&quot;. However, despite the creativity, innovation and imagination involved, it was a commercial flop. 
Both Godley and Creme briefly &#x27;reunited&#x27; with their former 10cc bandmates Stewart and Gouldman on the band&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;...Meanwhile&quot; (1992). Following &quot;...Meanwhile&quot;, Godley and Creme went their separate ways again, having experienced difficulties together as early as 1988.

In 2025, Godley reunited with Graham Gouldman for a special performance as 10cc for an edition of &quot;BBC Radio 2&#x27;s Piano Room&quot; with the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Anne Dudley. Three songs were performed including I&#x27;m Not In Love, new composition I Don&#x27;t Want To Go To Heaven and a cover version of All I Have To Do Is Dream.

== Later work ==
Godley later again reunited with Gouldman to form the band GG/06. Together they recorded a self-titled extended play (EP), which was made available for free via their website. Since then Godley has several times joined Gouldman&#x27;s iteration of 10cc in concert, and was featured on the live and video album &quot;Clever Clogs&quot; (2008).

More recently, Godley moved into developing a music platform for the iPad, one that combines audio and video to create a global recording studio in the cloud called &quot;WholeWorldBand&quot;. The company was nominated for the SXSW Music Accelerator Award in 2013, and was one of eight finalists selected from a pool of over 500.

In 2017, Godley publicly invited musicians to send him music to work on his debut solo studio album, titled &quot;Muscle Memory&quot; with the idea being that he would take the rough ideas and turn them into a finished song. The album was originally supposed to be released in 2018 through campaign on pledgemusic.com, but due to its closure the release was postponed. In 2021, Kevin Godley&#x27;s album &quot;Muscle Memory&quot; was completed and released by The state51 Conspiracy after the project stalled as a PledgeMusic campaign.

In 2018, Godley was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Arts by Staffordshire University. In 2021, Godley joined &quot;Group of Humans&quot;, a globally distributed community of creative leaders and change architects, as Creative Director. He currently lives and works in Wicklow, Ireland with his wife Sue, and hopes to direct a film based on Orson Welles&#x27; time in Ireland.

<text>Illinois Route 22, also known as Half Day Road for part of its length, is an east–west state highway in northeastern Illinois. It runs from U.S. Route 14 (Northwest Highway) in Fox River Grove to U.S. Route 41 (Skokie Highway) in Highland Park. It travels a distance of and is one of the few roads that runs almost entirely across southern Lake County while also providing access to southeastern McHenry County. Throughout its length, it shifts between two and four lanes as it passes through a frequently changing setting of scenic forestry and smaller populations, as well as busy intersections and larger developments.

It originally started as a massive loop around the Chicago area, however it has retained its current, much shorter route ever since 1937. During the 1990s, it became the subject of much concern for local residents regarding expansion which slowed capacity expansion. By the late 2000s, the delays have come and gone and it has emerged as a state route that has been built to deal with heavy traffic.

==Route description==
Beginning at its western terminus at a commercially developed intersection with U.S. Route 14 (Northwest Highway), Illinois 22 starts out as a two lane road in Fox River
Grove, just inside the McHenry County line. It quickly becomes much more rural as it enters the city of Lake
Barrington and Lake County about a half mile east. The Advocate Good Shepherd Hospital and Stonehenge Golf Club on the north side are all that lie in this wooded area of sporadic residential development. Heading into North Barrington, the road continues its journey as it crosses paths with Illinois Route 59 (Hough Street) until soon after, when it nears the more densely populated area of
Lake Zurich.

It becomes a four lane road as it approaches commercial development and the busy intersection of U.S. Route 12 (Rand Road). Shortly after, it proceeds to
briefly take a northeast direction while it bypasses the narrow, downtown area of Lake Zurich, including a grade separation at the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway (EJ&amp;E). Returning due east, the road
travels through a mix of light industrial and commercial developments to the north, and residential to the south before intersecting with Quentin Road. This is where, for a short distance, Illinois 22 runs past the southern edge of Forest Lake on the north side and heads into Kildeer which is largely on the south side. This all takes place while it narrows back down to two lanes near two housing developments and returns to a rural setting with light forestry. The road then passes by the Kemper Lakes Business Center, Kemper Lakes Golf Club, and the Egret Marsh and then enters Long Grove. Soon after passing a
mixed-use development on the northwest corner at an intersection with Old McHenry Road, it briefly enters a denser forest area before widening back to four lanes while again passing by
residential developments.

After a major intersection with Illinois Route 83, the route takes on the name Half Day Road and enters Buffalo Grove. It passes by more neighborhoods, a shopping plaza on the northeast corner of Buffalo Grove Road, the Arboretum Club, and the Prairie View Metra Station next to the at-grade North Central Service tracks. The road then enters
Lincolnshire and heads nearby the Stevenson High School and an office complex before intersecting with
Illinois Route 21/U.S. Route 45 (Milwaukee Avenue), with northwest corner containing a gas station, the northeast a grocery store, and the other two being undeveloped. It then travels by Crane&#x27;s Landing Golf Course, near the Half Day and Wright Woods Forest Preserves, and goes over the Des Plaines River as it once again encounters a wooded area which surrounds nearby homes. Soon the road intersects and forms a diamond interchange with Interstate 94 (Tri-State Tollway); many
office complexes and corporate buildings, such as Hewitt Associates, are located nearby.

On the east side of the interchange, Illinois 22 enters Bannockburn as it passes near Trinity International University as well as some upper class real estate areas. The road next approaches the at-grade Milwaukee District/North Line tracks and major junction with Illinois Route 43 (Waukegan Road) while passing a shopping area on the southeast corner of that intersection. It then arrives in the last city on its journey, Highland Park, where it heads near the Prairie Wolf Slough Forest Preserve. Shortly after, it nears its end as it goes under the grade separated Union Pacific/North Line tracks and a pedestrian crossing before terminating at the well traveled, at-grade intersection of U.S. Route 41 (Skokie Highway);
Half Day Road continues east without a state route designation.

== History ==

===Early history===
Half Day Road takes its name from Aptakisic, a local Potawatomi chief who allied himself with White settlers in the area. The chief&#x27;s name meant &quot;sun at the meridian&quot; or &quot;half day&quot;. After his removal to the vicinity of Elmont, Kansas after the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, settlers applied his name first to an inn, then to the unincorporated town of Half Day, and finally to the road passing through the town. A widespread local legend states that prior to the 1900s, it supposedly took a half day to travel from the area to Chicago, and that this is the source of the name; however, this story has no support in the historical record.

In 1918, State Bond Issue (SBI) Route 22 started off as an outer beltway around the Chicago area, similar to the shape of Interstate 294. It was even referred to in Illinois road maps, as early as 1931, as the &quot;22 Loop&quot;. In those days, it traveled in a &quot;C&quot; formation from the city of Lake Forest to Crystal Lake to Aurora to Joliet, and then east to the border near Indiana. If it took the same path today, it would travel the routes of U.S. 41, modern Illinois 22, U.S. 14, Illinois 31, and U.S. 30. By 1935 it had largely been changed to its current route, except for a small section extending east of U.S. 41.

===Recent history===

Until the early 2000s and despite heavy traffic, Illinois 22 generally remained a two lane road. The only sections that were four lanes were the intersections of Illinois 83, Buffalo Grove Road, Milwaukee Avenue, Interstate 94, Illinois 43, and U.S. 41. The lengthy two lane gaps in between those intersections, as well as the rest of Illinois 22 were heavily discussed for expansion starting in the early 1990s. These discussions included plans that called for additional lanes on its entire length from U.S. 14 to U.S. 41, including widening a section from U.S. 12 to Milwaukee Avenue to six lanes. Also mentioned was a bypass around the narrow, downtown area of Lake Zurich.

It became apparent that a major hold up with these projects was the citizens and local officials of Lincolnshire. Going back to 1971, the section of road from Illinois 83 to Interstate 94 had been known to be opposed for widening by the residents of Lincolnshire. The dispute continued even after funding was secured for the project. This continued until 2002 when an agreement was finally reached between Lincolnshire and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) that led the way for expansion to proceed. Notice was also given around then that plans to widen Illinois 22 west of U.S. 12, through North Barrington and Lake Barrington had been dropped. In December 2003, the $12.5 million of roadwork which consisted of approximately 1.5 miles of widened concrete lanes from west of Interstate 94 to east of Milwaukee Avenue was officially over and the lanes were opened to traffic.

In 1994, the Lake Zurich Village Board approved a bypass around its narrow downtown. This project followed a similar time frame as the Lincolnshire work, however, it was met with a much less intense opposition. The entire process of planning through securing funding was complete by 2003 when state budget cutbacks delayed construction by a year. Construction was completed by 2006, and on October 20, 2006, Illinois 22 was rerouted from Main Street onto the four lane $27 million bypass around Lake Zurich. Several homes and business were removed for the new roadway, which now featured a grade separation at the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway. By the end of 2006, all surrounding major roadwork had been completed; with landscaping continuing into 2007. After years of delay, the entire project was complete, with four concrete lanes from west of U.S. 12 to east of Quentin Road. This included intersection expansions along the way, highlighted by the five lane approaches with dual left turn lanes in both directions at Quentin Road.

An additional three-mile section of Illinois 22 from Illinois 83 to Milwaukee Avenue, primarily located in Buffalo Grove, was another closely related project that was once again met with similar delays and concerns. Long Grove got on board in May 2005 and approved any widening between its eastern city limits and Illinois 83. Roadwork began in the fall on the two-year project, and in September 2007 it was finished; complete with four concrete lanes and a center grassy median. Again, intersection expansions were also made, this time adding dual left turn lanes to both east–west approaches at Illinois 83 and Buffalo Grove Road.

There was one final widening project that was worked on in 2005, this time located mostly in Bannockburn. East of Illinois 43 for about a half mile, Illinois 22 was widened to four lanes while in the process a nearby bridge was replaced.

Beginning in 2008, a bridge replacement and expansion project got underway on Illinois 22 at the interchange with Interstate 94. This was necessary for the tollway which travels underneath to be widened to eight lanes. The old bridge, which was five lanes wide, was rebuilt with one that is eight lanes and includes full length dual left turn lanes in both directions. The bulk of the work was completed by December 2009, however both sets of dual left turn lanes were not in operation until the following spring.

In August 2009, construction began on an intersection expansion project at Milwaukee Avenue in Lincolnshire. Its outdated design was a gap in the stretch of recently completed roadwork in the surrounding area. The improvements on Illinois 22 have widened the east–west approaches at this major intersection to five lanes, with the new additions being dual left turn lanes as well as right turn lanes. The new lanes were opened for the first time on October 15, 2010.

In 2011, a 2.1 mile, $13.2 million project in Bannockburn and Highland Park got underway. It extended from east of I-94 to west of US-41, with the exception of the small section that was previously worked on in 2005. IL-22 was reconstructed and widened to four lanes. The new lanes were initially opened by the end of 2012, with landscaping and finishing work carrying into 2013.

==Future==

Most of Illinois 22 has been expanded to four lanes, but there are several gaps remaining. As of 2002, plans for the section west of U.S. 12 have been put on hold indefinitely. Finally, the remaining section located primarily in Long Grove from east of Quentin Road to west of Illinois 83 is also in the works for the near future at an estimated cost of $38.5 million. This project, which is now supported by Long Grove, has suffered similarly mentioned delays, but is also closely related to yet another long delayed project; the Illinois Route 53 extension. If the extension, which is a limited-access expressway and currently terminates three miles south at Lake-Cook Road, were ever built, it would pass through this area, where there would likely be an interchange. The project has been long delayed over the decades so it appears that this section of Illinois 22 may get widened as part of a separate project.

<doc id="1227414" wikidata="Q948914" url="?curid=1227414" title="Galerina">
<text>Galerina is a genus of small brown-spore saprobic mushroom-bearing fungi, with over 300 species found throughout the world from the far north to remote Macquarie Island in the Southern Ocean. The genus is most noted for some extremely poisonous species which are occasionally confused with hallucinogenic species of &quot;Psilocybe&quot;. &quot;Galerina&quot; mushrooms are typically small and hygrophanous, with a slender and brittle stem. They are often found growing on wood, and when on the ground have a preference for mossy habitats.

&quot;Galerina&quot; means &quot;helmet-like&quot;.

==Taxonomic definition==
The genus &quot;Galerina&quot; is defined as small mushrooms of stature, that is, roughly similar in form to &quot;Mycena&quot; species: a small conical to bell-shaped cap, and gills attached to a long and slender cartilaginous stem. Species have a pileipellis that is a cutis, and ornamented spores that are brown in deposit, where the spore ornamentation comes from an extra spore covering.

==Description==

&quot;Galerina&quot; fruiting bodies are typically small, undistinguished mushrooms with a typical &quot;little brown mushroom&quot; morphology and a yellow-brown, light brown to cinnamon-brown spore print. The pileus is typically glabrous and often hygrophanous, and a cortina-type veil is present in young specimens of roughly half of recognized species, though it sometimes disappears as the mushroom ages in many of these species. Microscopically, they are highly variable as well, though most species have spores that are ornamented, lack a germ pore, and have a plage. Many species also have characteristic cystidia. However, there are many exceptions, and many species of &quot;Galerina&quot; lack one or more of these microscopic characteristics. Ecologically, all &quot;Galerina&quot; are saprobic, growing in habitats like rotting wood or in moss.

The spores of &quot;Galerina&quot; feature an ornamentation that comes from the outer layer of the spore breaking up on maturity to produce either warts, wrinkles or &quot;ears&quot;, flaps of material loosened from where the spore was attached to the basidia. This outer layer of the spore often is not complete, but has a clear patch in many species just above the attachment, this clear patch is called a plage. This plage is not evident in all species, and the spore covering does not always breakup in all species, making it sometimes difficult to correctly determine a mushroom of this genus.

The specific features that define the genus require a microscope to confirm. In the wild it can be difficult to determine a &quot;Galerina&quot; from a number of similar genera, such as &quot;Pholiota&quot;, &quot;Tubaria&quot;, &quot;Conocybe&quot;, &quot;Pholiotina&quot;, &quot;Agrocybe&quot;, &quot;Gymnopilus&quot;, &quot;Phaeogalera&quot; and &quot;Psilocybe&quot;. For the most part, Galerinas will be found associated with moss, and this can separate out the genus in nature fairly well. But this identification is more difficult in the section Naucoriopsis, which does not associate with moss, and is a decomposer of wood.

&quot;Phaeogalera&quot; is a genus that was segregated from &quot;Galerina&quot; by Robert Kühner.

==Phylogenetics==
The genus &quot;Galerina&quot; has recently been found to be polyphyletic, consisting of at least three unrelated clades, although not all species were studied and for most currently recognized species is uncertain still in which they belong. Each of these clades corresponds to a subgenus of &quot;Galerina&quot;, as outlined by Kühner. The great diversity of found in &quot;Galerina&quot; is probably due to the polyphyly of the genus.

===Selected species===

&quot;Galerina vittiformis&quot; is the type species of the genus &quot;Galerina&quot;. This species is common in beds of damp moss (along with many other species of &quot;Galerina&quot;). There are a number of variations of this species that have been named over the years: var. &quot;vittiformis f. vittiformis&quot; is a 2-spored species; var. &quot;vittiformis f. tetrasporis&quot; is a 4-spored form; var. &quot;pachyspora&quot; has been collected on Macquarie Island.

&quot;Galerina patagonica&quot; has a Gondwanan distribution. &quot;Galerina hypnorum&quot; is a widespread species.

&quot;Galerina graminea&quot; can survive in moss-free grass, unlike many &quot;Galerina&quot; mushrooms. It was known for many years as &#x27;Galerina laevis&#x27;, proposed by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon.

Several &quot;Galerina&quot; species are listed by the US Forest Service as &quot;species of special concern&quot; in the Northwest Forest Plan. These species are considered indicator species for old growth coniferous forest in the Pacific Northwest: &quot;Galerina atkinsonia&quot;, &quot;Galerina cerina&quot;, &quot;Galerina heterocystis&quot;, &quot;Galerina sphagnicola&quot;, and &quot;Galerina vittiformis&quot;.

==Toxicity of some species==
Many (though not all) &quot;Galerina&quot; contain alpha-amanitin and other amatoxins.

&quot;Galerina marginata&quot; (also known as &quot;autumn skullcap&quot;, &quot;deadly galerina&quot;, etc.) is a poisonous species found throughout the temperate regions of the world, in habitats as diverse as forests and urban parklands, wherever rotting wood is found. In 2001, DNA studies found that &quot;Galerina autumnalis&quot; and five other species of &quot;Galerina&quot; with similar morphologies were, in fact, synonyms of &quot;Galerina marginata&quot;.

&quot;Galerina sulciceps&quot;, is a lethal species found in Indonesia and responsible for deaths there. One study found it more toxic than &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;.

&quot;Galerina steglichii&quot; is very rare, bruises blue and contains the hallucinogen psilocybin.

==Identification==
The extreme toxicity of some &quot;Galerina&quot; species means that recognition of &quot;Galerina&quot; is of great importance to mushroom hunters who are seeking hallucinogenic &quot;Psilocybe&quot; mushrooms. Species like &quot;Galerina marginata&quot; may bear a superficial resemblance to &quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot; and other &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species, and has often been found growing amongst and around &quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot; and other &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species, making identification all the more confusing to the uninitiated. &quot;Galerina&quot; can be distinguished from psilocybin &quot;Psilocybe&quot; by the following characteristics:

*Spore print color: blackish-brown to lilac-brown in &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, light brown to rusty brown in &quot;Galerina&quot;. Spore color can be seen by taking a spore print or by looking for evidence of spore drop on the stipe or on surrounding mushrooms.
*Staining reaction: Psilocybin &quot;Psilocybe&quot; fruiting bodies stain blue to varying degrees when bruised, while &quot;Galerina&quot; do not. The strength of this reaction varies with the amount of psilocin present in the tissues of the mushroom. Fruiting bodies with little psilocin (such as &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot;, with high psilocybin and low psilocin content) will stain weakly if at all, while sporocarps with a high psilocin content will stain strongly blue. Only one rare &quot;Galerina&quot; has blue-staining tissue, though in some cases the flesh will blacken when handled, and this may be misinterpreted as a bluing reaction.

Although these rules are specific to the separation of &quot;Galerina&quot; from certain &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, since mixed patches of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; and &quot;Galerina&quot; can occur, it is essential to be sure of the identity of each sporocarp collected.

&quot;Galerina&quot; also present some risk of confusion with several species of small edible mushrooms, notably &quot;Kuehneromyces mutabilis&quot; and candy caps (&quot;L. camphoratus&quot; and allies).

<doc id="1227419" wikidata="Q1365424" url="?curid=1227419" title="Quintus Antistius Adventus">
<text>Quintus Antistius Adventus (c. 120 AD – after 175 AD) was a Roman politician and general. He commanded a legion, the II Adiutrix in the war against the Parthian Empire (161-166), and was appointed suffect consul around 166.

His full name, as attested in two inscriptions from modern Algeria, was Quintus Antistius Adventus Postumius Aquilinus. Olli Salomies opines that his brother was Lucius Antistius Mundicius Burrus, and his nephew was likely Lucius Antistius Burrus, ordinary consul in 181. Where the name elements &quot;Postumus Aquilinus&quot; in Adventus&#x27; name came from is something of a mystery: Salomies points out that it is &quot;quite inconceivable that he could have been a Postumus adopted by a Q. Antistius&quot;, yet notes it could have come from his mother&#x27;s side because another inscription attests his mother&#x27;s name as Antonia Prisca.

== Career ==
Professor Edward Champlin includes Adventus as a member of &quot;a Cirtan community at Rome&quot; he infers existed there, whose members included: Quintus Lollius Urbicus, consul in either 135 or 136; Gaius Arrius Antoninus, consul c. 170; and the orator Fronto. Champlin notes that Lollius Urbicus and Pactumeius Clemens themselves &quot;could provide powerful support for Cirtan interests, and such support is attested by strong circumstantial evidence.&quot;

An inscription recovered from Thibilis in Numidia, combined with a second from another Numidian town Cirta, allows us to reconstruct his career from its beginning. Adventus began his career with membership in the , which was the board that oversaw maintenance of the streets and public places in Rome; it was one of the four magistracies that comprised the &quot;vigintiviri&quot;, and membership in one of these boards was a preliminary and required first step toward a gaining entry into the Roman Senate. Next he was commissioned as the &quot;tribunus laticlavius&quot; in Legio I Minervia. Upon returning to Rome, he was elected quaestor, and in this office he went to Macedonia to manage its finances. Upon completing this office, Adventus was enrolled into the Senate. Next followed the office of &quot;sevir equitum Romanorum&quot; or presiding at the annual review of the equites at Rome, then the traditional Republican magistracy of plebeian tribune. Adventus was picked to serve as &quot;legatus&quot; or assistant to the proconsular governor of Africa, where he was for a year, until returning to Rome once again to hold a third traditional Republican magistracy, praetor. Géza Alföldy dates his praetorship to around 158.

After the praetorship Adventus was commissioned commander of Legio VI Ferrata, and while he was at this post he held at the advent of the Parthian War. He was then transferred to the command of the II Adiutrix probably in 162. From the &quot;dona militaria&quot;, or military honors, he was awarded fighting against Parthia, it is clear Antistius Adventus saw active service. He was appointed c. 164 governor of Arabia; an inscription from Bostra describes Antistius Adventus as consul designate, and Anthony Birley presumes he held that office while in Arabia. His next appointment was again in Rome as Curator of public buildings and works.

At this point Antistius Adventus was given an extraordinary command, as a general in the German Expedition (), which was launched by Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus in 168. His command was included the two newly raised Legiones II and III Italicae, protecting the passes through the Julian Alps from the invading German tribes. Although the tribes did penetrate the Julian Alps and attempted to capture Aquileia in 170, Birley believes by that time Antistius Adventus had moved on to the position of governor of Germania Inferior, the last post listed for him in the inscription from Thibilis.

Another inscription from Lanchester near Hadrian&#x27;s Wall (RIB 1083) attests that Antistius Adventus was governor of Roman Britain. Birley believes his tenure there should be &quot;very tentatively&quot; dated to c. 173–6. This was the period that 5,500 Sarmatian cavalry troops arrived in Britain, so one of his tasks in Britain was providing lands for these troops to settle on. His activities after he was governor of Britain are unknown, although it is possible Antistius Adventus was the Adventus to whom Solinus dedicated his , which includes the well-known reference to the use of coal in a temple to Minerva in Britain.

== Marriage and children ==

He was married to Novia Crispina, whom Birley identifies as the daughter of Lucius Novius Crispinus Martialis Saturninus, consul in either 150 or 151; this marriage, Birley suspects, allowed Antistius Adventus entry into his senatorial career. Birley also identifies Lucius Antistius Burrus, for 181 and son-in-law of Marcus Aurelius, as his son.

<text>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is a 1964 stop motion Christmas animated television special produced by Videocraft International, Ltd. It first aired December 6, 1964, on the NBC television network in the United States and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of &quot;The General Electric Fantasy Hour&quot;. The special was based on the 1949 Johnny Marks song &quot;Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks&#x27;s brother-in-law, Robert L. May. The concept was developed in New York City, the animation was done in Japan, the music was recorded in England, and most of the voice actors were from Canada. The production was completed in 18 months.

NBC began airing the special annually again in 2024, having previously done so from 1964 to 1971. From 1972 to 2023, the special aired on CBS, which unveiled a high-definition, digitally remastered version of the program in 2005, re-scanned frame-by-frame from the original 35 mm film elements. As with &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; and &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; no longer airs merely once annually, but several times during the Christmas and holiday season. It has been telecast every year since 1964, making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in the United States. The 50th anniversary of the television special was marked in 2014, and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6, 2014. A special exhibit was also mounted at the Masterworks Museum in Bermuda, where the original puppets are held. Since 2019, Freeform has aired the special as a part of its 25 Days of Christmas holiday programming block.

&quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; was initially met with a positive reception among critics, who praised the voice acting, soundtrack, animation style, characters, and sets. &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; is often regarded as one of the best Christmas films ever made, being featured on numerous &quot;top ten&quot; lists. It has become widely popular among both young children and adults familiar with the Christmas season, and has garnered a large cult following since its initial debut.

==Plot==

Donner, the lead reindeer for Santa Claus, and his wife have a new fawn named Rudolph. They are surprised to find out he was born with a glowing red nose. Donner attempts to first cover Rudolph&#x27;s nose with mud, and later uses a fake nose, so Rudolph will fit in with the other reindeer. 

The following spring, Rudolph goes out for the reindeer games, where the new fawns learn to fly and are scouted by Santa for future sleigh duty. Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice, who tells him he is cute, making Rudolph fly. While he celebrates with the other bucks, Rudolph&#x27;s fake nose pops off, causing the other reindeer to mock him and Coach Comet to expel him.

Rudolph meets and joins Hermey, a misfit elf who left Santa&#x27;s workshop to follow his dream to become a dentist, and Yukon Cornelius, a prospector who has spent his life searching for silver and gold. After escaping the Abominable Snow Monster, all three land on the Island of Misfit Toys. It is a place where unloved or unwanted toys reside with their ruler, a winged lion named King Moonracer, who brings the toys to the island until he can find homes and children who would love them. The king allows them to stay one night on the island and asks them to ask Santa to find homes for them. Rudolph leaves on his own that night, worried that his nose will endanger his friends.

Time passes and Rudolph, now a young stag, returns home to find that his parents and Clarice have been searching for him. He then travels to the Abominable&#x27;s cave, where they are being held captive. Rudolph attempts to rescue Clarice until the monster knocks him down with a stalactite. Hermey and Yukon eventually show up with a plan to help out Rudolph. Hermey lures the monster out of the cave by imitating the sound of a pig and pulls out the Abominable&#x27;s teeth after Yukon knocks him out. Yukon drives the toothless monster back over a cliff and falls with it.

Rudolph, Hermey, Clarice, and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them. Yukon returns with a tamed Abominable, now trained to trim a Christmas tree, explaining that the monster&#x27;s bouncing ability saved both of their lives. Christmas Eve comes and while everybody is celebrating, Santa announces that a big snowstorm is approaching, forcing him to cancel Christmas. Blinded by Rudolph&#x27;s bright nose, he changes his mind and asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh. Rudolph accepts, and their first stop is the Island of Misfit Toys, where Santa delivers the toys to children.

==Production==

=== Development ===
The special, with the teleplay by Romeo Muller, introduced several new characters inspired by the song&#x27;s lyrics. Muller told an interviewer shortly before his death that he would have preferred to base the teleplay on May&#x27;s original book, but could not find a copy. After the script, concept designs and storyboards for &quot;Rudolph&quot; were done by Arthur Rankin Jr. and his staff of artists at Rankin/Bass in New York City.

=== Voice cast ===
Most of the characters were portrayed by Canadian actors recorded at RCA Studios at 225 Mutual Street in Toronto under the supervision of Bernard Cowan. The recording sessions lasted for two days, which was followed by a session in New York City to polish the songs. Rankin and Bass chose Canadian voice actors for two reasons. First, while the last radio dramas in the United States had ended production a few years previously, many were still being produced in Canada, giving the producers a large talent pool to choose from. CBC was large enough to enable American workers, such as Rankin and Bass, to get their shows done in Toronto. Second, Rankin and Bass were taking loans from friends to bankroll and chose Toronto&#x27;s Crawley Films to financially stretch out 130 short episodes of &quot;Tales of the Wizard of Oz&quot;, which made the Canadian labor costs cheaper. Billie Mae Richards, who provided the voice of Rudolph, reprised the role for &quot;Rudolph&#x27;s Shiny New Year&quot; and &quot;Rudolph and Frosty&#x27;s Christmas in July&quot;.

Sam the Snowman was originally voiced by Larry D. Mann, but it was later decided that Burl Ives would voice him. Ives was hired to appease NBC and its sponsor General Electric. This was Rankin/Bass&#x27;s marketing strategy to employ a bigger celebrity, which would later happen in other specials, such as Jimmy Durante in &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; and Fred Astaire in &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;. In the original production, Billie Mae Richards, who voiced Rudolph, was credited as &quot;Billy Richards&quot; since Rankin and Bass did not want to disclose that a woman had done the part.

=== Designs and animation ===
The figures were designed by continuity designer Antony Peters in the United States. Peters&#x27; name is also misspelled in all prints of the special since 1965. The company&#x27;s trademark stop motion animation process, known as &quot;Animagic&quot;, was filmed at MOM Productions in Tokyo with supervision by Tadahito Mochinaga and associate direction by Kizo Nagashima. Besides &quot;Rudolph&quot;, Mochinaga and the rest of the Japanese puppet animation staff are also known for their partnership with Rankin/Bass on their other Animagic productions almost throughout the 1960s, from &quot;The New Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, to &quot;Willy McBean and his Magic Machine&quot;, to &quot;The Daydreamer&quot; and &quot;Mad Monster Party?&quot;

Each &quot;Animagic&quot; figure cost $5,000 to make, including Rudolph and Santa.

=== Music ===
The songs were written by Johnny Marks, with musical director Maury Laws composing the incidental score. In addition to songs written specifically for the film, several of Marks&#x27; other holiday standards populate the instrumental score, among them &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; and &quot;I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day&quot;. Many of the songs are utilized in the score as musical themes for recurring characters and ideas, such as &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; (for Yukon Cornelius, sung by Burl Ives), &quot;Jingle, Jingle, Jingle&quot; (Santa, sung by Stan Francis) and &quot;There&#x27;s Always Tomorrow&quot; (Clarice, sung by Janis Orenstein). The music score was recorded in England. In 1965, an executive of the special&#x27;s sponsor General Electric decided that &quot;We&#x27;re a Couple of Misfits&quot; would be replaced by &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;re a Couple of Misfits&quot; was added back in 1998.

Ives re-recorded &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;, with different arrangements, for the song&#x27;s 1964 single release. This version, along with a similarly newly recorded version of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, was released the following year on his 1965 album &quot;Have a Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;. 

==Broadcast==
=== Marketing ===
Rankin and Bass signed a deal with General Electric to cover the special&#x27;s cost of $500,000. The contract only lasted for two broadcasts. To promote the special, a set of puppets was shipped from Japan to the United States and displayed at NBC Studios in Manhattan, New York City during the Christmas season.

=== Release and reruns ===
&quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; premiered on December 6, 1964, as part of &quot;The General Electric Fantasy Hour&quot; on NBC, at 5:30pm (EST). In 1972, the special would start airing on CBS.

In May 2019, it was announced that Freeform would air the special as part of their annual 25 Days of Christmas lineup for the first time, alongside &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;. The agreement was later revealed to be an exclusive rights agreement, as CBS continued to broadcast the special over-the-air each November and December until 2023, but not on Paramount+ nor, in an unusual case of blackout, virtual multichannel video program distributors such as YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, which have traditionally carried all network programming in the same fashion as cable and satellite providers; CBS parent company Paramount claimed, copyright ambiguity notwithstanding, that it did not have streaming rights to the special.

NBC broadcast the special again for the first time in 52 years on December 6, 2024, in a 75-minute telecast. This change also marked the first time that this special can be streamed on YouTube TV, Hulu and other live TV services.

==Home media==
&quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; was first released on VHS and LaserDisc by Family Home Entertainment and Broadway Video from 1989 to 1996 under the &quot;Christmas Classics Series&quot; label. It was re-released in 1997 by Family Home Entertainment and Golden Books Family Entertainment.

In 1998, the special was re-released on VHS by Sony Wonder and Golden Books Family Entertainment. In 1999, the special was released for the first time on DVD by the two companies. In 2010, the special was released for the first time on Blu-ray by Vivendi Entertainment. On November 4, 2014, they re-released the special on a 50th anniversary edition on Blu-ray and DVD. The same 50th anniversary Blu-ray edition was released with an exclusive storybook; this was only sold at Walmart. Universal Pictures Home Entertainment re-released the special again on DVD and Blu-ray in 2018. Universal re-released the special on 4K UHD Blu-ray as part of &quot;The Classic Christmas Specials Collection&quot; (with &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; and &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;) in 2022.

==Reception==

=== Critical response ===
Upon its initial broadcast, &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; received acclaim from critics. A television review of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the special &quot;a charming and tuneful hour of fantasy&quot;, stating that the animation &quot;radiated a gentle spirit of make-believe&quot; and praising the songs as &quot;an ideal complement to the story of Robert L. May.&quot; A review on &quot;San Antonio Light&quot;&#x27;s TV Week praised the special as a &quot;delightful hour for children&quot;, describing it as &quot;cleverly conceived&quot;. Cynthia Lowry of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the story was &quot;full of delightful adult wit and a bit of satire.&quot;

&quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; received an approval rating of 95% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on thirteen reviews, with an average rating of 9.37/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is a yule-tide gem that bursts with eye-popping iconography, a spirited soundtrack, and a heart-warming celebration of difference.&quot; Contemporary reports rated the special highly, with a 1970 survey from Clarke Williamson noting that viewers gave the special above-average reviews, only slightly lower than two other 1960s classics, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;, and ahead of other specials of the era. In December 2018, a &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot;/&quot;Morning Consult&quot; poll which surveyed 2,200 adults from Nov. 15–18, 2018, named &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; the most beloved holiday film, with 83% of respondents having a generally favorable response to the title.

=== Ratings ===
When &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; premiered on NBC, it was seen by 55% of the U.S. audience. In 1999, &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; received 1,292,000 viewers on Global and 1,107,000 viewers during three broadcasts on YTV in Canada. The 60th anniversary broadcast on NBC was the most-watched rerun Christmas special across all networks in 2024, with 5,300,000 viewers; among all Christmas specials in 2024, it was second only to another NBC broadcast, &quot;Christmas in Rockefeller Center&quot;.

== Controversies and criticism ==
=== Copyright notice ===
The year of the copyright notice (which used Roman numerals) was listed as MCLXIV (year 1164) and not MCMLXIV. Because the published work was released in 1964, the copyright was potentially weakened, as a copyright notice with a correct date was required for copyright protection in works that are published earlier than March 1, 1989.

=== Island of Misfit Toys ending scene ===
The original version did not include Santa traveling to the Island of Misfit Toys to pick up the toys. According to Jules Bass, viewers wanted to see the scene and wrote letters. The scene was later animated and added in 1965.
=== Dolly for Sue speculation ===
Dolly for Sue, a supporting character from the special, has sparked speculation since her debut. Being a seemingly normal-looking rag doll, there is no clear reason for Dolly being on the Island of Misfit Toys. It was once debated that it had to do with her physical appearance, particularly her missing a nose. Other speculations were raised, and many believed Dolly was only created because the rest of the toys on the island were &quot;boys&quot;, so they created a &quot;girl&quot; toy to balance the cast.

According to &quot;The Making of the Rankin/Bass Holiday Classic: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, nothing in the script gave any indication on why Dolly for Sue is a misfit toy. On December 8, 2007, during a trivia game on &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, Rankin admitted in a recent interview: &quot;she was cast off by her mistress and was clinically depressed.&quot;

=== Later CBS broadcasts ===
From 2005 to 2023, CBS broadcast an edited version of the special, which included the compression of several scenes. Although &quot;We&#x27;re a Couple of Misfits&quot; remained, the audio was played over the video of &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot;, a song that has replaced &quot;We&#x27;re a Couple of Misfits&quot; in airings starting in 1965 before the original song was added in 1998. The audio was also edited to match the video despite not matching the movements of the characters. The edit was heavily criticized by the audience and fans of the special. Rankin/Bass historian Rick Goldschmidt also criticized the edit of the special, commenting: &quot;Somebody there did a really crappy job of editing it.&quot; Freeform and NBC&#x27;s current broadcasts do not have this issue, instead using the same print as Universal&#x27;s home video releases.

== Aftermath and cultural impact ==

=== Actors&#x27; residuals and compensations ===
Ives, and his estate, received annual residuals from the show. &quot;This business of residuals was new to our union, which was not quite as strong as SAG or others in the States&quot;, Soles recalled in 2014. After the first three broadcasts, the rest of the voice actors did not receive residuals for the characters due to ACTRA&#x27;s labor costs. However, Richards received residuals for three years, and as of 2007, Soles received $400 in residuals ($10 for each year). Each of them received approximately $1,000 for their work throughout the years. While Richards said in 2000 that her compensation was a &quot;sore subject&quot; for her, she had no complaints about the work itself. &quot;I feel so lucky to have something that has made such an impact on people, and it&#x27;s because of the story first and foremost.&quot; Goldschmidt once offered to get Richards some money to sign her signature on Rudolph&#x27;s collectibles, but Richard&#x27;s agent informed her that the offer was too vague.

=== Restored figures of Rudolph and Santa ===
Since those involved with the production had no idea of the future value of the stop-motion puppet figures used in the production, many were not preserved. In 2007, Rankin claimed to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure and suspected that most of the others had been destroyed because of the wear and tear from manipulating the figures during production. Rankin-Bass historian Rick Goldschmidt revealed that a few puppets were still in the possession of people who worked on the special. Most of the extant figures are &quot;publicity&quot; copies for the NBC headquarters, which were created and used for photography and other purposes. Nine puppets—including Santa and young Rudolph—were displayed at the NBC headquarters in Manhattan. They were going to be thrown away, but they were given to Rankin&#x27;s secretary, Barbara Adams. Adams gave them to her nieces and nephews, who played with them under the Christmas tree. After Christmas, the figures would be stored in an attic. The heat caused several of them to melt together and had to be thrown away.

In 2005, a nephew of Adams found the figures of Rudolph and Santa and brought them to be appraised on &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS. At that time, their figures were listed on EBay, and their appraised value was between $8,000 and $10,000. The puppets had been damaged through years of rough handling by children and storage in an attic. The family later sold both figures to TimeandSpaceToys.com president Kevin A. Kriess. Kriess confirmed that he bought them after he shared photos and knew about the history. Kriess had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties, a Los Angeles-based collective of film directors specializing in stop-motion animation, with puppet fabricator Robin Walsh leading the project. The figures have been shown at conventions since then. They were sold at auction on November 13, 2020. netting a $368,000 sale price, doubling the expected return. On December 22, 2020, they were donated to the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, Georgia.

== Merchandise ==
A &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; video game was released on November 9, 2010. The adaptation was published by Red Wagon Games for the Wii and Nintendo DS, and was developed by High Voltage Software and Glyphic Entertainment respectively. The Wii version was received poorly, and garnered extremely negative reviews from sites such as IGN giving it a 1.5/10.

==Sequels==
The Rankin/Bass special inspired numerous television sequels made by the same studio:
* &quot;Rudolph&#x27;s Shiny New Year&quot; (1976), a special that first aired on ABC and is still aired annually on both ABC and Freeform.
* &quot;Rudolph and Frosty&#x27;s Christmas in July&quot; (1979), a feature-length special that paired Rudolph with the song-inspired character Frosty the Snowman.
* &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys&quot; (2001), a direct-to-video animated film. Released by a team that produced an unrelated &quot;Rudolph&quot; movie in 1998, neither Rankin/Bass or its descendant companies had any involvement in its production.
* &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - 4D Attraction&quot; (2016), 10-minute stop motion story adaptation in the form of a 4D film for SimEx-Iwerks; produced by Bent Image Lab and directed by Chel White.
* &quot;T.E.A.M. Rudolph and the Reindeer Games&quot; (2018), a short film adaptation of the book of the same name was featured on the original film&#x27;s 2018 Blu-ray release

<text>William Frederick McFadzean VC (9 October 1895 – 1 July 1916) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions on the opening day of the Battle of the Somme.

==Early life==
William Frederick McFadzean was born in Lurgan in County Armagh, Ireland on 9 October 1895. His parents, William McFadzean and his wife Annie Pedlow , were from Belfast and lived in the suburb of Cregagh. Known as &quot;Billy&quot;, he was educated at Mountpottinger National School and then the Trade Preparatory School of the Municipal Technical Institute.

A keen sportsman and standing tall, McFadzean played rugby union for Collegians RFC. After completing his schooling, McFadzean worked for a manufacturer of linen. He was also interested in the military, and was a member of the East Belfast Regiment of the Ulster Volunteers and the Young Citizens Volunteers.

==First World War==
Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, members of the Ulster division were urged to join the British Army to form an infantry division. McFadzean enlisted in the 14th Battalion of The Royal Irish Rifles as a private. The regiment was to form part of the 36th (Ulster) Division. After completing training, firstly at Finner Camp in Ireland and then Seaforth in England, McFadzean and his regiment embarked for the Western Front in October 1915.

The 36th Division was stationed near Thiepval Wood from March 1916 and would be involved in the upcoming Battle of the Somme, for which it was tasked with advancing to Grandcourt. In the early hours of 1 July 1916, McFadzean&#x27;s battalion was assembled in Thiepval Wood in preparation for the advance. While an artillery barrage on the opposing German trenches was in progress, he was one of the bombardiers priming supplies of hand grenades. In handling a box of grenades, the box fell into a crowded trench and two of the grenades&#x27; safety pins were dislodged. McFadzean threw himself on top of them before they exploded, killing him but injuring only one other. For his action, he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation, published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; read:
Letters of condolences were written to McFadzean&#x27;s father by the commander of the Ulster Volunteers, Lieutenant Colonel Spencer Chichester, and Colonel F. O. Bowen, the commander of 14th Battalion. King George V also wrote to the family and provided train tickets to travel to the VC investiture at Buckingham Palace. McFadzean was buried in Thiepval Wood; his grave was later lost. 
==Medal and legacy==
McFadzean&#x27;s father was presented with his son&#x27;s VC by the King in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 28 February 1917. The VC is held by the Royal Ulster Rifles Museum, in Belfast.

There are a number of memorials and remembrances of McFadzean, who is the best known of the Ulster Division VC recipients. There is a plaque to him at Newtownbreda Presbyterian Church in Belfast, which also hosted his memorial service on the one year anniversary of his death, and at his parents&#x27; house in Cregagh. There is also a mural depicting him in Cregagh and several in Belfast. His name is one of those listed on the memorial stone at the Thiepval Memorial for the VC recipients of the Ulster Division and he is also listed on the memorial tablet for the Royal Irish Rifles at St. Anne&#x27;s Cathedral at Belfast. He is also commemorated in t-shirts, mugs and death scrolls, while the &quot;Ballad of Billy McFadzean&quot; is a well-known Loyalist song. On 13 October 2018 the Ancre Somme Association Charity unveiled a bronze bust of McFadzean in Lurgan.

<text>Illinois Route 60 (IL 60) is a east–west state highway in Lake County, in northeastern Illinois. It connects the village of Volo at Illinois Route 120 (Belvidere Road) just east of Illinois Route 59 with the city of Lake Forest at U.S. Highway 41 (Skokie Highway).

== Route description ==
Illinois 60&#x27;s northern terminus is at a T-intersection in Volo with Illinois 120. It runs southeast as a 2-lane road serving a mixture of farmland and suburban neighborhoods in Grayslake and Round Lake. Running south through Mundelein, the roadbed begins to carry Illinois 83 just north of an intersection with Illinois 176. 

Illinois 60 overlaps with Illinois Route 83 south of Ivanhoe where Illinois 83 curves around U.S. Route 45. It is called Town Line Road east of Illinois 83 and west of the Tri-State Tollway (Interstate 94), because Illinois 60 straddles the line separating Vernon and Libertyville Townships for most of its length.

Through Vernon Hills, Illinois 60 serves as a major arterial route for traffic from Interstate 94 to access the village&#x27;s expansive retail and residential areas. Through Lake Forest to the east, Route 60 is called Kennedy Road.

Route 60, especially the portion between Milwaukee Avenue and Interstate 94 in Mettawa, experiences unusually heavy traffic for an arterial road, although less so in recent years.

== History ==
SBI Route 60 ran from the original alignment of US 12 in Richmond to Chicago via the present alignment of US 12, Rand Road/Northwest Highway, Touhy Avenue, and US 14. This was removed in 1938 to accommodate the realignment of US 12 and US 14 as well as the addition of US 12 City. In February 1967, IL 60 was brought back to replace IL 59A as part of replacing some superfluous designations. In 1972, IL 60 was removed east of US 41 due to the decommissioning of IL 42.

<doc id="1227434" wikidata="Q328526" url="?curid=1227434" title="Eisregen">
<text>Eisregen is a German Gothic/death metal/black metal band formed in 1995. The members are from Tambach-Dietharz, a village in Thuringia. Four of the band&#x27;s albums are banned in Germany, with different restriction levels.

== History ==
In English, Eisregen translates to &quot;ice rain&quot;. The band received scrutiny from the German authorities due to their morbid lyrics, causing three of their albums to be banned in Germany by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons.

Eisregen originally planned to disband after releasing a final album called &quot;Menschenmaterial&quot; (in direct translation means &quot;human resources&quot;, a dehumanizing reference towards humans being &quot;spendable&quot; like mineral or natural resources), but announced that they will continue to work together.

== Musical style ==
Eisregen&#x27;s old albums were more black metal-influenced than the newer ones. Their gothic influences which includes violin sections first came with 1998&#x27;s &quot;Krebskolonie&quot; (&quot;cancer colony&quot;), which is also considered the band&#x27;s best album by many of their fans, is now a typical addition to the band&#x27;s discography. 

== Censorship ==
Unlike regular banning (referred to as &quot;indexing&quot;), which prohibits playing the songs in public, selling to minors and any kind of advertisement, &quot;Krebskolonie&quot; is not allowed to be sold at all in Germany. The reason given by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons were the lyrics, which were described as cruel, inhuman, misogynistic and violent. The band could not fight the ban as their label Last Episode (which they left afterwards) did not inform them.

Interviews show the reasons giving for the ban differ from lyricist Michael Roth&#x27;s intentions. As an example, an excerpt from the ban report referring to the song &quot;Futter für die Schweine&quot; (&quot;food for the pigs&quot;):

: &quot;Dieses Lied weist daneben auch Bezüge zur Frauenfeindlichkeit auf. So ist der Sänger der Meinung, dass das Leben einer Prostituierten so gering zu schätzen sei, dass sie nur als Schweinefutter tauge&quot; (translates to: &quot;This song also contains misogynistic references. In the singer&#x27;s opinion, a prostitute&#x27;s life has so little value that she is only fit to be pig food.&quot;)

Roth himself stated:

: &quot;Die Menschheit nimmt sich prinzipiell immer viel zu wichtig und stellt sich eben immer an die Spitze der Nahrungskette […]. Es war einfach ganz interessant, daß man mal ein Wesen darüberstellt. Den Mensch eben auch mal zum Futter degradiert […]. Das Thema hab ich auch wieder bei &#x27;Futter für die Schweine&#x27; aufgegriffen, daß sich die Nahrungskette eben mal anders darstellt, als sie gemeinhin aufgefaßt wird. Die Geschichte ist aus einer ziemlich kranken und zynischen Sicht geschrieben.&quot; (translates to: &quot;Mankind normally takes itself far too serious and sees itself as the top of the food chain [...]. It was interesting to put another creature there [...]. I used that topic for &#x27;Futter für die Schweine&#x27; and showed the food chain in different way than it is generally seen. The story is told from a quite sick and cynical view.&quot;)

The ban of the 2001 album &quot;Farbenfinsternis&quot; (&quot;color darkness&quot;), which along with &quot;Krebskolonie&quot; was one of their most important releases, inflicted financial damages to Eisregen. The album &quot;Menschenmaterial&quot;, originally thought to be their sixth and last album, was not released. The band announced to release one more album called &quot;Blutbahnen&quot; (&quot;bloodlines&quot;) before, as they found new motivation to make music.

On 1 February 2007, their release &quot;Wundwasser&quot; (&quot;water from wounds&quot;) was banned due to &quot;youth endangering and condemnable contents&quot;.

In order to circumvent the banning rules, Eisregen retitle songs when playing them live. &quot;Meine tote Russische Freundin&quot; and &quot;Futter für die Schweine&quot; became &quot;Meine schwedische Freundin&quot; and &quot;Nonnen für die Schweine&quot;. &quot;Krebskolonie&quot; is often played as &quot;Leprakolonie&quot; (&quot;leper colony&quot;).

In December 2023 the restrictions for the album &quot;Farbenfinsternis&quot; were lifted, after the band had asked for a re-examination.

== Reception ==
Although Eisregen were criticized for their morbid horror and splatter-influenced lyrics, their songs also have some humorous undertones and sometimes even deal with social or historical topics (e.g. &quot;Schwarze Rose&quot;, &quot;vom Muttermord&quot;, &quot;Ripper von Rostow&quot;, &quot;Eisenkreuzkrieger&quot;, &quot;17 Kerzen am Dom&quot;) in a fictional way.

<text>The Volkswagen New Beetle is a compact car introduced by Volkswagen in 1997, drawing heavy inspiration from the exterior design of the original Beetle. Unlike the original Beetle, the New Beetle has its engine in the front, driving the front wheels, with luggage storage in the rear. It received a facelift in 2005 and was in production until 2011, almost fourteen years since its introduction.

In the 2012 model year, a new Beetle model, the Beetle (A5), replaced the New Beetle. Various versions of this model continued to be produced in Puebla, Mexico, until the final car left the assembly line on 10 July 2019.

==History==

At the 1994 North American International Auto Show, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a &quot;retro&quot;-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Volkswagen Beetle. Designed by J Mays and Freeman Thomas at the company&#x27;s California design studio, the concept car was based on the platform of the Volkswagen Polo. A red cabriolet concept was featured at the Geneva Motor Show, also in 1994.

Production design approval was reached in mid-1995, with a design freeze resulting in 22 months of development time for production. In October 1995, the Volkswagen Concept Two was shown at the Tokyo Motor Show, essentially an early preview of the production model due in early 1998.

Strong public reaction to the Concept One convinced the company that it should develop a production version which was launched as the New Beetle in 1997 for the 1998 model-year, based on the Golf IV&#x27;s larger PQ34 platform. The New Beetle is related to the original only in name and appearance (including the absence of a car emblem script with the exception of the VW logo). For the 1998 model year, only the TDI compression-ignition engine was turbocharged; the spark-ignition engines were only naturally aspirated. In June 1999, Volkswagen introduced the 1.8T, which was the first turbocharged spark-ignition engine offered for the New Beetle. Volkswagen created a web site dedicated specifically to the 1.8T. A convertible was added for the 2003 model-year to replace the Volkswagen Cabrio. However, the New Beetle Convertible was never offered with a compression-ignition engine in North America. The third-generation Beetle Convertible, the successor to the New Beetle Convertible, was offered with the TDI compression-ignition engine in the USA but not in Canada, though, making it possibly the only diesel convertible car offered in North America.

The New Beetle carries many design similarities with the original VW Beetle: separate fenders, vestigial running boards, sloping headlamps, and large round taillights, as well as a high rounded roofline. It was assembled in VW&#x27;s Puebla factory in Mexico.

In June 2005, Volkswagen announced a facelift of the New Beetle featuring revised bumpers, wheels, lamps, VW emblems, sharper lines and a different interior. In the USA it went on sale for the 2006 model year.

===Body styles===
===Engine choices===

===Safety===
The New Beetle achieved five stars in the 2011 Euro NCAP tests compared to four stars in the 2000 Euro NCAP tests scoring 25 points (33 to reach five stars).

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the New Beetle a &quot;Good&quot; overall score in their frontal crash test. 2004 models come standard with side airbags; however, the IIHS rated the Beetle &quot;Poor&quot; in their side impact test.

===United States models===
Engine choices include the 2.0 L inline-four for the base model, the 1.9 L TDI turbodiesel inline-four (discontinued after the 2006 model year due to more stringent emissions requirements), and the 1.8 L turbo inline-four for the Turbo and Sport models.

The Turbo S model (sold 2002–2004) included the 1.8 L turbo but with . It also included a sport suspension, six-speed manual transmission, aluminum interior trim, revised front/rear fascias, and bigger wheels and tires. A close relative of the Turbo S was the 2002–2004 Color Concept. This limited edition variant was available in limited exterior colors, with interior door panel inserts, seat inserts, floor mat piping, and wheel opening inserts color-matched to the exterior paint. Wheel color inserts, diameter, and style varied with model year. It came standard with the 1.8 turbo gasoline engine, 5-speed manual gearbox, speed-activated rear spoiler, power windows/sunroof/door locks, heated leather seats, and fog lamps.

All 1.8L Turbo and Turbo S inline-four models were equipped with a retractable rear spoiler which was not available on the 1.9 L TDI inline-4, 2.0 L inline-four and 2.5 L inline-five models.

For the 2006 model, the exterior was slightly redesigned with more angular bumpers and wheel wells, and these models were fitted with the 2.5 L 5-cylinder engine with which was also fitted on the Rabbit and Jetta, later becoming the sole engine option. The New Beetle would not be given the upgraded 2.5 L engine (engine code CBTA/CBUA) that 2008 and later Jettas and Rabbits received.

==Special editions==

===Beetle RSi (2001–2003)===

The &quot;RSi&quot; is a limited 250 unit version of the New Beetle. It included a 3.2-litre VR6 engine, a 6-speed gearbox, and Volkswagen&#x27;s four-wheel drive system 4motion, Remus twin-pipe exhaust. It was rumored Porsche tuned the suspension but the suspension tuning was actually carried out in-house at VW Individual. The suspension was greatly altered at the rear, with geometry more geared to the race track and a rear cross brace behind the rear seats, wider fenders, unique front and rear bumpers, a rear diffuser, large rear wing, and 18x9 OZ Superturismo wheels with 235/40ZR-18 tires. Inside, it was trimmed in carbon fiber, billet aluminum, and bright orange leather. The front seats were Recaro racing buckets.

===Ragster concept (2005)===

At the 2005 North American International Auto Show, the Volkswagen New Beetle Ragster concept car was introduced. It was supposed to be a preview of the future design of the New Beetle. The base of the Ragster (the name denoting a cross between a &quot;ragtop&quot; and a speedster) was a New Beetle Convertible modified with a new roof, giving it a much lower roofline, and a unique paint job with silver double stripes. The interior differs from the original New Beetle, being a 2+2, and having distinctive control dials. The Ragster&#x27;s rear-view mirror is mounted on its dashboard, a retro feature, reminiscent of the first Type 1s.

=== Anniversary Edition (2008) ===

The anniversary edition was released in 2008 for the Mexican and Australian markets, and celebrated the 10th anniversary of the New Beetle. Based on the Beetle Miami, the car featured the exclusive body colour of &quot;Campanella white&quot;, with a black roof and door mirrors, and featured a &#x27;10&#x27; logo stripe on the side. The interior was also modified, featuring black and white leather seats with a &#x27;10&#x27; logo on the headrest and in the footwells, with a decoration showing the production number of the Beetle. The car had a 1.6 litre petrol engine. 310 New Beetle Anniversary Editions were produced.

===Blush (2009)===

The Blush is a limited New Beetle convertible with a special &quot;white gold&quot; exterior paint and &quot;Bordeaux red&quot; convertible top, with burgundy leather seats matching the convertible top color. Neither the white gold exterior nor interior colors were available on other 2009 New Beetle convertibles. 1500 New Beetle Blush convertibles were produced.

===Final edition (2010)===

Announced at the 2009 Los Angeles Auto Show, the 2010 Final Edition New Beetle featured Aquarius Blue paintwork, with the hardtop receiving a black painted roof and the convertible sporting Campanella White painted side panels. In addition to unique 17-inch wheels, both models were powered by a 2.5-liter engine mated to an automatic &quot;Tiptronic&quot; transmission. Other additions included sports suspension and &quot;Final Edition&quot; badging inside and out. Both models arrived with integrated fog lights and Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) as standard.

The &quot;Final Edition&quot; marked the end of production of the New Beetle. It was succeeded in 2011 by the Beetle (A5).

===BlackOrange Edition (2010)===
In 2010, Volkswagen Australia offered a final limited edition variant named as BlackOrange Edition. Two-color combinations were available: Black gloss exterior with silver mirrors, silver alloy wheels and silver decals for the lower flanks of the body, or Red Rock metallic exterior with black roof/mirrors, black alloy wheels and black decals for the lower flanks. All BlackOrange Editions came with 17-inch alloy wheels, sports suspension, leatherette seat upholstery, cruise control, front fog lights, tinted rear side/rear windows, aluminium pedals and leather-bound steering wheel/gear knob.

<doc id="1227450" wikidata="Q3622560" url="?curid=1227450" title="Caerellius Priscus">
<text>Caerellius Priscus is the name given to the man on an inscription recovered at Mogontiacum (Mainz), set up by a governor of Germania Superior who was afterwards governor of Roman Britain in the late 170s.

The name of his son in the inscription implies that his &quot;gentilicium&quot; was &quot;Caerellius&quot;, which is how Anthony Birley refers to him. Edmund Groag suggested the dedicant might be Asellius Aemilianus proconsul of 192–193, but Birley disagrees. Birley also admits &quot;Caerellius&quot; might be identical with Gaius Caerellius Sabinus, legate of Legio XIII Gemina and afterwards governor of Raetia, but finds several objections to this, most notably that Sabinus&#x27; wife was Fufidia Pollitta and the wife of the man in this inscription was named Modestiana. Birley concludes by stating the &quot;most likely&quot; identification of &quot;Caerellius&quot; is with Caerellius Priscus, &quot;praetor tutelaris&quot; under Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, between the years 161 through 169. This is the same identification that Géza Alföldy makes.

== Career ==
The Mainz inscription lists the provinces Caerellius was governor of in a problematic order: Thracia, Moesia Superior, Raetia, Germania Superior then Britain. According to Birley, Raetia, typically a province governed by an ex-praetor, is out of place &quot;between two consular provinces&quot;. Although Birley argues that Moesia Superior might have been downgraded to praetorian status, it is possible these provinces were not listed in chronological order. Alföldy, following Birley, provides the following dates for Caerellius&#x27; governorships: Thracia c. 167 - c. 170, Moesia Superior c. 170 - c. 172, suffect consul around 172, Germania Superior c. 174 - c. 177, and likely governor of Roman Britain c. 177–180.

Dio Cassius notes that at the beginning of Commodus&#x27; sole rule, &quot;tribes&quot; crossed the Antonine Wall and defeated a general (στρατηγόν) and his soldiers in Britain. Birley admits there is some disagreement whether by &quot;general&quot; Dio means a legionary legate or provincial governor, but argues that Dio consistently uses that word to indicate a governor. Although it would appear the governor slain was Caerellius, Birley argues that &quot;he was one of the low-quality governors appointed by Commodus soon after his ascension, rather than ... an experienced commander such as &#x27;Caerellius&#x27;.&quot; In response to this disaster, the Praetorian prefect Tigidius Perennis immediately sent Ulpius Marcellus to replace him, who proceeded to ruthlessly crush the rebellion.

If Caerellius was not the governor killed in battle, he nevertheless vanishes from history after concluding his term as governor of Britain.

== Family ==
The Mainz inscription attests Caerellius had a wife, Modestiana, a daughter, Germanilla, and a son, Marcianus. Birley suggests Marcianus may be identified with a C(a)erellius Macrinus the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; (Severus 13.6) listed as executed by order of the Emperor Septimius Severus, presumably because he had supported his rival Clodius Albinus. Birley also admits Caerellius was likely a kinsman to the above-mentioned Sabinus.

<doc id="1227456" wikidata="Q587862" url="?curid=1227456" title="Forensic toxicology">
<text>Forensic toxicology is a multidisciplinary field that combines the principles of toxicology with expertise in disciplines such as analytical chemistry, pharmacology and clinical chemistry to aid medical or legal investigation of death, poisoning, and drug use. The paramount focus for forensic toxicology is not the legal implications of the toxicological investigation or the methodologies employed, but rather the acquisition and accurate interpretation of results. Toxicological analyses can encompass a wide array of samples. In the course of an investigation, a forensic toxicologist must consider the context of an investigation, in particular any physical symptoms recorded, and any evidence collected at a crime scene that may narrow the search, such as pill bottles, powders, trace residue, and any available chemicals. Armed with this contextual information and samples to examine, the forensic toxicologist is tasked with identifying the specific toxic substances present, quantifying their concentrations, and assessing their likely impact on the individual involved.

In the United States, forensic toxicology compromises three distinct disciplines: Postmortem toxicology, Human Performance toxicology, and Forensic Drug Testing (FDT). Postmortem toxicology involves analyzing biological specimens obtained during an autopsy to identify the impact of drugs, alcohol, and poisons. A broad array of biological specimens, including blood, urine, gastric contents, oral fluids, hair, and tissues, may undergo analysis. Forensic toxicologists collaborate with pathologists, medical examiners, and coroners to ascertain the cause and manner of death. Human Performance toxicology examines the dose-response relationship between drugs present in the body and their effects. This field plays a pivotal role in shaping and implementing laws related to activities such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Lastly, Forensic Drug Testing (FDT) pertains to detecting drug use in contexts such as the workplace, sport doping, drug-related probation, and screenings for new job applicants.

Identifying the ingested substance ingested is frequently challenging due to the body&#x27;s natural processes (as outlined in ADME). It is uncommon for a chemical to persist in its original form once inside the body. For instance, heroin rapidly undergoes metabolism, ultimately converting to morphine. Consequently, a thorough examination of factors such as injection marks and chemical purity becomes imperative for an accurate diagnosis. Additionally, the substance might undergo dilution as it disperses throughout the body. Unlike a regulated dose of a drug, which may contain grams or milligrams of the active constituent, an individual sample under investigation may only consist of micrograms or nanograms.
== How certain substances affect your body ==

=== Alcohol ===
Alcohol gains access to the central nervous system by entering the blood stream through the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Subsequently, it transverses the blood brain barrier via the circulatory system. The absorbed alcohol can diminish reflexes, disrupt nerve impulses, prolong muscle responses, and impact various other physiological functions throughout the body.

=== Marijuana ===
Similar to alcohol, marijuana is absorbed into the bloodstream and crosses the blood brain barrier. Notably, the THC released from marijuana binds to the CB-1 cannabinoid receptors, inducing various effects. These effects encompass mood changes, altered perception of time, and heightened sensitivity, among others.

=== Cocaine ===
Cocaine, in contrast to marijuana or alcohol, is a powerful stimulant. Upon entering the bloodstream, it rapidly reaches the brain within minutes, causing a significant surge in dopamine levels. The effects of cocaine are intense but short-lived, typically lasting about 30 minutes. The primary method of administration is through nasal insufflation (snorting), although it can also be smoked in crystal rock form. The rapid increase in dopamine levels during use contributes to a pronounced and challenging comedown, often prompting individuals to seek higher doses in subsequent use to achieve the same effects as experienced previously. This pattern can contribute to the development of addiction. The effects of cocaine use include increased energy and euphoria, accompanied by potential negative effects such as paranoia, rapid heart rate, and anxiety, among others.

==Examples==
===Urine===
A urine sample, originating from the bladder, is obtainable both voluntarily and taken post-mortem. Notably, urine is less prone to viral infections such as HIV or Hepatitis B in comparison to blood samples. Many drugs exhibit higher concentrations and more prolonged detection in urine compared to blood. The collection of urine samples is a non-invasive process that doesn&#x27;t necessitate professional assistance. While urine is commonly used for qualitative analysis, it does not provide indications of impairment since the presence of drugs in urine merely signifies prior exposure. The duration of drug detection in urine varies; for instance, alcohol is detectable for 7–12 hours, cocaine metabolites for 2–4 days, and morphine for 48–74 hours. Marijuana, a substance with variable detection times depending on usage patterns, can be detected for 3 days after a single use, 5–7 days for moderate use (four times per week), 10–15 days for daily use, and less than 30 days for long-term heavy use, contingent upon frequency and intensity of consumption.

===Blood===
A blood sample of approximately is usually sufficient to screen and confirm most common toxic substances. A blood sample provides the toxicologist with a profile of the substance that the subject was influenced by at the time of collection; for this reason, it is the sample of choice for measuring blood alcohol content in drunk driving cases.

===Hair===
Hair is capable of recording medium to long-term or high dosage substance abuse. Chemicals in the bloodstream may be transferred to the growing hair and stored in the follicle, providing a rough timeline of drug intake events. Head hair grows at rate of approximately 1 to 1.5 cm a month, and so cross sections from different sections of the follicle can give estimates as to when a substance was ingested. Testing for drugs in hair is not standard throughout the population. The darker and coarser the hair the more drug that will be found in the hair. If two people consumed the same amount of drugs, the person with the darker and coarser hair will have more drug in their hair than the lighter haired person when tested. This raises issues of possible racial bias in substance tests with hair samples. Hair samples are analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In ELISA, an antigen must be immobilized to a solid surface and then complexed with an antibody that is linked to an enzyme.

=== Bone Marrow ===
Bone marrow can be used for testing but that depends on the quality and availability of the bones. So far there is no proof that says that certain bones are better than others when it comes to testing. Extracting bone marrow from larger bones is easier than smaller bones. Forensic toxicologists often use bone marrow to find what type poisons used, which can include cocaine or ethanol. Ethanol specifically is one of the most abused drugs worldwide, be it through alcohol consumption and abuse being a leading cause in death. Suicides, car crashes, and a variety of crimes are often performed under severe alcohol influence. The process of ethanol determination allows forensic toxicologists to utilize bone marrow post-mortem and isolate the ethanol level a person had been, and the metabolic speed of breakdown at which can be traced back to time of death.

===Other===
Other bodily fluids and organs may provide samples, particularly samples collected during an autopsy. A common autopsy sample is the gastric contents of the deceased, which can be useful for detecting undigested pills or liquids that were ingested prior to death. In highly decomposed bodies, traditional samples may no longer be available. The vitreous humour from the eye may be used, as the fibrous layer of the eyeball and the eye socket of the skull protects the sample from trauma and adulteration. Other common organs used for toxicology are the brain, liver, and spleen.

==Detection and classification==
Detection of drugs and pharmaceuticals in biological samples is usually done by an initial screening and then a confirmation of the compound(s), which may include a quantitation of the compound(s). The screening and confirmation are usually, but not necessarily, done with different analytical methods. Every analytical method used in forensic toxicology should be carefully tested by performing a validation of the method to ensure correct and indisputable results at all times. The choice of method for testing is highly dependent on what kind of substance one expects to find and the material on which the testing is performed. Customarily, a classification scheme is utilized that places poisons in categories such as: corrosive agents, gases and volatile agents, metallic poisons, non-volatile organic agents, and miscellaneous.

=== Immunoassays ===
Immunoassays require drawing blood and using the antibodies to find a reaction with substances such as drugs. The substances must be specific. It is the most common drug screening technique. Using the targeted drug the test will tell you if it is positive or negative to that drug. There can be 4 results when taking the test. Those results can be a true-positive, a false-negative, a false-positive, and a true-negative.

===Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry===
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a widely used analytical technique for the detection of volatile compounds. Ionization techniques most frequently used in forensic toxicology include electron ionization (EI) or chemical ionization (CI), with EI being preferred in forensic analysis due to its detailed mass spectra and its large library of spectra. However, chemical ionization can provide greater sensitivity for certain compounds that have high electron affinity functional groups.

=== Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ===
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has the capability to analyze compounds that are polar and less volatile. Derivatization is not required for these analytes as it would be in GC-MS, which simplifies sample preparation. As an alternative to immunoassay screening which generally requires confirmation with another technique, LC-MS offers greater selectivity and sensitivity. This subsequently reduces the possibility of a false negative result that has been recorded in immunoassay drug screening with synthetic cathinones and cannabinoids. A disadvantage of LC-MS on comparison to other analytical techniques such as GC-MS, is the high instrumentation cost. However, recent advances in LC-MS have led to higher resolution and sensitivity which assists in the evaluation of spectra to identify forensic analytes.

===Detection of metals===
The compounds suspected of containing a metal are traditionally analyzed by the destruction of the organic matrix by chemical or thermal oxidation. This leaves the metal to be identified and quantified in the inorganic residue, and it can be detected using such methods as the Reinsch test, emission spectroscopy or X-ray diffraction. Unfortunately, while this identifies the metals present it removes the original compound, and so hinders efforts to determine what may have been ingested. The toxic effects of various metallic compounds can vary considerably.

<text>David Gauntlett (born 15 March 1971) is a British sociologist and media theorist, and the author of several books including &quot;Making is Connecting&quot;.

His earlier work concerned contemporary media audiences, and has moved towards a focus on the everyday making and sharing of digital media and social media and the role of these activities in self-identity and building creative cultures.

==Career==
Gauntlett graduated from the University of York in Sociology in 1992. He completed an MA in Women&#x27;s Studies at Lancaster University, then took his PhD. Afterwards, he taught at the University of Leeds from 1993 to 2002. Subsequently, he was appointed Professor of Media and Audiences at Bournemouth University. In 2006 he joined the School of Media, Arts and Design at University of Westminster as Professor of Media and Communications, becoming co-director of the Communications and Media Research Institute (CAMRI), from 2010 to 2015. From 2015 to 2017 he was Professor of Creativity and Design, and the Director of Research for Westminster School of Media, Arts and Design.

In 2018, he took up a role as a Canada Research Chair in the Faculty of Communication and Design at Ryerson University, Toronto.

Gauntlett&#x27;s critique of media &#x27;effects&#x27; studies sparked controversy in 1995, and since then he has published a number of books and research on the role of popular media in people&#x27;s lives. In particular he has focused on the way in which digital media is changing the experience of media in general.

In 2007, he was shortlisted for the &#x27;Young Academic Author of the Year&#x27; award in the Times Higher awards.

In the 2008 book, &quot;Reading Media Theory&quot;, Barlow &amp; Mills state: &quot;David Gauntlett is a prominent, public academic, who has spent his career engaging in research activities which have deliberately involved the public, and have crossed the traditional divide between the academic community and the outside world.&quot;

==New creative research methods==
This approach asks participants to &quot;make&quot; something as part of the research process. Gauntlett&#x27;s work of this kind began with &quot;Video Critical&quot; (1997), in which children were asked to make videos about the environment, and then in a number of projects which are discussed in &quot;Creative Explorations&quot; (2007). As well as studies in which participants have been invited to make video, diaries, collage, and drawings, Gauntlett has explored the use of Lego Serious Play as a tool in sociology and social research. This approach makes use of metaphor and invites participants to build metaphorical models of their identities. The process of making something, and then reflecting upon it, aims to give a more nuanced insight into participants&#x27; feelings or experiences.

This work has been supported by awards from the Arts and Humanities Research Council.

==Media Studies 2.0==
In 2007, Gauntlett published online the article Media Studies 2.0, which created some discussion amongst media studies educators. The article argues that the traditional form of media studies teaching and research fails to recognise the changing media landscape in which the categories of &#x27;audiences&#x27; and &#x27;producers&#x27; blur together, and in which new research methods and approaches are needed. Andy Ruddock has written that Gauntlett&#x27;s &quot;ironic polemic&quot; includes &quot;much to value&quot;, and acknowledges that the argument &quot;is more strategy than creed&quot;, but argues that audiences still exist, and experience mass media specifically &quot;as&quot; audience, and so it would be premature to dispose of the notion of &#x27;audience&#x27; altogether. In other areas there has been less acceptance: Andy Medhurst at Sussex University wrote of Media Studies 2.0, &#x27;Isn&#x27;t it odd that whenever someone purportedly identifies a new paradigm, they see themselves as already a leading practitioner of it?&#x27;

==Making is Connecting==
In 2008 Gauntlett proposed &#x27;the Make and Connect Agenda&#x27;, an attempt to rethink audience studies in the context of media users as producers as well as consumers of media material. This argues that there is a shift from a &#x27;sit-back-and-be-told culture&#x27; to a &#x27;making-and-doing culture&#x27;, and that harnessing creativity in both Web 2.0 and in other everyday creative activities will play a role in tackling environmental problems.

These ideas are developed further in his best-known book &#x27;Making is Connecting: The social meaning of creativity, from DIY and knitting to YouTube and Web 2.0&#x27;.

The Second Edition of &#x27;Making is Connecting&#x27; was published in 2018, and included additional sections on the creative process.

<text>VFA-82, Strike Fighter Squadron 82, known as the &quot;Marauders&quot; was a U.S. Navy strike fighter squadron formerly based at MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina, established in 1967 and deactivated in 2005. Its radio callsign was &quot;Streetcar&quot;.

==History==
Attack Squadron 82 (VA-82) was established on 1 May 1967 as a light attack squadron flying the Vought A-7A Corsair II.

The Marauders made their first deployment aboard during her maiden cruise to the waters off North Vietnam in April 1968. They returned to Southeast Asia in September 1969 aboard .

The Marauders transitioned to the A-7E in August 1970, but in late spring of 1972, VA-82 was forced to revert to the A-7C due to unexpected problems with the A-7E&#x27;s TF-41 engines. The Marauders then deployed from June 1972 to March 1973 aboard USS &quot;America&quot; for a ten-month combat cruise.

On that deployment, VA-82 played a role in the attack that destroyed the Thanh Hoa Bridge, a vital link in the North Vietnamese Army supply lines and a target that seemed indestructible during the Vietnam War. Four A-7Cs from VA-82 successfully delivered of high explosives with two planes carrying two Walleyes, while two other carried two, 2,000 lb Mk 84 bombs. In a simultaneous attack, the centre piling on the bridge was hit, and the span broke in half. After this, the Thanh Hoa bridge was considered permanently destroyed and removed from the target list.

The squadron made several deployments to the Mediterranean during the 1970s, and while doing so received many of the Navy&#x27;s most prestigious awards including the Wade McClusky Award as most outstanding attack squadron and Battle &quot;E&quot; in 1976. In 1975 the Marauders deployed aboard on her maiden cruise.

The squadron completed its last cruise with the A-7E Corsair II in June 1987. On 13 July 1987, VA-82 was redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron 82 (VFA-82). With the delivery of the first aircraft in November 1987, VFA-82 became the first F/A-18C squadron.

In 1990, VFA-82 escorted around the horn of South America on its way to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for modernization. December 1990 found VFA-82 once again aboard USS &quot;America,&quot; participating in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. The Marauders flew 597 combat sorties, 1308.9 combat hours and delivered over 1.2 million pounds of ordnance over Iraq. In December 1993, the Marauders returned to USS &quot;America&quot; for a six-month deployment during which VFA-82 participated in Operation Southern Watch in Iraq, Operation Deny Flight and Operation Sharp Guard in Bosnia and Operation Restore Hope in Somalia.

From August 1995 to February 1996, the Marauders joined USS &quot;America&quot; for her last cruise. From October 1997 through April 1998, the squadron deployed on board to the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch. During 1998 the Marauders operated from the decks of three U.S. aircraft carriers and visited seven countries. In August 1999, the Marauders bid farewell to NAS Cecil Field and relocated to NAS Jacksonville for the two months prior to deployment. In September 1999, the Marauders deployed on board in support of Operation Southern Watch. Upon completion of the six-month deployment on board &quot;Big John,&quot; the Marauders relocated to their new home, MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina in March 2000.
Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Marauders deployed on 18 September, steaming for the Arabian Sea and Afghanistan. During four months of combat operations, VFA-82 delivered over of ordnance and totaled over 3000 hours in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The Marauders returned to Beaufort on 28 March 2002. The squadron had logged an unprecedented 159 days continuously deployed, the majority of which were combat operations.

During the latter half of 2002, the squadron trained against F-16 Falcons in Burlington, Vermont, and at one point were detached to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, Puerto Rico; NAS Fallon; and NAS Key West. During the NAS Key West detachment, Marauders pilots had the opportunity to fly against German Air Force MiG-29s. VFA-82 was disestablished effective 30 September 2005 in accordance with a directive issued on 5 July 2005.

<doc id="1227469" wikidata="Q4863459" url="?curid=1227469" title="Barrhaven">
<text>Barrhaven is a suburb of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located about southwest of the city&#x27;s downtown core. Prior to amalgamation with Ottawa in 2001, Barrhaven was part of the City of Nepean. Its population as of the Canada 2021 Census was 103,234.

==Geography==
Barrhaven is approximately bounded to the north by the Greenbelt, to the east by the Rideau River, to the west by Highway 416, and to the south by the new Half Moon Bay development along Cambrian Road south of the Jock River. The area is diagonally bisected by CN rail tracks. Barrhaven is surrounded by rural areas and farmland, with the exception of the growing Riverside South area across the Rideau River. Directly south of Barrhaven is Manotick, a commuter town of the city. Barrhaven&#x27;s nickname is Farrhaven due to its far distance to and from the city centre of Downtown Ottawa.

Barrhaven is divided into several areas: Barrhaven proper or Old Barrhaven is the westernmost part of the neighbourhood, lying between Cedarview Road and Greenbank Road. New residential development is expanding the west side of Old Barrhaven between Cedarview and Strandherd Drive. Also included in this area is a triangle of land east of Greenbank between Fallowfield Road and the railway tracks known as Knollsbrook or The Triangle. South of this is the area known as Longfields, which stretches south to Strandherd and east to Woodroffe Avenue. Sandwiched between the railway tracks, Jockvale Road, Greenbank and Strandherd is the neighbourhood of Barrhaven on the Green. East of Woodroffe, next to the Rideau River, is the neighbourhood of Davidson Heights. South of Strandherd and east of Greenbank is a new community known as Chapman Mills. As Prince of Wales Drive approaches Longfields Drive, there is a thriving community known as Stonebridge that is located beside the Stonebridge Golf &amp; Country Club.

==History==

The Barrhaven area was long inhabited by First Nations peoples, and the modern Jockvale Road follows an ancient path that was originally a trail through the wilderness. In the 19th century the area became populated by European farmers as the area was divided into a number of rural homesteads.

The old Barrhaven School House located at Jockvale and Strandherd was in built in 1906. Today, the school stands as a historic site. In 1911, the Canadian Northern Railway built a rail line from Ottawa to Toronto through the area. Fast passenger service was offered for many years from Fallowfield Station (near the intersection of Strandherd Dr and Cedarview Rd) to Ottawa and beyond After many years of absence, passenger rail service was reintroduced to the area by Via Rail in the fall of 2002 through a new Fallowfield Station located at the intersection of Fallowfield Road and Woodroffe Avenue.

Modern Barrhaven was established in the 1960s, one of a group of new suburbs built outside the Greenbelt from the main city of Ottawa. Building in the area was begun by Mel Barr, for whom the community is named. Barr had originally purchased a farm with the intent of constructing a horse racing track. However the Rideau Carleton Raceway was built further to the east, and Barr instead decided to develop his land for housing. In 1968-69 Barrhaven Public School was built as the very first public school in Barrhaven.

Barrhaven was incorporated into the City of Nepean in 1978 and subsequently grew rapidly into a community of several tens of thousands of people. Commercial centres were slower to arrive. In 1990 the area was served by a single grocery store, had no movie theatre, and not even a bar. This has changed with the opening in 1991 of the vast Barrhaven Town Centre complex of big box stores and smaller commercial establishments, as well as a few smaller shopping malls. The 1990s also saw the influx of high-tech companies into the area (such as JDS Uniphase and Nortel), and the growth of the Public Service in the National Capital Region. The area got its first high school in 1998 when Mother Teresa High School (Catholic) opened, followed by John McCrae Secondary School (public) in 1999. Barrhaven gained its third high school in 2002 when St. Joseph High School (Catholic) opened. In September 2009, Longfields-Davidson Heights Secondary School (Public) opened. In 2011 École secondaire catholique Pierre-Savard opened.

In 2024, Barrhaven was the site of the city&#x27;s worst mass killing in its history when six people were killed with a knife-like weapon.

==Character==

Like most North American suburbs built so quickly and so recently, Barrhaven has a very uniform feel, especially considering how big it is. Almost every street consists of town houses with some streets having comparatively large suburban houses. In the older parts of Barrhaven, the streets are curvilinear, never forming a grid as they do in older parts of Ottawa. The area is very suburban and tends to attract families.

===Features and amenities===
Barrhaven contains several public and Catholic schools and numerous parks and playgrounds, mainly built in since 2000. It is also home to the Walter Baker Sports Centre which contains a library and other facilities. The main commercial district, called the Chapman Mills Marketplace, surrounds the intersection of Strandherd Drive and Greenbank Road. It hosts a seven-screen cinema, Loblaws, Wal-Mart, Indigo Books and Music, Staples, Winners, Homesense, Farmboy, Sport Chek, Starbucks, Your Independent Grocer, and Best Buy, among others. The Minto Recreation Complex, a new multi-use community centre at the corner of Cambrian and Greenbank, opened in 2014. A major employment district was established in 2015 in the area west of Strandherd Drive adjacent to Highway 416, known as the CitiGate corporate campus. A Costco store has opened in fall of 2016, including several other retail establishments.

==Transportation==
Barrhaven is served by a triangle of bus rapid transit lines, with OC Transpo routes 75, 74, and 99, and is very near to the terminus of the Trillium Line at Limebank station. The suburb has seven local bus routes which provide coverage: 80, 170, 171, 173, 175, and 176 . These routes serve the local streets of Barrhaven as well as serving several stations on the Transitway network where a transfer can be made to Ottawa&#x27;s Rapid Transit system with Route 75, 74 and 99. There are six express bus routes, 270, 271, 272, 273, 277, and 278 that provide direct service to downtown Ottawa during the morning rush hour and from downtown during the afternoon rush hour; travel time is approximately 30 minutes. Previously, these routes were numbered 70, 71, 72 (previously 76), 73 and 77, but were changed in 2017 as part the 2018 On Track LRT project. Route 176 runs from Barrhaven Centre to Manotick, stopping in the growing Stonebridge community before travelling on the lower half of Jockvale before connecting with Prince of Wales Drive.

Intercity Via Rail connections can be made at Fallowfield railway station to Montreal and Toronto.

Until 2006, it had been planned that the north–south light-rail O-Train (today&#x27;s Trillium Line) would be extended to the centre of Barrhaven near Riocan Marketplace via Riverside South. The project was cancelled on December 14, 2006, by Ottawa City Council, which decided to focus on building rail-based rapid transit lines in the inner city instead. Rail-based rapid transit to Barrhaven is not expected to be introduced until after 2031, when the three lines in the inner city are expected to be completed.

On January 2, 2007, OC Transpo opened the Strandherd Transitway Station and Park &amp; Ride lot in Barrhaven. Directly across from the Chapman Mills Marketplace Wal-Mart &amp; TD Bank, the facility has parking space for about 330 cars. It was built to help with overcrowding at the Fallowfield Station and meet the increased demand for park and ride spaces in the community. Rapid transit route 75 takes approximately 10 minutes to travel between Fallowfield Station and Strandherd Station, and 2 minutes between Strandherd Station and Barrhaven Centre Station. The Province of Ontario funded one-third of the $5 million cost.

In April 2011, the transitway (BRT) network was expanded in Barrhaven. One feature was the extension of Route 94 (now Route 74) to the intersection of Woodroffe and Strandherd. A new stretch of BRT was also constructed between Fallowfield and Strandherd to reduce travel times on Route 95 (Route 75 since 2019). 
In September 2014, a new BRT route was established on Chapman Mills Drive, using a &quot;graveyard&quot; median from the canceled south-western LRT route. Route 99 starts at Barrhaven Centre and using new Beatrice Station proceeds to Greenboro Station, the O-Train Line 2 terminus, at non-peak hours, via Riverside South (Vimy Memorial Bridge) and Leitrim Station. At peak hours, the 99 goes all the way to Hurdman Station via the Southeast Transitway, connecting to the O-Train Line 1.

<doc id="1227470" wikidata="Q35881" url="?curid=1227470" title="Kyrgyz som">
<text>The som (; ; ISO code: KGS; sign: ⃀ ()) is the currency of Kyrgyzstan. It is subdivided into 100 tıyın. Initially, only banknotes were issued, but coins were introduced in 2008. The currency features denominations ranging from 1 tıyın to 5000 som. 

The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic oversees its issuance, and various commemorative coins have been released to celebrate cultural and historical events. The banknotes display notable Kyrgyz historical figures and symbols, with periodic updates to enhance security features such as watermarks, holograms, and microprinting. Over time, higher denomination notes have been introduced to manage inflation.

==Etymology==

The official name of the Soviet ruble in Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Uzbek was &quot;soum&quot;, and this name appeared written on the back of banknotes, among the texts for the value of the note in all 15 official languages of the USSR. The word &quot;som&quot; (alternatively transliterated &quot;soum&quot; or &quot;sum&quot;) means &quot;pure&quot; in Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uyghur and Uzbek, as well as in many other Turkic languages. The word implies &quot;pure&quot; silver or gold and thus is similar in etymology to sterling.

===Currency symbol===

The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic approved an underlined С (es) as the official currency symbol for the som in February 2017. It is represented in Unicode as .

==History==
After the collapse of the Soviet Union attempts were made by most republics to maintain a common currency. 
Certain politicians were hoping to at the very least maintain &quot;special relations&quot; among former Soviet republics, or the &quot;near abroad&quot;. Another reason were the economic considerations for maintaining the rouble zone. The wish to preserve the strong trade relations between former Soviet republics was considered the most important goal.

The break-up of the Soviet Union was not accompanied by any formal changes in monetary arrangements. The Central Bank of Russia was authorized to take over the State Bank of the USSR (Gosbank) on 1 January 1992. It continued to ship Soviet notes and coins to the central banks of the fourteen newly independent countries, which had formerly been the main branches of Gosbank in the republics.
The political situation, however, was not favourable for maintaining a common currency. Maintaining a common currency requires a strong political consensus in respect to monetary and fiscal targets, a common institution in charge of implementing these targets, and some minimum of common legislation (concerning the banking and foreign exchange regulations). These conditions were far from being met amidst the turbulent economic and political situation.

During the first half of 1992, a monetary union with 15 independent states all using the rouble existed. Since it was clear that the situation would not last, each of them was using its position as &quot;free-riders&quot; to issue huge amounts of money in the form of credit. As a result, some countries were issuing coupons in order to &quot;protect&quot; their markets from buyers from other states. The Russian central bank responded in July 1992 by setting up restrictions to the flow of credit between Russia and other states. The final collapse of the rouble zone began when Russia pulled out with the exchange of banknotes by the Central Bank of Russia on Russian territory at the end of July 1993.

The Kyrgyz som was introduced on 10 May 1993, replacing the Russian ruble which itself replaced the Soviet ruble at a rate of 1 som = RUR 200. Initially only banknotes were issued, coins were not introduced until 2008.

==Coins==
Circulation coins were first introduced in January 2008, making Kyrgyzstan second to last of the former Soviet republics to issue them. Belarus became the last. This move came with growing demand from vendors for coins, especially from slot machine industries and those desiring a more efficient system for collecting fare money.

The coins were issued in denominations of 10 and 50 tıyın and 1, 3, and 5 som. A 10 som coin was issued a year later in 2009.

All coins are minted by the Kazakhstan mint in Ust-Kamenogorsk and bear some resemblance to coins of the Russian Federation.

===Commemorative coins===
There are several commemorative non circulation coins struck in silver and gold, and a special collector&#x27;s 1 tıyın piece struck in brass.
Starting in 1995, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic has issued a large number of commemorative coins intended for collectors. They are not used in everyday circulation.

==Banknotes==
On 10 May 1993, the government issued 1, 10, and 50 tıyın notes and the Kyrgyzstan Bank issued notes for 1, 5, and 20 som. 
In 1994, the Kyrgyz Bank issued a second series of notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 som. 
A third series followed from 1997 onwards in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 som. 
A fourth series was issued in 2009 and 2010 in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, and 5,000 som. Several commemorative banknotes intended for collectors were also issued.

===First series (1993)===
Notes valued 1 and 10 tıyın with serial numbers KT and ZT were issued in 1999. 
50 tıyıns notes with serial numbers KT and ZT were issued in 2001. All others in 1993.

Notes of the first series were designed by Dmitry Lysogorov and A. P. Tsygank.
They were printed by De La Rue in Great Britain.

Notes valued 1, 10, and 50 tıyın stayed in use until coins were introduced in January 2008. Banknotes of 1, 5, and 20 som of the first series were gradually withdrawn from circulation and replaced with banknotes of the second series starting in 1994.

===Second series (1994–1995)===
The second series of banknotes followed in 1994-1995 when &quot;the banknotes of the stabilization period&quot; were issued. These banknotes had a better counterfeit protection than the banknotes of the first series.

=== Third series (1997–2005) ===
Starting in 1997, a new series of banknotes was introduced with similar themes, but enhanced design, compared to the previous series.

In January 2008 coins of 1 and 5 som and in December 2009 coins of 10 som were introduced. As a result, production of banknotes of these values ceased. The banknotes were however not removed from circulation, but are instead being phased out. In January 2008 the Kyrgyz National Bank estimated that within 2 years the 1 and 5 som banknotes would have almost completely disappeared from circulation.

=== Fourth series (2009–2016) ===
In 2009 the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic issued a 5,000 som note. Later new editions for 20, 50, and 100 som denominations followed. Among other things, these notes have enhanced security features compared to the previous series.

=== Fifth series (2023) ===
====Commemorative banknotes====
In October 2014 banknotes commemorating the 150th birthdate of Toktogul Satylganov and the 100th birthdate of Alykul Osmonov were issued for sale to collectors. Only 3,000 of each were printed.

A commemorative 2,000 som banknote in honor of the 25th anniversary of independence and the introduction of the som was issued in November 2017.

<text>Illinois Route 120 (IL 120) is a major east–west state highway in northeastern Illinois. It runs from U.S. Route 14 near Woodstock to Illinois Route 131 in Waukegan. It travels a distance of and is one of the few roads that provides direct access from McHenry County to Interstate 94 (Tri-State Tollway) in Lake County. Throughout its length, it shifts between two and four lanes as it passes through a setting that consists of open rural areas, as well as larger developments and heavy congestion.

Although small capacity expansions have been made over time, a lengthy two lane section of road in the Grayslake vicinity has yet to see any major expansion. This key segment has been the subject of much debate regarding the greater traffic flow across north-central Lake County. In October 2009, a special council approved a unified vision for a plan for most of the Lake County portion of Illinois 120, which includes a long discussed bypass around downtown Grayslake.

==Route description==
===McHenry County===

Beginning at its western terminus at a rural unsignalized intersection with U.S. Route 14 (Northwest Highway), IL 120 starts out as a two lane road just west of the city of Woodstock. This section is known as Washington Street as it heads in a southeast direction and enters the outer residential neighborhoods of Woodstock. In this area, the road curves due east, crosses the Metra Union Pacific/Northwest Line tracks near the station, then briefly heads north before turning once more to the northwest. Immediately after doing so, it passes a signalized intersection with IL 47 (Seminary Avenue/Eastwood Drive) before traveling north of the McHenry County Fairgrounds and then heading out of the Woodstock area and back into a prairie setting. The road then curves back to the north and then takes a right turn at an unsignalized intersection where it continues generally east for the remainder of its length.

Before reaching the McHenry area a little more than four miles east, the road passes through two signalized intersections, some light forests, and some sparse residential developments. Now entering the busier city of McHenry, it takes on the name Elm Street and widens to four lanes west of Ringwood Road. Light commercial buildings with neighborhoods behind them line the roadway until the crossing of the McHenry Branch of the Union Pacific/Northwest Line near the McHenry Metra station. At the next intersection, IL 120 meets with IL 31 (Front Street/Richmond Road) where they briefly run concurrently for less than a half mile. It next travels over the Fox River,
passes by another section of commercial business, and then returns to a quieter setting that features a mix of open areas, neighborhoods, small business, and Lily Lake.

===Lake County===

Continuing its somewhat rural journey to the east, Illinois 120 becomes known as Belvidere Road as it enters Lake County and the town of Lakemoor which is soon followed by the busy intersection of U.S. Route 12/Illinois Route 59 (Rand Road). The road then heads into the town of Volo which features land developed with businesses and homes on the south and undeveloped land on the north. This is also where it passes the intersection of the western terminus of IL 60 and then narrows down to two lanes. The road then runs past the Baxter Healthcare facility and proceeds into the Round Lake area where it goes by the Nippersink Forest Preserve on the north and then between two residential developments. For just a slight instance, it travels through Round Lake Park before entering the town of Hainesville where it passes the Metra Milwaukee District/North Line tracks, the eastern terminus of IL 134, and a few businesses before going into the more populated city of Grayslake. Neighborhoods and occasional small businesses lie north and south of the road until it crosses Canadian National Railway (CN) tracks (used by the Metra North Central Service) immediately before an intersection with IL 83 (Barron Boulevard). After passing a shopping plaza on the south, the next stretch of roadway contains a mix of other businesses and residential developments, as well as a branch of the Lake Forest Hospital, while also widening to four lanes on its approach to a major junction with U.S. Route 45. Past the intersection, the road passes a commercial plaza and again narrows back to two lanes before going by more neighborhoods on the north, and some open areas that contain the Almond Marsh Forest Preserve on the south.

At this point it widens to become a four-lane divided highway west of Almond Road and it enters the southern part of Gurnee where travels near the Merit Club golf course which lies to the south of a &quot;T&quot; intersection with Hunt Club Road. The eastbound approach to this intersection features the only dual-left turn lanes on the entire length of Illinois 120. The remaining section of highway, although only briefly limited-access, does have limited signalized intersections which keeps traffic flowing at a more constant rate. It first passes under a grade separation at Illinois Route 21 (Milwaukee Avenue) and goes over the Des Plaines River before forming an interchange with Interstate 94 (Tri-State Tollway). Only southbound access is permitted to I-94; northbound access is available via IL 21. It next enters part of the Waukegan area and shortly encounters an at-grade intersection with O&#x27;Plaine Road and then continues with more grade separation at the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) tracks and Greenleaf Avenue. Interchanges with IL 43 (Waukegan Road) and U.S. Route 41 (Skokie Highway) closely follow one another with a brief transition into Park City located between these two junctions. It can be confusing in this area as there is no direct access to northbound US-41 or southbound IL-43, which terminates immediately north at US-41. Illinois 120 loses its divided highway status after traveling over the Union Pacific (UP) tracks and passing by its last stretch of businesses as it reenters Waukegan. It soon reaches the commercially developed, signalized intersection of Illinois Route 131 (Green Bay Road) where it terminates as a state route; Belvidere Road continues east as a local road.

==History==
State Bond Issue (SBI) Route 120 originally ran from Havana to Mason City in west-central Illinois. In 1939 this became IL 119, and in 1951, U.S. Route 136. In the meantime, in 1941 Illinois 120 replaced Illinois Route 20 to avoid confusion with nearby U.S. Route 20. In 1972, the designation was removed east of IL 131. During the early 1990s, plans came about to widen 5.7 miles of roadway in McHenry and Lake counties. The project extended from River Road in McHenry to east of Illinois 60. These plans also included the construction of a short southern bypass around the town of Volo. By 1994, the work had concluded which resulted in four concrete travel lanes. In 2000, a $4.6 million construction project was completed at the intersection of US-45. The changes that took place to Illinois 120 were: expanding to two lanes in each direction and adding a right turn lane to the eastbound approach. The most recent major construction that has taken place was between August 2007 and July 2008 at the interchange with I-94. The work consisted of demolishing the two bridge structures that travel over the tollway and replacing them with new ones.

==Future==
In recent years there has been much discussion on how to improve the east–west traffic flow throughout north-central Lake County. IL 120 enters Lake County from the west as a four-lane highway and then becomes a two-lane highway less than three miles east, just past IL 60 and later becomes a four lane divided highway west of Hunt Club Road. Since there is heavy traffic from nearby Interstate 94 to the east as well as traffic traveling to and from McHenry County in the west, some believe this gap should become four lanes. As part of this expansion plan, a 7-mile southern bypass in Grayslake would be constructed. This has since become known as the &quot;120 bypass&quot;.

This project is closely related to another long delayed Lake county transportation project; the IL 53 extension. The currently stalled project has been planned to extend the limited-access expressway, which carries IL 53 and terminates at Lake-Cook Road, north to connect to the 120 bypass, and then branch off toward U.S. Route 12 to the west and Interstate 94 to the east. If the project were ever built, the east–west 120 bypass would likely be built as a limited-access expressway to connect with the proposed north–south Illinois 53 extension which is also limited-access. The entire scope of this project; starting on Illinois 120 at Interstate 94, continuing west on the 120 bypass, and connecting with the Illinois 53 extension would provide a direct route for commuters in northern Lake County to gain access to the western and southwestern Chicago suburbs. Since there have been many delays over the decades on how to proceed with this extension, the 120 bypass project moved forward on its own as an independent project.

In 2006, a feasibility study got underway by a special corridor planning council which was composed of groups from nearby communities and local government officials and took public input. Initially, the main focus for the public was to provide feedback for the road character or type of road. The alternatives considered were: a four lane roundabout boulevard, four lane signalized boulevard, six lane signalized arterial, and six lane expressway. In December 2008, it was revealed that the four lane boulevard option was selected in an 11–2 vote over an expressway, however it still remained open whether or not roundabouts would be used in place of traffic signals at intersections. The cost of the project was estimated at $521 million. In May 2009, the preferred roadway alignment was selected.

On October 14, 2009, the Route 120 Corridor Planning Council Governance Board came to a consensus and approved a vision for the project which recommends that the bypass be built as a four lane arterial highway with limited-access. The next step is for the Illinois Department of Transportation to begin a Phase I Preliminary Engineering Study.

In 2012, the Blue Ribbon Advisory Council revived the 120 expressway alternative as a tollway, rather than a roundabout or signalized boulevard, and proposed the Route 53/120 expressway plan to IDOT as a four-lane, completely below grade tollway with a speed limit of 45 mph. The proposed roadway would include such features as a multi-use path, bioswale grassy median, landscaped raised berms, in-pavement lighting, all electronic tolling, and innovative interchange designs.

In 2016, Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor withdrew his support for the project, issuing a statement indicating his belief that &quot;financial and political realities have become insurmountable&quot; and would prevent the extension from happening in the environmental way envisioned in the 2012 report. Despite the withdrawn support, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority made no changes to the plan to conduct an environmental impact study, with Chairman Bob Schillerstrom stating &quot;many of the questions that Chairman Lawlor raised would be answered&quot; by such a study.

On May 25, 2017, the Illinois Tollway board unanimously approved a $25 million expenditure for an environmental impact study of the proposed northward extension of Illinois Route 53 into Lake County. Opponents continued to criticize the project as expensive and harmful to the environment, while supporters believe it will provide congestion relief and a boon to the economies of Lake and McHenry counties. The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization, included the Route 53 extension in a list of &quot;nine wasteful highway boondoggles,&quot; pegging the cost at $2.3 billion and saying it &quot;would jeopardize the environment and lacks a viable funding plan.&quot;

<doc id="1227476" wikidata="Q2499068" url="?curid=1227476" title="Degrassi">
<text>Degrassi is a Canadian teen drama television franchise created by Kit Hood and Linda Schuyler, that follows the lives of youths attending the eponymous secondary school in Toronto. Each entry since 1987 has taken place in the same continuity. Outside of television, the franchise comprises a variety of other media, such as companion novels, graphic novels, documentaries, soundtracks, and non-fiction works.

In 1979, Schuyler and Hood adapted the Kay Chorao book &quot;Ida Makes a Movie&quot; into a live-action short film, and expanded upon its universe with a series of subsequent installments until 1982, when it evolved into the critically acclaimed children&#x27;s series &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street&quot;, which aired for 26 episodes until 1986. That year, the duo developed &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, which focused on the teenage demographic they felt was underserved by contemporary media. Running for three seasons (1987–1989), it became one of Canada&#x27;s most popular television series and was highly regarded for its realistic portrayal of adolescence and serious social issues; this was followed by &quot;Degrassi High&quot; (1989–1991), which chronicled the cast&#x27;s high school years and met similar critical and commercial success. The initial run of the franchise ended with the controversial television film &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; (1992), which received mixed reviews but drew double the average viewership of the series, followed by the docuseries &quot;Degrassi Talks&quot; (1992), in which actors spoke to teens nationwide about various issues. 

In the 1990s, the series increasingly developed a cult following through re-runs, and a successful televised cast reunion in 1999 helped spark the franchise&#x27;s revival with &quot;&quot; (2001–2015), which originally aired on CTV in Canada and The N in the United States. It focused on a new generation of students, augmented by select original characters in supporting roles. It was similarly critically and commercially successful, especially in the United States, and launched the careers of musician Drake and actress Nina Dobrev. After nine seasons, &quot;The Next Generation&quot; was rebranded to &quot;Degrassi&quot; and changed to a telenovela-style format. After five more seasons, it was cancelled in 2015. It was superseded by &quot;&quot; (2016–2017), a short-lived Netflix co-production geared toward Generation Z, whose cancellation was revealed in 2019. In January 2022, a new series was announced for HBO Max in which Schuyler would not be involved; it was cancelled in November following a lack of updates, though WildBrain later indicated that they still intend to produce the series.

&quot;Degrassi&quot; is regarded as one of Canada&#x27;s greatest television achievements and is one of the most successful media franchises in Canadian history. It has been widely acclaimed over its four-decade history for its approach to adolescence and serious issues faced by adolescents. It has courted controversy on several occasions for episodes depicting teenage pregnancy, abortion, and LGBT issues, with various episodes facing some form of editing or censorship outside of Canada since the late 1980s. Among the awards and accolades it has received include numerous Gemini Awards, two International Emmys in 1985 and 1987, and a Peabody Award in 2010. The franchise was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in December 2023.

=== 1979–1986: &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street&quot; ===

In 1976, Linda Schuyler, a Grade 7 and Grade 8 media teacher at Earl Grey Senior Public School in Toronto, founded Playing With Time Inc. with her partner Kit Hood. Schuyler had met Hood, who had a career in editing television commercials, when she needed help from an experienced editor to save the &quot;muddled footage&quot; of one of her projects. As a media teacher, Schuyler encouraged her students to use video as a narrative tool. Bruce Mackey, Earl Grey&#x27;s librarian and a friend of Schuyler, procured her several books about filmmaking upon her request, one being &quot;Ida Makes a Movie,&quot; by the American author Kay Chorao. Mackey did not realize that it was a children&#x27;s book and discarded it, but Schuyler developed an interest in adapting the book into a film. Before leaving, Schuyler sought legal advice from Stephen Stohn, a young entertainment lawyer who had recently graduated from law school, and who would eventually become her producing partner and husband.

Stohn recalled in his 2018 memoir &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; that he advised Schuyler that being out of print, buying the rights to the book on her own would be &quot;relatively straightforward&quot;, and that involving lawyers would make the process &quot;unnecessarily complicated.&quot; Stohn instead gave Schuyler a boilerplate form for permission to take with her to New York. Schuyler purchased the rights for $200. The feline characters were changed into human children, and the story was also largely repurposed. The film featured production techniques that Schuyler and Kit Hood felt were missing from children&#x27;s programming: it was shot in a cinéma vérité style, with handheld camera work and entirely on-location shooting. Mackey offered his home, 98 De Grassi Street, as a filming location.

&quot;Ida Makes A Movie&quot; premiered on CBC Television on December 8, 1979. Over the next couple of years, the network ordered two more short films. By 1982, they ordered five more episodes, developing the series of short films into a television series named &quot;The Kids Of Degrassi Street.&quot; In 1985, the episode &quot;Griff Gets A Hand&quot; (which starred future &quot;Wheels&quot; actor Neil Hope as Griff) received an International Emmy for Best Program for Children and Young People.

=== 1986–1990: &quot;Degrassi Junior High, Degrassi High,&quot; and international success ===
A new &quot;Degrassi&quot; series began development in 1986, this time with new characters and centered around the fictional eponymous school near the same street. The first actor to audition for the new &quot;Degrassi&quot; series was Pat Mastroianni, who would later win the role of Joey Jeremiah. Several of the actors from &quot;The Kids Of Degrassi Street&quot; would return with new roles, including Neil Hope, Stacie Mistysyn, Anais Granofsky, and Sarah Charlesworth. It was at this time that Playing With Time Inc. started a repertory company, with fifty children selected from auditions. The workshops would be repeated at the beginning of production for each season, as new cast members joined, and existing cast members underwent more advanced workshops. The repertory company also meant that even major characters could be relegated to the background if not the main focus of the episode, which according to Kathryn Ellis, was &quot;nearly unheard-of on other television shows.&quot; Conversely, a background character could later be given more lines or a full role.

The cast would have significant input into the writing of their characters, with Schuyler seeking opinions during every read-through, and cast members often talking about their experiences to writer Yan Moore, who would eventually adapt said experiences to their characters. The resulting series, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, premiered on CBC on January 18, 1987. The series marked the beginning of the franchise&#x27;s canon, as characters from this series would appear as adults in later installments. The show also aired on PBS in the United States starting from September 1987. The show would feature one of the franchise&#x27;s most well-known and influential storylines, in which 14 year old Christine &quot;Spike&quot; Nelson, portrayed by Amanda Stepto, becomes pregnant. The episode in which she discovers her pregnancy, &quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot;&quot;,&quot; the eleventh episode of the show&#x27;s first season, would win an International Emmy, for which Emma Nelson, Spike&#x27;s daughter and central character of the later series, was named. The popularity of the show led to international publicity tours by members of the cast throughout North America and parts of Europe.

Upon its debut, it immediately garnered critical acclaim in Canada, where it was considered to be an alternative to the American sitcoms of the era that were perceived as unrealistic and heavy-handed in their portrayal of societal issues. Although not as well known in the United States, it drew similar praise from the American media. Initially aired on Sundays at 5:00pm, Canadian critics believed the show deserved a better timeslot; Ivan Fecan, then the programming chief for CBC, was also a champion of the series, and had the series moved to primetime on Mondays at 8:30pm, in between &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; and &quot;Newhart&quot;. When Fecan called Schuyler to inform her of the move, she reportedly disagreed, feeling that the series wasn&#x27;t ready for prime time. She eventually agreed to the decision, under the condition that if the move was unsuccessful, the series wouldn&#x27;t be cancelled and instead be moved back to its original timeslot. After its move to prime time, the viewership increased by 40%, and by August 1988, it had become the highest-rated Canadian-made drama in Canada. The series also premiered in the United Kingdom on BBC1 in 1988, where it drew in a reported six million viewers, making it the highest-rated children&#x27;s television series in the country and the show&#x27;s largest audience. However, in spite of a publicity tour by actress Amanda Stepto, controversial episodes from its first season, including those centred on Stepto&#x27;s character&#x27;s pregnancy, were aired in a later timeslot on BBC2, and the network did not air its second and third seasons. The series established the franchise&#x27;s popularity and longevity. By the time its follow-up began, it amassed over a million viewers weekly in Canada. In November 1988, after the premiere of the third and final season of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, Linda Schuyler alluded to the potential of a high-school followup when discussing the direction of the franchise with the Montreal Gazette, although she was unsure if it would go forward. It was decided to continue into high school as the actors were becoming older, which would also make way for more controversial topics, including abortion, which was addressed in the series premiere. According to Schuyler: &quot;As the kids get older, the only way we can remain true to this age group is by growing with them. Therefore, the issues get more complex.&quot;

In the series finale of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, the titular school is destroyed in a fire. To keep the entire cast together, a creative decision was made to move the younger students displaced by the fire to the new school to join those that had already graduated. Conversely, the grade 7 students introduced in the third season of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; were accelerated to grade 9 for an unspecified reason. To give the series a &quot;harder-edged feel&quot;, several older characters were introduced. Reflecting the growing independence of the aging characters, &quot;Degrassi High&quot; began to give more focus to the characters&#x27; lives outside of school, with scenes taking place at nighttime, on the street, or at the characters&#x27; jobs. In contrast to &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, in which the extras were still made known to the viewers, the newer series would include a team of &quot;extra extras&quot;, who would simply appear for no other purpose than to fill the background. &quot;Degrassi High&quot; notably tackled HIV/AIDS, with the character Dwayne Myers (Darrin Brown), and suicide with the character Claude Tanner (David Armin-Parcells).

Despite continued success and demand from CBC, WGBH was finding it increasingly difficult to fund the show from the children&#x27;s department of PBS, and were forced to back out. Combined with creative exhaustion, it was decided to end &quot;Degrassi&quot; &quot;High&quot; after its second season, and filming wrapped in October 1990. In November 1990, Schuyler explained to the Canadian Press that they wanted to end the series &quot;while we were still feeling good about what we were doing.&quot; In addition, she noted that most of the cast were occupied with post-secondary education, and that she felt the show had already tackled what they had aimed to. Schuyler informed Ivan Fecan, then the programming chief of CBC and long-time supporter of &quot;Degrassi&quot;, of their decision to end the series and suggested a feature-length finale as a compromise, which Fecan enthusiastically accepted and offered funding for.

=== 1991–1998: &quot;Degrassi Talks,&quot; &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;, and hiatus ===

During development of the television movie in early 1991, six Degrassi actors – Amanda Stepto, Pat Mastroianni, Stacie Mistysyn, Rebecca Haines, Siluck Saysanasy, and Neil Hope – travelled around Canada to interview teenagers about various health and social issues for the six-part documentary series &quot;Degrassi Talks&quot;, which aired on CBC in six installments from February 29 to March 30, 1992, each tackling a specific issue that the series had portrayed. Each actor was chosen specifically for their character&#x27;s relation to each topic. The series was personally funded by then-Minister of Health Benoît Bouchard, who contributed $350,000. The six actors conducted interviews in 26 cities, including bigger and smaller towns. The series also featured archive footage from the series, vox pop interviews and on-screen statistics. While it was well received by critics, it proved less popular with teenage viewers, who felt it to be redundant and at times perpetuating certain stereotypes.

Principal photography began on &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;, the television movie, on July 21, 1991, and it premiered on CBC on January 5, 1992. The movie, which mostly focused on a love triangle between Joey, Caitlin (Mistysyn), and Tessa Campanelli (Kirsten Bourne), garnered a positive, yet mixed reception. It garnered controversy for its unusual characterization of certain popular characters as well as the catastrophic events experienced by other characters. It was also notable for its use of the word &quot;fuck&quot;, first said by Stefan Brogren and then Stacie Mistysyn, that are claimed to be the first uses of the word in Canadian television history. Despite the mixed reception, the film drew an estimated 2.3 million viewers: double that of the average audience that &quot;Degrassi High&quot; received. The movie did not air in the United States until over two years later, when it premiered on PBS on June 20, 1994.

Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood dissolved their partnership in the early 1990s but continued to own Playing With Time. In July 1998, Hood revealed the company was &quot;virtually dormant.&quot; He continued to rent the company&#x27;s former offices as a battered women&#x27;s shelter, before retiring to Nova Scotia for the remainder of his life. In 1992, Schuyler and Stephen Stohn founded Epitome Pictures, the company which would produce all future &quot;Degrassi&quot; series. In 1994, Epitome Pictures produced the television movie &quot;X-Rated&quot;, which centred on a group of young adults living in an apartment complex; the movie starred Stacie Mistysyn. &quot;X-Rated&quot; was the pilot for the series &quot;Liberty Street&quot;, which starred Pat Mastroianni and aired on the CBC for two seasons in 1995. In 1997, Epitome Pictures produced the soap opera &quot;Riverdale&quot;; its set, located on 220 Bartley Drive in Toronto, was re-used as the set for &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot;.

=== 1999–2019: &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Degrassi:&quot; &quot;Next Class&quot; ===
In 1999, a televised reunion of the &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; cast took place on the CBC youth show &quot;Jonovision&quot;, hosted by Jonathan Torrens. The reunion became particularly popular, with the live taping drawing in audience members from as far as San Francisco. The success of the reunion inspired Yan Moore and Linda Schuyler, now running Epitome Pictures, to develop an interest in creating a new &quot;Degrassi&quot; series by December 1999. They had originally planned to create an unrelated teen drama titled &quot;Ready, Willing And Wired&quot;. Moore noted that Emma, Spike&#x27;s daughter, would be entering junior high school by the new millennium, and the show was retooled to centre around Emma and her friends attending Degrassi. Epitome would propose the idea of &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; to CTV in October 2000, and Ivan Fecan, now CEO of CTV&#x27;s parent company, ordered thirteen episodes of the new show. Filming began on July 3, 2001, and the show premiered on CTV on October 14, 2001.

Although the original &quot;Degrassi&quot; series were widely popular in Canada, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; was particularly successful in the United States. During the show&#x27;s ninth season, the producers were informed in a meeting with CTV executives that the network did not plan to renew the show. At the same time, Stephen Stohn was in talks with TeenNick to produce 48 episodes of a telenovela-style teen show, which he later pitched as the tenth season of &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot;. To promote the series on the new network, TeenNick commissioned a promotional music video, set to &quot;Shark in the Water&quot; by V V Brown and themed around a carnival and circus, which contained clues foreshadowing later events of the season. The promo was extremely successful. According to Stephen Stohn, MuchMusic, the network that the series moved to from CTV in Canada, cited the promo as having improved the network&#x27;s ratings significantly. Season 10 premiered on July 19, 2010, and marked a change in production style to a telenovela/soap opera format, and for the first time, episodes airing in Canada and the United States on the same day. &quot;The Next Generation&quot; was also dropped from the title, which became simply &quot;Degrassi&quot;.

&quot;Degrassi&quot; was cancelled after fourteen seasons, and a spin off series called &quot;&quot; aired on Netflix for four seasons from 2016 to 2017. Season one was released on Netflix January 15, 2016, and started airing January 4, 2016, on Family&#x27;s new teen programming block, &quot;F2N&quot;. Fourteen cast members from season 14 of &quot;Degrassi&quot; also reprised their roles. On March 7, 2019, Stefan Brogren alluded to the show&#x27;s cancellation in a tweet. Sara Waisglass, who played Frankie Hollingsworth, recalled to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 2022 that she was disappointed at the cancellation and recalled: &quot;They never told us anything. We had our contracts and the way it worked was they had to tell you by a certain date if we were picked up or not. We just never heard from them again.&quot; 

On January 20, 2020, &quot;Degrassi&quot; co-creator Kit Hood died of a brain aneurysm at his home in Nova Scotia, aged 76.

=== 2022–present: Planned second revival and documentary series ===

On January 13, 2022, it was announced that HBO Max gave a series order to &quot;Degrassi&quot;, a new series in the franchise consisting of 10 hour-long episodes set to premiere in 2023. It was announced that the new series would be helmed by Lara Azzopardi and Julia Cohen, who previously wrote the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Heat of The Moment.&quot; Linda Schuyler, franchise co-creator, and Stephen Stohn, creative partner on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, issued a joint statement confirming that they would not be involved in the new series, stating that the &quot;time is perfect to pass the baton&quot; to Azzopardi and Cohen. On February 23, 2022, casting commenced for the series with a search for 13- to 20-year-old youth of all backgrounds. Filming was scheduled to begin July 1, 2022 and end November 30, 2022, However, in August 2022, reports surfaced of the restructuring of HBO Max, which led to fears of the reboot&#x27;s potential cancellation.

In November 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that the new &quot;Degrassi&quot; series would not be moving forward amid the Warner Bros. merger. However, multiple statements from Schuyler and WildBrain have indicated that there are still plans to produce the series; on the day of the cancellation&#x27;s announcement, WildBrain stated they were &quot;committed to the future of Degrassi&quot; and that &quot;discussions concerning the contract with WarnerMedia are ongoing.&quot; In April 2023, Schuyler told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that WildBrain considered the failed HBO deal a &quot;false start.&quot; Schuyler maintained her optimism in an August 2023 podcast interview, but revealed that the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike had been impacting plans to go forward.

On 6 December 2023, WildBrain announced a three-part documentary series about the franchise, produced in co-operation with Peacock Alley. The series is set to examine the franchise&#x27;s 40-year history in depth and features new cast interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. A release date has not yet been announced.

== Franchise overview ==

=== Main television series ===
=== Television movies ===
=== Documentaries and specials ===
=== Books and other print media ===
During The Kids of Degrassi Street&#x27;s run, a series of eight books based on episodes from the series were published by James Lorimer &amp; Co. The books were written by Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood, with help from Eve Jennings. Two of the books, &quot;Casey Draws The Line&quot; and &quot;Griff Gets A Hand&quot;, were later reprinted with an updated cover with a similar style to the &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; and &quot;Degrassi High&quot; books.

Between 1988 and 1992, James Lorimer &amp; Co. published a series of eleven paperback books based on the characters of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; and &quot;Degrassi High&quot; to accompany the two series&quot;.&quot; Each book focused on a different character, such as Spike, Joey, Caitlin, Wheels, and Snake, often expanding on their storylines or following new ones entirely. Another novel, &quot;Exit Stage Left&quot;, was an original story focused on multiple characters. One book, focused on the characters of Arthur Kobalewscuy and Yick Yu, was written, but not released.

To coincide with the debut of &quot;Degrassi Talks&quot; in February 1992, Boardwalk Books published companion books based on the six episodes. The books, which contain more content than the television series, feature an image the host of the episode, usually while holding camera equipment on the front cover, and a preface written by &quot;Degrassi&quot; writer Catherine Dunphy, profiling the actor who hosted the episode. The books also feature expanded versions of several interviews seen in the series, as well as other interviews that were not shown in the series due to time constraints. From 2006 to 2007, four graphic novels based on &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; were released as part of the &quot;Extra Credit&quot; series, with the books centering on the characters Ellie Nash, Emma Nelson, Spinner Mason, and Marco Del Rossi respectively.

There were also several other non-fiction books based on the franchise, including &quot;The Official 411: Degrassi Generations&quot;, a behind-the-scenes history book written by Degrassi writer and publicist Kathryn Ellis released to celebrate the franchise&#x27;s 25th anniversary in September 2005, and &quot;Growing Up Degrassi: Television, Identity and Youth Cultures&quot;, an anthology of scholarly essays on the franchise, edited by Michelle Byers. A memoir by Schuyler, titled &quot;The Mother Of All Degrassi&quot;, was released on November 15, 2022.

=== Planned &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; film ===
During 2005 and 2006, a feature film adaptation of &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; was in development. American filmmaker Kevin Smith, a longtime fan of the franchise, was slated to direct the movie. By September 2005, the film was awaiting a green light from Paramount Pictures, with a script written by Aaron Martin and Tassie Cameron, and was set to begin filming in May 2006. Smith told &quot;Playback&quot; that he had considered getting Ben Affleck to cameo in the movie, but decided against it. The project eventually came to be unrealized.

In 2022, Smith revealed to &quot;Screen Rant&quot; that the movie would have heavily centred on Drake&#x27;s character Jimmy Brooks &quot;getting up and walking.&quot; Smith claims that they incorporated elements from the script into a future episode of the television series.

== Critical reception and impact ==

=== Critical reception ===
The &quot;Degrassi&quot; franchise has been critically lauded for virtually its entire existence. The Canadian press was celebratory of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;&#x27;s local and international success, and believed it to be one of the most groundbreaking children&#x27;s television series of all time; in the lead-up to its American debut, Fred M. Hechinger of the &quot;New York Times&quot; pondered; &quot;Can teen-agers be won over to entertainment that is not mindless, violent or sexually irresponsible?&quot;. In 1989 the series was profiled by John Fisher Burns, also of the New York Times, who asserted it was &quot;remolding the pat-a-cake image of what the industry, with at least some sense of paradox, likes to call &quot;children&#x27;s television.&quot; Its sequel, &quot;Degrassi High&quot;, garnered similar praise. In 1990, Lynne Heffley of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;Degrassi&quot; one of the &quot;gutsiest shows on television.&quot; Kelli Pryor of Entertainment Weekly called it the &quot;&quot;thirtysomething&quot; of the book-bag set.&quot; 

While met with some skepticism, including from &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot;&#x27;s Tony Atherton and &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;&#x27; Melanie McFarland, &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; also went on to receive critical acclaim. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;a cult hit&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; named it &quot;Tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD.&quot; AOL TV ranked it as the sixth TV&#x27;s Biggest Guilty Pleasure. 

=== Authenticity ===
Linda Schuyler explained to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2012 that &quot;the show set out to be an authentic — and I use the word authentic very carefully; I don&#x27;t use the word realistic –- an authentic portrayal of teenage years.&quot; Authenticity is regarded as a major tenet of &quot;Degrassi&#x27;s&quot; identity, and is a frequent talking point in critical and fan discourse about the franchise&quot;.&quot; In their book &quot;Canadian Television Today&quot;, Bart Beaty and Rebecca Sullivan wrote how &quot;Degrassi&quot; touted itself as an &quot;a honest, unflinching look at growing up&quot;; in the book &quot;Programming Reality: Perspectives On English-Canadian Television&quot;, Michele Byers wrote that the series is &quot;often heralded as speaking to rather than for young people.&quot; Throughout the years, it has commonly been contrasted with similar teen shows produced in the United States that are perceived to value style over substance. 

Filmmaker and &quot;Degrassi&quot; fan Kevin Smith wrote in &quot;TV Guide&quot; of watching &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;: &quot;These were ordinary-looking … kids like I had been in high school … dealing with real problems—not that &quot;90210&quot; kinda TV problem-crap … I could identify with these kids … These non-glamorous, unpolished, awkward, age-appropriate-for-the-roles actors made me believe that I was a kindred spirit to the characters they played.&quot; &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot;, while being the most successful of the series and generally considered by many to share the same qualities, is frequently criticized for its higher production value and gradual shift towards soap opera-style sensationalism like that of other teen drama series.

&quot;Degrassi&quot; is also noted for its casting of real teenagers, as opposed to the common practice of casting much older actors: something often cited when discussing the franchise&#x27;s authenticity. During development of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, Schuyler observed that &quot;so much of the American stuff set in high schools is played by late teens and early 20s – and then some.&quot; She further elaborated to &quot;IndieWire&quot; in 2016: &quot;I like to talk about the fact that you can take a 25-year-old who looks 15 and have them play a role, but that actor is bringing 10 more years of life experience to that role. By having our cast be age-appropriate, they bring the freshness and the authenticity of that age.&quot;

=== Censorship ===
The franchise has been the subject of numerous controversies and censorships since the 1980s. In the United Kingdom, several episodes of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;&#x27;s first season, including the International Emmy award-winning episode &quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot;, were not aired in its regular place on the children&#x27;s timeslot at 5pm on BBC1 due to complaints from parents that their content &quot;too strong for [young children]&quot;, and were instead shown at 6pm on the BBC2 teen block DEF II. The network did not air its second and third seasons.

The two-part premiere of &quot;Degrassi High&quot;, &quot;A New Start&quot;, which centered around a character becoming pregnant and ultimately choosing to get an abortion, aired uncensored in Canada in November 1989, but was edited by PBS for its January 1990 American premiere to remove the episode&#x27;s final scene depicting said character fighting through anti-abortion picketers outside of a clinic. This decision was met with backlash from the show&#x27;s producers, with co-creator and director Kit Hood lambasting the network for giving the episode &quot;an American ending, happy, safe but incomplete...&quot; and requested his name be removed from the credits.

In 2004, Noggin&#x27;s The N block decided to postpone an episode of &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; revolving around abortion, titled &quot;Accidents Will Happen.&quot; The two-part episode focused on a character who becomes pregnant and decides to have an abortion. The N&#x27;s decision prompted backlash from fans. A subsequent petition from fans condemned the decision as &quot;unjust and asinine&quot;, and argued that the episode did not espouse any forceful opinions about the subject, and that the fans had the right to watch the series in an uncensored, unaltered form. Conversely, CTV in Canada showed the episode twice.
=== Reception from LGBT groups ===
&quot;Degrassi&quot;″s portrayal of LGBT youth was viewed by critics as groundbreaking. Linda Schuyler said that the impetus for the show&#x27;s inclusion of LGBT themes stemmed from her colleague Bruce Mackey, who was central to the early development in the franchise, and who hid his sexuality from his professional life. Schuyler said: &quot;It made me so sad to see somebody who had to live duplicitously like that, that it kind of has been right from the very beginning of this show, it&#x27;s been a very important mandate for me.&quot; 

The tenth season of &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; introduced the female-to-male transgender character Adam Torres, played by Jordan Todosey, who by 2011 was the &quot;only transgender regular or recurring character on scripted television&quot; according to GLAAD. A central episode involving Adam&#x27;s struggles with dysphoria, &quot;My Body Is a Cage&quot;, won a Peabody Award that year. 

== Legacy and honours ==

&quot;Degrassi&quot; has been cited as the potential starting point for the modern television teen drama, and it is said to have influenced shows including &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek.&quot; Allegedly, American television producer Aaron Spelling unsuccessfully sought to adapt &quot;Degrassi&quot; for the American market before producing &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, a story Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood have both denied. The franchise has won numerous Gemini Awards, several Teen Choice Awards and Young Artist Awards, two International Emmys, and a Peabody Award, among other awards and nominations.

&quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; became notable for featuring several actors who went on to achieve wider recognition and stardom since their time on the series, most notably actor-turned-rapper Drake, who played Jimmy Brooks, a basketball star who became physically disabled after he was shot by a classmate. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, &quot;My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was [from] Canadian TV.&quot; Nina Dobrev, who portrayed Mia Jones in later seasons, went on to star as the lead character of the popular supernatural teen drama television series &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;. The music video to Drake&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m Upset&quot; (2018) features a reunion of the &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; cast.

In 2012, the &quot;Degrassi&quot; franchise surpassed &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; as the longest-running Canadian drama by episode count.

=== Honours ===
After the death of co-creator Kit Hood in January 2020, a bench with a memorial plaque was installed in various locations important to the original &quot;Degrassi&quot; series, including Vincent Massey Junior School (the location of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;) and the Centennial College Story Arts Centre (the location of &quot;Degrassi High&quot;). In 2021, Hood&#x27;s daughter Georgia started an online petition to have the laneway behind the former Playing With Time production office named after him. 

In December 2023, the franchise was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. 

== Home media and streaming ==
=== Physical releases ===
Each &quot;Degrassi&quot; series has seen home media release over the years. Initially available by mail-order for educational institutions, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; and &quot;Degrassi High&quot; were given a commercial home video release by WGBH in 2000. &quot;Junior High&quot; was released on DVD in North America and Australia in 2005, while &quot;Degrassi High&quot; was released on DVD in North America and Australia in 2007 and 2008 respectively. Each season of &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; was released on DVD by Alliance Atlantis each year throughout the 2000s in big box sets that contained a variety of bonus content, including audition tapes, deleted scenes, and bloopers. These annual DVD releases stopped after season twelve of &quot;The Next Generation.&quot;

=== Streaming ===
&quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, &quot;Degrassi High,&quot; and &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; have variously been available to stream online over the years, including on Canada Media Fund&#x27;s Encore+ and the official &quot;Degrassi&quot; YouTube channel. It was announced in June 2023 that each series, including &quot;Kids of Degrassi Street&quot; and &quot;Degrassi Talks&quot; and bar &quot;Next Class&quot; would be made available on Amazon Prime Canada in July.

<text>Don H. Dwyer Jr. (born February 11, 1958) is an American former politician and former member of the Maryland House of Delegates. He served the 31st District of Anne Arundel County from January 8, 2003, to January 14, 2015. A member of the Republican Party, Dwyer is known for his conservative positions on certain issues, including outspoken opposition to same-sex marriage in Maryland. He was reelected by 25 votes in the November 2006 election and reelected again in 2010. He was defeated in the June, 2014 Republican primary, thought to be largely due to his legal troubles. Since 2017, Dwyer has lived in Clearwater, Florida. Dwyer chairs the Board of Supervisors for the Clearwater Cay Community Development District.

==Alcohol-related legal issues==

Dwyer has admitted to drinking on a &quot;pretty regular&quot; basis, beginning at the end of the 2011 legislative session. He has also spoken of attending counseling sessions and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to cope with alcohol dependency.

On August 22, 2012, Dwyer was operating a motorboat on the Magothy River when he collided with another vessel, seriously injuring himself, John Moran IV, his companion and former police officer, and five others. Among the others injured were three children, including a 5-year-old girl who fractured her skull. Dwyer&#x27;s blood alcohol content tested three times the legal limit of 0.08. He admitted to operating the boat under the influence at a news conference held outside Maryland Shock Trauma, adding that he regretted his actions. On August 6, 2013, Dwyer pleaded guilty to the charges but appealed his 30-day jail sentence.

While he was appealing, early on the morning of August 20, 2013, Dwyer was pulled over by an Anne Arundel County sheriff&#x27;s deputy in his 2001 Cadillac DeVille for suspected intoxication. After showing signs of alcohol intoxication, failing field sobriety tests, and refusing a to submit to a breathalyzer examination, he was arrested and transported to the Eastern District for booking.

He was again found guilty and received an additional 30-day sentence for that offense, for a total of 60 days in jail. He did not resign his seat.

Dwyer claimed his drinking that led to the boat accident was a result of marital problems and feeling betrayed by fellow lawmakers who supported legislation in favor of same-sex marriage in Maryland. Dwyer said &quot;I felt a tremendous amount of pressure in my family. You take those personal issues [and] add betrayal on the professional side, and it really gets to be overwhelming.&quot;

==Political fundraising==

At a May 2013 fundraiser for his political campaign, Rep. Dwyer hosted an auction of assault weapons during a &quot;Gun Rights and Liberty BBQ&quot;.

<text>Iven Carl &quot;Kinch&quot; Kincheloe Jr. (July 2, 1928 – July 26, 1958) was an American pilot. He served in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War, in which he was recognized as a flying ace. He continued as a test pilot after the war, participating in the Bell X-2 program, in which he set an altitude record of in 1956. For this suborbital flight above most of the atmosphere, he became known as &quot;The First Spaceman&quot;. He was selected for the Air Force&#x27;s program to put a man in space, but was killed in a plane crash in 1958.

==Early life and education==
Born July 2, 1928, in Detroit, Michigan, Kincheloe grew up in Cassopolis in the southwest part of the state, the only child of Iven C. Kincheloe Sr. (1894–1966) and Frances Wilder Kincheloe. Interested in aviation from a very young age, he graduated from Dowagiac High School in 1945 and attended Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.

Kincheloe joined the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC), was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity (Indiana Alpha), and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering in 1949. In the summer of 1948, the ROTC cadet met test pilot Chuck Yeager and sat in the cockpit of the Bell X-1.

==Korean War==
Upon graduation from college, Kincheloe received his commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force and entered flight training. After earning his pilot wings in August 1950, he spent a year as a test pilot, flying the F-86E at Edwards Air Force Base, California, was promoted to first lieutenant, and transferred to Korea in September 1951.

During the war, he was assigned to the 25th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, he flew F-80s on thirty combat missions and F-86s on 101 combat missions, downing five (becoming an ace and earning the Silver Star) before returning to the U.S. in May 1952. At this time, he had reached the rank of captain.

==Post-war career==
After the war, Kincheloe was a gunnery instructor at Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas, Nevada, then resumed his activity as a test pilot (subsequent to his prior flight test activities associated with the F-86E), graduating in December 1954 from the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School at Farnborough, England. He participated in the testing of the Century Series of fighter aircraft (F-100 Super Sabre, F-101 Voodoo, F-102 Delta Dagger, F-104 Starfighter, F-105 Thunderchief, and F-106 Delta Dart).

In the mid-1950s, Kincheloe joined the Bell X-2 program and on September 7, 1956, flew at more than and to a height of (some sources list 126,500), the first flight ever above , above 30 km (18.6 mi) and above 20 mi (32.2 km). For this he was nicknamed &quot;America&#x27;s . (However, this altitude is below the Kármán line, the threshold for &quot;space&quot; later established by the Fédération aéronautique internationale, as well as below the 50-mile-boundary used by the U.S. Air Force.) He was awarded the Mackay Trophy for 1956 for the flight.

The X-2 program was halted three weeks later, after a crash resulted in the death of Mel Apt in a flight in which he became the first person to exceed Mach 3. Kincheloe was later selected as one of the first three pilots in the next rocket-powered aircraft program, the X-15, and would have been part of the Man in Space Soonest project.

==Death and legacy==
In July 1958, Kincheloe was killed in the crash of an F-104A (Lockheed F-104A-10-LO s/n 56-772) at Edwards Air Force Base; he had ejected at low altitude, but given that the early F-104 used a downwards catapulted ejection seat the deployed parachute did not adequately slow his descent. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. Only thirty years old, Kincheloe was survived by wife, Dorothy, their young son, Iven III, and a daughter who was born two months later, Jeannine.
* On September 25, 1959, Kincheloe Air Force Base in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula was renamed in his honor; formerly Kinross Air Force Base, it closed in 1977.
* A monument stands approximately 1½ miles (2½ km) east of his hometown of Cassopolis, Michigan; an angular stone slab in height, it bears a silver model of the X-2 pointed skyward. ()

* The television program &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; included a character named Staff Sergeant James Kinchloe, played by Ivan Dixon.
* In 1992, he was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor.

<doc id="1227485" wikidata="Q7769344" url="?curid=1227485" title="The Time Warp Trio">
<text>The Time Warp Trio is a children&#x27;s book series written by Jon Scieszka and illustrated by Lane Smith and Adam McCauley, which describes the adventures of three boys – Joe, Sam, and Fred – who travel through time and space with the aid of a mysterious object known as &quot;The Book&quot;. The first book, &quot;Knights of the Kitchen Table&quot; was published in 1991.

An animated television adaptation was produced by WGBH Boston and Soup2Nuts and aired on Discovery Kids (later, The Hub).

==Plot==
For his birthday, Joe receives a mysterious blue book (known only as &quot;The Book&quot;) from his magician uncle and namesake, &quot;Joe the Magnificent&quot;. Using a number of often unpredictable and/or unintentional voice and print cues, The Book frequently transports Joe and his friends, Fred and Sam, to a variety of different times and places, from Camelot&#x27;s medieval court of knights and dragons to the year 2095, where they meet their own great-granddaughters. The only way they are able to return to present-day Brooklyn, New York is to find The Book again within whatever time period they are in. Anna, Joe&#x27;s sister, is also always eager to have the book (which is quite annoying to Joe). During their travels, Joe and his friends learn that The Book will eventually be inherited by Joe&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Jodie, who time travels with The Book with her friends who are Sam and Fred&#x27;s great-granddaughters, Samantha and Freddi, and occasionally save the boys from trouble when their paths cross. The Time Warp Trio faces many challenges during their travels as they learn how to use The Book.

==Characters==

*Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Arthur – An up-and-coming magician and the present-day owner of The Book, Joe is the unofficial leader of &quot;The Time Warp Trio&quot;. While his penchant for keeping The Book with him and experimenting with it results in many of their adventures, his talent for magical tricks also helps them out of many tough situations. Joseph is crafty, cunning, smooth and suave. 
*Samuel &quot;Sam&quot; – A friend of Joe and Fred who contributes his intelligence and historical knowledge to the group&#x27;s problems. He wears thick glasses (he is self-conscious about being a nerd) and is lactose intolerant. Sam is also wary of time travel; he is convinced their doom is imminent every time they open The Book. An amateur inventor, he is told by Freddi that he will invent something very important in the future (though it is not revealed what). He can be passive-aggressive at times.
*Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; – A friend of Joe and Sam. Fred is a sports fan who is headstrong, sometimes to the point of idiocy. Fred is the most interested in using The Book for material gains, whether hunting for treasure or patenting future technology. He has a bullying older brother named Mike.
*Joe the Magnificent – Joe&#x27;s uncle, a would-be magician who fails at live performances. He originally sent The Book to Joe, since he could not make it work - he performs his own time travel by means of an enchanted pocket watch. He believes in the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny.
*Mrs. Arthur – Joe&#x27;s mother, a sometimes short-tempered woman. She understands how to use The Book, originally giving it to her brother (Joe&#x27;s uncle) and later showing her son the page for choosing the specific time to visit.
*Anna Arthur – Joe&#x27;s annoying younger sister, who is revealed to have a better understanding of The Book than her brother does.
*Jodie – Joe&#x27;s great-granddaughter from the year 2095, who occasionally crosses paths with the trio, along with her friends Samantha and Freddi (all three have a great mastery of The Book). Jodie is usually concerned with her looks or any way to make herself more comfortable in any situation, yet she looks out for her friends as they do for her. Because she and Fred have pretty stubborn personalities, they usually butt heads at some point when the other is around or attempting to take charge. She is sometimes called Jo or J.
*Samantha – Sam&#x27;s great-granddaughter from the year 2095. Unlike her great grandpa, Samantha is not as erratically apprehensive whenever she finds herself back in time, even when faced with a dilemma. Samantha owns a time-traveling pocket watch that belonged to Sam. She is sometimes called Samm or Samza.
*Freida &quot;Freddi&quot; – Fred&#x27;s great-granddaughter from the year 2095. She wears a baseball hat, as her great-grandfather did. Unlike her great grandfather she fears heights and bugs.
*Michael &quot;Mike&quot; - Fred&#x27;s mean older brother who appears in &quot;See You Later, Gladiator&quot; and &quot;Viking It and Liking It&quot;.

<doc id="1227486" wikidata="Q3550761" url="?curid=1227486" title="United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.">
<text>United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131 (1948) (also known as the Hollywood Antitrust Case of 1948, the Paramount Case, or the Paramount Decision), was a landmark United States Supreme Court antitrust case that decided the fate of film studios owning their own theatres and holding exclusivity rights on which theatres would show their movies. It would also change the way Hollywood movies were produced, distributed, and exhibited. It also opened the door for more foreign and independent films to be shown in U.S. theaters. The Supreme Court affirmed the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York&#x27;s ruling that the existing distribution scheme was in violation of United States antitrust law, which prohibits certain exclusive dealing arrangements.

The decision created the Paramount Decree, a standard held by the United States Department of Justice that prevented film production companies from owning exhibition companies. The case is important both in American antitrust law and film history. In the former, it remains a landmark decision in vertical integration cases; in the latter, it is responsible for putting an end to the old Hollywood studio system.
As part of a 2019 review of its ongoing decrees, the Department of Justice issued a two-year sunsetting notice for the Paramount Decree in August 2020, believing the antitrust restriction was no longer necessary as the old model could never be recreated in contemporary settings.

==Background==
The legal issues originated in the silent era, when the Federal Trade Commission began investigating film companies for potential violations under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.

The major film studios owned the theaters where their motion pictures were shown, either in partnerships or outright. Thus specific theater chains showed only the films produced by the studio that owned them. The studios created the films, had the writers, directors, producers and actors on staff (under contract), owned the film processing and laboratories, created the prints and distributed them through the theaters that they owned: In other words, the studios were vertically integrated, creating a de facto oligopoly. By 1945, the studios owned either partially or outright 17% of the theaters in the country, accounting for 45% of the film-rental revenue.

Ultimately, this issue of the studios&#x27; then-alleged (and later upheld) illegal trade practices led to all the major movie studios being sued in 1938 by the U.S. Department of Justice. As the largest studio, Paramount Pictures was the primary defendant, but all of the other Big Five (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, and RKO Pictures) and Little Three (Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and United Artists) were named, and additional defendants included numerous subsidiaries and executives from each company. Separate cases were also filed against large independent chains, including the 148-theater Schine.

The federal government&#x27;s case was initially settled in 1940 in the District Court for the Southern District of New York with a consent decree, which allowed the government to resume prosecution if studios were noncompliant by November, 1943. Among other requirements, the District Court-imposed consent decree included the following conditions:
# The Big Five studios could no longer block-book short film subjects along with feature films (known as one-shot, or full force, block booking);
# The Big Five studios could continue to block-book features, but the block size would be limited to five films;
# Blind buying (buying of films by theater districts without seeing films beforehand) would be outlawed and replaced with &quot;trade showing&quot;, special screenings every two weeks at which representatives of all 31 theater districts in the United States could see films before theatres decided to book a film; and
# The creation of an administration board to enforce these requirements.
The studios did not fully comply with the consent decree. In 1942, they instead, with Allied Theatre Owners, proposed an alternate &quot;Unity Plan&quot;. Under the Plan, larger blocks of theatres were blocked with the caveat of allowing theaters to reject films. Consequently, the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (SIMPP) came into existence and thence filed a lawsuit against Paramount Detroit Theaters, representing the first major lawsuit of producers against exhibitors. The government declined to pursue the Unity proposal and instead, owing to noncompliance with the District Court&#x27;s binding consent decree, resumed prosecution via the 1943 lawsuit. The 1943 case went to trial on October 8, 1945, one month and six days after the end of World War II. The District Court ruled in favor of the studios, and the government immediately appealed to the Supreme Court.

The case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1948; their verdict went against the movie studios, forcing all of them to divest themselves of their movie theater chains. This, coupled with the advent of television and the attendance drop in movie ticket sales, brought about a severe slump in the movie business.

The &quot;Paramount&quot; decision is a bedrock of corporate antitrust law and as such is cited in most cases where issues of vertical integration play a prominent role in restricting fair trade.

==Decision==
The Supreme Court ruled 7–1 in the government&#x27;s favor, affirming much of the consent decree (Justice Robert H. Jackson took no part in the proceedings). William O. Douglas delivered the Court&#x27;s opinion, with Felix Frankfurter dissenting in part, arguing the Court should have left all of the decree intact except its arbitration provisions.

===Douglas&#x27; majority opinion===

Douglas&#x27;s opinion reiterated the facts and history of the case and reviewed the Supreme Court&#x27;s opinion, agreeing that its conclusion was &quot;incontestable&quot;. He considered five different trade practices addressed by the consent decree:
* &quot;Clearances and runs&quot;, under which movies were scheduled so they would only be showing at particular theatres at any given time, to avoid competing with another theater&#x27;s showing;
* &quot;Pooling agreements&quot;, the joint ownership of theaters by two nominally competitive studios;
* &quot;Formula deals, master agreements, and franchises&quot;: arrangements by which an exhibitor or distributor allocated profits among theaters that had shown a particular film, and awarded exclusive rights to independent theatres, sometimes without competitive bidding;
* &quot;Block booking&quot;, the studios&#x27; practice of requiring theaters to take an entire slate of its films, sometimes without even seeing them and sometimes before the films had even been produced (&quot;blind bidding&quot;); and
* &quot;Discrimination&quot; against smaller, independent theaters in favor of larger chains.

Douglas let stand the Court&#x27;s sevenfold test for when a clearance agreement could be considered a restraint of trade, as he agreed they had a legitimate purpose. Pooling agreements and joint ownership, he agreed, were &quot;bald efforts to substitute monopoly for competition ... Clearer restraints of trade are difficult to imagine.&quot; He allowed, however, that courts could consider how an interest in an exhibitor was acquired; thus, he remanded some other issues back to the District Court for further inquiry and resolution. He set aside the lower court&#x27;s findings on franchises so that they might be reconsidered from the perspective of allowing competitive bidding. On the block booking question, he rejected the studios&#x27; argument that it was necessary to profit from their copyrights: &quot;The copyright law, like the patent statutes, makes reward to the owner a secondary consideration&quot;. The prohibitions on discrimination he let stand entirely.

===Frankfurter&#x27;s concurrence/dissent===

Frankfurter took exception to the extent to which his colleagues had agreed with the studios that the District Court had not adequately explored the underlying facts in affirming the consent decree. He pointed to then-contemporary Court decision, &quot;International Salt Co. v. United States&quot; that lower courts are the proper place for such findings of fact, to be deferred to by higher courts. Also, he reminded the (Supreme) Court that the District Court had spent fifteen months considering the case and reviewed almost 4,000 pages of documentary evidence: &quot;I cannot bring myself to conclude that the product of such a painstaking process of adjudication as to a decree appropriate for such a complicated situation as this record discloses was an abuse of discretion.&quot; He would have modified the District Court decision only to permit the use of arbitration to resolve disputes.

==Aftermath==

The court orders forcing the separation of motion picture production and exhibition companies are commonly referred to as the Paramount Decrees. Paramount Pictures Inc. was forced to split into two companies: the film company Paramount Pictures Corp. and the theater chain (United Paramount Theaters), which merged in 1953 with the American Broadcasting Company.

Consequences of the decision include:
* An increase in the number of independent movie theaters throughout the 1950s, 60s and 70s.
* An increase in independent producers and studios to produce their film product, free of major studio interference.
* The beginning of the end of the old Hollywood studio system and its golden age, allowing creative freedom for both behind-the-camera personnel and actors.
* The weakening of the Hays Code, because of the rise of independent and &quot;art house&quot; theaters which showed foreign or independent films made outside of the Code&#x27;s jurisdiction; the Hays Code was replaced by the age-based rating system in 1968.

===Reviews and termination of the Paramount Decrees===
In 1980, the United States Department of Justice under President Ronald Reagan began a review of all consent decrees that were more than 10 years old. In 1983, the Department of Justice announced that it was in the &quot;final stages&quot; of reviewing the Paramount Decrees. Eventually, in February 1985, the Department of Justice announced that, although it was not formally terminating the Paramount Decrees, it would no longer pursue enforcement of the decrees in cases where doing so was “in the public interest.” According to media historian Jennifer Holt, &quot;Effectively, this statement dissolved the authority of the decrees, if not legally then practically.&quot;

In April 2018, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division began a review of antitrust decrees that did not have expiration dates. In 2019, the DOJ sought to terminate the Paramount Decrees, which would include a two-year sunset period as to the practices of block booking and circuit dealing to allow theater chains to adjust. The Department stated it was &quot;unlikely that the remaining defendants can reinstate their cartel&quot; as reasoning for terminating the decrees. The DOJ formally filed its motion for a court order to terminate the decrees on November 22, 2019. The move was opposed by independent movie theater owners, including the Independent Cinema Alliance, and independent filmmakers.

The court granted the DOJ&#x27;s motion to lift the decrees on August 7, 2020, starting a two-year sunset termination period of the decrees.

<doc id="1227489" wikidata="Q276157" url="?curid=1227489" title="Barry Venison">
<text>Barry Venison (born 16 August 1964) is an English football coach, former professional footballer and sports television pundit.

As a player was a defender from 1981 to 1997. He played for Sunderland, Liverpool, Newcastle United, Galatasaray and Southampton. He was capped twice by England.

Following retirement, he became a television pundit and most notably worked on ITV Sport&#x27;s &quot;The Premiership&quot; between 2001 and 2004 whilst the network held the rights to show Premier League highlights. In 2016, he was given his first head coaching role at Orange County Blues, succeeding Oliver Wyss.

==Club career==

===Sunderland===
Venison was born in Consett, County Durham. He played for England at youth and under-21 level in his early days. He started his club career in his native North East with Sunderland and set a record when he became the youngest captain at a Wembley cup final when, aged 20 years and 220 days, he skippered Sunderland against Norwich City in the 1985 League Cup final in place of the suspended Shaun Elliott. Unfortunately for both Venison and Sunderland they lost 1–0.

Venison had originally made his debut for the Black Cats, aged just 17, on 10 October 1981 in the 2–0 league defeat to Notts County at Meadow Lane. He went on to play in 20 league games that season scoring one goal in the process. The steady and reliable right full-back settled into first team football well at Roker Park and became a firm favourite in 1983–84, when he missed just one league game.

At the end of the 1984–85 season, the same season in which they had reached the League Cup final, Sunderland were relegated to the Second Division. After Sunderland&#x27;s failure to win promotion in 1985–86, Venison asked for a transfer as his Sunderland contract neared expiry in 1986, so he wrote to Liverpool as that was the only team he wanted to play for.

By the end of the 1985–86 season he had made a total of 205 appearances for the Wearsiders; 173 of them in the Football League. He had scored two goals.

===Liverpool===
It was Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish who acted quickest and duly offered him a deal. The recent Double winners paid Sunderland £200,000 for Venison&#x27;s services on 31 July 1986, with a view to him becoming a long term successor to the ageing right-back Mark Lawrenson.

Venison made his Liverpool debut on 16 August 1986 in the traditional curtain raiser at Wembley, the Charity Shield, Liverpool faced derby rivals Everton, who had lost out to the Reds in both the previous season&#x27;s League and FA Cup campaigns. The usual high tempo game ended in a 1–1 draw with both clubs sharing the shield. He featured in 33 out of 42 league games that season.

Venison was a League Cup final loser again in his first season at Anfield, when Liverpool were defeated by Arsenal in the 1987 final. He was also denied the chance of league title glory as the Reds were beaten into second place in the league by their neighbours Everton.

He played 18 times for Liverpool when they secured League championship in 1988, losing just two out of 40 league games. However, the emergence of fellow young defender Gary Ablett meant that Venison lost his place in the team. He was also hampered by injury and was unavailable for that season&#x27;s FA Cup final, which Liverpool unexpectedly lost to Wimbledon.

The next season would see Venison&#x27;s first goal for the club, it came on 29 August 1988 in the 4–1 thrashing of Nottingham Forest in the quarter finals of the Centenary trophy. Venison featured in more games but with fewer starts, often named as one of the two permitted substitutes.

Venison, along with his teammates, supported the bereaved families of the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989, attending a number of the funerals, he then played his role as Liverpool reached the final of the FA Cup again. Dalglish brought him on as an extra-time substitute as Liverpool defeated Merseyside rivals Everton 3–2. Liverpool later lost the League title in a decider against Arsenal at Anfield after Michael Thomas scored the winner with virtually the last kick of the whole season. Venison was on the bench again.

1990 saw Venison play 25 times in the league and earn another championship medal as Liverpool secured their 18th top division title.

During the following campaign Venison only managed a total of 14 appearances in all competitions, however, this did include another Wembley appearance as Liverpool faced bitter rivals Manchester United in the Charity Shield. Liverpool had to share the trophy as they drew 1–1 with their North West rivals.

Venison scored what would be his only league goal for the Reds on 31 March 1992, netting the side&#x27;s final goal in a 4–0 win over Notts County. He played 13 times in the league that season, as Liverpool finished sixth – the first time since 1981 that they had not been league champions or runners-up. They did win the FA Cup by defeating Venison&#x27;s old club Sunderland 2–0 at Wembley. However, he was not included in the squad, and with Liverpool now managed by Graeme Souness, who had succeeded Dalglish a year earlier, it appeared that Venison&#x27;s future now lay away from Anfield, particularly after the form of new signing Rob Jones at right-back.

===Newcastle United===
On 31 July 1992, exactly six years after joining Liverpool, he departed from Merseyside and returned to the North East to play for Sunderland&#x27;s rivals Newcastle United, who were preparing for a promotion push in the new Division One (as the old Second Division was now named following the creation of the FA Premier League) under the management of former Liverpool, Newcastle United and England striker Kevin Keegan.

Venison made his debut of the Magpies on 15 August 1992 in the 3–2 league win over Southend United at St James&#x27; Park, Venison enjoyed a tremendous beginning to his Newcastle career as they won their first eleven league games in a row, leaving them runaway leaders of Division One and looking uncatchable in the promotion race by October. The run came to an end when they lost to a last minute goal at home against Grimsby Town; they fell just 2 games short of the record 13 straight victories that had been set seven years earlier by Reading in the old Third Division. Keegan&#x27;s team played in an exuberant, attacking style and their defence included a revitalised Venison as well as the likes of John Beresford and Steve Howey. Newcastle went on to become Division One champions, thus gaining promotion to the Premier League.

Venison only scored one goal for the Magpies but he regards it as being the best goal he&#x27;s ever scored; it was, in his words, &quot;a 20-yard screamer&quot; against Aston Villa at a packed St James&#x27; Park.

Venison remained a crucial part of the Newcastle defence as they returned to the top flight in 1993–94, and helped them hit the ground running as they secured a third-place finish (though they never really looked like catching up with the leading pair that consisted of champions Manchester United and runners-up Blackburn Rovers). This gave the Magpies a place in Europe (the UEFA Cup) for the first time since the 1970s.

Keegan also successfully converted Venison into a midfield player following the arrival of right-back Marc Hottiger at the start of the 1994–95 season, though Venison lost the club captaincy when he was spotted in a wine bar outside of the club&#x27;s curfew.

He played 28 times for the Magpies in the 1994–95 season, scoring his only league goal for them, and for a while it looked as though he might be gaining another championship medal to add to the two he earned at Liverpool. The Magpies achieved the best start to a top division campaign in their history as they won their first six games in the Premier League and entered October still top of the league. However, the excellent form was not maintained as the season went on, and a sixth-place finish wasn&#x27;t enough for another UEFA Cup campaign.

===Galatasaray===
At the end of the 1994–95 season, after 130 appearances for Newcastle, Venison signed for Galatasaray in Turkey on 31 May 1995 for £750,000. He was one of several British footballers recruited by coach Graeme Souness, who had been his manager during his final year at Liverpool earlier in the decade.

===Southampton===
Venison spent just under 5 months with the Turkish side, playing eight games, before he was on the move once more. He joined Southampton for £850,000 on 25 October 1995. He played 22 Premier League games that season as Southampton avoided relegation on goal difference and reached the FA Cup quarter finals.

He played two more games for the Saints in the 1996–97 season (by which time Souness was manager of Southampton, the third club Venison had played under him at), before he suffered a back injury which led to him announcing his retirement from playing on 20 October 1996 at the age of 32.

==International career==
Venison had been selected to represent England at under-21 level on 10 occasions from 1982 until 1986.

In 1994, aged 30, Venison was picked to represent his country by new coach Terry Venables. The call-up came as a surprise, not least to Venison, but he played well in both of his full international appearances. His debut came on 7 September 1994 in the 2–0 friendly victory over the United States; his only other appearance for his country came on 29 March 1995 in a 0–0 friendly draw with Uruguay. Both games were played at Wembley.

==Retirement and coaching roles==
After retirement, Venison took up punditry; firstly for Sky Sports, and then, from 1997 to 2002, for ITV.

In the early 2000s, Venison launched an on-line sports memorabilia auction site. The company &quot;bid4sport.com&quot; was a not-for-profit company and raised money for charities. Julie Venison was also involved in Bid4sport providing business support and book-keeping for the venture. The company was initially based on the outskirts of Romsey before expanding and moving to premises to the west of Fareham. The venture was created with the help of friend and co-professional Brad Friedel. Venison sold Bid4sport shortly before his family relocated to the United States.

Venison also made an appearance as himself in the 2001 comedy film, &quot;Mike Bassett: England Manager&quot;.

Venison moved to the United States in 2003, firstly to Laguna Beach, and then Los Angeles. He worked in property development for a short time, before his friend Oliver Wyss, convinced him to return to football. Venison became Technical Director of Orange County Blues, before succeeding Wyss as head coach to see out the 2016 USL Pro season.

<doc id="1227499" wikidata="Q6937919" url="?curid=1227499" title="Murder of John Monckton">
<text>John Victor Monckton (13 October 1955 – 29 November 2004) was a financier who was killed in his own house in November 2004, by Elliott White and Damien Hanson, while the latter was on probation after serving half of his 12-year sentence for attempted murder.

==Biography==
Educated at Downside and Lincoln College, Oxford, he rose to the position of Managing Director of Bonds at Legal &amp; General Group PLC, a large British insurance firm. He was a Roman Catholic, and a distant cousin of Viscount Monckton of Brenchley. He joined the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in 1977.

He was murdered and his wife severely assaulted at their home in Upper Cheyne Row in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, nominally a low-crime area. His nine-year-old daughter called the police, but the killers fled the scene. A suspect, Damien Hanson, was arrested the following day.

==Murder==
Hanson was eventually convicted of Monckton&#x27;s murder and sentenced to serve three life sentences for killing Monckton, and the attempted murder of Monckton&#x27;s wife Homeyra, in November 2004. His accomplice, Elliot White, is serving 18 years for manslaughter, wounding with intent and robbery.

The trial judge recommended that Hanson should serve a minimum of 36 years in jail before being considered for parole. This is one of the lengthiest minimum terms ever handed out in British legal history.

Hanson had at least one previous conviction for attempted murder when he killed Monckton. Hanson had been released from jail three months before the killing, halfway through his 12-year sentence. In 2006, Hanson&#x27;s half sister, Laura Campbell, was jailed for four years for providing a fake alibi for the crime.

<text>John Doogan VC (; March 1853 in Aughrim, County Galway – 24 January 1940 in Folkestone, Kent) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Award==
He was 27 years old, and a private in the 1st Dragoon Guards (The King&#x27;s), British Army during the First Boer War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 January 1881 at the Battle of Laing&#x27;s Nek, South Africa, during the charge of the mounted men, Private Doogan saw that Major William Vesey Brownlow, KDG, had had his horse shot from under him and was dismounted among the Boers. Doogan rode up and, in spite of being severely wounded himself, dismounted and insisted on Major Brownlow taking his horse, receiving another wound while doing so.

Brownlow ultimately rose to the rank of major-general and died in 1926, bequeathing Doogan, his &#x27;former servant&#x27;, an annuity of £20 a year, (worth around £600 in 2005).

==Further service==
Doogan left the army by 1882 but he returned to service in World War I as an army recruiter, with the rank of sergeant.

==Civilian career==
Doogan was working for the General Post Office as a Mail Driver when he was living at Welshpool, Montgomeryshire, Wales at the 1891 Census. In the 1901 Census he had moved into England when he was employed as a butler when living at Church Cottage, East Shenfield, Berkshire. By the 1911 Census he moved to Shropshire, when he lived at Cause Mountain in the parish of Westbury, occupation &#x27;Army pensioner&#x27; and later at Stapeley Hill where he was a farmer between 1926 and 1937. He retired from farming to Folkestone, Kent.

==Personal life==
Doogan was twice married, but only the first marriage was legal. With his first wife Mary he had ten children (his first child born 1882); two sons of theirs died on active service with the army in World War I. She died in August 1924.

His second marriage, later proved invalid, took place on 16 September 1929 at Welshpool Registry Office to Martha Maria Roberts, who was 39 years his junior and had been employed as his housekeeper following his widowhood. She had previously married at Wrexham, on 8 November 1923, David Philip Roberts, who she claimed was dead at the time she met Doogan but turned out to be still alive after the later wedding. She stood trial at Shrewsbury Assizes on 20 February 1930, charged with bigamy of which she was found guilty but was leniently bound over in £10, to be forfeit if she was called for trial again, instead of being sentenced to prison (the usual penalty). Doogan, the innocent party, gave evidence as witness, while the estranged legal husband appeared simply to confirm his identity and their own marriage.

==Death==
He is buried at Shorncliffe Military Cemetery (also known as the Garrison Cemetery) in Folkestone (Plot V. Grave 1054).

==Victoria Cross==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards Regimental Museum in Cardiff Castle, Wales.

<text>Illinois Route 132 (IL 132) is an arterial state route that connects IL 59 at the village line between Fox Lake Hills and Lake Villa, with IL 131 in Waukegan. It is known as Grand Avenue for its entire length, and Grand Avenue extends west beyond Lindenhurst to near U.S. Route 12 (US 12), west. Though IL 132 is one of the busiest state highways in Illinois, it is only long (21.83 km).

== Route description ==

Illinois 132 serves the town of Gurnee. Grand Avenue is the main road to both the Gurnee Mills Shopping Center and Six Flags Great America. At this point Illinois 132 is a divided, six lane road—its length wavers between 2 and 6 lanes around Gurnee.

Because Route 132 is a well-traveled road in suburban Chicago, it is also a major suburban Chicago shopping and industry corridor, especially on the Grand Avenue section of the route. A variety of car dealers, retail stores, full-service restaurants, mid-range hotels, etc. are located on this roadway.

== History ==
SBI Route 132 was initially what is now Illinois Route 121 from Decatur to Mattoon in central Illinois; in 1937, Illinois 121 replaced Illinois 131 and Illinois 132. In 1950 it was reassigned to the whole stretch of Grand Avenue; in 1967 it was dropped east of Illinois 131 and west of Illinois Route 59.

<text>&quot;Car and Driver&quot; 10Best is a list annually produced by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; (&quot;C/D&quot;) beginning in 1983, nominating what it considers the 10 best cars of the year. &quot;C/D&quot; also produced the 5Best list, highlighting what it considers the five best trucks of the year.

All production vehicles for sale in that calendar year are considered with these recent restrictions:
# The vehicle must be on sale by January
# It must be priced below 2.5 times the average price of a car that year
# The manufacturer must provide an example for testing
# Only substantially changed or new vehicles and the past year&#x27;s 10 best winners are nominated

The magazine sometimes selects a specific trim and other times a whole family of vehicles.

<doc id="1227509" wikidata="Q140282" url="?curid=1227509" title="Zaytsev's rule">
<text>In organic chemistry, Zaytsev&#x27;s rule (or Zaitsev&#x27;s rule, Saytzeff&#x27;s rule, Saytzev&#x27;s rule) is an empirical rule for predicting the favored alkene product(s) in elimination reactions. While at the University of Kazan, Russian chemist Alexander Zaytsev studied a variety of different elimination reactions and observed a general trend in the resulting alkenes. Based on this trend, Zaytsev proposed that the alkene formed in greatest amount is that which corresponded to removal of the hydrogen from the alpha-carbon having the fewest hydrogen substituents. For example, when 2-iodobutane is treated with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), but-2-ene is the major product and but-1-ene is the minor product.

More generally, Zaytsev&#x27;s rule predicts that in an elimination reaction the most substituted product will be the most stable, and therefore the most favored. The rule makes no generalizations about the stereochemistry of the newly formed alkene, but only the regiochemistry of the elimination reaction. While effective at predicting the favored product for many elimination reactions, Zaytsev&#x27;s rule is subject to many exceptions.
Many of them include exceptions under Hofmann product (analogous to Zaytsev product). These include compounds having quaternary nitrogen and leaving groups like NR3+, SO3H, etc. In these eliminations the Hofmann product is preferred. In case the leaving group is halogens, except fluorine; others give the Zaytsev product.

==History==
Alexander Zaytsev first published his observations regarding the products of elimination reactions in &quot;Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie&quot; in 1875. Although the paper contained some original research done by Zaytsev&#x27;s students, it was largely a literature review and drew heavily upon previously published work. In it, Zaytsev proposed a purely empirical rule for predicting the favored regiochemistry in the dehydrohalogenation of alkyl iodides, though it turns out that the rule is applicable to a variety of other elimination reactions as well. While Zaytsev&#x27;s paper was well referenced throughout the 20th century, it was not until the 1960s that textbooks began using the term &quot;Zaytsev&#x27;s rule&quot;.

Zaytsev was not the first chemist to publish the rule that now bears his name. Aleksandr Nikolaevich Popov published an empirical rule similar to Zaytsev&#x27;s in 1872, and presented his findings at the University of Kazan in 1873. Zaytsev had cited Popov&#x27;s 1872 paper in previous work and worked at the University of Kazan, and was thus probably aware of Popov&#x27;s proposed rule. In spite of this, Zaytsev&#x27;s 1875 &quot;Liebigs Annalen&quot; paper makes no mention of Popov&#x27;s work.

Any discussion of Zaytsev&#x27;s rule would be incomplete without mentioning Vladimir Vasilyevich Markovnikov. Zaytsev and Markovnikov both studied under Alexander Butlerov, taught at the University of Kazan during the same period, and were bitter rivals. Markovnikov, who published in 1870 what is now known as Markovnikov&#x27;s rule, and Zaytsev held conflicting views regarding elimination reactions: the former believed that the least substituted alkene would be favored, whereas the latter felt the most substituted alkene would be the major product. Perhaps one of the main reasons Zaytsev began investigating elimination reactions was to disprove his rival. Zaytsev published his rule for elimination reactions just after Markovnikov published the first article in a three-part series in &quot;Comptes Rendus&quot; detailing his rule for addition reactions.

==Thermodynamic considerations==
The hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes is exothermic. The amount of energy released during a hydrogenation reaction, known as the heat of hydrogenation, is inversely related to the stability of the starting alkene: the more stable the alkene, the lower its heat of hydrogenation. Examining the heats of hydrogenation for various alkenes reveals that stability increases with the amount of substitution.

The increase in stability associated with additional substitutions is the result of several factors. Alkyl groups are electron donating by inductive effect, and increase the electron density on the sigma bond of the alkene. Also, alkyl groups are sterically large, and are most stable when they are far away from each other. In an alkane, the maximum separation is that of the tetrahedral bond angle, 109.5°. In an alkene, the bond angle increases to near 120°. As a result, the separation between alkyl groups is greatest in the most substituted alkene.

Hyperconjugation, which describes the stabilizing interaction between the HOMO of the alkyl group and the LUMO of the double bond, also helps explain the influence of alkyl substitutions on the stability of alkenes. In regards to orbital hybridization, a bond between an sp2 carbon and an sp3 carbon is stronger than a bond between two sp3-hybridized carbons. Computations reveal a dominant stabilizing hyperconjugation effect of 6 kcal/mol per alkyl group.

===Steric effects===
In E2 elimination reactions, a base abstracts a proton that is beta to a leaving group, such as a halide. The removal of the proton and the loss of the leaving group occur in a single, concerted step to form a new double bond. When a small, unhindered base – such as sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, or sodium ethoxide – is used for an E2 elimination, the Zaytsev product is typically favored over the least substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product. For example, treating 2-Bromo-2-methyl butane with sodium ethoxide in ethanol produces the Zaytsev product with moderate selectivity.

Due to steric interactions, a bulky base – such as potassium &quot;tert&quot;-butoxide, triethylamine, or 2,6-lutidine – cannot readily abstract the proton that would lead to the Zaytsev product. In these situations, a less sterically hindered proton is preferentially abstracted instead. As a result, the Hofmann product is typically favored when using bulky bases. When 2-Bromo-2-methyl butane is treated with potassium &quot;tert&quot;-butoxide instead of sodium ethoxide, the Hofmann product is favored.

Steric interactions within the substrate also prevent the formation of the Zaytsev product. These intramolecular interactions are relevant to the distribution of products in the Hofmann elimination reaction, which converts amines to alkenes. In the Hofmann elimination, treatment of a quaternary ammonium iodide salt with silver oxide produces hydroxide ions, which act as a base and eliminate the tertiary amine to give an alkene.

In the Hofmann elimination, the least substituted alkene is typically favored due to intramolecular steric interactions. The quaternary ammonium group is large, and interactions with alkyl groups on the rest of the molecule are undesirable. As a result, the conformation necessary for the formation of the Zaytsev product is less energetically favorable than the conformation required for the formation of the Hofmann product. As a result, the Hofmann product is formed preferentially. The Cope elimination is very similar to the Hofmann elimination in principle but occurs under milder conditions. It also favors the formation of the Hofmann product, and for the same reasons.

===Stereochemistry===
In some cases, the stereochemistry of the starting material can prevent the formation of the Zaytsev product. For example, when menthyl chloride is treated with sodium ethoxide, the Hofmann product is formed exclusively, but in very low yield:

This result is due to the stereochemistry of the starting material. E2 eliminations require &quot;anti&quot;-periplanar geometry, in which the proton and leaving group lie on opposite sides of the C-C bond, but in the same plane. When menthyl chloride is drawn in the chair conformation, it is easy to explain the unusual product distribution.

Formation of the Zaytsev product requires elimination at the 2-position, but the isopropyl group – not the proton – is &quot;anti&quot;-periplanar to the chloride leaving group; this makes elimination at the 2-position impossible. In order for the Hofmann product to form, elimination must occur at the 6-position. Because the proton at this position has the correct orientation relative to the leaving group, elimination can and does occur. As a result, this particular reaction produces only the Hofmann product.

<text>Ulpius Marcellus was a Roman consular governor of Britannia who returned there as general of the later 2nd century.

Ulpius Marcellus is recorded as governor of Roman Britain in an inscription of 176–80, and apparently returned to Rome after a tenure without serious incident. He was sent out again by the Emperor Commodus to suppress a serious revolt in 180, which earned him the reputation of a disciplinarian. Dio Cassius records that tribes from the north breached Hadrian&#x27;s Wall which separated them from the empire and killed a general (possibly Marcellus&#x27; predecessor, Caerellius Priscus) with all his guards, presumably during an inspection of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Little else is known of the revolt except that Dio called it the most serious war of Commodus&#x27; reign and reported that it was not quelled until about 184, when commemorative coins were issued and Commodus assumed the title of &quot;Britannicus&quot;. Further coins were issued in 185 however, and a hoard of silver coins with final issues from 186/7 suggest that unrest and fighting continued into later years.

Marcellus undertook punitive raids north of the border and may have attempted to reoccupy the Antonine Wall. However, he ultimately withdrew to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and probably concluded treaties with the relevant tribes. The forts north of the wall such as Newstead were abandoned. Two inscriptions at the fort at Cilurnum mention him in connection with the Ala II Asturum.

He was hampered by a lack of control over his troops. Marcellus was a martinet and the troops in Britain under Commodus were highly mutinous, going so far as to later put forward a pretender to the imperial throne. He was thought to have had a son, also called Ulpius Marcellus, serving as governor around thirty years later, although this is based on a misdated inscription and the existence of a second Marcellus is now discounted.

<doc id="1227519" wikidata="Q1239194" url="?curid=1227519" title="Horn-satisfiability">
<text>In formal logic, Horn-satisfiability, or HORNSAT, is the problem of deciding whether a given conjunction of propositional Horn clauses is satisfiable or not. Horn-satisfiability and Horn clauses are named after Alfred Horn.

A Horn clause is a clause with at most one positive literal, called the &quot;head&quot; of the clause, and any number of negative literals, forming the &quot;body&quot; of the clause. A Horn formula is a propositional formula formed by conjunction of Horn clauses.

Horn satisfiability is actually one of the &quot;hardest&quot; or &quot;most expressive&quot; problems which is known to be computable in polynomial time, in the sense that it is a [[Horn-satisfiability|P]]-complete problem. The extension of the problem for quantified Horn formulae can be also solved in polynomial time.

The Horn satisfiability problem can also be asked for propositional many-valued logics. The algorithms are not usually linear, but some are polynomial; see Hähnle (2001 or 2003) for a survey.

==Algorithm==

The problem of Horn satisfiability is solvable in linear time. 
A polynomial-time algorithm for Horn satisfiability is recursive:
* A first termination condition is a formula in which all the clauses currently existing contain negative literals. In this case, all the variables currently in the clauses can be set to false.
* A second termination condition is an empty clause. In this case, the formula has no solutions.
* In the other cases, the formula contains a positive unit clause formula_1, so we do a unit propagation: the literal formula_1 is set to true, all the clauses containing formula_1 are removed, and all clauses containing formula_4 have this literal removed. The result is a new Horn formula, so we reiterate.

This algorithm also allows determining a truth assignment of satisfiable Horn formulae: all variables contained in a unit clause are set to the value satisfying that unit clause; all other literals are set to false. The resulting assignment is the minimal model of the Horn formula, that is, the assignment having a minimal set of variables assigned to true, where comparison is made using set containment.

Using a linear algorithm for unit propagation, the algorithm is linear in the size of the formula.

===Examples===
====Trivial case====
In the Horn formula
:
:
:

each clause has a negated literal. Therefore, setting each variable to false satisfies all clauses, hence it is a solution.

====Solvable case====
In the Horn formula
:
:
:

one clause forces &quot;f&quot; to be true. Setting &quot;f&quot; to true and simplifying gives
:
:

Now &quot;b&quot; must be true. Simplification gives
:
:.

Now it is a trivial case, so the remaining variables can all be set to false. Thus, a satisfying assignment is
:,
:,
:.

====Unsolvable case====
In the Horn formula
:
:
:

one clause forces &quot;f&quot; to be true. Subsequent simplification gives
:
:

Now &quot;b&quot; has to be true. Simplification gives
:
:.
We obtained an empty clause, hence the formula is unsatisfiable.

==Generalization==

A generalization of the class of Horn formulae is that of renamable-Horn formulae, which is the set of formulae that can be placed in Horn form by replacing some variables with their respective negation. Checking the existence of such a replacement can be done in linear time; therefore, the satisfiability of such formulae is in P as it can be solved by first performing this replacement and then checking the satisfiability of the resulting Horn formula. Horn satisfiability and renamable Horn satisfiability provide one of two important subclasses of satisfiability that are solvable in polynomial time; the other such subclass is 2-satisfiability.

===Dual-Horn SAT===

A dual variant of Horn SAT is Dual-Horn SAT, in which each clause has at most one negative literal. Negating all variables transforms an instance of Dual-Horn SAT into Horn SAT. It was proven in 1951 by Horn that Dual-Horn SAT is in P.

<text>The Receiver of Wreck is an official who administers law dealing with maritime wrecks and salvage in some countries having a British administrative heritage. In the United Kingdom, the Receiver of Wreck is also appointed to retain the possession of royal fish on behalf of the British crown.

==Countries having a Receiver of Wreck==
In the United Kingdom, the Receiver of Wreck, a post defined under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, is an official of the British Government whose main task is to administer the law in relation to Wreck and Salvage. Operating on behalf of the Department for Transport, the Receiver of Wreck is located within the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Until 1993, the role was carried out by numerous coastal customs officials. Nowadays, the Receiver is based in Southampton, and is helped by local outposts of His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard. 

The UK post holder as of Nov 2023 is Stephen White. 

In Cornwall the receiver of wreck and royal fish is the Receiver General of the Duchy of Cornwall, a role previously fulfilled by the Havener of Cornwall.

Elsewhere in the British Isles, each of the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man have their own laws of wreck and salvage and their own Receiver of Wreck.

In Ireland a Receiver of Wreck is a Revenue Official appointed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport with the consent of the Revenue Commissioners whose duty is to deal with any wreck found in or on the shores of the sea or any tidal water or harbour.

Canada has a Receiver of Wreck, authorized by Part VI of the Canada Shipping Act. The Navigation Protection Program of Transport Canada is responsible for administering this program.

==History==
Traditionally, salvage was an important economic source in coastal areas and sometimes exposed the savage and merciless nature of those around the coast. Folklore has it that some coastal dwellers enticed ships to a watery grave by luring them onto the rocks. This was known as wrecking. So that order could be maintained and local people encouraged to save those in peril and their belongings rather than pillage them, receivers of wreck were appointed to keep order and reward those who assisted in a wreck event. Historically, receivers were given powers which allowed them to &quot;hurt, maim or kill&quot; anyone obstructing them in their duties. Theoretically at least, receivers of wreck were permitted to carry weapons with which to defend themselves whilst carrying out their duties up until 1997.

The act of 1995 updates the prior Merchant Shipping Act 1894 (57 &amp; 58 Vict. c. 60). The receiver is an official under Admiralty Jurisdiction.

== Role of the Receiver of Wreck ==
The main task of the Receiver of Wreck is to process reports of wreck, in the interest of both finder and owner. This involves researching ownership and working with the finder, owner, archaeologists, museums, and other interested parties. The process of reporting wreck provides legal owners the opportunity to be reunited with their property and to ensure that law-abiding finders of wreck receive appropriate recognition in the form of a salvage award.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency administers Section 2 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973, which protects wrecks that are deemed dangerous by virtue of their contents. There is a strict no entry policy. This is in the interest of safety of both divers and members of the public. Two wrecks are protected under Section 2 of the Act: the SS &quot;Richard Montgomery&quot; and the SS &quot;Castilian&quot;, which are both from the Second World War and contain dangerous quantities of explosives.

The Receiver of Wreck also undertakes the task of disposing of &quot;royal fish&quot; in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not in Cornwall or Scotland. &quot;Royal fish&quot; are dead whales, dolphins, porpoises and sturgeon. This is an ancient right dating back to Edward II&#x27;s reign which falls under the royal prerogative.

==What is wreck?==
The Receiver of Wreck&#x27;s remit is set down in the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, Part IX, Chapters 1-2. It covers wreck from UK territorial waters (within 12 nautical miles), and wreck landed in the UK from outside UK territorial waters. Wreck material includes any part of a vessel, aircraft or hovercraft including any of its cargo or equipment.

According to section 255 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, wreck includes &quot;jetsam, flotsam, lagan or derelict&quot;. The Act does not define these terms, but they may be understood as follows:

*Flotsam are goods lost from a ship which has sunk or otherwise perished which are recoverable because they have floated.
*Jetsam are goods cast overboard (jettisoned) in order to lighten a vessel which is in danger of sinking, even if they ultimately perish.
*Derelict is property which has been abandoned and deserted at sea by those who were in charge without any hope of recovering it. This includes vessels and cargo.
*Lagan (or ligan) are goods cast overboard from a ship, buoyed so that they can be recovered later.

Boats that have come off their moorings are not normally classified as wreck as they have not been abandoned without hope of recovery. Also, buoys including marker buoys, mooring buoys etc., other than those that are fishing equipment, are not normally classed as wreck.

==UK wreck law==
It is a legal requirement under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 that all recovered wreck material landed in the United Kingdom must be reported to the Receiver of Wreck, whether recovered from within or outside UK waters and even if the finder is the owner. All wreck material recovered must be reported, however small or insignificant it may seem.

The Receiver of Wreck will investigate ownership of the recovered items. The owner has one year, after the material has been reported, in which to come forward and prove title to the property. During this period it is common for the finder to hold the wreck on behalf of the Receiver of Wreck while investigations are carried out. Finders should assume that all wreck items have an owner. It is possible for wreck material to be owned by an individual, a company, a dive club, an insurance company, the Ministry of Defence or the Department for Transport.

Wreck from UK waters which is still unclaimed at the end of one year becomes the property of the Crown (or grantee of the Crown such as the Duchy of Cornwall). Any person who believes that they are entitled to unclaimed wreck must provide evidence of entitlement to the satisfaction of the Receiver. If wreck from UK territorial waters is unclaimed at the end of one year, the Receiver will dispose of the find on behalf of the Crown. If wreck from outside UK territorial waters is unclaimed at the end of one year, the Crown makes no claim, and the material is returned to the finder. Often the finder is allowed to keep items of unclaimed wreck in lieu of a salvage award.

Wreck and Salvage in the UK is covered by three main Acts. These are the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 and the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. In simple terms, the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 and the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 detail what salvors cannot do, and the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 covers what salvors can or must do.

For a complete list of wrecks protected under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973, see List of designations under the Protection of Wrecks Act.

Wreck can be reported to the Receiver by completing a Report of Wreck and Salvage Form, known as a Droit.

==Penalties==
There are several penalties associated with wreck and salvage outlined in the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 and the Receiver has a duty to investigate any report of possible offences regarding the treatment of wreck. If the investigation reveals sufficient evidence, the Receiver may prosecute those suspected of having committed an offence. To enable the Receiver of Wreck to enforce the law the Receiver is awarded several powers by the Secretary of State.

==In popular culture==
*The Receiver of Wreck was mentioned by Hammond Innes in the novel (and film based on the novel) &quot;The Wreck of the Mary Deare&quot;.
*Show of Hands, an English folk band, sing about the Receiver of Wreck in the song &quot;The Napoli&quot;. This was inspired by the wreck of the MSC &quot;Napoli&quot;, which was grounded in Branscombe Bay and subsequently lost many containers which were washed up on the beach, before being rifled through by people flocking to the small village.

<doc id="1227528" wikidata="Q6132141" url="?curid=1227528" title="James D. Hudnall">
<text>James David Hudnall (April 10, 1957 – April 9, 2019) was an American writer who began his career in the comic book field in 1986 with the series &quot;Espers&quot;, published by Eclipse Comics. He later worked for Marvel and DC on such titles as &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and his own creation &quot;Interface&quot;, which was a sequel to &quot;Espers&quot;. He also wrote graphic novels such as &quot;Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography&quot;, &quot;Sinking&quot;, &quot;Streets&quot; and &quot;The Psycho&quot;.

His series &quot;Harsh Realm&quot; was adapted to television by &quot;X-Files&quot; producer Chris Carter in 1998. Hudnall and co-creator Andrew Paquette sued Carter and Fox Television when they failed to give them credits on the show. The suit was later settled and as part of the settlement Hudnall and Paquette received credit in the opening titles of the show,

Hudnall&#x27;s other works includes: &quot;The Age of Heroes&quot;, &quot;Aftermath&quot;, &quot;Shut Up And Die&quot;, &quot;Two to the Chest&quot;, &quot;Chiller&quot;, &quot;Devastator&quot;, &quot;Hardcase&quot; and &quot;The Solution&quot;. He wrote a libertarian leaning blog under the Pajamas Media group, a network of political blogs.

==Early life==
Hudnall&#x27;s parents divorced when he was two and his mother remarried to a man in the US Navy. The family settled in San Diego, California in the 1970s, and after graduating from Point Loma High School, Hudnall joined the U.S. Air Force in 1976. He was stationed in England.

After his discharge from the Air Force, Hudnall went to Coleman College in San Diego where he majored in computer science. He worked as a computer software consultant in Orange County, California, Sonoma County, and briefly in England. On returning to the states, he settled in Orange County, Ca where he began to read comics again. This renewed his interest in the medium and got him interested in writing, which was an earlier ambition. Hudnall attempted to self-publish a comic in 1982.

==Comics career==
In 1985, he started working with Eclipse Comics as a marketing director. In 1986 his first comic was published - &quot;Espers&quot;. From there, he went on to work for Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Image, Dark Horse and Malibu.

Hudnall switched from writing comics to internet development in the late 1990s, while producing more limited work over the years, such as &quot;Trigs&quot; for Humanoids and &quot;2 To the Chest&quot; from his own company Dark Planet Productions.

In 2009, he began writing for the Andrew Breitbart blog Big Hollywood.

Hudnall later went into digital comics in 2012 when David Lloyd created the online comics anthology &quot;Aces Weekly&quot; with Val Mayerik.

In the fall of 2013, Hudnall released his first novel, &quot;The Age of Heroes: Hell&#x27;s Reward&quot;, which is part of a planned series. A second series of novels, the Secret Team, is slated to debut in 2015.

==Health==
Hudnall had diabetes, which in 2015 led to the amputation of his right leg. He died April 9, 2019, one day prior to his 62nd birthday.

==Awards and recognition==
His graphic novel, &quot;Sinking&quot;, which is the fictional autobiography of a schizophrenic, earned him an Eisner Award nomination. The Brazilian translation of &quot;Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography,&quot; published by Editora Abril in 1990, won the Brazilian award Troféu HQ Mix for best special edition.

In 2017 Hudnall received the Inkpot Award for his career in comics at San Diego Comic-Con.

<doc id="1227532" wikidata="Q814630" url="?curid=1227532" title="The Kids of Degrassi Street">
<text>The Kids of Degrassi Street is a Canadian children&#x27;s television series created by Kit Hood and Linda Schuyler. The first entry in the &quot;Degrassi&quot; franchise and the only one to focus on children instead of teenagers, it follows the lives of a group of children living on De Grassi Street in Toronto. It was produced by Hood and Schuyler&#x27;s independent company Playing With Time. The series originated as a collection of annual standalone short films that started with &quot;Ida Makes a Movie,&quot; a live-action adaptation of the Kay Chorao book which premiered on the CBC on December 8, 1979. It became a full series in 1982 when the CBC ordered five more episodes.

It is notable for featuring several actors who would later star in &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; and &quot;Degrassi High&quot; playing different characters.

== Development ==
Linda Schuyler, a seventh and eighth grade teacher at Earl Grey Senior Public School in Toronto, formed the company Playing With Time with Kit Hood in 1976. At the time, Schuyler had been teaching her students an early version of media studies, which included filmmaking with Super-8 film. Discovering that there was a lack of resources on the subject, Earl Grey librarian Bruce Mackey ordered several books about filmmaking, one of which was the picture book &quot;Ida Makes a Movie&quot;, which was written by Kay Chorao.

Neither were aware that &quot;Ida Makes A Movie&quot; was a preschool book, in which the titular character was a cat. Nonetheless, Schuyler felt the story was powerful, and became interested in making a live-action adaptation, featuring children instead of cats. She sought the advice of then-lawyer and future Epitome Pictures co-founder Stephen Stohn, who advised her to forego a lawyer, and instead propose the deal herself. Schuyler flew to New York, where she met with Chorao and secured a $200 deal to adapt the book into a movie. Yan Moore, who would eventually become &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; and &quot;Degrassi High&quot;&#x27;s head writer, became a writer for the series after he rectified problems with the story of the episode &quot;Casey Draws The Line&quot;.

==Shooting==
The series was shot in Toronto.

=== Opening sequence and music ===
The opening sequence consists of a short piano piece, set to black and white stills of the Leslieville neighbourhood.

Wendy Watson and Lewis Manne, who later composed the music for &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; and &quot;Degrassi High&quot;, composed the music for &quot;The Kids Of Degrassi Street&quot;, with John Forbes initially performing the music on a Fairlight CMI.

==Cast==
&quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street&quot; featured many of the same actors who would later appear on &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; and &quot;Degrassi High&quot;, including Stacie Mistysyn, Neil Hope, Anais Granofsky, Sarah Charlesworth, John Ioannou, in different unrelated roles.

==Episodes==
==Broadcast==
Ida Makes A Movie premiered on CBC on December 8, 1979. By 1982, the CBC, enamored with the short films that Hood and Schuyler were producing, ordered five more, effectively turning the annual movies into a television series. In the lead-up to Degrassi Junior High, the series was re-run on Sundays at 5:00pm, until it was replaced by its successor in the same timeslot. In the United Kingdom, the series debuted on BBC One on July 9, 1984, with the final episode airing on June 16, 1986. In Australia, the series debuted at 6:00pm on February 2, 1987, on ABC TV.

== Print media ==
In late 1986, James Lorimer &amp; Company published a series of illustrated paperback books based on the television series, written by Schuyler and Hood with the assistance of author Eve Jennings.

==Home media==
On July 31, 2007, WGBH Boston Home Video released &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

In Region 4, Beyond Home Entertainment released the entire series on DVD in Australia on March 12, 2008.

<text>Tășnad (; Hungarian: &quot;Tasnád&quot;, : ; German: &quot;Trestenburg&quot;) is a town in Satu Mare County, Crișana, Romania. It administers five villages: Blaja (&quot;Tasnádbalázsháza&quot;), Cig (&quot;Csög&quot;), Rațiu (&quot;Ráctanya&quot;), Sărăuad (&quot;Tasnádszarvad&quot;), and Valea Morii (&quot;Tasnádmalomszeg&quot;).

The town lies on the banks of the river Santău. At about from the center lies the &quot;Tășnad geothermal Spa&quot;, known in Romania and abroad for its thermal waters.

==Demographics==

At the 2011 census, there were 8,411 people living within the city; of those, 51.1% were ethnic Romanians, while 36.2% are ethnic Hungarians, 11.4% ethnic Romani, and 1,1% others. At the 2021 census, Tășnad had a population of 8,058, of which 50.48% were Romanians, 27.93% Hungarians, and 14.36% Roma. 

As of 2022, the city contains the Reformed Church, a Baptist Church, the Orthodox cathedral, a Roman Catholic church, and a Greek Catholic church.

Dr. Abraham Fuchs wrote a comprehensive historical book about Tășnad as it was up to World War II. The book is in Hebrew and describes the vibrant Jewish life in this small town up until its destruction in 1944.

==History==
At the archaeological site of Tășnad-Sere in the Spa-area, finds from the Neolithic Körös, Pișcolt, and Baden cultures have been made as well as remains from the late Iron Age and the migration period (Chernyakhov culture). Since 2012, Ulrike Sommer from the UCL Institute of Archaeology in London has conducted excavations of the Körös site together with the Satu Mare Museum. Until 1876, Tășnad was part of Közép-Szolnok County when it was incorporated in the newly formed Szilágy County of the Kingdom of Hungary. 

After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, and the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Romanian Army took control of Tășnad in April 1919, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The city officially became part of the territory ceded to the Kingdom of Romania in June 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon. In August 1940, under the auspices of Nazi Germany, which imposed the Second Vienna Award, Hungary retook the territory of Northern Transylvania (which included Tășnad) from Romania. Towards the end of World War II, however, the city was taken back from Hungarian and German troops by Romanian and Soviet forces in October 1944.

<doc id="1227547" wikidata="Q565753" url="?curid=1227547" title="Otto Lohmüller">
<text>Otto Lohmüller (born 4 February 1943 in Gengenbach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) is a German figurative painter, sculptor and book illustrator. His art typically features images of early adolescent males, both clothed and nude, although in his published work there is little overt eroticism.

He works almost exclusively with the human form, usually with minimal backgrounds, in an idealized near-photographic realist style. In addition to boys, his portraits and sculpture include people of all ages from his town, people from his travels to India and Southeast Asia, and occasionally public figures. Some of his works contain subtle political or societal commentary, although this is not a major theme. Occasionally he indulges in wryly humorous works of fantasy, but is primarily a representational artist. His published works are listed in the Catalog of the German National Library.

==Biography==
Lohmüller was born in Gengenbach in 1943, where he grew up. In 1952 he joined the Boy Scouts. His artistic interests at the time included the sculptures and frescoes of Michelangelo, as well as classical Greek works, and the Boy Scouts illustration work of Pierre Joubert. In 1960 he moved to Paris, where he continued to study art independently. In 1961 he began an apprenticeship in Offenburg as a printer, and took an interest in the work of Caravaggio.

In 1965 he met Ute Wissing, whom he married four years later. The couple lived in Munich, Offenburg, and then Gengenbach, where their first son David was born in 1975. He began working in sculpture, and exhibiting his work to the public. Their second son Adrian was born in 1977. In 1978 he published a small art pamphlet &quot;Otto Lohmüller – portraits and acts from in 1972–1977&quot;.

Since 1982 he has illustrated songbooks, publications of poems, and books for the local Boy Scouts. In 1984 he joined the Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur (German Association for Free Body Culture). He founded the publishing company Zeus Press to produce art volumes of his work.

He became a Boy Scout leader, and illustrated and wrote travel reports of the &quot;Tempelritter&quot; (Temple Knight) troop. In 1989 he joined the Comité pour la Promotion du Scoutisme en Europe (COPSE = Committee for the Promotion of Scouting in Europe), becoming a vice-president of the organization.

<text>USS &quot;Ellet&quot; (DD-398) was a &quot;Benham&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for five members of the Ellet family of Pennsylvania who rendered service during the American Civil War: Colonel Charles Ellet, Jr.; Brigadier General Alfred W. Ellet; Colonel Charles R. Ellet; Lieutenant Colonel John A. Ellet; and Edward C. Ellet. The first two officers commanded the United States Ram Fleet.

==History==
&quot;Ellet&quot; (DD-398) was launched 11 June 1938 by Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Kearny, New Jersey; sponsored by Miss Elvira Daniel Cabell, granddaughter of Colonel Charles Ellet, Jr.; and commissioned 17 February 1939.

In September and October 1939 &quot;Ellet&quot; operated off the Grand Banks on Neutrality Patrol, then with Destroyer Division 18 out of Galveston with the West Gulf Patrol. Based at San Diego, after 26 February 1940, she joined in Battle Force maneuvers as far as Hawaii. In the summer of 1941 her home port became Pearl Harbor and in October she brought home an Army survey expedition from Christmas Island to Honolulu.

When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor 7 December 1941, &quot;Ellet&quot; was returning from reinforcing Wake Island in the screen of TF 8 with which she remained throughout December. After a convoy escort voyage to the west coast, she guarded a troop convoy back to Christmas Island in February.

In April she screened Carrier TF 16, which launched B-25&#x27;s in the famous Halsey-Doolittle Raid on Tokyo and other Japanese cities and returned to Pearl Harbor the 25th. The same ships raced 5 days later to reinforce the carriers headed for the Battle of the Coral Sea. It was won before &quot;Ellet&#x27;s&quot; force got there, so TF 16 returned to Pearl Harbor. TF 16 sailed from Pearl Harbor 28 May 1942 once more to join Task Force 17 (TF 17). Together they turned back the Japanese fleet in the Battle of Midway on 4, 5 and 6 June. The Japanese lost four carriers, many aircraft, and a number of irreplaceable aviators. &quot;Ellet&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 June to prepare for invading the Solomons, the first American land offensive of the war.

&quot;Ellet&quot; arrived off Guadalcanal 7 August 1942 for pre-invasion bombardment, patrolled the transport area, and fought off air attacks. On 9 August she rescued 41 officers and 451 men from &quot;Quincy&quot; (CA-39) and 1 man from &quot;Astoria&quot; (CA-34), sunk in the Battle of Savo Island the night before, then joined &quot;Selfridge&quot; (DD-357) in the duty of sinking the hulk of HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot;, hopelessly battered in the same battle. While escorting transports deadheading back to Nouméa, &quot;Ellet&quot; was detached 12 August to screen the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CV-6) task force covering reinforcement and supply of the Solomons. She got back to Pearl Harbor 10 September.

Out of Espiritu Santo &quot;Ellet&quot; patrolled to the Solomons with TF 16 from November 1942 until May 1943, then returned to Pearl Harbor. Back at Espiritu Santo 1 July, she hurried to Tulagi for the consolidation of the northern Solomons. She sailed for overhaul on the west coast in September 1943.

By the end of January 1944, &quot;Ellet&quot; was back in action, screening carriers about to invade the Marshalls. After a week in Pearl Harbor for repairs, she saw action in New Guinea, supporting the operations at Hollandia in April. Upon her return to Pearl Harbor she joined the 5th Fleet for the invasion of the Marianas, screening diversionary raids on the Bonins, and carriers in the assaults on Saipan and Guam.

&quot;Ellet&quot; arrived at Ulithi Atoll 13 October 1944 and was sent to scout neighboring Ngulu Atoll for a proposed secondary fleet anchorage. Troops landed at Ngulu 16 October. When &quot;Montgomery&quot; (DM-17) struck a mine the 17th, &quot;Ellet&quot; came to the rescue with pumps then towed her in to Ulithi lagoon.

At October&#x27;s end, &quot;Ellet&quot; joined the Marianas Patrol and Escort Group. She bombarded Iwo Jima, in December 1944 and the following January. Based on Guam and Saipan, she escorted convoys and patrolled on air-sea rescue station until July 1945.

When hostilities ended, &quot;Ellet&quot; was repairing at Mare Island. She was decommissioned there 29 October 1945, and sold 1 August 1947.

==Honors==
&quot;Ellet&quot; received 10 battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="1227552" wikidata="Q2743825" url="?curid=1227552" title="Degrassi High">
<text>Degrassi High is a Canadian teen drama television series created by Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood. It is the third entry in the &quot;Degrassi&quot; franchise and the direct continuation of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, and was broadcast on the CBC from 6 November 1989 to 18 February 1991.

The series follows the lives of those attending the titular fictional school. It addresses a variety of topics, ranging from mundane coming-of-age dilemmas to serious and controversial topics such as abortion, cancer, suicide and HIV/AIDS. It was filmed entirely on-location in Toronto, with the Centennial College Story Arts Centre used as the school. The series was critically acclaimed, with particular praise afforded to the series premiere, &quot;A New Start&quot;, which portrayed abortion. A small controversy arose involving the episode when PBS removed a scene of anti-abortion protesters against the wishes of Hood and Schuyler. The show received six awards, including a Prix Jeunesse and four Chris Awards, and seven nominations, including for several actors.

The end of the series, despite good ratings, was the result of multiple behind-the-scenes problems, including creative exhaustion and the aging cast, which led to the loss of its funding. as well as the feeling that the show had run its course. A post-graduation television film, &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;, and a non-fiction docuseries, &quot;Degrassi Talks&quot;, appeared in 1992 and officially ended the franchise until its revival with &quot;&quot; (2001–2015).

* Byrd Dickens as Scott Smith, a senior student who begins dating Kathleen Mead; it later transpires that he is violently abusive, and eventually Kathleen breaks up with him.
* Vincent Walsh as Patrick, an Irish-born student who briefly dates Spike. In season two, they break up offscreen, and he briefly dates Liz, much to Spike&#x27;s chagrin.
* L. Dean Ifill as Basil &quot;Bronco&quot; Davis, president of the student council, who later starts dating Lucy.

== Development ==
=== Concept and creation ===
&quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, which was created by Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood, premiered on the CBC on 18 January 1987 and garnered widespread acclaim from critics for its realistic portrayal of teenage issues. It won several accolades, including an International Emmy Award in 1987, and four Gemini Awards in 1988. Schuyler mentioned the prospects of continuing the show with a high school setting on multiple occasions. In April 1988, Schuyler mentioned to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that while she was concentrated on the third season of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, a high school continuation was a &quot;probability&quot;. In November 1988, she told the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; that while the cast worked well together for a sequel to work, &quot;the demographics for CBC favor staying with Junior High — so do we get an all-new cast? Or do I retire and go to tennis camp in the Caribbean?&quot; It was decided to continue with &quot;Degrassi High&quot; so that more serious and complex issues could be dealt with, including abortion, which was addressed in the series premiere. According to Schuyler: &quot;As the kids get older, the only way we can remain true to this age group is by growing with them. Therefore, the issues get more complex.&quot;

On 10 January 1989, Greg Quill of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that a spokesman for the producers confirmed the development of &quot;Degrassi High,&quot; but then subsequently reported on 27 February that no decision had been reportedly made about a sequel. On 13 May 1989, Sid Adilman reported in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that filming for &quot;Degrassi High&quot; would begin soon. In the series finale of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, the titular school is destroyed in a fire. To keep the entire cast together, a creative decision was made to move the younger students displaced by the fire to the new school to join those that had already graduated. Conversely, the grade 7 students introduced in the third season of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; were accelerated to grade 9 for an unspecified reason. To give the series a &quot;harder-edged feel&quot;, several older characters were introduced. Reflecting the growing independence of the aging characters, &quot;Degrassi High&quot; began to give more focus to the characters&#x27; lives outside of school, with scenes taking place at nighttime, on the street, or at the characters&#x27; jobs. In contrast to &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, in which the extras were still made known to the viewers, the newer series would include a team of &quot;extra extras&quot;, who would simply appear for no other purpose than to fill the background.

=== Filming ===
Filming for &quot;Degrassi High&quot; started in May 1989, and ended in October 1990. The series was filmed at the Story Arts Centre of Centennial College, located on Toronto&#x27;s Carlaw Avenue. Formerly a teacher&#x27;s college, the building was previously used to hold auditions for &quot;Ida Makes a Movie&quot;, the first episode of &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street&quot; and the first installment of the &quot;Degrassi&quot; franchise, in 1979. The building was chosen as despite being part of a college, it more closely resembled a high school. Other filming locations included the Rose Donut Shop on Carlaw Avenue, where character Michelle Accette briefly works after moving away from her conservative father.

=== Opening sequence ===
The &quot;Degrassi High&quot; theme song, composed by Lewis Manne and Wendy Watson and sung by Watson. is a reworking of the &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; theme song, this time transposed to a different key. It follows the same format as its predecessor, with various scenes of characters in and around the school, omitting individual cast credits. The opening sequence ends with a zooming shot of a girl&#x27;s backside as the logo is displayed.

The opening sequence contains scenes not included in the final cut, such as a shot of Arthur Kobalewscuy reacting to peanut butter smeared all over his bike; Kit Hood later said the scene and plotline surrounding it did not make the cut as the actor had grown too much to be a believable bullying victim.

=== Sets and design ===
According to Kathryn Ellis, &quot;A &quot;Degrassi&quot; character&#x27;s bedroom is the most telling set for that character&quot;. The bedroom of character Lucy Fernandez was made from drywall and located in the school library, with her bed being the same used in other character&#x27;s bedrooms. The childhood bedroom of character Liz O&#x27;Rourke, seen in a dream sequence in an episode where the character struggles with memories of her childhood sexual abuse, was made to look &quot;larger than life&quot; to make the young Liz seem extremely small, with the walls being painted blue for a &quot;cool, almost cold atmosphere&quot;. For the bedroom of character Arthur Kobalewscuy, various items from the previous series were re-used, as well as rock posters of the fictional group Gourmet Scum, to indicate that the character was maturing in his tastes.

== End of the series ==
Despite its continued critical and commercial acclaim, multiple factors contributed to the end of &quot;Degrassi&quot; in 1991. Kit Hood had become exhausted and frustrated by television work, having reluctantly agreed to the second season of &quot;Degrassi High&quot; &quot;to please the network and fans&quot;, and the partnership between Hood and Schuyler, both creatively and personally, was deteriorating. Schuyler detailed in her memoir &quot;The Mother Of All Degrassi&quot; that Hood was becoming increasingly temperamental towards the end of production; when learning of the second season renewal, he accused Schuyler of manipulating him and head writer Yan Moore into doing &quot;a year&#x27;s work that we don&#x27;t want to do&quot;. Compounding this was WGBH&#x27;s difficulty procuring funding from the PBS&#x27;s children&#x27;s department due to the aging cast, and consequently being forced to withdraw from the show.

In spite of these mounting issues, both Hood and Schuyler felt the series had run its course and wanted it to end before it became stale and predictable. In a 1990 news interview, Schuyler explained that they wanted to end the series &quot;while we were still feeling good about what we were doing&quot;, and that if they were to continue the series, they would have to &quot;completely re-vamp it&quot; and &quot;bring in a new set of characters&quot;, something they did not want to do. Schuyler noted that most of the cast were occupied with post-secondary education, and that she felt the show had already tackled what they had aimed to. In a 1998 web interview with fan site owner Natalie Earl, Hood elaborated:

Schuyler informed CBC programming chief Ivan Fecan that they would not be able to produce any more of &quot;Degrassi High&quot;. Fecan enthusiastically accepted Schuyler&#x27;s proposal to end the series with a feature-length film.

Degrassi High premiered on November 6, 1989, on CBC with the two-part episode &quot;A New Start&quot;, a week following the documentary &quot;Degrassi Between Takes&quot;. In the United States, the series debuted on January 14, 1990, on PBS. In Australia, it debuted on ABC TV on September 2, 1990. On the ABC, broadcasts of the series were preceded with a disclaimer that read: &quot;Viewer Advice: The following episode of &quot;Degrassi High&quot; contains themes appropriate to a teenage audience. Some parents may consider it inappropriate for younger children&quot;. Re-runs aired on ABC-TV until 1995.

=== Post-broadcast distribution ===
The series continued in re-runs on CBC during the late 1990s. On September 1, 1997, the series debuted on Showcase, where it aired back-to-back with &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;.

In July 2023, &quot;Degrassi High&quot; and &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; were made available on Amazon Prime Video in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
== Reception and impact ==
=== Critical reception ===
As with &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, &quot;Degrassi High&quot; was largely acclaimed by critics for many of the same reasons as the previous series. The premiere episode, &quot;A New Start&quot;. which centres on a student becoming pregnant and deciding to have an abortion, was a particular point of praise; writing for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Antonia Zerbisias acclaimed the episode and called it &quot;a gutsy show, particularly in the light of the current political and emotional climate [of the 1980s]&quot;, and singled out the even-handed portrayal of abortion and the polarisation surrounding the topic. Furthermore, she quipped that if the show was an American prime time show, &quot;the whole thing would turn out to be a hilarious mix-up. We&#x27;d have lots of eye-rolling, sophomoric one-liners about burgeoning bellies and then ooops! Turns out the smart alec kid brother merely murdered the bunny for a school science project.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Province&quot;, Lee Bacchus had mixed feelings about the debut. While feeling the show continued its predecessor&#x27;s realism, Bacchus felt that it simplified the issue to &quot;the bumper-sticker level of righteous moralism&quot; and &quot;lofty platitudes&quot;.

Overall reviews of the series were similarly positive. Writing for &quot;The Age&quot;, Margaret Geddes declared that the series gave Australian soap operas such as &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; &quot;a run for their money&quot;, but unlike the &quot;trite morality plays&quot; she felt were pervasive in those shows, &quot;Degrassi High&quot; was more realistic and thoughtful. Furthermore, she noted a comparison between the series and the British series &quot;Grange Hill&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, Lynne Heffley declared that &quot;Degrassi High&quot; had proved itself to be one of the &quot;gutsiest shows on television&quot;. Profiling the show in the lead-up to the debut of its final season, Kelli Pryor of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;In a television landscape where the high jinks of characters like the Fox network’s Parker Lewis often define high school life, &quot;Degrassi&quot; stands out as the &quot;thirtysomething&quot; of the book-bag set.&quot;

=== Censorship ===
The series premiere was shown uncensored on CBC. In the United States, scenes of anti-abortion protesters were removed by PBS. Kate Taylor, co-producer of the series and of WGBH Educational Foundation, defended this as an &quot;[a]esthetic decision&quot; that made for a &quot;more powerful, more poignant&quot; ending. This was done without the permission of Playing With Time, the show&#x27;s production company, with Kit Hood denouncing it as &quot;an American ending -- happy, safe but incomplete&quot; and requesting his name be removed from the PBS broadcast credits. Likewise, when the series re-ran on Noggin&#x27;s teen block The N in 2005, &quot;A New Start&quot; was omitted, as well as the third episode &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard To Do&quot;, as it referenced the events of &quot;A New Start&quot;. When the episode &quot;It Creeps!&quot;, which centres around several students shooting a horror movie in the school, aired on ABC-TV in Australia in 1991, various scenes depicting graphic violence were removed. When the episode was shown again unedited on ABC2 on March 28, 2009, two viewers complained.

<text>The Büraburg was a prominent hill castle with historic significance, on the Büraberg hill overlooking the Eder river near the town of Fritzlar in northern Hesse (Germany). Only foundation walls remain, and a church dedicated to St. Brigida.

A Christian monastery was already located on the hill in the seventh century. It was occupied by the Franks c. 690, who fortified it with a castle and kept a mounted garrison there. The Franks supported the missionary efforts of Saint Boniface, who cut down the Donar Oak in nearby Geismar and established a short-lived bishopric in Büraburg.

==Background==
===Strategic importance===

Hessia, from the early seventh century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the Saxons (to the north) and the Franks who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied Thuringia (to the east) in 531.

By 650, the Franks were establishing themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and were building fortifications in various places including Christenberg. By 690 they were taking direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in Gaulskopf and Eresburg across the river Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. Büraburg (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century) was one of the places the Franks fortified in order to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay the Büraburg was &quot;probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years&quot;. Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed &quot;8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely populated heart of Hessia&quot;. The presence of a mounted garrison is deduced from archeological finds, including spurs, harness fittings, and fragments of weapons.

During the Saxon wars of Charlemagne, it was an important fortified base of the Franks, but with the final submission of the Saxons in 804 it lost its military significance.

===Religion===
The area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the first century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the fifth century BC. Excavations have produced a horse burial and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called &quot;Heilgenbron&quot;; the name &quot;Geismar&quot; (possibly &quot;energetic pool&quot;) itself may be derived from that spring. The village of , now a part of Gudensberg near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center: the basalt outcrop of Gudensberg is named for Wodan, and there is a two-meter tall quartz megalith called the &quot;Wotanstein&quot; in the center of the village.

Büraburg itself contained a Christian settlement before Boniface. The St. Brigida church was dated to the time of the Hiberno-Scottish mission by Joseph Vonderau, a Fulda archeologist who excavated Büraburg in the 1920s. According to Wand, the church must have been founded later; he states it probably served the Frankish fortress whose construction he dated c. 690. Though one scholar considers that Wand&#x27;s later dating is correct and that there is no reason to assume the church was already named for St. Brigid, recent scholarship suggests perhaps Vonderau was correct in assuming the Hiberno-Scottish background. For instance, after renovations from 2002-2006, pieces of wood were found in the chancel arch that dated back to between the mid-sixth century and 667/668. This may mean that the church predates even the mission of Saint Kilian, who may have preached in the area in the 680s and was killed in Thuringia in 689—or it may mean that older wood was used to construct the church. Wand&#x27;s excavations (1969-1996) revealed a monastic complex whose oldest layer contains a cistern lined with stone; one of those stones featured an inscription of the Benedictine cross. The complex could have housed an abbot with up to six monks. Excavations have shown traces of at least sixty buildings (not all from the same time period).

John-Henry Clay considers it likely that the church was indeed Hiberno-Scottish and dates from the earliest fortification, using wood from some nearby building. The connection between Kilian and Boniface is not unique; in Wurzburg Boniface promoted Kilian&#x27;s cult, and he may have used the cistern in Büraburg as a baptismal font, continuing missionary work that already started before he came to the area.

==Donar Oak and bishopric==

In 723 AD the Anglo-Saxon missionary Saint Boniface arrived in the area on his mission to convert the central and northern German tribes to Christianity. Seeking to demonstrate the superiority of Christianity, he and his followers felled a sacred oak dedicated to the god Donar (Thor) by the local tribe of the Chatten/Chatti. His hagiography claims that when Thor failed to punish Boniface for his infraction, the locals agreed to be baptized.

Using the wood of the oak, Boniface erected a small chapel dedicated to Saint Peter at a site nearby, in what soon became the important religious, intellectual, and trade center of Fritzlar. Between 723 and 741 Büraburg may have been led by an abbot Humbert, or so local traditions hold. In 742 Boniface established a bishopric at Büraburg, the first in Germany north of the Roman Limes, but after the death of the only bishop, Witta, in 748 the bishopric was incorporated by Lullus, Boniface&#x27;s successor as archbishop of Mainz, into his own diocese. From 747 to 786 Büraburg was administered by an auxiliary bishop, Meginoz, but this post was not filled again after Meginoz&#x27;s death.

==Current situation==
Excavations have unearthed extensive fortifications from the 7th and 8th century AD on the hilltop. Today, a church dedicated to St. Brigida stands at the site, containing parts of the original church building from the 7th century.

<text>Pilkington is a glass-manufacturing company which is based in Lathom, Lancashire, England. It includes several legal entities in the UK, and is a subsidiary of Japanese company Nippon Sheet Glass (NSG). It was formerly an independent company listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

Established in 1826 as the &quot;St Helens Crown Glass Company&quot;, the company gradually grew to become the largest employer in St Helens, where it was originally based. It was renamed &quot;Pilkington Brothers&quot; in 1845 following the ending of the partnership with the Greenall family, the business continued to expand, becoming &quot;Pilkington Brothers Limited&quot; after its incorporation in 1894. In 1903, it became the sole British manufacturer of plate glass as well as the dominant producer of sheet glass. After the First World War, Pilkington was one of only two large glass manufacturers remaining in Britain, the other being Chance Brothers; the firm gradually expanded its stake in Chance, fully acquired it in 1951.

The company performed strongly during the Second World War, fulfilling all wartime demands and emerged in a relatively strong position in the conflict&#x27;s aftermath. During the 1950s, Pilkington employees Alastair Pilkington (no family relation) and Kenneth Bickerstaff invented the float glass process; the firm leveraged licensing agreements for many other manufacturers to use this new process in exchange for royalty payments. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Pilkington invested heavily into its manufacturing sites and acquired numerous overseas competitors. It also became a major world supplier of toughened and laminated safety glass via its controlling interest in Triplex Safety Glass.

During 1970, Pilkington was floated as a public company on the London Stock Exchange; prior to this, the firm had been owned by a combination of descendants of the Pilkington family and several employee trusts. In late 1985, Pilkington was the subject of a hostile takeover bid from BTR Industries which it successfully warded off. During the 1990s, amid allegations that Pilkington had organised a cartel due to its hold on the float glass market, the US government and Pilkington filed a proposed consent decree that released other businesses from several licensing terms. In late 2005, the company received an initial takeover bid from NSG; a second and more generous bid was accepted by Pilkington&#x27;s key shareholders. The acquisition was completed during June 2006; the combined company has since competed for global leadership of the glass industry.

==History==

The company was founded in 1826 as a partnership between members of the Pilkington and Greenall families, based in St Helens, Lancashire, England. The venture used the trading name of &quot;St Helens Crown Glass Company&quot;. The company grew to become the biggest employer in St Helens. The distinctive blue-glass head office tower block on Alexandra Business Park, off Prescot Road, originally used as the firm&#x27;s world headquarters, and completed in 1964, still dominates the town&#x27;s skyline.

Following the departure from the partnership of the last Greenall in 1845, the firm was renamed as &quot;Pilkington Brothers&quot;. During 1894, the business was incorporated under the Companies Act 1862 as &quot;Pilkington Brothers Limited&quot;. In 1903, it became the sole British manufacturer of plate glass as well as the dominant producer of sheet glass.

Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the company struck a series of market agreements with various domestic and European glass manufacturers of varying effectiveness. European competitors, particularly those based in Belgium, had applied considerable competitive pressure to Britain&#x27;s glass making industry; Pilkington was less susceptible due to a strong focus on exports and international developments throughout the British Empire and South America. The company also invested heavily into its manufacturing capabilities, such as a new plate glass works outside Doncaster in 1922, and introduced new production techniques.

After the First World War, Pilkington was one of only two large glass manufacturers remaining in Britain, the other being Chance Brothers, which mostly produced cast glass. The two companies formed various agreements during the interwar period to share the domestic market and to not undercut each other; furthermore, Pilkington agreed to purchase any shares in the firm that Chance&#x27;s owners wished to sell, thus it gradually built up a sizable stake in the firm. In 1951, Chance became wholly owned by Pilkington.

Pilkington found itself in a relatively strong position in the aftermath of the Second World War, having exclusively fulfilled Britain&#x27;s wartime requirements and even managing to expand its export activities. While there was no reintroduction of the pre-war quota arrangements and its historic undertakings with individual merchants were abandoned during 1950, the company still entered an export agreement with its competitors in the European mainland. Further reforms to its business practices were made in response to the enactment of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956.

Between 1953 and 1957, Pilkington employees Alastair Pilkington (no family relation) and Kenneth Bickerstaff invented the float glass process, a revolutionary method of high-quality flat glass production by floating molten glass over a bath of molten tin, avoiding the costly need to grind and polish plate glass to make it clear. Pilkington allowed the float process to be used under licence by numerous manufacturers around the world. Amongst other benefits, these licensing arrangements often helped the company to further its interests, including the expansion of its presence in the European market and even gaining stakes in other manufacturers.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Pilkington used the flow of float royalty payments to finance its investments in float glass plants across several countries, including Argentina, Australia, Canada and Sweden, and also to acquire major existing flat and safety glass producers and plants in the United States (Libbey Owens Ford), Germany and France. Pilkington, with its subsidiary Triplex Safety Glass, in which it gradually acquired a controlling interest, also became a major world supplier of toughened and laminated safety glass to the automotive, aerospace and building industries.

A Monopolies Commission report in 1967, concluded that Pilkington and Triplex operations were efficient and entrepreneurial and, despite their high share of the UK glass trade, operated in a manner suited to consumers&#x27; best interests. At the time, the majority of the company&#x27;s shareholding was largely in the hands of various descendants of the original owners or employee trusts.

During 1970, Pilkington was floated as a public company on the London Stock Exchange.

A rank-and-file strike during 1970, sparked off by an error in wage packets, brought 8,000 workers out for nearly two months. The General and Municipal Workers Union and Trades Union Congress leadership failed to provide any support, as they were too closely bound to management and government circles, with the result that strike leaders were blacklisted. Anti-union legislation was introduced by central government. These events were recreated in Ken Loach&#x27;s film &quot;The Rank and File&quot;, although the BBC insisted on a change in the name and location of the company, so that the film is set at a fictitious &quot;Wilkinsons&quot; factory in the Midlands.

In late 1985, Pilkington was the subject of a hostile takeover bid from BTR Industries, a large British-based conglomerate group, which valued the company at $1.64 billion. Pilington&#x27;s management rejected the offer and fought a successful defensive campaign in which various politicians took sides in the matter, thus BTR was compelled to withdraw its offer in February 1987.

===Litigation===
Pilkington aggressively protected its patents and trade secrets through a network of licensing agreements with glass manufacturers around the world. The modern &quot;float&quot; technique (pouring the molten glass on a layer of very pure molten tin) became commercially widespread when Alastair Pilkington developed a practical version, patented in the late 1950s and early 1960s. As Pilkington plc owned all but one of the manufacturing plants around the world employing the float process, Pilkington had a monopoly.

Although the patents had expired by the early 1980s, Pilkington had licensed their use, and required the licensees to keep the details of the float glass process secret. Guardian Industries had tried to challenge Pilkington&#x27;s dominance but had made a secret agreement to prevent new entrants into the market, with Guardian taking the lead to enable Pilkington, a British company, to reduce its exposure to United States antitrust law.

In May 1994, the United States Department of Justice filed suit on the grounds that Pilkington had created a cartel by exercising control over the markets in which its licensees could sell float glass and construct float-glass manufacturing plants, and over the customers within each market to which each licensee could serve. It was claimed this was a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, because Pilkington&#x27;s patents had expired and any trade secrets which it might have had in the process used by the licensees had long since become publicly known. On the same day, the US government and Pilkington filed a proposed consent decree, which enjoined Pilkington from enforcing these restrictions against its US licensees, or against US non-licensees, or against non-US licensees wishing to export either technology or glass products to the United States. The agreement came into force on 22 December 1994, and expired ten years later.

During 2008, the European Commission imposed a fine of €357 million on Pilkington, along with three other glass manufacturers, for its part in a five-year price-fixing scheme used in car windscreens.

===Pilkington Optronics===
In 1988, Pilkington plc formed a new subsidiary, Pilkington Optronics, in order to group together the company&#x27;s optronics businesses: Pilkington PE located in North Wales (formed in 1966), and Barr and Stroud (acquired in 1977) which was based in Glasgow. Pilkington PE later became Thales Optics Ltd., which was divested from Thales in December 2005 as Qioptiq Ltd.

Thomson-CSF acquired 50% of Pilkington Optronics in 1991. In 1995, Pilkington Optronics acquired Thorn EMI Electro Optics which was renamed Pilkington Thorn Optronics. Three years later, Thomson-CSF purchased another 40% of Pilkington Optronics from Pilkington and the remainder in 2000 to make it a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2000, Thomson-CSF was renamed Thales and Pilkington Optronics Ltd. became Thales Optronics Ltd. Soon afterward, Thomson-CSF acquired W Vinten Ltd, a British reconnaissance equipment manufacturer, including the Joint Reconnaissance Pod, who now operate as Thales Optronics (Bury St Edmunds) Ltd.

In November 2006, Thales Optronics Limited announced the closure of its manufacturing facility in Taunton, Somerset, with the loss of 180 jobs. In June 2007, Thales sold the beryllium mirrors and structures business of Thales Optronics Limited to GSI Group Inc. for an undisclosed amount.

===Takeover by NSG===
In late 2005, the company received a takeover bid from a bigger Japanese company, NSG, which had previously built up a 20 percent stake in the business by 2002. The initial bid and the first revised bid were not accepted, however, on 16 February 2006, NSG increased its offer for the 80 percent it did not already own to 165 pence per share (£1.8 billion or $3.14 billion in total) and this was accepted by Pilkington&#x27;s major institutional shareholders, enabling NSG to compulsorily acquire by scheme of arrangement the smaller holdings of other shareholders, many of them being existing and retired employees, who had not wished to support the takeover. The combined company would compete for global leadership in the glass industry with the leading Japanese glassmaker Asahi Glass, which had around a quarter of the global market at the time of the deal. Pilkington had 19% and NSG around half that.

The acquisition was completed in June 2006, after the European Commission stated that it would not be opposed. At the time of the merger, Pilkington and NSG had been the second- and third-largest glass manufacturers in the world, respectively.

<text>Godley &amp; Creme were an English rock duo formally established in Manchester in 1977 by Kevin Godley and Lol Creme. The pair began releasing music as a duo after their departure from the rock band 10cc. In 1979, they directed their first music video for their single &quot;An Englishman in New York&quot;. After this, they became involved in the production of videos for artists such as Ultravox, the Police, Yes, Duran Duran, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Huey Lewis and the News and Wang Chung, as well as directing the groundbreaking video for their 1985 single &quot;Cry&quot;. The duo split at the end of the 1980s. Both have since been involved in music videos, TV commercials, and sporadic music projects.

==History==
===Early years and 10cc===

Kevin Godley and Lol Creme met in the late 1950s and for a brief time were in an amateur band together. In the early 1960s they joined white R&amp;B combo The Sabres (The Magic Lanterns) together. Though they played in different bands, with Godley briefly in The Mockingbirds with Graham Gouldman, who would later work with Godley and Creme in 10cc.

After recording a one-off single under the name of &#x27;Yellow Bellow Room Boom&#x27; for UK CBS in 1967 (&quot;Seeing Things Green&quot; b/w &quot;Easy Life&quot;), the pair began their professional music career together in 1969, performing pop music in Strawberry Studios at Stockport near Manchester with Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman. The duo also released a single in 1969, &quot;I&#x27;m Beside Myself&quot; b/w &quot;Animal Song&quot;, under the name Frabjoy &amp; Runcible Spoon after being signed on to Marmalade Records directly by label head Giorgio Gomelsky. A 7-song LP was slated for a late 1969 release on Marmalade; however, the label collapsed under the weight of its financial situation before the end of the year, and the LP was shelved until its release in the 2022 compilation &quot;Frabjous Days: The Secret World of Godley &amp; Creme 1967–1969&quot; on Grapefruit Records.

Joined by Eric Stewart to form Hotlegs they first secured a chart success with the song &quot;Neanderthal Man&quot; which hit #2 in the UK. The band, after serving as the backing band for two successful Neil Sedaka albums, evolved into 10cc in 1972 when Graham Gouldman joined. 10cc went on to record four albums and enjoyed chart success, most notably with their 1975 single &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot;, a hit on both sides of the Atlantic.

===10cc split and later years===
After the release of 10cc&#x27;s fourth LP, &quot;How Dare You!&quot; (1976), Godley and Creme left the band to perfect a device they dubbed &quot;The Gizmo&quot; (Gizmotron), a module which attached to the bridge of an electric guitar. The Gizmo used small motor-driven rotating wheels which were pressed into contact with the strings, thus creating a continuous, violin-like &quot;bowing&quot; effect on all or any combination of strings, generating infinite sustain in voicings ranging from a single note to a full chord. The device was originally conceived as a cost-saving measure for 10cc. The group already owned and operated their own studio, and all four were talented singers and multi-instrumentalists who could also produce and engineer their own records, so their plan was that by using Gizmo-fitted electric guitars, with additional studio processing and overdubbing, they could create an almost infinite variety of sonic effects and orchestral textures &quot;in-house&quot;, saving them the considerable expense of hiring session players to add these textures using traditional instruments.

After recording a demonstration single using the Gizmo, their label (Mercury Records) allowed them to continue the project, and over the next year it expanded into a sprawling 3-LP concept album &quot;Consequences&quot; (1977) with an environmental theme. It contained vocals by Sarah Vaughan and an extended comedy performance by Peter Cook, and was issued in a lavish boxed set package with an accompanying booklet. According to the album&#x27;s liner notes, the duo&#x27;s original plan was to hire an all-star cast of comedians (including Peter Ustinov) to perform the album&#x27;s spoken-word components, but this was soon abandoned, partly due to the cost and logistical difficulty, but also because they quickly realised after meeting Peter Cook that he was able to perform all of the major roles himself. Unfortunately, by the time &quot;Consequences&quot; was finally released in late 1977, punk was in full swing, and the album was savaged by critics.

In a 1997 interview, Godley expressed regret that he and Creme had left 10cc, saying:

Creme also found the breakup painful, particularly as he and guitarist Eric Stewart are married to a pair of sisters, which made the decision more personal than professional.

The duo gradually regained critical favour with a trio of innovative albums in the late 1970s and early 1980s – &quot;L&quot; (1978), &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; (1979) and &quot;Ismism&quot; (1981, released as &quot;Snack Attack&quot; in the United States).

&quot;Freeze Frame&quot; (1979) included several songs that gained airplay on alternative radio in many countries, notably &quot;I Pity Inanimate Objects&quot; and &quot;An Englishman in New York&quot;, which was accompanied by an innovative music video. Several notable guest performers contributed to the album: Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera played guitar on and co-produced the album tracks &quot;Random Brainwave&quot; and &quot;Clues&quot;, Paul McCartney contributed backing vocals to the song &quot;Get Well Soon&quot; and Roxy Music saxophonist Andy Mackay played saxophone on the single-only track &quot;Wide Boy&quot; and also appeared in the song&#x27;s innovative promotional video. Alongside the album tracks released as singles, the duo also released two singles (both of which failed to chart) that contained tracks not included on the LP – &quot;Wide Boy&quot; b/w &quot;I Pity Inanimate Objects&quot; (March 1980) and the instrumental single &quot;Submarine&quot; b/w &quot;Marciano&quot; (September 1980).

They made the UK Top Ten with the singles &quot;Under Your Thumb&quot; (a song about the ghost of a suicidal woman who returns to haunt a rail commuter) (No. 3) and &quot;Wedding Bells&quot; (No. 7) in 1981, both from &quot;Ismism&quot; (1981). The single &quot;Snack Attack&quot; was also a minor hit. Their 1972 pre-10cc single &quot;The Boys in Blue&quot; (written by Godley, Creme, Gouldman and included in the album &quot;Strawberry Bubblegum: A Collection of Pre-10CC Strawberry Studio Recordings 1969–1972&quot;) was played at most Manchester City football club matches in the 1990s and is still occasionally played there.

In 1983, they released &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; which took their music in a more electronic direction, using electronic drum machines for the entire album.

Their 1984 single &quot;Golden Boy&quot; was included on 1985&#x27;s &quot;The History Mix Volume 1&quot; album which celebrated 25 years of recording together. The album, co-produced by J. J. Jeczalik of Art of Noise, remixed samples of their previous recordings to a disco beat. This album also contained the single &quot;Cry&quot; which, helped in part by the video, became their biggest US hit, reaching No. 16. The song reached No. 19 in the UK. A video cassette was also released with visual imagery to complement the music.

Godley &amp; Creme released their final album, &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot;, in 1988. This album abandoned electronic instruments and used harmonicas, organs, and guitars to tell the story of the earth on the brink of nuclear war. The pair ended their working relationship soon after the release of the album. In a 1997 interview, Creme explained:

== Video direction career ==
Godley and Creme achieved their greatest success as the innovative directors of more than fifty music videos in the early 1980s. They created memorable videos for Status Quo (&quot;Something &#x27;bout You Baby I Like&quot;), The Police (&quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, &quot;Synchronicity II&quot;, &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot;), Culture Club (&quot;Victims&quot;), Duran Duran (&quot;Girls on Film&quot;, &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;), Herbie Hancock (&quot;Rockit&quot;), Go West (&quot;We Close Our Eyes&quot;), Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush (&quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;), Frankie Goes to Hollywood (&quot;Two Tribes&quot;, &quot;The Power of Love&quot;), Sting (&quot;If You Love Somebody Set Them Free&quot;, &quot;Fields of Gold&quot;), Toyah (&quot;Thunder in the Mountains&quot;), Visage (&quot;Fade to Grey&quot;), George Harrison (&quot;When We Was Fab&quot;), Lou Reed (&quot;No Money Down&quot;), Wang Chung (&quot;Everybody Have Fun Tonight&quot;), and Yes (&quot;Leave It&quot;), among many others, up to Godley&#x27;s video for The Beatles&#x27; 1996 single, &quot;Real Love&quot;, from the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot;.

The pair&#x27;s innovation extended to their videos for their own songs, notably &quot;Wide Boy&quot; and &quot;Cry&quot;. The latter&#x27;s 1985 video consisted of faces blending into one other using analog cross-fading, anticipating the digital effect of morphing, later used in a similar way in Michael Jackson&#x27;s 1991 video, &quot;Black or White&quot;. This was hailed as &quot;groundbreaking&quot;, though it was not without antecedents; a 10-second portion of the promotional video for King Crimson&#x27;s single &quot;Heartbeat&quot; had used a somewhat similar effect three years earlier.

== Aftermath ==
Creme joined the avant-garde synth-pop group Art of Noise in 1998.

Godley continued to direct music videos. In 2006, he once again teamed up with Gouldman, as they released new music under the name GG/06.

<text>What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo? is an American animated television series produced by Warner Bros. Animation for Kids&#x27; WB. It is the ninth incarnation of the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise that began with &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; and the first &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; series in a decade (since &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot; ended in 1991). It is also the first Scooby Doo series to be produced by Warner Bros. Animation, and the first since both the foreclosure of Hanna-Barbera and William Hanna&#x27;s death in 2001.

The show follows the format of &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, in which Scooby-Doo, and his companions Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy, travel to varying locations solving mysteries; this format is modernized for &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot;, in which the characters utilize technology that did not exist at the time &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; first aired. The series marked the return of Velma and Fred as main characters in the regular Scooby-Doo franchise since 1984&#x27;s &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries&quot;. 1988&#x27;s &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot; (which also featured Velma and Fred) was a prequel to the original 1969 series &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;.

It is the first television series in the franchise in which Frank Welker, Grey DeLisle, and Mindy Cohn respectively portrayed the voices of Scooby-Doo, Daphne, and Velma. Welker also returns as Fred in the series. Casey Kasem returned to voice Shaggy on the show after five years of not voicing him. This was the final &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; series where Kasem voices Shaggy before the actor&#x27;s death in 2014, though he still voiced other roles in the two following series, &quot;Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;. This is the first &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; series where Scooby is not voiced by his original voice actor Don Messick who died in 1997. 

The series premiered on September 14, 2002, and ran for three seasons before ending on July 21, 2006. The title song was performed by Canadian band Simple Plan. Reruns of the series have aired on both Cartoon Network from 2003–2016 and Boomerang from 2006–2020 and since 2023 in the United States. It also aired on Teletoon in Canada, and CBBC in the UK, then CITV.

In 2019, the show was made available to stream on Netflix in the US. In 2021, the rights were turned over to HBO Max.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
===Main===
* Scooby Doo: A dog who&#x27;s friends with Shaggy. Two things that they have in common are that they love food or are always afraid of ghosts. Voiced by Frank Welker (the voice of Fred).
* Shaggy Rogers: A beatnik slacker who&#x27;s friends with Scooby. He and Scooby are usually scared and hungry; a running gag in the show. He is also known to have a high metabolism, and also is rich. At his voice actor&#x27;s request, Shaggy was made into a vegetarian for this series. Voiced by Casey Kasem.
* Fred Jones: The leader of the Mystery, Inc. gang who is the master of making traps to catch the villains. However, sometimes the traps fail to work; Shaggy and Scooby mess them up then use the parts to catch the villain in their own fashion. Voiced by Frank Welker.
* Daphne Blake: The fashionable, rich glamour girl of the gang who defends herself with her great fighting skills, although she can still fill the role of damsel in distress, often being captured by the villains. She is also quite ditzy and accident prone. Voiced by Grey DeLisle.
* Velma Dinkley: The smartest of the gang, and wears glasses because she is myopic. She has to fight back the advances of semi-recurring Gibby Norton, who does devious things, thinking it will win her over. Voiced by Mindy Cohn.

===Recurring===
Characters in the series who appear more than once:
* Elliot Blender: A competitive spoiled child who often loses to Velma in contests. Voiced by Kimberly Brooks.
* Melbourne O&#x27;Reilly: An Australian adventurer/explorer who is one of Fred&#x27;s heroes (he is also based on Steve Irwin and Indiana Jones) Voiced by Steve Blum.
* J.J. Hakimoto: A famous, over enthusiastic, Asian director. Voiced by Brian Tochi.
* Gibby Norton: A nerd who has a crush on Velma, who hates the sight of him. He often turns out to be the villain to impress Velma, never succeeding. Gibby is modelled after his voice actor, Eddie Deezen.
* Burr Batson: A cocky southern professional racer who drives a monster truck. Voiced by James Arnold Taylor.
* Professor Laslow Ostwald: An inventor whom the gang meets. Voiced by Dave Foley, later by James Arnold Taylor. He first appears in &quot;High-Tech House of Horrors&quot; where his &quot;House of the Future&#x27;s&quot; AI &quot;&quot;Shari&quot; goes haywire, attacking the tourists. Though the gang suspects him, it is later revealed that &quot;Shari&quot; itself is responsible (as she was angry at the Professor due to him getting all of the attention). The gang defeated &quot;Shari&quot; by ignoring her (as attention was what she wanted) causing her to overload. Professor Ostwald also appears in &quot;E-Scream&quot;&quot; at a &quot;Video Game Convention&quot; where his new invention the cuddly &quot;Osomons&quot; turn evil. It is later discovered that the whole mystery was actually a VR simulation Velma was trying out.
* The Hex Girls: Thorn, Dusk and Luna, are the members of the famous eco-goth rock band, The Hex Girls, with whom Scooby and the gang are acquainted with, ever since their first meeting in &quot;Scooby-Doo! and the Witch&#x27;s Ghost&quot;. Thorn is voiced by Jennifer Hale, Dusk by Jane Wiedlin and Luna by Kimberly Brooks.
* Mr. B: The owner of the Secret Six puppies. His full name is never revealed. He is voiced by Jeff Bennett. He also appears to be based on actor John Turturro given his accent and appearance.
* Crissie: A Golden Retriever who is the Secret Six&#x27;s mother. She appears in &quot;Homeward Hound&quot; and &quot;Farmed and Dangerous.” Unlike the Secret Six she does not appear in “Gold Paw”.
* The Secret Six puppies: Maize, Flax, Jingle, Knox, 14-Karat and Bling-Bling. They are six very well-trained, prize-winning Golden Retriever puppies who have a knack for getting into trouble, and they like Scooby as a father figure. Maize and Knox are voiced by Jennifer Hale, Jingle is voiced by Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey, Flax is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, Bling-Bling is voiced by Grey DeLisle, and 14-Karat is voiced by Frank Welker.
* Nancy Chang: The reporter in episodes &quot;There&#x27;s No Creature Like Snow Creature&quot; and &quot;Riva Ras Regas&quot;. Voiced by Lauren Tom.

==Production==
In January 2002, it was announced Kids&#x27; WB had given a 13 episode order to a new &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; series under the working title of &quot;All New Scooby-Doo! The Animated Series&quot;. The series was jointly picked up by both Kids&#x27; WB and Cartoon Network as the two networks had begun jointly selling advertising slots with the series arranged to run on Kids&#x27; WB first and then Cartoon Network.

For this incarnation of the franchise, Frank Welker, the voice of Fred, took over as the voice of Scooby (replacing both Don Messick, the original voice of Scooby who died in 1997, and Scott Innes, the second voice of the character in the made-for-video films released between 1998 and 2001). Casey Kasem returned as Shaggy, making his comeback as the character in 2002 after the production team decided to make Shaggy a vegetarian. This would also be the final series Kasem voiced the character, continuing to voice Shaggy in the direct-to-video &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; films until retiring from the role in 2009; Grey DeLisle returned as the role of Daphne (having previously voiced the character in &quot;Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase&quot; and &quot;Night of the Living Doo&quot;). Actress Mindy Cohn took over for B. J. Ward as the role of Velma.

The series itself is a modernized version of the original &quot;Where Are You!&quot; series. It takes place in the 21st century and is more &quot;realistic&quot; than the previous, more cartoony incarnations, and features music from contemporary genres and all-new, original sound effects to replace the classic Hanna-Barbera sound effects. Even a distinctive thunderclap sound that was used frequently on older Scooby-Doo TV series was rarely used on the series. A laugh track was only used for the Halloween special. The classic formula was also frequently parodied throughout (in a manner similar to &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;), including the line &quot;And I would&#x27;ve gotten away with it too, if it weren&#x27;t for you meddling kids.&quot; As such, it returns to the formulaic version of humans in monster disguises, rather than the real monsters and ghosts of the prior four direct-to-video films (or the 1980s versions that preceded them).

The show was produced by Warner Bros. Animation, the successor to Warner Bros. Cartoons which was the studio famous for bringing the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; to life, which had by this time absorbed Hanna-Barbera Productions in 2001, after being bought by Time Warner from Turner Broadcasting System since their merger on October 10, 1996. As is the standard for other classic Hanna-Barbera properties (&quot;Yogi Bear&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, etc.), the studio is still credited as the copyright owner, and Joseph Barbera, co-founder and co-chairman of the Hanna-Barbera studios, served as an executive producer alongside Sander Schwartz. William Hanna, longtime partner of Barbera, had died the year before. Wang Film Productions, DongWoo Animation Co. Ltd, and Lotto Animation contributed some of the animation for this series.

It is the first Scooby-Doo series to be produced in 16:9 widescreen, although it was cropped in 4:3 when broadcast.

The band Simple Plan is strongly connected to &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot;. They perform the theme song (written by Rich Dickerson), and appeared as themselves in the episode &quot;Simple Plan and the Invisible Madman&quot;. Two of their songs appeared in chase scenes: &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot; in the episode &quot;It&#x27;s Mean, It&#x27;s Green, It&#x27;s the Mystery Machine&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mean Anything&quot; in &quot;Simple Plan and the Invisible Madman&quot;, which also had the song &quot;The Worst Day Ever&quot; serve as the song the band plays during a scene where they practice, and a scene where they are in concert. Also, they contributed to the theatrical movie &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;.

Each season included one holiday-themed special along with the other 13 regular episodes. The first season&#x27;s special was &quot;A Scooby-Doo Christmas&quot; (2002), followed by &quot;A Scooby-Doo Halloween&quot; (2003) and &quot;A Scooby-Doo Valentine&quot; (2005).

&quot;What&#x27;s New&quot; aired for three seasons on The WB Television Network&#x27;s &quot;Kids&#x27; WB&quot; programming block as a half-hour program, before being put on an indefinite hiatus in 2005, although the last episode, &quot;E-Scream&quot;, was aired on Cartoon Network. Reruns have been shown on both Cartoon Network and its sister channel Boomerang. It also debuted on Boomerang and Cartoon Network in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In the United Kingdom, it aired on CBBC from September 2003 until November 2015, and aired on CITV in 2016. Since July 9, 2021, &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot; has aired as reruns on Cartoon Network UK.

==Reception==
Common Sense Media gave the series a three out of five stars, writing, &quot;Parents need to know that while there aren&#x27;t many life lessons to be learned from an episode of this show, kids will enjoy the antics of the Scooby gang as they stumble upon and solve mysteries. Only very young children might find the show&#x27;s puzzles and monsters frightening.&quot;

==Home media==
Warner Home Video has released the entire series on DVD in Region 1. The series was initially released in ten volumes of four or five episodes between 2003 and 2006, as well as in the United Kingdom from 2004 to 2006 and later re-released, in the United States, in season sets in 2007–2008. In the UK, the volumes were released in a two disc set on May 30, 2011. A box set was released on October 29, 2007 in the UK containing all ten volumes in a complete disc set.

<text>Angels Unlimited is the title of a series of novels written for teenagers by the British author Annie Dalton. The protagonist is Melanie Beeby, who died on the day after her thirteenth birthday and soon found herself at the Angel Academy in heaven. As of July 2013, there are twelve novels, three omnibus books, and now twelve updated and revised ebooks. The overall title of the series has also been changed to Angel Academy.

Books from the series have been translated into Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Swedish.

The books are written in first person from Mel&#x27;s point of view and have a light, informal tone. In many of the books though, historical information is also present, due to the featuring of time travel to different periods of the past.

==Plot==
Melanie Beeby is killed in a traffic accident on the day after her thirteenth birthday. She then finds herself transported to Heaven. The Heaven of this universe is a lively and vibrant city, populated both by dead humans-turned-angels and Heaven-born beings known as pure angels. This city is also where the headquarters of the Agency are situated. The Agency is an elite group whose job is to counter the Opposition, informally known as the PODs or Powers of Darkness – the polar opposite of the Agency.

Upon arrival, Mel discovers that she is to be a trainee at the Angel Academy. She also discovers a best friend and soulmate, Lola Sanchez, good friend Reuben Bird and on her first mission bad boy Brice de Winters.

Each book features time travel of some kind, where Mel is tasked by the Agency to unravel various celestial problems involving humans and the Opposition.

==Title changes==
On 5 May 2005, the &quot;Angels Unlimited&quot; series was renamed the Agent Angel series, and new covers were released for each book.

From 21 June 2013 onwards, Amazon Kindle versions of the books were released under the series name &quot;Angel Academy&quot;, again with new covers being released for each edition.

<doc id="1227579" wikidata="Q3657820" url="?curid=1227579" title="Nigerian Dwarf goat">
<text>The Nigerian Dwarf is a modern American breed of dwarf goat. Like the American Pygmy Goat, it derives from the West African Dwarf group of breeds of West Africa.

== History ==

Between about 1930 and 1960 a variety of small goats of the West African Dwarf group of breeds were imported from Africa to the United States to be exhibited in zoos. The Nigerian Dwarf, like the American Pygmy Goat, derives from these, but does not resemble the stocky West African Dwarf in conformation – it has been bred to have the appearance of a miniature dairy goat. It was at first reared as a show breed and companion animal; selection was for appearance and for docility. It was later found to be suitable for small-scale dairy production, and some breeding was directed towards dairy qualities. A herd-book was established in 1980.

Numbers grew rapidly; by 2002 there were almost head registered. The breed was recognized by the American Dairy Goat Association in 2005. The Nigerian Dwarf was formerly listed on the heritage breeds watchlist of the Livestock Conservancy as &quot;recovering&quot;, but was removed from the list in 2013.

In 2023 the total number of the goats in the United States was just under ; populations numbering head are reported by Australia and Canada. In 2024 the international conservation status of the breed was &quot;not at risk&quot;.

In the 1990s the Nigora breed was created by cross-breeding the Nigerian Dwarf with Angora and other mohair breeds.

== Characteristics ==
The Nigerian Dwarf is small but well-proportioned; its conformation resembles that of larger dairy goats. It may be horned or naturally hornless. The coat is fine and fairly short, and may be of any color, or multicolored; common colors are gold, chocolate and black, frequently with white markings. The facial profile may be concave or straight; the ears are upright. The average weight is approximately , while maximum height is about for males and slightly less for females; stock bred for dairy performance may be rather larger than show or companion animals.

It is a precocious breed – young stock may be bred from an early age: males from about three months, females from seven or eight months. The gestation period is in the range 145–153 days; the twinning rate is high, and triplet and quadruplet births are not uncommon. Life expectancy is from eight to 12 years.

== Use ==

The Nigerian Dwarf was originally bred for show and as a companion animal. It was later also bred for dairy use. Average milk yield of dairy stock is per year; a yield of in a lactation of 305 days was recorded in 2018. Lactation usually lasts for about ten months. The milk is high in butterfat and protein, averaging 6.5% and 3.9% respectively, and is suitable for making cheese and butter.

<doc id="1227585" wikidata="Q597607" url="?curid=1227585" title="Super Bowl XLI">
<text>Super Bowl XLI was an American football game played between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Indianapolis Colts and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Chicago Bears to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2006 season. The Colts defeated the Bears by the score of 29–17. The game was played on February 4, 2007, at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. This was the first, and to date only, Super Bowl win for an AFC South team.

This was the first Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXX in which neither team was seeking its first title; however, it featured two teams ending long Super Bowl appearance droughts. The Colts, who finished with a 12–4 regular season record, were making their first Super Bowl appearance since winning Super Bowl V in the 1970 season during the team&#x27;s tenure in Baltimore; they had moved to Indianapolis in 1984. Meanwhile, the Bears, who posted an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record, were making their first appearance since winning Super Bowl XX in the 1985 season. The Bears&#x27; Lovie Smith and the Colts&#x27; Tony Dungy became the first African-American head coaches to coach in the Super Bowl, with Dungy the first to win. It was also only the second championship game or series in any of the four North American major professional sports leagues to feature two African-American head coaches or managers, the other being the 1975 NBA Finals.

In the first Super Bowl played in rainy conditions, the Colts overcame a 14–6 first-quarter deficit to outscore the Bears 23–3 in the last three quarters. Chicago posted the then-earliest lead in Super Bowl history when returner Devin Hester ran back the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown after 14 seconds had elapsed (a record later broken in Super Bowl XLVIII when the Seattle Seahawks scored a safety 12 seconds into the game). The Colts forced five turnovers, including cornerback Kelvin Hayden&#x27;s 56-yard interception return for a touchdown. Indianapolis kicker Adam Vinatieri also scored three field goals. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning was named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP), completing 25 of 38 passes for 247 yards and a touchdown, with one interception for a passer rating of 81.8.

CBS&#x27;s broadcast of the game was watched by an estimated average of 93.2 million viewers, making it at the time the fifth most watched program in U.S. television history. The halftime show, headlined by the musician Prince, peaked at 140 million viewers, and was widely acclaimed by music critics.

==Background==

===Host selection process===

Dolphin Stadium won the bid to host Super Bowl XLI on September 17, 2003, after a campaign against Phoenix, Tampa, New York City, and Washington, D.C. With this game, the Miami metropolitan area tied New Orleans, Louisiana as the city to host the most Super Bowls (9).

This was the fourth Super Bowl at Dolphin Stadium, which has also been known as &quot;Joe Robbie Stadium&quot; and &quot;Pro Player Stadium&quot;. The venue previously hosted Super Bowls XXIII (broadcast on NBC), XXIX (on ABC), and XXXIII (on Fox). Super Bowls II, III, V, X, and XIII were also in Miami, but held at the Miami Orange Bowl. This was the first Super Bowl played at the stadium since the city of Miami Gardens where the stadium is located was incorporated on May 13, 2003.

In February 2006, the NFL and the South Florida Super Bowl XLI Host Committee unveiled the slogan &quot;one game, one dream&quot; for the game, referring to the entire South Florida region working together to present the event. The Super Bowl XLI logo was also unveiled, featuring the colors orange (to represent the sun) and blue (for the ocean). The &quot;I&quot; in the Roman numeral &quot;XLI&quot; was drawn to resemble a pylon placed at each corner of an end zone because &quot;the goal is to get to the game.&quot; The logo had the same shade of orange as the logo of the host city&#x27;s home team, the Miami Dolphins. The &quot;XL&quot; part was similar to that of Super Bowl XL&#x27;s logo.

===Teams===
====Indianapolis Colts====
The Colts&#x27; first trip to the Super Bowl in 36 years set a record for longest time between appearances by a team (since broken by the Kansas City Chiefs). Their return was the culmination of a nine-year-long building process. In 1998, they drafted quarterback Peyton Manning to lead the team. Over the next four seasons, Manning, along with other stars such as receiver Marvin Harrison and running back Edgerrin James, turned the Colts into one of the best offensive teams in the NFL, but the team struggled to find consistency on defense and always ended up with either a losing season or elimination from the playoffs in the first round. After the 2001 season, Indianapolis fired head coach Jim Mora and replaced him with Tony Dungy. Dungy had developed one of the best defenses in the NFL while coaching the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it was hoped he could solve the Colts&#x27; defensive problems as well.

Over the next four seasons, the Colts won 48 of 64 games, but still could not find much success in the postseason. In 2002, they were blown out 41–0 in the Wild Card playoffs by the New York Jets. In 2003, they won their first two playoff games behind impressive offensive performances, and reached the AFC Championship Game. There, they lost to the New England Patriots 24–14, with Manning throwing four interceptions. In 2004, the Colts had one of the most spectacular offensive seasons in NFL history, scoring 522 points and gaining 6,582 yards, while Manning set NFL records for most touchdown passes and highest passer rating. But again the New England Patriots&#x27; defense (and snowy conditions) proved too formidable, as they lost 20–3 in the Divisional playoffs.

In 2005, the Colts&#x27; defense improved, making the team the clear favorites in the NFL. They won the first 13 games of the season and finished with a 14–2 record, while ranking second in the NFL in both points scored and fewest points allowed. But once again they lost in Divisional playoffs, this time to the #6 seeded Pittsburgh Steelers, 21–18. The Colts&#x27; playoff runs ended with a loss to the eventual Super Bowl champions in three consecutive years preceding this season. After another disappointing loss, Manning had developed a reputation of being unable to make it to a championship, a reputation that followed him from college after he was unable to win an NCAA title with the Tennessee Volunteers (who won a title the year after he graduated). The Colts lost some key players after the 2005 season, including James, who departed the Colts for the Arizona Cardinals, and kicker Mike Vanderjagt, the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader in field goal percentage, who left for the Dallas Cowboys. However, they did gain one key addition: 31-year old special teams returner Terrence Wilkins. Though he had been out of the NFL for three years, Wilkins finished the season with 52 kickoff returns for 1,272 yards (9th in the NFL).

Still, the Colts remained one of the AFC&#x27;s top teams in the 2006 season. Manning made the Pro Bowl for the 7th time in his career, completing 362 of 555 passes for 4,397 yards and an NFL-best 31 touchdowns, with an additional 4 rushing touchdowns and with only 9 interceptions and 15 sacks. His favorite target was Harrison, who caught 95 passes for 1,366 yards and 12 touchdowns. Receiver Reggie Wayne was also a major deep threat with 86 receptions for 1,310 yards and 9 touchdowns. Tight ends Ben Utecht and Dallas Clark were also reliable targets, each recording over 30 receptions for over 300 yards. On the ground, rookie running back Joseph Addai led the team with 1,081 yards and a 4.8 yards-per-carry average despite not starting any games in the regular season. He also caught 40 receptions for 325 yards and scored 8 touchdowns. Running back Dominic Rhodes was also a major contributor, rushing for 641 yards and catching 36 passes for 251 yards. The offensive line was led by Pro Bowlers Jeff Saturday and Tarik Glenn. On special teams, the Colts signed kicker Adam Vinatieri to replace Vanderjagt. While Vinatieri&#x27;s career field goal percentage was lower, the Colts considered him to be an improvement because of his reputation for making &quot;clutch&quot; kicks, a reputation aided by his game winning field goals in Super Bowl XXXVI and Super Bowl XXXVIII.

Indianapolis&#x27; defense ranked second in the NFL in fewest passing yards allowed. Dwight Freeney (5.5 sacks and 4 forced fumbles) and Robert Mathis (9.5 sacks, 4 forced fumbles, 2 fumble recoveries) were widely considered to be among the best pass-rushing defensive ends in the NFL. Behind them, linebacker Cato June led the team in tackles (142) and interceptions (3). Cornerback Nick Harper added 3 interceptions and 75 tackles. The Colts&#x27; run defense, however, was a major problem, giving up 2,768 yards on the ground, an average of 173 per game and last in the NFL. Another major issue for the Colts was their coverage teams, as they ranked 30th out of 32 teams in average kickoff return yardage allowed and 31st in average punt return yardage allowed. One key issue for the team was the loss of safeties Mike Doss and Bob Sanders, who had missed most of the seasons with injuries.

Indianapolis started out the season winning their first nine games, but ended up losing four of their next seven and finished with a 12–4 record, giving them the #3 playoff seed. Therefore, they had to play in a wild card playoff game. In the Wild Card playoffs, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 23–8, then defeated the Baltimore Ravens 15–6 in the Divisional playoffs, and advanced to Super Bowl XLI with a 38–34 win over the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game after rallying from a 21–3 deficit.

====Chicago Bears====

Chicago finished the season with an NFC best 13–3 record and advanced to the second Super Bowl in franchise history. They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 27–24 in overtime in the divisional round of the playoffs, and the New Orleans Saints 39–14 in the NFC Championship game to advance to Super Bowl XLI. The team excelled on defense, ranking third in fewest points allowed (255) and second in fewest points allowed per drive. They also ranked second in scoring (427 points), although only tenth in points per offensive drive thanks to a league leading 65 points scored on defensive or special teams plays.

The Bears offense was led by quarterback Rex Grossman, the team&#x27;s first round draft pick in 2003. Over the previous three seasons, Grossman had played in just 8 regular season games due to injuries, but he recovered to start in all 16 games in 2006. By the end of the season, he finished with 3,193 yards and 23 touchdowns, the most by a Bears quarterback since 1995. Grossman had difficulty avoiding turnovers, however, and threw 20 interceptions and lost five fumbles during the year. In the last seven games of the season, he turned the ball over 18 times. Many fans and sports writers expected head coach Lovie Smith to bench him at some point, but Smith insisted that Grossman would be the starter throughout the entire season.

Receivers Muhsin Muhammad (60 receptions, 863 yards, 5 touchdowns) and Bernard Berrian (51 receptions, 775 yards, 7 touchdowns) provided the main deep threat on the team, along with tight end Desmond Clark, who caught 45 passes for 626 yards and 6 touchdowns. Chicago&#x27;s running game was led by running backs Thomas Jones and Cedric Benson. Jones rushed for 1,210 yards and caught 36 passes, while Benson rushed for 647 yards and scored 6 touchdowns.

Chicago&#x27;s defense allowed the 5th least total yardage, allowed less than 100 yards per game on the ground, and allowed the fewest yards per drive of any NFL team. The line was anchored by Adewale Ogunleye, who had 6.5 sacks, and Pro Bowler Tommie Harris, who recorded 5, along with rookie Mark Anderson, who led the team with 12 sacks. Behind them, two of the three Bears starting linebackers, Lance Briggs, and Brian Urlacher, were selected to the 2007 Pro Bowl. In the secondary, cornerbacks Ricky Manning and Charles Tillman each recorded five interceptions. The defense was also able to make up for the offense&#x27;s poor performance earlier in the season, as explained in the win against the Cardinals in Week 6.

The loss of Harris to injury after the 12th game of the season coincided with a decline in defensive performance. Before his loss, the Bears allowed only two opponents to score more than 20 points (23 points to the Arizona Cardinals in week six and 31 to the Miami Dolphins in week 9). After his injury, Chicago opponents scored more than 20 points in six of the seven remaining games, including two of three playoff games. Only the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship game were held below 21 points.

The Bears&#x27; special teams sent three players to the Pro Bowl, including special teams ace Brendon Ayanbadejo, kicker Robbie Gould (who led all NFL kickers with 143 points), and rookie return man Devin Hester, who gained 600 punt return yards with a 12.8 yards per return average, the second highest in the NFL. He also set a league record with 6 touchdowns on special teams.

====Regular season statistical comparison====
The chart below provides a comparison of regular season statistics in key categories (overall rank amongst 32 teams in parentheses).

===Playoffs===
Although the Colts&#x27; rushing defense looked extremely weak during the season, it ended up being a key factor on their road to the Super Bowl. First, Indianapolis defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 23–8, holding Chiefs running back Larry Johnson (who rushed for 1,789 yards during the season) to just 32 yards on 13 carries. Then, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens 15–6, winning on a playoff record-tying five field goals by Vinatieri and holding running back Jamal Lewis (who rushed for 1,132 yards during the season) to just 53 yards.

Then the Colts faced their arch-rival New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. The Patriots jumped to an early 21–3 lead, but the Colts stormed back in the second half, outscoring the Patriots 32–13 with an additional field goal late in the first half. With 2:22 left in the game, the Colts had the ball on their own 20-yard line trailing 34–31. On the first four plays of the drive, Manning completed three passes, moving the ball 69 yards to the Patriots 11-yard line in just 24 seconds. Three plays later, Addai scored a 3-yard touchdown run to put them in the lead, 38–34 with only 60 seconds left in regulation. The Patriots responded with a drive to the Colts 45-yard line, but defensive back Marlin Jackson ended the drive with an interception to give Indianapolis the win. With their 18-point comeback win, the Colts set the record for biggest comeback in AFC-NFC Conference Championship history (since tied by the 2021 Cincinnati Bengals).

Meanwhile, the Bears started out their post-season with a 27–24 win over the Seattle Seahawks with Robbie Gould&#x27;s 49-yard field goal in overtime. One week later, they defeated the New Orleans Saints 39–14 in the NFC Championship Game. The Bears dominated most of the game, jumping to a 16–0 early lead. Two touchdown passes from Saints quarterback Drew Brees, cut the score to 16–14, but the Bears responded with 23 unanswered points to propel them to their first Super Bowl since the 1985 season. Thomas Jones finished the game with a franchise postseason record 123 rushing yards and two touchdowns.

It was the first time since the 1996 postseason that the home team won both of the conference championship games. The Colts were the first dome team to win the Super Bowl in an outdoor game (the St. Louis Rams were the first dome team to win a Super Bowl, XXXIV inside the Georgia Dome in Atlanta). The 2006 Indianapolis Colts were the first division champion to win a Super Bowl with four postseason wins and the second division champion (2003 Carolina Panthers) to win a conference title with three postseason wins.

For the Bears, this marked the first time that a Chicago sports team not owned by Jerry Reinsdorf had reached the championship game/series in their league since the Blackhawks lost in the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.

===Super Bowl pre-game practices and notes===

The Indianapolis Colts held pre-game practices for Super Bowl XLI at the Miami Dolphins Training Facility on the campus of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida. The Colts&#x27; &quot;Team and Family&quot; hotel was the Marriott Harbor Beach. At the 2007 Indianapolis 500 pre-race ceremonies on May 27, 2007, eventual Super Bowl XLI MVP Peyton Manning stated to ABC Sports commentator Brent Musburger the day before the game that two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Hélio Castroneves gave a pep talk to the Colts team.

The Chicago Bears held pre-game practices for Super Bowl XLI at the Miami Hurricanes football facility on the campus of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.

Chicago defensive tackle Tank Johnson was required to request a judge&#x27;s order to leave the state of Illinois due to an arrest for unlicensed ownership of six firearms and two assault rifles. On January 23, 2007, the judge granted him permission to travel out of state to play in the Super Bowl.

Chicago and Indianapolis are the two closest cities, geographically, to ever play in a Super Bowl; at 182 miles (293 km) apart (connected by a route that is mostly Interstate 65), they are slightly closer than New York and Baltimore, whose teams played each other at III (207 miles) and XXXV (188 miles). This prompted Colts coach Tony Dungy to joke to Jim Nantz, at the end of the AFC Championship game, that the two teams should split the difference and play the game in Fort Wayne.

This was the first Super Bowl since Super Bowl V that all players on both teams wore black shoes. As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Bears elected to wear their home navy uniforms with white pants, while the Colts wore their road white uniforms with white pants.

Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith had a history with each other. Smith had previously worked under Dungy as linebackers coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1996-2000.

==Broadcasting==
===United States===
====Television====
The game was televised in the United States by CBS in high-definition.

Jim Nantz called his first Super Bowl as a play-by-play announcer. He was joined in the booth by color commentator Phil Simms. Additionally, Solomon Wilcots (Bears sideline) and Steve Tasker (Colts sideline) reported on the sidelines and Lesley Visser (Bears sideline) and Sam Ryan (Colts sideline) in the stands.

Extensive pre-game coverage, hosted by &quot;The NFL Today&quot; team of James Brown, Shannon Sharpe, Boomer Esiason and Dan Marino, began at noon ET with NFL Films&#x27; &quot;Road to the Super Bowl&quot; year in review (narrated by Tom Selleck). This was followed by &quot;The Phil Simms All-Iron Team&quot;, and a four-and-a-half-hour &quot;Super Bowl Today&quot; pre-game show followed by game coverage at 6:25 PM. Other contributors to the pre-game show included Katie Couric, anchor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, Armen Keteyian, CBS News Chief Investigative Correspondent, Randy Cross, who reported from Iraq where U.S. military forces played a touch football game known as &quot;The Baghdad Bowl&quot; and Dick Enberg, who participated in his 12th Super Bowl telecast as a host, play-by-play announcer, or contributor.

The opening title sequence of CBS television coverage featured the composition Lux Aeterna, by artist Clint Mansell, in the background.
The American Forces Network (AFN) provided coverage of the Super Bowl for U.S. forces stationed overseas and to all U.S. Navy ships at sea.

====Ratings====
Nielsen Media Research reported 93 million viewers for Super Bowl XLI, making it at the time the fifth most watched program in U.S. television history (trailing only the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; finale and Super Bowls XLIII, XXX, and XLII).

====Advertising====
Advertising rates were reported as being slightly higher than in the year before, with CBS confirming a price of $2.6 million for some 30-second spots, compared with $2.5 million during Super Bowl XL. However, CNN reported that after discounts, the average price is likely closer to $1.8 to $2 million. Familiar advertisers in recent years such as Anheuser-Busch, CareerBuilder, General Motors and Coca-Cola bought multiple advertising spots, and other popular advertisers like Go Daddy and Emerald Nuts had commercials this year.

The only major hype related to commercials in the months leading up to Super Bowl XLI involved various campaigns to allow consumers to be involved in the creation of Super Bowl ads, inspired by consumer-generated content sites like YouTube. Frito-Lay announced a campaign in September 2006 to allow the public to submit ads for their Doritos brand and vote on the best one, which aired during the Super Bowl. Doritos actually aired two of the ads due to a close voting margin; the winning ad (featuring a chance meeting with a man and a woman that feature the qualities of Doritos) aired in the first quarter, while a second (with a checkout lady overly enamored with the product) aired in the second quarter. The five finalists each received $10,000 in this contest. General Motors announced a similar contest, open only to college students, for their Chevrolet brand; however, the ad would be produced professionally based on ideas suggested by the public. The winning ad featured men gathering around an HHR model with women in it and stripping off their clothes and giving it a car wash. The NFL itself advertised a similar contest to generate suggestions for a commercial promoting the league, with the winning concept featuring fans&#x27; disappointment that their teams&#x27; season was over.

The annual USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter survey chose a Budweiser ad featuring crabs worshiping an ice chest with that particular beer inside as the top ad of Super Bowl XLI, followed by another Budweiser commercial featuring a stray dog with mud spots climbing onto the brewery&#x27;s trademark Clydesdale-drawn wagon in a parade. In all, Anheuser-Busch took seven of the top ten spots in the annual survey, sweeping the top three spots. A YouTube user survey chose the Doritos &quot;Snack Hard&quot; ad (produced for the incredible price of $12, the cost of three bags of the snack product) as their top ad, that ad finished fourth in the USA Today survey. ADBOWL results were slightly different with only 6 of Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s ads finishing in the top ten. The highest ranked being the Bud Light &quot;Rock, Paper, Scissors&quot; spot. Also in the top ten were Blockbuster Video&#x27;s &quot;Mouse&quot;, Doritos&#x27; &quot;Car Wreck&quot;, GM&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; and Taco Bell&#x27;s &quot;Lion&#x27;s Talk &#x27;Carne&#x27;.&quot;

One ad that drew criticism from the gay community was for the Snickers candy bar featuring two men accidentally &quot;kissing&quot; each other after sharing the product in question, then proceeded to rip chest hairs as a manly act as homophobic. The ad proved to be controversial, and the ad was cancelled the next day by Masterfoods USA (Mars, Incorporated&#x27;s snack food division), and three other versions were deleted from the snickers.com web site. The ad was ninth in the USA Today ad survey, and according to a Masterfoods publicist, not intended to harm anyone.

A different ad for General Motors featured a laid off assembly line robot contemplating suicide, which drew criticism from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. The group asked for an apology from GM, and that the ad be taken off the air and the company&#x27;s website. The suicide scene was replaced with a scene of the robot watching a car being crushed at a junkyard when it was shown again during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25.

==Entertainment==

===Pre-game ceremonies===
Before the game, Cirque du Soleil, Romero Britto and Little Louie Vega performed as the pre-game act, and Billy Joel sang the National Anthem, accompanying himself on piano. He also performed at Super Bowl XXIII, which was played at the same venue. Joel became the second person to sing the National Anthem twice for a Super Bowl; Aaron Neville sang the national anthem before Super Bowl XXIV, in New Orleans, and Super Bowl XL (along with Aretha Franklin), in Detroit. This was also the last time until Luke Bryan sang at Super Bowl LI that a male artist had sung the national anthem at a Super Bowl.

Two days before the game, 4 tornadoes devastated Central Florida, causing over $200 million in damage, and causing numerous of injuries and 21 deaths. A moment of silence was held before kickoff, in honor of the victims of the severe weather.

Marlee Matlin and Jason Hay-Southwell performed the National Anthem in American Sign Language.

Besides participating in the CBS telecast of the pre-game show, Dan Marino also participated in the coin toss along with Norma Hunt, who was the widow of Lamar Hunt, the former owner of the Kansas City Chiefs and the man who gave the Super Bowl its name.

===Halftime show===

American singer and musician Prince performed in the halftime show. The setlist for Prince&#x27;s performance was a short rendition of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; by Queen; Prince&#x27;s hit songs &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot; and &quot;Baby I&#x27;m a Star&quot;; covers of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, and Foo Fighters&#x27; &quot;Best of You&quot;; and finally his signature song &quot;Purple Rain&quot; in the downpour. The 12-minute performance featured Prince accompanied by two dancers he called &quot;The Twinz&quot; (Maya and Nandy McClean) and the Florida A&amp;M University marching band, the Marching 100. Prince had rehearsed with the drum line for a week before the performance. The performance was on a large, central stage which was shaped like Prince&#x27;s logo, and was outlined with lights. He played before 74,512 fans at Dolphin Stadium, who had been given flashlights to point at the stage during the performance of &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. The event was carried &quot;to the biggest audience of his life&quot; with 140 million television viewers. Overall, the show was energetic and well received by the rain-soaked audience surrounding the stage. Music critics were extremely enthusiastic about his performance, one calling it &quot;arguably the best halftime show in Super Bowl history&quot;, and others saying it was one of the best ever.

Following the game, controversy emerged about a silhouetted camera shot of Prince, projected against a large sheet by a bright light on the other side of him. The controversy centered around his guitar, which detractors claimed seemed phallic, and critics stating that it &quot;looked embarrassingly rude, crude and unfortunately placed&quot;. Though the guitar has been considered by some an extension of a male player&#x27;s sexuality (especially highlighted by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and even Prince himself), supporters of Prince say that the show did not, in fact, become any more sexually charged than usual, noting that &quot;a guitar at waist level does look like an enormous phallus&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; listed the silhouetted camera shot, naming it &quot;Prince&#x27;s Demon Phallus&quot;, as one of the top seven Super Bowl halftime moments. In 2016, shortly after Prince&#x27;s death, the halftime show&#x27;s producer Don Mischer said that having a silhouetted camera shot of Prince was his idea, but denied it was meant to be a phallic statement.

===Post-game ceremonies===
Former Colts and Dolphins head coach Don Shula presented the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Colts after the game, and Peyton Manning was named MVP.

==Game summary==

===First quarter===
The Bears won the coin toss and elected to receive. For the first time in Super Bowl history, the game was played in the rain, which was continuous throughout the game.

The rain did not hinder Chicago return specialist Devin Hester, who ran back the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown to give the Bears the then earliest lead in Super Bowl history, after only 14 seconds. The Colts avoided kicking to Hester for the rest of the game, allowing him only one punt return, and choosing to squib kick whenever Hester was in the deep kickoff return position.

On the Colts&#x27; first drive of the game, Bears safety Chris Harris intercepted a deep third-down pass from quarterback Peyton Manning and returned it 6 yards to the Chicago 35-yard line. However, the Bears could not gain a first down on their ensuing possession and they were forced to punt. After several short runs and passes, Manning beat the Bears&#x27; defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne, cutting the Bears&#x27; lead to 7–6 after punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the extra point attempt. The touchdown occurred because of a mental error on the Bears&#x27; secondary defense. Cornerback Charles Tillman passed Wayne onto safety Danieal Manning. However, Manning chose to follow tight end Ben Utecht over the middle, leaving Wayne all alone. On the ensuing kickoff, Bears tight end Gabe Reid fumbled Adam Vinatieri&#x27;s bouncing kickoff while being tackled by defensive end Robert Mathis; linebacker Tyjuan Hagler recovered the loose ball for Indianapolis on the Chicago 34-yard line. However, on the next play, the Colts gave the ball right back when running back Joseph Addai fumbled the hand-off and defensive end Mark Anderson recovered it for the Bears.

On the first play after the turnover, running back Thomas Jones&#x27; 52-yard run set up 1st-and-goal at the Indianapolis 5-yard line. Three plays later, quarterback Rex Grossman threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad, increasing Chicago&#x27;s lead to 14–6. After forcing a Colts punt, the Bears turned the ball over again when safety Bob Sanders forced a fumble on running back Cedric Benson, with defensive end Dwight Freeney making the recovery on the Chicago 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field goal attempt.

===Second quarter===
After forcing a Chicago punt, Indianapolis drove 47 yards and scored with Vinatieri&#x27;s 29-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 14–9. The Bears were forced to punt again on their next drive, and wide receiver Terrence Wilkins returned the ball 12 yards to his own 42-yard line. Manning started out the drive with a 22-yard completion to wide receiver Marvin Harrison. His next pass went to tight end Dallas Clark for 17 yards. Two more completions moved the ball to the Bears&#x27; 11-yard line, and then running back Dominic Rhodes took the ball to the end zone with three consecutive carries, the last one a 1-yard touchdown run to give his team a 16–14 lead with 6:09 left in the half.

After yet another Bears punt, the Colts advanced to the Bears&#x27; 36-yard line before Tillman ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from tight end Bryan Fletcher. But on the next play, Grossman fumbled the snap, and defensive tackle Raheem Brock recovered the ball for Indianapolis. A reception and a run for 18 total yards by Rhodes led the Colts to the Chicago 17-yard line. With two seconds left, Vinatieri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left, and the Colts&#x27; lead remained 16–14 at halftime.

===Third quarter===
Wilkins returned the second half kickoff 26 yards to the Indianapolis 38-yard line. On the ensuing possession, Addai rushed five times for 25 yards and caught four passes for 19 yards as the Colts drove 56 yards in 13 plays and scored on a 24-yard field goal by Vinatieri, increasing their lead to 19–14. On Chicago&#x27;s next drive, Jones started out with a 14-yard run, and then Muhammad caught a 9-yard pass, bringing up 2nd-and-1 on the Indianapolis 45-yard line. But on the next play, Grossman was sacked for an 11-yard loss by defensive tackle Anthony McFarland. Then on third down, he fumbled the snap and recovered it himself, but the Bears were forced to punt, and Wilkins returned the ball 12 yards to the Colts&#x27; 36-yard line. Rhodes then gained 52 yards on three carries, with a face-mask penalty on Danieal Manning adding another 10 yards. Chicago managed to halt the drive at their own 2-yard line, but Vinatieri kicked a 20-yard field goal to increase the Colts&#x27; lead to 22–14.

Bears tight end John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri&#x27;s bouncing kickoff and returned it 9 yards to his own 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15 yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Indianapolis 40-yard line. Chicago could only gain 14 yards on three runs by Jones, but they were enough for kicker Robbie Gould to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 22–17.

===Fourth quarter===
After forcing Indianapolis to punt going into the fourth quarter, Chicago started on their own 20-yard line with 13:38 left in the game. But three plays later, cornerback Kelvin Hayden intercepted a pass intended for Muhammad and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown, increasing the Colts&#x27; lead to 29–17.

From that point on, the Colts held the Bears scoreless for the rest of the game. Four plays after the ensuing kickoff, Sanders intercepted Grossman&#x27;s pass and returned it 38 yards to the Chicago 41-yard line. The Bears&#x27; defense eventually forced a punt, but Smith&#x27;s 32-yard kick pinned the Bears back at their own 8-yard line. The Bears drove to their own 47, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, tight end Desmond Clark dropped a potential first down reception after being leveled by safety Matt Giordano. The Colts subsequently called eight consecutive runs by Rhodes before turning the ball over on downs themselves, leaving only 1:42 remaining in regulation. Afterwards, the Bears ran five meaningless plays to reach the Indianapolis 36-yard line before the game ended.

===Box score===





===Statistical overview===
This was the third Super Bowl to have two players rush for more than 100 yards as Dominic Rhodes had 113 for the Colts and Thomas Jones had 112 for the Bears. Tony Dungy is the third man to win the Super Bowl as a head coach as well as a player, following Tom Flores and Mike Ditka.

For the Colts, Rhodes rushed for 113 yards and a touchdown, while also catching an 8-yard reception. Addai rushed for 77 yards and caught 10 passes for 66 yards. Wilkins returned four kickoffs for 89 yards and 3 punts for 42 yards in what turned out to be his final NFL game. Adam Vinatieri became the first kicker ever to play in five Super Bowls and the first to win four Super Bowl rings. Vinatieri&#x27;s three field goals and two extra points gave him 49 points for the entire 2006 post-season, an NFL record. The Colts&#x27; win was the first major professional championship for Indiana since the Indiana Pacers&#x27; ABA title in the 1972–73 season.

Hester&#x27;s touchdown for the Bears on the opening kickoff was the first one in Super Bowl history, and the ninth kick return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl; only three of the nine teams who did this went on to win the game (the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI, the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowls XXXV and XLVII, and the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII). Hester&#x27;s return also kept a streak alive for there being a kickoff return for a touchdown in each Super Bowl played at Dolphin Stadium. Hester&#x27;s and Wayne&#x27;s touchdowns in the first quarter marked the first time in Super Bowl history the first two touchdowns were scored by players from the same college (University of Miami). Jones was the Bears&#x27; top rusher with 112 yards, while also catching four passes for 18 yards. Desmond Clark was the Bears&#x27; top receiver with six receptions for 64 yards. Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions, leaving him with a QB rating of 68.3 for the game. Muhsin Muhammad became the third player ever to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl for two teams, joining Ricky Proehl and Jerry Rice.

As mentioned previously, this was only the third time in Super Bowl history to have two 100 yard rushers. In Super Bowl III, Colts halfback Tom Matte and Jets fullback Matt Snell rushed for 116 and 121 yards, respectively. 22 years later in Super Bowl XXV, Bills halfback Thurman Thomas rushed for 135 yards while the Giants O.J. Anderson (the game&#x27;s MVP) rushed for 102 yards.

==Controversies prohibiting fan parties and presentations==

===Prohibiting tailgating===
The NFL upset many fans by banning the traditional practice of tailgating at Super Bowl XLI. Originally, spokesmen for Dolphin Stadium announced that tailgating would be permitted as usual. However, the NFL quickly contradicted this statement, announcing an NFL owner-imposed ban on all tailgating and prohibiting non-ticketed fans within a two-block-radius of the stadium.

===Prohibiting church display===
The NFL upset a large number of fans by threatening churches with lawsuits if they had Super Bowl parties. National Football League assistant counsel Rachel L. Margolies sent a letter to the Fall Creek Baptist Church in Indianapolis, ordering the church to cancel its party and remove the trademarked Super Bowl name from its website. She said that the church could not use the words &quot;Super Bowl&quot; as it violates trademark law, could not charge admission as that violates copyright law, could not use its projection screen (only one television could be used and it could not be over 55 inches), and could not &quot;promote a message&quot; in connection with the game. Regarding the last point, the Fall Creek Baptist church planned to also show an extra video to highlight the Christian testimonies of Colts coach Tony Dungy and Chicago Bears coach Lovie Smith. &quot;While this may be a noble message&quot;, Rachel L. Margolies wrote, &quot;we are consistent in refusing the use of our game broadcasts in connection with events that promote a message, no matter the content.&quot; Sports bars nationwide were allowed to show the game, as were businesses that televised sports as part of their everyday operations because they did not charge admission and they left the message the NFL intended intact.

&quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; picked up the story, and soon pastors across the U.S. were working to cancel their parties. Immediately the NFL received a backlash of bad publicity, with indignant football fans in constant sarcasm (akin to rules imposed about on-field behavior i.e. taunting opposition teams) referring to the NFL as the &quot;No Fun League.&quot; For example, the enforcement of this policy earned the NFL a &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot; silver on the edition of February 2, 2007, of &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;.

After a long series of bad press, the NFL issued a written statement clarifying their policy, saying that they did not object to churches hosting Super Bowl parties so long as they did not charge admission and showed the game on &quot;a television of the type commonly used at home&quot;. This statement did not attempt to forbid coordination of any other message with the game, something typically done by churches, nor did it attempt to forbid the use of the term &quot;Super Bowl.&quot;

<doc id="1227606" wikidata="Q2332651" url="?curid=1227606" title="Diploblasty">
<text>Diploblasty is a condition of the blastula in which there are two primary germ layers: the ectoderm and endoderm.

Diploblastic organisms are organisms which develop from such a blastula, and include Cnidaria and Ctenophora, formerly grouped together in the phylum Coelenterata, but later understanding of their differences resulted in their being placed in separate phyla.

The endoderm allows them to develop true tissue. This includes tissue associated with the gut and associated glands. The ectoderm, on the other hand, gives rise to the epidermis, the nervous tissue, and if present, nephridia.

Simpler animals, such as sea sponges, have one germ layer and lack true tissue organization.

All the more complex animals (from flat worms to humans) are triploblastic with three germ layers (a mesoderm as well as ectoderm and endoderm). The mesoderm allows them to develop true organs.

Groups of diploblastic animals alive today include jellyfish, corals, sea anemones and comb jellies.

See Mundo Vestibular. The city also has a campus of the Universidade Federal de Sao João Del Rei where approximately 300 students are attending Food and Agronomic Engineering in a partnership with the Embrapa Maize and Sorghum.

==History==
Evidence of pre-Columbian presence has been found in the Gruta Rei do Mato (Cave of the Forest King).

From around 1700, colonists entered Minas Gerais in search of gold, gems and diamonds. Nowadays, the Santa Luzia quarter is unofficially still called &quot;o garimpo&quot; (meaning &quot;the goldmine&quot;).

Between 1780 and 1867, the name &#x27;Sete Lagoas&#x27; was used for several regional types of administrations. The municipality of Sete Lagoas was founded in 1867.

Although &quot;Sete Lagoas&quot; means &quot;Seven Lakes&quot;, there are currently more than seven lakes in Sete Lagoas (10 within the urban perimeter, 17 in the municipality). Some were dug out while others became part of the town when the town expanded. There are, however, 7 &#x27;official&#x27; lakes according to a municipal law from 1989. These are: Lagoa da Boa Vista, Lagoa da Catarina, Lagoa da Chácara, Lagoa do Cercadinho, Lagoa José Felix, Lagoa do Matadouro and Lagoa Paulino.

==Food==
Food is an important element of the culture of Minas Gerais. In Sete Lagoas, two dishes can be found that are hardly found elsewhere: Galopé and Muchacho. Galopé is a dish of chicken (galo) and pork feet (pé de porco). Muchacho is also composed of chicken and pork but it also contains cheese.

==Sports==
Bela Vista Futebol Clube is one of 4 relevant football team in the city. Also is known for being the only football team from Sete Lagoas to tour over Europe in the 1959. Despite severe issues throughout the tour, the club reached some highlights scores in matches such as against Real Madrid in Santiago Bernabéu.

Democrata Futebol Clube is a football club based in Sete Lagoas. The club plays its home matches at the Arena do Jacaré (&quot;Alligator Arena&quot;, so named because of Democrata&#x27;s mascot; the official name is Joaquim Henrique Nogueira stadium).

Both teams used to play the traditional &quot;sete-lagoano&quot; derby being a very famous and known as the &quot;Clássico dos sertões&quot; ( Countryside&#x27;s Derby ). An interesting fact about both was its old home arenas: it was only one block distance from each, which was an extra spice for the rivality. The old Democrata&#x27;s Arena was demolished, but the original and glorious BV arena is still there.

In 2010 and 2011, Arena do Jacaré served as a home stadium for Atlético Mineiro, Cruzeiro and América-MG, as both Belo Horizonte stadia - Mineirão and Independência - were going through reforms.

Other smaller, but very competitive clubs are Ideal Sport Club, América Futebol Clube.

<text>Turing is a stream cipher developed by Gregory G. Rose and Philip Hawkes at Qualcomm for CDMA. 

Turing generates 160 bits of output in each round by applying a non-linear filter to the internal state of an LFSR. It is named after Alan Turing. It was developed based on the SOBER cipher introduced by Rose in 1998. This is evident in its major component, the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), which is the same technology found in the family of SOBER machines. Turing, however, is distinguished from its predecessors by the way it produces five words (five times more) of output for every internal update. It also provides up to 256-bit key strength and is designed to be fast in software, achieving around 5.5 cycles/byte on some x86 processors.

There are experts who found that the Turing stream cipher has a number of weaknesses when faced with chosen IV attacks. For instance, its key scheduling algorithm has the same secret key for different initialization vectors and this is found to lower the system&#x27;s security.

<doc id="1227618" wikidata="Q6098670" url="?curid=1227618" title="Iven C. Kincheloe Award">
<text>The Iven C. Kincheloe Award recognizes outstanding professional accomplishment in the conduct of flight testing. It was established in 1958 by the Society of Experimental Test Pilots in memory of test pilot and Korean War ace Iven C. Kincheloe, United States Air Force, who died during flight testing.

The Kincheloe Trophy consists of four columns and a symbolic aerospace vehicle that points toward the shield of the society. The columns represent the foundation on which the society was created—courage, integrity, knowledge, and accomplishment. The vehicle reinforces the role played by the society in the development of aerospace systems. Plaques bearing the name of each honoree are mounted around the sides of the onyx base.

== Criteria ==
The Society lists three criteria for nominations to this award:

#The recipient must be a living member of the Society.
#The accomplishment, or significant portion of the accomplishment, must have occurred in the past year (From July 1)
#The accomplishment must involve actual flight testing conducted by the individual, while in a test pilot role, and represent an outstanding contribution to an aerospace program.

<doc id="1227624" wikidata="Q80374" url="?curid=1227624" title="Rock sculpture of Decebalus">
<text>The rock sculpture of Decebalus () is a colossal carving of the face of Decebalus (r. AD 87–106), the last king of Dacia, who fought against the Roman emperors Domitian and Trajan to preserve the independence of his country, which corresponds to present-day Romania. 

The sculpture is located near the city of Orșova, in Mehedinți County. It was made between 1994 and 2004, on a rocky outcrop on the river Danube, at the Iron Gates, which form the border between Romania and Serbia. The Dacian king&#x27;s sculpture is the tallest rock relief in Europe, at in height and in width.

==Creation==
It was commissioned by Romanian businessman Iosif Constantin Drăgan and it took 10 years for twelve sculptors to complete it. The lead artist sculptor was Florin Cotarcea, from Orșova. According to Drăgan&#x27;s website, the businessman purchased the rock in 1992, after which the Italian sculptor Mario Galeotti assessed the location and made an initial model. The first six years involved dynamiting the rock into the basic shape, and the remaining four years were devoted to completing the detail. 

Under the face of Decebalus there is a Latin inscription which reads &quot;DECEBALUS REX—DRAGAN FECIT&quot; (&quot;King Decebalus—Made by Drăgan&quot;). The carving was placed opposite an ancient memorial plaque, carved in the rock on the Serbian side of the river facing Romania. The plaque, known as the Tabula Traiana, records the completion of Trajan&#x27;s military road along the Danube and thus commemorates the final defeat of Decebalus by Trajan in 105, and the absorption of the Dacian kingdom into the Roman Empire. Drăgan wanted the Serbs to carve a giant head of a Roman Emperor, as if confronting Decebalus on the opposite side of the river, but the Serbs refused.

==Significance==
Drăgan was a leading figure in the protochronism and Dacianism movements, nationalist ideologies which attempted to portray Romania as the major cradle of civilisation and which identified Romania with the Dacians and an ancient Thracian empire that supposedly dominated central Europe. In this ideology, Dacia, the pre-Roman name of Romania, was the inheritor of this Thracian culture, a view expounded by Drăgan in his book and journal &quot;Noì, tracii&quot; (&quot;We Thracians&quot;). 

The &quot;Fundația Europeană Drăgan&quot;, Drăgan&#x27;s foundation, states that &quot;Giuseppe Costantino Dragan is a strong supporter of the theory that the original &#x27;flame&#x27; of civilization started on the ancient territory of Romania and argues as much in his work&quot;. Drăgan saw the sculpture as a signpost to the cradle of civilisation. He is quoted saying, &quot;Anyone travelling towards &#x27;Decebal Rex Dragan Fecit&#x27; is also travelling towards the origins of European civilization and will discover that a United Europe represents the natural course of history&quot;.

==Descriptions==
Michael Palin in his 2007 book &quot;New Europe&quot; described the colossal head: 

Nick Thorpe in &quot;The Danube: A Journey Upriver from the Black Sea to the Black Forest&quot; writes,

<text>Sir Vaughan Frederick Randal Jones (31 December 19526 September 2020) was a New Zealand mathematician known for his work on von Neumann algebras and knot polynomials. He was awarded a Fields Medal in 1990.

==Early life==
Jones was born in Gisborne, New Zealand, on 31 December 1952. He was brought up in Cambridge, New Zealand, where he attended St Peter&#x27;s School. He subsequently transferred to Auckland Grammar School after winning the Gillies Scholarship, and graduated in 1969 from Auckland Grammar. He went on to complete his undergraduate studies at the University of Auckland, obtaining a BSc in 1972 and an MSc in 1973. For his graduate studies, he went to Switzerland, where he completed his PhD at the University of Geneva in 1979. His thesis, titled &quot;Actions of finite groups on the hyperfinite II1 factor&quot;, was written under the supervision of André Haefliger, and won him the Vacheron Constantin Prize.

==Career==
Jones moved to the United States in 1980. There, he taught at the University of California, Los Angeles (1980–1981), and the University of Pennsylvania (1981–1985), before being appointed as professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. His work on knot polynomials, with the discovery of what is now called the Jones polynomial, was from an unexpected direction with origins in the theory of von Neumann algebras, an area of analysis already much developed by Alain Connes. It led to the solution of a number of classical problems of knot theory, to increased interest in low-dimensional topology, and the development of quantum topology.

Jones taught at Vanderbilt University as Stevenson Distinguished Professor of mathematics from 2011 until his death. He remained Professor Emeritus at University of California, Berkeley, where he had been on the faculty from 1985 to 2011 and was a Distinguished Alumni Professor at the University of Auckland.

Jones was made an honorary vice-president for life of the International Guild of Knot Tyers in 1992. The Jones Medal, created by the Royal Society of New Zealand in 2010, is named after him.

==Personal life==
Jones met his wife, Martha Myers, during a ski camp for foreign students while they were studying in Switzerland. She was there as a Fulbright scholar, and subsequently became an associate professor of medicine, health and society. Together, they have three children.

Jones died on 6 September 2020 at age 67 from health complications resulting from a severe ear infection.

Jones was a certified barista.

<doc id="1227638" wikidata="Q316717" url="?curid=1227638" title="Steve Staunton">
<text>Stephen Staunton (born 19 January 1969) is an Irish football manager, scout and former professional footballer.

He played as a defender with two separate spells each with Premier League sides Aston Villa and Liverpool. He also played in the Football League for Bradford City, Crystal Palace, Coventry City and Walsall. He earned 102 caps for the Republic of Ireland national football team, captained his team to the knock-out stage of the 2002 FIFA World Cup and earned his place in the FIFA Century Club.

After retiring, he served as Republic of Ireland national team coach prior to Giovanni Trapattoni. He also spent five months as manager of Darlington in Football League Two and has worked on the coaching staff at Leeds United and Sunderland.

==Career==

===Pre-Liverpool===
Born in Dundalk, County Louth, Staunton was an accomplished all-round sportsman. He lived in Dundalk, County Louth, and attended the De La Salle College in the town. As well as playing soccer for his home club of Dundalk, he played Gaelic football, appearing for Louth&#x27;s U-16 team and winning a Louth Senior Championship medal with Clan na Gael. He also played for his local team St Dominic&#x27;s at underage level.

===Liverpool===
Staunton was spotted by Liverpool playing in Ireland for his home club of Dundalk as a 17-year-old and was signed on 2 September 1986 by manager Kenny Dalglish for a fee of £20,000.

He spent the first two seasons in the reserves and even went on loan to Bradford City for eight games during the 1987–88 season as cover for the injured Karl Goddard. He made his Liverpool debut on 17 September 1988 in the 1–1 league draw with Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield. As a result of his impressive performance he remained in the side for the rest of the season, despite him being vastly inexperienced compared to the players around him who were defending a League championship title won the year before. Following on from his impressive debut he scored his first goal three days later on 20 September; however, his 80th-minute strike wasn&#x27;t enough to prevent Arsenal winning the Centenary Trophy semi-final 2–1.

An injury to captain Alan Hansen meant that regular left back Gary Ablett had to be shifted across to the centre of defence. Staunton was therefore given his chance and proved an impressive and consistent performer in a team of strong players, playing his part as Liverpool challenged for the title again.

In the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, which ultimately claimed the lives of 97 fans at the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989, Staunton was among the players who comforted bereaved families and attended many of the funerals. He also put in an outstanding performance when the fateful FA Cup semi-final was rescheduled a month later, with Liverpool beating Nottingham Forest 3–1.

Staunton played in the FA Cup Final at Wembley – he was substituted at the start of the extra-time period – as Liverpool defeated Merseyside rivals Everton 3–2. However, the season ended with disappointment when Liverpool lost the League title in a decider against Arsenal at Anfield. The Gunners needed to win by two clear goals and were 1–0 up with just seconds remaining. With virtually the last kick of the season Michael Thomas broke through the centre of the Reds defence to score, thus stopping Liverpool gaining a second league and FA Cup double – something which no English club had yet achieved.

The following year, Staunton was a frequent presence again as Liverpool reclaimed the League title. His first goals for Liverpool came in remarkable fashion on 4 October 1989 when he came on as a substitute in a League Cup tie against Wigan Athletic and scored a hat-trick. The following season he scored twice more; against Crewe Alexandra in the League Cup and Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup. However 1990–91 was his final season with Liverpool before being astutely signed up by Aston Villa on 7 August 1991 for £1.1 million. New manager Graeme Souness was accused of misjudging the player&#x27;s abilities, though the ruling for European ties possibly had a bearing, with Staunton being classed as a foreigner, of which no team was allowed to field more than four; the Bosman ruling (which included the abolishment of quotas for EU citizens on teams in member countries) was not passed until 1995.

===Aston Villa===

Staunton made a good impression on the Villa fans by marking his debut on 17 August with a goal in the 3–2 win over Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. He soon became a regular in Villa&#x27;s defence, alongside the likes of the legendary Villan Paul McGrath, as they finished seventh during the 1991–92 season. The following year he played an important role in the club&#x27;s push for the title in the first Premier League season. Villa, in the end, lost out to Manchester United and had to settle for second place.

The following season, he won a League Cup winners medal when he helped a wounded Villa gain revenge on Manchester United by beating them 3–1 (denying them a domestic treble). The League Cup medal completed his domestic medal set. In the 1994–95 season, despite the club&#x27;s managerial problems, he had a fine season and regularly captained the side. The 1995–96 season was a mixed one for Staunton. He won another League Cup medal, this time as a non-playing substitute in the excellent 3–0 victory over Leeds United, but his playing time was limited due to a number of injuries.

Over the next two seasons he was once again a regular in defence, playing his part in Villa&#x27;s run to the UEFA Cup quarter finals in 1996–97. He also scored from a corner during his time at Villa. Meanwhile, in the league, he helped a transitional Villa team to a fifth-place finish in 1996–97 and seventh in 1997–98.

===Return to Anfield===
With his contract set to expire at Villa, he gained a surprise move back to Liverpool on 3 July 1998 when joint managers Roy Evans and Gérard Houllier signed him on a free transfer.
On 27 September 1999, during the Merseyside derby against Everton at Anfield, Staunton played the last 15 minutes of the game in goal after Sander Westerveld had been sent off for fighting with Francis Jeffers after Liverpool had used all three substitutes. He scored once in his second spell at Liverpool, his goal coming in a League Cup tie against Hull City in September 1999.

His second spell on Merseyside lasted two years before he was told he could leave on a free transfer. After a brief loan spell at Crystal Palace, where he made six league appearances and scored once against Tranmere Rovers, he was recalled to Anfield to appear in his 148th and last game for the Reds: it came on 23 November 2000 in the 2–2 draw with Greek side Olympiakos in the UEFA Cup.

===Return to Villa Park===
On 7 December 2000, he re-joined Aston Villa on another free transfer. He played in 14 of the club&#x27;s remaining league fixtures and then featured regularly for a further two seasons. He scored once in his second spell at Villa, his goal coming in the Intertoto Cup against FC Zurich.

===Coventry City===
Staunton continued to play club football, plying his trade with Coventry City, moving there on 15 August 2003 on another free transfer. He made his début on 16 August 2003 in the 0–0 league draw with Walsall at Highfield Road. He remained with the Sky Blues until the summer of 2005, clocking up 75 appearances.

===Walsall===
Staunton decided not to renew his contract once it had expired, and instead joined Walsall on 2 August 2005. He played just 10 times for Walsall and also held the post of assistant coach until 16 January 2006, when he was appointed manager of the Republic of Ireland senior international side. He was captain of the Walsall side that defeated Blackpool 2–0 on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2005, in what was his final game as a professional footballer at the end of a 20-year career.

==International career==
Staunton made his debut for the Republic of Ireland in the 4–0 friendly win over Tunisia. He went to Italy with Jack Charlton&#x27;s squad as the Republic of Ireland competed in their first ever FIFA World Cup finals. Staunton, the youngest member of the squad, played in every match at left back (though by now at club level he had also proved his usefulness as a central defender or midfield player) as the Republic of Ireland progressed to the quarter-finals, when they were beaten by the host nation.

He also represented the Republic of Ireland at FIFA World Cup 1994 in the United States. Again, he played in each game as the Republic of Ireland succumbed in the second round to the Netherlands.

The Republic of Ireland failed to qualify for both Euro 96 in England and the 1998 World Cup in France, though Staunton was still selected regularly for the team.

The Republic of Ireland qualified for the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and South Korea following a playoff against Iran. Staunton captained the Irish team in the second leg in Tehran. Coach Mick McCarthy, who had been Staunton&#x27;s captain at the country&#x27;s first World Cup 12 years earlier, selected him for the squad and named him captain following the departure of Roy Keane from the squad.

Again, Staunton played in every Republic of Ireland game of the tournament, with the 1–1 group match draw against Germany on 5 June proving to be a very special and historic occasion as he became the first Irishman to make 100 appearances for his country. Together with Gary Breen, he formed an impressive central defensive partnership in front of Shay Given. Staunton was the first footballer to have reached a century of caps for the Republic of Ireland national team, and as of the end of Ireland&#x27;s qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup he was still the joint record holder with former teammates Shay Given and Kevin Kilbane, though both players (along with Robbie Keane) have since emulated Staunton&#x27;s appearance record.

Ireland&#x27;s competition ended once more in the second round when they lost agonizingly to Spain in a penalty shoot-out after the game had finished 1–1. Staunton announced his retirement from international football immediately afterwards after setting a national record of 102 appearances. He is the only player to have played in every single one of Ireland&#x27;s 13 World Cup finals games.

On two occasions he scored directly from corner-kicks. The first of which came in a 2–0 victory over Portugal on 7 June 1992, during a US Cup game in Boston and the second came in a 3–0 defeat of Northern Ireland on 31 March 1993 during a World Cup qualifier in Dublin.

==Managerial career==

===National team===
Following the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s failure to reach the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the tenure of manager Brian Kerr came to an end. A three-man Football Association of Ireland (FAI) subcommittee spearheaded by its former treasurer John Delaney was formed with the remit of appointing a capable successor to Kerr. Delaney assured the Irish public that a &quot;world class&quot; management team would be appointed to oversee Ireland&#x27;s qualification campaign for the 2008 European Championship. After an initial flurry of rumours linking names of the calibre of Alex Ferguson, Terry Venables and Bobby Robson with the post, Staunton was released from his player/assistant manager role for Walsall on 12 January 2006 and was officially named as Kerr&#x27;s replacement the following day, with former England manager Sir Bobby Robson supporting him in the role of International Consultant and with former Aston Villa teammate Kevin MacDonald as coach. Staunton was something of a shock appointment given the names that had been circulated and his own limited coaching and managerial experience.

His international management career enjoyed a dream start, something Staunton called &quot;a bit of a fairytale&quot;, when he led Ireland to an impressive 3–0 victory over Sweden on 1 March 2006 with Damien Duff, Robbie Keane (captaining the Republic of Ireland for the first time) and Liam Miller getting onto the score sheet. The victory over Sweden was followed by two friendly defeats, the first a disappointing 1–0 loss against Chile on 23 May 2006 and then a 4–0 thrashing by Holland at Lansdowne Road, Ireland&#x27;s worst home reverse in 40 years.

Prior to the Holland game, Staunton was confronted and threatened by a man outside the team hotel on Monday 14 August with a gun that turned out to be an imitation Uzi machine gun. The 31-year-old assailant was arrested at a nearby beach and released by police the following day. No physical harm was caused but the event was a public relations disaster for both Staunton and the FAI (this was not the first time an assailant had attacked members of the squad at that particular hotel). Shortly after this incident further embarrassment was caused by the revelation that the FAI had sent news of Ireland midfielder Andy Reid&#x27;s recall to the national side to the player&#x27;s former club Tottenham despite the fact that he was by then a Charlton player.

It was against this backdrop that Staunton oversaw his first competitive match in charge as Republic of Ireland manager; a 1–0 defeat against Germany in Stuttgart, Ireland losing despite a battling performance. Staunton himself was sent off by the referee for kicking a water bottle onto the pitch in frustration during the second half. Worse was swiftly to follow. On 7 October 2006, in their second UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier, Ireland suffered a demoralising 5–2 defeat by lowly Cyprus in Nicosia. Staunton was watching from the stands, having been given a touchline ban for his sending-off in Germany. The defeat by Cyprus heaped additional pressure on the already beleaguered Staunton, who even at this early stage of his leadership was already facing calls for his resignation, ahead of Ireland&#x27;s next game which was at home to the Czech Republic on 11 October. The FAI, when pressed on the matter, refused to deny that a poor result would result in the manager&#x27;s immediate dismissal. An improved performance against the Czechs resulted in a 1–1 draw, a result that eased the pressure on Staunton to some extent.

Staunton was seen to be emotional after the 5–0 victory over San Marino; it was to be the last match to be played on the old Lansdowne Road pitch. In the return fixture, a poor performance ensured the team needed a goal from Stephen Ireland four minutes into injury time to secure the three points with a final score of 2–1. Coming so close to dropping points against a team ranked 195th in the world at the time of the match immediately sparked further calls for the manager&#x27;s resignation.

Ireland returned to form with two successive 1–0 home victories over Wales and Slovakia which brought them close to contention for second place in Group D of the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying groups. Such was the surprise that greeted the results that RTÉ presenter Bill O&#x27;Herlihy concluded the coverage of the Slovakia game with the comment, &quot;Ireland are now in contention for qualification for Euro 2008. Who would have thought it?&quot; The upswing in form continued on 22 August 2007 with a 4–0 win in a non-competitive match against Denmark in Aarhus. Staunton was delighted with the results and headed into the next set of fixtures with Ireland placed third in the qualifying group.

The victories, however, proved to be something of a false dawn as, over the space of five days in September, an injury-hit Ireland dropped five points from two games and saw their qualifying campaign effectively come to an end. Leading 2–1 away to Slovakia the team would emerge with just one point after an injury-time strike from Marek Cech cancelled their advantage. Staunton was disappointed by the performance but four days later, on 12 September, a 1–0 defeat to the Czech Republic in Prague crippled the qualifying campaign. A 0–0 draw with Germany on 13 October at Croke Park and a 1–1 draw at home to Cyprus in the same stadium four days later (during which a chorus of boos greeted the final whistle) secured qualification for both Germany and the Czech Republic. Ireland would not be competing in the 2008 European Championship.

Amid the fans&#x27; dissatisfaction, many pundits commented that Staunton was now effectively on borrowed time and the FAI announced that an emergency meeting was to be called to discuss Staunton&#x27;s position on 23 October. Prior to this, John Delaney gave an interview to RTÉ where he refused to publicly back the beleaguered manager and attempted to extricate himself from any responsibility for his role in Staunton&#x27;s initial appointment. Staunton, for his part, refused to resign and publicly stated that he intended to see out the remainder of his four-year contract.

On the evening of 23 October 2007, after initially indicating to reporters that the FAI meeting would take place in Dublin&#x27;s Crown Plaza Hotel, where two executive rooms had been hired for use by the FAI, it emerged that Staunton had met the FAI in secret in the Radisson Hotel at Dublin airport where he made his case to be retained in the job. The FAI subsequently met in private discussion for six hours after which it was confirmed that Staunton&#x27;s turbulent 21-month reign as international manager had come to an end. He was replaced by Don Givens who temporarily took charge of the national team until Giovanni Trapattoni&#x27;s appointment as manager.

===Leeds United===
On 4 February 2008, Staunton joined up with recently appointed Leeds United manager Gary McAllister for a training session, with a view to becoming McAllister&#x27;s assistant manager at the club. He was given the post later that day. In his first month at Leeds, the club did not win a game, until a 1–0 victory on 1 March against Swindon Town. When McAllister was sacked by Leeds United in December 2008 after five consecutive defeats, Staunton also left the club.

===Darlington===
Staunton was appointed as a scout at Wolverhampton Wanderers under manager Mick McCarthy. In May 2009, it was reported that he had applied for the then vacant manager&#x27;s seat at Port Vale. On 5 October 2009, he was announced as Darlington manager, to take over officially two days later following a Football League Trophy game against his previous club Leeds United. His contract was initially to take him to the end of the season, with Kevin Richardson appointed as his assistant manager. Staunton lost his first game in charge, 2–0 to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge. On 21 March 2010, with Darlington bottom of the league and facing relegation to the Football Conference, Staunton was sacked as the Darlington manager. He had won just four games from his 23 league matches in charge, although his sacking was also put down to a record low crowd for a league game at the Darlington Arena of 1,463 against Barnet in Staunton&#x27;s final match in charge.

===Sunderland===
Staunton was then handed a job as a scout at Sunderland on 22 August 2011. However, he was relieved of his role in 2013.

<doc id="1227641" wikidata="Q4806806" url="?curid=1227641" title="Soybean rust">
<text>Soybean rust is a disease that affects soybeans and other legumes. It is caused by two types of fungi, &quot;Phakopsora pachyrhizi&quot;, commonly known as Asian soybean rust, and &quot;Phakopsora meibomiae&quot;, commonly known as New World soybean rust. &quot;P. meibomiae&quot; is the weaker pathogen of the two and generally does not cause widespread problems. The disease has been reported across Asia, Australia, Africa, South America and the United States.

==Importance==
Soybean is one of the most important commercial crops around the world. Asian soybean rust is the major disease that affects soybeans. It causes lesions on the leaves of soybean plants and eventually kills the plants. The disease has caused serious yield loss of soybeans. In the areas where this disease is common, the yield losses can be up to 80%. The first reported cases in the United States occurred in 2004. This population originated in northern South America or the Caribbean. The spores were most likely spread by Hurricane Ivan. In 2002, USDA reported 10-60% yield losses in South America and Africa. in countries where this pathogen is established, estimated losses are between 10 and 80% depending on the inoculation and environmental conditions.

==Host and symptoms==
Soybean rust is caused by two types of fungi, &quot;Phakopsora pachyrhizi&quot; and &quot;Phakopsora meibomiae&quot;. It affects several important commercial plants, however, most notable for soybeans. Asian Soybean Rust can infect and reproduce on 90 known plant species, 20 of which are found in the United States, such as, soybeans, dry beans, kidney beans, peas. Asian soybean rust also infects yellow sweet lover, vetch, medic, lupine, green and kidney bean, and lima and butter bean. leguminous forage crops such as trefoil and sweet clover and weeds such as kudzu. 
At the early stage of Asian Soybean Rust, it causes yellow mosaic discoloration on the upper surfaces of older foliage. At this stage, it is usually hard to identify since the symptoms are relatively small and poorly defined.

Later as the disease continues to progress, the leaves will turn yellow and there will be lesions mostly on the undersides of the leaves and sometimes on petioles, stems or pods and premature defoliation can also be observed. In Phakopsora pachyrhizi will begin to form small brown and brick red sports on the lower canopy of the leaves that will begin to turn into lesions.
Asian Soybean Rust produces two types of lesions. Lesions at the later stage will turn from gray to tan or reddish brown. Mature tan lesions consist of small pustules surrounded by discolored necrotic areas. Tan spores can be found at the necrotic areas on the underside of the leaf. In the case of reddish brown lesions, there are larger reddish brown necrotic areas with few pustules and visible spores on the underside of the leaf. A good way to distinguish Asian Soybean Rust from other diseases is to look at the pustules it produces. ASR pustules usually do not have the yellow halo which is typical of bacterial pustules. Besides, ASR pustules are raised and can be commonly found on the underside of the leaf which makes it different from the lesions caused by spot diseases.

Soybean plants are one of ASR&#x27;s most known hosts and are susceptible at any stage in the life cycle. However, symptoms are most commonly found during or after flowering. ASR infection will reduce pod production and fill.

==Environment==
Asian Soybean Rust (ASR) was first detected in Asia. It has been found in many countries around the world since then. For example, Australia, China, Korea, India, Japan, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. This disease was first detected in the Caribbean in Puerto Rico in 1976 and first reported in the continental United States in 2004.

Asian Soybean Rust favors environments that are humid and warm. A continuous period of wetness on leaves will aid the growth of this disease since this situation is required for spores to germinate. Therefore, is most likely to appear under conditions of and a relative humidity of 75% to 80%. Therefore, ASR is a more serious problem in tropical and subtropical areas in Asia, Africa, Australia and South America. It is unable to survive the cold winters of northern habitats. However, this pathogen can be spread easily from wind and storm fronts and can inoculate quickly within a soybean field under favorable environmental conditions. And the Asian Soybean Rust may be favored by the climatic anomalies phenomena that cause extreme rainfall natural disasters that is called El Niño.

==Disease cycle==
Soybean rust is spread by windblown spores and has caused significant crop losses in many soybean-growing regions of the world. Windblown spores can travel for great distances and are released in cycles of seven days to two weeks. It is likely that ASR will survive on vast acreages of naturalized kudzu in the southern U.S. and thereby establish a permanent presence in the continental U.S. It is commonly believed that the disease was carried from Venezuela to the United States by Hurricane Ivan.

&quot;P. pachyrhizi&quot; is an obligate parasite, meaning that it must have live, green tissue to survive. For this reason ASR is something that will blow in every year, as cold winters will push it back. It can overwinter in southern states, so long as it has a living host.

ASR overwinters on live host legumes and sporulates the following spring. It cannot survive on dead tissue or crop residues.

Additional hosts can serve as overwintering reservoirs for the pathogen and allow for build-up of inoculum, in those environs free from freezing temperatures. The pathogen is well adapted for long-distance dispersal, because spores can be readily carried long distances by the wind to new, rust-free regions.

Overwintering sites of soybean rust are restricted to areas with very mild winters, such as the gulf coasts of Florida, the very southernmost areas of Texas, or in Mexico. Soybean rust will not survive over the winter in the North Central region because it can&#x27;t live and reproduce without green living tissue.

Spores of the soybean rust pathogen are transported readily by air currents and can be carried hundreds of miles in a few days. Weather conditions will determine when and where the spores travel from south to north.

Rust spores, called urediniospores, are able to penetrate the plant cells directly, rather than through natural openings or through wounds in the leaf tissue. Thus infection is relatively quick: about 9 to 10 days from initial infection to the next cycle of spore production.

Rust is a multi-cyclic disease. After the initial infection is established, the infection site can produce spores for 10 to 14 days. Abundant spore production occurs during wet leaf periods (in the form of rain or dew) of at least 8 hours and moderate temperatures of .

===The process===
The infection process starts when urediniospores germinate to produce a single germ tube that grows across the leaf surface, until an appressorium forms. Appressoria form over anticlinal walls or over the center of epidermal cells, but rarely over stomata. Penetration of epidermal cells is by direct penetration through the cuticle by an appressorial peg. When appressoria form over stomata, the hyphae penetrate one of the guard cells rather than entering the leaf through the stomatal opening. This rust and related species are unique in their ability to directly penetrate the epidermis; most rust pathogens enter the leaf through stomatal openings and penetrate cells once inside the leaf. The direct penetration of the epidermal cells and the non-specific induction of appressoria in the infection process of &quot;P. pachyrhizi&quot; may aid in understanding the broad host range of the pathogen and may have consequences in the development of resistant cultivars.

Uredinia can develop 5 to 8 days after infection by urediniospores. The first urediniospores can be produced as early as 9 days after infection, and spore production can continue for up to 3 weeks. Uredinia may develop for up to 4 weeks after a single inoculation, and secondary uredinia will arise on the margins of the initial infections for an additional 8 weeks. Thus, from an initial infection, there could be first generation pustules that maintain sporulation for up to 15 weeks. Even under dry conditions this extended sporulation capacity allows the pathogen to persist and remain a threat. If conditions for re-infection are sporadic throughout the season, significant inoculum potential still remains from the initial infection to reestablish an epidemic. Successful infection is dependent on the availability of moisture on plant surfaces. At least 6 hours of free moisture is needed for infection with maximum infections occurring with 10 to 12 hours of free moisture. Temperatures between are ideal for infection.

==Management and control==
Disease control options for ASR are limited. Rust descends in clouds of spores across the countryside. Cultural practices such as row spacing and crop rotations have little effect. Resistant cultivars do exist, carrying what are called &quot;Rpp&quot; genes. When weather and disease infection conditions are favorable, the occurrence of ASR can be widespread. Thus, remedial control measures—using fungicides as protective sprays—are the main effective disease control method. Soybean rust must be managed as early in the growing season as possible to be managed successfully.

Synthetic fungicides are the primary disease control option for protection against Asian soybean rust. The cost of spraying is estimated to be about $15 to $20 per acre; however, two or three sprays may be needed over the course of the growing season. These are significant additional production costs for soybean growers.

Fungicide screening trials to determine disease control efficacy have been field conducted in South America and South Africa. These reports are available on the Web through USDA&#x27;s Integrated Pest Management Information Centers. These research trials form the basis for fungicidal recommendations in the U.S.

Recent research from Washington State University indicates that the herbicide Glyphosate may be effective in dealing with the fungus.

Rust-resistant varieties of soybeans are currently in development by both public universities and private industry.

In some regions, the selection of winter cover crops and forage legumes may be effected, since they can serve as host plants. Resistance genes (&quot;Rpp&quot;s) have been identified and host resistance is expected to be an effective, long-term solution for soybean rust in the future. Until resistant commercial varieties are in place, the management of rust depends on judicious use of fungicides.

When untreated, soybean rust causes yield losses due to premature defoliation, fewer seeds per pod and decreased number of filled pods per plant.

<text>Lieutenant Henry May VC (29 July 1885 – 26 July 1941) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Henry was born 29 July 1885 in Bridgeton, Glasgow, to William and Maggie May.

He attended Dalmarnock Public School in Bridgeton and enlisted in the Army on 29 August 1902 at the age of seventeen. He served as a rifleman in the 1st Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), British Army during the First World War.

==Freemasonry==
He was Initiated into Freemasonry in The Lodge of Glasgow, No. 441, (Glasgow, Scotland) on 24 April, Passed on 12 June and Raised 10 July 1914.

==Victoria Cross==
On 22 October 1914 in France, May rescued Lieutenant Douglas Graham. May dragged him 300 yards whilst under fire. Earlier in the same day May had voluntarily attempted a rescue of a heavily wounded man, who died before May could reach him.

The citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 16 April 1915, dated 19 April 1915, and read:
War Office, 19th April, 1915.

His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the grant of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officer, Non-commissioned Officer and Men for their conspicuous acts of bravery and devotion to duty whilst serving with the Expeditionary Force: —

No. 7504 Private Henry May, 1st Battalion, The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles).

For most conspicuous bravery near La Boutillerie, on 22nd October, 1914, in voluntarily endeavouring to rescue, under very heavy fire, a wounded man, who was killed before he could save him, and subsequently, on the same day, in carrying a wounded Officer a distance of 300 yards into safety whilst exposed to very severe fire.
The Victoria Cross was presented to May by King George V on 12 August 1915.

==Later life==

Henry May was initially discharged from the Army on 28 August 1915 after receiving the VC, after 13 years as a regular. He later rejoined in 1918 and achieved the rank of Lieutenant in the Army Service Corps.

After the war, May returned to work in the textiles industry. He died on 26 July 1941 and is buried at Riddrie Park Cemetery, Glasgow, Section B, Lair 146. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Cameronians Regimental Museum within Hamilton Low Parks Museum in Hamilton, Scotland.

In October 2014, an engraved granite paving stone was laid during a ceremony outside the People&#x27;s Palace in Glasgow to remember May and his bravery. The ceremony was attended by his grandchildren. Glasgow&#x27;s Depute Lord Provost unveiled the memorial and said &quot;May [...] ranks among the very few men in the Great War who survived while carrying out the ultimate act of valour, risking his life to save the lives of comrades [...] He deserves our utmost respect and it will be a real honour to meet with his relatives&quot;.

<text>Muttaburrasaurus was a genus of herbivorous iguanodontian ornithopod dinosaur, which lived in what is now northeastern Australia sometime between 112 and 103 million years ago during the early Cretaceous period. It has been recovered in some analyses as a member of the iguanodontian clade Rhabdodontomorpha. After &quot;Kunbarrasaurus&quot;, it is Australia&#x27;s most completely known dinosaur from skeletal remains. It was named after Muttaburra, the site in Queensland, Australia, where it was found. 

The dinosaur was selected from twelve candidates to become the official fossil emblem of the State of Queensland.

==Discovery==

The species was initially described from a partial skeleton found by grazier Doug Langdon in 1963 at Rosebery Downs Station beside Thomson River near Muttaburra, in the Australian state of Queensland, which also provides the creature&#x27;s generic name. The remains were collected by paleontologist Dr Alan Bartholomai and entomologist Edward Dahms. After a lengthy preparation of the fossils, it was named in 1981 by Bartholomai and Ralph Molnar, who honoured its discoverer with its specific name &quot;langdoni&quot;.

The holotype, specimen QM F6140, was found in the Mackunda Formation dating to the Albian-Cenomanian. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull and lower jaws. The underside of the skull and the back of the mandibula, numerous vertebrae, parts of the pelvis, and parts of the front and hind limbs have been preserved.

Some teeth have been discovered further north, near Hughenden, and south at Lightning Ridge, in north-western New South Wales. At Lightning Ridge there have been found opalised teeth and a scapula that may be from a &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot;. A skull, known as the &quot;Dunluce Skull&quot;, specimen QM F14921, was discovered by John Stewart-Moore and 14-year-old Robert Walker on Dunluce Station, between Hughenden and Richmond in 1987. It originates from somewhat older layers of the Allaru Mudstone and was considered by Molnar to be a separate, yet unnamed species, a &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; sp. The same area produced two fragmentary skeletons in 1989. There have also been isolated teeth and bones found at Iona Station southeast of Hughenden.

Reconstructed skeleton casts of &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot;, sponsored by Kellogg Company, have been put on display at a number of museums, including the Queensland Museum, Flinders Discovery Centre and National Dinosaur Museum in Australia.

==Description==

&quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; was about and weighed around . The femur of the holotype has a length of .

Whether &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; is capable of quadrupedal movement has been debated; it was originally thought to be an &quot;iguanodontid&quot;, though recent studies indicate a rhabdodont position. Ornithopods this basal were incapable of quadrupedal movement. Originally reconstructing &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; with a thumb spike, Molnar later doubted such a structure was present. The foot was long and broad, with four toes.

The skull of &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; was rather flat, with a triangular cross-section when seen from above; the back of the head is broad but the snout pointed. The snout includes a strongly enlarged, hollow, upward-bulging nasal muzzle that might have been used to produce distinctive calls or for display purposes. However, as no fossilised nasal tissue has been found, this remains conjectural. This so-called &quot;bulla nasalis&quot; was shorter in the older &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; sp., as is shown by the Dunluce Skull. The top section of the &quot;bulla&quot; of the holotype has not been preserved, but at least the second skull has a rounded profile.

==Classification==

Molnar originally assigned &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; to the Iguanodontidae. Later authors suggested more basal euornithopod groups such as the Camptosauridae, Dryosauridae or Hypsilophodontidae. Studies by Andrew McDonald indicate a position in the Rhabdodontidae. A 2022 phylogenetic analysis recovered &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; and &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot; as basal rhabdodontomorphs and found them to likely represent sister taxa to Rhabdodontidae.

The following cladogram was recovered by Dieudonné and colleagues in 2016:

However, in 2024, Fonseca and colleagues considered &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; to be outside Rhabdodontomorpha, and instead classified it as a member of the Gondwanan clade Elasmaria, alongside &quot;Fostoria dhimbangunmal&quot;.

==Palaeobiology==

&quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; had very powerful jaws equipped with shearing teeth. Whereas in more derived ornithopod species the replacement teeth alternated with the previous tooth generation to form a tooth battery, in &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; they grew directly under them and only a single erupted generation was present, thus precluding a chewing motion. An additional basal trait was the lack of a primary ridge on the teeth sides, which show eleven lower ridges. In 1981 Molnar speculated that these qualities indicated an omnivorous diet, implying that &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; occasionally ate carrion. In 1995 he changed his opinion, suspecting that &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot;″s dental system is evolutionarily convergent with the ceratopsian system of shearing teeth. They would have been an adaptation for eating tough vegetation such as cycads.

<text>David Richard Swann (born June 19, 1949) is a Canadian medical doctor and politician. He was the leader of the Alberta Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition in the Alberta Legislature from December 2008 until resigning as party leader in September 2011. He returned as interim leader of the Alberta Liberal Party on February 1, 2015, following the resignation of Raj Sherman and led the party through the 2015 provincial election.

Swann is, to date, the last Liberal elected to the Alberta Legislature.

== Family and early life ==
Swann was born in Taber, Alberta, and was raised in a middle-class family on the edge of downtown Calgary. His father, Richard Swann, was head of oil and gas exploration for Canadian Fina for many years, before that company was sold to Petro Canada. His mother Margaret was an active volunteer while raising him and his four siblings.

His summers as a child were spent in the countryside and mountains of Alberta. As he grew up, he worked on farms, at gas plants and hospitals to finance his education.

Swann attended Western Canada High School before entering the University of Alberta in Edmonton in 1967. While at the U of A, he was a member of the Golden Bears Basketball team that went to the national basketball finals in 1969. He is still a sports fan and considers himself an outdoorsman; Swann is a regular runner, biker, hiker and canoeist.

After graduating in Family Medicine in 1975, Swann worked in mission hospitals in South Africa for three years, where he met his future wife, Laureen Ross, also a doctor. There he discovered the deep connection between medicine and politics firsthand. He was deeply affected by the human rights abuses of apartheid, particularly the killing of Steve Biko, who lived near the mission where he worked.

Swann and his wife returned to Canada in 1979, were married and settled in Pincher Creek for seven years. This is where their three children were born, and where he participated in a private medical practice with four other physicians.

In 1984, he began specialty training in Public Health (Prevention) and, after graduating in 1989, co-ordinated a primary health care project for the University of Calgary in the Philippines. After returning to Canada, he joined the Alberta Association of Medical Health Officers, becoming their president in 2000 while serving as Medical Officer of Health for Palliser Health and Headwaters Health regions.

In 2002, the Alberta Society of Health Officers passed a resolution calling for real government action on climate change and reductions to air pollution. Swann supported this resolution, the government fired him from his position with Palliser Health within days. This led to widespread condemnation of the Alberta Environment Minister, Lorne Taylor, who had influenced Health Chairman Len Mitzel to terminate him.

Under intense public pressure, the Palliser Board was forced to offer Swann his job back. He declined, instead making humanitarian trips to Iraq, then returning to Alberta to run in the 2004 provincial election.

== Political career ==
Swann entered electoral politics as a candidate for the Alberta Liberals. He was elected to the Alberta Legislature in the Alberta general election on 22 November 2004. Along with Harry B. Chase, and Dave Taylor, Swann was part of a re-emergence of provincial Liberals in Calgary which had been completely held by the Progressive Conservatives. During his first term Swann was environment critic and also served as deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Resources and Environment and as a member of the Private Bills Committee and the Standing Committee on Health. Swann was re-elected in the March 3, 2008 election.

Party leader Kevin Taft resigned following the election in which the party last almost half of its seats. Swann won the subsequent 2008 Alberta Liberal leadership election on 13 December 2008, defeating Dave Taylor and Mo Elsalhy. During his tenure as leader the party continued to suffer from resignations and internal divisions which contributed to it falling to third place in the polls behind the Wildrose Alliance. On 1 February 2011, he announced his resignation as leader with effect after the spring session of the Legislative Assembly. He resigned without having led the party through a general election; however, four years later, Swann was given the opportunity to lead the party through an election campaign when party leader Raj Sherman suddenly resigned weeks before the 2015 provincial election was called and Swann was appointed interim leader. In the course of the campaign, Swann&#x27;s Liberals faced an unexpected surge by the Alberta New Democratic Party under its new leader, Rachel Notley, which threatened to cut into Liberal support, as well as a resurgent Wildrose Party which also resulted in pressure on Liberal supporters to strategically vote for the more moderate Progressive Conservatives in order to block the more right wing Wildrose Party from forming government.

The 2015 election resulted in the defeat of the Progressive Conservatives after 44 years in power and the election of the first NDP government in Alberta history. The Liberals under Swann received 4% of the popular vote, less than half their result in the 2012 election. Only Swann retained his seat becoming the sole Liberal MLA elected, down from 5 Liberal seats.

== Advocacy ==
Swann has advocated for many causes related to peace and development, human rights and social justice and has worked with organizations such as Physicians for Global Survival, Amnesty International, and Doctors Without Borders.
Swann has been a vocal supporter of farm workers&#x27; rights and regularly campaigns for occupational health and safety laws for Alberta&#x27;s agricultural sector. Swann is the current interim spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion Calgary.

Serkin was born on July 24, 1947, in Manhattan. He was the son of Irene Busch Serkin and pianist Rudolf Serkin, grandson of the influential violinist Adolf Busch, and great-nephew of conductor Fritz Busch. Peter was given the middle name Adolf in honor of his grandfather. He spent much of his childhood on his parents&#x27; farm in Guilford, Vermont.

In 1958, at age 11, Serkin began studying at the Curtis Institute of Music, where his teachers included the Polish pianist Mieczysław Horszowski, the American virtuoso Lee Luvisi, as well as his own father. He graduated in 1964 at age 16. He also studied with Ernst Oster, flutist Marcel Moyse, and Karl Ulrich Schnabel.

==Career==

Serkin&#x27;s concert career began in 1958, when he first performed at the Marlboro Music Festival, a seminal agent and incubator of chamber music performance in the U.S., established in 1951 by his father Rudolf Serkin, Hermann and Adolf Busch, and Marcel, Blanche and Louis Moyse. Following that performance, Peter Serkin was invited to play with major orchestras such as the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell and the Philadelphia Orchestra with Eugene Ormandy. In 1966, at age 19, Serkin was awarded the Grammy Award for Most Promising New Classical Recording Artist. Three of his recordings garnered Grammy nominations (one of them features six Mozart concertos; the two others feature the music of Olivier Messiaen) and his recordings won other awards. Serkin was the first pianist to receive the Premio Internazionale Musicale Chigiana award in 1983 and he received an honorary doctorate from the New England Conservatory of Music in 2001.

In 1968, shortly after marrying and becoming a father, Serkin decided to stop playing music altogether. In the winter of 1971, he, his wife, and baby daughter Karina moved to a small rural town in Mexico. About eight months later, on a Sunday morning, Serkin heard the music of Johann Sebastian Bach being broadcast over the radio from a neighbor&#x27;s house. As he listened, he said, &quot;It became clear to me that I should play.&quot; He returned to the U.S. and began his musical career anew.

Henceforth, Serkin performed around the world with leading orchestras and conductors including Claudio Abbado, Daniel Barenboim, Herbert Blomstedt, Pierre Boulez, Seiji Ozawa, Simon Rattle, James Levine, and Christoph Eschenbach. He made numerous recordings, primarily for RCA Victor. He recorded Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; five times, the first made when he was 17, the fourth when he was 47, the fifth when he was 70. He recorded music by Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, and Dvořák as well as more recent composers such as Reger, Berg, Webern, Schoenberg, Hans Werner Henze, Takemitsu, Oliver Knussen, Peter Lieberson and Stefan Wolpe. A recording of Messiaen&#x27;s Vingt Regards sur L&#x27;Enfant-Jésus at age 25 became iconic, with noted &quot;deep understanding of the composer&#x27;s sound-world and its emotional extremes, coupled with considerable instrumental prowess&quot;. In 2009, he recorded chamber music by Charles Wuorinen with the Brentano String Quartet.

Serkin was a committed performer of new and recent music. He played works as world premieres or that were dedicated to him, by composers such as Elliott Carter, Alexander Goehr, Knussen, Lieberson and Takemitsu. The American composer Ned Rorem writes of Serkin, &quot;His uniqueness lies, as I hear it, in a friendly rather than over-awed approach to the classics, which nonetheless plays with the care and brio that is in the family blood, and he&#x27;s not afraid to be ugly. He approaches contemporary music with the same depth as he does the classics, and he is unique among the superstars in that he approaches it at all.&quot;

Among prominent virtuosi, Peter Serkin was one of the first to experiment with period fortepianos, and the first to record late Beethoven sonatas on pianos of both the modern as well as Beethoven&#x27;s era.

Serkin collaborated with Yo-Yo Ma, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, András Schiff, Alexander Schneider, Pamela Frank, Harold Wright, the Guarneri Quartet, the Budapest Quartet, and other prominent musicians and ensembles, such as principal wind players of major American orchestras. In addition, he was one of the founding members of TASHI. He taught at the Juilliard School, the Curtis Institute of Music and the Yale School of Music and was on faculty at the Bard College Conservatory of Music. Among those who studied piano with him is Simone Dinnerstein.

==Personal life and death==
Serkin was married to Wendy Spinner until their divorce in 1979; they had one daughter. He was then married to Regina Touhey, and had four children with her; they divorced in 2018. Serkin died from pancreatic cancer at his home in Red Hook, New York, on February 1, 2020.

<doc id="1227671" wikidata="Q3107204" url="?curid=1227671" title="PLBY Group">
<text>PLBY Group, Inc. is an American global media and lifestyle company founded by Hugh Hefner as Playboy Enterprises, Inc. to oversee the &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine and related assets. Its headquarters are in Los Angeles, California.

The company is focused on four primary business lines: Sexual Wellness, Style &amp; Apparel, Gaming and Lifestyle, and Beauty &amp; Grooming. Today, PLBY Group, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the development and distribution of content, products and high-profile events that embody both &quot;eroticism and fine art&quot;, and apparel retailing. It is in the top twenty most licensed brands globally.

==History==
Sales of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine peaked in 1972 at over 7 million copies. By 2015, the circulation had fallen to 800,000. The company completed its shift to consumer products in 2020 with the shuttering of the magazine division, and is now known to generate more than $3 billion in consumer spending annually across 180 countries.

Playboy Enterprises, Inc. made its initial public offering on November 3, 1971, at $23.50.

Playboy ran forty Playboy Club properties from 1960 to 1986 and operated casinos in England from the mid-1960s to 1981, when they lost their operating license. Playboy also operated a casino in Nassau, Bahamas, from 1978 to 1982. From 1981 to 1984, the company was a partner in the Playboy Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Playboy Enterprises was denied a permanent New Jersey gaming license and was forced to sell out to its partner, which changed the name of the hotel/casino to the Atlantis Hotel and Casino. The company returned to the nightlife business with the Playboy Club at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, which opened in 2006 and closed in 2012. Other Playboy Clubs opened in Cancun, Macau, and London in 2010 and 2011. Meanwhile, the company said it would open at least three Playboy stores in each of the next three years.

In 1959, the company formed Alta Loma Entertainment (formerly Playboy Productions from 1959 to 1988, and Alta Loma Productions from 1988 to 1999), to produce movies and television shows. The first project was &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Penthouse&quot;, a television show on WBKB-TV, which was followed by &quot;Playboy After Dark&quot;, a television series that ran for two seasons, and the format was revived as &quot;After Hours&quot; in 1989.

In 1982, Playboy Enterprises founded Playboy Home Video (later Playboy Home Entertainment). At first, the Playboy Premiere titles were distributed by MGM/UA Home Video, with others going to CBS/Fox Video, but the label changed hands to other distributors since 1985.

&quot;The Age&quot; reported in October 2008 that, for the first-time ever, Hugh Hefner was selling tickets to his celebrity-filled parties to offset his cash-flow problems due to setbacks Playboy Enterprises had suffered, including decreasing &quot;Playboy&quot; circulation, decreasing stock value, and ventures that have yet to turn a profit. Christie Hefner released a memo to employees about her efforts to streamline the company&#x27;s operations, including eliminating its DVD division and laying off staff.

In March 2011, founder Hugh Hefner succeeded in a bid to take Playboy Enterprises private after 40 years as a publicly traded company. He partnered with private equity firm Rizvi Traverse.

Playboy Enterprises closed its former headquarters in the top office floors of 680 N. Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, Illinois, in April 2012. In January 2013, the company said it employed 165.

In 2018, less than a year after Hugh Hefner&#x27;s death, his estate sold its remaining Playboy shares of 33%, worth $35 million, to Icon Acquisition Holdings LP. The money was split between Hefner&#x27;s widow and his four children.

In March 2020, CEO Ben Kohn announced that the Spring issue of the magazine would be the last to be printed, and the publication would be online-only going forward.

In October 2020, Playboy Enterprises announced a reverse merger with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). On February 11, 2021, PLBY Group, Inc. completed its merger and began trading on the Nasdaq stock market under the PLBY ticker. PLBY Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Playboy Enterprises, is headed by Ben Kohn, chief executive officer, president and director.

=== Segments ===
The company has three reportable segments: Licensing, which includes licensing of Playboy brands to third parties; Direct-to-Consumer, including sales of third-party products through its owned-and-operated e-commerce platforms; and Digital Subscriptions and Content, including the sale of subscriptions to Playboy programming and trademark licensing for online gaming products.

As of the 2020 re-organization the business had four main market categories:
* Sexual Wellness, comprising own-branded lingerie and sexual amenities including CBD products. This segment contributed over 40% to revenue in 2020.
* Style &amp; Apparel, comprising licensed fashion sales globally, especially in China, where it is the leading men&#x27;s fashion brand with over 3500 stores. This segment contributed around 52% of revenue in 2020.
* Gaming and Lifestyle, comprising its chain of licensed Playboy Clubs and digital gaming ventures in partnership with Scientific Games and Microgaming. This segment contributed 3% to 2020 revenue.
* Beauty &amp; Grooming, comprising skincare, beauty and grooming products. This segment contributed around 2% to revenue in 2020.

The company&#x27;s Playboy Foundation provides grants to non-profit groups involved in fighting censorship and researching human sexuality.

The company licenses the Playboy name, the Rabbit Head design and other images, trademarks, and artwork to &quot;appear on a wide range of consumer products including apparel, accessories, footwear, lingerie, jewelry, fragrances and home fashions.&quot; Its licensed products generate &quot;more than $3 billion in global sales in more than 180 countries.&quot; The company&#x27;s trademarks and copyrights are critical to the success and potential growth of its business as &quot;Playboy is one of the most recognized, celebrated and popular consumer brands in the world.&quot; In 2019, Playboy ranked number 21 among the Top 150 Global Licensors by &quot;License Global&quot; magazine. As of 2013, the licensing accounts for about 65% of revenue.

PB Lifestyle Ltd. is promoted by Mumbai-based entrepreneurs. Following their interests in media and entertainment, PB Lifestyle Ltd. has signed the master and exclusive franchise/licensee agreement with Playboy Enterprises USA (for ten years) for the use of the Playboy brand in India for various businesses. PB Lifestyle representatives have also stated that the company will adapt the Playboy brand to suit India&#x27;s decency standards and will not allow content/material that is deemed &quot;lascivious or appealing to prurient interests&quot;.

Playboy first entered the Chinese market in a 1988 licensing deal with Hong Kong–based Chaifa Group. By the early 1990s, Licenses were divided into subcategories of products and sold to mainland manufacturers. The company claimed roughly 650 stores by 2003. This had grown to 3100 by 2015. The company has attempted to open a club in Shanghai, once in 2004, and again in 2017. In May 2015, Playboy signed a 10-year licensing agreement with Handong United to manufacture and distribute fashion apparel.

== Subsidiaries ==
In December 2019, Playboy Enterprises acquired the online retailer Yandy for an undisclosed sum. In February 2021, PLBY announced the acquisition of the sexual wellness retailer Lovers for $25m in cash. In June 2021, PLBY Group acquired Australian-based lingerie chain Honey Birdette for US$333 million in cash and stock. In October 2021 PLBY Group acquired Dream, a social content platform that provides creators with tools to interact directly with their fans. This acquisition was used to support the launch of Playboys creator community Centerfold.com that went live on December 20, 2021.

=== Shamrock Rovers ===
Beglin played schoolboy football in his native city with Bolton and Waterford Bohs before joining Shamrock Rovers in 1980. He went on to spend three years at Milltown, making four appearances in Europe and scoring one goal.

In 1982 Beglin was part of the League of Ireland XI that toured New Zealand where they played the New Zealand men&#x27;s national football team.

=== Liverpool ===
Beglin was the last signing made by Liverpool manager Bob Paisley when he joined from Shamrock Rovers for in May 1983. He was gradually brought into the first team over the next 18 months by Joe Fagan, before being given regular games in the left back slot by new player-manager Kenny Dalglish as a replacement for Alan Kennedy in the 1985–86 season. He made his debut in the left sided midfield position on 10 November 1984 in the 1–1 league draw with Southampton at Anfield. He scored his first goal for the club 5 months later on 10 April 1985 in the 4–0 European Cup Semi-final first leg victory over Greek side Panathinaikos at Anfield. Beglin&#x27;s 85th-minute strike put the tie out of reach for the Greek club. Liverpool won the second leg 1–0 to set up a showdown in the final with Italian giants Juventus at the Heysel Stadium in Belgium however a retaining wall collapsed during a riot at the &quot;neutral&quot; end, and 39 Juventus supporters died, in what came to be known as the Heysel Stadium Disaster. Liverpool also lost the final.

Liverpool won the League championship and FA Cup, pipping Merseyside rivals Everton to both, with Beglin picking up medals for each. He also began playing for the Republic of Ireland, picking up the first of 15 caps.

Seven months after lifting the league and cup double, his leg was badly broken following a mistimed tackle from Everton&#x27;s Gary Stevens in the League Cup fifth round game in January 1987. Former manager Bob Paisley said that it was one of the worst leg breaks he had ever seen, joking that he would break his own leg to prove a point to the FA. Furthermore, Liverpool defender Alan Hansen stated that the tackle was &quot;a mile high and an hour late&quot;. Recovering from the break, Beglin sustained a knee cartilage injury playing for Liverpool&#x27;s reserves in October 1988 which effectively finished his time at Anfield.

=== Leeds United ===
In June 1989, he joined Leeds United, where he helped the club to become Second Division champions and spent periods on loan with both Plymouth Argyle and Blackburn Rovers before a recurrence of his knee injury forced him into an early retirement in 1991, when still only 27.

== International career ==
After caps with the Under-21 side, Beglin playing for the senior Republic of Ireland in 1984, earning 15 caps.

== Media career ==
Beglin is a co-commentator for BT Sport, Premier League Productions, and CBS Sports, and was a co-commentator on ITV and a sports journalist on Granada Television. He commentated for RTÉ in the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups. In the past for RTÉ he has worked on coverage of Premier League, UEFA Champions League matches and Republic of Ireland internationals. Beglin has also been employed by Liverpool as a voice–over artist for the club&#x27;s official DVD and video releases. He has also been the co-commentator in the &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; video game series since &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 2011&quot;, alongside Jon Champion and later Peter Drury. On 4 May 2021, during a live broadcast of a UEFA Champions League semi-final, Beglin attributed Paris Saint-Germain&#x27;s Argentine midfielder Ángel Di María&#x27;s red card to his &quot;Latino temperament&quot;, for which he later apologized.

<doc id="1227675" wikidata="Q1174507" url="?curid=1227675" title="David Gale">
<text>David Gale (December 13, 1921 – March 7, 2008) was an American mathematician and economist. He was a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, affiliated with the departments of mathematics, economics, and industrial engineering and operations research. He has contributed to the fields of mathematical economics, game theory, and convex analysis.

Gale earned his B.A. from Swarthmore College, obtained an M.A. from the University of Michigan in 1947, and earned his Ph.D. in Mathematics at Princeton University in 1949. He taught at Brown University from 1950 to 1965 and then joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley.

Gale lived in Berkeley, California, and Paris, France with his partner Sandra Gilbert, feminist literary scholar and poet. He has three daughters and two grandsons.

==Contribution==
Gale&#x27;s contributions to mathematical economics include an early proof of the existence of competitive equilibrium, his solution of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Ramsey problem, in the theory of optimal economic growth.

Gale and F. M. Stewart initiated the study of infinite games with perfect information. This work led to fundamental contributions to mathematical logic.

Gale is the inventor of the game of Bridg-It (also known as &quot;Game of Gale&quot;) and Chomp.

Gale played a fundamental role in the development of the theory of linear programming and linear inequalities. His classic 1960 book &quot;The Theory of Linear Economic Models&quot; continues to be a standard reference for this area.

The Gale transform is an involution on sets of points in projective space. The concept is important in optimization, coding theory, and algebraic geometry.

Gale&#x27;s 1962 paper with Lloyd Shapley on the stable marriage problem provides the first formal statement and proof of a problem that has far-reaching implications in many matching markets. The resulting Gale–Shapley algorithm is currently being applied in New York and Boston public school systems in assigning students to schools. In 2012 The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Shapley for this work.

Gale wrote a Mathematical Entertainments column for &quot;The Mathematical Intelligencer&quot; from 1991 through 1997. The book &quot;Tracking the Automatic Ant&quot; collects these columns.

In 2004 Gale developed MathSite, a pedagogic website that uses interactive exhibits to illustrate important mathematical ideas. MathSite won the 2007 Pirelli Internetional Award for Science Communication in Mathematics.
