<text>Gary Bruce Williams (born March 4, 1945) is an American university administrator and former college basketball coach. He served as the head coach at the University of Maryland, the Ohio State University, Boston College, and American University. In 2002, he led Maryland to win the NCAA tournament championship. Williams retired after the 2010–11 season.

On March 25, 2014, Williams was elected to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. In April of the same year, he was also voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, making him the first coach in history to be inducted into both institutions in the same year.

==Playing career==
Williams played for Maryland as the starting point guard under coach Bud Millikan. He was a member of the 1966 Charlotte Invitational Tournament championship team and the 1965 Sugar Bowl Tournament championship team. He set a Maryland record for field goal percentage, going 8-for-8 from the field in an ACC game against South Carolina in 1966 (35 years later a Williams pupil, Lonny Baxter, would break that record, hitting all ten of his field goal attempts). Williams was the Maryland team captain in 1967. He graduated in 1968 with a B.S. in marketing. While at the University of Maryland, Williams was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

==Coaching career==

===Early coaching career===
Prior to entering the college ranks, Williams was a successful high school basketball coach at Woodrow Wilson High School in Camden, New Jersey. He won a NJSIAA state championship as head varsity coach at Wilson High. With his chance to learn under Tom Davis (whom Williams got to know when Davis was an assistant coach at Maryland), Williams left to become an assistant basketball coach at Lafayette College in 1971 and continued at Boston College in 1977 until he became a head coach. He was also the head soccer coach at Lafayette College during his assistant coaching job.

Williams held three head coaching positions prior to Maryland. In 1978, Williams obtained his first head coaching position at American University. He led American to relative success, coaching them to several NIT berths. In 1982, Williams returned to Boston College, leading the Eagles to two NCAA tournament appearances, and one NIT appearance in his four-year tenure. In 1986, Williams took over at Ohio State of the Big Ten Conference. Under Williams, the Buckeyes advanced to one NCAA tournament appearance and two NIT appearances in three seasons.

===Maryland===
The Maryland Terrapins, an original member of the Atlantic Coast Conference, announced Williams as its next head coach on June 13, 1989. The basketball program and the Maryland athletic program as a whole were still reeling from the aftershock of the 1986 death of Maryland basketball star Len Bias and struggles under coach Bob Wade, a former high school coach from Baltimore.

Williams coached the 1989–90 team to a respectable 18–13 record and an NIT berth. However, in March 1990, the NCAA imposed harsh sanctions on the school for several major violations, mostly dating to the Wade era. Maryland was banned from postseason play in 1991 and 1992, and was kicked off live television for 1990–91. Additionally, Maryland docked itself several scholarships over two years. With his recruiting efforts severely hamstrung, Williams found it very difficult to rebuild the program. However, with the help of Walt Williams, Maryland stayed competitive through a low point of the program&#x27;s history.

After a surprise appearance in the 1994 Sweet 16, the Terrapins were a fixture in the national rankings until 2005. Maryland&#x27;s teams during this era featured future NBA players such as Joe Smith, Steve Francis, Juan Dixon, Steve Blake, Lonny Baxter, Keith Booth, Terence Morris and Chris Wilcox, and a cast of supportive role players, exemplified by Byron Mouton.

In 2001, Williams led Maryland to the first Final Four in school history, losing to Duke in the semifinals. On April 1, 2002, Williams led the Terrapins to their first NCAA National Championship, defeating Indiana 64–52. Williams was the first coach to win a national championship without a single McDonald&#x27;s All American on the roster since its inception. He became the first coach to direct his alma mater to a national title since Norm Sloan accomplished the feat with North Carolina State in 1974. The 2002 team also won a school-record 32 games, as well as the school&#x27;s first outright ACC title in 22 years—only the third time since 1981 that a team from North Carolina hadn&#x27;t won at least a share of the title. In March 2004, Maryland won the ACC Tournament Title, defeating Duke 95–87, led by Tournament MVP John Gilchrist.

In the 2004–2005 season, Maryland failed to make the NCAA tournament for the first time since the 1993–1994 season, which was then the longest streak in the ACC. This began a relatively mediocre stretch for Maryland, where they failed to make the tournament three out of the next five years.

In 2010, the Terrapins shared the regular-season conference title with Duke. The same season, Williams also earned his second ACC Coach of the Year award. 2011 saw the Terrapins struggle to a 19–14 mark, failing to make the post-season for the first time since 1993.

On May 5, 2011, Williams announced his decision to retire from coaching basketball. He has remained with the Maryland athletic department as Assistant Athletic Director and Special Assistant to the Athletic Director.

On January 26, 2012; Maryland honored Williams by renaming the playing surface at the XFINITY Center &quot;Gary Willams Court.&quot;

===Coaching profile===
In March 2010, Williams was the 5th winningest active coach in the country and the 3rd winningest coach all-time in the ACC (behind only Dean Smith and Mike Krzyzewski). In his 31 years as a head coach, Williams has amassed an overall record of 654–368 (.640) and 447–240 (.651) at Maryland. He passed Lefty Driesell as the school&#x27;s winningest coach in 2006.

Williams has an overall NCAA tournament record of 29–16 (.644), 25–13 (.658) at his alma mater. His 29 wins in the NCAA tournament places him seventh among active coaches in that category. Williams has coached Maryland to fourteen NCAA tournament appearances, including a streak of eleven consecutive appearances (1993–94 season to 2003–04 season), as well as four post season NIT appearances, allowing Maryland to own the longest current consecutive streak of postseason appearances in the ACC (Wake Forest, who had previously had the longest active streak, failed to qualify for the postseason in 2007). Additionally, Williams has 71 wins over top 25 ranked opponents, 33 wins over top 10 ranked opponents (at least one every season from 96–97 to 09–10), 20 wins over top 5 opponents, three ACC regular season titles (co-champions in 1995 and 2010, and outright champions in 2002), and an ACC tournament title (2004). Williams&#x27; NCAA Tournament accomplishments include seven Sweet Sixteens, two Elite Eights, two Final Fours, and a national championship in 2002. Williams also leads active coaches with seven wins over top-ranked teams, the most recent coming against North Carolina on January 19, 2008. Since 1995, Coach Williams and Maryland have averaged 22.5 wins per season. Williams has led the Terrapins to at least 20 wins in 10 of the last 13 seasons and is tied with Rick Pitino for 6th among active coaches with 17 career 20-win seasons.

Williams had a discordant relationship with his former athletic director, Debbie Yow, who is now the athletic director at North Carolina State University. In April 2011, Yow, after hiring Mark Gottfried to be the new head coach of the Wolfpack basketball team, accused the Maryland coach of attempting to &quot;sabotage&quot; N.C. State&#x27;s search process by advising candidates that she was difficult to work with. Williams immediately denied the accusation.

===Milestones since 2005–06 season===
A home victory over Virginia on January 19, 2005, moved Williams into a tie with former Virginia head coach Terry Holland as the fifth winningest coach in ACC history. On January 21, 2006, a home victory over Virginia Tech earned Williams his 142nd ACC win, moving him into a tie with former Carolina head coach Frank McGuire for third place in that category. Four nights later, a victory over Georgia Tech gave him third place outright.

On February 7, 2006, a 76–65 home victory over Virginia gave Williams his 349th win, allowing him to pass Lefty Driesell as the university&#x27;s all-time winningest head coach. On February 3, 2007, a road victory over Wake Forest earned Williams his 150th ACC victory. He is the third coach in conference history to accomplish this feat; only Dean Smith and Mike Krzyzewski have won more conference games.

On February 6, 2008, a 70–65 road victory over Boston College gave Williams his 600th win. Gary Williams is one of only 8 active NCAA basketball head coaches with at least 600 wins.

On November 21, 2008, an 89–74 overtime home victory over Vermont gave Williams his 400th victory at his alma mater. In ACC history, Williams stands alongside Smith and Krzyzewski as the only coaches to amass this number of wins.

On February 21, 2009, Williams upset #3 (AP/ESPN Coaches Polls) University of North Carolina, 88–85 in overtime. Then on March 12, Williams&#x27; Terps earned another victory over a top 10 opponent, defeating #8 Wake Forest, the second-seeded team, 75–64 in the quarterfinals of the 2009 ACC tournament, following a 74–69 victory over N.C. State in the opening round. The victory over the Demon Deacons was Williams&#x27; 17th ACC Tournament victory, tying Lefty Driesell for the most in school history.

Williams coached in his 1,000th game on January 22, 2010, an 88–64 victory over NC State. On March 9, 2010, he was named the ACC coach of the year. On March 19, 2010, Williams coached Maryland (#4 rank in the Midwest Region) to a first-round victory, by a score of 89–77, over Houston (#13 rank in the Midwest Region) in the opening round of the 2010 NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship. Two days later, Williams engineered a comeback in the final seconds of the second-round game against Michigan State, only to lose to a buzzer beater shot by Korie Lucious. The final score was 85–83. A win would have put Williams in the Sweet Sixteen for the 9th time in his coaching career.

On March 25, 2014, Williams was elected to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. In April of the same year, he was also voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, making him the first coach in history to be inducted into both institutions in the same year.

==Personal life==
Williams grew up in Collingswood, New Jersey, a suburb of Philadelphia, where he attended Collingswood High School. He was married to Diane McMillen from 1968 to 1990. Williams has a daughter and three grandchildren. He remarried in April 2011. Williams suffers from hyperhidrosis, and has devoted his time to raising awareness of the ailment and advocating for greater research efforts to find treatments.

==Trademarks==

===Coaching style===
Williams exclusively ran the flex offense, with a strong emphasis on first getting the ball inside to the post, and once the opposing defense collapses, distributing the ball to the perimeter. On defense, he favors a highly physical, pressing and trapping style, using turnovers to key the offense through the fast break. His defensive philosophy is inspired by both his former coach Bud Millikan, who utilized an aggressive man-to-man scheme, and Tom Davis who helped teach Williams the more aggressive trapping schemes in addition to the fast break offense.

===Recruiting style===

Williams gained a reputation as a recruiter who almost exclusively went after less-heralded players and develops them into Division I talents. An opposing coach, Dave Odom, once said in a newspaper interview that Williams &quot;has made a living off of the player who is maybe one or two tools short of the complete package (say, height or leaping ability), but who competes hard and plays with a chip on his shoulder.&quot; Much of his success in the years since the university recovered from NCAA sanctions was from players that fit that mold.

In 2009, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published an extensive exposé on Williams&#x27; tenure from the 2002 title year to mid-season 2008–09. The three-part feature analyzed Williams&#x27; recruiting process, and noted how local prep basketball talent went elsewhere for college. It cited that Williams refused to associate closely with local AAU basketball program directors and coaches, due to their questionable reputations. The &quot;Post&quot; asserted this reticence stemmed from the Rudy Gay recruiting episode. The &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; staff writers covering Maryland have challenged Williams&#x27; recruiting procedures, but also noted his personality reflects whom he recruits.

<doc id="1241272" wikidata="Q7614765" url="?curid=1241272" title="Steven Greenberg (musician)">
<text>Steven Greenberg (born October 24, 1950) is an American musician, record producer and the owner of the independent label October Records. He is best known for his band Lipps Inc.&#x27;s 1980 hit song &quot;Funkytown&quot; (which was also a hit for Australian band Pseudo Echo).

==Career==
Greenberg was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. In his twenties, Greenberg was a multi-instrumentalist who played in several bands. He had been trying for some time to secure a production deal, and he drew the interest of the Casablanca label with a disco track called &quot;Rock It,&quot; which became a hit locally.
Released nationally in late 1979, &quot;Rock It&quot; made it into the Top 20 on the Billboard Disco Charts. Casablanca asked Greenberg for a full album, so he gathered several session players, among them guitarists David Rivkin and Tom Riopelle; keyboardist Ivan Rafowitz; synth and vocoder programmer Roger Dumas (not to be confused with French actor Roger Dumas); and bassist Terry Grant. Most importantly, he recruited lead vocalist Cynthia Johnson, the 1976 Miss Black Minnesota, who had been performing with an early version of The Time.

The group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Mouth To Mouth&quot;, was released in November 1979. &quot;Funkytown&quot; was the first single, and it was an instant hit, climbing to No. 1 on May 31, 1980, and spending four weeks there. In the wake of that success, &quot;Rock It&quot; was re-released but it only made the Billboard Top 50. The six-song release &quot;Pucker Up&quot; followed, featuring a disco remake of the British pub rock group Ace&#x27;s hit ballad &quot;How Long.&quot; It earned gold and platinum records in many countries. Lipps Inc.&#x27;s full-length &quot;Designer Music&quot; was a huge success in Mexico and in Central and South America, and it made Top 10 on the Billboard Disco chart. &quot;Designer Music&quot; also earned gold and platinum elsewhere, including Mexico and Hong Kong, but no subsequent song matched the success of &quot;Funkytown&quot; in the United States.

Cynthia Johnson was already decreasing her involvement with the group, with Melanie Rosales and Margie Cox picking up some of the slack and later becoming lead vocalists. Johnson left for good in 1983, after three albums. Lipps Inc. released one more album before breaking up in 1985. Greenberg became a web designer in 1992 and stayed in that field through 2007.

==Personal life==
In 2005, his son Nile was featured on the MTV show &quot;Made&quot;, in which he wanted to become a rapper using the stage name Blizzard. Later, Nile became an architect.

Greenberg mentored his nephew John Fields, a producer/songwriter.

<doc id="1241274" wikidata="Q5167" url="?curid=1241274" title="Ramesses VI">
<text>Ramesses VI Nebmaatre-Meryamun (sometimes written Ramses or Rameses, also known under his princely name of Amenherkhepshef C) was the fifth ruler of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt. He reigned for about eight years in the mid-to-late 12th century BC and was a son of Ramesses III and queen Iset Ta-Hemdjert. As a prince, he was known as Ramesses Amunherkhepeshef and held the titles of royal scribe and cavalry general. He was succeeded by his son, Ramesses VII Itamun, whom he had fathered with queen Nubkhesbed.

After the death of the ruling pharaoh, Ramesses V, who was the son of Ramesses VI&#x27;s older brother, Ramesses IV, Ramesses VI ascended the throne. In the first two years after his coronation, Ramesses VI stopped frequent raids by Libyan or Egyptian marauders in Upper Egypt and buried his predecessor in what is now an unknown tomb of the Theban necropolis. Ramesses VI usurped KV9, a tomb in the Valley of the Kings planned by and for Ramesses V, and had it enlarged and redecorated for himself. The craftsmen&#x27;s huts near the entrance of KV9 covered up the entrance to Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, saving it from a wave of tomb robberies that occurred within 20 years of Ramesses VI&#x27;s death. Ramesses VI may have planned and made six more tombs in the Valley of the Queens, none which are known today.

Egypt lost control of its last strongholds in Canaan around the time of Ramesses VI&#x27;s reign. Though Egyptian occupation in Nubia continued, the loss of the Asiatic territories strained Egypt&#x27;s weakening economy and increased prices. With construction projects increasingly hard to fund, Ramesses VI usurped the monuments of his forefathers by engraving his cartouches over theirs. Yet he boasted of having &quot;[covered] all the land with great monuments in my name [...] built in honour of my fathers the gods&quot;. He was fond of cult statues of himself; more are known to portray him than any Twentieth-Dynasty king after Ramesses III. The Egyptologist Amin Amer characterises Ramesses VI as &quot;a king who wished to pose as a great pharaoh in an age of unrest and decline&quot;.

The pharaoh&#x27;s power waned in Upper Egypt during Ramesses VI&#x27;s rule. Though his daughter Iset was named God&#x27;s Wife of Amun, the high-priest of Amun, Ramessesnakht, turned Thebes into Egypt&#x27;s religious capital and a second center of power on par with Pi-Ramesses in Lower Egypt, where the pharaoh resided. In spite of these developments, there is no evidence that Ramessesnakht&#x27;s dynasty worked against royal interests, which suggests that the Ramesside kings may have approved of these evolutions.
Ramesses VI died in his forties, in his eighth or ninth year of rule. His mummy lay untouched in his tomb for fewer than 20 years before pillagers damaged it. The body was moved to KV35 during the reign of Pinedjem I, and was discovered in 1898 by Victor Loret. His mummy is currently kept in the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization.

==Family==
===Parents and early life===
Ramesses VI was a son of Ramesses III, the latter being considered the last great pharaoh of the New Kingdom period. This filiation is established beyond doubt by a large relief found in the portico of the Medinet Habu temple of Ramesses III known as the &quot;Procession of the Princes&quot;. The relief shows ten princes including Ramesses VI, worshipping their father. Ramesses III&#x27;s sculptors seem to have left the relief incomplete; only the figures of the king and princes appear and no names are written in the spaces next to them. The relief seems to have originally been executed when Ramesses VI was still a young prince, as he is shown wearing the sidelock of youth used to denote childhood.
When Ramesses VI became king, he added his princely names &quot;Ramesses Amunherkhepeshef&quot; inside royal cartouches as well as the titles he held before ascending the throne as &quot;king&#x27;s son of his body, his beloved, crown prince, royal scribe [and] cavalry general&quot;. He altered his youthful figure on the &quot;Procession of the Princes&quot; with an uraeus underscoring his royal status and further completed the relief with the names of all his brothers and sons, with the exception of Ramesses IV, who had already written his royal name on the relief.

Speculation in Egyptology during the 1960s and 1970s concerning the chronology and genealogy of the Twentieth Dynasty as well as uncertainties affecting the identity of the king shown on the &quot;Procession of princes&quot; relief led some scholars to propose that Ramesses VI was a grandson of Ramesses III and the son either of an unknown prince or of the infamous Pentawer involved in the murder of Ramesses III. Such hypotheses have now been conclusively rejected and the relief is understood to mean exactly what it shows: that Ramesses VI was the son of Ramesses III. Ramesses VI&#x27;s mother was probably Iset Ta-Hemdjert, Ramesses III&#x27;s Great Royal Wife, as suggested by the presence of Ramesses VI&#x27;s cartouches on a door-jamb of her tomb in the Valley of the Queens.

===Consort and children===

Ramesses VI&#x27;s Great Royal Wife was queen Nubkhesbed. The Egyptologists Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton believe that she bore Ramesses VI a total of four children: the princes Amenherkhepshef, Panebenkemyt and Ramesses Itamun—the future pharaoh Ramesses VII who succeeded his father for a short while on the throne—and princess Iset who was appointed to the priestly role of &quot;Divine Adoratrice of Amun&quot;. A stela recounting this appointment was discovered in Koptos and demonstrates that Nubkhesbed was indeed Iset&#x27;s mother.

Prince Amenherkhepshef died before his father and was buried in tomb KV13 in the Valley of the Kings, originally built for Chancellor Bay, an important official of the late Nineteenth Dynasty. The tomb decoration was updated in consequence, some reliefs notably mentioning Nubkhesbed. Amenherkhepshef&#x27;s sarcophagus was usurped from queen Twosret.

The filiation of Ramesses VII is established by an inscription on a doorjamb from Deir el-Medinaeh which reads &quot;the good god, lord of the two lands, Usimaare-meryamun-setepenre, Son of Re, lord of epiphanies, Ramesses [VII], (It)-Amun, god, ruler of Heliopolis—he has made as his monument for his father, (may) live the good god, lord of the two lands, Nebmaare-meryamun, Son of Re, [Ramesses VI]&quot;.

The Egyptologists James Harris, Edward F. Wente and Kenneth Kitchen have also proposed, based on circumstantial evidence, that Ramesses IX was a son of Ramesses VI and thus a brother to Ramesses VII. They note that Ramesses IX honoured Ramesses VII on two offering stands, suggesting that they were close kin. Ramesses IX named one of his sons Nebmaatre, which is Ramesses VI&#x27;s prenomen, possibly as a means to honour his father. This hypothesis is contested by other scholars including Dodson and Hilton, who believe that Ramesses IX was instead a son of prince Montuherkhopshef and thus a nephew to Ramesses VI. They base their conclusion on other circumstantial evidence: first is a depiction of Montuherkhopshef in KV19 on which Ramesses IX&#x27;s prenomen had been added. Second is the fact that Ramesses IX&#x27;s mother was named Takhat and Montuherkhopshef&#x27;s spouse might have been a lady of the same name, hence possibly the same person.

==Reign==
===Reign length===
Ramesses VI assumed the throne around the interval between Year 1 I Peret day 25 and Year 1 II Peret day 11 of his reign when his predecessor Ramesses V died. The scholarly consensus is now that Ramesses VI reigned in the mid 12th century BC over a period of eight full years and lived for two months into his brief last regnal year. More precisely, the Egyptologist Steve Vinson proposed that he reigned between 1156 BC and 1149 BC, while the Encyclopædia Britannica reports 1145–1137 BC, Jürgen von Beckerath gives 1142–1134 BC, Erik Hornung 1145–1139 BC, Nicolas Grimal 1144–1136 BC making him a contemporary of Nebuchadrezzar I of Isin, Ian Shaw, Jacobus van Dijk and Michael Rice 1143–1136 BC, and 1132–1125 BC in a 2017 study.

In 1977, the Egyptologists Edward F. Wente and Charles van Siclen were the first to propose, upon reviewing the chronology of the New Kingdom period, that Ramesses VI lived into his eighth year of reign. This hypothesis was vindicated the next year by the Egyptologist Jac Janssen, who published an analysis of an ostracon which mentions the loan of an ox in the seventh and eighth years of an unnamed king who can only have been Ramesses VI. Two years later, Lanny Bell reported further evidence that Ramesses VI not only reigned into his eighth regnal year but most likely completed it and lived into his ninth.
Ramesses VI&#x27;s eighth year on the throne may also be mentioned in Theban graffito 1860a, which names the then serving High Priest of Amun, Ramessesnakht. This graffito has also been ascribed to Ramesses X, but this interpretation has been contested and its ascription to Ramesses VI has been proposed as an alternative. The subject remains debated.
An important piece of evidence first recognised by Jansen in 1978 but fully exploited only five years later by the Egyptologist Raphael Ventura is found on the Turin Papyrus 1907+1908, which covers the time period from Ramesses VI&#x27;s fifth year until Ramesses VII&#x27;s seventh year on the throne.
The reconstruction of the document proposed by Ventura shows that the simplest solution available to explain the chronology of the period covered by the papyrus is that Ramesses VI enjoyed a reign of eight full years, died in his ninth, and was succeeded by Ramesses VII rather than Ramesses VIII, as had been debated until then.

===Activities and situation in Egypt===
====Early reign: strife in the Theban region====

Immediately after his accession to the throne, Ramesses VI and his court may have visited Thebes on the occasion of the Beautiful Festival of the Valley or the Opet Festival, concomitant with the preparations for Ramesses V&#x27;s burial. Ramesses VI visited the city on at least another occasion during his reign, when he installed his daughter as Divine Adoratrice of Amun. The situation in the south of Egypt at the time of Ramesses VI&#x27;s accession was not entirely stable, as attested by records showing that the workmen of Deir el-Bahari could not work on the king&#x27;s tomb owing to the presence of &quot;the enemy&quot; in the vicinity, a situation which occurred over a period of at least fifteen days during Ramesses VI&#x27;s first year on the throne. This &quot;enemy&quot; was rumoured to have pillaged and burned the locality of Per-Nebyt and the chief of the Medjay of Thebes—essentially the police—ordered the workmen to remain idle and watch the king&#x27;s tomb. It is unclear who these enemies were, the term could designate parties of Libyan Meshwesh, Libu and Egyptian bandits, or as the Egyptologist Jaroslav Černý conjectured, a full blown civil war between followers of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI, a hypothesis supported by Rice but which has been strongly rejected by Kitchen and, to a lesser extent, by Grimal and van Dijk.
A short military campaign might have ensued and from Ramesses VI&#x27;s second year on the throne onwards these troubles seem to have stopped. This campaign could be connected with an unusual statue of Ramesses VI showing him holding a bound Libyan captive, as well as with a depiction of Ramesses VI triumphing over foreign soldiers on the second pylon of the Karnak temple. This triumph scene was the last one to be made in Egypt until the later reigns of Siamun (986–967 BC) and Shoshenq I (943–922 BC).

Other indications in favour of strife and military activities early in Ramesses VI&#x27;s reign are the names he adopted upon ascending the throne, his Horus name meaning &quot;Strong bull, great of victories, keeping alive the two lands&quot; as well as his Nebty name &quot;Powerful of arms, attacking the myriads&quot;.

====Later reign====
Following these events, on his second year of rule, Ramesses VI finally buried Ramesses V in a yet unidentified tomb in the Valley of the Kings, having usurped the tomb originally prepared for his predecessor. On the occasion of this visit to Thebes, Ramesses VI installed his daughter Iset as God&#x27;s Wife of Amun and Divine Adoratice of Amun, in the presence of his mother, the acting vizier Nehy and other court officials. That same year, he ordered the reduction of the gang of workmen working on the king&#x27;s tomb from 120 members to its former number of 60, which had been changed under Ramesses IV. Following this, the community of workers at Deir el-Medina went into gradual decline, the settlement being finally abandoned in the subsequent Twenty-first Dynasty.
In spite of the reduction, the Turin papyrus indicates that Ramesses VI ordered the construction of six tombs in the Valley of the Queens, a number which might include the hasty completion of the tomb of Iset Ta-Hemdjert, Ramesses&#x27; mother.
It is unknown whether these tombs were finished and in any case, they are now unidentifiable.
At some point in his reign, a cult statue of Ramesses VI was installed in a shrine of Ramesses II in the temple of Hathor of Deir el-Medina. The statue was called &quot;Lord of the Two Lands, Nebmaatre Meryamun, Son of Re, Lord of Crowns, Ramesses Amunherkhepeshef Divine Ruler of Iunu, Beloved like Amun&quot;.
A complete description of it is given on the verso of the Turin Papyrus Map, celebrated for being the oldest surviving topographical map. The papyrus indicates that the statue was made of two essences of painted wood and clay, showing pharaoh wearing a golden loincloth, a crown of lapis-lazuli and precious stones, a uraeus of gold and sandals of electrum. The statue is said to receive three services of incense and libations every day. The text of the papyrus is a letter directly addressed to Ramesses VI asking that a certain man be put in charge of the offerings. The letter seems to have been received favourably by the king, as the author&#x27;s grandson is known to have held the title of &quot;High Priest of Nebmaatre [Ramesses VI], Beloved of Amun&quot;.

Ramesses VI was apparently fond of such cult statues and no less than ten statues and a sphinx have been discovered in Tanis, Bubastis and Karnak, more than any other Ramesside king of the Twentieth Dynasty following the reign of Ramesses III. The tomb of Penne, an Egyptian high-official in Nubia reports that Penne made a donation of lands to generate revenue towards the upkeep of yet another cult statue of Ramesses VI. Ramesses VI was so satisfied with this deed that he commanded his Viceroy of Kush &quot;Give the two silver vessels of ointment of gums, to the deputy [Penne]&quot;.

While few of Ramesses VI&#x27;s activities are known in details, he is well attested by numerous reliefs, inscriptions, statues and minor finds from Karnak, Koptos and Heliopolis.

====Economic decline====
Over the period spanning the reigns of Ramesses VI, VII and VIII, prices of basic commodities, in particular grain, rose sharply.
With Egypt&#x27;s economy getting weaker, Ramesses VI turned to usurping the statues and monuments of his forebears, frequently plastering and then carving his cartouches over theirs, in particular those of Ramesses IV which figured prominently along the processional routes in Karnak and Luxor. In other examples, he usurped a statue of Ramesses IV, columns of texts inscribed by Ramesses IV on an obelisk of Thutmose I in Karnak, and the tomb of Ramesses V. Kitchen warns not to over-interpret these usurpations as signs of antagonism on behalf of Ramesses VI with respect to his older brother and nephew. The usurpations were not thorough but were rather targeted to the most prominent places, where Ramesses VI&#x27;s cartouches would be most visible. Besides, Ramesses VI did leave cartouches of Ramesses IV intact in many places, including in places where both his name and that of his brother feature close to one another such as in the Medinet Habu temple of Ramesses III, so that the hypothesis of a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;—whereby all references to someone are systematically eliminated so as to remove this person from memory and history—can be eliminated.

A possible evidence for genuine architectural works on Ramesses VI&#x27;s behalf is found in Memphis, where an inscription on a granite gateway cornice of the temple of Ptah claims that he erected a great pylon of fine stone. Ramesses VI then boasts of &quot;covering all the land with great monuments in my name [...] built in honour of my fathers the gods&quot;.
Overall, the Egyptologist Amin Amer characterises Ramesses VI as &quot;a king who wished to pose as a great pharaoh in an age of unrest and decline&quot;.

===Dilution of power===
====High officials====
Some high officials of Ramesses VI are known, such as his finance minister and overseer of the treasury Montuemtawy who was in office since the end of Ramesses III&#x27;s reign; the vizier Neferronpe in office since Ramesses IV&#x27;s time on the throne; his son the vizier Nehy; Amenmose the mayor of Thebes and the king&#x27;s butler Qedren. To the south, the troop commander of Kush was Nebmarenakhte and the administrator of Wawat—the land between the first and second cataracts of the Nile—mayor of Anîba and controller of the Temple of Horus at Derr was Penne.

====The dynasty of Ramessesnakht====

In Thebes, the high-priesthood came under the control of Ramessesnakht and his family at the time of Ramesses IV, possibly owing to Ramessesnakht&#x27;s father Merybaste&#x27;s high control over the country&#x27;s financial institutions. Ramessesnakht was officially Ramesses VI&#x27;s Vizier of the South and his power grew at the expense of that of the pharaoh in spite of the fact that Iset was connected to the Amun priesthood as well &quot;in her role as God&#x27;s Wife of Amun or Divine Adoratice&quot;. If fact, Ramessesnakht most likely oversaw the construction of the funerary building of Iset in the tomb
complex K93.12, and while, as the Egyptologist Daniel Polz puts it, &quot;he and his relatives were the most powerful individuals in Egypt at the end of the Twentieth Dynasty&quot;, his activities were not directed against royal interests. Ramessesnakht often attended the distribution of supplies to workmen and controlled much of the activity connected with the construction of the king&#x27;s tomb, possibly because the treasury of the high-priest of Amun was now at least partially funding these works. Ramessesnakht&#x27;s son Usermarenakhte was made into the Steward of Amun and became administrator of large swaths of land in Middle Egypt. He also inherited the role of Merybaste as controller of the country&#x27;s taxes, ensuring that Ramessesnakht&#x27;s family was in full control of both the royal treasury and the treasury of Amun. Further high offices such as those of the second and third priests and of &quot;god&#x27;s father of Amun&quot; were given to people who entered Ramesesnakht&#x27;s family by marriage.

Ramessesnakht was powerful enough to build for himself one of the largest funerary establishments of the entire Theban necropolis at the end of the New Kingdom, when royal building projects including Ramesses VI&#x27;s usurped mortuary temple had been abandoned. Ramessesnakht&#x27;s monument, in Dra&#x27; Abu el-Naga&#x27;, reused an earlier building dating back to the Seventeenth or Eighteenth Dynasty and was refurbished to show the political and economic standing of its owner. Overall, Egyptologists now estimate that Ramessesnakht and his dynasty essentially established a second centre of power in Upper Egypt, seemingly on the behalf of the Twentieth Dynasty kings who ruled from Memphis and Pi-Ramesses in Lower Egypt. This effectively made Thebes into the religious capital of Egypt as well as an administrative one on a par with its northern counterpart, laying the foundations for the rise of the Twenty-first Dynasty under Herihor and Pinedjem I, 50 to 70 years later.

===Situation in Egypt&#x27;s empire abroad===
====Final decline in Canaan====

Egypt&#x27;s political and economic decline continued unabated during Ramesses VI&#x27;s reign. He is the last king of the New Kingdom period whose name is attested on inscribed wall fragments as well as two pillars of the temple of Hathor of the Serabit el-Khadim in Sinai, where he sent expeditions to mine copper ore.

Egypt may nonetheless still have wielded some sort of influence or at least still had some connections with the remnants of its empire in the Levant, as suggested by the base of a fragmented bronze statue of Ramesses VI discovered in Megiddo in Canaan, and a scarab of his from Alalakh on the coast in southern Anatolia.

Egyptian presence in Canaan was terminated during or soon after Ramesses VI&#x27;s rule, with the last garrisons leaving southern and western Palestine around the time, and the frontier between Egypt and abroad returning to a fortified line joining the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. A 2017 archaeological study reached the same conclusion, namely that Ramesses VI&#x27;s reign is the terminus post quem for the presence of the Egyptian military in Jaffa, which was twice destroyed around this time period. Opponents of the Egyptian authority were of local extraction, probably originating in Canaanite cities of the Levantine coastal plain, an opposition to Egyptian hegemony ultimately resulting from the arrival of the Sea People in the region during the reign of Ramesses III. The loss of all Asiatic territories further strained the redistributive economy of Egypt&#x27;s New Kingdom society, depriving the subsequent kings of much of their legitimacy.

====Continuing presence in Nubia====
The Egyptian control of Nubia seems to have been much firmer at the time, owing either to the advanced Egyptianisation of the local population or to the economic importance of this region. Ramesses VI&#x27;s cartouches have been uncovered on Sehel Island near Aswan and in Ramesses II&#x27;s temple in Wadi es-Sebua. Ramesses VI is mentioned in the tomb of Penne in Anîba, not far from the Third Cataract of the Nile. Penne also recounts punitive military raids further south, from which he claims to have brought back loot to pharaoh.

==Funerary monuments==
===Tomb===
Ramesses VI was buried in the Valley of the Kings, in a tomb now known as KV9. The tomb was first built for Ramesses V, who may have been buried in it for the short period of time necessary for another, likely undecorated tomb, to be cut for him somewhere else in the Valley of Kings and which remains to be discovered. In any case, Ramesses VI commanded that KV9 be entirely refurbished for himself with no space left for Ramesses V&#x27;s permanent burial, who was finally led to rest in Ramesses VI&#x27;s second year on the throne, possibly because stability had returned to Thebes at the time. The usurpation of Ramesses V&#x27;s tomb may be a sign that Ramesses VI did not hold his predecessor in high regard, which would explain why he had Ramesses V&#x27;s name obliterated and replaced by his own on more than one occasion. Alternatively it may reflect the king&#x27;s pragmatic concern for economical measures.
The renewed works on KV9 are responsible for the preservation of the tomb of Tutankhamun, the entrance of which was buried beneath huts built for the craftsmen working on Ramesses VI&#x27;s tomb. These works seem to have been completed during Ramesses VI&#x27;s sixth year of reign, at which point Ramessesnakht received 600 debens of blunted copper tools in the great forecourt of Amun in Karnak, probably indicating the end of the construction works on the tomb. Furthermore, if the Theban ostracon 1860a does refer to Ramesses VI and not Ramesses X, then it indicates that the tomb was finally ready for the king in his eighth year on the throne, at which point he might have been ill and nearing death. Once finished, the tomb was -long and included one of only three complete renditions of the Book of Gates known from royal funerary context, as well as a complete version of the Book of Caverns.

Within 20 years of Ramesses VI&#x27;s burial, the tomb was most probably desecrated and ransacked by grave robbers, who hacked away at the hands and feet of Ramesses&#x27; mummy to gain access to his jewelry. These events, occurring during the reign of Ramesses XI, are described in the Papyrus Mayer B although the identification of the tomb mentioned in this source is not entirely certain. Ramesses VI&#x27;s mummy was subsequently moved to the tomb KV35 of Amenhotep II during the reign of Pinedjem of the early Twenty-First Dynasty, where it was discovered in 1898 by Victor Loret.
A medical examination of the mummy revealed that Ramesses VI died aged around forty, and showed severe damage to his body, the head and torso being broken into several pieces by an axe used by the tomb robbers. An isolated female hand was found within the mummy&#x27;s wrappings.

In 1898, Georges Émile Jules Daressy cleared KV9, which had remained opened since antiquity, uncovering fragments of a large granite box as well as numerous pieces of Ramesses VI&#x27;s stone sarcophagus, the face of which is now in the British Museum. The sarcophagus was restored in 2004 following two years of work on over 250 fragments recovered in the tomb, where it is now on display. Zahi Hawass, then head of Egypt&#x27;s Supreme Council of Antiquities, unsuccessfully requested the return of the sarcophagus&#x27; face from the British Museum to Egypt.

In 2020, the Egyptian Tourism Authority released a full 3D model of the tomb with detailed photographies, available online.

In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Egyptian Museum to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade. 

===Mortuary temple===

Ramesses VI seems to have usurped the large mortuary temple in El-Assasif from Ramesses V, who had himself likely taken it from his father Ramesses IV. The temple was planned to be nearly half the size of that of Medinet Habu and was only in its foundation stages at the death of Ramesses IV. It is unclear whether it was ever completed, but the temple is mentioned as a land-owning institution in the Wilbour Papyrus dating to Ramesses V&#x27;s reign. Archaeological excavations show much of its surviving decoration was made under Ramesses VI.

Patrimonio has seen action for the Philippine national team many times in his playing career. Together with Allan Caidic, he shares the record of seeing action for the Asian Games four consecutive times in 1986, 1990, 1994 and 1998.

In the 1986 Asian Games, he was part of the all-amateur Philippine national team that was coached by Joe Lipa. The national team won the bronze medal after beating Jordan, 83-81. It finished third behind China and South Korea.

In the 1990 Asian Games,he was part of an all-PBA Philippine national team that was coached by Robert Jaworski. It was the first time that professional basketball players competed in the said event. It won the silver medal. It finished second after losing the Gold Medal Game to eventual champion China, 90-74.

In the 1994 Asian Games, he was part of the San Miguel Beer team that was sent to represent the Philippines compete in the Men&#x27;s Basketball tournament. The team was coached by Norman Black. The national team lost the Bronze Medal Game to Japan, 79-76.

In the 1998 Asian Games, he was part of an all-PBA Philippine national team also known as the Philippine Centennial Team. The team was coached by Tim Cone. It won the bronze medal after beating Kazakhstan, 73-68. The same team also won the 1998 William Jones Cup after beating Chinese Taipei in the championship game, 82-72.

In 2000, he was part of the all-PBA All-Stars Select Team that represented the Philippines in the FIBA Asia All-Star Extravaganza. The said team was coached by Tim Cone.

==PBA career==
Patrimonio entered the PBA in 1988 alongside the Rookie of the Year Jojo Lastimosa, many-time Mythical Team and Best Defensive Team member Jerry Codiñera and perennial Best Defensive Team member Glenn Capacio.

He was the subject of a controversy between Swift, his PABL team, and Purefoods, the team who drafted him. Both happen to be corporate rivals. There was a dispute between the two franchises which delayed his entry to the PBA. This ruined his chances of winning the Rookie of the Year award.

He stands at 6&#x27;3&quot; and primarily played at the power forward position in the professional league. He also played the center position in his collegiate and amateur days. His style of play was said to be comparable to Karl Malone, characterized by rugged physical play punctuated by finesse maneuvers. His known trademark was the spin move to the low post which he utilized to great effect due to his exceptional pivoting skills.

In 1991, he signed a 5-year 25 million peso offer sheet from cellar-dwelling PBA ballclub Pepsi Hotshots which was matched by his mother ballclub Purefoods TJ Hotdogs. Patrimonio&#x27;s new contract ushered the era of the multi-millionaire players. He justified this contract by winning the 1991, 1993 and 1994 Most Valuable Player awards of the PBA and leading the team to three conference championships. At the end of the contract, he managed to win his fourth Most Valuable Player award in the 1997 season, thus tying the all-time record.

Over time, his dominance in the post meant that he was accorded an automatic double or triple-team whenever he had possession in the low block. This led to the gradual adjustment of his game as he advanced in his career, showing superior playmaking abilities from passing out of multiple defenders at the post.

At the latter stage of his lengthy career, he also developed an accurate 3 point shot, and in 1998 he even led the league in 3 point FG percentage. With these added skills, he rounded out his playing days manning the small forward position.

In 2004, 16 years after playing in the pro league, he announced his retirement to concentrate more on his duties as the current team manager of the Purefoods franchise in the PBA. Arguably one of the best power forwards in the history of the PBA, he was as a prolific scorer ending his career as the league&#x27;s third highest point scorer with 15,091, behind all-time greats Ramon Fernandez and Abet Guidaben with 18,996 and 15,775 points respectively; and a great rebounder as well by ending up the fourth all-time in PBA history with more than 6,000 boards.

On November 26, 2005, he played in the Legends 3-Point Shootout during the PBA All-Star in Laoag, Ilocos Norte. The game saw Patrimonio sink the very last money ball to prop the Legends, also composed of Ronnie Magsanoc and Frankie Lim, to a 41-39 win over the young Turks of Jimmy Alapag, Ren-Ren Ritualo, and Dondon Hontiveros.

He has a reputation for being one of the most beloved players in Philippine basketball, and is arguably the second most popular player of all time, just behind &quot;Living Legend&quot; Robert Jaworski.

==Coaching career==
In 2016, the NU Bulldogs men&#x27;s basketball team tapped Patrimonio as part of the coaching staff.

==Hall of Fame==
Patrimonio was inducted to the PBA Hall of Fame in 2011. Other honorees for the class of 2011 were Billy Ray Bates, Freddie Hubalde, Tommy Manotoc, Mariano Yenko, Tito Eduque and Bobong Velez. They were the fourth group of individuals that was honored by the league.

<text>Usermaatre Setepenre Meryamun Ramesses VII (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the sixth pharaoh of the 20th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. He reigned from about 1136 to 1129 BC and was the son of Ramesses VI. Other dates for his reign are 1138–1131 BC. The Turin Accounting Papyrus 1907+1908 is dated to Year 7 III Shemu day 26 of his reign and has been reconstructed to show that 11 full years passed from Year 5 of Ramesses VI to Year 7 of his reign.

==Reign length==
Ramesses VII&#x27;s seventh year is also attested in Ostraca O. Strasbourg h 84, which is dated to II Shemu day 16 of his 7th Regnal Year. In 1980, C.J. Eyre demonstrated that a Year 8 papyrus belonged to the reign of Ramesses VII. This papyrus, P. Turin Cat. 1883 + 2095, dated to &quot;Year 8 IV Shemu day 25&quot; (most likely Ramesses VII), details the record of the commissioning of some copper work and mentions two foremen at Deir El-Medina: Nekhemmut and Hor[mose]. The foreman Hormose was previously attested in office only during the reign of Ramesses IX while his father and predecessor in this post—a certain Ankherkhau—served in office from the second decade of the reign of Ramesses III through to Year 4 of Ramesses VII, where he is shown acting with Nekhemmut and the scribe Horisheri. The new Year 8 papyrus proves that Hormose succeeded to his father&#x27;s office as foreman by Year 8 of Ramesses VII. Dominique Valbelle regards C.J. Eyre&#x27;s attribution of this document to Ramesses VII as uncertain since the chief workman Hormose was previously only securely attested in office in Years 6 and 7 of Ramesses IX instead. However, this papyrus clearly bears the cartouche of Usermaatre Setepenre—the prenomen of Ramesses VII—at its beginning whereas the royal name of Ramesses IX was Neferkare—which rules out Ramesses IX as the king whose Year 8 is recorded in the P. Turin 1883 + 2095 document. The presence of Hormose&#x27;s contemporary—the foreman Nekhemmut—also establishes that this papyrus dates to the mid-20th dynasty--most probably to the reign of Ramesses VII, since Nekhemmut is attested in office &quot;from the second year of Ramesses IV until the seventeenth year of Ramesses IX.&quot;

Since Ramesses VII&#x27;s accession is known to have occurred around the end of III Peret, the king would have ruled Egypt for a minimum period of 7 years and 5 months when this document was drawn up provided that it belonged to his reign as seems probable from the royal name given in the papyrus. The respected German Egyptologist Jürgen von Beckerath also accepts C.J. Eyre&#x27;s evidence that Year 8 IV Shemu day 25 was Ramesses VII&#x27;s highest known date. However, the accession date of his successor, Ramesses VIII, has been fixed by Amin Amer to an 8-month period between I Peret day 2 and I Akhet day 13, or 5 months after the Year 8 IV Shemu day 25 date of Ramesses VII. Therefore, if Ramesses VII did not die between the short 2 week period between IV Shemu day 29 to I Akhet 13, this pharaoh would have been on the throne for at least another 4 more months until I Peret day 2 and ruled Egypt for 7 years and 9 months when he died (perhaps slightly longer if he died after I Peret day 2). Therefore, it is possible that Ramesses VII could have ruled Egypt for almost 8 years; at present, his certain reign length is 7 years and 5 months.

Very little is known about his reign, though it was evidently a period of some turmoil, as grain prices soared.

==Ramesses VII&#x27;s tomb and funerary equipment==
Ramesses VII was buried in Tomb KV1 upon his death. His mummy has never been found, though four cups inscribed with the pharaoh&#x27;s name were found in the &quot;royal cache&quot; in DB320 along with the remains of other pharaohs.

<text>Mount Sinai Hospital, founded in 1852, is one of the oldest and largest teaching hospitals in the United States. It is located in East Harlem in the New York City borough of Manhattan, on the eastern border of Central Park stretching along Madison and Fifth Avenues, between East 98th Street and East 103rd Street. 

The Mount Siani Hospital is a tertiary and quaternary care facility and as such offers care in all medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties. The hospital is a AIDS center, Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner (SAFE) Program Hospital, Comprehensive Stroke Center, and Regional Perinatal Center. The maternity program is among the busiest in New York State with just over 7,000 deliveries per year.

In March 2023, the hospital was ranked 23rd among over 2,300 hospitals in the world and the best hospital in New York state by &quot;Newsweek.&quot; Adjacent to the hospital is the Mount Sinai Kravis Children&#x27;s Hospital which provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21 throughout the region.

==History==
===Early years===
At the time of the founding of the hospital in 1852, other hospitals in New York City discriminated against Jewish people both by not hiring them to treat patients, and by prohibiting them from being treated in the hospitals&#x27; wards. Orthodox Jewish philanthropist Sampson Simson (1780–1857) founded the hospital to address the needs of New York City&#x27;s rapidly growing Jewish immigrant community. It was the second Jewish hospital in the United States, after the Jewish Hospital, located in Cincinnati, Ohio, which was established in 1847.

, as it was called until adopting its current name in 1866, was built on West 28th Street in Manhattan, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, on land donated by Simson. It opened two years before Simson&#x27;s death. Four years later, it was unexpectedly filled to capacity with soldiers injured in the American Civil War.

The Jews&#x27; Hospital felt the effects of the escalating Civil War in other ways, as staff doctors and board members were called into service. Dr. Israel Moses served four years as lieutenant colonel in the 72nd New York Infantry Regiment; Joseph Seligman had to resign as a member of the board of directors, as he was increasingly called upon by President Lincoln for advice on the country&#x27;s growing financial crisis.

The New York Draft Riots of 1863 also strained the hospital&#x27;s resources, as it struggled to tend to the many wounded.
More and more, the Jews&#x27; Hospital was finding itself an integral part of the general community. In 1866, to reflect this new-found role, it changed its name. In 1872, the hospital moved uptown to the east side of Lexington Avenue between East 66th and 67th streets.

===20th century===
Now called Mount Sinai Hospital, the institution forged relationships with many physicians who made contributions to medicine, including Henry N. Heineman, Frederick S. Mandelbaum, Bernard Sachs, Charles A. Elsberg, Emanuel Libman, and, most significantly, Abraham Jacobi, known as the father of American pediatrics and a champion of construction at the hospital&#x27;s new site on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side in 1904.

The hospital established a school of nursing in 1881. Created by Alma deLeon Hendricks and a small group of women, Mount Sinai Hospital Training School for Nurses was taken over by the hospital in 1895. In 1923, its name was changed to Mount Sinai Hospital School of Nursing. This school closed in 1971 after graduating 4,700 women and one man in the last class. An active alumnae association continues. Since 2013, the nursing school of the Mount Sinai Health System has been Mount Sinai Phillips School of Nursing (PSON).
The early 20th century saw the population of New York City explode. That, coupled with many new discoveries at Mount Sinai (including significant advances in blood transfusions and the first endotracheal anesthesia apparatus), meant that Mount Sinai&#x27;s pool of doctors and experts was in increasing demand. A $1.35 million ($ in current dollar terms) expansion of the 1904 hospital site raced to keep pace with demand. The opening of the new buildings was delayed by the advent of World War I. Mount Sinai responded to a request from the United States Army Medical Corps with the creation of Base Hospital No.3. This unit went to France in early 1918, and treated 9,127 patients with 172 deaths: 54 surgical and 118 medical, the latter due mainly to influenza and pneumonia.

====World War II====
Two decades later, with tensions in Europe escalating, a committee dedicated to finding placements for doctors fleeing Nazi Germany was founded in 1933. With the help of the National Committee for the Resettlement of Foreign Physicians, Mount Sinai Hospital became a new home for a large number of &quot;émigrés&quot;. When World War II broke out, Mount Sinai was the first hospital to throw open its doors to Red Cross nurses&#x27; aides; the hospital trained many in its effort to reduce the nursing shortage in the United States. Meanwhile, the president of the medical board, George Baehr, M.D., was called by President Roosevelt to serve as the nation&#x27;s chief medical director of the Office of Civilian Defense.

These wartime roles were eclipsed, however, when the men and women of Mount Sinai&#x27;s 3rd General Hospital set sail for Casablanca, Morocco, eventually setting up a 1,000-bed hospital in war-torn Tunisia. Before moving to tend to the needs of soldiers in Italy and France, the 3rd General Hospital had treated more than 5,000 wounded soldiers.

====Postwar====

In 1963, the hospital created a medical school, and in 1968, it welcomed the first students of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, now the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The 1980s had a $500 million hospital expansion, including the construction of the Guggenheim Pavilion, the first medical facility designed by I.M. Pei. Its faculty has made significant contributions to gene therapy, cardiology, immunotherapy, organ transplants, cancer treatments, and minimally invasive surgery.

Among the innovations at Mount Sinai were performing the first blood transplant into the vein of a fetus in 1986, and the development of a technique for inserting radioactive seeds into the prostate to treat cancer in 1995.

===21st century===
At Mount Sinai the staff performed the first successful composite tracheal transplant, which was performed at the hospital in 2005.

Dr. Jack M. Gorman, formerly Department Chairman of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai, engaged in a long-term inappropriate sexual relationship with a patient prior to October 2005.

In January 2013 David L. Reich was the first openly gay medical doctor named interim president of Mount Sinai Hospital as reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In October of the same year he was named president.

In August 2016 Dennis S. Charney, the dean of the medical school, was shot and wounded as he left a deli in his home town of Chappaqua, New York. Hengjun Chao, a former Mount Sinai medical researcher who had been fired by Charney for research misconduct in 2010, was convicted of attempted second degree murder and two other charges in 2017, and received a sentence of 28 years.

In 2017, Dr. David H. Newman, a former emergency room physician at Mount Sinai Hospital, was sentenced to two years in prison for sexually abusing four female patients in the emergency room between 2015 and 2016, including touching their breasts.

Three doctors were convicted of violating anti-kickback laws by accepting bribes disguised as speaker fees to write prescriptions to a highly addictive fentanyl opioid painkiller. Gordon Freedman, an anesthesiologist at Mount Sinai, was convicted in December 2019 in Manhattan federal court. Alexandru Burducea, a pain management doctor and anesthesiologist who previously worked at Mount Sinai, was sentenced in January 2020 to 57 months in prison. Dialecti Voudouris, who specialized in oncology and hematology at Lenox Hill Hospital and Mount Sinai, was sentenced in 2020 to time served.

In April 2019, a lawsuit was filed against Mount Sinai Health System and several employees of the hospital and the Icahn School&#x27;s Arnhold Institute for Global Health. The suit was filed by eight current and former doctors and employees for alleged age and sex discrimination and based on a list of other allegations. The school denied the claims.

Dr. David Reich, president and COO of the hospital, announced in March 2020 that the hospital was converting its lobbies into extra patient rooms to &quot;meet the growing volume of patients&quot; with coronavirus.

<text>The Military Medal (MM) was a military decoration awarded to personnel of the British Army and other arms of the armed forces, and to personnel of other Commonwealth countries, below commissioned rank, for bravery in battle on land. The award was established in 1916, with retrospective application to 1914, and was awarded to other ranks for &quot;acts of gallantry and devotion to duty under fire&quot;. The award was discontinued in 1993, when it was replaced by the Military Cross, which was extended to all ranks, while other Commonwealth nations instituted their own award systems in the post war period.

==History==
The Military Medal was established on 25 March 1916. It was awarded to other ranks including non-commissioned officers and warrant officers, and ranked below the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM). Awards to British and Commonwealth forces were announced in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, but not honorary awards to allied forces. (Lists of awards to allied forces were published by The National Archives in 2018 and are kept in country specific files within WO 388/6.)

When the medal was first introduced, it was unpopular among regular soldiers. MM and DCM recipient Frank Richards wrote that &quot;the Military Medal without a shadow of a doubt had been introduced to save awarding too many DCMs. The old regular soldiers thought very little of the new decoration&quot;. Both the DCM and the MM attracted a gratuity and the decoration allowance of an extra sixpence a day to veterans with a disability pension. However, the allowance was only awarded once even if the recipient was awarded more than one gallantry award. The ratio in the First World War was approximately five MMs awarded for every DCM.

From September 1916 members of the Royal Naval Division, serving on Western Front alongside the Army, were made eligible for military decorations, including the Military Medal, for the war&#x27;s duration. It could also be awarded to members of the Royal Air Force for gallant service on the ground.

Eligibility for the MM was extended, by a Royal Warrant dated 21 June 1916, to women whether British subjects or foreign, with the first awards gazetted on 1 September 1916. Although nurses of the Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS) and the Territorial Force Nursing Service (TFNS) and other women serving with the British Army often had the social status of officers, they did not hold an officer&#x27;s commission and were therefore ineligible for the Military Cross, but could be and were awarded the MM. Louisa Nolan, a civilian during the Easter Rising in Dublin, was awarded the Military Medal for her courage under fire in providing humanitarian aid to the wounded.

Since 1918 recipients of the Military Medal have been entitled to the post-nominal letters &quot;MM&quot;.

Eligibility was extended to soldiers of the Indian Army in 1944.

The Military Medal was discontinued in 1993, as part of the review of the British honours system, which recommended removing distinctions of rank in respect of awards for bravery. Since then the Military Cross, previously only open to Commissioned and Warrant Officers, has been awarded to all ranks. The MM had also been awarded by Commonwealth countries but by the 1990s most, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, were establishing their own honours systems and no longer recommended British honours.

== Description ==
The medal and ribbon had the following features:
* A circular silver medal of 36 mm diameter. 
* The obverse bears the effigy of the reigning monarch and an appropriate inscription. 
* The reverse has the inscription &quot;for bravery in the field&quot; in four lines, surrounded by a laurel wreath, surmounted by the Royal Cypher and Imperial Crown.
* The suspender is of an ornate scroll type.
* The ribbon is dark blue, wide with five equal centre stripes of white, red, white, red, and white, each wide.
* The name and service details of the recipient were impressed on the rim of the medal, although honorary awards to foreign recipients were issued unnamed.
* Silver, laurelled bars were authorised for subsequent awards, with a silver rosette worn on the ribbon bar to indicate the award of each bar.

=== Obverse variations ===
The medal was awarded with one of six obverse designs:

==Numbers of awards==
Between 1916 and 1993 approximately 138,517 medals and 6,167 bars were awarded. The dates below reflect the relevant London Gazette entries:

The above figures include awards to the Dominions:

In all, 13,654 Military Medals were awarded to those serving with Canadian forces, including 848 first bars and 38 second bars.

Australian Army members received 11,038 and 14 were to awarded Air Force personnel; 478 first bars were awarded, 15 second bars and one third bar.

Over 2,500 were awarded to New Zealanders, the last being for the Vietnam War.

The honorary MM awards were made to servicemen and women from eleven allied countries in the First World War, and nine in the Second World War.

During the First World War, 127 Military Medals were awarded to women, plus about a dozen honorary awards to foreign women.

There was one instance of a third bar being awarded, to Private Ernest Albert Corey, who served on the Western Front as a stretcher bearer in the 55th Australian Infantry Battalion.

The only recipient to receive two bars during the Second World War was Sergeant Fred Kite, Royal Tank Regiment.

<text>The independence of Bangladesh was declared from Pakistan on 26 March 1971, which is now celebrated as Independence Day. The Bangladesh Liberation War started on 26 March and lasted till 16 December 1971 which is celebrated as Victory Day in Bangladesh. In the early hours of March 26, 1971, the undisputed leader of Bengali, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, declared independence before being arrested by the Pakistani army. Later many others declared on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

==History==
===Background===
In 1905, the British Raj partitioned the Bengal Presidency into East Bengal and West Bengal. The British introduced the Morley-Minto Reforms in 1909 which made the electorate system based on religion and East Bengal was largely Muslim. The Bengal Provincial Muslim League was created to represent Bengali Muslims. The two Bengals were reunited in 1912 in a decision by the British which was unpopular among the Muslims which feared it would harm the interests of their community. The 1946 Cabinet Mission to India decided to partition Bengal and in 1947 Bengal was partitioned again. West Bengal went to India and East Bengal went to Pakistan becoming East Pakistan. The Partition of India took place along religious lines with Muslim majority areas going to Pakistan.

=== Path to independence ===

An organization called &quot;Inner Group&quot; was formed in 1947 before the independence of Pakistan. It was active in the 1950s with Indian help to separate East Bengal from Pakistan and form a new state. Members of the organisations from Bengal Provincial Muslim League following the ideals of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose were close to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This organization based in Dhaka wanted to engage in armed struggle with the help of Great Britain under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. East Pakistan, where Bengali was the language spoken by the majority, opposed the move by the founder of Pakistan, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, to make Urdu the national language. The people of East Pakistan demanded Bengali be made a national language in the Bengali Language movement. Krishak Sramik Party demanded autonomy for East Bengal in 1953 and won the provincial election against the Pakistan Muslim League in 1954. A. K. Fazlul Huq, leader of the Krishak Sramik Party, becomes the chief minister of East Pakistan. On 31 May 1954, the Krishak Sramik Party was removed from power. Chief Minister A. K. Fazlul Huq and party general secretary Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were placed under house arrest on charges of separatism.

After Ayub Khan imposed military rule in Pakistan in 1958, some members of Awami League formed a separatist organization called &quot;East Bengal Liberation Front&quot; in Jamalpur, they asked Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru for help in the war of independence, but he refused because of the Nehru–Liaquat Pact. Later, when the government arrested the leaders of the organization, it became inactive. In 1961, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called upon the leaders of the East Pakistan Communist Party to jointly agitate with the Awami League for the independence of East Pakistan. When a group of Communist Party leaders led by Moni Singh sought permission from the Soviet Union to join the freedom movement, the party was reluctant to join as they did not receive a positive response. In 1962, a separatist organization called the &quot;Provisional East Bengal Government&quot; was formed which proposed the independence of East Pakistan. In 1963, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman wrote to prime minister Nehru to discuss the declaration of independence of East Pakistan and the formation of a government-in-exile in London. But Nehru did not want to talk to Mujib as the Sino-Indian war was going on. From 1963 to 1965, East Pakistan presented a case of economic deprivation with resources from the province benefitting West Pakistan at the cost of development in East Pakistan. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, now leader of the Awami League, was arrested in 1966 and charged in the Agartala conspiracy case, which accused prominent East Pakistanis of trying to separate the country with help from India, in 1968. The 1969 East Pakistan mass uprising saw the charges in the Agartala conspiracy case being dropped. In a party meeting on 5 December 1969, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proposed to name East Pakistan &quot;Bangladesh&quot; if it became independent. Sarbadalia Chhatra Sangram Parishad was created to press the government of Pakistan for the independence of East Pakistan. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is released from prison on 22 February 1970 by President Ayub Khan. On 10 March 1970, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman demanded autonomy for East Pakistan based on the Six Point program of the Awami League. Moulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani ends a public event with the slogan East Pakistan Zindabad on 23 November. 1970 Bhola cyclone killed 300 to 500 thousand people in East Pakistan. The people of East Pakistan found relief efforts by Pakistan government inadequate and felt neglected.

Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won 288 seats out of 300 seats in the provincial assembly. It won 167 of 300 seats in the National Assembly of Pakistan. Despite the overwhelming victory, the Awami League was not allowed to form a government by the military administration of Pakistan led by General Yahya Khan. On 7 March 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman gave a historic speech to resist the West Pakistan administration, through refusing to follow their orders and paying taxes. The crowd at the event chanted Jai Bangla (victory to Bengal). On 19 March, soldiers of Pakistan Army from East Pakistan and West Pakistan had a small skirmish at the Gazipur Ordnance Factory after the East Bengal Regiment refused to fire at crowds of protesting Bengalis. On 24 March, soldiers of East Pakistan Rifles raised the flag of independent Bangladesh in Jessore District.

=== Proclamation by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ===

On 26 March 1971,Bir Uttam Major Ziaur Rahman declared independence on radio.
Pakistan launched a crackdown on East Pakistan called Operation Searchlight and declared martial law, which was heard by only a limited number of people due to the broadcasting system used. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was detained by Pakistan Army soon after. On 27 March, Major Ziaur Rahman, officer of the East Bengal Regiment, declared the Independence of Bangladesh from Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and called the actions of Pakistan Army a massacre while asking for intervention of the United Nations. On 10 April, Bengals members of provincial and national assembly gathered in Kolkata and created a government in exile. It created the Proclamation of Independence which was read from Baidyanathtala in Meherpur District.

====Recognition====

Bhutan recognized Bangladesh on 6 December and was followed by India a few hours later on the same day. They were the first two countries to recognize independent Bangladesh. East Germany recognized Bangladesh on 11 January 1972, becoming the third country to do so. On 7 February, Israel recognised Bangladesh following a request by the foreign minister of Bangladesh, Mostaq Ahmad.

=== Independence Day ===

The Independence Day of Bangladesh is celebrated on 26 March, the day Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared the Independence of Bangladesh. Various programs are organised in the country to mark the occasion. The National Flag of Bangladesh is flown on all government buildings. The Independence Day Award was introduced by the Government of Bangladesh in 1977. The award is given on the Independence Day of Bangladesh on 26 March. The first Independence Day was celebrated on 26 March 1972, in which President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed the nation through a broadcast of the government reforms planned, such as the improvement in social rights.

The launch of Operation Searchlight and declaration of Independence marked the start of Bangladesh Liberation War on 26 March 1971. The war lasted nine months and ended on 16 December 1971. The Pakistan Army targeted religious minorities and political supporters of the Independence of Bangladesh. The actions culminated in what is known as the Bangladesh Genocide. During the war, 15 million refugees from East Pakistan moved to India.

=== Casualities ===

* 3 millions Bangladeshi were killed by Pakistani Army
* 2 hundred thousands women were raped and tortured by the Pakistani Military in their base camps

===Victory day===
Victory Day is on 16 December and it commemorates the surrender of Pakistan to Bangladesh India joint forces at the end of Bangladesh Liberation War. It is celebrated as Vijay Diwas in India.

==Causes==
===Cable 1971===
Cable 1971, otherwise known as Priority Signal or File 1971 was a high profile and secret military signal communicated in December 1952 between the two main inter-services branches of Pakistan–the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Navy. It is notable for the fact that it essentially predicted the separation of Pakistan and Bangladesh and by coincidence its title contained the year in which the separation actually happened, almost 20 years later.

The cable discussed the implication of One Unit and one culture policy, religious fanaticism, and the economic parity between the West and East Pakistan that will ultimately result in the division of Pakistan into two different groups.

The cable&#x27;s message read as:
* The creation of Committee of Ulema to veto the decisions taken in the House of People on religious matters, gives excess of powers to Ulema over the rights of elected representatives of the people. This gives an impression of Pakistan as being a theocratic state.
* To recommend that the head of the state should be a Muslim will unnecessarily create suspicions in minds of the minorities in Pakistan. The choice to select the head of the state should be left entirely to the people, to select without prejudice to caste, colour and creed.
* It is maintained by same officers that a single House elected on population basis should have been envisaged, and we should cease to think in terms of Bengalis, Pathans, Balochis, Sindhis, Punjabis etc. The parity between West &amp; East Pakistan will ultimately result in the division of Pakistan into two different groups, therefore, it is the very negation of one people, one country and one culture.

The cable is notable for its highlighted title and many historians found strange that the cable was coincidentally numbered: Cable/File 1971.
===Bengali language as national identity===
Language played a key role in the independence movement of Bangladesh and became a key feature in nation-building after the Liberation War against Pakistan. Since the foundation and independence of Pakistan in 1947, language was a key dividing issue in the newly established state. The new Pakistani elite faced a difficult task of uniting all its citizens into a united Pakistani nation, and one immediate question that arose with the new state was about the language that would be used to conduct Pakistan&#x27;s state business. The Pakistan Educational Conference of November 1947 proposed Urdu as the national language even though it was spoken by only 3% of Pakistanis, compared to 56% who spoke Bengali. The first population census revealed that Pakistan had 78 million inhabitants, of whom 44 million (55%) lived in East Pakistan. However, the country&#x27;s rulers were concentrated in West Pakistan and used Islam to dismiss Bengali&#x27;s protests as un-Islamic or anti-Islamic. Students in East Pakistan held meetings and demonstrations and formed the Language Action Committee in December 1947 when they learned about the plans to make Urdu the national language.

The Bengali language movement, or Bhasha Andolon, was started by students at schools, colleges and universities. The success of this movement forced Pakistan to change its policies and fueled the emergence of Bengali ethno-nationalism, which led to the creation of Bangladesh as an independent state and the breakup of Pakistan in 1971. When the movement began to challenge West Pakistani domination in East Pakistan, the citizens and the press in West Pakistan thought that it was orchestrated by Hindus, communists and anti-state elements trying to destabilize the state. Thousands of young Bengali boys and girls from schools and universities in Dhaka assembled on the campus of Dhaka University marching and shouting slogans like &quot;Bengali as a national language!&quot; (rastrabhdsa bamla cai!). As soon as the students passed the campus gates, armed policemen baton-charged them; the students retaliated by throwing bricks before policemen fired tear gas into the crowd as a response. Many were injured while five people died; demonstrations, killings, and arrests would continue for a few more days. A memorial was then erected on the spot where the first killings had taken place. A 1984 textbook introduces the language movement with the following, &quot;February 21 of 1952 was the first united expression of Bangladesh&#x27;s collective consciousness and a first bold step toward the independence movement&quot;. The language movement became a symbol for Bengali nationalism; the claim by Bengali textbooks is that &#x27;Bengali&#x27; became the primary marker of Bangladesh&#x27;s identity.

Sufia Kamal, a Bangladeshi poet, wrote the poem &quot;Our Language: The Language of Bengal&quot; in 1952, during the time of the language movement; the poem shows how strongly language played a role in the national identity of the new state.

&quot;For our language many have died,&quot;

&quot;drawn from the arms of our mother&quot;

&quot;but down the road, smeared with their blood&quot;

&quot;I hope freedom will come to this land:&quot;

&quot;the simple language of a simple people&quot;

&quot;Will meet the demands of this our land.&quot;

The independence of Bangladesh in December 1971 regarded the national identity as a regional one, rather than a religious one like Pakistan&#x27;s foundation. The new Bengali elite envisioned the society that was taking place in the delta as distinctly Bengali, where Bangladesh stood as a nation-state, a homeland to the Bengali community that had been unjustly treated in Pakistan. The main pillars of the new nation were language, a regional style, and a search for modernity.

The Bangla Academy was an institution established in the 1950s as a result of the language movement; after independence, it became a major publisher of textbooks, dictionaries, folk literature, etc. The written and the spoken language were two distinct languages, whose differences were greater than that of other languages. The language of books was distinct, and without a trace of the popular, based on Sanskrit. This fact took a turn with Tekchand Thakur&#x27;s &quot;Alarer Ghorer Dulal&quot;, which was written in the language that everyone understood. From that moment on, books began to be written in the learned and popular languages in Bangladesh.

==Controversy==

There is some dispute between the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist party, founded by Ziaur Rahman, on who declared the Independence of Bangladesh. When a different party comes to power, they change the history books of Bangladesh to either prefer Sheikh Mujibur Rahman or Ziaur Rahman.

<doc id="1241302" wikidata="Q466142" url="?curid=1241302" title="Whina Cooper">
<text>Dame Whina Cooper (born Hōhepine Te Wake; 9 December 1895 – 26 March 1994) was a New Zealand (Māori elder), who worked for many years for the rights of her people, and particularly to improve the lot of Māori women. She is remembered for leading the 1975 Māori land march from Te Hāpua to Wellington, a distance of , at the age of 79.

Her wide influence and nationally recognised activity led her to be acknowledged with awards in both the British (Imperial) and New Zealand Royal Honours Systems, and by her own people, who bestowed the title (&#x27;Mother of the Nation&#x27;) upon her. She is the subject of the 2022 film &quot;Whina&quot;.

==Early life==
Whina Cooper was born Hōhepine Te Wake, daughter of community leader and Catholic catechist Heremia Te Wake and Kare Pauro Kawatihi, of the Te Rarawa iwi, at Te Karaka, Hokianga.

From an early age, she showed an interest in her father&#x27;s role, and in history and genealogy. Her education began at Whakarapa Native School. In 1907, she attended St Joseph&#x27;s Māori Girls&#x27; College. After high school, she returned to Whakarapa (later Panguru) where her father wanted her to enter into an arranged marriage with Tureiti Te Heuheu Tukino V, leader of Ngāti Tūwharetoa. Cooper refused, and instead worked at a local co-operative store. She worked as a teacher for a brief time, at Pawarenga Native School. However, as one of only three teachers, she became frustrated, and found her time stretched between teaching and helping her own community. She left teaching in 1914 and was a housekeeper at the Catholic presbytery of Rawene for two years. She kept her Catholic Christian faith her whole life.

==Political activism==
===1914–1935: Whakarapa ===
Cooper&#x27;s first involvement in politics was in the form of a land dispute over an area of leased mudflats in around 1914. The farmer who rented the land, Bob Holland, wanted to drain the estuary for farming. This would have obstructed current use of the land by local iwi for gathering seafood and for racing horses during the drier months. Heremia challenged the lease in court, and Cooper led a group of protesters to fill in Holland&#x27;s drains. The protesters were eventually charged with trespassing, but they had stalled events long enough for Heremia to be successful, and the Marine Department withdrew the lease.

In 1916, she returned to work at the co-operative store, and around this time, met her first husband, Richard Gilbert, of Ngāti Wai. She married him on 10 May 1917, with only her parents&#x27; knowledge, which led to some unhappiness with her wider family and community, who felt they should have been consulted. After her parents died, the couple left the family home and moved to family land at Te Karaka, where they had to build their own home. By 1920 they had two children, and were able to borrow money from a local priest to purchase her father&#x27;s home and farm at Whakarapa and the local store. There she played a leading role in business and the community, including in 1923 calling a hui that led to the name of Whakarapa being changed to Panguru. Her community leadership impressed politician Sir Āpirana Ngata, who invited her to a national hui in 1932. She worked alongside him to promote Māori land-development programmes in the Hokianga. Through him, she also met William Cooper of Ngāti Kahungunu, who became her second husband after Richard Gilbert died of cancer in 1935.

===1949–1969s: Auckland===
She moved to Auckland in 1949 when her second husband, William Cooper, died. Her political activity changed from local to national. In September 1951, she was elected first president of the new Māori Women&#x27;s Welfare League &quot;which was able to improve things notably for Maori women&quot;, working on health, housing, education, and welfare.

In 1957, she stepped down as president, and the annual conference rewarded her with the title &quot;Te Whaea o te Motu&quot; (&quot;Mother of the Nation&quot;). During the 1960s, she worked on a local level around Auckland, but kept largely out of the national spotlight.

===1975: Land March===

This changed in 1975 when a coalition of Māori groups asked her to lead them in a protest against the loss of Māori land. She agreed, proposing a Hīkoi (a symbolic march) from the northern tip of the North Island to Parliament in Wellington at the other end of the island. 

During September and October 1975, the nearly 80-year-old Cooper again became nationally recognised, walking at the head of the Māori land march from Te Hāpua to Wellington, a distance of . The slogan of the march was &quot;not one more acre of Maori land&quot;; they demanded acknowledgement of property rights under the Treaty of Waitangi.

==Honours and awards==
*In the 1953 Coronation Honours, Cooper was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the Māori people.
*In the 1974 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, she was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to Māori welfare and culture.
*In the 1981 New Year Honours, Cooper was further promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the Māori people.
*In 1990, Cooper received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.
*In the 1991 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, she became the twentieth appointee to the Order of New Zealand, New Zealand&#x27;s highest civil honour.
*In 1993 she was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.

==Death and legacy==
Cooper returned to Panguru in the Hokianga in 1983 and died there, aged 98, in 1994.

Her legacy includes calling the 1923 hui that led to the name of Whakarapa being changed to Panguru.

She is remembered as a leader who helped to shape New Zealand legislation relating to Māori people, as well as helping to develop the community in Auckland. However she is most remembered for winning over the hearts of so many people when she led the 1975 land march, in both Māori and Pākehā communities.

She has also served as an inspiration to other Māori women, such as Tiahuia Abraham, who has been a member of the Māori Women&#x27;s Welfare League for 53 years.

===Memorials===
On 3 February 2020, a memorial at the Waipuna Marae was unveiled in Panguru, Hokianga, in the presence of prime minister Jacinda Ardern. The bronze statue was a sculptural representation of a famous photograph of Cooper, holding the hand of her granddaughter Irenee Cooper, as they were starting the 1975 land march. Her son, Joe Cooper, unveiled the statue. Ardern promised that her story would be included in the new school history curriculum.

===Honorific eponym===
In 2020, the tunnel boring machine that is being used to construct the twin tunnels of the City Rail Link in Auckland between Mount Eden station and Aotea station was named &quot;Dame Whina Cooper&quot;.

===Film===
Cooper is the subject of a biographical film called &quot;Whina&quot;, which was released in selected cinemas on 23 June 2022. The film was directed by James Napier Robertson and Paula Whetu Jones. Cooper was portrayed by Miriama McDowell and Rena Owen, with the former portraying an adult, and the latter an elderly, Cooper.

===Television===
Whina Cooper was the focus of the documentary, &quot;Whina, Te Whaea O Te Moto – Mother of the Nation&quot; (1992) by Bryan Bruce. Bruce also featured footage of the Whina Cooper-led Maori land march of 1975 in &quot;The Bridge&quot; (2002), a television documentary about the history of the Auckland Harbour Bridge.

<text>Paul Henry (11 April 1876 – 24 August 1958) was an Irish artist noted for depicting the West of Ireland landscape in a spare Post-Impressionist style.

==Biography==
Henry was born at 61 University Road, Belfast, Ireland, the son of the Rev Robert Mitchell Henry, a Baptist minister (who later joined the Plymouth Brethren), and Kate Ann Berry.

Henry began studying at Methodist College Belfast in 1882 where he first began drawing regularly. At the age of fifteen he moved to the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. He studied art at the Belfast School of Art before going to Paris in 1898 to study at the Académie Julian and at Whistler&#x27;s Académie Carmen.

He married the painter Grace Henry in 1903 and returned to Ireland in 1910. From then until 1919 he lived on Achill Island, where he learned to capture the peculiar interplay of light and landscape specific to the West of Ireland. In 1919 he moved to Dublin and in 1920, he was one of the founders of the Society of Dublin Painters, originally a group of ten artists. Henry designed several railway posters, some of which, notably &quot;Connemara Landscape&quot;, achieved considerable sales. He separated from his wife in 1929. His second wife was the artist Mabel Young.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Henry was Ireland&#x27;s most renowned artist, significantly shaping the popular image of the west of Ireland. Although he appears to have stopped experimenting with his technique after leaving Achill, and his range is limited, he produced a substantial body of fine images whose familiarity attests to their influence.

Henry&#x27;s use of colour was affected by his red-green colour blindness. He lost his sight during 1945 and did not regain his vision before his death.

A commemorative exhibition of Henry&#x27;s work was held at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1973 and the National Gallery of Ireland held a major exhibition of his work in 2004.

A painting by Henry was featured on an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, broadcast on 12 November 2006. The painting was given a value of approximately £40,000–60,000 by the roadshow. However, due to the buoyancy of the Irish art market at that time, it sold for €260,000 on 5 December 2006 in James Adams&#x27; and Bonhams&#x27; joint &quot;Important Irish Art&quot; sale.

He died at his home at 1 Sidmonton Square, Bray, County Wicklow, and was survived by his wife, Mabel.

<text>Patrick MacDowell (12 August 1799 – 9 December 1870) was a Belfast-born British sculptor operating through the 19th century.

==Life==
MacDowell was born in Belfast in 1799. His father died whilst he was young and the family lived in relative poverty.


From 1807 to 1811 he boarded at a school in Belfast, run by an engraver named Gordon, who encouraged his attempts at drawing, and from 1811 to 1813 he was under the tuition of a clergyman in Hampshire. 

Around 1811 he moved with his mother to Hampshire in England, where they had relatives. In 1813, aged 14 (the then standard age to begin apprenticeships), he was apprenticed to a coach-builder in London. However, his master went bankrupt and his training as a coach-builder ended abruptly. During this time he was lodging in the house of Pierre Francois Chenu, the sculptor. It is presumed that this engendered an interest in sculpture within the young MacDowell.

On the recommendation of John Constable the painter, he went to the Royal Academy Schools and he exhibited at the Academy from 1822 until his death.

He was elected a Member on 10 February 1846 and presented as his diploma work a &quot;Nymph.&quot;.

== Death ==
MacDowell died at his home in Wood Lane, Highgate, London on 9 December 1870 and was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery. His gravestone incorrectly records the year of his death as 1871, not 1870.

==Other works==
MacDowell&#x27;s works include a statue of Sir William Brown in the Great Hall of St George&#x27;s Hall, Liverpool. His life-size memorial, in marble, to the young Earl of Belfast (died 1853) showing the deceased on his deathbed attended by his mother, was in Belfast Castle Chapel. It was moved to Belfast City Hall.

A statue of Sir Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth by MacDowell stands in the centre of the Greenwich Maritime Museum.

His last major work was the &quot;Europe&quot; allegorical group at the Albert Memorial in London.

<text>Kate Maki (born Katherine Ellen Maki) is a Canadian singer-songwriter.

==Biography==
Maki is of Finnish descent. Born and raised in Sudbury, Ontario, she studied neuroscience at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia and education at Nipissing University in North Bay, Ontario. She taught special education, French and science in Ottawa, Toronto and Sudbury for several years before deciding to pursue a full-time musical career.

In 2003, Maki recorded her debut album, &quot;Confusion Unlimited&quot;, with Dave Draves at Little Bullhorn Studios in Ottawa, Ontario. The album&#x27;s blend of folk rock and alternative country earned her favourable reviews and quickly sold out its initial printing. In 2004, she returned to Little Bullhorn Studios to record her second album, &quot;The Sun Will Find Us&quot;. Both albums received Album of the Year awards at the Northern Ontario Music and Film Awards in 2004 and 2005.

In 2005, Maki, Nathan Lawr, Ryan Bishops, Ruth Minnikin and Dale Murray participated in two national concert tours, A Midautumn Night&#x27;s Dream and A Midwinter Night&#x27;s Dream, which were reportedly inspired by Bob Dylan&#x27;s Rolling Thunder Revue. The five musicians also recorded limited edition tour compilations for each tour.

Maki took a break from touring between 2006 and 2008 and returned home to Sudbury, Ontario to teach high school science.

During March Break 2007, Maki recorded her third album, &quot;On High&quot;, at Little Bullhorn Studios with Howe Gelb as producer and Dave Draves as engineer. It was released in North America on February 12, 2008, and was awarded Album of the Year at the Northern Ontario Music and Film Awards in 2009.

While touring the United States in 2008, Maki stopped at WaveLab in Tucson, Arizona for two days to record her fourth album, &quot;Two Song Wedding&quot;, which was released in January 2010.

In the fall of 2010, Maki and a fellow Canadian songwriter travelled to Paco Loco Studio in El Puerto de Santa Maria to record two country songs. &quot;Calling It Quits/Crazy Tropical Survival Guide&quot; was released as a seven-inch two-song single and digital download on March 22, 2011.

After touring Canada together in 2011 in support of their seven-inch as well as Maki&#x27;s fifth solo album, &quot;Moonshine&quot;, and Squire&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Frederick Squire Sings Shenandoah and Other Popular Hits&quot;, the duo decided to take a break from touring and settled in Copper Cliff, Ontario to start a family. Squire and Maki were married on December 22, 2012.

<text>Hannah Lee Fox (born September 29, 1969), better known as Hannah Fox is a former female boxer. She is from Las Vegas, Nevada. Her nickname is &quot;The Vegas&quot;, which made her name sound like &quot;Hannah The Vegas Fox&quot; when introduced to fans before a fight. She was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2022.

Her first professional fight came on December 26, 1997, when she beat Heidi Tide by a decision in four, in Las Vegas. On her second fight, January 23 of 1998, she got her first knockout win, finishing her fight with Teara Anne Sanders in the first round.

Fox won her next seven fights in a row, with two knockouts. Among her foes during that initial, nine fight winning streak, were Tide in a rematch, Julie Birdsell, who antagonized Fox on Fox&#x27;s first fight outside Nevada, with Fox winning an eight round decision at Biloxi, Mississippi, and the well known fighters, Diana Dutra, and Dawn George.

On January 15, 1999, she suffered her first, and only, career loss, when outpointed by Fredia Gibbs over eight rounds in Las Vegas. Fox, however, kept on the rise after this defeat: she had set her mind on one goal, and that was to become a world boxing champion.

After the loss to Gibbs came a rematch with Dutra, and Fox defeated the young hopeful, this time by a unanimous six round decision. Then, she fought Glenda Watkins, beating her by another six round decision, and becoming the IFBA&#x27;s number one ranked challenger for the IFBA&#x27;s world Jr. welterweight title.

On June 11, 1999, at Bossier City, Louisiana, she challenged Leah Mellinger for Mellinger&#x27;s world Jr. Welterweight championship. Fox became the IFBA&#x27;s world Jr. Welterweight champion by defeating Mellinger by a ten round decision.

With her dream finally accomplished, Fox retired, and has not made an attempt at a comeback.

Her boxing record was 12 wins, with only 1 loss, and 3 knockout wins.

<doc id="1241326" wikidata="Q3310872" url="?curid=1241326" title="Federation of Australia">
<text>The Federation of Australia was the process by which the six separate British self-governing colonies of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia (which also governed what is now the Northern Territory), and Western Australia agreed to unite and form the Commonwealth of Australia, establishing a system of federalism in Australia. The colonies of Fiji and New Zealand were originally part of this process, but they decided not to join the federation. Following federation, the six colonies that united to form the Commonwealth of Australia as states kept the systems of government (and the bicameral legislatures) that they had developed as separate colonies, but they also agreed to have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the Constitution of Australia came into force, on 1 January 1901, the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia.

The efforts to bring about federation in the mid-19th century were dogged by the lack of popular support for the movement. A number of conventions were held during the 1890s to develop a constitution for the Commonwealth. Sir Henry Parkes, Premier of the Colony of New South Wales, was instrumental in this process. Sir Edmund Barton, second only to Parkes in the length of his commitment to the federation cause, was the caretaker Prime Minister of Australia at the inaugural national election in March 1901. The election returned Barton as prime minister, though without a majority.

This period has lent its name to an architectural style prevalent in Australia at that time, known as Federation architecture, or Federation style.

==Early calls for federation==
As early as 1842, an anonymous article in the &quot;South Australian Magazine&quot; called for a &quot;Union of the Australasian Colonies into a Governor-Generalship.&quot;

In September 1846, the NSW Colonial Secretary Sir Edward Deas Thomson suggested federation in the New South Wales Legislative Council. The Governor of New South Wales, Sir Charles Fitzroy, then wrote to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Colonial Office suggesting a &quot;superior functionary&quot; with power to review the legislation of all the colonies. In 1853, FitzRoy was appointed as Governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, South Australia and Victoria – a pre-federation governor-general of Australia, with wide-ranging powers to intervene in inter-colonial disputes. This title was also extended to his immediate successor, William Denison.

In 1847 the Secretary of State for the Colonies Earl Grey drew up a plan for a &quot;General Assembly&quot; of the colonies. The idea was quietly dropped. However, it prompted the statesman William Wentworth to propose in the following year the establishment of &quot;a Congress from the various Colonial Legislatures&quot; to legislate on &quot;inter-colonial questions&quot;.

On 28 July 1853, a select committee formed by Wentworth to draft a new constitution for New South Wales proposed a General Assembly of the Australian Colonies. This assembly was proposed to legislate on intercolonial matters, including tariffs, railways, lighthouses, penal settlements, gold and the mail. This was the first outline of the future Australian Commonwealth to be presented in an official colonial legislative report.

On 19 August 1857, Deas Thomson moved for a NSW Parliamentary Select Committee on the question of Australian federation. The committee reported in favour of a federal assembly being established, but the government changed in the meantime, and the question was shelved.

Also in 1857, in England, William Wentworth founded the &quot;General Association for the Australian Colonies&quot;, whose object was to obtain a federal assembly for the whole of Australia. While in London, Wentworth produced a draft Bill proposing a confederation of the Australian colonies, with each colony given equal representation in an intercolonial assembly, a proposal subsequently endorsed by his association. He further proposed a &quot;permissive Act&quot; be passed by Parliament allowing the colonies of Australia or any subset of them which was not a penal settlement to federate at will. Wentworth, hoping to garner as broad support as possible, proposed a loose association of the colonies, which was criticised by Robert Lowe. The secretary of state subsequently opted not to introduce the Bill stating it would probably lead to &quot;dissension and discontent&quot;, distributing it nonetheless to the colonies for their responses. While there was in-principle support for a union of the colonies, the matter was ultimately deferred while NSW Premier Charles Cowper and Henry Parkes preferred to focus on liberalising Wentworth&#x27;s squatter-friendly constitution.

=== Federal Council of Australasia ===
A serious movement for Federation of the colonies arose in the late 1880s, a time when there was increasing nationalism amongst Australians, the great majority of whom were native-born. The idea of being Australian began to be celebrated in songs and poems. This was fostered by improvements in transport and communications, such as the establishment of a telegraph system between the colonies in 1872. The Australian colonies were also influenced by other federations that had emerged around the world, particularly the United States and Canada.

Sir Henry Parkes, then colonial secretary of New South Wales, first proposed a Federal Council body in 1867. After it was rejected by the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Duke of Buckingham, Parkes brought up the issue again in 1880, this time as the premier of New South Wales. At the conference, representatives from Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia considered a number of issues including federation, communication, Chinese immigration, vine diseases and uniform tariff rates. The Federation had the potential to ensure that throughout the continent, trade and interstate commerce would be unaffected by protectionism and measurement and transport would be standardised.

The final (and successful) push for a Federal Council came at an Intercolonial Convention in Sydney in November and December 1883. The trigger was the British rejection of Queensland&#x27;s unilateral annexation of New Guinea and the British Government wish to see a federalised Australasia. The convention was called to debate the strategies needed to counter the activities of the German and French in New Guinea and in New Hebrides. Sir Samuel Griffith, the premier of Queensland, drafted a bill to constitute the Federal Council. The conference successfully petitioned the Imperial Parliament to enact the &quot;Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885&quot;.

As a result, a Federal Council of Australasia was formed, to represent the affairs of the colonies in their relations with the South Pacific islands. New South Wales and New Zealand did not join. The self-governing colonies of Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, as well as the Crown Colonies of Western Australia and Fiji, became involved. South Australia was briefly a member between 1888 and 1890. The Federal Council had powers to legislate directly upon certain matters, and did so to effect the mutual recognition of naturalisations by colonies, to regulate labour standards in the employment of Pacific Island labour in fisheries, and to enable a legal suit to be served outside the colony in which it was issued, &quot;a power valuable in matters ranging from absconding debtors to divorce proceedings&quot;. But the Council did not have a permanent secretariat, executive powers, or any revenue of its own. Furthermore, the absence of the powerful colony of New South Wales weakened its representative value.

Nevertheless, it was the first major form of inter-colonial co-operation. It provided an opportunity for Federalists from around the country to meet and exchange ideas. The means by which the Council was established endorsed the continuing role that the Imperial Parliament would have in the development of Australia&#x27;s constitutional structure. In terms of the &quot;Federal Council of Australia Act&quot;, the Australian drafters established a number of powers dealing with their common interests which would later be replicated in the Australian Constitution, especially section 51.

=== Early opposition ===
The individual colonies, Victoria excepted, were somewhat wary of Federation. Politicians, particularly those from the smaller colonies, disliked the very idea of delegating power to a national government; they feared that any such government would inevitably be dominated by the more populous New South Wales and Victoria. Queensland, for its part, worried that the advent of race-based national legislation would restrict the importing of kanaka labourers, thereby jeopardising its sugar cane industry.

These were not the only concerns of those resistant to federation. Smaller colonies also worried about the abolition of tariffs, which would deprive them of a large proportion of their revenue, and leave their commerce at the mercy of the larger states. New South Wales, traditionally free-trade in its outlook, wanted to be satisfied that the federation&#x27;s tariff policy would not be protectionist. Victorian Premier James Service described fiscal union as &quot;the lion in the way&quot; of federation.

A further fundamental issue was how to distribute the excess customs duties from the central government to the states. For the larger colonies, there was the possibility (which never became an actuality) that they could be required to subsidise the struggling economies of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.

Even without the concerns, there was debate about the form of government that a federation would take. Experience of other federations was less than inspiring. In particular, the United States had experienced its traumatic civil war.

The nascent Australian labour movement was less than wholly committed in its support for federation. On the one hand, nationalist sentiment was strong within the labour movement and there was much support for the idea of White Australia. On the other hand, labour representatives feared that federation would distract attention from the need for social and industrial reform, and further entrench the power of the conservative forces. The federal conventions included no representatives of organised labour. In fact, the proposed federal constitution was criticised by labour representatives as being too conservative. These representatives wanted to see a federal government with more power to legislate on issues such as wages and prices. They also regarded the proposed senate as much too powerful, with the capacity to block attempts at social and political reform, much as the colonial upper houses were quite openly doing at that time.

Religious factors played a small but not trivial part in disputes over whether federation was desirable or even possible. As a general rule, pro-federation leaders were Protestants, while Catholics&#x27; enthusiasm for federation was much weaker, not least because Parkes had been militantly anti-Catholic for decades (and because the labour movement was disproportionately Catholic in its membership). For all that, many Irish could feel an attractive affinity between the cause of Home Rule in Ireland – effectively federalizing the United Kingdom – and the federation of the Australian colonies. Federationists such as Edmund Barton, with the full support of his righthand man Richard O&#x27;Connor, were careful to maintain good relations with Irish opinion.

== Early constitutional conventions ==
In the early 1890s, two meetings established the need for federation and set the framework for this to occur. An informal meeting attended by official representatives from the Australasian colonies was held in 1890. This led to the first National Australasian Convention, meeting in Sydney in 1891. New Zealand was represented at both the conference and the Convention, although its delegates indicated that it would be unlikely to join the Federation at its foundation, but it would probably be interested in doing so at a later date.

=== Australasian Federal Conference of 1890 ===
The Australasian Federal Conference of 1890 met at the instigation of Parkes. Accounts of its origin commonly commence with Lord Carrington, the Governor of New South Wales, goading the ageing Parkes at a luncheon on 15 June 1889. Parkes reportedly boasted that he &quot;could confederate these colonies in twelve months&quot;. Carrington retorted, &quot;Then why don&#x27;t you do it? It would be a glorious finish to your life.&quot; Parkes the next day wrote to the Premier of Victoria, Duncan Gillies, offering to advance the cause of Federation. Gillies&#x27;s response was predictably cool, given the reluctance of Parkes to bring New South Wales into the Federal Council. In October Parkes travelled north to Brisbane and met with Griffith and Sir Thomas McIlwraith. On the return journey, he stopped just south of the colonial border, and delivered the historic Tenterfield Oration on 24 October 1889, stating that the time had come for the colonies to consider Australian federation.

Through the latter part of 1889, the premiers and governors corresponded and agreed for an informal meeting to be called. The membership was: New South Wales, Parkes (Premier) and William McMillan (Colonial Treasurer); Victoria, Duncan Gillies (Premier) and Alfred Deakin (Chief Secretary); Queensland, Sir Samuel Griffith (Leader of the Opposition) and John Murtagh Macrossan (Colonial Secretary); South Australia, Dr. John Cockburn (Premier) and Thomas Playford (Leader of the Opposition); Tasmania, Andrew Inglis Clark (Attorney-General) and Stafford Bird (Treasurer); Western Australia, Sir James George Lee Steere (Speaker); New Zealand, Captain William Russell (Colonial Secretary) and Sir John Hall.

When the conference met at the Victorian Parliament in Melbourne on 6 February, the delegates were confronted with a scorching summer maximum temperature of in the shade. The Conference debated whether or not the time was ripe to proceed with federation.

While some of the delegates agreed it was, the smaller states were not as enthusiastic. Thomas Playford from South Australia indicated the tariff question and lack of popular support as hurdles. Similarly, Sir James Lee Steere from Western Australia and the New Zealand delegates suggested there was little support for federation in their respective colonies.
A basic question at this early assembly was how to combine federalism and responsible government. Parkes suggested the Canadian model, which federated with the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;, to be similarly adopted in Australia. However, delegates from the smaller states were not enthusiastic, with John Alexander Cockburn of South Australia seeing the Canadian model as a &quot;coercive&quot; and &quot;homogeneous National Union&quot;. Andrew Inglis Clark, a long-time admirer of American federal institutions, introduced the US Constitution as an example of the protection of States&#x27; rights. He presented it as an alternative to the Canadian model, arguing that Canada was &quot;an instance of amalgamation rather than Federation.&quot; A model closer to that of the United States was endorsed, with states able to act completely independently apart from those limited powers transferred to the federal government and where each state would be represented equally in a strong second chamber—the Senate.

=== Clark&#x27;s draft constitution ===
Andrew Inglis Clark had given considerable thought towards a suitable constitution for Australia. In May 1890, he travelled to London to conduct an appeal on behalf of the Government of Tasmania before the Privy Council. During this trip, he began writing a draft constitution, taking the main provisions of the British North America Act, 1867 and its supplements up through 1890, the US Constitution, the Federal Council of Australasia Act, and various Australian colonial constitutions. Clark returned from London by way of Boston, Massachusetts, where he held discussions about his draft with Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., and Moncure Conway among others.

Clark&#x27;s draft introduced the nomenclature and form which was subsequently adopted:

* The Australian Federation is described as the Commonwealth of Australia
* There are three separate and equal branches – the Parliament, the Executive, and the Judicature.
* The Legislature consists of a House of Representatives and a Senate
* It specified the separation of powers and the division of powers between the Federal and State governments.

Upon his return to Hobart in early November 1890, with the technical aid of W. O. Wise, the Tasmanian Parliamentary Draftsman, Clark completed the final form of the Draft Constitution and had a number of copies printed. In February 1891, Clark circulated copies of his draft to Parkes, Barton and probably Playford as well. This draft was always intended to be a private working document, and was never published.

=== The National Australasian Convention of 1891 ===
The Parliament proposed at the Convention of 1891 was to adopt the nomenclature of the United States Congress; a House of Representatives and a Senate. The House of Representatives was to be elected by districts drawn up on the basis of their population, while in the Senate there was to be equal representation for each &quot;province&quot;. This American model was mixed with the Westminster system by which the Prime Minister and other ministers would be appointed by the representative of the British Crown from among the members of the political party holding a majority in the lower House.

Griffith identified with great clarity at the Sydney Convention perhaps the greatest problem of all: how to structure the relationship between the lower and upper houses within the Federal Parliament. The main division of opinion centred on the contention of Alfred Deakin, that the lower house must be supreme, as opposed to the views of Barton, John Cockburn and others, that a strong Senate with co-ordinate powers was essential. Griffith himself recommended that the doctrine of responsible government should be left open, or substantially modified to accord with the Federal structure.

Over the Easter weekend in 1891, Griffith edited Clark&#x27;s draft aboard the Queensland Government&#x27;s steam yacht &quot;Lucinda&quot;. (Clark was not present, as he was ill with influenza in Sydney). Griffith&#x27;s draft Constitution was submitted to colonial parliaments but it lapsed in New South Wales, after which the other colonies were unwilling to proceed.

=== Griffith or Clark? ===
The importance of the draft Constitution of 1891 was recognised by John La Nauze when he flatly declared that &quot;The draft of 1891 is the Constitution of 1900, not its father or grandfather.&quot; In the twenty-first century, however, a lively debate has sprung up as to whether the principal credit for this draft belongs to Queensland&#x27;s Sir Samuel Griffith or Tasmania&#x27;s Andrew Inglis Clark. The debate began with the publication of Peter Botsman&#x27;s &quot;The Great Constitutional Swindle: A Citizen&#x27;s Guide to the Australian Constitution&quot; in 2000, and a biography of &quot;Andrew Inglis Clark&quot; by F.M. Neasey and L.J. Neasey published by the University of Tasmania Law Press in 2001.

The traditional view attached almost sole responsibility for the 1891 draft to Griffith. Quick and Garran, for instance, state curtly that Griffith &quot;had the chief hand in the actual drafting of the Bill&quot;. Given that the authors of this highly respected work were themselves active members of the federal movement, it may be presumed that this view representsif not the complete truththen, at least, the consensus opinion among Australia&#x27;s &quot;founding fathers&quot;.

In his 1969 entry on &quot;Clark, Andrew Inglis (1848–1907)&quot; for the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot;, Henry Reynolds offers a more nuanced view: 
Clark&#x27;s supporters are quick to point out that 86 Sections (out of a total of 128) of the final Australian Constitution are recognisable in Clark&#x27;s draft, and that &quot;only eight of Inglis Clark&#x27;s ninety-six clauses failed to find their way into the final Australian Constitution&quot;; but these are potentially misleading statistics. As Professor John Williams has pointed out:

As to who was responsible for the actual detailed drafting, as distinct from the broad structure and framework of the 1891 draft, John Williams (for one) is in no doubt:
== Australasian Federal Convention of 1897–98 ==
The apparent enthusiasm of 1891 rapidly ebbed in the face of opposition from Henry Parkes&#x27; rival, George Reid, and the sudden advent of the Labor Party in NSW, which commonly dismissed federation as a &quot;fad&quot;. The subsequent revival of the federal movement owed much to the growth of federal leagues outside of capital cities, and, in Victoria, the Australian Natives&#x27; Association. The Border Federation League of Corowa held a conference in 1893 which was to prove of considerable significance, and a &quot;People&#x27;s Convention&quot; in Bathurst in 1896 underlined the cautious conversion of George Reid to the federal cause. At the close of the Corowa Conference John Quick had advanced a scheme of a popularly elected convention, tasked to prepare a constitution, which would then be put to a referendum in each colony. Winning the support of George Reid, premier of NSW from 1894, the Quick scheme was approved by all premiers in 1895. (Quick and Robert Garran later published &quot;The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth&quot; in 1901, which is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative works on the Australian Constitution.) In March 1897 took place the Australasian Federal Convention Elections, and several weeks later the delegates gathered for the Convention&#x27;s first session in Adelaide, later meeting in Sydney, and finally in Melbourne in March 1898. After the Adelaide meeting, the colonial parliaments took the opportunity to debate the emerging bill and to suggest changes. The basic principles of the 1891 draft constitution were adopted, modified by a consensus for more democracy in the constitutional structure. It was agreed that the Senate should be chosen, directly, by popular vote, rather than appointed by state governments.

On other matters there was considerable disagreement. State interests inevitably fractured the unity of delegates in matters involving rivers and railways, producing legalistic compromises. And they had few guides, at a conceptual level, to what they were doing. Deakin greatly praised James Bryce&#x27;s appreciation of American federalism, &quot;The American Commonwealth&quot;. And Barton cited the analysis of federation of Bryce&#x27;s Oxford colleagues, E.A. Freeman and A.V. Dicey. But neither of these two writers could be said to be actual advocates of Federation. For delegates less given to reading (or citing) authors, the great model of plural governance would always be the British Empire, which was not a federation.

The Australasian Federal Convention dissolved on 17 March 1898 having adopted a bill &quot;To Constitute the Commonwealth of Australia.&quot;

== Federation referendums ==
Referendums on the proposed constitution were held in four of the colonies in June 1898. There were majority votes in all four, however, the enabling legislation in New South Wales required the support of at least 80,000 voters for passage, equivalent to about half of enrolled voters, and this number was not reached. A meeting of the colonial premiers in early 1899 agreed to a number of amendments to make the constitution more acceptable to New South Wales. These included the limiting Braddon Clause, which guaranteed the states 75 percent of customs revenue, to just ten years of operation; requiring that the new federal capital would be located in New South Wales, but at least a hundred miles (160 km) distant from Sydney; and, in the circumstances of a double dissolution, reducing from six tenths to one half the requisite majority to legislate of a subsequent joint meeting of Senate and House. In June 1899, referendums on the revised constitution were held again in all the colonies except for Western Australia, where the vote was not held until the following year. The majority vote was yes in all the colonies.

===1898 referendums===

===1899 and 1900 referendums===

The bill as accepted by the colonies (except Western Australia, which voted after the act was passed by the British parliament) was sent to Britain to be enacted as an act passed by British Parliament.

== Federal Constitution ==

The &quot;Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900&quot; (Imp) was passed on 5 July 1900 and given royal assent by Queen Victoria on 9 July 1900. It was proclaimed on 1 January 1901 in Centennial Park, Sydney. Sir Edmund Barton was sworn in as the interim Prime Minister, leading an interim Federal ministry of nine members.

The new constitution established a bicameral Parliament, containing a Senate and a House of Representatives. The office of governor-general was established as the Queen&#x27;s representative; initially, as a representative of the British Government.

The Constitution also provided for the establishment of a High Court, and divided the powers of government between the states and the new Commonwealth government. The states retained their own parliaments, along with the majority of existing powers, but the federal government would be responsible of issues defence, immigration, quarantine, customs, banking and coinage, among other powers.

== The economic consequences of federation ==
Australian federation entailed the creation of both a customs and a fiscal union. With respect to the customs union, tariffs were abolished on interstate trade (although this process occurred on a phased basis in Western Australia), while all of the colonies adopted the Commonwealth&#x27;s common external tariff schedule in October 1901. The first federal (Commonwealth) was widely regarded as protectionist; indeed, with respect to imports from outside of Australia, the average tariff increased relative to the average of the individual colonies&#x27; average tariffs prior to federation, according to estimates produced by Melbourne economist Peter Lloyd. Nevertheless, the welfare-enhancing effect of the elimination of tariffs on interstate trade dominated the welfare-reducing effect of higher tariffs on overseas imports, such that the net static welfare gain from Australian federation was actually positive and estimated to have been 0.17% of GDP. With respect to the fiscal union, there was a harmonisation of excise duties at approximately the mid-level of the colonial excise duties.

==Landmarks named after Federation==

The significance of Federation for Australia is such that a number of landmarks, natural and man-made, have been named after it. These include:

* Federal Highway, between Goulburn, New South Wales and Canberra
* Federation Creek, near Croydon, Queensland
* Federation Peak, Tasmania
* Federation Range, on the Royston River, about east-northeast of Melbourne, Victoria
* Federation Square, Melbourne, Victoria
* Federation Trail, Melbourne, Victoria
* Federation University, Ballarat, Victoria

<doc id="1241331" wikidata="Q2269714" url="?curid=1241331" title="Longear sunfish">
<text>The longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis) is a freshwater fish in the sunfish family, Centrarchidae, of order Centrarchiformes. It is native to the area of eastern North America stretching from the Great Lakes down to northeastern Mexico. The longear sunfish reaches a maximum recorded length of about , with a maximum recorded weight of . Most do not live beyond six years. The longear sunfish is quite colorful, with an olive to rusty-brown back, bright orange belly and vermiculate blue-green bars on the sides of its head, the latter two features most pronounced in breeding males. A unique characteristic of longear sunfish is their elongated operculum flap, giving an appearance of a &quot;long ear&quot;. It is black and often has a white margin. The pectoral fin is relatively short and would not reach the snout if it were reflected anteriorly. In breeding males, iridescent blue spots develop on the dorsum and sides and the fin membranes turn orange in all fins except the ventral ones, which may be blue to black, and the pectoral ones. &quot;Lepomis megalotis&quot; can be distinguished from closely related dollar sunfish &quot;L. marginatus&quot; by a greater number of cheek scale rows, by having one to two additional pectoral fin rays and by the slope of the opercular flap, which is distinctly upward in &quot;L. marginatus&quot; but is closer to horizontal in males of &quot;L. megalotis&quot;, although female and subadult &quot;L. megalotis&quot; may have upward slanting opercular flaps.

The species prefers densely vegetated, shallow waters in lakes, ponds, and sluggish streams. Its diet can include insects, aquatic invertebrates, and small fish. Avoiding strong currents, longear sunfish are usually present in small to moderate flowing streams, rivers, and reservoirs. The genus &quot;Lepomis&quot; has a well-characterized mating behavior where parental care is done by the male. The male makes and defends the nest, and fans the eggs to remove silt and other debris until the larvae hatch. Some longear females produce 4,000 eggs. They spawn in groups but do not form large colonies.

Longear sunfish are better at getting food in moving waters than still waters; this may explain why they are more abundant in streams than lakes. For the most part, longear sunfish are active during the day and inactive at night. There are very few conservation acts currently being performed in order to maintain the distribution and abundance of this species.

==Geographic distribution==

Longear sunfish are found in North America, primarily in the Mississippi and Great Lakes regions. Longear sunfish are mostly found in freshwater areas west of the Appalachian Mountains. Some Lepomis populations are located as far north and west as southern Quebec and Minnesota. The species has also been spotted in places as far south and west as central Mexico and New Mexico. The species has been introduced to stream ecosystems along the eastern coast of the United States. The distribution of the longear sunfish throughout North America has not been affected since the species has been followed. This may be due to the species&#x27; ability to travel throughout large bodies of water, thus avoiding dams and man-made interferences along smaller streams. They are also able to occupy different body of water types, thus making them more resilient to a decrease in their range distribution.

==Ecology==
Longear sunfish feed more extensively near the surface of the water than other sunfish species. &quot;Lepomis megalotis&quot; is mostly a carnivorous fish that eats aquatic insects, small crustaceans, fish eggs, young bass, and even young sunfish. They have also been observed eating dragonflies and other insects which travel over the surface of the water. Other observed prey have been detritus, gnat larvae, snails, day flies and leeches. The diets of adult longear (longer than 102 mm) are composed of terrestrial insects (37%), fish (31%), aquatic insects (21%), and fish eggs (7%). Largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and wading birds are all natural predators to the longear sunfish. Smaller species of longear can be preyed on by larger sunfish populations. Sunfish are an important link in the food chain. They act as both predator and prey within their ecosystems. Other sunfish species and larger predatory fishes compete with the longear for food and resources.

Longear sunfish, like additional members of the family Centrarchidae, are freshwater fish. They prefer streams with a firm clay bottom or gravel with clear waters and they typically stay nearby aquatic vegetation. Although more abundant near the sources of streams, sunfish can be found in water sources of all sizes and are also found in lakes. Longear sunfish usually reside in shallower, warmer headwaters of streams with a steady flow. They spend most of their time near aquatic vegetation, or other forms of cover such as roots, brush piles, and undercut banks. This allows for them to hide from potential predators. Sunfish species are especially intolerant to turbid waters. Human-induced changes to stream ecosystems could potentially disrupt the sunfish distribution. Destruction of aquatic vegetation from human runoff could destroy aquatic plants that are essential for the protection and cover of this species against predators. Chemical runoff into large rivers could also disturb the pH of the longear&#x27;s natural ecosystem.

==Life history==
Longear sunfish tend to breed during the late spring and early summer (late May to late August). During breeding seasons they are generally found in shallower, warmer waters near the sources of streams which have pools. Like most other members of &quot;Lepomis&quot;, longear sunfish are colonial nesters. Male longear sunfish build the nests without assistance from the females. Preferred substrate for nesting is gravel, if available, but they will build in sand or hard mud if necessary. A male longear will guard the nest territory during all phases of reproduction. The clutch size can be anywhere from 140 to 2800 eggs per reproductive cycle. After hatching, it only takes the longear sunfish 2–3 years to reach sexual maturity. The average life-span of the &quot;Lepomis megalotis&quot; in the wild is usually 4–6 years, but there have been cases where individuals have lived up to 9 years. Longear sunfish cannot tolerate cloudy or mucky water. Throughout the 20th century their populations have been reduced in areas where their native streams have suffered increased cloudiness. This cloudiness could potentially be a result of human induced erosion for agriculture or industry purposes. Increased human disturbance along streams and rivers could continue to increase the reduction of longear populations due to the murkiness of rivers and streams.

==Relationship with humans==
===Current management===
Longear sunfish are not currently endangered in any of their native habitats. They are not listed federally or internationally as threatened or endangered, but efforts are still being conducted in order to protect the species. Small conservation actions are taking place all over the US. Control of non-point source pollution from urbanization and agricultural practices is needed for this species, which is intolerant of turbidity. Habitat degradation and loss from shoreline and watershed agriculture threatens this species which prefers clear, shallow streams with aquatic vegetation. Sedimentation and agricultural runoff also threatens this species which is believed to have been lost from many locations because of the effects of soil erosion. The longear sunfish is not in danger of overfishing, because it is not considered a sport fish, and because the sunfish is not especially good for eating. The longear sunfish is currently threatened in states such as Wisconsin and New York. Refuge areas in these two states are being created along lakes and streams in order to protect the few, disjunct locations where this species live. Since this species has a fairly large distribution nationally and its abundance is still quite high, there are not many conservation groups taking serious action in preserving this species. The longear sunfish tends to do well in rivers and streams that do not undergo much disturbance. If man-made disturbances continue to disrupt shorelines then agencies may begin to see an increased reduction in the &quot;Lepomis megalotis&quot; abundance nationwide.

<text>Acolon is a German wine grape variety, a cross between Blauer Lemberger (Blaufränkisch) and Dornfelder. 

It was created in 1971 at the &quot;Staatliche Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt für Wein- und Obstbau&quot; in Weinsberg (nr. Württemberg), Germany. The variety was officially recognised in 2002. It ripens early and produces a very color-intensive wine with mild tannins, resembling Lemberger. Currently it is growing experimentally on 1.35 square kilometres. Since 1981 it has often been used as a partner in creating new genetically diverse varieties.

<doc id="1241344" wikidata="Q198468" url="?curid=1241344" title="Zigzag transformer">
<text>A zigzag transformer winding is a special-purpose transformer winding with a zigzag or &quot;interconnected star&quot; connection, such that each output is the vector sum of two (2) phases offset by 120°. It is used as a grounding transformer, creating a missing neutral connection from an ungrounded 3-phase system to permit the grounding of that neutral to an earth reference point; to perform harmonic mitigation, as they can suppress triplet (3rd, 9th, 15th, 21st, etc.) harmonic currents; to supply 3-phase power as an autotransformer (serving as the primary and secondary with no isolated circuits); and to supply non-standard, phase-shifted, 3-phase power.


Nine-winding, three-phase transformers typically have three primaries and six identical secondary windings, which can be used in zigzag winding connection as pictured. 

A conventional six-winding, grounding transformer or zigzag bank,with the same winding and core quantity as a conventional three-phase transformer, can also be used in zigzag winding connection.

In all cases the first coil on each zigzag winding core is connected contrariwise to the second coil on the next core. The second coils are then all tied together to form the neutral, and the phases are connected to the primary coils. Each phase, therefore, couples with each other phase, and the voltages cancel out. As such, there would be negligible current through the neutral point, as the Zig-Zag has a high positive and negative sequence impedance, with a low zero-sequence impedance which can be tied to ground. 

Each of the three &quot;limbs&quot; are split into two sections. The two halves of each limb have an equal number of turns and are wound in opposite directions. With the neutral grounded, during a phase-to-ground short fault, a third of the current returns to the fault current, and the remainder must go through two of the three phases when used to derive a grounding point from a delta source.

If one or more phases fault to earth, the voltage applied to each phase of the transformer is no longer in balance; fluxes in the windings no longer oppose. (Using symmetrical components, this is &quot;I&quot;a0 = &quot;I&quot;b0 = &quot;I&quot;c0.) Zero-sequence (earth fault) current exists between the transformer’s neutral to the faulting phase. The purpose of a zigzag transformer in this application is to provide a return path for earth faults on delta-connected systems. With negligible current in the neutral under normal conditions, an undersized (unable to carry a continuous fault load) transformer may be used only as short-time rating is required, provided the defective load will be automatically disconnected in a fault condition. The transformer&#x27;s impedance should not be too low for desired maximum fault current. Impedance can be added after the secondaries are summed to limit maximum fault currents (the 3&quot;I&quot;o path).

A combination of Y (wye or star), delta, and zigzag windings may be used to achieve a vector phase shift. For example, an electrical network may have a transmission network of 110 kV/33 kV star/star transformers, with 33 kV/11 kV delta/star for the high voltage distribution network. If a transformation is required directly between the 110 kV/11 kV network an option is to use a 110 kV/11 kV star/delta transformer. The problem is that the 11 kV delta no longer has an earth reference point. Installing a zigzag transformer near the secondary side of the 110 kV/11 kV transformer provides the required earth reference point.

== Applications ==
Zigzag transformers are often required by utilities when connecting three-phase inverters (usually for renewable energy) to the grid to provide a stable neutral voltage and prevent excessive phase-to-ground voltages. This also protects the switching devices inside the inverters, which are usually insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs).

<text>Classicnl (formerly known as Classic FM) is a classical music radio station in the Netherlands, which at one time broadcast on FM, but is now available nationally on DAB+, cable and internationally on the Internet. The station is owned by the Bakker Oosterbeek Beheer BV which acquired the station from Telegraaf Media Groep which owned the radio station from 2006 until November 2017. The radio station was known as Classic FM from 1994 until October 1st, 2019. Between 1994 and 1997, the format was almost identical to the Classic FM (UK) station, including the jingles, but it featured Dutch presentation . It currently transmits classical music 24 hours a day with no presenters. 

==History==
At the end of January 1994, there was a reallocation of FM terrestrial frequencies. As part of this process, there was exactly one frequency package planned for jazz and classical music. The preference of the ministry of welfare, public health and culture (Ministerie van Welzijn, Volksgezondheid en Cultuur) was to allocate this package to EuroJazz (later called Jazz Radio), but this station was not able to pay for the package. As Classic FM from the UK also bid on the frequency package, after negotiations with the ministry, the package was sold to this station on the condition that 40% of broadcast time would be jazz. As a result, on April 30th, 1994, the Dutch station Classic FM was founded and broadcasts commenced.

In 1997, following a complaint from Sky Radio and Radio 538, the court lifted the broadcast obligation for jazz music on this frequency. Shortly after this verdict, Sky Radio bought the station and since then only light classical music can be heard on Classic FM, which resulted in a significant rise in listening numbers. On April 1st, 2000, the ailing competitor Concertradio was incorporated into Classic FM, making Classic FM the only classical, private radio station in the Netherlands.

During the next frequency redistribution in 2003, Classic FM did not obtain the frequency package for classical music, because the parent company Sky Radio Group already owned the maximum of two radio stations (Sky Radio and Radio Veronica). The slot for classical music was left unassigned, to be picked up later that year by Arrow 90.7 FM (later known as SubLime FM). As a consequence, Classicnl could only be received through cable, satellite, DAB+, and internet.

Nevertheless, in 2009, Classic FM celebrated a fifteenth anniversary special broadcasts, a CD release and a sold-out concert in the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam. In 2013, there were significant changes that led to an increased importance of the spoken word, following a collaboration with De Telegraaf, which edited morning shows and provided special features in the evenings. These features included travel programs, discussions of movies with Bart van Leeuwen, which later developed into a daily show with Michael Pilarczyk.

In November 2017, investor Ids Bakker of Bakker Oosterbeek Beheer acquired the station from Telegraaf Media Group and decided to discontinue broadcasting on the DAB+ frequency, because it was barely used. Bakker Oosterbeek Beheer also owns labels for classical and jazz music under the name Challenge Records and operates classical streaming services under the name MeloMe.

Between July and August 2018, Classic FM had a radio market share of 1.3% (the state financed classical music radio station Radio 4 had 2.1%).

In October 2019, Bakker Oosterbeek Beheer decided to terminate the 1994 license agreement with the owners of Classic FM (UK) - British Global Media &amp; Entertainment - and to rename the station to Classicnl, because it had not used an FM frequency since 2003. Both agreed that the Classic FM brand cannot be used in the Netherlands in the coming years.

The station was commissioned to attract a younger audience by playing shorter pieces of classical music during the day and complete classical works at night. In addition to cable TV and Internet, the station returned to DAB+.

<text>HMS &quot;Herald&quot; was a &quot;Hecla&quot;-class ocean survey ship that served with the Royal Navy during both the Falklands War and Gulf War.

==Design and construction==
The &quot;Hecla&quot;-class were designed as combined hydrographic and oceanographic survey ships, built to merchant ship standards and of similar design to . &quot;Herald&quot; was the fourth ship of the class and was built to an improved design to the three earlier &quot;Hecla&quot;s. She was laid down at the Robb Caledon&#x27;s Leith shipyard on 9 November 1971, was launched on 4 October 1973 and completed on 31 October 1974. She had the Pennant number A138.

&quot;Herald&quot; was long, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. She had diesel-electric propulsion, with three Paxman Ventura 12-cylinder diesel engines rated at powering two electric motors, rated at a total of and driving one propeller shaft, giving a speed of . She had a range of at a speed of . The ship had a complement of 128 officers and other ranks.

==Operational history==
In January 1979, &quot;Herald&quot;, along with sister ship and the smaller survey ships and , was carrying out survey operations off the coast of Iran when she was diverted to pick up about 60 British and American dependents from the port of Bandar Abbas in the wake of the Iranian Revolution.

During the Falklands War, &quot;Herald&quot; served as a Red Cross ship, ferrying casualties from San Carlos to Montevideo. During 1983 she served as a South Atlantic Guardship.

Following the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, &quot;Herald&quot; was deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean as a support ship for the minehunters of the 3rd Mine Countermeasures Squadron. She continued to support the squadron after it moved to the Gulf, and was still on station when the Gulf War air campaign began in January 1991, but was relieved by sister ship .

In 1998 she located the wreck of HMS Russell, off Malta. The ship&#x27;s pennant number changed to H 138 in 1998.

In December 2000, &quot;Herald&quot; answered a Mayday call and took part in a joint operation with the Royal Air Force to rescue the crew of the Cypriot ferry &quot;Royal Prince&quot;. The 35-metre ship sank in rough seas, but the crew were rescued by a RAF helicopter from RAF Akrotiri and landed on HMS &quot;Herald&quot;.

==Decommissioning==

&quot;Herald&quot; was paid off on 12 April 2001 and decommissioned on 31 May 2001, having been replaced by the two new survey vessels of the &quot;Echo&quot; class, and .

After decommissioning, Herald joined her sister in Waterford after a brief re-fit in Cork dockyard. She was renamed &quot;Somerville&quot; after Admiral James Somerville and was used for a hydrographic survey in Irish waters. The ship was sold in 2004 to Indian breakers and beached on 18 June of that year.

==Postage stamps==
&quot;Herald&quot; appears on two stamps with Prince Andrew, Duke of York, issued by Saint Helena.

<doc id="1241374" wikidata="Q1303735" url="?curid=1241374" title="Survey vessel">
<text>A survey vessel is any type of ship or boat that is used for underwater surveys, usually to collect data for mapping or planning underwater construction or mineral extraction. It is a type of research vessel, and may be designed for the purpose, modified for the purpose or temporarily put into the service as a vessel of opportunity, and may be crewed, remotely operated, or autonomous. The size and equipment vary to suit the task and availability.

==Role==
The task of survey vessels is to map the bottom, and measure the characteristics of the benthic zone, full water column, and surface for the purpose of:
* hydrography, the measurement and description of the physical features of oceans and other natural bodies of water, and the prediction of their change over time, for the primary purpose of safety of navigation and in support of other activities associated with those bodies of water,
* general oceanography, the scientific study of the oceans,
* mapping of marine habitats as part of the process of assessing the state of the ecology,
* measurement of environmental impact of natural and anthropogenic changes,
* planning of marine salvage, the process of recovering a ship and its cargo after a shipwreck or other maritime casualty,
* dredging, the excavation of material from underwater, to recover materials or to alter the bottom profile, usually for navigational of construction purposes,
* underwater construction, which is industrial construction in an underwater environment,
* coastal engineering, the branch of civil engineering concerned with construction at or near the coast, and the development of the coast itself,
* maritime archaeology, the study of human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers through the study of associated physical remains,
* underwater mining and extraction of petroleum.

==Survey equipment==
Typically, modern survey vessels are equipped with one or more of the following equipment:
* Satellite navigation to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning,
* Single beam sonar for the measurement of underwater physical and biological components,
* Multibeam sonar to accurately and efficiently map the seabed
* Side-scan sonar to efficiently create relief images of large areas of the sea floor.
* Towed magnetometer for measuring the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, in geophysical surveys, to detect magnetic anomalies,
* Reflection seismology equipment for subsurface profiling. Seismic sources include air guns, sparkers and boomers.
* Bottom sampling equipment such as Van Veen grab sampler, Box corer, Epibenthic sled or other core sampling equipment.
* CTD sondes to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and pressure of seawater
* Inertial measurement unit

==Unmanned and autonomous survey vessels==
Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs; also known as unmanned surface vessels or in some cases autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), uncrewed surface vessels, or colloquially, drone ships) are boats or ships that operate on the surface of the water without a crew. USVs operate with various levels of autonomy, from simple remote control, to autonomous COLREGs compliant navigation.

An autonomous survey vessel is an unmanned vessel fitted with survey equipment and capable of operating without human supervision while performing survey work, either uploading the data in real time, or at pre-programmed stages, or on a remote command. Autonomous underwater vehicles set up for survey work are a subclass of autonomous survey vessels that operate underwater. unmanned survey vessels are usually relatively small and therefore economical to acquire and operate, and can be sent to areas too hazardous for a larger or crewed vessel, as well as for extensive and time-consuming but routine surveys.

USVs are valuable in oceanography, as they are more capable than moored or drifting weather buoys, but far cheaper than the equivalent weather ships and research vessels, and more flexible than commercial-ship contributions, and, with solar cells to power their electronics, can have months of marine persistence. Powered USVs are a powerful tool for use in hydrographic survey. Using a small USV in parallel to traditional survey vessels as a &#x27;force-multiplier&#x27; can double survey coverage and reduce time on-site.

<text>Daniel Band is a Canadian Christian metal group formed in 1979 in Toronto. They played in the contemporary Christian music industry with a sound that ranged from hard rock to heavy metal.

==History==
The group originated in 1979 in suburban Toronto, Ontario, and were based out of a Brethren Assembly in Scarborough, Ontario called Bendale Bible Chapel. In its basement, the chapel held a weekly coffeehouse, The One Way Inn, that featured Christian rock groups.

The band placed as a top three finalist in the 1982 &quot;Homegrown concert&quot; sponsored by Toronto radio station Q107, and played at the El Mocambo with the champion, Oliver Heavyside, and runner-up, The Cameo Blues Band, both longtime professional bar bands on the Toronto scene.

Their first album, &quot;On Rock&quot; (1982), offered a progressive rock sound that was typical of the era, in the tradition of April Wine and Boston, but with a harder edge. The solid rock guitar and high register vocals reminded fans of the Canadian rock group Rush. Their sound grew heavier with &quot;Straight Ahead&quot; (1983), laying down classic rock tracks in the vein of the Canadian rock group Triumph with then current era elements of Scorpions, Iron Maiden, and The Police. With their third album &quot;Run from the Darkness&quot; (1984) more prominent keyboards were added to the guitars with a sound that was closer to Canadian rock group Loverboy. As such as a heavy metal act it came with all the trappings. This was their spandex and studded dog collar stage. Their fourth album &quot;Rise Up&quot; was their heaviest metal oriented album but did contain the ballad &quot;Right Heart&quot; reminiscent of their first album&#x27;s melodic &quot;Spiritual Game&quot;.

The band has never officially broken up, although a &quot;farewell concert&quot; was held in Toronto in April 1988, and its members have been involved with various projects in Churches, including Bendale, and Schools where the members now live. Tony Rossi released a blues based album on R.E.X. Records in 1990. Dan McCabe was involved with a band called Dreamer which released one album in 1991 titled &quot;Full Metal Racket&quot;, released a solo CD and played with his older children in a band called Nine-O-Five.

In 2000, Daniel Band played at the Cornerstone Festival in Illinois where the listed &quot;Live at Cornerstone CD&quot; was recorded.

In November 2006, Daniel Band was featured as the opening group for Audio Adrenaline&#x27;s farewell tour concert in Toronto, along with Geoff Moore. Earlier in the year, there were two appearances in Sarnia, including an August festival that also saw a reunion of a local (Arkona, Ontario) group named &quot;Elim Hall&quot;, who were contemporaries of Daniel Band in the mid-1980s, and Glenn Kaiser Band (featuring two members of Resurrection Band).

In 2007, the band played at a May celebration of the One Way Inn&#x27;s (now a drop-in) 35th Anniversary and the 50th Anniversary of Bendale Bible Chapel, and &quot;Freedom Festival Canada&quot; in Oro-Medonte, Ontario during August. They also played a show in Ajax in February 2009 with Glenn Kaiser opening, and in May 2009, again at Bendale. In July 2010, the band travelled to Chibougamau, Quebec.

In October 2011, the band was awarded the GMA Canada Lifetime Achievement Award recognizing their pioneering influence on Christian rock. Earlier in the year, they played with X-Sinner over a Spring weekend in Southern Ontario (at Toronto&#x27;s El Mocambo, St. Catharines, Ottawa, and Kitchener).

<text>Leeds Girls&#x27; High School (LGHS) was an independent, selective, fee-paying school for girls aged 3–18 founded in 1876 in Headingley, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It merged with Leeds Grammar School in 2008 to form The Grammar School at Leeds.

==History==

LGHS was founded in 1876, at a time when female education was limited but expanding. Frances Lupton and other members of the Ladies’ Honorary Council of the Yorkshire Board of Education decided that campaigning for access to the universities was of little use without better all-round education for girls, equivalent to what boys received at a traditional academic grammar school. Established interests prevented the use of existing charitable funds, so Lupton and her colleagues created a new way forward: a joint stock company.

The school motto was &quot;Age Quod Agis&quot;, which means &quot;do what you do&quot;. While seemingly tautological at first glance, it is in fact a corruption of the Biblical exhortation, &quot;whatsoever thy turn thy hand to, do it with all thy might&quot;. The pupils were divided into four houses, named after the four patron saints of the United Kingdom: Andrew, David, George and Patrick. Girls were placed into the houses that their families had been in before them. There were various house competitions throughout the year, mainly sports and arts orientated, the main one being the house music competition during the spring term.

From its earliest years, the school catered for female boarders.

Although initially only operating as a high school for girls age over 13, in time, the school would have three sections situated in the western suburbs of Headingley:
*Infant School (Rose Court): 3- to 7-year-olds
*Junior School (Ford House): 7- to 11-year-olds
*Senior School: 11- to 18-year-olds
The Infant School (Rose Court) was situated on the large Senior School site on Headingley Lane, while the Junior School (Ford House) operated down the road in a converted mansion house. The Senior School building was built in the early 1900s, and efforts are currently being made to have the building listed. The fine oak wood panelling in the Assembly Hall detailed where Old Girls went to university on completion of their education at LGHS. The furniture within the Senior School Library was designed by Robert Thompson (The Mouseman), but was sold when the school moved to Alwoodley Gates (the Leeds Grammar School site).

In 2004 LGHS was the highest performing school within the Leeds LEA area, achieving top results at both GCSE and A Level.

==Merger with Leeds Grammar School==
In 2005 LGHS merged with Leeds Grammar School to form the Grammar School at Leeds (GSAL). The merged school administration took over LGHS in August 2005, however the schools did not physically merge until September 2008. At that time the Junior School (ages 7–11) and Senior School (ages 11–18) moved to Alwoodley Gates. Classes for girls and boys between the ages of 11 and 16 remain segregated, but all extracurricular activities are mixed. The Infant School moved to the Ford House building next to a new nursery school, currently operating as GSAL&#x27;S Rose Court Nursery and Pre-Prep.

The school building was used as a filming location for the fictional St Matthews&#x27; Hospital in the new ITV medical drama &quot;Monroe&quot;, which was scheduled for broadcast in 2011.

Garrod was the daughter of the physician Sir Archibald Garrod and Laura Elizabeth Smith, daughter of the surgeon Sir Thomas Smith, 1st Baronet. She was born in Chandos Street, London, and was educated at home. Her first teacher was Isabel Fry as governess. Garrod recalled Fry teaching her, at age nine, in Harley Street with the daughter of Walter Jessop. She later attended Birklands School in St Albans.

Pamela Jane Smith writes of Garrod as follows:
&quot;Garrod was a solid member of Britain&#x27;s intellectual aristocracy. Her father, Sir Archibald Garrod, had been Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford and is regarded as the founder of biochemical genetics; her grandfather was Sir Alfred Garrod of King&#x27;s College Hospital, Physician Extraordinary to Queen Victoria and a leading authority on rheumatic diseases.&quot;

Garrod entered Newnham College, Cambridge in 1913, where she read ancient and classical history before archaeology was available as a subject, completing the course in 1916. By the time of her graduation in 1916 she had lost two brothers, Lt Alfred Noel Garrod and Lt Thomas Martin Garrod. Both were killed in action in WW I. Her third brother, Lt Basil Rahere died in France from Spanish influenza prior to demobilisation. It is rumoured that she lost her fiancé. She volunteered with the Catholic Women&#x27;s League until 1919. She subsequently travelled to Malta, where her father was working as the Head of War Hospitals, and began to take an interest in the local antiquities.
Considerable disagreement exists over the date in which she become a Roman Catholic convert but Garrod apparently converted to Catholicism prior to coming up to Cambridge.

==Career==

On her family&#x27;s return to England, where they settled in Oxford, Garrod read for a graduate diploma in Anthropology in 1921. It is clear from her lecture notes, which survive at Museum Antiquities Nationale, that the Diploma course was an intensive introduction to both archaeology and anthropology. She was taught by Robert Ranulph Marett, a Reader in Social Anthropology and an experienced excavator. She received a distinction on graduating in 1921, as one among a small number of female students. She had found an intellectual vocation: the archaeology of the Palaeolithic Age. Pamela Janes Smith discovered that Garrod states later as a tribute to him that &quot;Marett the genial colleague, the brilliant talker, the beloved friend.&quot; Smith discovered that Mrs Chitty, née Mary Kitson Clark, one of Garrod&#x27;s companions, during the Mount Carmel excavation of 1929, in an interview, that Garrod &quot;experienced her conversion to prehistory with a religious depth of feeling [...] The determination to be a prehistorian and particularly in the Stone Age, came over her in one second, like a conversion.&quot; It was Marrett that introduced her to France and M. l&#x27;Abbé Breuil, her intellectual father. Garrod studied for two years, 1922 to 1924, with M. l&#x27;Abbé Breuil, the prehistorian, at the Institut de Paleontologie Humaine in Paris. Smith argues that Garrod&#x27;s interest in the origin, distribution and classification of Middle and Upper Palaeolithic assemblages; her fascination with the questions of the origin of the modern humans and the demise of the Neanderthals; the concern with relative dating by geochronology and her declaration that &quot;Europe was only after all a peninsula of Africa and Asia&quot; (Clarke 1999:409) could be interpreted as Garrod being the intellectual child of the Abbé Breuil&quot;.

In 1926, Garrod published her first academic work, &quot;The Upper Paleolithic of Britain&quot;, for which she was awarded a B.Sc. degree by the University of Oxford.

Following an invitation from Breuil, she investigated Devil&#x27;s Tower Cave, a site over a period of seven months in Gibraltar between 1925 and 1927. It was only 350 metres from Forbes&#x27; Quarry, where a Neanderthal skull had been found earlier. Garrod discovered in this cave in 1925, a second important Neanderthal skull now called Gibraltar 2. It was her first internationally recognized excavation. Garrod was to find many anomalous skeletons during her ensuring career, but the skull did not fit within the definition of Neanderthal. 
In 1928, she led the first expedition to enter South Kurdistan. She was looking for evidence of Palaeolithic people migrating between Upper Mesopotamia and Syria. This work led to the test explorations of Hazar Merd Cave and Zarzi cave.
In 1929, Garrod was appointed to direct excavations at Wadi el-Mughara at Mount Carmel in Mandatory Palestine, as a joint project of the American School of Prehistoric Research and the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. The series of 12 extensive fieldseasons was completed between 1929 and 1934. The results established a chronological framework that remains crucial to present understanding of that prehistoric period. Working closely with Dorothea Bate, she demonstrated a long sequence of Lower Palaeolithic, Middle Palaeolithic and Epipalaeolithic occupations in the caves of Tabun, El-Wad, Es-Skhul, Shuqba (Shuqbah) and Kebara Cave. She also coined the cultural label for the late Epipalaeolithic Natufian culture (from Wadi Natuf, the location of the Shuqba cave) following her excavations at Es-Skhul and El-Wad. Her excavations at the cave sites in the Levant were conducted with almost exclusively women workers recruited from local villages, such as Jeba and Ljsim. One of these women, Yusra, is credited with the discovery of the Tabun 1 Neanderthal skull. The villages of Jeba and Ljsim were destroyed in 1948 and most members of the Palestinian team could not be traced. In 1937, Garrod published &quot;The Stone Age of Mount Carmel,&quot; considered a ground-breaking work in the field. In 1938, she travelled to Bulgaria and excavated the Palaeolithic cave of Bacho Kiro.
After holding academic positions, including Newnham College&#x27;s Director of Studies for Archaeology and Anthropology, she became the Disney Professor of Archaeology at Cambridge on 6 May 1939, a post she held until 1952. Her appointment was greeted with excitement by women students and a &quot;college feast&quot; was held in her honour at Newnham, in which every dish was named after an archaeological item. In addition, the &quot;Cambridge Review&quot; reported, &quot;The election of a woman to the Disney Professorship of Archaeology is an immense step forward towards complete equality between men and women in the University.&quot; Gender equality at the University of Cambridge at the time was still remote: as a woman, Garrod could not be a full member of the university, so that she was excluded from speaking or voting on University matters. This continued to apply until 1948, when women became full members of the university.

From 1941 to 1945, Garrod took leave of absence from the university and served in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) during the Second World War. She was based at the RAF Medmenham photographic interpretation unit as a section officer (equivalent in rank to flying officer).

After the war, Garrod returned to her position and made changes to the department, including the introduction of a module of study on world prehistory. Where previously prehistory had been considered particularly French or European, Garrod expanded the subject to a global scale. Garrod also made changes to the structure of archaeology studies, so turning Cambridge into the first British university to offer undergraduate courses in prehistoric archaeology. During the university summer vacations, Garrod travelled to France and excavated at two important sites: Fontéchevade cave, with Germaine Henri-Martin, and Angles-sur-l&#x27;Anglin, with Suzanne de St. Mathurin.

===Later life===
On her retirement in 1952, Garrod moved to France, but continued to research and excavate. In 1958, aged 66, she excavated on the Aadloun headland in Lebanon, with the assistance of Diana Kirkbride. The following year she was asked urgently to excavate at Ras El Kelb, as a significant cave had been disturbed by road and rail construction. Henri-Martin and de St. Mathurin assisted Garrod for seven weeks, with the remaining material being removed to the National Museum of Beirut for more detailed study. She returned to Aadloun again in 1963, with a team of younger archaeologists, but her health began to fail and she was often absent from the sites.

Garrod appeared as a panellist in a 1959 episode of the game show &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?&quot; held at the Musée de l&#x27;Homme.

In the summer of 1968, Garrod had a stroke while visiting relatives in Cambridge. She died in a nursing home there on 18 December, aged 76.

===Diversity and inclusion ===
Garrod was the first female professor at Cambridge and was instrumental in changing it into an integrated institution. As a result of her election to Professorship, women were granted full membership, and allowed to graduate with degrees from the University of Cambridge. She worked mainly with women as she lived in a segregated English society. In Palestine she was treated as member of the British ruling class and deeply loved by Palestinians. Garrod&#x27;s relationships
with her Arab neighbours and employees &quot;were warm. Garrod was often invited to weddings or other celebratory occasions. &quot;She was called Sitt Miriam, Lady Mary.&quot;.
Her Mount Carmel expedition crew, which covered all of the excavations (Skhul, Kebara, el-Wad and et-Tabun), consisted mostly of local Arab women. Garrod was in complete charge of the many long-term excavations at Mount Carmel. In 1931, Francis Turville Petre, an openly gay man, participated very briefly in her excavations of Mount Carmel as part of Garrod&#x27;s team at Skhul. Francis Turville-Petre had discovered an ancient cranium at Mugharet ex-Zuttiyeh, near the Sea of Galilee, considered to be the most remarkable prehistoric archaeological event of the 1920s in Western Asia.

===Awards and recognition===
In 1937, Garrod was awarded Honorary Doctorates from the University of Pennsylvania and Boston College and a DSc. from the University of Oxford. She was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1952, and in 1965 she was awarded the CBE. She felt it was important that archaeologists travel and therefore left money to found the Dorothy Garrod Travel Fund. In 1968, the Society of Antiquaries of London presented her with its gold medal.

From September 2011 to January 2012, 17 photographs of Garrod&#x27;s of excavations, friends and mentors were displayed in &#x27;A Pioneer of Prehistory, Dorothy Garrod and the Caves of Mount Carmel&#x27; at the Pitt Rivers Museum.

In 2017, Newnham College announced that a new college building will be named after Garrod. In 2019, the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge unveiled a new portrait of Garrod by artist Sara Levelle.

<text>Davy Spillane (born 1959 in Dublin, Ireland) is an Irish musician, songwriter and a player of uilleann pipes and low whistle.

== Biography ==
=== Irish music ===
At the age of 12, Spillane started playing the uilleann pipes. His father encouraged him and inspired him with his love of all music genres. For the next three years he played at sessions and met many prominent Irish musicians. At the age of 16, he played in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Europe. In 1978, he began to write his own music. He starred as a gypsy in Joe Comerford&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Traveller&quot;.

=== Moving Hearts and solo albums ===
He is a founding member of Moving Hearts, along with Christy Moore and Donal Lunny in 1981. Although each member had a strong pedigree of Irish folk music, the band played mostly original compositions, sometimes with a political edge and a folk-rock sound. Their final album &quot;The Storm&quot; (1985) was purely instrumental and had several slower pieces written by Spillane. He then made the surprise move of joining up with American musician Béla Fleck, the Englishman Albert Lee, Jerry Douglas, and others to record a Davy Spillane debut album of his new compositions and bluegrass and original blues, &quot;Atlantic Bridge&quot;. There was a promotional touring band which also recorded &quot;Out of the Air&quot; in 1988, essentially a live version of &quot;Atlantic Bridge&quot;. Spillane then gathered together a new set of musicians, including Rory Gallagher and Kevin Glackin to record &quot;Shadow Hunter&quot;, an album of various rock and folk styles. This was followed by &quot;Pipedreams&quot; in 1991.

=== Collaborations===
Spillane played as special guest soloist in orchestral work in 1992 called &quot;The Seville Suite&quot;, describing events in 1601 in Irish-Spanish history. Bill Whelan then worked for Spillane and Andy Irvine on the album, &quot;EastWind&quot;. In 1993, Spillane collaborated with Canadian musicians such as Bryan Adams, and Daniel Weaver on his album &quot;Weeds&quot; plus Celine Dion&#x27;s &quot;My Heart Will go On&quot;. In 1994, Spillane was a special guest soloist in &quot;Riverdance&quot;. Spillane also collaborated with Rory Gallagher on the tracks &quot;The Road to Ballyalla&quot;, &quot;Litton Lane&quot; and &quot;One For Phil&quot; as well as with Enya on her 1988 Watermark tracks &quot;Exile&quot; and &quot;Na Laetha Geal M&#x27;Óige&quot;.

=== Film music ===
In 1992, Spillane composed music for Peter Kosminsky&#x27;s film &quot;Emily Brontë&#x27;s Wuthering Heights&quot; and, in 1995, reached a larger audience with the film &quot;Rob Roy&quot;. Other compositions and guesting includes Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;Sensual World&quot; (1989), Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Voyager&quot; (1996), Bryan Adams&#x27; MTV Unplugged, Van Morrison and Elvis Costello. Other films include &quot;Eat the Peach&quot; and &quot;The Disappearance of Finbar&quot;. Paul Winter&#x27;s album &quot;Journey with the Sun&quot; (2002). Spillane earned a Grammy Award and also nominated for second one.

Spillane served his apprenticeship with pipe-makers Dan Dowd and Johnny Burke and now makes all his own instruments. In 2000, he recorded his only album of traditional tunes with Kevin Glackin, entitled &quot;Forgotten Days&quot;.

<doc id="1241411" wikidata="Q586364" url="?curid=1241411" title="Conservative Party (Norway)">
<text>The Conservative Party or The Right (, , , H; ) is a liberal-conservative political party in Norway. It is the major party of the Norwegian centre-right, and was the leading party in government as part of the Solberg cabinet from 2013 to 2021. The current party leader is former Prime Minister Erna Solberg. The party is a member of the International Democracy Union and an associate member of the European People&#x27;s Party.

The party is traditionally a pragmatic and politically moderate conservative party strongly associated with the traditional elites within the civil service and Norwegian business life. During the 20th century, the party has advocated economic liberalism, tax cuts, individual rights, support of monarchism, the Church of Norway and the Armed Forces, anti-communism, pro-Europeanism, and support of the Nordic model; over time, the party&#x27;s values have become more socially liberal in areas such as gender equality, LGBT rights, and immigration and integration issues; the party defines itself as a party pursuing a &quot;conservative progressive policy based on Christian cultural values, constitutional government and democracy&quot;. In line with its Western bloc alignment during the Cold War era, the party strongly supports NATO, which Norway co-founded, and has consistently been the most outspokenly pro-European Union party in Norway, supporting Norwegian membership during both the 1972 and 1994 referendums.

The Conservative Party traditionally caters to the educated elite and is the most popular party among elite groups. In the postwar era, the party formed a grand consensus with the Labour Party regarding foreign and security policy—frequently expressed by the maxim &quot;the foreign policy is settled&quot; (&quot;utenrikspolitikken ligger fast&quot;)—that led Norway to co-found NATO and enter into a close alliance with the United States, and the parties&#x27; economic policies have gradually become more similar. Both parties are pragmatic, relatively technocratic, anti-populist, and close to the political centre. The party supports the Nordic model, but also a certain amount of semi-privatisation through state-funded private services.

Founded in 1884, the Conservative Party is the second-oldest political party in Norway after the Liberal Party. In the interwar era, one of the main goals for the party was to achieve a centre-right alliance against the growing labour movement, when the party went into decline. In the post-war era until 2005, the party participated in six governments: two 1960s national governments (Lyng&#x27;s Cabinet and Borten&#x27;s Cabinet); one 1980s Conservative Party minority government (Willoch&#x27;s First Cabinet); two 1980s three-party governments (Willoch&#x27;s Second Cabinet and Syse&#x27;s Cabinet); in the 2000s Bondevik&#x27;s Second Cabinet; and from 2013 to 2021 it was the dominant partner in a coalition government that also included the Christian Democrats and the Liberal Party.

== History ==

The Conservative Party of Norway (&quot;Høire&quot;, now spelled &quot;Høyre&quot;, lit. &quot;The Right&quot;) was founded in 1884 after the implementation of parliamentarism in Norway. The jurist Emil Stang was elected the first chairman of the party. Stang underlined important principles for the work in Høyre. The party was to be a social party of reforms that worked within the constitutional frames set by a parliamentary democracy.

Høyre&#x27;s electoral support has varied. In the 1981 election it obtained 31.7%, its best result since 1924. The result in 1993 was 17%, which saw the election influenced by the EU membership issue which divided the Liberal Party. The 1997 parliamentary election resulted in the lowest support for Høyre since 1945, with only 14.3% of the votes. Since then it has seen support ranging from just over 14% to just under 27%.

=== Early 1900s ===
In the beginning of the 20th century, Høyre took the initiative to construct a modern Norwegian communications network. After the devastating First World War the party felt it important to work for the reconstruction of sound economic policies. An example of this is the resolution Høyre passed in 1923 introducing old-age insurance; owing to the condition of the state&#x27;s finances it was not possible to continue this effort. It was the leading party in opposition during the post-war years in Norway, and fought against the Labour Party&#x27;s regulating policy. Høyre wanted another future for Norway, consisting of private initiative and creative forces.

Høyre has been active in the construction of the welfare system in Norway, and has on several occasions taken the initiative to correct injustices in social care regulations. Additionally, Høyre has advocated that the state&#x27;s activity must concentrate on its basic problems and their solutions.

=== Post-war years ===
During Norway&#x27;s post-war years Høyre has consolidated its position as a party with appeal to all parts of the nation. Non-socialist co-operation as an alternative to socialism has always been one of Høyre&#x27;s main aims. Høyre has led several coalition governments. The Christian Democratic Party was one of Høyre&#x27;s coalition partners both in 1983–86 and 1989–90.

The party strongly supported the Western alignment of Norway during the Cold War; it strongly supports NATO, which Norway co-founded in 1949, and has consistently been the most outspokenly pro-European Union party in Norway, supporting Norwegian membership during both the referendum of 1972 and that of 1994.

At the parliamentary election in 1993, it was impossible to present a credible non-socialist government alternative, because Høyre&#x27;s former coalition parties, The Christian Democrats and the Centre Party, both campaigned strongly against Norwegian membership of the EU.

Before the parliamentary election in 1997 the Labour Party proclaimed that it would not be willing to govern the country if it did not obtain more than 36.9% of the votes. In the event it obtained 35%, and other parties had to form a government. Originally, there were serious discussions between Høyre, the Christian Democrats and Venstre concerning this task, but in the end the two latter parties joined forces with the Centre Party to create a minority government without Høyre.

=== Today ===
In the parliamentary election in September 2001, Høyre obtained 21.2 percent of the votes. After a series of discussions Høyre was once again able to take part in a coalition government, this time with the Christian Democratic Party (KrF), and the Liberal Party (V). The total percentage obtained for these three parties at last general election was 37.5. Høyre, as the largest party in the coalition government, had 38 members in the present Storting, and 10 of the 19 ministers in the Government were Høyre representatives. Høyre&#x27;s three focal areas this period were to establish a rise in quality in Norway&#x27;s educational system, lower taxes and produce a higher service level in state sectors.

In the 2005 parliamentary election, Høyre obtained 14.1% of the votes. The election outcome put Høyre back in opposition, and the party got 23 members in the present Storting.

In the 2009 parliamentary election, Høyre obtained 17.2% of the votes, and 30 members in the present Storting.

During the local elections of 2011, however, the party gained 27.6 percent of the vote, and it has since then, without exceptions, polled first and second.

In the 2013 parliamentary election, Høyre obtained 26.8 percent of the votes, and 48 members in the present Storting. Høyre formed a minority government, with confidence and supply from KrF and V. The Government was reelected in 2017 and became a majority Government in 2019.

==Ideology==
Høyre has been described as a conservative or liberal conservative party, and it defines itself as a party pursuing a &quot;conservative progressive policy based on Christian cultural values, constitutional government and democracy.&quot;

Høyre is considered a centre-right reform party profess to the moderately conservative political tradition, similar to the CDU of Germany. The party broadly supports the Nordic model, like all large parties in Norway. In relative terms, the party advocates a degree of fiscal free-market policies, including tax cuts and relatively little government involvement in the economy, while still supporting the welfare state and the social market economy. Høyre is also the only party in the Storting which proposes a reduction in public spending.

Traditionally, the party supports established institutions such as the monarchy, the armed forces, and the Church of Norway. Its social policies were always considered moderate and pragmatic for its time, but have gradually become more socially liberal. The party voted in 2008 for a law that recognised same-sex marriage and gay adoption rights.

==Membership and voter demographic==
The party has around 30,000 registered members (2018). The Central Board of the Conservative Party meets seven times a year to discuss important matters such as budget, organisational work, plans, party platforms, and drawing up political lines.

The party traditionally caters to the educated elite; it has the most highly educated voters of all parties, and is the most popular party among elite groups.

<doc id="1241413" wikidata="Q4262090" url="?curid=1241413" title="HMS Hydra (A144)">
<text>HMS &quot;Hydra (pennant number A144) was a [[Royal Navy]] deep ocean hydrographic survey vessel, the third of the original three of the . The ship was laid down as [[yard number]] 2258 on 14 May 1964 at [[Yarrow Shipbuilders]], at [[Scotstoun]] on the [[River Clyde]] and launched on 14 July 1965 by Mary Lythall, wife of the then [[Government Chief Scientific Adviser|Chief Scientist]] (Royal Navy), Basil W Lythall [[Companion of the Bath|CB]] (1919–2001). She was completed and first commissioned on 4 May 1966 and, as the replacement for the survey ship , her commanding officer and many of her ship&#x27;s company formed the first commission of HMS &quot;Hydra&quot;. She was decommissioned and sold to the [[Indonesian Navy]] in 1986 and renamedKRI &quot;Dewa Kembar (Pennant Number 932); she was still in service in 2019.

==Ship&#x27;s name and battle honours==
There have been eight ships of the name in the Royal Navy, named for the Hydra of Greek Mythology, a serpent with many heads (though nine is generally accepted as standard), the centre one of which was immortal. The monster was overcome and slain by Hercules. The ship&#x27;s badge of HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; depicts the monster with seven heads. The ship&#x27;s motto was &quot;Ut Herculis Perseverantia&quot; (&quot;Like Hercules Persevere&quot;).

==Late 1960s==
In the month after first commissioning &quot;Hydra&quot; carried out machinery and equipment trials and embarked stores at Chatham, before sailing for surveys in the North Atlantic. Based in Reykjavík, an extensive area south of Iceland was surveyed between June and September 1966. She then visited Copenhagen and for the remainder of 1966, was employed in searching for wrecks in the shipping lanes of the North Sea and the approaches to the Dover Strait, before returning to Chatham in early December for her winter lie-up. March 1967 saw the ship carrying out a short survey of the critical depths at the entrance of the Black Deep Channel in the Thames estuary. She then carried out a major survey of the bathymetry, gravity anomalies and total magnetic field in a large area of the Atlantic Ocean, covering the North-West Approaches to Britain. At the same time, between May and August 1967, a detached party and the ship&#x27;s two surveying motor boats undertook a survey of the fishing port of Burtonport, Donegal. After summer leave and maintenance and a visit to Brest, she spent a fortnight on oceanographic surveys in the Azores area, followed by a visit to Lisbon and passage to Freetown. An oceanographic survey of the fishing grounds between Freetown and Agadir was completed. At Gibraltar in mid-November, she conducted trials of towed and free balloons carrying meteorological instruments before reaching Chatham for refit on 24 November 1967.

She recommissioned on 30 January 1968 and in March undertook an oceanographic voyage designed to advance knowledge of air/sea interaction. She carried out surveys in the Bristol Channel in April and then, for six weeks, in the southern approaches to the River Clyde. For the following two months, she was based at Londonderry and an area in the north-western approaches to Ireland was surveyed to the line. At Chatham in late August, she took part in Navy Days and then visited the Pool of London in early September. The ship sailed Chatham in late October and carried out surveys off the west coast of Africa, spending Christmas 1968 in Gibraltar.

In early January 1969 she carried out surveys off the French Mediterranean coast. She then took part in the Atlantic Trade Wind Experiment, with survey ships from West Germany and the US; this consisted of a 15-day drift, with engines stopped, from a position some west of Cape Verde Islands. &quot;Hydra&quot; returned to Sierra Leone in mid-February and carried out surveys until she sailed Freetown on 25 May 1969. She spent a fortnight investigating an up-welling off Cape Blanc, then calling at Gibraltar before arriving on 19 June 1969 for a refit at Chatham. A new ship&#x27;s company joined at the end of August and she sailed from Chatham at the end of October for the Far East. Calls were made en route at Freetown, Simonstown and Mauritius and Singapore was reached in time for Christmas. A survey of the Malacca Strait was started on 31 December 1969.

==1970s - and five years away from the UK==
Surveying a route wide down the length of the Malacca Strait was a mammoth task. Breaks for maintenance, fuel and recreation were taken at Singapore, with a longer interruption from mid-June to mid-October 1970 for refit by Sembawang Shipyard. The ship visited Port Swettenham before resuming surveys in the Malacca Strait. However, she was detached after a fortnight to support the British task force sent from Singapore to relieve the area of East Pakistan stricken by a severe cyclone and storm surge. The ship was used in a survey role, finding and marking channels for small craft to take in food and supplies. She later resumed the Malacca Strait survey and spent Christmas 1970 at Singapore. During her year in the Malacca Strait, 63 shoal soundings were reported and promulgated by Notice to Mariners.

The surveys of the Malacca Strait were concluded in March 1971 and she then spent three weeks in Hong Kong charting waters to the south of Lantao. On 6 April 1971, HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; sailed from Hong Kong to return to the UK, via the Panama Canal. She called at Yokosuka, Long Beach, Acapulco and Bridgetown, Barbados, making gravity, magnetics and bathymetric observations on passage and investigating several shoals. The summer and autumn of 1971 were spent at Chatham, with a refit and trials.

Recommissioned at Chatham on 11 October 1971, she sailed on 30 November 1971 via the Cape of Good Hope, to return to the Far East from where she was not to return for five years, carrying out extensive surveys in the south Pacific. She left Simonstown on 3 January 1972 and called at Mauritius before carrying out a short investigation around the Aldabra Islands. After a visit to Mombasa to calibrate the ship&#x27;s gravimeter, the first half of February was spent in the Seychelles where the ship&#x27;s helicopter helped with the erection of Hi-Fix sites.

&quot;Hydra&quot; was detached from surveying, and ordered to return to the Mauritius area, arriving off Rodrigues Island, one of the Mascarene Islands, on 26 February to assist in disaster relief. She left the area and arrived Singapore on 13 March, thus completing a circumnavigation of the globe in one year. After a short period of maintenance, she set sail for her 1972 survey area in the Solomon Islands. This survey, from 17 April to 18 August, covered the Bougainville Strait, last surveyed in 1884. Visits were paid to Honiara (Guadalcanal Island), Ghizo Island and Kieta (Bougainville Island). A three-week visit to Brisbane was brought forward in order to have two defective main engines replaced by two flown out from the United Kingdom. The ship arrived in Hong Kong at the end of August, where she spent three months, some time being spent on surveys in local waters. She sailed from Hong Kong on 28 October and arrived in Singapore for her annual refit which began on 13 November; the most important work was the installation of the SRN9 satellite navigation system.

The refit was completed on 13 January and &quot;Hydra&quot; sailed 12 February 1973 to resume surveys in the Solomon Islands, brief visits being paid to Jakarta and Thursday Island during the passage to Honiara. Surveys of Bougainville Strait and New Georgia Sound were completed. A three-week visit was paid to Brisbane in May, for maintenance, and while on passage both ways a reconnaissance was made of Indispensable Reef. For the next thirteen weeks, almost without a break, surveys were undertaken along the north coasts of Choiseul and Santa Isabel Islands and of Manning Strait. A Solomon Islands 45c postage stamp was issued in January 1981, recording the ship&#x27;s surveying from April 1972 to September 1973.

Preparations for future surveys were carried out around Fiji in late 1973 and a visit was made to Sydney on passage back to Singapore, where she arrived on 26 October for refit; the ship&#x27;s company lived ashore in the ANZUK barracks. No time was lost owing to bad weather or breakdown during a year in which the ship had steamed over . The two survey boats had steamed an additional during the surveys of the Solomon Islands.

With the refit completed in January 1974, her next surveys were around the Maldives, during which time she visited Gan. She made the long passage east, via Singapore, and arrived at her new base of Suva, in the Fiji Islands, on 12 April. Surveys were carried out off northern Viti Levu, with a break in June/July for maintenance in Brisbane. Back off Viti Levu in July, these surveys were completed by August. The next month, work began on modern surveys off northern Vanua Levu and of Yandua Island. Before departing Fijian waters on 21 October, HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; took part in celebrations to mark the centenary of the cession of the islands to Queen Victoria, with Prince Charles embarked for part of the time. Survey was made of Epi Island, and other areas, of the New Hebrides on passage for Auckland, New Zealand, where the ship arrived on 28 November for maintenance and leave.

Surveys off Vanua Levu were resumed in January 1975, though work was punctuated with excursions to the Koro Sea for hurricane assistance and search and rescue work. The ship was absent from surveys in the Fiji area in March for a series of vigia investigations in the south-western Pacific. Surveys were broken off at the end of April and, on 2 May, the ship sailed Suva for Singapore, where she arrived on 22 May for a ten-week refit.

HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; then sailed for the Indian Ocean and was surveying the waters around the Seychelles from September to November. She then had a maintenance period in Mombasa, returning to survey off Mahé. Christmas 1975 was spent in Port Victoria and the ship sailed the Seychelles on 29 December for the Persian Gulf.

The main survey was on the traffic separation routes about from the eastern end of the Persian Gulf, around the Tunb Islands off Iran. The surveys began with a visit to Bandar Abbas and Iranian naval personnel were attached to the ship for the duration. The ship remained in the area until the end of April, working mostly out of Bandar Abbas, but visits were paid to Karachi (for maintenance), Masirah and Dubai. Passage through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean was followed by a two-week maintenance period in Malta in late May 1976. Surveys then began in the western Mediterranean, until the middle of September, with visits to Palermo, Malta and Gibraltar. She sailed the Rock on 14 September for Portsmouth, her first sighting of the UK in five years. She then underwent a refit at Vosper Thornycroft in Southampton, when her living accommodation was extensively modernised; boat surveys of Portsmouth harbour, and other south coast harbours, were carried out during the refit. No chart of Chichester harbour had previously existed, and parts of the Poole area had not been surveyed since 1878.

HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; completed refit in August 1977 and was operational again on 26 September. She sailed 24 October for Iran, calling briefly at Gibraltar and Malta. She arrived at Bandar Abbas, in company with , on 23 November and surveys then began along the Iranian coast in the Gulf of Oman. Christmas 1977 was spent in Bahrain. She was employed on surveys in the Persian Gulf, off Iran, for much of 1978 and 1979.

On 1 January 1979, as one of four Royal Navy survey ships forming the Persian Gulf Surveying Squadron (&quot;Hydra&quot;, , and ), HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; was at anchor in Char Bahar bay on the south-east coast of Iran. Later in the month, the ship was at Bombay for maintenance, resuming surveys off Iran on 4 February. The surveys were almost complete when the ship was ordered to Bandar Abbas assist with the evacuation of western nationals during the Iranian revolution. While awaiting a decision as to their future employment, the ships of the squadron were engaged in investigations of the many shoals in the centre of the Persian Gulf. The ship visited Muscat and then the decision was made to withdraw the squadron, so passage was set for the UK, with visits to Haifa, Catania and Gibraltar, before arriving in Portsmouth on 19 April. She sailed on 9 May for shoal investigations in Scottish waters and spent July and August in Southampton for docking and repairs at Vosper. The autumn of 1979 was spent off the west coast of Scotland, starting a detailed survey of the Western Approaches to the North Channel, an area where a large number of U-boats were sunk in 1946 after their surrender.

==Three years in the life of a Royal Navy survey ship 1980–1983==

=== Service 1980–1981===

HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; was employed on surveys off the west coast of Scotland in 1980 and 1981.

===To West Africa and surveys in the Caribbean 1981–1982===
Newly fitted with a leased Sercel Syledis positioning system for evaluation, she sailed on 7 September 1981 to conduct surveys in the Caribbean Sea, surveying the Josephine Bank and the Ampere Bank on 11 and 13 September, as well as investigating &quot;vigia 4&quot;, &quot;vigia 7&quot; and &quot;vigia 23&quot;. With a maximum speed of using all three engines, when the starboard engine was lost on 21 September, the ship was limited to for the rest of the deployment.

She arrived Dakar, Senegal for a visit from 24 to 28 September 1981. On leaving Dakar, the ship was directed to Banjul, on 29 September in order to locate a ditched Senegalese Puma helicopter, which had crashed into the river while landing Senegalese troops during the attempted coup d&#x27;état on 1 August 1981, in the Gambia. Using copies of a recent survey, by sister ship flown to Dakar from the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, in Taunton, HMS &quot;Hydra&quot;″s two surveying motor boats began sounding and sonar sweeping and located the ditched machine, the local port authority marking the helicopter&#x27;s position with a float. She sailed the next day.

She arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on 5 October 1981, in company with the destroyer ), which she had met, by chance, in fog outside the entrance to the port. She sailed from Lagos on 9 October passing north of St Peter and St Paul Rocks on 16 October, arriving at Bridgetown, Barbados, for a visit from 23 to 27 October. During the trip across the Atlantic the side-scan sonar was deployed the autopilot and engine speed set in an attempt to set a record for the longest survey line. The journey parallel to the equator was carried out with just one small course correction to avoid a fleet of fishing boats near to the coast of South America.

She was alongside at the US Naval Station at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico (known to sailors as Roosey Roads from 29 to 31 October before setting up camps and sites on Great Inagua and the Turks Islands, in order to carry out hydrographic surveys centred on the waters around the British Virgin Islands. These surveys were part of a project in co-operation with the United States Navy, in the Turks and Caicos Islands, covering the Mouchoir Passage and Turks Island Passage. These passages were last surveyed by Commander Richard Owen in in 1829.

Visits were made to Roadtown, Tortola) from 12 to 16 November and, after sailing, a rendezvous was made with RFA &quot;Stromness&quot; near Vieques to take on stores, before resuming surveys. On 2 December, she broke off from surveys to visit Nassau, Bahamas from 4–8 December 1981 and then continued surveying (&quot;Hydrographic Instruction&quot; - HI 54) until 15 December. Changes were found in the configuration of the reefs - the northern edge of the Mouchoir Bank being nearly two miles south of its charted position.

Leaving a handful of volunteers to guard the various sites on island shores, she sailed north in order to spend two weeks alongside in St. Petersburg, Florida, arriving 18 December, for Christmas and New Year 1981/1982. Sailing on 2 January 1982, she arrived on the survey ground four days later and recovered the landed sailors, after their lonely three weeks in the sun.

Hydrographic Instruction &quot;HI 54&quot; was completed by 15 January 1982 and equipment ashore recovered. At anchor overnight on 15/16 January, she sailed for Roosevelt Roads arriving 18 January. She sailed three days later for Sand Cay in order to set up the surveys in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) area; time off task was necessitated by the ship being ordered to co-ordinate a search and rescue operation for a woman lost overboard from a yacht; the search was called off at sunset without finding her. 21–22 January was spent in Road Town, Tortola and then hydrographic surveys began, anchoring overnight 22/23 January off Beef Island, before setting up the boat camp and trisponder station on Guana Island and &quot;bottoming&quot; overnight. Hydrographic surveys continued in the BVI, including a detached boat camp in West Anegada, until completion on 8 February, anchoring that night in Cane Garden Bay, Tortola.

A visit was made to St. John&#x27;s, on the island of Antigua, from 9–13 February, before passage east across the Atlantic Ocean. 21–22 February was spent surveying the Atlantic Seamount, southwest of the Azores, completing with a visit to Ponta Delgada, the island&#x27;s capital, on 25–26 February. At anchor off Swanage, and later in Spithead on 3 March, she returned to Portsmouth Naval Base on 4 March 1982.

===Hospital ship: The Falklands War of 1982===
March was spent in the naval base, the ship undergoing assisted maintenance and the ship&#x27;s company taking leave. The ship&#x27;s programme for more surveys off the west coast of Scotland in the summer of 1982 was changed by Argentina&#x27;s invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982. HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; was converted in Portsmouth Naval Base for service as a hospital ship – a replenishment at sea position was fitted, the yellow funnel painted white and red crosses painted prominently, and the starboard engine replaced – and she sailed on 24 April 1982, in company with her sister-ship , with additional medical staff, for the South Atlantic. A BBC News report on that day described the ship as &quot;... converted to a casualty ferry ... [whose] job will be to ferry wounded troops from the Falklands&#x27; beachhead to the hospital ship &quot;Uganda&quot;; at this stage it was not at all certain quite how the ship would be used.

Her journey south took four weeks, crossing the line on 6 May (although the traditional ceremony was held the previous day, for operational reasons). She was a short time in the anchorage off Ascension Island for replenishment on 8 May. She was at position on 15 May and on 18 May. HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; joined sister ship HMS &quot;Hecla&quot; and SS &quot;Uganda&quot;, in the &quot;Red Cross Box&quot; (), about north of Falkland Sound on 19 May.

A rendezvous was made on 25 May 1982 with the requisitioned P&amp;O liner, the troopship , and in order to transfer casualties by the ship&#x27;s Westland Wasp helicopter. The day after she arrived in &quot;Red Cross Box 2&quot; – at position on 30 May, she embarked 49 casualties from &quot;Uganda&quot;. Underway the next day, 2 June 1982, on passage for Montevideo, she undertook the ship&#x27;s first-ever replenishment at sea – an RAS(L) – with the oiler , in order to take on fuel. The ship arrived in the River Plate on 6 June, disembarking her patients in the full glare of the world&#x27;s media, eager for news and photographs. She sailed south at 2200 the same day.

The pattern of casualty evacuation was thus established: HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; worked with her two sister ships, HMS &quot;Hecla&quot; and HMS &quot;Herald&quot;, to take casualties from the main hospital ship &quot;Uganda&quot;, operating in the declared &quot;Red Cross Box&quot;, to Montevideo, Uruguay, where they were disembarked by a fleet of Uruguayan ambulances and flown by RAF VC10 aircraft to the UK for transfer to the Princess Alexandra Hospital at RAF Wroughton, near Swindon. The hospital ship HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; made four such passages from the waters off the Falkland Islands to Montevideo, carrying a total of 251 British military casualties, many of them burns victims after the air attacks on landing ships at Bluff Cove. The last three &#x27;lifts&#x27; of patients were made with departures from Grantham Sound, in the Falkland Islands, to Montevideo on 14 June with 80 casualties, 24 June with 66 casualties and, finally, on 7 July 1982 with 48 casualties. Thirty of the ship&#x27;s company had been trained, during the passage south, to support the medical staff as temporary nurses and many were called on for that assistance. Inspections to ensure compliance with International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) conditions were carried out by ICRC staff, some transferring to the ship in an Argentine hospital ship aircraft on 12 June. An inspection was also made by Argentine naval officers in the estuary of the River Plate.

After the surrender, to Royal Marines Major-General Jeremy Moore, of the Argentine occupying forces on 14 June 1982, HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; stayed behind as the Falkland Islands Hospital Ship, based in Stanley (see ), until the airport runway was repaired and extended. After her last journey to Uruguay, she returned south and went to anchor in Port William, Falkland Islands, on 17 July. The next day she weighed anchor and sailed into Stanley, to anchor near the damaged , spending a week in the harbour, undergoing self-maintenance.

She later visited most of the major settlements, providing transport for a civilian doctor to visit the scattered population, and was at Fox Bay from 15 to 17 August. She finally left Stanley on 27 August 1982, calling at Ascension Island on 9 September 1982, disembarking an advance leave party to fly home ahead of the ship.

HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; was the last unit of the original Operation Corporate Task Force to return to the UK, arriving to an extraordinary welcome in Portsmouth on 24 September 1982; the Hydrographer of the Navy, Rear-Admiral David Haslam, embarked for the passage from Spithead, his flag flying from the ship&#x27;s HiFix mast so as not to displace the Red Cross flag from the mainmast; also notable was the salute paid to HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; by the NATO Commander, COMSTRIKFLTLANT, Vice-Admiral James A Lyons Jr of the United States Navy, and the ship&#x27;s company of his flagship, , lining the deck. The American ship was on a routine visit to Portsmouth; his flagship saluting the junior ship in a signal tribute to her war service, rather than HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; saluting his senior flag as would be the normal maritime custom (both salutes being made using a Boatswain&#x27;s call).

HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; was then converted back to her survey fleet role and resumed surveys in UK waters later in the year. Meanwhile, the ship&#x27;s company went on leave, many having been away from home waters for eleven of the past twelve months.

===United Kingdom waters 1982–1983===
HMS &quot;Hydra,&quot; freshly painted in her survey livery and with a large number of new faces among her 120 men, sailed Portsmouth on 25 November 1982 for surveys in the Western Approaches. At first it was too rough to start surveying, so the ship anchored off Scalasaig, Colonsay, on 28 November and weighed anchor to resume surveying the next day; after calibration of the Hyperfix chain being used for positional control, the sonar sweep and sounding began.

She broke off surveying and set passage to Greenock on 5 December, arriving alongside Greenock Pier the next day. She sailed out of the River Clyde on 8 December, and was east of Jura the following day, having resumed surveys. She broke off surveying on 13 December and sailed south for Portsmouth, securing outboard of the on 16 December 1982, before granting Christmas leave to the majority of the ship&#x27;s company. Despite the interruptions due to bad weather, of surveying were completed in the three weeks on task.

She sailed Portsmouth five days into the New Year and arrived on the survey ground, off the west coast of Scotland, on 7 January 1983, but surveying proved difficult owing to rough weather; the survey area was about north of the aptly named Bloody Foreland in the northwest of Ireland. She was off Jura on 8 January and made passage through the Sound of Islay on 10 January. She broke off surveying on 13 January and set passage to the River Clyde, arriving alongside Greenock Pier a day later, sailing again for the survey ground on 17 January.

She passed round the Mull of Kintyre to the Sound of Jura on 18 January and resumed surveys the next day. Very rough weather forced the ship to shelter behind the island of Inishtrahull on 20 January, so little progress had been made before she broke off from surveys and sailed for Belgium on 26 January. She was on passage through the Irish Sea the next day and arrived alongside in Antwerp on 31 January for a four-day visit. She arrived back in Portsmouth, her home port, on 5 February 1983 for a scheduled docking and repairs to defects. She moved into dry dock, and was docked down from 15 to 23 February, the dock being flooded up on 24 February.

HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; returned to sea on Monday 25 April 1983, for a brief trials and shakedown cruise prior to a week&#x27;s Safety Operational Sea Training (SOST) at the Portland Naval Base, from 17 to 25 May. On completion of SOST, specialist equipment and trials personnel were embarked from the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment (AUWE), Portland, for a two-month oceanographic trials cruise, in the Rockall Trench area and off Bear Island (Norway). The prototype Depth Analysis System developed at the Admiralty Compass Observatory was installed on the bridge, and trials staff embarked to conduct a short trial while on passage to Scotland. Visits were made to Trondheim and Lorient before the ship returned to her new base port of Devonport at the end of July 1983.

In early September 1983, HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; returned to Scottish waters and began surveys to the west of the Outer Hebrides for a proposed deep draught shipping route. The ship returned to Devonport on 21 October to prepare for a deployment to the Indian Ocean.

==Final years - 1984–1986==
HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; sailed on 14 November 1983 via Gibraltar, Naples and the Suez Canal for her first survey off the north coast of Oman. Christmas 1983 was spent at Dubai. of surveys were completed before the ship broke off for passage to Mombasa for a period of assisted maintenance. Boat surveys of Mombasa harbour were carried out. Sailing north to the Red Sea, a brief call was made at Hodeida, in the Yemen Arab Republic, before passage north to the Suez Canal and through to the Mediterranean Sea. A visit was made to Haifa and then the ship called at Gibraltar before conducting a short examination of the Chaucer Bank before returning to Devonport in mid-April 1984. The remainder of 1984 was spent surveying between St Kilda and Barra, off the west coast of Scotland, with a short period on oceanographic work in northern waters. A detached party carried out a boat survey of Loch Melfort.

She spent the early part of 1985 continuing a survey of the Sea of the Hebrides. On 10 September 1985 she sailed from Devonport to continue surveys in Kenyan waters, which she had started in 1984, and this work continued until January 1986. In mid-January she was ordered to proceed to assist with the evacuation of expatriates from the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen. She assisted with the evacuation of 49 civilians before being released for the homeward passage to the United Kingdom. She arrived in Devonport on 27 February 1986 wearing her paying-off pennant. She was decommissioned and put on the disposal list on 31 March 1986.

==Honours==
HMS &quot;Hydra&quot; added a seventh Battle Honour – South Atlantic 1982 – to her name. From September 1981, her ship&#x27;s company of 120 changed little for a year, notably the addition of wartime medical staff in April 1982. All the ship&#x27;s company involved in Operation Corporate in 1982 were awarded the South Atlantic Medal, with rosette, engraved with their rank, name and ship&#x27;s name.

<text>Seán Ó Riada (; born John Reidy; 1 August 1931 – 3 October 1971) was an Irish composer and arranger of Irish traditional music. Through his incorporation of modern and traditional techniques he became the single most influential figure in the revival of Irish traditional music during the 1960s.

Ó Riada&#x27;s career began as a music director at Radio Éireann from 1954, after which he worked at the Abbey Theatre from 1955 to 1962. He lectured in music at University College Cork from 1963 until his death in 1971. He became a household name in Ireland through his participation in Ceoltóirí Chualann, compositions, writings and broadcasts. His best-known pieces in the classical tradition include &quot;Nomos No. 1: Hercules Dux Ferrariae&quot; (1957), but he became particularly famous for his film scores &quot;Mise Éire&quot; (1959) and &quot;Saoirse?&quot; (1960). He left a lasting influence as founder and director of the ensemble Ceoltóirí Chualann (from 1961). His music still endures: his mass in Irish is still sung to this day in many churches in the Irish-speaking regions of Ireland.

Ó Riada died in 1971, aged 40.

==Early life==

Ó Riada was born John Reidy in Cork City. He spent his early years in Adare, County Limerick, where his father, a Garda sergeant, was stationed. After beginning school in Adare, he later attended St Finbarr&#x27;s College, Farranferris and whilst he was there he received musical education from Aloys Fleischmann (Senior). He moved to St Munchin&#x27;s College in Limerick where he completed his Leaving Certificate in 1948.

He played violin, piano and organ, and studied Greek, Latin, and Classics at University College Cork, with Aloys Fleischmann (Junior) and graduated in 1952. While at college, Ó Riada was the auditor of the UCC Philosophical Society. That year he became assistant director for Radio Éireann. He married Ruth Coughlan in 1953.

During the evening he played piano with dance bands. He spent several months in France in 1955, and consolidated his interest in modernist music. On his return in July he became music director of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin (until 1962), where he wrote, arranged and directed music for the small pit orchestra, also continuing his work in radio. Most of his original, modern orchestral compositions were also written in this time, which included his &quot;Nomos No. 1: Hercules Dux Ferrariae&quot; for string orchestra (1957), &quot;Nomos No. 4&quot; for piano and orchestra (1958) and the &quot;Triptyche pour orchestre&quot; (1960) as well as an early version of his ambitious &quot;Nomos No. 2&quot; for baritone solo, mixed choir and orchestra (1965). As his work with Ceoltóirí Chualann developed, his engagement with the modern musical avantgarde decreased, but was never abandoned.

==Mise Éire==
Ó Riada composed and directed orchestral music for theatre and film, combining traditional Irish tunes and &quot;sean-nós&quot; (old style) songs in the classical tradition, similar to nationalist composers such as Dvořák (Czech), Bartók (Hungarian) and Ralph Vaughan Williams (English). In 1959 he scored a documentary film by George Morrison called &quot;Mise Éire&quot; (&quot;I am Ireland&quot;), about the founding of the Irish Republic. The recording is conducted by Ó Riada himself. &quot;Mise Éire&quot; brought him national acclaim and allowed him to start a series of programmes on Irish radio called &quot;Our Musical Heritage&quot;. Ó Riada told people that one should listen to sean-nós singing either as a child would listen or as if they were songs from India.

==Ceoltóirí Chualann==
Between 1961 and 1969 Ó Riada led the Ceoltóirí Chualann group. They played in concert halls dressed in black suits with white shirts and black bow ties, but relied on traditional songs and tunes. An ordinary céili band or show-band would have musicians who competed with each other to grab the audience&#x27;s attention. Ceoltóirí Chualann played sparse lucid arrangements. Ó Riada sat in the middle at front playing a harpsichord and a bodhrán, a hand-held frame-drum. This was an instrument that had almost died out, being played only by small boys in street parades. Ceilí bands generally had jazz-band drum-kits. Ó Riada also wanted to use the cláirseach or wire-strung harp in the band, but as these were as yet unavailable, he played the harpsichord instead – in his opinion the nearest sound to a cláirseach. The harpsichord he used on a regular basis was made by Cathal Gannon. Unknown to Ó Riada, Irish folk music was being played ensemble-style in London pubs, but for most people of Ireland this was the first time they heard these tunes played by a band. For some, the membership of Ceoltóirí Chualann overlapped with that of The Chieftains. They recorded the soundtrack of the film &quot;Playboy of the Western World&quot; (original play by John Millington Synge) in 1962. Their last public performance was in 1969, the album was then called &quot;Ó Riada Sa Gaiety&quot;.

==Final years==
In 1963, Ó Riada was appointed lecturer in music at University College, Cork. He moved to Baile Bhúirne, and not Cúil Aodha (a common misconception) in County Cork, an Irish-speaking area, where he established &quot;Cór Chúil Aodha&quot;, a male voice choir. He turned toward choral church music, composing two settings of the Mass. &quot;Ceol an Aifrinn&quot; (&quot;Music of the Mass&quot;) was the first Mass written in the Irish language. This featured the hymn &quot;Ag Críost an Síol&quot;, which has become popular in its own right, and with such good phrasing, that it is (wrongly) thought by many today to be an ancient medieval tune. &quot;Aifreann 2&quot; (&quot;Mass 2&quot;) premiered posthumously in 1979. Further works in the &quot;classical&quot; tradition include &quot;Five Epigrams from the Greek Anthology&quot; (1958) and &quot;In memoriam Aloys G. Fleischmann&quot; (1964) to words by Hölderlin. Ó Riada also set the poetry of Thomas Kinsella (&quot;Three Poems&quot;, 1954), who returned the favour by praising Ó Riada in verse.

He became involved in Irish politics and was a friend of several influential leaders. Ó Riada and his wife Ruth drank regularly at a local pub which still advertises itself as being his local.

==Death==
He suffered cirrhosis of the liver. He was flown to King&#x27;s College Hospital, London, for treatment and died there. He is buried in St Gobnait&#x27;s graveyard, Baile Bhuirne, County Cork. Willie Clancy played at his funeral.

==Legacy==

Seán Ó Riada and Ceoltóirí Chualann set to music the Peadar Ó Doirnín lyric &quot;Mná na hÉireann&quot;, which has been recorded or re-used by many artists. As performed by the Chieftains, it is used as a romantic overture throughout the Stanley Kubrick movie &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; and is the basis of The Christians&#x27; 1989 single &quot;Words&quot;. His daughter Liadh Ní Riada was elected as Sinn Féin Member of the European Parliament in 2014. She was the Sinn Féin candidate in the 2018 presidential election.

The Irish poet Séamus Heaney included the poem &quot;In Memoriam Seán Ó Riada&quot; in his 1979 collection &quot;Field Work&quot;. In 2008, a life-sized statue was erected in the grounds of Sépéil Naomh Gobnait, Cúil Aodha.

On 23 April 2010 Ceoltóirí Chualann reformed under the leadership of Peadar Ó Riada to play a tribute concert to Seán Ó Riada in Dublin&#x27;s Liberty Hall. In 2011, A festival, Féile na Laoch, was organised in his honour by his son, Peadar, between 30 September and 3 October in the honour of heroes (laochra) from the seven &#x27;Muses&#x27;: Storytelling, Sport, Singing, Poetry, Music, Dancing and Acting centring on Ó Riada. Two schools are named &#x27;Scoil Uí Riada&#x27; after him: a Gaelscoil in Kilcock, County Kildare, and another, in Bishopstown, Cork City.

<text>Catherine-Ann MacPhee (Cathy-Ann MacPhee; Scottish Gaelic: Catriona-Anna Nic a&#x27; Phi; born 1959) is a Scottish Gaelic singer from Barra in the Hebrides, now resident in Canada. She has worked in the theatre and broadcasting as well as giving musical performances in Scotland, England, Canada and elsewhere. After a period living in Ottawa she moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 2017.

==Acting career==

Catherine-Ann was born on 21 November 1959 in the Island of Barra, Scotland where she grew up with Scottish Gaelic as her first language. Electricity did not reach the island until she was six. At the age of five she started singing at candle-lit ceilidhs in the little village of Eoligarry. During the summer she sang for tourists. At the age of seventeen she joined &quot;Fir Chlis&quot; (Northern Lights). It was the first Scottish Gaelic repertory theatre company and did work for radio and television including the 1979 BBC Scotland Gaelic language course Can Seo. Following budget cuts the company ended after three years. She moved to the Isle of Mull, where she worked in a bar in Tobermory, but soon joined John McGrath&#x27;s English-speaking 7:84 theatre company. She traveled with them to Leningrad, Tbilisi, Toronto, Cape Breton and Berlin.

==The first Gaelic albums==

Ian Green from Greentrax Records heard her at a festival in Dingwall and offered a recording contract. Like her subsequent albums, all of the songs on &quot;Cànan Nan Gaidheal&quot; (The Language of the Gael) (1987) are in Gaelic, and most are traditional. One of the songs is by the Gaelic-speaking folk-rock group Runrig. The backing musicians include Tony Cuffe and William Jackson, both from the group Ossian.

Her second album, which is called &quot;Chi mi &#x27;n Geamhradh&quot; after the first song, written by Calum and Rory MacDonald of Runrig, contains mostly traditional songs, though it has been described as &quot;containing a bewildering range [in whose opinion?] of pop and New Age influences including drum machine, harp and bass guitar&quot;. It was probably the first time that &quot;waulking songs&quot; (work songs for women finishing tweed cloth) were treated this way.

The Mrs Ackyroyd Band is a loose association of singers who record perform comic parodies of folk music. In 1987 they undertook their only non-comic project, a song-cycle called &quot;The Stones of Callanish&quot;. MacPhee sang two of the songs on it.

==Màiri Mhór (1821–1898)==

The Highland Land League was an organisation devoted to resisting the Highland Clearances in the mid to late nineteenth century. Many songs were written by Màiri Mhór (Mary MacPherson) from Skye in support of their cause. In 1993 a biographical BBC TV film about Màiri Mhór was made in which Alyxis Daly played Màiri Mhór and MacPhee sang the soundtrack. In the following year the soundtrack album was released. Some of these Gaelic songs are about the landscape of the highlands and represent a farewell to a way of life. In 1997 she recorded a live album at the 50th anniversary of the Edinburgh Festival.

<doc id="1241423" wikidata="Q2338060" url="?curid=1241423" title="Gus Dudgeon">
<text>Angus Boyd &quot;Gus&quot; Dudgeon (30 September 1942 – 21 July 2002) was an English record producer, who oversaw many of Elton John&#x27;s most acclaimed recordings, including his commercial breakthrough, &quot;Your Song&quot;. Their collaboration led to seven US No. 1 albums, and established John as one of the most successful singles artists of the 1970s. 

Dudgeon also produced Chris Rea&#x27;s first hit, the US chart topping &quot;Fool (If You Think It&#x27;s Over)&quot;, and David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, and steered many other artists to chart success, including Joan Armatrading and Elkie Brooks. The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; cites Dudgeon as being the first person to use sampling in music production. He was a founding member of the Music Producers Guild.

==Early life and career==
Angus Boyd Dudgeon was born on 30 September 1942 in Woking, Surrey, England. After being expelled from Harrow School, he attended A. S. Neill&#x27;s experimental and democratic Summerhill School. Throughout his life, Dudgeon regularly attended reunions and actively supported the school. Shortly before his death, he recounted how after leaving school, he was fired from a number of jobs in quick succession, &quot;&#x27;cause I used to get bored and would leave without telling them. I worked in a toy store. I sold purple hearts on the streets of London—a pound for one hundred. I worked for a clip joint, an advertising agency. Just ridiculous jobs. I had no idea what I wanted to do&quot;. 

After seeing a job vacancy in the newspaper, his mother steered Dudgeon towards Olympic Studios where he worked as a tea boy. Within a few years he had worked his way up to a position as an in-house engineer at Decca&#x27;s studio in West Hampstead. In this capacity, he worked with the Artwoods, Bruce Channel, Davy Graham and Shirley Collins. Early pop successes included the Zombies&#x27; single &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot; (1964) and John Mayall&#x27;s album &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton&quot; (1966). He helped in the auditions for Tom Jones and the Rolling Stones. He rose to co-produce Ten Years After&#x27;s debut album in 1967. Around this time, he also produced the Bonzo Dog Band albums, &quot;The Doughnut in Granny&#x27;s Greenhouse&quot; and &quot;Tadpoles&quot;.

== Collaboration with Elton John ==
At the urging of producers Denny Cordell and Andrew Loog Oldham, Dudgeon moved into production, setting up Tuesday Productions in 1968. Two years later, he began working with Elton John, who had heard Dudgeon&#x27;s work on the as-yet-unreleased &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. Their first collaboration was &quot;Your Song&quot;, with Dudgeon elaborating the simple piano tune and adding an orchestral arrangement by Paul Buckmaster. It reached the US Top 10, becoming John&#x27;s first substantial hit, and kick-starting &quot;one of the most successful artist-producer pairings of all time, with Dudgeon guiding John throughout the decade and launching such blockbuster albums as &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot;, &quot;Honky Château&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;, and &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot;.

Elton John trusted Dudgeon’s production instincts to the point that the artist often left the studio after the piano and vocal tracks were laid down, &quot;leaving Dudgeon to create that unique synthesis of orchestral pop and Americana that defined many of John&#x27;s best recordings&quot;. The producer helped to &quot;make John the most successful singles artist of the 1970s, and No. 2 on the album charts behind Elvis Presley&quot;. Dudgeon and Elton John formed The Rocket Record Company and put out successful releases for Neil Sedaka and Kiki Dee. However, Dudgeon was sometimes critical of his and Elton John&#x27;s work, and is quoted in Elizabeth Rosenthal&#x27;s &quot;His Song: The Musical Journey of Elton John&quot; as castigating 1974&#x27;s &quot;Caribou&quot; (which he produced), saying that &quot;the sound is the worst, the songs are nowhere, the sleeve came out wrong, the lyrics weren&#x27;t that good, the singing wasn&#x27;t all there, the playing wasn&#x27;t great and the production is just plain lousy&quot;. Dudgeon and Elton John parted company in 1976, re-uniting in 1985 to produce three more albums together.

== Bowie, Brooks and sampling ==
After leaving Decca, where he had been an engineer on David Bowie&#x27;s debut, Dudgeon produced Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot; (1969). Tony Visconti agreed to produce the album, but not the single which he regarded as a novelty tune, and suggested Dudgeon instead. He went on to produce Michael Chapman&#x27;s first three albums, &quot;Rainmaker&quot; (1969), &quot;Fully Qualified Survivor&quot; (1970), and &quot;Wrecked Again&quot; (1971). Each of these albums features string arrangements by Buckmaster. His production of John Kongos&#x27; hit &quot;He&#x27;s Gonna Step on You Again&quot; (1971) used a tape loop of African tribal drumming. The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; recognised him as the first person to use sampling in music production. He was also credited by Bowie as the voice of the gnome on &quot;The Laughing Gnome&quot;.

In 1972, Dudgeon produced Joan Armatrading&#x27;s debut, &quot;Whatever&#x27;s for Us&quot;, written by Armatrading and her then collaborator Pam Nestor. He also produced two singles for the duo, &quot;Lonely Lady&quot; and &quot;Together in Words And Music&quot; (Cube Records, 7&quot; single, BUG-31). Both tracks were later added to the re-mastered CD of the &quot;Whatever&#x27;s For Us&quot; album (2001). He also produced two highly successful albums for Elkie Brooks: &quot;Pearls&quot; and &quot;Pearls II&quot;, the former peaking at No. 2 and remaining in the UK Albums Chart for 79 weeks. In 1980, Dudgeon started working with Mary Wilson of the Supremes on her second solo album. Four songs were recorded and produced, including a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Green River&quot;. Ultimately Motown Records dropped Wilson&#x27;s contract, and the masters were returned to her, the first time the company had ever done so. They were released in 2021 on &quot;Mary Wilson (Expanded Edition)&quot;.

== Other work ==
Dudgeon worked with a variety of acts, including Shooting Star, Audience, Chris Rea, Ralph McTell, Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan, Lindisfarne, Judith Durham, Fairport Convention, the Sinceros, the Beach Boys, Solution, Voyager, Steeleye Span and Angie Gold. 

In the late 1970s, he built Sol Studios, and also started working with alternative bands, including XTC, Menswear, and the Frank and Walters. In 1989, Dudgeon produced the debut solo album by Thomas Anders (ex-Modern Talking). At the time of his death, he was managing a band called Slinki Malinki.

== Personal style ==
In the 1960s, Dudgeon regularly shopped on Chelsea&#x27;s King&#x27;s Road, and had a reputation as a flamboyant, stylish and sophisticated dresser. Throughout his career, he worked mainly with solo artists and preferred to select artists, engineers and studios himself, allowing him to piece albums together. Considered to be a perfectionist, he was also calm and patient and liked to stop recording to socialize.

== Death ==
On 21 July 2002, Dudgeon and his wife, Sheila, died when their Jaguar veered off the M4 between Reading and Maidenhead. The inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death, noting that he was intoxicated and had possibly fallen asleep at the wheel while driving well in excess of the speed limit. He and his wife both suffered severe head injuries, were trapped in the car which landed in a storm drain, and may have drowned.

==Posthumous honours==
In 2002, the Gus Dudgeon Foundation for Recording Arts was established &quot;to preserve and promote music production techniques allowing students... to learn and pass on these skills for future generations&quot;. Jim Barrett, a lecturer at the University of Glamorgan, installed Dudgeon&#x27;s MCI mixing console in the Atrium building, &quot;a multi-million pound facility&quot;, where, at the 2009 Art of Record Production Conference, Joan Armatrading opened &quot;The Gus Dudgeon Suite&quot;. 

Elton John, Chris Hook, and Phil Harding each paid tribute to Dudgeon at the opening ceremony. Every summer, the university hosts a graduate recording course in Dudgeon&#x27;s honour, in collaboration with the audio education organisation JAMES. 

Joan Armatrading dedicated her 2003 album, &quot;Lovers Speak&quot;, to Gus Dudgeon and his wife Sheila. Elton John similarly dedicated his 2004 album, &quot;Peachtree Road&quot;.

<text>The girl next door is a young female stock character who is often used in romantic stories. She is named so because she often lives next door to the protagonist or is a childhood friend. They start out with a mutual friendship that later often develops into romantic attraction. A similar expression is &quot;&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
A girl-next-door character is often seen as natural and unpretentious. A trope that evokes nostalgia, it is associated with small towns and more local or even rural ways of life. The girl next door is often portrayed as innocent.

Actress and singer Doris Day, renowned for her rom-com film roles in the 1950s, is described as a pioneering embodiment of the girl-next-door image in film: regarded as &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s girl next door&quot;.

A common cliche is when a male protagonist is caught in a love triangle between two women, he will usually choose the &quot;sweet, ordinary, and caring girl next door&quot; he grew up with rather than a more well-off or beautiful woman with fewer morals. Other times, this character ignores the hero for another male character, despite being the object of his affections.

The character Mary Ann Summers from the TV show &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (portrayed by Dawn Wells) had the girl next door allure, in contrast with the more glamorous character Ginger Grant (portrayed by Tina Louise). Due to the popularity of the show and the two lead female characters, the question &quot;Ginger or Mary Ann?&quot; became shorthand for asking someone whether they preferred a girl-next-door type or a more glamorous type.

<doc id="1241431" wikidata="Q1139570" url="?curid=1241431" title="Matthew Bourne">
<text>Sir Matthew Christopher Bourne (born 13 January 1960) is a British choreographer. His productions contain many classic cinema and popular culture references and draw thematic inspiration from musicals, film noir and popular culture.

Popular novels and films usually form the basis for his work but Bourne&#x27;s dance adaptations are &quot;sui generis&quot;, distinct from their originals. For example, his 1995 restaging of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot; updated the ballet&#x27;s setting, narrative and famously used all-male swans.

Workshops, collaboration and the innevitable dialogue with the original works inform many of his adaption&#x27;s choreographical routines and thematic concepts. For his 1997 reimagining of Cinderella, Bourne invoked the Victorian and Edwardian eras by disseminating certain books and novels from those time periods amongst the production&#x27;s cast members.

His New Adventures dance company&#x27;s work covers ballet, contemporary dance, dance theatre and musical theatre.

His adaptations of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;Dorian Gray&quot;, and &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; added new dimensions to these near-ubiquitous stories. Bourne&#x27;s recent work, &quot;The Midnight Bell&quot;, sets Patrick Hamilton&#x27;s 1929 novel in a pub, and Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; put the tragedy&#x27;s mental health and youth suicide themes centre stage.

In 2016, he was knighted as part of Queen Elizabeth II 2016 New Year Honours list for &#x27;Services to Dance&#x27;.

==Early life and influences==
Bourne was born on January 13, 1960, in Hackney, London, England.
His mother was a secretary and his father worked for Thames Water. 
Bourne had no formal ballet training during his childhood. However, as a teenager, he was passionate about show business. He would frequently autograph hunt in London&#x27;s West End after his mother took him to see &quot;Dame Edith Evans and Friends&quot; in 1974 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. He wrote to and received letters back from Joan Crawford, Charlie Chaplin and Bette Davis. He was eighteen when he attended Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre to see his first ballet, &quot;Swan Lake&quot;.

He worked as a filing clerk at the BBC and as an usher at The National Theatre for four years after graduating from William Fitt and Sir George Monoux School in Walthamstow, London. 
At 20 he started studying at London&#x27;s Laban Centre and began dance classes at 22. In 1985, he toured for two years with the centre&#x27;s dance company. However, his interests gradually shifted from dancing to choreographing for television, theatre, and other dance companies.
He completed a BA honours degree in contemporary dance in 1985. And in 1986, he graduated with an MA in dance performance. He co-founded the London-based company Adventures in Motion Pictures (AMP) in 1987.
Bourne&#x27;s radical reinterpretations of classic ballets set him apart as a choreographer. In 1992, he placed the Christmas Eve scene of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; in a Victorian orphanage reminiscent of a Charles Dickens novel. His 1994 version of Filippo Taglioni&#x27;s &quot;La Sylphide&quot; titled &quot;Highland Fling&quot;, was set in a modern-day Glaswegien housing project. &quot;Highland Fling&quot; was also the beginning of Bourne&#x27;s creative alliance with the designer Lez Brotherston.

==Style and process==
Bourne&#x27;s work primarily concerns clarity of exposition, characterisation, technical staging and cinematic devices. Thematically, his work draws on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals, film noir and Alfred Hitchcock, among others.
Bourne&#x27;s career trajectory shifted after his time at the Laban Centre, where he honed his signature theatrical style. His work stood in contrast to the more provocative dance styles of the 1980s, associated with artists such as Michael Clark and Lloyd Newson&#x27;s DV8 Physical Theatre. Instead, Bourne&#x27;s style centred on romance, wit, and tangible drama, as demonstrated in his adaptation of Swan Lake.

Bourne&#x27;s New Adventure&#x27;s troupe consists of both ballet and modern dancers who perform intricate choreography that stems from the character&#x27;s actions and movements.

Bourne&#x27;s works often convert written works into physical, visual, and musical forms, initiating a dialogue between the adaptation and the original work by actively emphasising the relationship between the two. Moreover, because his work uses many classic cinema and popular culture references, its impact largely depends on the viewer&#x27;s relationship to the original work.

===Process===
Since the start of his career, Bourne&#x27;s approach has involved a collaborative process with his dancers and creative-partners. In 2007, Sam Archer and Richard Winsor, portraying Edward in the initial &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; performances, confirmed that Bourne still uses this approach; where in a piece&#x27;s embryonic stage, Bourne assigns the dancers tasks like creating individual dance steps that eventually form part of the choreography.

==Notable works==
===&quot;Nutcracker!&quot;===

In Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Nutcracker!&quot;, a dance adaptation of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; first staged in 1992, Clara inhabits a black-and-white orphanage under the rule of a stern matron and Dr. Dross. Somehow, Clara&#x27;s Nutcracker doll transforms into a young man who leads her on a journey to Sweetieland, a fictional location where sweets and confectionary represent pleasure and desire. In this world, earlier characters reappear as sweets in a visually striking setting created by Anthony Ward, combining elements of the graphic novel with surreal, vibrant colors.

Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Nutcracker!&quot; blends ballet, folk dance and mime in elaborately choreographed movements. The performance references the Norwegian figure skater Sonja Henie and Les Patineurs to form a tableau reminiscent of The Nutcracker&#x27;s original choreographers, Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov.

===&quot;Swan Lake&quot;===
In 1995, AMP premiered Bourne&#x27;s restaging of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. In his updated version, he placed the prince in a contemporary dysfunctional family and had him fall in love with a male swan. Drawing inspiration from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music and nature, Bourne portrayed swans as large, aggressive, and powerful creatures, danced by bare-chested men wearing knee-length shorts made of shredded silk resembling feathers. This was a significant departure from the traditional portrayal of swans by young women in romantic white costumes. Swan Lake won the 1996 Laurence Olivier Award for best new dance production, and the production won 1999&#x27;s 53rd Tony Awards for direction and choreography after it opened on Broadway in 1998. The ballet toured internationally multiple times in the early 21st century.

===&quot;Cinderella&quot;===
Bourne&#x27;s reinterpretation of this classic fairytale is set in wartime London. Premiered at the Piccadilly Theatre, London in September 1997. 
Bourne provided his dancers with books and films about &quot;Cinderella&quot; and the Victorian and Edwardian eras that influenced his version. Bourne&#x27;s research into previous interpretations and historical contexts contributed to a historically informed performance. Bourne favoured the 1977 Royal Ballet version, appreciating its drama and narrative pace, despite its longer duration.
===&quot;The Car Man&quot;===
Bourne&#x27;s dance interpretation of Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; titled &quot;The Car Man&quot;, premiered at The Royal Albert Hall in 2000.

The narrative revolves around Luca, a drifter who finds himself in a love triangle with Lana, the wife of a local garage owner, and Angelo, a young man grappling with his identity in the town&#x27;s hypermasculine environment. Typical of Bourne productions, the production blends genres, dotting film, ballet, and musical references amongst its retro visual designs.

Larger productions use a flexible multi-tier set construction incorporating a live orchestra and billboard screens, allowing for a seamless transition between scenes and creating a thrust stage.

The production&#x27;s soundtrack merges compositions from Rodion Shchedrin&#x27;s &quot;Carmen Suite&quot; with sound effects, thus functioning as both an orchestral score and a cinematic soundtrack. This blend of audio elements contributes to the atmosphere and progression of the narrative.

&quot;The Car Man&#x27;s&quot; most recent cast includes Zizi Strallen as Lana, Will Bozier as Luca, and Paris Fitzpatrick as Angelo. The choreography is deeply integrated into the storytelling, with initial group numbers establishing the setting, before individual interactions become the narrative&#x27;s driving force. Notably, the carnal encounters between Luca, Lana, and Angelo, choreographed with great intensity and physicality, propel the story forward.

In the spirit of classic melodrama, the narrative threads of lust, deceit, and violence intertwine, leading to a second act dominated by themes of guilt and revenge. The production&#x27;s duality mirrors the character of Luca, who compellingly embodies multiple aspects of the narrative&#x27;s nuanced exploration of desire and identity.

===&quot;Play Without Words&quot;===

&quot;Play Without Words&quot; debuted in 2002 as part of the National Theatre&#x27;s Transformation season, aimed at attracting a younger audience. The production, a dance work, drew inspiration from 1960s British new wave cinema. It featured an atmospheric jazz score by Terry Davies and was largely influenced by Joseph Losey&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;The Servant&quot;. This film, scripted by Harold Pinter, explored class and power dynamics through the story of a young upper-class man who hires a Cockney valet to manage his townhouse, a relationship that implodes due to the valet&#x27;s manipulation.

Bourne&#x27;s unique approach involved casting each character multiple times, concurrently revealing different and sometimes contradictory aspects of their personalities. This technique created an environment where reality and fantasy coexisted, resulting in a narrative reminiscent of Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s work in &quot;Performance&quot;.

The plotline follows Prentice, the manservant, as he caters to his employer, Anthony&#x27;s needs while simultaneously scheming his downfall. Bourne&#x27;s choreography intensifies during these scenes, highlighting the characters&#x27; dynamic interactions.

Certain scenes highlight the ambiguous relationships between the characters. For instance, Prentice&#x27;s friend Speight seduces Anthony&#x27;s neglected fiancée, Glenda, though his actions hint at more complex motivations. Speight is presented as an embodiment of an evolving, sexually egalitarian future.

Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Play Without Words&quot;&#x27; pessimistic tone was a stark contrast to the Cultural Olympiad&#x27;s more optimistic works. The production encouraged audience immersion and encouraged audience members to dress in attire inspired by the 1960s British cinema.

===&quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;===

Bourne&#x27;s Edward dance adaptation of Tim Burton&#x27;s film debuted in 2005. The story follows the tale of a boy with scissors for hands created by an inventor in a gothic workshop. The boy, Edward, played by Dominic North, is welcomed into 1950s suburban America in a fictional town called Hope Springs. Bourne subtly caricatured the social life and mannerisms of the time realised through Lez Brotherston&#x27;s costumes and stage designs.

The protagonist&#x27;s dance movement arc progresses from a robotic goofiness akin to pantomime to confidence as his suburban community accepts him. But finally descends into theatrical despair after Kim and the town&#x27;s community reject him.

The production&#x27;s highlights included Edward&#x27;s dream, where momentarily free of his scissor hands, he performs a duet with Kim flanked by dancers dressed as Edward&#x27;s topiary art. 
Terry Davies based the score on themes from the movie score by Danny Elfman.

===&quot;Dorian Gray&quot;===

Bourne&#x27;s adaptation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; in 2008 highlights the combination of celebrity and youth that lead to Wilde&#x27;s protagonist&#x27;s downfall.

Bourne&#x27;s concept originated from a male duet workshop titled &quot;Romeo and Romeo&quot;. The dancers&#x27; contributions and the choreographical ideas that emerged from the workshop, with some minor changes, formed the final production of &quot;Dorian Gray&quot;. Therefore, in the performance&#x27;s original programme, Bourne credited both himself and his company for the production&#x27;s choreography.
Richard Winsor, who played Dorian, and Jason Piper, who portrayed Basil Hallward in the ballet&#x27;s second iteration, both participated in the &quot;Romeo &amp; Romeo&quot; workshop.

Moreover, he began to refine Wilde&#x27;s narrative&#x27;s intricate plot and themes during conversations with long-term collaborator Lez Brotherston. Bourne attests that their adaptation preserves most of Wilde&#x27;s original work, particularly the novel&#x27;s central theme of a handsome young man&#x27;s internal corruption.

The desire to modernise the narrative raised several discussions about which time period might work best for their reimaging. Initially, they considered setting their adaptation in the 1960s because both Bourne and Brotherston often revisit this period in their work. However, they decided to set their rendering in the present. Later, Bourne admitted the piece&#x27;s contemporary setting brought an element of apprehension.

In his adaptation of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, Bourne changes Sybil Vane to a male ballet dancer called Cyril and he rewrites Lord Henry as a female magazine editor who wields considerable power.

The plotline of Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Dorian Grey&quot; also differs slightly from Wilde&#x27;s. In Bourne&#x27;s adaptation, the portrait reflecting the protagonist&#x27;s inner state, transforms into Dorian&#x27;s doppelgänger. Dorian&#x27;s doppelgänger incrementally poses a threat to Dorian&#x27;s position as a figure of public and private adoration. Ultimately, rather than destroy the painting like he does in Wilde&#x27;s original, Bourne&#x27;s contemporary Dorian Grey stabs his doppelgänger in front of the paparazzi.

The Doppelgänger first appears after Dorian&#x27;s involvement in his lover Cyril&#x27;s drug overdose. The doppelganger&#x27;s presence increases thereafter. At several points
Dorian scrutinises his own actions by observing the actions of his Doppelgänger from a dissociative state.

In contrast to Wilde&#x27;s original novel, by introducing a Doppelgänger into the plot bourne reframes the protagonist&#x27;s conflict as an internal conflict with himself, his nature and his values.

====Reception====
The production broke the Edinburgh International Festival&#x27;s biggest-selling dance event record. Mark Morris set the festival&#x27;s previous record of 10,146 tickets for his &quot;The Hard Nut&quot; in 1995. At the time, &quot;The Herald&quot; reported that Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Dorian Grey&quot; sold 11,212 tickets.

Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Dorian Grey&quot; and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s original work faced similar criticism; both Wilde&#x27;s original and Bourne&#x27;s adaptation parodied the excess and superficiality of celebrity culture;but some critics still derided the performance&#x27;s choreography for how it depicted the traits central to its protagonist&#x27;s narcissism. The challenge of satirising a subject without adopting its criticised traits has featured heavily in the subsequent analysis of Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Dorian Grey&quot;.

===&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;===
Bourne&#x27;s 2011 adaptation of William Golding&#x27;s classic illustrates masculinity&#x27;s savagery-inducing effects in a way that words cannot. 
Unlike previous Bourne productions. The Theatre Royal approached the Bourne&#x27;s New Adventures charitable arm, ReBourne, to stage the show with Scottish Arts Council funding and a cast including some young men who had never danced before. The project&#x27;s goal was to stage a production of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; that drew on the talent pool of the cities where it was shown.
Typical of Bourne&#x27;s adaptations, as director, he chooses to set his &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; in a deserted theatre. The boy&#x27;s reasons for being trapped in a deserted theatre are unclear. Nor is it apparent why this abandoned theatre has a decaying pig&#x27;s head. But in this new setting, Golding&#x27;s characters find themselves scavenging for mini ice cream tubs in this new setting.

===&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;===
Bourne drew on many sources of inspiration when creating &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; in 2012, as did his dancers for their characters. He read multiple versions of the story, noting commonalities and differences. While he ignored the second half of Perrault&#x27;s original, he found the Grimm version, titled &quot;Little Briar Rose&quot;, closer to the well-known story. The Disney animated film also took liberties, such as omitting the 100-year sleep. Bourne incorporated elements from each of these versions into his production.
He addressed perceived shortfalls in the original story, crediting Walt Disney for rectifying them in the 1959 animated version. The historical timeframe of Bourne&#x27;s narrative provided anchor points for movement styles. Aurora&#x27;s christening is set in 1890, her coming-of-age party in 1911, and her awakening in a modern-day gothic nightmare.
The story starts with a childless King and Queen seeking help from the evil fairy Carabosse, who leaves Aurora on the palace&#x27;s doorstep. The fairies bestow qualities reinforcing her free-spirited nature. Bourne&#x27;s version encompasses themes of good versus evil, sleep, rebirth, and vampires. Carabosse&#x27;s son, Caradoc, is introduced to maintain the malign theme, forming a love triangle with Leo. Themes of sleep and rebirth appear in both versions, with one fairy named Hibernia, the Fairy of Rebirth, emphasising this connection.

Bourne&#x27;s original 2012 cast featured Dominic North as Leo and Hannah Vassallo as Aurora.
The score was adapted and supplemented with additional sound effects.

====2022 staging====
In 2022 Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; returned to Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre for a seven-week residency.

===&quot;The Red Shoes&quot;===

Bourne&#x27;s 2016 adaptation of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; is based on the iconic Powell and Pressburger film and inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale of the same name about a pair of red shoes that enhance their owner&#x27;s dancing abilities but at a cost.

Lez Brotherston designed the set to resemble the grandeur of an opera house. And Terry Davies incorporated Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s more obscure soundtracks to create an atmospheric score performed by New Adventures&#x27; 16-piece orchestra conducted by Brett Morris. 

The adaptation premiered in Plymouth on November 21, 2016, starring Ashley Shaw as Victoria Page.

The two-act performance glimpses a theatre&#x27;s inner workings and the sacrifice required for seamless performances. For example, early in the performance, the spotlight voyeuristically tracks the company&#x27;s prima ballerina assoluta, Michela Meazza, as she wafts, waves and flutters a &quot;La Sylphide&quot;-styled tutu&#x27;s fairy wings emulating the imminent performance&#x27;s movements.

After its initial run, The Red Shoes toured the UK and internationally.

====2019 tour====
Bourne&#x27;s company reprised Red Shoes for an International tour at the end of 2019. Adam Cooper returned to New Adventures for the 2019 tour to reprise his erotic, dangerous swan role.
However, after a final performance at Wimbledon, the tour ended abruptly due to Covid 19 restrictions on March 14, 2020.

====Remote staging====
The cast created a condensed twelve-minute version of The Red Shoes during the 2020 lockdown. They performed in various home settings, including living rooms, gardens, and kitchens. This version&#x27;s performers wore casual attire like football kits, homemade outfits, and towels.

===&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;===
Renderings of William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy about teen suicide typically highlight the family feud as the reason for the protagonist&#x27;s joint suicide while ignoring their death&#x27;s most probable explanation; two young people forcibly separated at a difficult point in their lives. During rehearsals Bourne repeatedly rewrote Shakespeare&#x27;s plot and scenario, eventually settling for a gender-segregated institution akin to a psychiatric hospital. It isn&#x27;t clear exactly what type of institution it is, but Bourne speculated that it could be, “A borstal, a prison, a school, something to do with mental health? An excess of feeling is frowned upon – there may be young people who have too much feeling.” What is clear are the physical and sexual power structures binding this institution. For example, Tybalt, a prison guard, sexually assaults Juliet and the ballet&#x27;s choreography uses rigidly synchronised motions to underscore its character&#x27;s incarceration. Brotherston&#x27;s set consists of an austere white-tile-clad stage flanked by doors, a balcony, staircases and circled by white fencing. First staged in 2019, Cordelia Braithwaite portrays Juliet as an intense red-haired girl. While the twitchy, troubled Romeo is there because his mother and father wish to disassociate themselves from their embarrassing son.
Like the Kenneth MacMillan version before it, a homoerotic bond between Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, and Balthasar is also present in Bourne&#x27;s version.

===&quot;The Midnight Bell&quot;===
Bourne&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Bell&quot; is an adaptation of Patrick Hamilton&#x27;s 1929 novel &quot;The Midnight Bell&quot;, which is not to be confused with Francis Lathom&#x27;s gothic novel of the same name. 
Bourne subtitled the piece &quot;Intoxicated Tales from Darkest Soho&quot;, and set it in a smokey 1930s London pub called The Midnight Bell. The narrative centres on ten of Hamilton&#x27;s original characters&#x27; intertwined lives. The performance introduces its characters through their professions or societal roles. They are primarily individuals seeking social connection and solace from their circumstances in their local pub. The two acts depict the character&#x27;s personal struggles, dreams, and the evolution of their relationships over one month. The piece&#x27;s most notable character arcs and performances were Bryony Wood&#x27;s portrayal of a young prostitute, Michela Meazza&#x27;s depiction of Miss Roach, the lonesome spinster and George Harvey Bone, the deranged killer played by Richard Winsor.

== Career ==
Matthew Bourne is best known for his unique re-imaginings of traditional ballet, such as his 1995 production of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, where he replaced the traditionally female corps-de-ballet with a male ensemble. Swan Lake (Bourne) went on to be the longest-running ballet in London&#x27;s West End and New York City&#x27;s Broadway. The production earned him the title as the only British director to win both &#x27;Best Choreographer&#x27; and &#x27;Best Director&#x27; in the same year at the 1999 Tony Awards. On the iconic appeal of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; at the time, The New Yorker said, &#x27;what was important about the gender switch was that it made this old love story romantic again, by making it seem dangerous.&#x27;

His admirers say that he has &#x27;broadened the definition of ballet in a way that has consistently appealed to young audiences&#x27;.

Since 1986, Bourne has worked in dance, musical theatre and film with his dance companies New Adventures and AMP, as well as choreographed musicals for West End Theatre such as &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Productions include &quot;The Red Shoes (ballet)&quot;, &quot;The Car Man (Bourne)&quot; (based on Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;) and &quot;Edward Scissorhands (dance)&quot; among many others. The company has reimagined many traditional Tchaikovsky ballets, such as &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, placing them in a new, cinematic context to enliven their potential for storytelling for a modern audience. Bourne has also adapted famous cinema and literature for the stage, such as a dance version of Tim Burton&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, Hans Christian Andersen and Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;The Red Shoes (1948 film)&quot; and Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;.

Bourne is described after an interview with the New Yorker in 2007 as a particularly &#x27;audience-conscious artist&#x27;. Bourne highlights the importance of intervals for the audience, &quot;in the second half they&#x27;re always more demonstrative, because they&#x27;ve talked to their friends and decided that it&#x27;s O.K. to enjoy it.&quot; He also explains how he always asks company dancers to offer warmth in their curtain calls, saying, &quot;I pride myself on my company&#x27;s curtain calls, I really do. I think you won&#x27;t see a nicer curtain call than from my lot.&quot;

=== New Adventures ===

A group of Laban graduates established the company, formerly known as &#x27;Adventures in Motion Pictures&#x27; in 1987. After the success of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, AMP (Adventures in Motion Pictures) was heading down a highly commercial route. Long-running international tours of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; meant the company felt headed for world domination, which made Bourne uneasy, &quot;I felt that I was running an office rather than a company&quot;. The pressure to create highly profitable productions left Bourne feeling creatively stifled. Feeling the need to be closer to his productions and seeking room to experiment and work with a smaller team, Bourne and AMP&#x27;s co-director Katherine Doré eventually made the decision to split.

In 2000, he started a new company, New Adventures, which was officially formed with Managing Director Robert Noble OBE (also Deputy Managing Director of Cameron Mackintosh) and Bourne&#x27;s long time collaborator, and former dancer, Etta Murfitt MBE as Associate Artistic Director. This enabled Bourne and the company to scale down and create low budget shows, working in close collaboration with the dancers and artists who contribute hugely to his creative process. Esteemed dance critic Judith Mackrell notes, &#x27;there were moments in his career when Bourne could easily have let himself become a commercial commodity and squandered his talent.

Its notable members include the Canadian dancer and critic Lynn Seymour. Often described as &quot;one of the greatest dramatic ballerinas of the 20th century&quot;, Seymour, reportedly took a liking to Bourne&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and asked Bourne if she could play the part of Queen. The following year Seymour played a Bette Davis-inspired Stepmother in Bourne&#x27;s adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;. And reprised the stepmother role in Bourne&#x27;s 2017 version.

== Personal life ==

Bourne started his dance training at the relatively late age of 22, and trained at Trinity Laban in London. Before that he describes himself as self-taught, saying &quot;my first ever dance class was my audition for dance college when I was 21&quot;.

As a teenager he would take the bus to the West End to collect autographs. Bourne attended the London Gay Teenage Group in Holloway, North London. He spoke about this on the Jo Whiley show on BBC Radio 2 in 2018.

As of 2015 Bourne is in a long-term relationship with contemporary dance choreographer Arthur Pita, who has been described as the &quot;David Lynch of dance&quot;. Pita says of their relationship, &quot;we talk about work a lot, but it&#x27;s never competitive, our styles are so different&quot;. The two met through Bourne&#x27;s production of Swan Lake, when Bourne was director and Arthur was a swan.

In addition to his 2016 knighthood, Bourne has received multiple awards and award nominations, including the Laurence Olivier Award, Tony Award, and Drama Desk Award, and has also received several honorary doctorates of arts from UK universities.

<text>Sir Ellis Hovell Minns, FBA (16 July 1874 – 13 June 1953) was a British academic and archaeologist whose studies focused on Eastern Europe.

Educated at Charterhouse, he went to Pembroke College, Cambridge studying the Classical tripos including Slavonic and Russian. He lived briefly in Paris before moving to St Petersburg in 1898 to work in the library of the Imperial Archaeological Commission. Returning to Cambridge in 1901 he began lecturing in Classics.

In 1925 he gave the Sandars Lectures on bibliography, choosing as a topic the influence of materials and instruments upon writing.

In 1927, he was appointed Disney Professor of Archaeology, a post he held until 1938. He wrote widely with books including &quot;Scythians and Greeks&quot; (1913) and &quot;The Art of the Northern Nomads&quot; (1944). He was an authority on Slavonic icons and in 1943 cleared the Russian translation engraved on the ceremonial &quot;Sword of Stalingrad&quot; presented by the British people in homage to the defenders of the Russian city.

In the 1945 New Year Honours, Minns was appointed a Knight Bachelor, and thereby granted the title &quot;sir&quot;.

<doc id="1241434" wikidata="Q7574109" url="?curid=1241434" title="Spatula Mundani">
<text>The Spatula Mundani was a surgical device invented in the 17th century by the London surgeon James Woodall to treat extreme cases of severe constipation where purgatives had failed. Woodall believed that the cause of this malady was from scurvy, but speculation is that many of the cases were from the abuse of laudanum, a tincture of opium in alcohol commonly used at the time as a painkiller; opioid drugs are known to cause constipation by reducing gut motility. A drawing of the device is found in his 1617 book .

The device was an iron tool slightly longer than 12 inches and consisted of a paddle at one end. The other end was spoon-shaped, with the center removed and a knob at the end. The spoon end was used to extract the &quot;hard excrements&quot; while the other was used for applying ointments, no doubt necessary after undergoing a procedure with this instrument.

The term &quot;mundani&quot; is apparently derived from the archaic term which appeared in a dictionary from 1604 with the definition &quot;to make clean&quot;.

On an archaeological dig at the Jamestown, Virginia, colonies a spatula mundani was found, and documents from 1608 report that it was part of a chest of surgeon&#x27;s tools sent by Woodall to the colonies.

<doc id="1241442" wikidata="Q11083119" url="?curid=1241442" title="Urn">
<text>An urn is a vase, often with a cover, with a typically narrowed neck above a rounded body and a footed pedestal. Describing a vessel as an &quot;urn&quot;, as opposed to a vase or other terms, generally reflects its use rather than any particular shape or origin. The term is especially often used for funerary urns, vessels used in burials, either to hold the cremated ashes or as grave goods, but is used in many other contexts.

Large sculpted vases are often called urns, whether placed outdoors, in gardens or as architectural ornaments on buildings, or kept inside. In catering, large vessels for serving tea or coffee are often called &quot;tea-urns&quot;, even when they are metal cylinders of purely functional design.

Urns are also a common reference in thought experiments in probability wherein marbles or balls of different colors are used to represent different results and the urn represents the &quot;container&quot; of the whole set of possible states.

==Funerary==
Funerary urns (also called cinerary urns and burial urns) have been used by many civilizations. After death, corpses are cremated, and the ashes are collected and put in an urn. Pottery urns, dating from about 7000 BC, have been found in an early Jiahu site in China, where a total of 32 burial urns are found, and another early finds are in Laoguantai, Shaanxi. There are about 700 burial urns unearthed over the Yangshao (5000–3000 BC) areas and consisting more than 50 varieties of form and shape. The burial urns were used mainly for children, but also sporadically for adults.

The Urnfield culture ( – 750 BC), a late Bronze Age culture of central Europe, takes its name from its large cemeteries of urn burials. The discovery of a Bronze Age urn burial in Norfolk, England, prompted Sir Thomas Browne to describe the antiquities found. He expanded his study to survey burial and funerary customs, ancient and current, and published it as &quot;Hydriotaphia or Urn Burial&quot; (1658).

In ancient Greece, cremation was usual, and the ashes were typically placed in a painted Greek vase. In particular, the &quot;lekythos&quot;, the shape of vase, was used for holding oil in funerary rituals. Romans placed the urns in a niche in a collective tomb called a &quot;columbarium&quot; (literally, dovecote). The interior of a dovecote usually has niches to house doves. Cremation urns were also commonly used in early Anglo Saxon England, and in many Pre-Columbian cultures.

In some later European traditions, a king&#x27;s heart, and sometimes other organs, could be placed in one or more urns upon his death, as happened with King Otto of Bavaria in 1916, and buried in a different place from the body, to symbolize a particular affection for the place by the departed.

In the modern funeral industry, cremation urns of varying quality, elaborateness, and cost are offered, and urns are another source of potential profit for an industry concerned that a trend toward cremation might threaten profits from traditional burial ceremonies. Biodegradable urns are sometimes used for both human and animal burial. They are made from eco-friendly materials such as recycled or handmade paper, salt, cellulose or other natural products that are capable of decomposing back into natural elements, and sometimes include a seed intended to grow into a tree at the site of the burial.

Besides the traditional funeral or cremation ashes urns, it may also be possible to keep a part of the ashes of the loved one or beloved pet in keepsake urns or ash jewellery, although this might be banned in some localities as the law of certain countries may prohibit keeping any human remains in a private residence. It is even, in some places, possible to place the ashes of two people in so-called companion urns. Cremation or funeral urns are made from a variety of materials such as wood, nature stone, ceramic, glass, or steel.

==Figural==

A figural urn is a style of vase or larger container where the basic urn shape, of either a classic amphora or a crucible style, is ornamented with figures. These may be attached to the main body, forming handles or simply extraneous decorations, or may be shown in relief on the body itself.

==Trophies, tea and fashion==
The Ashes, the prize in the biennial Test cricket competition between England and Australia, are contained in a miniature urn.

Urns are a common form of architectural detail and garden ornament. Well-known ornamental urns include the Waterloo Vase.

A tea urn is a heated metal container traditionally used to brew tea or boil water in large quantities in factories, canteens or churches. They are not usually found in domestic use. Like a samovar it has a small tap near the base for extracting either tea or hot water. Unlike an electric water boiler, tea may be brewed in the vessel itself, although they are equally likely to be used to fill a large teapot.

In Neoclassical furniture, it was a large wooden vase-like container which was usually set on a pedestal on either side of a side table. This was the characteristic of Adam designs and also of Hepplewhite&#x27;s work. Sometimes they were &quot;knife urns&quot;, where the top lifted off, and cutlery was stored inside. Urns were also used as decorative turnings at the cross points of stretchers in 16th and 17th century furniture designs. The urn and the vase were often set on the central pedestal in a &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;swan&#x27;s&quot; neck pediment. &quot;Knife urns&quot; placed on pedestals flanking a dining-room sideboard were an English innovation for high-style dining rooms of the late 1760s. They went out of fashion in the following decade, in favour of knife boxes that were placed on the sideboard.

<text>Cape Maria van Diemen is the westernmost point of the North Island of New Zealand. A tombolo, it was originally an island composed mainly of basaltic-andesitic lava flows and dykes. Drifting sands joined it to the rest of the North Island during the late Pleistocene.

The cape was named by Abel Tasman, (first European explorer to discover New Zealand) after the wife of his patron, Anthony van Diemen, Governor General of Batavia (now Jakarta) in January 1643, on the same voyage of discovery during which he named Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania). It is - along with the Three Kings Islands - one of only two geographic features in New Zealand to retain the names given to them by Tasman.

==Climate==
Cape Maria van Diemen normally has a subtropical climate, but it is the most northerly part of New Zealand in which snowfall has been reported.

<text>Andre &quot;Angel&quot; Melendez (May 1, 1971 – March 17, 1996) was a member of the Club Kids who lived and worked in New York City. He was killed by Michael Alig and Robert &quot;Freeze&quot; Riggs on March 17, 1996. His life and death have inspired several pieces of media, including books, films, music, and television.

==Life==
Melendez and his family arrived in New York from Colombia when Melendez was eight years old. Melendez purportedly became a drug dealer during the early 1990s after he met Peter Gatien, owner of The Limelight and several other nightclubs in New York City, and became a regular dealer in Gatien&#x27;s clubs. He was frequently seen at Manhattan clubs wearing his signature feathered wings.

==Death==
On Sunday, March 17, 1996, Melendez approached Michael Alig and Robert D. &quot;Freeze&quot; Riggs for money Melendez was purportedly owed. According to various statements, the confrontation became violent and Melendez got the better of Alig, who cried out for help. Riggs then hit Melendez on the head with a hammer, three times (until Melendez &quot;went down&quot;), after which Alig smothered him (either with a pillow or sweatshirt, depending upon the source), poured a &quot;cleaner or chemical&quot; into his mouth, then covered Melendez&#x27;s mouth with duct tape.

Alig and Riggs stripped Melendez&#x27;s body and placed it in the bathtub, where it remained for 5–7 days. According to Riggs, he then purchased &quot;two chef knives and one cleaver&quot; at Macy&#x27;s, with which he said Alig dismembered Melendez&#x27;s legs. The two then wrapped the legs in garbage bags, placed them into individual duffle bags and dumped in the Hudson River.

The following day, Alig and Riggs wrapped the upper body in a sheet and plastic garbage bag, placed it in a cardboard box from which Riggs had removed the UPC code, and together took the heavy box down in the elevator and through the main lobby. They then placed it in the trunk of a Yellow Cab &quot;that happened to be right outside the door.&quot; Riggs confessed &quot;We took the body to the Westside Highway around 25th Street. The taxi drove off, and we threw the box into the river.&quot;

However, Alig gave some conflicting details. For example, he stated he used liquid Drano (and baking soda) to combat the smell of the malodorous decomposition after the body had been in the bathtub for several days. At first, Alig claimed the killing was in self-defense, but he later admitted to having committed manslaughter. 

In the documentary film &quot;Glory Daze&quot; (2015), the police recount the discovery by a group of children at the beach at Miller Field, Staten Island, of a box containing the remains of Melendez, in March 1996. (&quot;American Justice&quot; reports the box was found in April 1996.) A tropical storm had helped propel the floating, cork-lined box to Staten Island.

Mainstream media began covering Melendez&#x27;s disappearance when the victim&#x27;s brother and father turned to the press for help and interest grew in rumors – perpetuated by Alig himself and first publicized to outsiders by Michael Musto as a blind item in his &quot;Village Voice&quot; column – that Alig and Riggs had murdered Melendez. The coincidental discovery, on Friday, September 8, 1996, of another dismembered body, fished out of the Harlem River at a pier near 134th Street by a homeless woman, sparked police to begin investigating the case in earnest. A police officer in Staten Island, who caught the Melendez media coverage, initiated an investigation of the John Doe found at Miller Field. The Staten Island Police Department used dental records to identify Melendez (whose body the coroner had mis-identified as that of an Asian male); on November 2, 1996, the mutilated corpse was positively identified as Melendez, and details of the rumors about how Melendez was killed were confirmed.

In the face of increasing police scrutiny, Alig fled to Toms River, New Jersey, where he moved into a motel room with his boyfriend, a drug dealer named Brian. On December 5, 1996, the police arrested Alig at the motel and hours later, Riggs in Manhattan. Alig insisted to the police he and Riggs had killed Melendez in self-defense, and disposed of the body in a panic. (This story contrasts sharply with the account Alig had given the victim&#x27;s brother, John (&quot;Johnny&quot;) Melendez, in an August 1996 conversation secretly taped by the District Attorney&#x27;s office, implicating &quot;Melendez and club czar Gatien in a drug-dealing venture at Gatien&#x27;s nightspots,&quot; and charging &quot;that Riggs killed Melendez for Gatien because &#x27;Peter is in trouble right now for drugs&#x27; and &#x27;Angel knew everything and he was threatening to go to...his friend at the &quot;Village Voice&quot; and tell him all this stuff.&quot;) Prosecutors were hesitant to charge Alig with first-degree murder, as they still hoped he would testify against his former boss, Gatien, who had been arrested for allowing drugs to be sold in his nightclubs. They eventually offered both Alig and Riggs a plea deal: a sentence of 10 to 20 years if they accepted the lesser charge of manslaughter. On October 1, 1997, both pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 10 to 20 years. (&quot;American Justice&quot; reports they pleaded guilty and were sentenced on September 10, 1997.) Because of their convictions, Alig and Riggs were not used as prosecution witnesses in Gatien&#x27;s trial.

===Convictions, prison, and aftermath===
On October 1, 1997, Alig and Riggs were sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison for Melendez&#x27;s killing, after each pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter. Riggs was released on parole in 2010, Alig on May 5, 2014.

On December 24, 2020, Alig died of a drug overdose at the age of 54.

<doc id="1241465" wikidata="Q1458730" url="?curid=1241465" title="Gourmet">
<text>Gourmet (, ) is a cultural idea associated with the culinary arts of fine food and drink, or haute cuisine, which is characterized by their high level of refined and elaborate food preparation techniques and displays of balanced meals that have an aesthetically pleasing presentation of several contrasting, often quite rich courses. Historically the ingredients used in the meal tended to be rare for the region, which could also be impacted by the local state and religious customs. The term and the related characteristics are typically used to describe people with more discerning palates and enthusiasm. Gourmet food is more frequently provided with small servings and in more upscale and posh fine dining establishments that cater to a more affluent and exclusive client base. When it comes to cooking gourmet dishes, there are also frequent cross-cultural interactions that introduce new, exotic, and expensive ingredients, materials, and traditions with more refined, complex, formal, and sophisticated high-level cooking and food preparation techniques.

==Origin of term==
The word &quot;gourmet&quot; is from the French term for a wine broker or &quot;taste-vin&quot; employed by a wine dealer. &quot;Friand&quot; was formerly the reputable name for a connoisseur of delicious things that were not eaten primarily for nourishment: &quot;A good gourmet&quot;, wrote the conservative eighteenth-century &quot;Dictionnaire de Trévoux&quot;, employing this original sense, &quot;must have &quot;le goût friand&quot;&quot;, or a refined palate. The pleasure is also visual: &quot;J&#x27;aime un ragoût, et je suis friand&quot;, Giacomo Casanova declared, &quot;mais s&#x27;il n&#x27;a pas bonne mine, il me semble mauvais&quot;. In the eighteenth century, &quot;gourmet&quot; and &quot;gourmand&quot; carried disreputable connotations of gluttony, which only &quot;gourmand&quot; has retained. &quot;Gourmet&quot; was rendered respectable by Monsieur Grimod de la Reynière, whose &quot;Almanach des Gourmands&quot;, essentially the first restaurant guide, appeared in Paris from 1803 to 1812. Previously, even the liberal &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; offered a moralising tone in its entry &quot;Gourmandise&quot;, defined as &quot;refined and uncontrolled love of good food&quot;, employing reproving illustrations that contrasted the frugal ancient Spartans and Roman Republic with the decadent luxury of Sybaris. The Jesuits&#x27; &quot;Dictionnaire de Trévoux&quot; took the &quot;Encyclopédistes&quot; to task, reminding its readers that &quot;gourmandise&quot; was one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

== Associated terms ==
The term &quot;gourmet&quot; can refer to a person with refined or discriminating taste who is knowledgeable in the craft and art of food and food preparation.

&quot;Gourmand&quot; carries additional connotations of one who enjoys food in great quantities.

An &quot;epicure&quot; is similar to a gourmet, but the word may sometimes carry overtones of excessive refinement.

A &quot;gourmet chef&quot; is used to refer to a chef with a particularly high caliber of cooking talent and culinary skill.

== Regional differences ==
What is considered gourmet is different depending on the time and geographic region. What is gourmet historically depended upon what ingredients the people of that region had access to and how easily they acquire them. For instance, seafood could be considered a luxury in an area that lacks fish, whereas it would not be seen as such in an area near the ocean or a great river. Gourmet tended, and still does in many parts of the world, to be revered by a person with access to wealth because gourmet food has always been expensive. The expense was the result of a scarcity of ingredients for a particular food in the region at the time. This fact meant they needed to be brought in from far away, which brought a variety of risks to the merchants. Merchants would have to deal with weather conditions, thieves, and broken equipment, intermediaries, and other such factors that could delay or interrupt the shipment of the good at the cost of their lives and fortune. Thus they asked for higher prices. For millennia, about 10% of the population could eat food that may have been considered gourmet in their time. Potentially 80% of the global population worked in food production and would have eaten more typical meals to survive. The typical meal would be what they could most easily get their hands on. In Britain, for instance, that was gruels, vegetables, small amounts of wild game, and grains.

Another factor would be religious/cultural beliefs and customs, which have a significant impact on the food that was eaten. For instance, Jewish and Islamic cultures have rules for not only what they can eat, but how to prepare the food and what it can be paired with. To eat specific food items they must be Kosher (for Jews) Jhatka (for Hindu) and Halal (for Muslims). One well-known example is that neither Jews nor Muslims can eat pork because they consider pigs to be unclean. Another example is that many people of India generally do not consume beef because many devout Hindus believe the cow is a sacred animal. Buddhism&#x27;s encouragement of adopting vegetarianism also limits what devout Buddhists can eat. These practices and beliefs encourage what is not eaten in society but also what can be eaten. For instance, the Buddhists have a history of preparing and eating tofu to satisfy their dietary requirements for protein. There is also the role of the state when it comes to these issues sometimes dictating how meals should be prepared. An example of this would be that of edicts of Ashoka who declared that many animals shall be given decent treatment and limited the numbers that could be consumed. Ashoka was a very devout Buddhist and that affected his policies.

== Cultural exchange ==
This trading from non-local regions, also means, almost by necessity, that there was much cultural exchange between different groups to get these goods. The Columbian Exchange introduced many ingredients and styles to the new world and Europe starting with the expansion of the Iberian Empires. The new world introduced to Europeans tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate, and much more. Another example would be interactions with the Islamic world, which impacted Catholic cuisine in the 1100s. These interactions introduced many spices, the theory of the culinary cosmos, and cooking items such as North African pottery. These trades were facilitated by rich merchant states that traded with them, the most notable being Venice.

==Food==
&quot;Gourmet&quot; may describe a class of restaurant, cuisine, meal or ingredient of high quality, of special presentation, or high sophistication. In the United States, a 1980s gourmet food movement evolved from a long-term division between elitist (or &quot;gourmet&quot;) tastes and a populist aversion to fancy foods. Gourmet is an industry classification for high-quality premium foods in the United States. In the 2000s, there has been an accelerating increase in the American gourmet market, due in part to rising income, globalization of taste, and health and nutrition concerns. Individual food and beverage categories, such as coffee, are often divided between a standard and a &quot;gourmet&quot; sub-market.

==Gourmet pursuits==
Certain events such as wine tastings cater to people who consider themselves gourmets and foodies. Television programs (such as those on the Food Network) and publications such as &quot;Gourmet&quot; magazine often serve gourmets with food columns and features. Gourmet tourism is a niche industry catering to people who travel to food or wine tastings, restaurants, or food and wine production regions for leisure.

==Related concepts==
&quot;Foodie&quot; is often used by the media as a conversational synonym for &quot;gourmet&quot;, although it is a different concept (distinct from that of a food aficionado or food enthusiast). The word &quot;foodie&quot; was coined synchronously by Gael Greene in the magazine &quot;New York&quot; and by Paul Levy and Ann Barr, co-authors of &quot;The Official Foodie Handbook&quot; (1984).

== History ==

===1997–2000: Beginning, Michiyo Heike &amp; Morning Musume===
In 1997, Japanese rock group Sharam Q, fronted by Tsunku, began auditions for a female vocalist. These auditions aired via the reality show Asayan, and resulted in Michiyo Heike being crowned winner. Tsunku decided to give five of the runners-up, Yuko Nakazawa, Natsumi Abe, Kaori Iida, Asuka Fukuda and Aya Ishiguro, named &quot;Morning Musume&quot;, a chance to become a group by selling 50,000 copies of their demo single &quot;Ai no Tane&quot; in just five days. The girls sold the required number of copies in four days, and subsequently became an official group.

Morning Musume&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Morning Coffee,&quot; was released on January 28, 1998 on the One Up Music label and charted at #6 on the Oricon weekly chart. The group&#x27;s first official appearance was a joint live in August 1998, at Shibuya Public Hall (now Shibuya C.C. Lemon Hall), under the name the fan club of the two acts was called &quot;Hello!&quot; The first official &quot;units&quot; were Tanpopo and Petitmoni, created in October 1998. The first &quot;Michiyo Heike &amp; Morning Musume Imotōbun Audition&quot; took place, resulting in the &quot;second generation&quot; of Morning Musume to be added, made up of Sayaka Ichii, Mari Yaguchi and Kei Yasuda.

In January 1999, auditions for Country Musume were held on . In April of that year the girls&#x27; official fan club was renamed &quot;Hello! Project&quot;, a name which was later used to represent an enterprise of member-changing girl groups. Auditions were once again held on Asayan between April and July, resulting in Taiyō to Ciscomoon and Coconuts Musume, with Country Musume&#x27;s official formation announced. In July, the first live concert of Hello! Project, &quot;Hello! Project &#x27;99 at Yokohama Arena,&quot; was held. The first shuffle units were formed in March 2000, releasing the &quot;theme&quot; of Hello! Project as a B-side. The first Hello! Project television show, &quot;Hello! Morning,&quot; was created in April.

===2001–2006: Rise to popularity, Berryz Kobo &amp; Cute===
In March 2001, Morning Musume co-founder and leader Yuko Nakazawa announced her graduation from the group, which took place in April. Nakazawa was subsequently named as leader of the entirety of Hello! Project. Nakazawa&#x27;s was the first graduation in the history of Hello! Project, and garnered considerable media attention as a result.

Between April and June 2002, auditions for Hello! Project Kids were held for girls under 12 years old. Out of 27,958 applicants, fifteen elementary school girls were chosen.

Pro Egg and Hello! Project Kansai.

In February 2009, Hello! Project also held a series of auditions in South Korea with cooperation from Mnet. However, Hello! Project failed to break into the Chinese market due to piracy and their Chinese artists failing to draw an audience. Ice Creamusume also performed below expectations. Hello!

Project fan named Mariko, and Yuno Ohara as Mariko&#x27;s daughter Misaki, who runs a guesthouse. Hello! Project members would be making appearances in each episode of the drama as guest performers at the guesthouse.

<text>Fresh Hare is a Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Friz Freleng, written by Michael Maltese, and produced by Leon Schlesinger. It was released to theatres on August 22, 1942.

==Plot==
In this short, the rotund early-1940s version of Elmer Fudd is portrayed as a Mountie, earnestly attempting to arrest Bugs Bunny, who is, according to several posters attached to forest trees, wanted dead or alive (preferably dead). After following the rabbit tracks to a burrow, Elmer tries to lure Bugs out with a carrot. This works, at least with Bugs&#x27; hand, and Elmer initially succeeds in getting a handcuff around the rabbit&#x27;s wrist. Somehow, though, Bugs works his arm free of the cuff – out of sight in his burrow – and attaches a bomb in its place. Elmer, attached to the bomb via the other handcuff, panics when he pulls it out of the burrow. He frantically searches for his keys, only to find that Bugs has them and, leaning against a nearby tree, is nonchalantly twirling them around his finger while munching a carrot. Bugs deliberately takes his time going through each and every key, but does not find the correct one until the bomb explodes off-screen. Elmer, who is completely unharmed by the explosion, tells Bugs that he has been found guilty of committing a litany of crimes. The crimes (here corrected for Elmer&#x27;s rounded-l-and-r speech) are as follows:

&quot;Resisting an officer, assault and battery, trespassing, disturbing the peace, miscellaneous misdemeanors, public nuisance, traffic violations, going through a boulevard stop, jaywalking, triple parking, conduct unbecoming to a rabbit&quot;, and (again) &quot;violating traffic regulations.&quot;

As Elmer reads, Bugs takes his Mountie hat and impersonates a superior officer: &quot;Attention! Why, look at you! You call yourself a Mountie! You&#x27;re a disgrace to the regiment! I&#x27;m gonna drum you out of the service!&quot; He then tears off Elmer&#x27;s uniform, revealing a tightened corset and polka-dot undershorts.

When Elmer realizes he&#x27;s been tricked, he begins to give chase — after pausing to put his miraculously refurbished uniform back on. The chase eventually involves a path beneath the snow, which ends abruptly when Elmer runs into a pine tree. The impact causes all the snow to fall off the tree, which reveals Christmas decorations, and Elmer emerges from underneath with snow on his face that gives him a Santa Claus appearance. The song &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; plays in the background, and Bugs says to the astonished Elmer, &quot;Merry Christmas, Santy!&quot; and burrows his way out of Elmer&#x27;s path.

Elmer rediscovers Bugs&#x27;s footprints and follows them. He finds Bugs taunting a snow effigy of Elmer the Mountie. Bugs announces he is going to punch it square in the nose, saying Elmer can&#x27;t catch &quot;him&quot;, let alone catch a &quot;cold&quot;. Elmer has crept up behind Bugs and is tapping his foot, waiting to catch the rabbit by surprise. However, as Bugs finishes his wind-up for the punch, he turns around at the last moment and slugs the real Elmer square in the nose, propelling him backward into an ice-wall and revealing a heart with an arrow through it. Bugs again burrows away.

After some more hijinks and another failed chase, a weeping Elmer gives up and labels himself as a &quot;disgwace to the wegiment&quot; for failing to catch the rabbit since he is a disgrace to the regiment (alluding to Bugs&#x27; earlier statement), at which point Bugs willingly turns himself in. At headquarters, Bugs is blindfolded and sentenced to death by firing squad (despite the fact that most of his alleged crimes were essentially misdemeanors). As the firing squad prepares to execute Bugs, Elmer tells him that he can make one last wish, which prompts Bugs to say, &quot;I wish, I wish,&quot; and to break into the song &quot;Dixie&quot;. The scene then, in a &quot;non sequitur&quot;, transitions into a minstrel show in the south (a commonly censored scene on televised airings of this short), where Elmer, Bugs and the firing squad, now all in blackface, perform the chorus of &quot;Camptown Races&quot;, with Bugs on banjo and Elmer on tambourine, to which Bugs asks the audience, &quot;Fantastic, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;

==Edited prints==
The last scene of the short was edited on multiple channels in multiple ways. On Cartoon Network and TNT, a fade-iris goes out fast enough after Bugs begins singing Dixie. On TBS, the ending audio of the short stays intact but, while it plays, it repeatedly keeps playing Bugs breaking into Dixie multiple times until the soundtrack ends as the iris fades out.

In 2003, WVTV Channel 18 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin aired the short unedited during a public domain cartoon program, without any advance warning.

<text>Karamenderes is a river located entirely within the Çanakkale Province of Turkey. It flows west from Mount Ida and empties into the Aegean Sea near the Troy Historical National Park. According to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the battles of the Trojan War were fought in the lower courses of Karamenderes.

Known in antiquity as Scamander, Scamandrus or Skamandros (), it was according to Homer called Xanthus or Xanthos (Ξάνθος) by the gods and Scamander by men; though it probably owed the name Xanthus to the yellow or brownish colour of its water. Notwithstanding this distinct declaration of the poet that the two names belonged to the same river, Pliny the Elder mentions the Xanthus and Scamander as two distinct rivers, and describes the former as flowing into the Portus Achaeorum, after having joined the Simoeis. 

Pseudo-Plutarch (ca. 300 CE) tells us that Scamander went mad during the mysteries of Rhea and flung himself into the river Xanthus, which was then renamed to Scamander. He also says that an herb &quot;like a vetch&quot; grows in the river which bears a seed pod that rattles when ripe, and whoever possesses this plant &quot;fears no apparition nor the sight of any God.&quot;

In regard to the colour of the water, it was believed to have even the power of dyeing the wool of sheep which drank of it. Homer states that the river had two sources close to the city of Troy, one sending forth hot water and the other cold, and that near these springs the Trojan women used to wash their clothes. Strabo remarks that in his time no hot spring existed in those districts; he further asserts that the river had only one source; that this was far away from Troy in Mount Ida; and lastly that the notion of its rising near Troy arose from the circumstance of its flowing for some time under ground and reappearing in the neighbourhood of Ilion. Homer describes the Scamander as a large and deep river, and states that the Simoeis flowed into the Scamander, which after the junction still retained the name of Scamander. Although Homer describes the river as large and deep, Herodotus states that its waters were not sufficient to afford drink to the army of Xerxes I. 

The Scamander after being joined by the Simoeis has still a course of about 20 stadia eastward, before it reaches the sea, on the east of Cape Sigeum. Ptolemy, and apparently Pomponius Mela, assign to each river its own mouth, the Simoeis discharging itself into the sea at a point north of the mouth of the Scamander. To account for these discrepancies, it must be assumed that even at that time the physical changes in the aspect of the country arising from the muddy deposits of the Scamander had produced these effects, or else that Ptolemy mistook a canal for the Scamander. Even in the time of Strabo the Scamander reached the sea only at those seasons when it was swollen by rains, and at other times it was lost in marshes and sand. It was from this circumstance, that, even before its junction with the Simoeis, a canal was dug, which flowed in a western direction into the sea, south of Sigeum, so that the two rivers joined each other only at times when their waters were high. Pliny, who calls the Scamander a navigable river, is in all probability thinking of the same canal. The point at which the two rivers reach the sea is now greatly changed, for owing to the deposits at the mouth, the coast has made great advances into the sea, and the Portus Achaeorum, probably a considerable bay, has altogether disappeared.

<text>SilverStone is a non-stick plastic coating made by DuPont. Released in 1976, this three-coat (primer/midcoat/topcoat) fluoropolymer system formulated with PTFE and PFA produces a more durable finish than Teflon coating.

As of 1980 Dupont required that the pans carrying the brand be a heavier weight than others on the market. After the coating was applied the cookware was subsequently &quot;baked&quot; in a 700-800 degree oven to affix the coating.

The process for creating Silverstone cookware begins by sandblasting the products which creates an uneven surface that encourages adherence. Then a primer layer of Teflon is sprayed on and after it is baked at high heat to &quot;a secure mechanical grip.&quot; Gizmodo reported in 2014 that one or two more additional layers were applied after the initial layer.

<text>Cardiff Bay Opera House was a proposed centre for the performing arts in Cardiff Bay, Cardiff, Wales, conceived in the 1990s as a crucial part of the Cardiff Bay redevelopment project. One aim of the scheme was to create a new home for the Welsh National Opera company, which was then based in the New Theatre in Cardiff. The Wales Millennium Centre was built in its place and it opened in 2004.

The plan, supported by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, was to construct a permanent home for Welsh National Opera on a site near the Inner Harbour, Cardiff Bay. An international design competition was held and was eventually won by the Iraqi-born architect Zaha Hadid. The Hadid design was called the Crystal Necklace by some in the media. However, the project failed to win financial support from the Millennium Commission, the body which distributed funds from the UK National Lottery.

== International design competition ==
An international design competition was established by the Cardiff Bay Opera House Trust to decide on the architect for the project. The competition would eventually be in two rounds. The first round of the competition attracted 268 international competitors; it was won by Iraq-born architect Zaha Hadid. The list of architectural practices that took part in the competition included Itsuko Hasegawa, Mario Botta, Rem Koolhaas, Rafael Moneo, Manfredi Nicoletti, Pietro Marcozzi Architect, Rusli Associates, Werner Seligmann &amp; Associates, Percy Thomas Partnership and Greg Lynn FORM. Her avant-garde design was a glass structure that surrounded the main theatre. However, her design was deemed so radical that Lord Crickhowell, as chair of the Cardiff Bay Opera House Trust, asked Hadid to submit her design again along with Norman Foster + Partners and Manfredi Nicoletti, who were asked to submit revised designs, for a second round of competition. But she again won both this and a third round. She remained confident of eventual success: ‘Give them time and space to understand. The problem is that people in this country have seen so much garbage for so long they think life is a Tesco. When the highest aspiration is to make a supermarket, then you have a problem.’

== Aftermath == 
The project lacked support from either South Glamorgan County Council or Cardiff City Council and was savaged by the media as being &quot;elitist&quot; and ugly. The Millennium Commission, which gave funding to such projects from the UK National Lottery, refused to fund the project as it considered it to be financially risky. This was not helped by the successful application for funding for the Millennium Stadium, just a few miles away. Eventually, the project collapsed. The project was said to have been destroyed by lack of public support for the design and by Cardiff Council&#x27;s support for the Millennium Stadium.

The decision to formally reject the bid for lottery money by the Millennium Commission was announced on 22 December 1995. Many claim that the bid failed because of the widespread unpopularity of the Millennium Commission support for the Royal Opera House in London, which was seen as elitist. &quot;Opera&quot; reported one of the tabloid headlines where The Sun claimed &quot;The Sun stops £50m lotto handout to opera - Delight as toff scheme is KOd&quot;.

Virginia Bottomley, Secretary of State for National Heritage, announced in a news conference that the project was flawed by uncertainties in the building&#x27;s financing and construction, which made it the project too risky. Lord Crickhowell interrupted that news conference to denounce the rejection. He said the decision was &quot;...shocking and incomprehensible...If this had been a project in London, it would be getting backing...You can understand the annoyance of people in Wales that we can&#x27;t get the kind of vitally important projects that London seems to be allowed.&quot;

The project was succeeded by the Wales Millennium Centre, which included a broader range of artistic offerings and was said to be more in keeping with Welsh culture, whilst retaining the opera element. The Centre opened in November 2004, on the site originally intended for the Opera House.

Years later Hadid said she thought the opposition to her design was possibly a result of racism and sexism against her. Her design was reused for the Guangzhou Opera House in China.

<text>Sir Everard Ferdinand im Thurn (9 May 1852 – 9 October 1932) was an author, explorer, botanist, photographer and British colonial administrator. He was Governor of Fiji in the years 1904–1910.

== Life ==
Im Thurn was born in Camberwell, London, the son of a Swiss immigrant banker, and educated at Marlborough College, University of Oxford, the University of Edinburgh, and the University of Sydney. His first book, dedicated to his headmaster, was a study of &quot;The Birds of Marlborough&quot; (1870).

After his education, im Thurn travelled to British Guiana—called Guyana since its independence from Great Britain—to become (at the age of 25) curator of the British Guiana Museum from 1877 until 1882. He later became a stipendiary magistrate in Pomeroon.

In December 1884 he led the first successful expedition to the summit of Mount Roraima, in Venezuela&#x27;s Gran Sabana region, along with Harry Perkins, an Assistant Crown Surveyor who was also living in British Guiana. He was a keen photographer and author of several works related to his expedition to Roraima, which were published in scientific journals, including: &quot;The Botany of Roraima Expedition of 1884: being notes on the plants observed; with a list of the species collected, and determinations of those that are new&quot; (Linnean Society, 1887), and &quot;Among the Indians of Guiana: being sketches, chiefly anthropologic from the interior of British Guiana, etc.&quot;, which includes detailed observations of the Pemon Indians of Venezuela. Im Thurn went on to become a government agent in British Guiana from 1891 to 1899, and was employed on the Venezuelan boundary commission 1897–99, for which he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1900 New Year Honours list on 1 January 1900 (the order was gazetted on 16 January 1900), and was invested by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 1 March 1900.

He then spent a couple of years back in the United Kingdom, holding several positions from 1899 to 1901, including 1st class clerk and later principal clerk in the Colonial Office. In July 1901 he moved to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where he was appointed colonial secretary and lieutenant-governor. He ended his colonial career as Governor of Fiji from 1904 to 1910, during which time he was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1905 Birthday Honours. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1918 New Year Honours, at which time he was vice-chairman of the King George and Queen Mary&#x27;s Club for Overseas Forces.

He was a well-respected figure in the scientific circles of his time. Whilst in Ceylon he served as president of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1902 to 1904. He was later elected president of the Royal Anthropological Institute 1919–1920 and made an Honorary Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford.

In 1895, he married Hannah C. Lorimer, daughter of Professor James Lorimer, of the University of Edinburgh. In 1921 they moved to live at Cockenzie House in East Lothian, where he died in 1932.

In 1886, he was honoured by English botanist Henry Nicholas Ridley, who named a genus of plants from tropical South America after him: &quot;Everardia&quot;, in the family Cyperaceae.

<text>Battle of Szack (Shatsk) was one of the battles between the Polish Army and the Red Army fought in 1939 in the beginning of the Second World War.

== Eve of the battle ==
During the invasion of Poland, the Polish Border Defence Corps (&quot;KOP&quot;) was severely stripped of all the reserves and heavy armament. All the available Polish forces were sent to the west to reinforce the units resisting the German invasion. When the Red Army invaded Poland on 17 September, there were barely any Polish forces to oppose them. The garrisons of the KOP were overstretched and after initial clashes and skirmishes for the border forts, the Polish units had to fall back.

The deputy commander of the KOP, general Wilhelm Orlik-Rueckemann decided to unite as many troops under his command as possible and join with the rest of the Polish forces in the west. He ordered all the KOP forces in Polesie area to withdraw. In several days he managed to gather approximately 9,000 men under his command, coming from various units spread along a 300-kilometre long strip of the Polish-Soviet border. On 19 September he ordered all his units to march towards Kowel, where his forces were to be joined by the Independent Operational Group Polesie under general Franciszek Kleeberg. However, the difficult situation and the outcome of the battles of Brześć and Kobryń forced Rueckemann&#x27;s group to change its plans. The Polish units changed the direction and started to march through the forests towards Włodawa and Kamień Koszyrski.

The group found itself in a no-man&#x27;s-land between the Soviet forces and the Wehrmacht and could operate freely but the morale of the troops was low. On 27 September General Orlik-Rueckemann decided to engage the Soviet forces to achieve a victory and raise morale.

== Battle ==
The Polish forces were marching in two columns. In the early morning of 28 September the northern column reached the forests near the village of Mielniki while the southern column reached the forests east of Szack (now Shatsk). Polish reconnaissance reported that the town of Shatsk was occupied by Soviet infantry and tanks. Orlik-Rueckemann ordered both columns to form a defensive line along the border of the forest and provoked the Red Army to attack.

At 8 o&#x27;clock in the morning, the Soviet tank unit (composed mostly of the T-26 tanks) started a direct assault on Polish positions. The Polish forces did not open fire until the tanks came close. When the tanks were only some 500 metres from the Polish lines the Polish Bofors wz. 36 anti-tank guns opened fire. Soon they were joined by the infantry and the 75 mm artillery. All Soviet tanks were destroyed and the battalion of major Balcerzak was ordered to attack the town of Shatsk. The Soviet units were taken by surprise and after a short hand-to-hand fight, the Soviet forces were routed. Only a small part of the motorised infantry managed to retreat but had to leave behind all their lorries, artillery and 9 T-26 tanks. The Poles also captured the staff headquarters.

According to the orders of the Soviet 52nd Rifle Division found in the headquarters, the Soviet units operating from the Kobryń area were to &quot;clean up the area east of Bug River from the bands of Polish officers.&quot; At 2 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, Soviet reserve units appeared in the area and Orlik-Rueckemann decided to withdraw his troops to the forests.

== Aftermath ==
The remaining Polish forces withdrew unopposed and started their march towards the Bug River. The only Polish unit destroyed by the Red Army was the tabor of KOP &quot;Polesie&quot; Brigade, caught by surprise near the village of Mielnik by the armoured troops of the Soviet 4th Army under general Vassili Chuikov. After a brief fight, the Polish unit surrendered. Upon the surrender some Polish officers were shot. Polish sources often estimate the number of Polish dead and wounded at 500; including 18 prisoners of war executed in nearby village of .

The remaining Polish forces evaded capture and crossed the Bug River, where they took part in the Battle of Wytyczno.

<doc id="1241519" wikidata="Q752461" url="?curid=1241519" title="Black-bellied whistling duck">
<text>The black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), formerly called the black-bellied tree duck, is a whistling duck that before 2000 bred mainly in the southernmost United States, Mexico, and tropical Central to south-central South America. It can be found year-round in much of the United States. It has been recorded in every eastern state and adjacent Canadian province. Since it is one of only two whistling duck species native to North America, it is occasionally just known as the &quot;whistling duck&quot; or &quot;Mexican squealer&quot; in the southern USA.

==Taxonomy==
In 1751 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the black-bellied whistling duck in the fourth volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The red-billed whistling duck&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a live bird kept at the home of Admiral Charles Wager in Chelsea, London. Edwards was told that the bird had come from the West Indies. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the black-bellied whistling duck with the ducks, geese and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Anas autumnalis,&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The black-bellied whistling duck is now placed in the genus &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; and was introduced in 1837 by the English naturalist William Swainson to distinguish whistling ducks from other waterfowl. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;dendron&quot; meaning &quot;tree&quot; with the genus &quot;Cygnus&quot; containing the swans that was introduced by François Alexandre Pierre de Garsault in 1764. The specific epithet &quot;autumnalis&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;autumnal&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised. They intergrade in Panama.
* &quot;D. a. fulgens&quot; Friedmann, 1947 – southeast Texas to Panama
: Larger, with a brown breast and upper back.
* &quot;D. a. autumnalis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Panama to Ecuador and northern Argentina
: Smaller, with gray breast and upper back.

Prior to 1978, birds from western Panama north to the southern USA were erroneously referred to as &quot;D. a. autumnalis&quot; and birds from eastern Panama into South America were referred to as &quot;D. a. discolor&quot;.

==Description==

The black-bellied whistling duck is a mid-sized waterfowl species. Length ranges from , body mass from , and wingspan ranges from . It has a long pink bill, long head and longish legs, pale gray head and mostly gray-brown plumage. The belly and tail are black, and the body plumage, back of the neck and cap are a rich chestnut brown. The face and upper neck are gray, and they sport a thin but distinct white eye-ring. The extensive white in the wings is obvious in flight, less so on the ground; it is formed by the secondary remiges while the primaries are black; the wing coverts are brown. Males and females look alike; juveniles are similar but have a gray bill and less contrasting belly.

The wing bar is unique among whistling ducks. When on the ground, it may be hard to discern the light flanks present in many of these waterfowl. The fulvous whistling duck (&quot;D. bicolor&quot;) is the only sympatric whistling duck that shows such a whitish flank stripe, and it differs from the black-bellied by having dark wings and a lighter belly rather than the other way around. Juvenile &quot;D. autumnalis&quot; are quite similar to the young of the white-faced whistling duck (&quot;D. viduata&quot;), which have a darker bill and no white wing patch; even when sitting they never seem to show white along the sides, as their thin white vertical barring on the black flanks is very indistinct.
As the name implies, these are noisy birds with a clear whistling &quot;waa-chooo&quot; call.

==Distribution and habitat==

The species is widely distributed in the American continent, to the north it includes the southern part of the United States (Texas, Arizona and Louisiana) and Mexico (mainly along the Pacific and Atlantic slopes, Yucatan Peninsula, southern Mexico and Baja California). Its distribution continues to Central and South America. In Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.

The black-bellied whistling duck is mainly non-migratory, although they are listed on the List of Birds protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). At the heart of their range, there is a tendency to travel in flocks over the winter months, though this behavior is not a true long-range migration but rather local dispersal.

In the 21st century, small numbers have been observed nesting in the Midwestern U.S., including Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin; the species has also strayed to the eastern U.S. and Canada.

==Behavior and ecology==
The black-bellied whistling duck is a common species that is &quot;quite tame, even in the wild&quot;. It is highly gregarious, or social, forming large flocks when not breeding, and is largely resident apart from local movements. It usually nests in hollow trees (in South America many times in palm trees). The habitat is quite shallow freshwater ponds, lakes, and marshes, cultivated land or reservoirs with plentiful vegetation, where this duck feeds mainly at night on seeds and other plant food.

===Breeding===
The black-bellied whistling duck is quite unique among ducks in their strong monogamous pair-bond. Its pairs often stay together for many years, a trait more often associated with geese and swans. Both parents share all tasks associated with the raising of the young, from incubation to the rearing of ducklings. The ducks, primarily cavity nesters, prefer the confines of a hollow tree but will nest on the ground when necessary. They also make use of chimneys, abandoned buildings, or nest boxes, the latter having been increasingly provided to them over recent decades, especially in southeast Texas and Mexico. Ducklings leap from nest cavities within two days of hatching, can feed themselves immediately, and stay with the parents for up to eight weeks.

===Food and feeding===
Feeding often occurs nocturnally, but they can be encountered eating at any hour of the day. Black-bellied whistling ducks ingest a wide variety of plant material (including corn, rice, millets, several types of weeds, and other grasses), but also consume arthropods (such as insects and spiders), aquatic invertebrates (such as snails and other molluscs) and tadpoles when available. They often feed on submerged vegetation by wading through shallow water. As its Latin name (&quot;autumnalis&quot;) implies, it is commonly seen gleaning recently harvested fields for leftover seeds and invertebrates brought up by the harvesters disturbing the soil.

==Status and conservation==
The black-bellied whistling duck is listed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); its global population is estimated at 1,100,000–2,000,000 birds and increasing.

<text>The spotted whistling duck (Dendrocygna guttata) is a member of the duck family Anatidae. It is also referred to as the &quot;spotted tree duck&quot;. This duck can be found in Indonesia, New Guinea, Australia and the Philippines. Spotted ducks are also held in captive populations.

== Description ==
The Spotted whistling duck is one of the smaller species in the genus &quot;Dendrocygna&quot;. This duck grows to 43–50 cm tall. Males can weigh anywhere from 590g to 650g while females weigh 610g to 860g. White spots on their flanks and breasts gave these ducks the spotted name. The sides of the neck, faces, and eyebrows are all grey. Black or dark brown coloring stretches from the crown nape to the hindneck. This dark coloring is also found in the eyepatch. Their coloring resembles a cape with a thick collar. This cape starts as a light brown then fades into a darker brown closer to the tail. Their underbelly is mostly brown, sometimes spotted, and significantly lighter than the wings and the “collar.” A white bar on the upper tail coverts can be seen during flight aiding in identification. They have dull pink legs with black webbed feet and sharp nails. The bill is dark, yet often seen with portions of red and a small white mark on the lower mandible. Spotted whistling ducks look as though they are raised from the ground, as though they are standing up tall. (look more into this). Their wings pressed strongly against the body. Inner vanes of the outer primaries are jagged and can be seen in flight (check on this). While flying, the head is positioned down causing the whole bird to look hunched. The tail stays pointed and looks long when in flight. Juveniles are seen with white streaks on flanks instead of spots and have significantly duller coloring. Spotted whistling ducks are visually similar to &quot;D. arborea&quot;, yet many scientists believe its closest relative is &quot;D. eytoni&quot;. After gaining their adult plumage at the age of 6 months. the spotted whistling duck has a single annual molt. Like other ducks, swans, and geese, the spotted whistling duck molts synchronously. Synchronous molting is common within Anseriformes because waterfowl have the ability to avoid terrestrial predators. Unlike other birds, waterfowl float in ponds lakes while they molt, safe from predators. Other more evolved ducks have two molts, whistling ducks only molt once.

==Taxonomy and Systematics==
The spotted whistling duck, &quot;Dendrocygna guttata&quot;, was first reported in 1866. Like all other birds, it is an animal in the phylum &quot;Chordata&quot; and the class &quot;Aves&quot;. The spotted whistling duck is a part of the order &quot;Anseriformes&quot;, which includes all waterfowl. Swans, geese, and ducks are all a part of the family &quot;Anatidae&quot;. Within &quot;Anatidae&quot;, the family &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; encompasses all whistling ducks. Bird phylogenies are difficult to determine due to massive adaptive radiations throughout history. Scientists change phylogenetic trees often as new genetic information becomes available. In Australia philogonies are especially difficult, due to visually similar endemic and monotypic genera. Before genetic information was available, the &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; was classified within Anserinae by Delacour and Mayr. Within &quot;Anserinae&quot;, the &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; and &quot;Thalassornis&quot; were combined into one by Monrow in 1990 using DNA-DNA hybridization data. This genus then stayed consistent. Using mitochondrial DNA in 1996 Swaml et al. discovered Dendrocyna diverged first following Anseranatidae. This genus is the most basal group after the magpie goose. Whistling ducks are more closely related to swans and geese than the “true ducks” such as mallards. Then, in 2002 a study using sequenced DNA from the complete mitochondrial control region supported the 1996 conclusion. Within &quot;Denrocygna&quot;, the Spotted Whistling Duck was the most recent species discovery. In 1995 Livezey partitioned clades within the Dendrocygna, one clade including the Fulvous Whistling-Duck, Lesser whistling, &quot;D. arcuata&quot; and &quot;D. eytoni&quot;. &quot;D. arcuata&quot; and &quot;D. javanica&quot; are sister species. Outside this clade, the spotted whistling duck and the West Indian whistling duck are sister species.

==Distribution==
Whistling ducks are found all over the world. The spotted whistling duck is distributed throughout the Philippines, Australia, and New Guinea. These ducks live in the southern part of the Philippines and several islands of Indonesia. In Indonesia spotted whistling ducks stretch from the Eastern Lesser Sundas islands to new guinea. Spotted whistling ducks are also found in Weipa and Iron ranges of Australia, but have also been seen at Wonga Beach. Scientists hypothesize the Indonesian population was introduced due to a storm blowing the birds off course.

==Habitat==
Spotted whistling ducks live around bodies of water, like many other ducks. These ducks specifically live around small ponds and marshes surrounded by trees. They prefer humid and low altitude habitats. Spotted whistling ducks build hollows within the trees surrounding their habitats.

==Diet and Feeding==
The Diet of the spotted whistling duck contains grass seeds, aquatic invertebrates, aquatic plants, and small fish. These ducks obtain their food by dabbling and diving. The ducks dabble at the surface of the ponds, filtering the water through their bills. The birds bounce on the surface to enter the water headfirst, after being underwater for a maximum of 15 seconds they emerge with another bounce. Scientists never observed food in the bill after the diving behavior. They concluded the birds consume the food while underwater. (Beruldsen) The majority of feeding occurs at night.

==Breeding==
The genus &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; has strong pair bonds. Male and female birds are visually similar, females are slightly heavier than males. Without weighing the bird sex is difficult to determine. Breeding season begins in September with active nests found as late as April. Their nests are found in hollowed-out trees. Both parents participate in nest building at the same time. One pair can have several clutches a year consisting of 10-11 eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs for 18–31 days and when hatched the chick weighs 17.5g. In captivity, the chicks fledged at 7 weeks, yet in the wild scientists have observed chicks flying at 45–50 days old. The spotted whistling duck has a breeding system described as ‘primitive,’ which is consistent with other basal groups in Anseriformes.

==Behavior==
Spotted whistling ducks are found in groups with their own species and often with &quot;D. arcata&quot;. Compared to others in the genus, these ducks are less vocal. These birds perch on tree branches in groups slightly smaller than flocks. The flocks are often a mix of adults and juveniles. The adults shepard the juveniles keeping them close to the group. In 2000 Beruldsen observed a group consisting of 6 juveniles and two adults, male and female. The juveniles seemed unbothered by the human presence, but the adults made sure there was distance between Buruldsen and the juveniles. The birds kept their distance but seemed to be unaffected. The adult male positioned himself between the juveniles and the humans, protecting the other birds. This behavior was often accompanied by several high-pitched ticking calls.

==Threats==
The spotted whistling duck is listed as least concern. Their population is stable with populations ranging from 10,000 to 25,000 birds. In captivity they were found to be specifically susceptible to avian tuberculous. Twenty-seven percent of bird species get avian tuberculosis and the disease is usually fatal. Spotted whistling ducks die at a higher rate than other birds. Within one collection of captive birds, the death rate of avian tuberculous reached 70% with the majority of deaths occurring from January to March. The relatively small size of this bird could explain the increased death rate.

==Interactions with Humans==
The spotted whistling duck is not hunted often. These ducks are found in captivity, like many other duck species.

<doc id="1241527" wikidata="Q917586" url="?curid=1241527" title="Plumed whistling duck">
<text>The plumed whistling duck (Dendrocygna eytoni), also called the grass whistling duck, is a whistling duck that breeds in Australia. It is a predominantly brown-coloured duck with a long neck and characteristic plumes arising from its flanks. The sexes are similar in appearance.

== Taxonomy ==
Described by English naturalist Thomas Campbell Eyton in 1838, its specific epithet honours its namer. Its generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek terms &quot;dendron&quot; &quot;tree&quot;, and &quot;kuknos&quot; (via Latin &quot;cygnus&quot;) &quot;swan&quot;. Alternate common names include; Eyton&#x27;s plumed, red-legged or whistling tree-duck, and grey or red-legged whistler. 

== Description ==
Measuring and weighing around , it is a long-necked duck with brown upperparts, paler underparts and a white rump. The chest is chestnut with thin black bars, while long black-margined plumes arise from its flanks. Its bill and legs are pink, and its iris is yellow. The male and female are similar in appearance. The species has a characteristic lowered neck and short, dark, rounded wings while flying.

The call is a characteristic whistle which gives the bird its common name.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The range is eastern, northern and central Australia from the Kimberley across the Top End and Cape York, down to southern Queensland and northern New South Wales on the east coast, although may reach north-western Victoria inland, in the vicinity of the Murray River. It is also found in New Guinea. The preferred habitat is tall grassland and savanna, often near bodies of water.

== Feeding ==
Rather than diving for food in bodies of water like other ducks, the plumed whistling duck feeds by cropping grass on land.

== Breeding ==
The plumed whistling duck breeds during the wet season, generally in January to March, although it can be later in April or, in a few cases, May. One brood is raised per season. The nest is a mattress of grasses or similar material in tall grass, or in or near vegetation as cover. Ten to 12 oval eggs are laid, measuring ; 14 or more have been recorded on occasion. Initially shiny and creamy-coloured, they may become stained. The incubation period is around 30 days.

<doc id="1241528" wikidata="Q1710346" url="?curid=1241528" title="Posturography">
<text>Posturography is the technique used to quantify postural control in upright stance in either static or dynamic conditions. Among them, Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP), also called test of balance (TOB), is a non-invasive specialized clinical assessment technique used to quantify the central nervous system adaptive mechanisms (sensory, motor and central) involved in the control of posture and balance, both in normal (such as in physical education and sports training) and abnormal conditions (particularly in the diagnosis of balance disorders and in physical therapy and postural re-education). Due to the complex interactions among sensory, motor, and central processes involved in posture and balance, CDP requires different protocols in order to differentiate among the many defects and impairments which may affect the patient&#x27;s posture control system. Thus, CDP challenges it by using several combinations of visual and support surface stimuli and parameters.

Clinical applications for CDP were first described by L.M. Nashner in 1982, and the first commercially available testing system was developed in 1986, when NeuroCom International, Inc., launched the EquiTest system.

==Working==
Static posturography is carried out by placing the patient in a standing posture on a fixed instrumented platform (forceplate) connected to sensitive detectors (force and movement transducers), which are able to detect the tiny oscillations of the body.
Dynamic posturography differentiates from static posturography generally by using a special apparatus with a movable horizontal platform. As the patient makes small movements, they transmit in real time to a computer. The computer is also used to command electric motors which can move the forceplate in the horizontal direction (translation) as well as to incline it (rotations). Thus, the posturography test protocols generate a sequence of standardized motions in the support platform in order to disequilibrate the patient&#x27;s posture in an orderly and reproducible way. The platform is contained within an enclosure which can also be used to generate apparent visual surround motions. These stimuli are calibrated relative to the patient&#x27;s height and weight. A special computer software integrates all this and produces detailed graphics and reports which can then be compared with normal ranges.

==Components of balance==
Center of gravity (COG) is an important component of balance and should be assessed when evaluating someone’s posture. COG is often measured with COP (Center of pressure) because COG is hard to quantify. According to Lafage et al. (2008) the COG should be located at the midpoint of the base of support if an individual has ideal posture. COP excursion and velocity are indicators of control over COG and are key factors for identifying proper posture and the ability to maintain balance. COP excursion is defined by Collins &amp; De Luca (1992) as the Euclidean*LINK* displacement in the anterior/posterior and medial/lateral directions within the base of support (perimeter around the feet). With poor posture and / or exaggerated spinal curvatures it is possible that the COP excursion would increase which can cause instability as the COP shifts towards the perimeter of the base of support.

==Types of tests==

The test protocols usually include a Sensory Organization Test (SOT), Limits of Stability Test (LOS), a Motor Control Test (MCT) and an Adaptation Test (ADT). The SOT test was developed by Nashner and is a computerized system that is made up of dual movable force plates and movable visual screen (EquiTest). During the test the patient is instructed to stand still and quietly with eyes open or closed depending on which of the six tests is being administered. The patient performs multiple trials per test; a description of these tests can be found in the table below. The SOT test is based on the fact that there are three sensory systems mainly involved in maintaining balance (vision, vestibular, and proprioceptive). Minute spontaneous body sways are measured as well as reactions provoked by unexpected abrupt movements of the platform and the visual surroundings. Differences in these sways and reactions to system perturbations help to determine the patients ability to effectively use visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive input to maintain posture. Wrisley et al. (2007) found that there are learning effects associated with the SOT test and therefore it could be used clinically to assess, improve and track changes in balance.

SOT results are subdivided in an Equilibrium Score, a Sensory Analysis, a Strategy Analysis and COG Alignment. 
The sensory analysis calculates 4 different scores: somatosensory (SOM), visual (VIS), vestibular (VEST) and visual preference (PREF) (otherwise known as &quot;visual dependence&quot;, an excessive reliance on visual information even when it is inappropriate). The scores are respectively calculated as ratios of the 6 different scores of the equilibrium score:

formula_1

formula_2

formula_3

formula_4

MCT results include instead the Weight Symmetry, both for forward and for backward translations, Latency Scores for forward and backward translations, and Amplitude Scaling, which refers to the capacity of the participant to generate a response force adequate to the entity of the perturbation.

The limits of stability (LOS) is defined as the distance outside the base of support that can be traveled before a loss of balance occurs. The LOS test is frequently used to quantify this distance and has been suggested as a hybrid between static and dynamic balance assessment. During this test the patient stands on the platform as directed above in the SOT test. The patient watches their movements on a screen so they can see each of the eight LOS targets. The patient begins with their COP directly in the center of the targets (displayed as a figure as a computerized person). At the onset of the test, the patient attempts to lean in the direction of the indicated perimeter target, without lifting their feet, and hold there until the test is complete.

According to necessity of the diagnostic workup, CDP can be combined with other techniques, such as electronystagmography (ENG) and electromyography.

The main indications for CDP are dizziness and vertigo, and postural imbalances (balance disorders).

<text>Spacebus is a satellite bus produced at the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center in France by Thales Alenia Space. Spacebuses are typically used for geostationary communications satellites, and seventy-four have been launched since development started in the 1980s. Spacebus was originally produced by Aérospatiale and later passed to Alcatel Alenia Space. In 2006, it was sold to Thales Group as Thales Alenia Space.

The first Spacebus satellite, Arabsat-1A, was launched in 1985. Since then, seventy-four have been launched, with one more completed, and six outstanding orders. The launch of the 50th Spacebus satellite, Star One C1, occurred in November 2007. It was a Spacebus 3000B3, launched by an Ariane 5 rocket flying from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana.

Several variants have been built: the early Spacebus 100 and Spacebus 300; followed by the Spacebus 2000, optimised for launch on the Ariane 4 carrier rocket; and the subsequent modular Spacebus 3000 and 4000 series, designed for use with the Ariane 5 rocket.

== History ==
Aérospatiale had produced a number of satellites, including Symphonie, with the German company Messerschmitt. On 9 December 1983, the two companies signed the &quot;Franco-German Spacebus Agreement&quot;. The Spacebus designation was first applied to satellites which were under construction by Aérospatiale when the programme started. These included three satellites for Arabsat, which became the Spacebus 100 series, and five further satellites: two for Deutsche Bundespost, two for TéléDiffusion de France, and the Swedish Space Corporation&#x27;s Tele-X, which became the Spacebus 300 series. Later series&#x27; names were followed by a number indicating the approximate mass of the bus in kilograms. Spacebus designations were not retroactively applied to previously launched satellites.

== Architecture ==

Spacebus satellites consist of a satellite bus, which provides power, propulsion, and other subsystems necessary for the satellite&#x27;s operation, and a payload which is customisable according to the customer&#x27;s requirements. The bus was designed to be adaptable to perform various missions; however, as of 2009, only communications satellites have been ordered. It was also designed to be adaptable when the capacity of launch systems increased.

The bus is made of carbon fibre with a composite honeycomb structure. It contains fuel tanks, equipment to interface with a carrier rocket, and other critical systems. External panels contain equipment such as solar panels, payload, and engine. The payload, developed separately from the bus, takes up three panels. Once it has been outfitted with transponders or other equipment, it is transported to Cannes-Mandelieu, where it is integrated onto the bus.

The satellites are powered by rigid solar panels. Several configurations are used depending on the amount of power the satellite requires. Batteries to store this power are produced by the Belgian company ETCA. Early satellites used nickel-hydrogen batteries, while later spacecraft use lithium-ion batteries.

Spacebus satellites use bipropellant, liquid-fuelled chemical engines to achieve orbit and subsequently perform station-keeping. Electric propulsion was used on the Stentor and Astra 1K satellites, both of which were subsequently involved in launch failures. Spacebus Neo will be an electric propulsion satellite. A three-axis stabilisation system is used for attitude control.

== Models ==
Spacebus satellites are compatible with a large number of carrier rockets, particularly the Ariane family. As the Ariane&#x27;s performance has increased, the satellites&#x27; capacities have increased accordingly.

===Spacebus 100 ===

Three Spacebus 100 satellites were produced for Arabsat to serve the 22 members of the Arab League.

One of the solar panels on the first satellite, Arabsat-1A, failed to deploy, resulting in reduced power. This, combined with gyroscope issues, caused it to spend most of its operational lifespan as a reserve satellite.

=== Spacebus 300 ===
Five direct-to-home television satellites were built using the Spacebus 300 bus, which provided of power.

=== Spacebus 2000 ===

The Spacebus 2000 series was developed to use additional capacity provided by the Ariane 4. Its solar panels generated .

=== Spacebus 3000 ===
The Spacebus 3000 was introduced around the time the Ariane 5 entered service. Spacebus 3000 satellites have masses from and produce between 5 and 16 kW. Increasingly larger payload fairings allowed larger spacecraft to be produced. In 1991, Aérospatiale, Alenia and Space Systems/Loral joined to form the Satellite Alliance.

The first version of the Spacebus 3000 was the Spacebus 3000A, originally developed for Arabsat. They were also ordered by Shin Satellite of Thailand and China&#x27;s Sino Satellite Communications Company.

Twelve 3000B2 satellites were ordered, five of them by Eutelsat for their W Series, one of which later became Eutelsat 28A. A sixth order from Eutelsat was for Eutelsat 8 West A. Nordic Satellite AB, a Scandinavian company that later became SES Sirius, ordered Sirius 2, a replacement for the Spacebus 300-based TeleX satellite. Spanish satellite operator Hispasat ordered two satellites, and Arabsat ordered one satellite, Arabsat-3A. The final two were ordered by the German Bundeswehr and were launched on 1 October 2009, and in May 2010, respectively.

Nine B3 satellites were ordered, three for Eutelsat, two for Star One of Brazil, GE-12 for GE Americom, Turksat 2A for Turksat, and the Stentor experimental communications satellite for CNES. Stentor was lost in a launch failure on the maiden flight of the Ariane 5ECA. Galaxy 17 was successfully launched in 2007 for Intelsat.

=== Spacebus 4000 ===

The Spacebus 4000 series was derived from the 3000 series but featured upgraded avionics. The voltage of the electrical system was increased from 50 volts to 100 volts, and an integrated onboard computer, designed to be more flexible than previous versions, was added. It was also the first satellite bus to be equipped with an attitude and orbit control system with star trackers designed for use in geostationary orbit.

The B series used the same basic structure as the 3000 series. The C version had a base measuring .

Eight Spacebus 4000B2 satellites have been ordered: Bangabandhu-1 for Bangabandhu-1 of Bangladesh, Turksat 3A for Turksat, Thor 6 for Telenor of Norway, Nilesat 201 for Nilesat of Egypt, Athena-Fidus for the French and Italian space agencies CNES and ASI, and Sicral-2 for the Italian Ministry of Defence and the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA), a contract worth about €295m in total, Koreasat-5A and Koreasat-7 for KTSAT and Telkom-3S for PT Telkom Indonesia.

Spacebus 4000B3 satellites are in height and generate 8.5 kilowatts of power. So far, five have been ordered, including two for the French Délégation Générale pour l&#x27;Armement and two for RascomStar-QAF.

The fifth, Palapa D1 for Indosat, uses the ITAR-free configuration, and was launched by a Long March 3B in September 2009, but was initially placed in a low orbit. Thales Alenia Space made corrections allowing the satellite to reach the planned geostationary transfer orbit on 3 September. It finally reached geostationary orbit on 9 September. It is now undergoing on-orbit testing upon its arrival at 113° East about mid-September, where it will be used to provide communications to Asia and Australia. It has enough fuel for 10 years of service, according to Reynald Seznec, President of Thales Alenia Space, instead of the planned 15 years due to the orbit-raising maneuvers.

The first Rascom satellite, Rascom-QAF1, suffered a propulsion system failure during its first apogee manoeuvre on 21 December 2007. It was confirmed to have reached its final geostationary orbit at a longitude of 2.85° east on 4 February 2008, but with only two years of expected operational life, compared to the fifteen expected prior to launch. On 9 September 2008, the Rascom-QAF1R satellite was ordered to replace it, also based on the 4000B3 bus.

The Spacebus 4000C1 has a height of , and is capable of generating 8.5 kilowatts of electricity. The only C1 to have been ordered so far is Koreasat 5 for Korea Telecom of South Korea. It was launched by a Sea Launch Zenit-3SL from the Ocean Odyssey platform on the equator, at 03:27 GMT on 22 August 2006.

The Spacebus 4000C2, which has a height of , generates 10.5 kilowatts of power. Five have been ordered, all using the ITAR-free option, by companies in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Chinasat, a state-owned company ordered two satellites, whilst the APT Satellite ordered three. All were launched by Long March 3B rockets from Launch Area 2 at the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre.

Eight Spacebus 4000C3 satellites, each of which has a height of and generates 13 kilowatts of power, have been ordered. SES Americom and Eutelsat ordered two spacecraft each. The Eutelsat spacecraft are being built using ITAR-free parts, and one of the satellites, Eutelsat W3B launched on an Ariane 5 on 2010-10-28 and was declared lost on 2010-10-30 due to a fuel leak. Eutelsat 21B was ordered by 9 June 2010.; and launched 10 November 2012; Eutelsat W3D ordered on 3 December 2010;, launched 2013-05-14; Russian satellite operator Gazprom also ordered two satellites for its Yamal (satellite constellation) programme—the first time it had procured Yamal spacecraft that were not manufactured in Russia. Only one will be a Spacebus, the second one is based on an Express-2000 platform.

The Spacebus 4000C4 bus is high and can generate 16 kilowatts of power with its solar panels. Four have been ordered so far: Ciel 2 for Ciel Satellite of Canada, which was launched on 10 December 2008, and three spacecraft for Eutelsat, W2A, W7, launched by Proton on 23 November 2009. and Eutelsat-8 West B, ordered on 11 October 2012.

=== Ekspress-4000 ===
On 6 December 2007, Thales Alenia Space signed an agreement with NPO PM of Russia to jointly develop the Ekspress-4000 bus, based on the Spacebus 4000. The Ekspress-4000 is designed for direct injection into geostationary orbit by a Proton-M rocket.

== Spacebus NEO ==
In 2014, Thales Alenia Space started the development of a new family - Spacebus NEO. These new platforms will be available in various propulsion versions, including an all-electric one. The all-electric Spacebus NEO, capable of carrying payloads weighing over 1,400 kg, and with power exceeding 16 kW, will be available starting in mid-2015.

<text>The wandering whistling duck (Dendrocygna arcuata) is a species of whistling duck. They inhabit tropical and subtropical Australia, the Philippines, Borneo, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Pacific Islands.

==Taxonomy==
There are three subspecies associated with this bird, &quot;D. a. arcuata&quot; (Indonesian wandering whistling duck), &quot;D. a. australis&quot; (Australian wandering whistling duck), and &quot;D. a. pygmaea&quot; (New Britain wandering whistling duck).

==Description==
Formerly named tree ducks, the wandering whistling duck has its new name because of their loud whistling calls and the whistling noise their wings make during flight. They have long necks and legs and look like a cross between a goose and a duck. They have a strong head and neck with a darker crown and hindneck. The breast contains black spotting and the feathers are mostly dark brown. They range in size from 54–60 cm in height and weigh on average 750 grams. They mainly feed on grasses, waterlilies, water plants and occasionally insects and aquatic vertebrae.

==Habitat==
The wandering whistling duck lives in deep lagoons, flooded grasslands or dams. They enjoy the water and rarely leave the shore. They can swim and dive with ease.

==Breeding==
Breeding occurs during the tropical wet season usually between December and May. During this time six to fifteen eggs are laid in a nest not far from water and usually in high grass or a sheltered area.

==In Aboriginal language and culture==
The Bininj people of western Arnhem Land call this animal djilikuybi in the Bininj Kunwok language, and hunt it for food. In the Kundjeyhmi dialect, it is known as djirrbiyuk, and there is an Aboriginal outstation in Kakadu National Park which is named Djirrbiyuk after this bird. In Yolŋu languages it is known as guyiyi or walkuli.

<text>Captain Sir Henry Moore Jackson, (bapt. 13 August 1849 – 29 August 1908) was a British Army officer and colonial governor.

==Biography==
Jackson was born in Barbados to Walrond Jackson, who became the Anglican Bishop of Antigua, and Mary Shepherd. He received his education in England at Clifton College and the Royal Military Academy. After his education, Jackson went into the military, serving for the Royal Artillery from 1870 to 1885, reaching the rank of captain. In 1880, while still in the Royal Artillery, he was also appointed commandant of the Sierra Leone police.

It was after his military service that he became involved in the rule of British colonies. Starting with his appointment as commissioner for Turks and Caicos Islands from 1885 to 1890 and later Colonial Secretary of the Bahama Islands from 1890 to 1893. His next appointment came in 1894, when he was appointed as Colonial Secretary of Gibraltar, from 1894 to 1901. Here his education in science proved useful in implementing a plan to construct a new harbour. In August 1901, he was appointed Governor of the Leeward Islands, but his tenure there was short as in June the following year he was appointed Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner of the Western Pacific, combined with the position of Consul-General for the Western Pacific Islands.

He arrived in Fiji to take up the position in September 1902, and is credited as having promoted the idea of British rule to the natives of Fiji. Australian Methodists protested against his appointment as he was a Catholic, provoking counter-protests in Fiji. The last position he held was Governor of Trinidad and Tobago, which he held until his death on 29 August 1908.

Jackson received several honours, including: Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1899, promoted to Knight Grand Cross in 1908, and member of the Order of St. Gregory the Great in 1904.

Jackson died in London on 29 August 1908 and was buried at St Mary Magdalen Church, Mortlake.

==Family==

In 1881, Jackson married Emily Shea, daughter of Sir Edward Dalton Shea. He was the father of Basil Jackson, chairman of BP. In 1880, Jackson converted to Catholicism.

<doc id="1241557" wikidata="Q675245" url="?curid=1241557" title="Lausanne HC">
<text>Lausanne Hockey Club is an ice hockey team based in the city of Lausanne, Switzerland, which competes in the National League (NL). During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the HC Lausanne signed National Hockey League players Martin St. Louis and Andy Roach.

The team plays its home games in the 10,000-seat Vaudoise Aréna.

==History==
Founded in 1922, the Lausanne Hockey Club is one of the oldest clubs in Switzerland. They played for sixteen years at Chalet-à-Gobet, in the city heights. In 1938, LHC moved their headquarters to Montchoisi where, in 1941, they merged with Star HC to become the Montchoisi Hockey Club. On November 6, 1949, the team of Lausanne chose their original name: Lausanne Hockey Club. It is with this name that they started off in the Swiss national league.

Relegated to Nationalliga B in 1954, they powered back to the Nationalliga A on March 2, 1957 and remained there until 1961. For the next seventeen years, LHC remained at the Nationalliga B level where they had occasional success. On February 18, 1978, in front of over 7,000 fans, Lausanne Hockey Club obtained promotion to Nationalliga A, defeating HC Davos 8 goals to 4. After three seasons spent in the highest league, LHC, following the loss of a player in a car accident, was relegated to NLB. They remained there from 1981 to 1984 before falling to the 1. Liga while also moving to the International Ice Center at Malley (CIGM) where they still play today. They then played one season in first League (84-85) and made a round trip to NLB (85-86), to be back in the first League. Three years later they reached the finals in 1989 and obtain their promotion to NLB.

In 1992, the club&#x27;s survival was threatened by a bankruptcy. The team saved itself from relegation to the 1. Liga (season 1992-1993). The season 1993-1994 saw participation in the finals to access the national League A, finals played in five games against Rapperswil, the latter winning it over. At the beginning of the 1994-1995 season, Lausanne Hockey Club was designated as the Nationalliga B favorite to access the NLA. Against GCK Lions during the finals and after five games, the decisive match was won by Lausanne 8 to 0. In the 1995-1996 season, after a series of losses the club decided to fire their head coach. The change didn&#x27;t prevent Lausanne from being relegated to NLB at the end of the season. During the following four seasons, the LHC occupied the middle of the NLB ranking until 2000-2001 when they were at the head of the championship during almost the whole season. Lausanne won the title of champion of NLB and defeated HC La Chaux-de-Fonds for the promotion games. Winning against the HCC in six matches, LHC was back in NLA for the 2001-2002 season.

After a relegation in the 2004–05 season, Lausanne played the role of “favorite” for the other teams of the NLB. In April 2007, Canadians Barry Alter and Ken Lockett were introduced to the public as new majority owners of the club to help the club through financial difficulties. With the introduction of former coach Jim Koleff to the ownership group, later represented by his wife following his death, Lausanne was also backed by Hugh Quennec with interest already in fellow professional club, Genève-Servette HC.

The club tried to reach the NLA once again through promotion, but failed twice in the promotion games 2008–09 and the 2009–10 seasons, losing both times against EHC Biel in seven games. In the 2012–13 season, after a slow start into the regular season, Lausanne won the NLB championship for the 7th time, defeating EHC Olten in the play-off final. In the following promotion games, Lausanne defeated the SCL Tigers in six games to reach again the NLA for the 2013–14 season.

In 2013, following the series of promotion / relegation blocks against the SCL Tigers, the club moved up in the National League A with four wins and two defeats. During the 2014–15 season, their second in the NLA, the team averaged 6,711 spectators per game, ranking them third in the league in term of attendance.

In February 2016, American businessman Ken Stickney acquired the majority of shares of Lausanne from Quennec. Stickney was previously president of EHC Kloten and a member of Avenir Sport Entertainment LLC (ASE), the owner of the club.

In April 2016, the Lausanne released Danish head coach Heinz Ehlers after failing to make the playoffs for the 2015–16 season. Ehlers had achieved with the playoff appearances in 2014 and 2015, the largest club successes in the NLA until then. His was succeeded by Daniel Ratushny on April 26, 2016. Under Ratushny, the team used an overly defensive style capitalizing on opportunistic offense. Enjoying initial success they finished the 2016–17 regular season in fourth place. In the playoffs, however, LHC did not find victory in the quarter-final&#x27;s against HC Davos, suffering a series sweep.

Following 12 points in their first 10 games in the 2017–18 season, Ratushny was let go of his coaching duties on 11 October 2017. He was replaced on an interim basis by former Lausanne youth coach and fellow Canadian, Yves Sarault, and later announced to remain for the remainder of the season. However, with the club still struggling into the new year placing third from the bottom of the league, a second coaching change was announced as Sarault was replaced by John Fust on 8 February 2018.

==Venues==

The home games of the Lausanne HC were played in the CIG de Malley from 1984 to 2017 and had an official capacity of 8,000 spectators. While waiting for completion of a new arena in the 2017–18 season, Lausanne moved to a temporarily built ice hockey arena known as the 2.0 Malley, which sat 6,700 spectators. It was established as the largest temporary ice hockey arena in the world.

The new arena opened in September 2019. The new ice rink received the sponsorship name Vaudoise Aréna, after the insurance company Vaudoise.

<text>The South African shelduck or Cape shelduck (Tadorna cana) is a species of shelduck, a group of large goose-like birds which are part of the bird family Anatidae, which also includes the swans, geese and ducks. This is a common species native to southern Africa.

This is a long bird which breeds mainly in Namibia and South Africa. In the austral winter, many birds move north-east from the breeding range to favoured moulting grounds, where sizable concentrations occur.

This species is mainly associated with lakes and rivers in fairly open country, breeding in disused mammal holes, usually those of the aardvark. Pairs tend to be very nomadic when not in breeding season.

==Taxonomy==
The South African shelduck was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other geese, ducks and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas cana&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Grey-headed goose&quot; from the Cape of Good Hope that the English ornithologist John Latham had described in 1785 in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The South African shelduck is now placed with five other species in the genus &quot;Tadorna&quot; that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822. The genus name comes from the French name &quot;Tadorne&quot; for the common shelduck. The specific epithet &quot;cana&quot; is from Latin &quot;canus&quot; meaning &quot;grey&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Adult South African shelducks have ruddy bodies and wings strikingly marked with black, white and green. The male has a grey head, and the female has a white face and black crown, nape and neck sides. Note the colour on the females head is highly variable. In flight they can be hard to distinguish from Egyptian geese. Juveniles are duller in appearance. Young females lack the white on the head, excluding white eye circles. Males make a deep &quot;honk&quot; or &quot;hoogh&quot; call while the female tends to produce a louder, sharper &quot;hark&quot;.

South African shelduck is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

<text>Khalilou Fadiga (born 30 December 1974) is a Senegalese former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

He started his youth career at the Paris-based clubs Paris Saint Germain and Red Star before going to FC Liège in the Belgian League. He made his senior debut at FC Liège in the 1994–1995 season before playing for Lommel (KVSK United) and Club Brugge. After a loan spell with Auxerre in 2000, he signed permanently for the club in 2001.

In the summer of 2003, he was signed by Inter. At Inter, doctors discovered that he had heart problems and he never appeared for the team. He opted not to retire. After leaving Inter, he had brief stints at Bolton, Derby County, Coventry City, Gent, Germinal Beerschot and KSV Temse.

He earned 37 caps for the Senegal national team. He was part of the Senegal team that defeated reigning champions France in the opening fixture of the 2002 World Cup and made it to the quarter-finals. He was also part of the team that finished runner-up in the 2002 African Cup of Nations.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Fadiga moved to France when he was six years old. Fadiga began his career at Paris Saint-Germain in France but failed to make an impression, and so was transferred to fellow Parisian club, Red Star, before moving to Belgian club RFC Liège.

===Lommel===
It was in Belgium that he found the profile that was to launch his international career. After one season he moved from FC Liège to Lommel, which is now KVSK United. He played two seasons at Lommel before he was spotted by Club Brugge.

===Club Brugge===
Fadiga quickly became a fan favorite. He scored nine goals in 67 appearances. In September 2000, the midfielder returned to France when he signed for Auxerre.

===Auxerre===
In all, he played in 82 league games for the French club, scoring 10 goals, as well as appearing in the Champions League and UEFA Cup during season 2002–03. In his final season at Auxerre, he helped them win the 2002–03 Coupe de France, playing in the final as they defeated Paris Saint-Germain.

===Internazionale===
Fadiga moved to Internazionale in the summer of 2003, but the discovery of heart problems did not allow him to feature for the Italian club, apart from appearing in a few friendly games during the summer. He was released from the San Siro side after just one season but decided against retirement despite his heart problems.

===Bolton Wanderers===
English club Bolton Wanderers signed Fadiga for the 2004–05 season after he passed a medical. However, before he made an appearance for Bolton, he collapsed prior to a match in October, and had to be fitted with a defibrillator due to an irregular heartbeat. Despite stating his desire to return to the game, medical specialists urged him to retire, warning that if during a game his chest was knocked the defibrillator could fail, leading to instant death. However, following a period of rest and passing a medical, Fadiga returned to the Bolton squad in early 2005 and played in five games.

At the start of the 2005–06 campaign, Fadiga was loaned to Derby County of the Football League Championship, making four appearances. On his return to the Reebok Stadium, he took part in ten games, two of them in the UEFA Cup, before eventually being released in May 2006.

===Coventry City===
Without a club at the start of the 2006–07 season, he went on trial with Portsmouth and played for their reserve team. He also had trials at Watford and Hull City, before eventually signing a four-month contract with Coventry City on 23 February 2007. In April 2007, he suffered a serious achilles injury in the home game against Preston, and it ended his time at Coventry.

===Return to Belgium===
He returned to his wife&#x27;s homeland, signing with AA Gent. After one year, he moved in June 2008 to Germinal Beerschot, but left Beerschot after short time in December 2008. He signed for Third Division club KSV Temse in 2011, before retiring from the game.

==Personal life==
Fadiga is married to a Belgian woman and has two kids, Noah and Naoel. Noah followed in his footsteps in becoming a professional footballer. Fadiga also holds Belgian nationality.

<doc id="1241566" wikidata="Q747813" url="?curid=1241566" title="Paradise shelduck">
<text>The paradise shelduck (Tadorna variegata), also known as the paradise duck, or in Māori, is a species of shelduck, a group of goose-like ducks, which is endemic to New Zealand. Johann Friedrich Gmelin placed it in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; with the ducks, geese, and swans. Both the male and female have striking plumages: the male has a black head and barred black body and the female has a white head with a chestnut body. They weigh between and are between in length.

Paradise shelducks mate for life and usually live as pairs, and moult their feathers from December to February. They are primarily herbivorous, and mostly graze on pasture grasses and clover, but have been observed eating a wide range of invertebrates. They are seasonally hunted as a game bird throughout New Zealand, and today the IUCN Red List classifies them as a species of least concern.

==Taxonomy==

The paradise shelduck was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other ducks, swans, and geese in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas variegata&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Variegated goose&quot; from New Zealand that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The naturalist Joseph Banks had provided Latham with a water-colour drawing of the duck by Georg Forster who had accompanied James Cook on his second voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The picture of a female bird was drawn in April 1773 at Dusky Sound, a fiord on the southwest corner of New Zealand. This picture is now the holotype for the species and is held by the Natural History Museum in London. The paradise shelduck is now placed with five other species in the genus &quot;Tadorna&quot; that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822. The genus name comes from the French word &quot;Tadorne&quot; for the common shelduck. The specific epithet &quot;variegata&quot; is from the Latin &quot;variegatus&quot; meaning &quot;variegated&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. Other common names include painted duck, pari, parry, parrie, and pūtangitangi in Māori.

==Description==
The paradise shelduck is a colourful, large-bodied species of duck that differs in features depending on the sex. Both females and males have chestnut-colour undertails, primarily black wing feathers with green secondary wing feathers, and upper wing surface feathers that are white. They have black legs and webbed feet for swimming. Paradise shelducks are the largest of the &quot;Tadorna&quot; species, measuring in length and between in weight, averaging in males and in females, with a wingspan of around .

The adult male has a blue-black head and neck, with a black rump and tail; the back and flank are lightly flecked with a pale yellow colour. The wings of males have contrasting white upper-coverts and black remiges, metallic green speculum feathers, and rusty brown tertials feathers. The male also has a dark grey flecked with pale-yellow breast and abdomen, chestnut undertail and underwing, and black iris, bill, legs, and feet. The female, unlike the male, has an entirely white head and neck with a dark grey back heavily flecked with pale yellow. The rest is very similar to the male with the female&#x27;s body being dark or light chestnut depending on age and stage of molting.

The downy young are white with a brown crown and brown stripes from crown to tail. Juvenile males look much like the adult males, but the females are smaller with a white patch at the base of the bill. The females assume their white head during the first molt and 1–2 months after fledging their breast and abdomen turn dark chestnut.

The vocal calls differ from male to female. The male belts a di-syllabic honk like a goose when in flight or when alarmed. The male gives off a deep &quot;zonk-zonk honk&quot;, while the female is characterised by a penetrating &quot;zeek-zeek&quot;.
Male and fledgling paradise shelducks can be confused with the vagrant Australian shelduck which has a similar size, shape, and posture when swimming, on land, and when in flight. However, paradise shelducks lack the white collar, white parts around the eye and base of the bill, and the chestnut-coloured breast band.

==Distribution and habitat==
Paradise shelducks are the most widely distributed waterfowl in New Zealand. They inhabit the North Island, South Island, offshore islands such as Little Barrier Island, Kapiti Island, Great Barrier Island, and Stewart Island. They are most numerous in the North Island, Hawkes Bay, Poverty Bay, Taranaki and in Tongariro National Park, while scattered populations are present in Waikato and Wellington. Paradise Shelducks are uncommonly found on the Canterbury Plains, and generally not found in the high parts of the mountains.

Their preferred habitat is pasture, tussock grassland, and wetlands both on the mainland and on offshore islands. They are common around the hilly farmland characterised by fertile riversides, farm dams, and natural pools of the North Island. On the South Island, they can commonly be found in the tussock river valleys and high-country lakes while a small number can be found in the mountain streams, coastal flats, and brackish inlets. Around water bodies are the preferred breeding habitat for which to use as a nursery area for young, the quality or depth of water does not influence the selection, but available vantage points with long views to or from water do influence the selection. Many chosen places have a grassland at the edge of the water and a cover for refuges which is dense, such as reedbeds and forest. This has the purpose of the birds being able to feed close to the water&#x27;s safety, and lakes surrounded by dense vegetation might be chosen as well to feed at night.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The male adopts a threat posture by dropping his head low with the bill horizontal to the ground. If a female notices a threat on the water she responds by stretching out her neck and body while swimming towards the threat, swinging her body back and forth, and making a high-pitched call. On land she will lower her head and charge. Males will respond to the females by charging with her or taking on a &quot;high and erect&quot; posture. In this posture, the male will stretch its neck and head upwards and forwards, raise its feathers on the lower neck, call rapidly, and pivot between facing the threat and the female. When a predator threatens an adult pair with young, the parents will adopt the &quot;broken wing display&quot;. The pair will run away from the young in a crouched position, raising and lowering its half-opened wings to distract the predator. Once the predator follows the pair away from the young, one of the adults will return to them.

===Breeding===
Paradise shelducks first breed in their second or third years. They form long-term pair bonds, often lasting for life, and defend their territories. If one of the pair dies, the other will keep the same territory and will find another mate. They have a long breeding season, lasting from August to December. Mating displays are not elaborate, consisting of a female inciting a male to attack other mates or females; the winner of the fight is then chosen as a partner. The paradise shelduck can nest in a variety of places including inside hollow logs, under fallen logs, in-ground holes or trees up to high, rabbit burrows, under haystacks, piles of fence posts, tussocks, in rock crevices, under buildings, among tree roots, or in culverts. Clutches usually range from 5 to 15 eggs but typically 8 to 10, with most clutches numbering over 12 being a collective nest for two females. The success rate for eggs laid is 83% hatched and a survival rate for hatchlings is 89%.

The incubation period lasts for 30 to 35 days, with only the female looking after the nest 21 to 22 hours a day, and only leaving at dawn and dusk for food for 1 hour each time; the male only stands next to the nest after the eggs have hatched. The fledging period for the downy young lasts on average eight weeks; parenting is shared during this time with the young feeding independently and being kept close to the nest in a radius of around .

They typically live around 2.3 years, although some individuals live much longer, with the longest-lived known individual being 23 years.

The moulting season lasts from December to February; these moulting flocks were an important food source for the early Māori people. Māori did not hunt the birds during the breeding seasons to conserve populations, rather hunting during the moulting season when the birds could not fly; this selective hunting ensured healthy populations for culling. During the moulting season, distinct flocks will gather at traditional sites; the one- and two-year-old birds arrive first, followed by the failed breeders, and then by the successful breeders arriving late January. At moulting sites, the birds gather in open water with high open hillsides surrounding them acting as vantage points; many sites also have dense vegetation for refuge. Early departures from moulting sites begin in March and April, when adults will return to their distinct breeding territories.

===Food and feeding===
The paradise shelduck is a diurnal omnivore. The adults are primarily herbivorous preferring pasture grasses and clover while the young eat mostly aquatic insects for the first five weeks of life before grazing on land. They can feed on a variety of food including grazing or pasture crops, seed heads of grasses and weeds, earthworms, insects, and a variety of crustaceans. An extensive record of one bird&#x27;s diet from the Canterbury district, South Island, New Zealand shows a wide range of leaves and seeds of terrestrial herbs, terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, and some aquatic plants.

== Threats and conservation ==
The paradise shelduck originally had no predators but now with introduced predators such as stoats and weasels, some smaller populations can become threatened. The only group of parasites that affects the Paradise shelduck are the helminths which consist of flukes (Trematodes), tapeworms (Cestodes), and roundworms (Nematodes), with only the flatworms not living symbiotically with the host. Only periodic cases of avian botulism have been reported to affect populations.

In relation to diseases, recent research discovered the presence of the bacterium &quot;Chlamydia psittaci&quot; on Paradise shelducks. Different bacteria genotypes were identified in the samples of the survey and this species has been affected by genotype C. This type of bacterium is associated with important diseases not only in birds but also humans. However, the possible impact of the disease still needs to be determined and assessed.

=== Hunting ===
Hunting of the species happens throughout the islands where harvest numbers range from 5% to 48% depending on the region, with an average of just over 30%. The hunting season usually starts on the first Saturday of May and ends on the 31st of July. Daily bag limits range from 6 to 25 depending on the region.

=== Conservation ===
Populations of the paradise shelduck used to be much smaller during pre-settlement times due to the increased forest cover but after the settlers began to inhabit the island and clear the land for pastures the populations eventually began to rise. But before the population could rise, it fluctuated dramatically because of overhunting and exploitation by the settlers. Only through protective measures between 1900 and 1920 and limited shooting in the South Island from 1923 to 1939, could the population rise to historical heights by 1935.
Today the Paradise shelduck is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be a species of least concern with stable populations, with a population in the range of 600,000 to 700,000.

<text>The radjah shelduck (&quot;Radjah radjah&quot;), is a species of shelduck found mostly in New Guinea and Australia, and also on some of the Moluccas. It is known alternatively as the raja shelduck, black-backed shelduck, or in Australia as the Burdekin duck.

== Taxonomy ==
The specific name &quot;radjah &quot; is from the Moluccan name &quot;Radja&quot; for the radjah
shelduck on the island of Buru in Indonesia.

Formerly placed in the genus &quot;Tadorna&quot;, it differs markedly from other members in external morphology and mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data, suggesting its status should be reinvestigated. Current classification places it in its own monotypic genus &quot;Radjah&quot;.

== Description ==

Both the male and female of the species are mostly white, with dark wing-tips and a distinctive &quot;collar&quot; of dark feathers. When viewed from above, during flight or with wings outstretched, green bands are visible on the tops of their wings. To communicate, the female utters a harsh rattle while the male emits a breathy, &quot;sore-throat&quot; whistle.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The radjah shelduck inhabits the mangrove forests and coastline of New Guinea (West Papua and Papua New Guinea) and Australia, and some of the Moluccas in eastern Indonesia. In Australia, its primary range is coastal, tropical northern Australia, extending as far south as central Queensland, west through the upper regions of the Northern Territory (including Kakadu National Park) to the Kimberley in Western Australia. The radjah shelduck is listed as a protected bird in all the states of Australia, and penalties are enforced for harming or disturbing them.

The species prefers the salty waters of mangrove flats and paperbark tree swamps, but will visit all manner of brackish and freshwater swamps, lagoons, lakes, estuaries, river deltas, and billabongs further inland during the wet season.

== Behaviour ==
The radjah shelduck forms long-term, bonded pairs, and they are usually encountered in lone pairs or small flocks. During the rainy season, the males commonly become very irritable, and have been observed attacking their mates.

The ducks&#x27; preferred diet consists mainly of mollusks, aquatic or other insects, worms, aquatic weeds, sedge materials and algae. Pairs start searching for nesting sites during the months of January and February. They nest close to their primary food source, often in the hollow limbs of dead or dehydrated trees, which makes habitat destruction a particular issue.

The radjah shelduck does not use nesting materials apart from some self-supplied down feathers. Egg-laying is usually completed by May or June, but depends on the extent of the wet season. The clutches range from 6 to 12 eggs. Incubation time is about 30 days.

<doc id="1241571" wikidata="Q1428417" url="?curid=1241571" title="The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus">
<text>The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus is a British concert film hosted by and featuring the Rolling Stones, filmed on 11–12 December 1968. It was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who proposed the idea of a &quot;rock and roll circus&quot; to Jagger. The show was filmed on a makeshift circus stage with Jethro Tull, The Who, Taj Mahal, Marianne Faithfull, and the Rolling Stones. John Lennon and his fiancee Yoko Ono performed as part of a one-shot supergroup called The Dirty Mac, featuring Eric Clapton on guitar, Mitch Mitchell (of The Jimi Hendrix Experience) on drums, and the Stones&#x27; Keith Richards on bass. The recently formed Led Zeppelin had been considered for inclusion, but the idea was rejected. (As the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend recalled, an earlier idea for a circus-themed concert tour had been floated; it would have featured the Stones, the Who, and the Small Faces.)

The film was meant to be aired on the BBC, but the Rolling Stones withheld it, contending that they did so because they felt their performance was substandard; they were clearly exhausted after 15 hours of filming (and some indulgence in drugs). It was Brian Jones&#x27; last appearance with the Rolling Stones; he drowned some seven months later while the film was being edited. Some speculate that another reason for not releasing the film was that the Who, who were fresh off a concert tour, upstaged the Stones on their own production. The show was not released commercially until October 1996.

== Concept and performance ==
The project was conceived by Mick Jagger as a way to promote the Stones&#x27; album &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; beside conventional press and concert appearances. Jagger approached Lindsay-Hogg, who had directed promos for two Rolling Stones songs in 1968, and would go on to direct the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; documentary, to make a full-length TV show for them. According to Lindsay-Hogg, the idea of combining rock music and a circus setting came to him when he was trying to come up with ideas; he drew a circle on a piece of paper and free-associated.

The Rolling Stones and their guests performed in a replica of a seedy big top on a British sound stage—the Intertel (V.T.R. Services) Studio, Wycombe Road, Wembley—in front of an invited audience. The performances began at around 2 pm on 11 December 1968, but setting up between acts and reloading cameras took longer than planned, which meant that the final performances took place at almost 5 o&#x27;clock in the morning on the 12th.

By that time the audience and most of the Rolling Stones were exhausted. It was only due to Jagger&#x27;s sheer enthusiasm and stamina, and Lindsay-Hogg&#x27;s patience and encouragement, that they kept going until the end. Regardless, Jagger was reportedly so disappointed with his and the band&#x27;s performance that he cancelled the airing of the film, and kept it from public view. Pete Townshend recalled:

Lindsay-Hogg recalled that the Stones&#x27; Brian Jones had phoned him the night before the scheduled filming in order to inform the director that he would not be participating in the film. &quot;I hate the Rolling Stones,&quot; Jones told him. Lindsay-Hogg spoke with Jones for about twenty minutes and convinced him to come to the filming. It would prove to be Jones&#x27;s final public performance with the Rolling Stones. For much of the Stones&#x27; set he is very low in the mix, although audio exists in which his guitar is much higher. His slide guitar on &quot;No Expectations&quot;, maracas on &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, and rhythm guitar on &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; remain clear. Ian Anderson remarked:

As well as marking the last live performance of Brian Jones with the band, it also marked the first time that long term collaborator Nicky Hopkins performed live with them, having contributed extensively to the &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; sessions. The last song, &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;, was sung live by Keith Richards and Mick Jagger to the pre-recorded tape from the studio album on which the song had been released.

According to Bill Wyman&#x27;s book, &quot;Rolling with the Stones&quot;, the Rolling Stones also performed &quot;Confessing the Blues&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot; and an alternative take of &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; with Brian Jones on guitar.

Of the Dirty Mac&#x27;s one-song, one-off performance, the journalist David Dalton, who attended the filming, wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 1970, &quot;Simply the presence of all these magicians together is completely overwhelming.&quot; After the group&#x27;s performance of Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Yer Blues,&quot; which segued into an extended, avant-garde jam featuring Ono&#x27;s wailing, Dalton described the audience as &quot;totally awestruck; they do not move or talk. It was breathtaking.&quot;

== Footage ==
The project was abandoned until Lindsay-Hogg attempted to edit the film in 1992 but, due to missing principal footage, the project was put on hold. Some of the footage of the concert was thought to be lost or destroyed until 1993, when it was discovered in a bin in the Who&#x27;s private film vault by the director/producer team Michael Gochanour and Robin Klein. Subsequent to their discovery, Gochanour and Klein completed the unfinished film in autumn 1996.

A significant segment, of the Who performing &quot;A Quick One&quot;, had been shown theatrically in the documentary &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; (1979), the only public viewing of the film until its eventual release. The full movie was restored, edited, and finally released on CD and video in 1996. Included on the recordings are the introductions for each act, including some entertaining banter between Jagger and Lennon.

This concert is the only footage of Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi performing as a member of Jethro Tull, during his brief two-week tenure as a replacement for Mick Abrahams. Coincidentally this is also the first live footage of Jethro Tull ever made; no footage of the original line-up with Abrahams (December 1967 – December 1968) is known to exist. The band mimed to the album version of &quot;A Song for Jeffrey&quot; and &quot;Fat Man,&quot; so the guitar heard is actually Abrahams, and not Iommi, who may not have known his part sufficiently after only a few days in the band. The Rolling Stones forced them to cut their rehearsal time short, although Ian Anderson sings and plays flute live on &quot;A Song For Jeffrey.&quot; &quot;Fat Man&quot; never made the final release, although it is not unreasonable to assume he also sang that live, as the released version (which appears on &quot;Stand Up&quot;) was not recorded until four months later. Finally, the footage shows Ian Anderson&#x27;s first clumsy attempts at his now famous flute-playing position of standing on one leg.

== Reception ==
In a 1996 review, Janet Maslin lauded the &quot;sleek young Stones in all their insolent glory presiding over this uneven but ripely nostalgic show&quot;; although &quot;rumor had it that the Stones... thought they looked tired and felt upstaged by the high-energy Who,&quot; &quot;it hardly looks that way as Mick Jagger&#x27;s fabulous performance nearly turns this into a one-man show.&quot; She called Jethro Tull&#x27;s performance a &quot;shaky start&quot; by &quot;arguably the most unbearable band of their day,&quot; said The Who &quot;turn up early and stop traffic, delivering a fiery performance,&quot; and notes Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;glass-shattering shrieks&quot; are &quot;dutifully&quot; backed by the Dirty Mac. She calls the concert-ending sing-along of &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; smug and condescending, a &quot;song about little people living in the real world.&quot;

== Theatrical releases ==
;October 1996
The film was premiered on 12 October 1996 at the Walter Reade Theater as part of the New York Film Festival.

;April 2019
In March 2019, it was announced that the film would be receiving a limited theatrical release in Dolby Cinema in early April, as the first concert film was due to be remastered with Dolby&#x27;s Atmos and Vision, in conjunction with what was still then the ongoing North American leg of the Rolling Stones&#x27; No Filter Tour (before it was later postponed). Indeed, a limited U.S. remastered theatrical release of the film ran during the first week of April 2019.

== Home media==
&quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; was released in October 1996 on VHS and laserdisc following two days of screenings at the Walter Reade Theater as part of the New York Film Festival.

A DVD version, produced by Gochanour and Klein, was released in October 2004, with audio remixed into Dolby Surround by Gochanour and co-producer Klein. The DVD includes footage of the show, along with extra features directed by Gochanour and Klein, which include previously &quot;lost&quot; performances, an interview with Pete Townshend, and three audio commentaries. Of particular interest in the Townshend interview is his description of the genesis of the Circus project, which he claims was initially meant to involve the performers travelling across the United States via train (a concept used for a short concert series in Canada that was later documented in the feature film &quot;Festival Express&quot;). The remastered DVD also includes a special four-camera view of The Dirty Mac&#x27;s performance of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yer Blues&quot; (showing Yoko Ono kneeling on the floor in front of the musicians, completely covered in a black sheet).

<text>The pink-eared duck (Malacorhynchus membranaceus) is a species of duck found in Australia.

== Description ==
The pink-eared duck has a large spatulate bill like the Australasian shoveler, but is smaller at 38–40 cm length. Its brown back and crown, black and white barred sides and black eye patches on its otherwise white face make this bird unmistakable. Juveniles are slightly duller, but otherwise all plumages are similar. Its vernacular name refers to a pink spot in the corner formed by the black head pattern; it is only noticeable at close distance however, making the seldom-used Australian name of zebra duck more appropriate.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The pink-eared duck was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name &quot;Anas membranacea&quot;. It is the only living member of the genus &quot;Malacorhynchus&quot;; a closely related, but slightly larger extinct form from New Zealand was described as Scarlett&#x27;s duck (&quot;Malacorhynchus scarletti&quot;). This peculiar duck may be most closely related to the shelducks but its relationships are enigmatic. It may be closer to the musk duck and the stiff-tails and, formerly placed in the paraphyletic &quot;perching ducks&quot;; it is in any case not close to the dabbling ducks.

This species is the only member of the order Anseriformes known to have carotenoid pigments in its feathers, in the characteristic pink &quot;ear&quot; spot.

The pink-eared duck was reportedly known as the New Holland duck by early colonists in Western Australia.

==Distribution==
Widely distributed throughout Australia and highly mobile, these ducks can appear anywhere there is standing water, especially in dry inland regions, where annual rainfall rarely exceeds .

==Food==

They are dependent on plankton, as well as crustaceans, mollusks and insects. Their bill is well designed for straining minute organisms, with pliable mandibular flaps that channel water in a manner that allow the ducks to filter algae and other plankton efficiently. They also feed by vortexing, in which two ducks spin about a central point with the head of one opposite the tail of the other, concentrating food in a gyrating water column.
==Breeding==
Nesting is stimulated by the drying and filling of pools that promote increased levels of organic material. In good years, large numbers of pink-eared ducks concentrate in shallow flood plains. However, when conditions do not meet specifications, reproduction may be completely curtailed.
== Relationship with humans ==
The pink-eared duck is hunted in all regions in Australia except Tasmania. According to Australian studies, duck hunting with shotguns causes injuries. An X-ray study of ducks caught using nets in Victoria found that between 6% and 19% of all hunted ducks live with embedded shot pellets in their bodies. The activity is opposed by animal welfare groups who consider the practice to be unacceptably cruel.

<doc id="1241575" wikidata="Q129036" url="?curid=1241575" title="Upland goose">
<text>The upland goose or Magellan goose (Chloephaga picta) is a sheldgoose of the shelduck-sheldgoose subfamily of the Anatidae, the biological family that includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and swans. Sheldgeese resemble true geese and display similar habits, yet they are more closely related to shelducks and ducks. The two recognized subspecies of upland goose are the continental &quot;picta&quot; subspecies and the insular (island) &quot;leucoptera&quot; subspecies.

This species nests and breeds close to water (rivers, ponds, oceans) either on the ground or near it among vegetation, usually in grasslands or coastal meadows in the Falkland Islands or in southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego at the beginning of the austral summer. Population estimates suggest the insular subpopulations are stable, but continental populations show a recent decline in abundance. Upland geese are herbivores, specializing in plant leaves, stems and seeds.

== Taxonomy ==

The upland goose was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other ducks, geese and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas picta&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Painted goose&quot; that had been included by the English ornithologist John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The species had been observed in 1775 on the Isla de los Estados (Staten Island) during Captain James Cook&#x27;s second voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The naturalist Joseph Banks had provided Latham with a water-colour drawing of the goose by Georg Forster who had accompanied James Cook. It is the holotype for the species and is held by the Natural History Museum in London. The upland goose is now placed with four other species in the genus &quot;Chloephaga&quot; that was introduced in 1838 by the English naturalist Thomas Campbell Eyton. The genus name comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;khloē&quot; meaning &quot;grass&quot; and &quot;-phagos&quot; meaning &quot;-eating&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;picta&quot; is from Latin &quot;pictus&quot; meaning &quot;painted.

There are strong morphological and genetic similarities between the bird fauna of the Falkland Islands and southern South America, and most native bird species are usually present in both insular and continental populations. The biogeography of the region suggests that these similarities exist because in the geological past, birds from the continent might have reached the Falkland Islands either across a former land connection, during periods of lowered sea levels, or through long-distance dispersal. Genetic analyses place the Magellan goose as a sister taxa to the kelp goose.

=== Subspecies ===
Two subspecies of upland goose are recognised. The smaller mainland form, &quot;picta&quot;, also known as the lesser Magellan goose, is found from central Chile and south-central Argentina south to Tierra del Fuego. The larger insular form, &quot;leucoptera&quot; or greater Magellan goose, is indigenous to the Falkland Islands, located to the east of the southern part of South America.

==Description==
Upland geese males are similar to other sheldgeese, notably the kelp goose (&quot;Chloephaga hybrida&quot;) due to their predominantly white plumage, while females resemble the ruddy-headed goose (&quot;C. rubidiceps&quot;) due to their similarly barred breast plumage. This species is 60–72.5 centimetres (23.6–28.5 in) long.

Greater Magellan geese (&quot;leucoptera&quot; subspecies) are the largest birds of the &quot;Chloephaga&quot; genus. Males typically weigh 3.5–4.5 kg (7.7–9.9 lbs) and females range from 2.9 to 3.5 kg (6.4–7.7 lbs). Lesser Magellan geese (&quot;picta&quot; subspecies) males weigh 2.7–3.6 kg (6.0–7.9 lbs) on average and females 2.9–3.5 kg (6.4–6.8 lbs).

Upland geese display strong sexual dimorphism in their plumage. Males have white heads and breast plumage with black legs, whereas females have reddish-brown heads and breast plumage with yellow-orange legs. However, two interbreeding morphs exist for males. One morph causes black-barred breast plumage while the other causes white breast plumage. A greenish-bronze speculum is also located on the inner secondary flight feathers of the adult male. Males make a whistling &quot;wheep&quot; sound, while females make a low, rattling &quot;a-rrr&quot; sound.

Upland geese molt both their primary and secondary feathers in ponds or sheltered sea inlets, usually between late November and early January. Molting frequency depends on breeding success to some degree, since most adults that molt have either not yet mated or failed to breed. Some greater Magellan geese skip this molt, retaining their ability to fly during the austral summer. While unusual, skipping this important process might have energetic advantages, since molting season can be very nutritionally taxing.

In Chapter VI of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, author Charles Darwin noted that the upland goose has webbing between its toes that appeared to be &quot;rudimentary in function, though not in structure&quot;, and concluded that this was a vestigial anatomical feature in this bird.

==Habitat and distribution==
=== Habitat ===
Upland geese usually live in small, scattered groups on most pasture types (temperate grasslands, arid lowland scrubs), favouring areas with short green grasses. However, recent land use changes towards crop fields and managed pastures have forced them to adapt to and colonize such modern landscapes.

=== Distribution ===

Upland geese occupy the southern South American Continent (southern and central Chile and Argentina) and the Falkland Islands, with a continental distribution ranging from central Chile/southern Argentina to Tierra del Fuego, near Antarctica. Lesser Magellan geese usually reside in Patagonia or southern Chile and migrate north during the winter towards central Argentina, to their wintering grounds. Southernmost populations are more likely to migrate, with migrants reaching flight speeds of over 40 km/h. In 2013, researchers identified a lesser Magellan goose in southern Brazil, redefining the northern edge of their wintering grounds. Greater Magellan geese, however, do not migrate and rarely leave the Falkland Islands. In general, population densities are highest around ponds and in green grasslands. Computer modelling of population ranges suggests that their distribution is favoured by the ample presence of green grasses to feed and breed in, and hindered by human presence, notably urbanization and oil extraction.
There is also a sizeable introduced population on the sub-Antarctic South Georgia Island.

==Behaviour and ecology==

=== Breeding ===
Upland goose breed in southern Patagonia or their native islands during the austral summer. They are monogamous, although divorce can occur, and generally return to breed in the same territory every year. After approximately two years from birth, females can start to lay eggs, and usually do so near their birthplace. Males begin breeding later and tend to settle farther away from where they were born. This sexual difference in dispersal distances causes the sex ratio of young to become biased towards the dispersing sex due to the inherent resource constraints of crowding. Therefore, upland geese tend to display a male-biased sex ratio. They breed non-colonially in densely-vegetated areas, generally in September and October on the mainland, and in November on the Falkland Islands. A large population of this species breeds in the New Island Nature Reserve, which was created in collaboration with Falkland Conservation.

Males attract females through a courtship display in which they whistle loudly, to which the female responds with softer cackles. As they are monogamous and territorial, a violent fight may break out if a male encroaches on another&#x27;s territory. Males have been found injured or dead after these fights.

The simple nest is either on the ground or within 1.5 m of it, usually concealed by dense vegetation, and often located near water. A clutch consists of 5-8 eggs which are incubated for about 1 month. When the chicks hatch, they are covered in greyish-brown down. They don&#x27;t remain in the nest for more than a day, quickly going to a nearby water source or feeding area, and are able to feed themselves from birth. They fledge in 9–10 weeks and reach maturity in 3 years.

=== Food and feeding ===
The upland goose is primarily a herbivore, feeding mostly of seeds, leaves, stems, and other plant matter. They are very gregarious, and flocks of thousands of birds can be found grazing in one pasture alone. They are considered pests by farmers due to the fact that they eat on the pastures that are used for cattle and sheep, and because they claim that upland geese significantly decrease crop yield. However, a recent study claims that while sheldgeese do reduce wheat cover, they do not reduce overall wheat yield and they might even provide an ecosystem service through weed grazing.

=== Threats and conservation ===
In the early 20th century, the Argentinian government declared the three Patagonian sheldgeese species (Ruddy-headed goose, Ashy-headed goose, and Upland goose) as pests due to claims of excessive grazing and negative effects on crop yields. Since then, wildlife agencies have encouraged hunting of upland geese across the entirety of their range and without restrictions on the number of birds killed. Consequently, population surveys started suggesting continental populations were declining. In 2008, all three species were classified as endangered by the Argentine government and hunting was banned, although some poaching still occurs, mostly on the mainland. Recently, fox predation has drastically reduced population numbers on the mainland, so national governments have established several protected areas throughout Patagonia in an attempt to conserve the species.

<text>The kelp goose (Chloephaga hybrida) is a species of waterfowl in tribe Tadornini of subfamily Anserinae. It is found in Argentina, Chile, and the Falkland Islands.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The kelp goose has two subspecies, the nominate &quot;C. h. hybrida&quot; and &quot;C. h. malvinarum&quot;.
==Description==

The kelp goose is long. Males of the nominate subspecies weigh and females . Subspecies &quot;C. h. malvinarum&quot; is heavier: Males weigh and females . The two subspecies have the same plumage but the sexes are completely different. Adult males are entirely white but for a black bill with a pink spot on the maxilla and yellow legs and feet. Adult females have a pale brown crown and chocolate brown head, neck, and mantle. Their breast and flanks have black and white bars and their back, tail, and undertail coverts are white. Their bill is pink and their legs and feet yellow. Juvenile males resemble adult females but with brown &quot;shoulders&quot; and greenish-yellow legs and feet. Juvenile females have a dark crown and dark uppertail coverts.

==Distribution and habitat==

The nominate subspecies of kelp goose is found on coastal southern Chile and Argentina including the Tierra del Fuego archipelago. &quot;C. h. malvinarum&quot; is found only on the Falkland Islands. Except when nesting, the species inhabits rocky coasts or shingle beaches with kelp beds offshore. It nests at coastal freshwater lakes.

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The nominate subspecies of kelp goose is found year-round along the southern Chile coast and in Tierra del Fuego. It is mostly sedentary, with some individuals moving further north in Chile and others north along the Atlantic coast of Argentina in the austral winter. &quot;C. h. malvinarum&quot; is also mostly sedentary throughout the Falklands, but some individuals move from more exposed offshore islands to larger ones in winter.

===Feeding===

The kelp goose is almost entirely vegetarian, though it probably ingests small invertebrates incidentally. It forages mostly by grazing though it sometimes dips under water to feed. On the coast it feeds on several species of seaweed and some algae. During breeding it feeds on grass and in winter sometimes on berries. During the summer, 100 or more non-breeding geese may gather on the shore.

===Breeding===

The kelp goose&#x27;s breeding season (up to hatching) on the mainland extends from October to January; that on the Falklands begins somewhat sooner and extends only to November. The species nests in pairs or loose groups. It builds a nest of grass lined with down, on the mainland near somewhat inland freshwater lakes and on the Falklands close to the shore. Nests are sited in vegetation or beside a boulder or driftwood. The clutch size is three to seven eggs. Males guard females during the incubation period of about 30 days. Young leave the nest shortly after the last egg hatches and fledging occurs 12 to 13 weeks after hatch. Both parents care for the young into winter.
===Vocalization===

Male and female kelp geese have different vocalizations: Males make a &quot;whistled &#x27;si-si-si&#x27;&quot; and females &quot;low honking &#x27;arnk-arnk&#x27;, &#x27;ooer&#x27; or &#x27;ooeroo&#x27; calls&quot;. Very young chicks make &quot;a double-noted &#x27;cheep&#x27;.&quot;

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the kelp goose as being of Least Concern. It has a large range, and though its population size is unknown it is believed to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified. It &quot;does not compete with human interests due to inaccessibility and [the] types of habitats preferred&quot; but &quot;[c]ould be at risk from spillage of oil or other toxic substances on rocky coasts.&quot;

<text>Hong Kong became an international transport hub of cargo and passengers soon after 1841. In air transport, Hong Kong International Airport acts as a major international hubs for both passenger and cargo. The ICAO code for the Hong Kong Flight Information Region (Hong Kong FIR) is VHHK, while ICAO code for Hong Kong in general starts with the prefix [[List of airports by ICAO code: V#VH - Hong_Kong|VH××]].

The Hong Kong International Airport and heliports are generally under the jurisdiction of the Civil Aviation Department of Hong Kong, while the only military airport is under the jurisdiction of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force. Helipads are commonly found in Hong Kong especially in large government buildings, and accourding to Hong Kong Government&#x27;s record, there are about 170 helicopter landing pads (helipads) in Hong Kong.

<doc id="1241585" wikidata="Q241198" url="?curid=1241585" title="Flying steamer duck">
<text>The flying steamer duck (Tachyeres patachonicus), also known as the flying steamer-duck or flying steamerduck, is a species of South American duck in the family Anatidae.

== Taxonomy and Systematics ==
The flying steamer duck is one of four steamer ducks, in the genus &quot;Tachyeres&quot;, which also includes the Fuegian steamer duck (&quot;Tachyeres pteneres&quot;), the Chubut steamer duck (&quot;Tachyeres leucocephalus&quot;), and the Falkland steamer duck (&quot;Tachyeres brachypterus&quot;). The steamer ducks are named for their method of mobility, as the manner in which they use wings and feet to paddle across the water resembles an old-time steam boat. The steamer ducks are members of the Southern Hemisphere shelducks clade Tadorninae. The three flightless species are monophyletic, with the flying steamer ducks splitting off phylogenetically. It is the only steamer duck which can fly, and the only one to occur on inland fresh waters. However, some individual male flying steamer ducks within the species are incapable of flight due to excessive size and wing loadings.

== Description ==
Though they are the smallest of the four &quot;Tachyeres&quot; species, flying steamer ducks share similar plumage traits with other steamer ducks including brown head and neck feathers with white stripes stretching from their eyes to the napes of their necks, and brown-gray gradient body feathers. Their underbellies are mostly white, and their feet are orange. Female flying steamer ducks have smaller bills relative to males that are orange with black tips, while males have darker gray bills with slight yellow accents. Flying steamer ducks are also sexually dimorphic to the extent that males are heavier but have smaller cranial elements and wingspans than females. Males and females both possess cornified orange carpal knobs on the proximal part of the carpometacarpus bone, and these knobs are used in display as well as interspecies and intraspecies combat by males.

Sexual dimorphism can also be observed in the duration and pitch of their various calls, which sound much like grunts. The females’ grunts have been described as lower pitched than the males’ grunts, and usually occur in rapid succession of similar pitch. Males have three distinct grunts that have been described as whistle-like, including a ‘rasping’ grunt, a ‘ticking’ grunt, and a ‘sibilant’ grunt.

Flying steamer ducks undergo three molts per annual cycle, and these molts vary widely with geographic location. The wear and degradation on the primary and secondary feathers of observed flying steamer ducks varies depending on the location and flight behavior of the individuals.

== Distribution and Habitat ==
Flying steamer ducks inhabit aquatic areas at the southern tip of South America, specifically Chile and Argentina, Tierra del Fuego, and the Falkland Islands. Genetic comparisons of Falkland Island steamer ducks suggest the species diverged from continental steamer duck species between 2.2 and 2.6 million years ago, coinciding with a proposed land bridge that may have once connected the Falkland Islands to the mainland. The three steamer duck species that inhabit the mainland share a common ancestor roughly 15,000 years ago, and the species show genetic differentiation as well as different stages between flightless-ness and flying ability. For this reason, steamer ducks have been praised as an excellent potential genus for studying the evolution of flightless-ness in birds. Flying steamer ducks are widely distributed compared to other steamer duck species, likely due to their flying ability, and have been observed to reside in both freshwater and marine environments throughout Chile, Argentina, and the Falkland Islands.

== Behavior and Ecology ==

=== Breeding ===
Little is known about the breeding rituals of flying steamer ducks. They are thought to be mostly monogamous and spend much of their time together in pairs. They engage in highly ritualized mating, in which the male and female begin by dipping their bills into the water at increasingly fast paces before the female submerges almost completely into the water and is mounted by the male, after which the female and male raise their bills high into the air in a hostile fashion and grunt audibly.

=== Food and Feeding ===
Both flightless and flying steamer ducks engage in foraging behaviors with interspecific and intersexual differences. Flying steamer ducks have almost exclusively been observed to forage in pairs, preferring to dive either around deep-water kelp beds or around shallow water zones. Males and females do not show consistencies among pairs in terms of who is the first to dive, but within pairs the first to dive is consistent in all observed diving instances. Flying steamer ducks share dietary preferences with other steamer duck species and have been reported to feed on mollusks and crustaceans as well as other marine invertebrates, but little is known about the precise species that steamer ducks prey on.

=== Threats ===
Both flying steamer ducks and flightless steamer ducks experience nest predation by various avian and mammalian predators, including Chimango Caracaras, *Crested Caracaras, the Fuegian Culpeo Fox, and the introduced American mink.  Besides nest predators, flying steamer ducks are threatened only by competition for resources. Both the males and females are notoriously pugnacious and have been described as intensely territorial and often unnecessarily aggressive towards other individuals and other species, regardless of whether or not that species poses a threat to or lives in competition with the flying steamer ducks. Flying steamer ducks have been observed to target entire flocks of Silvery grebes and Hooded grebes and have also been observed to kill Red shovelers for seemingly no apparent reason. Male flying steamer ducks attack by grabbing their opponents by the neck and hitting their opponents on the head, neck or body using their carpal wing knobs.

== Status ==
The flying steamer ducks are not an endangered species and are categorized as a Least Concern species, however increased nest predation of flightless steamer duck nests by American minks was reported to be a potential future threat to duck populations in Tierra del Fuego wildlife areas.

<text>The Fuegian steamer duck (Tachyeres pteneres) or the Magellanic flightless steamer duck, is a flightless duck native to South America. It belongs to the steamer duck genus &quot;Tachyeres&quot;. It inhabits the rocky coasts and coastal islands from southern Chile and Chiloé to Tierra del Fuego, switching to the adjacent sheltered bays and lakes further inland when breeding.

==Description==
This is the largest of the steamer duck species. It is a massively built waterfowl at and in length, with the males noticeably larger than the females. Males weigh an average of while females weigh around on average. The wingspan is , the wings being too small to functionally allow the birds to take flight. Instead, the wings are used like paddles to help skim rapidly across the surface of the water. This species outweighs any other wild species called &quot;duck&quot; and is about the same mass as the largest wild geese in the world, although this species is only distantly related to most true ducks (for example of the genus &quot;Anas&quot;). On males, the head and neck is blue-gray, with paler coloration crown and forehead. He has a narrow white eye-ring which continuing backwards as stripe and a reddish-brown throat. His abdomen, ventral area and undertail coverts are white and the tail is grey. Females are a darker gray-brown on the head and dark reddish on the throat. Her body and wings as males, but she may have brown/wine colouring on feathers. The juvenile is similar to the female but slightly duller colored.

==Life history==
This species either nests near water obscured in dense, shrubby vegetation or in abandoned penguin nest burrows in September through December. Between 4 and 11 eggs are laid, with an average clutch of 9. The ivory eggs measure and weigh around . Incubation occurs for 28 to 40 days. The young fledge at 120–130 days and are driven from the parent&#x27;s territory by their parents and form flocks with other ousted immature steamer ducks. They become sexually mature at 2 to 3 years of age. Adult males are known to be extremely aggressive during mating season, including towards other waterfowl, but may join mixed-species winter flocks without incident.

There are several potential predators of eggs and young birds: foxes, caracaras, gulls, skuas and giant petrels. In January 2009, a marine otter was seen preying on a chick of this species in Puñihuil. Healthy adults may have no natural predators. This species lives principally off of saltwater molluscs, crustaceans and small fish. During the breeding season, they tend to eat and feed their young small snails, insect larvae, amphipods and isopods.

This species is locally infamous for the aggressive disposition of adult males. Incidents have allegedly occurred where a raging male was placed by a misguided collector among adults of various other waterfowl species and killed all the other birds with its powerful, spurred wings.

<text>Jamie Lawrence Ashdown (born 30 November 1980) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He spent a large part of his career at Portsmouth, for whom he made the majority of his professional appearances.

==Club career==
===Reading===
Born in Reading, Berkshire, Ashdown began his career at Reading when he was eight years old. Ashdown then established a reputation as an exciting prospect for the club. He signed his professional contract with Reading in February 1998.

On 12 September 2000, Ashdown made his league debut for the club, coming on as a 74th-minute substitute for Phil Whitehead, and played the rest of the game, as he kept a clean in a 5–0 win against Oldham Athletic. This turns out to be his only appearance of the 2000–01 season. Ashdown made his first appearance of the 2001–02 season against Colchester United in the Football League Trophy and helped them win 2–1. Following this, he was offered a new contract by Reading. After Whitehead suffered an injury, Ashdown started in goal once again, coming against Chesterfield on 1 December 2001, as the club lost 1–0. Following this, he signed a contract extension with Reading, keeping him until 2004. Ashdown appeared in the next two matches before the arrival of Marcus Hahnemann and the recovery of Whitehead saw him return to the substitute bench. At the end of the 2001–02 season, he made four appearances in all competitions. Following his loan spell at AFC Bournemouth came to an end, Ashdown returned as the club&#x27;s second choice goalkeeper for the rest of the 2002–03 season. But he made his an appearance against Grimsby Town on 5 October 2002 and kept a clean sheet, in a 3–0 win.

The start of the 2003–04 season saw Ashdown remain as Reading&#x27;s second choice goalkeeper and this lasted until he joined Rushden &amp; Diamonds on loan. Following loan spell at Rushden &amp; Diamonds came to an end, Ashdown made his first appearance of the 2003–04 season against Cardiff City on 16 March 2004 and helped the side win 3–2. As a result, he broke into Reading&#x27;s first-team squad as a result of an injury to first-choice &#x27;keeper Marcus Hahnemann. Ashdown kept three clean sheets out of the thirteen appearances he made for the Royals. In the summer of 2004 Ashdown declined Reading&#x27;s offer of a new contract and instead signed for Premier League club Portsmouth before the start of the 2004–05 season to provide competition for Shaka Hislop, with a view to replacing the veteran on his retirement. Because he was under 23 at the time, Ashdown was subjected of a compensation as a result of him moving to the club. Eventually, the agreement was both reached for both sides.

====Loan Spells====
In March 2001, Ashdown was loaned out to Gravesend &amp; Northfleet for a month. A year later, he joined Arsenal for work experience placement for the rest of the 2001–02 season. Despite not being used in the first team, Ashdown said: &quot;I&#x27;m still learning the game, but I&#x27;m ready to take that step up if the opportunity arises. I played five games for Arsenal reserves and did work with Bob Wilson and David Seaman nearly every day. It was all about gaining experience and playing football at that level and it has been a great help to my confidence.&quot;

At the start of the 2002–03 season, Ashdown joined Bournemouth on a one-month loan. Ashdown made his debut for Bournemouth, starting the whole game, in a 1–1 draw against Oxford United on 27 August 2002. Following a 1–0 win against Macclesfield Town four days later, he suffered an injury and this resulted in him returning to his parent club.

It was announced on 13 November 2003 when Ashdown joined Rushden &amp; Diamonds on a one-month loan deal. He made his debut for the club two days later on 15 November 2003, in a 2–1 loss against Hartlepool United. Since making his debut for Rushden &amp; Diamonds, Ashdown quickly became the club&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper and made an impression for the side, resulting in him &quot;earning several &#x27;Player of the month&#x27; awards&quot;. This lasted until Ashdown was recalled by his parent club in March. During his stay at Rushden &amp; Diamonds, he kept four clean sheets out of the nineteen appearances he made.

===Portsmouth===
Ashdown started his first season at Portsmouth as substitute goalkeeper but gained a starting place after an injury to Hislop. On 20 November 2004, he made his debut for the club, in a 3–1 loss against Manchester City. Ashdown started in the next five matches for Portsmouth before suffering a groin injury that kept him out for a month. After the departure of Harry Redknapp as manager and alleged comments by Hislop, a new goalkeeper, Kostas Chalkias, was brought to the club and given the first-team place. After a number of poor performances by Chalkias, he returned to the starting line–up against Newcastle United on 19 March 2005, as Portsmouth drew 1–1. Ashdown was again restored to the first team and remained there for the remainder of the season. At the end of the 2004–05 season, he made nineteen appearances in all competitions.

In August 2005, Portsmouth signed another goalkeeper, Sander Westerveld, and Ashdown was in competition with him at the beginning of the 2005–06 season for a first-team place. Westerveld started the season as first-choice &#x27;keeper. However, after a number of poor performances by Westerveld, he was dropped and Ashdown was again called on as Portsmouth&#x27;s number one goalkeeper, making his first appearance of the season against Everton on 10 September 2005 and kept a clean sheet, as the club won 1–0. In the second round of the League Cup match against Gillingham, Ashdown was at fault when he made two mistakes, including scoring an own goal, in a 3–2 loss, eliminating the club from the tournament. Despite this, he remained as Portsmouth&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper for the rest of the year, though his mistakes continued along the way. This lasted until Ashdown suffered an injury while warming up prior to a match against Fulham on 1 January 2006. After missing two matches, he returned to the starting line–up against Everton on 14 January 2006, as the club lost 1–0. With the return of former manager Harry Redknapp, Ashdown was dropped to second choice again after the arrival of Dean Kiely from Charlton Athletic in January 2006. At the end of the 2005–06 season, he went on to make seventeen appearances in all competitions. The 2006–07 season Ashdown faced even more competition from new high-profile signing David James. Even he returned in late 2006, Ashdown did not feature in the first team due to the presence of David James during the 2006–07 season. On 28 January 2007, he signed a contract with Portsmouth, keeping him until 2010.

The 2007–08 season saw Ashdown continuing to remain as Portsmouth&#x27;s second choice goalkeeper behind James. He made his first appearance for the club in over a year against Leeds United in the second round of the League Cup and kept a clean sheet, in a 3–0 win. Ashdown, once again, kept another clean sheet, in a 1–0 win against Burnley in the third round of the League Cup. Following the injury of James, he made his first league appearances in two years, starting the whole game, in a 1–0 loss against Blackburn Rovers. Ashdown then started in the last remaining three league matches of the 2007–08 season for the club. He picked up an FA Cup winners&#x27; medal with Portsmouth in 2008, but it was subsequently stolen. The stolen medal never resurfaced and the FA reissued Ashdown with a winners&#x27; medal. Despite not playing in the FA Cup win, he made five appearances in all competitions for the 2007–08 season.

At the start of the 2008–09 season, Ashdown continuing to remain as Portsmouth&#x27;s second choice goalkeeper behind James. Portsmouth played their first ever European match, against Vitória de Guimarães, which they won and thus qualified for the group stages of the UEFA Cup. His only appearance of the season came on 17 December 2008 against Heerenveen in the UEFA Cup match and kept a clean sheet, in a 3–0 win. However, a month later, he ruptured ligament in his ankle that eventually kept out for the next three months. The 2009–10 season saw Ashdown continuing to remain as Portsmouth&#x27;s second choice goalkeeper behind James. On 27 October 2009, he made his first appearance of the season, in a 4–0 win against Stoke City in the last sixteen of League Cup. A month later on 22 November 2009, Ashdown made his second appearance of the season and playing against Stoke City in the league for the second time, as the club, once again, lost 1–0. On 15 March 2010, he made his third appearance of the season against Liverpool, as the club lost 4–1. Following an injury of James against Tottenham Hotspur on 27 March 2010, Ashdown started in the next two matches and kept two consecutive clean sheets against Blackburn Rovers and Wigan Athletic between 3 April 2010 and 14 April 2010, in which Portsmouth were relegated. At the end of Portsmouth&#x27;s 2009–10 Premier League relegation season, he made eight appearances (playing six league games) in all competitions.

Following this, it was announced on 19 May 2010 that Ashdown was released by the club. However, before the start of the following season, he re-joined Portsmouth on a two–year contract after David James&#x27; departure to Bristol City. In the second round of the League Cup match against Crystal Palace on 24 August 2010, Ashdown helped the club progress to the next round after winning 4–3 in the penalty shootout following a 1–1 draw, in which he saved three penalties. Since returning to Portsmouth, he quickly was inserted as their first-choice goalkeeper. Ashdown&#x27;s proudest moment in a Portsmouth shirt was when he broke a post-war club record for most minutes without conceding a goal (636 minutes) between February and March 2011. Ashdown helped Portsmouth finish 16th in the Championship and made 50 appearances including the League Cup and FA Cup in a season.

At the start of the 2011–12 season, Ashdown remained as Portsmouth&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper, starting the first nine matches of the season. During which, he kept two consecutive clean sheets between 16 August 2011 and 20 August 2011 against Reading and Bristol City. However, Ashdown was dropped to the substitute bench in favour of Stephen Henderson. Following the departure of Henderson, he returned to the starting line–up against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 11 March 2012, as the club lost 2–0. Following this, Ashdown established himself as number one for the rest of the 2011–12 season as the only goalkeeper for Portsmouth. However, the club were relegated to League One after losing to Derby County 2–1 on 21 April 2012. At the end of the 2011–12 season, he made twenty–one appearances in all competitions.

Following this, Ashdown was released along with Ricardo Rocha and Benjani after the three being told that they would not be offered new contracts because of the club&#x27;s ongoing financial problems. After being released, he said it was a difficult decision to leave Portsmouth and wished the club every success in the future. Ashdown then supported the bid for the fans to buy back their club, managing to convince 10 other players to pledge their £1000 and paying his towards the fans&#x27; successful bid to take over control of Portsmouth.

====Norwich City (loan)====

Due to the intense competition for the goalkeeper&#x27;s spot at Fratton Park, Ashdown was given the opportunity to go out on loan, Portsmouth deciding that this would help his career, and he joined Norwich City for a one-month loan.

Ashdown played the first game of a loan spell with Norwich City on 21 October 2006 in a 1–0 win against Cardiff City at Carrow Road, replacing Paul Gallacher in the starting XI. However, in a follow–up match against Stoke City, he was sent–off in the 72nd minute for a foul on Luke Chadwick, resulting a penalty and was successfully converted by Danny Higginbotham to score the opposition team&#x27;s third goal of the game, as the club lost 5–0. Despite the criticism, Manager Peter Grant praised Ashdown, saying: &quot;Jamie put both hands up and said it&#x27;s the worst he&#x27;s played in two years in the two games. I knew that because I know what Jamie Ashdown is all about. He has great qualities and he is going to be a massive keeper.&quot; Ashdown made two appearances for Norwich City before returning to his parent club.

===Leeds United===
After a trial at Middlesbrough, Ashdown chose to join Leeds United on 23 July 2012, along with Andy Gray. Upon joining the club, he was allocated the number 12 shirt for the 2012–13 season on 3 August. Having joined alongside former Portsmouth teammates Jason Pearce, David Norris and Luke Varney, Ashdown said he will face competition from newly signed goalkeeper Paddy Kenny for the first-choice goalkeeper position ahead of the 2012–13 season.

Ashdown made his debut for Leeds on 28 August in a League Cup match against Oxford United. He joined the starting line-up for Leeds&#x27; 2–1 victory against Premier League side Everton on 25 September 2012. In November 2012, Portsmouth made a loan bid to sign Ashdown for the second time, but the bid was rejected. He continued in the Cup competitions run until a defeat by Chelsea and Manchester City at the League Cup and FA Cup respectively. At the end of the 2012–13 season, Ashdown made eight appearances in all competitions.

Throughout his time at Leeds United, Ashdown found himself behind pecking order with Paddy Kenny (and eventually Jack Butland) becoming the club&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper. On 16 May 2014, Ashdown was released by Leeds.

===Crawley Town===
After being released by Leeds United, Ashdown joined Crawley Town on a contract until the end of December 2014.

Ashdown made his debut on 16 September 2014, in a 0–0 draw against Doncaster Rovers, keeping a clean sheet. Ashdown managed to beat off competition from Brian Jensen as first-choice goalkeeper. However, he was later criticised for a slow start at the club, despite being man of the match in a 1–1 draw against Crewe on 1 November 2014. In late November he was left out of the squad in favour of Lewis Price.

After nine appearances for Crawley Town, it announced that Ashdown had left the club by mutual agreement.

===Oxford United===
On 3 February 2015, Ashdown signed for Oxford United until the end of the season.

He made his first-team debut, keeping a clean sheet, in a League Two match at AFC Wimbledon on 11 April 2015 that finished 0–0. Ashdown was featured in the last four remaining matches, including keeping three clean sheets for the club. At the end of the 2014–15 season, he made five appearances in all competitions. Following this, Ashdown was offered a new contract by Oxford United. However, the club withdrew the offer to him and was released after they signed Sam Slocombe instead. Following this, he announced his retirement from professional football.

==Post–playing career==
A year later after announcing his retirement, Ashdown revealed that he went on a trial at his former club, Portsmouth after learning that John Keeley returned as the club&#x27;s goalkeeper coach but was turned away and ignored by manager Paul Cook. In September 2018, Ashdown joined Ascot United as one of their new goalkeeping coaches. During the 2022–23 season, Ashdown made 32 appearances for Ascot in all competitions as the club won the Combined Counties League Premier Division North.

==Personal life==
In the summer of 2005, Ashdown married his girlfriend, Zoe. Together, they have three children.

Ashdown endorses goalkeeping gloves made by The One Glove Company, who are donating proceeds to the charity Jack&#x27;s First Steps. The charity partnership first launched on 16 December 2014 with the release of the &quot;Pulse&quot; goalkeeper glove.

In 2013, Ashdown set up an online business, Trusted Pro Supplements, supplying and offering information to athletes about nutritional supplements that do not feature on banned substance lists and are believed not to be harmful. In a November 2020 interview with &quot;The News&quot;, Ashdown later revealed that his cafe business, which he opened in October 2019 after its success over four years, was closed down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and he has since worked for his father&#x27;s hardware store business.

<doc id="1241593" wikidata="Q33356" url="?curid=1241593" title="Quảng Nam province">
<text>Quảng Nam () is a coastal province near northernmost part of the South Central Coast region, the Central of Vietnam. It borders Huế to the north, Đà Nẵng to the northeast, Kon Tum to the southwest, Quảng Ngãi to the southeast, Sekong of Laos to the west and the South China Sea to the east.

Quảng Nam is known for being a tourist destination in the Hội An cultural site, alongside an export and manufacturing hub within central Vietnam.

==History==

Human habitation in the province has been continuous for 2,200 years, starting with the Sa Huỳnh culture.

Quảng Nam was once the political and near the geographic centre of Champa and the province was gifted in 1307 in exchange for a marriage to a Vietnamese or Dai Viet princess. For some time both the most powerful city-state and the busiest Cham port (at Hội An) were located in what is now Quảng Nam. Trade in luxury goods from the Central Highlands was the basis of this wealth and power. As a result of warfare with Vietnam, the centre of political power of the Cham shifted south to Vijaya. The trade in luxuries continued for some time under the Nguyễn lords but declined gradually, especially under the Nguyễn dynasty and further in colonial Vietnam, when the economic focus shifted to the agriculture of the large river deltas.

As the site contained several mountain passes, it has historically been a center for conflict between ruling powers and dynastic struggles. The site was the scene of heavy inter-dynastic fighting between the Trịnh–Nguyễn War and the point in which the Nguyen dynasty had escaped following their expulsion from their strongholds in the north. Its primary city of Hội An was destroyed and rebuilt during the Tay Son rebellion.

The province of Quang Nam has historically served as a trade site and was a major port region in Southeast Asia for trading high-grade silk, fabrics, paper, porcelain, areca nuts, pepper, Chinese medicines, elephant tusks, beeswax, mother-of-pearl and lacquer. The Dutch brought Vietnamese slaves they captured from Nguyễn lord territories in Quảng Nam province to their colony in Taiwan.

As a trade hub, Quang Nam would also serve as the site where Western influence would enter into Vietnam. Notably Alexandre de Rhodes who had written the alphabet, and also where a military alliance with France was signed between Nguyen dynasty monarchs fleeing the Tay Son Rebellion. The region would also see the start of French colonization during Cochinchina campaign and the Siege of Tourane.

The province was split into two in 1962, with the southern half known as Quảng Tín province. The province was also the site of heavy fighting during the Vietnam War, until it was captured in the Hue–Da Nang Campaign. The two provinces were merged again after unification in 1976. In 1997 its former capital city of Da Nang was separated into its own administrative entity.

==Geography==
Quảng Nam comprises flat land along the coast and increasingly high elevations towards the west, with the highest elevations along the border to Laos and Kon Tum province. The highest peak is Ngọc Linh mountain at 2598m. In contrast to the other provinces of the South Central Coast there are no hills or mountains near the coast (with the exception of the Chàm Islands with a peak of 517m).

More than half of Quảng Nam&#x27;s area is covered by forests, making it one of the most forested provinces in Vietnam. Forests dominate in the west of the province and along the border to Quảng Ngãi province. 111,900ha of land are used for agriculture, mostly in the east of the province.

The Thu Bồn River system covers most of the province (except for the south-east), making it one of the largest river systems in central Vietnam. It led to the rise of an ancient Cham city state that was once Champa&#x27;s most influential city and also included one of its most important commercial ports at Hội An.

==Administrative divisions==
Quảng Nam subdivided into 18 district-level sub-divisions:

*15 districts:
**Bắc Trà My
**Duy Xuyên
**Đại Lộc
**Điện Bàn
**Đông Giang
**Hiệp Đức
**Nam Giang
**Nam Trà My
**Núi Thành
**Phú Ninh
**Phước Sơn
**Quế Sơn
**Tây Giang
**Thăng Bình
**Tiên Phước
**Nông Sơn
*1 district-level town:
**Điện Bàn (newly created)
*2 provincial cities:
**Hội An (a UNESCO World Heritage Site)
**Tam Kỳ (capital)

They are further subdivided into 13 commune-level towns (or townlets), 213 communes, and 18 wards.

==Economy==
Quảng Nam has two famous traditional products: the world&#x27;s highest essential oil content Trà My cinnamon (aka Saigon Cinnamon) and Ngọc Linh ginseng. Quảng Nam is famous for its production of Saigon cinnamon.

The economy of Quảng Nam has been growing rapidly in recent years. GDP growth in 2010 was 12.7% and the goal for 2011 is 13.5%. Growth has been between 12 and 15% in the years from 2005 to 2007, mostly driven by a booming industrial sector (growing more than 20% per year) and to a lesser extent the service sector. GDP per capita in 2007 was 8.76 million Vietnamese đồng, 65.2% of the national average.

Quảng Nam&#x27;s economy has been diversified significantly during the first decade of the 21st century. Agriculture, forestry, and fishery made up 41.5% of the province&#x27;s GDP in 2000 but only 21.4% in 2010. This is only a relative decline. Growth of the first sector has been positive but overshadowed by industrial and service growth. It was between 2 and 4% between 2000 and 2007 and 4.5% in 2010. The vast majority of the work force is still employed in this sector: 524,700 out of 778,300 as of 2007 (down from 548,700 in 2000). Harvests of rice, which takes up 75% of the agricultural area, has increased from 329,900 tons in 2000 to 395,100 tons in 2007 (1.1% of the national rice output).
The cultivation of industrial crops has experienced a significant transformation. The production of some crops has declined significantly: sugar cane from 170,400t in 2000 to 46,500t in 2007, tobacco from 2200t to 900t, tea from 1935t to 821t, and coconut from 8741t to 3675t, while the output of other crops has been increased: peanuts from 10,700t to 16,900t, rubber from 0t to 186t, pepper from 22t to 205t, and cashew nuts from 362t to 2345t. Given the recent significant expansion of rubber plantations, this crop is likely to grow further. So far, only peanut cultivation is significant in a national context, making up 3.35% of national output, while the other non-cereal crops contribute less than 1%.

Industrial GDP has been the main driving force of Quảng Nam&#x27;s economy in the first decade of the century. In 2010 it contributed 40.1% to the provincial GDP, up from just 25.3% in 2000 and employed 99,600 workers in 2007, compared to 51,600 in 2000. Industrial GDP has increased 2.48 times between 2000 and 2007 and continues to grow at around 20%.
Chu Lai Economic Zone is located in the south of the province along National Road 1 and is the site of many of the province&#x27;s factories. A smaller industrial zone is located in Tam Kỳ with factories producing electrical equipment, garments, and processed wood.
Major industrial export products include leather shoes (US$51.26 million in 2007), garments (US$31.33 million), wooden products (US$8.587 million), and paper materials (US$2.136 million). Industrial products more oriented towards the domestic market include fish sauce (3.69 million liters), bricks (253 million pieces), fabric (52.5 million meters), and hand farming tools (2 million pieces).

Quang Nam has the biggest gas warehouse in the central area: Total Gas &amp; Power Co. Ltd&#x27;s Ky Ha gas warehouse.

==Transportation==
National Route 1 runs through the east of the province. Both Tam Kỳ and Chu Lai Economic Zone are located along this road, while Hội An is around 10 km east of it. National Road 14 runs from Huế through the west of Quảng Nam to Đắk Glei district in Kon Tum province in the Central Highlands. It is connected to National Road 1A by 14B in north and 14E in central Quảng Nam and the border to Laos through 14D.
57.7% of the roads in (national, provincial, or district) are paved with asphalt, which is somewhat above the median value of provinces in Vietnam. The value is much higher and significantly better than the median for provincially managed roads: 87.68%. Only 29% of respondents to a survey of businesses in 2009 stated that road quality is good or very good (slightly above the median).
Vietnam&#x27;s North–South railway runs through the provinces. Some, but not all, trains stop at Tam Kỳ railway station serving the provincial capital Tam Kỳ.

Da Nang International Airport is located in Da Nang just north of Quảng Nam. Another airport, Chu Lai Airport is located in Núi Thành district in the south of the province near Quảng Ngãi province, serving Chu Lai Economic Zone.

== Places of interest ==
The province has two UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the ancient town of Hội An and the Mỹ Sơn temple complex. It also lies on the World Heritage Road which connects different World Heritage Sites in Central Vietnam.

Another popular tourist site is Cu Lao Cham (Cham Islands).

<text>The Chubut steamer duck or white-headed flightless steamer duck (Tachyeres leucocephalus) is a flightless duck endemic to Argentina.

It is the most recently recognized species of steamer duck, being described only in 1981. This is because it is only found along a rather small and sparsely populated stretch of coast around the Golfo San Jorge in southern Chubut and northern Santa Cruz Provinces, and because steamer ducks in general look fairly similar in plumage.

== Description ==
Adult male Chubut steamer ducks have white heads with a bright yellow/orange bill with a black nail Their webs and feet are yellow/orange with black claws. The rest of their plumage includes mostly grey bodies and white bellies. While the male is molting his bill turns to a duller yellow/orange.

Adult female Chubut steamer ducks have brown heads and necks with small white line going from the back of the eye to the fore-neck. Their bills have a greenish/yellow color.

The Adult female Chubut steamer duck looks very similar to the juvenile.

== Range ==
The Chubut steamer duck was originally thought to only be found strictly in the southern coast of the Chubut province in Argentina. However it is now known to have a larger range from the southern portion of the San Matías Gulf to Islote Chato. The crucial populations for this species are found in Bahía San Gregorio (Argentina) [1], Bahía Melo [2], and Caleta Malaspina[3]. These three crucial populations are all located in the San Jorge Gulf.

== Diet ==
The Chubut steamer duck&#x27;s diet consists of molluscs and crustaceans which it gets through diving, upending and dabbling like most other ducks. They also are known to look on land for food, but stay close to the coast.

== Breeding ==
The breeding season goes from October to February with nests made out of grass, sticks and litter from the high tide. Their nests, typically containing 5-6 eggs, can be found densely clumped together or alone.

This species breeds on 500 km of coastline from the Chubut River mouth to the Chubut and Santa Cruz province boundary. There are an estimated 3,700 breeding pairs of the duck species. In a study of 292 km of continental coastline and 59 km of island coastline from 2004 to 2006 (three breeding seasons) 170 nests were found and out of those found nests 169 were found to be on islands/islets and only one on continental coastline. All of the nests were found in bays or inlets with shallow water protected from strong winds or large waves. The calmer waters allow better conditions for foraging for food and are easier for the chicks to navigate. Chubut steamer ducks are ground nesting birds and prefer nesting areas with at least 1 meter squared of shrub cover. Ground nesting on islands make it easier to protect their young from aerial predators (shrub cover) and from terrestrial predators who can not swim out to the island.

== Threats ==
Chubut steamer Ducks face many threats such as oil exploration, habitat destruction, predation, and invasive species. Other forms of threats they face are from guano, macroalgae and egg harvesting. There have been three major oil spills in the past 30 years that affected the ducks breeding areas by directly being coated with oil and polluting the substrate that the ducks make their nests on. The three main invasive species affecting the Chubut steamer ducks are Carcinus maenas (Green Crab), Wakame (Asian Kelp or &quot;Undaria pinnatifida&quot;) and Balanus glandula (Acorn Barnacle). These invasive species indirectly affect the duck by altering the environment that it lives in.

Sub-marine predators of this species include the South American sea lion &quot;(Otaria byronia)&quot; and Killer whale (&quot;Orcinus orca)&quot;.

The two species that are commonly observed preying on Chubut Steamer duck eggs are the Kelp gull (&quot;Larus dominicanus&quot;) and Crested caracara (&quot;Caracara plancus).&quot; Egg harvesting has only been reported in low numbers and is not as large of a threat as others mentioned.

== Escape methods ==
Due to the Chubut Steamer ducks being flightless, they need to have different methods of escaping predators besides flying. To do this they can swim, dive or steam. Steaming is a faster unique way to swim for these flightless birds. When they steam they use their wings as oars and their feet to generate turbulence. They can obtain speeds up to 24 km/h when steaming.

== Outlook ==
When the species was first discovered in 1988, even though there was only one population, they were listed as lower risk/least concern due to believing the population was not declining. Over the years the population changed to lower risk/near threatened in 1994, to near threatened in 2004 and finally to vulnerable in 2012 with a decreasing current population trend. The total population is estimated to have 5,300-5,600 individuals with 3,400-3,700 being mature.

Around half of their population (46%) is protected by the Interjurisdictional Marine Park in the San Jorge Gulf. The UNESCO Biosphere Reserve also has included the breeding range of the Chubut steamer duck in its program.

Programs to keep oil tankers and other large ships that may cause harm to the Chubut steamer duck out of the ducks range along with programs to minimize human disturbance and coastal development of breeding grounds have been proposed.

<doc id="1241597" wikidata="Q705387" url="?curid=1241597" title="Enigma (2001 film)">
<text>Enigma is a 2001 espionage thriller film directed by Michael Apted from a screenplay by Tom Stoppard. The script was adapted from the 1995 novel &quot;Enigma&quot; by Robert Harris, about the Enigma codebreakers of Bletchley Park in the Second World War.

Although the story is highly fictionalised, the process of encrypting German messages during World War II and decrypting them with the Enigma is discussed in detail, and the historical event of the Katyn massacre is highlighted. It was the last film scored by John Barry. Mick Jagger appears in the background as an RAF officer between 36:32 and 36:34.

==Plot==
The story, loosely based on actual events, takes place in March 1943, when the Second World War was at its height. The cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, have a problem: the Nazi U-boats have changed one of their code reference books used for Enigma machine ciphers, leading to a blackout in the flow of vital naval signals intelligence. The British cryptanalysts have cracked the &quot;Shark&quot; cipher once before, and they need to do it again to keep track of U-boat locations.

The film begins with Tom Jericho returning to Bletchley after a month of recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by his failed love affair with a coworker named Claire Romilly. Jericho immediately seeks to see her again and finds that she mysteriously disappeared a few days earlier. He enlists the help of Claire&#x27;s housemate, Hester Wallace, to follow the trail of clues and learn what has happened to Claire.

Mr. Jericho and Miss Wallace, as they formally address each other, work to decipher intercepts stolen by Claire and determine why she took them. Jericho is closely watched by an MI5 agent, Wigram, who plays cat and mouse with him throughout the film. Meanwhile, U-boats are closing in on a convoy of thirty-seven ships from America, giving the code-breakers less than four days to find a solution to reading the changed Shark cipher.

But someone else at Bletchley has a personal interest in the stolen intercepts and may be responsible for Claire&#x27;s disappearance.

==Cast==
==Production and premiere==

The film was shot on location in England, Scotland, and the Netherlands, with Bletchley Park mansion substituted by Chicheley Hall. Other locations include the Great Central Railway, Loughborough and Tigh Beg Croft, near Oban, Scotland. Interiors were filmed at Elstree Film Studios.

The film was produced by Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones. Jagger makes a cameo appearance as an RAF officer at a dance. He also lent the film&#x27;s design department a four-rotor Enigma encoding machine he owned to ensure the historical accuracy of one of the props. The festivities around the London premiere of the film are shown in the 2001 documentary &quot;Being Mick&quot;.

==Reception==

Critical reviews were largely positive, but there was criticism of the largely fictional storyline, which neither mentions the real codebreaker, Alan Turing, nor gives due credit to the Polish cryptanalysis foundation, the Biuro Szyfrów (Cipher Bureau). The film holds a &#x27;fresh&#x27; 72% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus reading, &quot;The well-crafted, twist-filled &quot;Enigma&quot; is a thinking person&#x27;s spy thriller.&quot; Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; compared the film to works by Alfred Hitchcock, and remarked that, &#x27;Overall, &quot;Enigma&quot; plays fair and square while generating suspense with its twisty plot. And while it requires a generous suspension of disbelief to accept a few action-hero gestures by the deeply troubled Jericho, Scott is persuasive and compelling enough as his complex character to drive the narrative.&#x27;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars and said, &#x27;What I like about the movie is its combination of suspense and intelligence. If it does not quite explain exactly how decryption works (how could it?), it at least gives us a good idea of how decrypters work, and we understand how crucial Bletchley was—so crucial its existence was kept a secret for 30 years.&#x27; On the other end, Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was far less impressed, saying, &#x27;The legend of how the British cracked the almighty Enigma must have sounded, on paper, like a nifty mathematical thriller—a historic WarGames set at the formative moment of the computer age. On-screen, however, Enigma plays as if the scriptwriter, Tom Stoppard, and the director, Michael Apted, were themselves cryptographers; they seem to be making hunt-and-peck stabs at how to translate a tale of arcane numeric formulas into drama.&#x27;

The film grossed $6.6 million in the United Kingdom. It grossed $4.3 million in the United States and Canada and $4.8 million in other markets for a worldwide total of $15.7 million.

==Historical accuracy==
The film and, by association, the book have attracted criticism for their portrayal of the Polish role in Enigma decryption. The historian Norman Davies argues that in the film the fictitious traitor turns out to be Polish, but only slight mention is made of the contributions of prewar Polish Cipher Bureau cryptologists to Allied Enigma decryption efforts, but historically, the only known traitor active at Bletchley Park was British spy John Cairncross, who passed crucial secrets to the Soviet Union.

The film hints that Dougray Scott&#x27;s character, the brilliant Cambridge mathematician Thomas Jericho is the main code-breaker at Bletchley, equating him with Alan Turing, the original creator of the British Bombe, with the words of Mr Wigram, played by Jeremy Northam:
&quot;But what if someone tells them just how we do it? Your thinking machine, clackity-clack, day and night, programmed with a menu, thanks to your big brain, that reduces the odds to just a few million-to-one until it locks on to the winning combination. There goes the war…”
Of course, Jericho is a totally fictional character, given that Turing was homosexual; his brief engagement to Joan Clarke, who knew about his sexual orientation, was purely platonic. In reality, it was unlikely that Turing was involved in code-breaking the Naval four-rotor Enigma Shark in 1943. Notes by Tony Sale do not mention Turing as the &quot;someone in Bletchley Park [who] realised that Short Weather Signals were sent in the three wheel mode&quot; and explained &quot;the Central Met. Station had collated the U-Boat and other reports, [and] they broadcast a general synoptic in their own Met. Code&quot;, which used the standard International Met. Code further encoded using bigram tables, as discovered by Mr Archer from the Met. section of Bletchley Park. According to Hugh Alexander, from June 1943 Joan Clarke, Mahon, Pendered and Noskwith were responsible for the whole of the cryptographic work until the end of the war. Strangely, Joan Clarke is not present in the film as none of the team of cryptanalysts are female.

In the film, Cave, from Naval Intelligence, played by Matthew Macfadyen, mentioned Fasson and Grazier gave their lives to rescue the code books from a sinking submarine. There were actually three men who retrieved the books: First Lieutenant Anthony Fasson, Able Seaman Colin Grazier and 16-year-old Tommy Brown from the canteen. Fasson and Grazier did drown while attempting to retrieve electrical equipment from a U-boat U-559 (which Cave describes as its four-rotor enigma) on 30 October 1942, while Brown survived only to die in a house fire during shore-leave before the end of the war. Fasson and Grazier were awarded the George Cross posthumously and Brown was awarded the George Medal. Fictional character Cave states he was completing his last posting on a destroyer, in November &#x27;42, when the books were acquired.

There are historical records of the break in the ability of the British to decode the Naval enigma from 10 to 19 March 1943 when the third edition of the weather short signal codebook was deployed.

The Katyn massacre, revealed after the discovery of mass graves of 4,500 Polish officers as depicted in the film, is a historical atrocity committed by Stalinist Russia in 1940. There is no evidence that details of the mass graves were intercepted by British intelligence, although it is possible. The first announcement of the discovery was broadcast by Radio Berlin on 13 April 1943.

<text>Edward Packard (born February 16, 1931) is an American author, creator of the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; book concept and author of over 50 books in the series. The genre that Packard invented, in which the reader chooses what happens, has come to be called &quot;interactive fiction&quot;. Packard wrote many other children&#x27;s books as well, and is also a lawyer, essayist, and poet. He continues to write books, and blogs regularly on his website, edwardpackard.com. Born in Huntington, New York, he is a graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School. 

Packard conceived the original idea of writing interactive second-person fiction — in which the reader is the protagonist (&quot;&quot;you&quot; are the hero&quot;) and makes choices that affect how the story unfolds — while he was thinking up bedtime stories for his children. (While telling them a story, making it up as he went along, he would enlist their help by pausing to ask them, &quot;What do you think happened next?&quot;, and they would each have different ideas about how they wanted the story to proceed.) After he published the first three books in this format, originally called &quot;The Adventures of You&quot;, Bantam Books offered him and his first publisher a contract for a series, rebranded and made famous as the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series of children&#x27;s books.

Packard is the grandfather of actor David Corenswet.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Packard wrote the first known book of this type, &quot;Sugarcane Island&quot;, in 1969, and arranged for it to be published in 1976 by Vermont Crossroads Press, owned by Constance Cappel and Raymond A. Montgomery, Jr. Packard explains in the foreword to the book that he developed what he originally called &quot;the adventures of you&quot; fiction format while trying to think up interesting bedtime stories for his three children (Caroline, Andrea, and Wells). In &quot;Sugarcane Island&quot;, the shipwrecked reader travels around the titular island, making a choice about how to proceed on almost every page (for example, if a reader chooses to walk along the sandy beach, they are told to turn to page 3; if they choose to climb up the rocky hill, they must turn instead to page 5). The possible stories to choose from branch out like a tree within the book; the story that the reader follows unfolds differently depending on the choices they make. Readers confront different dangers or treasures at every turn, depending on their choices. Many of the possible endings feature an unfortunate demise, although escape from the island is possible if the correct choices are made.

===&quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;===
&quot;The Adventures of You on Sugarcane Island,&quot; and Packard&#x27;s next two books in the genre, &quot;Deadwood City&quot; and &quot;The Third Planet From Altair&quot; (published in 1977 and 1978 by Lippincott), were the exact prototypes for the books in Bantam&#x27;s classic &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series, in which Packard participated as one of the main authors. 

In 1969 and 1970, the William Morris Agency had submitted the book on Packard&#x27;s behalf to several major publishers, all of whom had rejected it. But in 1976, Packard was able to get the book published by Vermont Crossroads Press. In its review of the book, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called it &quot;an original idea, well carried out.&quot;

When Lippincott published Packard&#x27;s next two books in the same genre, &quot;Deadwood City&quot; and &quot;The Third Planet from Altair&quot;, their covers alerted readers to their unusual nature with the rubrics &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure in the Wild West&quot; and &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure in Outer Space&quot;. Because at the time the format was so unusual, readers were warned at the outset not to read the book straight through, but to follow the pages corresponding to their choices. 

Seeing potential in Packard&#x27;s idea of an &quot;interactive book&quot;, Bantam Books launched a series called &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; in 1979. This contact with Bantam Books was made by Constance Cappel on a flight to the Atlanta ABA Conference with Bantam’s then head of marketing, Jack Romano. (Vermont Crossroads Press, having earlier sold the rights to the series to Pocket Books, now had them transferred to Bantam.) Packard wrote the first book in the Bantam series, &quot;The Cave of Time&quot;, a time-traveling story in which the reader explores a cavern that is a portal to different eras. Both R. A. Montgomery, Packard’s original publisher at Vermont Crossroads Press, and Packard wrote many more books in the series, with Packard contributing well over 60 titles by 1998, when the series ended.

Packard kept the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series fresh by changing genres with each title. After the time-travel story, he wrote a spy story, a space opera, a western, a mystery, a science fiction story, and a fantasy. In one of his books, &quot;Hyperspace&quot;, Packard himself appears as a character (a case of &quot;self-insertion&quot;).

Packard was the only CYOA author who included a recurring character in many of his books: a scientist, Dr. Nera Vivaldi, frequently appeared in the role of a friend to the reader. Seemingly ageless, she appears in stories set in many different time periods, including those that take the reader into outer space. In &quot;Hyperspace&quot;, Dr. Vivaldi breaches the fourth wall by acknowledging that she is a fictional character whom the reader may recognize from having read other CYOA books.

Beginning in 2012, Simon &amp; Schuster released revised and expanded print versions of selected Packard CYOA stories: &quot;Through the Black Hole&quot;, &quot;Return to the Cave of Time&quot; and &quot;The Forbidden Castle&quot;, under the trademark &quot;U-Ventures&quot;.

The six books in the &quot;Space Hawks&quot; series, which focuses on Earth&#x27;s defense against space aliens, were published in mainland China in 2004 in anticipation of China&#x27;s first crewed space mission.

===Book applications===
In 2010, Packard started a new company called U-Ventures, which began releasing Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-style applications for iPhone and iPad based on some of Packard&#x27;s books. 
The first title, &quot;Return to the Cave of Time&quot;, was released in August with more titles planned shortly after.

<doc id="1241603" wikidata="Q287092" url="?curid=1241603" title="Falkland steamer duck">
<text>The Falkland steamer duck (Tachyeres brachypterus) is a species of flightless duck found on the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean. The steamer ducks get their name from their unconventional swimming behaviour in which they flap their wings and feet on the water in a motion reminiscent of an old paddle steamer. The Falkland steamer duck is one of only two bird species endemic to the Falkland Islands, the other being Cobb&#x27;s wren.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The Falkland steamer duck is part of the order Anseriformes and the family Anatidae, alongside ducks, geese, and swans. It is in the genus &quot;Tachyeres&quot; with the three other species of steamer ducks, all found in South America. The Falkland steamer duck is most closely related to the flying steamer duck, which can also be found in and around the Falkland Islands. It is believed that they might still be able to interbreed. A study from 2012 established that these two species are genetically indistinguishable. However, they tend to reproduce in different geographic areas. Possible hybridization could account for the genetic similarities between the two species. Some scientists have proposed that the flying steamer duck and the Falkland steamer duck should be a single species, but more evidence is needed to settle that question.

== Evolution of flightlessness ==
Steamer ducks are a young group from an evolutionarily point of view and have a last common ancestor believed to have lived about 2 million years ago. This family is of particular interest to scientists because it contains both species capable and incapable of flight. Scientists believe that they are witnessing the evolution of flightlessness. In fact, both the Falkland steamer duck and the closely related flying steamer duck contain genetic sequences associated with both flight-capable wings and flightless wings. This would suggest that the Falkland steamer ducks have just recently become flightless. However, it is difficult to determine if these specific wing traits have directly evolved because of flightlessness or to support steaming behaviour because these two characteristics appear to have evolved at the same time. Regardless of these unknowns, the fact that this species has recently become flightless allows scientists to identify specific genes and reconstruct the evolutionary steps necessary to evolve flightlessness with a level of detail that cannot be matched when working with fossils. In short, the Falkland steamer duck is a promising model organism to study and understand the process behind the evolution of flightlessness in birds.

==Description==
The Falkland steamer duck measures between 61 and 74 cm in length and has a wingspan of 84 to 94 cm. It is a fairly large species of duck with males weighing between 3300 and 4800 g, and females between 2900 and 4196 g. The male&#x27;s plumage is brown to grey with a contrasting light grey-white head. They have a distinctive orange bill. The wings have white secondary feathers and large, featherless spurs. The stubby tail is brown-grey. The eyes are brown with a contrasting white eye-ring and a faint white eye-streak. The females are darker in colour with a brown neck and head and an olive green beak. Females also have a distinctive white eye ring and a white line behind their eyes. Both males and females have characteristic yellow-orange feet. Juveniles can be differentiated from females by the black marks and overall paler colour of their feet. They also lack or have a very reduced white line behind their eyes.

This species is visually similar to another steamer duck species with which it shares its range: the flying steamer duck. Although they are difficult to tell apart in the field, the Falkland steamer duck has shorter wings and tail and a thicker neck and bill. Finally, as its name implies, the flying steamer duck is capable of flight while the Falkland steamer duck is strictly flightless. This last characteristic is difficult to see in the field because the flying steamer duck seldom flies and is often seen walking or swimming.

==Historical description==
Charles Darwin devoted two paragraphs to this bird (or the similar flying steamer duck) in &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;, having observed them at the Falkland Islands in 1833:

== Habitat and distribution ==

The species&#x27; distribution is limited to the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean. These ducks are year-round residents of the islands and the surrounding archipelago, and can be found mainly on rugged shores and in sheltered bays. Falkland steamer ducks also venture inland to freshwater ponds up to 400 m from the coast.

== Behavior ==
This species spends most of its time in small family groups composed of the female, the male and the chicks. However, non-breeding adults and juveniles might gather in larger groups of up to 300. These gatherings can happen at any time of the year and their purpose remains unknown.

=== Vocalization ===
The Falkland steamer duck&#x27;s vocalizations are similar to those of the flying steamer duck. Males can be heard year-round, but they are especially vocal during the breeding season, during which they use their vocalization to defend their territory. Their call consists of loud rasping whistles and repeated sharp ticking notes. Females usually sing with the males and produce deeper grunts. This bird is loud and can easily be heard on and around the shores of the Falklands.

=== Diet ===
The Falkland steamer duck feeds mainly on marine mollusks and, occasionally, on crustaceans. Although they can upend when feeding in shallower waters, they mainly dive to find their preys on the sea floor. They used their small wings and large feet to effectively propel themselves in the water. Interestingly, they have been observed to feed collectively with many individuals diving at the same time.

=== Reproduction ===
The breeding season lasts from mid September to the end of December, but breeding can take place year-round. Adults breed in single pairs on and around the coastline. Males become very territorial and fights are common. Males and sometimes females will use the spurs on their wings to strike challengers. These fights are known for their violence and can result in severe injury or even death. Once mating has occurred, females lay between 4 and 12 eggs in down-lined nests and incubate them for about 34 days. The males stay with the female to defend the nest but are not involved in the incubation process. Every day, the female carefully covers the eggs with plant material before leaving the nest for 15 to 30 minutes to bathe and preen. The nest is usually located in tall grass, piles of sea weed, rocks, and even in unoccupied Magellanic penguin burrows. Chicks weigh about 83 g upon hatching and stay with the adults for 12 weeks. When they hatch and for the first 12 weeks, the chicks are covered in brown and white down. They have distinctive white markings on the side of their head. Around the 12-week mark, chicks get their first plumage. Sexual maturity is reached after 14 to 24 months. Adults can live for up to 20 years old in captivity but there is no information on the longevity of wild individuals.

=== Predation ===
The adult Falkland steamer duck does not have many predators. Predation by sea lions and seals is rare but has been documented. The main predation pressure is on fledglings, which are routinely picked up by kelp gulls and skuas. Egg harvesting used to be common in the islands, but humans have since abandoned the practice.

== Conservation status ==
The species is currently classified as Least Concern. During surveys between 1983 and 1993, between 9000 and 16,000 breeding pairs were recorded and the population was estimated at 27,000 to 48,000 individuals. A survey from 1997 estimated the population at 32,000 individuals. A recent study has shed some light on the negative effect of invasive species on shore bird populations in the Falklands: rat-invested islands have lower numbers of many birds, including steamer ducks. Another possible source of concern comes from oil spills. The species has a limited distribution, and its food supply could be severely affected by a large-scale release of oil in and around the Falklands. Although these anticipated threats should be considered, the population is currently stable and there is no immediate source of concern for this species.

<text>Down to the Sea in Ships is a 1922 American silent romantic drama film about a 19th-century Massachusetts whaling family. Directed by Elmer Clifton, the film stars William Walcott, Marguerite Courtot, and Clara Bow. The film&#x27;s title comes from Psalm 107, verses 23–24.
==Plot==
Captain Charles W. Morgan is a well-respected businessman who owns a fleet of whaling ships in the Quaker town of New Bedford, Massachusetts. He is very close to his shy, obedient daughter, Patience, and tells her that she must marry a man who is a whaler and a Quaker, like him. His son and daughter-in-law were lost ten years before while on a whaling expedition; eventually, their baby, his granddaughter Dot, was found &quot;in a chest on a raft bundled in sail cloth.&quot; He has raised her ever since. Dot is a mischievous, rebellious child, who wants to be a whaler when she grows up, an ambition that is not acceptable for a female among her people.

One day, Allan Dexter, a childhood friend of Patience&#x27;s, arrives in town, recently back from college. He and Patience renew their acquaintance and fall in love. He asks Captain Morgan for permission to marry Patience, but Morgan turns him out of the house, informing him that he is not a suitable husband for her because he is neither a Quaker nor a whaler.

Meanwhile, Samuel Siggs, an effeminate Chinese man masquerading as a white man, connives to steal Captain Morgan&#x27;s ships to transport African gold. He dresses up as a Quaker and acquires a position of authority in Morgan&#x27;s business by pretending to be an experienced whaler. After spying Morgan&#x27;s pretty daughter Patience, he also plans to finagle his way into marrying her. Learning of Dexter&#x27;s love for her, he has his fellow con artist Jake Finner, &quot;fearless, lawless and godless&quot;, drug the young man&#x27;s drink and has him kidnapped, tied up, and placed on the next outgoing whaling vessel, hoping never to see him again. Also on the ship is Dot, who has dressed as a boy and stowed away below deck. Because of their disappearance, it is rumored that Dexter and Dot have joined the Oregon Wagon Train and gone west together.

Miles out to sea, Dexter is untied and immediately put to work. Wanting to prove himself to Morgan, he decides to put all his effort into working long hard hours to win his chance to harpoon a whale, which would make him an accomplished whalesman. Meanwhile, Jake Finner, who has killed the captain and taken over the ship, finds Dot, discovers she is a girl, and attacks her. Because he has been treating the men on board like slaves, they mutiny against Finner, appointing Dexter as captain, while Dot&#x27;s friend Jimmie, the cabin boy, rescues her from Finner&#x27;s clutches.

After harpooning a whale and learning why he was shanghaied, Dexter arranges to have the vessel return to port. Meanwhile, Captain Morgan has fallen ill, fears that he is dying, and commands Patience to marry Siggs as his last wish. She reluctantly agrees. Dexter arrives just in time to save Patience, and the lovers are reunited at the end.

==Cast==
==Production==

The film contains semi-documentary footage of whalers at work, and was shot on historic locations in Massachusetts, New England, most notably in New Bedford, and at the Apponegansett Meeting House and Elihu Akin House in Dartmouth. The film&#x27;s title cards are notable for having quotes from Herman Melville&#x27;s Moby-Dick and Alexander Starbuck&#x27;s &quot;History of the American Whale Fishery&quot;.

The authenticity of the whaling scenes are noted in the opening screen credits, which praise the bravery of both A.G. Penrod and Paul H. Allen, the cameramen, &quot;who, in small boats, stood by their cameras at the risk of their lives to photograph the fighting whales.&quot;

The &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; was one of the whaling ships used in the film.

==Reception==
The film&#x27;s premiere was September 25, 1922 at the Olympia Theater in New Bedford, Massachusetts and was in general distribution from March 4, 1923.

It was very popular with audiences, playing for 22 weeks straight in New York City. Critics gave it low marks, but several went out of their way to praise Bow&#x27;s performance.

==Remake==
The film&#x27;s title was used for, but was not related to, a film by Twentieth Century Fox in 1948 and released in 1949. The 1949 version was directed by Henry Hathaway, starring Richard Widmark, Lionel Barrymore and Dean Stockwell.

<doc id="1241611" wikidata="Q3497869" url="?curid=1241611" title="William J. H. Boetcker">
<text>William John Henry Boetcker (1873–1962) was an American religious leader and influential public speaker. Born in Hamburg, Germany, he was ordained a Presbyterian minister soon after his arrival in the United States as a young adult. Boetcker was ordained in Brooklyn, New York. He quickly gained attention as an outspoken opponent of organized labor and was instrumental in the founding of the Citizens Industrial Association, later making a professional career of public speaking, and is sometimes considered the forerunner of such contemporary &quot;success coaches&quot; as Anthony Robbins. He is widely credited with coining the phrase, &quot;A man is judged by the company he keeps, and a company is judged by the men it keeps, and the people of Democratic nations are judged by the type and caliber of officers they elect.”

==The Ten Cannots==
An outspoken political conservative, Rev. Boetcker is perhaps best remembered for his authorship of a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Ten Cannots&quot;, originally published in 1916, that emphasizes freedom and responsibility of the individual on himself. It is often misattributed to Abraham Lincoln. The error apparently stems from a leaflet printed in 1942 by a conservative political organization called the Committee for Constitutional Government. The leaflet bore the title &quot;Lincoln on Limitations&quot; and contained some genuine Lincoln quotations on one side and the &quot;Ten Cannots&quot; on the other, with the attributions switched. The mistake of crediting Lincoln for &quot;The Ten Cannots&quot; has been repeated, notably by Ronald Reagan in his address to the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, and by John Kasich on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; in 2015.

There are several minor variants of the pamphlet in circulation, but the most commonly accepted version appears below:

*&quot;You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.&quot;
*&quot;You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.&quot;
*&quot;You cannot help little men by tearing down big men.&quot;
*&quot;You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer.&quot;
*&quot;You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich.&quot;
*&quot;You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money.&quot;
*&quot;You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred.&quot;
*&quot;You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn.&quot;
*&quot;You cannot build character and courage by destroying men&#x27;s initiative and independence.&quot;
*&quot;And you cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they can and should do for themselves.&quot;

Boetcker also spoke of the &quot;Seven National Crimes&quot;:

*I don&#x27;t think.
*I don&#x27;t know.
*I don&#x27;t care.
*I am too busy.
*I leave well enough alone.
*I have no time to read and find out.
*I am not interested.

<doc id="1241614" wikidata="Q757686" url="?curid=1241614" title="Atoroidal">
<text>In mathematics, an atoroidal 3-manifold is one that does not contain an essential torus.
There are two major variations in this terminology: an essential torus may be defined geometrically, as an embedded, non-boundary parallel, incompressible torus, or it may be defined algebraically, as a subgroup formula_1 of its fundamental group that is not conjugate to a peripheral subgroup (i.e., the image of the map on fundamental group induced by an inclusion of a boundary component). The terminology is not standardized, and different authors require atoroidal 3-manifolds to satisfy certain additional restrictions. For instance:
* gives a definition of atoroidality that combines both geometric and algebraic aspects, in terms of maps from a torus to the manifold and the induced maps on the fundamental group. He then notes that for irreducible boundary-incompressible 3-manifolds this gives the algebraic definition.
* uses the algebraic definition without additional restrictions.
* uses the geometric definition, restricted to irreducible manifolds.
* requires the algebraic variant of atoroidal manifolds (which he calls simply atoroidal) to avoid being one of three kinds of fiber bundle. He makes the same restriction on geometrically atoroidal manifolds (which he calls topologically atoroidal) and in addition requires them to avoid incompressible boundary-parallel embedded Klein bottles. With these definitions, the two kinds of atoroidality are equivalent except on certain Seifert manifolds.

A 3-manifold that is not atoroidal is called toroidal.

<text>Christopher Edward Clarke (born 18 December 1980) is an English footballer who plays as a defender.

==Career==
Born in Leeds, West Yorkshire, Clarke started his career with the Wolverhampton Wanderers youth system alongside his twin brother Matthew and after being released by the club the pair signed for Third Division outfit Halifax Town in July 1999. He left the club in February 2002 after signing for Second Division side Blackpool on a two-and-a-half-year contract with the option of an additional year for a fee of £120,000 plus a sell-on clause. Clarke made his debut in a 3–0 victory at Cambridge United on 26 February. He scored Blackpool&#x27;s second goal with a header in the 2002 Football League Trophy Final at the Millennium Stadium, which the team went on to win 4–1 against Cambridge. He joined Cambridge of the Third Division on a free transfer after signing a contract until the end of the 2003–04 season on 25 March 2004.

<text>The Anūnatvāpūrṇatvanirdeśaparivarta (AAN, Sanskrit, The Teaching Explaining the Absence of Increase or Decrease), also known as the Sutra of Non-increase and Non-decrease (Chinese: 不增不減經) is a short Mahayana text belonging to the tathāgatagarbha class of Mahayana sutras. The main topic of the sutra is the nature of the Buddhist cosmos (the &quot;realm of sentient beings&quot;, Skt. sattvadhātu) and its relationship with ultimate reality (dharmakāya, tathāgatagarbha, etc).

==History==
The AAN is only extant in the Chinese translation (Ch. Fóshūo bù zēng bù jiǎn jīng, 佛説不増不減經, Taisho no. 16) produced by Bodhiruci (6th century) at Luoyang circa 520 CE. The Tibetan tradition is unaware of this sutra.

The sutra does not survive in Sanskrit in full, however many passages from it survive as quotations in the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;. 

The AAN is also quoted in another independent Indian source, the *&quot;Mahāyānadharmadhātunirviśeṣa&quot; (&quot;Dasheng fajie wuchabie lun&quot; 大乘法界無差別論, T. 1626 and T. 1627). This treatise may have been another work of *Sāramati (the author of the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; according to the Chinese tradition). 

According to Silk, the AAN, while difficult to date, &quot;must be older than the early fifth century&quot; since it &quot;clearly predates the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;&quot;. He also argues that &quot;given its doctrinal standpoint and style of presentation, I believe that it post-dates the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha-sūtra&quot; and &quot;Śrīmālādevī&quot;.&quot;

According to Karl Brunnholzl, this sutra is notable for its doctrinal similarity to the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Sutra.&quot; Other scholars also note a close relationship between the teachings of the &quot;Anūnatvāpurnatvanirdeśa&quot; and other buddha-nature sutras like the &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra&quot; and the &quot;Tathāgatagarbhasūtra&quot;.

Three Chinese commentaries were written on the AAN (by Saichō, Wŏnhyo, and 榮業 (unknown author)), but none of them survive.

An English translation and analysis of the AAN was published by Jonathan Silk in 2015.

==Main teachings==

=== The One Realm (ekadhātu) ===

The first part of the AAN outlines various wrong views (mithyā-dr̥ṣṭi) which prevent sentient beings from obtaining knowledge of the ultimate truth. The second part of the text discusses the ultimate truth, the most important doctrinal element here being the absence of &quot;decrease or increase&quot; in the &quot;realm of sentient beings&quot; (Sanskrit: sattvadhātu, which is defined in the sutra as &quot;the mass of beings, the ocean of beings&quot;). This means that the overall number of living beings never increases nor decrease, despite all the things which happen and despite the fact that some sentient beings attain Buddhahood. 

The &quot;Sutra of Non-increase and Non-decrease&quot; explains that this is because there is only a one realm or domain, a single element of beings, the ekadhātu (Ch: 一界), also termed the *ekadharmadhātu (一法界). This one domain is identical to both Buddhahood (i.e. the nirvāṇa-dhātu) and saṃsāra (the realm of cyclical suffering, i.e. sattvadhātu), both which are non-dual and indivisible. The sutra plays on the different meanings of the term dhātu, which can mean ‘realm’, ‘element,’ ‘quintessence,’ ‘essential core’ and even &#x27;cause&#x27;. According to Silk, in the AAN, the term dhātu has at least a bivalent sense, referring to both a &quot;realm&quot; (i.e. the cosmos) and a &quot;quintessence&quot; (the intrinsic or central constituent of something). 

According to the AAN, neither sentient beings, disciples or solitary Buddhas can know this ultimate reality directly, they can only access it through faith. As the sutra states:This extremely profound purport is exactly the Tathāgatha’s sphere of insight and it is the range of the Tathāgata’s mind. Śāriputra, such a profound purport as this cannot be known by the insight of all the auditors and lone buddhas, cannot be seen, cannot be examined. Still how much less could all foolish common people fathom it. It is indeed only the insight of the buddhas and tathāgatas which can examine, know and see this purport. [Despite] the insight possessed by all auditors and lone buddhas, Śāriputra, with respect to this purport, they can only have faith; they are not able to know, see or examine it in accord with reality. (Silk, 2015, pp. 89-92) 

The sutra goes on to equate this single reality with the ultimate truth (paramārtha-satya), with buddha-nature (tathāgatagarbha), with the Dharmakaya (Dharma body of the Buddha) and with the “originally pure mind” (prakṛtipariśuddhacitta). This is the principal doctrine of the sutra, which states: The extremely profound purport, Śāriputra, is precisely the supreme truth. The supreme truth is precisely the quintessence of beings (衆生界; sattvadhātu). The quintessence of beings is precisely the embryo of the tathāgatas (如來藏; tathāgatagarbha). The embryo of the tathāgatagas is precisely the dharma-body (法身; dharmakāya). (Silk, 2015, p. 65). These teachings are an important source for the fourth vajra topic of the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;, which quotes the &quot;Sutra of Non-increase and Non-decrease&quot;.

=== The wrong views of increase and decrease ===
Furthermore, according to the sutra, thinking that there is increase or decrease in the dhātu (domain, element, realm) of sentient beings (as well as thinking that nirvana is annihilation) is a serious misconception that leads sentient beings to continue to wander in samsara. As Karl Burnnholzl explains:the root of such misconceptions is their lack of understanding the oneness of the nondual dharmadhātu. This dharmadhātu is the sphere and the great nirvāṇa of buddhas, which cannot be perceived even by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, let alone ordinary beings. Still, buddhas, bodhisattvas, and sentient beings are not different in essence since they are nothing but three different states of the dharmakāya in terms of its being more or less unobscured by adventitious stains. The dhātu of sentient beings is ultimate reality and the tathāgata heart, which is also identified as the dharmakāya, fully endowed with the inseparable, innumerable, and inconceivable qualities of a buddha, just as the radiance, color, and shape of a jewel are inseparable. As such, in this sutra, the Buddha states that the ideas of increase or decrease in the number of beings in the cosmos are both ill-conceived. If the number of sentient beings decrease (when someone attains nirvana), then this indicates nirvana is a kind of annihilation that leads to non-existence. Meanwhile, if the number of sentient beings increases, this would mean that beings or nirvana can arise (utpāda) without a cause or can be created. Both of these views are rejected by the sutra. According to the Buddha in this sutra, if one understands the true nature of the one realm, the ultimate reality, then neither of these wrongs views of increase or decrease would arise. 

===Buddha-nature and the buddha-qualities===

According to this sutra, nirvana is not utter vacuity or the cessation of being, but is the realm of the Tathāgatagarbha (i.e. buddha-nature), the unfabricated, utterly pure and everlasting essence of all beings. This ultimate reality (paramartha) is also said to be endowed with the wisdom and qualities of the buddhas. The &quot;Sutra of Non-increase and Non-decrease&quot; states:
As I have expounded, Śāriputra, the meaning of the dharma-body is inseparable from, indivisible from, not cut-off from, not different from the inconceivable qualities definitive of a buddha, greater in number than the sands of the Ganges, [namely,] the merits and insight of a tathāgata. It is like a lamp, Śāriputra, whose brightness, color and tactile sensation are inseparable and indivisible [from the lamp itself]. Again, it is like a maṇi gem whose characteristics of brightness, color and form are inseparable and indivisible [from the gem itself]. (Silk, 2015, pp. 96-98 §11, 12)
This idea is an important source for the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;&#x27;s fifth vajra point, and this text quotes the &quot;Sutra of Non-increase and Non-decrease&quot; on this topic. Thus, the buddha qualities (gunas) and wisdom (jñana) and the buddha-nature - dharmakaya are inseparable. This inseparability is exemplified in the sutra with the examples of a light (aloka) and a precious gem (mani), both of which became influential similes in the Mahayana tradition. In Chinese Buddhism, this doctrine was interpreted in terms of essence-function (ti 體 and yong 用).

According to the &quot;Sutra of Non-increase and Non-decrease,&quot; the buddha-nature - dharmakaya is also the eternal ground or basis of all things or dharmas (phenomena). The dharmakaya is also described by the sutra as &quot;being unborn [anutpada] and unperishing&quot;, &quot;free from a time of birth&quot;, &quot;free from a time of perishing&quot;, &quot;permanent&quot; (nityo), &quot;immutable&quot; (dhruvo), &quot;inexhaustible&quot;, &quot;constant&quot;, &quot;tranquil&quot; (śivo), &quot;non-dual&quot;, &quot;uncreated&quot;, and &quot;unchangeable&quot; (śāśvato).

=== Types of beings and the one dharmadhātu ===

The dharma-body, the ultimate reality, is also said to be that which is “hidden within a sheath of countless defilements” and which undergoes rebirth in saṃsāra. As such, the Tathāgatagarbha or the naturally pure mind, while covered in a cocoon of adventitious defilements (āgantukakleśa), is primordially linked with all awakened qualities (buddha-guṇa) and remains permanently untainted by the defilements. 

According to the AAN, there are three ways the single reality manifests, which according to Silk are &quot;nothing more than modalities of the embryo of the tathāgatas, variously related to ultimate Reality&quot;:

* Ordinary sentient beings: when the dharmakaya is &quot;ensnared by limitless defilements greater in number than the sands of the Ganges, drifting on the waves of the world from beginningless ages, comes and goes through birth and death”.
* Bodhisattvas, which refers to when the dharmakaya &quot;repels the anguish and suffering of birth and death in the world, banishes all desires, practices the ten perfections, collects the eighty-four thousand teachings, and cultivates the practices leading to bodhi&quot;.
* Buddhas, described in the AAN as follows: “This very dharma-body, thoroughly freed of all sheaths of defilements, having transcended all sufferings, the stains of all defilements vanished, well and truly pure, fixed in the Absolute Reality that is ultimately pure, risen to the stage looked forward to by all beings, having attained peerless heroic strength with respect to all spheres of knowledge, perfected in sovereign power over all things free of all hindrances and unobstructed.&quot;

As such, buddhas, bodhisattvas and sentient beings are not different in terms of their essential nature (their only difference is in the relative state of the covering defilements) and are all therefore not ultimately subject to increase or decrease. The sutra also stresses the non-duality of the ultimate reality (the dharmakāya) and the world of sentient beings (the sattvadhātu) when it states: &quot;not separate from the sattvadhātu is the dharmakāya, not separate from the dharmakāya is the sattvadhātu. The sattvadhātu of beings is precisely the dharmakāya, the dharmakāya is precisely the sattvadhātu.&quot; (Silk, 2015, p. 112 (§15ii)). As Silk writes, for the AAN, the dharmakaya is &quot;the fundamental, unitary ground of all existence, in which ordinary beings then appear as the defiled, transient aspect of the unitary and real existence.&quot;

According to Silk, the view that &quot;all of reality is unitary&quot; is the key to the vision of the AAN. While there are three different aspects or modalities of this unitary reality, they are all one realm, a single essence, which is the common ground for all things. It is only due to the adventitious defilements that this inherent unity is not seen by some. This &quot;cosmic unity&quot; which holds that there is one single reality has been termed a type of monism by Jonathan Silk. Christopher Jones similarly writes that this sutra is defending an &quot;absolute principle,&quot; which is the dharmakāya filled with buddha qualities. All living beings, and all of reality, are merely modes of this absolute reality which also represents &quot;the common nature possessed by all beings&quot;. Jones also adds that for the AAN, the single dharma realm is explained &quot;both in the sense of a common nature shared by all sentient beings, and in the sense of a single realm of existence to which all sentient beings belong.&quot;
