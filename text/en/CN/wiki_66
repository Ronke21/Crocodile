<text>Carnosauria is an extinct group of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs that lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.

While Carnosauria was historically considered largely synonymous with Allosauroidea, some recent studies have revived Carnosauria as clade including both Allosauroidea and Megalosauroidea (which is sometimes recovered as paraphyletic with respect to Allosauroidea), and thus including the majority of non-coleurosaurian members of theropod clade Tetanurae. Other researchers have found Allosauroidea and Megalosauroidea to be unrelated groups.

Distinctive characteristics of carnosaurs include large eye sockets, a long narrow skull and modifications of the legs and pelvis such as the thigh (femur) being longer than the shin (tibia).

Carnosaurs first appeared in the Middle Jurassic around , and the last definitive carnosaur family Carcharodontosauridae became extinct in the Turonian epoch of the Late Cretaceous around . Some theropod remains, once suggested to be putative carcharodontosaurids from the Maastrichtian epoch (72–66 mya) in South America, were later reinterpreted as those of other theropod groups including the abelisaurids and maniraptorans. The phylogenetically problematic megaraptorans, which may or may not be carnosaurs, became extinct in the Maastrichtian epoch.

==History of study==
Carnosauria has traditionally been used as a dumping ground for all large theropods. Even non-dinosaurs, such as the rauisuchian &quot;Teratosaurus&quot;, were once considered carnosaurs. However, analysis in the 1980s and 1990s revealed that other than size, the group shared very few characteristics, making it polyphyletic. Most former carnosaurs (such as the megalosaurids, the spinosaurids, and the ceratosaurs) were reclassified as more primitive theropods. Others (such as the tyrannosaurids) that were more closely related to birds were placed in Coelurosauria. Modern cladistic analysis defines Carnosauria as those tetanurans sharing a more recent common ancestor with &quot;Allosaurus&quot; than with modern birds.

== Anatomy ==

Carnosaurs share certain distinctive features, one of which is a triangular-shaped . They also have 3 fingers per hand, with the second and third digit being approximately equal in length. The femur is larger than the tibia. Another defining feature of carnosaurs is that the chevron bases on their tails have anterior and posterior bone growth. The largest carnosaurs can reach up to 10 meters in length. The length of the body from the tail to the hip is between 54% and 62% of the total body length, and the length of the body from the head to the hip is between 38% and 46% of the total body length. Carnosaurs scaled their limbs relative to their body in a way similar to how other large theropods, like the tyrannosaurids, did. During the Cretaceous, some carnosaurs grew to sizes similar to those of the largest tyrannosaurids. These large carnosaurs lived in the same time period as the other large theropods found in the upper Morrison and Tendaguru formations.

Carnosaurs maintained a similar center of mass across all sizes, which is found to be between 37% and 58% of the femoral length anterior to the hip. Other similarities across all carnosaurs include the structure of their hind limb and pelvis. The pelvis in particular is thought to be designed to reduce stress regardless of body size. In particular, the way the femur is inclined reduces the bending and torsion stress. Furthermore, like other animals with tails, carnosaurs possess a caudofemoralis longus (CFL) muscle that allowed them to flex theirs. Larger carnosaurs are found to have a lower CFL muscle-to-body-mass proportion that smaller carnosaurs.

In addition to body similarities, most carnosaurs, especially most allosauroids are also united by certain skull features. Some of the defining ones include a smaller mandibular fenestra, a short quadrate bone, and a short connection between the braincase and the palate. Allosauroid skulls are about 2.5 to 3 times longer as they are tall. Their narrow skull along with their serrated teeth allow carnosaurs to better slice flesh off of their prey. Carnosaur teeth are flat and have equally-sized denticles on both edges. The flat side of the tooth face the sides of the skull, while the edges align on the same plane as the skull. From analyzing the skull of different carnosaurs, the volume of the cranial vault ranges between 95 milliliters in &quot;Sinraptor&quot; to 250 milliliters in &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;.

&quot;Allosaurus&quot; and &quot;Concavenator&quot; preserve skin impressions showing their integument. In &quot;Allosaurus,&quot; skin impressions showing small scales measuring 1-3 mm are known from the side of the torso and the mandible. Another skin impression from the ventral side of the neck preserves broad scutate scales. An impression from the base of the tail preserves larger scales around 2 cm in diameter. However, it has been noted that these may be sauropod scales due to their similarity and the fact that non-theropod remains were discovered associated with the tail of this particular &quot;Allosaurus&quot; specimen. &quot;Concavenator&quot; preserves rectangular scutate scales on the underside of the tail, as well as scutate scales on the feet along with small scales. A series of knobs on the ulna of &quot;Concavenator&quot; have been interpreted by some authors as quill knobs theorized to have supported primitive quills; however this interpretation has been questioned, and they have been suggested to represent traces of ligaments instead.

==Classification==

Within Carnosauria, there is a slightly more exclusive clade, Allosauroidea. The clade Allosauroidea was originally named by Othniel Charles Marsh, but it was given a formal definition by Phil Currie and Zhao, and later used as a stem-based taxon by Paul Sereno in 1997. Sereno was the first to provide a stem-based definition for the Allosauroidea in 1998, defining the clade as &quot;All neotetanurans closer to &quot;Allosaurus&quot; than to Neornithes.&quot; Kevin Padian used a node-based definition in his 2007 study which defined the Allosauroidea as &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Sinraptor&quot;, their most recent common ancestor, and all of its descendants. Thomas R. Holtz and colleagues and Phil Currie and Ken Carpenter, among others, have followed this node-based definition. Depending on the study, Carnosauria and Allosauroidea are sometimes considered synonymous. In such cases, several researchers have elected to use Allosauroidea over Carnosauria.

===Conventional phylogeny===
The following family tree illustrates the position of Carnosauria within Theropoda. It is a simplified version of the tree presented in a synthesis of the relationships of the major theropod groups based on various studies conducted in the 2010s.

The cladogram presented below illustrates the interrelationships between the four major groups (or families) of carnosaurs. It is a simplified version of the tree presented in the 2012 analysis by Carrano, Benson and Sampson after they excluded three &quot;wildcard&quot; taxa &quot;Poekilopleuron&quot;, &quot;Xuanhanosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Streptospondylus&quot;.

===Alternative hypotheses===
The composition of the clade Carnosauria has been controversial among scientists since at least 2010. Different clades have been recovered by different authors, and a scientific consensus has yet to emerge. 

One such clade is Neovenatoridae, a proposed clade of carcharodontosaurian carnosaurs uniting some primitive members of the group such as &quot;Neovenator&quot; with the Megaraptora, a group of theropods with controversial affinities. Other studies recover megaraptorans as basal coelurosaurs unrelated to carcharodontosaurs. Other theropods with uncertain affinities such as &quot;Gualicho&quot;, &quot;Chilantaisaurus&quot; and &quot;Deltadromeus&quot; are also sometimes included.

Neovenatoridae, as formulated by these authors, contained &quot;Neovenator&quot;, &quot;Chilantaisaurus&quot;, and a newly named clade: Megaraptora. Megaraptora contained &quot;Megaraptor&quot;, &quot;Fukuiraptor&quot;, &quot;Orkoraptor&quot;, &quot;Aerosteon&quot;, and &quot;Australovenator&quot;. These genera were allied with the other neovenatorids on the basis of several features spread out throughout the skeleton, particularly the large amount of pneumatization present. The pneumatic ilium of &quot;Aerosteon&quot; was particularly notable, as &quot;Neovenator&quot; was the only other taxon known to have that trait at the time. Neovenatorids were envisioned as the latest-surviving allosauroids, which were able to persist well into the Late Cretaceous due to their low profile and coelurosaur-like adaptations. Later studies supported this hypothesis, such as Carrano, Benson &amp; Sampson large study of tetanuran relationships in 2012, and Zanno &amp; Makovicky description of the newly discovered theropod &quot;Siats&quot; in 2013, which they placed within Megaraptora. &quot;Fukuiraptor&quot; and &quot;Australovenator&quot; were consistently found to be close relatives of each other; this was also the case for &quot;Aerosteon&quot; and &quot;Megaraptor&quot;. &quot;Orkoraptor&quot; was a taxon difficult to place with certainty.

Phylogenetic studies conducted by Benson, Carrano and Brusatte (2010) and Carrano, Benson and Sampson (2012) recovered the group Megaraptora and a few other taxa as members of the Neovenatoridae. This would make neovenatorids the latest-surviving allosauroids; at least one megaraptoran, &quot;Orkoraptor&quot;, lived near the end of the Mesozoic era, dating to the early Maastrichtian stage of the latest Cretaceous period, about 70 million years ago.

The cladogram below follows a 2016 analysis by Sebastián Apesteguía, Nathan D. Smith, Rubén Juarez Valieri, and Peter J. Makovicky based on the dataset of Carrano &quot;et al.&quot; (2012).

Subsequent analyses have contradicted the above hypothesis. Novas and colleagues conducted an analysis in 2012 which found that &quot;Neovenator&quot; was closely related to carcharodontosaurids, simultaneously found &quot;Megaraptor&quot; and related genera to be coelurosaurs closely related to tyrannosaurids. However, Novas &quot;et al.&quot; subsequently found that megaraptorans lacked most of the key features in the hands of derived coelurosaurs including &quot;Guanlong&quot; and &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. Instead, their hands retain a number of primitive characteristics seen in basal tetanurans such as &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. Nevertheless, there are still a number of other traits that support megaraptorans as members of the Coelurosauria. Other taxa like &quot;Deltadromeus&quot; and &quot;Gualicho&quot; have been alternatively recovered as coelurosaurs or noasaurid ceratosaurs.

Several recent analyses do not find a relationship between &quot;Neovenator&quot; and megaraptorans, which suggests that the latter were not carnosaurs or allosauroids. As a result of these findings, and the fact that &quot;Neovenator&quot; itself is the only uncontroversial neovenatorid, the family Neovenatoridae sees little use in recent publications.

In 2019, Rauhut and Pol described &quot;Asfaltovenator vialidadi&quot;, a basal allosauroid displaying a mosaic of primitive and derived features seen within Tetanurae. Their phylogenetic analysis found traditional Megalosauroidea to represent a basal grade of carnosaurs, paraphyletic with respect to Allosauroidea. Because the authors amended the definition of Allosauroidea to include all theropods that are closer to &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot; than to either &quot;Megalosaurus bucklandii&quot; or Neornithes, the Piatnitzkysauridae was found to fall within Allosauroidea. A cladogram displaying the relationships they recovered is shown below.

The relationship between allosauroids and megalosauroids was also supported by a provisional analysis published by Andrea Cau in 2021. This publication is also the origin of the hypothesis that several &quot;compsognathids&quot; from Europe may have been juvenile carnosaurs. The results of this analysis differ from those of Rauhut and Pol in that Cau finds Megalosauroidea to be monophyletic and the sister-taxon of Allosauroidea within Carnosauria. An abbreviated version of this phylogeny is shown below.

In 2024, Andrea Cau published a paper which presented an analysis of theropod ontogeny which suggested that several theropods that were traditionally considered coelurosaurs may be juvenile allosauroids or megalosauroids. These included &quot;Aorun&quot;, &quot;Juravenator&quot;, &quot;Sciurumimus&quot;, &quot;Scipionyx&quot;, and &quot;Compsognathus&quot;. This hypothesis has not been universally accepted, and it notably conflicts with Cau&#x27;s 2021 publication by finding Megalosauroidea as monophyletic and the sister taxon of Avetheropoda, a grouping which includes both carnosaurs (or allosauroids) and coelurosaurs. Notably, this analysis also treats the abelisauroid genus &quot;Kryptops&quot; as a chimera and suggests that the postcranial remains of this taxon belong to a carnosaur (possibly &quot;Sauroniops&quot;). An abbreviated version of the cladogram from that analysis is shown below.
== Paleobiology and behavior ==

Multiple severe injuries have been found on allosauroid remains, which implies that allosauroids were frequently in dangerous situations and supports the hypothesis of an active, predatory lifestyle. Despite the multitude of injuries, only a few of those injuries show signs of infection. For those injuries that did become infected, the infections were usually local to the site of the injury, implying that the allosauroid immune response was able to quickly stop any infection from spreading to the rest of the body. This type of immune response is similar to modern reptilian immune responses; reptiles secrete fibrin near infected areas and localize the infection before it can spread via the bloodstream.

The injuries were also found to be mostly healed. This healing may indicate that allosauroids had an intermediate metabolic rate, similar to non-avian reptiles, which means they require fewer nutrients in order to survive. A lower nutrient requirement means allosauroids do not need to undertake frequent hunts, which lowers their risk of sustaining traumatic injuries.

Although the remains of other large theropods like tyrannosaurids bear evidence of fighting within their species and with other predators, the remains of allosauroids do not bear much evidence of injuries from theropod combat. Most notably, despite a good fossil record, allosauroid skulls lack the distinctive face-biting wounds that are common in tyrannosaurid skulls, leaving open the question of if allosauroids engaged in interspecies and intraspecies fighting. Remains of the allosauroid &quot;Mapusaurus&quot; are also often found in groups, which could imply the existence of social behavior. While there are alternative explanations for the groupings, like predator traps or habitat reduction due to drought, the frequency of finding allosauroid remains in groups supports the social animal theory. As social animals, allosauroids would share the burden of hunting, allowing injured members of the pack to recover faster.

== Paleobiogeography ==
The paleobiogeographical history of allosauroids closely follows the order that Pangaea separated into the modern continents. By the Middle Jurassic period, tetanurans had spread to every continent and diverged into the allosauroids and the coelurosaurs. Allosauroids first appeared in the Middle Jurassic period and were the first giant taxa (weighing more than 2 tons) in theropod history. Along with members of the superfamily &quot;Megalosauroidea&quot;, allosauroids were the apex predators that occupied the Middle Jurassic to the early Late Cretaceous periods. Allosauroids have been found in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. A probable carcharodontosaurian specimen from the upper Strzelecki Group and the Eumeralla Formation (Aptian-Albian) of Australia might potentially extend their known distribution.

Specifically, a world-wide dispersal of carcharodontosaurids likely happened in the Early Cretaceous. It has been hypothesized that the dispersal involved Italy&#x27;s Apulia region (the “heel” of the Italian peninsula), which was connected to Africa by a land bridge during the Early Cretaceous period; various dinosaur footprints found in Apulia support this theory. Allosauroids were present in both the northern and southern continents during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, but they were later displaced by the tyrannosauroids in North America and Asia during the Late Cretaceous. This is likely due to regional extinction events, which, along with increased species isolation through the severing of land connections between the continents, differentiated many dinosaurs in the Late Cretaceous.

<text>The Golden Ocean is a historical novel written by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1956. It tells the story of a novice midshipman, Peter Palafox, who joins George Anson&#x27;s voyage around the world beginning in 1740. The story is written much in the language and spelling of the mid-18th century. Palafox is a Protestant Irish boy from the west coast of Ireland, schooled by his father, a churchman, and eager to join the Royal Navy. He learns naval discipline and how to determine his ship&#x27;s position at sea as part of a large berth of midshipmen on HMS &quot;Centurion&quot;. His friend Sean O&#x27;Mara joins with him, considered his servant initially by officers and put among the seamen, rising in rank as he shows his abilities, to bosun&#x27;s mate.

The book contains a wealth of period detail, and includes historical figures, like Anson, the midshipman Keppel, Mr Walter, the chaplain to Anson and kind guide and keeper of the purse for Peter Palafox, and captains of other vessels in the squadron.

Reviews in 1994 found it not a mature work from the author, but showing signs of &quot;the Conradian force that shows where O&#x27;Brian was headed as a narrative writer.&quot; Another reviewer felt this novel showed nearly &quot;all the naval lore and sense of place that grace the Aubrey/Maturin books&quot;. It was aimed at younger readers, but two reviewers felt that all readers &quot;will be swept up by the richness of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s prodigious imagination&quot;, and it was &quot;A humorous adventure for all collections.&quot;

==Plot summary==

In spring 1740, Peter Palafox, his friend Sean O&#x27;Mara and Sean&#x27;s uncle Liam are riding from Connaught to Cork so that Peter can join the Royal Navy as a midshipman. Sean decides to join, too, so Liam will take the horses back home. They meet Peregrine FitzGerald at the market fair, another boy heading for HMS &quot;Centurion&quot;. Both lose their money. FitzGerald meets Lord Culmore who loans him ten guineas, solving their money problems. They meet the brig Mary Rose, at Cove of Cork and reach HMS &quot;Centurion&quot; at Spithead on time. Peter is wearing all his best clothes, including a green stone given to him as a &quot;luck giver&quot;. On board Peter learns he must have a sea chest and a uniform. Mr Walter, the chaplain, recognises the emerald pinned to his neck cloth, which can supply all that Peter needs. The emerald from a Spanish ship of the Armada now helps Peter as England fights Spain. Peter likes the ship HMS &quot;Centurion&quot;, but takes time to be at ease with naval discipline. Peter knows the Irish names for the parts of a ship, but not yet the English names. At dinner with Commodore Anson he meets officers on his ship and others in the squadron. Neighbour to Peter is Captain Callis, a man who loved Peter&#x27;s mother long ago and lost her to Peter&#x27;s father. Anson remarks on the terrible decision by the Admiralty to include the Chelsea pensioners (500 infirm sailors) as part of his crew.

Peter tells the chaplain that he knows the ship&#x27;s destination, to the golden ocean, the Pacific, to fight the Spanish. Anson is disappointed that his secret mission is common knowledge on the Irish coast. Common knowledge also knows that the Spanish have a squadron of the same number of ships, under Pizarro. The true voyage begins, after the squadron escorts merchant ships heading east. Six weeks of contrary winds keep them in the English Channel, long enough for the landsman to be used to the sea. FitzGerald, wounded in his fight with Ransome, is now ready for duty, assigned to a watch. When sent to the topmast, FitzGerald can barely do it. Ransome helps him down, so FitzGerald apologises to him. Peter is at home up on the masts, with no fear of heights or the motion of the ship. At Funchal in Madeira in November, FitzGerald returns to England, carrying a letter from Peter to his father, and many gifts for his siblings. Mr Elliot, midshipman, teaches Peter the trigonometry, by the example of a stick of known height and its shadow, a tree whose shadow is paced out, thus the height of the tree is calculated; Peter understands it and succeeds in his classes on board. Before the equator, Peter gets a delirious fever, lasting until they land at Saint Catherine&#x27;s island off Brazil, where they stay past Christmas. Many die of tropical diseases. Mr Ransome is friendlier with him, but still calls him Teague, an insulting name for an Irish boy. Rounding Cape Horn is fierce. They meet with high winds, thick fog, bitter cold and storms, naming several rendezvous points in the Pacific. &quot;Pearl&quot; rejoins after having fallen in with five Spanish ships, the fleet Peter described to Anson. In March 1741, they reach 52 degrees 32 minutes south. Peter is glad for the warm clothes from FitzGerald. None agree on the longitude in waters uncharted by the English. Peter&#x27;s ribs are broken from a rope that froze in this cold, windy weather; he feels lucky he was not tossed into the sea like so many others. Mr Elliot is taken by the scurvy in April, a sore loss to Peter, just after they lose &quot;Pearl&quot; and &quot;Severn&quot;.

&quot;Centurion&quot;, &quot;Gloucester&quot;, &quot;Wager&quot;, &quot;Tryal&quot; and the pink &quot;Anna&quot; think they are west enough to turn north. Hopelessness pervades. Commodore Anson appears to be made of &quot;iron and oak&quot;, a little more affable the worse the weather gets. Sean is captain of the foretop, as he performs well, being sure-footed and brave with frozen sails and ropes. &quot;Centurion&quot; reaches Juan Fernandez, staying there a few months to fix ships and heal the men with good food there. Peter spends a second birthday as a midshipman, having learned the tone of authority and grown out of his best clothes. Peter computes the losses of crew on &quot;Centurion&quot;, &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Tryal&quot; since leaving England: 961 sailed out, 626 dead after reaching Juan Fernandez. &quot;Tryal&quot; takes a prize, a Spanish merchant ship, which vessel replaces the damaged &quot;Tryal&quot;. Spanish passengers are well-treated, a wise move. &quot;Wager&quot; never makes this rendezvous. Reduced squadron sails north, reaching Paita. &quot;Centurion&quot; and &quot;Tryal&quot; crews take the town, made easier by the fear of the locals, who flee on seeing them. An Irishman living there tells Peter where the huge merchant treasure is. They take the ship with the merchant treasure, truly great wealth. All the crew become experts on the rules of sharing prizes, happy with the share they will see. They keep sailing north, aiming for the Acapulco Galleon, which sails between Manila and Acapulco with treasure. Missing the galleon, the Commodore sails west to Manila. Storm damaged &quot;Gloucester&quot; is burned at sea, and her crew taken aboard &quot;Centurion&quot;, the only ship of the squadron now.

&quot;Centurion&quot; stops at Tinian Island in September 1742. Peter is carried ashore. His health is improved by the fresh food. &quot;Centurion&quot; sails to Macau, next to Canton, to refit the ship. Peter spends two years of pay in less than a month. They lose Mr Walter and some officers, who take a merchant ship on the well-travelled route back to England, to report progress and carry mail and gifts home. Refit and rested, &quot;Centurion&quot; is homeward bound. Commodore Anson, once at sea, informs the crew of 227 that they will try again for the Acapulco Galleon, before she reaches Manila. Sailing east, &quot;Centurion&quot; waits for the galleon, engaging her in close battle on June 20, 1743, taking her and her cargo of silver and gold. Mr Saumarez sails the prize and both ships stopped in Macau to transfer the treasure to &quot;Centurion&quot;. Sean is promoted to bosun&#x27;s mate, guarding the treasure aboard the prize and &quot;Centurion&quot; for the year&#x27;s voyage home. Truly homeward bound, they put in at Prince&#x27;s Island, Cape Town (gaining Dutch seamen), speeding to England through a fog in the Channel where they pass unseen French ships, now at war with England. Peter and Sean are paid their shares of the prizes. All of his family is on the lookout for him, for a joyous reunion after four years away. Peter gives his father the good round sum of 1,000 pounds, which will lift his family from genteel poverty.

==Reviews==

Reviews collected were written in 1994 when W W Norton republished the 1956 novel, and more than half of the Aubrey-Maturin series novels had been published. Reviewers viewed the novel as it stood and in contrast to the author&#x27;s later level of accomplishments in that series.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, writing in 1994, says this first sea novel by O&#x27;Brian &quot;can stand on its own as an entertaining and psychologically astute narrative&quot;. They see in this 1956 novel &quot;practically all the naval lore and sense of place that grace the Aubrey/Maturin books&quot;. Specifically, &quot;Shipboard life rings true, the story never flags and humor abounds: &quot;Well, he is a wonderful poacher for a Protestant,&quot; observes one Anglo-Irishman.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; finds this novel &quot;Not a mature piece of work, but appealing enough to satisfy fans of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s naval sagas.&quot;

Tom Clark writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; says that &quot;evidently in keeping with an aim of appealing to a younger audience, the darker aspects of the crew&#x27;s experience are played down in favor of a robust and exhilarating rendering of the great adventure of it all.&quot; It is a first sea novel with a young boy as the main character, but &quot;if there&#x27;s any character in &quot;The Golden Ocean&quot; with heavyweight potential, it&#x27;s the sea itself, whose power as a kind of fate is rendered with the Conradian force that shows where O&#x27;Brian was headed as a narrative writer.&quot; Clark notes that &quot;At least two of those accounts, those of Anson&#x27;s chaplain, Richard Walter, and of a young Irish midshipman, John Philips, appear to have supplied O&#x27;Brian much of what he needed to paint with charming pictorial realism the life both above and below decks on Anson&#x27;s flagship &quot;Centurion&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Library Journal&quot; noted that this book by O&#x27;Brian &quot;set the course they [Aubrey-Maturin series] later followed.&quot; It is recommended for all ages: &quot;A humorous adventure for all collections.&quot;

Scott Veale writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; was upbeat about this novel, saying that &quot;As always, the author&#x27;s erudition and humor are on display, whether he&#x27;s describing the singing of the masts in the wind, the harrowing seas of Cape Horn or 18th-century superstitions.&quot; Veale found the period detail to be &quot;uncompromising&quot;, and expected that readers &quot;will be swept up by the richness of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s prodigious imagination.&quot;

==Related novels by O&#x27;Brian and contrasts to them==

The same expedition is described from the perspective of two on one of the ships in the squadron that did not make it around the globe in O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;The Unknown Shore&quot;. It focusses on the ship HMS &quot;Wager&quot; and different main characters, including John Byron, then a midshipman, age 18.

Mr Walter the chaplain wrote his own account of the voyage of Anson, noted by Clark (above) as one of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s historical sources for this novel and the interactions among the officers and crew. An original copy was at auction in 2009.

In 1969, O&#x27;Brian published &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, the first book in a 20 novel series, known as the Aubrey-Maturin series. It is set in the Napoleonic Wars, begins in 1800, and features a pair of men who become the closest of friends, Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, physician and natural philosopher. In Post Captain, the second novel of the series, Aubrey recalls Anson, and asks Maturin if he has read Anson&#x27;s book. Maturin has, but finds Anson&#x27;s journey wasteful, as Anson noted nothing of the natural world that he saw on the journey. Aubrey is impressed that Anson made the journey and succeeded in it. The Royal Navy has changed since Anson&#x27;s voyage, as have the politics of the world, with the thirteen British colonies in North America now the nation of the United States of America, the War of the Austrian Succession over, including the exit of France from nearly all its North American colonies, the French Revolution in the past, and the Irish Rebellion of 1798 also a past event. The Royal Navy and physicians have learned the need for fresh food and citrus to combat scurvy, a disease which killed so many in Anson&#x27;s squadron, before this connection was made between scurvy and fresh food. The Napoleonic Wars endured so long, that they make a broad canvas of history against which the author sets the lives of his main characters, still keeping a sharp eye to historical detail and period language, which is a different structure than &quot;The Golden Ocean&quot;, which tells the tale of one long and daring voyage. In one sense, O&#x27;Brian views the long eighteenth century as the setting of his works, putting this novel in the same time period as the later series, while technically happening in two different centuries, the 18th and the 19th. They are both set in the Age of Sail, an even longer period of time than the long eighteenth century.

==Allusions to history and real places==

The story is based on a real event, George Anson&#x27;s voyage around the world that began in 1740. Places named in Ireland, England, Madeira, the Pacific coast of South America, Manila, Macau and Canton in China are real, including St. Catherine&#x27;s Island off Brazil at 24 degrees South latitude, shown on this map.

The Spanish galleon &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Covadonga&quot;, after the battle, was sold at Macau and the treasure transferred to &quot;Centurion&quot;, which proceeded to England after a brief rest, arriving there in June 1744.

==Narrative point of view==

This novel was aimed at younger readers, as well as adults, and takes the viewpoint of a new midshipman joining the Royal Navy on HMS &quot;Centurion&quot; in 1740 on this voyage. The boy is on the one ship that makes the entire voyage, and he is one of the survivors. Seen by the midshipman Peter Palafox, the sense of the adventure is depicted, as he sees the world and learns the discipline, hardships and rewards of the Royal Navy. The hardships of the voyage are not dismissed, with counts of the deaths from scurvy, whose cure was not yet understood, and the problems of navigation without the precise knowledge of location gained by chronometers to measure longitude, depicted in detail.

==Publication history==

Rupert Hart-Davis published many of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s works, including translations (e.g., &quot;Papillon&quot; and &quot;Banco: The Further Advancement of Papillon&quot; in 1970 and 1973), &quot;The Road to Samarcand&quot;, &quot;The Golden Ocean&quot;, &quot;The Unknown Shore&quot; and short stories from 1953 to 1974. In 1994, &quot;The Golden Ocean&quot; was re-issued by HarperCollins in the UK and W W Norton in the US.

<text>The Unknown Shore is an historical novel published in 1959 by Patrick O&#x27;Brian. It is the story of two friends, Jack Byron and Tobias Barrow, who sail aboard HMS &quot;Wager&quot; as part of the voyage around the world led by Commodore George Anson in 1740. Their ship did not make it all the way around the world, unlike the flagship. The novel is a fictionalised version of actual events which occurred during the &quot;Wager&quot; mutiny.

Some reviewers feel that the midshipman Byron and the somewhat unworldly surgeon&#x27;s mate Barrow are prototypes for Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the central protagonists of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s subsequent Aubrey–Maturin series set during the Napoleonic Wars.

==Plot summary==
In the early part of the novel, set in London, other members of the expedition are featured. They appear in more detail in &quot;The Golden Ocean&quot;, another O&#x27;Brian novel about the Anson expedition, published in 1956.

The expedition is beset by storms while rounding Cape Horn, and the &quot;Wager&quot; is shipwrecked off the coast of Chile when her position cannot be determined. After the wreck, the crew rejects the authority of their officers and leaves the captain, some officers, and some other crew on the island (now known as Wager Island) while they sail away in a boat built from the wreck. The marooned officers make their way to a Spanish settlement with the help of the native people. The novel is based on the accounts of actual survivors. Survivors from the lower deck made their way back to Britain long before the officers. The novel describes the crew members asserting that the officers had no authority over them, once their ship was wrecked.

==Characters in &quot;The Unknown Shore&quot;==
*Jack Byron – midshipman aboard HMS &quot;Wager&quot; and the chief protagonist
*Tobias Barrow – Jack&#x27;s friend

==Allusions to real events==
The &quot;Wager&quot; crew did reject the authority of their officers, once the ship was wrecked, in what became known as the &quot;Wager&quot; mutiny in 1741.
The lesson of the wreck of the &quot;Wager&quot; played a role in revising British naval discipline, so that officers did retain formal authority over crew members even when their ships were lost or captured.

==Allusions to real persons==
John &quot;Jack&quot; Byron was an historical person and the basic facts of the story are true. He went on to a distinguished naval career, rising to the rank of vice-admiral. There is an &quot;easter egg&quot; that O&#x27;Brian includes in the novel: his version of Jack Byron secretly writes poetry, and wants Tobias to refrain from mentioning it to any of his peers. This is perhaps an allusion to the fact that the famous poet Lord Byron was one of John Byron&#x27;s grandsons.

<doc id="1252300" wikidata="Q17002897" url="?curid=1252300" title="Entre la jeunesse et la sagesse">
<text>Entre la jeunesse et la sagesse is the fourth album by Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, released in 1980. Consisting entirely of songs in French, the album was initially available only in Canada. The subsequent international release was simply called French Record.

The title of the first track is a pun: &quot;Lajeunesse&quot; is a street name in Montreal, Quebec but, since &quot;la jeunesse&quot; means &quot;youth&quot; and &quot;la sagesse&quot; means &quot;wisdom&quot;, the title of the album means &quot;between youth and wisdom&quot;.

==Critical reception==
In his review in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Colin Irwin wrote: &quot;I love &quot;French Record&quot;. I&#x27;m intoxicated by its shambling nonchalance; I&#x27;m seduced by its gentle, subtle nuances; and I&#x27;m in gleeful awe of its absolute, uncalculating disregard for the dictates of current style and influence. [...] It exudes such an enchanting atmosphere that it doesn&#x27;t matter that you can&#x27;t understand a damn thing they&#x27;re on about (though translations are supplied on the sleeve). [...] It&#x27;s a collection that swamps you in its sheer romance; yet stealthily avoids the danger of being dragged into slush by the discreet arrangements and surprisingly broad array of styles within the sentiment. [...] The music contains such a depth of feeling and emotion, it&#x27;s obviously a work Kate and Anna have had in their hearts for a long time. [...] Ultimately, it&#x27;s those &quot;harmonies&quot; that grab you tightest... joyful, mournful, bright, dour... no studio effect on Earth can communicate the disparate highs and lows of human emotion as eloquently as the bare voices of these two girls. You don&#x27;t need to be a Frenchman to be convinced of &quot;that&quot;.&quot;

In his review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Don Shewey stated: &quot;All [tracks] boast the tunefulness, instant familiarity and (judging from the characteristically whimsical liner notes) intelligently emotional subject matter for which the McGarrigles are known and loved. Fortunately, their usual spicy folk instrumentation remains intact. [...] &quot;Unexpectedly, singing in French inspires the McGarrigles, especially Anna, to new levels of passion. The author of &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot; (which Linda Ronstadt made famous), Anna has generally sung in a wistfully frail soprano. But on French Record, particularly in &quot;Mais Quand Tu Danses&quot; and &quot;Excursion à Venise,&quot; she reveals a large, gutsy, even guttural voice that&#x27;s a pleasure to discover. [...] Nearly all the songs, whether by Kate or Anna, are collaborations with Canadian poet Philippe Tatartcheff. Most are distinctive for their offhand imagery and dry wit. [...] It&#x27;s good to have the mischievous McGarrigles back!&quot;

In his review in &quot;Folk Roots&quot; magazine, Lawrence H. Heath stated: &quot;&quot;French Record&quot; was put on Earth to be enjoyed, to be delighted in [...]. It&#x27;s just two French-Canadian sisters with heaven-sent voices and heartfelt harmonies, singing melodies that could move mountains to tears in the company of musicians whose empathy is exceeded only by their sureness of touch. [...] It&#x27;s just the best album Kate and Anna McGarrigle have made to date, that&#x27;s all (and everything!) [...] &quot;French Record&quot; is one of those rare albums without a single duff track — or nanosecond for that matter.&quot;

==Release history==
The album was released on vinyl LP with two different covers: the first by Kébec-Disc in Canada, titled Entre la jeunesse et la sagesse in May 1980, and the second by Hannibal Records in the rest of the world, titled simply French Record, in February 1981.

it was re-released on CD in 2003 by La Tribu, with both French Record and Entre Lajeunesse et la sagesse appearing in the title, and on the same cover as the original Hannibal LP.

==Overview==
The album comprises eleven songs, including three that had been released on earlier albums:

*&quot;Complainte pour Ste-Catherine&quot;, on &quot;Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle&quot; (1976)
*&quot;Naufragée du tendre&quot;, on &quot;Dancer with Bruised Knees&quot; (1977); this is a new, re-recorded version of the song
*&quot;Prends ton manteau&quot;, on &quot;Pronto Monto&quot; (1978).

<doc id="1252308" wikidata="Q1187945" url="?curid=1252308" title="Law of thought">
<text>The laws of thought are fundamental axiomatic rules upon which rational discourse itself is often considered to be based. The formulation and clarification of such rules have a long tradition in the history of philosophy and logic. Generally they are taken as laws that guide and underlie everyone&#x27;s thinking, thoughts, expressions, discussions, etc. However, such classical ideas are often questioned or rejected in more recent developments, such as intuitionistic logic, dialetheism and fuzzy logic.

According to the 1999 &quot;Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy&quot;, laws of thought are laws by which or in accordance with which valid thought proceeds, or that justify valid inference, or to which all valid deduction is reducible. Laws of thought are rules that apply without exception to any subject matter of thought, etc.; sometimes they are said to be the object of logic. The term, rarely used in exactly the same sense by different authors, has long been associated with three equally ambiguous expressions: the law of identity (ID), the law of contradiction (or non-contradiction; NC), and the law of excluded middle (EM).
Sometimes, these three expressions are taken as propositions of formal ontology having the widest possible subject matter, propositions that apply to entities as such: (ID), everything is (i.e., is identical to) itself; (NC) no thing having a given quality also has the negative of that quality (e.g., no even number is non-even); (EM) every thing either has a given quality or has the negative of that quality (e.g., every number is either even or non-even). Equally common in older works is the use of these expressions for principles of metalogic about propositions: (ID) every proposition implies itself; (NC) no proposition is both true and false; (EM) every proposition is either true or false.

Beginning in the middle to late 1800s, these expressions have been used to denote propositions of Boolean algebra about classes: (ID) every class includes itself; (NC) every class is such that its intersection (&quot;product&quot;) with its own complement is the null class; (EM) every class is such that its union (&quot;sum&quot;) with its own complement is the universal class. More recently, the last two of the three expressions have been used in connection with the classical propositional logic and with the so-called protothetic or quantified propositional logic; in both cases the law of non-contradiction involves the negation of the conjunction (&quot;and&quot;) of something with its own negation, ¬(A∧¬A), and the law of excluded middle involves the disjunction (&quot;or&quot;) of something with its own negation, A∨¬A. In the case of propositional logic, the &quot;something&quot; is a schematic letter serving as a place-holder, whereas in the case of protothetic logic the &quot;something&quot; is a genuine variable. The expressions &quot;law of non-contradiction&quot; and &quot;law of excluded middle&quot; are also used for semantic principles of model theory concerning sentences and interpretations: (NC) under no interpretation is a given sentence both true and false, (EM) under any interpretation, a given sentence is either true or false.

The expressions mentioned above all have been used in many other ways. Many other propositions have also been mentioned as laws of thought, including the dictum de omni et nullo attributed to Aristotle, the substitutivity of identicals (or equals) attributed to Euclid, the so-called identity of indiscernibles attributed to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and other &quot;logical truths&quot;.

The expression &quot;laws of thought&quot; gained added prominence through its use by Boole (1815–64) to denote theorems of his &quot;algebra of logic&quot;; in fact, he named his second logic book &quot;An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities&quot; (1854). Modern logicians, in almost unanimous disagreement with Boole, take this expression to be a misnomer; none of the above propositions classed under &quot;laws of thought&quot; are explicitly about thought per se, a mental phenomenon studied by psychology, nor do they involve explicit reference to a thinker or knower as would be the case in pragmatics or in epistemology. The distinction between psychology (as a study of mental phenomena) and logic (as a study of valid inference) is widely accepted.

==The three traditional laws==

===History===
Hamilton offers a history of the three traditional laws that begins with Plato, proceeds through Aristotle, and ends with the schoolmen of the Middle Ages; in addition he offers a fourth law (see entry below, under Hamilton):

:&quot;The principles of Contradiction and Excluded Middle can be traced back to Plato: The principles of Contradiction and of Excluded Middle can both be traced back to Plato, by whom they were enounced and frequently applied; though it was not till long after, that either of them obtained a distinctive appellation. To take the principle of Contradiction first. This law Plato frequently employs, but the most remarkable passages are found in the Phœdo, in the Sophista, and in the fourth and seventh books of the Republic. [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 62]

:Law of Excluded Middle: The law of Excluded Middle between two contradictories remounts, as I have said, also to Plato, though the Second Alcibiades, the dialogue in which it is most clearly expressed, must be admitted to be spurious. It is also in the fragments of Pseudo-Archytas, to be found in Stobæus. [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65]

:Hamilton further observes that &quot;It is explicitly and emphatically enounced by Aristotle in many passages both of his Metaphysics (l. iii. (iv.) c.7.) and of his Analytics, both Prior (l. i. c. 2) and Posterior (1. i. c. 4). In the first of these, he says: &quot;It is impossible that there should exist any medium between contradictory opposites, but it is necessary either to affirm or to deny everything of everything.&quot; [Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65]

:&quot;Law of Identity. [Hamilton also calls this &quot;The principle of all logical affirmation and definition&quot;] Antonius Andreas: The law of Identity, I stated, was not explicated as a coordinate principle till a comparatively recent period. The earliest author in whom I have found this done, is Antonius Andreas, a scholar of Scotus, who flourished at the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century. The schoolman, in the fourth book of his Commentary of Aristotle&#x27;s Metaphysics – a commentary which is full of the most ingenious and original views, – not only asserts to the law of Identity a coordinate dignity with the law of Contradiction, but, against Aristotle, he maintains that the principle of Identity, and not the principle of Contradiction, is the one absolutely first. The formula in which Andreas expressed it was &quot;Ens est ens&quot;. Subsequently to this author, the question concerning the relative priority of the two laws of Identity and of Contradiction became one much agitated in the schools; though there were also found some who asserted to the law of Excluded Middle this supreme rank.&quot; [From Hamilton LECT. V. LOGIC. 65–66]

=== Three traditional laws: identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle ===

The following states the three traditional &quot;laws&quot; in the words of Bertrand Russell (1912):

====The law of identity====

The law of identity: &#x27;Whatever is, is.&#x27;

For all a: a = a.

Regarding this law, Aristotle wrote:
More than two millennia later, George Boole alluded to the very same principle as did Aristotle when Boole made the following observation with respect to the nature of language and those principles that must inhere naturally within them: 

====The law of non-contradiction====

The law of non-contradiction (alternately the &#x27;law of contradiction&#x27;): &#x27;Nothing can both be and not be.&#x27;

In other words: &quot;two or more contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time&quot;: ¬(A∧¬A).

In the words of Aristotle, that &quot;one cannot say of something that it is and that it is not in the same respect and at the same time&quot;. As an illustration of this law, he wrote:
====The law of excluded middle====

The law of excluded middle: &#x27;Everything must either be or not be.&#x27;

In accordance with the law of excluded middle or excluded third, for every proposition, either its positive or negative form is true: A∨¬A.

Regarding the law of excluded middle, Aristotle wrote:

===Rationale===
As the quotations from Hamilton above indicate, in particular the &quot;law of identity&quot; entry, the rationale for and expression of the &quot;laws of thought&quot; have been fertile ground for philosophic debate since Plato. Today the debate—about how we &quot;come to know&quot; the world of things and our thoughts—continues; for examples of rationales see the entries, below.

==Plato==
In one of Plato&#x27;s Socratic dialogues, Socrates described three principles derived from introspection: 

==Indian logic==
The law of non-contradiction is found in ancient Indian logic as a meta-rule in the &quot;Shrauta Sutras&quot;, the grammar of Pāṇini, and the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; attributed to Vyasa. It was later elaborated on by medieval commentators such as Madhvacharya.

==Locke==
John Locke claimed that the principles of identity and contradiction (i.e. the law of identity and the law of non-contradiction) were general ideas and only occurred to people after considerable abstract, philosophical thought. He characterized the principle of identity as &quot;Whatsoever is, is.&quot; He stated the principle of contradiction as &quot;It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.&quot; To Locke, these were not innate or &quot;a priori&quot; principles.

==Leibniz==
Gottfried Leibniz formulated three additional principles, either or both of which may sometimes be counted as a law of thought:

:* principle of sufficient reason
:* indiscernability of identicals
:* identity of indiscernibles

In Leibniz&#x27;s thought, as well as generally in the approach of rationalism, the latter two principles are regarded as clear and incontestable axioms. They were widely recognized in European thought of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, although they were subject to greater debate in the 19th century. As turned out to be the case with the law of continuity, these two laws involve matters which, in contemporary terms, are subject to much debate and analysis (respectively on determinism and extensionality). Leibniz&#x27;s principles were particularly influential in German thought. In France, the &quot;Port-Royal Logic&quot; was less swayed by them. Hegel quarrelled with the identity of indiscernibles in his &quot;Science of Logic&quot; (1812–1816).

==Schopenhauer==

===Four laws===
&quot;The primary laws of thought, or the conditions of the thinkable, are four: – 1. The law of identity [A is A]. 2. The law of contradiction. 3. The law of exclusion; or excluded middle. 4. The law of sufficient reason.&quot; (Thomas Hughes, &quot;The Ideal Theory of Berkeley and the Real World&quot;, Part II, Section XV, Footnote, p. 38)

Arthur Schopenhauer discussed the laws of thought and tried to demonstrate that they are the basis of reason. He listed them in the following way in his &quot;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&quot;, §33:

#A subject is equal to the sum of its predicates, or a = a.
#No predicate can be simultaneously attributed and denied to a subject, or a ≠ ~a.
#Of every two contradictorily opposite predicates one must belong to every subject.
#Truth is the reference of a judgment to something outside it as its sufficient reason or ground.
Also:
To show that they are the foundation of reason, he gave the following explanation:
Schopenhauer&#x27;s four laws can be schematically presented in the following manner:
#A is A.
#A is not not-A.
#X is either A or not-A.
#If A then B (A implies B).

===Two laws===

Later, in 1844, Schopenhauer claimed that the four laws of thought could be reduced to two. In the ninth chapter of the second volume of &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, he wrote:
==Boole (1854): From his &quot;laws of the mind&quot; Boole derives Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Law of contradiction&quot; ==
The title of George Boole&#x27;s 1854 treatise on logic, &quot;An Investigation on the Laws of Thought&quot;, indicates an alternate path. The laws are now incorporated into an algebraic representation of his &quot;laws of the mind&quot;, honed over the years into modern Boolean algebra.

=== Rationale: How the &quot;laws of the mind&quot; are to be distinguished ===
Boole begins his chapter I &quot;Nature and design of this Work&quot; with a discussion of what characteristic distinguishes, generally, &quot;laws of the mind&quot; from &quot;laws of nature&quot;:
: &quot;The general laws of Nature are not, for the most part, immediate objects of perception. They are either inductive inferences from a large body of facts, the common truth in which they express, or, in their origin at least, physical hypotheses of a causal nature. ... They are in all cases, and in the strictest sense of the term, probable conclusions, approaching, indeed, ever and ever nearer to certainty, as they receive more and more of the confirmation of experience. ...&quot;

Contrasted with this are what he calls &quot;laws of the mind&quot;: Boole asserts these are known in their first instance, without need of repetition: 
:&quot;On the other hand, the knowledge of the laws of the mind does not require as its basis any extensive collection of observations. The general truth is seen in the particular instance, and it is not confirmed by the repetition of instances. ... we not only see in the particular example the general truth, but we see it also as a certain truth – a truth, our confidence in which will not continue to increase with increasing experience of its practical verification.&quot; (Boole 1854:4)

=== Boole&#x27;s signs and their laws ===
Boole begins with the notion of &quot;signs&quot; representing &quot;classes&quot;, &quot;operations&quot; and &quot;identity&quot;:
:&quot;All the signs of Language, as an instrument of reasoning may be conducted by a system of signs composed of the following elements
::&quot;1st Literal symbols as x, y, etc representing things as subjects of our conceptions,
::&quot;2nd Signs of operation, as +, −, x standing for those operations of the mind by which conceptions of things are combined or resolved so as to form new conceptions involving the same elements,
::&quot;3rd The sign of identity, =.
:And these symbols of Logic are in their use subject to definite laws, partly agreeing with and partly differing from the laws of the corresponding symbols in the science of Algebra. (Boole 1854:27)

Boole then clarifies what a &quot;literal symbol&quot; e.g. x, y, z... represents—a name applied to a collection of instances into &quot;classes&quot;. For example, &quot;bird&quot; represents the entire class of feathered winged warm-blooded creatures. For his purposes he extends the notion of class to represent membership of &quot;one&quot;, or &quot;nothing&quot;, or &quot;the universe&quot; i.e. totality of all individuals: 
:&quot;Let us then agree to represent the class of individuals to which a particular name or description is applicable, by a single letter, as z. ... By a class is usually meant a collection of individuals, to each of which a particular name or description may be applied; but in this work the meaning of the term will be extended so as to include the case in which but a single individual exists, answering to the required name or description, as well as the cases denoted by the terms &quot;nothing&quot; and &quot;universe,&quot; which as &quot;classes&quot; should be understood to comprise respectively &#x27;no beings,&#x27; &#x27;all beings.&#x27;&quot; (Boole 1854:28)

He then defines what the string of symbols e.g. xy means [modern logical &amp;, conjunction]:
:&quot;Let it further be agreed, that by the combination xy shall be represented that class of things to which the names or descriptions represented by x and y are simultaneously, applicable. Thus, if x alone stands for &quot;white things,&quot; and y for &quot;sheep,&quot; let xy stand for &#x27;white Sheep;&#x27;&quot; (Boole 1854:28)

Given these definitions he now lists his laws with their justification plus examples (derived from Boole):
* (1) xy = yx [commutative law]
:: &quot;x represents &#x27;estuaries,&#x27; and y &#x27;rivers,&#x27; the expressions xy and yx will indifferently represent&quot; &#x27;rivers that are estuaries,&#x27; or &#x27;estuaries that are rivers,&#x27;&quot;
* (2) xx = x, alternately x2 = x [Absolute identity of meaning, Boole&#x27;s &quot;fundamental law of thought&quot; cf page 49]
:: &quot;Thus &#x27;good, good&#x27; men, is equivalent to &#x27;good&#x27; men&quot;.
Logical OR: Boole defines the &quot;collecting of parts into a whole or separate a whole into its parts&quot; (Boole 1854:32). Here the connective &quot;and&quot; is used disjunctively, as is &quot;or&quot;; he presents a commutative law (3) and a distributive law (4) for the notion of &quot;collecting&quot;. The notion of &quot;separating&quot; a part from the whole he symbolizes with the &quot;-&quot; operation; he defines a commutative (5) and distributive law (6) for this notion:
* (3) y + x = x + y [commutative law]
:: &quot;Thus the expression &#x27;men and women&#x27; is ... equivalent with the expression&quot; women and men. Let x represent &#x27;men,&#x27; y, &#x27;women&#x27; and let + stand for &#x27;and&#x27; and &#x27;or&#x27; ...&quot; 
* (4) z(x + y) = zx + zy [distributive law]
:: z = European, (x = &quot;men, y = women): European men and women = European men and European women
* (5) x − y = −y + x [commutation law: separating a part from the whole] 
:: &quot;All men (x) except Asiatics (y)&quot; is represented by x − y. &quot;All states (x) except monarchical states (y)&quot; is represented by x − y
* (6) z(x − y) = zx − zy [distributive law]
Lastly is a notion of &quot;identity&quot; symbolized by &quot;=&quot;. This allows for two axioms: (axiom 1): equals added to equals results in equals, (axiom 2): equals subtracted from equals results in equals.
* (7) Identity (&quot;is&quot;, &quot;are&quot;) e.g. x = y + z, &quot;stars&quot; = &quot;suns&quot; and &quot;the planets&quot;

Nothing &quot;0&quot; and Universe &quot;1&quot;: He observes that the only two numbers that satisfy xx = x are 0 and 1. He then observes that 0 represents &quot;Nothing&quot; while &quot;1&quot; represents the &quot;Universe&quot; (of discourse).

The logical NOT: Boole defines the contrary (logical NOT) as follows (his Proposition III): 
:&quot;If x represent any class of objects, then will 1 − x represent the contrary or supplementary class of objects, i.e. the class including all objects which are not comprehended in the class x&quot; (Boole 1854:48)
::If x = &quot;men&quot; then &quot;1 − x&quot; represents the &quot;universe&quot; less &quot;men&quot;, i.e. &quot;not-men&quot;.

The notion of a particular as opposed to a universal: To represent the notion of &quot;some men&quot;, Boole writes the small letter &quot;v&quot; before the predicate-symbol &quot;vx&quot; some men.

Exclusive- and inclusive-OR: Boole does not use these modern names, but he defines these as follows x(1-y) + y(1-x) and x + y(1-x), respectively; these agree with the formulas derived by means of the modern Boolean algebra.

===Boole derives the law of contradiction ===
Armed with his &quot;system&quot; he derives the &quot;principle of [non]contradiction&quot; starting with his law of identity: x2 = x. He subtracts x from both sides (his axiom 2), yielding x2 − x = 0. He then factors out the x: x(x − 1) = 0. For example, if x = &quot;men&quot; then 1 − x represents NOT-men. So we have an example of the &quot;Law of Contradiction&quot;:
:&quot;Hence: x(1 − x) will represent the class whose members are at once &quot;men,&quot; and&quot; not men,&quot; and the equation [x(1 − x)=0] thus express the principle, that a class whose members are at the same time men and not men does not exist. In other words, that it is impossible for the same individual to be at the same time a man and not a man. ... this is identically that &quot;principle of contradiction&quot; which Aristotle has described as the fundamental axiom of all philosophy. ... what has been commonly regarded as the fundamental axiom of metaphysics is but the consequence of a law of thought, mathematical in its form.&quot; (with more explanation about this &quot;dichotomy&quot; comes about cf Boole 1854:49ff)

=== Boole defines the notion &quot;domain (universe) of discourse&quot;===
This notion is found throughout Boole&#x27;s &quot;Laws of Thought&quot; e.g. 1854:28, where the symbol &quot;1&quot; (the integer 1) is used to represent &quot;Universe&quot; and &quot;0&quot; to represent &quot;Nothing&quot;, and in far more detail later (pages 42ff):
:&quot; Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. ... Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.&quot;

In his chapter &quot;The Predicate Calculus&quot; Kleene observes that the specification of the &quot;domain&quot; of discourse is &quot;not a trivial assumption, since it is not always clearly satisfied in ordinary discourse ... in mathematics likewise, logic can become pretty slippery when no D [domain] has been specified explicitly or implicitly, or the specification of a D [domain] is too vague (Kleene 1967:84).

==Hamilton (1837–38 lectures on Logic, published 1860): a 4th &quot;Law of Reason and Consequent&quot;==
As noted above, Hamilton specifies &quot;four&quot; laws—the three traditional plus the fourth &quot;Law of Reason and Consequent&quot;—as follows:
:&quot;XIII. The Fundamental Laws of Thought, or the conditions of the thinkable, as commonly received, are four: – 1. The Law of Identity; 2. The Law of Contradiction; 3. The Law of Exclusion or of Excluded Middle; and, 4. The Law of Reason and Consequent, or of Sufficient Reason.&quot;

===Rationale: &quot;Logic is the science of the Laws of Thought as Thought&quot;===
Hamilton opines that thought comes in two forms: &quot;necessary&quot; and &quot;contingent&quot; (Hamilton 1860:17). With regards the &quot;necessary&quot; form he defines its study as &quot;logic&quot;: &quot;Logic is the science of the necessary forms of thought&quot; (Hamilton 1860:17). To define &quot;necessary&quot; he asserts that it implies the following four &quot;qualities&quot;:
:(1) &quot;determined or necessitated by the nature of the thinking subject itself ... it is subjectively, not objectively, determined;
:(2) &quot;original and not acquired;
:(3) &quot;universal; that is, it cannot be that it necessitates on some occasions, and does not necessitate on others.
:(4) &quot;it must be a law; for a law is that which applies to all cases without exception, and from which a deviation is ever, and everywhere, impossible, or, at least, unallowed. ... This last condition, likewise, enables us to give the most explicit enunciation of the object-matter of Logic, in saying that Logic is the science of the Laws of Thought as Thought, or the science of the Formal Laws of Thought, or the science of the Laws of the Form of Thought; for all these are merely various expressions of the same thing.&quot;

===Hamilton&#x27;s 4th law: &quot;Infer nothing without ground or reason&quot;===
Here&#x27;s Hamilton&#x27;s fourth law from his LECT. V. LOGIC. 60–61:

:&quot;I now go on to the fourth law.

:&quot;Par. XVII. Law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent:

:&quot;XVII. The thinking of an object, as actually characterized by positive or by negative attributes, is not left to the caprice of Understanding – the faculty of thought; but that faculty must be necessitated to this or that determinate act of thinking by a knowledge of something different from, and independent of; the process of thinking itself. This condition of our understanding is expressed by the law, as it is called, of Sufficient Reason (principium Rationis Sufficientis); but it is more properly denominated the law of Reason and Consequent (principium Rationis et Consecutionis). That knowledge by which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit something else, is called the &quot;logical reason ground,&quot; or &quot;antecedent&quot;; that something else which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit, is called the &quot;logical consequent&quot;; and the relation between the reason and consequent, is called the &quot;logical connection or consequence&quot;. This law is expressed in the formula – Infer nothing without a ground or reason.1

:Relations between Reason and Consequent: The relations between Reason and Consequent, when comprehended in a pure thought, are the following:
:1. When a reason is explicitly or implicitly given, then there must ¶ exist a consequent; and, &quot;vice versa&quot;, when a consequent is given, there must also exist a reason.

::1 See Schulze, &quot;Logik&quot;, §19, and Krug, &quot;Logik&quot;, §20, – ED.

:2. Where there is no reason there can be no consequent; and, &quot;vice versa&quot;, where there is no consequent (either implicitly or explicitly) there can be no reason. That is, the concepts of reason and of consequent, as reciprocally relative, involve and suppose each other.

:The logical significance of this law: The logical significance of the law of Reason and Consequent lies in this, – That in virtue of it, thought is constituted into a series of acts all indissolubly connected; each necessarily inferring the other. Thus it is that the distinction and opposition of possible, actual and necessary matter, which has been introduced into Logic, is a doctrine wholly extraneous to this science.

==Welton==
In the 19th century, the Aristotelian laws of thoughts, as well as sometimes the Leibnizian laws of thought, were standard material in logic textbooks, and J. Welton described them in this way:
==Russell (1903–1927)==
The sequel to Bertrand Russell&#x27;s 1903 &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; became the three-volume work named &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (hereafter &quot;PM&quot;), written jointly with Alfred North Whitehead. Immediately after he and Whitehead published &quot;PM&quot; he wrote his 1912 &quot;The Problems of Philosophy&quot;. His &quot;Problems&quot; reflects &quot;the central ideas of Russell&#x27;s logic&quot;.

===&quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; (1903)===
In his 1903 &quot;Principles&quot; Russell defines Symbolic or Formal Logic (he uses the terms synonymously) as &quot;the study of the various general types of deduction&quot; (Russell 1903:11). He asserts that &quot;Symbolic Logic is essentially concerned with inference in general&quot; (Russell 1903:12) and with a footnote indicates that he does not distinguish between inference and deduction; moreover he considers induction &quot;to be either disguised deduction or a mere method of making plausible guesses&quot; (Russell 1903:11). This opinion will change by 1912, when he deems his &quot;principle of induction&quot; to be par with the various &quot;logical principles&quot; that include the &quot;Laws of Thought&quot;.

In his Part I &quot;The Indefinables of Mathematics&quot; Chapter II &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; Part A &quot;The Propositional Calculus&quot; Russell reduces deduction (&quot;propositional calculus&quot;) to 2 &quot;indefinables&quot; and 10 axioms:
:&quot;17. We require, then, in the propositional calculus, no indefinable except the two kinds of implication [simple aka &quot;material&quot; and &quot;formal&quot;]-- remembering, however, that formal implication is a complex notion, whose analysis remains to be undertaken. As regards our two indefinables, we require certain indemonstrable propositions, which hitherto I have not succeeded in reducing to less ten (Russell 1903:15).

From these he &quot;claims&quot; to be able to &quot;derive&quot; the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction but does not exhibit his derivations (Russell 1903:17). Subsequently, he and Whitehead honed these &quot;primitive principles&quot; and axioms into the nine found in &quot;PM&quot;, and here Russell actually &quot;exhibits&quot; these two derivations at ❋1.71 and ❋3.24, respectively.

===&quot;The Problems of Philosophy&quot; (1912)===
By 1912 Russell in his &quot;Problems&quot; pays close attention to &quot;induction&quot; (inductive reasoning) as well as &quot;deduction&quot; (inference), both of which represent just two &quot;examples&quot; of &quot;self-evident logical principles&quot; that include the &quot;Laws of Thought.&quot;

Induction principle: Russell devotes a chapter to his &quot;induction principle&quot;. He describes it as coming in two parts: firstly, as a repeated collection of evidence (with no failures of association known) and therefore increasing probability that whenever A happens B follows; secondly, in a fresh instance when indeed A happens, B will indeed follow: i.e. &quot;a sufficient number of cases of association will make the probability of a fresh association nearly a certainty, and will make it approach certainty without limit.&quot;

He then collects all the cases (instances) of the induction principle (e.g. case 1: A1 = &quot;the rising sun&quot;, B1 = &quot;the eastern sky&quot;; case 2: A2 = &quot;the setting sun&quot;, B2 = &quot;the western sky&quot;; case 3: etc.) into a &quot;general&quot; law of induction which he expresses as follows:
:&quot;(a) The greater the number of cases in which a thing of the sort A has been found associated with a thing of the sort B, the more probable it is (if cases of failure of association are known) that A is always associated with B;
:&quot;(b) Under the same circumstances, a sufficient number of cases of the association of A with B will make it nearly certain that A is always associated with B, and will make this general law approach certainty without limit.&quot;

He makes an argument that this induction principle can neither be disproved or proved by experience, the failure of disproof occurring because the law deals with &quot;probability&quot; of success rather than certainty; the failure of proof occurring because of unexamined cases that are yet to be experienced, i.e. they will occur (or not) in the future. &quot;Thus we must either accept the inductive principle on the ground of its intrinsic evidence, or forgo all justification of our expectations about the future&quot;.

In his next chapter (&quot;On Our Knowledge of General Principles&quot;) Russell offers other principles that have this similar property: &quot;which cannot be proved or disproved by experience, but are used in arguments which start from what is experienced.&quot; He asserts that these &quot;have even greater evidence than the principle of induction ... the knowledge of them has the same degree of certainty as the knowledge of the existence of sense-data. They constitute the means of drawing inferences from what is given in sensation&quot;.

Inference principle: Russell then offers an example that he calls a &quot;logical&quot; principle. Twice previously he has asserted this principle, first as the 4th axiom in his 1903 and then as his first &quot;primitive proposition&quot; of &quot;PM&quot;: &quot;❋1.1 Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true&quot;. Now he repeats it in his 1912 in a refined form: &quot;Thus our principle states that if this implies that, and this is true, then that is true. In other words, &#x27;anything implied by a true proposition is true&#x27;, or &#x27;whatever follows from a true proposition is true&#x27;. This principle he places great stress upon, stating that &quot;this principle is really involved – at least, concrete instances of it are involved – in all demonstrations&quot;.

He does not call his inference principle &quot;modus ponens&quot;, but his formal, symbolic expression of it in &quot;PM&quot; (2nd edition 1927) is that of &quot;modus ponens&quot;; modern logic calls this a &quot;rule&quot; as opposed to a &quot;law&quot;. In the quotation that follows, the symbol &quot;⊦&quot; is the &quot;assertion-sign&quot; (cf &quot;PM&quot;:92); &quot;⊦&quot; means &quot;it is true that&quot;, therefore &quot;⊦p&quot; where &quot;p&quot; is &quot;the sun is rising&quot; means &quot;it is true that the sun is rising&quot;, alternately &quot;The statement &#x27;The sun is rising&#x27; is true&quot;. The &quot;implication&quot; symbol &quot;⊃&quot; is commonly read &quot;if p then q&quot;, or &quot;p implies q&quot; (cf &quot;PM&quot;:7). Embedded in this notion of &quot;implication&quot; are two &quot;primitive ideas&quot;, &quot;the Contradictory Function&quot; (symbolized by NOT, &quot;~&quot;) and &quot;the Logical Sum or Disjunction&quot; (symbolized by OR, &quot;⋁&quot;); these appear as &quot;primitive propositions&quot; ❋1.7 and ❋1.71 in &quot;PM&quot; (PM:97). With these two &quot;primitive propositions&quot; Russell defines &quot;p ⊃ q&quot; to have the formal logical equivalence &quot;NOT-p OR q&quot; symbolized by &quot;~p ⋁ q&quot;:
:&quot;&quot;Inference&quot;. The process of inference is as follows: a proposition &quot;p&quot; is asserted, and a proposition &quot;p implies q&quot; is asserted, and then as a sequel the proposition &quot;q&quot; is asserted. The trust in inference is the belief that if the two former assertions are not in error, the final assertion is not in error. Accordingly, whenever, in symbols, where p and q have of course special determination
::&quot; &quot;⊦p&quot; and &quot;⊦(p ⊃ q)&quot;
:&quot; have occurred, then &quot;⊦q&quot; will occur if it is desired to put it on record. The process of the inference cannot be reduced to symbols. Its sole record is the occurrence of &quot;⊦q&quot;. ... An inference is the dropping of a true premiss; it is the dissolution of an implication&quot;.

In other words, in a long &quot;string&quot; of inferences, after each inference we can detach the &quot;consequent&quot; &quot;⊦q&quot; from the symbol string &quot;⊦p, ⊦(p⊃q)&quot; and not carry these symbols forward in an ever-lengthening string of symbols. 
The three traditional &quot;laws&quot; (principles) of thought: Russell goes on to assert other principles, of which the above logical principle is &quot;only one&quot;. He asserts that &quot;some of these must be granted before any argument or proof becomes possible. When some of them have been granted, others can be proved.&quot; Of these various &quot;laws&quot; he asserts that &quot;for no very good reason, three of these principles have been singled out by tradition under the name of &#x27;Laws of Thought&#x27;. And these he lists as follows:
: &quot;(1) &quot;The law of identity&quot;: &#x27;Whatever is, is.&#x27;
: (2) &quot;The law of contradiction&quot;: &#x27;Nothing can both be and not be.&#x27;
: (3) &quot;The law of excluded middle&quot;: &#x27;Everything must either be or not be.&#x27;&quot;

Rationale: Russell opines that &quot;the name &#x27;laws of thought&#x27; is ... misleading, for what is important is not the fact that we think in accordance with these laws, but the fact that things behave in accordance with them; in other words, the fact that when we think in accordance with them we think &quot;truly&quot;.&quot; But he rates this a &quot;large question&quot; and expands it in two following chapters where he begins with an investigation of the notion of &quot;a priori&quot; (innate, built-in) knowledge, and ultimately arrives at his acceptance of the Platonic &quot;world of universals&quot;. In his investigation he comes back now and then to the three traditional laws of thought, singling out the law of contradiction in particular: &quot;The conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law of &quot;thought&quot; is nevertheless erroneous ... [rather], the law of contradiction is about things, and not merely about thoughts ... a fact concerning the things in the world.&quot;

His argument begins with the statement that the three traditional laws of thought are &quot;samples of self-evident principles&quot;. For Russell the matter of &quot;self-evident&quot; merely introduces the larger question of how we derive our knowledge of the world. He cites the &quot;historic controversy ... between the two schools called respectively &#x27;empiricists&#x27; [ Locke, Berkeley, and Hume ] and &#x27;rationalists&#x27; [ Descartes and Leibniz]&quot; (these philosophers are his examples). Russell asserts that the rationalists &quot;maintained that, in addition to what we know by experience, there are certain &#x27;innate ideas&#x27; and &#x27;innate principles&#x27;, which we know independently of experience&quot;; to eliminate the possibility of babies having innate knowledge of the &quot;laws of thought&quot;, Russell renames this sort of knowledge &quot;a priori&quot;. And while Russell agrees with the empiricists that &quot;Nothing can be known to &quot;exist&quot; except by the help of experience&quot;, he also agrees with the rationalists that some knowledge is &quot;a priori&quot;, specifically &quot;the propositions of logic and pure mathematics, as well as the fundamental propositions of ethics&quot;.

This question of how such &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge can exist directs Russell to an investigation into the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, which after careful consideration he rejects as follows:
:&quot;... there is one main objection which seems fatal to any attempt to deal with the problem of &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge by his method. The thing to be accounted for is our certainty that the facts must always conform to logic and arithmetic. ... Thus Kant&#x27;s solution unduly limits the scope of &quot;a priori&quot; propositions, in addition to failing in the attempt at explaining their certainty&quot;.

His objections to Kant then leads Russell to accept the &#x27;theory of ideas&#x27; of Plato, &quot;in my opinion ... one of the most successful attempts hitherto made.&quot;; he asserts that &quot; ... we must examine our knowledge of universals ... where we shall find that [this consideration] solves the problem of &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge.&quot;.

=== &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (Part I: 1910 first edition, 1927 2nd edition) ===
Unfortunately, Russell&#x27;s &quot;Problems&quot; does not offer an example of a &quot;minimum set&quot; of principles that would apply to human reasoning, both inductive and deductive. But &quot;PM&quot; does at least provide &quot;an&quot; example set (but not the minimum; see Post below) that is sufficient for &quot;deductive&quot; reasoning by means of the propositional calculus (as opposed to reasoning by means of the more-complicated predicate calculus)—a total of 8 principles at the start of &quot;Part I: Mathematical Logic&quot;. Each of the formulas :❋1.2 to :❋1.6 is a tautology (true no matter what the truth-value of p, q, r ... is). What is missing in &quot;PM&quot;’s treatment is a formal rule of substitution; in his 1921 PhD thesis Emil Post fixes this deficiency (see Post below). In what follows the formulas are written in a more modern format than that used in &quot;PM&quot;; the names are given in &quot;PM&quot;). 
:❋1.1 Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true.
:❋1.2 Principle of Tautology: (p ⋁ p) ⊃ p
:❋1.3 Principle of [logical] Addition: q ⊃ (p ⋁ q)
:❋1.4 Principle of Permutation: (p ⋁ q) ⊃ (q ⋁ p)
:❋1.5 Associative Principle: p ⋁ (q ⋁ r) ⊃ q ⋁ (p ⋁ r) [&quot;redundant&quot;]
:❋1.6 Principle of [logical] Summation: (q ⊃ r) ⊃ ((p ⋁ q) ⊃ (p ⋁ r))
:❋1.7 [logical NOT]: If p is an elementary proposition, ~p is an elementary proposition.
:❋1.71 [logical inclusive OR]: If p and q are elementary propositions, (p ⋁ q) is an elementary proposition.
Russell sums up these principles with &quot;This completes the list of primitive propositions required for the theory of deduction as applied to elementary propositions&quot; (PM:97).

Starting from these eight tautologies and a tacit use of the &quot;rule&quot; of substitution, &quot;PM&quot; then derives over a hundred different formulas, among which are the Law of Excluded Middle ❋1.71, and the Law of Contradiction ❋3.24 (this latter requiring a definition of logical AND symbolized by the modern ⋀: (p ⋀ q) =def ~(~p ⋁ ~q). (&quot;PM&quot; uses the &quot;dot&quot; symbol ▪ for logical AND)).

==Ladd-Franklin (1914): &quot;principle of exclusion&quot; and the &quot;principle of exhaustion&quot;==
At about the same time (1912) that Russell and Whitehead were finishing the last volume of their Principia Mathematica, and the publishing of Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Problems of Philosophy&quot; at least two logicians (Louis Couturat, Christine Ladd-Franklin) were asserting that two &quot;laws&quot; (principles) of contradiction&quot; and &quot;excluded middle&quot; are necessary to specify &quot;contradictories&quot;; Ladd-Franklin renamed these the principles of exclusion and exhaustion. The following appears as a footnote on page 23 of Couturat 1914:
:&quot;As Mrs. LADD·FRANKLlN has truly remarked (BALDWIN, Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, article &quot;Laws of Thought&quot;), the principle of contradiction is not sufficient to define contradictories; the principle of excluded middle must be added which equally deserves the name of principle of contradiction. This is why Mrs. LADD-FRANKLIN proposes to call them respectively the principle of exclusion and the principle of exhaustion, inasmuch as, according to the first, two contradictory terms are exclusive (the one of the other); and, according to the second, they are exhaustive (of the universe of discourse).&quot;

In other words, the creation of &quot;contradictories&quot; represents a dichotomy, i.e. the &quot;splitting&quot; of a universe of discourse into two classes (collections) that have the following two properties: they are (i) mutually exclusive and (ii) (collectively) exhaustive. In other words, no one thing (drawn from the universe of discourse) can simultaneously be a member of both classes (law of non-contradiction), &quot;but&quot; [and] every single thing (in the universe of discourse) must be a member of one class or the other (law of excluded middle).

==Post (1921): The propositional calculus is consistent and complete==
As part of his PhD thesis &quot;Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions&quot; Emil Post proved &quot;the system of elementary propositions of Principia [PM]&quot; i.e. its &quot;propositional calculus&quot; described by PM&#x27;s first 8 &quot;primitive propositions&quot; to be &quot;consistent&quot;. The definition of &quot;consistent&quot; is this: that by means of the deductive &quot;system&quot; at hand (its stated axioms, laws, rules) it is impossible to derive (display) both a formula S and its contradictory ~S (i.e. its logical negation) (Nagel and Newman 1958:50). To demonstrate this formally, Post had to add a primitive proposition to the 8 primitive propositions of PM, a &quot;rule&quot; that specified the notion of &quot;substitution&quot; that was missing in the original PM of 1910.

Given PM&#x27;s tiny set of &quot;primitive propositions&quot; and the proof of their consistency, Post then proves that this system (&quot;propositional calculus&quot; of PM) is &quot;complete&quot;, meaning every possible truth table can be generated in the &quot;system&quot;:
:&quot;...every truth system has a representation in the system of Principia while every complete system, that is one having all possible truth tables, is equivalent to it. ... We thus see that complete systems are equivalent to the system of &quot;Principia&quot; not only in the truth table development but also postulationally. As other systems are in a sense degenerate forms of complete systems we can conclude that no new logical systems are introduced.&quot;

===A minimum set of axioms? The matter of their independence===
Then there is the matter of &quot;independence&quot; of the axioms. In his commentary before Post 1921, van Heijenoort states that Paul Bernays solved the matter in 1918 (but published in 1926) – the formula ❋1.5 Associative Principle: p ⋁ (q ⋁ r) ⊃ q ⋁ (p ⋁ r) can be proved with the other four. As to what system of &quot;primitive-propositions&quot; is the minimum, van Heijenoort states that the matter was &quot;investigated by Zylinski (1925), Post himself (1941), and Wernick (1942)&quot; but van Heijenoort does not answer the question.

=== Model theory versus proof theory: Post&#x27;s proof ===
Kleene (1967:33) observes that &quot;logic&quot; can be &quot;founded&quot; in two ways, first as a &quot;model theory&quot;, or second by a formal &quot;proof&quot; or &quot;axiomatic theory&quot;; &quot;the two formulations, that of model theory and that of proof theory, give equivalent results&quot;(Kleene 1967:33). This foundational choice, and their equivalence also applies to &quot;predicate logic&quot; (Kleene 1967:318). 
In his introduction to Post 1921, van Heijenoort observes that both the &quot;truth-table and the axiomatic approaches are clearly presented&quot;. This matter of a proof of consistency both ways (by a model theory, by axiomatic proof theory) comes up in the more-congenial version of Post&#x27;s consistency proof that can be found in Nagel and Newman 1958 in their chapter V &quot;An Example of a Successful Absolute Proof of Consistency&quot;. In the main body of the text they use a model to achieve their consistency proof (they also state that the system is complete but do not offer a proof) (Nagel &amp; Newman 1958:45–56). But their text promises the reader a proof that is axiomatic rather than relying on a model, and in the Appendix they deliver this proof based on the notions of a division of formulas into two classes K1 and K2 that are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (Nagel &amp; Newman 1958:109–113).
==Gödel (1930): The first-order predicate calculus is complete==
The (restricted) &quot;first-order predicate calculus&quot; is the &quot;system of logic&quot; that adds to the propositional logic (cf Post, above) the notion of &quot;subject-predicate&quot; i.e. the subject x is drawn from a domain (universe) of discourse and the predicate is a logical function f(x): x as subject and f(x) as predicate (Kleene 1967:74). Although Gödel&#x27;s proof involves the same notion of &quot;completeness&quot; as does the proof of Post, Gödel&#x27;s proof is far more difficult; what follows is a discussion of the axiom set.

=== Completeness ===
Kurt Gödel in his 1930 doctoral dissertation &quot;The completeness of the axioms of the functional calculus of logic&quot; proved that in this &quot;calculus&quot; (i.e. restricted predicate logic with or without equality) that every valid formula is &quot;either refutable or satisfiable&quot; or what amounts to the same thing: every valid formula is provable and therefore the logic is complete. Here is Gödel&#x27;s definition of whether or not the &quot;restricted functional calculus&quot; is &quot;complete&quot;:
:&quot;... whether it actually suffices for the derivation of &quot;every&quot; logico-mathematical proposition, or where, perhaps, it is conceivable that there are true propositions (which may be provable by means of other principles) that cannot be derived in the system under consideration.&quot;

===The first-order predicate calculus===
This particular predicate calculus is &quot;restricted to the first order&quot;. To the propositional calculus it adds two special symbols that symbolize the generalizations &quot;for all&quot; and &quot;there exists (at least one)&quot; that extend over the domain of discourse. The calculus requires only the first notion &quot;for all&quot;, but typically includes both: (1) the notion &quot;for all x&quot; or &quot;for every x&quot; is symbolized in the literature as variously as (x), ∀x, Πx etc., and the (2) notion of &quot;there exists (at least one x)&quot; variously symbolized as Ex, ∃x.

The restriction is that the generalization &quot;for all&quot; applies only to the &quot;variables&quot; (objects x, y, z etc. drawn from the domain of discourse) and not to functions, in other words the calculus will permit ∀xf(x) (&quot;for all creatures x, x is a bird&quot;) but not ∀f∀x(f(x)) [but if &quot;equality&quot; is added to the calculus it will permit ∀f:f(x); see below under Tarski]. Example:
: Let the predicate &quot;function&quot; f(x) be &quot;x is a mammal&quot;, and the subject-domain (or universe of discourse) (cf Kleene 1967:84) be the category &quot;bats&quot;:
: The formula ∀xf(x) yields the truth value &quot;truth&quot; (read: &quot;For all instances x of objects &#x27;bats&#x27;, &#x27;x is a mammal&#x27;&quot; is a truth, i.e. &quot;All bats are mammals&quot;); 
: But if the instances of x are drawn from a domain &quot;winged creatures&quot; then ∀xf(x) yields the truth value &quot;false&quot; (i.e. &quot;For all instances x of &#x27;winged creatures&#x27;, &#x27;x is a mammal&#x27;&quot; has a truth value of &quot;falsity&quot;; &quot;Flying insects are mammals&quot; is false);
: However over the broad domain of discourse &quot;all winged creatures&quot; (e.g. &quot;birds&quot; + &quot;flying insects&quot; + &quot;flying squirrels&quot; + &quot;bats&quot;) we &quot;can&quot; assert ∃xf(x) (read: &quot;There exists at least one winged creature that is a mammal&#x27;&quot;; it yields a truth value of &quot;truth&quot; because the objects x can come from the category &quot;bats&quot; and perhaps &quot;flying squirrels&quot; (depending on how we define &quot;winged&quot;). But the formula yields &quot;falsity&quot; when the domain of discourse is restricted to &quot;flying insects&quot; or &quot;birds&quot; or both &quot;insects&quot; and &quot;birds&quot;.

Kleene remarks that &quot;the predicate calculus (without or with equality) fully accomplishes (for first order theories) what has been conceived to be the role of logic&quot; (Kleene 1967:322).

===A new axiom: Aristotle&#x27;s dictum – &quot;the maxim of all and none&quot; ===
This first half of this axiom – &quot;the maxim of all&quot; will appear as the first of two additional axioms in Gödel&#x27;s axiom set. The &quot;dictum of Aristotle&quot; (dictum de omni et nullo) is sometimes called &quot;the maxim of all and none&quot; but is really two &quot;maxims&quot; that assert: &quot;What is true of all (members of the domain) is true of some (members of the domain)&quot;, and &quot;What is not true of all (members of the domain) is true of none (of the members of the domain)&quot;.

The &quot;dictum&quot; appears in Boole 1854 a couple places:
:&quot;It may be a question whether that formula of reasoning, which is called the dictum of Aristotle, &quot;de Omni et nullo&quot;, expresses a primary law of human reasoning or not; but it is no question that it expresses a general truth in Logic&quot; (1854:4)

But later he seems to argue against it:
:&quot;[Some principles of] general principle of an axiomatic nature, such as the &quot;dictum of Aristotle:&quot; Whatsoever is affirmed or denied of the genus may in the same sense be affirmed or denied of any species included under that genus. ... either state directly, but in an abstract form, the argument which they are supposed to elucidate, and, so stating that argument, affirm its validity; or involve in their expression technical terms which, after definition, conduct us again to the same point, viz. the abstract statement of the supposed allowable forms of inference.&quot;

But the first half of this &quot;dictum&quot; (&quot;dictum de omni&quot;) is taken up by Russell and Whitehead in PM, and by Hilbert in his version (1927) of the &quot;first order predicate logic&quot;; his (system) includes a principle that Hilbert calls &quot;Aristotle&#x27;s dictum&quot; 
:(x)f(x) → f(y)

This axiom also appears in the modern axiom set offered by Kleene (Kleene 1967:387), as his &quot;∀-schema&quot;, one of two axioms (he calls them &quot;postulates&quot;) required for the predicate calculus; the other being the &quot;∃-schema&quot; f(y) ⊃ ∃xf(x) that reasons from the particular f(y) to the existence of at least one subject x that satisfies the predicate f(x); both of these requires adherence to a defined domain (universe) of discourse.

=== Gödel&#x27;s restricted predicate calculus ===
To supplement the four (down from five; see Post) axioms of the propositional calculus, Gödel 1930 adds the &quot;dictum de omni&quot; as the first of two additional axioms. Both this &quot;dictum&quot; and the second axiom, he claims in a footnote, derive from &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;. Indeed, PM includes both as
:❋10.1 ⊦ ∀xf(x) ⊃ f(y) [&quot;I.e. what is true in all cases is true in any one case&quot; (&quot;Aristotle&#x27;s dictum&quot;, rewritten in more-modern symbols)]
:❋10.2 ⊦∀x(p ⋁ f(x)) ⊃ (p ⋁ ∀xf(x)) [rewritten in more-modern symbols]
The latter asserts that the logical sum (i.e. ⋁, OR) of a simple proposition p and a predicate ∀xf(x) implies the logical sum of each separately. But PM derives both of these from six primitive propositions of ❋9, which in the second edition of PM is discarded and replaced with four new &quot;Pp&quot; (primitive principles) of ❋8 (see in particular ❋8.2, and Hilbert derives the first from his &quot;logical ε-axiom&quot; in his 1927 and does not mention the second. How Hilbert and Gödel came to adopt these two as axioms is unclear.

Also required are two more &quot;rules&quot; of detachment (&quot;modus ponens&quot;) applicable to predicates.

==Tarski (1946): Leibniz&#x27;s law==
Alfred Tarski in his 1946 (2nd edition) &quot;Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences&quot; cites a number of what he deems &quot;universal laws&quot; of the sentential calculus, three &quot;rules&quot; of inference, and one fundamental law of identity (from which he derives four more laws). The traditional &quot;laws of thought&quot; are included in his long listing of &quot;laws&quot; and &quot;rules&quot;. His treatment is, as the title of his book suggests, limited to the &quot;Methodology of the Deductive Sciences&quot;.

Rationale: In his introduction (2nd edition) he observes that what began with an application of logic to mathematics has been widened to &quot;the whole of human knowledge&quot;: 
:&quot;[I want to present] a clear idea of that powerful trend of contemporary thought which is concentrated about modern logic. This trend arose originally from the somewhat limited task of stabilizing the foundations of mathematics. In its present phase, however, it has much wider aims. For it seeks to create a unified conceptual apparatus which would supply a common basis for the whole of human knowledge.&quot;.
===Law of identity (Leibniz&#x27;s law, equality)===
To add the notion of &quot;equality&quot; to the &quot;propositional calculus&quot; (this new notion not to be confused with &quot;logical&quot; equivalence symbolized by ↔, ⇄, &quot;if and only if (iff)&quot;, &quot;biconditional&quot;, etc.) Tarski (cf p54-57) symbolizes what he calls &quot;Leibniz&#x27;s law&quot; with the symbol &quot;=&quot;. This extends the domain (universe) of discourse and the types of functions to numbers and mathematical formulas (Kleene 1967:148ff, Tarski 1946:54ff).

In a nutshell: given that &quot;x has every property that y has&quot;, we can write &quot;x = y&quot;, and this formula will have a truth value of &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;falsity&quot;. Tarski states this Leibniz&#x27;s law as follows:
* I. Leibniz&#x27; Law: x = y, if, and only if, x has every property which y has, and y has every property which x has.
He then derives some other &quot;laws&quot; from this law: 
* II. Law of Reflexivity: Everything is equal to itself: x = x. [Proven at PM ❋13.15]
* III. Law of Symmetry: If x = y, then y = x. [Proven at PM ❋13.16]
* IV. Law of Transitivity: If x = y and y = z, then x = z. [Proven at PM ❋13.17]
* V. If x = z and y = z, then x = y. [Proven at PM ❋13.172]

Principia Mathematica &quot;defines&quot; the notion of equality as follows (in modern symbols); note that the generalization &quot;for all&quot; extends over predicate-functions f( ):
:❋13.01. x = y =def ∀f:(f(x) → f(y)) (&quot;This definition states that x and y are to be called identical when every predicate function satisfied by x is satisfied by y&quot;

Hilbert 1927:467 adds only two axioms of equality, the first is x = x, the second is (x = y) → ((f(x) → f(y)); the &quot;for all f&quot; is missing (or implied). Gödel 1930 defines equality similarly to PM :❋13.01. Kleene 1967 adopts the two from Hilbert 1927 plus two more (Kleene 1967:387).

== George Spencer-Brown (1969): Laws of Form ==
George Spencer-Brown in his 1969 &quot;Laws of Form&quot; (LoF) begins by first taking as given that &quot;we cannot make an indication without drawing a distinction&quot;. This, therefore, presupposes the law of excluded middle. He then goes on to define two axioms, which describe how distinctions (a &quot;boundary&quot;) and indications (a &quot;call&quot;) work:
* Axiom 1. The law of calling: The value of a call made again is the value of the call.
* Axiom 2. The law of crossing: The value of a (boundary) crossing made again is not the value of the crossing.
These axioms bear a resemblance to the &quot;law of identity&quot; and the &quot;law of non-contradiction&quot; respectively. However, the law of identity is proven as a theorem (Theorem 4.5 in &quot;Laws of Form&quot;) within the framework of LoF. In general, LoF can be reinterpreted as First-order logic, propositional logic, and second-order logic by assigning specific interpretations to the symbols and values of LoF.

== Contemporary developments ==
All of the above &quot;systems of logic&quot; are considered to be &quot;classical&quot; meaning propositions and predicate expressions are two-valued, with either the truth value &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;falsity&quot; but not both(Kleene 1967:8 and 83). While intuitionistic logic falls into the &quot;classical&quot; category, it objects to extending the &quot;for all&quot; operator to the Law of Excluded Middle; it allows instances of the &quot;Law&quot;, but not its generalization to an infinite domain of discourse.

=== Intuitionistic logic ===
&#x27;Intuitionistic logic&#x27;, sometimes more generally called constructive logic, refers to systems of symbolic logic that differ from the systems used for classical logic by more closely mirroring the notion of constructive proof. In particular, systems of intuitionistic logic do not assume the law of the excluded middle and double negation elimination, which are fundamental inference rules in classical logic.

=== Paraconsistent logic ===
&#x27;Paraconsistent logic&#x27; refers to so-called contradiction-tolerant logical systems in which a contradiction does not necessarily result in trivialism. In other words, the principle of explosion is not valid in such logics. Some (namely the dialetheists) argue that the law of non-contradiction is denied by dialetheic logic. They are motivated by certain paradoxes which seem to imply a limit of the law of non-contradiction, namely the liar paradox. In order to avoid a trivial logical system and still allow certain contradictions to be true, dialetheists will employ a paraconsistent logic of some kind.

A Ternary Arithmetic and Logic – Semantic Scholar

=== Modal propositional calculi ===
(cf Kleene 1967:49): These &quot;calculi&quot; include the symbols ⎕A, meaning &quot;A is necessary&quot; and ◊A meaning &quot;A is possible&quot;. Kleene states that:
:&quot;These notions enter in domains of thinking where there are understood to be two different kinds of &quot;truth&quot;, one more universal or compelling than the other ... A zoologist might declare that it is impossible that salamanders or any other living creatures can survive fire; but possible (though untrue) that unicorns exist, and possible (though improbable) that abominable snowmen exist.&quot;

=== Fuzzy logic ===

&#x27;Fuzzy logic&#x27; is a form of many-valued logic; it deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact.

<text>Tetanurae (/ˌtɛtəˈnjuːriː/ or &quot;stiff tails&quot;) is a clade that includes most theropod dinosaurs, including megalosauroids, allosauroids, and coelurosaurs (which includes tyrannosauroids, ornithomimosaurs, compsognathids and maniraptorans, the latter including living birds). Tetanurans are defined as all theropods more closely related to modern birds than to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and contain the majority of predatory dinosaur diversity. Tetanurae likely diverged from its sister group, Ceratosauria, during the late Triassic. Tetanurae first appeared in the fossil record by the Early Jurassic about 190 mya and by the Middle Jurassic had become globally distributed.

The group was named by Jacques Gauthier in 1986 and originally had two main subgroups: Carnosauria and Coelurosauria, the clade containing birds and related dinosaurs such as compsognathids, tyrannosaurids, ornithomimosaurs, and maniraptorans. The original Carnosauria was a polyphyletic group including any large carnivorous theropod. Many of Gauthier&#x27;s carnosaurs, such as tyrannosaurids, have since been re-classified as coelurosaurs or primitive tetanurans. Carnosauria has been reclassified as a group containing allosaurids that split from the Coelurosauria at the Neotetanurae/Avetheropoda node. Members of Megalosauroidea are believed to represent basal tetanurans, but recent discoveries have shown that they might be members of Carnosauria expanding Carnosauria back to its original meaning. It is however agreed that Megalosauroids, Allosauroids and Coelurosaurians are all members of the Orionides, a subset within Tetanurae that contains dinosaurs more derived than animals such as Chuandongcoelurus and Kayentavenator.

Tetanuran evolution was characterized by parallel diversification of multiple lineages, repeatedly attaining large body size and similar locomotor morphology. &quot;Cryolophosaurus&quot; has been claimed as the first true member of the group, but subsequent studies have disagreed on whether it is a dilophosaurid or tetanuran. Arcucci and Coria (2003) classified &quot;Zupaysaurus&quot; as an early tetanuran, but it was later placed as a sister taxon to the clade containing dilophosaurids, ceratosaurs, and tetanurans.

Shared tetanuran features include a ribcage indicating a sophisticated air-sac-ventilated lung system similar to that in modern birds. This character would have been accompanied by an advanced circulatory system. Other tetanuran characterizing features include the absence of the fourth digit of the hand, placement of the maxillary teeth anterior to the orbit, a strap-like scapula, maxillary fenestrae, and stiffened tails. During the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, large spinosaurids and allosaurs flourished but possibly died out in the northern hemisphere before the end of the Cretaceous, and were replaced as apex predators by tyrannosauroid coelurosaurs. At least in South America, carcharodontosaurid allosaurs may have persisted until the end of the Mesozoic Era, and died out at the same time as the non-avian coelurosaurs.

==Morphology==
===Anatomy===
Tetanurans have two basic skull morphologies. The first skull type, typical in large theropods such as &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, is common within ceratosaurs and may be primitive for tetanurans. In this type, the skull is about three times longer than tall, with a blunter snout and frequent elaborations such as horns or spikes along the lacrimals, nasals, and frontals. In the second skull type, the skull is lower and longer, with a less elaborated skull roof and a more elongated snout. Shared tetanuran features include the maxillary fenestra (an opening in the antorbital fossa), a pneumatic excavation in the jugal, and the position of the maxillary teeth anterior to the orbit. The posterior skull is little modified in tetanurans, except within Spinosauridae. The presence of an antorbital tooth row in tetanurans may be associated with macropredatory habits. 

In the postcranial skeleton, tetanurans transition between the most primitive theropod morphologies in basal tetanurans towards more derived, bird-like states in coelurosaurs. Most tetanurans possess specialized wrist bones, the absence or reduction of the fourth digit of the hand, a strap-like scapula, stiffened tails, and a laminar astragalar ascending process. Advanced tetanurans would have possessed a sophisticated air-sac-ventilated lung system similar to birds, and an advanced circulatory system. In megalosaurids and allosaurids, the orientation of the femoral head is anteromedial such as in ceratosaurs, but in avetheropods this orientation is fully medial. Tetanuran locomotor morphology is relatively generalized, with few variations between taxa.

The hands of tetanurans, unlike those of the closely related ceratosaurs, lack a fourth finger. Early tetanurans still possessed metacarpal IV, but it was vestigial and not part of a finger anymore. The tridactyl manus was preserved in birds. Evidence from the basal ceratosaur &quot;Saltriovenator&quot; indicates the tetanuran digits are I, II and III instead of II, III and IV.

===Body Size===
Basal tetanurans were the first theropods to achieve truly giant body sizes, with both megalosauroid and allosauroid taxa weighing over 1 ton. Sequential temporal appearances of large body size in subsequent clades suggest a pattern of size-cycles, with the extinction of incumbent giant forms allowing for replacement with a new, more bird-like theropod group that then also evolved giant body size. It is, however, possible that more than one giant tetanuran existed at a time in the same paleoenvironment, perhaps with feeding habit variations. Within most dinosaur clades, body size tended to increase over time along a lineage according to Cope&#x27;s rule. Coelurosaurian theropods are the notable exception to the pattern of body size increases.

==History of study==

===History of classification===
Tetanurae was recognized and named by Gauthier in 1986. The earliest-discovered non-avian tetanuran is &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. For a century after the description of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, most large carnivorous dinosaurs were serially arrayed into the family Megalosauridae within the order Theropoda. In 1914, Friedrich von Huene separated small, lightly built forms into the infraorder Coelurosauria and larger taxa into the infraorder Pachypodosauria. Later, he transferred large, carnivorous taxa to the new infraorder Carnosauria, which came to include all known large-bodied carnivores other than &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. The size-based arrangement persisted until Gauthier, who redefined Carnosauria and Coelurosauria based on new cladistic analyses but retained the terms. Gauthier defined Coelurosauria as a taxon comprising birds and theropods closer to birds than to Carnosauria, and listed within Carnosauria several large-bodied theropod taxa but did not formally define the group. Many of these original carnosaurs have since been reclassified as coelurosaurs or primitive tetanurans, and Carnosauria has now been defined as &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and all Avetheropods closer to &quot;Allosaurus&quot; than to birds.

Initial cladistics studies supported the arrangement of primitive megalosaurs as serial outgroups to a clade of allosaurids, followed by the Coelurosauria. Subsequent studies have discovered that many of these basal tetanurans formed a true clade, termed Megalosauroidea or alternatively Spinosauroidea.

===Current phylogeny===
Current phylogeny agrees on a monophyletic Tetanurae that includes a series of generally large-bodied basal taxa outside a monophyletic Coelurosauria. Coelophysoids are basal to Tetanurae, with Ceratosauria forming a sister taxa that diverged during the late Triassic.

After their initial appearance, Tetanurae radiated into two main clades, Spinosauroidea or Megalosauroidea and Avetheropoda or Neotetanurae. Spinosauroidea are believed to represent basal Tetanurans. At the Neotetanurae/Avetheropoda node, allosaurids split from the Coelurosauria. Tyrannosauridae has been placed within Coelurosauria. The allosaurids and their closest relatives form a reconstituted Carnosauria. Debate persists about whether the allosaurids form a clade with spinosauroids/megalosauroids, and whether Allosauroidea belongs in Avetheropoda with Coelurosauria or forms a sister taxa to Megalosauroidea, and whether Megalosauroidea forms a valid clade.

Although many phylogenetic analyses found basal tetanurans that were outside both Megalosauroidea and Avetheropoda, the core dichotomy was named only in 2012. Carrano, Benson and Sampson (2012) named that clade Orionides, and defined it as the node comprising Megalosauroidea, Avetheropoda, their most recent common ancestor, and all its descendants. In 2015, Hendrickx, Hartman and Mateus clarified this definition, specifying it as the least inclusive clade including &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;, &quot;Megalosaurus bucklandii&quot;, and &quot;Passer domesticus&quot;. 

The clade name &quot;Orionides&quot; was first established by Matthew T. Carrano, Roger B. J. Benson and Scott D. Sampson in 2012. It is derived from Orion, the giant hunter of Greek mythology in references to the large size and carnivorism of basal orionidans. The name also refers to the alternative name for the constellation of Orion, Alektropodion, meaning &quot;rooster foot&quot;.

The smaller clade, Avetheropoda was named by Gregory S. Paul in 1988, and was first defined as a clade by Currie and Padian in 1997, to include &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, modern birds, and other animals descended from their most recent ancestor. In 1999, Paul Sereno named another group, Neotetanurae, for the clade containing Allosauroidea and Coelurosauria, and excluding other tetanurans such as megalosauroids, but this definition was published slightly later.
A monophyletic Avetheropoda is recovered in many papers; however, recent findings suggest a monophyletic Carnosauria model with allosauroids and megalosauroids as each other&#x27;s closest relatives instead of Allosauroids and Coelurosaurs.

The cladogram presented below follows a phylogenetic analysis published by Zanno and Makovicky in 2013.
In 2019, Rauhut and Pol described &quot;Asfaltovenator vialidadi&quot;, a basal allosauroid displaying a mosaic of primitive and derived features seen within Tetanurae. Their phylogenetic analysis found traditional Megalosauroidea to represent a basal grade of carnosaurs, paraphyletic with respect to Allosauroidea.

==Paleobiology==

===Biogeography===
The biogeographical history of non-avian Tetanurae spans over 110 million years and all continents. The presence of major lineages prior to the breakup of Pangaea implies wide dispersal of these clades, with later absences indicating regional extinctions or dispersal failure. The density of sampling is currently insufficient to provide a detailed analysis of biogeographical evolution for the Tetanurae.

===Diversity===
Tetanurae and Ceratosauria likely diverged during the late Triassic, more than 200 mya. By the Early Jurassic, Tetanurae fossils appear in the fossil record and reached global distribution by the Middle Jurassic. In the Late Jurassic, the fossil record demonstrates widespread presence of multiple clades within both megalosauroids and avetheropods. The Megalosauroidea contained high diversity with two Jurassic clades, Piatnitzkysauridae and Megalosauridae, as well as the Cretaceous Spinosauridae. Tetanuran evolution appears to exhibit waves of diversification, although this may be due to uneven sampling. During the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, large spinosaurids and allosaurids flourished, but the latter possibly died out before the end of the Cretaceous due to the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event, while spinosaurids are known from the Santonian. Soon afterwards the niche of terrestrial apex predator was filled by ceratosaurs and tyrannosaurids, which dominated terminal Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems. Coelurosaurs persisted through the end of the Mesozoic Era. Modern birds are the only living representatives of the Tetanurae.

<doc id="1252321" wikidata="Q1427816" url="?curid=1252321" title="Madrugada (band)">
<text>Madrugada is a Norwegian alternative rock band formed in the town of Stokmarknes in 1993. Its key members have included Sivert Høyem (vocals), Robert Burås (guitar), and Frode Jacobsen (bass). After Burås&#x27; death on 12 July 2007, Høyem and Jacobsen decided to finish recording what was to be their final album in the original lineup. On 21 January 2008, the band released &quot;Madrugada&quot; and announced that they would split after one last tour. They performed their final concert on 15 November 2008.

In June 2018, it was announced that Høyem, Jacobsen, and Lauvland Pettersen had reformed the band for a series of shows in 2019.

According to Anders Kaasen of Allmusic, the band was noted for &quot;its bareboned blues-inspired alt-rock&quot; at the end of the 1990s.

==Name==
The word &quot;madrugada&quot; means &quot;the period of time between midnight and sunrise&quot; in Portuguese and Spanish.

==History==
The group of musicians that would go on to become Madrugada formed in the town of Stokmarknes in 1993 under the name Abbeys Adoption. The band members at this time included Jon Lauvland Pettersen (drums), Frode Jacobsen (bass), Sivert Høyem (vocals), and Marius &#x27;Wah Wah&#x27; Johansen (guitar). In 1995, they were joined by guitarist Robert Burås and made the decision to move to Oslo, after which Johansen departed. By 1998, the band had been signed to a six-album deal by Virgin Music Norway, and after a chance meeting with Norwegian author and poet Øystein Wingaard Wolf in a bar, changed their name to Madrugada.

Their debut album, &quot;Industrial Silence&quot;, was released on 30 August 1999 to critical acclaim and was followed by &quot;The Nightly Disease&quot;, in 2001.

After personal relations became fraught, Pettersen left the band in early 2002 and was replaced by Simen Vangen. Soon afterwards, work began on a third album, &quot;Grit&quot;.

Madrugada finished working on their fourth album, &quot;The Deep End&quot;, in late 2004. Recorded at Sound City in Los Angeles with producer George Drakoulias, it was released on 28 February 2005 in Norway, on 31 March in the rest of Europe, and finally in the US on 11 April. The lead single &quot;The Kids Are on High Street&quot; was released for domestic radio play on 14 January, and a music video was filmed in London. Vangen announced his departure in early 2005, stating that he wished to focus on various jazz-related projects, leaving the band without a permanent drummer.

On 14 December 2005, Madrugada released the album &quot;Live at Tralfamadore&quot;, (named after the fictional home planet of aliens from several novels by American author Kurt Vonnegut). By the end of 2005 and less than a month after its release, it became the highest-selling album in Norway for that year, with &quot;The Deep End&quot; as the runner-up. The year was capped off with Madrugada winning three awards at the annual Spellemannprisen—the Norwegian equivalent of the Grammys. They won in the Best Rock Album, Best Song, and Spellemann of the Year categories.

Following this successful period, the band members focused on various side projects. Høyem released his second solo album, &quot;Exiles&quot;, in 2006, while Burås and his band My Midnight Creeps released their second album, &quot;Histamin&quot;, in March 2007.

The band reconvened in the spring of 2007 with &quot;Industrial Silence&quot;, &quot;Nightly Disease&quot;, and &quot;Histamin&quot; producer John Agnello to begin work on their fifth album, but on 12 July 2007, Robert Burås was found dead in his Oslo apartment; he was 31 years old.

Following the release of the new single &quot;Look Away Lucifer&quot;, on 10 December 2007, the band&#x27;s final, self-titled album was eventually published on 21 January 2008. The majority of guitar tracks had been recorded before Burås&#x27; death.

In the spring of 2008, joined by My Midnight Creeps guitarist Alex Kloster-Jensen and friend of the band Cato Thomassen, Madrugada embarked on a tour throughout Europe.

In 2010, a career spanning double album was released, entitled &quot;The Best of Madrugada&quot;. It included one new track, &quot;All This Wanting to Be Free&quot;.

On 15 June 2018, it was announced via the band&#x27;s Facebook page that Madrugada had reunited with original drummer Jon Lauvland Pettersen, and a 2019 European tour was planned.

<text>Sean O&#x27;Callaghan (10 October 1954 – 23 August 2017) was a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), who from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s worked against the organisation from within as a mole for the Irish Government with the Garda Síochána&#x27;s Special Branch.

In the mid-1980s he left the IRA and subsequently voluntarily surrendered to British prosecution for actions he had engaged in as an IRA gunman in the 1970s. Following his release from imprisonment, he published a memoir detailing his life in Irish Republican paramilitarism entitled &quot;The Informer: The True Life Story of One Man&#x27;s War on Terrorism&quot; (1998).

Former Irish Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald described O&#x27;Callaghan as one of the Irish Government&#x27;s most important spies operating within the Provisional IRA during the late 20th century&#x27;s The Troubles.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Callaghan was born on 26 January 1954, into a family with a Fenian paramilitary history, in Tralee, County Kerry. His paternal grandfather had taken the Anti-Treaty side during the Irish Civil War, and his father had been interned by the Irish Government at the Curragh Camp in County Kildare for IRA activity during World War II.

By the late 1960s, the teenaged O&#x27;Callaghan had ceased practising the Catholic faith, adopted atheism and had become interested in the theories of Marxist revolutionary politics, which found an outlet of practical expression in the sectarian social unrest in Northern Ireland at that time, centred on the activities of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. In 1969, an outbreak of communal violence broke out in Northern Ireland and believing that British imperialism was responsible, O&#x27;Callaghan joined the newly founded Provisional IRA at the age of 17.

Soon afterwards, he was arrested by local Gardaí after he accidentally detonated a small amount of explosives, which caused damage to the homes of his parents and their neighbours. After demanding, and receiving, treatment as a political prisoner, O&#x27;Callaghan quietly served his sentence.

==Provisional Irish Republican Army activity==
After becoming a full-time paramilitary with the IRA, in the early to mid 1970s O&#x27;Callaghan took part in over seventy operations associated with Irish Republican political violence including bomb materials manufacture, attacks on IRA targets in Northern Ireland, and robberies to provide funding for the organisation. On 2 May 1974 he was part of an attack by an IRA force on a 6th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) base at the village of Clogher in County Tyrone, with sustained automatic-rifle fire, anti-tank rockets, and rounds fired from an improvised mortar which was operated by O&#x27;Callaghan. During this attack a female UDR recruit was killed. On 23 August 1974 O&#x27;Callaghan killed Detective Inspector Peter Augustine Flanagan, a 47-year-old Catholic police officer and head of the Omagh Division of the Royal Ulster Constabulary&#x27;s Special Branch, by shooting him repeatedly with a handgun in a two-man IRA attack in a public house in the town of Omagh in County Tyrone.

==Irish Government agent within the IRA==
In 1976, aged 22, O&#x27;Callaghan ended his involvement with the IRA after becoming disillusioned with its activities. He later recalled that his disenchantment with the IRA began when one of his compatriots openly hoped that a female police officer who had been blown up by an IRA bomb had been pregnant so they could get &quot;two for the price of one.&quot; He was also concerned with what he perceived was an undercurrent of ethnic hatred in its rank and file towards the Ulster Scots population. He left Ireland and moved to London. In May 1978, he married a Scottish woman of Protestant unionist descent. During the late 1970s, he ran a successful mobile cleaning business. However, he was unable to fully settle in his new life, later recalling: &quot;In truth there seemed to be no escaping from Ireland. At the strangest of times I would find myself reliving the events of my years in the IRA. As the years went on, I came to believe that the Provisional IRA was the greatest enemy of democracy and decency in Ireland&quot;.

In 1979 O&#x27;Callaghan was approached by the IRA seeking to recruit him again for its paramilitary campaign. In response, he decided to turncoat against the organisation and become an agent within its ranks for the Irish Government. In his memoir, O&#x27;Callaghan described his reasoning as follows:

I had been brought up to believe that you had to take responsibility for your own actions. If you did something wrong then you made amends. I came to believe that individuals taking responsibility for their own actions is the basis for civilisation, without that safety net we have nothing.

O&#x27;Callaghan later told authors Kevin Cullen and Shelley Murphey that he decided to become a double agent even though he knew that even those who hated the IRA as much as he now did have a low opinion of informers; as he put it, &quot;there is nothing worse in Ireland than being an informer.&quot; However, he felt it was the only way to stop the IRA from luring teenagers into their ranks and training them to kill.

Soon after being approached by the IRA to re-join he returned to Tralee from London, where he arranged a clandestine meeting with an officer of the Garda Special Branch in a local cemetery, at which O&#x27;Callaghan expressed his willingness to work with it to subvert the IRA from within. At this point, O&#x27;Callaghan was still opposed to working with the British Government. A few weeks later, O&#x27;Callaghan made contact with Kerry IRA leader Martin Ferris and attended his first IRA meeting since 1975. Immediately afterwards, he telephoned his Garda contact and said, &quot;We&#x27;re in&quot;. According to O&#x27;Callaghan, &quot;Over the next few months plans to carry out various armed robberies were put together by the local IRA. It was relatively easy for me to foil these attempts; an occasional Garda car or roadblock at the &#x27;wrong time&#x27;; the routine arrest of Ferris or myself; or simple &#x27;bad planning&#x27;, such as a car arriving late – a whole series of random stratagems&quot;.

During the 1981 hunger strike in the Maze Prison, he attempted to start his own hunger strike in support of the Maze prisoners but was told to desist by the IRA for fear it would detract focus from the prisoners. O&#x27;Callaghan successfully sabotaged the efforts of republicans in Kerry from staging hunger strikes of their own.

In 1984 he notified the Garda of an attempt to smuggle seven tons of AK-47 assault rifles from the United States to Ireland aboard a fishing trawler named &quot;Valhalla.&quot; The guns were intended for the arsenal of the Provisional IRA&#x27;s units. The shipment had been organised by the Winter Hill Gang, an Irish-American crime family of South Boston, Massachusetts. As a result of O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s warning, a combined force of the Irish Navy and Gardaí intercepted the boat that received the weaponry, and the guns were seized. The seizure marked the complete end of any major attempt by the IRA to smuggle guns out of the United States, which ended three years earlier with the arrest of the primary IRA&#x27;s gunrunner George Harrison by the American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

O&#x27;Callaghan claimed to have been tasked in 1983 by the IRA with placing 25lb of Frangex in the Dominion Theatre in London, to try to kill Prince Charles and Princess Diana who were due to attend a charity pop music concert there. A warning was phoned into the Garda, and the Royal couple were hurriedly ushered from the theatre by their police bodyguard during the concert. The theatre had been searched before the concert and a second search following the warning revealed no device.

In 1985, O&#x27;Callaghan was elected as a Sinn Féin councillor for Tralee Urban District Council, and unsuccessfully contested a seat on Kerry County Council.

==Imprisonment==
After becoming disillusioned with his work with the Irish Government after the murder of another of its agents within the IRA (Sean Corcoran in County Kerry in 1985), which it had failed to prevent despite O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s warnings of the threat to him, and sensing a growing threat to himself from the organisation which had become suspicious of his own behaviour, O&#x27;Callaghan withdrew from the IRA and left Ireland to live in England, taking his wife and children with him. His marriage ended in a divorce in 1987, and on 29 November 1988 he walked into a police station in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, where, presenting himself to the officer on duty at the desk he confessed to the murder of UDR Greenfinch (female member) Eva Martin and the murder of D.I. Peter Flanagan during the mid-1970s, and voluntarily surrendered to British prosecution.

Although the Royal Ulster Constabulary offered him witness protection as part of the informer policy, O&#x27;Callaghan refused it, and was prosecuted under charges of two murders and 40 other crimes, to all of which he pled guilty, committed in British jurisdiction with the IRA. Having been found guilty he was jailed for a total of 539 years. O&#x27;Callaghan served his sentence in prisons in Northern Ireland and England. While in jail, he published his story in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. He was released after being granted the Royal Prerogative of Mercy by Queen Elizabeth II in 1996.

==Post-IRA life==
In 1998 O&#x27;Callaghan published an autobiographical account of his experiences in Irish Republican paramilitarism, entitled &quot;The Informer: The True Life Story of One Man&#x27;s War on Terrorism&quot; (1998). In the book&#x27;s text he stated (shortly before the death of Eamon Collins, another former IRA member who had prominently turned upon the organisation):

I know that the organisation led by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness would like to murder me. I know that that organisation will go on murdering other people until they are finally defeated. It is my belief that in spite of IRA/Sinn Féin&#x27;s strategic cunning, and no matter how many people they kill, the people of the Irish Republic expect, because they have been told so by John Hume, that there will be peace. There may come a time when their patience runs out. If that were to happen there would be no place for IRA/Sinn Féin to hide. We must work tirelessly to bring that day forward.

In 2002 he was admitted to The Nightingale Hospital, Marylebone, an addiction and rehab center where he underwent a rehabilitation program for alcohol dependency. His identity and past activities were not revealed to the other patients.
O&#x27;Callaghan lived relatively openly in London for the rest of his life, having refused to adopt a new identity. He was befriended in the city by the Irish writer Ruth Dudley Edwards, and worked as a security consultant, and also occasional advisor to the Ulster Unionist Party on how to handle Irish Republicanism in general, and Sinn Féin in particular.

In 2006, O&#x27;Callaghan appeared in a London court with regard to an aggravated robbery that had occurred in which he was the victim.

In 2015 O&#x27;Callaghan published &quot;James Connolly: My Search for the Man, the Myth &amp; his Legacy&quot; (2015), a book containing a critique of the early 20th century Irish revolutionary James Connolly, and what O&#x27;Callaghan considered to be his destructive legacy in Ireland&#x27;s contemporary politics.

==Death==
O&#x27;Callaghan died by drowning after suffering a heart attack at the age of 63 while in a swimming pool in Kingston, Jamaica in August 2017, while visiting his daughter, Tara. His death was reported on 23 August 2017. A memorial service was held in his memory on 21 March 2018 at St Martin&#x27;s in the Fields Church, in London, which was attended by representatives from Ulster Unionist parties and the Irish Government.

==Disputed claims of O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s accounts==
Sources in Sinn Féin have publicly denied aspects of the statements made by O&#x27;Callaghan with regard to his IRA career, particularly the claim that he had attained the leadership of the IRA&#x27;s Southern Command, and had been a delegate to the IRA Army Council, claims O&#x27;Callaghan made both in print and before a Dublin jury under oath. A 1997 article in &quot;An Phoblacht&quot; alleged that O&#x27;Callaghan &quot;has been forced to overstate his importance in the IRA, and to make increasingly outlandish accusations against individual republicans&quot;.

O&#x27;Callaghan also claimed to have attended an IRA finance meeting in Letterkenny in 1980 with, among others, lawyer Pat Finucane and Sinn Féin politician Gerry Adams. Following his death at the hands of Loyalist paramilitaries, Finucane&#x27;s family denied that he had been a member of the IRA, and the organisation did not claim or memorialise him as a member after the event. The RUC and the Stevens Report indicated that, to their knowledge he was not believed to have been an IRA member, although he came from an Irish Republican background and three of his brothers (Dermot, John, and Seamus) had been involved in paramilitarism. Adams repeatedly stated that, although associated closely with Irish Republican politics, he had never been a member of the IRA.

While O&#x27;Callaghan claimed to have quit being an informant after being disillusioned by the murder of Sean Corcoran, there remains suspicion that O&#x27;Callaghan may have been the perpetrator of Corcoran&#x27;s death. O&#x27;Callaghan once claimed that the IRA had ordered him to kill Corcoran and that he did so to protect his cover, but he later repudiated this claim, stating he had only admitted to the murder to trigger a police investigation.

<doc id="1252335" wikidata="Q214229" url="?curid=1252335" title="Peugeot 107">
<text>The Peugeot 107 is a city car produced by French automaker Peugeot, launched in June 2005, and produced until 2014.

The 107 was developed by the B-Zero project of PSA Peugeot Citroën in a joint venture with Toyota; the Citroën C1 and Toyota Aygo are badge engineered variants of each other, the Aygo having more detail differences from the C1 and 107. The three were manufactured at the TPCA assembly joint venture in Kolín, Czech Republic.

The 107 is a four-seater available as a three or five-door hatchback, replacing the 106, which ended production in July 2003. It shares its rear tail light clusters with the Citroën C1, apart from a different red coloured lens.

== Engines ==


== Facelifts ==

In February 2009, the Peugeot 107 received a facelift aligned with revisions to the Citroën C1 and the Toyota Aygo. Aesthetic changes included revised front bumper, interior, and wheel trims. The front fascia received a wider grille. 

The placement of the number plate has been moved from the black stripe in the middle of the grille (which now has a chrome style strip running along with it) to underneath the grille itself and two side vents have been added to give the car an updated look. The interior offered more seat fabric choices and revised centre console graphics. The engine which now produces 106 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre opposed to 109 before and the Standard Combined Urban Cycle fuel economy has been improved from to . A revised clutch was fitted from this model onwards. 

In the beginning of 2012, the 107 received a further facelift with a revised bonnet and front bumper/grille with integrated daytime running lights. The interior received a leather steering wheel and a new gearshift on higher-level trims. The official premiere of the facelift was in the Brussels Motor Show.

== Reliability ==
Breakdown statistics reported by the German Automobile Club in May 2010 placed the Peugeot 107 (which the data grouped with the Citroën C1 and Toyota Aygo) at the top of the sub small car class, in respect of the low breakdown rates achieved for cars aged between 1 and 4 years. Class laggards were the Chevrolet Matiz (0–3 year old cars) and the two seater Smart (4–5 year old cars).

In January 2010, PSA announced that it was recalling &quot;under 100,000 units&quot; of the 107 and the Citroën C1, following the worldwide recall by Toyota for a faulty sticking accelerator pedal – which the Aygo is affected by. Under certain circumstances, the pedal can stick in a partially depressed position, or return slowly to the off position.

=== Safety ===


== Replacement ==
The 107 was replaced by the Peugeot 108, which was launched in July 2014.

<text>SamTrans (stylized as samTrans; officially the San Mateo County Transit District) is a public transport agency in and around San Mateo, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. It provides bus service throughout San Mateo County and into portions of San Francisco and Palo Alto. SamTrans also operates commuter shuttles to BART stations and community shuttles. Service is largely concentrated on the east side of the Santa Cruz Mountains, and, in the central county, I-280, leaving coast-side service south of Pacifica spotty and intermittent.

SamTrans is constituted as a special district under California state law. It is governed by a board of nine appointed members; two county Supervisors, one &quot;transportation expert&quot; appointed by the county Board of Supervisors, three city council members appointed by the cities in the county to represent the county&#x27;s judicial districts, and three citizens appointed by the other six board members (including one from the coastside).

The district was established in 1976 and consolidated eleven different municipal bus systems serving the county. One year later, SamTrans began operation of mainline bus service to San Francisco. Shuttle service began in 2000.

In addition to fixed-route bus and paratransit operations, the district participates in the administration of the San Jose-San Francisco commuter rail line Caltrain. SamTrans also provides administrative support for the San Mateo County Transportation Authority, a separate board charged with administering the half-cent (0.5 percent) sales tax levy that funds highway and transit improvement projects.

In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== History ==

Voters in San Mateo County approved the formation of the San Mateo County Transit District in 1974. SamTrans was formed in 1976 by the consolidation of 11 different city bus systems throughout San Mateo County; several more systems were added over the following years. SamTrans took over Western Greyhound Lines commuter service on July 2, 1977; some routes were curtailed from downtown San Francisco to Daly City station. SamTrans purchased 40 buses from Greyhound at that time, and its fleet exceeded 200 buses by 1980.

In August 2013, the agency merged two routes along El Camino Real into the single all-day ECR route with 15-minute headways, briefly stemming a long-term decline in bus ridership that began in the early 1990s. Ridership on SamTrans buses was 52,140 passengers per weekday in November 2009; by November 2017, it had fallen to 37,830 bus passengers per weekday and continues to decline, further threatening the agency&#x27;s budget. According to a route-level analysis, in 2014, four lines accounted for more than half of all weekday riders: ECR, 120, 292, and 122/28, with ECR alone accounting for more than one quarter of all weekday riders. A half-cent sales tax, Measure W, which partially goes to SamTrans, passed on the November 2018 ballot.

== Facilities ==
SamTrans headquarters are at 1250 San Carlos Avenue in a building built in 1979 and acquired in 1990, one block southwest of the Caltrain station. In 2023, SamTrans authorized the acquisition of a new building near Millbrae BART and Caltrain station to be used as the new headquarter.

SamTrans has two maintenance bases. North Base opened in 1988. It is in South San Francisco, just north of San Francisco International Airport and adjacent to U.S. 101 and I-380. South Base opened in 1984 near the San Carlos Airport, east of U.S. 101 off Redwood Shores Parkway. Primary maintenance is carried out at North Base, which can store 200 buses. South Base can store 150 buses. SamTrans also owns Brewster Depot in Redwood City, which is used by its subcontractor MV Transportation for storage and dispatching; Brewster Depot is and was built in 1940.

== Bus service ==
Currently, SamTrans serves the cities of San Mateo County, including Atherton, Belmont, Brisbane, Burlingame, Colma, Daly City, East Palo Alto, Foster City, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, Menlo Park, Millbrae, Pacifica, Palo Alto, Redwood City, Redwood Shores, San Bruno, San Carlos, San Mateo, and South San Francisco. Most routes provide connecting service to BART, Caltrain, or both. There is also regular scheduled service to San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and Transbay Terminal in downtown San Francisco.

Unlike most large transit operators in the Bay Area, SamTrans outsources to private contractors the operation of a number of its routes. The current contract operator for Peninsula mainline, Coastside and paratransit services is MV Transportation.

SamTrans previously operated special service for a couple of Bay Area events such as San Francisco 49ers home football games and the quirky Bay to Breakers footrace in San Francisco.

=== Route designations ===
;Notes
SamTrans reorganized its bus routes in August 1999 and adopted a new route designation system to identify service types, geographical coverage, and connections to rail services.

=== Routes ===
Local routes have either two or three digits or a special designation (e.g., ECR). For three-digit routes, the first digit identifies a rail connection:

*1 – Connection to BART stations only (primarily routes in Daly City, Colma, South San Francisco and San Bruno)
*2 – Connection to Caltrain stations only (primarily routes south of Millbrae)
*3 – Connection to both BART and Caltrain stations (two routes have this designation: ECR, previously designated 390 and 391, provides service between Palo Alto and Daly City, 397 provides overnight service between San Francisco and Palo Alto as a part of the All Nighter network, and 399 provided overnight service between Daly City and San Francisco International Airport as a part of the All Nighter network, until it was discontinued on June 24, 2018 due to low ridership.) Route 292, which provides service between San Francisco and San Mateo is an exception.

All two-digit routes are community service routes. Most of these routes do not connect with rail and operate only on school days.

==== Express routes ====
Express bus routes were designated by a letter and X. In December 2009, six express routes (DX, FX, MX, NX, PX, and RX) were eliminated due to high budget constraints; a seventh express route, Route CX, was redesignated Route 118, which was eliminated in 2024. In August 2018, the last remaining express route, KX, was folded into Route 398, which was eliminated in 2023.

In April 2017, SamTrans identified fifteen potential express bus routes connecting the Peninsula counties of San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara. Most of the potential routes ran along U.S. 101, and some were planned to take advantage of managed lanes to provide speedier service. By June 2018, the list of potential bus routes was reduced to eight. The draft final report was released in November 2018, and the Board adopted it in December. SamTrans relaunched express bus service in August 2019 from Foster City to downtown San Francisco along U.S. 101, followed by a second route in Spring/Summer of 2020 from Palo Alto to western San Francisco along I-280. The Foster City–San Francisco route was launched as FCX in August 2019, but ridership and frequency have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area. The launch of the other proposed express route planned for Phase 1, PAX (Palo Alto to western San Francisco), has been delayed indefinitely and there is currently no exact or estimated date for it to begin operation. Phase 2 of the express bus plan includes two additional routes: EPX (East Palo Alto to San Bruno) and an un-named route (San Mateo to downtown San Francisco); EPX was launched in 2023 after SamTrans completed acquisition of XE40 battery-electric buses.

=== Fares ===
&quot;Since January 1, 2020&quot;
;Notes
As of December 22, 2010, Clipper card fare machines became fully operational throughout the system, allowing riders to pay fares using Clipper card, a transit smart card that is also accepted by most other Bay Area transit agencies.

Clipper cards come in four varieties: adult, youth, senior and disabled (which includes Medicare cardholders). Adult Clipper cards may be obtained from a wide variety of vendors, but youth, senior and disabled Clipper cards must be obtained from SamTrans or another Bay Area transit agency. Each Clipper card contains some sort of stored value (e.g., monthly passes, &quot;Clipper Cash&quot; e-funds used for transit fares) and the history of recent trips using the card. Clipper cards generally confer an approximately 10% discount relative to cash fares.

SamTrans does not provide physical transfers, but Clipper cards offer free transfers to other SamTrans buses within 2 hours of the first boarding. SamTrans additionally offers a Day Pass which allows unlimited rides on local routes and a credit on higher-cost routes. The cost of the Day Pass is thrice the one-way fare on the local routes for adults, youth, and seniors/disabled/Medicare cardholders.

With the exception of youth summer passes, all SamTrans monthly passes must be loaded onto a Clipper card. Youth, senior and disabled monthly passes may only be loaded onto a corresponding Clipper card obtained from SamTrans or another Bay Area transit agency.

To ride SamTrans with Clipper card, the card must be &quot;tagged&quot; (read) by the Clipper card reader installed at the front of the bus near the farebox. The reader checks for a SamTrans monthly pass and local-fare credits from other agencies, computes the remaining fare and (if there is one) collects it in Clipper Cash. Note that northbound passengers on route KX to San Francisco must &quot;tag&quot; their Clipper card twice: once when boarding within San Mateo County (which collects a local fare or equivalent) and once before exiting in San Francisco (which collects any remaining fare).

Caltrain monthly passes (with two or more zones) and VTA monthly passes (that have been tagged on VTA in the last two hours) are honored on SamTrans as a local-fare credit. To use a local-fare credit from a monthly pass loaded onto a Clipper card on higher-cost routes, the remaining fare must be collected in Clipper Cash.

New fareboxes were installed in June 2011. The fareboxes collect fares, issue new magnetic striped tickets (e.g., day passes, change cards) and process previously issued magnetic striped tickets (e.g., day passes, youth summer passes, change cards). When a patron does not have exact change, a change card is issued with a cash value that can be redeemed at a future farebox transaction for up to a year.

Up to three kids under 5 with fare-paying rider can board for free.

=== Fleet ===
SamTrans currently has a fleet of 296 buses of various sizes for its fixed-route service. Fifty-five are articulated buses made by New Flyer Industries with the 10 m (35 ft) and 12 m (40 ft) buses with low flooring, are made by the Gillig Corporation. Each bus is equipped with GPS tracking providing both visual and voice next-stop announcements, and are accessible to passengers in wheelchairs and those with limited mobility.

In 2009, SamTrans added 135 custom made Gillig low floor buses to their fleet, numbered 400-490, 500-539 &amp; 2900-2903, replacing 137 older Gillig Phantom buses in their fleet.

In 2018, SamTrans placed an order for 10 Proterra 40-foot Catalyst BE40s buses as a first step towards the goal to have an all-electric fleet by 2033. The battery electric buses were expected to enter revenue service in early 2019, and a charging station will be installed at each SamTrans maintenance facility. However, issues with battery charges and turning radius led to Samtrans ending the program. Recently, Samtrans took possession and testing of a New Flyer battery power bus, which has now led to both bases getting chargers installed or in process of being installed.

In 2023, SamTrans ordered 108 hydrogen fuel cell buses from New Flyer at a cost of $168m. SamTrans aims to have a diesel free bus fleet by the mid 2030s.

<text>Asphalt Ribbons were an English rock band that formed in Nottingham in 1987.

The original line-up was Stuart Staples, Gaynor Backhouse, Gary Watt and Rob Howard. Dave Boulter (organ and accordion) replaced Rob Howard in 1989 and Will Carless (drums) also joined in 1989, just before they released their first EP, &quot;The Orchard&quot;, on the In-Tape label. Neil Fraser was yet also listed as author on the song &quot;Over Again&quot; in the liner notes of the EP. Tracks on &quot;The Orchard&quot; were &quot;Over Again&quot;, &quot;Red Sauce&quot;, &quot;Greyhound&quot; and &quot;I Used to Live There&quot;. In-Tape also released a radio promo copy of &quot;Over Again&quot; in 1989.

&quot;Sounds&quot; listed them as a &#x27;name for 1990&#x27; and in the same week &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was touting them as &quot;the first new band of this year to make the indie/mainstream crossover&quot;.

During the course of 1990, Asphalt Ribbons became a six-piece, acquiring Craig Chettle (guitar). They also recorded &quot;Good Love&quot;, their second EP for In-Tape, which was produced by Jon Langford. The artwork for both EPs was by Wolfgang Buttress.

In 1991, the band relocated to London and shifted position again, this time to the pre-Tindersticks line-up featuring Stuart Staples (vocals), David Boulter (organ and accordion), Neil Fraser (guitar), Dickon Hinchliffe (guitar and strings), Al Macaulay (percussion and drums) and John Thompson (bass). They recorded &quot;Tiger Lily&quot; (1991), &quot;Passion, Coolness, Indifference ...&quot; (1991) and &quot;Old Horse&quot; (1991) for Rough Trade.

In 1992 a promotional video for &quot;Downside&quot; (ETT Records) was made.

It is known that the Asphalt Ribbons played live some early versions of songs, that later became tindersticks songs, e.g. &quot;for those who are not so beautiful&quot;, &quot;sweet sweet man&quot; and &quot;big silence&quot; aka &quot;raindrops&quot; in the tindersticks repertoire.

Mark Colwill replaced John Thomson in the last days before Asphalt Ribbons became Tindersticks. Mark was recruited when John left but it is not sure if he played any gigs under the Asphalt Ribbons name. They then changed their name to Tindersticks after Stuart discovered a box of German matches on a Greek beach.

Their sound is more country influenced than Tindersticks, but already features the distinctive vocals of Stuart Staples.

<doc id="1252367" wikidata="Q7959501" url="?curid=1252367" title="Wage regulation">
<text>Wage regulation refers to attempts by a government to regulate wages paid to citizens.

== Minimum wage ==

Minimum wage regulation attempts to set an hourly, or other periodic monetary standard for pay at work. A recent example was the U.K. National Minimum Wage Act 1998. Germany is currently debating whether to introduce its own.

== Collective bargaining ==

Collective agreements between trade unions and employers can regulate wages of workers according to the needs of the business.

==Arbitration==
Arbitration involves makes collective agreements between trade unions and employers legally binding and mediated through a state appointed judge or magistrate.

==Economic labour theory==

An economic analysis of the law holds very simply that any intervention in a contract between two parties creates an inefficient labour market. Wages kept artificially high, by imposing any administrative or monetary costs on employers distorts the labour market equilibrium. For a national economy in a globalised world, that means jobs will go overseas and the unemployment rate rises. Major proponents of this sort of labour economics include Nobel Prize winner from the University of Chicago, Professor Gary Becker.

Professor Becker keeps a blog with well-known academic and judge, Richard Posner. Posner is a lawyer and economist, and wrote a book called &quot;Economic Analysis of Law&quot;. His starting assumption is that unions are the cartelisation of the labour market. Both would agree, that if its aim is to improve the living standards of society, wage regulation defeats itself. Posner says, “Economics is not a theory about consciousness. Behaviour is rational when it conforms to the model of rational choice, whatever the state of mind of the chooser.” So, any conscious attempt to improve working standards are impossible under this view.

<doc id="1252369" wikidata="Q236744" url="?curid=1252369" title="Tunja">
<text>Tunja () is a municipality and city on the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes, in the region known as the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, 130 km northeast of Bogotá. In 2018 the municipality had a population of 172,548. It is the capital of Boyacá department and the Central Boyacá Province. Tunja is an important educational centre of well-known universities. In the time before the Spanish conquest of the Muisca, there was an indigenous settlement, called Hunza, seat of the &quot;hoa&quot; Eucaneme, conquered by the Spanish conquistadors on August 20, 1537. The Spanish city was founded by captain Gonzalo Suárez Rendón on August 6, 1539, exactly one year after the capital Santafé de Bogotá. The city hosts the most remaining Muisca architecture: Hunzahúa Well, Goranchacha Temple and Cojines del Zaque.

Tunja is a tourist destination, especially for religious colonial architecture, with the Casa Fundador Gonzalo Suárez Rendón recognized as the oldest remnant. In addition to its religious and historical sites it is host to several internationally known festivals and is a jumping-off point for regional tourist destinations such as Villa de Leyva, Paipa, and Sierra Nevada del Cocuy. It is a stop on the Pan American Highway which connects Tunja to Bogotá and Santa Marta and eventually to the northern and southernmost parts of South America.

== Demographics and geography ==

Tunja has a population of 172,548 inhabitants according to the 2018 Census. 0.1% of the city is indigenous, 0.4% is black, and 99.5% is white and Mestizo. It is located in central Colombia, at an elevation ranging from approximately to . The city centre is at an elevation of above sea level.

== Climate ==
Tunja&#x27;s climate is influenced by its location and altitude. At almost 3000 m it is one of the higher cities in Colombia. As a result, the city features a subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) with little variation in temperature throughout the year but a distinct dry season from December to February.

== History ==
=== Pre-Columbian era ===

The earliest evidence of human population on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense has been dated to approximately 12.000 years ago. Homus Tequendama inhabited the area by 6375 BCE. Archeologists have found human skeletons including arm bones in the area. Many archaeological discoveries were found in the area of the present-day city, dated to approximately 150 BCE.

During the 1st millennium AD, the territory was inhabited by the Muisca, who spoke Chibcha and emigrated from Central America through Panama to the Andean Region. The Muisca developed their own religion, calendar and mythology.

According to those myths, it was the brutal &quot;cacique&quot; and prophet Goranchacha who moved the capital for the northern Muisca from Ramiriquí to Tunja, then called Hunza.

=== Early Muisca ===
An era when frequent battles among &quot;cacicazgos&quot; took place, peace was proposed for the region and an agreement was made among &quot;caciques&quot; to choose a supreme chief to rule them all. Hunzahúa, who came from Ramiriqui, was elected. The capital of his confederation was named &quot;Hunza&quot;. Hunzahúa took the title of &quot;hoa&quot; (&quot;great lord&quot;, the same meaning as &quot;psihipqua&quot; who ruled from Muyquytá), and reign over the lands from the Chicamocha to Fusagasugá and from the Llanos de San Juan to Panche and Muzo frontiers, including Vélez territory. This helped to unify the Muisca, especially with respect to their language and religion, until &quot;zipa&quot; Saguamanchica broke this unity due to differences with the &quot;cacique&quot; of Guatavita.

=== Late Muisca (1490–1539) ===
Saguamanchica, with 50,000 soldiers, decided on a massive attack on &quot;hoa&quot; Michuá, crossing Guatavita and Chocontá, after which the Battle of Chocontá is named. Michuá dealt with him, supported by an army which doubled Saguamanchica, battling around three hours and killing both chiefs. A new &quot;hoa&quot;, Eucaneme, was installed, during the tense truce between Bacatá and Hunza.

In 1514, Eucaneme found out about the expansionist intentions of the new &quot;psihipqua&quot; Nemequene. He asked the &quot;caciques&quot; of Gámeza, Sugamuxi, Tundama and Sáchica to help him to reinforce his army. A battle was fought in Ventaquemada and, when Nemequene was about to become the victor, he was fatally wounded and his troops retreated. Iraca retracted his support and Eucaneme got a truce whose terms would end when the Spanish arrived. When Eucaneme found out the Europeans were around his lands, he decided to stay in Hunza and avoided any aggression against the invaders. He forbade under strict penalties to show the conquistadors the path to his headquarters and when he knew they were reaching him, he sent them gifts and peacemakers, hoping to stop them while he was hiding his treasures.

==== Hunza in Muisca history ====
=== Spanish colony (1539-1811) ===

====Spanish Discovering of Hunza (1537)====
Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada parted from Santa Marta in April 1536, on the first main expedition into the Andes. His main goal was to find and conquer &quot;El Dorado&quot;. After months of traveling, he found many Muisca &quot;cacicazgos&quot; in the Altiplano Cundiboyacense. In his search, he acquired information about emerald discoveries and other treasures in Somondoco and the Llanos. On August 20, 1537, the conquerors arrived, with horses and dogs. Jiménez de Quesada arrived at the headquarters of Quemuenchatocha, finding him in a chair, dressed in gold in the same way as his companions who ran off, leaving him alone. The gold, the emeralds and the fancy fabrics were taken. This conquest took place where later the San Agustin Convent was built. Quemuenchatocha was taken to Suesca, with the hope he would reveal where he hid the rest of his treasure. He abdicated in favour of his nephew Aquiminzaque and retired to Ramiriquí where he died.

====Invasion of Hunza (1538-1539)====
The Spanish Invasion of the territory begins when Jimenez de Quesada captures Quemuenchatocha who is succeeded in life by the young Aquiminzaque. The latter, along with his tribe were taken as an encomienda by Hernán Pérez de Quesada. The new zaque did not show belligerent in front of the Spaniards, and later himself converted to Catholicism. The continuous and numerous demands made by the Spaniards started to create discomfort among the Muisca population.

Aquiminzaque should verify his nuptials with the daughter of the cacique of Gameza and many chiefs decided to go the solemn ceremony. A rumour came to Perez de Quesada that the occasion would be used as an insurrection, for which he apprehended Aquiminzaque and all the caciques, among them the ones from Toca, Motavita, Samacá, Turmequé and Sutamarchán, and condemn them to death. In 1540, the Zaque was beheaded and his death marked the end of the dynasty of zaques of Hunza. In the same way, it points to the disintegration and dispersion of natives in encomiendas along the new Tunja Province.

====City Foundation (1539-16th Century)====
The Spanish city of Tunja was founded on the lands of Quemuenchatocha, where later the convent of San Agustin was built. Founded by Captain Gonzalo Suarez Rendón, on August 6, 1539, the main square was established, also a yard for the church and public buildings around the square; in 1550, the city outlines were consolidated. The same year, The franciscans arrive to the city, and the Dominicans a year later, the Augustinians in 1585 and the Jesuits in 1611; To the foundation, 77 yards are added and divided, along with 70 vegetable gardens, 11 estates and 44 stables. Only until 1616 two parishes are built to receive mestizos and Indians during colonial period: Santa Barbara, at southwest and Las Nieves, at north.

== Security and living conditions ==
Tunja has the lowest homicide rate in Colombia and is below average in Latin America according to the report from the International Centre of the Prevention of Crime for 2010. 2 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015 makes the city one of the safest in the Americas. According to other sources, this value is four times lower than the national average. Tunja is an example of a safe city.

<text>The Transmitter Hamburg-Billstedt is a broadcasting facility in Hamburg-Billstedt, established in 1934. It is owned and operated by the Norddeutscher Rundfunk public broadcasting service, but open to competitors, too.

==History==
From 1934 to 1949 it used as transmission aerial a wire hung up in a tower of wood. This tower had until 1941 a height of 145 metres. In 1941 its height was reduced to 84.5 metres and in 1949 it was demolished.

In 1940 a second aerial in form of a triangle area aerial was built. This aerial allowing transmitting on a wide frequency range was demolished in the Fifties.
In 1949/50 a 198-metre-high guyed steelframework mast with a cage aerial and a transmission aerial for FM and TV on its top was erected. From this mast, which was partly destroyed by a storm during its erection in December 1949, between 1953 and 1962 the programme of the &quot;Deutschen Langwellensender&quot; (German longwave transmitter) was broadcast.
This programme was transmitted in a special modulation mode, the compatible single sideband modulation, allowing smaller bandwidth and the possibility of reception with conventional AM receivers.
Because this mast was under high voltage the aerials for FM and TV on its top were fed via a Goubau line.

In the first half of the 1960s this aerial mast was demounted and the current installation built. It consists of:

* Guyed steel tube mast for FM and TV, built in 1960. This radio mast has a diameter of 2 metres. It was 255 metres high in 1960 and grew to 300 metres in the meantime.
* Guyed tubular mast radiator for mediumwave. This mast, which is 184 metres tall, is insulated against ground. It is designed as double feedable fading-reducing aerial and therefore equipped with a separation insulator in a height of 101 metres
* Guyed steel tube mast with a height of 120.9 metres and a diameter of 0.7 metres. This mast was built in 1939. It stood until 1963 at Osterloog transmitting station and was dismounted in this year and rebuilt in Hamburg-Billstedt. It is insulated against ground and used as back-up aerial for mediumwave.
* Guyed steel framework mast with a height of 77 metres insulated against ground. This mast built in 1979 is used as reflector mast for the 184-metre-high medium wave transmission mast. Its construction was necessary because of the conditions of the waveplan of Geneva.

Since 1967, the University of Hamburg has been using the 304 m-mast as a six-level meteorological measurement platform, with thermometers, hygrometers, and anemometers mounted at various heights up to 280 m above ground. The atmospheric variables are sampled at a high temporal resolution to allow computation of boundary layer turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum. Live data and time series are also made available via the World Wide Web. 

==Hamburg&#x27;s Light Miracle==
In 1934, shortly after the inauguration of the facility, some owners of recreational gardens discovered that a light bulb connected to ground and a highly spun wire made the bulb light up brightly enough to illuminate a small house. Later many other did so. Transmission energy is taken from the transmitter, and induces electrical power in the wire. This effect was not discovered immediately. Later, technicians of the transmitter noticed, that in the houses of nearby gardens, lights went on and off depending on whether the transmitter was switched on or off. This phenomenon got the nickname &quot;Hamburger Lichtwunder&quot; &quot;(German: &quot;Hamburg&#x27;s light miracle&quot;)&quot;. After this was discovered, use of transmitting energy of radio transmitters for other purposes than radio reception was prohibited in Germany by law.

<text>Jeffery L. Briggs (born March 10, 1957) is the American founder and former President and CEO of Firaxis Games, a video game developer based in Hunt Valley, Maryland, United States. He was previously a game designer at MicroProse but left that company in 1996 along with Sid Meier and Brian Reynolds to form Firaxis Games.

==Career==
Briggs holds a doctorate in musical composition and theory from the University of Illinois. Briggs&#x27; composition teachers included Samuel Adler, Warren Benson, Joseph Schwantner, Donald Freund, and John Melby. His career began in New York City where he composed music for various events, including dance and theater groups. He took a job as game editor and designer at West End Games where he worked until 1987. He then joined MicroProse Software, where he served as designer, writer, composer and producer, becoming the company&#x27;s Executive Producer and, finally, its Director of Product Development.

Briggs&#x27;s music first appeared in a 1989 MicroProse release &quot;Sword of the Samurai&quot;. Following that, most MicroProse games featured his work. Before working in software entertainment, Briggs&#x27; music had already received performances by ensembles internationally in Paris&#x27; Pompidou Centre (&quot;Ecliptic&quot;), New York City&#x27;s Avery Fisher Hall (&quot;Comets&quot;), and in the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts in Illinois (&quot;Adjectives,&quot; &quot;Firaxis&quot;, &quot;Chimera,&quot; &quot;Aurora,&quot; and others) as well as various smaller venues in New York and other cities throughout the United States. In 1996, he was awarded US Patent 5,496,962 for a &quot;System for Real-Time Music Composition and Synthesis&quot; used in a product called &quot;CPU Bach&quot;.

Briggs left MicroProse in 1996 to co-found Firaxis Games. In a 2004 interview he commented his decision: &quot;&quot;Civ II&quot; had just come out and MicroProse had been purchased by Spectrum HoloByte. [...] Things had gotten pretty bad. By that time I was director of product development and they were asking me to do things and tell people things that I just didn&#x27;t like. I decided that I could do a lot better job running the company than they could, so I left.&quot; Briggs then led the design of &quot;Civilization III&quot; and oversaw the expansion of the company into a major developer of strategy computer games. He also co-designed &quot;Colonization&quot; and &quot;Civilization II&quot;, as well as composing much of the original music in &quot;Civilization IV&quot;. He negotiated the acquisition of Firaxis Games by Take Two Interactive in 2005, became its Chairman in spring of 2006, and left Firaxis in November of that year.

In 2009, the Westfield Symphony Orchestra presented the world premiere of his composition &quot;Celebration for Orchestra&quot;.

<text>The Crowe River is a river in the counties of Haliburton, Hastings, Northumberland and Peterborough in southern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Lake Ontario drainage basin and is a tributary of the Trent River.

==Course==
The river begins at Paudash Lake and exits southeast out of the lake under Ontario Highway 28 and over Paudash Lake Dam at the settlement of Paudash in Faraday township, Hastings County. It turns southwest and heads through the southeast corner of the township of Highlands East in Haliburton County, then south into the township of North Kawartha in Peterborough County. The Crowe River heads south-southeast back into Hastings County at the township of Wollaston, passes through a -long, -high and -wide gorge at The Gut Conservation Area, takes in the left tributary Green River, and reaches Tangamong Lake.
The river continues south out of the lake over a falls, takes in the left tributary Copeway Creek, passes into the township of Marmora and Lake at Mud Turtle Lake east of the settlement of Vansickle, heads back into Peterborough County at the township of Havelock-Belmont-Methuen, flows through Cordova Lake and out over Cordova Lake Dam, and reaches Belmont Lake where it takes in the major right tributary North River. It exits the lake from Crowe River Bay to the east over Belmont Dam to Crowe Lake, where it once again enters Marmora and Lake township, takes in the major left tributary Beaver Creek, and reaches the community of Marmora on Ontario Highway 7.

There, the Crowe River passes over Marmora Dam, heads southwest into the township of Stirling-Rawdon, passes over two one-metre (3 ft 3 in)-high and -wide falls at Callaghan&#x27;s Rapids Conservation Area, enters the municipality of Trent Hills in Northumberland County, flows over Allan Mills dam, passes over several falls at Crow Bridge Conservation Area, and reaches its mouth at Crowe Bay on the Trent River, just upstream of the Trent–Severn Waterway Crowe Bay lock and dam. The Trent River flows to the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario at Trenton.

==Watershed==
The northern part of the watershed is sparsely inhabited Canadian Shield terrain. At Marmora, the watershed enters Paleozoic limestone-plain country, with unusual outcroppings of Canadian Shield through the limestone at Allan Mills and just above Crowe Bridge. The river drains an area of about .

==Economy==
At one time, the river was used to transport logs down to sawmills at Marmora. The river powers several small hydroelectric generating stations. The limestone-step falls at Callaghans Rapids Conservation Area and Crowe Bridge Conservation Area are popular sites for springtime kayakers and summertime swimmers.

<doc id="1252404" wikidata="Q7129479" url="?curid=1252404" title="Pan-American (train)">
<text>The Pan-American was a passenger train operated by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&amp;N) between Cincinnati, Ohio and New Orleans, Louisiana. It operated from 1921 until 1971. From 1921 to 1965 a section served Memphis, Tennessee via Bowling Green, Kentucky. The &quot;Pan-American&quot; was the L&amp;N&#x27;s flagship train until the introduction of the &quot;Humming Bird&quot; in 1946. Its name honored the substantial traffic the L&amp;N carried to and from the seaports on the Gulf of Mexico. The &quot;Pan-American&quot; was one of many trains discontinued when Amtrak began operations in 1971.

== History ==
The L&amp;N introduced the &quot;Pan-American&quot; on December 5, 1921. A section of the train diverged at Bowling Green, Kentucky to serve Memphis, Tennessee. At the outset the train carried both sleepers and coaches, and was noteworthy for its all-steel construction in an era when wood heavyweight coaches were still common. The name honored the substantial traffic the L&amp;N carried to and from the seaports on the Gulf of Mexico. It covered the from Cincinnati to New Orleans in 26 hours, soon shortened to exactly 24 hours.

The train proved popular with the traveling public, and in 1925 was re-equipped as an &quot;All-Pullman&quot; (no coaches) train. Its popularity contributed to businesses named after it; the Pan-American Lunch Room operated in Nashville, Tennessee in the 1920s. The economic pressures of the Great Depression forced the &quot;Pan-American&quot; to start carrying coaches again in 1933.

Like many L&amp;N trains, the &quot;Pan-American&quot; experienced a surge in ridership during World War II, carrying four times its normal traffic. The &quot;Pan-American&quot; lost its title as the L&amp;N&#x27;s flagship train in 1946 with the introduction of faster &quot;Humming Bird&quot; over the same route. Although never fully streamlined, the &quot;Pan-American&quot; began receiving streamlined equipment in 1949. The southbound &quot;Pan-American&quot; carried through sleepers for Nashville, Tennessee, Louisville, Kentucky and Memphis from New York City conveyed by the Pennsylvania Railroad in Cincinnati. Further south in Montgomery, Alabama it received New York-New Orleans and Washington-New Orleans sleepers from the Southern Railway&#x27;s &quot;Piedmont Limited&quot;.

In 1953 the &quot;Pan-American&quot; was one of several L&amp;N trains to receive new lightweight &quot;Pine&quot;-series sleeping cars from Pullman-Standard. Throughout the 1960s, the decline of passenger railroading in the United States took its toll on ridership and amenities. A counter-lounge replaced the diner-lounge in 1965. The &quot;Pan-American&quot; began handling some of the &quot;South Wind&quot;&#x27;s through traffic in 1970 after the Penn Central withdrew from joint operation. By 1970 the train&#x27;s consist had shrunk dramatically: between Cincinnati and Louisville it might carry only a baggage car, coach, and dining car, with a sleeper for New Orleans added in Louisville. Amtrak did not retain service over the L&amp;N route, and the &quot;Pan-American&quot; ended on April 30, 1971.

== Cultural influence ==

In the words of Kincaid Herr, official historian of the L&amp;N, the &quot;Pan-American&quot; &quot;came to be the symbol of the L&amp;N&#x27;s passenger service.&quot; The train was made famous by WSM Radio&#x27;s nightly broadcast of the passing train&#x27;s whistle. Some &quot;Pan-American&quot; passengers were lucky enough to sit in comfortable lounge chairs and hear the sound of their own train&#x27;s whistle from a wood-cabinet table radio tuned to WSM in the observation car. The broadcasts began on August 15, 1933.

The &quot;Pan-American&quot; inspired several songs:
* &quot;Pan-American Blues&quot; (1926) by DeFord Bailey
* &quot;The Pan-American&quot; (1948) by Hank Williams
* &quot;Pan-American Boogie&quot; (1949) by the Delmore Brothers

&quot;Pan-American Blues&quot; was one of two railroad songs recorded by DeFord Bailey (the other being &quot;Dixie Flyer Blues&quot;, so named for another L&amp;N train. Bailey saw the &quot;Pan-American&quot; frequently at Nashville&#x27;s Union Station in the 1920s, but the inspiration for name came from one of his foster sisters, who noted that &quot;it was the fastest around.&quot; Bailey, with his harmonica, imitated the sound of the &quot;Pan-American&quot;&#x27;s whistle and it quickly became one of his most-requested performances at the Grand Ole Opry and elsewhere.

<text>The Apalachicola Northern Railroad was a short-line railroad which operated in the Florida Panhandle of the United States. It owned and operated a between Port Saint Joe, Florida, and Chattahoochee, Florida, with a short spur to Apalachicola, Florida. It was founded in 1903 and ceased operating in 2002 when the St. Joe Company, its corporate parent, leased its line to the AN Railway.

== History ==
The company was chartered on April 7, 1903. Construction began on March 21, 1905, and trains began running north from Apalachicola in 1907. The extension to Port St. Joe was completed on May 10, 1910.

The company operated in receivership on three separate occasions: July 1907 to October 1908, May 1914 to February 1916 and May 1932 to December 1936.

The company came under ownership of Alfred I. du Pont in 1933, along with the entire town of Port St. Joe. The railroad&#x27;s largest customer, the St. Joe Paper Company mill in Port St. Joe, was owned by the Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust from 1936 to 1996. On September 30, 1940, Edward Ball, who managed the du Pont trust properties, transferred control of the railroad to the St. Joe Paper Company. When the paper company was sold in 1996, ownership of the railroad was returned to the St. Joe Company.

AN Railway, a subsidiary of the Rail Management Corporation, leased the line from the St. Joe Company on September 1, 2002 and acquired the railroad&#x27;s locomotives, rolling stock, and railroad equipment. From that date the Apalachicola Northern ceased to operate as a railroad. The St. Joe Company continues to own the physical line.

On the night of 26/27 October 1942, the 2nd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade (part of the 7th Motor Brigade), with thirteen 6-pounder anti-tank guns and the 239th Battery, 76th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, with six more 6-pounders, was ordered to occupy a desert feature known as Snipe, a small depression in the landscape south-west of Kidney Ridge that was suitable for an outpost. Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade.

From 26 to 27 October, the 2nd Rifle Brigade defeated numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army during Operation Lightfoot; the battalion suffered 72 casualties. The fighting at Outpost Snipe led Rommel to write that an armoured attack, on ground which the defenders had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed.

==Background==

===Operation Lightfoot===

The Second Battle of El Alamein began with Operation Lightfoot, an Eighth Army plan for the main attack to be made in the north by XXX Corps (Lieutenant-General Willoughby Norrie) and a secondary attack in the south by XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese), with X Corps (Lieutenant-General Herbert Lumsden) standing by to exploit success. Montgomery intended that two corridors were to be cut through the Axis minefields opposite the XXX Corps area. One corridor was to run south-west through the 2nd New Zealand Division (Lieutenant-General Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg) sector, towards the centre of Miteirya Ridge and the second was to run westwards, passing north of the west end of Miteirya Ridge and straddling the areas of the 9th Australian Division and the 51st (Highland) Division.
Tanks would pass through the gaps and defeat the German armoured divisions. Diversions at Ruweisat Ridge in the centre and in the south were intended to convince the Axis that the main British effort would be in the south and the 10th Armoured Division moved behind XIII Corps to add to the impression. In the north, four infantry divisions of XXX Corps were to advance on a front to the Oxalic Line, an objective beyond the forward Axis outposts. Engineers would then clear and mark the two lanes through the minefields and the armoured divisions of X Corps would pass through to gain the Pierson Line. The tanks would consolidate just west of the infantry positions, to intercept an armoured counter-attack against the infantry. The tanks would then advance to the next objective, &quot;Skinflint&quot;, deep inside the Axis defences and astride the Rahman track, to confront the Axis tanks. The Eighth Army infantry would continue to &quot;crumble&quot; the three lines of Axis fortifications and destroy any tanks that attacked them.

==Prelude==

===2nd Rifle Brigade===
The 2nd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade (Lieutenant-Colonel Victor Turner) was one of two battalions in the 7th Motor Brigade of the 1st Armoured Division. The motor battalions did not have four rifle companies and various support platoons, like normal infantry battalions. The 2nd Rifle Brigade had an establishment of an anti-tank company of sixteen 6-pounder anti-tank guns, three rifle companies, a scout platoon riding in eleven Universal Carriers, a platoon of 3-inch mortars and a machine-gun platoon with Vickers medium machine-guns, a scale of equipment which could generate much more fire power than a normal infantry battalion. Losses during Operation Lightfoot had reduced the battalion to and who had been reinforced by two troops of the 239th Battery, 76th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, with six more 6-pounders and from the 7th Field Squadron, which brought the battalion up to about 

===Operation Supercharge===

The course of Operation Lightfoot led Rommel to commit the 90th Light Division from reserve to the north of the front. The move of the division in the coastal sector suggested that Rommel expected the next Eighth Army attack there. Montgomery planned Operation Supercharge, an attack on a front south of Point 29, for the night of as soon as the Eighth Army had completed a reorganisation to create reserves for the attack. To keep Axis attention on the coastal sector, Montgomery ordered the renewal of the 9th Australian Division attacks on the night of as the rest of the infantry of XXX Corps consolidated the new line and tanks covered the Australian left flank. The Australian positions were taken over by a brigade of the 51st (Highland) Division and to the south, the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn and replaced with the 1st South African Division by extending its right flank, as the 4th Indian Division further south did the same. In XIII Corps, the 7th Armoured Division was to conserve its strength, ready to move towards the coast as soon as the 21st Panzer Division was known to have moved north.
Major-General Raymond Briggs, the 1st Armoured Division commander, continued attempts to push forward the tanks to act as a shield for the infantry, by creating a firm base, despite the congestion caused by the division being superimposed on the 51st (Highland) Division. Arguments between the tank and infantry commanders as to the position of the front line had bedevilled co-operation, with the tank commanders insisting that their units were much further forward than the infantry commanders believed. The Eighth Army headquarters decided to end the bickering by having the troops light flares, which would be mapped from several locations to triangulate their positions but this took place too late to affect the operation. Two battalions of the 7th Motor Brigade (Brigadier Thomas Bosvile) were to advance either side of Kidney Ridge and occupy ground from which Axis anti-tank emplacements could be dominated and create a path for the 2nd and 24th Armoured brigades to advance. Woodcock was north-west and Snipe the same distance south-west of the ridge.

Arguments about the location of infantry and tank units after Operation Lightfoot had not been resolved by a reconnaissance during the morning, as the flare-firing exercise had not begun, which left Turner in doubt about the battalion start line and the position of the objective. After the flares had been lit the confusion persisted, because the tanks units refused to accept the evidence that their map reading was even worse than that of the infantry. Late on 26 October, Turner referred this to the 7th Motor Brigade headquarters, who replied that it was too late to change plans. Turner ordered the battalion to follow the creeping barrage, which began at on a bearing of 270°, rather than the 233° given by the battalion navigator, which delayed the infantry for ten minutes as they reassembled to follow it. The battalion passed through the 5th Black Watch and then the 1st Gordon Highlanders by on the morning of 27 October.

==Battle==

===26 October===

The 2nd Rifle Brigade advanced on the new bearing at and met little opposition apart from dust, which lay deep in the lanes through the minefields, for the first and then came upon barbed wire, which turned out to line a dummy minefield. Over the next , the battalion took twenty prisoners, scattered several parties of Axis infantry and moved for about beyond a ridge, to what was thought to be Snipe, after a smoke shell was fired to mark the position by the British artillery. It was a similar depression to Snipe with an abandoned German engineer store, about south-east of the objective. Turner ordered the battalion to dig in at and fired the rocket signal for the heavier weapons to be brought forward. The lorries and Chevrolet carrying the anti-tank guns, encountered long sandy ridges which slowed the journey but nineteen of the twenty-seven 6-pounders and the ammunition were unloaded and dug in by 

The guns in small dips had cover and were on soft sand, which could be excavated; the five guns of B Company were dug in to the south-east, facing from C Company had four guns which were to the south-west, covering the angles from and A Company had four guns facing north-west and north. Six guns of 239/76th Anti-Tank Battery faced north and north east. The C Company carrier platoon patrolled to the west and found about ready to surrender but before infantry arrived to collect them, the platoon ran into a laager of about tanks (XII Armoured Battalion from the 133rd Armoured Division &quot;Littorio&quot;) and German tanks, (self-propelled anti-tank guns) and infantry (). The British opened fire and set three lorries on fire but lost a carrier while withdrawing. Most of the prisoners ran away but from Pioneer Battalion 220 of the 164th Light &quot;Afrika&quot; Division Pioneer Battalion 33 of the 15th Panzer Division.
Camp fires showed that another laager with tanks of the 15th Panzer Division was to the north. broke camp and formed two columns, one moving towards the laager to the north and one straight towards the south-west part of Outpost Snipe, where C and B companies were placing their anti-tank guns. The column was led by a Panzer IV Special, which was knocked out and set on fire by a C Company 6-pounder at range, as A Company hit a , the column turning aside. The British Forward Observation Officer (FOO) went out to reconnoitre at and disappeared. Just before dawn, the lorries returned to the east with the prisoners. The depression and scrub were good cover and the infantry, some of whom had been in the desert since 1940, dug in deep. 

===27 October===

====Morning====

When dawn broke the battalion found that it was in scrubby desert, deployed in a north-east to south-west oval, about long and wide. As movement was seen in the German laager, the gun-crews in the north-west face of Outpost Snipe prepared to receive an attack but the German tanks moved westwards, away from the front line, which exposed them broadside to the British guns. The gunners opened fire and for thirty minutes the north end of the outpost disappeared in smoke, flying sand and explosions as Axis artillery and tanks replied to the anti-tank fire, until the tanks were out of range. Part of had spent the night in a dip, reappeared to the south-west of Snipe and also moved with their sides exposed to the British 6-pounders. The gunners claimed six German, eight Italian tanks and two self-propelled guns destroyed and two tanks damaged, for the loss of three anti-tank guns knocked out and one sunk into the sand. Axis return fire caused several casualties and daylight showed that some of the guns were too exposed and needed to be re-sited.

The armoured brigades had been intended to join the parties at Snipe and Woodcock but the failure at Woodcock caused confusion and hesitation among the British tank units. The 47th Royal Tank Regiment (47th RTR) of the 24th Armoured Brigade, was under command of the 10th Armoured Division and drove over a ridge at saw a post surrounded by German tanks beyond, assumed it was a German laager and opened fire. Turner sent an officer back in a Bren Gun Carrier, who managed to get the most advanced tanks to stop after thirty minutes but the rest kept firing. As the British tanks moved forward, the Rifle Brigade gunners at the south end of Snipe saw about tanks with long-barrelled guns (Panzer III or Panzer IV Specials), heading behind a ridge away to ambush the British tanks.

The German tanks were broadside on again and the British gunners immediately hit and set three more on fire; the 47th RTR machine-gunned the crews as they tried to escape. By the 47th RTR had arrived at Snipe, which attracted a storm of artillery-fire and the outpost disappeared again in smoke, fire, explosions and flying sand. German tanks fired smoke shells at the British tanks and then anti-tank and tank gunners aimed at the smoke, which was much easier to see than the camouflaged vehicles. Soon the 47th RTR was down to five Shermans and six Crusaders and at the tanks were ordered to retire with the 41st (Oldham) Royal Tank Regiment (41st RTR), which had lost another twelve tanks, ending a plan for the 24th Armoured Brigade to pivot to the south of Outpost Snipe into open ground. As the tanks moved, they were engaged from about to the north, by tanks and anti-tank guns; a British gunner was persuaded to open fire despite the range and knocked out a Panzer IV, for a loss of two 6-pounders.
The battalion Medical Officer and the ambulances had been left behind at the start line on 26 October and had been unable to move forward in daylight; the loss of the FOO during the night, made it impossible to direct plunging fire on the Axis artillery and tanks hidden in dips around the post. Much of the British artillery-fire fell around the outpost instead, until the 2nd Rifle Brigade managed to stop the guns at . The outpost was also running short of ammunition and three carriers were loaded with the most badly wounded men, dashed for the ridge to the east and reached safety. The battalion ambulances and supply lorries were behind the ridge ready to move, along with a replacement FOO but nothing could make the return journey through the Axis artillery and machine-gun fire, which began as soon as a vehicle appeared above the crest. Around Italian infantry were seen assembling opposite the western face of the outpost and carriers from a scout platoon sallied from the post to disperse them, inflicting many casualties and destroying two vehicles towing captured 6-pounders. Two anti-tank guns were moved to the south-west perimeter from the north, despite the Bren Gun Carriers not having towing attachments and dust thrown up by the move being shelled by Axis artillery, which killed four men.

Just as the guns were readied, thirteen Italian M13/40 tanks from the XIII Battalion appeared over the ridge to the west and about twenty German tanks of used the attack as cover to advance from the hull-down ambush position to counter-attack the 24th Armoured Brigade, which had retired to similar positions behind the ridge to the east. The anti-tank guns along the western flank of Snipe opened fire and hit four Italian tanks at once, causing the rest to return to cover. The German tanks came into the open and exposed their sides to the Rifle Brigade gunners and then half of the German tanks turned towards the outpost to suppress the fire from the anti-tank guns, only to present their sides to the British tanks behind the ridge. The gunners at Snipe and the tank gunners ignored the vehicles heading towards them and concentrated on those which were broadside on. Eight German tanks were set on fire, several more began attempts to tow them away and the rest retreated.

====Afternoon====
Conditions inside Snipe worsened in the midday heat as the number of casualties increased, with little more than shell-dressings and water to tend them. Just before noon, six Bren Gun Carriers were hit and caught fire; the heat and smoke drifting over the guns making the visibility even worse. Many of the gunners were among the casualties and guns were kept in action with improvised crews and by men moving from one to the other. Only thirteen guns were still operational to cover the perimeter and the guns along the south-west face became so short of ammunition that two men drove Jeeps back and forth to share out the remainder. Three of the remaining carriers took out more wounded but one was knocked out during the journey and at Axis artillery and machine-gun fire increased. Eight Italian M13/40s, a self-propelled gun and infantry appeared over a ridge to the south-west, where only one 6-pounder was still in action. Turner and another officer joined the sergeant in command of the gun and waited until the tanks were within , then knocked out five tanks and the self-propelled gun before the Italians had closed the range to .
With only two rounds left and the last three M13/40s pressing on, Lieutenant Toms left the gun to drive a jeep to the nearest knocked-out gun for ammunition and arrived back at the gun through machine-gun fire, which set the jeep petrol tank alight. Turner and an NCO rushed over to help unload the jeep, by when the tanks were away, firing machine-guns at the gun crew. Sergeant Calistan, the gun-layer, hit the three tanks and set them on fire, from which none of the crews escaped. After the attack there was a lull, apart from shelling which caused more casualties. Turner had been wounded unloading the jeep but visited the gun positions until the effects of his wounds became too serious; by most of the officers were casualties and the guns were commanded by wounded NCOs. Briggs ordered forward the 2nd Armoured Brigade artillery, the 11th RHA and they drove their M7 Priests up the east side of the ridge to bombard Axis positions but managed only to hit Snipe again with 105 mm howitzer fire.

Rommel could see the fighting around Snipe from his headquarters and assembled the 90th Light Division and the 21st Panzer Division, which had been moved to the northern area of the battlefield overnight, with parts of the 15th Panzer Division, the 164th Light &quot;Afrika&quot; Division and a battlegroup of the 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot;. About tanks and self-propelled guns in two waves, about west of Outpost Snipe were to attack the British tanks beyond the ridge to the east, after a five-minute bombardment and a Junkers Ju 87 attack. As the formation of twenty , escorted by twenty Fiat CR.42s and twenty Bf 109s approached, it was intercepted by sixteen Curtiss P-40s of the 64th Fighter Squadron and the 65th Fighter Squadron, United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), which claimed six Axis fighters. The Axis formation was then attacked by of 33 Squadron and 213 Squadron RAF, which claimed two , four CR-42s and three Bf 109s for a loss of three Hurricanes.

Part of the Axis tank force advanced against Australian positions near Point 29 to the north of Snipe; to the south about thirty German and ten Italian tanks advanced towards part of the 2nd Armoured Brigade. The force in the north was deluged by artillery-fire and then dispersed by bombing and the southern force passed by the 239th Battery, with seven of the tanks only away. The anti-tank gunners knocked out nine tanks, damaged several and a 6-pounder crew from A Company claimed four more, after which the tanks withdrew to low ground near Kidney Ridge. The second wave of tanks attacked and fifteen Panzer IIIs turned towards the north-west perimeter of Snipe, where only two guns were operational. A third gun was hauled round in time to join in but there were only thirty armour-piercing rounds left. The tanks advanced cautiously along routes with cover and machine-gunned the 6-pounders as they came into view, driving the crews into slit trenches.

When three tanks were away, a sergeant crawled to one of the guns and operated it alone, hitting the leading tank twice, despite the machine-gun fire, then knocked out the next two, the third tank being hit by a shot which went through the second tank. The third tank drove into cover, about back, where the rest of the force rallied, less six tanks knocked out. The tanks machine-gunned the position, without exposing themselves to return fire from the anti-tank guns, for the rest of the day. About seventy Axis armoured vehicles littered the area and the 2nd Rifle Brigade had lost sixteen Bren Gun Carriers and ten 6-pounders, with another five damaged; at a signal was sent to the 7th Motor Brigade about the tanks; reinforcements were promised but no armoured counter-attack was made. The 2nd Rifle Brigade burnt their codes and soon after, the light began to fade; at the German tanks drove to the north-east where some were silhouetted and the British fired their last anti-tank ammunition, hitting one tank. Survivors from the posts around the perimeter began to move towards the command post, dragging wounded with them, under streams of bullets from Axis machine-guns being fired horizontally across the outpost.

===28 October===

After checking the 6-pounders to make sure they were incapable of firing, the last unwounded troops prepared for the relief but no sign of a relief party or the battalion transport appeared and at the survivors of A and C companies withdrew with one 6-pounder, which was carried out on a damaged Chevrolet ; as both sides were out rescuing wounded and the party was not fired on. British artillery opened fire soon after the retirement began and bombarded accurately the area around Outpost Snipe for the first time, which led to German tanks moving from their laagers straight towards the outpost, at which, the battalion HQ with the remaining men retired for on foot and under fire. A relief force of the 5th Royal Sussex from the fresh 133rd Lorried Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Alec Lee) had set out when the brigade began to take over from the 7th Motor Brigade and the British bombardment had been fired as the 5th Royal Sussex advanced. As the 2nd Rifle Brigade had retired they had passed unseen by the relieving battalion, which dug in before dawn about south-east of Outpost Snipe.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
The 2nd Rifle Brigade showed that with powerful anti-tank guns, dug in on well-chosen positions, British infantry could inflict disproportionate losses on tanks, knocking out German tanks at . Co-operation between the Rifle Brigade gunners and the tank gunners of the 24th Armoured Brigade on 27 October had been excellent but the imminence of Operation Supercharge and the fate of the tanks which reached Snipe on 27 October, left Briggs reluctant to risk more tanks. The attempt of the 1st Armoured Division to provide artillery support backfired, due to the chronic inability of the British commanders to agree where their units were (even after the location exercise with flares). Rommel had ordered a counter-attack by the reserve, to restore the original German positions on a front from El Wishka in the south to Point 29 in the north, which had been lost during Operation Lightfoot. Outpost Snipe was behind the German front line, across the route of the right flank of the counter-attack of 27 October; Rommel wrote later of the &quot;murderous fire&quot;, which &quot;struck into our ranks&quot; and stopped the biggest Axis counter-attack against XXX Corps; an armoured attack on ground where the defender had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed.

===Casualties===
The 2nd Rifle Brigade suffered but a month later, a committee of investigation concluded that the battalion had managed to knock out 52 to 57 Axis vehicles, of which and tanks had been destroyed, along with five self-propelled guns. Axis human losses were unknown but believed to be more than the Rifle Brigade losses. In 2001, Barrie Pitt gave and self-propelled guns destroyed, plus an unknown number of armoured vehicles which had been recovered and in 2003 John Latimer recorded and tanks. In 1978, Matthew Cooper wrote that on 26 October, the fourth day of Operation Lightfoot, the tank strength of the had fallen from and on 27 October had been reduced to tanks.

===Victoria Cross===
Lieutenant-Colonel Victor Turner was awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in the battle.

<doc id="1252416" wikidata="Q1740207" url="?curid=1252416" title="Droitwich Transmitting Station">
<text>The Droitwich transmitting station is a large broadcasting facility for long-wave and medium-wave transmissions, established in 1934 in the civil parish of Dodderhill, just outside the village of Wychbold, near Droitwich in Worcestershire, England (). The site is the location of the British Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s most powerful long-wave transmitter, which together with the two Scottish long-wave transmitters at Burghead and Westerglen forms a network broadcasting on the same frequency. The masts can be seen to the east from the M5 motorway, between Droitwich and Bromsgrove, as well as to the west from the Herefordshire/Worcestershire border. At night, the two sets of aircraft warning lights are visible from a long distance. The station is owned and operated by Arqiva.

==History==
In February 1932, radio broadcasting strength tests took place at Wychbold and Whittington, Worcestershire.

By March 1932, it was decided to put the 5XX LW transmitter at Droitwich, at 120kW, and to boost the Midland Regional to 70 kW there. The Wychbold site was chosen in December 1932. The site was bought in March 1933, three miles north east of Droitwich.

The foundations were built by May 1933.

In November 1933 the expected power was increased to 150kW, as that was the maximum allowed under the Lucerne Plan, which took effect on 15 January 1934.

Tests began on Monday 30 July 1934 at 12.05am until 3am, to 31 August, except on Sundays. The station was expected to partly open on Thursday 6 September 1934, on 1,500 metres LW. It would open at 3.45pm until 4.15pm, then from 10.40pm in the evening. The first morning broadcast of the National programme would be the following day from 10.15am until 11.55am.

The two masts were 180 tons each, 700 ft apart. Power came from four 750 hp English Electric (in Rugby) &#x27;L type&#x27; diesel engines, 
 each connected to a 470kW three phase alternator, producing enough power to supply 5,000 homes; exhaust from the engines powered the building&#x27;s central heating. The engines ran at 375 rpm, with an output voltage of 415V.

===First broadcasts===
The first item was the 1923 &quot;The Merrymakers&quot; overture, by Eric Coates, played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Aylmer Buesst.

The full opening was on Sunday 7 October 1934. It was hoped a member of the Royal family would open the building, but none were available.

==Technical specifications==
The long-wave frequency used was 200 kilohertz (frequently referred to by the wavelength, 1,500 metres) until 1 February 1988 when it was changed to 198 kilohertz, and the power is currently 500 kilowatts. The carrier frequency is controlled by a rubidium atomic frequency standard in the transmitter building, enabling the transmission to be used as an off-air frequency standard. For long-wave, a T-aerial is used, which is suspended between two guyed steel lattice radio masts, which stand apart from each other. There are also two guyed mast radiators at the site. The northerly mast is actually the transmitting antenna whilst the southern mast is a passive reflector causing the rf signal to form a cardioid pattern tending in a NE direction so as not to interfere with the similar set up in Bristol. The smaller mast system transmits digital radio signals. The main large system is used for transmitting AM medium-wave radio programmes on 693 kilohertz and 1053 kilohertz and, until 2023, on 1215 kilohertz.

==Transmissions==
BBC Radio 4 Longwave is transmitted on 198 kHz. This signal also carries radio data encoded using phase modulation, giving a time-of-day signal, and radio teleswitch control signals for Economy 7 electric-heating systems.

BBC Radio 5 Live is broadcast on 693 kHz medium wave (MW), providing coverage for most of the English Midlands and Wales at a signal strength (150 kW) which is one of the strongest for that station, equal to Brookmans Park and second only to Moorside Edge.

During World War II coded messages, which were read during normal programmed broadcasts, were sent to the French Resistance using the transmitter.

In 2011, as a result of budget cuts, the BBC announced that there would be no re-investment in long wave transmissions, which may mean an eventual end to BBC Radio 4 Longwave broadcasts. The same year, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the transmitter relies upon a pair of glass valves, of which there are fewer than 10 left in the world, and the BBC did not believe it was safe enough to manufacture more, because &quot;slightly faulty&quot; replacements could cause catastrophic failure. 

In 2023, the BBC announced that it would close down longwave transmissions sometime in 2024 and would end separate programming for the longwave transmitter in March 2024. with an intent to switch off its long wave transmitters on, or shortly after, this date. The separate long wave programming ended on 15 April 2024. However, the long wave signal will continue until at least the date, of 30 June 2025, when the cessation of the usage of Radio 4&#x27;s long wave frequencies for the radio teleswitching service occurs.

==Reception==
The Radio 4 LW signal from Droitwich covers most of England and Wales. There are supplementary long-wave transmitters in Scotland (Burghead and Westerglen, both 50 kW). The station can also be heard clearly in most of the Republic of Ireland, particularly along eastern and southern counties. Reception is also possible in Western Europe, including Italy and Sweden.

<text>RailAmerica, Inc., based in Jacksonville, Florida, was a holding company of a number of short-line railroads and regional railroads in the United States and Canada.

In 2007, RailAmerica was acquired by Fortress Investment Group. Before that, it traded on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol RRA. It was relisted in October 2009 with the ticker symbol RA.

On June 30, 2010, the company announced that it had acquired Atlas Railroad Construction, a construction and maintenance company operating in the Northeast and Midwest United States, for US$24 million.

In April 2011, RailAmerica made its first shortline purchase in over five years by initiating a deal with Gulf and Ohio Railways to acquire three Alabama shortlines for $12.7 million.

On July 23, 2012, Genesee &amp; Wyoming Inc. announced that it intended to purchase RailAmerica in a deal valued at $1.39 billion. Approval of the purchase was granted by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board on December 19, 2012. While awaiting the decision, Genesee &amp; Wyoming put RailAmerica control in the hands of a trust. They assumed control on December 28, 2012, and the company was in the process of integration to G&amp;W.

==Former subsidiaries==
RailAmerica controlled the following railroads. It acquired some through purchase of other holding companies: RailLink Canada in July 1999, RailTex in February 2000, ParkSierra and StatesRail in January 2002, and the rail properties of Alcoa in September 2005.

In addition to those listed below, RailAmerica&#x27;s prior owner, Fortress Investment Group, purchased the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) in September 2007 from Florida East Coast Industries. Although Fortress maintained a level of common control between the two railroads, FEC was never made a formal part of the RailAmerica family, and Fortress did not include FEC in the RailAmerica spinoff.

RailAmerica was founded by Gary O. Marino and John H. Marino in 1986.

<text>The Burghead transmitting station is a broadcasting facility near Burghead () in Scotland for long wave and medium wave radio transmission that started service on 12 October 1936. The site is owned by Arqiva and houses a long wave radio transmitter on 198 kHz broadcasting BBC Radio 4 and two medium wave radio transmitters, broadcasting BBC Radio 5 Live on 693 kHz and BBC Radio Scotland on 810 kHz. The long wave transmitter is part of a network transmitting on the same frequency, the other transmitters being Droitwich and Westerglen.

The station has three masts, which are all lattice structures with triangular cross section and insulated against ground. The northern of the two large masts is , the southern large mast is tall, while the third one is significantly lower. One of the large masts is used for the medium wave transmissions and the other is used for the long wave transmitter. The third and smallest mast is the backup antenna.

The original building was demolished leaving a much smaller building for the more modern transmitters.

<doc id="1252433" wikidata="Q3817498" url="?curid=1252433" title="Last stand">
<text>A last stand is a military situation in which a body of troops holds a defensive position in the face of overwhelming and virtually insurmountable odds. Troops may make a last stand due to a sense of duty; because they are defending a tactically crucial point; to buy time to enable a trapped army, person, or group of people to escape; due to fear of execution if captured; or to protect their ruler or leader. Last stands loom large in history, as the heroism and sacrifice of the defenders exert a large pull on the public&#x27;s imagination. Some last stands have become a celebrated part of a fighting force&#x27;s or a country&#x27;s history, especially if the defenders accomplished their goals (or, in rare cases, defeated their attackers).

==Tactical significance==
A &quot;last stand&quot; is a last resort tactic, and is chosen because the defending force realizes or believes the benefits of fighting outweigh the benefits of retreat or surrender. This usually arises from strategic or moral considerations, such as staying and fighting to buy time for wounded soldiers or civilians to get to a safe place, leading defenders to conclude that their sacrifice is essential to the greater success of their campaign or cause, as happened at the end of the Battle of Saragarhi. The situation can arise in several ways. One situation is that retreat by the defending force would lead to immediate defeat, usually due to the surrounding geography or shortage of supplies or support, as happened to the Royalist infantry on Wadborough Hill after the Battle of Naseby.


Some military thinkers have cautioned against putting an opposing force into a last stand situation, recognising that trapped men will fight harder. Sun Tzu wrote: . Similarly, they have sometimes suggested deliberately putting their own forces in such a situation, for example by burning boats or bridges that could tempt them to retreat.

The historian Bryan Perrett suggests that although the majority of last stands throughout history have seen the defending force overwhelmed, on rare occasions the outnumbered defenders succeed in their desperate endeavours and live to fight another day, and he lists the Battle of Agincourt and the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift as such engagements.

===Fear of execution===
Troops may fight a last stand if they believe that they will be executed if they surrender. 

In Custer&#x27;s last stand, at the end of the battle, the extent of the soldiers&#x27; resistance to the Lakota and Cheyenne warriors indicated they had few doubts about their prospects for survival if they surrendered. In the end, the hilltop where George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s remaining troops made their last stand made it impossible for Custer&#x27;s men to secure a defensive position. Nevertheless, the soldiers put up their most dogged defence, and died fighting.

During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, by the end of 1942, the Jews trapped in the Warsaw Ghetto learned that the deportations were part of an extermination process, as the deportees were sent to death camps. Many of the remaining Jews decided to revolt. The first armed resistance in the ghetto occurred in January 1943. On 19 April 1943, Passover eve, the Nazis entered the ghetto. The remaining Jews knew that the Nazis would murder them all and they decided to resist the Nazis to the last, rather than surrender.
Another example of a famous last stand was during the First Battle of Mogadishu, where two US 1st SFOD-D snipers, MSG Gary Gordon and SFC Randy Shughart, protected the crash site of helicopter &quot;Super 6-4&quot; and injured pilot Mike Durant, whom they feared would be executed by a crowd of deadly rioters. The two snipers killed 25 and wounded dozens more before they ran out of ammunition and were killed. Their defense, however, allowed Mike Durant to survive long enough for one of the local warlords to take him prisoner. The US was ultimately able to arrange for his release and he was returned home. For their actions, MSG Gordon and SFC Shughart were awarded the Medal of Honor.

===Fear of mistreatment===
People may fight to the death due to the belief that if they surrender they will be tortured or enslaved. At the Siege of Numantia, the inhabitants refused to surrender to the Romans because they were unwilling to become slaves. Japanese soldiers in World War II were told by their superiors that they would be tortured if captured.

===Protecting leader===
In some cases, troops will make a last stand to protect their ruler or leader or commander. 
In the Battle of Hastings in 1066, King Harold II battled the Norman William the Conqueror, who invaded with 7,000 men. After most of the English were killed in the battle, &quot;Harold and his housecarl bodyguard...fought on until an arrow struck the king in the eye.&quot; After Harold died, the housecarl bodyguard made a last stand and &quot;...fought to the death around the body of their dead king.&quot;

When Rome was attacked in 1527 by the army of the Holy Roman Empire under Emperor Charles V, over 20,000 troops stormed the city. The 189 Swiss Guards made a last stand against the massive army by forming a square around St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica to give Pope Clement VII time to escape through secret tunnels, and held the doors until Clement could escape.

At the 1795 battle of Krtsanisi, where the Persian army led by Agha Muhammad Khan defeated the Georgians, the Three Hundred Aragvians – a detachment of the highlanders from the Aragvi valley – loyally fought and died in order to enable the escape of King Heraclius II, for which they are remembered as national heroes and were canonized by the Georgian Church.

The Battle of Pavan Khind involved a rearguard last stand. It took place on July 13, 1660, at a mountain pass in the vicinity of fort Vishalgad, near the city of Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India between the Maratha warrior Baji Prabhu Deshpande and Siddi Masud of Adil Shahi dynasty. 300 Marathas in a rearguard action, held off an attacking force of 10,000 Bijapuris, allowing their king Shivaji to escape to a nearby fort. Ultimately the battle ended with the destruction of the rearguard Maratha forces, and a tactical victory for the Adil Shahi Sultanate, but failed to achieve its strategic objective of capturing the Maratha king Shivaji.

The Battle of Chamkaur occurred in 1704 when the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, and a small force of 40 Sikhs, was attacked by a much larger force of Mughal soldiers at his fort for his refusal to convert to Islam. The forty Sikhs fought to their death, allowing enough time for the Guru to escape the fort and live another day.

===Defending tactically crucial point===
During the second Persian invasion of Greece the Greeks hoped to use the narrow pass of Thermopylae to prevent the vastly large army of the Persians from outflanking them. A Greek force of 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC. The Persian army, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000, arrived at the pass in late August or early September. During the Battle of Thermopylae, the vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history&#x27;s most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. When Leonidas became aware that his force was being outflanked, he dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, fighting to the death. Although the Greeks lost the battle, it did check the advance of the Persian army and the delay helped the Greeks prepare a successful defence and ultimately win the war.

An analogous battle, with reversed roles, would be fought 150 years later, during the invasion of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great: Persians, led by Ariobarzanes of Persis, tried desperately to stop the Macedon offensive towards the capital city Persepolis, blocking the Persian Gates pass.

A similar action to Thermopylae occurred in April 1951 at the Battle of Kapyong when strategic Hill 677 was held by the 700 men of the Canadian 2 PPCLI against two attacking Chinese PVA divisions, encircled and outnumbered by more than 10 to 1 in the immediate battle area, and by about 30 to 1 on the larger battlefield. The PPCLI were exhausted of ammunition and supplies, but the commander Lt. Col. James Riley Stone ordered &quot;no retreat, no surrender&quot;, and called in artillery fire on his own positions when they were overrun. The PVA divisions eventually withdrew with about 5,000 dead and a large number wounded.

===Buying time===
Sometimes, rather than face annihilation at the hands of a pursuing victorious army, a rearguard will be tasked by the commander of the defeated army with hindering the advance of the victorious army. Even if the rearguard is destroyed in a last stand, its sacrifice may buy their commander time to disengage without losing the majority of his army as happened during the Battle of Roncevaux Pass (778), Battle of Tirad Pass (1899), the Battle of Badgam (1947) which proved to be critical to preventing the fall of Srinagar to tribal lashkars.

===Perceived duty===
A last stand may also be the last pitched battle of a war where the position of the defending force is hopeless but the defending force considers it their duty not to surrender until forced to do so, as happened to the last Royalist field army of the First English Civil War at the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold in 1646.

At the Battle of Saragarhi in 1897, the British Indian contingent consisting of 21 Sikh soldiers of the 36th Sikhs, when faced with insurmountable opposition of 10,000 Afghans, decided to make a last stand in accordance with their traditional and religious belief that duty is above all convictions. All 21 Sikhs were killed, together with approximately 600 Afghans.

During the Battle of Okinawa, the Imperial Japanese Navy battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; sailed from the Japanese home islands to join the fight, in which she would have been hopelessly outgunned. As a last ditch effort she would have beached herself on the shore, her crew joining the troops on the island and using her as a stationary gun battery. &quot;Yamato&quot; was sunk on her approach with the loss of some 3,055 crew of her complement of 3,332 after coming under attack from a large strike force of carrier borne aircraft. Given the tactical situation, one battleship accompanied by several smaller vessels with no air support against a fleet of aircraft carriers, the outcome was predictable to military leaders, and ultimately one born out of shame at being questioned by the Emperor over their lack of contribution to the ongoing defensive war effort when the Japanese Army was slowly being annihilated and while air crews were performing suicidal kamikaze missions.

==At the end of a siege==
Before the 20th century, &quot;no quarter was given&quot; if a besieged garrison had refused any offered terms of surrender prior to the attackers breaching the defences, so a last stand was part of the end of many sieges, such as the Battle of the Alamo.

However, since the 1907 IV Hague Convention it is unlawful for an attacking force to kill a garrison if they attempt to surrender, even if it is during the final assault on a fortified position. It is also forbidden to declare that &quot;no quarter will be given&quot;.

==Historical significance==
Last stands loom large in history due to the pull on popular imagination. Historian Nathaniel Philbrick argues:
During World War I, the expression to fight &quot;with one&#x27;s back to the wall&quot; became a widely-known way to refer to making a last stand. The London &quot;Times&quot; reported on April 13, 1918, that General Douglas Haig ordered British troops that &quot;Every position must be held to the last man...With our backs to the wall...each one of us must fight on to the end&quot;.

<doc id="1252436" wikidata="Q370249" url="?curid=1252436" title="Westerglen transmitting station">
<text>The Westerglen transmitting station is a facility for longwave and mediumwave broadcasting established in 1932 at Westerglen Farm, 2 miles (3 km) southwest of Falkirk, Stirlingshire, Scotland ().

Three medium-wave radio programmes are broadcast from the site on frequencies of 810, 909 and 1089, and a long wave service on 198 kHz. The transmitter also carried Absolute Radio on 1215 kHz until Bauer ended all station transmissions on MW in January 2023.

There are three guyed steel lattices mast radiators on the site, which are insulated against the ground. These carry combinations of the above services. There is a shorter fourth mast that carries non-broadcast services.

One of the masts carries the long wave transmission in a synchronised group with the transmitters at Droitwich and Burghead on the same frequency (until 1989 200 kHz, now 198 kHz). This mast is of guyed steel lattice construction with triangular cross-section, and it carries a &#x27;capacity hat&#x27;, which increases the antenna&#x27;s efficiency, at the top.

The site is owned and operated by Arqiva.

The medium-wave broadcast is strong enough to be heard as far south as Cornwall at certain times of the day, and in south-western Germany at night with good conditions.

<doc id="1252437" wikidata="Q257107" url="?curid=1252437" title="James Steuart (economist)">
<text>Sir James Steuart, 3rd Baronet of Goodtrees and 7th Baronet of Coltness (; 21 October 1712 – 26 November 1780), also known as Sir James Steuart Denham, was a prominent Scottish Jacobite and author of &quot;probably the first systematic treatise written in English about economics&quot; and the first book in English with &#x27;political economy&#x27; in the title. He assumed the surname of Denham late in life; he inherited his cousin&#x27;s baronetcy of Coltness in 1773.

==Early life==
He was one of 12 children of Sir James Stewart, 1st Baronet, Solicitor General for Scotland under Queen Anne and George I, and was born in Edinburgh. His mother was Anne Dalrymple, daughter of Lord North Berwick, the Lord President of the Court of Session. After graduating from the University of Edinburgh he was admitted to the Scottish bar at the age of twenty-four.

He then spent some years on the Continent, and while in Rome entered into relations with the Young Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart. He was in Edinburgh in 1745, and so compromised himself that, after the battle of Culloden, he found it necessary to return to the Continent, where he remained until 1763. It was not until 1771 that he was fully pardoned for any complicity he may have had in the rebellion. He died at his family seat, Coltness, in Lanarkshire.

He married Lady Frances Wemyss (1722–1789), younger sister of David Wemyss, Lord Elcho, who played a prominent role in the 1745 Rising. Their son, Sir James Steuart Denham (1744-1839), edited his father&#x27;s works, was a Member of Parliament, and Colonel of the Scots Greys. He ended his career as a General and lived to be ninety-five; on his death, both baronetcies went to a cousin who died in 1851, since when they have been dormant.

===Family===
Steuart was descended from another Sir James Stewart, knight, an Edinburgh merchant and staunch Presbyterian, who supported Charles II in the British Civil Wars of 1642-1660 and who died in 1681, having made enough money to purchase landed estates for his sons; three of those sons were prominent enough to have their families receive the title of Baronet after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. They were: Sir Thomas Steuart of Coltness, the first son; Sir James Steuart of Goodtrees, Lord Advocate, the fourth son; Sir Robert Steuart of Allandale, the youngest of the seven sons. The Lord Advocate, Sir James Steuart of Goodtrees, was his grandfather; his father, also Sir James Steuart, was the eldest son of the Lord Advocate, and rose to be Solicitor General for Scotland.

===Titles===
The 3rd Baronet of Goodtrees, the subject of this article, inherited his baronetcy and estates at the age of fourteen. He eventually acquired much of the possession of his cousins, the senior line of Steuarts. Sir Thomas Steuart of Coltness, had married twice: to Margaret Elliot, his step-mother&#x27;s daughter, and then to Susan Denham, the sister of Sir William Denham, 1st Baronet of Westshield, Master of the Mint for Scotland, and had fourteen sons by them. His eldest son had sold the &quot;estate&quot; and mansion (but not the title) of Coltness to 3rd Baronet of Goodtrees&#x27; father, in 1712. The 3rd Baronet of Goodtrees is, therefore, often called of Coltness, since it was his house.

The 3rd Baronet of Goodtrees, however, eventually sold the estate of Goodtrees after he returned from France. By that time, the last surviving son of Sir Thomas Steuart had inherited the Coltness baronetcy from his father as well as the property and baronetcy of Denham of Westshield through his mother, styling himself Sir Archibald Steuart Denham, Baronet. When Sir Archibald died, in 1773, the baronetcy of Coltness, and the Steuart property, passed to Sir James Steuart; the Denham title and property passed to the last heir of the Denhams, Sir Archibald&#x27;s half-nephew on his mother&#x27;s side, who took the style of Sir William Lockhart Denham. When he died, three years later, in 1776, the Denham baronetcy became extinct; he also left his property, including the estate of Westshield, to Sir James Steuart, who then assumed the name of Denham, although he was not descended from.

For the last four years of his life, therefore, he was Sir James Steuart Denham, Baronet, of Coltness and Westshield. His major book and his posthumous collected works were published as by Sir James Steuart; economic literature also calls him Sir James Steuart Denham.

==Works==

In 1767 Steuart published &quot;An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy&quot;, the first book by a Scottish economist with &#x27;political economy&#x27; in the title, explaining usage of the term as that:

[just as] economy in general [is] the art of providing for all the wants of a family, [so the science of political economy] seeks to secure a certain fund of subsistence for all the inhabitants, to obviate every circumstance which may render it precarious; to provide every thing necessary for supplying the wants of the society, and to employ the inhabitants ... in such manner as naturally to create reciprocal relations and dependencies between them, so as to supply one another with reciprocal wants.

The book was the most complete and systematic survey of the science from the point of view of moderate mercantilism which had appeared in England and indeed the first full-fledged economics treatise to appear anywhere. Also the German philosopher Hegel recognized that book and wrote a comment about it in the year 1799. Although often regarded as part of the Scottish Enlightenment which produced David Hume and Adam Smith, Steuart&#x27;s economics hark back to the earlier Mercantilist era.

Mercantilism was the school of thought that held that a positive balance of trade was of primary importance for any nation and required a ban on the export of gold and silver. This theory led to high protective tariffs to maximize the use of domestic resources, colonial expansion and exclusivity of trade with those colonies. British attempts to follow the mercantilist ideas led to the four Anglo-Dutch navigation wars and the American colonials wars of 1776-1781 and 1812. Additionally in 1815, Britain adopted the high tariff, called the corn laws on all imported wheat at the suggestion of mercantilist advisors. Debate over the corn laws would be harsh and would dominate the political discussion and occupy all British governments until the corn laws were repealed in 1846.

At the level of any individual sales transaction, mercantilism held that profit was developed at the point of the sale. Steuart held that profit was a mere &quot;surcharge&quot; upon alienation (sale) of the commodity. Steuart was not a pure mercantilist, however, he believed in a &quot;scientific form of mercantilism.&quot; Steuart held that all profit arose from the seller &quot;overcharging&quot; the buyer in any single sales transaction. However, Steuart did allow that the &quot;profit&quot; obtained through exchange would &quot;fluctuate&quot; with the rise and/or fall in demand. Still like all good mercantilists, Steuart&#x27;s eye remained on the exchange as the creator of profit and he recognized no value in a commodity before the sale.

Steuart was one of the last representatives of the mercantilist school of economic thought.

Although the work appears to have been well received its impact was overshadowed by Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; that was published only nine years later. Adam Smith never quotes or mentions Steuart&#x27;s book, although he was acquainted with him. Moreover, the attacks on Mercantilism in the Wealth of Nations appear to have been mainly directed against Steuart. As Smith appears to have thought that Steuart&#x27;s conversation was better than his book, he probably wished to keep clear of controversy with him.
Steuart&#x27;s book was received much more favourably a century later by the members of the Historical school of economics.

<text>Web modeling (aka model-driven Web development) is a branch of Web engineering that addresses the specific issues related to design and development of large-scale Web applications. In particular, it focuses on the design notations and visual languages that can be used for the realization of robust, well-structured, usable and maintainable Web applications.

==Models==
Designing a data-intensive website amounts to specifying its characteristics in terms of various orthogonal abstractions. The main models that are involved in complex Web application design are: data structure, content composition, navigation paths, and presentation model. Several languages and notations have been devised for Web application modeling. Among them:

* RMM 
* OOHDM
* ARANEUS 
* STRUDEL 
* TIRAMISU 
* HDM — W2000
* the Interaction Flow Modeling Language (IFML), adopted by the Object Management Group (OMG) in March 2013
* WebML
* Hera
* UML Web Application Extension
* UML-based Web Engineering (UWE) 
* ACE 
* WebArchitect 
* OO-H

One of the main discussion venues for this discipline is the Model-Driven Web Engineering Workshop (MDWE) held yearly in conjunction with the International Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE) conference.

<text>Pierre Basile (died 6 April 1199), also identified in some sources as Bertran de Gourdon and John Sabroz, was a Limousin boy famous for shooting King Richard I of England with a crossbow at the siege of Châlus-Chabrol on 25 March 1199. Richard, who had removed some of his chainmail, was not mortally wounded by Basile&#x27;s bolt directly; however the wound resulted in gangrene, of which Richard later died.

Basile was one of only two knights defending the castle and was renowned amongst the English attackers for his appearance: the castle was so ill-prepared for King Richard&#x27;s siege that Basile was forced to defend the ramparts with cobbled-together armour and a makeshift shield constructed from a frying pan, much to the mirth of the English besiegers. It is perhaps this dismissive attitude that led to Richard taking little precaution on the day he was shot.

Upon wounding Richard, Basile was captured, after which he explained that he had sought vengeance against the king for killing his father and his two brothers. Although there are numerous variations of the story&#x27;s details, it is generally agreed that King Richard ordered that Basile suffer no punishment (and, in fact, that he be paid 100 shillings). Not much is known about Basile&#x27;s fate afterwards, but according to one account the mercenary soldier Mercadier disregarded Richard&#x27;s orders after his death and Basile was flayed alive and then hanged.

&quot;Peter Basili&quot; or &quot;Pierre Basile&quot; is not believed to be his real name, especially since it contrasts with the names &quot;John Sabroz&quot; and &quot;Bertran de Gourdon&quot; as the name of Richard&#x27;s killer. In truth, it is considered unlikely that contemporary chroniclers knew his real name.

<text>The World Wide Web has become a major delivery platform for a variety of complex and sophisticated enterprise applications in several domains. In addition to their inherent multifaceted functionality, these Web applications exhibit complex behaviour and place some unique demands on their usability, performance, security, and ability to grow and evolve. However, a vast majority of these applications continue to be developed in an ad hoc way, contributing to problems of usability, maintainability, quality and reliability. While Web development can benefit from established practices from other related disciplines, it has certain distinguishing characteristics that demand special considerations. In recent years, there have been developments towards addressing these considerations.

Web engineering focuses on the methodologies, techniques, and tools that are the foundation of Web application development and which support their design, development, evolution, and evaluation. Web application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software, information systems, or computer application development.

Web engineering is multidisciplinary and encompasses contributions from diverse areas: systems analysis and design, software engineering, hypermedia/hypertext engineering, requirements engineering, human-computer interaction, user interface, data engineering, information science, information indexing and retrieval, testing, modelling and simulation, project management, and graphic design and presentation. Web engineering is neither a clone nor a subset of software engineering, although both involve programming and software development. While Web Engineering uses software engineering principles, it encompasses new approaches, methodologies, tools, techniques, and guidelines to meet the unique requirements of Web-based applications.

== As a discipline ==
Proponents of Web engineering supported the establishment of Web engineering as a discipline at an early stage of Web. Major arguments for Web engineering as a new discipline are:

* Web-based Information Systems (WIS) development process is different and unique.
* Web engineering is multi-disciplinary; no single discipline (such as software engineering) can provide a complete theory basis, body of knowledge and practices to guide WIS development.
* Issues of evolution and lifecycle management when compared to more &#x27;traditional&#x27; applications.
* Web-based information systems and applications are pervasive and non-trivial. The prospect of Web as a platform will continue to grow and it is worth being treated specifically.

However, it has been controversial, especially for people in other traditional disciplines such as software engineering, to recognize Web engineering as a new field. The issue is how different and independent Web engineering is, compared with other disciplines.

<text>Jacob Charles White (born 13 December 1963 as Jacob Westerduin) is a professional rugby union coach and former coach of the South African national team – the &quot;Springboks&quot; – whom he coached to victory in 2007 Rugby World Cup and the 2004 Tri Nations. White also coached the Under-21 Springbok side to victory in the Under-21 World Cup in 2002. He was coach of the Brumbies in the Super Rugby from 2012, but resigned with two years remaining on his contract in 2013 to return to South Africa. On returning to South Africa, he coached the Sharks for a single season, explaining he wanted to seek international opportunities. This arose in a technical role with the Tongan national team. After assisting Tonga in their 3 Test European Tour in 2014, White was announced as Montpellier&#x27;s new boss, overseeing all coaching aspects for the club.

On 24 October 2011, he was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame, alongside other World Cup-winning head coaches and captains through the 2007 World Cup.

==Coaching resume up to 2004==
Jake White was born in Johannesburg and attended Jeppe High School for Boys where he played in the First XV. He changed his surname to White when he was a teenager after his mother remarried. He began his coaching career as a high school rugby coach at Parktown Boys&#x27; High School&#x27;s First XV before returning to his old school as a teacher and coach of the school&#x27;s First XV. White&#x27;s success with the school team resulted in him being appointed as provincial schools coach. He coached various under-19 and under-21 sides before assisting Springbok squad preparations by compiling video analysis for them. From 1997 to 1999 he was a technical advisor to Nick Mallet, being part of the 17 Test winning record by the Springboks. In 1999 he was the assistant coach to the U-21 Springboks, coached by Eric Sauls and captained by John Smit. While assistant coach of the U-21 they won the SANZAR tournament in Argentina, beating England, Ireland, Wales, Australia, France enroute to the finals and then beat New Zealand in the final. From 2000-2001 he was an assistant to Harry Viljoen at the Springboks. By this time he was well known for his technical prowess in rugby circles, and he lived up to his reputation by coaching the under-21 Springbok side to a victory in the U-21 Rugby Union World Cup in 2002.

==Springbok coach==

White was appointed as head coach of the national team in early 2004 following South Africa&#x27;s poor performance at the 2003 World Cup and the Kamp Staaldraad scandal. His first move was to install John Smit as captain, which drew a substantial amount of criticism, despite the success they achieved leading the Springboks.

===2004===
White started his Springbok coaching career with a 2–0 series win over Ireland, followed by wins over Wales and a combined Pacific Islanders team in the 2004 June rugby union tests. He then proceeded to coach South Africa to their first Tri-Nations trophy since 1998. Soon after the 2004 Tri Nations victory, White&#x27;s contract was extended to after the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

In the November Internationals, South Africa attempted a Grand Slam, beating Wales and Scotland, but losing to Ireland and England. They concluded the Tour with a win over Argentina in Buenos Aires.

The Springbok resurgence was recognised with a sweep of the major International Rugby Board Awards. The Boks were named &quot;Team of the Year&quot;, White &quot;Coach of the Year&quot;, and flanker Schalk Burger &quot;Player of the Year&quot;.

===2005===
In the 2005 Tri Nations Series, the Springboks and All Blacks each won 3 tests, but New Zealand won the Championship on bonus points.

===2006===
The 2006 season got off to a strong start with a 36–16 win over a confident Scotland contingent; fresh off the back of beating both France and England and finishing third in the Six Nations of that year. This optimism was soon replaced by intense apprehension and frustration over the following months as the Boks narrowly beat the same Scotland side the following week as Springbok kingpin Schalk Burger suffered a career-threatening neck injury in the very same game. A disappointing loss to France in Cape Town left the side bereft of confidence ahead of a Tri-Nations opener against Australia. A member of the conditioning team stated that the Boks no longer felt they were in a comfort zone going into the Tri-Nations.

Perhaps the lowest point in Springbok history, alongside the 2002 drubbing at the hands of England; the Springboks were dealt a record defeat to Australia by 49 points to nil. The matched was marred by very inaccurate play, punctuated by flyhalf Jaco Van Der Westhyzen&#x27;s purported &#x27;drop kick&#x27; just outside his 22 after fumbling the ball. Larkham led his charges magnificently in exposing the Springboks defensive frailties and shattering any chance of a Bok revival.

A week later and the Boks put up a much stronger showing against New Zealand. Though the Boks frustrating ill-discipline allowed for the All Blacks to tally a total of seven penalties to pull away comfortably. Pressure was beginning to mount at this point, and so too injuries. The Boks gave New Zealand a real working over at the breakdown and dominated the All Black line-out throughout; but the aforementioned ill-discipline and the sublime Dan Carter were too much to contain in the end. Bakkies Botha injured his calf on the eve of this test requiring surgery and joined stalwart Schalk Burger as a long-term injury.

Jake rallied his troops in the Springbok&#x27;s final match of their away tour in the newly expanded Tri-Nations. The Springboks looked set to seal their first win of the competition until a late try by Mat Rogers allowed for Mortlock to score the winning conversion and compound Bok woes. The loss splintered morale and soon political turmoil would engulf the team as Jake White&#x27;s tenure was put into question. Supposed secret meetings in England and the issue of transformation put considerable strain on the team as a meeting with the powerful All Blacks loomed later in August. Numerous journalists in South Africa with strong ties to Cheeky Watson campaigned viciously for the removal of Jake. This a knee-jerk reaction to Jake&#x27;s refusal to play Luke Watson and name him captain of the side.

With the Boks now on home soil they had time to reflect on their failings and regroup. Despite this brief reprieve the beleaguered Boks seemed to undo their good work in the previous two tests in exhibiting yet another poor defensive display that harkened back to the 49–0 loss in their opening game. A burst of three tries inside ten minutes allowed New Zealand to dominate the game and confirm their status as the preeminent force in world rugby. A strong fightback by the Boks was not enough as they were held at arm&#x27;s length and masterfully picked off.

Backs firmly planted to the wall the Springboks were determined to end their campaign strongly and salvage some measure of respectability. Jake seemed to find the right balance in the back row and the Boks stubbornly defeated New Zealand in a disciplined and accurate display at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium. The Boks rolled up to Ellis Park the following week to right the wrongs of their heartbreaking loss to Australia in their final away match; they provided another very strong showing with yet another disciplined and accurate display. The standout feature of this match was the manner in which Solly Tyibilika outplayed his more fancied opposite George Smith – regarded by many as the greatest fetcher of his era.

With back-to-back wins over their Tri-Nations rivals Jake White decided to rest the remainder of his front line players for the up-coming End of Year Tour. They started their campaign against Ireland in celebration of 100 years of Bok rugby. The Irish however had other ideas and put away three tries that exposed the poor defence of Pierre Spies in particular and Bryan Habana out of position at 13. Spies was twice caught charging out of the line and the Irish swiftly punished that opening each time. The Springboks, fielding a largely experimental side, fought hard as Habana and debutant François Steyn dotted down in the second half. That comeback was roundly ended by Horgan after O&#x27;Driscoll expertly put him away to seal the game.

Next up was a two test encounter against England at fortress Twickenham. The Springboks had not beaten England since the Spring Tour of 2000 where the Boks won 18–13. England exacted revenge a week later and had built a period of dominance spanning six years. Even more disconcerting was that the Boks had not won at Twickenham since 1997; this leaving the Boks with a nine-year hoodoo to break. The Boks dominated England for much of the first test and seemed certain of victory until a late try by Phil Vickery gave England the result. A key turning point in the game was the injury to Butch James. His replacement, André Pretorius failed to deliver the steadiness Butch provided and missed an important penalty. However, the Boks gained confidence from this display and relished their second chance to redeem themselves.

Unlike the first test, England got off to a strong start with stinging attacks that left the Boks defending for most of the first 30 minutes. In fact, it wasn&#x27;t until the 26th minute that the Boks launched their first serious attack started by nuggety scrumhalf Ricky Januarie. England finally scored on the half-hour mark, but a missed conversion signalled the end of their dominance. The Boks got to work dominating the English with bruising defence, probing tactical kicks and set piece superiority. Burly prop CJ Van Der Linde punctuating the Bok&#x27;s dominance in brushing aside two defenders as he burst his way through England&#x27;s defensive line and dotting down for a crucial score. André Pretorius nailed three drop-goals which left the English on the ropes. As England became more desperate and lost for invention, the game slipped further away from them. The curse of the Red Rose was final lifted in arguably the most important victory of the 2006 campaign. The result unfortunately ended the tenure of Andy Robinson as England dubiously replaced him with Brian Ashton. Jake White however just managed to stave off his critics and end what was an emotionally exhausting season.

The final analysis was that this was a year of growth as much as it was a disappointing lost opportunity. Injuries to Schalk Burger (broken neck), Bakkies Botha (calf surgery), Jean De Villiers (cracked rib), Bryan Habana (cracked rib), Butch James (groin and knee), André Pretorius (groin), Joe Van Niekerk (C5 &amp; C6 vertebrae), Jacques Cronje (cracked rib), Danie Rossouw (hamstring), Juan Smith (left quadriceps), Eddie Andrews (back), BJ Botha (back surgery), CJ Van Der Linde (Leg), Gurthro Steenkamp (broken hand), Pedrie Wannenburg (wrist surgery), Marius Joubert (fractured hand) among other lesser injuries stretched the Bok&#x27;s depth to its limit. The blessing was that it allowed the Boks to break their reliance on certain individuals and expand their depth in blooding new players and testing new combinations. François Steyn was undoubtedly the find of the season alongside the elusive Ruan Pienaar. Jake also found depth in Wynand Olivier and Pierre Spies; the former being used extensively in plugging gaps left by injuries in the backline. Jake lamented the many lost opportunities of this campaign but was optimistic about the various changes they made to their defensive patterns and saw it as an important learning curve ahead of the World Cup the following year.

===2007: World Champions and &quot;Resignation&quot;===

The Springboks could not have started their campaign any better as they utterly demolished England in back-to-back tests. Again, this being very important in the context of their World Cup campaign, as they faced the World Champions in the same group. England must however be credited for their resolve in the second test where a Jonny Wilkinson led side actually led the game at half-time. South Africa were guilty of sloppy play in the opening 40 minutes which was met by stern midfield defence by the English. A powerful scrum aided England in securing a measure of dominance. Fresh from the break however South Africa stepped up and rampantly tore into their guests. This culminated in two 50 pointers in as many weeks. The fans suddenly began to believe in their side again. Then came more political meddlings to sour the mood. Oregan Hoskins – President of SARU – proceeded to override Jake White in the selection of Luke Watson as an addition to the 45-man squad submitted by Jake to the South African Rugby Union. Luke Watson went on to represent South Africa in ten tests, his first and solitary test of this particular year being in the following Samoan test at Ellis Park. In a game that was well suited to the fetcher Watson did very little to justify his position in the team. His performance was disjointed and substandard. This prompted Jake to reject him authoritatively – something Jake&#x27;s successor, Peter de Villiers would do the following year after similarly poor performances. The Springboks won this test convincingly on the scoreboard but Samoa were not to be beaten without a fight in a typical arm-wrestle of a test.

With the Spring Tour successfully negotiated the Boks embarked on their Tri-Nations opener. They began their campaign at home against Australia in a powerful display. They attacked the fringes with strong carries by their big ball carriers and tied up the Australians before attacking wide. Guilty of missing several opportunities they did however leave victory late as the audacious François Steyn blasted over two monstrous drop-goals to seal the result. This set up a tense encounter with arch-rivals New Zealand. The Boks were on course to seal the result before Graham Henry unloaded his bench. His fresh reserves gave New Zealand a much stronger finish which resulted in a match winning try by New Zealand flyer Joe Rokocoko.

Following this test Jake announced that he would be resting his key players for the remainder of the competition. This was met with staunch criticism from their SANZAR partners which went so far as John O&#x27;Neill – Head of the Australian Rugby Union – castigating South Africa for not fielding full strength sides on their away leg. O&#x27;Neill also said the Springboks had cost Australian Rugby at least 10,000 paying customers at the test in Sydney because of their decision to leave 20 of their best players in South Africa. O&#x27;Neill was incensed by comments by Springboks coach Jake White, who said the injury to stand-in Springboks captain Bobby Skinstad justified his decision to rest leading players such as Victor Matfield, Schalk Burger and Bryan Habana. &quot;Now you know why I didn&#x27;t bring those other guys here,&quot; White said. &quot;I could be sitting here with my front-line players out for six months.&quot; O&#x27;Neill retorted: &quot;Some of the stuff Jake White has said are the most extraordinary of contradictions. He is basically saying that because Bobby Skinstad has a broken rib, that supports his decision to leave all the players behind. He is basically saying that his only objective this year is the World Cup. He has made it clear that whatever he has to do in between – so be it.

That said, the makeshift Springbok side made a mockery of their critics as they led a full strength Australian side 17–0 after 40 minutes. Wikus van Heerden powering over and Breyton Paulse latching onto a wide pass by Nathan Sharpe. Hougaard missed two kickable penalties however. This was Stephen Larkham and George Gregan&#x27;s final game in Australia; an emotional occasion. Thus they were not to be beaten without a fight. Australia had an attacking line-out inside South Africa&#x27;s 22, they employed a deceptive play which appeared to be a forward drive with Gregan standing afar but was instead a ruse which had Larkham cut the Boks and send Mark Gerrard over for their opening points. From here the Australians showed just how dangerous their back division could be and scored two further tries to escape an embarrassing defeat and send off their legendary heroes with a victory. The Boks went into the final game of the tournament seemingly without a hope of winning. The All Blacks were deemed far too powerful for this makeshift team. That said they decided to take the fight to their hosts from the first second as JP Pietersen fielded a kick-off and ran right through several would-be tacklers. They played with greater endeavour than what was to be expected. The half-time interval saw New Zealand fractionally ahead 6–3. New Zealand would not see their first try until eleven minutes from time when Rokocoko&#x27;s flick pass found Leonard. This broke the Boks and two further tries were scored to add gloss to the final score, Carter dotting down after the hooter had sounded. It was noted that the Boks rush defence frustrated the All Blacks and prevented them from executing wider attacking plays. Breyton Paulse in particular was adept at cutting off their outside backs and limiting the All Blacks. Had Hougaard not missed two vital kicks the result may not have been so comfortable.

The Boks unfortunately ended bottom of the table, but had displayed great strength in depth and resolve. Later Eddie Jones would join the Bok camp in a consultancy capacity. He revealed that he worked on the linkage between 9 and 10 and the motion of the ball. It added a little more variety to the Boks in what was an otherwise powerful Springbok side with great skills and considerable fitness. The latter being a part of Jake&#x27;s plan for the World Cup which was timed perfectly.

The Boks went into the World Cup off the back of two strong wins against Namibia and Scotland. Scotland providing very stern opposition. Captain John Smit remarked that the opening game against Samoa was the most physical he had ever played. The Samoans were full of running and put considerable strain on the Bok&#x27;s defensive line. They scored the first try through Gavin Williams to bring the score to 9–7. It was an intense arm-wrestle throughout the first half in spite of Montgomery and Habana&#x27;s tries which gave South Africa a 21–7 half-time lead. The second half started in much the same manner it ended; with Samoa lashing into the Boks. Jean De Villiers was taken off with a torn bicep and replaced by Frans Steyn. Frans&#x27; impact was immense and his first touch of the ball was a break out of his own 22 that sent JP Pietersen down the touchline in a breathtaking attack. His physicality in defence of his channel and elusive power on attack seemed to lift the Springboks. He provided the assured authority that Jean was never able to provide. This combined with the Boks&#x27; superior set-pieces set the tone for a ruthless demolition of Samoa. The game ended with eight tries to the Boks, a cruel end to what was a heroic showing by the Samoans. The result drew the attention of the rest of the teams in the competition and it was clear the Boks had rolled up with intent. Bryan Habana&#x27;s quartet of tries reflective of the Bok&#x27;s willingness to attack with efficient ruthlessness.

Their next encounter was a crucial clash with World Champions England. England, now on a three-game losing streak to the Boks, were on the ropes after a scrappy and poor showing against the USA. It took no longer than four minutes before Du Preez sent Juan Smith over for a try. The Boks dominated their opposition, displaying a tactically astute game plan. Du Preez was the mastermind and he orchestrated South Africa&#x27;s next try as he regathered a loose ball and tore through England&#x27;s defence; he sent JP Pietersen over for his first try of the evening and later in the second half broke away on the blindside to put JP Pietersen away for his second. This victory set the tone for South Africa&#x27;s triumph. They employed a strong tactical kicking game backed-up by stout defence and the best line-out in the world. With a clinical counter-attacking game the Boks were able to vary their approach and ended the year the number one ranked team in the world. The Springboks&#x27; final pool match was against the US in Montpellier. They ran in nine tries to two to win 64–15 and finish on top of Pool A. The only downside was a knee injury to prop BJ Botha, which would rule him out for the rest of the World Cup. White was pleased with his team&#x27;s efforts:
What we wanted to accomplish was to get some structure and continuity to our game. Some of the tries we scored were very pleasing. I don&#x27;t think the US are as weak as the scoreline suggests. The most important thing was that we put things together on a game day. We haven&#x27;t been executing them that well so far, but I was happy with the way we kept the ball alive.

Further accolades were to follow; the day after the World Cup final victory, White was named IRB Coach of the Year for the second time.
On 29 October, barely a week after the Springboks&#x27; World Cup success, the South African Rugby Union (SARU) confirmed that White had not re-applied for the position of Springboks coach and would therefore not be considered for the role. Although White&#x27;s contract expired on 31 December, he was angry with the way the SARU had acted, stating that his contract did not require him to apply and that he had asked for time to consider his options, but had not been granted his request.
Shortly after finishing as Springbok coach, White released his autobiography, &quot;In Black and White, The Jake White Story&quot;. As of February 2008, the book had sold 210,000 copies in South Africa, outselling even &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;.

==Post-Springbok coaching career==

After leading the Springboks to the Rugby World Cup glory Jake White took on a role working at the International Rugby Board assisting with their technical committee. He performed this role from 2008 to 2012.

He also held positions in the IRB as a consultant, as well as in the South African Rugby Legends Association&#x27;s upliftment programmes for underprivileged people.

===Brumbies 2012–13===
The Brumbies finished first in the Australian conference with ten wins, and third on the overall table. The Reds had also won ten games, but the Brumbies had a greater points difference. They faced the Cheetahs at home in Canberra in a semi-final qualifier, and survived a last-minute scare when Riaan Smit&#x27;s conversion attempt – which if successful would have forced the match into extra-time – hit the upright, the final score 15–13. The Brumbies then travelled to Pretoria to face the Bulls at Loftus Versfeld in the semi-final. The Bulls had won 22 of their previous 24 games at Loftus, including all five finals.
The Brumbies started well and led at half-time 16–11. But the Bulls were determined to keep their unblemished finals record at home intact, and worked their way back into the game to lead 23–19 with 14 minutes to go. Then Bulls captain Dewald Potgieter turned down three opportunities to score penalty goals, instead opting each time to go for a try, presumably to put the game beyond the Brumbies&#x27; reach. In the 78th minute, the Brumbies seized their chance when fly-half Matt To&#x27;omua made an incisive break and passed to Tevita Kuridrani who touched down to help give the Brumbies a 26–23 lead. There was still time for one last kick-off, but the Bulls lost possession, enabling the Brumbies to kick the ball into touch and celebrate a victory which White described as &quot;the greatest the Brumbies have ever had&quot;. The Brumbies then had to travel to Hamilton where they would have to face the Chiefs in the 2013 Super Rugby Final. The Brumbies had led the match 9–0 with 20 minutes gone, however a burst of penalties saw the Chiefs even the score by the 31st minute. A try late on in the first half by Christian Lealiifano saw the Brumbies lead 16–9 at half time. Early on in the second half, Lealiifano booted a further two penalties to reach their final score of 22, with Lealiifano having scored all the points. But two tries conceded at the 63rd and 67th minute by Liam Messam and Robbie Robinson saw the home side lead 24–22 with 10 minutes to go. Despite a strong attack by the Brumbies, the Chiefs defence remained strong and the match finished 27–22.

In 2013 Brumbies beat British &amp; Irish Lions 14–12 during their Australian tour, which was the first Lions loss to a non-international side since 2005, when they lost to Māori All Blacks, though they had a draw with Emerging Springboks in 2009.

After a successful stint with the Brumbies, White was believed to be a strong contender for the Wallabies head coaching role when Robbie Deans resigned. However, he was beaten to the role by fellow Super Rugby coach Ewen McKenzie. Surprisingly, after just two months after leading the Brumbies to second in the Super Rugby, White resigned from his post at the Brumbies explaining he wanted to return home to South Africa. On 7 October 2013, White was appointed director of rugby at the Sharks, replacing Brendan Venter.

===Sharks 2014 ===
One of White&#x27;s first actions as the Sharks&#x27; director of rugby was to establish Pat Lambie at fly-half for the upcoming Super Rugby season, saying that he felt that the talented Springbok utility back had been &quot;messed around&quot; with enough.
White also announced that François Steyn would play at inside centre. The decision was partly to provide Steyn some much-needed stability, but also because he felt that playing Steyn at inside centre would help Lambie:
With Frans at 12, you will see a much better Pat Lambie. Even at 80 percent, Frans is a better player than most people at 100 percent. We will do whatever we can to make those two the best 10–12 combination in the competition. White&#x27;s next move was to restructure the Sharks&#x27; on-field leadership; he replaced Keegan Daniel with Bismarck du Plessis as captain, and appointed Lambie, Odwa Ndungane and Jean Deysel as vice-captains.
White&#x27;s first game in charge of the Sharks was a friendly on 25 January with Saracens F.C. in London. On 15 February, the Sharks started their 2014 Super Rugby campaign in the best way possible with a bonus-point 31–16 victory against arch-rivals the Bulls in Durban.
But the Sharks&#x27; first major hurdle of the season came during the re-match against the Bulls in Pretoria on 22 March. Up to that stage, the Sharks had been undefeated. In addition to losing the match 23–19, their starting halves combination was injured early. Pat Lambie was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season with a torn bicep tendon, and Cobus Reinach fractured his hand, which would cause him to miss eight weeks.

White went on to coach the Sharks to top of the South African conference, finishing third overall in the table. They had to host the Highlanders in the quarter-finals, where for much of the match, the home side led, finishing 31–27. Unfortunately for the Sharks, they had to travel to Christchurch to face the Crusaders who were favourite to win the competition. The Sharks lost the match 38–6, conceding 5 tries, 4 of which came in the second half. The result came as a massive surprise for some, since the Sharks had the best defence in the competition in the normal season.

Like with the Brumbies, two months after leading the Sharks to that Semi-final, White resigned as Director of Rugby, to pursue an international role ahead of the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

===Tonga===
On 13 October 2014, White joined Tonga as a member of the backroom staff, and acted as a technical advisor for head coach Mana Otai for the Test Tour of Europe. White and Otai led Tonga to 2 from 3 wins during their 2014 European Tour. The tour began with a 23–9 victory over Georgia, which included a late surge off tries during the closing quarter to secure the win. The following week, Tonga kept their 100% win rate intact against the United States, winning 40–12 in Gloucester. The &#x27;Ikale Tahi were praised heavily for their defensive abilities in their opening two matches of their tour, keeping Georgia tryless completely and the United States tryless in the second half. But Tonga were also praised for their new attacking flair, and with hand in ball, with some people expecting a first-ever clean sweep on European tour heading into the final match against Scotland. Jake White had believed to be the main inputter into this new structure. Despite the first half being a close 14–12 at half time, Scotland ran away with the match in the second half, scoring a further 3 tries to win 37–12.

Mana Otai had hoped to keep White on board for the World Cup, and until December 2014, there had still been no official announcement on White&#x27;s future with Tonga.

===Montpellier===
On 30 December, Jake White was announced as the new boss for French club Montpellier, where he would oversee all coaching aspects for the club. This came after a poor run of results in both the 2014–15 Top 14 season and the 2014–15 European Rugby Champions Cup. Already Montpellier&#x27;s forwards coach Mario Ledesma had been sacked, with backs coach Stéphane Glas also tipped to be getting the boot. However, on White announcement, Glas would remain at the club with former Springbok Shaun Sowerby joining the backroom staff as the new forwards coach. Fabien Galthié who was in charge of the club before White, will still remain with the club but it is still unclear what role he will play in the new set-up.

&quot;...He also held positions in the IRB as a consultant, as well as in the South African Rugby Legends Association&#x27;s upliftment programmes for underprivileged people&quot;

<doc id="1252452" wikidata="Q3560691" url="?curid=1252452" title="Virginia and Truckee Railroad">
<text>The Virginia and Truckee Railroad (stylized as Virginia &amp; Truckee Railroad) is a privately owned heritage railroad, headquartered in Virginia City, Nevada. Its private and publicly owned route is long. When first constructed in the 19th century, it was a commercial freight railroad which was originally built to serve the Comstock Lode mining communities of northwestern Nevada. 

At its height, the railroad&#x27;s route ran from Reno south to the state capital at Carson City. In Carson City, the mainline split into two branches. One branch continued south to Minden, while the other branch traveled east to Virginia City. The first section from Virginia City to Carson City was constructed beginning in 1869 to haul ore, lumber and supplies for the Comstock Lode silver mines. After the federal and state governments began competing with the railroad with highways that operated at a loss, the railroad was abandoned in 1950 after years of declining revenue, constrained by the requirement to turn a profit. Much of the track was pulled up and sold, along with the remaining locomotives and cars. In the 1970s, with public interest in historic railroads on the rise, efforts began to rebuild the line. The portion from Virginia City to Gold Hill has been rebuilt by private interests, and is operated separately from a portion from Gold Hill to Mound House, that was rebuilt with public funding and private donations.

Prior to the building of the Virginia &amp; Truckee Railroad, the lower grade ore that was mined was dumped, rather than processed, because of the high cost of shipping it to the mills by wagon. The railroad brought lower cost transportation ($2.00 per ton for transporting ore, versus the previous $3.50 per ton by wagon), which resulted in the leaner ores going to the mills, rather than to waste. The cost of lumber shipped in for mine timbers and other construction also dropped significantly as a result of low-cost rail transportation. Bank of California agent William Sharon estimated that the railroad would produce a savings of nearly a million dollars a year on freight charges.

==History==

===Comstock Lode===
Gold was discovered in Nevada (then western Utah Territory) in spring 1850, by a company of Mormon emigrants on their way to the California Gold Rush. These early travelers only lingered in Nevada until they could cross the Sierras. By 1858 prospectors were soon permanently camping in the area around what is now Virginia City. In 1859, gold was found in outcroppings in the hills and canyons just outside what is now Virginia City. Among the gold ore in these outcroppings were bluish chunks of silver ore which clogged the rockers. Silver was not recognized in this form, so initially, it was overlooked in favor of the gold, and later found to be quite valuable. This was the first of the silver from what came to be called the Comstock Lode.

Numerous mills appeared along the Carson River from Dayton to Brunswick (toward Eagle Valley (Carson City)) to process the ore from the Comstock Lode. Low interest rates enticed mine and mill owners alike to finance through the bank. Many of these mills and some mines were built with loans from the Bank of California, whose Nevada agent, William Sharon, would foreclose upon the mines or mills when their owners defaulted on payments. The bank gradually came into possession of many important mining and ore-processing facilities. Sharon, along with business partners Darius Ogden Mills and William Ralston, formed the bank-owned Union Mill &amp; Mining Company to process the ore from the mills that had been foreclosed upon.

Initially, the Comstock Lode was a boon for the Virginia City area, as the city grew to over 25,000 inhabitants at its height, and was among the largest and wealthiest towns in the West. However, from the beginning, the costs to transport Comstock ore to the mills from points on the Lode (as well as to return wood and lumber to supply the mines) became so great that many mines were closed, and only the higher quality ores were worth processing in the mines that stayed open. Being in control of mines and mills with his partners, Sharon realized that a cheap form of transportation between the mines, the mills, and the cities would allow the banks holdings to be more profitable.

===Early years===
There were many propositions starting as early as 1861 for railroads to service the area and decrease costs. Sharon eventually (with the addition of $500,000 in county bonds to move the railroad, equal to $ today), envisioned a railroad to run from Virginia City, through Gold Hill where the first of the Comstock Lode was mined, passing the mills along the river, and ending at the state capital, Carson City. When finished, this route would cover , descend of elevation and have so many curves as to make 17 full circles in the thirteen and a half miles from the river to Virginia City. Ground was broken on February 18, 1869, two miles below Gold Hill on American Flats when grading crews went to work. There were seven tunnels on the line, requiring 2–5 months each to hole through, and an 85 ft tall, 500 ft long trestle built over the Crown Point ravine. The first track was laid and the ceremonial first spike driven on September 28, 1869 by superintendent Henry M. Yerington, with the first passenger train pulling into Virginia City on Jan. 29, 1870. The railroad served as a reliable connection for residents of Carson City and Virginia City. By December 1869, special rail cars were outfitted to bring theater patrons from Carson City to Virginia City for Piper&#x27;s Opera House presentations.

Named the Lyon, engine No. 1 was one of three 2-6-0&#x27;s purchased from H.J. Booth by the fledgling railroad, along with engine No. 2, the Ormsby, and No. 3, the Storey. The railroad placed orders for five locomotives, three from H.J. Booth and two from Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The first three of the five original locomotives purchased were named after Nevada counties (Lyon, Ormsby, and Storey). The last two of the five, built by Baldwin, were engine No. 4, the Virginia, and engine No. 5, the Carson, named after Nevada cities. The Booth and Baldwin locomotives were disassembled at Reno on a Central Pacific siding. The &quot;Lyon&quot;, &quot;Ormsby&quot; and &quot;Storey&quot; were hauled to Carson via Washoe Valley and reassembled in the shops. The &quot;Virginia&quot; and &quot;Carson&quot; were hauled up Geiger Grade from Reno to Virginia City and then reassembled. They had the distinction of being the first locomotives in Virginia City. The Lyon, with the distinction of being the first locomotive for the V&amp;T RR, was also the engine that pulled the work train, arriving in Virginia City on January 28, 1870, and completing the initially planned route. The line was opened in its entirety on Jan. 29 with regular passenger service starting on Feb. 1, 1870

On Nov. 12, 1869 V&amp;T Engine no. 2, an H.J. Booth 2-6-0, pulled the first car of revenue for the company from Carson City to Gold Hill, a flat car loaded with lumber for the Crown Point Company. This milestone was also marked by the opening of the Crown Point Ravine trestle and the first crossing of the work train, engine No. 1 plus four cars, followed closely behind by engine No. 2, plus four cars (1 revenue). It is assumed that from the 12th to the 18th the railroad laid track (spurs) to service the local mines of Gold Hill, for without the track, the railroad could not get cars in to load. However, no sources have been found that reference this. On Nov. 18, 1869, engine No. 1 hauled the railroads first revenue train of ore from the Yellow Jacket mine. By Dec. 21, regular scheduled trains were running between Gold Hill and Carson City, hauling wood and lumber up the hill and ore back down to the mills.

The chapter above from the &quot;Gold Hill Daily News&quot; states that low grade ore was valued at $26–$28 to the ton. It also states that (after transportation and milling costs, or &quot;yield under the stamps&quot;) the result would be around $17 to the ton coming back to the mine. Milling rates were about $7/ton. Based on an average of $27/ton of low grade ore, that left a freight cost of $3/ton. That one ton of ore could pay the wages for three experienced underground miners and a carpenter for a day, so the mines could cover their costs selling the low-grade ore to pay expenses and reap the profits from the high grade. With the coming of the railroad, a reduction in freight rates for lumber by almost half occurred, and the railroad could haul more material by the trainload, so mining activity increased, creating more business for the railroad. Sharon&#x27;s idea of low cost transportation paid off.

The railroad cost $1,750,000 to build, not including the cost of rolling stock or buildings. The V&amp;T ran 3045 trains per day at the height of the Big Bonanza from Carson to Virginia City and Gold Hill. Still primarily a freight railroad, there were 22 locomotives and 361 freight cars in use at the peak of the Virginia and Truckee operations (1876 &amp; 1877), which carried over 400,000 tons of freight per month. This was in contrast to a mere 10 passenger cars.

===Expansion and prosperity===
In late 1871, a line extension to Reno was begun, to connect the V&amp;T line with the Central Pacific Railroad. This would allow through train service between Virginia City and San Francisco. Construction began with track being installed at the Reno end of the line. The first train to ran end-to-end from Virginia City to Reno on August 24, 1872, pulled appropriately by the road&#x27;s newest locomotive at the time, No. 11, the &quot;Reno.&quot; This milestone marked the completion of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. In 1875, the railroad was earning a profit of over $100,000 per month and started paying annual dividends of $360,000 (or $30,000/month) to investors.

In 1880, the V&amp;T built a three-foot narrow gauge railroad called the Carson &amp; Colorado (C&amp;C). The railroad ran from Mound House, just east of Carson City, to the southern part of California, and supposedly to the Colorado River where new mining claims were being struck. This never did pan out, and by 1891 those claim sites were all but forgotten. A liability to the V&amp;T, the &quot;slim princess&quot; was sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1900. In the words of Ogden Mills, &quot;Either we built this line 300 miles too short or 300 years too early&quot;, reflecting V&amp;T&#x27;s attitude towards the railroad.

Shortly after the sale of the C&amp;C, silver was discovered at Tonopah, Nevada. The C&amp;C became prosperous for the Southern Pacific (as well as the V&amp;T, which had intermediate rail access), as wagon trains would run for miles through the desert to reach the narrow-gauge line, or later on the Tonopah and Goldfield Railroad which would then carry it back to the V&amp;T at the Mound House junction. Because of the break of gauge between the Carson &amp; Colorado and Virginia &amp; Truckee, the Tonopah ore had to be unloaded by hand from the narrow-gauge cars and into the standard gauge cars at the C&amp;C northern terminus, causing a backlog of traffic, as cars waited to be transferred. The problem caused by this was also apparent in delivering mining equipment and materials to the mines and the town of Tonopah which was in a building boom. Southern Pacific officials did not like this arrangement, so in 1904 they converted the narrow gauge C&amp;C to standard gauge from Mound House to Mina, renamed the Nevada &amp; California Railroad. This allowed Southern Pacific trains to run along the V&amp;T through to Mound House to the Nevada &amp; California, and on down to Tonopah. In addition, the Southern Pacific (controlled at the time by the Union Pacific Railroad) offered to buy the Virginia &amp; Truckee, but the V&amp;T officials set their price too high (according to Union Pacific president Harriman). Instead, the Southern Pacific built their own line from the closest available intersection with the former C&amp;C. The line ran 28 miles from Hazen to Fort Churchill and connected their own main lines, thus bypassing the V&amp;T entirely.

In 1904, the corporation changed its name to the Virginia and Truckee Rail&quot;way&quot;. In response to agricultural and cattle ranch concerns, the V&amp;T built a short branch line to Minden, about 26 miles south of Carson City, in 1906. This branch line brought in increased freight traffic. As a result, the V&amp;T purchased three new ten-wheelers from Baldwin: (the first) No. 25, 26, and 27, in 1905, 1907, and 1913, respectively.

===Decline of the railroad===
The Virginia and Truckee&#x27;s decline began as early as 1924, the first year in which the railroad failed to make a profit. Mining revenue had dropped off to very low levels, though revenue from the Minden line continued to flow. Passenger revenue was on a steady decline, due to the increased use of the automobile on the ever-expanding highway system in the US. US 395 ran alongside the V&amp;T from Minden all the way up to Reno, and US 50 ran from south of Carson City over to Mound House and the turnoff to Nevada State Route 17 (later NV 341), the route to Virginia City.

The sole owner of the railroad in 1933 was Ogden Livingston Mills, grandson of original co-founder Darius Ogden Mills. He personally paid the deficits in the railroad&#x27;s operating costs as a nod to the past and his family&#x27;s involvement in the early days of Virginia City. In 1938, a year after Mills&#x27; death, the railroad went into receivership, and its management began making plans to cease operations, with the Virginia City branch already having been dismantled during that year. At the time of the railroad&#x27;s closure, it had only three locomotives operating, the second no. 25 as well as numbers 26 and 27 (all 4-6-0&#x27;s built by Baldwin in 1905, 1907, and 1913, respectively). No. 26 was originally scheduled to haul the last train, but after making its run on May 1, 1950, the single-stall locomotive shed it was stored in on the banks of the Truckee River in Reno caught fire. No. 26, deemed a total loss, was scrapped, and the road instead restored no. 27 for the occasion. On May 31, 1950, no. 27 pulled the Virginia and Truckee&#x27;s final train.

Lucius Beebe, a noted railroad historian, settled in Virginia City with Charles Clegg, a photographer, and helped to revitalize the town and interest in the railroad by writing books about the Virginia &amp; Truckee as well as other narrow gauge railroads, such as the Carson and Colorado Railroad, Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, and Rio Grande Southern Railroad.

===Restoring the line===
In 1972, a Virginia City railroad enthusiast , Robert C. Gray, who as a young man was one of the passengers on the last train to Virginia City in 1938, sought to rebuild the V&amp;T as a tourist line. After gaining approval from Storey County, reconstruction of the line began from F Street to the Eastern portal of Tunnel #4. Work to re-open Tunnel #4 continued until it was finally reopened in the late 1980s. Work had started on Tunnel #3 (which had a history of instability to the point that regular passenger cars could no longer fit by the time the last trains ran in 1938), but a large boulder shifted and buried the tunnel. A shoofly was built around the tunnel, just enough as to not be too sharp for the locomotives, opening up a view of the valley. 

Officials with the public Nevada Commission for the Reconstruction of the V&amp;T Railway held a &quot;silver spike&quot; ceremony on January 3, 2006, in Carson City to commemorate the completion of two miles of track near Gold Hill. The construction, completed in September 2005, was part of an effort to restore the V&amp;T&#x27;s mainline from Virginia City to Carson City for operations. Then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev), who was instrumental in securing $10 million in federal funding for the project, and Nevada Lieutenant Governor Lorraine Hunt, who secured an additional $1 million in state funding for the project, both spoke at the ceremony. The completion of the first phase of the extension saw the last train of the day venturing beyond Gold Hill and to American Flats, over a massive fill of the Overman Pit, near the Crown Point Ravine. This practice has been abandoned in recent years, though.

In June 2008, #29 returned to operation after a significant overhaul.
The Commission subsequently rebuilt the line from Gold Hill (connection with the current V&amp;T Railroad) to Carson City, running the first train over the line in 68 years on August 14, 2009. The ceremonial first run from Virginia City to Mound House (referred to as &quot;Carson City Eastgate&quot; in official material) occurred for VIPs. On the 15th and 16th the line opened to the public.

It was estimated that completion of the line from Gold Hill to downtown Carson City would cost in excess of $55 million, and it was planned that the line, which was originally abandoned in 1938, would be completed and fully operational once again in 2012. However, as of 2024, trains only go as far as Eastgate Station, in eastern Carson City.

==Historic equipment==

The Virginia and Truckee&#x27;s locomotives and other equipment appeared in numerous Westerns over the years since the railroad operated otherwise obsolete equipment well into the &quot;cinema age&quot;. Many of these pieces have been restored and are on display at museums throughout the country. Cars and locomotives from the original railroad are on display at the Nevada State Railroad Museum in Carson City, at the Comstock History Center on C Street in Virginia City, at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento and at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg. In addition, an operating 5/8-scale replica of the V&amp;T locomotive, &quot;Reno&quot;, has been running on the Washington Park and Zoo Railway since 1959. On April 18, 2018, the Nevada State Railroad Museum swapped No. 18 &quot;Dayton&quot; for No. 27. The engine will now be in the Comstock Historic Center, and the Dayton will reside in Carson City. On March 2, 2020, the replica of V&amp;T No. 1 was shipped to Carson City, where it will reside at the Nevada State Railroad Museum and will be completed.

==Operations==
In May 2013, the railroad acquired a GE 44-ton switcher engine and three passenger cars from the defunct Yuma Valley Railway. The diesel has been given the number D-3.
In November 2016, the railroad acquired an EMD SW1200 from Evraz, numbered 3540.

2020 saw the acquisition of a second bay-window caboose, No. 52, from Jim Dobbas, Inc. in Antelope, California. The caboose, a former Union Pacific CA-11 steel caboose built in 1979 as No. 25852, began being used on daily trains to Gold Hill in August 2021, and is used to increase capacity on busy weekends.

In 2021, No. 29, along with cars 101103, were trucked out to Pawhuska, Oklahoma, to appear in the Martin Scorsese film, &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot;. For the film, the Pullmans were repainted in Pullman green, while No. 29 was repainted as Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway No. 729 (the real 729 was also a 2-8-0 Consolidation, and several of its classmates are preserved). No. 29 is the latest in a long line of V&amp;T locomotives to appear in films, as equipment from the original V&amp;T frequently appeared in westerns by Desilu Productions. As of October 2023, the Pullmans are still wearing their movie colors, while No. 29 was quickly given its old identity back upon its return.

In February 2022, the V&amp;T acquired three pieces of equipment from the Fillmore and Western Railway in Ventura County, California. These were an ex-CB&amp;Q Pullman numbered 2205 and named &quot;Rancho Camulos&quot;, an ex-SP ALCO S-6 numbered 1059, and the body of a Pacific Fruit Express reefer. 1059, which famously appeared in &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; as the lead locomotive of the train that destroys the DeLorean time machine, was acquired as a replacement for D-2.

In May 2022, the railroad acquired a Baldwin 2-8-2 from the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad. The locomotive, No. 100, was built for the Charles R. McCormick Lumber Company in 1926, and ran on the Heber Valley Railroad from 1976 to 1989. The locomotive is currently at the Virginia City shops undergoing restoration work. It has been reassigned the number 30 from SP 1251.

==Current equipment==
The following is a list of the locomotives currently owned by the reborn V&amp;T.

* The V&amp;T also owns several coaches that are currently stored in the Virginia City yard in a dilapidated state. One of the coaches was the private car of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, while another was a presidential car used by the Mexican Government. Another one was a former outfit dining car for the work crews of the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad, another famous Nevada shortline. The car was also used in several movies made by R-K-O Pictures with other famous pieces of V&amp;T rolling stock.

=== Former equipment ===

* No. 8: Ex-Feather River Short Line No.8, née Hobart Southern. Stored operable in Mound House, with no plans to return to service on the V&amp;T in the near future due to it being owned by the Gold Hill Historical Society and not the V&amp;T.

==In popular culture==
In order to ascend the mountain to Virginia City it was necessary to build an enormous trestle. Popular Nevada mythology says Crown Point Trestle was considered to be such a feat of engineering that it is featured on the Nevada State Seal. This myth is mentioned by Lucius Beebe. Former Nevada State Archivist Guy Rocha debunks this myth on the state&#x27;s Myth-a-Month page, pointing out that the state seal predates the trestle and shows a viaduct, not a trestle.

<text>Lethabo Power Station in the Free State, South Africa, is a large coal fired power station owned and operated by Eskom.

==Power generation==
The station is located between Vereeniging and Sasolburg in the Free State and consists of six 618MW units for a total installed capacity of 3,708MW. Total efficiency at Turbine Maximum Continuous Rating is 37.80%

Lethabo burns coal with a calorific value of 15 - 16 MJ/kg and an ash content of 42%. It is the only power station in the world running on such low grade coal.

The Lethabo power station has approximately 1100 employees.

=== Technical details ===
*Six 618MW units 
*Installed capacity: 3 708MW 
*2001 capacity: 3558MW 
*Design efficiency at rated turbine MCR (%): 37.80% 
*Ramp rate: 33.33% per hour 
*Average availability over last 3 years: 93.05% 
*Average production over last 3 years: 21 572GWh

=== History ===
Construction of Lethabo started in 1980 and by December 1990, the station was fully operational. The station has been built on 11 000 concrete piles which were sunk 25 metres deep. The reason being to alleviate the heaving clay problem after some 190 000 bluegum trees were removed during site clearing. At the time, it was the largest piling contract ever awarded to a South African contractor.

<doc id="1252455" wikidata="Q2636301" url="?curid=1252455" title="Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway">
<text>The Alabama &amp; Gulf Coast Railway is a Class II railroad owned by Genesee &amp; Wyoming. It operates of track from the Pensacola, Florida export terminals, west of downtown, north to Columbus, Mississippi, with trackage rights along BNSF Railway to Amory, Mississippi. A branch uses trackage rights along Norfolk Southern from Kimbrough, Alabama west and south to Mobile, Alabama, with separate trackage at the end of the line in Mobile.

== History ==
=== Predecessor lines ===
The current AGR is composed of numerous lines built during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which were gradually consolidated into a system that was purchased by the St. Louis – San Francisco Railway and remained under that railroad or its successor&#x27;s control until 1997, when it was spun off into an independent company.

==== Pre-1922 ====

The earliest ancestor of the AGR was the Pensacola and Mobile Railroad and Manufacturing Company, which in 1861 constructed of track between Muscogee, Florida and Cantonment, Florida. The railroad was not rebuilt until 1877. In 1874, the Pensacola, Mobile &amp; New Orleans Railroad company took control of the Pensacola and Perdido Railroad, which ran west from Pensacola about five miles to a lumber mill at Millview, Florida on Perdido Bay. In 1892, the system merged with the Pensacola, Alabama and Tennessee Railroad, which connected the Millview and Muscogee branches. Shortly thereafter, the railroad was renamed the Gulf Ports Terminal Railway.

In 1910, the Gulf Ports Terminal Railway was acquired by Southern States Lumber, which operated of track to move lumber from forests in Baldwin County, Alabama, to its large mill at Muscogee, and on to the port of Pensacola for export. The combined system had a total length of around .

In 1911, the railroad was acquired by the Gulf, Florida, and Alabama Railway. Soon after, construction of a line from Cantonment to Pensacola was begun, being completed in 1913. Almost immediately following the completion of this line, another, much longer line was begun, this one from Cantonment north via Atmore and Frisco City, Alabama to an interchange with the Southern Railway at Kimbrough, Alabama. The line, including a large bridge over the Alabama River, was completed in 1915.

==== 1922–1997 ====
In 1922, the Gulf, Florida, and Alabama Railway was acquired by the Muscle Shoals, Birmingham and Pensacola Railroad (MSB&amp;P), which only three years later was bought by the Frisco (St. Louis – San Francisco Railway). After the acquisition, the Frisco constructed a line from Aberdeen, Mississippi to Kimbrough, connecting the former MSB&amp;P with the rest of the Frisco&#x27;s system. This line was completed in 1928.

During the middle of the 20th century, the railroad operated as part of the Frisco, moving bulk products south to Pensacola for export and produce products north. Passenger service over the line continued until 1955, when the &quot;Sunnyland&quot;, operating between Pensacola and Kansas City, Missouri, via Amory, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, was discontinued.

In 1980, the Frisco was acquired by the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN), itself a product of a merger of several railroads in 1970. In 1995, the BN merged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to form the BNSF Railway.

=== Current railroad ===
In 1997, when BNSF spun off the route between Kimbrough and Pensacola, the Alabama &amp; Gulf Coast was formed to take over operations. In 2003, BNSF sold additional trackage to the AGR: a line between Kimbrough and Columbus, Mississippi, as well as isolated trackage near Mobile, Alabama formerly part of the Alabama, Tennessee and Northern Railroad. As part of this deal, the AGR gained trackage rights on BNSF between Columbus and Amory and on the Norfolk Southern Railway between Mobile and Kimbrough.

In 2002, the AGR, which had been formerly owned by States Rail, Inc., a short-line holding company, was acquired by RailAmerica. In late 2012, Genesee &amp; Wyoming acquired the railroad as part of its acquisition of RailAmerica.

== Fleet ==
As of December 2020, the AGR fleet consisted of the following:

== Route ==


The AGR operates on a total of 339 miles of owned and leased trackage in Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. Its also runs via trackage rights over BNSF Railway between Columbus and Amory, MS and Norfolk Southern Railway between Kimbrough and Mobile, AL. The AGR is separated into the following four subdivisions.

The following route maps at right were created using actual track charts, timetables and maps with satellite imagery.

AGR has many interchanges. Canadian National, CG Railway, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Terminal Railway all have interchanges at Mobile, Alabama. Columbus and Greenville Railway, Golden Triangle Railroad, CPKC, and Luxapalila Valley Railroad all have an interchange at Columbus, Mississippi. BNSF has one at Amory, Mississippi, Meridian &amp; Bigbee Railroad at Linden, Alabama, as well as CSX at Cantonment, Florida. Norfolk Southern also has more interchanges at Kimbrough, Alabama, Demopolis, Alabama, and Boligee, Alabama.

<doc id="1252461" wikidata="Q1490262" url="?curid=1252461" title="Whangaehu River">
<text>The Whangaehu River is a large river in central North Island of New Zealand. Its headwaters are the crater lake of Mount Ruapehu on the central plateau, and it flows into the Tasman Sea eight kilometres southeast of Whanganui. Due to the high acidity of the water coming from the crater lake, water is not diverted from the headwaters for the Tongariro Power Scheme. Instead, it bypasses the Waihianoa Aqueduct via a ford.

==Length==
The river flows for southward to the South Taranaki Bight near the settlement of Whangaehu.

==Notoriety==
The sudden collapse of part of the Ruapehu crater wall on 24 December 1953 led to New Zealand&#x27;s worst railway accident, the Tangiwai disaster. A lahar – a sudden surge of mud-laden water – swept down the river, significantly weakening the structure of a railway bridge at the small settlement of Tangiwai. The overnight express train between Wellington and Auckland passed over the bridge minutes later, causing it to collapse into the turbulent waters. Of the 285 people on the train, 151 were killed.

==Timeline==
* 13 December 1859: The bridge was washed away.
* In February 1862 James Coutts Crawford was given a number of old songs and &quot;various accounts of the taniwha, one of whom we were told overthrew the Wangaehu bridge.&quot;
* 1889: flood caused by the eruptions of Ruapehu.
* 1895: flood caused by the eruptions of Ruapehu.
* 24 December 1953: Tangiwai disaster
* 18 March 2007: Mt Ruapehu crater lake burst releasing an estimated 1.29 billion cubic metres of water, mud, and sludge; the Ruapehu ERLAWS alarm successfully activated preventing any accidents. This lahar was 50% bigger than the 1953 lahar that caused the Tangiwai disaster.

==Geology==
The river is often poisoned with toxic chemicals from the volcanic activity in and around Mount Ruapehu. The upper part of the river begins as the meltwater from a small glacier. When hot water from the lake spills, it quickly melts the ice and snow in the glacier forming a cave-like tunnel.

<text>Marmora is the largest community in the Municipality of Marmora and Lake in Hastings County, Ontario, Canada. It is located on the Crowe River and along Highway 7 between Havelock to the west and Madoc to the east, about the halfway point between Ottawa and Toronto.

==History==

The rich history of Marmora Township is the story of mining in Eastern Ontario. Since 1820 this Township has played a leading role in the development of iron mining. In addition, copper, lead, silver, gold and lithographic limestone have been extracted.

Iron mining was an important industry in the area during the 19th century. The village was originally named Marmora Iron Works. Gold and silver were also mined at nearby Cordova Mines. A nearby plant processes talc and dolomite.

In 1821, the newly surveyed townships of Elzevir, Madoc and Marmora were added to Hastings County, on the initiative of Charles Hayes, an Irish entrepreneur, in return for his setting up the Marmora Iron Works.

The new Township of Marmora took its name from the Latin word for marble because of an &quot;immense rock of most delicate white marble&quot;. This giant rock stood on the southeast corner of Crowe Lake, which took its name from the Crowe First Nations that lived along the shore.

Marmora Township was opened for sale in 1821, but there was little settlement outside of the newly created mining village.

The hamlet of Marmora was separated from the Township and incorporated as a village in 1901. It was re-amalgamated with the surrounding townships of Marmora and Lake in 2001 to form a newly expanded Municipality of Marmora and Lake.

<doc id="1252471" wikidata="Q1969246" url="?curid=1252471" title="Temporal database">
<text>A temporal database stores data relating to time instances. It offers temporal data types and stores information relating to past, present and future time.
Temporal databases can be uni-temporal, bi-temporal or tri-temporal.

More specifically the temporal aspects usually include valid time, transaction time and/or decision time.

* Valid time is the time period during or event time at which a fact is true in the real world.
* Transaction time is the time at which a fact was recorded in the database.
* Decision time is the time at which the decision was made about the fact. Used to keep a history of decisions about valid times.

==Types==
===Uni-temporal===
A uni-temporal database has one axis of time, either the validity range or the system time range.

===Bi-temporal===

A bi-temporal database has two axes of time:
* Valid time
* Transaction time or decision time

===Tri-temporal===
A tri-temporal database has three axes of time:
* Valid time
* Transaction time 
* Decision time

This approach introduces additional complexities.

Temporal databases are in contrast to current databases (not to be confused with currently available databases), which store only facts which are believed to be true at the current time.

==Features==
Temporal databases support managing and accessing temporal data by providing one or more of the following features:

* A time period datatype, including the ability to represent time periods with no end (infinity or forever)
* The ability to define valid and transaction time period attributes and bitemporal relations
* System-maintained transaction time
* Temporal primary keys, including non-overlapping period constraints
* Temporal constraints, including non-overlapping uniqueness and referential integrity
* Update and deletion of temporal records with automatic splitting and coalescing of time periods
* Temporal queries at current time, time points in the past or future, or over durations
* Predicates for querying time periods, often based on Allen&#x27;s interval relations

==History==
With the development of SQL and its attendant use in real-life applications, database users realized that when they added date columns to key fields, some issues arose. For example, if a table has a primary key and some attributes, adding a date to the primary key to track historical changes can lead to creation of more rows than intended. Deletes must also be handled differently when rows are tracked in this way. In 1992, this issue was recognized but standard database theory was not yet up to resolving this issue, and neither was the then-newly formalized SQL-92 standard.

Richard Snodgrass proposed in 1992 that temporal extensions to SQL be developed by the temporal database community. In response to this proposal, a committee was formed to design extensions to the 1992 edition of the SQL standard (ANSI X3.135.-1992 and ISO/IEC 9075:1992); those extensions, known as TSQL2, were developed during 1993 by this committee. In late 1993, Snodgrass presented this work to the group responsible for the American National Standard for Database Language SQL, ANSI Technical Committee X3H2 (now known as NCITS H2). The preliminary language specification appeared in the March 1994 ACM SIGMOD Record. Based on responses to that specification, changes were made to the language, and the definitive version of the TSQL2 Language Specification was published in September, 1994

An attempt was made to incorporate parts of TSQL2 into the new SQL standard , called SQL3. Parts of TSQL2 were included in a new substandard of SQL3, ISO/IEC 9075-7, called SQL/Temporal. The TSQL2 approach was heavily criticized by Chris Date and Hugh Darwen. The ISO project responsible for temporal support was canceled near the end of 2001.

As of December 2011, ISO/IEC 9075, Database Language Part 2: SQL/Foundation included clauses in table definitions to define &quot;application-time period tables&quot; (valid time tables), &quot;system-versioned tables&quot; (transaction time tables) and &quot;system-versioned application-time period tables&quot; (bitemporal tables). A substantive difference between the TSQL2 proposal and what was adopted in SQL:2011 is that there are no hidden columns in the SQL:2011 treatment, nor does it have a new data type for intervals; instead two columns with datestamps (DS) or date-timestamps (DTS) can be bound together using a codice_1 declaration. Another difference is replacement of the controversial (prefix) statement modifiers from TSQL2 with a set of temporal predicates.

Other features of standard related to temporal databases are automatic time period splitting, temporal primary keys, temporal referential integrity, temporal predicates with Allen&#x27;s interval algebra and time-sliced and sequenced queries.

==Example==
For illustration, consider the following short biography of a fictional man, John Doe:

:John Doe was born on 1975-04-03 in the Kids Hospital of Medicine County, as son of Jack Doe and Jane Doe who lived in Smallville. Jack Doe proudly registered the birth of his first-born on April 4, 1975 at the Smallville City Hall. John grew up as a joyful boy, turned out to be a brilliant student and graduated with honors in 1993. After graduation, he went to live on his own in Bigtown. Although he moved out on 1994-08-26, he forgot to register the change of address officially. It was only at the turn of the seasons that his mother reminded him that he had to register, which he did a few days later on 1994-12-27. Although John had a promising future, his story ends tragically. John Doe was accidentally hit by a truck on 2001-04-01. The coroner reported his date of death on the very same day.

===Using a non-temporal database===
To store the life of John Doe in a current (non-temporal) database we use a table . (In order to simplify, codice_2 is defined as the primary key of codice_3.)

John&#x27;s father officially reported his birth on 1975-04-04. On this date a Smallville official inserted the following entry in the database: codice_4.
Note that the date itself is not stored in the database.

After graduation, John moves out, but forgets to register his new address. John&#x27;s entry in the database is not changed until 1994-12-27, when he finally reports it. A Bigtown official updates his address in the database. The codice_3 table now contains codice_6. Note that the information of John living in Smallville has been overwritten, so it is no longer possible to retrieve that information from the database. An official accessing the database on 1994-12-28, would be told that John lives in Bigtown. More technically: if a database administrator ran the query on 1994-12-26, the result would be codice_7. Running the same query 2 days later would result in codice_8.

Until his death, the database would state that he lived in Bigtown. On 2001-04-01, the coroner deletes the John Doe entry from the database. After this, running the above query would return no result at all.

===Using a single axis: valid time or transaction time===
Valid time is the time for which a fact is true in the real world. A valid time period may be in the past, span the current time, or occur in the future.

For the example above, to record valid time, the codice_3 table has two fields added, codice_10 and codice_11. These specify the period when a person&#x27;s address is valid in the real world. On 1975-04-04, John&#x27;s father registered his son&#x27;s birth. An official then inserts a new entry into the database stating that John lives in Smallville from April 3. Note that although the data was inserted on the fourth, the database states that the information is valid since the third. The official does not yet know if or when John will move to another place, so the codice_11 field is set to infinity (∞). The entry in the database is:

On 1994-12-27, John reports his new address in Bigtown where he has been living since 1994-08-26. A new database entry is made to record this fact:

The original entry codice_13 is not deleted, but has the codice_11 attribute updated to reflect that it is now known that John stopped living in Smallville on 1994-08-26. The database now contains two entries for John Doe:

When John dies his current entry in the database is updated stating that John does not live in Bigtown any longer. The database now looks like this:
===Using two axes: valid time and transaction time===
Transaction time records the time period during which a database entry is accepted as correct. This enables queries that show the state of the database at a given time. Transaction time periods can only occur in the past or up to the current time. In a transaction time table, records are never deleted. Only new records can be inserted, and existing ones updated by setting their transaction end time to show that they are no longer current.

To enable transaction time in the example above, two more fields are added to the Person table: codice_15 and codice_16. Here, codice_15 is the time a transaction was made, and codice_16 is the time that the transaction was superseded (which may be infinity if it has not yet been superseded). This makes the table into a bitemporal table.

What happens if the person&#x27;s address as stored in the database is incorrect? Suppose an official accidentally entered the wrong address or date? Or, suppose the person lied about their address for some reason. Upon discovery of the error, the officials update the database to correct the information recorded.

For example, from 1995-06-01 to 2000-09-03, John Doe moved to Beachy. But to avoid paying Beachy&#x27;s exorbitant residence tax, he never reported it to the authorities. Later during a tax investigation, it is discovered on 2-Feb-2001 that he was in fact in Beachy during those dates. To record this fact, the existing entry about John living in Bigtown must be split into two separate records, and a new record inserted recording his residence in Beachy. The database would then appear as follows:

However, this leaves no record that the database ever claimed that he lived in Bigtown during 1995-06-01 to 2000-09-03.This might be important to know for auditing reasons, or to use as evidence in the official&#x27;s tax investigation. Transaction time allows capturing this changing knowledge in the database, since entries are never directly modified or deleted. Instead, each entry records when it was entered and when it was superseded (or logically deleted). The database contents then look like this:

The database records not only what happened in the real world, but also what was officially recorded at different times.

===Using three axes: valid time, decision time, and transaction time===
Decision time is an alternative to the transaction time period for recording the time at which a database entry may be accepted as correct. This enables queries that show the officially recognized facts at a given time, even if there was a delay in committing those facts to the database. Support for decision time preserves the entire history and prevents the loss of information during updates.

Decision time periods can only occur in the past or up to the transaction time. As in a transaction time table, records are never deleted. Only new records can be inserted, and existing ones updated by setting their decision end time to show that they are no longer current.

To enable decision time, two more fields are added to a database table: codice_19 and codice_20. Here, codice_19 is the time a decision was made, and codice_20 is the time that the decision was superseded (which may be infinity if it has not yet been superseded). When combined with transaction time, this makes the table into a tritemporal table.
The following is a list of real events that occurred between the 1964 and 1976 United States presidential elections:
In this example, a constant 7-day delay is assumed between the decision time and the transaction time when the data is committed to the database. Given those conditions, the database would have contained the following information after the election in 1976:

Given the 7-day delayed table above, the question &quot;who was president and vice president for the valid time of 1977-01-01&quot; (which given the 7-day delay could provide data for 1976-12-25) would be:

* Nixon/Agnew when using a decision time and transaction time of 1972-11-14
* Nixon/(Vacant) when using a decision time and transaction time of 1973-10-17
* Nixon/Ford when using a decision time and transaction time of 1974-08-08
* Ford/(Vacant) when using a decision time of 1974-08-08 and transaction time of current
* Ford/Rockefeller when using a decision time and transaction time of current

==Bitemporal modelling==

A bitemporal model contains both valid and transaction time. This provides both &quot;historical&quot; and &quot;rollback&quot; information. Historical information (e.g.: &quot;Where did John live in 1992?&quot;) is provided by the valid time. Rollback (e.g.: &quot;In 1992, where did the database believe John lived?&quot;) is provided by the transaction time. The answers to these example questions may not be the same the database may have been altered since 1992, causing the queries to produce different results.

The valid time and transaction time do not have to be the same for a single fact. For example, consider a temporal database storing data about the 18th century. The valid time of these facts is somewhere between 1701 and 1800. The transaction time would show when the facts were inserted into the database (for example 1998-01-21).

==Schema evolution==

A challenging issue is the support of temporal queries in a transaction time database under evolving schema. In order to achieve perfect archival quality it is of key importance to store the data under the schema version under which they first appeared. However, even the most simple temporal query rewriting the history of an attribute value would be required to be manually rewritten under each of the schema versions, potentially hundreds as in the case of MediaWiki. This process would be particularly taxing for users. A proposed solution is to provide automatic query rewriting, although this is not part of SQL or similar standards.

Approaches to minimize the complexities of schema evolution are to: 
* Use a semi-structured database/NoSQL database which reduces the complexities of modeling attribute data but provides no features for handling multiple time axes.
* Use a database capable of storing both semi-structured data for attributes and structured data for time axes (e.g., SnowflakeDB, PostgreSQL)

==Implementations in notable products==
The following implementations provide temporal features in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

* MariaDB version 10.3.4 added support for standard as &quot;System-Versioned Tables&quot;.
* Oracle Database Oracle Workspace Manager is a feature of Oracle Database which enables application developers and DBAs to manage current, proposed and historical versions of data in the same database.
* PostgreSQL version 9.2 added native ranged data types that are capable of implementing all of the features of the pgFoundry temporal contributed extension. The PostgreSQL range types are supported by numerous native operators and functions.
* Teradata provides two products. Teradata version 13.10 and Teradata version 14 have temporal features based on TSQL2 built into the database.
* IBM Db2 version 10 added a feature called &quot;time travel query&quot; which is based on the temporal capabilities of the standard.
* Microsoft SQL Server introduced Temporal Tables as a feature for SQL Server 2016. The feature is described in a video on Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Channel 9&quot; web site.

Non-relational, NoSQL database management systems that provide temporal features including the following:
* TerminusDB is a fully featured open source graph database that natively supports version control, time-travel queries and diffing functions. It has an immutable layer architecture based on delta encoding and succinct data structures. 
* MarkLogic introduced bitemporal data support in version 8.0. Time stamps for Valid and System time are stored in JSON or XML documents.
* SirixDB stores snapshots of (currently) XML- and JSON-documents very efficiently in a binary format due to a novel versioning algorithm called sliding snapshot, which balances read-/write-performance and never creates write peaks. Time-travel queries are supported natively as well as diffing functions.
* XTDB (formerly Crux) provides point-in-time bitemporal Datalog queries over transactions and documents ingested from semi-immutable Kafka logs. Documents are automatically indexed to create Entity–attribute–value model indexes without any requirement to define a schema. Transaction operations specify the effective Valid times. Transaction times are assigned by Kafka and enable horizontal scalability via consistent reads.
* RecallGraph is a point-in-time, unitemporal (transaction time) graph database, built on top of ArangoDB. It runs on ArangoDB&#x27;s Foxx Microservice sub-system. It features VCS-like semantics in many parts of its interface, and is backed by a transactional event tracker. Bitemporality is listed as one of the items in its development roadmap.
* Datomic &quot;is a distributed database that provides ACID transactions, flexible schema, [...] Datalog queries, complete data history, and SQL analytics support.&quot; For every change made to the data, it records the responsible transaction and the point in time when it happened.

Temporal databases were one of the earliest forms of data version control, and influenced the development of modern data versioning systems. 

===Alternatives===
Slowly changing dimensions can be used to model temporal relations.

<text>The Frederic Esser Nemmers Prize in Mathematics is awarded biennially from Northwestern University. It was initially endowed along with a companion prize, the Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics, as part of a $14 million donation from the Nemmers brothers. They envisioned creating an award that would be as prestigious as the Nobel Prize. To this end, the majority of the income earned from the endowment is returned to the principal to increase the size of the award.

As of 2023, the award carries a $300,000 stipend and the scholar spends several weeks in residence at Northwestern University.

<text>Per Joar Hansen (born 17 August 1965) is a Norwegian football coach. He grew up in the small community of Trofors in Nordland. He played for and managed Rosenborg BK, and he has managed GIF Sundsvall, Aalesunds FK, Ranheim and the Norwegian under-21 football team.

==Club career==
Known by the nickname &quot;Perry&quot;, he began his career in the lower flight clubs of Mosjøen IL and Steinkjer FK, before enjoying a brief spell at Rosenborg from 1987 to 1989. He contributed to Rosenborg winning The Double in 1988. He then went on to play in lower divisions for Umeå FC, Stjørdals-Blink, Strindheim IL (first tier in 1995), Byåsen IL, Fram Skatval, and actually serving as player-manager from 1995 in Strindheim, Byåsen and Varden.

==Managerial career==
From the late 1990s &quot;Perry&quot; first joined the coaching staff of Rosenborg, but went on to Swedish top flight club GIF Sundsvall in the autumn of 2001 where he enjoyed great success in his first season.

After just avoiding relegation in 2003, he resigned from the club and returned to Rosenborg, turning down the job as manager of Swedish champions Djurgården of Stockholm. He was assistant manager to Ola By Rise during the not too impressive 2004 season, and he was appointed manager going into the historic start of the Royal League, which was not a successful competition of Scandinavian football.

Considered by the press as only the third best man for the position, he led Rosenborg into a difficult reconstruction process, seeing the stem of the team closing in on retirement from professional football. Halfway into the 2005 season, he resigned after a string of bad results, and was immediately replaced by Per-Mathias Høgmo.

Hansen signed a two-year contract with the Adeccoligaen club Aalesunds FK on 6 December 2006. Aalesunds got promoted to Tippeligaen the following year. He left Aalesunds and returned to GIF Sundsvall in December 2007. He was the manager there until 2 October 2008, when he got fired. From the 2009 season, he coached Ranheim Fotball in the Adeccoligaen. During the 2010 season, he was head of a coaching team including Otto Ulseth and Christer Basma.

He began 2011 managing the Norway national under-21 football team. On 16 October 2012, the team qualified for the UEFA European Under-21 Championship with an astonishing 5–4 aggregate win over France. His assistant manager Tor Ole Skullerud led the team to the semi-finals, as he returned to Rosenborg for his second spell as manager of the club.

In September 2021, Hansen was hired by Swedish club Östersunds FK. He left it at the end of the year, as the club only gained 5 points in 13 games under his helm and was relegated from the top-tier Allsvenskan.

<text>The Clarkstown radio transmitter was a longwave radio transmitter in County Meath, Ireland. The mast was located approximately east of the village of Summerhill, in a field south of the R156 regional road at Clarkstown. At 248 metres high, it was more than double the height of the Spire in Dublin.

==History==
Constructed in 1988 for the transmission of Atlantic 252 on 252 kHz, it used one 248-metre (814&#x27;) high guyed steel framework mast with triangular cross section, insulated from ground. The original transmitters were two 300 kilowatt Continental transmitters built by Varian Associates of Dallas. These were replaced in 2007 by a single 300 kilowatt Transradio TRAM 300L transmitter. The ground around the mast and the entire transmission site bed are lined with copper for conductivity. The site has an ITU-cleared transmission power of 500 kW by day and 100 kW at night but was later only capable of operating at 300 kW by day and 100 kW at night.

Atlantic 252 ceased operations on 2 January 2002 and sports radio station TEAMtalk 252 briefly took over the frequency for a few months in 2002. The transmitter was later taken over by RTÉ Networks Limited (now 2RN). It was used for the AM version of RTÉ Radio 1 on 252 kHz from 2004 to 2023, and was the sole source of RTÉ Radio 1 on AM from 24 March 2008, when the medium wave Tullamore transmitter on 567 kHz was taken off air., to 2023.

In 2007, the transmitter was carrying a Digital Radio Mondiale multiplex overnight, featuring Radio 1, RTÉ Digital Radio Sport, RTÉ Digital Radio News and the World Radio Network, before reverting to AM transmission for the daytime. DRM tests since ceased, with AM transmissions operating full-time once again until closedown in 2023.

On 24 September 2014, RTÉ announced that broadcasting of RTÉ Radio 1 on 252 kHz would cease on 27 October 2014, however following representations from Irish listeners in the UK and others, that date was postponed. On 31 March 2023, RTÉ announced that the longwave service would be discontinued on 14 April of that year. As planned, this did happen.

The mast was felled on Thursday 27 July 2023.

<doc id="1252493" wikidata="Q3568782" url="?curid=1252493" title="William LeMessurier">
<text>William James LeMessurier, Jr. (; June 12, 1926 – June 14, 2007) was a prominent American structural engineer.

== Early life and education ==

Born in Pontiac, Michigan, Bill was the youngest of four children of Bertha (Sherman) and William James LeMessurier Sr., owners of a dry cleaning business. After finishing high school, he left Michigan to major in Mathematics at Harvard College. He graduated with an AB in Mathematics in 1947, then went to Harvard Graduate School of Design. He later transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he earned his Master&#x27;s Degree in building engineering and construction in 1953.

== Career ==

While at MIT, LeMessurier worked for Albert Goldberg, an established Boston structural engineer; eventually LeMessurier became a partner and the firm was renamed Goldberg-LeMessurier Associates. In April 1961, the two separated and Bill launched his firm LeMessurier Consultants. 

LeMessurier was responsible for the structural engineering on a large number of prominent buildings, including Boston City Hall, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Singapore Treasury Building, and the Dallas Main Center.

LeMessurier is perhaps best known for his role during the Citicorp Center engineering crisis, when he secretly reassessed his calculations on the Citicorp headquarters tower in New York City after the building had been finished in 1977. In June 1978, Princeton University engineering student Diane Hartley contacted LeMessurier&#x27;s office after she identified winds that could topple the building under certain circumstances. Later, another young student, Lee deCarolis, prompted LeMessurier to redo his analysis. He discovered that the contractor had replaced the required welded joints with lower-cost, and potentially weaker bolted joints. This weakness could contribute to the building collapsing in &quot;quartering&quot; winds. This realization triggered a hurried, clandestine retrofit which was described in a 1995 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; entitled &quot;The Fifty-Nine-Story Crisis&quot;. The case is now an ethical case-study in architectural degree programs.

== Awards == 
He was awarded the AIA Allied Professions Medal in 1968, elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1978, elected an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects in 1988, and elected an honorary member of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in 1989. In 1999, he received the American Institute of Steel Construction&#x27;s J. Lloyd Kimbrough Award, its highest honor. In 2004, he was elevated to National Honor Member of Chi Epsilon, the national civil engineering honor society.

== Death ==
LeMessurier died in Casco, Maine, on June 14, 2007, as a result of complications after surgery he underwent on June 1 after a fall the day before.

<text>Stackpole () is a village approximately south of Pembroke, Pembrokeshire, Wales, in the community of Stackpole and Castlemartin. It has a population of around 200. 

Prior to 2011 Stackpole was a local government community in its own right, with its own elected community council. It was merged with neighbouring Castlemartin (and the community council dissolved) to form the new Stackpole and Castlemartin community.

Stackpole village was moved from its original medieval site in 1735 to accommodate the growing Stackpole Estate. However, present day Stackpole is considerably larger than it was then. Stackpole has a public house, The Stackpole Inn, which occupies the former village Post Office, a building of sixteenth-century origin. The village is surrounded on all sides by woodland and arable farmland.

The village had its own voluntary controlled primary school for children aged 4 to 11. The school was constructed in the late nineteenth century. In January 2016 a decision was made to close the school, due to costs being between 24% and 65% greater than the average county school.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the village expanded with modern homes built at the edge of Deer Park and around the school.
The parish church is dedicated to St. James and St Elidyr, and dates back to the twelfth century. It is located in the small village of Cheriton (or Stackpole Elidor), to the north of Stackpole.

<text>Ngāi Tūhoe (), often known simply as Tūhoe, is a Māori iwi of New Zealand. It takes its name from an ancestral figure, Tūhoe-pōtiki. &quot;Tūhoe&quot; is a Māori-language word meaning &#x27;steep&#x27; or &#x27;high noon&#x27;. Tūhoe people also bear the sobriquet &quot;Nga Tamariki o te Kohu&quot; (&#x27;the children of the mist&#x27;). Tūhoe traditional land is at Te Urewera (the former Te Urewera National Park) in the eastern North Island, a steep, heavily forested area which includes Lake Waikaremoana. Tūhoe traditionally relied on the forest for their needs. The tribe had its main centres of population in the small mountain valleys of Ahikereru and Ruatāhuna, with Maungapohatu, the inner sanctum of the Urewera, as their sacred mountain. The Tūhoe country had a great reputation among the neighbouring tribes as a graveyard for invading forces.

Tūhoe people have a reputation for their continued strong adherence to Māori identity and for their unbroken use of the Māori language, which 62% of them still speak (2018 figure). Of the Tūhoe people, estimated to number between 33,000 and 46,000, about 30 per cent still live on their tribal lands; most of the rest live in towns on the fringes of Te Urewera and in the larger North Island cities. At least 5,000 live in Australia. Subtribes of Tūhoe include Ngāti Koura, Ngāti Rongo, Ngāti Tāwhaki, Tamakaimoana, Ngāti Whare, Te Whānau Pani, Ngāti Hinekura and Patuheuheu.

The Tūhoe continue to maintain camps in Te Urewera and help run conservation programmes for endangered birds, such as the North Island brown kiwi and the North Island kōkako. Many Tūhoe return to their homelands every two years for the &quot;Te Hui Ahurei ā Tūhoe&quot; (Tūhoe Festival), which features &quot;kapa haka&quot;, debates, sports competitions, and fashion shows. The event provides an important opportunity to maintain ties with friends and relatives.

==History==

===19th century===
Tūhoe had little direct contact with the early European settlers. The first major contact occurred when the &quot;iwi&quot; fought against the settler government in the battle of Ōrākau in 1864. Rewi Maniapoto, who had some tribal links to Tūhoe, visited the Urewera in 1862 and persuaded them to take part in the rebellion against the government; he went against the wishes of some of the elders. Initially reluctant, the Tūhoe gave Rewi ammunition to back the rebellion. During a cease-fire in the Battle of Orakau, under a flag of truce, Gilbert Mair, a translator, was shot in the shoulder by a Tūhoe warrior. Nearly all the Tūhoe at the battle were killed.

The following year authorities accused the Tūhoe of sheltering Kereopa Te Rau, a Hauhau wanted for killing and beheading Karl Volkner, a missionary of the Church Missionary Society, in what was called the Volkner Incident. Initially, the Tūhoe had cooperated in tracking down the Hauhau leader and had taken him prisoner. The Tūhoe tried to use him as a bargaining chip but the government demanded Te Rau be handed over for trial. After the Tūhoe released him, Te Rau hid in the Ureweras. As punishment, in 1866 the government confiscated 5700ha or about 7% of Tūhoe land on its northern coastal border. The confiscated Tūhoe land adjoined the land confiscated from Bay of Plenty rebels after the battle of Gate Pā. The Crown took the Tūhoe&#x27;s only substantial flat, fertile land, which also provided their only access to the coast for &quot;kai moana&quot; (sea food). The Tūhoe people retained only interior, more difficult land, setting the scene for later famines.

In 1868, Tūhoe sheltered the Māori leader Te Kooti, a fugitive who had escaped from imprisonment on the Chatham Islands. Te Kooti arrived in the area with a large group of escaped convicts, fully armed with modern weapons he had stolen from the ship he had hijacked. It is doubtful that the Tūhoe could have resisted his demands for sanctuary. Some Tūhoe joined his armed Ringatū band, but other Tūhoe told government forces of Te Kooti&#x27;s whereabouts. Some joined the armed forces to hunt him down. Government forces punished those Tūhoe who supported Te Kooti during the manhunt. &quot;Te Ara&quot;, the Online Encyclopedia of New Zealand, notes:

Old enemies of Tūhoe fought on the side of the government; they carried out most of the raids into Te Urewera during a prolonged and destructive search between 1869 and 1872. In a policy aimed at turning the tribe away from Te Kooti, a scorched earth campaign was unleashed against Tūhoe; people were imprisoned and killed, their cultivations and homes destroyed, and stock killed or runoff. Through starvation, deprivation and atrocities at the hands of the government’s Māori forces, Tūhoe submitted to the Crown.

Te Kooti himself escaped to the King Country, and after the events surrounding the hunt for him, Tūhoe isolated themselves, closing off access to their lands by refusing to sell, lease or survey them, and blocking the building of roads.

Twenty years later, Te Urewera leaders, Premier Seddon, and Native Affairs Minister Timi (James) Carroll negotiated the 1896 &quot;Urewera District Native Reserve Act&quot; (UDNR). It provided for Tūhoe self-government through a General Committee and local committees, with the Native Land Court excluded and titles determined instead by a commission comprising two Pākehā and five Tūhoe commissioners. In practice however, the Crown through a mixture of ineptitude and bad-faith &quot;...totally failed to give effect to its promises in the UDNR Act; failed to act fairly, reasonably, and honourably...and failed to protect the Treaty rights of all the peoples of Te Urewera...&quot;

===1916 police raid===
Historian James Belich describes the Urewera as one of the last zones of Māori autonomy, and the scene of the last case of armed Māori resistance: the 1916 New Zealand Police raid to arrest the Tūhoe prophet Rua Kenana.

On 2 April 1916 a 70-strong, and heavily armed, police party arrived at Maungapohatu to arrest him for sedition. Because Rua&#x27;s village was so remote, the police had to take a lot of equipment and camped on the way. They moved like a small army with wagons and pack-horses, and included New Zealand Herald photographer Arthur Breckon. So as not to alert the Maungapohatu village of their intention to spring an attack they did not wear their police uniforms till just before the raid. They were convinced that when they reached Maungapohatu there would be an ambush.

There was no violent resistance from Rua personally, but his supporters fought a brisk half-hour gun battle with the police in which two Māori, including Rua&#x27;s son Toko, were killed and two wounded. Four constables were also wounded. Rua was arrested and transported to Rotorua, his hair and beard removed. From Rotorua, with six other Māori prisoners including Whatu, Rua was transferred to Auckland and sent directly to Mount Eden prison. Rua was held, at first, on a nine months sentence imposed for the 1915 charges and now increased by his default of fines. After a trial on sedition which lasted 47 days, New Zealand&#x27;s longest until 1977, he was found not guilty; but sentenced to one year&#x27;s imprisonment for resisting the police.

===Twentieth century===
Significant European penetration did not occur in the Urewera district until the 20th century. A road was built by the government from Rotorua to Ruatāhuna in 1901 to end the isolation of Tūhoe by opening up the first motor road.

Tūhoe did eventually realise, especially in the Great Depression, that to develop their local economy they needed good roads to the outside world. They donated some land for road rights of way. As early as 1906, Tūhoe had given land for roads and offered free labour to assist in the construction, but building arterial roads in the Ureweras had a low government priority. In the early 1900s traces of gold were found in the Ureweras and Rua Te Kanana tried to sell illegal mining rights to raise money. At the same time Rua wished to sell very large areas of land to the government to raise funds for his new Jerusalem, but despite having a petition signed by every Tūhoe adult, the government insisted that he stick to the law.

In the 1920s Gordon Coates, Minister of Public Works, went to the area to check its suitability for a railway and to discuss roads. The land was very steep with the &quot;Poverty Bay Herald&quot; describing the gradient as &quot;one in nothing&quot;. Coates knew that by this time, Tūhoe refused to make any contribution to the road at all. The mountainous terrain was daunting for farming. Tūhoe could not accumulate any capital to develop land they had cleared from 1907. Instead they sold all their sheep and cattle to pay for legal costs. These debts were not paid until 1931.

In the early 1930s the government helped develop Tūhoe land at both Ruatoki and Ruatāhuna. It understood that, like many New Zealanders in the Great Depression, Tūhoe had hard times. In 1934 a teacher wrote that &quot;they have no money apart from what is given by government as Family Allowances and Old Age Pensions&quot;. A 1936 report noted that land development at Maungapohatu Mountain (a Ringatu stronghold) &quot;would be a social success if undertaken&quot;. The report pointed out that the venture would probably fail if Tūhoe were required to pay back both the interest and the capital. In 1937, after several other studies, the government decided that it was uneconomic to invest in roads or settlements. By this time, the isolated Maungapohatu settlement had collapsed anyway.

===Late 20th and early 21st century===

The Tūhoe population was always small and living conditions were poor. School records from the 1920s and 1930s show very high death rates, especially of children. 75% of those who died were people under 25. The main causes of death were infectious diseases, such as influenza, gastroenteritis, typhoid fever and whooping cough. Between 1924 and 1936, the Depression period, 57 people died in a community of 30 families.

From the late 1990s, some Tūhoe started identifying as the &quot;Tūhoe nation&quot;, and emphasising widespread Tūhoe rejection of what they call &quot;Pākehā&quot; rule. It has been argued that because no Tūhoe or Tūhoe representative ever signed the Treaty of Waitangi, they never gave up their sovereignty.

Tūhoe and other local iwi brought the Urewera claim to the Waitangi Tribunal in 2002, with submissions accepted up until 2005.

===2007 police raid===

There was a major armed-police raid in the Ureweras on 15 October 2007 amid claims that some Tūhoe had run terrorist training-camps there. Roadblocks were set up between Ruatoki and Taneatua by armed police, who searched and questioned everyone who passed through, including a school bus, and locals said they felt intimidated.

No terrorism charges were laid, and the Police Commissioner Howard Broad later publicly apologised for the actions of his officers during the raid, acknowledging they had set back relations between police and Tūhoe people: &quot;We regret the hurt and stress caused to the community of Ruatoki and we will seek an appropriate way to repair the damage done to police-Maori relations. History tells us that episodes such as this can and do take decades to heal.&quot; A 2013 IPCA review found &quot;...police searches, vehicle stops, roadblocks and photographs taken in Tuhoe country on October 15, 2007, unlawful, unjustified and unreasonable.&quot;

===Waitangi settlement===
A final settlement was signed in June 2013, after being ratified by all Tūhoe members. Under the deal, Tūhoe received financial, commercial and cultural redress valued at approximately $170 million; an historical account and Crown apology; and the co-governance of a new legal entity, Te Urewera. It was put into law by the passing of the &quot;Tūhoe Claims Settlement Act 2014&quot;.

==Hapū and marae==

===Ngāti Koura===

Ngāti Koura is a &quot;hapū&quot; (subtribe) in the eastern Bay of Plenty in the North Island of New Zealand. Two marae are traditionally associated with Ngāti Koura: Otenuku and Te Papakainga. Otenuku marae is the site of Te Tapuwae, a cemetery in which many tribal chiefs of Tūhoe are buried.

<text>Berrylands is a residential neighbourhood in Surbiton, London, originally forming part of the Municipal Borough of Surbiton, and since 1965 part of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames. It is a suburban development situated south west of Charing Cross. Nearby places include Surbiton, New Malden, Old Malden, Tolworth and Chessington. Berrylands railway station is 24 minutes from London Waterloo by train.

==History==
Berrylands is a settlement of Anglo-Saxon origin that is close to the Thames. Berrylands originally formed part of the Municipal Borough of Surbiton, however in 1965 it was incorporated as part of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames.
Most of the present housing development took place in the 1930s on the former Berrylands Farm.

Old Maps from the 1860s show the western banks of the Hogsmill River and everything around them to be mostly empty apart from a few small trails and farm buildings with no evidence of real human settlement. In addition the area had absolutely no annotations of the word Berrylands to mark the area. In the late 19th and early 20th century the only prominent structure was the Regent House. It was the main building of Berrylands Farm.

The land was developed around the early 1930s and was complemented in 1933 with the opening of Berrylands Station. The construction of all the homes in one go was the reason why they all look similar. The Regent House was demolished to make way for new housing, with the street where the building used to stand appropriately being named Regent Road and in some gardens, parts of the regent house&#x27;s foundation are still visible.

The Surbiton Lagoon lido opened in 1934, but later closed in 1980, and then demolished at the end of the decade.
This area was subsequently transformed into a park now owned and managed by Kingston Council, known as Berrylands Park, with a small area to the south developed into housing, creating Meldone Close. By Meldone Close a small car park was also constructed.

==Etymology==
Berrylands is a place-name that misleadingly suggests &quot;land where berries grow&quot;. It actually means &quot;land on a tumulus or hill&quot;, from Old English (modern dialectal &quot;barrow&quot; meaning &quot;hill&quot;), cognate with Old Norse , and which mean the same thing, and Old English &quot;land&quot; (&quot;land&quot;). The name was recorded as Berilendes in 1126, and as Berulind in 1148 (wrongly suggesting Old English &quot;lime-tree&quot; as the second element), and more recently as Barrilands in 1378, which shows the true origin as being from Old English . The name has occasionally been mistaken as meaning the bottom of the hill as opposed to the hill itself.

In a sense, the name corresponds to the modern English &quot;Hill Farm&quot;, a common name for farms (and some new residences) across the United Kingdom.

==Housing, shops and transport==
There are four separate parades of shops. These are Alexandra Drive, Berrylands Road, Chiltern Drive and a smaller parade along Surbiton Hill Park. Chiltern Drive is at the centre of Berrylands, and houses over 22 businesses as well as the Berrylands public house, ‘The Berrylands’, known locally as &#x27;The Berry&#x27;. The shops were built in the 1930s, and currently consist of a newsagents, doctors surgery, hairdressers, beauty salon, CCTV shop, barbers, coffee shop, printer and bookshop, as well as the Berrylands railway station.

The neighbourhood is primarily residential. It houses a large commuter population using Transport for London travel routes, including two bus routes, the K2 and 665, and the Berrylands, Surbiton or Tolworth links to London Waterloo.

The majority of houses in the neighbourhood were built in the 1930s and have features typically found in housing stock of the inter-war period. Although most houses are semi-detached there are also many detached properties and a small number of flats. On the fork of Grand Avenue and Elmbridge Avenue, there is a cluster of Modernist Art Deco houses, built as part of the Parkside estate in 1934 (developer Bell). There&#x27;s also a little variety in architecture with small flat blocks on Surbiton Hill Park just north of the railway station.

==Geography==
Berrylands Station is the closest station to the sports ground of the London School of Economics and Political Science, which is in New Malden. There is a large water treatment plant on the opposite side of the railway. There are two large parks in Berrylands - Fishponds and Alexandra Park. Additionally nearby there is Green Lane park which is officially located within New Malden, however most locals consider it to be within Berrylands.

=== Rivers ===
The Hogsmill River marks much of the border between Berrylands and New Malden. There is also its small tributary, a man-made brook which runs through the nature reserve on the site of the former Surbiton Lagoon and through Alexandra Park before leaving the neighbourhood.

===Nearby Places===
==Nature reserves==

=== Raeburn open Space ===

In 2017 The Environment Trust acquired a grant for £168,000 from Thames Water, to support a three-year community project enhancing the river habitat, creating wetland habitat, and improving the undermanaged woodland. In July 2018 a footbridge was opened to create a nature trail into previously inaccessible corners of the nature reserve. The Small River running through the nature reserves had some changes done to it, there were blocks of dirt placed in corners of the river to make it meander more and the weirs were removed. This was done to allow the fish within the river further down stream to be able to freely swim across the whole river.

The nature reserve had existed prior to 2017 but it was just a small park, with the river and some trees. Additionally there were some pathways on either side of the river bank but the only bridge was at the edge of the nature reserve at Stirling Walk. Also the Berrylands Scout Camp was situated at the edge of the nature reserve by the bridge and the scouts often used the field in that nature reserve for games. Adjacent to Raeburn open space was Berrylands Park, the former site of the Surbiton Lagoon.

=== Rose Walk Nature Reserve ===
There is another small nature reserve just south of the railway line at the corner of Raeburn Avenue and Surbiton Hill Park called Rose Walk Nature Reserve. It has had no large investment and is more of just a small green area where people can walk their dogs and be around nature. Its only fault being it is directly south of the South Western Main line which generates a lot of noise.

==Education==

There are a two main schools in Berrylands, these being Christ Church Primary School and Grand Avenue Primary School. Grand Avenue according to official boundaries is within Tolworth however is widely recognised alongside all the housing around it to be a part of Berrylands and most students of the school reside there.

== Sport ==
The Surbiton Racket and Fitness club on Berrylands was established in 1881 - the club was founded and was known as the Berrylands Lawn Tennis Club. There were 200 members and 11 grass courts. Directly Adjacent to the Grass courts are a variety of clay courts often used by Christ Church Primary School directly south of it. Also on the other side of the grass courts there&#x27;s a building which contains various squash courts which are also used occasionally by the nearby school. In Grand Avenue Primary school there&#x27;s a swimming pool which on top of serving both schools in Berrylands, also does private lessons.

==Berrylands Festival==
Each year the local scout group organises a summer festival opposite their scout hut on the site of the old Surbiton Lagoon, now known by Kingston Council as Berrylands Park.

<doc id="1252502" wikidata="Q7808054" url="?curid=1252502" title="Tindersticks (1995 album)">
<text>Tindersticks is the second album by the British alternative band Tindersticks, released in 1995. It is often referred to as The Second Tindersticks Album to distinguish it from the band&#x27;s first album, which was also called &quot;Tindersticks&quot;. It reached no. 13 in the UK Albums Chart.

On 17 September 2006, the album was performed live in its entirety at the Barbican Centre in London, as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series. The concert was the last time the original six members of Tindersticks played together.

==Recording==
The band chose Conny&#x27;s Studios in Cologne after a recommendation from Blixa Bargeld when Tindersticks were supporting Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds on their tour of the UK in 1993. The group spent a week at Conny&#x27;s Studios in May 1994 where most of the backing tracks for the album were recorded. On their return to London they enlisted the help of Terry Edwards for the string arrangements: &quot;Sleepy Song&quot; was recorded on a single microphone in one night at Abbey Road Studios on 30 June 1994, and the string sections were recorded a few days later at the same studio. The remaining recording sessions for vocals and additional instruments were done at Orinoco Studios in early July, and the album was mixed during July and August 1994 by the band and their engineer Ian Caple at the house the band shared, and at Studio 3 of Townhouse Studios.

==Release==
The album was released in April 1995 on This Way Up in the UK and in August 1995 on London Records in the US As with their first and third albums, a remastered edition was released on Island Records in 2004 as a two-CD version, featuring the original album on the first disc and the live album &quot;The Bloomsbury Theatre 12.3.95&quot; on the second disc.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;No More Affairs&quot;, was accompanied by a video filmed at the Rivoli Ballroom in south-east London, and second single &quot;Travelling Light&quot; is a duet between Tindersticks&#x27; singer Stuart Staples and Carla Torgerson of The Walkabouts. The track &quot;My Sister&quot; features a spoken monologue from Isabel Monteiro, singer of the band Drugstore.

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s artwork features black and white photographs of the band being fitted for suits at Timothy Everest&#x27;s &quot;atelier&quot; in London; the front cover shows guitarist Neil Fraser. The band&#x27;s keyboard and accordion player David Boulter recalled in 2003 that &quot;we&#x27;d always worn very ill-fitting second-hand suits, shirts, whatever, and, as a treat for our hard work, we arranged to have a tailor-made suit each. I could never be seen without my Timothy Everest suit for a long time after. Phil Nicholls took photos of the fitting, which became the sleeve.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Like its predecessor, the album was well received by the critics. AllMusic said &quot;Tindersticks&#x27; second consecutive, eponymously titled double-LP set refines the approach of their debut; while every bit as ambitious and adventuresome, it achieves an even greater musical balance, stretching into luxuriously long compositional structures and more intricate arrangements ... Another awesome triumph of mood and atmosphere.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; proclaimed that &quot;their music is frequently as beautiful as it is brooding, and in the space between lies its enigmatic, enduring appeal&quot;.

&quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;time and again the &#x27;Sticks weld crashing orchestral drapes onto the sparsest acoustic frames. What with Stuart Staples&#x27; inchoate mumbles veering towards the realms of self-parody, the initial impact is so understated as to be infuriating. Before long, however, the music&#x27;s sheer otherworldly beauty acts like a virus and we&#x27;re locked in, transfixed by the dreadful acts being perpetrated to and by these songs&#x27; characters ... the key to this immense, beguiling record: you can&#x27;t aspire to Heaven unless you&#x27;re well aware of Hell.&quot;

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; stated, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to explain just what a marvellous piece of work this record is ...&quot;The Tindersticks&#x27; Second Album&quot; contains gentle, tender crucifixions, nails through your heart, administered by a loving hand. Also the record is uncommonly beautiful. It has the unexpected contours and sudden perception-changing angles of the most dangerous and heart-stopping faces ... Tindersticks create cameos of such detail, such fidelity, that at moments you wonder if they have spies in every bedroom in the land. Like the lover it documents, &quot;The Tindersticks&#x27; Second Album&quot; is ravishing and complex, inexplicable and contradictory. It is compassionate and merciless. Gorgeous as sin. Buy it because you&#x27;ll love it. Keep it because one day you&#x27;ll need it.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Melody Maker&quot; ranked the album at no. 5 in their critics&#x27; list of the best albums of 1995. &quot;NME&quot; placed the album at no. 13 in their equivalent list.

<doc id="1252509" wikidata="Q364650" url="?curid=1252509" title="John Lighton Synge">
<text>John Lighton Synge (; 23 March 1897 – 30 March 1995) was an Irish mathematician and physicist, whose seven-decade career included significant periods in Ireland, Canada, and the USA. He was a prolific author and influential mentor, and is credited with the introduction of a new geometrical approach to the theory of relativity.

==Background==
Synge was born 1897 in Dublin, Ireland, into a prominent Church of Ireland family. He attended St. Andrew&#x27;s College, Dublin and in 1915 entered Trinity College Dublin (TCD). He was elected a Foundation Scholar his first year, which was unusual as it was normally won by more advanced students. While an undergraduate at TCD, he spotted a non-trivial error in &quot;Analytical Dynamics&quot;, a textbook by E. T. Whittaker, who had recently taught there, and notified Whittaker of the error. In 1919 he was awarded a B.A. in Mathematics and Experimental Physics, and also a gold medal for outstanding merit. In 1922 he was awarded an M.A., and in 1926 a Sc.D., the latter upon submission of his published papers up to then.

In 1918, Synge had married Elizabeth Eleanor Mabel Allen (1896–1985). She was another student at TCD, first of mathematics, then of history, but family finances forced her to leave without graduating. Their daughters Margaret (Pegeen), Cathleen and Isabel were born in 1921, 1923 and 1930 respectively. The middle girl grew up to become the distinguished Canadian mathematician Cathleen Synge Morawetz.

Synge&#x27;s uncle John Millington Synge was a famous playwright. He is more distantly related to the 1952 Nobel prizewinner in chemistry Richard Laurence Millington Synge. He was a great-great-great-grandson of the mathematician and bishop Hugh Hamilton.

His older brother, Edward Hutchinson Synge (1890-1957), who was known as Hutchie, also won a Foundation Scholarship in Trinity for Mathematics, though he never graduated. While Hutchie&#x27;s later independent research was long overlooked, he is now recognised for his pioneering work in optics, particularly in near field optical imaging.

He died on 30 March 1995 in Dublin.

==Career in mathematics and physics==
Synge was appointed to the position of lecturer at Trinity College, and then accepted a position at the University of Toronto in 1920. From 1920 until 1925, Synge was an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto. There he attended lectures by Ludwik Silberstein on the theory of relativity, stimulating him to contribute &quot;A system of space-time co-ordinates&quot;, a letter in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1921.

Synge returned to Trinity College Dublin, in 1925, where he was elected to a fellowship and was appointed the University Professor of Natural Philosophy (the old name for physics). He was a member of the American Mathematical Society and the London Mathematical Society. He was treasurer of the Royal Irish Academy in 1929. He went back to Toronto in 1930, where he was appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics and became Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics. In 1940, he supervised three Chinese students, Guo Yonghuai, Chien Wei-zang and Chia-Chiao Lin, who later became leading applied mathematicians in China and the United States.

He spent some of 1939 at Princeton University, and in 1941, he was a visiting professor at Brown University. In 1943 he was appointed as Chairman of the Mathematics Department of Ohio State University. Three years later he became Head of the Mathematics Department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, where John Nash was one of his students. He spent a short time as a ballistic mathematician in the US Air Force between 1944 and 1945.

He returned to Ireland in 1948, accepting the position of Senior Professor in the School of Theoretical Physics at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. This school had been set up in 1940, and had several outstanding members, including Erwin Schrödinger (who contributed to quantum mechanics), who was also a Senior Professor.

==His contributions==
Synge made outstanding contributions to different fields of work including classical mechanics, general mechanics and geometrical optics, gas dynamics, hydrodynamics, elasticity, electrical networks, mathematical methods, differential geometry, and Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity. He studied an extensive range of mathematical physics problems, but his best known work revolved around using geometrical methods in general relativity.

He was one of the first physicists to seriously study the interior of a black hole, and his early work was cited by both Kruskal and Szekeres in their independent discoveries of the true (so-called maximal) structure of the Schwarzschild black hole. Synge&#x27;s later derivation of the Szekeres-Kruskal metric solution, which was motivated by a desire to avoid &quot;using &#x27;bad&#x27; [Schwarzschild] coordinates to obtain &#x27;good&#x27; [Szekeres-Kruskal] coordinates,&quot; has been generally under-appreciated in the literature, but was adopted by Chandrasekhar in his black hole monograph.

In pure mathematics, he is perhaps best known for Synge&#x27;s theorem, which concerns the topology of closed orientable Riemannian manifold of positive sectional curvature. When such a space is even-dimensional and orientable, the theorem says it must be simply connected. In odd dimensions, it instead says that such a space is necessarily orientable.

He also created the game of Vish in which players compete to find circularity (vicious circles) in dictionary definitions.

===Fields Medal===

While at Toronto, he was a colleague of John Charles Fields and acted as secretary to the 1924 International Mathematical Congress, which was hosted by Fields. Fields had been planning the creation of an award for mathematicians, however, when he became ill in 1932, Synge represented Fields at the 1932 International Mathematical Congress, where the medal was approved. After Fields death, Synge completed arrangements with the sculptor of the medal, R. Tait McKenzie and oversaw the disbursement of Fields&#x27; estate. The award is now known as the Fields Medal.

==Honours==
Synge received many honours for his works. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1943. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, and in 1943 was the first recipient of the society&#x27;s Henry Marshall Tory Medal, as one of the first mathematicians working in Canada to be internationally recognised for his research in mathematics. In 1954 he was elected an honorary fellow of Trinity College Dublin. He was president of the Royal Irish Academy from 1961 until 1964. The Royal Society of Canada established the John L. Synge Award in his honour in 1986.

John Lighton Synge retired in 1972. During his time at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, about 12% of all workers in the relativity theory studied there. Professor Hermann Bondi, who gave the first J. L. Synge Public Lecture in 1992, had this to say: &quot;Every one of the other 88% has been deeply influenced by his geometric vision and the clarity of his expression&quot;. He was awarded the Boyle Medal by the Royal Dublin Society in 1972.

During his long scientific career, Synge published over 200 papers and 11 books. He proved the result now known as Synge&#x27;s theorem.

<text>File deletion is the removal of a file from a computer&#x27;s file system.

All operating systems include commands for deleting files ([[rm (Unix)|rm]] on Unix and Linux, [[del (command)|era]] in CP/M and DR-DOS, [[del (command)|del]]/erase in MS-DOS/PC DOS, DR-DOS, Microsoft Windows etc.). File managers also provide a convenient way of deleting files. Files may be deleted one-by-one, or a whole blacklist directory tree may be deleted.

==Purpose==
Examples of reasons for deleting files are:
* Freeing the disk space
* Removing duplicate or unnecessary data to avoid confusion
* Making sensitive information unavailable to others
* Removing an operating system or blanking a hard drive

==Accidental removal==
A common problem with deleting files is the accidental removal of information that later proves to be important. A common method to prevent this is to back up files regularly. Erroneously deleted files may then be found in archives. 

Another technique often used is not to delete files instantly, but to move them to a temporary directory whose contents can then be deleted at will. This is how the &quot;recycle bin&quot; or &quot;trash can&quot; works. Microsoft Windows and Apple&#x27;s macOS, as well as some Linux distributions, all employ this strategy.

In MS-DOS, one can use the undelete command. In MS-DOS the &quot;deleted&quot; files are not really deleted, but only marked as deleted—so they could be undeleted during some time, until the disk blocks they used are eventually taken up by other files. This is how data recovery programs work, by scanning for files that have been marked as deleted. As the space is freed up per byte, rather than per file, this can sometimes cause data to be recovered incompletely. Defragging a drive may prevent undeletion, as the blocks used by deleted file might be overwritten since they are marked as &quot;empty&quot;.

Another precautionary measure is to mark important files as read-only. Many operating systems will warn the user trying to delete such files. Where file-system permissions exist, users who lack the necessary permissions are only able to delete their own files, preventing the erasure of other people&#x27;s work or critical system files.

==Sensitive data==
The common problem with sensitive data is that deleted files are not really erased and so may be recovered by interested parties. Most file systems only remove the link to data. But even overwriting parts of the disk with something else or formatting it may not guarantee that the sensitive data is completely unrecoverable. Special software is available that overwrites data, and modern (post-2001) ATA drives include a secure erase command in firmware. However, high-security applications and high-security enterprises can sometimes require that a disk drive be physically destroyed to ensure data is not recoverable, as microscopic changes in head alignment and other effects can mean even such measures are not guaranteed. When the data is encrypted only the encryption key has to be unavailable. Crypto-shredding is the practice of &#x27;deleting&#x27; data by (only) deleting or overwriting the encryption keys.

<doc id="1252525" wikidata="Q3615687" url="?curid=1252525" title="Andreas Divus">
<text>Andreas Divus was a Renaissance scholar, about whose life little is known; in Italian he is called Andrea Divo giustinopolitano or di Capodistria, i.e. surnamed Justinopolitanus in Latin and implying an origin at Koper, now in Slovenia, which was named at different times Aegida, Justinopolis and Capodistria. He is remembered for his Latin translations of Homer; but this &quot;versio Latina&quot;, in the view of modern scholarship, may have been his editorial version of a product of a tradition going back over a century of Latin translations for &quot;crib&quot; (reading aid) purposes.

==Translations==

His Latin translations of Homer published in 1537 (Venice) were extremely literal and &quot;ad verbum&quot; (i.e. word for word). While this was the first published version of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; in Latin, the originality of the translation of Divus has been questioned: there are very close parallels with a much earlier translation by Leontius Pilatus. They were designed to be read with the Greek originals. There were two Venice editions of 1537, by Jacob a Burgofrancho and by Melchior Sessa; they share an introduction by Pier Paolo Vergerio, born at Capodistria.

They were later republished by the jurist Obertus Giphanius (Hubrecht van Giffen, 1534–1604) and then used by Jean de Sponde (Spondanus) in his 1583 Homer commentary on Greek and Latin versions. The Greek was the 1572 (Strassburg) edition of Giphanius. What Spondanus included for Latin was not in fact the original translation of Divus, but a 1570 Geneva revision of it, with substantial changes.

They were used by George Chapman in his translations of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In fact Chapman is considered to have used the Homer edition by de Sponde, which had parallel Greek and Latin text (the Latin derived from Divus), together with a Greek lexicon attributed to Johannes Scapula, a collaborator of the printer Henri Estienne. It has been said that Chapman&#x27;s knowledge of Greek was not strong enough to resist entirely the Latin of Divus, with infelicitous results.

Divus was also used more directly by Ezra Pound in his long poem &quot;The Cantos&quot;, in particular for the opening Canto I (&quot;Lie quiet Divus. I mean, that is Andreas Divus, In officina Wecheli, 1538, out of Homer&quot;). The end of Canto I also references Latin translations of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; published with the original translations of Divus, these being by Georgius Dartona known as Cretensis (the Cretan).

<doc id="1252527" wikidata="Q2916481" url="?curid=1252527" title="Horndean">
<text>Horndean is a village and civil parish in the East Hampshire district, in Hampshire, England, north of Portsmouth.

The nearest railway station is southeast of the village at Rowlands Castle.

The village had a population of 12,942 at the 2011 Census, and shares the semi-rural character of others in the district.

The village was the home of Gales Brewery from 1850. In 2005, it was bought by Fuller, Smith and Turner, who closed it in 2006, when it was converted to shops and flats.

==History==
Horndean expanded in the early Middle Ages due to its convenient position as a staging post on the road from Portsmouth to London (now the A3). In 1836 it became home to the Hon. Sir Charles Napier Senior, father to the more famous Sir Charles Napier, who purchased a property in the village called The Grove but subsequently changed its name to Merchistoun Hall (named after his former home in Falkirk, Scotland). Merchistoun Hall is now a Grade II listed building and serves as the village&#x27;s major community centre. Horndean was bypassed by main line railways but was served by trams of the Portsdown and Horndean Light Railway until 1935 and thereafter by buses.

A three-storey workhouse was built during Victorian times to home the local poor. This stood on a site currently developed into a large retirement complex in 2017/18. This building had served a number of purposes including a local swimming pool. This was its primary function during the 1970s, provided by the use of a large polythene lined &#x27;tank&#x27; on its ground floor.

Using the pool was a fairly unpleasant experience by today&#x27;s standards due to its small size, lack of poolside space and most of all - daylight. The first and second floors were used in latter years as a small lampshade factory. Defunct and dangerous, the entire building was demolished in spring 1982, leaving a small building that was closed and eventually demolished with the construction of the new retirement development in 2017.

The village experienced significant expansion in the 20th century, particularly with the building of the Hazleton estate on the former grounds of Merchistoun Hall in the early 1960s, and the building of the A3(M) motorway in the 1970s, which passes under a bridge adjacent to the village centre. The easy access to the motorway has encouraged an influx of light industry to the village, most of it concentrated in three major estates, the most recent of which is Hazelton Interchange, built in the early 1990s. The centre of the village has a 1960s built small shopping precinct which is home to specialist businesses, as well as a cafe, fast food and newsagent.

In 1992, Horndean was the site of the high-profile child murder of Helen Gorrie, who was found strangled to death after going out one night to meet local man John Corcoran. He was convicted of the murder in 1999 but was released on a technicality in 2003 and moved back to Warren Park in Havant. Her murder remains officially unsolved.

==Toponymy==
Dean refers to the old English word &quot;denu&quot; meaning valley, and the name &quot;Horndean&quot; most likely means &quot;valley by a horn-shaped hill&quot; (the horn-shaped hill probably being Horndean Down). Alternatively &quot;Harne&quot; is the old English word for Dormouse making it &quot;valley of the Dormouse&quot;. The second part of the name, &quot;Dean&quot;, can also mean forest, giving rise to further connotations.

==Community==
Horndean&#x27;s major community centres are Horndean Community Association at Merchistoun Hall and Barton Hall, Horndean Technology College. There is also a youth centre, RKdia. Other venues include Napier Hall, which was partially rebuilt in 2004, and the Jubilee Hall, opened in 2002. The two C of E churches in the area are Holy Trinity at Blendworth and All Saints in neighbouring Catherington. In 2020, Hampshire County Council announced plans to close Horndean library. 

The surrounding villages are Catherington, Cowplain, Blendworth, Rowlands Castle and Clanfield.

==Sport and leisure==
Horndean has a Non-League football club Horndean F.C., which plays at Five Heads Park.

==Twinning==
The village of Horndean has been &#x27;twinned&#x27; with the town of Aubergenville in France since 1998. Various activities and exchange visits are organised by the Horndean Parish Twinning Association.
* Aubergenville, France

==Politics==
Horndean is in the Meon Valley constituency for elections to the House of Commons. Prior to Brexit in 2020, it was in the South East England constituency for elections to the European Parliament.

==Media==
ITV Meridian and BBC South are the local ITV and BBC television franchises. ITV Meridian and BBC South is received from the Rowridge transmitting station, on the Isle of Wight (though some parts towards Clanfield use the Horndean relay transmitter, which uses Rowridge as the signal feed for the relay station).

Radio services are received from Chillerton Down, on the Isle of Wight.

The local newspapers and publications are &quot;The Village News&quot; (free) and &quot; The News&quot;.

<text>Hand Held Products (previously HHP) was a US electronics manufacturer, established in 1981 in North Carolina. The company was a manufacturer of linear and 2D handheld barcode scanners based on imaging technology. Its product range included rugged mobile computers, image kiosks, and barcode verification devices. Its range of data collection and communication products were designed for mobile, on-site, and transaction processing applications. In 2007, the company was subsumed into the Honeywell Group.

==History==
The Hand Held Products company, established in 1981 in Charlotte, North Carolina, began as a manufacturer of memory modules for Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments programmable calculators, and grew rapidly from 1983 thanks to an RFP hand-off by Hewett-Packard, as the package delivery company Federal Express selected their Micro-Wand portable data collection device to begin a proof of delivery system for package tracking.

In 1996, Hand Held Products launched a mobile computer with 2D imaging technology, the Dolphin 7200. In 1997, the Hand Held Product&#x27;s Dolphin portable computer was selected by the United States Postal Service to be part of their proof of delivery system, although a third party provided the manufacturing. The deal was the industry&#x27;s largest ever single order, at 300,000 units. In 2006–2007 United States Postal Service started replacing these portable computers with Motorola portable computers (370,000 units), which had bar code reading hardware (2D imager) and decoding and image processing software designed and supplied by Hand Held Products.

The company became HHP in late 1999, following a merger with Welch Allyn Data Collection, a subsidiary of Welch Allyn formed in 1972, which by the 1990s was manufacturing a complete line of handheld bar code readers. From then, the company had its company headquarters in New York.

Hand Held Products had a significant presence in Europe, with its EMEA headquarters and European repair center in Eindhoven, Netherlands. It also has offices in the UK, Germany and France and sales representation and resellers in most countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Hand Held Products also has offices in Latin America and Asia.

On January 1, 2005, the company dropped HHP as its brand name and returned to its original name Hand Held Products.

On October 15, 2007, Hand Held Products announced they had agreed with Honeywell to be purchased for $390 million. On December 20, 2007 Honeywell’s acquisition of Hand Held was approved, and Hand Held became a new line of business within the Honeywell Security Group, initially called Honeywell Imaging and mobility. With Honeywell&#x27;s acquisition of Metrologic in 2008 they renamed the business unit Honeywell Scanning and Mobility.

<text>The Leroy P. Steele Prizes are awarded every year by the American Mathematical Society, for distinguished research work and writing in the field of mathematics. Since 1993, there has been a formal division into three categories.

The prizes have been given since 1970, from a bequest of Leroy P. Steele, and were set up in honor of George David Birkhoff, William Fogg Osgood and William Caspar Graustein. The way the prizes are awarded was changed in 1976 and 1993, but the initial aim of honoring expository writing as well as research has been retained. The prizes of $5,000 are not given on a strict national basis, but relate to mathematical activity in the USA, and writing in English (originally, or in translation).

<doc id="1252555" wikidata="Q376674" url="?curid=1252555" title="Aspmyra Stadion">
<text>Aspmyra Stadion is a football stadium in the town of Bodø in Bodø Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. Home of Bodø/Glimt and Grand Bodø, it holds a seated capacity for 8,270 spectators. The venue has four stands: a modern all-seater with roof, 100 club seats and 15 luxury boxes to the south, unroofed all-seater stands to the east and west and two stands to the north. An older raised grandstand with roofing at the back and a new (built 2022) all-seater unroofed stand in front. Before this new stand was built the area in front of the old stand was a standing area that could hold approximately 2000 people, but did not fulfill UEFA safety regulations for international matches. The venue has floodlights and artificial turf with under-soil heating. Immediately south of the venue lies Aspmyra kunstgressbane, a training pitch with artificial turf. Aspmyra Stadion has hosted one Norway national football team match, against Iceland in 2002.

The venue opened in 1966 as a municipal multi-purpose stadium which included a running track. Glimt reached the top-flight in 1977, and played Cup Winners&#x27; Cup matches in the late 1970s at Aspmyra. The venue had a slight upgrade in 1980, which also saw the laying of all-weather running track and the construction of the training pitch. In 1992, the pitch was resowed, forcing Glimt to play a season in Nordlandshallen, which since has been used twice for Norwegian top division matches. Aspmyra Stadion was sold to Glimt in 1997, followed by the construction of the south and east stands. This involved removing the running track and building commercial and residential properties around the venue. Artificial turf was laid in 2006. After the club received illegal public subsidies in 2008 and had to upgrade the venue, it was in 2011 sold back to the municipality.

==History==
After the establishment of Bodø/Glimt in 1916 and Grand Bodø the following year, the clubs played at various locations throughout the town. The primary venue for the clubs&#x27; elite teams was Bodø Station. By 1962, plans had surfaced for a central stadium for the prime sports clubs. The interest spurred a large protest meeting organized by the various sports clubs in town in support of the municipality building a new venue. Two locations were considered: at Plassmyra, now the location of the Norwegian Aviation Museum, and at Aspmyra. The latter was chosen and the plans were passed by the municipal council in 1963.

Construction started in 1965, with the completion of a grass pitch, a running track and a grandstand consisting of wooden benches for 2,500 spectators. Steel terraces were built on the outer parts of the grandstand site and the other long side. To the south of the stadium, Glimt built an air-supported training hall, which they named &quot;Glimtbobla&quot; (&#x27;The Glimt Bubble&#x27;). The inaugural match at Aspmyra was played in 1966 between the boys&#x27; teams of Glimt and Grand in 1966. In 1980, an all-weather running track was installed and a training pitch with artificial turf, named Aspmyra kunstgressbane, was built south of the stadium.
In 1989, a project was started to bring Bodø/Glimt back to the top league. Among the most important issues was to secure better training facilities, particularly during the Arctic winter. The club proposed upgrading the artificial turf field at Aspmyra with a new field with under-soil heating, in addition to constructing both a new gravel pitch and an indoor training hall with a full-size pitch. The Municipal Committee for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize the artificial turf field over a gravel pitch. They therefore proposed that NOK 3.5 million be allocated to lay under-soil heating on the artificial turf pitch and remove the turf. New artificial turf would be laid at a later date, when funding could be allocated. This was agreed upon, construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training. However, the Football Association of Norway (NFF) stated that the club would not be allowed to play their matches on a gravel pitch, and the grass at Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league, should the team be promoted. The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new artificial turf on the training pitch, which was taken into use in 1990.

Construction of Nordlandshallen—an indoor football venue for winter training—started in 1990 and was completed on 21 September 1991. In 1991, the debate regarding laying a new pitch at the stadium resurfaced. NFF granted permission for Glimt to use Nordlandshallen for the 1992 season, on condition that Aspmyra was ready for use for the 1993 season. The municipality lacked funds for a new pitch, so the parties agreed that the club would borrow NOK 3.5 million to pay for the renovation. The club would pay the interest on the loan until it was taken over by the municipality, but until then, Bodø/Glimt would not pay rent on the stadium. If the municipality was to finance the renovation in a regular manner, funds could not be allocated until the following year, which would cause two seasons to be lost. The new pitch included under-soil heating.

In 1994, Bodø/Glimt started making plans to expand Aspmyra to allow it to host UEFA matches. The company Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling was established to finance the project and own the stands. Details were presented in 1996, which consisted of the company being given the Aspmyra lot, worth NOK 15 million, from the municipality. The initial plans called for seated stands for 10,000 spectators—a quarter of the town&#x27;s population—48 apartments and of commercial property. Funding was proposed to come from selling the residential and commercial properties and grants from NFF and the Ministry of Culture. The project also included new floodlights and a new club house. The municipal chief of administration, Svein Blix, stated that the project would also have to pay for the operation of the new venue and the construction of a new athletics venue, as the plans called to remove the running tracks at Aspmyra.

The municipality gave the necessary permissions for construction in December 1997, but required that the club finance the upgrades, which the club could not afford. Kjell Ove Johansen, CEO of Bodø/Glimt&#x27;s operating company, quit his job in November 1998 in protest against the mayor&#x27;s and councilors&#x27; negative attitude and lack of trust towards Bodø/Glimt regarding the venue plans. On 27 January 1999, the municipal council passed a resolution allowing the venue to be sold to the club for NOK 7.9 million, with the official take-over date being 1 May. In addition, the company would pay NOK 5.5 million to the municipality at a later date, after the venue had become profitable.
Construction started in October 1999, costing NOK 140 million. A new south stand was built with a roof, offices and change rooms, while a smaller stand without a roof was built to the east. The project cost NOK 40 million less than the original plans, in part because no stands were built on the west end. The two new stands had 4,350 seats and the venue was approved for UEFA matches. However, the venue was not allowed to use the old grandstand seating or the terraces for UEFA matches. The two new stands gave the stadium seating for 6,100 and standing room for 2,000 spectators. The first match at the upgraded venue was played on 22 April 2001.

The project also included of commercial property, which was rented out to 13 companies. The commercial part of the stadium was owned by Aspmyra Næringsbygg, which was again owned by several local investors. The stadium received new floodlights, which were bought used from Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo for NOK 5 million. However, there were some initial complaints from Bodø Airport as the lights were a distraction for pilots. The club also considered installing artificial turf, and applied to be UEFA&#x27;s partner to receive a grant to install a pilot turf, but this was instead awarded to Eyravallen in Sweden. On 2 December 2002, Nordlandsbanken bought a third of the shares in Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling from the club, for NOK 10 million, to avoid that the club went bankrupt. In 2003, Bodø/Glimt&#x27;s spent NOK 650,000 on rent and NOK 700,000 in operating costs for the venue.

As compensation for removing the track and field sections, the stadium company had to pay for a new municipal athletics venue at Mørkvedlia. The sales stadium&#x27;s contract also required Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling to build new change room facilities for the training pitch so the uses from teams had the same quality as the main pitch. The company was criticized by the municipality in 2002 for not prioritizing this obligation. The NOK 170,000 it cost to move Grand&#x27;s club house and build a change room for the artificial field was covered jointly by the municipality, Grand, Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling and one of Glimt&#x27;s sponsors, Nordland Entreprenør.

In 2003, Aspmyra Næringseiendom converted its debt, then NOK 20.5 million, to Swiss francs. Because of the transaction, within a year the company&#x27;s debt had increased by 10 percent. In 2004, the stadium ownership company changed its name to Aspmyra Stadion AS. The municipality eliminated the stadium company&#x27;s debt of NOK 5.5 million to the municipality in November 2005. This allowed the club&#x27;s operating company to have a positive share capital and the club was thus allowed to keep its license. In May 2006, the grass pitch was replaced with artificial pitch, costing NOK 3.1 million. The training pitch received new turf in 2007.

Following Glimt&#x27;s promotion to the top league in 2008, the club stated that Aspmyra was &quot;out of date&quot; and that investments for NOK 200 million was necessary if the club was to remain in the top tier. Chair Benn Eidissen stated that while Aspmyra was among the country&#x27;s most modern venues in 2001, it would within a few years no longer be in the top-25. He identified funding from regionally differentiated payroll tax (DA-funds), public grants and funding for sponsors as the main sources of financing. Imminent upgrades to the venue for NOK 10 million were done ahead of the 2008 season—financed using DA-funds. It consisted of two specific grants, a NOK 2.2 million subsidy and a ten-year NOK 8.3 million interest and installment-free loan, both to the club. In 2009, the bank deleted NOK 5 million of the stadium debt, reducing it to NOK 14.2 million.

In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who administrated the DA-funds, stating that both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were converted to an interest-bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity to keep its license to play in the top two tiers. Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, the consequence of Innovation Norway&#x27;s proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative equity and could be relegated to the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality.

The municipal council voted on 17 February 2011 to purchase the stadium. The strongest proponents were the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, while three parties, the Progress Party, the Liberal Party and Red Party, voted against. The proponents argued that municipality was purchasing the venue with a much higher value than what they had sold, while the opponents argued that it was not the municipality&#x27;s responsibility to give financial first-aid to a professional sports club. The cost was NOK 16 million, paid for by taking over debt. After taking over the stadium company, the municipality merged it with Bodø Spektrum, which runs an indoor sports complex, including Nordlandshallen. This allows the debt to be taken over by the municipality without interfering with the municipal accounts.

The venue saw only minor improvements to the infrastructure over the next decade, but following Glimt&#x27;s success in 2020 by winning the league and making its first appearance in the qualifying rounds for UEFA Champions League a new stand was built at the west end of the pitch, adding 660 seats to the stadium. During spring 2022 a new stand was built over the standing area in front of the old stand on the north side. This raised the seated capacity by approx. 1,900 to 8,270 seats total in time for the 2022 Norwegian season and together with other improvements in spectator, VIP and media facilities will bring the stadium within UEFA category 4 to be used for group stage matches in European leagues. For their 2021-22 european campaign Bodø/Glimt was given a dispensation from the capacity requirements by UEFA partly due to COVID restrictions limiting the number of spectators in any case, but the dispensation will not be extended for 2022-23.

==Facilities==

The venue is located in the southern part of the town center of Bodø, on Hålogalandsgata, close to Bodø Airport. The venue has a capacity for 8,270 seated spectators. The South Stand has 15 luxury boxes, each with seating for 12 people, and club seating for an additional 100 people in Aspmyra Sportsbar; this is only available for corporate sponsors. Both the sports bar and the boxes have access to dinners before the match. The stand is combined with a commercial and residential building, which is owned by Aspmyra Næringsbygg, which is again controlled by Gunvald Johansen. Bodø/Glimt&#x27;s offices are located in this section, which along with the public access is rented by Glimt. Of sponsorship reasons, the South Stand is named for Diadora.

The North Stand is the oldest part of the venue and is owned by Aspmyra AS. For sponsorship reasons, it is named after Nordlandsbanken. The area behind the East Stand was bought by Bodø Boligbyggelag, who built housing there and is named after Toyota, again for sponsorship reasons. In 2010, the operating costs of the venue were NOK 2 million.

==Events==
Bodø/Glimt are the main tenant at Aspmyra. The record attendance dates from 1975, when 12,189 people attended a Norwegian Football Cup match against Viking. From the 1977 season, Bodø/Glimt played in the First Division, then the top tier of the pyramid. The club remained in to the top flight until it was relegated after the 1980 season. Glimt had a poor spell during the 1980s, playing several seasons in the Third Division. On 5 October 1986, Aspmyra hosted the final of the Junior Football Cup between Bodø/Glimt and Lillestrøm. At the end of 1991, Glimt was promoted to the First Division, then the second tier of the pyramid. However, in the 1992 season, the club played at Nordlandshallen. From the 1993 season, Bodø/Glimt again played in the top flight. Twice, in 1993 and 1997, the final match of the season had to be played in Nordlandshallen because of the poor condition of the turf. Following the installation of floodlights in 2001, the attendance increased by 70 percent at floodlighted evening games, resulting in an increase in the use of evening matches during the spring and fall. Glimt remained in the Premier League until the end of the 2005 season, when they were relegated. They returned again for the 2008 season, but were relegated after the 2009 seasons.

Aspmyra was used for UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup matches in the late 1970s. Bodø/Glimt played Napoli in 1976–77, and Union Luxembourg and Internazionale in 1978–79. During the 1990s, Bodø/Glimt was allowed to play qualification matches for UEFA tournaments at Aspmyra, but the venue was not suitable for games in the ordinary rounds because of lack of floodlights. In the 1994–95 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Glimt played Olimpija Rīga at Aspmyra, but had to play against Sampdoria at Ullevaal Stadion. The team&#x27;s 1996–97 UEFA Cup match against Trabzonspor was played at Ullevaal, although the qualification match against Beitar Jerusalem had been played at Aspmyra. Similarly, in the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup, the qualification against Vaduz was played at Aspmyra, while the first round match against Werder Bremen was played at Lerkendal Stadion in Trondheim. With an upgraded venue, Bodø/Glimt was again allowed to play all their home matches in UEFA tournaments at Aspmyra. In the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, Bodø/Glimt was visited by Levadia Tallinn and Beşiktaş.

In addition to Bodø/Glimt, Grand Bodø also plays matches at Aspmyra. This includes their women&#x27;s team, which has previously played in the Women&#x27;s Premier League. They most recently played in the top league in 2007, when they drew an average 222 spectators. During the 1980s, Grand&#x27;s men&#x27;s club became the town&#x27;s best, playing in the Second Division, the tier above Glimt.

The venue hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships in 1980. The following year, it held the women&#x27;s semi-final in the 1981 European Cup in Athletics. Aspmyra has hosted one Norway national football team match, which resulted in 1–1 against Iceland and filling the venue with 8,126 spectators on 22 May 2002. This still stands as the venue&#x27;s record attendance after the rebuilding. In August 2007, the Norwegian women&#x27;s U-23 team played Sweden at Aspmyra. Concerts held at the venue include Bryan Adams in 2008. In September 2012, the venue hosted the final of the Norwegian rugby league championship between Bodø Barbarians and Oslo Capitals, which the Capitals winning 34–24.

==Future==
In 2008, the club stated that they would either have to renovate Aspmyra for NOK 200 million or build a new stadium elsewhere to remain competitive at a premiership level. Funding was proposed to be a mix of public and sponsor grants, including DA-funds. As part of the planning of a joint Norwegian and Swedish bid for the Euro 2016, Bodø Municipality and Bodø/Glimt proposed that Bodø could build a stadium at Rønvikjordene, in the northern part of the town. The plans were presented in late July 2008; the venue was planned to have a capacity for 30,000 to 35,000 spectators, but would be rebuilt after the tournament to seat 10,000 to 15,000. It was estimated that Bodø/Glimt would need a capacity for 10,000 to 15,000 spectators. In comparison, the population of Bodø was 46,049 in 2008. The new venue was estimated to cost NOK 500 to 700 million and was largely proposed financed with DA-funds. Minister of Culture, Trond Giske, stated that at least one of the venues would have to be in Northern Norway to receive government support for an application. Aspmyra was planned used as a training pitch. Bodø was discarded for the Scandinavian bid, which ultimately was never sent to UEFA. For Aspmyra, the municipality has stated that they have the long-term option to purchase the real estate north of the pitch and can build a new stand there. Alternatively, an estimated NOK 3 million can be used to demolish the stand and redevelop it as a commercial property.

Several possible development schemes for the stadium was presented over the coming decade, but none of them were put into action due to lack of funding and the fact that results and spectator numbers did not make better facilities necessary. Following the continued success of the club from 2019 and onward, a plan has been put forward to build a new stadium on the other side of town, with an 8–10 000 capacity. The project is being developed with a planned date of completion in fall of 2024, when Bodø will be European Capital of Culture.

<text>The Western City Gate (), also known as the Genex Tower () is a 36-story skyscraper in Belgrade, Serbia, which was designed in 1977 by Mihajlo Mitrović in the brutalist style. It is formed by two towers connected with a two-story bridge and revolving restaurant at the top. It is tall (with restaurant ). It remained the tallest building in Serbia and Belgrade for 42 years, until being surpassed by West 65 Tower in 2021. It was also the tallest building in the Balkans for 14 years, until being surpassed by Akbank Tower in Istanbul, Turkey in 1993.

The building is designed to resemble a high-rise gate greeting people arriving in the city from the West (the road from Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport to the city centre leads this way). Disputed and criticized during the designing and construction process, the building is today a dominant landmark in Belgrade. Construction of its eastern complement, the triple Eastern City Gate at the opposite, eastern end of Belgrade, began later, in 1973, but was finished earlier, in 1976.

One of the towers was occupied by the state-owned Genex Group. The tower got its popular name &quot;Genex&quot; after this group, while its official title remains Western City Gate. The second, taller tower, is residential. The tower formerly occupied by the Genex company is empty, while the residential tower is still home to scores of people. The revolving mechanism under the restaurant on top never became operational.

In November 2021, the building was declared a cultural monument and placed under protection. The declaration refers to the building as an &quot;urban lighthouse&quot; and calls it the most striking motif of New Belgrade, and a visual benchmark for the entirety of the capital. Considered avant-garde at the time when built, by the mid 2020s it was still described as the &quot;more progressive than almost anything new built in Serbia&quot;.

== Location ==
The building is located in the municipality of New Belgrade, in the 41-43 &quot;Narodnih heroja&quot; Street. It is actually situated at the corner of the street and the European route E75. West of the gate are the neighborhoods of Studentski Grad and Tošin Bunar, while Fontana is to the north. In the New Belgrade&#x27;s blocks numeration system, the building belongs to the Block 33.

== History ==
=== Construction ===
In the late 1960s, architect Mihajlo Mitrović was given a task of projecting a 12-floor building and the head offices of the local community of Sutjeska, a sub-municipal administrative unit, on &quot;Narodnih heroja&quot; Street. Mitrović suggested two connected and much taller buildings which would make a recognizable symbol of the capital city. A fierce opposition, disagreements and disputes ensued, but Mitrović was persistent in his idea, giving detailed and exhaustive explanations in front of the numerous commissions. He was finally given the green light and the foundations were laid in 1971. The towers were built by the &quot;Rad&quot; construction company.

Nevertheless, the project met with distrust and was disputed all the time the construction was on. One of the rare colleagues who publicly supported Mitrović was Stojan Maksimović, who several years later designed another Belgrade&#x27;s landmark, the Sava Centar. Harsh public polemics with architectural engineer Borislav Stojkov, one of the Belgrade&#x27;s urban planners at the time, and Mitrović caused a rift between the two which was amended only over a decade later. The opposition continued in the next years. Even in the 2010s, a famous caricature by Ivo Kušanić in the daily Politika is still being mentioned and reproduced. It shows a gallows next to the building and the text: Who are these gallows for? For the architect!

=== Privatization ===

&quot;Generalexport&quot;, the company which owned the building went bankrupt in 2015, which was confirmed by the court in March 2017. The commercial half of the tower, with the related garage space, was offered for sale by the bankruptcy manager on 23 May 2022. Asked price was RSD2 billion (€17 million), but no one made an offer. In July 2022 it was offered again, this time for RSD1.46 billion (€12.4 million), or 35% of estimated worth (RSD4.17 billion or €35.5 million).

By the end of 2022, with the third sale attempt—and the property now listed for RSD834.6 million dinars (€7 million or €400 per m2)—scheduled for 6 February 2023, residents, citizens and public figures began to protest the sale, offering ideas for the building&#x27;s future. Building manager, and a group of architects and economists, proposed that state takes over the building due to its importance, and to transform it into the Tesla Tower, &quot;oasis of spirit, culture and architecture&quot;. Five floors were adapted into the Nikola Tesla Museum, which would move into the building. With added science and technology centers, libraries, concert halls, galleries and bookshops, it would make a cultural and educational &quot;Disneyland&quot;, opened non-stop. Proposition includes adaptation of the surrounding plateau, which covers , into the urban garden, theme gardens, park of friendship, outdoor gym, with pedestrian footbridge and revitalized fountain and amphitheater.

Coalition Zajedno also suggested that state should use its pre-emption right to purchase the building, converting its use to an academic campus by naming the University of Belgrade as an administrator while also employing students (architecture, interior design, construction) to adapt the building. A group of electrical engineers suggested addition of Mihajlo Pupin to the joint museum with Tesla, creation of experimental labs and recreation of the Wardenclyffe Tower at the top of Western City Gate. Do not let Belgrade drown political party also supported state ownership of the building. Residents announced blockade of the city&#x27;s central bridge, Gazela, protesting the sale.

After many years, on 12 January 2023, the digital clock display which is located at the top, between two towers, was repaired and became operational.

At the public sale on 6 February 2023, the commercial part of the property was purchased by the Belgrade-based hospitality entrepreneur Aleksandar Kajmaković, nicknamed Aca Bosanac, for RSD2.4 billion (~€20 million), three times its listed price. Kajmaković&#x27;s company Eureka bar, which reportedly outbid six other entities vying for the property, owns numerous hospitality venues around Belgrade such as the traditional Skadarlija kafanas Tri šešira, Dva jelena, and Zlatni bokal, eatery Boutique, and Lafayette cabaret nightclub Police had to intervene as few members of the opposition hеckled the bidding.

Kajmaković is connected to major criminal clans in Serbia, being a right-hand man of the &quot;controversial businessmen&quot; . He was also apprehended by the police as part of the process against the top Serbian gang kingpin for suspicion of Kajmaković acting as the legal owner of Belivuk&#x27;s properties which were safeguarded by the Belivuk&#x27;s gang members, and for money laundering. A bomb was placed under Kajmaković&#x27;s car in 2002 in Budva, Montenegro. Because of his history, the opposition considers Kajmaković a front for the real owner, and called for the annulment of the sale due to the general infringement of the entire process.

Last day to finalize the purchase was 4 April 2023, but &quot;Eureka Bar&quot; filed an extension motion. This was denied and they made the final payment on the last day, becoming official owners of the building. Otherwise, they would also lose the €7 million deposit they had to pay in order to compete in the selling. Tenants of the residential part of the building announced lawsuit against the purchase.

== Characteristics ==
=== Architecture ===
The two towers are not the same height and serve different purposes. The taller tower serves as a residential tower with 30 floors while the shorter tower houses businesses within its 26 floors. A bridge connects the two at the 26th floor. The building is tall.

The building was designed in the brutalist style, with some elements of structuralism and constructivism. It is considered a prime representative of the brutalist architecture in Serbia and one of the best of its style built in the 1960s and the 1970s in the world. The treatment of the form and details is slightly associating the building with postmodernism and is today one of the rare surviving representatives of this style&#x27;s early period in Serbia. The artistic expression of the gate marked an entire era in Serbian architecture.

Commission which declared the building a cultural monument prized the simplicity of solutions, proportional order of two towers and the cylindrical top extension with the rotating mechanism, located above the central axis of the complex. The commission also described the design as specific and bold architectural creation, commending mural, too. Though the mechanism for rotating the circular restaurant at the top was never installed, the restaurant itself was operational. In time, thanks to its exquisite location, it became an elitist gathering point, much to the dismay of Mitrović.

As the structure with &quot;striking form which affirmed it as the pronounced work of art&quot;, the building entered numerous works and encyclopedias, including Larousse. The building was featured in the New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art 2018-2019 exhibition exploring the architecture of the former Yugoslavia, &quot;Toward a Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948–1980&quot;. The building was an inspiration for artist Damjan Dobrila and his 2023 exhibition &quot;Geneks 2389&quot;, with ideas what the structure might look like 366 years in the future.

However, when the residents moved in, it turned out that despite the supreme quality of the exterior design of the double tower, the building was not much resident friendly. Problems included the capacity and malfunctions of the elevators, clogged garbage chutes, bad thermal and sound isolation, and lack of flexibility of the concrete panels which were the main construction material. Similar problems, even worse so, were in the gate&#x27;s eastern counterpart. This raised a question whether people should live in the buildings designed as the symbols and landmarks.

=== Mural ===

In 1979, painted a mural at the entrance. The mural covers the façade and the ceiling above the entrance. It was one of the first murals in Belgrade, predated by the 1970 mural painted on a building in the Bulevar Revolucije, also done by Vujaklija. Another work was added in the 2010s, described by the architects as a &quot;graffiti, which is unsuitable and not a work of art&quot;. After a reaction from the architects, the author of the graffiti decided to paint it over, in an agreement with Mihajlo Mitrović&#x27;s daughter who inherited the author&#x27;s rights.

The mural was commissioned by Mitrović and coincidentally served to commemorate the visit of François Mitterrand, then head of the French Socialist Party, to Yugoslavia. The mural has been described as an &quot;ornament of the tower&quot;.

There is another work of art in the building, the sculpture &quot;Bird&quot; by Miloš Šobajić.

== Protection ==
The building is placed under the preliminary protection. It means it should be treated as if it were protected until the final decision about the protection is made. Association of Serbian Architects in 2019 filed a motion for Western City Gate to become a fully protected cultural monument. On 3 November 2021, the building was declared a cultural monument.

== Local community ==
The local community of Sutjeska had a population of 5,067 in 1981 and 5,187 in 1991. By the time of the 2002 census, it was renamed to the Local Community of Western Gate, after the building, and had a population of 4,278. It was later annexed to the neighboring local community of Fontana.

<text>Mayim Mayim (, &quot;water, water&quot;) is an Israeli folk dance, danced to a song of the same name. It has become notable outside the Israeli dancing community and is often performed at international folk dance events.

==History==
The dance was created in 1937 for a festival to celebrate the discovery of water in the desert after a seven-year search. The choreographer was Else I. Dublon.

The dance is sometimes known as &quot;Ushavtem Mayim&quot;, after the first words of the lyrics, or simply just &quot;Mayim&quot;, but &quot;Mayim Mayim&quot; is the original and most common name. The movement to the first four counts has become known as the &quot;Mayim step&quot; and is similar to the grapevine step found in other forms of dance.

&quot;Mayim Mayim&quot; is done in a circle formation, facing the center through most of the dance, and holding hands except when clapping.

==The song==
The music for Mayim Mayim was composed by Emanuel Pugashov Amiran with lyrics taken from the Book of Isaiah, chapter 12 verse 3, &quot;Joyfully shall you draw water from the fountains of triumph&quot;.

:Ushavtem mayim b&#x27;sason mimainei hayeshua
:Ushavtem mayim b&#x27;sason mimainei hayeshua

:Mayim mayim mayim mayim, hey, mayim b&#x27;sason
:Mayim mayim mayim mayim, hey, mayim b&#x27;sason

:Hey, hey, hey, hey
:Mayim mayim mayim mayim mayim mayim b&#x27;sason
:Mayim mayim mayim mayim mayim mayim b&#x27;sason

==Appearances in gaming==

*A 16 bit arrangement appears in the Super Famicom port of ClockWerx.
*A remixed version appears in Konami&#x27;s &quot;Sexy Parodius&quot;.

<doc id="1252577" wikidata="Q664889" url="?curid=1252577" title="Copy Control">
<text>Copy Control was the generic name of a copy prevention system, used from 2001 until 2006 on several digital audio disc releases by EMI Group and Sony BMG Music Entertainment in several regions (Europe, Canada, United States, and Australia). It should not be confused with the CopyControl computer software copy protection system introduced by Microcosm Ltd in 1989.

Several types of protection existed. While basically intended as a means of copy-protecting compact discs, Copy Control discs cannot properly be referred to as CDs because the system introduces incompatible data, making the discs non-compliant with the Red Book standard for audio CDs. The system is intended to prevent digital audio extraction (&quot;ripping&quot;) from the protected discs, and thus limit the file sharing of ripped music. The techniques used are:

* Multisession (Blue Book) information is included which effectively hides the audio tracks from most CD-ROM drives;
* Error-correction codes for the audio data are corrupted, which may introduce audible errors to ripped copies.
* The data area of the disc usually includes DRM-restricted copies of the audio content, for which a player only exists on the dominant PC operating system, Microsoft Windows.

In the Netherlands, the record labels Sony and Universal experimented with copy control until 2004. EMI kept using it until June 2006, when they dropped it.

In the United States, Universal Music Group experimented with copy control on a few soundtracks in 2001 and 2002, but abandoned it afterwards; Warner Music Group has only used it in Europe on such releases as Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Music&quot;. As of September 2006, Cactus Data Shield, the Macrovision technology behind Copy Control, is no longer listed as a product on Macrovision&#x27;s website and has completely been abandoned in countries such as Australia.

A December 2006 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine announced that EMI had decided to abandon Copy Control worldwide. Until then, it had been unclear whether EMI had completely abandoned it, as there was no press release.

== Background ==
The Copy Control protections were devised in response to the file sharing and casual CD copying that has become commonplace in recent years, allegedly causing the music industry significant losses, or &quot;ungained&quot; revenues. Neither issue was particularly relevant when the CD standard was introduced in the early 1980s, and thus, unlike the more recent DVDs, the CD standard specifies no inherent form of copy protection or other digital rights management. Copy Control is one of a number of attempts to apply copy protection on top of the CD standard, but since it is merely a modification of the already unrestricted standard that must still yield usable results in most CD players, the efficacy of the system varies significantly. Nevertheless, EMI&#x27;s labelling of some Copy Controlled discs attempted to override consumers&#x27; statutory rights with the disclaimer &quot;except for defective product resulting from the manufacturing process, no exchange, return or refund is permitted&quot;.

== Circumvention ==
A Copy Control disc will appear as a mixed-mode disc, with audio and data content. Under Windows, inserting the disc will usually autorun an audio player utility, which plays the DRM-protected audio files provided. This can be temporarily disabled by holding down the shift key while inserting the disc on Windows XP and earlier, users of Windows Vista and 7 may simply choose not to run the DRM content.

The ability to extract the CD-Audio tracks is otherwise largely dependent on the disc drive used. The first obstacle is the &quot;fake&quot; Table of Contents (ToC), which is intended to mask the audio tracks from CD-ROM drives. However CD-R/RW drives, and similar, can usually access all session data on a disc, and thus can properly read the audio segment.

The other major obstacle is the incompatible (and technically corrupted) error-correction data. Again, the effect of this is dependent on the disc drive; some drives will be able to read the data without problems, but others will produce audio files with loud pops every few seconds. As a consequence of having faulty error-correction codes, the discs may be less resilient to anything that might cause a read error, such as dust and scratches resulting from normal use.

Copy Control also does not prevent copying a disc by recording it as analog audio through a computer&#x27;s sound card, which only causes a slight degradation in audio quality. More substantial is the loss in recording speed. This weakness, inherent in all digital copy prevention systems, is known as the &quot;analog hole&quot;. As an alternative that does not rely on the &quot;analog hole&quot;, it may be possible to copy the content using a digital link while playing it through a sound card that has a digital audio output.

Usually a CD-R/RW drive will play the disc but with occasional stops (about every 10 seconds) and DVD-R/RW drives will be able to read the data without problems and can be ripped straight to the PC. CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drives in a computer will usually refuse to play the data except in the provided player.

Systems other than Windows can just as easily play Copy Control discs, as many players on Windows are proprietary and respect the copy-restrictions. Similarly, the auto-launchers are only written for Windows and will only ambush Windows users (this can be mitigated by disabling autorun). There is little that can be done to stop a user who is not running Windows or who is using non-Microsoft CD ripping software from ripping a Copy Control disc.

In Linux, Copy Control discs are easily accessed through cdparanoia or any other software that uses it, such as the KDE &quot;audiocd:/&quot; service.

In Mac OS X, these discs are easily accessed through iTunes and QuickTime (When a CDDA track is dragged to a folder other than the CD, QuickTime automatically converts it to AIFF, which is a lossless PCM format).

== Content on the CD extra ==

;CDS-100 or CDS-200
:A player and a media file database (a copy of the audio contents in Windows Media). The player will only play the audio contents in the media file database.
;CDS-300
:A player and the anti-copy program only. The player can ignore the anti-copy program to read the audio tracks. The player allow users to play the tracks, rip the audio tracks as DRM-enabled WMA files and burn CD for 3 times (The player will rip the CD as 320 kbit/s WMA files, then burn the audio on a CD-R, notice that the volume is lower and the quality is worse on the burned CD).

<doc id="1252580" wikidata="Q1681283" url="?curid=1252580" title="James Webb (historian)">
<text>James Charles Napier Webb (13 January 1946 – 9 May 1980) was a Scottish historian and biographer. He was born in Edinburgh, and was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. He is remembered primarily for his books &quot;The Harmonious Circle&quot;, &quot;The Occult Underground&quot; (originally titled &quot;Flight from Reason&quot;), and &quot;The Occult Establishment&quot;. He has been characterised as &quot;an important pioneer in the academic study of Western esotericism&quot;.
==Life and career==

In 1980 his important biography of G. I. Gurdjieff, titled &quot;The Harmonious Circle&quot;, was published. He spent 8 years researching the book, making contacts with the Gurdjieff community worldwide. The New York Review of Books described Webb&#x27;s research and knowledge of the subject as &quot;extremely comprehensive&quot;, and Mistlberger described the book as &quot;scholarly and occasionally gossipy&quot; with Webb being &quot;unquestionably a sincere researcher&quot; who became &quot;deeply involved in the matter of his subject&quot; while remaining &quot;fundamentally an outsider, an investigative journalist&quot;. Tamdgidi wrote that, amongst all the biographers of Gurdjieff, &quot;only Webb claimed to have been independent and outside the circle of Gurdjieff&#x27;s followers&quot;, and in 2004, in &quot;Inventors of Gurdjieff&quot;, Paul Beekman Taylor described &quot;The Harmonious Circle&quot; as &quot;the first systematic biographical account by a writer who hadn&#x27;t known Gurdjieff personally&quot; Webb established that Gurdjieff&#x27;s writings revealed substantial evidence of familiarity with the languages and cultures of central Asia, but Webb regarded Gurdjieff more as a self-taught innovator than a member of an esoteric Asiatic group, and, although seeing some of its forms having derived from Asia, saw the content of his teachings deriving from western occult traditions.

Webb&#x27;s theories of Gurdjieff&#x27;s identity as a Russian foreign agent in Central Asia, and theories on where he actually travelled before 1917, are considered controversial points in &quot;The Harmonious Circle&quot;.

Webb&#x27;s work challenges theories of secularism, theories of decline in organised religion and spirituality. Webb argued that the 19th and 20th centuries had also been marked by a revolt against the Enlightenment, and that the rise of &quot;irrationalism&quot; was much more marked than the rise of rationalism, especially before, during and after the First World War and the Second World War. Webb traced the influence of occult and mystical groups and writers on literature, philosophy and politics.

Webb was generally ignored in his lifetime, but with the increasing rise of New Age spirituality in later years, his work now seems increasingly prescient. After increasing mental health difficulties, Webb committed suicide in 1980.

His major works &quot;The Occult Underground&quot; and &quot;The Occult Establishment&quot; were translated into German and published in 2009 and 2008 respectively.

Trinity College established the &quot;James Webb Prize for the History of Ideas&quot; in his memory.

==Influence==
Webb&#x27;s work has been recognised as a precursor to the academic study of esotericism which would later be inaugurated as a formalised field by historians Antoine Faivre and Wouter Hanegraaff in the 1990s.

Historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke argued that &quot;By focusing on functional significance of occultism in political irrationalism, Webb rescued the study of Nazi occultism for the history of ideas.&quot;

Webb&#x27;s notion of &quot;rejected knowledge&quot; was influential on the work of Hanegraaff.

<doc id="1252584" wikidata="Q4970949" url="?curid=1252584" title="British Rail regional multiple unit numbering">
<text>:&quot;Southern Region units are excluded from this page, as they perpetuated the four-digit numbering series commenced by the Southern Railway - see SR Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification.&quot;

Prior to the introduction of TOPS, electric multiple unit numbers were allocated by British Rail regions in their own series. Diesel multiple units did not carry unit numbers at first, but the Scottish and Western Regions later adopted their own series for these units, whilst elsewhere individual depots allocated unit numbers, often prefixed by their two-letter TOPS depot code (e.g. TS for Tyseley).

When TOPS numbers were applied to multiple units, the unit numbers were prefixed by the class number to make the new six-digit unit numbers. These regional series have been perpetuated since TOPS because it eases the description of individual units and avoids potential confusion if there is only one unit with a particular identifier working in a certain area.

==Diesel Multiple Units==
===London Midland Region===
There was no regional number series for DMUs: individual depots had their own series, prefixed by their two-letter TOPS depot code. The table below shows the series used by Tyseley depot (in the Western Region until 9 September 1963).
===Scottish Region===
The table below shows the broad arrangement of numbers, though a couple of Class 104 units took numbers in the 3xx series. Class 107 units were later renumbered twice, first to 7xx following introduction of the Class 156 with 4xx unit numbers in the Regional Railways Sprinter series, and then to 0xx following introduction of the Class 158 with 7xx unit numbers in the same series.
===Western Region===
Unit numbers were prefixed by a letter (letters prior to 1970) to indicate which area (or depot) the unit was allocated to. The table below lists the prefixes used; Tyseley had transferred to the London Midland Region by the time the 1971 changes took place so was not included, though it did shorten its prefix to TS.
The unit number ranges used were:

Before 1970 unit numbers were not generally painted on the ends of the units, but at some depots were carried on boards visible through the driver&#x27;s cab windows. Also, each depot used its own number range within the overall scheme outlined above, so that there could be (and was) a Bristol-based Cross-Country set BL516 and a Cardiff-based set CDF516 at the same time! Inter-depot transfers meant frequent renumbering of sets, so that in about 1970 the fleet was renumbered into a common Region-wide series and from about 1972 permanent set numbers began to be painted (or applied by transfers) onto the ends of units, beneath the right-hand driver&#x27;s cab window (as viewed looking directly at the front of the unit).

===Network SouthEast===
NSE adopted the former Western Region series, and expanded it to include diesel multiple units used on the former London Midland Region, which took unit numbers in the 7xx series. This included units from classes 101, 104, 108 and 117.

===Regional Railways===
Sprinter (Class 15x) units carried the last three digits of their carriage numbers in the 52xxx and 57xxx series. The 6xx series was reserved for the aborted Class 157, and was adopted by refurbished Class 143 601-625 and 101 651-695. Refurbished class 117 and 122 kept their Tyseley 3xx and Laira (Western Region) 1xx unit numbers respectively.

==Electric Multiple Units==
===Eastern Region===
When introduced, Class 306 were numbered 01-92 and Class 307 01s-32s. These numbers were amended as they were converted from 1500 V DC to 25 kV AC operation. Parcels and departmental units in the 99x series have included Classes 308/4, 302/9, 316 and 937.

<text>Rolf Maximilian Sievert (; 6 May 1896 – 3 October 1966) was a Swedish medical physicist whose major contribution was in the study of the biological effects of ionizing radiation.

The sievert (Sv), the SI unit representing the stochastic health risk of ionizing radiation, is named for him. He has been called the &quot;Father of Radiation Protection&quot;.

==Biography==
Sievert was born in Stockholm, Sweden. His parents were Max Sievert and Sofia Carolina Sievert, née Panchéen. In 1881, his father founded the Max Sievert Company in Stockholm.

Sievert served as head of the physics laboratory at Sweden&#x27;s Radiumhemmet from 1924 to &#x27;37, after which he was appointed head of the department of radiation physics at the Karolinska Institute. He played a pioneering role in the measurement of doses of radiation especially in its use in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In later years, he focused his research on the biological effects of repeated exposure to low doses of radiation.

He was a founder of the International X-ray and Radium Protection Committee (IXRPC) in 1928, and served as it first chairman; this later became the ICRP. He also chaired the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR).

Sievert invented a number of instruments for measuring radiation doses, the most widely known being the Sievert chamber.

==Legacy==
In 1979, at the Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (General Conference on Weights and Measures or CGPM), the SI unit for ionizing radiation dose equivalent was named after him and given the name sievert (Sv).

Sievert had an extensive insect collection and his specimens can be found in the Entomological Museum of Lund University in Sweden.

<doc id="1252603" wikidata="Q713459" url="?curid=1252603" title="Tex Rickard">
<text>George Lewis &quot;Tex&quot; Rickard (January 2, 1870 – January 6, 1929) was an American boxing promoter, founder of the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL), and builder of the third incarnation of Madison Square Garden in New York City. During the 1920s, Tex Rickard was the leading promoter of the day, and he has been compared to P. T. Barnum and Don King. Sports journalist Frank Deford has written that Rickard &quot;first recognized the potential of the star system.&quot; Rickard also operated several saloons, hotels, and casinos, all named Northern and located in Alaska, Nevada, and Canada.

==Early years==
Rickard was born in Kansas City, Missouri. His youth was spent in Sherman, Texas, where his parents had moved when he was four years old. His father died, and his mother then moved to Henrietta, Texas, while he was still a young boy. Rickard became a cowboy at age 11, after the death of his father. At age 23, he was elected marshal of Henrietta, Texas. He acquired the nickname &quot;Tex&quot; at this time. 

On July 2, 1894, Rickard married Leona Bittick, whose father was a physician in Henrietta. On February 3, 1895, their son, Curtis L. Rickard, was born. However, Leona Rickard died on March 11, 1895, and Curtis Rickard died on May 4, 1895.

==Alaska==
In November 1895, Rickard went to Alaska, drawn by the discovery of gold there. Thus he was in the region when he learned of the nearby Klondike Gold Rush of 1897. Along with most of the other residents of Circle City, Alaska, he hurried to the Klondike, where he and his partner, Harry Ash, staked claims. They eventually sold their holdings for nearly $60,000. They then opened the Northern, a saloon, hotel, and gambling hall in Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. Rickard lost everything—including his share of the Northern—through gambling. While working as a poker dealer and bartender at the Monte Carlo saloon and gambling hall, he and Wilson Mizner began promoting boxing matches. In spring 1899, with only $35, Rickard (and many others) left to chase the gold strikes in Nome, Alaska. 

Rickard was a friend of Wyatt Earp who was also a boxing fan and had officiated a number of matches during his life, including the infamous match between Bob Fitzsimmons and Tom Sharkey in San Francisco on December 2, 1896. Rickard sent Earp a number of letters belittling Wyatt&#x27;s steady but small income managing a store in St. Michael as &quot;chickenfeed&quot; and persuaded him to relocate to Nome. The two were lifelong friends, although for a brief period of time, they operated competing saloons in Nome. Earp and a partner owned the Dexter Saloon, and Rickard owned the Northern hotel and bar. 

In 1902, Rickard married Edith Mae Haig of Sacramento, California. They had a daughter, Bessie, who died in 1907. Edith Rickard died on October 30, 1925, at her home in New York City.

==Nevada==
By 1906, Rickard was running the Northern saloon and casino in Goldfield, Nevada. In Goldfield, he promoted a professional boxing match between Joe Gans and Battling Nelson. The gate receipt of $69,715 set a record. A year later, Rickard opened the Northern Hotel in Ely, Nevada. Rickard also organized the Ely Athletic club and was the owner of several mining properties in the Ely area. 

In December 1909, Rickard and John Gleason won the right to stage the world heavyweight championship fight between James J. Jeffries and Jack Johnson. Rickard planned to hold the fight on July 4, 1910, in San Francisco, however opposition from Governor James Gillett and Attorney General Ulysses S. Webb caused Rickard to move it to Reno, Nevada. Rickard and Gleason made a profit of about $120,000 on the fight, which was won by Johnson.

==South America==
On February 18, 1911, Rickard announced that he was &quot;through with the business of prize fighting&quot; and set sail for Argentina.
There, he acquired between 270,000 and 327,000 acres in Paraguay to start a cattle ranch. Rickard managed the ranch for the Farquhar syndicate, whose land holdings in South America total over 5 million acres. At its peak, the ranch consisted of about 1 million acres and had between 20,000 and 50,000 head of cattle. In 1913, Rickard&#x27;s ranch was involved in a political controversy between Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil. Two of his employees were killed by Bolivian soldiers stationed in the disputed territory. That same year, Rickard accompanied Theodore Roosevelt on part of the Roosevelt–Rondon Scientific Expedition. The cattle business failed by the end of 1915. Rickard&#x27;s loss was stated to be about $1 million.

==Hockey==
According to NHL.com, in 1924, Tex Rickard was the first man to refer to the Montreal Canadiens as &quot;the Habs.&quot; Rickard apparently told a reporter that the &quot;H&quot; on the Canadiens&#x27; sweaters was for &quot;Habitants&quot;. At the time, this was a pejorative term equivalent to &quot;redneck&quot; in Canadian French.

==Return to boxing==

In 1916, Rickard returned to the United States. On February 3, Jess Willard agreed to Rickard&#x27;s offer to fight Frank Moran in New York City. The fight was held on March 17, 1916, at Madison Square Garden, then in its second incarnation, at 26th Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan. The $152,000 in gate receipts set a new record for an indoor event and the purse was the largest ever awarded for a no decision.

Rickard promoted the July 4, 1919, fight between world heavyweight champion Jess Willard and Jack Dempsey in Toledo, Ohio. The fight only drew 20,000 to 21,000 spectators (the area seated 80,000) and the total receipts were estimated to be $452,000. After expenses, Rickard made a profit of $100,000. 

After the Willard–Dempsey fight, Rickard began bidding for a title match between Dempsey and Georges Carpentier. The Jack Dempsey vs. Georges Carpentier fight took place on July 2, 1921, in a specially built arena in Jersey City, New Jersey. The bout, which drew a record crowd of 90,000, was the first-ever boxing fight to produce a million dollar gate (at a then record of $1,789,238) as well as the first world title fight to be carried over on radio. Rickard&#x27;s profit on the fight was reported to be $550,000. 

On July 12, 1920, shortly after the Walker Law reestablished legal boxing in the state of New York, Rickard secured a ten-year lease of Madison Square Garden from its owner, the New York Life Insurance Company. He promoted a number of championship as well as amateur boxing bouts at the Garden. His largest gate at the Garden came from the Jack Dempsey–Bill Brennan fight on December 14, 1920. The Benny Leonard–Ritchie Mitchell and Johnny Wilson–Mike O&#x27;Dowd fights also drew well. In addition to boxing, Rickard hosted a number of other events, including six-day bicycle races, and constructed the world&#x27;s largest indoor swimming pool at the Garden.

On February 17, 1922, Rickard was indicted on charges of abducting and sexually assaulting four underage girls. He lost his license to make and promote boxing matches in New York State and gave up control of the Garden. Rickard was found not guilty on one of the indictments on March 29, 1922, and the others were dropped as a result. After the trial, Rickard&#x27;s attorney, Max Steuer, accused two workers of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children of demanding $50,000 from Rickard in exchange for the girls changing their testimony at trial; however, the district attorney could not find any evidence to corroborate this claim.

On May 12, 1923, Rickard promoted the first boxing card at Yankee Stadium. It drew 60,000 spectators (a then-record crowd for a boxing bout in New York state) and made $182,903.26, which was donated to Millicent Hearst&#x27;s Milk Fund.

On September 14, 1923, Rickard promoted his second million dollar gate when around 100,000 people attended the Jack Dempsey vs. Luis Ángel Firpo fight at the Polo Grounds.

In September 1924, Rickard promoted the fight between Luis Ángel Firpo and Harry Willis in Jersey City. The fight was attended by 60,000, but the paid attendance was only 48,500. Rickard lost $5,005 on the bout.

On March 19, 1925, Rickard was convicted of violating a federal law that prevented the interstate transportation of fight films. He faced jail time, but was instead fined $7,000.

In 1926, Rickard promoted the Jack Dempsey–Gene Tunney fight at Sesquicentennial Stadium in Philadelphia. The bout attracted a world record crowd of 135,000 and brought in a record gate of $1.895 million. He also promoted the rematch, now known as The Long Count Fight, which was held on September 22, 1927, at Soldier Field in Chicago. This fight brought in the first $2 million gate ($2.658 million) and was the first to feature a $1 million purse. Rickard reported that between 1924 and 1926 his gate receipts totaled $7.79 million, of which he kept 80% after taxes.

==Madison Square Garden==
On May 31, 1923, Rickard filed incorporation papers for the New Madison Square Garden Corporation, a company formed for the purpose of building and operating a new sports arena in New York City. In 1924 he purchased a car barn block on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. He acquired the rights to the name Madison Square Garden, as the building&#x27;s owners planned on tearing it down and replacing it with an office building. Thomas W. Lamb was selected to design the new building. Destruction of the car barns began on January 9, 1925. The new arena opened on November 28, 1925. The first event was the preliminaries for the Six Days of New York. It hosted its first major event on December 11, 1925, when a record indoor crowd of 20,000 attended the Paul Berlenbach-Jack Delaney fight. The $148,155 gate broke the record for an indoor boxing event. 

In January 1926, Rickard purchased WWGL radio, which he moved to the Garden and renamed WMSG.

Following the success of the New York Americans in the Garden&#x27;s first year, the Madison Square Garden Corporation decided to establish a second team, this one controlled by the corporation itself. The new team was nicknamed &quot;Tex&#x27;s Rangers&quot; and later became known as the New York Rangers.

==Other ventures==
Rickard sought to repeat the success of the Madison Square Garden by building seven &quot;Madison Square Gardens&quot; around the country. In 1927, a group led by Rickard signed a 25-year lease for a sports arena at the new North Station facility in Boston. The Boston Garden opened on November 17, 1928.

In 1929, Rickard and George R. K. Carter opened the Miami Beach Kennel Club greyhound track. They also planned a number of other ventures, including a jai-alai grounds adjacent to the kennel club and a horse track on an island in Biscayne Bay. Rickard also hoped to someday to build a hotel and casino that would rival those in Monte Carlo. 

==Personal life==
Rickard met Maxine Hodges, a former actress 33 years his junior at the Dempsey–Firpo fight. The couple married on October 7, 1926, in Lewisburg, West Virginia. On June 7, 1927, the couple&#x27;s daughter, Maxine Texas Rickard, was born.
On December 26, 1928, Rickard left New York for Miami Beach, Florida, where he was completing arrangements for a fight between Jack Sharkey and Young Stribling and attending the opening of the Miami Beach Kennel Club. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Rickard was stricken with appendicitis and was operated on. Rickard died on January 6, 1929, due to complications from his appendectomy. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, NY.

<doc id="1252608" wikidata="Q698632" url="?curid=1252608" title="Bryndza">
<text>Bryndza or brynza is a sheep milk cheese made across the countries in Central and Eastern Europe, most notably in Slovakia. Bryndza cheese is creamy white in appearance, known for its characteristic strong smell and taste. The cheese is white, tangy, crumbly and slightly moist. It has characteristic odor and flavor with a notable taste of butyric acid. The overall flavor sensation begins slightly mild, then goes strong and finally fades to a salty finish. Recipes differ slightly across countries.

Bryndza is an essential ingredient in preparing traditional Slovak dishes such as &quot;podplamenníky s bryndzou&quot; or &quot;bryndzové halušky&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Bryndza&quot; or &quot;Brynza&quot;, a word borrowed from Romanian &quot;brânză&quot; (&quot;cheese&quot;), is used in various European countries, due to its introduction by migrating Vlachs. The word &quot;brânză&quot; () is simply the generic word for &quot;cheese&quot; in Romanian.

According to the Romanian Explanatory Dictionary the etymology of ”brânză” is unknown.
It is a word presumably inherited by the Romanian language from Dacian, the language of the pre-Roman population in modern-day Romania. Other theories suggest, on the basis of what is used to make cheese, a derivation from Latin brandeum (originally meaning a linen covering, later a thin cloth for relic storage). Alternatively, it is possibly related to Albanian brëndës (“intestines”). Originally it referred to cheeses prepared in a sheep&#x27;s stomach by reacting with the rennet inside. Outside Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine and the flanking regions of southern Poland, it is still popular nowadays in the Czech Republic under the Czech spelling &quot;brynza&quot;.

Other regional names for the product include &quot;juhtúró&quot; in Hungarian, &quot;брынза&quot; in Russian, &quot;brenca&quot; in Serbian, &quot;Brimsen&quot; in German, &quot;бринза&quot; and &quot;бринзя&quot; in Ukrainian and &quot;ברינזע&quot; in Yiddish.

==History==
The word was first recorded as &quot;brençe&quot;, described as &quot;Vlach cheese&quot;, in the Croatian port of Dubrovnik in 1370. Bryndza was first recorded in the Slovak counties of Hungary in 1470 and in the adjacent Polish region of Podhale in 1527.
In Slovakia, bryndza is regarded as a typically Slovak product and it is one of the main ingredients in the national dish bryndzové halušky. The modern version of the soft spreadable bryndza is believed to have been developed by entrepreneurs from Stará Turá (Western Slovakia) toward the end of the 18th century. They founded bryndza manufactures in mountainous regions of Central and Northern Slovakia, where local sheep cheese manufacturing had deep roots. They traded bryndza and popularized it all around the Austrian Habsburg monarchy. In Austria, it was called Liptauer, after the northern Slovak Liptov region. The Viennese speciality Liptauer, a savoury cheese-based spread, has replaced bryndza with common cows&#x27; milk cottage cheese because the original Slovak bryndza disappeared from Austrian market after the Dissolution of Austria-Hungary.

==Geographical indications==
* &quot;Slovak bryndza&quot; from Slovakia was registered in the EU&#x27;s &quot;Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications&quot; on 16 July 2008 as a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). The geographical indication was requested on 4 October 2007. Slovak bryndza must contain at least 50% of sheep milk. &quot;Sheep (ovčia) bryndza&quot; contains 100% sheep cheese.

<doc id="1252610" wikidata="Q22096718" url="?curid=1252610" title="Short punt formation">
<text>The short punt formation is an older formation on both offense and defense in American football, popular when scoring was harder and a good punt was itself an offensive weapon. In times when punting on third down was fairly common, teams would line up in the short punt formation and offer the triple threat of punt, run or pass. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in 1915 called it &quot;the most valuable formation known to football.&quot; 

The formation is similar to the single wing and modern shotgun by including the possibility of a long snap from center. However, it is generally a balanced formation, and there are backs on both sides of the tailback, offering better pass protection. As a result, it was considered a much better passing formation than running, as the premiere running formation was the single wing. That said, it was regarded as a good formation for trap plays.

==History==

The formation was invented by Amos Alonzo Stagg in 1896. Andy Smith, coach of California&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Teams&quot; summed up the short-punt philosophy with his motto of &quot;Kick and wait for the breaks.&quot; In the early days of the sport the ball was often moved up the field, not through offensive plays, but rather through punting. Once the opposing team got the ball, the defense was relied upon to make the other team&#x27;s offense lose yards or fumble. To confuse the opponent and attain longer punts, the punting was often done on first or second downs and it was not uncommon for a team to kick more than 40 times in a game.

The formation was used extensively by Fielding Yost&#x27;s &quot;point-a-minute&quot;, hurry up Michigan Wolverines in their early history, as well as his disciple Dan McGugin&#x27;s Vanderbilt Commodores. Bill Roper used the short punt at Princeton.

===Pro football===
The short punt was the base formation for the Benny Friedman-led New York Giants in 1931. In the 1956 NFL Championship, the Chicago Bears shifted into a short punt formation in the third quarter, after falling way behind.

<doc id="1252627" wikidata="Q4644180" url="?curid=1252627" title="7th Sea (collectible card game)">
<text>7th Sea is an out-of-print collectible card game (CCG) first designed by Dan Verssen and published by Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG) from 1999 to 2002. 

Its theme is swashbuckling nautical adventure found in classic stories like Treasure Island. It is set in the world of Théah shared with the &quot;7th Sea&quot; tabletop role-playing game.

==Setting==
In the &quot;7th Sea CCG&quot;, players take the role of naval captains in the fantasy-Restoration world of Théah. The game attempted to capture the feeling of a Hollywood pirate battle, complete with huge galleys, cannon-shot exchanges, and daring sea boardings. The game also has aspects of adventuring, treasure seeking, and the occult.

As with most of the games of AEG, &quot;7th Sea&quot; had a complex storyline that affected and was influenced by the RPG setting. The results of tournaments would function to guide the storyline, and the storyline in turn would be used to create new cards.

==Basics==
The game had many interesting concepts, including multiple winning conditions and a unique swashbuckling-themed combat system. The most important aspects were deck building, rules, and storyline.

===Terms===
The game used a number of terms to describe elements of game play:

* Faction: The many factions in the game corresponded either to the navies of Théah&#x27;s different nations, pirates, or other independent fleets. Almost every crew character belonged to a faction, though some were unaligned and thus available to be used by any player.
* Captain: The leading character on a ship and most important crewmember. Captains followed special rules and were often central to the faction&#x27;s storyline.
* Ship: There were many ships with various abilities. Each player would use one ship for the entire game, as well as one captain and crew. Faction ships could only be used with a captain of the corresponding faction, while unaligned ships were available to anyone.
* Crew: The rest of a ship&#x27;s characters. A player could build a crew from all factions but the starting crew could not consist of a faction distinct from the ship.
* Seas: The environment of the ship. Five pre-constructed cards delineated the game space.
* Tack: When a card&#x27;s ability was used for the turn, it was turned sideways and could not be used again. This was called &#x27;tacking.&#x27; Tacking also resulted from damage.

===Cards===
The six types of cards in &quot;7th Sea&quot; were: Actions, Crew, Adventures, Attachments, Chanteys and Ships. Each card is played differently as explained below.

====Crew====
The most important card type in &quot;7th Sea&quot; is Crew. This card type combines the traditional CCG concepts of both a resource type and a creature type. Most CCGs use some kind of card type to produce resources that they subsequently use to gain other items. Usually those resources do not contribute to anything else. Examples of this are &quot;lands&quot; from &quot;&quot; and &quot;holdings&quot; from &quot;Legend of the Five Rings&quot;. Most games also have some kind of creature card that provides offence and defense, like M:TG&#x27;s creatures and &quot;Doomtown&quot;&#x27;s Dudes. The game combined both while also providing multiple resource types and multiple combat procedures.

Crew are the sailors you have hired to man the ship. Your Captain is a special and important kind of crew but he still performs in much the same way any other crew.

Crew cards have the following statistics:

** Cost: This is the amount of Influence (a type of resource, much like &#x27;mana&#x27; in &quot;Magic: the Gathering&quot;, or &#x27;gold&#x27; in &quot;Legend of the Five Rings&quot;) that you must provide to hire that crew and a measure of the card&#x27;s overall power.
** Faction: This symbol denoted the faction this crew belongs to. Crews without a symbol were unaligned.
** Cannon: This statistic represented the crew&#x27;s skill with a cannon. Its primary function was to perform cannon attacks upon other ships, simply by &quot;tacking&quot; a crew with more than 0 cannon ability.
** Sailing: This statistic represented the crew&#x27;s skill at sailing. A crew with sufficient sailing ability could &quot;tack&quot; to move the ship by one sea.
** Adventuring: This statistic represented the crew&#x27;s abilities in exploration and adventuring. This skill was mostly used to complete the requirements for &quot;Adventure&quot; cards, which would then bestow benefits upon that crewmember, the ship, or upon the player in other ways.
** Influence: A measure of a crew&#x27;s wealth, charisma, and diplomatic skills. Influence is required to hire more crew, and as a result, it is the most important ability in the first few turns of the game.
** Swashbuckling: This measures the ability of the crew to repair the ship, in effect providing &quot;damage soak&quot; and how effective the crew is at Mêlée. This translates as damage (hits) inflicted from a successful boarding attack.

Crews also had various traits that allowed them to use certain cards. Some of the most common traits were:
** Swordsman: The crew&#x27;s skill in mêlée measured with a number (+1, +3 etc.). It translates as extra damage in boardings, and it allowed the crew to attach &quot;swordsman school&quot; attachment cards. All captains had some level of Swordsmanship.
** Heroic/Villainous: These mutually exclusive traits revealed a crew&#x27;s &quot;way of life&quot;. There were various cards that were compatible with one of these two traits. For most of the history of the game, Villainous was considered a better trait to have on your Captain, since it gave access to easy card draw.
** Sorcery: There were various types of sorcery in the world of Théah, and various crew could use them as attachments. However those attachments had a specific sorcery requirement of a certain level (0–2) that the crew had to have to attach them.

Each ship had a limited amount of space for crew and that meant that smaller ships usually had lower resource and offensive capabilities. Usually this was balanced out with different benefits, like stronger special abilities and lower sailing costs.
Players usually chose crew for their deck depending on their style and their faction&#x27;s strengths, usually focusing on one or two statistics and maybe a trait (like sorcery). Crew with sailing or swashbuckling were always useful due to their innate use on movement and damage soak, however players also focused on more than one or two of the other three skills, Cannon, Adventuring, and Influence so as to be able to use specific cards more easily. Decks which focused on many skills together were the most difficult to build, however a good player then had a much greater versatility.

Crew cards had a Punch as their boarding attack.

====Actions====
Action cards are the surprises you can spring on an unsuspecting opponent. They are one-use cards that have some immediate effect.
In &quot;7th Sea&quot;, action cards had two costs. One was for the player and the other for his target (the canceling cost) and it was in the form of Skill: number. Costs are paid by tacking one or more crew with the appropriate skill, until the number is fulfilled.
The canceling cost was there for the target of the action, and it allowed him to cancel the action by paying it. Thus some pretty powerful cards could be balanced by having a lower canceling cost. Cost and cancel need not use the same skill.

Action cards came in two types, Acts and Reacts.
Acts are cards a player used in his turn. They usually worked to provide some unexpected effect, such as a combined cannon attack or an unstoppable boarding.
Reacts are the much more common form of action cards. They can only be played on specific triggers such as an augment to a cannon attack, or suffering hits instead of a boarding attack.

All decks employed action cards, and usually the more aggressive decks employed a greater number.

Action cards&#x27; boarding attack could either be a Dagger or a Slash.

====Attachments====
Attachment cards are default enhancing cards for your other cards (the other being adventures). After the player pays the cost, he chooses an appropriate card to attach it to. Usual targets for attachments were:
** Crew: Attachments ranged from pistols and earrings, to parrots and spells.
** Ship: Ship attachments usually modified the ship in some way, such as a treasure hold, better sails, figureheads (usually specific to factions) etc. Some ship attachments had the drawback that they took up &quot;crew space&quot;.
** Sea: Sea attachments usually were ports, monsters, and allies you could employ. These often required a specific sea.

Usually attachments had some kind of trait that classified it, such as &quot;Item&quot;, &quot;Henchman&quot;, &quot;Pet&quot;, &quot;Swordsman School&quot;, etc. For example, a &quot;pistol&quot; would be an Item while &quot;Rum Runners&quot; would be an Ally. These traits were used to specify targets for other cards.

In later sets requirements for attachments became more frequent. Those requirements ranged from a skill level (Cannon 4), to the alliance to a faction (e.g. Crimson Rogers), to the existence of a trait (Villainous), or a trait at a specific level (e.g. Porte 2).
Due to the speed of attachments, they usually had a much lower reward/cost ratio than adventures.

Attachment cards&#x27; boarding attack was a Club.

====Adventures====
This is the second type of card a crew could attach. Adventures are the usual stuff of Hollywood pirate or naval adventure films: ancient relics, captured damsels, sea monsters, etc.
These cards were almost exclusively completed by the use of the adventuring skill and were defined by the following:
** Seas away: Adventures did not automatically attach to a crew, but rather to a sea. When played, an adventure was placed a number of seas away from your ship (usually 1 to 3). To complete an adventure, your ship had to be on the same sea as the Adventure. This served as a balance factor for the more powerful or cheap adventures by forcing you to sail to the target sea to get it (something not always easy when opponents were waiting in the middle)
** Native sea: Most adventures had one specific sea in which it was much easier to complete them. This could range from a single point of adventuring lower for low-end adventures, to several points lower for the more costly ones. Then other adventures were easier to attach to specific crew, such a &quot;Villainous&quot;, &quot;Skeletal&quot; or &quot;Rose and Cross&quot; crew member.
** Reward: Adventure rewards usually increased a skill by a number of points with a high reward/cost ratio. However, in later expansions, Adventures started giving various effects, such as traits or special abilities.

Although Adventures were attached to a Sea, they were only available to the player that attached them (barring other card effects). This was a nice way to &quot;archive&quot; uncompleted adventures without cluttering your hand. However, some cards punished rampant adventure archiving.

Adventure Cards&#x27; boarding attack was a Thrust.

====Chanteys====
Chanteys were introduced later in the life of the game. They signified various global changes in the world of Théah in the form of popular songs used by the populace.
Chanteys were similar to actions. However their effects, contrary to action cards, were permanent. They could either affect only the player or an opponent, or it could affect all players.
Chanteys worked in a way similar to terrains in &quot;Legend of the Five Rings&quot; or Omens in &quot;Legend of the Burning Sands&quot;. That is, only one Chantey could be in effect at any one time. At any time that a Chantey came into play, the former Chantey was discarded. More powerful Chanteys had, instead of a cancel cost, a discard cost that any player could use to get rid of the Chantey.

====Ships====
These cards are special in that they are not in the deck but rather start in play, along with your captain.
Most ships belonged to a specific faction and could only be used by matching captains.
Each ship was defined by its faction, &quot;crew maximum,&quot; and &quot;sailing cost&quot;.

Crew maximum was used to determine the maximum number of crew you could have on your ship. Ships with a large crew maximum tended to be more powerful in the late game, but more vulnerable at the start.

Sailing cost shows how easy a ship is to maneuver. Some action cards did not use a fixed cost, but relied instead upon a ship&#x27;s sailing cost (sometimes modified up or down). The advantage of a small ship was the fact that it could fill fast and press the offensive quickly.

====Seas====
The five Seas were always the same. They came with each starter box and were placed in a specific order. Seas had no specific abilities other than forming a game space for ships to move and for being the target of cards. Each captain has a specific &quot;starting sea&quot; which was usually chosen as a result of the storylines. New players often wondered where the other two seas which are not represented with cards were. The answer lies in the setting of the world of Théah. The 6th sea is protected by a wall of flame and thus difficult to access, and the 7th sea is a mythical place and very hard to find. Neither of these two &#x27;extra&#x27; seas played any major role in the card game.

===Deck construction===
Players make many choices when designing a deck. They must keep in mind both the captain&#x27;s and ship&#x27;s abilities, the faction&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, and the strategy they want to use. Even with the same Captain and Ship, it is possible to make completely different deck types.

*Restrictions
** A player must first choose a captain. The captain determines the faction.
** A player must choose a ship of the same faction as the captain, or an unaligned ship.
** The deck may not be less than 60 cards including captain and ship.
** A deck may not have more than 3 copies of a single card.

==Strategies==
There are many different concepts for a deck and many different ways to achieve them, depending mainly on the faction and secondarily on the ship.

For example, the Castilians were mainly a boarding faction (which means they liked to attack in mêlée) but with the right construction it was possible to attack without boarding (by making ramming attacks and limited cannon). The original Castillian ship was a hulking galley but in later expansions they got a small fast ship that allowed them to perform a tactic which some called &#x27;speed boarding&#x27;.

Some sample deck foci are:
* &#x27;Atomic Cannon&#x27;: These decks focused on sinking the opponent&#x27;s ship with one big cannon attack. They usually had many adventures and actions to evade boardings.
* &#x27;Plinging&#x27;: These decks focused on producing many small attacks, slowly forcing the opponent to tack all their cards, rendering them unable to take action against you. This was mainly achieved with cannon, but there were variations with spells.
* Boarding: These decks focused on catching the opponent and entering boarding. They usually used big ships with lots of crew and had a nice spread of cards.
* &#x27;Speed Boarding&#x27;: These decks focused on catching the opponent in a boarding during the first or early second turn. If they couldn&#x27;t, they usually lost. The ships these decks used were small and had small sailing requirements.
* &#x27;Control&#x27;: These rare decks tried to complete the secondary control victory condition. They were the harder decks to construct competitively.

Even within these broad categories, there were many ways to carry out any given strategy. For example, a boarding deck might use only the captain to deal damage while the rest of the crew absorbed hits, or it might use small attacks with pistols and weak characters or it could just have a nice spread. One could use boarding action cards to enhance the attacks or to just absorb damage. One could also use attachments to win the attacks more easily, or adventures to inflict more damage etc.

Combining various strategies was not uncommon, such as a boarding deck that used a big cannon attack before the boarding to soften the enemy.

==Game play==
===Start===
At the start of each game, players used their captain&#x27;s starting Wealth statistic to recruit their starting crew. Since the starting crew could be anyone from the deck, it was a nice tactic to have some backup crew in the deck for specific situations (much like a sideboard, only built-in). A captain&#x27;s starting Wealth usually ranged from 7 to 10. Players typically chose a crew with high Influence statistics to start a game, although speed decks often preferred Sailing, Swashbuckling, and Cannon.

===Phases===
Each turn has 3 phases. The first phase is used to determine which player goes first; the second phase, the most important one, is where the game is actually played and the final phase is the end of turn were all resources are replenished (by untacking and drawing cards). Unlike in many games where a player performs as many actions as he wishes before passing to the next player, in &quot;7th Sea&quot; each player performs only one action, and players pass to one another until none choose to take further actions.

In the main phase, starting with the first player, each player performs an action or passes and then play proceeded clockwise to the next player. Actions can be playing an Action card from one&#x27;s hand, using a printed ability on a card in play, or performing an action innate to the game like hiring crew, or performing a cannon attack.

Once all players pass consecutively, the turn ends.

The innate actions all players can perform in &quot;7th Sea&quot; are:
*Moving: By &quot;tacking&quot; Crew to produce Sailing points to equal or exceed the ship&#x27;s sailing cost, a player can move his ship to an adjacent sea.
*Cannon Attack: By producing any number of cannon with a single Crew, a player can inflict that number of hits on a ship in the same sea.
*Hire Crew: If the ship has not reached its crew maximum, a player can reveal a crew from his hand and then produce equal or more influence than that crew&#x27;s cost to recruit it.
*Begin a boarding: By producing sailing equal to the ship&#x27;s sailing cost, a player can attempt to begin a boarding against a ship in the same sea.
*Complete an adventure: While in the same sea as one of his own adventures, a player can play all costs and attach the adventure to an appropriate target.

===Boardings===
&quot;Boarding&quot; is considered the most interesting phase of the game. Once begun, the involved ships lock together with their crews engaged in &quot;cinematic mêlée battle&quot;. While a player can escape a ship&#x27;s cannons by running away, the only ways to disengage from boarding are with both players&#x27; consent or with a card effect. Accordingly, boarding decks are rewarded for the difficulty of engagement.

Boarding occurs within the main phase of the game. During boarding, the rest of the game stops, so players can no longer play acts. Boarding consists of alternating &quot;boarding attacks&quot; between the two players involved. In turn, each boarding attack includes choosing a crew and sending it forward to attack (i.e. jumping to the other ship and causing some trouble). The defender can choose either to stand and take the hits (equal to the other crew&#x27;s damage plus swordsman level) or to send someone forward to defend.

Each card in the deck has three boarding boxes. The large &quot;attack box&quot; is first, with two smaller &quot;defend boxes&quot; below it. Each boarding box has one of the following actions: [C] &quot;(Club)&quot;, [P] &quot;(Punch)&quot;, [D] &quot;(Dagger)&quot;, [S] &quot;(Slash)&quot;, or [T] &quot;(Thrust)&quot;. The attacker starts by playing a card from his hand to initiate his attack. If possible, the defender resists by playing a matching defence card from his hand (i.e. the defender&#x27;s card must have a &quot;defend box&quot; matching the attacker&#x27;s &quot;attack box&quot;). The defender immediately counter-attacks with the action in the &quot;attack box&quot; of that defending card. The original attacker then defends himself against the counter-attack. In effect, the exchange is reminiscent of a continuous cinematic &quot;Thrust-Slash-Parry-Riposte&quot; mêlée. The mêlée ends when either player cannot defend against an attack (i.e. the player&#x27;s hand is empty, he chose the order of his attacks wrongly, or he has a bad boarding hand). The last attacking player wins the boarding attack, and the loser suffers &quot;hits&quot;.

Boardings are interesting both because defenders can inflict hits and because the crews locked in mêlée suffer hits first. Such early hits risk loss of either crews&#x27; captain (and thus the game) while the crew may still be in otherwise prime condition. Because of this, a player may choose to avoid starting a boarding attack by passing or by playing a &quot;react&quot; (e.g. firing a musket or getting drunk). When both players perform a boarding attack, they draw 3 cards each and the attacks continue.

Since boarding boxes are spread in different card types, boarding decks usually have a wide variety of card types, unlike cannon and victory decks with few (two or three) card types. Thus, dedicated cannon decks can be caught helplessly in a boarding.

===Death and destruction===
Ships are fragile things. When a ship suffers hits, the crew is responsible for fixing it by tacking or sinking (getting killed). Hits cannot be ignored. When a captain sinks to absorb hits you lose the game. Players sometimes employed action cards to help them absorb hits.

===Victory===
In &quot;7th Sea&quot;, there were two roads to victory. You could either sink all enemy ships, or perform a control victory (play several expensive cards, one in each sea).

==Storyline==
The game was a heavily story influenced game. Its factions had ties to specific RPG elements and rivalries and alliances occurred between them as the story progressed. The first story arc saw many serious conflicts, not necessarily all tied together. Storyline deaths were not uncommon (they did not have some specific effect in the game), and the game even saw the death of an entire faction.

===Factions===
*Crimson Rogers: Bloodthirsty pirates led by the cruel and ruthless Captain Reis, the Crimson Rogers flew red sails and were feared more than any other faction, save perhaps the Black Freighter. Their motto was No Banter, No Barter, No Quarter. &quot;The Crimson Rogers have excellent cannon, adequate boarding and adventuring capabilities, but low influence. They are mostly Villainous&quot;.
*Sea Dogs: More privateers than pirates, the Sea Dogs were sponsored by Avalon (a nation inspired by mythic England). They angered the Crimson Rogers, leading to the destruction of their ship and the near-death of their first captain Berek, the luckiest man alive. Bloody Bonnie McGee took the helm and sacrificed her life for a chance to take down Reis. &quot;The Sea Dogs have high influence and jack of all trades crew, without any particular specialisation. They dabble in Glamour sorcery and are primarily Heroic, being the only faction in the game with no villainous crew.&quot;
*Castillians: Sailors from the nation of Castille (based on renaissance Spain), this faction was originally the enemy of the Montaigne, with whose nation they were at war. They later allied with the Montaigne faction to save their captain, Orduno. They were also allied with the Inquisition (the punitive, warlike arm of the church). &quot;Castillians are mainly a boarding faction with some cannon capabilities.&quot;
*Montaigne: Montaigne (based on renaissance France) is the wealthiest nation and as a result they excel at many things. They usually employ Musketeers for sword fights and their fighting style employs the most tricks. Their original captain, the General, was a mercenary soldier from Eisen who was promoted as a pirate hunter. Their secondary captain was mainly preoccupied with bringing Montaigne&#x27;s rivals, the Castillians, back in line. &quot;Montaigne have many good swordsmen and fighting tricks while also being very fast on the offensive due to their high influence.&quot;
*The Brotherhood: The Brotherhood are escaped convicts from a Castillian prison who formed their own pirate nation. Their original captain, Allende, was recaptured, but later freed by Berek, who became the Brotherhood&#x27;s new captain following his escape from Reis. &quot;The Brotherhood has high adventuring, giving them flexibility, but also making them weak to start, needing time to complete adventures. Later ships and captains with powerful abilities grant them greater playability.&quot;
*The Explorers: The explorers were neither pirates nor allied with any nation. Their captain, Guy McCormic was obsessed with finding ancient Syrneth artifacts (the remnants of a lost high-tech civilization). At some point, after he sacrificed a crewmember to his passion, the rest of the crew mutinied and overcame him. &quot;Explorers have very high adventuring and sailing and are very good at escaping trouble.&quot;
*The Corsairs: The only faction hailing from the Crescent Empire (inspired by the Ottoman Empire), the Corsairs are led by Kheired Din, a ruthless slavemaster who sacrificed his own crew to get results. The corsairs were hit hard story wise when their slaves rebelled and their leader, Espero, turned out to be a descendant of the lost Castillian royal bloodline. The second corsair ship was led by Ernesto Castillus (AKA Espero) whose actions were critical to the end of the storyline. &quot;Corsairs are very good at boarding, and have a very high damage absorption&quot;.
*The Gosse&#x27;s Gentlemen: A former legend once again picks up the sword and sails the seven seas along with his band of heroic gentlemen-pirates. Gosse had sworn to bring down the Black Freighter captained by the man who killed his wife. He achieved this aim, with the help of Ernesto Castillus, the sacrifice of his ship, and his own life. &quot;The Gosse had very high swashbuckling, and as a result they were very good at boardings, and to some extent, damage absorption&quot;.
*The Vesten: The Vestenmannavnjar or Vesten (based on Vikings of the late Dark Ages) are raiders and warriors of an old tradition. Bitter over the betrayal by their greedy kinsmen, they hunt and loot any Vendel Trading ship they caught. Eventually betrayed from within, their captain Yngvild survived and hunted for revenge. The next captain was led by their betrayer and rival, Jorund. &quot;In keeping with their Viking inspiration, the Vesten specialise in boarding. Their cannon abilities are non-existent, but they make up for this with large amounts of damage-absorption&quot;.
*The Black Freighter: The undead of &quot;7th Sea&quot; sail on a massive ghost ship, the Black Freighter that gives them their name. Their original Captain, Necros was brought back to avenge his death at the hands of Gosse. The original crew consisted of undead versions of normal crew (the faction can&#x27;t recruit non Black Freighter crew) and resurrected crew from the other factions. The first story arc ended with the death of Necros and his ship. &quot;The Black Freighter was an interesting faction since it relied on skeletal crew and fear cards. They could go for either boarding or cannon and usually mixed both&quot;.

There were also a number of &quot;unaligned&quot; crew who belonged to no faction and so were usable by any Captain. Usually these were generic pirates, but some were given quite a bit of character and even included a handful of captains.

===Story arc===
The first story arc began with minor events and conflicts between the various factions and gradually progressed with events of greater importance which ended up changing the state of the world. Notable events include the rivalry between the Sea Dogs and the Crimson Rogers, which climaxed with the apparent death of Captain Reis at the hands of the Sea Dogs second captain; Bloody Bonnie McGee. There was also the appearance of the Black Freighter and its later defeat at the hands of Phillip Gosse by the sacrifice of his whole faction. And finally the Corsair&#x27;s search for the final Syrneth switch which revealed the hidden island, Cabora, and their destiny.

The second story arc did not have enough time to be fully fleshed out but it started with the Montaigne Revolution and the capture of their former emperor.

===Experience===
As with most other AEG games, experience was a major factor in the game&#x27;s progression. Experienced crew usually got stronger and costlier. Since &quot;7th Sea&quot; had a lax uniqueness rule, usually experienced crew ended up becoming unique. Experienced crew sometimes ended up changing factions (&quot;Such as the experienced versions of killed crew becoming Black Freighter members&quot;) or gained some secret society allegiance.

*Experienced crew could simply be hired without requiring their original version to already be in play, unlike evolved Pokémon for example.

==History of &quot;7th Sea&quot;==
During the lifetime of &quot;7th Sea&quot;, both the RPG and the CCG had a very loyal following. Players would often ask for a specific result in a storyline tournament while offering bounty to anyone who achieved it.
The game may be cancelled, but a following of the game still exists with tournaments in major events and custom cards.

===Expansions===
The first base set of &quot;7th Sea&quot; offered 6 factions for player to choose from, but later expansions revealed more factions. The game saw two more base sets and a final online-only set at its closing.

*&quot;No Quarter&quot; (Original base set, featuring factions: Crimson Rogers, Explorers, Sea Dogs, Brotherhood, Montaigne, Castillian. 1999, 323 cards. Set icon: white cannon in profile on a black background. Winner of the 1999 Origins Awards for &quot;Best Trading Card Game&quot; and &quot;Best Graphic Presentation of a Card Game or Supplement&quot;.)
*&quot;Strange Vistas&quot; (First expansion, featuring factions: the Corsairs, Gosse&#x27;s Gentlemen. 1999, 161 cards. Set icon: white sail on a pale blue background. Winner of the 1999 Origins Award for &quot;Best Card Game Expansion or Supplement&quot;.)
*&quot;Broadsides&quot; (Identical reprint of &quot;No Quarter&quot;, except for six faction-specific cards. 1999, 323 cards. Set icon: white crossbones on green background.)
*&quot;Shifting Tides&quot; (Second expansion, featuring factions: Vesten, Montaigne. 1999, 161 cards. Set icon: white crown on pale red background.)
*&quot;Scarlet Seas&quot; (Third expansion, featuring factions: Crimson Rogers, Sea Dogs. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white crossed cutlasses on purple background.)
*&quot;Black Sails&quot; (Fourth expansion, featuring faction: Black Freighter. 2000, 54 cards. Set icon: black sail on white background. Instead of randomized boosters, this expansion was sold in 50-card fixed distribution boosters.)
*&quot;Fate&#x27;s Debt&quot; (Fifth expansion, featuring factions: the Brotherhood, Corsairs. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white cannon in profile on a blue background.)
*&quot;Reaper&#x27;s Fee&quot; (Sixth expansion, featuring factions: Castillians, Vesten. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white crossbones on black background. Probably the hardest set to currently locate.)
*&quot;Horizon&#x27;s Edge&quot; (Seventh expansion, featuring factions: the Explorers, the Gosse&#x27;s Gentlemen. 115 cards. Set icon: white crossed cutlasses on red background.)
*&quot;Iron Shadow&quot; (623 cards. The second revision of the base set was arguably the biggest release of the game since it contained all the ships and captains while also having new versions of older cards to make them more playable and a new card layout. From this set forward, the use of set icons was discontinued in favor of printing the set&#x27;s name at the bottom edge of each of its cards.)
*&quot;Syrneth Secret&quot; (Eighth expansion, featuring factions: the Brotherhood, Montaigne. 2001, 169 cards.)
*&quot;Parting Shot&quot; (54 cards. The final set of &quot;7th Sea&quot; was released only in an online form and mainly to close the storyline and balance the factions. A Final gift from AEG to its loyal customers.)

===Ghost Ship: The Death of a Game===
Although &quot;7th Sea&quot; seemed to be going well sales-wise, there were some things that began to spell the end of the game. They were either easily avoidable or common blunders that have been known to end the life of many collectible card games.
*The third release of the base set saw the reprint of many older cards with new abilities to increase their playability. While many players saw this as a good move (because it effectively increased their card base), some had a hard time keeping track of the changes, while others did not want to waste money on new versions of cards they already owned.
*A series of storyline tournaments in which the players themselves would mark a faction for death, The Gosse Faction was selected. Many players incorrectly believed this meant that no more Gosse crew and Gosse-specific cards would appear in the game.
*Late in its lifespan, &quot;7th Sea&quot; also opted for &quot;facelift&quot;, meaning cards were reprinted, keeping 99% of the format, but with whole art design and background across. Conceptually this was a good move, but in practice it seemed to tire players to adjusting to the new art, getting new copies of older cards to match new cards, etc.
*A minor complaint arose in the last set being printed in the wrong size.
*&quot;7th Sea&quot;&#x27;s demise came with the success of AEG&#x27;s new &quot; CCG&quot;. AEG lacked the resources to support &quot;L5R&quot;, &quot;Warlord&quot; and &quot;7th Sea&quot;, and as &quot;7th Sea&quot; was the least successful of the three, it was retired to free up resources.

===Present===
The popularity of &quot;7th Sea&quot; – like that of related games such as &quot;Doomtown&quot; or &quot;Rage&quot; – has waned. However, many players continue to play in tournaments and even design new cards and sets.

Because the RPG is maintained, there is still interest in the setting and a number of websites continue to support the CCG as well as the RPG.

The game has also been ported to OCTGN and Untap.in for online play.

In 2022, Pine Box Entertainment revived the game as an Expandable Card Game, in the same vein as games such as Doomtown CCG. 7th Sea: City of Five Sails, was successfully funded on Kickstarter in November, 2022. An inaugural tournament was held over two days at Gen Con in 2022 using pre-release starter decks. Sixty fine players attended the event and the finalists were Stephen Skilton and Hayes Hunter. A retro tournament was also held using the original edition of the game.

<text>gPhoto is a set of software applications and libraries for use in digital photography. gPhoto supports not just retrieving of images from camera devices, but also upload and remote controlled configuration and capture, depending on whether the camera supports those features.

Released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, gPhoto is free software.

==Support==
gPhoto supports more than 2500 cameras as of June 2019. It is cross-platform, running under Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and other Unix-like operating systems.

gPhoto has support for the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and will also connect to devices that use the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP). Many cameras are not supported by gPhoto, but have support for the USB mass storage device class, which is well-supported under Linux. gPhoto intentionally does not implement support for USB mass storage cameras, as this is already implemented in-kernel.

gPhoto supports camera tethering control, preview, viewfinder in PTP or camera specific protocols on numerous cameras.

==Applications==
gPhoto provides a library, libgphoto2, to allow for other frontends to be written for it, and a command-line interface. gtkam is the official GUI client for gPhoto. Other clients are the KDE program digiKam and the GNOME program Shotwell. GVfs uses libgphoto2 to expose on-camera photos to GNOME applications via a virtual filesystem.

DigiKam, gtkam and support tethering capture and viewfinder for supported cameras.

<doc id="1252644" wikidata="Q1781942" url="?curid=1252644" title="Swaledale">
<text>Swaledale is a valley in North Yorkshire, England. It is one of the Yorkshire Dales, which are part of the Pennines, and within the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It is named after the River Swale, which runs through it. Swaledale is the most northerly of the major dales.

==Geographical overview==

Swaledale runs broadly from west to east, from the high moors on the Cumbria–Yorkshire boundary at the watershed of Northern England to the market town of Richmond, where the dale meets the lowlands. Nine Standards Rigg, the prominent ridge with nine ancient tall cairns, rises on the watershed at the head of Swaledale. To the south and east of the ridge a number of smaller dales (Birkdale, Little Sleddale, Great Sleddale and Whitsundale) join to form the narrow valley of upper Swaledale at the small village of Keld. From there, the valley runs briefly south then turns east at Thwaite to broaden progressively as it passes Muker, Gunnerside, Low Row, Healaugh and Reeth.

The Pennine valley ends at Richmond, where an important medieval castle still watches the important ford from the top of a cliff. Below Richmond, the valley sides flatten out and the Swale flows across lowland farmland to meet the Ure just east of Boroughbridge at a point known as Swale Nab. The Ure becomes the Ouse, and eventually (on merging with the Trent) the Humber.

From the north, Arkengarthdale and its river the Arkle Beck join Swaledale at Reeth. To the south, Wensleydale, home of the famous Wensleydale cheese, runs parallel with Swaledale. The two dales are separated by a ridge including Great Shunner Fell, and joined by the road over Buttertubs Pass.

==Physical character==
Swaledale is a typical limestone Yorkshire dale, with its narrow valley-bottom road, green meadows and fellside fields, white sheep and dry stone walls on the glacier-formed valley sides, and darker moorland skyline. The upper parts of the dale are particularly striking because of its large old limestone field barns and its profusion of wild flowers. The latter are thanks to the return to the practice of leaving the cutting of grass for hay or silage until wild plants have had a chance to seed. Occasionally visible from the valley bottom road are the slowly fading fellside scars of the 18th and 19th century lead mining industry. Ruined stone mine buildings remain, taking on the same colours as the landscape into which they are crumbling. In 1989, Swaledale (and Arkengarthdale) were designated as a Barns and Walls Conservation Area, making it the largest conservation area in the United Kingdom.

Swaledale is home to many small but beautiful waterfalls, such as Richmond Falls, Kisdon Force and Catrake Force.

==Agriculture and industry==

Sheep-farming has always been central to economic life in Swaledale, which has lent its name to a breed of round-horned sheep. Traditional Swaledale products are woollens and Swaledale cheese, which was formerly made from ewe’s milk. These days it is made from cow’s milk. Starting in the 1700s, and continuing into the 20th century, a major industry in the area was lead mining carried out in Arkengarthdale and at Grinton Moor. Today, Grinton Smelt Mill, a Scheduled Monument, is considered to be the best preserved of its type in the Dales.

==Current human activities==

Today, tourism has become important, and Swaledale attracts thousands of visitors a year. It is very popular with walkers, particularly because the Coast to Coast Walk passes along it. Unlike Wensleydale it has no large settlements on the scale of Hawes or Leyburn, nor an obvious tourist hook such as the former&#x27;s connection with James Herriot, and so, like Coverdale, it enjoys a quieter tone, especially as it is more remote compared to, say, Wharfedale, which is much further south and easily accessible from the West Yorkshire metropolis. The market town of Richmond is promoted as offering &quot;an abundance of places to explore&quot; including Richmond Castle and history museums and in 2021, a North Yorkshire publication particularly recommended the small villages of Gunnerside, Muker and Keld to visitors. 

In May and June every year, Swaledale hosts the two-week-long Swaledale Festival, which combines a celebration of small-scale music and a programme of guided walks.

The first weekend in August sees the area host the &#x27;Ard Rock mountain bike festival, which is based in Reeth but uses bridleways and private land in both Swaledale and Arkengarthdale.

Since 1950, Swaledale has been the host of the Scott Trial, a British motorcycle trials competition run over an off-road course of approximately , raising money for the &quot;Scott charities&quot;, a range of local non-profit making organisations. The events were still running as of 2023.

Ravenseat, the farm of Amanda Owen (&quot;The Yorkshire Shepherdess&quot;), is in Swaledale.

==Swaledale in literature==
In a letter to Geoffrey Grigson of 17 January 1950, the poet W. H. Auden wrote, &quot;My great good place is the part of the Pennines bounded on the S by Swaledale, on the N by the Roman wall and on the W by the Eden Valley&quot;.

<doc id="1252653" wikidata="Q5305226" url="?curid=1252653" title="Dragon Knight (novel series)">
<text>The Dragon Knight is a series of fantasy novels begun in 1976 by American writer Gordon R. Dickson. The first book, based on the short story &quot;St. Dragon and the George&quot;, was loosely adapted in the 1982 animated movie &quot;The Flight of Dragons&quot; by Rankin/Bass. The title here refers in part to an in-universe nomenclature, wherein the story&#x27;s dragons use the name &quot;george&quot; as a synonym or substitute of &quot;human&quot;, after &#x27;St. George the Dragon-Slayer&#x27;, and in part a reference to the latter.

==Characters ==
===Jim Eckert===
Baron Sir James Eckert de Bois de Malencontri et Riveroak, a.k.a. &quot;the Dragon Knight&quot; or sometimes &quot;Sir Dragon&quot;.

The protagonist of the series, a minor academic originating in the 20th century, who to save his fiancée, Angela &quot;Angie&quot; Farell, follows her by astral projection to a parallel universe resembling medieval England, where his psyche is lodged in the body of a dragon named Gorbash. On consultation with the mystic Carolinus (see below), he is sent to rescue Angie from the immaterial evil known as the &#x27;Dark Powers&#x27;, and is mistitled a Baron by Carolinus (presumably to give him legal freedom of movement). At the end of &quot;The Dragon and the George&quot;, Jim regains his human form and obtains the land and titles of the deposed antagonist Sir Hugh, who re-appears later in the series.

In &quot;The Dragon Knight&quot;, Jim rules the estate Malencontri, with Angie as his wife; but finds himself capable of becoming a dragon, without the intervention of Gorbash, and becomes Carolinus&#x27; apprentice to control this ability. Having learnt this control enables several extraordinary deeds in the service of England, and later makes Jim eligible to join the &#x27;Collegiate of Magickians&#x27; whereof Carolinus is a founder (a subplot emphasised in later books).

===Sir Brian Neville-Smythe===
Jim and Angie&#x27;s closest friend; an idealistic, impoverished, zealous knight, present as Jim&#x27;s companion throughout the series. His understanding of the medieval world proves a great asset to Jim, who is occasionally perplexed by its customs.

===Silvanus Carolinus===
Jim&#x27;s mentor, and one of the three highest-rated (AAA+) magicians in the world. In some ways the modern stereotype or archetype of a Wizard: an omniscient, irascible, talkative old man capable of altering reality almost at will, consulted by every species of life-form, and often in conversation with intangible &#x27;Powers&#x27;. Identified in later books as a founder of the Collegiate of Magickians to which he belongs. Noted for addressing every character, including royalty, by personal names or nicknames, without reference to title, and for extensive knowledge of anachronisms.

===Dafydd Ap Hywel===
A Welsh longbowman, likely the greatest in the world, and Jim&#x27;s ally. Descended in part from a long-extinct line of royalty, associated with the &#x27;Drowned Hundred&#x27; of folklore. Married after the first book to the female archer known as Danielle.

===Aragh (changed to &quot;Aargh&quot; in later books) ===
A wolf capable of speech and noted for an unrepentantly-abrasive character, distinguished by a strong nationalism, possessiveness of territory, and an unceasing pragmatism. Of exceptional size, by descent from the Dire Wolves. Able to move without being seen or heard, even when watched. Ally to all the main characters, including Jim.

===Secondary characters===
====Lady Angela &#x27;Angie&#x27; Eckert====
Betrothed and later married to Jim, Angie appears as a damsel in distress in the first book, and later as chatelaine of Malencontri. Her role has varying degrees of importance, in that being a lady, she is required to remain at her own estate while Jim is away; to oversee all that occurs in it; and to maintain custom and courtesy in all situations. When the action is set in Malencontri, she is Jim&#x27;s inseparable companion. Most of the books end with their re-union after an arduous adventure. As a rule, Angie takes negative stimuli with more poise than Jim, who is continually frustrated by the situations he encounters.

====Gorbash====
A Western dragon of the &#x27;Cliffside&#x27; dragon colony, whose body was initially inhabited by Jim Eckert until Jim could bring his &#x27;george&#x27; form into the medieval world. Not a companion as much as an alternate form assumed by Jim. Later a friend to the latter among the Cliffside dragons.

====Smrgol====
The &quot;maternal grand-uncle&quot; of the dragon Gorbash, and thus in some degree Jim&#x27;s grand-uncle as well. Advisor to Jim/Gorbash throughout the first book (in which the two share a body). Depicted as comically pompous, but possessed of great courage and able to overawe the other dragons of his colony in any debate. Killed in the first book fighting a &#x27;renegade&#x27; named Bryagh, who had earlier given Lady Angela to the Dark Powers.

====Secoh====
A wetland-dwelling &quot;mere-dragon&quot;: one of a subspecies reduced in size and strength by the presence of the Dark Powers. Fought alongside Smrgol to kill the dragon Bryagh. Though initially cowardly and weak, Secoh increases in confidence, and is one of Jim&#x27;s vital allies among the dragon community.

====Giles o&#x27; the Wold====
An itinerant archer, and leader of a band of similar men. Responsible for skirmishing against the forces of Sir Hugh outside the immediate vicinity of the Loathly Tower, the headquarters of the Dark Powers.

====Danielle o&#x27; the Wold====
Archer, daughter to Giles o&#x27; the Wold, and close friend to Aragh. Married to Dafydd after the first book. Thereafter she is mentioned by name, but usually in connection with her husband and their children, who are said to be numerous.

====KinetetE====
A female Magickian, described as &quot;cadaverous-looking&quot; and therefore depicted as severe of manner, and close colleague of Carolinus, KinetetE appears as Jim&#x27;s magical advisor whenever Carolinus is unavailable. She is equal in rank to the latter, and appears initially as his judge in a magical contest. Addressed familiarly by Carolinus and Angie as &quot;Kin&quot;.
====Lady Geronde Isabel de Chaney====
Chatelaine of Castle Malvern, betrothed to Sir Brian while they both wait for her father (Sir Orrin) to return home for permission to marry. Depicted as martial in character. Married to Sir Brian in &quot;The Dragon and the Fair Maid of Kent&quot;.

====Sir John Chandos====
A powerful and intelligent knight, who often enlists Jim to conduct difficult and unusual missions. Considered very handsome by his contemporaries, and therefore sometimes the object of Jim&#x27;s jealousy when seen as too familiar with Angie.

====Prince Edward Plantagenet====
The hot-tempered, but good-natured son of the King, later identified as the historical &#x27;Black Prince&#x27;. Edward owes Jim and Brian his freedom from captivity by the renegade Magickian Malvinne, and is known to speak on their behalf before the King.

====King Edward III Plantagenet====
The weak-willed, alcoholic monarch of England. Although he is Jim&#x27;s superior and generally can be considered an ally, the King is impulsive and indecisive; character traits which occasionally put James and Angela&#x27;s lives in danger.

====May Heather====
A young, but brave and loyal kitchen maid at Malencontri. Sometimes a source of worry to Sir James and Lady Angela, but otherwise considered an asset.

====Rrrnlf====
A humaniform, amphibious Giant, identified in a dialogue as a &quot;Sea Devil&quot;. Described as essentially cone-shaped, in that he is largest in diameter at the head, and narrowest at the feet, with each area of the body narrower than the one above it. An ally to Sir James and Lady Angela, and able to travel from any body of water to any other regardless of physical removal. Usually depicted as amiable, cheerful, and slightly simple-minded, as well as affectionate and respectful of all whom he encounters.

====Hob====
The castle hobgoblin at Malencontri, and therefore sometimes identified as &#x27;Malencontri hob&#x27;. His role is essentially that of a brownie in relation to the larger castle; but he is also Jim&#x27;s messenger among the other mythical creatures, and sometimes a source of information. Implied to be immortal; originally a true goblin banished from the &#x27;Kingdom of Demons&#x27; for his refusal to take part in wars, some centuries prior to the story.

====Robert Falon====
Jim and Angie&#x27;s infant ward, introduced in &quot;The Dragon, the Earl, and the Troll&quot;, and said in later books to supply, in Angie&#x27;s mind, the need of a son.

====Sir Giles de Mer====
A Selkie, companion to Jim and Brian.

===Villains===
====The Dark Powers====
A malicious force, chief antagonist of the series, having an especial grudge against humans and magicians, that unceasingly attempts to set the world into either boredom or chaos. Their power is centered at Loathly Tower and all immediate terrain, within England.

====Sir Hugh de Bois====
The former lord of Malencontri, much disliked by Aragh and Sir Brian. Betrayed England to enlist in the services of the Dark Powers, and later fled England, to re-appear in later books. Deposed by Jim/Gorbash and their allies. Notable for having scarred Lady Geronde, so that she remains &#x27;disfigured&#x27; according to the standards of her society until her marriage to Sir Brian, whereat she is restored to her former appearance by an act of magic considered unusual by the other characters.

====The Earl of Cumberland====
The King&#x27;s royal cousin. Power-hungry and ruthless, the Earl frequently attempts various plots to take the throne, even as far as attacking the mythical land of Lyonesse. The Earl regards the Dragon Knight and his companions as a constant annoyance to his schemes, which they consistently dismantle.

====Lady Agatha Falon====
The Earl&#x27;s witch ally. Robert Falon&#x27;s malevolent aunt. Shown as a relatively benign character in &quot;The Dragon, the Earl, and the Troll&quot;, wherein she is introduced; but depicted as malicious in later books.

====Bryagh====
Renegade dragon who left the Cliffside dragon community (whereof Smrgol and Gorbash were members) to serve the Dark Powers. Killed by Smrgol and Secoh.

====Malvinne====
A rogue magickian in league with the Dark Powers. A long-time rival of Carolinus. Defeated by Jim and company.

====Sandmirks====
Matriarchal, rodentine creatures that impel terror in their intended victims by production of high-frequency sound. These sounds have no effect on wolves, but take full effect on dragons and men alike.

====Harpies====
Flying creatures resembling those of classic mythology, whose bites contain lethal venom.

====Worm====
A large, mainly-featureless creature with thick skin and many rows of teeth. Defeated by Jim and Brian.

====Ogre====
A large, dim-witted, fireproof humanoid noted for impressive gripping power but limited movement at the shoulder. Smrgol and Jim/Gorbash are among a very few dragons to have slain one.

====Sea-Lizard or Sea-Serpent====
An amphibious reptile of tremendous size, considered traditional enemy of the dragons. One of these, by magical intervention, leads an invasion (in &quot;The Dragon at War&quot;) of England to destroy the dragons of England, but fails when fought and beaten by Jim Eckert.

====Granfer====
A Kraken, initially depicted as benign advisor to all marine and amphibious life; but later revealed to be ambitious, according to Carolinus, &quot;to rule the world&quot;. It is Granfer that permits a large-scale invasion of England by the sea-serpents, and who connects them to the Italio-French sorcerer Julio Ecotti for this purpose. Banished by Carolinus.

====Ahriman====
A &#x27;Great Demon&#x27;, antagonist of &quot;The Dragon and the Djinn&quot;.

====Deep-Earth Goblins====
Antagonists of &quot;The Dragon and the Fair Maid of Kent&quot;, wherein they appear as a cause of the Black Death&#x27;s proliferation in England, well before the accepted historic date. Especial enemies of the Castle Hobgoblins, whom they expelled from the &#x27;Kingdom of Demons&#x27; centuries before the events of the books.

===Other characters===

====Grottwold Weimar Hansen====
University professor of various qualifications, whose experiments in astral projection transported Angie, and later the psyche and memories of Jim, into the medieval period. Considered &quot;an unsavory character&quot; by Jim, owing to their former rivalry for Angie&#x27;s hand in marriage. Jim&#x27;s instructor in hypnosis.

====Dick Innkeeper====
Owner of an inn, of moderate importance to the first book.

====Son Won Phon====
Chinese Magickian, who appears initially in &quot;The Dragon at War&quot; to challenge Jim&#x27;s use of hypnosis on grounds that the latter was &quot;Oriental magic&quot; and ought have been taught by &quot;a qualified Oriental instructor&quot;. Disproven by Carolinus. Son later appears as a specialist consulted by Carolinus, and in extension thereof by Jim.

====Martti Lahti====
Finnish magician, of a moderate rank (identified as &#x27;B+&#x27;) slightly higher than that of Jim, who appears among those observing Carolinus&#x27; challenge by Son Won Phon, and who prevents the injured Sir Brian and Dafydd ap Hywel dying from hemorrhage. Amiable, easy-mannered, and slightly condescending toward Jim.

====Mnrogar====
Self-proclaimed &quot;King of the Trolls&quot;, this is a large and ancient troll living underneath the castle of an Earl. Although solitary, he maintains dominance over all the trolls in the region, and is therefore considered their superior. Addressed by Agatha Falon as &quot;Grandfather&quot; by reason of the years she spent as his ward.

===Entities===

====Auditing Department====
Intangibly-constructed, nearly-omnipresent entity of immense influence and wry humor, called the accounting office in later books, whose purpose is largely (though not exclusively) to monitor the use of magic by Magickians of the Collegiate, and thus to determine their right to accomplish certain magical feats. Usually appears as a &quot;bass voice&quot; approximately one meter from the ground, but can appear speaking from or through the local environment itself. Invoked by Carolinus early on, it does not take revenge on him for speaking to itself familiarly, but is addressed with deference by Jim.

====History====
A force of nature that influences events to follow a certain monotonous order. Opposed and balanced by Chance.

====Chance====
A force of nature that influences events toward chaos. Opposed and balanced by History.

<text>The Yeong River () is a river in Mungyeong, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It flows into the Nakdong River, which in turn flows into the Sea of Japan (East Sea). The Yeong rises from Hwabuk-myeon in Sangju, and drains most of western Mungyeong and parts of northern Sangju. From tip to tail, it covers a total of 66.2 km² and drains an area of 913.7 km². The Yeong flows into the Nakdong at the southeastern corner of Mungyeong between Yeongsun-myeon and Sangju&#x27;s Sabeol-myeon.

During most of the 20th century, coal mines were widespread throughout the Yeong valley, and the quality of the river was heavily degraded. As the water has cleared in recent years, efforts have been made to improve the river&#x27;s potential to support tourism. The river flows past Jinnam Bridge, which is known as one of the most beautiful places in North Gyeongsang and is a popular symbol of Mungyeong. In addition, rafting trips are now often organized along the Yeong. The river has also become a noted spot for recreational fishing for species including Korean aucha perch, catfish, dark chub, and pale chub.

The Yeong may take its name from the Ying River in China, which is identified by the same Chinese character.

<text>Thomas B. Huger (died April 25, 1862) was an officer in the Confederate States Navy during the U.S. Civil War. Before the war, he had served for over 20 years in the United States Navy.

==Biography==
Huger was born in South Carolina. He joined the U.S. Navy as a midshipman in March 1835. In 1845 he married Mariamne Williams Meade, the daughter of merchant Richard W. Meade and sister of Civil War general George Meade; she died in 1857. Huger was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in February 1848 and continued in the service until his native state seceded from the United States. Resigning his commission in the U.S. Navy in January 1861, he became a First Lieutenant in the Confederate Navy the following March.

He commanded a battery on Morris Island, South Carolina in 1861 and was appointed as commanding officer of the gunboat CSS &quot;McRae&quot; later in that year. Huger&#x27;s ship operated in defense of New Orleans, Louisiana and the lower Mississippi River. 

On April 24, 1862, while battling Federal Navy ships near Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip, &quot;McRae&quot; was badly damaged and Lieutenant Huger was mortally wounded. He died the next day.

Huger was wounded while engaged in fighting the Iroquois—a ship on which he served while in the US Navy. After he was wounded, his former shipmates recognized him and raised their caps as a token of respect. After his wounding, he was brought back to Charleston, South Carolina. On his death bed, he was informed that a US Navy officer wanted to see him. Huger responded, “Let him come in; I have no enemies now.” When Huger learned the officer’s name and the fact that he was a Southerner fighting for the Union, Huger declined to see him. Union Navy officers attended his funeral.^1

<text>Munich Re Group or Munich Reinsurance Company () is a German multinational insurance company based in Munich, Germany. It is the world&#x27;s largest reinsurer. ERGO, a subsidiary of Munich Re, serves as the primary insurance arm of the Group. Munich Re&#x27;s shares are publicly listed. Munich Re is included in the DAX index at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Euro Stoxx 50, and other indices.

== History ==
In 1880 Carl von Thieme, a native of Erfurt who was the representative in Bavaria of his father&#x27;s &quot;Thuringia&quot; insurance company, founded in Munich &quot;Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft&quot; together with Wilhelm von Finck (co-owner of the Merck Finck &amp; Co. bank) and Theodor von Cramer-Klett. This was followed by the founding of Allianz Versicherungs-Gesellschaft in 1890 in Berlin. Carl von Thieme was head of Munich Re until 1921, and Wilhelm von Finck served as Chairman of the supervisory board until 1924. Munich Re became renowned after the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 as the only insurer that remained solvent after paying out all the claims, a total of 15.5 million Marks .

During the Nazi dictatorship Munich Re benefited from anti-Semitic persecution. Jewish customers had to cancel their life insurances prematurely leading to huge profits for the insurance companies. At the same time Munich Re could acquire several properties owned by Jews at prices below the market rate. Starting from 1940 the company was involved in Allianz&#x27; insurance business with the SS: Munich Re served as reinsurance company for contracts insuring the barracks and operations in the concentration and extermination camps Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Dachau, Neuengamme, Ravensbrück, Sachsenhausen and Stutthof. Supervisory board member Kurt Schmitt joined the NSDAP and SS in 1933 and took the position as Reich Economy Minister for one year. In 1938 he became Director General of Munich Re and stayed in this position until the American military authorities relieved him of all offices at the end of the war. 

In February 2010, U.S. investor Warren Buffett became Munich Re&#x27;s largest single shareholder. As of December 2015, he reduced his holdings to less than 3 percent.

In 2018, the company&#x27;s shareholders&#x27; equity amounted to €26.5 billion. The group&#x27;s premium income for the year (gross premiums written) was €49.1 billion, with its consolidated result amounting to €2,275 million.

== Structure ==

Besides its reinsurance business, the Munich Re Group also transacts primary insurance business through the ERGO Group and, since 1999, asset management through MEAG (MUNICH ERGO AssetManagement GmbH).

=== Reinsurance ===
Munich Re has clients (insurance companies) worldwide. It assures part of the risk covered by these insurance companies, as well as providing comprehensive advice on insurance business. In addition to its Munich head office, Munich Re has more than 50 Business Units around the world. Munich Re provides reinsurance cover for life, health, property, casualty, transport, aviation, space, fire and engineering business. In 2018, gross premiums written in the reinsurance segment amounted to around €31.3bn.

=== Primary insurance – ERGO Group ===
Munich Re&#x27;s primary insurance operations are mainly concentrated in the ERGO Insurance Group. ERGO writes all types of life and health insurance and most types of property and casualty insurance. Outside Germany, ERGO is present in more than 30 countries around the world, servicing around 35 million clients. Members of the ERGO Group include the insurance subsidiaries D.A.S., DKV and Europäische Reiseversicherung AG, and the IT service provider &quot;ITERGO&quot;.
With a gross premium written of about €17.8bn in 2018, ERGO is one of the largest primary insurers in Germany and Europe.

=== Asset management ===
Founded in 1999, MEAG MUNICH ERGO AssetManagement GmbH manages the assets of Munich Re, ERGO, and external clients. Their purpose is to manage and increase investments of Munich Re and ERGO and third parties. MEAG manages Munich Re&#x27;s global investments amounting to €264bn.

==Munich Re Foundation==
The &quot;Munich Re Foundation&quot; is a charitable organisation, which was founded by Munich Re; the foundation started its work on 7 April 2005.

The foundation is equipped with a capital of €50 million and works predominantly in newly industrializing and developing countries. The main topics of the foundation are:
* Environmental and climatic changes
* Microinsurance and poverty reduction
* Water as a resource and risk factor
* Disaster prevention.

The prime concern of the foundation is to develop solutions for people at risk. The knowledge of Munich Re&#x27;s experts should therefore be translated into action. Hence, the working motto of the foundation is &#x27;Munich Re Foundation – from knowledge to action&#x27;. 
The main activities of the foundation concentrate on four fields: knowledge accumulation and implementation, clarification and sensitisation, networking of experts as well as direct help and support of local projects.

The foundation works with local, national as well as international partners. The majority of projects fit within a global framework. Since adaptation to climate and environmental change is much more difficult for poorer countries, the focus of the foundation is primarily on people in the developing world.

== Munich Re Art Collection ==
The Munich Re Art Collection&#x27;s history begins with the company&#x27;s founding by Carl von Thieme, who commissioned artists such as Reinhold Max Eichler and Fritz Erler to decorate the new company headquarters built on Munich&#x27;s Königinstraße in 1912-13. The Collection was geared to modern art, which from the outset has been successively expanded over the decades with works by important artists. It includes works by Rudolf Belling, Barbara Hepworth, Rupprecht Geiger (&quot;Concave rounded&quot;, 1973), Norbert Kricke and Joseph Beuys.

Purchases for the Collection increased from the mid-1990s. The Walking Man by Jonathan Borofsky has stood outside a Munich Re building on Leopoldstraße since 1995 and has since become a symbol of Munich. Sculptures and installations from the Munich Re Art Collection by artists such as Olafur Eliasson (&quot;Light Curtain&quot; , 2002) and Roxy Paine (&quot;Discrepancy&quot; , 2011) are also found in the public spaces.

Artists like Angela Bulloch, Keith Sonnier and James Turrell have designed light installations for the extensive network of underground passages that link the company&#x27;s buildings in Schwabing, Munich.

The Collection, which now comprises more than 3,000 works, is being constantly enlarged and is displayed in the company&#x27;s Munich offices. Employees can also borrow art works from the Collection to display in their offices. In addition to internationally famous artists such as Jenny Holzer, Andy Hope 1930 and Wolfgang Tillmans, the Collection also acquires works by up-and-coming artists. The offices on Berliner Strasse, designed by the architectural practice of Sauerbruch Hutton, hold regularly changing exhibitions of contemporary art. 

== Investments ==
In Oct, 2019, Munich Re invested $250 million in NEXT Insurance Inc. in a funding round that valued the small-business insurance provider at more than $1 billion.

In October 2022, Munich RE acquired the API Business Operations platform &quot;apinity&quot; from Allianz Group. The two parties did not disclose the amount.

<text>Józef Potocki (; 1673 – 19 May 1751) was a Polish nobleman (szlachcic), magnate, Great Hetman of the Crown.

==Early life==
Potocki was born in Stanisławów in 1673. He was a son of Andrzej Potocki and Anna Rysińska.

==Career==
Józef was considered as the richest magnate in Poland at that time. He was Voivode of Kijów Voivodship (Kyiv, also Kiev) from 1702 to 1744, Regimentarz generalny of the Crown Army since 1733, Great Crown Hetman since 1735, voivod of Poznań Voivodship since 1743, castellan of Kraków since 1748 and starost of Halicz, Warsaw, Leżajsk, Kołomyja, Czerwonogród, Śniatyn and Bolemów.

In 1703 he suppressed a peasant revolt led by Semen Paliy in Ukraine. He was originally a supporter of King August II of Poland but in 1705 he changed sides and became a supporter of King Stanisław I Leszczyński.

Józef was defeated at the battles of Kalisz 1706 and Koniecpol in 1708 and since 1709 after the Battle of Poltava he lived in exile in Hungary and Turkey. In 1714 he came back to Poland and became together with Teodor Potocki, the leader of the opposition to the &quot;Familia&quot; and the royal court. As part of this opposition, he contributed to the breaking-up of 9 sejms and prevented an increase of the army.

In 1733 during the War of the Polish Succession he again supported Stanisław I Leszczyński. He became a regimentarz of the Confederation of Dzików and guided the Polish confederate army against Russian and Saxon forces in several battles. On 28 February 1735 he recognized August III as King of Poland, becoming the Grand Hetman of the Crown, but conspired against him and the royal court with Turkey, Sweden and Prussia.

In 1719 he was granted the Order of the White Eagle, the highest decoration in Poland, and in 1742 became a chevalier of the Russian Orders of St. Andrew and St. Alexander Nevsky.

==Personal life==
Potocki was twice married, first to Wiktoria Leszczyńska. Together, they were the parents of: Zofia Potocka and Stanisław Potocki. After her death, he married Ludwika Mniszek.

Potocki died in Założce on 19 May 1751.

<doc id="1252689" wikidata="Q1424685" url="?curid=1252689" title="Kalundborg Transmitter">
<text>Kalundborg Radio was a major transmission facility for long- and mediumwave at the harbour of Kalundborg in Denmark. Longwave broadcasts on 243 kHz began on 27 August 1927 and ceased on 31 December 2023.
Mediumwave broadcasts on 1062 kHz began on 1 October 1951 and ceased in June 2011.

== History ==
The transmitter site was inaugurated on 27 August 1927 and started broadcasting the first channel of Danish radio on 243 kHz longwave (LW) with 300 kW. On 1 October 1951, mediumwave (MW) broadcasts of DR P2 commenced on 1062 kHz (282 m wavelength) with 250 kW. These two transmitters had a common reserve transmitter.

On 15 February 2007 at 00:05, LW transmissions from Kalundborg were suspended after 80 years of service. They resumed in Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) mode at reduced power (200 W) on 3 October 2008 after substantial modifications to the aerial earlier that year. 
During 16-31 October 2009, the old MW and LW reserve transmitter served in place of the regular MW and LW DRM transmitters.
Until mid-June 2011, broadcasts on 1062 kHz at 250 kW continued on a restricted time schedule. After that, the MW transmitter was taken out of service.

A new 50 kW LW transmitter replaced the MW service. During 6-12 September 2012, the transmitter also broadcast BBC programmes with 10 kW of power in DRM mode outside DR&#x27;s broadcast blocks in connection with the international broadcasting exhibition IBC 2012 in Amsterdam.
Shipping Forecast bulletins produced by the Danish Meteorological Institute (&quot;Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut&quot;) ceased on 1 November 2023 ahead of full closure of the longwave service on 31 December 2023.

It was possible to receive the LW signal of the Kalundborg transmitter outdoors over a distance of 800-1,000 km on a standard transistor radio or a longwave-compatible car radio. By connecting the receiver to a stationary or a maritime wire, frame, or active antenna, reception improved up to 1,500 km of range.

Every year on 4 May, Danmarks Radio rebroadcast the &quot;message of liberation,&quot; from the Kalundborg transmitter in an hour-long memorial broadcast that began after the news at 20:00. On 4 May 1945, the Danish service of the BBC broadcast the original &quot;message of liberation,&quot; marking the end of WWII in Denmark: &quot;At this moment, it is announced that Montgomery has stated that the German troops in Holland, Northwest Germany, and Denmark have surrendered.&quot;

== LW and MW antennas ==
The LW antenna was an Alexanderson aerial with two grounded 118 m steel lattice radiating towers connected by top capacitance wires. The northern tower was fed from the transmitter through a top coil, with the top coil of the southern slave tower being fed via the capacitance wires. The MW aerial was an insulated guyed steel lattice mast with a height of 147 metres. All masts virtually stood in the sea on the narrow Gisseløre peninsula, providing excellent radiation efficiency.

<doc id="1252692" wikidata="Q451770" url="?curid=1252692" title="Douglas Hartree">
<text>Douglas Rayner Hartree (27 March 1897 – 12 February 1958) was an English mathematician and physicist most famous for the development of numerical analysis and its application to the Hartree–Fock equations of atomic physics and the construction of a differential analyser using Meccano.

==Early life and education==
Douglas Hartree was born in Cambridge, England. His father, William, was a lecturer in engineering at the University of Cambridge and his mother, Eva Rayner, was president of the National Council of Women of Great Britain and first woman to be mayor of the city of Cambridge. One of his great-grandfathers was Samuel Smiles; another was the marine engineer William Hartree, partner of John Penn. Douglas Hartree was the oldest of three sons that survived infancy. A brother and sister died in infancy when he was still a child, but his two brothers would later also die. Hartree&#x27;s 7-year-old brother John Edwin died when Hartree was 17, and Hartree&#x27;s 22-year-old brother Colin William died from meningitis in February 1920 when Hartree was 23. His maternal cousin was the geologist Dorothy Helen Rayner.

Hartree attended St Faith&#x27;s School in Cambridge, then Bedales School, returning to Cambridge for his degree studies at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, which the first World War interrupted. He (and his father and brother) joined a group working on anti-aircraft ballistics under A. V. Hill, where he gained considerable skill and an abiding interest in practical calculation and numerical methods for differential equations, executing most of his own work with pencil and paper. According to Hill, writing in Hartree&#x27;s obituary, ‘Quietly one day he improvised a long-base height-finder out of some wires, posts, and a steel tape’. This became known as the Hartree height-finder and was used extensively by British Anti-Aircraft troops until better optical height-finders were introduced. Its advantage was said to be that the height can be calculated from the observed quantities ‘very rapidly by the use of nothing but simple arithmetic’. It was also cheap to manufacture and easy to use.

After the end of World War I, Hartree returned to Cambridge graduating in 1922 with a Second Class degree in natural sciences.

==Atomic structure calculations==
In 1921, a visit by Niels Bohr to Cambridge inspired Hartree to apply his numerical skills to Bohr&#x27;s theory of the atom, for which he obtained his PhD in 1926 – his advisor was Ernest Rutherford. With the publication of Schrödinger&#x27;s equation in the same year, Hartree was able to apply his knowledge
of differential equations and numerical analysis to the new quantum theory.
He derived the Hartree equations for the distribution of electrons in an atom and proposed the self-consistent field method for their solution. The wavefunctions from this theory did not satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle for which Slater showed that determinantal functions are required. V. Fock published the &quot;equations with exchange&quot; now known as Hartree–Fock equations. These are considerably more demanding computationally even with the efficient methods Hartree proposed for the calculation of exchange contributions. Today, the Hartree-Fock equations are of great importance to the field of computational chemistry, and are applied and solved numerically within most of the density functional theory programs used for electronic structure calculations of molecules and condensed phase systems.

==Manchester years==

In 1929, Hartree was appointed to the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester. In 1933, he visited Vannevar Bush at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and learned first hand about his differential analyser. Immediately on his return to Manchester, he set about building his own analyser from Meccano. Seeing the potential for further exploiting his numerical methods using the machine, he persuaded Sir Robert McDougall to fund a more robust machine, which was built in collaboration with Metropolitan-Vickers.

The first application of the machine, reflecting Hartree&#x27;s enthusiasm for railways, was calculating timetables for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. He spent the rest of the decade applying the differential analyser to find solutions of differential equations arising in physics, including control theory and laminar boundary layer theory in fluid dynamics, making significant contributions to each of the fields.

The differential analyser was not suitable for the solution of equations with exchange. When Fock&#x27;s publication pre-empted Hartree&#x27;s work on equations with exchange, Hartree turned his research to radio-wave propagation that led to the Appleton–Hartree equation. In 1935, his father, William Hartree, offered to do calculations for him. Results with exchange soon followed. Douglas recognised the importance of configuration interaction that he referred to as &quot;superposition of configurations&quot;.
The first multiconfiguration Hartree–Fock results were published by father, son, and Bertha Swirles (later Lady Jeffreys) in 1939.

At Hartree&#x27;s suggestion, Bertha Swirles proceeded to derive equations with exchange for atoms using the Dirac equation in 1935. With Hartree&#x27;s advice, the first relativistic calculations (without exchange) were reported in 1940 by A. O. Williams, a student of R. B. Lindsay.

==Second World War==
During the Second World War Hartree supervised two computing groups. The first group, for the Ministry of Supply, has been described by Jack Howlett as a &quot;job shop&quot; for the solution of differential equations. At the outbreak of World War II, the differential analyser at the University
of Manchester was the only full-size (eight integrator)
differential analyser in the country. Arrangements were made to have the machine available
for work in support of the national war effort. In time, the group consisted of four members (Jack Howlett, Nicholas R. Eyres, J. G. L. Michel, Douglas Hartree, and Phyllis Lockett Nicolson). Problems were submitted to the group without information about the source but included the automatic tracking of targets, radio propagation, underwater explosions, heat flow in steel, and the diffusion equation later found to be for isotope separation. The second group was the magnetron research group of
Phyllis Lockett Nicolson, David Copely, and Oscar Buneman.
The work was done for the Committee for the Co-ordination of the Valve Development assisting the development of radar. A differential analyser could have been used if more integrators had been available, so Hartree set up his group as three &quot;CPUs&quot; to work on mechanical desk calculators in parallel. For a method of solution, he selected what is now a classical particle simulation.
Hartree never published any of his magnetron research findings in journals though he wrote numerous highly technical secret reports during the war.

In April 1944 a committee which included Hartree recommended that a mathematical section be set up within the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). In October this recommendation was put into effect with its first two objectives being the investigation of the possible adaptation of automatic telephone equipment to scientific equipment and the development of electronic computing devices suitable for rapid computing. One suspects that some members already knew of the Colossus computer. John R. Womersley (Turing&#x27;s bête noire) was the first Director. In February 1945 he went on a two-month tour of computing installations in the US, including visiting ENIAC (still not complete). He became acquainted with drafts of von Neumann&#x27;s famous June 1945 EDVAC report. About two months later Hartree also went over to see ENIAC, not then publicly known.

==Later life and work==
In February 1946, Max Newman (who had been involved in the Colossus computer) submitted an application to the Royal Society for funds to start the task of building a general-purpose computer at the University of Manchester. The Royal Society referred the request to Hartree and C.G. Darwin, Director of the NPL, to advise them. Hartree recommended the grant but Darwin opposed it on the grounds that Turing&#x27;s ACE at NPL would be sufficient to serve the needs of the country. But Hartree&#x27;s view won the day and the Manchester developments in computing were started.

Hartree did further work in control systems and was involved in the early application of digital computers, advising the US military on the use of ENIAC for calculating ballistics tables. In the summer of 1946 Hartree made his second trip to ENIAC as an evaluation of its applicability to a broad range of science, when he became the first civilian to program it. For this he selected a problem involving the flow of a compressible fluid over a surface, such as air over the surface of a wing travelling faster than the speed of sound.

At the end of 1945 or very early in 1946 Hartree briefed Maurice Wilkes of the University of Cambridge on the comparative developments in computing in the USA which he had seen. Wilkes, then received an invitation from the Moore School of Electrical Engineering (the builders of ENIAC) to attend a course on electronic computers. Before leaving for this, Hartree was able to brief him more fully on ENIAC. It was on the boat home that Wilkes planned the original design of EDSAC, which was to become operational in May 1949. Hartree worked closely with Wilkes in developing use of the machine for a wide range of problems and, most importantly, showed users from a number of areas in the university how they could use it in their research work.

Hartree returned to Cambridge to take up the post of Plummer professor of mathematical physics in 1946. In October he gave an inaugural lecture entitled &quot;Calculating Machines: Recent and Prospective Developments and their impact on Mathematical Physics&quot;. This described ENIAC and the work that Hartree had done on it. Even in 1946, two years before stored programming electronic computing became a reality, Hartree saw the need for the use of sub-routines. His inaugural lecture ended with a look at what computers might do. He said: &quot;..there are, I understand many problems of economic, medical and sociological interest and importance awaiting study which at present cannot be undertaken because of the formidable load of computing involved.&quot;

On 7 November 1946 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, having interviewed Hartree, quoted him as saying: &quot;The implications of the machine are so vast that we cannot conceive how they will affect our civilisation. Here you have something which is making one field of human activity 1,000 times faster. In the field of transportation, the equivalent to ACE would be the ability to travel from London to Cambridge ... in five seconds as a regular thing. It is almost unimaginable.&quot;

Hartree&#x27;s fourth and final major contribution to British computing started in early 1947 when the catering firm of J. Lyons &amp; Co. in London heard of the ENIAC and sent a small team in the summer of that year to study what was happening in the US, because they felt that these new computers might be of assistance in the huge amount of administrative and accounting work which the firm had to do. The team met with Col. Herman Goldstine at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton who wrote to Hartree telling him of their search. As soon as he received this letter, Hartree wrote and invited representatives of Lyons to come to Cambridge for a meeting with him and Wilkes. This led to the development of a commercial version of EDSAC developed by Lyons, called LEO, the first computer used for commercial business applications. After Hartree&#x27;s death, the headquarters of LEO Computers was renamed Hartree House. This illustrates the extent to which Lyons felt that Hartree had contributed to their new venture.

Hartree&#x27;s last famous contribution to computing was an estimate in 1950 of the potential demand for computers, which was much lower than turned out to be the case: &quot;We have a computer here in Cambridge, one in Manchester and one at the [NPL]. I suppose there ought to be one in Scotland, but that&#x27;s about all.&quot; Such underestimates of the number of computers that would be required were common at the time.

Hartree&#x27;s last PhD student at Cambridge, Charlotte Froese Fischer, became known for the development and implementation of the multi-configuration Hartree–Fock (MCHF) approach to atomic structure calculations and for her theoretical prediction concerning the existence of the negative calcium ion.

==Personal life==
Outside of his professional life, Douglas Hartree was passionate about music, having an extensive knowledge of orchestral and chamber music. He played piano and was conductor of an amateur orchestra. This passion for music was perhaps what brought him together with his wife, Elaine Charlton, who was an accomplished pianist. Their marriage resulted in two sons, Oliver and John Richard, and one daughter, Margaret. He died of heart failure in Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital, Cambridge, on 12 February 1958.

<text>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, commonly known as the Mellon Foundation, is a New York City-based private foundation with wealth accumulated by Andrew Mellon of the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is the product of the 1969 merger of the Avalon Foundation and the Old Dominion Foundation. These foundations had been set up separately by Ailsa Mellon Bruce and Paul Mellon, the children of Andrew Mellon.

The foundation is housed in New York City in the expanded former offices of the Bollingen Foundation, another educational philanthropy once supported by Paul Mellon. Poet and scholar Elizabeth Alexander is the foundation&#x27;s current president. Her predecessors have included Earl Lewis, Don Randel, William G. Bowen, John Edward Sawyer and Nathan Pusey.

In 2004, the foundation was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

==Areas of interest==
* Higher education, including the humanities, libraries, and scholarly communication and information technology
* Museums and art conservation
* Performing arts
* Conservation and the environment

==Organization==
Mellon&#x27;s research group has investigated doctoral education, collegiate admissions, independent research libraries, charitable nonprofits, scholarly communications, and other issues to ensure that the foundation&#x27;s grants would be well-informed and more effective. Some of the recent publications of this effect include &quot;Equity and Excellence in American Higher Education&quot;, &quot;Reclaiming the Game: College Sports and Educational Values&quot;, &quot;JSTOR: A History&quot;, &quot;The Game of Life: College Sports and Educational Values&quot;, and &quot;The Shape of the River&quot;.

Mellon&#x27;s endowment fluctuates in the range of $5 to $6 billion, and its annual grant-making amounts to about $300 million.

According to Alexander, Mellon supports the “work, experiences, and visions of disabled artists.&quot; In July 2024, the Ford and Mellon Foundations named 20 &quot;Disability Futures Fellows,&quot; including a Broadway composer, a Marvel video game voice actress, and a three-time Pushcart Prize-nominated poet.

<text>The Pelham Islands are a group of islands in western Long Island Sound that belonged to Thomas Pell in the 17th century. The islands, and most of the surrounding area, were purchased from the Siwanoy Indians by Pell in 1654, creating Pelham Manor. This large tract of land would eventually become the present-day Town and Village of Pelham and Pelham Manor, Town of Eastchester, cities of New Rochelle and Mount Vernon in Westchester County, and the Pelham Bay and Eastchester neighborhoods of the Bronx in New York City.

Several of the Pelham Islands became part of New Rochelle after Jacob Leisler’s purchase of from the Pell family in 1688. The remaining islands became part of Bronx County in 1895 with the establishment of the current Westchester-Bronx County line.

* The Blauzes - a pair of small islands in City Island Harbor made of Manhattan schist bedrock.
* Chimney Sweeps Islands - a pair of small, uninhabited islands made entirely of bedrock. The islands were acquired by the government of New York City on April 29, 1939, and are now part of Pelham Bay Park.
* City Island - originally known as “Great Minnefords”, the 235 acre island is the largest of the group. Before the Revolutionary War, Benjamin Palmer renamed it &quot;City Island&quot; as part of his plans to create a great port city. The onset of the Revolutionary War brought an end to those plans. It remained part of the Town of Pelham until June 6, 1895, when the present boundary line between Westchester and Bronx Counties was established, placing City Island within Bronx County, City of New York.
* Davids Island - a 78-acre island in New Rochelle. The island has been used as farmland by the early Huguenot settlers, a military hospital for injured Civil War soldiers, a U.S. Army Fort (Fort Slocum), and a U.S. Army Air Defense Command &quot;Nike&quot; missile site during the Cold War.
* Goose Island - a series of rocky outcroppings located in New Rochelle
* Hart Island - originally known as “Little Minnefords”, the 101 acre island lies off the eastern shore of City Island, The federal government took possession of the island during the Civil War for use as a training facility. The City of New York purchased Hart Island in 1868 and has been used as a quarantine site for infected individuals during the Yellow Fever Epidemic, a reformatory for vicious boys, a home for German prisoners of war during World War II, a &quot;Nike&quot; missile installation used by the U.S. Army Air Defense Command during the Cold War, and a facility for the rehabilitation of drug addicts. It is now the city&#x27;s primary potter&#x27;s field.
* High Island - an 8-acre island was purchased in 1762 by Captain John Wooley, which he then named &quot;High Island&quot; for its elevated center. A radio broadcasting company bought the island in 1962 and built an automobile bridge to City Island. WCBS and WFAN currently operate the 529-foot antenna tower on the island.
* Hunter Island - the 19th century country estate of the wealthy New York City merchant John Hunter. When the New York City government developed Pelham Bay Park in 1937, the stretch of water between Hunter&#x27;s Island and the land opposite City Island Bridge was filled, converting the island into a peninsula.
* Rat Island - a 2.5 acre island which has been used as a typhoid quarantine hospital, an artists&#x27; and writers&#x27; colony, and a fisherman’s campsite.
* Travers Island - a former island connected by landfill to mainland New Rochelle, and is the summer home of the New York Athletic Club.
* Twin Island - a former island which was connected to Rodman&#x27;s Neck by landfill in the 1930s. They are now part of Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay Park.

<doc id="1252702" wikidata="Q1859617" url="?curid=1252702" title="HMS Campbeltown (I42)">
<text>HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was a destroyer of the Royal Navy during the Second World War. She was originally US destroyer , and was one of 50 obsolescent U.S. Navy destroyers transferred to the Royal Navy in 1940 as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. &quot;Campbeltown&quot; became one of the most famous of these ships when she was used in the St Nazaire Raid in 1942.

==Service history==

===As USS &quot;Buchanan&quot;===

USS &quot;Buchanan&quot; was a destroyer, ordered from the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, and laid down on 29 June 1918. She was launched on 2 January 1919 and commissioned into the Navy on 20 January. She had a typical inter-war career, and was placed into the reserve in 1939. She then became one of 50 destroyers transferred to the Royal Navy in 1940 after the finalisation of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. She was transferred on 3 September 1940 and commissioned on 9 September at Halifax, Canada. That very same day, Lieutenant Isaac William Trant Beloe became her captain.

===As HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot;===
Having been formally commissioned, she took passage from Halifax to Plymouth, travelling via St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. She arrived at Devonport Dockyard on 29 September and was taken in hand for modifications to fit her for service with the Royal Navy. The refits lasted throughout October, and on completion of the final harbour trials on 1 November 1940 she was nominated to join the 17th Flotilla operating in the Western Approaches. The next day, while carrying out sea trials she collided with SS &quot;Risoy&quot; and sustained damage, but continued and arrived safely at Liverpool, where she underwent repairs from 7 to 24 November. She then joined the flotilla.

On 29 November, she ran down and sank the British coaster in the Mersey Estuary. She began deploying with the flotilla in early December, but on 3 December she collided with SS &quot;Comus&quot; and had to put into port for repairs again. The repairs lasted until late March, and involved the shortening of the fourth funnel.

On completion of the work on 28 March 1941, &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was transferred on loan to the Royal Netherlands Navy as HNLMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, where she joined the 7th Escort Group and deployed with them in April–May. Lieutenant Isaac William Trant Beloe was replaced by Lieutenant William Harmsen. The Dutch proposed to rename her &quot;Middelburg&quot;, but this was not agreed as it would have been contrary to the naming agreed with the U.S. Navy. She underwent further repairs throughout June and resumed convoy defence with the group in July–August. She was then nominated to be returned to the Royal Navy in September, but remained with the 7th Escort Group. She spent September working up with her Royal Navy crew and rejoined the group in October, where she covered convoys between Britain and West Africa. On 15 September she picked up the survivors of the Norwegian motor tanker &quot;Vinga&quot;, which had been damaged in an enemy air attack. She carried out escort duties in November–December, before taking passage to Devonport to undergo repairs.

====The St Nazaire Raid====


&quot;Campbeltown&quot; began the Devonport repairs in January. During this time, she was selected for a special operation and was withdrawn from regular service for modifications. She was to be used in Operation Chariot, a planned assault operation on the docks at Saint-Nazaire. In 1942 the German battleship —anchored at Trondheim in Norway—was considered to present a grave threat to Atlantic convoys. Should &quot;Tirpitz&quot; enter the Atlantic, the Louis Joubert drydock at Saint-Nazaire—which had originally been built for the liner —was a vital target; it was the only German-held drydock on the European coast of the Atlantic that was large enough to service the battleship. If this drydock could be put out of action, any offensive sortie by &quot;Tirpitz&quot; into the Atlantic would be much more dangerous for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to carry out, making it less likely that they would risk deploying her.

Operation Chariot was a plan to ram an explosive-laden warship into the dock gates. Accompanying her would be 18 small boats carrying British Commandos, who would destroy the dock&#x27;s pumping and winding machinery and other infrastructure. The troops would then be evacuated by the small boats before the explosives in the ship detonated. A particular difficulty was that the dock was located several miles up the estuary of the Loire River. As an obsolescent destroyer, &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was considered to be expendable and was selected to be the ram-ship. She spent February undergoing modifications. These included removing her third and fourth funnels and having the remaining two funnels raked to simulate the structure and appearance of a German Raubvogel-class torpedo boat. A 12-pounder gun was installed forward and eight Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannon were mounted on the upper deck. Some extra armour was provided to protect the bridge structure, and unnecessary stores and equipment were removed to lighten the destroyer.

An explosive charge consisting of 24 Mark VII depth charges—containing a total of of amatol high explosive—was fitted into steel tanks installed just behind the steel pillar that supported her most forward gun mount. The charges were to be detonated by multiple eight-hour time pencils connected together by cordtex, set before steaming out and cemented in to prevent any interference with the detonation. &quot;Campbeltown&quot; steamed from Devonport to Falmouth, Cornwall on 25 March to join the other ships that would take part in the operation. The crew—which would be evacuated with the commandos—was reduced to 75 men, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Stephen Beattie.

A flotilla of 21 vessels—&quot;Campbeltown&quot;, 16 Fairmile B motor launches, one motor torpedo boat and a Fairmile C motor gun boat acting as the troops&#x27; headquarters—left Falmouth at 14:00 on 26 March 1942, escorted for most of the crossing to France by two Hunt-class escort destroyers. (HMS Tynedale and HMS Atherstone) Apart from a brief clash with , whose captain misreported the task force&#x27;s course and composition, the ships reached France unmolested. One motor launch suffered mechanical problems and had to return to England.

The preliminary air raid carried out through heavy cloud by 35 Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys and 25 Vickers Wellingtons was much smaller than originally planned and was ineffective, merely alerting the defenders of something unusual happening. Nevertheless, by flashing genuine German recognition signals, the force, with &quot;Campbeltown&quot; flying the flag of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, approached to within less than of the harbour before being fired upon. &quot;Campbeltown&quot;—as the largest target—drew most of the fire. During the final approach, the crew of &quot;Campbeltown&quot; lowered the emblem of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and hoisted the battle ensign of the Royal Navy.
At 01:34 on 28 March, four minutes later than planned, &quot;Campbeltown&quot; rammed the dock gate. The Commandos and ship&#x27;s crew came ashore under heavy German fire and set about demolishing the dock machinery. 169 of the raiders were killed (64 commandos and 105 sailors) out of the 611 men in the attacking force. Of the survivors, 215 were captured and 222 were evacuated by the surviving small craft. A further five evaded capture and travelled overland through France to Spain and then to Gibraltar, a British territory.

The charges in &quot;Campbeltown&quot; exploded at noon, an hour and a half later than the British had expected. Although the ship had been searched by the Germans, the explosives had not been detected. The explosion killed around 250 German soldiers and French civilians and demolished both the front half of the destroyer and the caisson of the drydock, with the rush of water into the drydock washing the remains of the ship into it. The Saint-Nazaire drydock was rendered unusable for the rest of the war and was not repaired until 1947, and only resumed normal service in 1948.

The delayed-action torpedoes fired by the motor torpedo boat into the outer lock gate to the submarine basin detonated, as planned, on the night of 30 March. This later explosion led to panic, with German forces firing on French civilians and on each other. Sixteen French civilians were killed and around thirty wounded. Later, 1,500 civilians were arrested and interned in a camp at Savenay and most of their houses were demolished, even though they had had nothing to do with the raid. Lt-Cdr Beattie—who was taken prisoner—received the Victoria Cross for his valour and in 1947 received the French &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;. His Victoria Cross was one of five that were awarded to participants in the raid, along with 80 other military decorations.

==Legacy==
The ship&#x27;s bell of HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was given to the town of Campbelltown, Pennsylvania, as a gesture of appreciation towards the United States for the Destroyers for Bases Agreement program. This ship&#x27;s bell was later lent by the town to the subsequent , a Type 22 frigate, when she was commissioned in 1989 and was returned on 21 June 2011 after HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was decommissioned.

The 1952 film &quot;The Gift Horse&quot; was loosely based on the story of HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot;.

<text>Andrzej Potocki (; 1630 – 30 August 1691) was a Polish nobleman, magnate, politician, general and military commander. He held a number of political and military positions and was a skilled commander and successfully protected the Eastern Borderlands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the invading armies of Ottoman Turkey, Cossacks and Tatars.

==Biography==
Andrzej Potocki was the son of Hetman Stanisław &quot;Rewera&quot; Potocki. In 1660 he became the Great Chorąży of the Crown and later the voivode of Kiev Voivodship (from 1668) and voivode of Kraków Voivodship (from 1682). He distinguished himself in the battle of Khotyn, where he commanded the left wing of the royal army (1673). After the abdication of John II Casimir in 1668, he strongly supported the candidacy of the Tsarevich Feodor, for which he was disliked by other nobles. He was a member of the Confederation of Malcontents in 1672. He participated in the Battle of Khotyn in 1673. Potocki later was one of the electors of John III Sobieski, representing the Kiev province in 1674, although he opposed the pro-French and anti-Brandenburgian policies of the king. In 1675 he was responsible for defeating the Tatars at the battle of Kałusz. In 1680 Potocki was appointed the governor of Kraków and subsequently the Kraków castellan in 1682. In 1683 during an expedition to Vienna, Potocki was nominated as the chief ruler of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Sobieski was absent. Potocki successfully conducted warfare in the south-eastern parts of the country, known as Podolia, and regained large parts of the land (including Niemirów) from the Turks. For this, in 1684, he was appointed the Field Crown Hetman. He later took part in the unsuccessful expeditions against Moldavia in 1685. He was also starost of Halicz, Wyszogród, Leżajsk, Śniatyń, Kołomyja, Mościsk and Medyka.

After his death in 1691, Potocki was buried in the city of Stanisławów (named after his father), where he founded a new catholic collegiate church. His remains were desecrated and thrown out of the tomb, during the planned destruction of the church by Ukrainian communists after 1963.

His animal form is the Black Dragon and his stellar animal is the tortoise-snake. By virtue of his association with the north, he has been identified and revered frequently as a representation of the supreme God of Heaven.

His planet is Mercury. His animal form is the Black Dragon and his stellar animal is the tortoise-snake.

==Taoist myths involving the Black Deity==
A Taoist title of Heidi is the &quot;Dark (or Mysterious) Heavenly Highest Deity&quot; (). According to a myth, during the fall of the Shang, the Demon King ravaged the world, so that Yuanshi Tianzun ordered the Jade Emperor to appoint Heidi as the commander of twelve heavenly legions to fight this evil. Heidi defeated the Demon King and was subsequently granted the title of Mysterious Heavenly Highest Deity. In temples dedicated to him, the bronze tortoise and serpent under the feet of his image signify that the good always prevails over evil.

<doc id="1252758" wikidata="Q1420195" url="?curid=1252758" title="Tomb of Seti I">
<text>The tomb of Seti I, also known by its tomb number, KV17, is the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I of the Nineteenth Dynasty. Located in Egypt&#x27;s Valley of the Kings, It is also known by the names &quot;Belzoni&#x27;s tomb&quot;, &quot;the Tomb of Apis&quot;, and &quot;the Tomb of Psammis, son of Nechois&quot;. It is one of the most decorated tombs in the valley, and is one of the largest and deepest tombs in the Valley of the Kings. It was uncovered by Italian archaeologist and explorer Giovanni Battista Belzoni on 16 October 1817.

== Design ==
Previously considered the longest tomb in the valley until the discovery of the Tomb of the Sons of Ramesses II, at 137.19 meters (450.10 feet), it contains well preserved reliefs in all but two of its seventeen chambers and side rooms.

The design of the tomb follows a &quot;joggled axis&quot; style of architecture; the tomb entry&#x27;s descending line is interrupted by a &quot;wiggle&quot; that changes to a sharper angle of descent when entering the tomb following the first chamber. The entry to the tomb consists of four hallways (A–D), each leading further underground; they have a number of murals depicting traditional religious imagery along with illustrations of Seti I before Ra. Deeper into the tomb, rooms F, Fa, J, Jb, Jc and Jd have intricately carved support pillars with well preserved decorations. It is also one of the first discovered tombs to have a vaulted burial chamber, along with remaining examples of construction, such as plastered over postholes where wooden beams would have been.

In common with many early tombs in the valley, chamber E has a well shaft cut into the floor.

A tunnel known as corridor K slopes downward from beneath the location where the sarcophagus stood in the burial chamber. In 1960, the first attempt at excavation resulted in the partial clearance of nearly of the tunnel. Due to the poor quality of the rock through which the tunnel was cut, this excavation was abandoned for safety reasons. From 2007 to 2010, the Supreme Council of Antiquities undertook a second excavation, installing steel supports and a railway system for removing debris. Two staircases were uncovered, with the tunnel ending abruptly at the bottom of the second. The total length of the tunnel is .

=== Decoration ===
The entry corridors (Corridors B–D) are heavily decorated with symbols of the Pharaoh, like those of Ma&#x27;at and a list of Set&#x27;s royal names and epithets. One of the back chambers is decorated with the Opening of the mouth ceremony, which shows the Egyptian belief that a magic religious ceremony would open the lungs and throat of the mummy, allowing them to breathe in the afterlife. Considered a very important religious ceremony, a semi-complete depiction of this ritual provides an in-depth view of the pantheon of practices undertaken to ensure safe passage into the afterlife. Further into the tomb are numerous depictions of King Seti with numerous Gods. Chamber F depicts images of Seti with Hathor, Horus and Neith, along with intact mural examples of the Book of Gates.The tomb is covered floor to ceiling by detailed murals and reliefs. The ceiling of the vaulted burial chamber depicts a series of astronomical motifs, with golden stars on a deep blue background. Other decorations are religious in nature, including depictions of the Litany of Ra, the Book of The Dead, the Imydwat, the Book of The Heavenly Cow and depictions of Seti with various deities. There are also depictions of the King alone, standing in the pillars of the room. Each room is heavily decorated, both wall and ceiling, along with numerous columns and floor skirting. Much of the floor skirting is damaged, due to both the ravages of time and the damage due to excavation.

Parts of the tomb ceilings have been painted with gold stars on a deep blue sky, a common motif in temples and tombs in Egypt. Numerous rooms in Seti&#x27;s tomb use the motif, including rooms such as side chamber Jb with the Imydwat. There are many richly decorated rooms, with their own general themes.

== Archaeology and conservation ==
The tomb was uncovered by Italian explorer and early Egyptologist Giovanni Battista Belzoni on 16 October 1817. Upon entering the tomb, Belzoni found the wall paintings in excellent condition with the paint on the walls still looking fresh, and some of the artists&#x27; paints and brushes still on the floor. The tomb became known as the &quot;Apis tomb&quot; upon the discovery of a mummified Apis Bull found in a side room off the burial hall when Belzoni uncovered the tomb.
The body identified as Seti&#x27;s mummy was not found in his coffin upon Belzoni&#x27;s discovery of the tomb, but rather in the royal cache DB320 amongst 36 other mummies. His coffin (perhaps the inner or secondary coffin) was heavily damaged, as was his mummy. It has been postulated that priests of numerous dynasties attempted restorations of both his tomb and his coffin, but his mummy was finally moved in the Year 11 of Shoshenq I to cache DB320. The outer coffin was going to be sold by Belzoni to the British Museum in 1817, but it was sold for US$2000 to a British architect later that year, and now rests in the Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum.

Much of the structural damage to the tomb before the 1950s and 1960s was caused by Belzoni. Belzoni, in an effort to bring back pieces of Egyptian art, damaged much of the work within the tomb. He made &quot;squeezes&quot;, a form of copying artwork by pressing wet wax, plaster and sometimes paper against the reliefs; when they dried, the color was pulled away, and a negative impression was made of the carvings, but it also damaged many of the reliefs and carvings. Beyond the use of &quot;squeezes&quot;, Belzoni also hacked off large pieces of relief to send back to Europe, along with clearing rubble that held back flash floodwaters; the tomb subsequently flooded, damaging large portions of the structure and damaged the reliefs in the entryway.

The outer layer of the sarcophagus of Seti I, removed on behalf of the British consul Henry Salt, is located in the Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum in London since 1824. Jean-François Champollion, translator of the Rosetta Stone, removed a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05 m (7.41 x 3.44 ft) in a corridor with mirror-image scenes during his 1828–29 expedition. Other elements were removed by his companion Rossellini or by Karl Richard Lepsius in the German expedition of 1845. The scenes are now in the collections of the Louvre in Paris, the Egyptian Museum in Florence, and the Neues Museum in Berlin.

A number of walls in the tomb have collapsed or cracked due to excavations in the late 1950s and early 1960s causing significant changes in the moisture levels in the surrounding rocks.

There have been a number of recent 21st century attempts at preservation, both through image-mapping projects like the Theban Mapping Project and the Maidan Project, and through intense laser scanning of the reliefs on the walls of the tomb by the Factum Foundation leading to much of the images within the tomb available to the public. A 3-D scan of the temple was made available in 2002, allowing viewers to &#x27;walk&#x27; through the tomb through a series of 3D photos. Restoration has been a nearly constant effort, as the tomb remains closed due to damage.

Facsimiles of two rooms from the tomb, the Hall of Beauties and Pillared Hall J, were made by the Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation in 2017.

== Tourism ==
Due to excavation and the damages of improperly regulated tourism, visitations may or may not be possible, as archaeology efforts in the 1950s and 1960s have made parts of the tomb unstable. However, as of 2023, the Tomb is open for visitations. The price of entry into the tomb, as stated by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, is EGP 2000 for adult foreigners and students, but for Egyptians the ticket price is EGP 500 for adults and EGP 250 for students.
