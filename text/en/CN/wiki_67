<doc id="1252775" wikidata="Q386702" url="?curid=1252775" title="Pterin">
<text>Pterin is a heterocyclic compound composed of a pteridine ring system, with a &quot;keto group&quot; (a lactam) and an amino group on positions 4 and 2 respectively. It is structurally related to the parent bicyclic heterocycle called pteridine. Pterins, as a group, are compounds related to pterin with additional substituents. Pterin itself is of no biological significance. 

Pterins were first discovered in the pigments of butterfly wings (hence the origin of their name, from the Greek &quot;pteron&quot; (), wing) and perform many roles in coloration in the biological world.

== Chemistry ==
Pterins exhibit a wide range of tautomerism in water, beyond what is assumed by just keto-enol tautomerism. For the unsubstituted pterin, at least five tautomers are commonly cited. For 6-methylpterin, seven tautomers are theoretically predicted to be important in solution.

The pteridine ring system contains four nitrogen atoms, reducing its aromaticity to the point that it can be attacked by nucleophile. Pterins can take three oxidation states on the ring system: the unprefixed oxidized form, the 7,8-dihydro semi-reduced form (among other, less stable tautomers), and finally the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro fully-reduced form. The latter two are more common in biological systems.

== Biosynthesis ==
Pterin rings are either salvaged from existing ones or produced &quot;de novo&quot; in living organisms. The ring comes from rearrangement of guanosine in bacteria and humans.
==Pterin cofactors==
Pterin derivatives are common cofactors in all domains of life.

=== Folates ===
One important family of pterin derivatives are folates. Folates are pterins that contain &quot;p&quot;-aminobenzoic acid connected to the methyl group at position 6 of the pteridine ring system (known as pteroic acid) conjugated with one or more -glutamates. They participate in numerous biological group transfer reactions. Folate-dependent biosynthetic reactions include the transfer of methyl groups from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine to form -methionine, and the transfer of formyl groups from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to -methionine to form &quot;N&quot;-formylmethionine in initiator tRNAs. Folates are also essential for the biosynthesis of purines and one pyrimidine.

Substituted pteridines are intermediates in the biosynthesis of dihydrofolic acid in many microorganisms. The enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase converts pteridine and 4-aminobenzoic acid to dihydrofolic acid in the presence of glutamate. The enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase is inhibited by sulfonamide antibiotics.

=== Molybdopterin ===

Molybdopterin is a cofactor found in virtually all molybdenum and tungsten-containing proteins. It binds molybdenum to yield redox cofactors involved in biological hydroxylations, reduction of nitrate, and respiratory oxidation.

Molybdopterin biosynthesis does not use the conventional GTPCH-1 pathway. It occurs in four steps:
# the radical-mediated cyclization of nucleotide, guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP), to (8&quot;S&quot;)‑3′,8‐cyclo‑7,8‑dihydroguanosine 5′-triphosphate (3′,8‑cH2GTP), 
# the formation of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) from the 3′,8‑cH2GTP, 
# the conversion of cPMP into molybdopterin (MPT),
# the insertion of molybdate into MPT to form Moco (molybdenum cofactor).

===Tetrahydrobiopterin===
Tetrahydrobiopterin, the major unconjugated pterin in vertebrates, is involved in three families of enzymes that effect hydroxylation. The aromatic amino acid hydroxylases include phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylases. They are involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters catecholamine and serotonin. Tetrahydrobiopterin is also required for the functioning of alkylglycerol monooxygenase, whereby monoalkylglycerols are broken down to glycerol and an aldehyde. In the synthesis of nitric oxide the pterin-dependent nitric oxide synthase converts arginine to its &quot;N&quot;-hydroxy derivative, which in turn releases nitric oxide.

===Other pterins===

Tetrahydromethanopterin is a cofactor in methanogenesis, which is a metabolism adopted by many organisms, as a form of anaerobic respiration. It carries the C1 substrate in the course of the formation or production of methane. It is structurally similar to folate.

===Pterin pigments===
Cyanopterin is a glycosylated derivative of pteridine, having an unknown function in cyanobacteria.

<text>The Seminole Gulf Railway is a short line freight and passenger excursion railroad headquartered in Fort Myers, Florida, that operates two former CSX Transportation railroad lines in Southwest Florida. The company&#x27;s Fort Myers Division, which was previously the southernmost segment of CSX&#x27;s Fort Myers Subdivision, runs from Arcadia south to North Naples via Punta Gorda, Fort Myers, Estero, and Bonita Springs. The company&#x27;s other line, the Sarasota Division, runs from Oneco south through Sarasota. Seminole Gulf acquired the lines in November 1987 and operates its own equipment. The company&#x27;s first train departed Fort Myers on November 14, 1987.

The Seminole Gulf Railway had a commonly owned affiliated company, the Bay Colony Railroad Corp. , which was based in southeastern Massachusetts.

==Current operations==
===Freight===
Seminole Gulf Railway is one of two freight railroads operating in Southwest Florida (the other is South Central Florida Express, which operates tracks farther inland near Clewiston). Freight transported by Seminole Gulf Railway includes lumber, propane, stone, steel, scrap metal, and other commodities. Freight is interchanged with CSX usually once or twice a week on each line. On the Fort Myers Division, freight trains between the yard in Fort Myers and Arcadia are known as the Desoto Turn. The Desoto Turn switches customers between North Fort Myers and Arcadia while industries in Fort Myers and south of there are switched locally from the yard.

===Murder Mystery Dinner Train and Excursions===

In addition to carrying freight, Seminole Gulf Railway also operates a popular Murder Mystery Dinner Train from Fort Myers. Under normal operation, the dinner train runs five nights a week, year-round from a station at Colonial Boulevard north to a point just south of Punta Gorda before returning. The dinner train is often headed by a vintage EMD F-unit locomotive, SGLR 502, which previously operated on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road. The train uses a fleet of 1930s-era vintage rail cars named after nearby barrier islands (some of which were previously Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus rail cars). The dinner train includes a five-course dinner and has featured over 80 different murder mystery productions throughout its history.
Special holiday dinner trains also operate including &quot;Sweetheart Express&quot; on Valentine&#x27;s Day, &quot;Halloween Ghost Train&quot;, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve Gala&quot;, and &quot;Christmas Rail-Boat&quot; (which runs to the historic Punta Gorda Atlantic Coast Line Depot for a Christmas boat tour through Punta Gorda Isles) to name a few.

Seminole Gulf has also operated general excursion trains in the past. Seminole Gulf first introduced passenger excursion trains and dinner trains in 1991 after losing a major freight customer. The first excursion train ran on January 5, 1991, which initially operated from a small platform in North Naples near Railhead Park. In 1993, excursion trains began operating from the current station near Colonial Boulevard in Fort Myers and ran between there and the platform at Old Depot Park in Bonita Springs, though dinner trains only operated from Fort Myers. By the late 1990s, excursion trains discontinued operation south of Fort Myers and instead ran north of Fort Myers until their discontinuation (which left the Murder Mystery Dinner Train as Seminole Gulf&#x27;s only passenger service).

==Fort Myers Division==

===Route description===

Seminole Gulf&#x27;s Fort Myers Division, which extends nearly 80 miles, begins in Arcadia and runs south to Punta Gorda, Fort Myers, Bonita Springs, and North Naples.

The Fort Myers Division begins just north of Arcadia, where it continues south from CSX&#x27;s Brewster Subdivision (at milepost SVC 880.75). From this point, it runs south across the Peace River, passing Morgan Park, and turns southwest into the Arcadia yard. CSX has trackage rights into Arcadia yard to facilitate the interchange between the two companies.

From the yard, the main line continues from a wye southeast a short distance before turning southwest near downtown Arcadia. From here, it roughly parallels the Peace River through Fort Ogden and Cleveland to Punta Gorda. In Punta Gorda, it turns south and then southeast closely paralleling Interstate 75 towards North Fort Myers before crossing the Caloosahatchee River between there and Tice. The crossing over the Caloosahatchee River includes a drawbridge and series of trestles that traverse Beautiful Island. From Tice on the south side of the river, the line turns southwest and runs parallel the river towards Downtown Fort Myers. Just east of downtown, the line turns south and enters Fort Myers yard limits. Seminole Gulf&#x27;s main switching yard in Fort Myers is located south of Hanson Street under the Metro Parkway overpass, and a maintenance yard is just south of Colonial Boulevard next to Page Field.

From the yards, the main line continues south along the Ten Mile Canal (the John Yarbrough Linear Park parallels the line along the canal). The line has a short spur just north San Carlos Park known as the Baker Spur, which extends west a little over a mile along Alico Road.

From the Baker Spur, the main line then heads south through Estero and Downtown Bonita Springs before terminating at a Cemex facility at the end of Wiggins Pass Road in North Naples, just a mile south of the Lee/Collier County line. The main line south of Alico Road has not had any active shippers and has been inactive since around 2008. As of early 2024, Seminole Gulf is planning to sell this segment of the line to be converted to the Bonita Estero Rail Trail.

===History===
What is now Seminole Gulf Railway&#x27;s main line came into existence incrementally in the late 1800s and early 20th century.

The northernmost section of the Seminole Gulf track along with the Arcadia yard and the CSX line to the north was originally built by the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway. Built from 1907 to 1910, the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway (which would later be acquired by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1926) historically extended from Arcadia south to Boca Grande. The line from the Arcadia yard southeast along Pine Street was the Charlotte Harbor and Northern&#x27;s connecting track to the Florida Southern Railway.
From this point, Seminole Gulf continues south along the former Florida Southern Railway (a subsidiary of Henry Plant&#x27;s system of railroads) south to Punta Gorda. This segment was built in 1886 making it the oldest segment of the Seminole Gulf line and was the southernmost segment of the Florida Southern&#x27;s Charlotte Harbor Division, which originated in Bartow. The original Florida Southern route north of Arcadia (which ran past the historic Arcadia passenger depot) was removed in 1984. Surveying work to determine the route for the Florida Southern Railway to Punta Gorda was done by Punta Gorda civil engineer Albert W. Gilchrist, who would later serve as Florida&#x27;s 20th governor. The line&#x27;s first train to Punta Gorda arrived on July 24, 1886. The line, originally built as narrow gauge, was widened to standard gauge in 1892, and the Florida Southern was fully integrated with the Plant System in 1896.

In Punta Gorda, the line initially continued west through the city and terminated at a dock facility in the Peace River near Charlotte Harbor. This dock, known as the Long Dock, was located near the Punta Gorda Isles Yacht Club (a mile west of where Fishermen&#x27;s Village stands today). A passenger depot was also located near King Street (the historic depot on Taylor Street was built later in 1928). Punta Gorda became the southernmost point the Plant System ever reached, and the railroad&#x27;s arrival is largely responsible for Punta Gorda&#x27;s development as a city, which was incorporated four years later. Today, the spur near Elizabeth Street in Punta Gorda is all that remains of the original alignment to the Punta Gorda docks (the Punta Gorda Linear Park today runs along the rest of that route west of US 41).

Charlotte Harbor was Henry Plant&#x27;s ultimate goal and he had no interest in having the line continue south to Fort Myers. This is despite the fact that Plant opened a hotel in Fort Myers in 1896. Fort Myers was seeking railroad service at the time and had already been established as a city unlike Punta Gorda. After Plant&#x27;s death in 1899, his heirs would sell his entire system of railroads to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) in 1902, and serving Fort Myers quickly became a top priority for ACL president Henry Walters. Construction commenced promptly on the extension to Fort Myers via Tice, which made it the ACL&#x27;s first expansion of the former Plant System. The alignment through Tice was selected so the line would cross the wide Caloosahatchee River farther upstream at Beautiful Island, where a series of shorter trestles could be built. The northernmost trestle originally had a steel swing span built by the American Bridge Company to accommodate river traffic. Service up to the Caloosahatchee River commenced in 1903. The first train reached Fort Myers on May 10, 1904 after the completion of the trestles over the river. 
In Fort Myers, the ACL built a depot downtown at Main and Monroe Streets and a wharf along the Caloosahatchee River at the end of Monroe Street. The original depot would be replaced with the depot that still stands today on Peck Street (now Widman Way) in 1924, and the wharf would only exist until 1944. The spur that runs from the line just south of State Road 82 is all that remains of the wye and tracks that once served the downtown Fort Myers depot and docks. Fort Myers also experienced major growth after the arrival of the railroad and would remain the southernmost point of the entire Atlantic Coast Line Railroad system until the Florida land boom of the 1920s.
Once the land boom was underway, the ACL partnered with a number of local businessmen including advertising entrepreneur Barron Collier, who owned large amounts of land in the newly created Collier County. Through this partnership, they acquired the dormant charter of the unbuilt Fort Myers Southern Railroad and used it to extend the line from Fort Myers further south into Collier County. The line reached Bonita Springs by late 1925 where a depot was built just south of the Imperial River (the depot has since been demolished but the depot&#x27;s platform and siding still remain near Riverside Park). The line was further extended to Naples by December 1926, and to Collier City on Marco Island in mid 1927. At the same time, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) was building a competing line from Fort Ogden to Fort Myers and Naples. SAL&#x27;s service to Naples commenced eleven days after the ACL, though SAL discontinued service to Naples by 1942. By 1944, the Atlantic Coast Line abandoned the line to Marco Island, and extended the remaining track from near Vanderbilt Beach down the ex-SAL right of way to the SAL&#x27;s former passenger depot on Fifth Avenue South.

The Atlantic Coast Line relocated its freight yard from downtown Fort Myers to its current location south of Hanson Street in 1960.
The Atlantic Coast Line became the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL) in 1967 after merging with the Seaboard Air Line, its former rival. The Baker Spur just north of San Carlos Park was then built in 1973. The Baker Spur would extend beyond the route of Interstate 75 to serve rock mines in eastern Lee County on land owned by the Atlantic Land and Improvement Company (known today as Alico, Inc.), which at one point had been a subsidiary of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and was the holding company for its real estate division. Seminole Gulf abandoned the easternmost three miles of the Baker Spur in 1994.

Intercity passenger service to Southwest Florida was discontinued in 1971 upon the creation of Amtrak, who opted not to serve Southwest Florida. In 1975, Seaboard Coast Line sold the Fort Myers passenger depot to the city of Fort Myers. In 1977, the swing bridge over the Caloosahatchee River was replaced by the current bascule bridge.
In early 1980, tracks into downtown Naples were removed and the line was cut back to its current terminus in North Naples. The area around the line&#x27;s new terminus in North Naples was subsequently developed into the Rail Head Industrial Park. Seminole Gulf began operating the line seven years later.

In the mid-2000s, a short stretch of the line between Edison Avenue and State Road 82 in Fort Myers was realigned and upgraded with continuous welded rail. The northern leg of the wye to Downtown Fort Myers was also severed at this time. This was done to accommodate the expansion of Evans Avenue.

On September 28, 2022, the Fort Myers Division received significant damage from the landfall of Hurricane Ian. At the north end of the line, Arcadia Yard was flooded and the three trestles across the Peace River in Arcadia were partially destroyed, severing the line from the CSX interchange. Three of the four trestles across the Caloosahatchee River near Tice were also destroyed. Due to the damage, Seminole Gulf had to divert freight to the Sarasota Division and transload it to trucks to serve customers on the Fort Myers Division. The Peace River trestles were repaired by February 2023 restoring service as far as North Fort Myers. Reconstruction of the Caloosahatchee River trestles was complete in February 2024.

==Sarasota Division==

===Route description===

In Sarasota, Seminole Gulf largely operates on a u-shaped line. The northwest end of the line is located just south of Bradenton in Oneco, where it continues south from CSX&#x27;s Palmetto Subdivision. The interchange point is located a little over a mile south of CSX&#x27;s Tropicana Yard, where a side track facilitates the interchange between the two companies. From Oneco, the line heads due south along former Seaboard Air Line Railroad tracks towards Sarasota, passing through Tallevast and close to Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport. The line&#x27;s locomotives are stored on a spur into Suburban Propane on Whitfield Avenue in Tallevast. Just north of Downtown Sarasota, the line turns east onto former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad tracks and comes to a wye just east of US 301. From the wye, the line turns back north along the former Atlantic Coast Line main line and terminates just south of Whitfield Avenue in Motoaka.

The line went as far south as Venice when Seminole Gulf first began operating it. Track to Venice previously ran from the wye at the southeast corner of the current line and went south-southeast through Fruitville, Bee Ridge, Palmer Ranch and Nokomis. Track was abandoned south of Palmer Ranch in 2004 and the remaining line up to Fruitville Road was abandoned in 2019. The Legacy Trail runs on the former right of way from Fruitville Road to Venice.

===History===
The first trackage of the Sarasota Division to be built (the west track) was built by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) through their Florida West Shore Railway subsidiary in 1903. It was part of a line that extended from Durant (just east of Tampa), to Sarasota via Parrish, Palmetto and Bradenton. Some of the line was built on the former road bed of the Arcadia, Gulf Coast and Lakeland Railroad, an earlier unsuccessful railroad between Bradenton and Sarasota. In Sarasota, the tracks originally continued south into downtown along Lemon Avenue and served a dock facility in Sarasota Bay. In 1905, Seaboard extended the line east into Fruitville, which initially ran southeast along Pineapple Avenue and then east along what is now Alderman Street and Brother Geenen Way. In 1911, at the request of local socialite Bertha Honoré Palmer, the line was extended south to Venice.

The Atlantic Coast Line (ACL) came to the area later in 1924 as part of the Florida land boom when they built the Tampa Southern Railroad (the east track). The ACL&#x27;s passenger depot existed at Main Street and School Avenue and a spur was built to Payne Terminal at Hog Creek (this spur and its wye today form the connection track between the east and west track). From Sarasota, the ACL track turned east and ran directly beside the SAL track through Fruitville. From 1924 to 1949, the ACL track continued from Fruitville southeast as far as Fort Ogden (along the Peace River), where it merged with the Coast Line&#x27;s route to Fort Myers (which is, coincidentally, Seminole Gulf&#x27;s Fort Myers Division). Spurs connected both lines to the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus&#x27;s Sarasota headquarters near Fruitville (which existed from 1927 to 1959, when the headquarters were relocated to the end of the line in Venice).

In 1967, the Seaboard Air Line and the Atlantic Coast Line merged to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (who later merged with the Chessie System in the 1980s to form CSX). The mergers brought all of the track under a single owner and led to consolidation of the two routes and abandonment of redundant trackage. This included the SAL&#x27;s original route through downtown Sarasota (which was removed in 1968), the ACL&#x27;s tracks between Bradenton and Matoaka, and the consolidation of the east–west parallel track through Fruitville to a single track (using the former SAL track).
After taking over the line in 1987, Seminole Gulf continued to carry the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus to their Venice headquarters up until 1990, when the circus relocated their headquarters to Tampa. The circus relocated to Tampa mainly due to the fact that the Venice segment of the rail line could no longer support their rail equipment due to the rough condition of the track. As previously mentioned, the line was abandoned from Venice to Palmer Ranch in 2004 due to decreased demand and the heavily deteriorated condition of the tracks and bridges. The track from Palmer Ranch to central Sarasota was abandoned in 2019.

<text>The Transparent Factory is a car factory and exhibition space in Dresden, Germany owned by German carmaker Volkswagen and designed by architect Gunter Henn. It originally opened in 2002, producing the Volkswagen Phaeton until 2016. As of 2017 it produced the electric version of the Golf, and since 2021 it has built ID3s.

==Meaning==
The original German name is Gläserne Manufaktur (meaning factory made of glass). Both the German and English names are a word play on the double meaning of &quot;transparent&quot; and &quot;glassy&quot;, referring to both optical transparency and transparency of the production process. It is .93 miles (1.5 kilometres) long.

==Car factory==
The factory originally assembled Volkswagen&#x27;s luxury sedan, the Phaeton. It used 60,000 magnets in its fully automated assembly line. Spare capacity was also used to build Bentley Continental Flying Spur vehicles destined for the European market until 2006, when all work was transferred to Bentley&#x27;s plant in Crewe, England. Production of the Bentley Flying Spur resumed in late 2013. The factory only handled final assembly. Operations such as stamping and welding and the painting of the steel bodies took place in Zwickau. Painted bodies arrived at the factory by truck. The other 1200 parts and 34 preassembled components were shipped to a logistics center and are transported to the factory by CarGoTrams that run on Dresden&#x27;s public transport tracks. All vehicle production at the factory ended in March 2016, before restarting again in 2017. The Volkswagen ID.3 is produced here since 2021, sharing production with the Zwickau-Mosel Plant.

==Location==
The Transparent Factory is situated in the city center of Dresden, an 800-year-old baroque city known for its arts and craftsmanship. It stands in a corner of the Großer Garten, where a convention center was located before the Second World War. The factory&#x27;s walls are made almost completely of glass. Its floors are covered entirely in Canadian maple. Its visitor-friendly layout was designed to accommodate up to 250 tourists per day. There are no smokestacks, no loud noises, and no toxic byproducts. Volkswagen planted 350 trees on the grounds.

==Current visitor experience==
Visitors can test drive VW electric vehicles for 30 minutes, take a virtual tour of Dresden and look at various exhibits relating to VW&#x27;s electric and hybrid technologies.

==Previous visitor experience==
The &quot;Gläserne Manufaktur&quot; also provided visitors with a series of educational attractions relating to the VW Phaeton. The attractions, designed by BRC Imagination Arts, include Vision World, a multimedia &quot;global theater&quot; that allows visitors to take the pulse of the planet in real time; a Virtual Test drive, featuring a real VW Phaeton combined with motion base technology and computer-generated scenery; a computer-based Car Configurator that enables visitors to design the VW Phaeton of their dreams; an interactive Techwall explaining the workings of the Phaeton&#x27;s infotainment system; a Virtual Production Tour; and a media-enhanced Delivery Experience for customers taking possession of new vehicles.

The German TV channel ZDF occasionally filmed a philosophical panel discussion in the Transparent Factory, &quot;Das Philosophische Quartett&quot; (The Philosophical Quartet).

To stop birds from flying into the glass, an outdoor speaker system emulates bird vocalisations marking the territory as &quot;taken&quot;.

==Future==
The factory is to be renovated to enable it to produce luxury and electric cars.

<doc id="1252792" wikidata="Q1059232" url="?curid=1252792" title="Chaise longue">
<text>A chaise longue (; , &quot;long chair&quot;) is an upholstered sofa in the shape of a chair that is long enough to support the legs of the sitter.

In modern French, the term &quot;chaise longue&quot; refers to any long reclining chair, such as a deckchair.

In English, the term &quot;chaise longue&quot; is sometimes written as chaise lounge and pronounced , a folk etymology replacement of part of the original French term with the unrelated English word . When English speakers imported a new kind of sofa from France in the late 1700s, they transformed the name &#x27;chaise longue&#x27; (&quot;long chair&quot;) into &#x27;chaise lounge&#x27;—since &#x27;lounge&#x27; is an English word spelled with the same letters and lounging is something one can do on a &quot;chaise longue.&quot; This variant has been documented in British texts since at least 1811 and in American texts since 1824.

==Origins==
The modern chaise longue was first popularised during the 16th century in France. They were created by French furniture craftsmen for the rich to rest without the need to retire to the bedroom. It was during the Rococo period that the chaise longue became the symbol of social status and only the rarest and most expensive materials were used in their construction. Today, the chaise longue is considered a luxury item for the modern home. They are often used to complement a home&#x27;s décor, such as living or reading rooms, or as stylish boudoir chairs for bedroom seating.

* (French: &#x27;Broken duchess&#x27;): this word is used when the chaise longue is divided into two parts: the chair and a long footstool, or two chairs with a stool in between them. The origin of the name is unknown.
* : a récamier has two raised ends and nothing on the long sides. It is sometimes associated with French Empire (neo-classical) style. It is named after French society hostess Madame Récamier (1777–1849), who posed elegantly on a couch of this kind for a portrait painted in 1800 by Jacques-Louis David. The shape of the récamier is similar to a traditional (boat bed) but made for the drawing room, not the bedroom.
* : a méridienne has a high headrest and a lower footrest, joined by a sloping piece. Whether or not they have anything at the foot end, méridiennes are asymmetrical daybeds. They were popular in the grand houses of France in the early 19th century. Its name is based on its typical use: rest in the middle of the day when the sun is near the meridian.

==Psychoanalysis==

The chaise longue has traditionally been associated with psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud initiated using the chaise longue for this purpose, the idea being that the patient would recline on a couch, with the analyst seated beyond the head of the couch, so that the client would not see the analyst. Reclining and not having to face the analyst was thought to be disinhibiting and encouraging free association. When Freud began to use the chaise longue, Viennese considered it daring to recline on a chaise in the presence of non-intimates. Freud&#x27;s chaise longue, given to him by a patient, may be seen today at the Freud Museum in London. 

Today, psychoanalysts invite clients to recline on couches in their offices during psychotherapy and may use chaises longues rather than more conventional styles of couches out of tradition. The chaise longue is commonly used as visual shorthand to suggest a generic psychotherapist&#x27;s office in cartoons and other works.

<text>The Crosley Broadcasting Corporation was a radio and television broadcaster founded by radio manufacturing pioneer Powel Crosley Jr. It had a major influence in the early years of radio and television broadcasting, and helped the Voice of America carry its message around the world.

==History==
===Early years===

The company was founded by pioneer radio station operator Powel Crosley and was based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Its flagship station, WLW (AM), was first licensed in March 1922. Most of its broadcast properties adopted call signs with &quot;WLW&quot; as the first three letters. In the 1930s, WLW had an effective power of 500,000 watts, and was the only commercial U.S. AM broadcasting station ever to be permitted to transmit regularly with more than 50,000 watts. The 500,000 watt transmissions were only allowed by the FCC in the &quot;experimental&quot; hours, midnight to 6:00 AM, and the signal was heard in many places, including Europe.

By the 1950s, the company operated a small television network in Ohio and Indiana.

During World War II, Crosley built the Bethany Relay Station in Butler County, Ohio&#x27;s Union Township, one mile west of its transmitter for WLW, for the United States Office of War Information. It operated as many as five shortwave radio stations, using the call signs WLWK, WLWL, WLWO, WLWR, and WLWS. Many of these stations were later incorporated into the Voice of America. Crosley operated the facilities for the government until 1963.

In 1945, the Crosley interests were purchased by Aviation Corporation. The radio and appliance manufacturing arm changed its name to Avco, but the broadcast operations continued to operate under the Crosley name until they adopted the Avco name in 1968.

Crosley (Avco) also owned WLWF, an FM broadcasting station it operated along with its Columbus, Ohio TV outlet WLWC (now WCMH-TV). WLWF went silent in 1953, and Crosley (Avco) returned its license to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In the late 1950s, a construction permit for a new station on WLWF&#x27;s frequency was granted to Taft Broadcasting, owner of WTVN-TV, also in Columbus (now WSYX), which started the station in late 1959 as WTVN-FM (now WLVQ).

===Television network===
From the 1950s through the 1970s, Crosley operated a small television network in which programs were produced at one of its stations and broadcast on the other Crosley stations in the Midwest, and occasionally by non-Crosley stations as well. The company occasionally produced programs picked up for broadcast on either NBC or the DuMont Television Network. Programs which aired nationally included NBC&#x27;s &quot;Midwestern Hayride&quot; (on which Rosemary Clooney often performed) and &quot;Breakfast Party&quot;. Other programs originated on the Crosley network included DuMont&#x27;s &quot;The Paul Dixon Show&quot; and &quot;The Ruth Lyons 50-50 Club&quot;. &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot; started in 1967, originating from WLWD in Dayton, Ohio.

In 1968, Avco, which had just purchased Embassy Pictures, formed an unrelated company called Avco Embassy Television, to syndicate the Embassy film library on TV. Avco Embassy originally syndicated &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;, before the syndicated division of Avco Broadcasting was formed. In 1971, Avco and cartoon producer Hanna-Barbera teamed up for the holiday specials on its network.

In the 1970s, Avco sold all of its broadcasting holdings. In 1975, it sold WLWC-TV in Columbus, WLWI-TV in Indianapolis, WOAI-AM-FM-TV in San Antonio (the AM station was sold to the nascent Clear Channel Communications as the chain&#x27;s second property), and WWDC-AM-FM in Washington D.C. In 1976, it sold WLW and WLWT-TV in Cincinnati, WLWD-TV in Dayton, and its Avco Embassy Television and Avco Embassy Program Sales divisions. In 1977, it sold KYA-AM-FM in San Francisco and WRTH in Wood River/St. Louis.

The closest equivalent to a &quot;successor&quot; to Avco Broadcasting was Multimedia, Inc. Avco sold flagship TV station WLWT to Multimedia, as well as Avco Program Sales in 1976. In December 1995, Gannett (which owned former Crosley station WXIA-TV in Atlanta) acquired Multimedia, Inc., while the respective syndication division was acquired by MCA Universal. By 1997, all of the original Crosley radio and television properties had been sold off by its successor companies, with the exception of WTHR in Indianapolis, which is now owned by Tegna Inc. since they acquired the Dispatch Broadcast Group in 2019.

The deserted ruins of the major Crosley manufacturing facility can still be seen on the west side of I-75, just north of the area where the Cincinnati Museum Center (previously the Union Terminal train station) is currently located and near where Crosley Field once stood. The impressively huge transmission tower and old 50,000-watt transmitter at the Tylersville Road facility near U.S. Route 42 (Reading Rd.), between Dayton and Cincinnati, still exists.

===WLW- call letters===

By the 1970s, the Crosley name had ceased to exist in the memory of most American citizens (as would that of its major successor company, Avco, a decade later), but many of the &quot;WLW-&quot; station call-letters persist.

WCMH-TV used the &quot;WLWC&quot; call letters from its 1949 sign-on until the station was sold to Outlet Broadcasting in 1976. In the 1990s, WCMH entered into an agreement to manage the operations of WWHO in the Columbus market under a &quot;local marketing agreement&quot; (LMA) with Fant Broadcasting, owner of WWHO-TV. Outlet, in turn, owned 20% of Fant. Due to the success of this arrangement, WCMH&#x27;s sister station WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island entered into a similar arrangement to operate Channel 28 in that market, also owned by Fant.

At about the same time, Premier Broadcasting Corporation also announced that it would be using the WLWC call letters for Columbus low-power television station W62BE. Because of the historic and brand value of the WLWC call letters in the Columbus market, Outlet arranged to have the call sign &quot;warehoused&quot; on Channel 28 in Providence, Rhode Island, in order to keep competitors from using them in the Columbus area. Channel 28 applied for and was assigned the WLWC call letters and has used them ever since. Premier&#x27;s television station, now silent, ultimately took the call letters WLWG.

Lima, Ohio, Radio station WBKS used the WLWD call letters when it was branded &quot;Wild 93.9.&quot; The WLWD call letters are familiar in the Lima area since the WDTN signal reaches various portions of the Lima market either over the air or through cable carriage. Today, the WLWD call letters are used by a low-power Daystar station in Springfield, Ohio, which is part of the Dayton, Ohio television market.

The WLWI call letters are used by an AM and FM radio station serving the Montgomery, Alabama radio market.

<doc id="1252795" wikidata="Q880013" url="?curid=1252795" title="Ismaning radio transmitter">
<text>The Transmitter Ismaning was a large radio transmitting station near Ismaning, Bavaria, Germany. It was inaugurated in 1932. From 1932 to 1934 this transmitter (which replaced the Stadelheim Transmitter at Munich-Stadelheim) used a T-antenna as transmitting antenna, which was spun between two free-standing wooden lattice towers, which were 240 metres apart. As this antenna had an unfavourable vertical radiation pattern, which produced much skywave resulting in a too small fading-free reception area at night, in 1934 a new antenna was installed. Therefore, one of the towers was dismantled and rebuilt on a wooden lattice base. While this work took place, an L-Antenna was used, which was spun between the other tower and a small auxiliary wooden tower. It became defunct in 1977 and was destroyed in 1983.

==Wooden broadcasting tower==

After completion of the new wood tower, which was 156 metres high without the arms carrying the antenna (with these arms its height amounted to 163 metres), the second wood tower was dismantled and rebuilt in 1935 at Nuremberg-Kleinreuth, where it served until 1961 as a transmission tower for medium wave. The wood tower at Ismaning carried a dipole antenna, whose point of feeding was at 120 metres height. From this point of feeding, several wires ran to the arms on the tower top and to fastening spots at a height of 80 metres. At this height a differential transformer was installed in a small housing inside the tower; its task was to prevent the drain of the radiated high frequency over the feeder. This antenna, developed by the company Lorenz, was called &quot;Höhendipol&quot;. It was one for the transmitter frequency of 740 kHz, which was used from 1934 to 1950, optimized fading-reducing transmitting antenna. However, according to the wave plan of Copenhagen, which required directional radiation at night times, it could only be used during daylight hours after 1950.
In 1969 this antenna was dismantled after a new medium wave transmitting mast was built. Between 1969 and 1977 the wood tower was used for carrying transmitting antennas for FM broadcasting. In 1977 a guyed steel framework mast took over this function, so the wood tower became defunct in 1977.
The state of the tower worsened more and more after 1977, and it seemed to be impossible to repair this tower, which was nicknamed &quot;Bavarian Eiffel Tower,&quot; and which was already under protection as a monument.
On March 16, 1983 it was blown up.
Its concrete foundations and the tuning house, which once stood under the tower, can still be seen today.

==Services transmitted==

===Bavarian Broadcasting Company===
The transmission facility Ismaning is used for transmitting the first program of the Bavarian Broadcasting Company on the medium wave frequency 801 kHz (transmission power 600 kilowatts until 1994, now 100 kilowatts) and for all programmes of the Bavarian Broadcasting company in the FM range. Until 1994 there was also a transmitter of the American Forces Network (AFN), with its AFN Munich station, at Ismaning.

For the AM transmissions a guyed steel tube mast is used. This mast is insulated from the ground and is designed as a fading reducing transmission aerial with multiple feeding. Therefore, it is separated at 56-metre and 117-metre heights by insulators.

Restrictions of the waveplan of Geneva required a minimum of radiation in direction Northeast, in order to reduce interferences of the transmitter Saint Petersburg, Russia, on the same frequency, if transmission power is 600 kilowatts at night. Therefore, in 1978 a guyed steel-framework mast, which is insulated against ground, was built near the mast upper mentioned. Because a power reduction toward northeast is not necessary with a transmission power of 100 kilowatts, this mast is now obsolete, but it is still there.

As back-up aerial a , guyed steel framework mast was built in 1947 close to the transmitter building. This mast, which was originally used for transmitting the program of AFN was until 1969 126 metres high and carried from 1958 to 1969 aerials for FM transmissions.

Restriction by the waveplan of Copenhagen had the result, that the mediumwave transmitter of the Bavarian Broadcasting Company had to work with directional radiation with minimum toward Northeast after 1951 at nighttime. This type of radiation was not possible with the aerial on the wood framework tower and a directional aerial consisting of two insulated guyed radio masts with a height of 94 metres had to be built.

This aerial was until 1969 for transmitting the program of the Bavarian broadcasting company during nighttime in service. After 1969 it was used until its shutdown in 1994 for transmitting the program of AFN on 1107 kHz. In difference to the time before 1969 omnidirectional radiation was used. One mast was used and the other one was a spare unit.

As aerials for shortwave transmissions of the Bavarian broadcasting company there are a dipole aerial, built in 1976, which hangs on two guyed steelframework masts with a height of 35 metres and a winkle dipole which hangs on three guyed steel framework masts with a height of 55 metres. The winkle dipole aerial went in service in 1980.

For FM broadcasting transmission, there is a silvery grey guyed steel framework mast with dipol arrays on its top near the station building. This mast, which was built in 1977, has a height of 100 metres and is the only mast at the transmitter Ismaning, which is grounded.

===Voice of America===
The Voice of America ran until 1994 near the station of the Bavarian Broadcasting company a large shortwave transmission facility, which has nowadays has been scrapped The medium wave transmission facility of the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty operated by the International Broadcasting Bureau was shut down in March 2005. It consists of four guyed steel framework masts, which are insulated against ground. These masts were built in 1949 and renovated in the 1990s and allow the powered aerial to transmit in various directions.

In 2010, a new guyed mast for FM broadcasting was built.

<text>Cyclodextrins are a family of cyclic oligosaccharides, consisting of a macrocyclic ring of glucose subunits joined by α-1,4 glycosidic bonds. Cyclodextrins are produced from starch by enzymatic conversion. They are used in food, pharmaceutical, drug delivery, and chemical industries, as well as agriculture and environmental engineering.

Cyclodextrins are composed of 5 or more α-D-glucopyranoside units linked 1-&gt;4, as in amylose (a fragment of starch). Typical cyclodextrins contain a number of glucose monomers ranging from six to eight units in a ring, creating a cone shape:

* α (alpha)-cyclodextrin: 6 glucose subunits
* β (beta)-cyclodextrin: 7 glucose subunits
* γ (gamma)-cyclodextrin: 8 glucose subunits

The largest well-characterized cyclodextrin contains 32 1,4-anhydroglucopyranoside units. Poorly-characterized mixtures, containing at least 150-membered cyclic oligosaccharides are also known.

==Applications==
===Drug delivery===
Cyclodextrins are ingredients in more than 30 different approved medicines. With a hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic exterior, cyclodextrins form complexes with hydrophobic compounds. Alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrin are all generally recognized as safe by the U.S. FDA. They have been applied for delivery of a variety of drugs, including hydrocortisone, prostaglandin, nitroglycerin, itraconazole, chloramphenicol. The cyclodextrin confers solubility and stability to these drugs. The inclusion compounds of cyclodextrins with hydrophobic molecules are able to penetrate body tissues, these can be used to release biologically active compounds under specific conditions. In most cases the mechanism of controlled degradation of such complexes is based on pH change of water solutions, leading to the loss of hydrogen or ionic bonds between the host and the guest molecules. Alternative means for the disruption of the complexes take advantage of heating or action of enzymes able to cleave α-1,4 linkages between glucose monomers. Cyclodextrins were also shown to enhance mucosal penetration of drugs.

===Chromatography===
β-cyclodextrins are used to produce stationary phase media for HPLC separations.

===Other===
Cyclodextrins bind fragrances. Such devices are capable of releasing fragrances when heated, such as by ironing, body heat, or a dryer. A common application is a typical &#x27;dryer sheet&#x27;. They are also the main ingredient in Febreze, which claims that the β-cyclodextrins &quot;trap&quot; odor-causing compounds, thereby reducing the odor.

Cyclodextrins are also used to produce alcohol powder by encapsulating ethanol. The powder produces an alcoholic beverage when mixed with water, or can also be taken in a pill. The approval of powdered alcohol by the FDA in 2014 was met with wide-spread bans and backlash in the United States.

== Structure ==
Typical cyclodextrins are constituted by 6-8 glucopyranoside units. These subunits are linked by 1,4 glycosidic bonds. The cyclodextrins have toroidal shapes, with the larger and the smaller openings of the toroid exposing to the solvent secondary and primary hydroxyl groups respectively. Because of this arrangement, the interior of the toroids is considerably less hydrophilic than the aqueous environment and thus able to host hydrophobic molecules. In contrast, the exterior is sufficiently hydrophilic to impart cyclodextrins (or their complexes) water solubility. They are not soluble in typical organic solvents.

==Synthesis==
Cyclodextrins are prepared by enzymatic treatment of starch. Commonly cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) is employed along with α-amylase. First starch is liquified either by heat treatment or using α-amylase, then CGTase is added for the enzymatic conversion. CGTases produce mixtures of cyclodextrins, thus the product of the conversion results in a mixture of the three main types of cyclic molecules, in ratios that are strictly dependent on the enzyme used: each CGTase has its own characteristic α:β:γ synthesis ratio. Purification of the three types of cyclodextrins takes advantage of the different water solubility of the molecules: β-CD which is poorly water-soluble (18.5 g/L or 16.3 mM at 25 °C) can be easily retrieved through crystallization while the more soluble α- and γ-CDs (145 and 232 g/L respectively) are usually purified by means of expensive and time consuming chromatography techniques. As an alternative a &quot;complexing agent&quot; can be added during the enzymatic conversion step: such agents (usually organic solvents like toluene, acetone or ethanol) form a complex with the desired cyclodextrin which subsequently precipitates. The complex formation drives the conversion of starch towards the synthesis of the precipitated cyclodextrin, thus enriching its content in the final mixture of products. Wacker Chemie AG uses dedicated enzymes, that can produce alpha-, beta- or gamma-cyclodextrin specifically. This is very valuable especially for the food industry, as only alpha- and gamma-cyclodextrin can be consumed without a daily intake limit.

===Derivatives===
Interest in cyclodextrins is enhanced because their host–guest behavior can be manipulated by chemical modification of the hydroxyl groups. O-Methylation and acetylation are typical conversions. Propylene oxide gives hydroxypropylated derivatives. The primary alcohols can be tosylated. The degree of derivatization is an adjustable, i.e. full methylation vs partial.

Both β-cyclodextrin and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) remove cholesterol from cultured cells. The methylated form MβCD was found to be more efficient than β-cyclodextrin. The water-soluble MβCD is known to form soluble inclusion complexes with cholesterol, thereby enhancing its solubility in aqueous solution. MβCD is employed for the preparation of cholesterol-free products: the bulky and hydrophobic cholesterol molecule is easily lodged inside cyclodextrin rings. MβCD is also employed in research to disrupt lipid rafts by removing cholesterol from membranes.

Due to the covalent attachment of thiol groups to cyclodextrins high mucoadhesive properties can be introduced as these thiolated oligomers (&quot;thiomers&quot;) are capable of forming disulfide bonds with cysteine-rich subdomains of mucus glycoproteins. The gastrointestinal and ocular residence time of thiolated cyclodextrins is therefore substantially prolonged. Furthermore, thiolated cyclodextrins are actively taken up by target cells releasing their payload into the cytoplasma. The cellular uptake of various model drugs, for instance, was up to 20-fold improved by using thiolated α-cyclodextrin as carrier system.

==Research==
In supramolecular chemistry, cyclodextrins are precursors to mechanically interlocked molecular architectures, such as rotaxanes and catenanes. Illustrative, α-cyclodextrin form second-sphere coordination complex with tetrabromoaurate anion ([AuBr4]-).

β-Cyclodextrin complexes with certain carotenoid food colorants have been shown to intensify color, increase water solubility and improve light stability.

Complexes formed between β-cyclodextrin and adamantane derivatives have been used to make self-healing materials, such as hydrogels and low-friction surfaces.

Using the host-guest interaction between β-Cyclodextrin and Perfluorohexane, acoustically active nanoparticles were created. These nanoparticles were combined with histotripsy, leading to the development of Nanoparticle-Mediated Histotripsy (NMH). NMH addresses limitations of traditional histotripsy, such as non-selectivity and the requirement for high pressure. This promising new method has potential applications in cell ablation for various purposes, including cancer treatment.

==History==

Cyclodextrins were called &quot;cellulosine&quot; when first described by A. Villiers in 1891. Soon after, F. Schardinger identified the three naturally occurring cyclodextrins: α, β, and γ, referred to as &quot;Schardinger sugars&quot;. For 25 years, between 1911 and 1935, Hans Pringsheim in Germany was the leading researcher in this area, demonstrating that cyclodextrins formed stable aqueous complexes with many other chemicals. By the mid-1970s, each of the natural cyclodextrins had been structurally and chemically characterized and many more complexes had been studied. Since the 1970s, extensive work has been conducted by Szejtli and others exploring encapsulation by cyclodextrins and their derivatives for industrial and pharmacologic applications. Among the processes used for complexation, the kneading process seems to be one of the best.

==Safety==
Cyclodextrins are of wide interest in part because they appear nontoxic in animal studies. The LD50 (oral, rats) is on the order of grams per kilogram.
Nevertheless, attempts to use β-Cyclodextrin for the prevention of atherosclerosis, age-related lipofuscin accumulation and obesity encounter an obstacle in the form of damage to the auditory nerve and
nephrotoxic effect.

<text>Ismaning () is a municipality in Bavaria, Germany, located near Munich.

== Geography ==
In 2016 it had 16,770 inhabitants. The town is located about seven kilometers northeast of Munich on the right high bank of the Isar River that flows into the Danube. Near Ismaning there is a large broadcasting facility called Transmitter Ismaning. The river Seebach running through the centre of the town features many different types of freshwater fish. 

== History ==
The year 809 saw the first documentary mention. 1319 there was a sale of the villages of Ismaning, Unterföhring, Oberföhring, Englschalking and Daglfing to the Hochstift Freising by the Duke of Bavaria and later Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian in exchange for &quot;a hundred March lotrings silver&quot;. This created the county on the Yserrain which existed until 1802. Then Ismaning became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. Ismaning Palace was seat of the Beauharnais family until 1851 and is now seat of the town hall.

== Economy and Infrastructure ==

=== Economy ===
Originally an agricultural community, Ismaning has been known as an important media location since the mid-1990s. The Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Ismaning transmitter has been located to the northeast of the village since 1932. To the south is the media park with &quot;Sport1 Medien AG&quot; (Sport1), &quot;Gong-Verlag&quot;, &quot;Mainstream Media AG&quot; (Heimatkanal) and the private radio station &quot;Antenne Bayern&quot;. 

=== Traffic ===
Due to its location near Munich, Ismaning is well connected. Ismaning is located on the railroad line &quot;Munich East-Munich Airport&quot;, the Federal highway 99, the Federal roads B 471, B 388 and B 301 as well as on the State road 2053 (Freising-Ismaning-Unterföhring-Munich).

The S8 line of the Munich S-Bahn connects Ismaning with Munich every 20 minutes.

== Famous buildings ==
This center of Ismaning is characterized by the Catholic parish church of St. Johann Baptist. It is located to the south of Ismaning Palace (with castle park and former farm buildings), which was reconstructed by Leo von Klenze.

<doc id="1252814" wikidata="Q5249446" url="?curid=1252814" title="Declaration of Sports">
<text>The Declaration of Sports (also known as the Book of Sports) was a declaration of James I of England issued just for Lancashire in 1617, nationally in 1618, and reissued by Charles I in 1633. It listed the sports and recreations that were permitted on Sundays and other holy days.

==Issue under James I==
It was originally issued in consultation with Thomas Morton, bishop of Chester, to resolve a dispute in Lancashire between the Puritans and the gentry (many of whom were Roman Catholics). The initial declaration was just for Lancashire, but in 1618, James made the declaration national. The 1618 declaration had largely the same main text as the 1617 version, but with an additional paragraph at the beginning explaining that the king had decided to make the declaration applicable to the whole of England. James transmitted orders to the clergy of the whole of England to read the declaration from the pulpit, but encountering strong opposition he withdrew his command.

The declaration listed archery, dancing, &quot;leaping, vaulting, or any other such harmless recreation&quot; as permissible sports, together with &quot;May-games, Whitsun-ales and Morris-dances, and the setting up of May-poles&quot;. Also allowed: &quot;women shall have leave to carry rushes to the church for the decorating of it, according to their old custom.&quot;
Amongst the activities that were prohibited were bear- and bull-baiting, &quot;interludes&quot; and bowling.

On the one hand, the declaration rebuked Puritans and other &quot;precise persons&quot;, and was issued to counteract the growing Puritan calls for strict abstinence on the Christian Sabbath (Sabbatarianism). On the other, it condemned Catholics and others who did not attend church services in their parish, as the declaration specified that only people who had first attended divine service were entitled to participate in recreations afterward.

==Re-issue under Charles I==
The declaration was reissued by Charles I on 18 October 1633, as &quot;The King&#x27;s Majesty&#x27;s declaration to his subjects concerning lawful sports to be used&quot;. It was claimed by William Prynne that the new declaration was written by Charles&#x27; new Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, but Laud denied this and there is only evidence that he supported and facilitated the reissue. Moreover, the 1633 declaration has the same main text as the 1617 and 1618 declarations of King James, with the primary differences an additional introduction and conclusion adding wakes and ales (countryside festivals) to the list of sanctioned recreations. Charles ordered that any minister who refused to read it would be deprived of position. As the Puritans gained power in Parliament in the lead-up to the English Civil War, hostility to the &quot;Book of Sports&quot; grew. Attempts to enforce the declaration came to an end with the fall of Archbishop Laud in 1640, and Parliament ordered the book publicly burned in 1643, two years before Laud was executed.

<text>Vacas (English: &quot;Cows&quot;) is a 1991 Spanish film, written and directed by Julio Médem. The film stars Carmelo Gómez, Emma Suárez, Ana Torrent, and Karra Elejalde. An eerie family saga set in rural Basque Country, the cryptic film follows the intertwined story of three generations of two families from 1875 to 1936. It was Médem&#x27;s first film and for it he won the 1993 Goya Award as Best New Director.

==Plot==

Fighting in the trenches of Biscay in 1875 during the Third Carlist War, Carmelo Mendiluze, an army sergeant, learns from a young errand boy named Ilegorri that Manuel Iriguíbel, his neighbor from his native village, has joined their exhausted battalion. Eager for news of his child&#x27;s birth, Carmelo befriends the inexperienced soldier whose reputation as an expert aizcolari (competition log cutter) cannot conceal his apprehension and fear of armed combat. Panicking under fire, Manuel drops to the ground and smears himself with blood gushing hot from the neck of his mortally wounded neighbor, Mendiluze. When the battle is over, Manuel crawls out from a cartload of the dead, naked bodies as he is transported away from the front lines. Nobody has seen his escape, except a curious, solitary cow.

Thirty years later, in 1905 in rural Guipúzcoa, a lingering animosity has continued between the Mendiluze and Iriguíbel families. Manuel, now an old man, is still regarded as a coward; he spends his time painting the family&#x27;s cows watched over by his three granddaughters, the offspring of his son Ignacio Iriguíbel and his wife Madalen. Ignacio and Carmelo&#x27;s son, Juan Mendiluze, have maintained family traditions by honing their skills as aizcolari. Despite the strained relations between the neighbors, the destinies of the two families are fatefully interconnected. Juan&#x27;s sister, Catalina, cannot conceal her romantic interest for Ignacio as she furtively watches him practice cutting logs in the woods - an attraction that proves to be mutual through Ignacio&#x27;s playful attempts to catch her already piqued attention. Paulina, the Mendiluze widow, warns her daughter that her interest for Ignacio Iriguíbel will bring the downfall of the Mendiluze family. In an attempt to capitalize from the rivalry between the two families, Ilegorri, now a grown man, arranges a waged competition between Ignacio and Juan. Ignacio wins and his career as an aizcolari contender is launched. Catalina and Ignacio start a secret affair.

Ten years later, in the spring of 1915, Ignacio returns home after traveling to national competitions. He now enjoys fame and success. Although Ignacio takes care of his family farm, he neglects Madalen, his wife. He is promptly reunited with Catalina, and they have a ten-year-old son. After the death of their mother, the relationship between the bitter Juan and Catalina is increasingly strained. Juan, still a bachelor, is more obsessed and delusional in his incestuous feelings for his sister. Catalina, afraid of him, wants to escape to America with Ignacio. A close childhood friendship develops between Peru, Catalina and Ignacio&#x27;s ten-year-old illegitimate son, and his half-sister Cristina; they wander amidst the mountain forest under the supervision of their limp and old grandfather, Manuel. Eventually the boy&#x27;s parents elope to America and take him with them.

In the summer of 1936, Peru has left his family behind, coming back to Guipúzcoa, as a photojournalist reporting on the Spanish Civil War. The Mendiluze farmhouse is empty. Juan, his uncle, has put on his Carlist red beret, joining the Nationalists. Peru is reunited with Cristina, his half-sister and childhood sweetheart. He stays at the Iriguíbel&#x27;s farm. Cristina has had a relationship with Lucas, Iligorri&#x27;s son. She shows Peru the last paintings made by their grandfather. The Spanish Civil War comes to the village. The men try to find refuge in the forest when the Nationalists come. Peru and Cristina follow them and are joined by Lucas, who offers to protect them. Lucas is killed and Peru is captured with the surviving men of the region. The men are executed but Peru is spared thanks to the intervention of Juan who recognizes him as his nephew. Reunited with Cristina, Peru and Cristina flee to the French frontier.

==Cast==
Director Julio Médem illustrates the cyclical nature of the unresolved strife and vacillating alliance between the two rival families in the film by using the same actor to portray generations of characters. The actor Carmelo Gómez&#x27;s plays the cowardly Manuel Iriguíbel in the Carlist Wars, Manuel&#x27;s son Ignacio in 1905, and eventually, the matured photographer, Peru Mendiluze, who returns the Basque region at the onset of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Kandido Uranga plays first the doomed Carmelo Mendiluze in 1875 and then Carmelo&#x27;s obsessive and haunted son Juan in the other three segments of the film. Karra Elejade plays both Ilegorri and Ilegorri&#x27;s son Lucas.

Médem cast Carmelo Gómez in his next two films: &quot;La ardilla roja&quot; (The Red Squirrel), 1993) and &quot;Tierra&quot; (Earth), 1996) pairing him in both cases with Emma Suárez
like here in &quot;Vacas&quot;.

==Overview==
Usually categorized as rural drama, the film narrates the lives of two Basque families covering the years 1875–1936, which historically were the unstable and bloody years from the Third Carlist War to the Spanish Civil War. To help the non-Spanish viewer understand the history depicted in the film: the Basques allied themselves initially with the Carlists (who were right-wing) but later with the Spanish Republic (who were left-wing) because, in each case, they were promised local autonomy.

Small segments of &quot;Vacas&quot; were used by Medem in his documentary film &quot;La pelota vasca&quot; to illustrate the Carlist Wars.

==Reception==
&quot;Vacas&quot; was well received and proved an auspicious debut for Julio Médem, the director. Critics hailed Médem&#x27;s craftsmanship and ability to marry the right images with his near mythic story lines. It was very successful and won the Goya Award of the Spanish academy for best new director and prizes in the festivals of Tokyo, Turin and Alexandria.

==Analysis==
The aesthetics of the movie established strongly Médem&#x27;s so-called &quot;dreamy style&quot; (which ironically can be very nightmarish). His expressionist values would contrast rapidly with a time period in the Spanish cinema when the influences from the American movies would multiply (i.e. Alejandro Amenábar). The structure of &quot;Vacas&quot; is made up of concentric circles: European Style—Spanish History—Basque culture—A village—Two houses of that village and, overseeing them all, the cows. The narrative is also very concentric; the film uses a continuous recycling recourse (i.e. the same actors play the three generations, which can be slightly confusing). Médem would also use a loop-like approach in his film &quot;Los amantes del círculo polar&quot;.

Médem subverts the conventions of the family saga by replacing the human subjectivity of conventional melodrama and historical epics with a diffidence about life and death that is expressed through the uninterested gaze of the cows. The title of the film refers to the passive omnipresence of cows. The political and social climate of the Basque country of Spain is constantly in flux, yet the cows of the region are steadfast and calm, observing the unusual changing human culture without reaction. Instead of a society that is traditionally presented as oppressed and belittle by exterior forces, &quot;Vacas&quot; presents the Basque people as a race that, in petty rivalries, civil war and incest, has consumed itself from within. Most characters wish for nothing more than to escape the supposed idyll of the Basque Country, though those who do are fated to return and suffer the consequences of inescapable roots and blood ties. Médem further illustrates the cyclical nature of the unresolved strife and vacillating alliance by using the same actor to portray generations of characters. Instead of typifying the beauty of the land, the mist of the basque Valley create a malignant atmosphere that enshrouds the protagonists of &quot;Vacas&quot;, stimulating and manifesting their latent desires and urges.

==DVD release==
The film was released on DVD on 29 January 2002 in the U.S. by Vanguard Cinema and in Spain by Sogepaq Video in 2002(Universal Pictures Home Entertainment) and 2007(20th Century Fox Home Entertainment and in Blu-ray in Spain on March 16, 2016, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment(via Video Mercury Films, who bought Sogepaq/Sogetel library in 2009) Is released previous in VHS by C.B. Films in Spain in 1992 . The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.

<text>Richard Reynolds, O.Ss.S (1492 – 4 May 1535) was an English Bridgettine monk executed in London for refusing the Oath of Supremacy to King Henry VIII of England. He was canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970, among the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.

==Life==
Richard Reynolds was a Bridgettine monk of the Syon Abbey, founded in Twickenham by Henry V. He was born in Devon in 1492, educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and joined the Abbey in 1513. Reginald Pole is quoted as saying that Reynolds was the only English monk well-versed in the three principal languages of Latin, Greek and Hebrew.

Dom Hamilton is of the opinion that as Reynolds was the most renowned spiritual counsellor of the Syon community, he would have likely been consulted by Elizabeth Barton, the Holy Maid of Kent, who had been executed at Tyburn almost a year prior for speaking out against the king&#x27;s marriage to Anne Boleyn. Reynolds had previously arranged a meeting between Elizabeth Barton and Thomas More. It was his connection to Barton that particularly compromised Reynolds in the view of the Crown officers.

Reynolds was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London around the middle of April 1535, along with the Carthusian priors John Houghton, Robert Lawrence and Augustine Webster (a monk of Sheen Priory in Richmond). All four were tried for the denial of the royal supremacy.

Against Reynolds, there was the additional charge of attempting to dissuade people from submitting to the king&#x27;s authority. A witness claimed that Reynolds had stated that the &quot;Dowager Princess&quot; (Queen Catherine) was the true queen. Reynolds denied that he had declared an opinion against the king, except in confession, as compelled thereto. The practice of suborning penitents to accuse their confessors was in vogue at that time.

All four were executed on 4 May 1535 by drawing and quartering at Tyburn Tree in London after being dragged through the streets. Also convicted of treason for speaking against the King&#x27;s marriage to Anne Boleyn, and martyred with them on that day, was John Haile, the parish priest of Isleworth where Syon Abbey lay. The quarters of the body of Reynolds – the first man to refuse the oath – were chopped to pieces and hung in different parts of London, including the gate of Syon Abbey.

According to &quot;The Life of Sir Thomas More&quot;, by William Roper, More witnessed Reynolds and his three companions going to execution from his window in the Tower of London. Roper reports the event thus: &quot;As Sir Thomas More in the Tower chanced on a time, looking out of his window, to behold one Master Reynolds, a religious, learned, and virtuous father of Sion and three monks of the Charterhouse, for the matters of the matrimony and Supremacy, going out of the Tower to execution - he, as one longing in that journey to have accompanied them, said unto my wife, then standing besides him: &#x27;Lo, dost thou not see, Meg, that these blessed fathers be now as cheerfully going to their deaths as bridegrooms to their marriage? Wherefore thereby mayst thou see, mine own good daughter, what a great difference there is between such as have in effect spent all their days in a strait, hard, penitential, and painful life religiously, and such as have in the world, like worldly wretches, as thy poor father hath done, consumed all their time in pleasure and ease licentiously. For God, considering their long-continued life in most sore and grievous penance, will no longer suffer them to remain here in this vale of misery and iniquity, but speedily hence taketh them to the fruition of his everlasting deity.&#x27;&quot;

According to the book &quot;The Angel of Syon&quot;, Reynolds said before his execution, &quot;... after a sharp breakfast, they should have a sweet supper.&quot; Coincidentally, Blessed John Sugar is recorded having said the same phrase before his execution in 1604, but the author of the book, Dom Adam Hamilton, is uncertain if it originated with Reynolds.

==Veneration==
He was beatified in 1886 and canonised by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales on 25 October 1970. His feast day is 4 May.

There is a statue commemorating Saint Richard Reynolds in Our Lady of Sorrows and St Bridget Roman Catholic Church, Isleworth.

A painting of the martyr is housed in the Church of St. Bridget in Rome.

There is a stained glass window of the martyr in St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church in Ely Place. He is the figure on the right.

A section of the dissolved Syon Abbey is considered a relic of Reynolds, due to the fact that it supported the quartered remains of the martyr after his execution. The nuns of the Abbey took this section after the dissolution.

He is the patron of St Richard Reynolds Catholic College in Twickenham. The college is the federation of St Richard Reynolds Catholic High School and the new St Richard Reynolds Catholic Primary School for pupils aged 4 – 18.

<text>Rayonnoceras is a genus of extinct cephalopods that lived around 325 million years ago during the Carboniferous. Although they resemble earlier actinocerids they are now thought to belong to the Pseudorthocerida

&quot;Rayonnoceras&quot; is characterized by large straight shells with a large subcentral siphuncle composed of subglobular segments, as for the family. The endosiphuncular canal system is well developed and most chambers are filled with organic deposits. Some shells have transverse striae, others are smooth. As with earlier actinocerids, &quot;Rayonnoceras&quot; has a canal system within the siphuncle that includes a narrow opening, the parispatium, between the internal deposits and inner wall of the connecting ring. It differs from the earlier actinocerids in having a bullet-like apex with a cicatrix and a long first chamber, characteristic of pseuorthocerids, rather than a blunt apex and short first chamber characteristic of true actinocerids. 
Orientation during life was horizontal. Cameral deposits, more concentrated in the apical part of the shell, are thought to have acted as ballast that compensated for the weight of the animal in the forward part. In life &quot;Rayonnoceras&quot; was probably a bottom dweller that spent most of its time stationary, waiting in ambush for prey.

&quot;Rayonnoceras&quot; was among the last of the actinocerid-mimics, which finally died out in the Carboniferous.

In 2003 a specimen of &quot;Rayonnoceras solidiforme&quot; eight feet long (2.4m) was found in Arkansas. It is believed to be the largest of its kind ever found and is housed at the University of Arkansas Museum.

<doc id="1252832" wikidata="Q161148" url="?curid=1252832" title="Ornithogalum">
<text>Ornithogalum is a genus of perennial plants mostly native to southern Europe and southern Africa belonging to the family Asparagaceae. Some species are native to other areas such as the Caucasus. Some species are classified as noxious invasive weeds in some portions of North America. Growing from a bulb, species have linear basal leaves and a slender stalk, up to 30 cm tall, bearing clusters of typically white star-shaped flowers, often striped with green. The common name of the genus, star-of-Bethlehem, is based on its star-shaped flowers, after the Star of Bethlehem that appears in the biblical account of the birth of Jesus. The number of species has varied considerably, depending on authority, from 50 to 300.

== Description ==
&quot;Ornithogalum&quot; species are perennial bulbous geophytes with basal leaves. &quot;Sensu lato&quot;, the genus has the characteristics of the tribe Ornithogaleae as a whole, since the tribe is monotypic in that sense. &quot;Sensu stricto&quot;, the genus is characterised by long linear to oblong-lanceolate (lance-shaped) leaves, sometimes with a white longitudinal band on the adaxial (upper) side, an inflorescence that is corymbose or pseudocorymbose, tepals that are white with a longitudinal green band only visible on the abaxial (lower) side, a capsule that is obovate or oblong, and truncate with six noticeable ribs in section and seeds that are globose with a prominently (net-like pattern) testa. The bulbs are ovoid with free or concrescent scales.

The longitudinal band on the leaves is thought to be caused by an interruption of palisade tissue in the central portion of the leaf. This is an apomorphy that was not present in the early lineage of this clade, but is also seen in some &quot;Albuca&quot; species.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Ornithogalum&quot; was originally described by &quot;Linnaeus&quot; in 1753, with 12 species, which he placed in the Hexandria Monogynia (six stamens, one carpel). When Michel Adanson formed the family Liliaceae in 1763, he placed &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; there, where it largely remained till this very large family was dismembered towards the end of the 20th century. Specifically, he included the genus with the onions (now Allioideae).

By the 1870s, as Baker describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. Baker placed &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; in the tribe Scilleae, one of eight tribes into which he divided the Liliaceae. He then further subdivided the genus into seven subgenera. Of those, the first, &quot;Heliocharmos&quot;, corresponds to the modern &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, with 23 species.

Later, in the United Kingdom, Bentham and Hooker published their volume on the Liliaceae in Latin in 1883. They divided the family into 20 tribes and placed &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; in the tribe Scilleae with 19 other genera, and indicated 70 species existed. In the German literature the taxonomic system of Engler completed its classification of the Liliaceae in 1888. He divided the family into 12 subfamilies and subordinate tribes. &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; was then placed in the subfamily Lilioideae and tribe Scilleae together with 21 other genera. The 70 species of &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; were then further divided into six sections, with section &quot;Heliocharmos&quot; corresponding to Baker&#x27;s subgenus.

&quot;Ornithogalum&quot; is one of four genera in the tribe Ornithogaleae, the largest tribe within the subfamily Scilloideae of the Asparagaceae. Historically, it was treated as part of the subfamily Ornithogaloideae of Hyacinthaceae, now obsolete terms. The preferred treatment is to consider the Hyacinthaceae as subfamily Scilloideae of the Asparagaceae. The original subfamilies within Hyacinthaceae became tribes of subfamily Scilloideae. Thus subfamily Ornithogaloideae became tribe Ornithogaleae.

The precise taxonomy of the Ornithogaloideae/Ornithogaleae has been problematic since at least the time of Linnaeus. The Ornithogaloideae were one of four major clades within the Hyacinthaceae. Phylogenetic analysis subsumed all of that subfamily into the genus &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; with about 300 species. This &quot;sensu lato&quot; reduction of Speta&#x27;s 14 genera into one was not widely accepted, though they were polyphyletic, and had a number of problems. (This also had the effect of eliminating &quot;Galtonia&quot; as a genus, under which a number of &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; species are still sold.)

Further analysis with wider sampling (70 compared to 40 taxa) and a third plastid region (matK) revealed the presence of three clades (A, B and C) within Ornithogaleae/&quot;Ornithogalum&quot;. Consequently, a new classification was proposed with three tribes and four genera, &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; corresponding to clade C, placed in tribe Ornithogaleae, but further subdivided into subgenera and sections, with 160 species. &quot;Galtonia&quot; was retained as a taxon, but at the subgenus level. An alternative approach was suggested by combining plastid gene sequences with nuclear DNA sequences, morphology, and biogeography. This supported Manning&#x27;s clade C within which &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; was contained, but the very large subgenus &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; was noted to still be heterogeneous, which they had managed by treating it as seven sections. This study suggested reversing the &quot;sensu lato&quot; (lumping) approach of Manning &quot;et al.&quot;, reverting to separate genera (splitting), thus resurrecting &quot;Galtonia&quot;.

The &quot;sensu stricto&quot; classification of reduces the number of species to 50 as originally proposed by Speta. Thus, any consideration of the genus needs to be examined as to whether it refers to &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, the 50 species considered by and , or &quot;sensu lato&quot;, the much larger genus envisaged by .

=== Subdivision ===
This very large genus has long been divided into many subgenera. The &quot;Flora Europaea&quot; (1980) lists 15 subgenera, many of which had at various times been separate distinct genera. Having originally subsumed all of the Ornithogaleae genera into the single genus &quot;Ornithogalum&quot;, later subdivided this now very large genus into four subgenera after resurrecting three of the original subsumed genera (&quot;Albuca&quot;, &quot;Pseudogaltonia&quot;, &quot;Dipcadi&quot;). As proposed by them the genus has the following structure:
*subgenus &quot;Avonsera&quot; (monotypic: &quot;Ornithogalum convallarioides&quot;)
*subgenus &quot;Galtonia&quot; (7 species)
*subgenus &quot;Aspasia&quot; (30 species)
*subgenus &quot;Ornithogalum&quot; (7 sections, 120 species)

=== Species ===

Of the roughly 180 species, the best known are &quot;O. umbellatum&quot;, &quot;O. saundersiae&quot;, &quot;O. arabicum&quot;, and &quot;O. thyrsoides&quot;.
*&quot;Ornithogalum arabicum&quot; (Star-of-Bethlehem)
*&quot;Ornithogalum dubium&quot; (Sun star, yellow chincherinchee)
*&quot;Ornithogalum maculatum&quot; (Snake flower)
*&quot;Ornithogalum narbonense&quot; (Pyramidal star-of-Bethlehem)
*&quot;Ornithogalum nutans&quot; (Drooping star-of-Bethlehem)
*&quot;Ornithogalum pyrenaicum&quot; (Bath asparagus/Prussian asparagus/spiked star-of-Bethlehem)
*&quot;Ornithogalum saundersiae&quot; (Giant chincherinchee)
*&quot;Ornithogalum thyrsoides&quot; (Chincherinchee)
*&quot;Ornithogalum umbellatum&quot; (Garden star-of-Bethlehem) &quot;Type species&quot;
*&quot;Ornithogalum xanthochlorum&quot; (Namaqua chink/slangkop)

Species formerly placed in &quot;Galtonia&quot; include:
*&quot;Ornithogalum candicans&quot; (Summer hyacinth, Cape hyacinth)
*&quot;Ornithogalum princeps&quot; 
*&quot;Ornithogalum regalis&quot; 
*&quot;Ornithogalum saundersiae&quot; 
*&quot;Ornithogalum viridiflorum&quot; 

=== Etymology ===

The Latin genus name &quot;ornithogalum&quot; derives from Greek &quot;ornithogalon&quot; referring to ornithogalum umbellatum, itself deriving from &quot;ornis&quot; &quot;bird&quot; ( &quot;ornithos&quot;) and &quot;gala&quot; &quot;milk&quot;. The name is thought to be related to the white colour of the flowers; in some species, they resemble bird droppings. The possible (non-attested) alternative form in ancient Greek &quot;ornithogalē&quot; seems to be the source of classical Latin &quot;ornithogale&quot; as used by Pliny the Elder.

== Distribution and habitat ==
When the genus is broadly circumscribed, as for example by &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot;, species are widely distributed over several continents including Africa (other than the tropics), Madagascar, Europe, and temperate Asia (as far as Afghanistan).

== Uses ==

&quot;Ornithogalum&quot; species may be sold as cut flowers, particularly &quot;O. arabicum&quot;, &quot;O. dubium&quot;, &quot;O. saundersiae&quot;, and &quot;O.thyrsoides&quot;. They are also sold as ornamental garden flowers.

== Toxicity and use in alternative medicine ==
Some of the plants in the genus are poisonous, and have been known to kill grazing animals. Others are edible and used as vegetables. The bulbs contain alkaloids and cardenolides, which are toxic.

&quot;Ornithogalum&quot; has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health. However, according to Cancer Research UK, &quot;there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer&quot;.

<text>Jinjitsu (, &quot;Human Day&quot;) is one of the five seasonal festivals ( &quot;gosekku&quot;) that were integrated into the Japanese Imperial calendar over 1,000 years ago. &quot;Sekku&quot; is the term given meaning special day of observance. The festival is now celebrated on the seventh day of the first month and is considered a part of the New Year observances that are celebrated during this time. 

It is also known as Nanakusa-no-sekku, the &quot;Feast of Seven Herbs&quot;, from the custom of eating seven-herb kayu ( &quot;&quot;) to ensure good health and to ward off away evil spirits in the coming new year. The name &quot;Day of Mankind&quot; generates from the stipulation of no harm coming to humans on this day and the name &quot;Festival of The Seven Herbs&quot; comes from a tradition of store owners gathering and providing the seven lucky herbs to the emperor as nanakusagayu. The typical herbs used for the creation of nanakusagayu are nazuna, seri, gogyo, hotokenza, suzushiro, and hakobe. However, in some regions other variations are used. 

The tradition of eating nanakusagayu on the seventh day spread during the Heian period and by the Edo period those below the &quot;shōgun&quot; would consume it the morning of this day prior to coming together to address the &quot;shōgun&quot;. Another piece of reasoning behind the Japanese people eating nanakusagayu on the seventh day, Jinjitsu, is because it is also used as a day of rest. The soup mixture is easy on the stomach and is consumed to rest the digestive system that may have been weakened by the food that is consumed during the first days of the New Year.

The name and tradition are derived from an ancient Chinese custom called Renri which means the day humans were born, whereby each of the opening days of the first lunar month were assigned to a particular creature or animal, which it was forbidden to kill or lay harm to on that day: thus the first seven days of the month were Chicken Day, Dog Day, Boar Day, Sheep Day, Cow Day, Horse Day, and Human Day. On these days, no harm was caused to these animals and on the seventh day there were no punishments handed out to criminals. It is also a legend that the goddess Nüwa created the world and created animals on different days and humans were on the 7th day.

The celebration of the feast in Japan was moved from the 7th day of the first lunar month to the 7th day of January during the Meiji period, when Japan adopted the solar calendar during its time of reform from isolationism to a more modern, global form of government. Also included in some the celebrations are the singing of folk songs or &quot;nanakusabayashi&quot; which are performed in some areas throughout Japan. Tradition runs strong throughout Japan and this is one of many that have stuck around over the centuries.

<text>A bicyclic molecule () is a molecule that features two joined rings. Bicyclic structures occur widely, for example in many biologically important molecules like α-thujene and camphor. A bicyclic compound can be carbocyclic (all of the ring atoms are carbons), or heterocyclic (the rings&#x27; atoms consist of at least two elements), like DABCO. Moreover, the two rings can both be aliphatic (&quot;e.g.&quot; decalin and norbornane), or can be aromatic (&quot;e.g.&quot; naphthalene), or a combination of aliphatic and aromatic (&quot;e.g.&quot; tetralin).

Three modes of ring junction are possible for a bicyclic compound:
* In spiro compounds, the two rings share only one single atom, the spiro atom, which is usually a quaternary carbon. An example of a spirocyclic compound is the photochromic switch spiropyran. 
* In fused/condensed bicyclic compounds, two rings share two adjacent atoms. In other words, the rings share one covalent bond, &quot;i.e.&quot; the bridgehead atoms are directly connected (&quot;e.g.&quot; α-thujene and decalin).
* In bridged bicyclic compounds, the two rings share three or more atoms, separating the two bridgehead atoms by a bridge containing at least one atom. For example, norbornane, also known as bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, can be viewed as a pair of cyclopentane rings each sharing three of their five carbon atoms. Camphor is a more elaborate example.
==Nomenclature==
Bicyclic molecules are described by IUPAC nomenclature. The root of the compound name depends on the total number of atoms in all rings together, possibly followed by a suffix denoting the functional group with the highest priority. Numbering of the carbon chain always begins at one bridgehead atom (where the rings meet) and follows the carbon chain along the longest path, to the next bridgehead atom. Then numbering is continued along the second longest path and so on. Fused and bridged bicyclic compounds get the prefix &quot;bicyclo&quot;, whereas spirocyclic compounds get the prefix &quot;spiro&quot;. In between the prefix and the suffix, a pair of brackets with numerals denotes the number of carbon atoms between each of the bridgehead atoms. These numbers are arranged in descending order and are separated by periods.
For example, the carbon frame of norbornane contains a total of 7 atoms, hence the root name heptane. This molecule has two paths of 2 carbon atoms and a third path of 1 carbon atom between the two bridgehead carbons, so the brackets are filled in descending order: [2.2.1]. Addition of the prefix &quot;bicyclo&quot; gives the total name bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.

The carbon frame of camphor also counts 7 atoms, but is substituted with a carbonyl in this case, hence the suffix heptanone. We start with numbering the carbon frame at the bridgehead atom with the highest priority (methyl goes before proton), hence the bridgehead carbon in front gets number 1, the carbonyl gets number 2 and numbering continues along the carbon chain following the longest path, until the doubly substituted top carbon (number 7). Equal to norbornane, this molecule also has two paths of 2 carbon atoms and one path of 1 carbon atom between the two bridgehead carbons, so the numbers within the brackets stay [2.2.1]. Combining the brackets and suffix (now filling in the position of the carbonyl as well) gives us [2.2.1]heptan-2-one. Besides &quot;bicyclo&quot;, the prefix should also specify the positions of all methyl substituents so the complete, official name becomes 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one.

When naming simple fused bicyclic compounds, the same method as for bridged bicyclic compounds is applied, except the third path between the two bridgehead atoms now consists of zero atoms. Therefore, fused bicyclic compounds have a &quot;0&quot; included in the brackets. For example, decalin is named bicyclo[4.4.0]decane. The numbers are sometimes omitted in unambiguous cases. For example, bicyclo[1.1.0]butane is typically called simply bicyclobutane.

The heterocyclic molecule DABCO has a total of 8 atoms in its bridged structure, hence the root name octane. Here the two bridgehead atoms are nitrogen instead of carbon atoms. Therefore, the official name gets the additional prefix &quot;1,4-diaza&quot; and the total name becomes 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.

<doc id="1252844" wikidata="Q2002254" url="?curid=1252844" title="Saltwater intrusion">
<text>Saltwater intrusion is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers, which can lead to groundwater quality degradation, including drinking water sources, and other consequences. Saltwater intrusion can naturally occur in coastal aquifers, owing to the hydraulic connection between groundwater and seawater. Because saline water has a higher mineral content than freshwater, it is denser and has a higher water pressure. As a result, saltwater can push inland beneath the freshwater. In other topologies, submarine groundwater discharge can push fresh water into saltwater.

Certain human activities, especially groundwater pumping from coastal freshwater wells, have increased saltwater intrusion in many coastal areas. Water extraction drops the level of fresh groundwater, reducing its water pressure and allowing saltwater to flow further inland. Other contributors to saltwater intrusion include navigation channels or agricultural and drainage channels, which provide conduits for saltwater to move inland. Sea level rise caused by climate change also contributes to saltwater intrusion. Saltwater intrusion can also be worsened by extreme events like hurricane storm surges.

==Hydrology==
At the coastal margin, fresh groundwater flowing from inland areas meets with saline groundwater from the ocean. The fresh groundwater flows from inland areas towards the coast where elevation and groundwater levels are lower. Because saltwater has a higher content of dissolved salts and minerals, it is denser than freshwater, causing it to have a higher hydraulic head than freshwater. Hydraulic head refers to the liquid pressure exerted by a water column: a water column with higher hydraulic head will move into a water column with lower hydraulic head, if the columns are connected.

The higher pressure and density of saltwater causes it to move into coastal aquifers in a wedge shape under the freshwater. The saltwater and freshwater meet in a transition zone where mixing occurs through dispersion and diffusion. Ordinarily the inland extent of the saltwater wedge is limited because fresh groundwater levels, or the height of the freshwater column, increases as land elevation gets higher.

==Causes==

===Groundwater extraction===
Groundwater extraction is the primary cause of saltwater intrusion. Groundwater is the main source of drinking water in many coastal areas of the United States, and extraction has increased over time. Under baseline conditions, the inland extent of saltwater is limited by higher pressure exerted by the freshwater column, owing to its higher elevation. Groundwater extraction can lower the level of the freshwater table, reducing the pressure exerted by the freshwater column and allowing the denser saltwater to move inland laterally. In Cape May, New Jersey, since the 1940s water withdrawals have lowered groundwater levels by up to 30 meters, reducing the water table to below sea level and causing widespread intrusion and contamination of water supply wells.

Groundwater extraction can also lead to well contamination by causing upwelling, or upcoming, of saltwater from the depths of the aquifer. Under baseline conditions, a saltwater wedge extends inland, underneath the freshwater because of its higher density. Water supply wells located over or near the saltwater wedge can draw the saltwater upward, creating a saltwater cone that might reach and contaminate the well. Some aquifers are predisposed towards this type of intrusion, such as the Lower Floridan aquifer: though a relatively impermeable rock or clay layer separates fresh groundwater from saltwater, isolated cracks breach the confining layer, promoting upward movement of saltwater. Pumping of groundwater strengthens this effect by lowering the water table, reducing the downward push of freshwater.

===Canals and drainage networks===
The construction of canals and drainage networks can lead to saltwater intrusion. Canals provide conduits for saltwater to be carried inland, as does the deepening of existing channels for navigation purposes. In Sabine Lake Estuary in the Gulf of Mexico, large-scale waterways have allowed saltwater to move into the lake, and upstream into the rivers feeding the lake. Additionally, channel dredging in the surrounding wetlands to facilitate oil and gas drilling has caused land subsidence, further promoting inland saltwater movement.

Drainage networks constructed to drain flat coastal areas can lead to intrusion by lowering the freshwater table, reducing the water pressure exerted by the freshwater column. Saltwater intrusion in southeast Florida has occurred largely as a result of drainage canals built between 1903 into the 1980s to drain the Everglades for agricultural and urban development. The main cause of intrusion was the lowering of the water table, though the canals also conveyed seawater inland until the construction of water control gates.

==Solutions==

The seawater intrusion (SWI) into rivers can lead to many negative consequences, especially on agricultural activities and live ecosystems in upstream areas of rivers. There are many solutions developed to prevent or reduce the negative effects of Seawater intrusion. One of the sustainable solutions for rivers is using air bubble curtains that can completely solve SWI issues in rivers.

==Effect on water supply==
Many coastal communities around the United States are experiencing saltwater contamination of water supply wells, and this problem has been seen for decades. Many Mediterranean coastal aquifers suffer for seawater intrusion effects. The consequences of saltwater intrusion for supply wells vary widely, depending on extent of the intrusion, the intended use of the water, and whether the salinity exceeds standards for the intended use. In some areas such as Washington State, intrusion only reaches portions of the aquifer, affecting only certain water supply wells. Other aquifers have faced more widespread salinity contamination, significantly affecting groundwater supplies for the region. For instance, in Cape May, New Jersey, where groundwater extraction has lowered water tables by up to 30 meters, saltwater intrusion has caused closure of over 120 water supply wells since the 1940s.

==Ghyben–Herzberg relation==
The first physical formulations of saltwater intrusion were made by in 1888 and 1889 as well as in 1901, thus called the Ghyben–Herzberg relation. They derived analytical solutions to approximate the intrusion behavior, which are based on a number of assumptions that do not hold in all field cases.

In the equation, formula_1 the thickness of the freshwater zone above sea level is represented as formula_2 and that below sea level is represented as formula_3. The two thicknesses formula_2 and formula_3, are related by formula_6 and formula_7 where formula_6 is the density of freshwater and formula_9 is the density of saltwater. Freshwater has a density of about 1.000 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) at 20 °C, whereas that of seawater is about 1.025 g/cm3. The equation can be simplified to formula_10.

The Ghyben–Herzberg ratio states that, for every meter of fresh water in an unconfined aquifer above sea level, there will be forty meters of fresh water in the aquifer below sea level.

In the 20th century the vastly increased computing power available allowed the use of numerical methods (usually finite differences or finite elements) that need fewer assumptions and can be applied more generally.

==Modeling==
Modeling of saltwater intrusion is considered difficult. Some typical difficulties that arise are:

* The possible presence of fissures and cracks and fractures in the aquifer, whose precise positions and extents are unknown but which have great influence on the development of the saltwater intrusion
* The possible presence of small scale heterogeneities in the hydraulic properties of the aquifer, which are too small to be taken into account by the model but which may also have great influence on the development of the saltwater intrusion
* The change of hydraulic properties by the saltwater intrusion. A mixture of saltwater and freshwater is often undersaturated with respect to calcium, triggering dissolution of calcium in the mixing zone and changing hydraulic properties.
* The process known as cation exchange, which slows the advance of a saltwater intrusion and also slows the retreat of a saltwater intrusion.
* The fact that saltwater intrusions are often not in equilibrium makes it harder to model. Aquifer dynamics tend to be slow and it takes the intrusion cone a long time to adapt to changes in pumping schemes, rainfall, etc. So the situation in the field can be significantly different from what would be expected based on the sea level, pumping scheme etc.
* For long-term models, the future climate change forms a large unknown but good results are possible . Model results often depend strongly on sea level and recharge rate. Both are expected to change in the future.

==Mitigation and management==
Saltwater is also an issue where a lock separates saltwater from freshwater (for example the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks in Washington). In this case a collection basin was built from which the saltwater can be pumped back to the sea. Some of the intruding saltwater is also pumped to the fish ladder to make it more attractive to migrating fish.

As groundwater salinization becomes a relevant problem, more complex initiatives should be applied from local technical and engineering solutions to rules or regulatory instruments for whole aquifers or regions.

<text>In computer science, graph transformation, or graph rewriting, concerns the technique of creating a new graph out of an original graph algorithmically. It has numerous applications, ranging from software engineering (software construction and also software verification) to layout algorithms and picture generation.

Graph transformations can be used as a computation abstraction. The basic idea is that if the state of a computation can be represented as a graph, further steps in that computation can then be represented as transformation rules on that graph. Such rules consist of an original graph, which is to be matched to a subgraph in the complete state, and a replacing graph, which will replace the matched subgraph.

Formally, a graph rewriting system usually consists of a set of graph rewrite rules of the form formula_1, with formula_2 being called pattern graph (or left-hand side) and formula_3 being called replacement graph (or right-hand side of the rule). A graph rewrite rule is applied to the host graph by searching for an occurrence of the pattern graph (pattern matching, thus solving the subgraph isomorphism problem) and by replacing the found occurrence by an instance of the replacement graph. Rewrite rules can be further regulated in the case of labeled graphs, such as in string-regulated graph grammars.

Sometimes graph grammar is used as a synonym for &quot;graph rewriting system&quot;, especially in the context of formal languages; the different wording is used to emphasize the goal of constructions, like the enumeration of all graphs from some starting graph, i.e. the generation of a graph language – instead of simply transforming a given state (host graph) into a new state.

==Graph rewriting approaches==
===Algebraic approach===
The algebraic approach to graph rewriting is based upon category theory. The algebraic approach is further divided into sub-approaches, the most common of which are the &quot;double-pushout (DPO) approach&quot; and the &quot;single-pushout (SPO) approach&quot;. Other sub-approaches include the &quot;sesqui-pushout&quot; and the &quot;pullback approach&quot;.

From the perspective of the DPO approach a graph rewriting rule is a pair of morphisms in the category of graphs and graph homomorphisms between them: formula_4, also written formula_5, where formula_6 is injective. The graph K is called &quot;invariant&quot; or sometimes the &quot;gluing graph&quot;. A &quot;rewriting step&quot; or &quot;application&quot; of a rule r to a &quot;host graph&quot; G is defined by two pushout diagrams both originating in the same morphism formula_7, where D is a &quot;context graph&quot; (this is where the name &quot;double&quot;-pushout comes from). Another graph morphism formula_8 models an occurrence of L in G and is called a &quot;match&quot;. Practical understanding of this is that formula_2 is a subgraph that is matched from formula_10 (see subgraph isomorphism problem), and after a match is found, formula_2 is replaced with formula_3 in host graph formula_10 where formula_14 serves as an interface, containing the nodes and edges which are preserved when applying the rule. The graph formula_14 is needed to attach the pattern being matched to its context: if it is empty, the match can only designate a whole connected component of the graph formula_10.

In contrast a graph rewriting rule of the SPO approach is a single morphism in the category of labeled multigraphs and &quot;partial mappings&quot; that preserve the multigraph structure: formula_17. Thus a rewriting step is defined by a single pushout diagram. Practical understanding of this is similar to the DPO approach. The difference is, that there is no interface between the host graph G and the graph G&#x27; being the result of the rewriting step.

From the practical perspective, the key distinction between DPO and SPO is how they deal with the deletion of nodes with adjacent edges, in particular, how they avoid that such deletions may leave behind &quot;dangling edges&quot;. The DPO approach only deletes a node when the rule specifies the deletion of all adjacent edges as well (this &quot;dangling condition&quot; can be checked for a given match), whereas the SPO approach simply disposes the adjacent edges, without requiring an explicit specification.

There is also another algebraic-like approach to graph rewriting, based mainly on Boolean algebra and an algebra of matrices, called &quot;matrix graph grammars&quot;.

===Determinate graph rewriting===
Yet another approach to graph rewriting, known as &quot;determinate&quot; graph rewriting, came out of logic and database theory. In this approach, graphs are treated as database instances, and rewriting operations as a mechanism for defining queries and views; therefore, all rewriting is required to yield unique results (up to isomorphism), and this is achieved by applying any rewriting rule concurrently throughout the graph, wherever it applies, in such a way that the result is indeed uniquely defined.

===Term graph rewriting===
Another approach to graph rewriting is term graph rewriting, which involves the processing or transformation of term graphs (also known as &quot;abstract semantic graphs&quot;) by a set of syntactic rewrite rules.

Term graphs are a prominent topic in programming language research since term graph rewriting rules are capable of formally expressing a compiler&#x27;s operational semantics. Term graphs are also used as abstract machines capable of modelling chemical and biological computations as well as graphical calculi such as concurrency models. Term graphs can perform automated verification and logical programming since they are well-suited to representing quantified statements in first order logic. Symbolic programming software is another application for term graphs, which are capable of representing and performing computation with abstract algebraic structures such as groups, fields and rings.

The TERMGRAPH conference focuses entirely on research into term graph rewriting and its applications.

==Classes of graph grammar and graph rewriting system==
Graph rewriting systems naturally group into classes according to the kind of representation of graphs that are used and how the rewrites are expressed. The term graph grammar, otherwise equivalent to graph rewriting system or graph replacement system, is most often used in classifications. Some common types are:
* Attributed graph grammars, typically formalised using either the single-pushout approach or the double-pushout approach to characterising replacements, mentioned in the above section on the algebraic approach to graph rewriting.
* Hypergraph grammars, including as more restrictive subclasses port graph grammars, linear graph grammars and interaction nets.

==Implementations and applications==

Graphs are an expressive, visual and mathematically precise formalism for modelling of objects (entities) linked by relations; objects are represented by nodes and relations between them by edges. Nodes and edges are commonly typed and attributed. Computations are described in this model by changes in the relations between the entities or by attribute changes of the graph elements. They are encoded in graph rewrite/graph transformation rules and executed by graph rewrite systems/graph transformation tools.

<doc id="1252847" wikidata="Q6605884" url="?curid=1252847" title="List of animals awarded human credentials">
<text>This list of animals awarded human credentials includes nonhuman animals who have been submitted as applicants to suspected diploma mills, and have been awarded a diploma. On occasion, they have been admitted and granted a degree, as reported in reliable sources. Animals are often used as a device to clearly demonstrate the lax standards or fraudulent activities of the awarding institutions. In at least one case, a cat&#x27;s degree helped lead to a successful fraud prosecution against the institution that had issued it.

On occasion, accredited institutions award mock degrees to animals for humorous purposes, e.g. UNSW awarded a &quot;&quot; (not &quot;doctorate&quot;) to a dog; such cases are not included below.

==Cats==
===Colby Nolan (MBA)===
Colby Nolan was a house cat who was awarded an MBA in 2004 by Trinity Southern University, a Dallas-based diploma mill, sparking a fraud lawsuit by the Pennsylvania attorney general&#x27;s office.

Colby Nolan lived with a deputy attorney general. In looking to expose Trinity Southern University for fraud, undercover agents had the then-six-year-old feline obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration for $299. On the animal&#x27;s application, the agents claimed that the cat had previously taken courses at a community college, worked at a fast-food restaurant, babysat, and maintained a newspaper route. In response, the institution informed Colby that, due to the job experience listed on his application, he was eligible for an executive MBA which he could obtain for an additional $100. The transcript submitted by the agents claimed that Colby had a GPA of 3.5.

Upon learning that the cat received the degree, Pennsylvania attorney general Jerry Pappert filed a lawsuit against Trinity Southern University. In the lawsuit, Pappert directed the diploma mill, which had used email spam to sell degrees, to provide restitution to anyone who had ordered a degree from them.

In December 2004, the Texas attorney general obtained a temporary restraining order under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act against Trinity Southern and its owners, Craig B. and Alton S. Poe. The court also ordered the school&#x27;s assets frozen. In March 2005, the Poes were assessed penalties of over $100,000 by the court and were ordered not to market or promote fraudulent, substandard degree programs or to represent their university as being accredited or affiliated with legitimate universities. It was reported that the Poes were also associated with Wesleyan International University and Prixo Southern University. Trinity Southern University&#x27;s website has been offline since 2005.

=== George (registration for practice as a hypnotherapist) ===

In 2009, George, a cat owned by Chris Jackson (presenter of the BBC show &quot;Inside Out North East &amp; Cumbria&quot;), was registered as a hypnotherapist after his owner created a fake certificate from a non-existing institution and used it to register with three professional organizations: the British Board of Neuro Linguistic Programming, the United Fellowship of Hypnotherapists, and the Professional Hypnotherapy Practitioner Association.

=== Henrietta (Hettie, certified member of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants) ===

In 2007, the cat Henrietta, despite having been dead for around a year, was successfully registered as a certified member of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants by her owner Ben Goldacre, doctor and author of the Bad Science column in the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper and subsequent book. Goldacre registered Henrietta with AANC to showcase the complete lack of any verification for membership, beyond payment of $60, after TV nutritionist Gillian McKeith promoted her AANC membership among other unverified qualifications.

===Kitty O&#x27;Malley (high school diploma)===
In 1973, the Lakeland, Florida newspaper &quot;The Ledger&quot; obtained a high school diploma from &quot;Washington High Academy&quot; for Kitty O&#x27;Malley, a cat also known as Spanky. While the diploma was deemed insufficient to gain Kitty admission to local colleges, the state attorney general&#x27;s office planned to investigate the institution.

===Oliver Greenhalgh (fellowship of estate valuation professional society)===
On December 10, 1967, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Oliver Greenhalgh had been accepted as a fellow of the English Association of Estate Agents and Valuers, after a payment of eleven guineas (his two references were not verified). Oliver was a cat belonging to Michael Greenhalgh, a cameraman with Television Wales and the West, who was pursuing an investigation of bogus professional associations. 

===Oreo Collins (high school diploma)===
Oreo C. Collins (born around 2007) is a tuxedo cat who gained notoriety when she received a diploma from Jefferson High School Online in 2009, although her age was misrepresented in order to qualify. The sting was an investigative operation by the Better Business Bureau of Central Georgia headed by Kelvin Collins, Oreo&#x27;s owner.

===Zoe D. Katze (psychotherapist and hypnotherapy certifications)===
Zoe D. Katze (&quot;Zoe the Cat&quot; in German) was a house cat owned by psychologist Steve K. D. Eichel. Around 2001, Eichel obtained a psychotherapy certification for his cat from the American Psychotherapy Association and several hypnotherapy credentials from other organizations. The certification of Zoe has been cited in several books and articles on credentialing scams, and has appeared in psychology and forensic curricula. Eichel also served as the consultant to the BBC investigation that led to the certification of George the cat by several UK hypnosis associations.

==Dogs==

=== Chester Ludlow (MBA)===
In 2009, Chester Ludlow, a pug from Vermont, was awarded an MBA by Rochville University. His owner submitted an application and US$499 and received a &quot;diploma, two sets of transcripts, a certificate of distinction in finance, and a certificate of membership in the student council&quot;.

===Decoy Ohtani (United States travel visa)===

In January 2024, Decoy Ohtani, the dog of Shohei Ohtani, was granted an honorary American travel visa by Rahm Emanuel at the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo.

===Lulu (college diploma)===
In 2010, Mark Howard, a member of the legal team for the claimants (BSkyB) in &quot;BSkyB Ltd &amp; Anor v HP Enterprise Services UK Ltd &amp; Anor&quot; [2010] obtained a degree for his dog Lulu from Concordia College in the US Virgin Islands. Lulu &quot;graduated&quot; with higher marks than the defendant&#x27;s key witness, who, the judge found, had lied that he had attended classes for his Concordia MBA. In the legal community, the story of the witness&#x27; MBA is described as &quot;infamous&quot;, and a supervisory management cautionary tale.

=== Maxwell Sniffingwell (theriogenology/animal reproduction degree)===
In 2009, Dr. Ben Mays, a veterinarian in Clinton, Arkansas, obtained a degree in &quot;theriogenology/animal reproduction&quot; from Belford University on behalf of an English bulldog named Maxwell Sniffingwell. The application included his work as a reproductive specialist, noting his &quot;natural ability in theriogenology&quot; and &quot;experimental work with felines&quot; and his understanding of the merits of specialization despite a desire to do them all. He obtained a diploma, transcript and letter of recommendation upon receipt of a payment of $549 to the university, but declined an offer to be made an honors graduate for an additional $75.

===Molly (high school diploma)===
In February 2012, in a story on local diploma mills by Houston television station KHOU, the reporters got a high school diploma and official transcript from Lincoln Academy for their photographer&#x27;s basset hound Molly for $300 after filling out a &quot;laughable&quot;, &quot;easy take-home test&quot;. According to a homeschooling advocate, Lincoln Academy and other schools were improperly taking advantage of a Texas law that prohibits discrimination by public colleges and universities against homeschooled students.

===Ollie (associate editorship of medical journals)===
In 2017, Mike Daube, a public health expert in Western Australia, reinvented his dog Ollie as Dr. Olivia Doll. He made up credentials including &quot;past associate of the Shenton Park Institute for Canine Refuge Studies&quot; (where she was a rescue dog) and submitted her application for posts on the editorial boards of some predatory medical journals. Several accepted her application, and the Global Journal of Addiction and Rehabilitation Medicine named her associate editor.

===Pete (MBA)===
The American University of London offered Pete, a four-year-old male short-haired Lurcher in Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, London, an MBA for £4,500 without requiring any course work. The BBC current affairs programme &quot;Newsnight&quot; reported in 2013 that the dog, named &quot;Peter Smith&quot; on the faked CV for a management consultant, was offered an MBA by the university&#x27;s Accreditation of Previous Experiential Learning board based on his &quot;made-up work experience and a fictitious undergraduate degree&quot; just four days after applying for the course.

===Sonny (medical degree)===
The May 30, 2007 episode of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation comedy show &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot; documented host Chas Licciardello applying online and obtaining a medical degree for his dog Sonny from the diploma mill Ashwood University. Sonny&#x27;s &quot;work experience&quot; included &quot;significant proctology experience sniffing other dogs&#x27; bums&quot;. Ashwood University has since been listed as a Non Accredited Degree Supplier in the states of Michigan, Oregon, and Texas.

===Wally (associate&#x27;s degrees)===
In 2004, the Albany, New York television station WRGB ran a report in which reporter Peter Brancato applied to and received an associate degree from Almeda University on behalf of his dog, Wally. On the application, Brancato listed, &quot;Plays with the kids every day ... teaches them to interact better with each other ... Teaches them responsibilities like feeding the dog.&quot; Almeda University granted Wally a &quot;life experience&quot; associate degree in &quot;Childhood Development&quot;. After the report aired, Almeda University protested that Brancato perjured himself by creating a false identity using a fabricated name and date of birth. In a public statement, an Almeda University representative wrote, &quot;He completed an application that included a background of the following: Eight-years tutoring pre-K children, curriculum design and development, teaching coping skills, and volunteer coaching&quot;. In March 2008, Wally was featured in a Lake Geneva, Wisconsin mayoral campaign political cartoon, with a dialogue bubble reading, &quot;I graduated with Bill Chesen&quot;, referring to candidate Chesen&#x27;s Almeda University bachelor&#x27;s degree.

==Other==

===Algernon (goldfish)===
In 2021, environmentalist George Monbiot registered his childhood goldfish as a registered waste disposer in the UK.

<doc id="1252848" wikidata="Q822886" url="?curid=1252848" title="Riverside Stadium">
<text>The Riverside Stadium is a football stadium in Middlesbrough, England, which has been the home of Middlesbrough since its opening in 1995. It has an all-seated capacity of 34,742, although provisional planning permission is in place to expand to 42,000 if required.

Middlesbrough Women became affiliated with the Middlesbrough men&#x27;s team in May 2023 and now play selected matches at the Riverside Stadium.

==History==
The stadium was built to replace Ayresome Park following the publication of the Taylor Report, which required all top division football stadiums to be all-seater. After the report was delivered in January 1990, Middlesbrough needed an all-seater stadium by August 1994 but were unable to expand Ayresome Park outwards owing to its location in a residential area, and expanding the stadium upwards would have limited the club to a capacity of around 20,000 seats – the club wanted a considerably larger capacity. The decision was taken by club officials to build a new stadium; Teesside Development Corporation offered them the Middlehaven site by the River Tees for development.

The new 30,000 seater stadium was constructed by Taylor Woodrow Construction for £16 million, taking approximately nine months to complete after work began in the autumn of 1994. The name of the stadium was chosen by the club&#x27;s fans, following a vote during the final game at Ayresome Park. The other choices available were &quot;Middlehaven Stadium&quot;, &quot;Erimus Stadium&quot; and &quot;Teesside Stadium&quot;. When it opened, the name was amended to Cellnet Riverside Stadium (and then BT Cellnet Riverside Stadium) as part of a £3 million sponsorship deal with Cellnet, but this deal ended after the 2001–02 season.

The first game was played against Chelsea in front of a 28,286 crowd (the highest home attendance in fourteen years) on 26 August 1995. Middlesbrough won the game 2–0, with Craig Hignett taking the honour of scoring the first ever goal at the stadium, Jan Åge Fjørtoft scoring the second. Their first season at their new stadium was also their first back in the Premier League following promotion after two seasons away.

In their second season at the Riverside Stadium, Middlesbrough were runners-up in both of the domestic cups, but a points deduction in the league meant that they were relegated from the Premier League.

In 1998 – when Middlesbrough were promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt – the capacity was increased by 5,000 by filling in the north and south-west corners at a cost of £5 million. This expansion gave the stadium a 35,100 capacity. Modernisation of the stadium since then has led to the seating being reorganised on several occasions with the stadium having a capacity of 34,000 at the start of the 2017-18 season. The club have planning permission to extend the stadium by another 7,000 if demand made it necessary, which would bring its capacity up to approximately 42,000.
In 2005, the old Ayresome Park gates, which had been famously locked when the club went into liquidation in 1986, were erected outside the Riverside Stadium as a reminder of the past. Another addition has been statues of former players George Hardwick, Wilf Mannion and George Camsell. The area in front of the Ayresome Park gates is the location of the &quot;Borobrick Road&quot;, where fans could pay to have a message inscribed on a brick (often in memory of a deceased family member) to be added to the road. For Armistice Day 2008, a set of bricks commemorating eight Middlesbrough players who died in the two world wars was unveiled.

In July 2008, planning permission was granted by Middlesbrough Council to construct a wind turbine at the site of the stadium, standing 125 metres high and capable of generating three megawatts of electricity. The turbine is used to power the stadium, with the excess being sold to the National Grid.

On 24 April 2012, it was announced that the stadium would host the only public warm up match for the Great Britain Olympic football team before the London 2012 Olympic Games against Brazil. Football stars including Ryan Giggs, Craig Bellamy, Thiago Silva, Neymar, Lucas Moura and Hulk all featured in the match in which Brazil outclassed Great Britain, winning 2–0.

On 15 March 2013, it was announced that Conference National side Gateshead would stage a &quot;home&quot; game at the Riverside Stadium, after continual drainage problems at Gateshead International Stadium forced them to play their last twelve league games of the season at five different venues.

Following the club&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 2015–16 season, the ground underwent a £5 million package of renovations designed to bring it up to the standards required of Premier League stadiums. Renovations included the installation of a large press box at the back of the East Stand, the construction of two permanent television studios at the back of the south-east corner, with associated access and TV compound on the stadium&#x27;s exterior, an internal reorganisation of the West Stand reception, tunnel and changing room area, new floodlights and refurbished concourse areas including the addition of new kiosks and card and contactless payment methods.

==Stadium details==
The stadium is fully enclosed with every seat offering an uninterrupted view of the pitch. The four main stands are commonly known as the North, East, West and South stands. The corners are referred to as the North-East, North-West, South-East and South-West corners. Concourses run around the entirety of the ground with kiosks serving food and drink.

The North Stand backs on to the River Tees.

The West Stand runs along the length of the pitch and is the stadium&#x27;s largest stand. The stand contains a number of executive boxes along its length as well as restaurants etc. The stand houses the changing rooms, and the players&#x27; tunnel emerges from the middle of the stand. White seating in the top tier spells out the club&#x27;s nickname &quot;BORO&quot;.

The East Stand greets the players as they walk out the tunnel. The main television gantry was relocated to the top of the stand from the West Stand in 2016. White seating in the top tier of the stand spells out &quot;MFC&quot;. The roof houses five flagpoles with various flags flying, usually representing the league and cup competitions the club are participating in, as well as a flag of the team crest. A new press box was installed at the back of this stand in preparation for the club&#x27;s promotion back to the Premier League. The East Stand houses a family zone (North-East end) and also visiting supporters (South-East Corner). Prior the 2016–17 season, two permanent television studios were installed at the back of the South-East Corner, on either side of the existing giant TV screen. One effect of this was a slight reduction in overall capacity.

The South Stand previously housed visiting supporters (now relocated to the South-East corner), but since the 2013–14 season has housed home supporters. The stand houses the vocal Boro &quot;ultras&quot; group &quot;Red Faction&quot;, who are known to organise tifos.

===International matches===

====Association football====
Like its predecessor Ayresome Park, the Riverside Stadium has played host to international football. During the construction of the new Wembley Stadium, the England team toured the country, playing at varying grounds. The Riverside was chosen to host the Euro 2004 qualifying match against Slovakia on 11 June 2003. England won the match 2–1 with a brace from Michael Owen after Vladimír Janočko had put Slovakia ahead. The match is also notable for pitting Middlesbrough&#x27;s England defender Gareth Southgate against their own Slovakian striker at the time, Szilárd Németh. In April 2021, it was announced that the Riverside Stadium would host two England friendly matches, against Austria and Romania, in preparation for the Euro 2020 Championship.

In February 2022, the Riverside Stadium hosted two games of the Arnold Clark Cup, an invitational women&#x27;s association football tournament featuring England, Canada, Germany and Spain.

====Rugby League====
The Riverside Stadium was one of the venues for the 2021 Men&#x27;s Rugby League World Cup, hosting the penultimate Group D match between Tonga and the Cook Islands. Tonga won 92–10 and thus qualified for the quarter-finals as group winners, whilst the Cook Islands were eliminated from the competition.

===Concerts===
On 1 June 2019, Take That performed at the Riverside Stadium in front of 32,000 fans, as part of their 30th Anniversary Tour. They were supported by Rick Astley, the first time a concert had been held at the stadium.

On 1 June 2022, The Killers, supported by the Manic Street Preachers, played at the stadium in front of 33,000 fans as part of the UK leg of their Imploding the Mirage Tour.

On 5 June 2023, the Arctic Monkeys, supported by The Hives and The Mysterines, played at the stadium in front of 32,000 fans.

<doc id="1252860" wikidata="Q3086920" url="?curid=1252860" title="Fred Norris">
<text>Eric Fred Norris (born Fred Leo Nukis; July 9, 1955) is an American radio personality and the longest-tenured staff member of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, aside from Stern himself. He first met Howard Stern while working at WCCC-FM, a radio station in Hartford, Connecticut.

==Early life==
Fred Norris is the son of Valija Kronberg and Henry Nukis who were Latvian immigrants. Fred was raised in Manchester, Connecticut. By the time Fred, the second of two sons, was born, his parents&#x27; marriage was already troubled. His biological father left home when Fred was five, but those first few years were turbulent. &quot;There was always tension and rage,&quot; Norris remembers. &quot;My father had an alcohol problem. When Dad came home, you hid in the closet because there was always something going on you&#x27;d rather not be a part of.&quot; Fred spent most of his early childhood alone. When his older brother, Robert, wasn&#x27;t using Fred as a human punching bag, the brother wanted nothing to do with him. So Fred would escape by reading books, taking long bicycle rides, or watching many afternoon TV reruns (whence came his encyclopedic knowledge of classic fifties TV). &quot;I&#x27;d like to state for the record that every person on this show of Howard&#x27;s, even Robin, at least had a father figure to guide them,&quot; he says. &quot;Me, I was on my own.&quot;

Despite the lack of guidance, Norris managed to navigate his adolescence without major incident. When Norris was 13, his mother married his stepfather, Lewis Norris, a cabinet maker, whom Norris credits with finally making his mother happy and, unlike his own father, his stepfather generally treated Norris with respect. Around this time, he began playing guitar.

==Career==
A college student at the time, Norris first met Howard Stern while working the overnight shifts at WCCC, an AM and FM radio station in Hartford, Connecticut in the spring of 1979. He continued at WCCC after Stern&#x27;s departure; though left the station in early 1981 to take a job at WAQY-FM in Springfield, Massachusetts.

When Stern became a ratings hit at WWDC in Washington, D.C. that year, he was able to use his success as leverage to persuade the station to hire Norris, who started as the producer on Stern&#x27;s show in October 1981. He later moved with Stern to New York to work at WNBC in September 1982, and has been with the show ever since.

==Acting==
Norris has also appeared in several small television and movie roles. He played a younger version of himself in &quot;Private Parts&quot; in 1997. He played a parking enforcement officer in &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; in 1999 and a head shop owner named Leon on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; in 2013.

==Personal life==
In 1994, Norris married Allison Furman, a woman he originally met on the &quot;Dial-A-Date&quot; segment of Stern&#x27;s radio show broadcast on April 10, 1987. The couple have one daughter together, Tess, born in November 2002.

In 1993, Norris legally changed his name from Fred Leo Nukis to Eric Fred Norris. On the May 23, 1996 episode of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Stern and the cast had an extended discussion with Norris about this. Norris did not reveal the motivation for the change. Although he did not like the name Fred, he kept it because &quot;Fred Norris&quot; was the name the public knew him by.

On the November 13, 2006 broadcast, Stern wondered if anyone ever called Norris by his legally changed name, Eric. Norris responded by stating that no one referred to him as Eric. He went into detail that that was not the reason he changed his name in the first place. Stern revealed he was bewildered why Norris went to the lengths to legally change his name if nobody called him Eric. Norris said that the decision was based on the fact that he had a hostile relationship with his father.

<doc id="1252877" wikidata="Q142477" url="?curid=1252877" title="1695 Walbeck">
<text>1695 Walbeck, provisional designation , is a carbonaceous asteroid from the central region of the asteroid belt, approximately 19 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 15 October 1941, by Finnish astronomer Liisi Oterma at Turku Observatory in Southwest Finland, and named after Henrik Walbeck.

== Classification and orbit ==

The asteroid orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.0–3.6 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,694 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.29 and an inclination of 17° with respect to the ecliptic. &quot;Walbeck&quot;″s observation arc begins the night after its official discovery observation.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the SMASS taxonomy, the carbonaceous asteroid is characterized as a Cg-type, an intermediate between the C-type and G-type asteroids.

=== Lightcurves ===

In November 2006, a rotational lightcurve of &quot;Walbeck&quot; was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini. It gave a rotation period of 5.1607 hours with a brightness variation of 0.22 magnitude (). Two similar periods were obtained by David Romeuf and by a team of Hungarian astronomers ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Walbeck&quot; measures between 17.88 and 19.62 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.037 and 0.051. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; derives an albedo of 0.046 and a diameter of 19.60 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.5.

== Naming ==

The minor planet was named in memory of Finnish scientist Henrik Johan Walbeck (1793–1822), astronomer and geodesist at the old Academia Aboensis who used the method of least squares to derive a good value for the Earth&#x27;s flattening. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 April 1980 ().

His other RCA hit singles included &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; peaking at No. 33 in the national chart and &quot;Save a Little Bit&quot;.

Goldsmith co-wrote and recorded &quot;You Got Me Dancing&quot; with the American producer Jaee Logan for his second album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn This Groove Around&quot;, which was also released by RCA Records. The single was released in 1989 featuring M.C. Hammer. It was Hammer&#x27;s first release in the UK. Hammer also appeared in Glen Goldsmith&#x27;s music video for this song.

Goldsmith&#x27;s career then moved more into songwriting and production where he published his own work. He worked alongside Ollie Jay and Philip Jacobs during the 1990s. Several songs were released, including &quot;Put Love&quot;, &quot;Learn to Live&quot; and &quot;Understanding&quot;, written by Goldsmith, Jacobs and Jacobs. Also, &quot;Go with the Flow&quot; which came out on Diverse Records, was written by Goldsmith and the Code.

Goldsmith scored his first top 30 hit as a co-songwriter/producer with Paul Johnson and Phil Edwards. &quot;Call Me by My Name&quot; was recorded by Mica Paris. Goldsmith then worked with Dannii Minogue, Ultimate Kaos, Rozalla, Kinane, with two underground No. 1 dance hits &quot;Heaven&quot; and &quot;Business&quot; and boy group MN8. His biggest hit to date was &quot;Mysterious Girl&quot;, as recorded by Peter André On its third release after chart positions No. 53 and No. 2, the track eventually reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart, following André&#x27;s appearance on &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. However, &quot;I Feel You&quot; had given Goldsmith his first UK No. 1 credit as a songwriter when released by André in 1997. Goldsmith went on to have a third hit single as co-writer when &quot;Natural&quot; peaked at No. 6. Another André track, &quot;Turn It Up&quot;, was also co-written by Goldsmith.

In 2000, Goldsmith built his own recording studio in Ladbroke Grove, London, and set up Blues &amp; Rhythm, a production company and record label working with various artists such as Soul-unique and his brother lead vocalist KG/Mn8. In 2004, Goldsmith composed &quot;Trippin&#x27;&quot; for Milk &amp; Sugar&#x27;s album, &quot;Housemusic.de&quot;. In 2008, Goldsmith and Rollover wrote Niki Evans&#x27; debut single, &quot;Love Me No More&quot; which failed to reach the top 40 in the UK Singles Chart.

In January 2011, Goldsmith made an appearance on the BBC Television&#x27;s musical quiz program, &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;.

Goldsmith set up his own independent record label, Soul on Soul Records, and between 2011 and 2013 released three singles; &quot;Jammin&#x27; in the Place&quot;, also found on the compilation album, &quot;Soul Togetherness 2012&quot; (Expansion Records), &quot;So @ Ease&quot; and &quot;Sunshine&quot;. &quot;Jammin&#x27; in the Place&quot; made it to the No. 5 position on the Official UK Soul Chart and No.9 in the Sweet Rhythm Chart on Solar Radio. &quot;So @ Ease&quot; made the No. 1 spot on the Official UK Soul Chart. &quot;Sunshine&quot;, which was released on 2 July 2013, reached the No. 1 spot on the Official UK Soul Chart on 17 August, Glen&#x27;s birthday, and retained this position for 2 weeks.

In 2015, Goldsmith topped the Official UK Soul Chart once again with &quot;Don&#x27;t Delay&quot; and to No. 3 in the Top 100 Songs of 2014. This song also appears on the compilation album &quot;Luxury Soul 2015&quot; on Ralph Tee&#x27;s Expansion Records.

<doc id="1252882" wikidata="Q1276903" url="?curid=1252882" title="Siphon (mollusc)">
<text>A siphon is an anatomical structure which is part of the body of aquatic molluscs in three classes: Gastropoda, Bivalvia and Cephalopoda (members of these classes include saltwater and freshwater snails, clams, octopus, squid and relatives).

Siphons in molluscs are tube-like structures in which water (or, more rarely, air) flows. The water flow is used for one or more purposes such as locomotion, feeding, respiration, and reproduction. The siphon is part of the mantle of the mollusc, and the water flow is directed to (or from) the mantle cavity.

A single siphon occurs in some gastropods. In those bivalves which have siphons, the siphons are paired. In cephalopods, there is a single siphon or funnel which is known as a [[hyponome]].

==In gastropods==

In some (but not all) sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs, the animal has an anterior extension of the mantle called a siphon, or inhalant siphon, through which water is drawn into the mantle cavity and over the gill for respiration.

This siphon is a soft fleshy tube-like structure equipped with chemoreceptors which &quot;smell&quot; or &quot;taste&quot; the water, in order to hunt for food. Marine gastropods that have a siphon are either predators or scavengers.

Although in gastropods the siphon functions perfectly well as a tube, it is not in fact a hollow organ, it is simply a flap of the mantle that is rolled into the shape of a tube.

In many marine gastropods where the siphon is particularly long, the structure of the shell has been modified in order to house and protect the soft tissue of the siphon. This shell modification is known as the siphonal canal. For a gastropod whose shell has an exceptionally long siphonal canal, see Venus comb murex.

In the case of some other marine gastropod shells, such as the volute and the &quot;Nassarius&quot; pictured to the right, the shell has a simple &quot;siphonal notch&quot; at the anterior edge of the aperture instead of a long siphonal canal.

The &quot;Aplysia&quot; gill and siphon withdrawal reflex is a defensive reflex which is found in sea hares of the genus &quot;Aplysia&quot;; this reflex has been much studied in neuroscience.
===Siphon as a snorkel===

Freshwater apple snails in the genera &quot;Pomacea&quot; and &quot;Pila&quot; have an extensible siphon made from a flap of the left mantle cavity. They use this siphon in order to breathe air while they are submerged in water which has a low oxygen content so they cannot effectively use their gill.

Apple snails use the siphon in a way that is reminiscent of a human swimmer using a snorkel, except that the apple snail&#x27;s siphon can be retracted completely, or extended to various lengths as needed.

For these freshwater snails, the siphon is an anti-predator adaptation. It reduces their vulnerability to being attacked and eaten by birds because it enables the apple snails to breathe without having to come all the way up to the surface, where they are easily visible to predators.

The shells of these freshwater snails have simple round apertures; there is no special notch for the siphon.
==Paired siphons of bivalves==
Those bivalves that have siphons, have two of them. Not all bivalves have siphons however: those that live on or above the substrate, as is the case in scallops, oysters, etc., do not need them. Only those bivalves that burrow in sediment, and live buried in the sediment, need to use these tube-like structures. The function of these siphons is to reach up to the surface of the sediment, so that the animal is able to respire, feed, and excrete, and also to reproduce.

The deeper a bivalve species lives in the sediment, the longer its siphons are. Bivalves which have extremely long siphons, like the geoducks pictured here, live very deeply buried, and are hard to dig up when clamming.
Many bivalves that have siphons can withdraw them completely into the shell when needed, but this is not true of all species. Bivalves that &quot;can&quot; withdraw the siphons into the shell have a &quot;pallial sinus&quot;, a sort of pocket, into which the siphons can fit when they are withdrawn, so that the two shell valves can close properly. The existence of this pocket shows even in an empty shell, as a visible indentation in the pallial line, a line which runs along parallel to the ventral margin of the shell.

The bivalve&#x27;s two siphons are situated at the posterior edge of the mantle cavity. There is an inhalant or incurrent siphon, and an exhalant or excurrent siphon. The water is circulated by the action of the gills. Usually water enters the mantle cavity through the inhalant siphon, moves over the gills, and leaves through the exhalant siphon. The water current is utilized for respiration, but also for filter feeding, excretion, and reproduction.

===Feeding===
Depending on the species and family concerned, some bivalves utilize their inhalant siphon like the hose of a vacuum cleaner, and actively suck up food particles from the marine substrate. Most other bivalves ingest microscopic phytoplankton as food from the general water supply, which enters via the inhalant siphon and reaches the mouth after passing over the gill.

Please also see pseudofeces.

==Hyponome of cephalopods==
The hyponome or siphon is the organ used by cephalopods to expel water, a function that produces a locomotive force. The hyponome developed from the foot of the molluscan ancestor.

Water enters the mantle cavity around the sides of the funnel, and subsequent contraction of the hyponome expands and then contracts, expelling a jet of water.

In most cephalopods, such as octopus, squid, and cuttlefish, the hyponome is a muscular tube. The hyponome of the nautilus differs however, in that it is a one-piece flap that is folded over. Whether ammonites possessed a hyponome and if so what form it may have taken, is as yet not known.

<text>Langham is a village and civil parish in Rutland in the East Midlands of England. The village is about north-west of Oakham, on the A606 main road linking Oakham and Melton Mowbray.

==Etymology==
The village&#x27;s name means &quot;homestead/village which is long or hemmed-in land which is long&quot;.

==Amenities==
It has two pubs, the Wheatsheaf and the Noel Arms, and a Church of England primary school. Langham Lodge is a Grade II listed house on the edge of the village.

The Church of England parish church of Saints Peter and Paul dates in part from the late 13th century and is a Grade I listed building. There is also a Baptist Chapel, built in 1854.

==Notable people==
Notable inhabitants include Simon Langham, a 14th-century monk who became Archbishop of Canterbury; Major General John Brocklehurst, 1st Baron Ranksborough CB CVO (13 May 1852 – 28 February 1921), a soldier, courtier and Liberal politician - there is a memorial to the latter in the village church; and Alicia Kearns, the current MP for Rutland and Melton.

==Industry and trade==
Ruddles Brewery was based in Langham from its foundation in 1858 until it was closed in 1999. The water from the local well was said to give the beer a unique character and quality, which enhanced the brewery&#x27;s reputation. The site of the brewery has now been demolished and replaced by a housing development.

The village used to have a small shop for everyday items, however this shut after campaigned against by villagers. Joan&#x27;s Free range eggs sold locally farmed eggs for many years until its closing in 2022, more than 5 years after Joan&#x27;s death.

Langham Engineering is based on the outskirts of the village and a leading manufacturer of precision machined components and shafts. Langham Engineering is the only business to still run from Langham having been there since its founding in the late 1970&#x27;s.

<text>Model building is a hobby and career that involves the creation of physical models either from kits or from materials and components acquired by the builder. The kits contain several pieces that need to be assembled in order to make a final model. Most model-building categories have a range of common scales that make them manageable for the average person both to complete and display. A model is generally considered physical representations of an object and maintains accurate relationships between all of its aspects.

The model building kits can be classified according to skill levels that represent the degree of difficulty for the hobbyist. These include skill level 1 with snap-together pieces that do not require glue or paint; skill level 2, which requires glue and paint; and, skill level 3 kits that include smaller and more detailed parts. Advanced skill levels 4 and 5 kits ship with components that have extra-fine details. Particularly, level 5 requires expert-level skills.

== Model building as career ==
Model building is not exclusively a hobbyist pursuit. The complexity of assembling representations of actual objects has become a career for several people, and is heavily applicable in film making. There are, for instance, those who build models/props to commemorate historic events, employed to construct models using past events as a basis to predict future events of high commercial interest.

== The categories of modelling include ==
* Scale model building
* Live steam models
* Model engineering
* Matchstick models
* Military models
* Model aircraft
* Model cars
* Model construction vehicles
* Building models
* Architectural models
* Model figures
* Model military vehicles
* Rail transport modelling
* Model rockets
* Ship models
* Freelance model
* Cardboard engineering
* Firearm models (such as Airsoft guns)
* Gundam models

<doc id="1252899" wikidata="Q487517" url="?curid=1252899" title="Hagwon">
<text> (; ) is a Korean term for a for-profit private educational institution. They are commonly likened to cram schools. Some consider &quot;hagwons&quot; as private language centers or academies operated like businesses apart from the South Korean public school system. , 78.3% of grade school students in South Korea attend at least one and spend an average of 7.2 hours weekly in them.

Most children begin attending them by age five, with some even beginning by age two. The schools tend to focus on individual topics, including the English language, mathematics, and the college entrance exam, the College Scholastic Ability Test. also exist for adults.

&quot;Hagwons&quot; have been a topic of controversy and criticism both internationally and in South Korea. They are seen as symptomatic of the significant competitiveness in South Korean society, and contribute to significant expense and stress for the majority of families who participate in them. Real estate prices are affected by proximity to elite hagwons, with homes located near these educational centers experiencing higher demand.

== Description ==
 are private educational institutions that are often compared to cram schools in the West. They teach a variety of subjects, for many purposes, to a variety of different age groups. As of 2020, South Korea had 73,865 .

=== Motivation ===

Competition for education and jobs in South Korea is widely considered to be extreme. Nearly 70% of students in South Korea participate in higher education, compared to 51% in the United States and 57% in the United Kingdom. This makes college admissions in South Korea, and especially the entrance examination (College Scholastic Ability Test), highly competitive. In 2023, it was reported that over half of test takers in the Gangnam and Seocho Districts retake the exam a year later because they were dissatisfied with their previous scores.

=== Demographics ===
A significant majority of South Korean children begin attending by the age of five; it was reported in 2017 that 83% of five year olds attended at least one. A minority of students begin at age two. In 2022, it was reported that 78.3% of students between the first to twelfth grade attended at least one and spent an average of 7.2 hours in per week. Attendance of and time spent in is higher for elementary and middle school students.

Some students attend until late at night. A number of offer private bus or shuttle services to bring the children back home, although the safety of these services due to cost minimization efforts has been criticized.

=== Subjects ===
Parents spend the most money on English language , with mathematics and Korean taking second and third place. Science and the humanities are also popular, although less so. are also seen as a critical place to prepare for the college entrance exams.

While most focus on meeting educational needs, many also exist for a variety of nonacademic subjects, including music, art, swimming, and Taekwondo. A variety of for adults also exist, including some to train flight attendants.

==History and regulations==

In 1885, Henry Appenzeller founded the Paichai school (배재대학교) as a cover for his missionary work. At the time it was illegal to preach other religions in Korea. Although his main goal was to spread his faith, it was still used by Koreans to learn English.

In the 1970s and 1980s, were reportedly seen as optional for remedial studying. Private education, known as &quot;gwaoe&quot; (과외), was banned by President Chun Doo-hwan in 1980. It was felt the advantage of private education unfairly burdened the poor and to promote equality, all access to it was made illegal. Through the years the government has relaxed the restrictions on private education by increasingly allowing more individuals and organizations to offer private education until the ban was ruled unconstitutional in the 1990s.

Korean courts have ruled that it may violate the constitution for the government to limit the amount of money can charge. In early 2008, the Seoul government was working on changes to the regulations to allow to set their own hours, citing individual choice as trumping regulation. However, the government reversed its position five days later. The regulations were criticized as ineffective because the city council possessed limited resources to monitor and enforce them. 

Along with these restrictions, had to disclose their tuition amounts to the government so people could complain if the schools attempted to raise the tuition. The licenses of caught running false advertisements will be revoked. are required to issue cash receipts. In July 2009, to help catch violators of these new regulations, the government started a program to reward people who reported them. 

The regulations were intended to reduce the cost of private education. However, some added weekend classes to compensate for shorter weekday classes. Other parents have sought out private tutors to make up for lost study time. Other simply ignored the regulations. It was reported in April 2009 that 67 percent of sampled were found to have overcharged for tuition. Forty percent were found to have charged parents over two times the registered tuition amount.

In March 2008, the government prohibited school teachers from creating test questions for . It had been found that some teachers were leaking tests and test questions to , giving the students who attended those schools advantages when it came time to take the test.

A petition was made in October 2009 by parents, teachers, students and owners to challenge the government&#x27;s legislation regarding closing times in Seoul and Busan. The constitutional court ruled that the laws did not violate the constitution. The restriction was put in place for Seoul and Busan in the summer of 2009. In making the ruling the court said, &quot;Because it&#x27;s important to secure sleep for high school students to overcome fatigue and for the sake of their growth, it&#x27;s difficult to say that [the ban] excessively restricts basic rights.&quot;

In April 2010 it was reported that there were over 25,000 registered with the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, with nearly 6,000 being in the Gangnam area. It was also revealed that local government councils other than Seoul had decided not to implement the 22:00 curfew. The curfew was seen as not having an impact on education fees and not addressing the real concern with private education. Despite the curfew, there have been attempts to get around this curfew among in Seoul.

== Controversy ==
Teaching as a whole in South Korea is essential, especially for the rigorous and fast-paced curriculum. There have been recorded cases of teachers&#x27; behavior regarding academic discrimination and ignoring students&#x27; learning process and effects. Hagwons not only impact students but parents and teachers as well. In 2022, a mother was so concerned about her son not having enough time to study that she advertised for someone to sit with her son at a study cafe and to wake him up anytime he fell asleep studying. In an article by Suzy Gardner, she interviewed a previous hagwon educator and was told that though her job was to teach English, she &quot;illegally&quot; taught ballet because the hagwon she worked at didn&#x27;t have enough employees to support all of the classes that they offered. The individual also said that they were so understaffed that they had to watch over at least three rooms at once, with one room containing students aged four. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, students are overworked and exhausted. The average South Korean student works up to 13 hours a day, which is more than half of the day, leaving only 5.5 hours of sleep at night (far below the recommended 8-9 hours of sleep).

=== Cost and economics ===
Despite South Korea&#x27;s now decreasing population and lowest fertility rate in the world, spending on education has only grown. In 2022, Koreans spent on private education, at an average of per month. Becoming the most expensive country in the world to raise a child, which sparked many concerns for the South Korean economy, according to &quot;Time&quot; magazine. 

While some see as filling a need not being adequately met by the public school system, others see them as creating an unequal footing between the poor and rich in Korea. Although most Korean children attend , according to &quot;CNN&quot;, studies have still shown a measurable difference in educational outcomes based on the income of the parents.

Efforts are now being made to try and curb the amount of private spending on , although some observers are skeptical that they will be successful. The Korean government has even provided 150 million won ($125,000) to each of the 400 schools that were selected nationwide to refurbish after-school programs and other classes. The Ministry of Education states that the 60-billion won project is expected to halve the private education costs for middle or even lower-income families. Some even stated that the use of hagwons won&#x27;t be required as the curriculum will be revised. Headmasters would be provided the authority to hire additional educational professionals.
=== Academic elitism ===
Research shows hagwons are associated with South Korea&#x27;s pervasive academic elitism and educational inequity due to their provision of supplementary education. Many students rely heavily on hagwons to improve their grades and to perform well on the College Scholastic Ability Test, which determines whether or not a student will be able to apply to certain universities. A 2023 statistics indicate a notable increase in hagwon spending, disproportionately benefiting students from wealthier or geographically advantageous backgrounds. Daechi-dong, a neighborhood in Gangnam District, Seoul, which is known for its heavily concentrated wealth and high standard of living, is dubbed the &quot;mecca of private education&quot; in South Korea. According to a report released on March 7, 2023, by the Ministry of Education and Statistics Korea based on data collected from January 2022 to December 2022, the monthly average expenditures on hagwons and other private education for households at the bottom of the five-tier, income-based categorization with children aged 13-18, were \482,000 – only slightly higher than the 481,000 won these families spent on food. Research shows that there is extremely high demand for private education in a highly competitive academic environment, contributing to educational inequality. Data reveals a significant representation of students from high-income districts like Gangnam-gu and Seocho in these universities and that the matriculation rate at SKY Universities was inversely proportional to students&#x27; household income – students from lower-income households matriculated at lower rates. The influence of hagwons on South Korea&#x27;s education system is also a common theme in media. In &quot;SKY Castle&quot;, the plot centers on upper-class families destroying each other&#x27;s lives by committing identity fraud, murder, and suicide in order to send their children to the top universities and secure lucrative career paths.

=== Health impact ===

The culture is widely viewed as extreme by both international and domestic observers. A number of experts have expressed concerns about the mental health impact on especially the younger attendees, and even on the parents who have to afford and carefully curate their children&#x27;s education in order to have them be competitive. In 2017, it was reported that among OECD countries, South Korea had the highest suicide rate in the world. This pressure on mental health is not only felt by the students but also by their parents, who often face the financial and emotional burden of ensuring their children&#x27;s success in an extremely competitive educational environment. Some hagwons use &quot;anxiety marketing&quot; using phrases such as, &quot;If not now, then when?&quot; to evoke a sense of urgency amongst parents of students. In addition to mental health issues, there are also concerns about physical health implications due to the long hours spent in hagwons. According to a 2015 &quot;New York Times&quot; report, the average South Korean student works up to 13 hours a day, which is more than half of the day, leaving only 5.5 hours of sleep at night. Research shows that a lifestyle of lack of sleep can lead to problems such as chronic fatigue, poor sleep quality, and an increased risk of physical health problems in the long term. As an effort to combat these issues, in 2010, the South Korean government implemented regulations to limit the operating hours of hagwons and reduce the academic burden on students.

=== Impact on real estate ===
A higher-than-average concentration of in the Gangnam District, specifically Daechi-dong (대치동), has been cited as the primary reason for an increase in real estate costs in the area. In the 1970s the Seoul government made some top schools relocate to the area. The schools there have become associated with entry into elite high schools and then elite universities. Many residents feel their children need to be associated with these schools to reach the upper levels of business and success.

As more parents try to move to the area to allow their children to attend these schools, the prices of real estate in the area have risen to 300 percent of similar areas in Seoul. In 2003 the government had planned to develop a center in Pangyo to relieve some of the pressure on Gangnam, yet after heavy criticism for only shifting the problem around and not solving it, the government canceled the plan only a couple of weeks later.

=== Competitiveness ===
Top-rated hagwon slots are fought over by parents. Parents will stand outside all day to register and enroll students in top hagwons. Some believe that there is a disadvantage for low-income families as many of them cannot afford the costs of hagwons. Typically, financial assistance provides an education that helps differentiate one&#x27;s value, this is where socioeconomic groups cause inequity in competition. Because of this gap, many students fight to find ways to &quot;stand out&quot; to compensate for not receiving the same level of education or opportunity.

==English-language instructors==

Native English speakers were hired as early as 1883 in Korea, originally out of need. The first teacher hired at the government-run Tongmunhak was Thomas Hallifax. Due to the preference for having native English speakers teach English, many native English-speakers are still hired to teach at in Korea. These may be only English schools or they may also be schools which offer a variety of subjects including English. 

The minimum requirements for foreigners for such teaching positions are: citizenship of Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, or the United States, a clean criminal background check at the national level, and a bachelor&#x27;s degree obtained in one of the aforementioned countries. 

In return for signing a one-year contract, the institute provides an instructor with a monthly salary, round-trip airfare from his or her country of origin, usually a rent-free apartment or housing stipend for the duration of the instructor&#x27;s contract, a pension pay for some citizens, and an additional one-month &quot;severance pay&quot; at the completion of the contract.

Foreign instructors hold a mixed view of . Some have complained of poor housing, non-payment, disagreements, and getting fired on the 11th month before they receive severance pay; however, many instructors have had no significant issues with the they have worked at. Some recommend looking at blacklists or greenlists, but others say they are not necessarily reliable.

 owners have complained about the challenge in finding truly qualified teachers. A group of English instructors first formed a labour union at a in 2005.

==&quot;Hagwon&quot;s abroad==
In some English-speaking countries, exist for ethnic Koreans. In North America, about 75% of Korean-language supplemental schools have affiliation with churches. As of 2006, of the registered with the Korean School Association of America (KSAA), over 75% were affiliated with Korean churches. There are also secular formal and secular informal . The are equivalent to &quot;hoshū jugyō kō&quot; (&quot;hoshūkō&quot;) in ethnic Japanese communities and &quot;buxiban&quot; in ethnic Chinese communities. As of 2010, every year over 50,000 Korean Americans attend Korean heritage schools.

Korean schools were first established in Hawaii after 1903, when the first wave of Korean immigration came to the United States. The modern generation of Korean supplemental schools were first established in the United States in the 1970s. At the time they were weekend schools that had a mission to preserve the Korean-American identity in its students. They taught the Korean language, managed the assimilation of Korean-American children, and offered afterschool tutoring programs. There were almost 500 schools registered with the KSAA by the end of the 1980s. Beginning in the 1990s there were also that were supplementary academic preparation programs like the ones in Korea. Despite this, some parents viewed the quality of American as less rigorous than their South Korean counterparts. But in 2010, it was reported that some Korean parents in the United States viewed some in the New Jersey–New York area as being of similar quality.

Kang Hee-Ryong, author of the PhD thesis &quot;White supremacy, racialization, and cultural politics of Korean Heritage Language Schools&quot;, wrote that the Korean heritage schools are &quot;not simply a means of counter hegemony against the racializing forces&quot; but instead the &quot;product of compromises&quot; between different generations of Korean Americans.

<text>Durrington or High Salvington Windmill is a Grade II listed post mill in High Salvington, Sussex that has been restored and is in full working order. The mill stands above sea level and is able to take advantage of incoming sea winds.

==History==

The earliest mention of a mill is in church records, which indicate that the miller was fined in 1615. Budgen&#x27;s 1724 map showed a mill on this site. The current mill was built around 1750 and was apparently insured against fire in 1774. The windmill ground flour for the Worthing area until 1897 when it was purchased by Colonel T F Wisden. A condition of sale was that the mill had to be kept in working order. It was retired to a role of grinding animal feed until 1905. During much of the 20th century the mill was neglected although in 1907 the wooden roundhouse was replaced with a concrete structure used as a tea-room. In 1959, the mill was taken into the care of Worthing Borough Council. Messrs E Hole and Son, millwrights of Burgess Hill renovated the mill in 1961 and fitted a new pair of stocks and four new sails. In March 1976 one of the sails was broken off in a gale, and the other three removed. An inspection of the mill revealed she was not in good repair. Worthing Town Council set up a restoration project. The roundhouse was rebuilt to better replicate the original in 1990 and the restored mill began grinding again in 1991. A granary rescued from East Grinstead was re-erected at the mill in 1994. In 1998 it was discovered that one of the stocks was split. A new stock was made from laminated larch and the sails were refitted.

In early 2008, the three councillors from Salvington Ward, Mayor Heather Mercer, Cllr Jacqui Marsh and Cllr Noel Atkins, awarded the Mill Trust a total of £3,000, from the Mayor&#x27;s fund and the pilot Ward Budget Scheme, respectively. This will contribute to the refurbishment of the current gatehouse as a visitor information centre, which it is hoped will be completed by the end of 2009.

==Mythology==
Sadly, much has been written about Durrington Mill, (now called High Salvington Mill), which has found its way into official records and publications, but for which the original research appears to be lacking. This section attempts to dispel a number of these myths.

When the economics of wind and water-powered mill was undermined by new, steam-powered roller mills, millers of the old school had to find new ways to make a living. At High Salvington, the miller&#x27;s wife, who was regularly asked for a glass of water by tourists who had toiled up the hill, hit upon the idea of offering a cup of tea and charging for this service. Thus was the High Salvington Windmill tea-room initiated. After miller Scutt&#x27;s suicide, subsequent &quot;millers&quot; chose to emphasise the Mill as a tourist attraction and made money by charging for refreshments and to climb the steps to look at the mill and its machinery. While this contributed to keeping the mill and its machinery intact, the &quot;millers&quot; elaborated and embellished the known history of the mill, and thus an extensive body of mythology was created to attract and excite visitors. These myths often have been quoted and cited, as various millers lent credence to their stories by publishing them in leaflets, available to the visiting public.

===The myth of the Post Tree===

A favourite myth is that of the mill&#x27;s post being part of a tree that grew on the site, the roots of which extended many feet below the ground. Apart from the fact that no mills were built like this in the 1740s, once the raised floor of the tea-rooms was removed from the hexagonal concrete round-house constructed in 1907, it is clear that the post, as is to be expected, is suspended above the ground, by diagonal quarter bars held in place against the cross-trees, themselves resting on brick piers, and that the base of the post is wedged into the centre of the cross-trees, with the wedges used to balance the post and adjust for the varying distribution of weight in the buck as stones, sails and machinery are added or removed.

This myth appeared in several publications, including an untitled leaflet published by St. Stephens Press, Bristol, in the 1950s. (It refers to 1897 as being &quot;53 years ago&quot;, and the cover page bears text that includes &quot;VISITORS to WORTHING should not fail to see THE 200 YEAR OLD WINDMILL With its wonderful Old Wooden Machinery&quot;). According to this leaflet, &quot;The post itself at Salvington is of great interest. About 20 years ago excavations were made at the base of it to discover what means had been used to plant it so firmly in the ground that it had borne the whole weight of the mill and withstood the winter storms for two hundred years. To the surprise of the diggers, 12 feet below the level of the ground, instead of coming to the end of the post, great roots were found stopping further progress, showing that a living oak had been trimmed and made use of as it stood.&quot;

The myth is refuted by Rex Wailes in his article &quot;Some Windmill Fallacies&quot;, published in the 1961 volume of the Transactions of the Newcomen Society of Great Britain.

===The &quot;Worked in 1914&quot; myth===

&quot;The mill is known to have worked again in 1914.&quot;

Brunnarius claims that the mill worked again in 1914, but at that time, the mill was fixed in one position, and the construction of the hexagonal concrete roundhouse prevented the mill from being winded a full 360 degrees. It was not until the restorers removed the corners of the concrete roundhouse in the 1970s, that the mill was able to turn fully. The restored wooden roundhouse, built to the pre-1907 design, which has replaced the concrete roundhouse, allows the mill to be winded 360 degrees. No evidence has been found to support Brunnarius&#x27; claim.

===The &quot;Fantail&quot; myth===

According to the Listed Buildings Register, maintained by English Heritage, the windmill at High Salvington is supposed to have a fantail. This data appears to have made its way into the National Monuments Record, (also maintained by English Heritage), which cites in its notes:

&quot;() Originally Durrington Mill, now usually called Salvington Mill. Post type with round house and fantail. Date 1700 over the door. Machinery of the mill in working order.&quot;

from page 21 of the 21 May 1976 edition of Worthing&#x27;s publication of the List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest.

However, no evidence for this has ever been found, and when it was bought by Worthing Borough Council in 1959, winding the mill, as far as was possible—see The &quot;Worked in 1914&quot; Myth), was achieved by means of pushing on the tail-pole.

Various &quot;old-timers&quot; who helped the High Salvington Mill Trust reported that the inspector who is supposed to have visited the windmill in 1949 never came as far as High Salvington, so perhaps this is the source of the error.

===The private house myth===

The same National Monuments Record also cites a Field Investigator&#x27;s comment, dated from 31 December 1970, which states,

&quot;Mill restored externally and in excellent condition. Now a private house&quot;.

The reference for this is given as F1 ASP 31-12-70.

Although a millers cottage did exist on the site it was demolished some decades ago to make way for access to properties built to the rear of the houses adjacent to the mill. The hexagonal concrete roundhouse of the mill, constructed in 1907/8, was still being used to serve teas in 1970 and there was no living accommodation either then or since.

==Restoration==

Inspection of the mill after the loss of a sail in 1976 revealed that the trestle had been weakened by Death Watch Beetles. The machinery and millstones were removed from the mill and placed in storage. A steel frame was constructed and used to support the mill whilst the trestle and crown tree were replaced. A new diameter brake wheel was constructed and fitted in 1985. One pair of sails was fitted in 1987 The sails were turning in the Great Storm of 1987 although the brake was on. The second pair of sails were fitted in 1988. The roundhouse was rebuilt in 1990 and the restored mill ground for the first time on 4 April 1991.

In 2008 discovery of rope burns on the studding by the spout floor window revealed that this was probably originally a pop-hole through which the brake rope would have been dropped, thus allowing the miller to operate the brake from the side of the mill exterior, rather than from behind the mill, as had been the practice in recent years. The &quot;millwrights&quot; restoration and maintenance volunteer decided to improve the authenticity of the restoration and replace the window with a pop-hole and removable shutter.

In July 2009 scaffolding was erected so that the exterior of the buck could be repainted. Window frames have also been repaired and repainted.

==Description==

&quot;High Salvington Windmill&quot; is a post mill with a single storey roundhouse. The mill rotates on a solid oak post which is in turn supported by a trestle of heavy pine quarter nars supported on two crosstrees, themselves resting on four brick piers. The trestle is protected by a wooden roundhouse, modelled on the pre-1907 structure. On top of the post, a Samson head is fitted and this supports the crown tree—a large, heavy oak timber to which the body of the mill is attached.

The windmill has a pair of common sails and a pair of spring sails, carried by a wooden windshaft with a cast iron poll end. The mill has two pairs of millstones, arranged head and tail. The head stones are Derbyshire Peak stones and used for rough grinding, while the tail stones are made from pieces of French , embedded in plaster of Paris. These millstones were used for fine grinding. Each pair of stones is driven by its own wheel, called the head wheel and tail wheel. The Friends of High Salvington Mill have had to rebuild the head wheel, but the tail wheel, an original of a rare &quot;compass arm&quot; design, is now too fragile to be used for grinding.

Tenter gear is installed to adjust the gap between the stones, and along with the usual system of levers adjustable via a tentering screw, the mill also has a rope attached that allows the miller to lift the half-ton (500 kg) runner stone, while governors adjust to the wind speed and raise or lower the gap accordingly.

==Glynde windpump==
The High Salvington Windmill Trust acquired in late 2007, and completed restoration during 2007–09, the Glynde Windpump, a much smaller hollow post mill. This originally stood at - , it was built in the mid nineteenth century, possibly to supply water to steam engines which powered an aerial ropeway at a nearby quarry, or possibly to raise water from a cutting parallel to a series of lime kilns, for slaking the lime. The rotting remains of the pump were rescued by Andrew Norman who started the restoration, before its acquisition by the High Salvington Mill Trust, which has completed the restoration and installed it beside the existing windmill.

The trestle has been embedded in solid foundations, on which the restored post has been mounted. The buck (body) has been restored and resized according to photographs of the original taken in 1929, and the gear ratio between the windshaft and crankshaft has been adjusted, with a new gear wheel cut. An easily removable roof has been installed and new sails have been designed and constructed. The visually restored windpump was unveiled on Sunday 11 May 2008, during National Mills Weekend.

Errors in construction resulted in a set of rebuilt sails that rotated clockwise. In 2009 the sails have been rebuilt so that they now correctly rotate anti-clockwise. A pump was acquired and in July 2009 it was refitted. Installation of the pump and connection to the con rods take place in August and September 2009, which now allows the Glynde Wind Pump to raise water again for the first time in over fifty years.

==Nutley wind engine==
In 2013, the High Salvington Mill Trust acquired from a farm at Nutley, in many pieces, a steel mast mounted with both a wind engine and above this, a wind generator. The wind generator was a later addition that would have prevented the successful operation of the wind engine.

The original mast was split into two to provide a mast for the separated wind engine and generator. The wind engine is a Hercules oil-bath wind engine with an 8-foot diameter fan. Many parts were missing requiring the maintenance volunteers to research and make new parts. In 2020 a well pump was acquired and fitted to the wind engine.

The wind generator has a 6-foot diameter two-bladed wooden impeller driving a Lucas 24V DC lorry generator capable of very high speeds. The volunteers have built a control box with a series of light bulbs so that the faster the impeller turns, the more lamps are lit, with the full 120 W output lighting all of the bulbs.
==Public access==

High Salvington Windmill is open to the public, from 2:30 pm to 5 pm, every first and third Sunday of the months April through to September, inclusive. Volunteer &quot;millwrights&quot; meet at the site every Thursday evening, from 7 pm until 9 pm, and the first and third Sunday morning of every month throughout the year. All the maintenance and restoration work at the mill is carried out by the volunteers. Organised parties can also arrange to visit the site for guided tours at other times, by arrangement with the Visit organiser .

<text>The O2 Academy Oxford is a night club and live music venue in Oxford, England, operated by Academy Music Group.

Its previous names include the Coop Hall, the Oxford Venue, the Zodiac and the Carling Academy Oxford.

==History==
===Oxford Co-operative Society (1907–1990)===
The red brick building at 190–196 Cowley Road in southeast Oxford was designed by Harry Wilkinson Moore and built in 1907 for the Oxford Co-operative Society. It consisted of a large hall above three shop units. The hall was used for dances, political meetings of the Co-operative Party and live music. The year of construction is visible as a datestone on the front central gable.

===The Oxford Venue (1990–1995)===
The hall was sold in 1990 and converted into the Oxford Venue. Oxford band Radiohead played there and the video for their 1992 hit &quot;Creep&quot; was shot there.

===The Zodiac (1995–2007)===
In November 1995 it was refurbished and reopened as The Zodiac under new owners Adrian Hicks and Nick Moorbath, both formerly sound engineers and promoters working at the Oxford Venue. Moorbath was also a session keyboardist who played with Ride and Hurricane #1. The refit was partly funded by Radiohead and Supergrass. Moorbath was also involved in organising Radiohead&#x27;s homecoming performance in South Park, Oxford in July 2001. In November 2006 it was announced that Moorbath and Hicks had agreed to sell the club to the Academy Music Group. The Zodiac&#x27;s last night on 17 May 2007 featured several Oxford bands, including ones that reformed for the night, including The Candyskins and Unbelievable Truth. The commercial takeover of the city&#x27;s largest independent music venue inspired &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;, a documentary film about the Oxford music scene.

===Academy Oxford (since 2007)===
Academy Music Group refurbished the site over several months, increasing its capacity from 750 to 1,150 people and reopening as the Carling Academy Oxford. The sponsorship of the Academy Music Group by the Carling beer brand was succeeded by an agreement with telecommunications firm O2. The venue was rebranded as the O2 Academy Oxford with effect from 1 January 2009.

<doc id="1252908" wikidata="Q2342943" url="?curid=1252908" title="Perry White">
<text>Perry White is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He is the editor-in-chief of the Metropolis newspaper the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. The character maintains very high ethical and journalistic standards and is an archetypal image of the tough, irascible, but fair-minded boss.

In film, the character has been portrayed by Pierre Watkin in the &quot;Superman&quot; serial, Jackie Cooper in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and its sequels, Frank Langella in &quot;Superman Returns,&quot; Laurence Fishburne in the DC Extended Universe, and Wendell Pierce in the upcoming DC Universe (DCU) film &quot;Superman&quot; (2025). In television, John Hamilton and Lane Smith played the character in &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; and &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, respectively, Michael McKean in &quot;Smallville&quot;, and Paul Jarrett in the series &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;.

==Publication history==
The character Perry White was created for the radio serial &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, voiced by actor Julian Noa. He first appeared in the second episode, &quot;Clark Kent, Reporter&quot;, which aired on February 14, 1940. The character was introduced into the comic books later that year, appearing in &quot;Superman&quot; #7 (November 1940). Since then, the character has continued to appear in Superman and other comic books on a continual basis, and has been a regular supporting character in both live-action and animated films and television programs over eight decades.

He frequently exclaims, &quot;Great Caesar&#x27;s ghost!&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t call me chief!&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==

===Golden and Silver Age===
The earliest &quot;Superman&quot; comics depict Clark Kent and Lois Lane working for the newspaper the &quot;Daily Star&quot; under editor George Taylor. However, after Perry White&#x27;s introduction in the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; radio series, the character was incorporated into the comic books, appearing as the editor of a newly renamed the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. No in-story explanation for this change was given at the time, and Taylor and the Daily Star are not mentioned again for many years.

Following the introduction of the multiverse, Taylor and the &quot;Daily Star&quot; are retroactively placed on Earth-Two, while White and the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; are placed on Earth-One. Additionally, White is established as having an Earth-Two counterpart who is a reporter for the &quot;Daily Star&quot;.

Prior to the continuity changes detailed in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;, and other comics published after 1986, Perry White is depicted as a freelance reporter for various newspapers, including a Chicago newspaper and Gotham City&#x27;s &quot;Gotham Gazette&quot;. In &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, it was also established that White had a law degree but had never practiced law.

White eventually goes to work at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; as a reporter and earns his first Pulitzer Prize following an interview with Superboy.

Later, Perry&#x27;s reporting skills earn further praise after he is the first to discover that Superboy has moved to Metropolis from Smallville. (Superboy had intended to keep his move quiet for an undefined period of time, so as not to alert anyone to Superboy and Clark Kent leaving Smallville at the same time.)

Finally, during Clark Kent&#x27;s junior year of college, White becomes editor-in-chief following George Taylor&#x27;s retirement.

In the early 1970s, Morgan Edge buys the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, taking most of White&#x27;s position.

===Post-Crisis (1986–2011)===
With writer John Byrne&#x27;s post-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; revamp of Superman&#x27;s origin in the &quot;Man of Steel&quot; miniseries and his subsequent Superman comics, Perry White&#x27;s history was altered and fleshed out more fully.

Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, White was born in Metropolis&#x27; Suicide Slum area, growing up with a father missing in action in an overseas war. White attends school with Lex Luthor and begins his career as a copy boy at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.

After Luthor becomes a successful businessman, he diversifies his holdings in LexCorp and temporarily buys the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Turning down an offer from Luthor to become part of Luthor&#x27;s new television station WLEX, White finds an investor who saves the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; on the condition that White becomes managing editor. The incident leaves White bitter and angry with Luthor.

White marries Alice Spencer and has a son, Jerry White. Much later, after Jerry is fully grown, Perry learns that Luthor is Jerry&#x27;s biological father. Although Perry continues to raise Jerry as his own, the knowledge that he is not the boy&#x27;s true father continues to haunt him.

In subsequent years as managing editor and then editor-in-chief of &quot;The Daily Planet&quot;, White forms a core team of reporters and writers: Lois Lane, Clark Kent, Jimmy Olsen, Cat Grant, Ron Troupe, Steve Lombard, and many others. The &quot;Planet&quot;, meanwhile, is established as a paper of record, breaking such stories as Superman&#x27;s debut, multiple alien invasions, and the death and subsequent return of Superman. During this time, White becomes increasingly estranged from Jerry, who later dies from a gunshot wound. Perry and Alice grieve for some time, resulting in Perry taking a leave of absence from the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.

Later, the Whites adopt an orphaned African-American boy named Keith Parks, who soon has his name changed to Keith White. During this time, Perry takes another leave of absence for cancer treatment, putting Clark Kent in charge as the &quot;Planet&quot;&#x27;s temporary editor.

During a period of financial struggle for the &quot;Planet,&quot; its owner, Franklin Stern, sells the paper back to Luthor. Luthor, acting out of malice, shuts the paper down and fires everyone except Lane, Olsen, and two others who are forced to accept new jobs at Lexcom, Luthor&#x27;s new Internet-based news company. Shortly thereafter, Luthor sells the &quot;Planet&quot; to Bruce Wayne for one dollar. Wayne rehires White and gives him full control of the &quot;Planet&quot;, enabling him to undo Luthor&#x27;s meddling and resolve the company&#x27;s financial problems.

===New 52===
When Superman&#x27;s identity is exposed by Lois to protect Clark from being blackmailed by a secret conspiracy, Perry fires Clark in a fury of anger and perceived betrayal, accusing Clark of only working at the &quot;Planet&quot; so that he can profit from his own headlines. 

When the Superman of this reality dies, he is replaced by his predecessor from the pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; universe, while Mister Mxyzptlk uses his powers to impersonate Clark Kent and convince everyone that the previous revelation of Superman&#x27;s identity was an elaborate hoax. This storyline culminates in the displaced Lois and Clark merging with their counterparts in this universe, creating a new timeline where Lois and Clark leave the &quot;Planet&quot; to raise their newborn son Jon Kent. 

Superman later confesses his secret identity to White, but Manchester Black erases this knowledge from him and the public soon after.

<text>The Simultaneous Man is a 1970 science fiction novel by Ralph Blum, where brainwashing and psychosurgery techniques are used to create a copy of the experiences and memories of one person in the body of another.

==Plot summary==

The book&#x27;s protagonist is Andrew Horne (nicknamed &quot;Bear&quot;), a Russian-born U.S. scientist, who works at &quot;West Wing&quot; on &quot;Project Beta&quot;, a secret government mind-control project, which aims to perfect the art of brainwashing until it is possible to completely re-make a person&#x27;s mind and soul. The Project operates on hopeless cases from psychiatric wards, and &quot;prison-volunteers&quot; who would otherwise be executed.

The Project&#x27;s first Remake having failed disastrously, it is decided to base the second Remake on the mind of Horne himself. The prison-volunteer chosen for the Remake is a Black soldier, now referred to as &quot;Prisvol 233/234&quot;, who has killed an officer and been sentenced to death. The project first uses ultrasound to destroy his access to his old memories, and then, having washed the slate clean, exposes him to immersive movie reenactments of Horne&#x27;s childhood, college days, war service, and entry into the Project. (As this is performed, the reader discovers that Horne himself was on the receiving end of torture and brainwashing in the Korean War, which he fought against by creating a &quot;false self&quot; which he betrays to the enemy, the &quot;Lieutenant Kijé defense&quot;). At the end of the process, 233/234, now known as &quot;Black Bear&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, for all intents and purposes, Andrew Horne in a new body.

However, when Security realizes that Black Bear also has all of Horne&#x27;s secret knowledge and considers him a security risk, it sets off a chain of events where their mirror image identities will lead both Black Bear and Horne to &quot;East Wing&quot; in Russia.

<doc id="1252913" wikidata="Q2017624" url="?curid=1252913" title="Thermionic converter">
<text>A thermionic converter consists of a hot electrode which thermionically emits electrons over a potential energy barrier to a cooler electrode, producing a useful electric power output. Caesium vapor is used to optimize the electrode work functions and provide an ion supply (by surface ionization or electron impact ionization in a plasma) to neutralize the electron space charge.

== Definition ==
From a physical electronic viewpoint, thermionic energy conversion is the direct production of electric power from heat by thermionic electron emission. From a thermodynamic viewpoint, it is the use of electron vapor as the working fluid in a power-producing cycle. A thermionic converter consists of a hot emitter electrode from which electrons are vaporized by thermionic emission and a colder collector electrode into which they are condensed after conduction through the inter-electrode plasma. The resulting current, typically several amperes per square centimeter of emitter surface, delivers electrical power to a load at a typical potential difference of 0.5–1 volt and thermal efficiency of 5–20%, depending on the emitter temperature (1500–2000 K) and mode of operation.

== History ==

After the first demonstration of the practical arc-mode caesium vapor thermionic converter by V. Wilson in 1957, several applications of it were demonstrated in the following decade, including its use with solar, combustion, radioisotope, and nuclear reactor heat sources. The application most seriously pursued, however, was the integration of thermionic nuclear fuel elements directly into the core of nuclear reactors for production of electrical power in space. The exceptionally high operating temperature of thermionic converters, which makes their practical use difficult in other applications, gives the thermionic converter decisive advantages over competing energy conversion technologies in the space power application where radiant heat rejection is required. Substantial thermionic space reactor development programs were conducted in the U.S., France, and Germany in the period 1963–1973, and the US resumed a significant thermionic nuclear fuel element development program in the period 1983–1993.

Thermionic power systems were used in combination with various nuclear reactors (BES-5, TOPAZ) as electrical power supply on a number of Soviet military surveillance satellites between 1967 and 1988.
See Kosmos 954 for more details.

Although the priority for thermionic reactor use diminished as the US and Russian space programs were curtailed, research and technology development in thermionic energy conversion have continued. In recent years technology development programs for solar-heated thermionic space power systems were conducted. Prototype combustion-heated thermionic systems for domestic heat and electric power cogeneration, and for rectification, have been developed.

== Description ==
The scientific aspects of thermionic energy conversion primarily concern the fields of surface physics and plasma physics. The electrode surface properties determine the magnitude of electron emission current and electric potential at the electrode surfaces, and the plasma properties determine the transport of electron current from the emitter to the collector. All practical thermionic converters to date employ caesium vapor between the electrodes, which determines both the surface and plasma properties. Caesium is employed because it is the most easily ionized of all stable elements.

A thermionic generator is like a cyclic heat engine and its maximum efficiency is limited by Carnot&#x27;s law. It is a low-Voltage high current device where current densities of 25–50 (A/squarecm) have been achieved at voltage from 1–2V. The energy of high temperature gases can be partly converted into electricity if the riser tubes of the boiler are provided cathode and anode of a thermionic generator with the interspace filled with ionized caesium vapor.

The surface property of primary interest is the work function, which is the barrier that limits electron emission current from the surface and essentially is the heat of vaporization of electrons from the surface. The work function is determined primarily by a layer of caesium atoms adsorbed on the electrode surfaces. The properties of the interelectrode plasma are determined by the mode of operation of the thermionic converter. In the ignited (or &quot;arc&quot;) mode the plasma is maintained via ionization internally by hot plasma electrons (~ 3300 K); in the unignited mode the plasma is maintained via injection of externally produced positive ions into a cold plasma; in the hybrid mode the plasma is maintained by ions from a hot-plasma interelectrode region transferred into a cold-plasma interelectrode region.

==Recent work==
All the applications cited above have employed technology in which the basic physical understanding and performance of the thermionic converter were essentially the same as those achieved before 1970. During the period from 1973 to 1983, however, significant research on advanced low-temperature thermionic converter technology for fossil-fueled industrial and commercial electric power production was conducted in the US, and continued until 1995 for possible space reactor and naval reactor applications. That research has shown that substantial improvements in converter performance can be obtained now at lower operating temperatures by addition of oxygen to the caesium vapor, by suppression of electron reflection at the electrode surfaces, and by hybrid mode operation. Similarly, improvements via use of oxygen-containing electrodes have been demonstrated in Russia along with design studies of systems employing the advanced thermionic converter performance. Recent studies have shown that excited Cs-atoms in thermionic converters form clusters of Cs-Rydberg matter which yield a decrease of collector emitting work function from 1.5 eV to 1.0 – 0.7 eV. Due to long-lived nature of Rydberg matter this low work function remains low for a long time which essentially increases the low-temperature converter’s efficiency.

It is the fourth installment in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series and a sequel to &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989). Set in 1957, it pits Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) against Soviet KGB agents led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) searching for a telepathic crystal skull located in Peru.
Jones is aided by his former lover, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and their son, Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). Ray Winstone, John Hurt, and Jim Broadbent are also part of the supporting cast.

Jeb Stuart, Jeffrey Boam, Frank Darabont, Lucas, and Nathanson wrote drafts before Koepp&#x27;s script satisfied the producers. The filmmakers intended to pay tribute to the science fiction B movies in the 1950s. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, at various locations in New Mexico, New Haven, Connecticut, Hawaii, and Fresno, California, as well as on sound stages in Los Angeles. To maintain aesthetic continuity with the previous films, the crew relied on traditional stunt work instead of computer-generated stunt doubles, and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński studied Douglas Slocombe&#x27;s style from the previous films.

&quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; had its premiere at the 61st Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 22, by Paramount Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics but mixed responses from audiences. The film was also a financial success, grossing over $786 million worldwide which makes it the franchise&#x27;s highest-grossing film (when not adjusted for inflation) as well as the second-highest-grossing film of 2008.

&quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; is the last film in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise to be distributed by Paramount, as the Walt Disney Studios acquired rights to future films following the parent company&#x27;s acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012, with Paramount still retaining the rights to the original four films and receiving &quot;financial participation&quot; from any additional properties. It is also the last film in the series for which Spielberg and Lucas are credited with the direction and story, respectively. A sequel concluding the saga, titled &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot;, was released on June 30, 2023.

==Plot==

In 1957, Soviet agents led by Colonel Doctor Irina Spalko kidnap American archeologist Indiana Jones and his partner George &quot;Mac&quot; McHale. They infiltrate Hangar 51 in Nevada and use Jones to locate a mummified alien from the Roswell incident. Jones locates the mummy before being double-crossed by Mac, but escapes to a nearby model town at the Nevada Test Site, minutes before an atomic bomb test. He survives the blast in a lead-lined refrigerator in one of the town&#x27;s mock houses before being rescued and interrogated by the FBI.

Returning to Marshall College, Jones discovers he has been placed on an indefinite leave of absence. Mutt Williams, a young greaser, approaches Jones and informs him that his former colleague, Harold &quot;Ox&quot; Oxley, found a crystal skull in Peru in search of the mythical city Akator. Soviet agents attempt to capture them, but the two escape and travel to Peru. There, they find carvings made by Ox which lead the pair to the grave of Francisco de Orellana, which contains an elongated crystal skull. Leaving the grave, the two are captured by the Soviets and taken to a camp in the Amazon rainforest. They are reunited with Mac, Spalko, an addled Ox, and Mutt&#x27;s mother, Marion Ravenwood, who informs Jones that Mutt is his son. Spalko tells Jones that the skulls are alien in origin and intends to use them to project Soviet propaganda into the minds of Americans. Jones has a brief telepathic connection to the skull, which commands him to return it to Akator. Jones realizes that Ox is attempting to communicate through automatic writing, discovering a route to the city.

While en route to Akator, Jones retakes the skull from the Soviets and escapes from them alongside Marion, Ox, Mutt and Mac, who claims to be a double agent, all the while leaving a trail for Spalko. Jones and his companions locate Akator, where they learn that the skull belonged to one of thirteen &quot;interdimensional beings&quot; whom the early Ugha tribes worshipped as deities. Spalko catches up and returns the skull to its skeleton, which comes to life and offers Spalko the reward of omniscience. As an interdimensional portal opens above the chamber, abducting Mac and Spalko’s remaining soldiers, the skeletons combine into a reanimated alien, who transfers an overwhelming amount of knowledge into Spalko&#x27;s mind, vaporizing her. Jones, Ox, Marion and Mutt escape the crumbling city as a flying saucer rises from the ruins and departs for another dimension. As Ox regains his sanity, Jones and his party return to the United States where he is reinstated at Marshall College and promoted to associate dean. Jones and Marion marry each other.

==Cast==

* Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones; To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent three hours a day at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series&#x27; hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He performed many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. Ford felt his return would also help American culture be less paranoid about aging (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film&#x27;s family appeal: &quot;This is a movie which is geared not to [the young] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment [...] We&#x27;ve got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints.&quot; He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: &quot;When a guy gets to be that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs just as fast and climbs just as high, he&#x27;s gonna be breathing a little heavier at the end of the set piece. And I felt, &#x27;Let&#x27;s have some fun with that. Let&#x27;s not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in &quot;Raiders&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s not the years, it&#x27;s the mileage,&quot; and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; and &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;.
* Cate Blanchett as Irina Spalko, the Soviet agent who is the main antagonist of the film. Screenwriter David Koepp created the character. Frank Marshall said Irina continued the tradition of Indiana having a love-hate relationship &quot;with every woman he ever comes in contact with&quot;. Blanchett had wanted to play a villain for a &quot;couple of years&quot;, and enjoyed being part of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; legacy as she loved the previous films. Spielberg praised Blanchett as a &quot;master of disguise&quot;, and considers her his favorite &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; villain for coming up with much of Irina&#x27;s characteristics. Irina&#x27;s bob cut was her idea, with the character&#x27;s stern looks and behavior recalling Rosa Klebb in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. Blanchett learned to fence for the character, but during filming, Spielberg decided to give Irina &quot;karate chop&quot; skills. LaBeouf recalled Blanchett was elusive on set, and Ford was surprised when he met her on set outside of costume. He noted, &quot;There&#x27;s no aspect of her behavior that was not consistent with this bizarre person she&#x27;s playing.&quot;
* Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood (under the married name of Marion Williams). Frank Darabont&#x27;s script introduced the idea of Marion Ravenwood returning as Indy&#x27;s love interest. Allen was not aware her character was in the script until Spielberg called her in January 2007, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s been announced! We&#x27;re gonna make &quot;Indiana Jones 4&quot;! And guess what? You&#x27;re in it!&quot; Ford found Allen &quot;one of the easiest people to work with [he&#x27;s] ever known. She&#x27;s a completely self-sufficient woman, and that&#x27;s part of the character she plays. A lot of her charm and the charm of the character is there. And again, it&#x27;s not an age-dependent thing. It has to do with her spirit and her nature.&quot; Allen found Ford easier to work with on this film, in contrast to the first film, where she slowly befriended the private actor.
* Ray Winstone as George &quot;Mac&quot; McHale, a British agent whom Indy worked alongside in World War II, but has now allied with the Russians due to his financial problems. The character acts as a spin on Sallah and René Belloq – Indy&#x27;s friend and nemesis, respectively, in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Spielberg cast Winstone as he found him &quot;one of the most brilliant actors around&quot;, having seen &quot;Sexy Beast&quot;. Winstone tore his hamstring during filming. &quot;I keep getting these action parts as I&#x27;m getting older,&quot; he remarked. Like John Hurt, Winstone wished to see the script prior to committing to the film. In interviews on British TV Winstone explained that he was only able to read the script if it was delivered by courier, who waited while he read the script, and returned to the US with the script once Winstone had read it. His reasoning for wanting to read the script was, &quot;If I&#x27;m gonna be in it, I want to &quot;be&quot; in it.&quot; He gave suggestions to Spielberg, including the idea of Mac pretending to be a double agent. He also stated that once filming was completed he had to return the script, such was the secrecy about the film. He was later presented with a copy of the script to keep.
* John Hurt as Harold &#x27;Ox&#x27; Oxley, Mutt&#x27;s surrogate father and an old friend of Indiana, whom he lost contact with in 1937. Six months prior to the events of the film, he went insane after discovering the crystal skull, which commanded him to return it to Akator. Frank Darabont had suggested Hurt when he was writing the screenplay. The character is inspired by Ben Gunn from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. Hurt wanted to read the script before signing on, unlike other cast members who came on &quot;because Steven—you know, &#x27;God&#x27;—was doing it. And I said, &#x27;Well, I need to have a little bit of previous knowledge even if God is doing it.&#x27; So they sent a courier over with the script from Los Angeles, gave it to me at three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon in London, collected it again at eight o&#x27;clock in the evening, and he returned the next day to Los Angeles.&quot;
* Jim Broadbent as Dean Charlie Stanforth, Dean of Marshall College and friend of Indy. Broadbent&#x27;s character stands in for Marcus Brody, as actor Denholm Elliott had died in 1992. As a tribute to Elliott, the filmmakers put a portrait and a statue on the Marshall College location, and a picture on Indy&#x27;s desk, saying he died shortly after Henry.
* Shia LaBeouf as Mutt Williams/Henry Jones III, a young, motorcycle-riding greaser and Indy&#x27;s sidekick and son. The concept of Indiana Jones having offspring was introduced in &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, in which Old Indy is shown to have a daughter. During development of &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, this idea was incorporated into Frank Darabont&#x27;s script, with Indiana and Marion having a 13-year-old daughter. However, Spielberg found this too similar to &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, so a son was created instead. Koepp credited the character&#x27;s creation to Jeff Nathanson and Lucas. Koepp wanted to make Mutt into a nerd, but Lucas refused, explaining he had to resemble Marlon Brando in &quot;The Wild One&quot;; &quot;he needs to be what Indiana Jones&#x27;s father thought of [him]—the curse returns in the form of his own son—he&#x27;s everything a father can&#x27;t stand&quot;. LaBeouf was Spielberg&#x27;s first choice for the role, having been impressed by his performance in &quot;Holes&quot;. Excited at the prospect of being in an &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film, LaBeouf signed on without reading the script and did not know what character he would play. He worked out and gained of muscle for the role, and also repeatedly watched the other films to get into character. LaBeouf also watched &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; and &quot;The Wild One&quot; to get into his character&#x27;s mindset, copying mannerisms and words from characters in those films, such as the use of a switchblade as a weapon. Lucas also consulted on the greaser look, joking that LaBeouf was &quot;sent to the &quot;American Graffiti&quot; school of greaserland&quot;. LaBeouf pulled his rotator cuff when filming his duel with Spalko, which was his first injury in his career, an injury which worsened throughout filming. He later pulled his groin.

Additionally, Igor Jijikine portrays Russian Colonel Antonin Dovchenko, Spalko&#x27;s second-in-command. His character stands in for the heavily built henchmen that Pat Roach played in the three previous films, as Roach died in 2004 from throat cancer. Joel Stoffer and Neil Flynn have minor roles as FBI agents Taylor and Paul Smith interrogating Indiana in a scene following the opening sequence. Alan Dale plays General Ross, who protests Indiana&#x27;s innocence. Andrew Divoff and Pasha D. Lychnikoff play Soviet agents Grant and Roosevelt, respectively. Spielberg cast Russian-speaking actors so their accents would be authentic. Ilia Volok and Dimitri Diatchenko play Russian Suit and Spalko&#x27;s right-hand man Dimitri who battle Indiana at Marshall College. Diatchenko bulked up to 250 pounds to look menacing, and his role was originally minor with 10 days of filming. When shooting the fight, Ford accidentally hit his chin, and Spielberg liked Diatchenko&#x27;s humorous looking reaction, so he expanded his role to three months of filming. Ernie Reyes Jr. plays a cemetery guard. Chet Hanks plays Student in Library.

Sean Connery turned down an offer to cameo as Henry Jones Sr., as he found retirement too enjoyable. Lucas stated that in hindsight it was good that Connery did not briefly appear, as it would disappoint the audience when his character would not join the film&#x27;s adventure. Ford joked, &quot;I&#x27;m old enough to play my own father in this one.&quot; Connery later admitted that his true reason for turning the part down was that it was too small, stating: &quot;It was not that generous a part, worth getting back into the harness and go for. And they had taken the story in a different line anyway, so the father of Indy was kind of really not that important. I had suggested they kill him in the movie, it would have taken care of it better.&quot; The film addresses Connery&#x27;s absence by Indiana implying that both Henry, Sr. and Marcus Brody (played in the previous films by Denholm Elliott, who died in 1992) died before the film&#x27;s events, and briefly shows Connery as Henry Jones Sr. in a picture in Indiana Jones&#x27;s office. Connery later stated that he liked the film, praising it as &quot;rather good&quot; but also &quot;rather long.&quot; Michael Sheard, who portrayed Adolf Hitler in the third film, expressed interest in appearing in the film, but he died in August 2005.

John Rhys-Davies was asked to reprise his role as Sallah as a guest in the wedding scene. He turned it down as he felt his character deserved a more substantial role.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1979, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg made a deal with Paramount Pictures for five &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films. Following the 1989 release of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, Lucas let the series end as he felt he could not think of a good plot device to drive the next installment. He chose instead to produce the prequel television series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;. The following year, Harrison Ford would express his feelings that, while he was uncertain on if the Indiana Jones character had been fully explored or not, he had the impression that &quot;Last Crusade&quot; would be the final &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film and that, as much he enjoyed playing Jones, he felt that a trilogy was enough, though he wouldn&#x27;t rule out working with Lucas and Spielberg again. Comic book writer Lee Marrs claimed in a 2023 interview with the IndyCast podcast that Lucasfilm Ltd. was considering to make a continuation to the film series by bringing River Phoenix back as a younger Indy, hence why Dark Horse Comics hoped to keep running their &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; comic book line, though Phoenix&#x27;s death in 1993 put an end to such possibility.

As &quot;Young Indy&quot; aired, Ford played Jones in one episode, narrating his adventures in 1920 Chicago from 1950 Wyoming. When Lucas shot Ford&#x27;s role in December 1992, he realized the scene opened up the possibility of a film with an older Indiana set in the 1950s. The film could reflect a science fiction 1950s B-movie, with aliens as the plot device. Just like how the 1930s Saturday matinée serials inspired the first three &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films as well as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Lucas felt that B-movies such as &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (1951), &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot; (1953) and &quot;Them!&quot; (1954) could give them a whole new film genre to play with and add a new texture to the story, giving him the idea of using extraterrestrials. Meanwhile, Spielberg believed he was going to mature as a filmmaker after making the trilogy and felt his role in any future installments would be relegated to that of mere producer. Ford told Lucas, &quot;No way am I being in a Steven Spielberg movie like that&quot;. Spielberg himself, who depicted aliens in &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977) and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), resisted it.

Perceiving that Ford and Spielberg opined that the film was too much an obvious Lucas-Spielbergian idea, Lucas personally felt that Ford and Spielberg didn&#x27;t fully understand the franchise&#x27;s malleability; instead of doing the exact same movie all the time, all they had to do was to test different genres with each installment and it wouldn&#x27;t stop being an adventure of the title character looking after some artifact as long it were a believable MacGuffin with an archaeological or historical background. He came up with a story, which Jeb Stuart turned into a script from October 1993 to May 1994. (Stuart had previously written 1993&#x27;s &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, which starred Ford.) Lucas wanted Indiana to get married, which would allow Henry Jones, Sr. to return, expressing concern over whether his son is happy with what he has accomplished. After he learned that Joseph Stalin was interested in psychic warfare, he decided to have Soviets as the villains and the aliens to have psychic powers. Following Stuart&#x27;s next draft, Lucas hired &quot;Last Crusade&quot; writer Jeffrey Boam to write the next three versions, the last of which was completed in March 1996. Three months later, &quot;Independence Day&quot; was released, and Spielberg told Lucas he would not make another alien invasion film. Lucas decided to focus on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels.

In a 2000 interview, Spielberg said that his children constantly asked when he would make the next &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film, and that the project would soon be revived. The same year, Ford, Lucas, Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy met during the American Film Institute&#x27;s tribute to Ford, and decided they wanted to enjoy the experience of making an &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film again. Spielberg also found returning to the series a respite from his many dark films during this period, such as &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; (2001), &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), and &quot;Munich&quot; (2005). Lucas convinced Spielberg to use aliens in the plot by saying they were not &quot;extraterrestrials&quot;, but &quot;interdimensional&quot;, with this concept taking inspiration in the superstring theory. Spielberg and Lucas discussed the central idea of a B-movie involving aliens, and Lucas suggested using the crystal skulls to ground the idea. Lucas found those artifacts as fascinating as the Ark of the Covenant, and had intended to feature them for a &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot; episode before the show&#x27;s cancellation. M. Night Shyamalan was hired to write for an intended 2002 shoot, but he was overwhelmed writing a sequel to a film he loved like &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), and claimed it was difficult to get Ford, Spielberg and Lucas to focus. Stephen Gaghan and Tom Stoppard were also approached.

Frank Darabont, who wrote various &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot; episodes, was hired to write in May 2002. His script, entitled &quot;Indiana Jones and the City of Gods&quot;, was set in the 1950s, with ex-Nazis pursuing Jones. Spielberg conceived the idea because of real life figures such as Juan Perón in Argentina, who protected Nazi war criminals. Darabont claimed Spielberg loved the script, but Lucas had issues with it, and decided to take over writing himself. Lucas and Spielberg acknowledged the 1950s setting could not ignore the Cold War, and the Soviets were more plausible villains. Spielberg decided he could not satirize the Nazis after directing &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993), while Ford noted, &quot;We plum[b] wore the Nazis out&quot;.

Jeff Nathanson met with Spielberg and Lucas in August 2004 and turned in the next drafts in October and November 2005, titled &quot;The Atomic Ants&quot;. David Koepp continued on from there, giving his script the subtitle &quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot;, based on the J. Robert Oppenheimer quote. It was changed to &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, as Spielberg found it more inviting a title and actually named the plot device of the crystal skulls. Lucas insisted on the &quot;Kingdom&quot; part. Koepp&#x27;s &quot;bright [title] idea&quot; was &quot;Indiana Jones and the Son of Indiana Jones&quot;, and Spielberg had also considered having the title name the aliens as &quot;The Mysterians&quot; (1957), but dropped that when he remembered that was another film&#x27;s title. Koepp collaborated with &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan on the film&#x27;s &quot;love dialogue&quot;.

===Filming===

Unlike the previous films, Spielberg shot the entire film in the United States, stating he did not want to be away from his family. Principal photography began on June 18, 2007, in Deming, New Mexico. An extensive chase scene set at the fictional Marshall College was filmed between June 28 and July 7 at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut (where Spielberg&#x27;s son Theo was studying). To keep in line with the fact the story takes place in the 1950s, several facades were changed, although signs were put up in between shots to tell the public what the store or restaurant actually was.

Afterwards, they filmed scenes set in the Amazon jungle in Hilo, Hawaii until August. &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; was the biggest film shot in Hawaii since &quot;Waterworld&quot; (1995), and was estimated to generate US$22 million to $45 million in the local economy. Because of an approaching hurricane, Spielberg was unable to shoot a fight at a waterfall, so he sent the second unit to film shots of Brazil&#x27;s and Argentina&#x27;s Iguazu Falls. These were digitally combined into the fight, which was shot at the Universal backlot.

Half the film was scheduled to shoot on five sound stages at Los Angeles: Downey, Sony, Warner Bros., Paramount and Universal. Filming moved to Chandler Field in Fresno, California, substituting for Mexico City International Airport, on October 11, 2007. After shooting aerial shots of Chandler Airport and a DC-3 on the morning of October 12, 2007, filming wrapped. Although he originally found no need for re-shoots after viewing his first cut of the film, Spielberg decided to add an establishing shot filmed on February 29, 2008, in Pasadena, California.

===Design===
Spielberg and Janusz Kamiński, who has shot all of the director&#x27;s films since &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, reviewed the previous films to study Douglas Slocombe&#x27;s style. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want Janusz to modernize and bring us into the 21st century&quot;, Spielberg explained. &quot;I still wanted the film to have a lighting style not dissimilar to the work Doug Slocombe had achieved, which meant that both Janusz and I had to swallow our pride. Janusz had to approximate another cinematographer&#x27;s look, and I had to approximate this younger director&#x27;s look that I thought I had moved away from after almost two decades&quot;. Spielberg also hired production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas after admiring his design work for &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006). Spielberg did not want to fast cut action scenes, relying on his script instead for a fast pace, and had confirmed in 2002 that he would not shoot the film digitally, a format Lucas had adopted for &quot;Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and &quot;Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005). Lucas felt &quot;it looks like it was shot three years after &quot;Last Crusade&quot;. The people, the look of it, everything. You&#x27;d never know there was 20 years between shooting&quot;. Kamiński commented upon watching the three films back-to-back, he was amazed how each of them advanced technologically, but were all nevertheless consistent, neither too brightly or darkly lit. Stan Winston helped supervise the special effects that went into the designs of the interdimensional beings.

While shooting &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (2005) in late 2004, Spielberg met with the film&#x27;s stunt coordinator and second unit director Vic Armstrong, who doubled for Ford in the previous films, to discuss three action sequences he had envisioned. However, Armstrong was busy filming second unit footage under Rob Cohen for &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot; (2008) during shooting of &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, so Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director instead. Bradley and Spielberg used previsualization for all the action scenes, except the motorcycle chase at Marshall College, because that idea was conceived after the animators had left. Bradley drew traditional storyboards instead, and was given free rein to create dramatic moments, just as Michael D. Moore did when directing second unit for the original trilogy, such as the truck chase in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Spielberg improvised on set, changing the location of Mutt and Spalko&#x27;s duel from the ground to on top of vehicles.

The Ark of the Covenant is seen in a broken crate during the Hangar 51 opening sequence. Lucasfilm used the same prop from &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Guards were hired to protect the highly sought-after piece of film memorabilia during the day of its use. A replica of the staff carried by Charlton Heston in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956) was also used to populate the set to illustrate the hangar&#x27;s history.

===Effects===

Marshall stated in 2003 that the film would use traditional stunt work so as to be consistent with the previous films. CGI was used to remove the visible safety wires on the actors when they did their stunts, such as when Indy swings on a lamp with his whip. Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana drives a truck through crates. During the take, an explosive failed to detonate and landed in the seat beside Ford. It did not go off and he was not injured.

Spielberg stated before production began that very few CGI effects would be used to maintain consistency with the other films. During filming significantly more CGI work was done than initially anticipated as in many cases it proved to be more practical. There ended up being a total of about 450 CGI shots in the film, with an estimated 30% of the film&#x27;s shots containing CG matte paintings. Spielberg initially wanted brushstrokes to be visible on the paintings for added consistency with the previous films, but decided against it. The script also required a non-deforested jungle for a chase scene, but this would have been unsafe and much CGI work was done to create the jungle action sequence. Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman, who worked on Lucas&#x27; &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) and &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) as well as Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Munich&quot;, traveled to Brazil and Argentina to photograph elements that were composited into the final images. Industrial Light and Magic then effectively created a virtual jungle with a geography like the real Amazon.

The appearance of a live alien and flying saucer was in flux. Spielberg wanted the alien to resemble a Grey alien, and also rejected early versions of the saucer that looked &quot;too &quot;Close Encounters&quot;&quot;. Art director Christian Alzmann said the esthetic was &quot;looking at a lot of older B-movie designs—but trying to make that look more real and gritty to fit in with the Indy universe&quot;. Other reference for the visual effects work included government tapes of nuclear tests, and video reference of real prairie dogs shot in 1080p by Nathan Edward Denning.

===Music===
John Williams began composing the score in October 2007; 10 days of recording sessions wrapped on March 6, 2008, at Sony Pictures Studios. Williams described composing for the Indiana Jones universe again as &quot;like sitting down and finishing a letter that you started 25 years ago&quot;. He reused Indiana&#x27;s theme (&quot;The Raiders March&quot;) and also Marion&#x27;s from &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, and also composed five new motifs for Mutt, Spalko and the skull. Williams gave Mutt&#x27;s a swashbuckling feel, and homaged film noir and 1950s B-movies for Spalko and the crystal skull respectively. The movie&#x27;s first scene is accompanied by Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1956 version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, arguably the biggest hit of the movie&#x27;s era, and an RIAA-certified 4× Platinum recording. As an in-joke, Williams incorporated a measure and a half of Johannes Brahms&#x27; &quot;Academic Festival Overture&quot; when Indiana and Mutt crash into the library. The soundtrack features a Continuum, an instrument often used for sound effects instead of music. The Concord Music Group released the soundtrack on May 20, 2008.

==Release==
&quot;The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2008, a couple of days ahead of its worldwide May 21–23 release. It was the first Spielberg film since 1982&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; to premiere at Cannes. The film was released in approximately 4,000 theaters in the United States, and dubbed into 25 languages for its worldwide release. More than 12,000 release prints were distributed, which is the largest in Paramount Pictures&#x27; history. Although Spielberg insisted his films only be watched traditionally using a film projector at theaters, Paramount chose to release the film in digital cinemas as part of a scheme to convert 10,000 U.S. cinemas to the format. &quot;The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; is also notable for being the last film in the series to be distributed by Paramount, as Walt Disney Studios released the fifth film on June 30, 2023, since its parent company&#x27;s acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012.

===Secrecy===
Frank Marshall remarked, &quot;In today&#x27;s information age, secrecy has been a real challenge. ... People actually said, &#x27;No, we&#x27;re going to respect Steven&#x27;s vision.&#x27;&quot; Prior to release, moviegoers on the Internet scrutinized numerous photos and the film&#x27;s promotional Lego sets in hope of understanding plot details. Spielberg biographer Ian Freer wrote, &quot;What &quot;Indy IV&quot; is actually about has been the great cultural guessing game of 2007/08. Yet, it has to be said, there is something refreshing about being ten weeks away from a giant blockbuster and knowing next to nothing about it.&quot; To distract investigative fans from the film&#x27;s title during filming, five fake titles were registered with the Motion Picture Association of America; &quot;The City of Gods&quot;, &quot;The Destroyer of Worlds&quot;, &quot;The Fourth Corner of the Earth&quot;, &quot;The Lost City of Gold&quot; and &quot;The Quest for the Covenant&quot;. Lucas and Spielberg had also wanted to keep Karen Allen&#x27;s return a secret until the film&#x27;s release, but decided to confirm it at the 2007 Comic-Con.

An extra in the film, Tyler Nelson, violated his nondisclosure agreement in an interview with the &quot;Edmond Sun&quot; on September 17, 2007, which was then picked up by the mainstream media. It is unknown if he remained in the final cut. At Nelson&#x27;s request, &quot;The Edmond Sun&quot; subsequently pulled the story from its website. On October 2, 2007, a Superior Court order was filed finding that Nelson knowingly violated the agreement. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A number of production photos and sensitive documents pertaining to the film&#x27;s production budget were also stolen from Spielberg&#x27;s production office. The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department set up a sting operation after being alerted by a webmaster that the thief might try to sell the photos. On October 4, 2007, the seller, 37-year-old Roderick Eric Davis, was arrested. He pleaded guilty to two felony counts and was sentenced to two years and four months in prison.

===Marketing===

Howard Roffman, president of Lucas Licensing, attributed the film&#x27;s large marketing campaign to it having been &quot;nineteen years since the last film, and we are sensing a huge pent-up demand for everything Indy&quot;. Marketing relied heavily on the public&#x27;s nostalgia for the series, with products taking inspiration from all four films. Paramount spent at least $150 million to promote the film, whereas most film promotions range from $70 to 100 million. As well as fans, the film also needed to appeal to younger viewers. Licensing deals include Expedia, Dr Pepper, Burger King, M&amp;M&#x27;s, Snickers, Lunchables, and Papa John&#x27;s. Paramount along with Blockbuster sponsored an Indiana Jones open wheel car for Marco Andretti in the 2008 Indianapolis 500, and his racing suit was designed to resemble Indiana Jones&#x27;s outfit. Andretti would go on to finish third in the race. The distributor also paired with M&amp;M&#x27;s to sponsor the No. 18 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota, with NASCAR driver Kyle Busch behind the wheel, in the 2008 Dodge Challenger 500 at Darlington Raceway. Kyle Busch and the No. 18 team won the race and visited victory lane with Indiana Jones on the car. With the film&#x27;s release, producer Frank Marshall and UNESCO worked together to promote conservation of World Heritage Sites around the world. Disneyland hosted &quot;Indiana Jones Summer of Hidden Mysteries&quot; to promote the film&#x27;s release.

The Boston-based design studio Creative Pilot created the packaging style for the film&#x27;s merchandise, which merged Drew Struzan&#x27;s original illustrations &quot;with a fresh new look, which showcases the whip, a map and exotic hieroglyphic patterns&quot;. Hasbro, Lego, Sideshow Collectibles, Topps, Diamond Select, Hallmark Cards, and Cartamundi all sold products. A THQ mobile game based on the film was released, as was a Lego video game based on the past films. Lego also released a series of computer-animated spoofs, &quot;Lego Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Brick&quot;, directed by Peder Pedersen. Stern Pinball released a new Indiana Jones pinball machine, designed by John Borg, based on all four films. From October 2007 to April 2008, the re-edited episodes of &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; were released in three DVD box sets.

Random House, Dark Horse Comics, Diamond Comic Distributors, Scholastic, and DK published books, including James Rollins&#x27;s novelization of &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, a two-issue comic book adaptation written by John Jackson Miller and drawn by Luke Ross (&quot;&quot;), children&#x27;s novelizations of all four films, the &quot;Indiana Jones Adventures&quot; comic book series aimed at children, and the official &quot;Indiana Jones Magazine&quot;. Scholastic featured Indiana and Mutt on the covers of &quot;Scholastic News&quot; and &quot;Scholastic Maths&quot;, to the concern of parents, though Jack Silbert, editor of the latter, felt the film would interest children in archaeology.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in North America on October 14, 2008, and in the UK on November 10. This THX certified release includes a two-disc special-edition DVD, a two-disc special-edition Blu-ray, and a single-disc edition DVD. On September 18, 2012, it was re-released on Blu-ray as part of &quot;Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures&quot;.

In 2021, a remastered 4K version of the film was released by Paramount and Lucasfilm on Ultra HD Blu-ray, produced using scans of the original negatives. It was released as part of a box set for the then four films in the Indiana Jones film series.

As of October 16, 2013, the film has made $117,239,631 in revenue through home media.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; is distributed by one entity, Paramount, but owned by another, Lucasfilm. The pre-production arrangement between the two organizations granted Paramount 12.5% of the film&#x27;s revenue. As the $185 million budget was larger than initially expected, Lucas, Spielberg and Ford turned down large upfront salaries so Paramount could cover the film&#x27;s costs. For Paramount to see a profit beyond its distribution fee, the film had to make over $400 million. At that point, Lucas, Spielberg, Ford, and those with smaller profit-sharing deals would also begin to collect their cut.

The film was released on May 22, 2008, in the United States and Canada, playing at 4,260 theaters. At that time, it achieved the third-highest number of screenings, behind &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. For its opening day, the film earned $25 million domestically, making it the fourth-highest Thursday opening, behind &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;. In its opening weekend, it grossed an estimated $101 million and ranked number one at the box office. The film would go on to set opening weekend records for both a Steven Spielberg film and Harrison Ford film, breaking the previous records held by &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Air Force One&quot; simultaneously. Within its first five days of release, it grossed $151.1 million, combined with $126 million from the four-day opening weekend. It ranked as the second-biggest Memorial Day weekend release, after &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;. During Memorial Day, the film had already generated a total of $26.7 million, becoming the second-highest Monday gross of any film, trailing only behind &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. It was the third-most-successful film of 2008 domestically, behind &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;Iron Man&quot;, respectively, and the year&#x27;s second-highest-grossing film internationally, behind &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. In February 2010, it was the 25th-highest-grossing film of all time domestically, and 44th-highest-grossing worldwide, as well as the most financially successful &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film when not adjusted for inflation of ticket prices.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, of critic reviews are positive and the average rating is . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though the plot elements are certainly familiar, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; still delivers the thrills and Harrison Ford&#x27;s return in the title role is more than welcome.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four, the same rating he gave &quot;The Last Crusade&quot;, finding it &quot;same old, same old&quot;, but what &quot;I &quot;want&quot; it to be&quot;, particularly as &quot;a lover of pulp fiction&quot;: Leonard Maltin also gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, more than he gave &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; and &quot;Last Crusade, &quot;and wrote that &quot;Indy returns with the same brand of high adventure that marked the original &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark.&quot;&quot; &quot;Empire&quot;″s Damon Wise criticized the use of CGI but praised Ford&#x27;s performance and wrote that &quot;It won&#x27;t change your life but, if you&#x27;re in the right frame of mind, it will change your mood: you might wince, you might groan, you might beg to differ on the big, silly climax, but you&#x27;ll never stop smiling.&quot;

James Berardinelli gave the film 2 stars out of 4, calling it &quot;the most lifeless of the series&quot; and &quot;simply [not] a very good motion picture.&quot; Margaret Pomeranz of &quot;At the Movies&quot; gave the film 2½ stars out of 5, saying that the filmmakers &quot;had 19 years since the last Indiana Jones movie to come up with something truly exciting and fresh, but I feel there&#x27;s a certain laziness and cynicism in this latest adventure.&quot; Associated Press reported that J. Sperling Reich, writing for FilmStew.com, said: &quot;It really looked like they were going through the motions. It really looked like no one had their heart in it.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; stated reviews were &quot;mixed&quot; and reviewers felt the &quot;movie suffers from predictable plot points and cheesy special effects.&quot;

===International reaction===
The Communist Party of the Russian Federation called for a ban on the film, accusing the production team of &quot;demonizing&quot; the Soviet Union. Spielberg responded: &quot;When we decided the fourth installment would take place in 1957, we had no choice but to make the Russians the enemies. World War II had just ended and the Cold War had begun. The U.S. didn&#x27;t have any other enemies at the time.&quot;

The film&#x27;s depiction of Peru also received criticism from the Peruvian and Mexican public, as it jumbles elements of Precolumbian cultures from those countries (like references to Maya that never lived in Perù).

===Audience reception and legacy===
Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average rating of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale, down from the previous film&#x27;s &quot;A&quot;. According to Associated Press, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; received a &quot;respectful&quot; but &quot;far from glowing&quot; reception from &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; fans, and that &quot;some viewers at its first press screening loved it, some called it slick and enjoyable though formulaic, some said it was not worth the 19-year wait.&quot; &quot;South Park&quot; parodied the film in the episode &quot;The China Probrem&quot;, broadcast five months after the film&#x27;s release. The episode parodied the negative fan reaction, with the characters filing a police report against Lucas and Spielberg for &quot;raping Indiana Jones&quot;.

Some disappointed &quot;Indiana Jones &quot;fans used the term &quot;nuking the fridge&quot;, a reference to the scene in which Jones survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator, to denote the point when a franchise crosses into the absurd, similar to &quot;jumping the shark&quot;. This phrase has appeared across the internet, and was chosen as No. 5 on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;top ten buzzwords&quot; of 2008. Asked about the scene and phrase, Spielberg said: &quot;Blame me. Don&#x27;t blame George. That was my silly idea ... I&#x27;m proud of that. I&#x27;m glad I was able to bring that into popular culture.&quot; Lucas denied this, saying Spielberg was &quot;trying to protect&quot; him. According to Lucas, he had assembled a dossier of research data to convince Spielberg; Lucas stated that his research claimed the odds of surviving in the refrigerator are about &quot;50-50.&quot;

The mixed fanbase reaction did not surprise Lucas, who was familiar with mixed response to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels, and predicted that &quot;we&#x27;re all going to get people throwing tomatoes at us.&quot; According to Lucas, fans are &quot;always going to be upset. &#x27;Why did he do it like this? And why didn&#x27;t he do it like this?&#x27; They write their own movie, and then, if you don&#x27;t do their movie, they get upset about it&quot;. David Koepp said: &quot;I knew I was going to get hammered from a number of quarters [but] what I liked about the way the movie ended up playing was it was popular with families. I like that families really embraced it.&quot; Although Spielberg said &quot;I&#x27;m very happy with the movie. I always have been&quot;, he also said &quot;I sympathize with people who didn&#x27;t like the MacGuffin [the interdimensional beings] because I never liked the MacGuffin.&quot; Koepp also disliked the inclusion of aliens and had made a failed suggestion to use a different story idea. Reflecting on the film in 2022, producer Kathleen Kennedy said &quot;we may not have had as strong a story as we wanted&quot;.

At the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, LaBeouf told &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; he had &quot;dropped the ball on the legacy that people loved and cherished&quot; and felt that &quot;the movie could have been updated ... we just misinterpreted what we were trying to satiate.&quot; In 2011, in response to LaBeouf&#x27;s comments, Harrison Ford said: &quot;I think I told [LaBeouf] he was a fucking idiot ... As an actor, I think it&#x27;s my obligation to support the film without making a complete ass of myself. Shia is ambitious, attentive and talented—and he&#x27;s learning how to deal with a situation which is very unique and difficult.&quot; LaBeouf said he regretted his comments and their effect on his relationship with Spielberg: &quot;He told me there&#x27;s a time to be a human being and have an opinion, and there&#x27;s a time to sell cars. It brought me freedom, but it also killed my spirits because this was a dude I looked up to like a sensei.&quot;

Film critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised the film despite its alienation of fans, understanding that the film was &quot;more an ensemble piece&quot; compared to the previous films in the series, but adding that &quot;there was a point to this approach: &quot;Crystal Skull&quot; was Spielberg&#x27;s immense and spectacular version of an Old Man movie... rather like the films Howard Hawks and John Ford were making in the mid- to late &#x27;60s&quot;. Seitz also considers the &quot;nuke the fridge&quot; scene as one of the series&#x27; best, stating that &quot;It brings Indy forward into the world that birthed Steven Spielberg and his Boomer-fueled fantasies of earlier generations. And the construction of it, the shots and cuts, is brilliant. The ramping up. The satirical touches. And the &#x27;nuclear family&#x27; pun at the heart of it.&quot; Rewatching the film 15 years later, Jeff Ames at &quot;ComingSoon&quot; said his initial like of the film had been because it was an &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; sequel, but he said it now &quot;feels like a missed opportunity&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for Best Action Movie at the 2009 Critics&#x27; Choice Awards. The Visual Effects Society nominated it for Best Single Visual Effect of the Year (the valley destruction), Best Outstanding Matte Paintings, Best Models and Miniatures, and Best Created Environment in a Feature Motion Picture (the inside of the temple). The film ranks 453rd on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. It was nominated at the Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Costumes and Best Special Effects. It won Best Costumes. At the 51st Grammy Awards, John Williams won an award for the Mutt Williams theme.

In 2008, the film won the Razzie Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel. Comcast voted it the 11th-worst film sequel of all time. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine ranked the movie 10th on its list &quot;The 20 Worst Sequels to Good Movies&quot;. Listverse.com ranked the film 8th on its list of the &quot;Top 10 Worst Movie Sequels&quot;.

===Lawsuit===
In late 2012, the director of the Institute of Archaeology of Belize, Dr. Jaime Awe, sued Lucasfilm, Disney, and Paramount Pictures on behalf of the country Belize for using the Mitchell-Hedges skull&#x27;s &quot;likeness&quot; in the film. Awe claimed that if the Mitchell-Hedges skull was actually found in Belize, then it had been stolen from his country, and the defendants were profiting off its likeness.

==Sequel==

On March 15, 2016, Walt Disney Studios announced that Spielberg and Ford would both return for a fifth &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film, initially scheduled for release on July 19, 2019. After multiple delays, this was finally changed to June 30, 2023. In February 2020, it was revealed that Spielberg had stepped down as the film&#x27;s director and that James Mangold had entered negotiations to direct. The fifth film, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,&quot; was released by Disney on June 30, 2023.

<text>The 37th Mandala is a 1996 horror novel by American writer Marc Laidlaw. The story centres on cynical New Age writer Derek Crowe, who uses an ancient mystical text containing a series of Mandalas as the basis for his latest work, &quot;The Mandala Rites.&quot; Crowe privately believes that the subjects he writes about are superstitious nonsense but soon realises his new book will unleash a lurking interdimensional horror endangering both his witless fans and the world.

==Reception==

Horror writer Stephen King described the book as &quot;genuinely creepy&quot;, while Ramsey Campbell praised it as &quot;a masterpiece of the kind of visionary horror we&#x27;ve hardly seen since Lovecraft died.&quot;

Kirkus Reviews gave an extremely positive review, stating that the work was &quot;far more fine-grained than Heinlein&#x27;s (&quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;) and nearly as compelling as Lovecraft&#x27;s&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; was more mixed in its appraisal, describing it as &quot;a superior tale of human beings in thrall to occult forces, but one whose reach exceeds its grasp.&quot;

&quot;The 37th Mandala&quot; earned Laidlaw the 1996 International Horror Guild Award for &quot;Best Novel&quot;. It was also nominated for World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1997.

== In popular culture ==
In the Valve computer game &quot;Half-Life&quot;, on which Laidlaw served as lead writer, this book is one of two seen on a shelf in the personal locker of the game&#x27;s protagonist Gordon Freeman, with the other being Laidlaw&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;The Orchid Eater&quot;. Another locker in the room is also marked with the name &quot;Laidlaw&quot;. Harry S. Robins, known for voicing Dr Kleiner in the Half-Life series, worked with Laidlaw on the illustrations within the book.

<doc id="1252929" wikidata="Q2003133" url="?curid=1252929" title="Metallo">
<text>Metallo () is the name of different supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly as an adversary of Superman. All versions of the character are powered by Kryptonite and are partially or completely mechanical.

In 2009, Metallo was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 52nd-greatest comic book villain of all time.

Metallo has been adapted into numerous media outside comics, primarily in association with Superman. Malcolm McDowell, Lex Lang, Jim Rash, Paul Blackthorne, and John C. McGinley have voiced the character in animation. Furthermore, several versions of Metallo appear in the live-action series &quot;Supergirl&quot;.

==Publication history==

There was an earlier &quot;Metalo&quot; who appeared in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot; #6 (Summer 1942). This version was a man named George Grant who discovered the most powerful metal on Earth and invented a strength serum.

John Corben and Metallo first appeared in the &quot;Superman&quot; comic strip storyline &quot;The Menace of Metallo&quot;, which ran from 15 December 1958 to 4 April 1959. The character debuted in comic books in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #252 (May 1959), in a story by Robert Bernstein and Al Plastino. 

The Roger Corben version of Metallo debuted in &quot;Superman&quot; #310 and was created by Curt Swan and Martin Pasko.

==Fictional character biography==
===George Grant===

Metalo (alternate spelling) is the identity of an inventor/scientist named George Grant who had built a powered suit of armor made from &quot;the most powerful metal on Earth&quot; as well as a &quot;strength serum&quot; that made him a near-match for Superman. To draw him out, Metalo captured Lois Lane. At the end of their battle, Metalo fell into a crevice to what Superman assumed would be his death. Metalo was revealed to the reader to have &quot;narrowly escaped destruction&quot; and vowed to take revenge.

Nearly 40 years would pass before the character reappeared in print to challenge Superman again. Metalo had improved his armor and serum and also exposed Superman to a ray that reduced his power significantly, giving Metalo superior strength in their first battle. Superman engaged in a lengthy regimen of exercise and training to restore his powers and returned to easily defeat Metalo.

===Jor-El&#x27;s Robot===
A different Metallo appeared as Jor-El&#x27;s robot to battle Superboy.

===John Corben===
John Corben is a criminal and journalist who is involved in a fatal car accident while fleeing the scene of a murder he committed. Professor Vale encounters Corben and transfers his brain into a robotic body covered by a flesh-like artificial skin and powered by kryptonite.

After obtaining a job with the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, Corben briefly tried to romance Lois Lane, while deciding that he would use his powers to eliminate Superman, the one person who might expose his criminal deeds. After setting a kryptonite death-trap for Superman, Corben stole what he thought was another sample of kryptonite from a museum as a new power supply, not knowing it was a fake prop; this mistake caused him to die just as he was about to kill Lois Lane for discovering that he was not Superman (as he had pretended to be, being super-strong and invulnerable as a cyborg). Superman eventually escaped from the kryptonite trap and arrived just after Metallo (John Corben) had died.
After John Byrne rewrote Superman&#x27;s origins in the 1986 miniseries &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;, Metallo was also given an altered backstory. In this version, Corben is inspired to battle Superman because Vale believes him to be an invader.

Despite ignoring Vale&#x27;s commands, Metallo came into conflict with Superman on various occasions, largely due to his continued activities as a petty thug. Metallo later lost his kryptonite heart to Lex Luthor, though back-up life support systems allowed him to reactivate himself and escape. He remained a thorn in Superman&#x27;s side and was powerful enough to cripple the Doom Patrol. Still, the Indian-born hero who called herself Celsius did blow him apart with her thermal powers. Metallo later received a major upgrade via an unholy bargain with the demon Neron. As a result, Metallo could morph his body into any mechanical shape he could imagine (such as turning his hands into guns or &quot;growing&quot; a jet pack from his back) and project his consciousness into any technological or metallic device. He could also grow to monstrous size. During one battle, his gigantic fists were separated and later turned into housing by other superheroes. In another incident, Metallo was rendered more insane by the Joker and used his height to destroy an elevated train of commuters.

As Superman and others learned on various occasions, the most effective way to neutralize Metallo was to remove his (largely invulnerable) head and isolate it from other metallic items.

In &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #2 (November 2003), Lex Luthor fabricated evidence implicating John Corben as the criminal who shot and killed Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne instead of Joe Chill.

====&quot;Superman: Secret Origin&quot;====
In the 2009–10 miniseries &quot;&quot;, which retells the origins of Superman and his supporting cast, Corben is an Army sergeant who works for General Sam Lane. He is enlisted to battle Superman and is transformed into a cyborg to save his life after his suit is damaged and malfunctions.

====&quot;The New 52&quot;====
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Corben is possessed by Brainiac. However, Superman reasons with him and he helps fight Brainiac before being rendered comatose. Corben later recovers and becomes an ally of Superman before sacrificing himself so Superman can use his kryptonite heart to regain his powers.

====&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;====
In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Metallo is resurrected and joins the Superman Revenge Squad.

===Roger Corben===
Roger Corben is John Corben&#x27;s brother, who works with the secret organization SKULL to avenge his death.

==Powers and abilities==
Metallo&#x27;s metallic body offers him a high degree of protection from physical and energy attacks. He has enhanced abilities and no longer needs to eat, sleep, or breathe. His brain is hermetically sealed inside a shielded alloy skull that has its own power supply. When he was first created, he was powered by a kryptonite heart; losing that, he subsisted on plutonium instead. Additionally, because of his cyborg body, Metallo possesses superhuman strength and speed, enough to pose a challenge and even a threat to opponents such as Superman (in that case, he also takes advantage of the weakening power of kryptonite besides his own strength).

Over the course of his criminal career, Metallo&#x27;s body would be decimated constantly by various circumstances. As such he would receive numerous upgrades or whole new chassis&#x27; to replace his damaged parts, such as by the obscure supervillain organization Cerberus, which modified him with a vastly superior body, one with lead-lined skull-plating and an anatomic layer that even Superman could not demolish. This gave him greatly enhanced strength and durability, coupled with moderate mechanical regeneration to repair internal damage. He was later outfitted with a larger LexCorp tech body, which gave him laser vision and further augmented his physical abilities. Soon after it was destroyed, Corben had received a new body from a fellow Kryptonite-powered supervillain Conduit; which gave Metallo radioactive blasts from his hands and could utilize geomagnetism to make him physically immovable, even by the Man of Steel, so long as he stood on solid ground or flooring within a building complex.

Metallo would eventually sell his soul (or what was left of it) to the demon Neron in return for increased power, gaining the abilities to mentally control and absorb any mechanical or metal object he focuses on and transforming any technology (himself included) into an extension of his exoskeleton (an ability similar to Cyborg Superman).

In experimenting with his newfound abilities, Metallo found he could alternate differing energy frequencies for harnessing and redistributing it from various power sources. Brainiac 13 upgraded Metallo to tap into various light spectra to better utilize his kryptonite-charged abilities. His mechanical body was also upgraded to be able to grow towards monolithic proportions. He is also occasionally portrayed as having a liquid metal-based endoskeleton, possessing the ability to morph parts of his body, specifically his limbs, into different weapons or tools, such as chainsaws, shovels, hammers, etc. While not a genius like Lex Luthor or Brainiac, Corben&#x27;s time spent with machines has given him a gifted understanding of how they work, enabling him to tinker with their mechanical functions even before gaining his technomorphing capabilities.

&quot;Salvation Run&quot; reveals that Metallo possesses a high-calculus cyber-mind with which to run the numbers of possible and probable outcomes as well as success ratios through. In the previous continuity, the pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Lex Luthor modified Corben to holster and utilize different forms of kryptonite; boasting mutagenic red-k, inverted blue-k and lastly, artificial depowering gold-k on top of the green he already possessed. He could even power a great many anti-Kryptonian armaments developed by Luthor through it.

==Other versions==
* An alternate universe variant of Metallo appears in &quot;&quot;. This version was created by Lex Luthor for the US government to combat Superman, leader of the Soviet Union.
* The Silver Age incarnation of Metallo appears in &quot;Justice&quot;.
* An alternate universe variant of Metallo appears in &quot;Superman Family Adventures&quot;. This version is Jack Corben, an astronaut who sustained terminal Kryptonite poisoning after flying through a Kryptonite asteroid field. Lex Luthor manipulates him into believing that Superman is responsible and gives him metallic armor to treat his condition.

==In other media==
===Television===
====Live-action====

* The Roger Corben incarnation of Metallo appears in &quot;Superboy&quot;, portrayed by Michael Callan. This version is a bungling bank robber who suffers from chest pains. In the episode &quot;Metallo&quot;, he tries to rob an armored car despite his condition. Superboy arrives and apprehends the bank robber, but Corben has a heart attack and is taken to a hospital. After a lengthy recuperation, he murders his doctor and escapes, but suffers another heart attack, crashes his car, and is assumed dead. A mentally-unbalanced doctor subsequently recovers his body, turns him into a cyborg, and replaces his ailing heart with Kryptonite.
* The John Corben incarnation of Metallo appears in a self-titled episode of &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, portrayed by Scott Valentine. This version is Lucy Lane&#x27;s boyfriend and a petty criminal. After being shot during a holdup gone wrong, former LexCorp scientist Emmett Vale rebuilds Corben into a Kryptonite-powered cyborg with help from his brother Rollie Vale. Using his new form, Metallo wreaks havoc in Metropolis and fights Superman, who eventually defeats him. Emmett is captured, but Rollie escapes with Metallo&#x27;s kryptonite, leaving the latter to deactivate.
* The John Corben incarnation of Metallo appears in &quot;Smallville&quot;, portrayed by Brian Austin Green in the ninth season and an uncredited actor in the tenth season. This version is a former war reporter who works at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; alongside Lois Lane and despises the &quot;Blur&quot; - Clark Kent - because he rescued a prisoner who went on to murder Corben&#x27;s sister. In the episode &quot;Metallo&quot;, Corben is hit by a truck and experimented on by Major Zod&#x27;s Kandorian soldiers, receiving bionic appendages and an artificial kryptonite-powered heart. Corben targets the Blur to seek revenge for his sister, but Kent uses a lead plate to defeat him before Corben is recovered by LuthorCorp CEO Tess Mercer. In the episode &quot;Upgrade&quot;, Corben&#x27;s prior insanity is explained as a flaw in his kryptonite heart while Mercer&#x27;s scientists turn him into a mindless weapon. After defeating Major Zod and a red kryptonite-infected Kent, Corben regains his free will, receives a red kryptonite heart from Lane that restores his sanity, and goes underground after parting ways on good terms with her and Kent. In the episode &quot;Prophecy&quot;, he returns to villainy and using a green Kryptonite heart after Toyman recruits him into his company, &quot;Marionette Ventures&quot;. In the comic book continuation &quot;Smallville Season 11&quot;, it is revealed that Corben&#x27;s change of heart happened due to him becoming a mercenary and his biology rejecting the red kryptonite heart. During this time, a dictatorship tasked him with subduing and eliminating the rebel forces&#x27; protector: a kryptonite-powered Lana Lang. Toyman gave him his new green kryptonite heart as well as the ability to absorb meteor energy signatures to strengthen himself. After absorbing Lang&#x27;s kryptonite-powered nanites, Corben gains the ability to assimilate metallic or mechanical constructs. After Lang and Lane remove his power source, the U.S. government defeats and incarcerates Corben.

<text>The Georgia and Florida Railway is a short line railroad operating in Georgia and Florida, and is a subsidiary of OmniTRAX. The railroad spans over numerous different rail lines, most of which radiate out of Albany, Georgia.

Primary commodities include corn, scrap metal, chemicals, ethanol, cement, paper, cottonseed, clay wood pulp, peanuts, fertilizer, beer, aggregates and others, generating 21,000 annual carloads.

== History ==
Upon its start on April 14, 1995 the railroad was named the Georgia and Florida Railroad and was a Gulf &amp; Ohio subsidiary operating over two lines: Albany to Sparks, and Valdosta to Nashville over former Norfolk Southern (NS) trackage.

Initially the railroad consisted of approximately of track over two separate branches, including trackage rights over NS to link the disconnected lines. The railroad initially hauled grain, peanuts, fertilizer, woodchips, and beer, totaling around 10,000 carloads.

=== Albany-Sparks ===

The Albany-Sparks route consists of two different routes meeting at Moultrie. The Albany-Moultrie portion was completed by the Georgia Northern Railway in 1905. In 1966, the Southern acquired the Georgia Northern and it was merged with the Albany &amp; Northern Railway subsidiary.

The second section from (Moultrie-Sparks) was originally constructed by the Sparks Western Railway, however, the railroad was acquired by the Georgia &amp; Florida Railway (G&amp;F) in 1910, with the line being completed in 1911. The G&amp;F became a subsidiary of the Southern in 1963. Both sections officially became part of NS in 1990 and were leased to G&amp;F in 1995.

=== Valdosta-Nashville ===
The Valdosta-Nashville section was built by the Douglas, Augusta &amp; Gulf Railway and became part of G&amp;F around 1906. G&amp;F later became part of the Southern in 1963 and NS in 1990.

In early 2005 changes came to the branch as the Georgia Department of Transportation purchased the line from G&amp;F, including an additional section of exempted track from Nashville to Willacoochee, , owned by the city of Willacoochee. Under the agreement, G&amp;F would continue to operate the line from Valdosta to Willachoochee. Cater Parrott Railnet now operates this line.

=== Live Oak, Perry &amp; South Georgia ===

Starting around 1896 the South Georgia Railroad built a line south from a point near Adel to Quitman. The line was extended further to Greenville, Florida in 1901 where it met the South Georgia &amp; West Coast Railway, which ran from Greenville to Perry, Florida. The entire line was later reorganized as the South Georgia Railway. In 1971 the Southern Railway acquired the line and merged it with a separate line, the Live Oak, Perry and Gulf, to form the Live Oak, Perry, and South Georgia.

On December 15, 1995 the LOP&amp;SG was purchased as a subsidiary of Gulf &amp; Ohio. The railroad ran from Adel, Georgia to Foley, Florida, , and was operated by the Georgia &amp; Florida.

=== Consolidation and Acquisition by RailNet ===

On January 21, 1999 Gulf &amp; Ohio consolidated its holdings in the region under a single entity and sold the new network – including the two branches of the neighboring Atlantic &amp; Gulf railroad – to RailNet. The new railroad was renamed Georgia and Florida RailNet.

=== OmniTRAX ===

OmniTRAX acquired the entire Georgia &amp; Florida RailNet in 2005, renaming the railroad Georgia and Florida Railway.

A boon came to the railroad in 2006 as an ethanol plant was planned for Camilla, Georgia. The new facility was expected to generate significant traffic for the line when it opened in late 2008. However, due to financial difficulties experienced by the facility, it is unclear whether the effect on the G&amp;F railroad will remain.

<doc id="1252935" wikidata="Q16881447" url="?curid=1252935" title="Prodigy.">
<text>Prodigy. is a British comic book series created by Mark Millar and Rafael Albuquerque, who respectively write and illustrate the first volume, and published by Image Comics. The title was announced near the end of 2018 as the second comic book collaboration between Mark Millar and Netflix, after the company acquired the Millarworld imprint of creator-owned titles in the summer of 2017, and to be adapted as a film exclusive to the streaming service, along with other of the imprint&#x27;s comic book series. The first volume ran for six issues from December 2018 to June 2019, and a trade paperback collecting the series, subtitled &quot;Prodigy. The Evil Earth&quot;, was released the next month.

Two sequels followed: &quot;Prodigy. The Icarus Societ&quot; (2022; illustrated by Matteo Buffagni) and &quot;Big Game&quot; (2023; illustrated by Pepe Larraz), with a further series, &quot;Prodigy. Slaves of Mars&quot; (2024; illustrated by Stefano Landini), to be published by Dark Horse Comics.

==Plot summary==
===&quot;The Evil Earth&quot;===
Edison Crane isn&#x27;t content being the world&#x27;s smartest man and most successful businessman – his brilliant mind needs to be constantly challenged. He&#x27;s a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, a genius composer, an Olympic athlete, and an expert in the occult, and now international governments are calling on him to fix problems they just can&#x27;t handle.

===&quot;The Icarus Society&quot;===
Edison Crane has always been the smartest man in the room. Now he&#x27;s in a world he didn&#x27;t even know existed with the Icarus Society, a secret society of super geniuses all richer than he is. Blackmailed into recovering an artefact on a mission they know is almost certain death, Edison and the richest man alive, Felix Koffka, must search for the lost city of Shangri-La, where the world&#x27;s most evil people have been pulled for thousands of years.

===&quot;Big Game&quot;===

While excavating the remnants of the Royal Empire, a prehistoric galactic empire that considered Earth its capital, Edison Crane is recruited by &quot;Bobbie Griffin&quot;, formerly the Batgirl of the DC Universe prior to its transmogrification into the Millarworld, who with the Chrononauts must face off against the Secret Lord of Earth and leader of the Fraternity of Super-Criminals Wesley Gibson, who aims to wipe out all the world&#x27;s superhumans as his father had once done in 1986, as well as the Royal Empire, their fleet brought to the future by Mindy McCready.

===&quot;Slaves of Mars&quot;===
On March 21, 2024, Mark Millar announced that &quot;Prodigy. Slaves of Mars&quot; was set for publication from Dark Horse Comics in August 2024.

==Collected editions==
==Netflix adaptation==
In the summer of 2017, Netflix acquired Mark Millar&#x27;s comic book publishing company Millarworld, and the next summer, announced that it had greenlit two series based on &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot; and &quot;American Jesus&quot;, and three films based on &quot;Empress&quot;, &quot;Huck&quot; and &quot;Sharkey the Bounty Hunter&quot;.

In June 2018, Mark Millar announced the release of &quot;The Magic Order&quot;, the first comic book series under the Millarworld imprint since Netflix acquired the publisher, and in November of the same year, announced &quot;Prodigy.&quot;, one month before the release of the first issue, with both being considered to be adapted as an episodic series and a feature film respectively.

In March 2020, it was reported that the series will be adapted into a feature film, with Kaz Firpo and Ryan Firpo writing the script.

In March 2022, Millar confirmed the title would be the first major movie to come out on Netflix since the acquisition in 2017.

In November 2022, Miller and Matteo Buffagni announced via the synopsis for the finale of &quot;Prodigy. The Icarus Society&quot; that the volume would serve as the basis for the &quot;Prodigy&quot; feature film.

<text>Kodiakkarai also called Point Calimere or Cape Calimere, is a low headland of the Coromandel Coast, in the Nagapattinam district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The Cape is located about south of Vedaranyam in the delta region of the Cauvery River, and marks a nearly right-angle turn in the coastline. The antiquity of the area is evidenced by the Kodi Kuzhagar temple built during the Chola period, and a Chola lighthouse, which was destroyed in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

Kodiakkarai has been designated as a Ramsar site since August 2002. Point Calimere is also associated with the mythological Hindu epic, The Ramayana. The highest point of the cape, at an elevation of , is Ramarpatham, meaning &quot;Rama&#x27;s feet&quot; in Tamil. A stone slab on the Cape bears the impressions of two feet and is said to be the place where Rama stood and reconnoitered Ravana&#x27;s kingdom in Sri Lanka, which is to the south of the Point. It is also mentioned by Kalki in his historical novel &quot;Ponniyin Selvan&quot;.

==Flora and Fauna==
The forests of Kodiakkarai, also known the Vedaranyam forests, are one of the last remnants of the dry evergreen forests that were once typical of East Deccan dry evergreen forests ecoregion. The Point Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary, with an area of , was created on 13 June 1967.

The sanctuary includes the cape and its three types of habitat: dry evergreen forests, mangrove forests, and wetlands. In 1988, the sanctuary was enlarged to include the Great Vedaranyam Swamp and the Talaignayar Reserve Forest, and renamed the Point Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary, with a total area of . Point Calimere is home to the endangered endemic Indian blackbuck and is one of the few known wintering locations of the spoon-billed sandpiper. It also holds large wintering populations of greater flamingos. The area is dotted with salt pans and these hold large crustacean populations that support the wintering bird life. Pesticide runoff from agricultural fields and shrimp farms has entered the ecosystem resulting in many species having high concentrations of DDT and HCH in their tissue.
==Cultural Heritage==
Several sites of religious, historical or cultural importance are located within the sanctuary:

* Ramar Padam (literally: Ramas Footprint) located on the highest point of land in the sanctuary, is a small shrine containing the stone footprints of Lord Rama. Large numbers of Rama devotees gather here during the second week of April to celebrate Ram Navami Festival.
*Kuzhagar Temple or Kodi Kuzhagar Temple (கோடிக் குழகர் கோயில்) (also called Amrithakadeswarar Temple) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva, located in the town of Kodikkarai in Tamil Nadu, India. Kuzhagar is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the &quot;Tevaram&quot;, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as &quot;Paadal Petra Sthalam&quot;. Kuzhagar temple is originally believed to have been built by the Cholas and it has several inscriptions dating back to the Chola period.
* Navakodi Sitthar Aalayam is a temple in south of the Kodiakkarai village. The history of this temple is the wedding ceremony of Lord Shiva and Parvathy ammaal have been attended by lot many Sitthars at this location. Chola Emperor and Mannar Sarafoji were visited this temple. A small village called &quot;Kanakkar Madam&quot; near this shrine was demolished by 1940s (around 80 years ago) and the people who were living there are relocated to Kodiakkarai village and they are still called as Kanakkarmadathiaar&#x27;s family. A large congregation of devotees from all over Tamil Nadu state to come on special day of Amaavasai/Pournami to celebrate a special festival here every year. The greatest lord and the environment gives the peace like never ever feel.
* Sanyasin Muniaswar Kovil is a shrine between the eastern bank of Muniappan Lake and Kodiakkarai Road visited by devotees on all auspicious occasions. On 20 March a special Puja is celebrated here.
* Mattumunian Kovil is a small temple in the south of the sanctuary where people worship and offer prayers throughout the year. A major festival occurs here on the 3rd Friday of September.
* Modi Mandapam is a shrine located near Ramar Padam where people of all castes worship. Hindu legend says that Lord Vedaraneswarer spends a night here with his consort during January - February. In the first week of March a major festival is held here.
* Avulaiganni Dargah is the grave of a Muslim saint located near the road by Ramar Padam. His death anniversary is observed here at the end of November.
* Shevrayan Kovil is a shrine to the deities &quot;Shevrayan&quot; and &quot;Soni&quot; located deep in the forests of the northern part of the sanctuary. A small village near this shrine was relocated outside the sanctuary after the creation of Kodiakkarai Reserve Forest. A large congregation of devotees from Arcothurai celebrate a special festival here in June/July.

* Adivasi Colony is a community of Ambalakars living in huts of mud, coconut fronds and palmyrah leaves on the edge of Kodiakkarai village. Their traditional livelihood was the collection of non-timber forest products in the areas that are now the sanctuary. These practices are now prohibited but not fully eliminated. Many of these people catch fish and small prawns in the nearby mudflats and swamps. Some work as day labourers in the nearby salt pans. They have little interaction with other communities on the island.

* Chola Lighthouse is the remains of a brick and mortar lighthouse near Point Calimerem. It is said to have been built by the Cholas more than a thousand years ago. This structure was badly damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami but can still be seen in the intertidal zone near the British lighthouse.
* British Lighthouse is a tall operating lighthouse built by the British at the tip of Point Calemere in 1890 and can be seen at sea.
* Kodiakkarai Lighthouse is a tall modern aid to navigation located near Kodiakkarai Beach and is accessible to the public between 1500 - 1700hrs. This dominates the sanctuary and may be seen by seamen far at sea.

<text>Telefon is a 1977 spy film directed by Don Siegel and starring Charles Bronson, Lee Remick and Donald Pleasence. The screenplay by Peter Hyams and Stirling Silliphant is based on the 1975 novel by Walter Wager.

==Plot==
After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Soviet Union planted a number of long-term, deep-cover sleeper agents all over the United States, who were so thoroughly brainwashed that even they did not know they were agents. They can be activated only by a special code phrase, a line from the Robert Frost poem &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot; – followed by the agent&#x27;s real first name. Their mission was to sabotage crucial parts of the civil and military infrastructure in the event of war.

More than 20 years pass, and the Cold War gradually gives way to détente. Nikolai Dalchimsky, a rogue KGB headquarters clerk, travels to America and takes with him the &quot;Telefon Book&quot;, which contains the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all the sleeper agents. He starts activating them, one by one. American counterintelligence is thrown into confusion when seemingly-ordinary citizens start blowing up facilities that were once important but now have little, if any, value. The agents either commit suicide or die in the act itself.

The KGB does not dare tell its political leaders, much less the Americans, about its negligence in not deactivating the spy network. KGB Major Grigori Borzov, who was selected in part for his photographic memory, memorizes the contents of the only other copy of the &quot;Telefon Book&quot; and is sent to find and stop Dalchimsky quietly, before either side learns what is happening and possibly starts a war. Borzov is given the assistance of only a single agent, Barbara, who had been planted in America years before.

Eventually, Borzov realizes the method behind Dalchimsky&#x27;s pattern of attacks: he has chosen the agents by the first letters of their American hometowns by &quot;writing&quot; his own name in sabotage across America. Borzov thus anticipates Dalchimsky&#x27;s next chosen agent and kills Dalchimsky.

However, there are a number of twists. Barbara has orders from the KGB to assassinate Borzov once he succeeds to get rid of a dangerous loose end. In addition, she is a double agent and actually works for America. When she informs her American superior, Sandburg, he also tells her to kill Borzov so that she will retain the confidence of the KGB. However, Barbara has fallen in love with her would-be target. She informs Borzov, and together, they blackmail both sides into leaving them alone by holding the threat of the remaining &quot;Telefon&quot; agents over their heads.

==Production==
===Development===
MGM bought the film rights to the novel in October 1974. The novel was published in April 1975. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called the novel &quot;a doozie of a thriller&quot;.

Peter Bellwood was the first writer. Then Peter Hyams wrote a script. Hyams says Dan Melnick then head of MGM told him he wanted Hyams to write and direct, but his last film &quot;Peeper&quot; had flopped and Hyams said &quot;he knew there was no way he was going to let me direct it.&quot; They did like the script but brought in Richard Lester to direct. Hyams rewrote the script for Lester, who then left the project and Don Siegel came on board. Hyams would leave to make &quot;Capricorn One&quot; and Stirling Silliphant rewrote the script.

In August 1976 it was announced Don Siegel would direct and Charles Bronson would star. Siegel had directed Bronson in TV in the late 50s and said &quot;I wanted to do this one because of Bronson. I think we would make a natural team.&quot;

Bronson&#x27;s wife Jill Ireland often worked with her husband and Bronson said the female lead was &quot;perfect for her&quot; but he did not insist and Lee Remick was cast instead.

===Filming===
Principal photography began in January 1977.

Some of the film was shot in Finland, which doubled for Russia. A magazine in the Soviet Union ran an article critical of the film, claiming it aimed to stir up trouble and demonised the Russians. Don Siegel denied this saying the film was &quot;pro Russia and pro peace.&quot;

&quot;I have to face the fact the story is cockamamie at best,&quot; said Siegel. &quot;So I&#x27;ve been particularly painstaking to give the movie a feeling of authenticity.&quot;

The city skyline depicting Houston, where part of the story line occurred, is actually that of Great Falls, Montana, where the majority of the film was shot. During filming, the crew had to order two truckloads of snow needed for one of the scenes, because the chinook winds in the area took away the snow they had. They were trucked from the mountains. Filming in downtown Great Falls was also included. The exploding building in one scene is actually the controlled demolition of the old Paris Gibson Junior High School. The explosion scene was filmed on February 20, 1977. The present day Paris Gibson square was undamaged, but the explosion started roof fires on a couple of nearby houses that were quickly extinguished by city firefighters hired by the movie company on stand by.

The Houston scenes were shot on a Hollywood backlot, while the interior of the Houston Hyatt Regency was portrayed by 5 Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, California – the location which was also used in &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;.

The scenes with fires and explosions at a rocket engine test site were filmed at Rocketdyne&#x27;s Santa Susana Field Laboratory in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles.

According to director Siegel, actress Lee Remick was terrified of Charles Bronson, and when asked to touch his face during a scene, responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t dare. He&#x27;ll bite me!&quot;

As parts of the film were shot in Finland, there are several cameo appearances by Finnish movie stars, most notably Ansa Ikonen.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Though there are action sequences in &#x27;Telefon,&#x27; they are never sustained, and the screenplay only occasionally comes up with witty substitutes for the missing plausibility. However, to describe &#x27;Telefon&#x27; as synthetic is to take it more seriously than it&#x27;s taken by anyone connected with it.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;pleasant escapism&quot; with a story that &quot;runs its interesting if predictable course until fadeout romantic clinch as the stars tell their respective employers to let them live in peace somewhere nice and idyllic, which by this time is really asking too much of audiences.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote that it &quot;is by no means a great picture — just solid action held together by a string of explosions. In other words, it&#x27;s a good movie to eat popcorn by.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;a sleek diversion that hasn&#x27;t much more to it than a routine TV movie.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated, &quot;The real problem is that the filmmakers lay out this story blueprint so doggedly that the audience is invariably 25 pages of expository chitchat ahead of them. Following &#x27;Telefon&#x27; is about as thrilling as being kept on hold for the better part of the day.&quot; Richard Combs of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;This dismal attempt to ring some changes in the spy genre—the protagonist is a KGB agent, his mission is to preserve East-West cordiality—is fatally undercut both by its surprisingly lukewarm plot and unengaged characters and by the fact that its updating is already out of date, Russian-American détente having sprung many leaks.&quot; James Monaco wrote that Telefon don&#x27;t do much but play with paranoia.

&quot;It was a typical Siegel film,&quot; Siegel said later. &quot;It made absolutely no sense. I did the film because basically I&#x27;m a whore.&quot;

The film holds a score of 44% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.

Quentin Tarantino later wrote that &quot;just because the premise is nutty doesn’t mean it’s bad. In fact, it’s far out enough that in the right hands, it could have been a stone gas. But those right hands definitely didn’t belong to old fart Siegel, who blew the picture’s chance for success by de-emphasizing the kooky elements and emphasizing the dull ones. Siegel not only wasted his time, he wasted the Stirling Silliphant and Peter Hyams (who should have directed) script.&quot;

<text>Another Monty Python Record is the second album produced by the Monty Python comedy group, released in 1971. Dissatisfied with their monaural BBC debut album released the previous year, the group took full control of the follow-up, which would be the first release of a six-album deal with Charisma Records in the UK. Most of the material is from the second BBC series of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, with a few newly written pieces. One track, &quot;Stake Your Claim&quot;, is an English-language version of a sketch from the team&#x27;s first German episode.

== Background ==
The production, with its innovative use of stereo and sound effects, was handled by Terry Jones and Michael Palin and proved a technical challenge. According to Jones: &quot;We had this horrendous time because we were recording in this rather hippy recording studio. We were very keen to use the stereo and everything, but what we hadn&#x27;t realised was that the guy who was doing the recording, who I think was out of his head most of the time, had not been making any notes. We&#x27;d end up with tapes and tapes of material with no idea of where anything was on the tapes. That was a bitter experience.&quot;

The sleeve was designed by Terry Gilliam, from an idea by Terry Jones. Packaged as a classical music recording (Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 2 in D Major&quot;), the cover was defaced by the Pythons to serve as their own record jacket. (The &quot;serious&quot; liner notes on the back also bear a Pythonesque stamp: the biography of Beethoven quickly turns into a commentary on Beethoven&#x27;s Wimbledon tennis debut.) Included with the original vinyl LP were three card inserts printed with detailed instructions, scripts and cut-out props for the &quot;Be a Great Actor&quot; sketch on side 2.

Due to the limitations of the vinyl format, the original 1971 UK release had many sketches edited down while others, such as &quot;Communist Quiz&quot; and &quot;Penguin on the TV&quot;, were omitted altogether causing a re-sequencing of the &quot;Royal Festival Hall Concert&quot; and &quot;Spam&quot; sketches. This truncated version was used for all UK cassette releases until 1994. When the album was released in the US in 1972 to coincide with the US release of &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot;, the full unedited version was used. This longer edit was used for all CD releases in both the UK and US.

As well as featuring a pared down track list, the original UK vinyl enjoyed two subtly different releases. Initial pressings were issued on the pink &quot;famous Charisma label&quot; (erroneously listing the release year as 1970) with subsequent pressings replacing this with the &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; label design (correcting the year to 1971). Both editions featured a trick continuous runout groove at the end of Side 1, where the sound of a record scratch is followed by Michael Palin&#x27;s exclamation of &quot;Sorry, squire! I scratched the record&quot; repeated ad infinitum in the locked groove. This groove is farther away from the label than where a locked groove would normally be, so that turntables with automatic return don&#x27;t ruin this gimmick.

The album marked the group&#x27;s first chart success, reaching No. 26 in the UK Albums Chart.

A 7&quot; single, the Pythons&#x27; first, combining Spam Song/The Concert (CB.192) was issued in the UK on 8 September 1972, almost a year after the album&#x27;s release. Later pressings were issued in a picture sleeve featuring a still from the &quot;Dirty Fork&quot; sketch from &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot;.

The 2006 CD reissue features four bonus tracks, although these date from the 1980 &quot;Contractual Obligation Album&quot; sessions.

The 2014 LP reissue by Virgin Records (both as a single disc and as part of the &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Total Rubbish&quot; boxset) contains the longer US version.

<text>Thomas FitzGerald, Earl of Offaly (12 January 1974 – 9 May 1997), styled The Hon. Thomas FitzGerald before 1976 and as Earl of Offaly between 1976 and 1997, was the only son of Maurice, Marquess of Kildare (now the 9th Duke of Leinster).

In May 1997, Lord Offaly was killed in a car accident in Ireland. He had been working as a chef at a number of restaurants in Cork. Following his death, a fund for dyslexics (the T.O.M. Fund) was established in his memory. He is buried in the churchyard of All Saints&#x27; Church, Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire (formerly part of Berkshire).

<text>Point Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary is a protected area in Tamil Nadu, South India, covering along the Palk Strait where it meets the Bay of Bengal at Point Calimere at the southeastern tip of Nagapattinam District. It was created in 1967 for the conservation of the blackbuck and also hosts large congregations of waterbirds, especially greater flamingos.&lt;ref name=&quot;tnfd/pcws&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has been classified as an Important Bird Area.

==Geography==
Point Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary forms the easternmost and most biologically diverse part of Ramsar Site no. 1210 which on 19 August 2002, was declared a place of international importance for the conservation of waterbirds and their wetlands habitats. This site comprises PCWBS, Panchanadikulam Wetland, Unsurveyed Salt swamp, Thalainayar Reserved Forest and Muthupet Mangroves. It is all part of the Great Vedaranyam Swamp, except the reserved forest.

The sanctuary is an island surrounded by the Bay of Bengal to the east, the Palk Straight to the south and swampy backwaters and salt pans to the west and north. Low sand dunes are located along the coast and along the western periphery with coastal plains, tidal mud-flats and shallow seasonal ponds in between. Sand dunes in the east are mostly now stabilised by &quot;Prosopis juliflora&quot; and the higher dunes in the west are stabilised by dense dry evergreen forests. The tallest dune in the sanctuary and the highest point of land in Nagapattinam District is . at the northwest corner of the sanctuary at &quot;Ramar Padam&quot;.

==History==
In the early years of the Sanctuary management was concentrated on prevention of poaching and provision of water to the wildlife. Poaching has been controlled but water supply is a continuing effort. In 1979 the first of several water troughs supplied from water barrels transported by bullock cart and open wells were built. Beginning in 2001–02 several perennial water holes supplied by pipe from bore wells and a large elevated water tank on the western edge of the sanctuary were built.

Several tree planting schemes to increase biodiversity have yielded poor results, with the exception of &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot;. Current practice is to avoid new tree planting and concentrate on removal of the invasive &quot;Prosopis juliflora&quot;. An annual wildlife census has been conducted since 1991.

The Bombay Natural History Society has been conducting regular bird migration studies in the sanctuary since 1959. In 2007 it is building a new field station in Kodaikadu.

On 9 March 1998 a modern lighthouse near Kodaikorai Beach was commissioned.

In 1999 many speed breakers were installed on the Vedaranyam – Kodaikorai road which have effectively prevented the killing of wildlife by speeding vehicles. In 2004/05 nearly 100 boundary pillars were erected for boundary demarcation.

On 26 December 2004 a tsunami as high as 3 metres (10 ft) hit the Kodiyakarai coast of the sanctuary. Seawater flooded the entire sanctuary with four feet of water. The sanctuary escaped serious damage and the sanctuary, animals and birds largely survived the giant wave, but 5,525 people were killed in neighbouring parts of Nagapattinam District.

The documentary film &quot;Point Calimere – Little Kingdom by the Coast&quot; by Shekar Dattatri won the Centre for Media Studies (CMS) Vatavaran 2007 award in the Nature category.

==Flora==

This site is a mix of salt swamps, mangroves, backwaters, mudflats, grasslands and East Deccan dry evergreen forests. 364 of flowering plant species have been identified in the sanctuary of which 50% are herbs and the others are climbers, shrubs and trees. About 198 of these have medicinal properties. &quot;Manilkara hexandra&quot;, locally called &quot;Palai&quot; is the dominant dry evergreen species and an important food source for fruit eating birds. Middle canopy is dominated by the invasive &quot;Prosopis juliflora&quot; and the most abundant undergrowth is &quot;Memecylon umbellatum&quot;.

==Fauna==

This sanctuary is an area of high biodiversity, with 14 mammal species, 18 reptile species and nine amphibian species. The flagship species of the sanctuary is the blackbuck, one of the four antelope species in India and the most numerous large animal in the sanctuary. The population estimate of the blackbuck at Point Calimere more than doubled in thirty years, from 750–800 in 1967 to 1,908 in 1998/99. This isolated population of blackbuck probably survived unmolested throughout the centuries due to the locals&#x27; now declining belief that eating its meat causes leprosy. The predators of the blackbuck at Point Calimere are jackals, and sometimes village dogs. Competition for food is from domestic and feral cattle.

Other notable animals include: chital, golden jackal, bonnet monkey, wild boar, monitor lizard, short-nosed fruit bat, small Indian civet, Indian star tortoise, Indian grey mongoose, black-naped hare, jungle cat and feral horse.
Marine species include the Bottlenose dolphin and olive ridley turtle. In 2002 a pair of Bryde&#x27;s whale were found washed ashore near the sanctuary. One 10 ton 35-foot whale was successfully towed back to sea. This was the first successful rescue of a beached whale in Asia.
The sanctuary hosts the second largest congregation of migratory waterbirds in India, with a peak population in excess of 100,000, representing 103 species. Over 200,000 birds have been captured, studied, ringed and released during the course of several ornithological studies in the past several years.

In October these waterbirds arrive from Rann of Kutch, Eastern Siberia, Northern Russia, Central Asia and parts of Europe for their feeding season and start returning to those breeding places in January. These waterbirds include threatened species such as spot-billed pelican, Nordmann&#x27;s greenshank, spoonbill sandpiper and black-necked stork. Near threatened species include black-headed ibis, Asian dowitcher, lesser flamingo, spoonbill, darter and painted stork.
Over of the best tropical dry evergreen forest in India are in the sanctuary. They harbour a large variety of resident and migratory landbirds. The most common of the 35 resident species are white-browed bulbul, brahminy kite, small green-billed malkoha, crow pheasant, rose-ringed parakeet, grey partridge, blue-tailed bee-eater and common iora.

Spotted and collared doves are common in the mangroves.

==Threats==

Major threats to the natural biodiversity and ecological balance of the sanctuary are: loss of habitat for waterbirds, soil and water salinisation by adjacent salt pans, spread of the invasive &quot;Prosopis juliflora&quot;, cattle grazing and scarcity of fresh water. Sanctuary staff conduct programs to alleviate all these issues.

==Cultural heritage==
Several sites of religious, historical or cultural importance are located within the sanctuary:
* Ramar Padam (literally: Ramas Footprint) located on the highest point of land in the sanctuary, is a small shrine containing the stone footprints of Lord Rama. Large numbers of Rama devotees gather here during the second week of April to celebrate Ram Navami Festival.
* Mattumunian Kovil is a small temple in the south of the sanctuary where people worship and offer prayers throughout the year. A major festival occurs here on the third Friday of September.
* Avulaiganni Dargah is the grave of a Muslim saint located near the road by Ramar Padam. His death anniversary is celebrated in late November.
* Shevrayan Kovil is a shrine to the deities &quot;Shevrayan&quot; and &quot;Soni&quot; located deep in the forests of the northern part of the sanctuary. A small village near this shrine was relocated outside the sanctuary after the creation of Kodaikarai Reserve Forest. A large congregation of devotees from Arcothurai celebrate a special festival in June and July.

* Chola Lighthouse is the remains of a brick and mortar lighthouse near Point Calimere said to have been built by the Cholas more than a thousand years ago. This structure was badly damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami but can still be seen in the intertidal zone near the British lighthouse.

<text>Sofia Elizabeth Mantega, also known as Wind Dancer and formerly known as Renascence, is a fictional character, a mutant appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. One of the student body in the Xavier Institute, she is a member of the New Mutants squad therein. Her first appearance was in &quot;New Mutants&quot;, vol. 2 #1. At the beginning of &quot;New Mutants&quot; vol. 2, she is 16 years old.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Sofia was born and lived most of her life in Caracas, Venezuela. While under the care of her uncle, Sofia&#x27;s mother is killed in a riot. Her only Venezuelan adult relative, an uncle, is unable to support her in addition to his own children, so she is sent to her father, who had been previously unaware of her existence. The head of a major supermarket chain located in the United States, Walter Barrett is a cold, asocial man with no interest in a daughter. As such, he extracts from her a promise that she would learn English before school started, she would get good grades, and she would not use her mutant power, in exchange for which all her material wants would be provided for without question.

Over the next three weeks, she befriends her father&#x27;s manservant Derek, learns English, and joins a local school, but despite her outgoing nature, she has difficulty fitting in and is unable to reconcile herself to her father&#x27;s lack of affection for her. She ultimately acts out by skipping school and wrecking one of her father&#x27;s stores with hurricane-force winds, making sure her actions are caught on a store security camera. Her father is incensed, less at the destruction of his store than by her exposing him as the father of a mutant, and considers leaving her in prison for 48 hours to punish her. Danielle Moonstar, having seen Sofía&#x27;s vandalism on the news, steps in and offers her a place at the Xavier Institute.

===Xavier Institute===
Resident mischief maker Julian Keller (codenamed Hellion) finds himself instantly attracted to Mantega and begins courting her. She rejects him after he makes derogatory remarks about her roommate, the shy Laurie Collins (later known as Wallflower), but the attraction remains mutual, and despite herself Sofia later ends up flirting with Julian during a combat training exercise. Derek remains in touch, even quitting his job when her father objects to his seeing Sofia.

Sofia and Laurie are assigned to the New Mutants squad, along with a runaway from Japan named Surge, Laurie&#x27;s love interest and former Reaver Elixir, strait-laced David Alleyne (Prodigy), and dangerous but well-intentioned Wither. Sofia is generally well-liked and is voted as &quot;Most Outgoing&quot; in the school&#x27;s yearbook.

Prodigy rejects the offer to lead the New Mutants, so the position falls to Sofia. She becomes isolated and irritable when the group loses their first training exercise, which she blames on her failure to lead. Her command decisions weaken further when Wither is arrested for the accidental death of his father, and she briefly sides with the Hellions, Julian&#x27;s squad, to break him free. After the New Mutants fight the Hellions over the incident, Prodigy talks her into letting Wither go, and she tries to convince him to lead the New Mutants. He insists that Sofía&#x27;s emotionalism has its advantage in a leadership role, but agrees to be co-leader, to better mesh their strengths.

Thereafter, Sofia&#x27;s temper eases again until the school dance, where she catches Laurie manipulating Prodigy to make her ex-boyfriend Elixir jealous. Alarmed by the rapid disintegration of the squad, she finds herself kissing Julian, and he pushes her to end the in-fighting since she is the one who sees the good in everyone - even him. She tries to do so by forcing everyone to get together for a camp-out on the X-Mansion grounds. While bickering and even fist-fighting break out, Sofia is able to eventually reconcile her teammates.

Sofia loses her powers along with 98% of the mutant population when the Scarlet Witch produces a reality-bending spell in an attempt to solve the human/mutant problem. Along with most of the de-powered students, she moves out of the mansion, planning to return to Venezuela with Derek. She leaves the school abruptly without giving Julian notice after she catches him callously denouncing Prodigy after the latter lost his powers.

===New Warriors===
For as-yet-unknown reasons, Sofia moves to New York City, where she lives alone and works as a waitress. She feels directionless in her new &quot;normal&quot; life and has nightmares about losing her powers. During the dream, Sofia enjoyed the pleasures of winged flight. Around this time, Sofia begins to receive strange messages from a group calling itself the New Warriors. The group sends a messenger whom Sofia recognizes as Barry, a young man she knew (and flirted with) from the restaurant she works in. Barry explains that he is a depowered mutant, and is actually her old friend from the Xavier Institute, Beak, whom she did not recognize because of his altered appearance post-M-Day. Beak transports Sofia into the secret base of the New Warriors, but she rejects their efforts to talk her into joining the group.

However, a battle between the New Warriors and a new Zodiac breaks out near the restaurant where Sofia works and she witnesses Cancer kill the New Warrior Longstrike. With the Warriors fighting a losing battle and a little boy caught in the crossfire, Sofia charges towards Cancer, providing enough distraction to give her friends the upper hand. While the superpowered individuals battle, Sofia tries to get the young boy to safety but is blasted from behind. At the hospital, doctors determine Sofia is suffering from burns, a concussion, and various other problems from the attack. During a comatose state, Sofia dreams she is meeting her mother in Heaven and once again bears angel-like wings.

Sofia makes headlines for her heroic deeds during the battle. She is expected to fully recover and has only lost her hair due to surgery. Upon her release from the hospital, Mantega reconsiders Night Thrasher&#x27;s offer to join the team right as he is about to disband the group following the disastrous encounter with the Zodiac.

===Renascence===
Sofia&#x27;s first mission as a New Warrior puts her and the team up against the Alphaclan, a villain team atop of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s most wanted list. While Wondra says Sofia &quot;held her own on her first mission&quot;, the team&#x27;s efforts fall short until Night Thrasher intervenes.

Sofia takes on the codename Renascence while operating with the New Warriors. She continues to waitress at her job and lives off-base as to never be dependent on someone else ever again. After the New Warriors disband Sofia keeps the tech she had been given.

===Krakoa===
A long time later, Sofia somehow heard of the Mojoverse&#x27;s new-found obsession with mutants and started live streaming and climbing the broadcasting charts. After making a poll with her followers, it was revealed the majority wanted to see her die, so she hired Adam X to execute her. Moments before her demise, she addressed the audience one last time: &quot;Let&#x27;s give the people what they want&quot;.

Upon seeing the proof of death, The Five proceeded with her resurrection, returning her powers in the process. After being reunited with Hellion and her other friends, she revealed to them that she had to let herself get killed in order to escape, but Spiral, Adam X and Shatterstar still needed rescuing.

==Powers and abilities==
As the mutant Wind Dancer, Sofia has the ability to control the movement of air, which included the ability to generate wind with intense force, lift and carry objects, fly and, more subtly, amplify small vibrations in the air - allowing her to hear faraway conversations.

She also uses her powers to create a &quot;cutting&quot; effect by refining the force of the wind. When at close range, she can also compress air into a person&#x27;s ear to disrupt their middle ear&#x27;s equilibrium thereby disturbing their balance.

As Renascence, she wore a suit equipped with six metal cybernetic tentacles that could discharge surges of electricity from its claws. She was also equipped with a personal force field that emits a golden aura.

Sofia has some athletic and martial arts skills due to her training as a New Mutant at Xavier&#x27;s and the combat sessions with the New Warriors.

==Other versions==

===House of M===
Wind Dancer is a S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee in the House of M reality. During the House of M crossover (which later led to Decimation), Wind Dancer was shown as a S.H.I.E.L.D trainee, in the Hellions Squad, under Dani Moonstar&#x27;s supervision, and involved in a rather intimate relationship with Scion (Julian&#x27;s counterpart).

In this reality, she battled control against Wallflower&#x27;s pheromones that manipulated the New Mutant Leadership Institute&#x27;s students into fighting with the S.H.I.E.L.D. trainees to the death.

After Wallflower was killed and her influence severed, the surviving young mutants teamed up to attack Emperor Sunfire, who headed Project: Genesis, a plan to mutate baseline humans. Sunfire ordered their death, but reality was reverted before anything further happened.

<text>The Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano (internal code F141) is a grand tourer produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari. It served as the brand&#x27;s front-engined, two-seat model, replacing the 575M Maranello in 2006 as a 2007 model, and was later replaced for the 2013 model year by the F12berlinetta.

Styled by Pininfarina under the direction of Jason Castriota, the 599 GTB debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in February 2006. The bodywork features optimized aerodynamics with distinct sail panels flanking the rear window, directing and maximizing air flow to a linear rear nolder.

The &quot;599&quot; is named for its total engine displacement , Gran Turismo Berlinetta nature, and the Fiorano Circuit test track used by Ferrari.

==Specifications==

===Drivetrain===
The &quot;Tipo F140 C&quot; V12 engine utilised in the 599 produces a maximum power output of between 7,600 rpm to 8,400 rpm, which made it the most powerful series production Ferrari road car at the time of its introduction. When introduced, the engine was one of the few engines whose output exceeded per litre of displacement without the use of forced-induction such as supercharging or turbocharging. Its of torque produced at 5,600 rpm was also a record for Ferrari&#x27;s GT cars at the time. Most of the modifications to the engine were done to allow it to fit in the 599&#x27;s engine bay (the original version used in the Ferrari Enzo would be taller and would block forward vision due to its mid-mounted position construction).

A traditional 6-speed manual transmission was offered, as well as Ferrari&#x27;s 6-speed automated manual paddle-shift transmission called &quot;F1 SuperFast&quot; which had a shift time of 100 milliseconds in the standard 599 or 85 milliseconds if equipped with the HGTE package. The 599 also saw the debut of Ferrari&#x27;s new traction control system, F1-Trac. The vast majority of the 599 GTB&#x27;s were equipped with the automated manual gearbox as opposed to the 6-speed manual gearbox. Only 30 examples were produced with a manual gearbox of which 20 were destined to the United States and 10 remained in Europe leading Ferrari to abandon the use of the manual transmission in its future GT cars. 599 GTB Fiorano was the last V12-engined Ferrari to be equipped with manual transmission.

===Chassis===
The 599 saw the use of an aluminium chassis for the first time in a Ferrari GT car, as opposed to the tubular steel chassis used in its predecessors. The new chassis results in more rigidity and contributes to the low dry weight of as compared to its predecessor, the 575M. The 599 boasts a longer wheelbase than its predecessor and the fuel tank is positioned at the rear in a mid mounted position for better weight distribution. Due to such measures, the 599 has a claimed power to weight ratio of 367 PS per tonne.

===Aerodynamics===
The 599 utilises an underbody spoiler and venturi tunnels that contribute to downforce. The arched C-pillars in a &#x27;flying buttress&#x27; style also aid further in downforce by channeling the air around the rear section thus eliminating the need of a rear wing. The buttresses were initially a styling exercise by exterior designer Jason Castriota. Their aerodynamic effect was proven by Ferrari aerodynamicist Luca Caldirola with the wind tunnel testing. Due to this fact, the 599 generates a claimed of downforce at . The car also has functional brake cooling ducts on the front and rear body panels for improved brake cooling.

===Suspension and brakes===

The 599 utilises magnetorheological semi-active dampers along with its suspension coils. The dampers function by a liquid within the damper reservoir which when subject to magnetic field within the liquid chamber, changes its viscosity. The function of the liquid along with the reaction and stability control are controlled through a knob on the steering wheel. The 599 came with cast iron brakes as standard while the carbon-ceramic brakes (a technology that was scarcely utilised in road cars at the time) were available as an option. The rotors measured at the front and at the rear.

===Interior===
The 599 came with a luxurious leather trimmed interior. The driver&#x27;s seat was positioned slightly towards the centre in order to provide a better driving position. The instrument cluster was a combination of analogue gauges and screens. The shift paddles could either be optioned in aluminium or in carbon fibre and were affixed to the steering column. The three spoke steering wheel housed controls for the car&#x27;s electronic systems as well as a starter button. The interior has a glove box, storage space in the door panels and combination of simple dials and buttons for operating the stereo, climate control and air conditioning. The car has a rear shelf and a boot-lid providing adequate boot space.

== Variants ==
=== 599 HGTE ===

The Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano HGTE (&quot;HGTE&quot; being an abbreviation of Handling Gran Turismo Evoluzione) is an upgrade package for the 599 designed to improve the car&#x27;s handling. It includes a modified set-up with stiffer springs and rear anti-roll bar as well as new calibration settings for the Delphi MagneRide magneto-rheological shock absorbers when the manettino is at its sportier settings. The ride height has also been lowered, resulting in a low centre of gravity. The package also includes optimised tyres featuring a compound that offers improved grip. The car&#x27;s electronic systems were also changed. The gearbox&#x27;s shift times were faster in high-performance settings, while new engine software provided improved response. The exhaust was modified to produce a more marked and thrilling sound under hard usage while still delivering the right comfort levels at cruising speed. The exterior and interior were upgraded with more carbon fibre components and the car also included new 20-inch wheels.

=== 599 GTO ===
On 8 April 2010, Ferrari announced official details of the 599 GTO (for &quot;Gran Turismo Omologato&quot;). The car was a road-legal version of the 599XX track day car and at the time Ferrari claimed that the 599 GTO was their fastest ever road car, able to lap the Fiorano test circuit in 1 minute 24 seconds, one second faster than the Ferrari Enzo. Its engine generated a power output of at 8,250 rpm and of torque at 6,500 rpm. The car has the multiple shift program for the gearbox from the 599XX along with the exhaust system.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.italiaspeed.com/2010/cars&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrari claimed that the 599 GTO could accelerate from in under 3.3 seconds and has a top speed of over . At , the 599 GTO weighs almost less than the standard GTB. Production was to be limited to 599 cars. Of these, approximately 125 were produced for the United States market.

Ferrari has produced only two other models that used the GTO designation: the 1962 250 GTO and the 1984 288 GTO with the third being the 599 GTO. Unlike the previous GTOs however, the 599 GTO was not designed for homologation in any racing series.

=== 599XX ===

At the 2009 Geneva Motor Show, Ferrari unveiled the track-only iteration of the 599 GTB, dubbed the 599XX. Designed by Ferrari&#x27;s Formula-one engineers, the car has many changes over the standard car in order to make it more nimble and responsive on a race track. Exterior enhancements included two winglets on the C-pillars for improved downforce, a vented bonnet for improved engine cooling, darkened lexan tail lamps, a carbon fibre &#x27;ducktail&#x27; rear spoiler aiding further in downforce, a large rear diffuser for improved under body airflow, tow hooks at the front and rear, additional ducts for improved cooling, a minimalist race interior with racing bucket seats along with an LCD display behind the steering wheel replacing all analogue gauges equipped with a roll-cage and lexan sliding windows. The car also has two fans that were located in the trunk and worked to keep the car on the ground and stopped working at speeds up to , a speed at which the car needed no additional downforce. With all such components, the car was reported to generate of downforce at and of downforce at . The air conditioning system was retained for added driver comfort. The car had nine traction and stability control modes, all controlled from the manettino dial on the steering wheel. The car was equipped with F1 inspired carbon ceramic brakes with crossed drilled rotors and a new race exhaust system. The rev limiter was raised to 9,000 rpm, with the engine rated at at 9,000 rpm. Weight was reduced by reducing the weight of the engine components such as a new carbon fibre intake manifold and graphite coated pistons along with a lightweight crankshaft, as well as through the use of composite materials and the use of carbon fibre body parts. A new gearbox was introduced to cut overall gear change time to 60 milliseconds, holding the upward or downward shift paddle for longer resulted in multiple shifts that improved gearing time. The car also included 29/67 R19 front and 31/71 R19 rear racing slicks with 19 × 11J wheels at the front and 19 × 12J at the rear. The 599XX was capable of accelerating from in 2.9 seconds and attained a top speed of (redline limited top speed).

At the 2010 Beijing International Auto Show, Ferrari announced that the 599XX had completed the Nordschleife circuit at the Nürburgring in a time of 6 minutes and 58.16 seconds – the fastest lap time ever recorded for a production-derived sports car. This time was later beaten by the Pagani Zonda R in June 2010, which completed the lap in 6 minutes and 47.50 seconds.

=== 599XX Evoluzione ===

On November 10, 2011, the first images of the 599XX Evoluzione surfaced, which had a radically restyled aero and exhaust package as well as electronic upgrades and Pirelli racing slicks. On 1 December 2011, Ferrari confirmed details for the 599XX Evoluzione in preparation for the 2011 Bologna Motor Show. The 599XX Evoluzione weighed less than the standard 599XX and the engine had slightly improved peak power of and of torque. One of the key features of the Evoluzione is its active rear wing which can adjust automatically to provide increased cornering performance.

==Special variants==

===SA Aperta===
The roadster variant of the 599, the SA Aperta, was introduced at the 2010 Paris Motor Show as a limited edition in honour of designers Sergio Pininfarina and Andrea Pininfarina, with the &quot;SA&quot; designation standing for both their names. The SA Aperta utilised the higher performance engine and gearbox from the 599 GTO and has a lower ride height, thicker rear anti roll bar and recalibrated magnetic dampers. The SA Aperta also has a slightly raked windscreen as compared to the 599 GTB along with larger cooling ducts in the new front bumper and a rear bumper in body colour. The car has a removable soft top that was only intended for use in city driving and to protect the interior from rain. The boot-lid was made of aluminium while the C-pillars were made of carbon fibre and have a silver finish along with the windshield frame. The exhaust system was a modified version of the one used in the 599XX and the car has special 5-spoke wheels unique to the variant with a chromed finish along with a triple layer body paint. The interior was also redesigned and has a two-tone colour scheme and the car has sports seats as standard equipment. Only 80 examples were produced, honoring the 80th anniversary of Pininfarina and all were sold before the car was unveiled to the public. 
===599 GTB 60F1===

In December 2011, Ferrari announced a special edition of the 599 GTB to celebrate 60 years of their wins in F1. From Froilán González&#x27;s win at Silverstone in 1951 with the 375 F1, to Fernando Alonso&#x27;s win at Silverstone in 2011 in the 150° Italia, Ferrari have been winning hundreds of F1 races. The car was based on the 599 HGTE chassis, that utilised stiff suspension, shorter springs and stiffer anti-roll bars. The new 20&quot; diamond-finished forged alloy wheels and Scuderia Ferrari shields came on the body as standard. There were three choices of paint finishes to choose from: 
* The colours of the 375 F1 – darker and standing out more than Ferrari Rosso
* The colours of the 150° Italia, with the Italian tricolore styled mini spoiler at the back and the white parts of the front spoiler on the body
* Another version of the 150° Italia but without the white a-pillars.

The interior in the European version of the car has Sabelt bucket seats whereas the US version featured Recaro bucket seats, both being made from Alcantara.

==One-off models==

===P540 Superfast Aperta===

The Ferrari P540 Superfast Aperta is a one-off convertible sports car based on the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano. This car represents the second car in Ferrari&#x27;s Special Project program.

Edward Walson commissioned the car in 2008, asking Ferrari to build a modern interpretation of the gold covered Carrozzeria Fantuzzi-bodied Ferrari 330 LMB built for the 1968 film &quot;Spirits of the Dead&quot;. The P540 was revealed to the public on 11 December 2009, but had been spotted in spy shots several months previous to this.

Designed by Pininfarina and built in Maranello, this car was designed to comply with international safety and homologation requirements. Using finite element analysis and carbon fibre, the car&#x27;s chassis was stiffened for the conversion to a convertible body style. As it is based on the 599 GTB F1, many of the specifications of the P540 are similar to its donor car. Total time of development was 14 months.

===Superamerica 45===
The Ferrari Superamerica 45 is a one-off with a rotating targa hardtop based on the 599 GTB, that was commissioned to Ferrari by longtime Ferrari enthusiast and collector Peter Kalikow to commemorate his 45 years as a Ferrari client. Part of Ferrari&#x27;s Special Project programme, it was designed at Centro Stile Ferrari and engineered in-house by Ferrari.
The car made its public debut at Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este on 20 May 2011.

The carbon fibre hardtop roof incorporates a rear screen and rotates around a horizontal axis behind the cabin, a mechanism similar to that of the 2005 Ferrari Superamerica. The boot, also made from carbon fibre, has been redesigned to house the roof when open and to increase downforce at the rear of the car. As well as being finished in Blu Antille, other key visual features include a chromed front grille, body coloured wheels, carbon fibre panels and special burnished aluminum A-pillars, wing mirrors and door handles.
The interior features a combination of Cuoio leather trim and Blu Scuro carbon fibre as well as a latest-generation touch-screen infotainment system.

=== 599 GTZ Nibbio Zagato ===
The Zagato 599 GTZ Nibbio was introduced in 2007 by Zagato and was based on the Ferrari 599 GTB. It was limited to only nine units worldwide, seven of which were built with the F1 automated manual transmission and two with the 6-speed manual. Two of the ones with the F1 automated manual transmission are spyder. The manual coupe car, painted dark blue with a white top half, was listed for sale in December 2018 for US$1.495 million at Tomini Classics in Dubai. The design of the GTZ Nibbio is inspired by various coach built sports from the 1950s and 1960s.
===SP30===

The Ferrari SP30 is a one-off based on the 599 GTO and completed in 2013. It is the fifth project completed by Ferrari&#x27;s special projects division and it includes elements from the 599XX and the F12 which was released a few months earlier. It was commissioned by Cheerag Arya, the owner of a petrochemical company. The car&#x27;s VIN is ZFF70RDT7B0188026. The car was then seized by the government of Abu Dhabi and was exported to the USA where it still resides today.
==Prototype==
&quot;Motor Authority&quot; reported that Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo was working on the development of a Ferrari model that would use alternative energy sources and which would be based on what Ferrari is doing in Formula 1, which uses Kinetic Energy Recovery System. The KERS was tested using a 599 as a test mule. The model was later revealed to be the LaFerrari.

==Awards==
*&quot;Evo&quot; magazine named the 599 GTB as the Car of the Year for 2006.
*&quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; also named the 599 GTB as the Supercar of the Year 2006.

==Successor==

The successor to the 599 was announced on 29 February 2012, a few days prior to the Geneva Motor Show. Ferrari released a video featuring Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa driving the car at Ferrari&#x27;s own test track, the Pista di Fiorano. The car, named the F12berlinetta, was officially unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show on 6 March 2012.

<text>Surge (Noriko &quot;Nori&quot; Ashida) is a superhero appearing in the American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is depicted as a mutant, a member of the student body of the Xavier Institute, and a member of the former New Mutants squad. She maintained her powers post M-Day and was the leader of the New X-Men.

==Publication history==

Surge was created by Nunzio DeFilippis, Christina Weir, Keron Grant and first appeared in &quot;New Mutants&quot;, vol. 2 #8 (January 2004).
She would become a main character in the monthly series &quot;New X-Men&quot; Volume 2, appearing in the series from 2004 to 2008. 

Surge became a member of X-Force for the &quot;From the Ashes&quot; relaunch of X-Men, joining in the first issue until her death in the fifth issue.

==Fictional character biography==
Noriko Ashida was born in Japan. She was close to her brother, Keitaro, but she ran away from home after her powers manifested when she was thirteen years old; she claimed that her father &quot;doesn&#x27;t believe in mutants.&quot; How she came to the United States is unknown, but she ended up homeless on the streets of Salem Center, reduced to buying illegal drugs using stolen money. With no training or practice in the use of her powers, Noriko&#x27;s body automatically absorbs all nearby electricity and, once fully charged, releases it in a storm of electrical bolts. Additionally, her acceleration ability forces her to speak so quickly that no one can understand her. Though she finds no treatment for most of these problems, the drugs sedate her body enough that she can control her outbursts of electrical power. Keeping herself regularly supplied proves impossible, however, and during a robbery, Noriko accidentally hits the young owner of a coffee shop with an electric bolt. A group of young mutants finds her and brings her back to the X-Mansion. There, Beast designs gauntlets that regulate her absorption of ambient electricity and discharge as required to prevent further mental overloads.

Nori becomes a student of the Xavier Institute and, when the school adopts a squad system, is assigned to the New Mutants squad led by Danielle Moonstar. She is forced to share a room with Dust; the two young women disagree upon the role of women and the Muslim traditions that Dust follows. Though initially hostile to the mutants who took her off the street - David Alleyne, Josh Foley, Sofia Mantega, and Laurie Collins - she soon comes to accept them as her friends.

David asks Emma Frost to remove a mental block in his mind inhibiting him from recalling all the information and skills he has acquired. David sees a possible future in which he becomes the world&#x27;s foremost genius, marries Noriko, and leads to her death. Disturbed, David begins to avoid her. Annoyed at such treatment, Nori ultimately confronts David, which leads to the two becoming an active couple.

Noriko retains her powers after the events of House of M. With only 27 students retaining their powers, Emma Frost orders the depowered students and staff, including Nori&#x27;s advisor Danielle Moonstar, to leave the institute. As it departs, one bus of depowered students is bombed by anti-mutant zealot Reverend William Stryker, killing all on board. Though depowered, David is not killed, and he and Nori further their romantic relationship. Most of the remaining students are organized into a melee fight to determine who would become a member of Emma Frost&#x27;s X-Men-in-training. Nori is chosen by Frost to be the team&#x27;s leader. Soon afterwards, Nori receives new, lighter, and more effective gauntlets from Forge.

Caught in an argument over the rescue of Cessily, Surge and Hellion are the only students that are not teleported to Limbo. Trance uses her powers to get a message to the two, informing them that the Institute students had been taken into Limbo by Belasco, and that Belasco killed David. Coordinating with O*N*E*, Surge and Hellion discover that Amanda Sefton has been expelled from Limbo and is in a coma in Germany. Surge becomes impulsive and angry at David&#x27;s death, threatening the O*N*E* troopers when they attempt to block her from seeing Sefton, using her electrical powers to revive the sorceress despite the risks. At the behest of Lexington, Megaton&#x27;s pilot, Surge and Hellion stop fighting demons and head for the castle. Surge leads the united Xavier Institute students against the demonic hordes, engaging the twisted sorcerer in single combat before Belasco is killed by Pixie and Darkchild. The institute is returned to Earth, at Santo&#x27;s insistence.

After their return from Limbo, Surge finds out from X-23 the torture David went through in Limbo. In hopes of driving him away from the school and out of harm&#x27;s way, Surge kisses Hellion in front of David and the other students. After confronting her of the incident, she insists that she doesn&#x27;t love him anymore and pleads that he should leave the institute. This backfires, as David regains his memories of the knowledge he once had and copied up until he lost his power with the help of the Stepford Cuckoos. David decides to both stay at the Institute and end their relationship.

Following the dissolution of the X-Men, Surge runs to Colorado, seeking help from Dani Moonstar. Nori is overwhelmed by the pain she has endured as a New X-Man and doesn&#x27;t know how to cope. Nori realizes that her fear of being hurt has affected her judgment and driven her actions over the past months. She later officially joins the X-Men based out of San Francisco: she is seen working on one of the street crime patrols.

Surge is later kidnapped along with Boom Boom and Hellion by the Leper Queen and her Sapien League. The Leper Queen injects her with a modified version of the Legacy Virus. X-Force rescues their friends after completing their mission. Elixir is able to cure Surge before she could destroy the UN.

The reader next sees Surge defending the Golden Gate bridge during the &#x27;Second Coming&#x27; event in which Bastion assaults the X-Men, who is in search of the &#x27;Mutant Messiah&#x27; Hope Summers. Once again Nori is devastated when yet another teammate is injured during the initial Nimrod attack, destroying the hands of Hellion. Plunged into the waters of San Francisco Bay by Bastions last ditch attack, Nori witnesses Hope Summers emerge as the Mutant Messiah.

==Powers and abilities==
Surge absorbs electricity continuously, from sources like static in the air, electrical appliances, and outlets, often causing lights to flicker. She can&#x27;t control the absorption, requiring her to wear specially designed gauntlets all the time to regulate it. Surge can discharge the energy through powerful lightning-like blasts or channel it into bursts of superhuman speed. If she absorbs too much energy, it causes mental overloads, making her speak too fast, scatter her thinking, and worsen her control over the blasts.

Her blue hair is not related to her mutation. According to Nori, it came in a bottle labeled &quot;electric blue&quot; (and, indeed, she debuted with black hair).

==Personality==
Very forthright and strong-minded, Nori often clashes with her peers and superiors, from nearly getting into a brawl with Hellion after he insulted Prodigy&#x27;s baseline status post-M-Day, and challenging Cyclops&#x27; assertion that the students are safe at the institute (this taking place immediately after a series of devastating attacks by the Purifiers). Nori also considers herself a feminist, attacking Dust&#x27;s choice of garb as a betrayal of women&#x27;s rights when the two are roomed together.

Regardless, Nori is a loyal figure, dedicated to her friends and increasingly feeling the responsibilities placed upon her as the leader of the New X-Men. Surge was particularly incensed by Hellion&#x27;s decision to rescue Mercury from the Faculty without backup, taking it upon herself to mold the team into an effective unit capable of defending the rest of the students. She has trouble welcoming X-23 back to the team after the latter&#x27;s involvement in X-Force, possibly due to how the latter seemingly doesn&#x27;t have to take responsibility for what she did as part of that team, in comparison to her own mounting responsibilities. Chris Yost has stated that, &quot;Surge is the right candidate, because she wants it the least. And you&#x27;ll see, it&#x27;s taking a big toll on her. Being a leader when you&#x27;re doing team sports and field day exercises is one thing, but leading when the stakes are life and death is another thing.&quot;

==Other versions==
===House of M===
An alternate universe variant of Nori appears in the &quot;House of M&quot; tie-in &quot;New X-Men: Academy X&quot; as a member of the Hellions, a group of junior S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and the daughter of a human terrorist father, who she was separated from at a young age. Due his involvement during one of the group&#x27;s missions, Nori is ousted from the Hellions and replaced with Magic. Nonetheless, she recruits help from students of the New Mutant Leadership Institute in traveling to Japan, where they encounter Project Genesis.

===Ultimate Universe===
An alternate universe variant of Noriko Ashida from Earth-6160 appears in the 2024 relaunch of &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;.

During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker visited Earth-6160 and started remaking it into his own image. Noriko Ashida was seen having recorded the footage of Hisako Ichiki using her powers. With her mobile phone not having been zapped by Mei Igarashi, Noriko uploads the footage a few days later.

Shinobu Kageyama was later approached by Noriko who asked if he can fix her computer. She was turned down by Shinobu and Noriko left to go to work.

As a member of the Children of the Atom, Noriko was checked on by one of their doctors and is told that Shinobu is not accepting visitors at this point.

After a talk with a fellow Children of the Atom member, Noriko secretly live-streams Maester&#x27;s speech to the Children of the Atom.

<doc id="1252973" wikidata="Q710727" url="?curid=1252973" title="Cheung Po Tsai">
<text>Cheung Po Tsai (; born Cheung Po; 1783–1822) was a navy colonel of the Qing dynasty and a former pirate. &quot;Cheung Po Tsai&quot; literally means &quot;Cheung Po the Kid&quot;. He was known to the Portuguese Navy as &quot;Quan Apon Chay&quot; during the Battle of the Tiger&#x27;s Mouth.
==History==
===Early life===

Cheung Po () was born in 1783. He was a son of a Tanka fisherman who lived in Xinhui of Jiangmen.

===Piratical career===
Around 1798, he was abducted at age 15 by the pirate Cheng I (), who pressed him into piracy.

His natural talent helped him adapt to his unplanned new career and he rose through the ranks swiftly. Cheung Po Tsai was later adopted by Cheng I and Ching I Sao (); &quot;wife of Cheng I&quot;; married 1801) as their step-son, making him Cheng&#x27;s legal heir.

Cheung Po Tsai&#x27;s piracy mate and lieutenant was Cai Qian () and the two worked together. Cai Qian had strong connections to the Western weapon dealers as his wife Lu Shi (; &quot;Mrs. Lu&quot;), best known by her nickname Cai Qian Ma (; &quot;wife of Cai Qian&quot;), was fluent in English and an expert in Western weaponry.

===Rise to command===
After Cheng I died suddenly in Vietnam in 1807, his widow Ching Shih acted quickly to solidify the partnership with her step-son Cheung Po Tsai. Their first success came when they were able to secure the loyalty of Cheng&#x27;s relatives, who were leaders in the fleet. They became lovers and shared power.

As Ching Shih&#x27;s second-in-command, Cheung Po Tsai was active along the Guangdong coastal area during the Qing dynasty. Their followers were said to have reached 50,000+ and his fleet said to have possessed 600 ships.

The tide began to turn in 1809. The authorities managed to discover that Cai Qian was docked in the coastal town of Wuzhen, Zhejiang province. The new naval leaders, Wang Delu and Qiu Lianggong, blockaded him into the port and attacked, sinking Cai Qian&#x27;s ship and killing him.

===Battle of the Tiger&#x27;s Mouth===

In September and November 1809, Cheung Po Tsai&#x27;s pirate fleet suffered a series of defeats inflicted by the Portuguese Navy at the Battle of the Tiger&#x27;s Mouth.

===Battle of Chek Lap Kok===
On 20 April 1810 at Furongsha in Guangdong, Cheung Po Tsai formally delivered his fleet and weapons, which now numbered about 280 ships, 2,000 guns and over 25,000 men. The Portuguese claimed naught, while the governor of Guangdong accepted his surrender.

===As Qing Naval Officer===
Cheung and Ching accepted an amnesty offered by the Qing government, ending their career and allowed to keep the loot. Cheung Po Tsai reverted to his former name. Afterwards, he was capitulated to the Qing dynasty government and became a captain in the Qing&#x27;s Guangdong navy, receiving the rank of navy colonel. He was given the command of a total of 30 ships, allowed to retain 30 private fleets, and an appointment in Penghu. He would spend the rest of his life helping the government to fight other pirates.

Cheung Po and Ching Shih were later married with Governor Bailing as witness.

Cheung Po would make future formal visits to the Leal Senado of Macau to meet several of the Portuguese officers who present at the fighting, among them was Gonçalves Carocha.

In 1813, Ching Shih gave birth to his son, Cheung Yu Lin. She would later have a daughter who was born at an unknown date.

==Death==
After Cheung Po died at sea in 1822 at age 39, his widow moved the family to Macau and there she opened a gambling house and was involved in the salt trade.

==Legacy==

Several places in Hong Kong are linked to Cheung Po Tsai:

* Cheung Po Tsai Cave, on Cheung Chau island. It is a small natural cave, said to be the place where he stored his prizes. In addition, there are also Cheung Po Tsai Caves at Lamma Island, Tap Mun, Sai Wan, Chung Hom Kok, Chek Chau, Siu Kau Yi Chau and Longxue Island, Guangzhou.
* Cheung Po Tsai built several temples dedicated to the goddess Tin Hau and seafaring activities on Ma Wan, Cheung Chau, and Stanley.

==In popular culture==
* The 1973 Hong Kong action film &quot;The Pirate (大海盜)&quot; has Cheung Po Tsai as its lead character, he was portrayed by Ti Lung.
* The 1983 Hong Kong action film &quot;Project A&quot; depicts a character based on Cheung Po Tsai. The lead villain, San Po (played by Dick Wei) is a pirate with similar characteristics. &quot;Project A&quot;&#x27;s time period is a composite of several in Hong Kong&#x27;s history.
* The 1994 Hong Kong action film &quot;Once Upon a Time in China V&quot; has Cheung Po Tsai as one of the main villains opposing the protagonist Wong Fei-Hung. As the movie apocryphally takes place shortly after the Boxer Rebellion, however (over seventy years after Cheung Po Tsai had historically lived), Cheung is depicted in that movie as an extremely old man. He was portrayed by Yee Tin-hung.
* The movie &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; depicts a pirate named Sao Feng as a member of the Brethren Court. This character is based on Cheung Po Tsai, although the film was set many years before he lived. He is portrayed by actor Chow Yun-Fat.
* In the anime &quot;One Piece&quot;, one of the characters, Scratchman Apoo, is influenced by Cheung Po Tsai.
* The Aqua Luna junk ship is named after Cheung Po Tsai.
* Tony Hung portrays Cheung Po Tsai in the 2015 Hong Kong television drama &quot;Captain of Destiny&quot;, a historical sci-fi series about a 21st-century police officer who meets Cheung Po Tsai after traveling back in time.
*The urban legend of Cheung Po Tsai was one of the twelve legends referenced on the TVB series Our Unwinding Ethos.

<text>Stagecoach West Scotland is an operating region of Stagecoach UK Bus, comprising Western Buses Ltd based in Ayr, Scotland.

== History ==
Stagecoach arrived in the west of Scotland when it purchased Western Scottish Omnibuses Ltd of Kilmarnock for £6 million in July 1994. Western Scottish was, at that time, owned by its management and employees, who had purchased the company from the state-owned Scottish Bus Group in October 1991 on the breakup and privatisation of that concern.

Stagecoach wasted no time in expanding its operations in the west of Scotland, and in October 1994 purchased the small Arran Transport business based in Brodick, on the Isle Of Arran. In January 1995 Western took over the operations of A1 Service of Ardrossan, bringing with it around 75 vehicles and the company&#x27;s operations in the towns of Ardrossan, Saltcoats, Stevenston and Kilwinning, together with the very busy and frequent Ardrossan to Kilmarnock service. Though for a time the former A1 Service operations were under the separate legal entity of Stagecoach (A1 Service) Ltd, that company has since been absorbed by Western Buses.

Clyde Coast Coaches of Ardrossan, a previous competitor to Western Scottish in services around Kilmarnock, sold its bus operations to Western in 1995, adding services from Saltcoats to Largs and Beith to the Western portfolio.

The last &#x27;big&#x27; purchase Stagecoach Western has made to date was that of AA Buses, the bus operations of Dodd&#x27;s Of Troon, on 1 May 1997. At the same time the bus operations of Shuttle Buses of Kilwinning were also absorbed. This would add local bus operation around Irvine, Stewarton and Troon, and would consolidate the Stagecoach Western operation, securing it as the dominant operator in north Ayrshire, a role Western Scottish never succeeded in filling.

Stagecoach operated in Glasgow as Magic Bus in the late 1980s using old London AEC Routemaster buses, though it sold the operation to Kelvin Central Buses (KCB) in the early 1990s. After a stillborn attempt in 1995 to purchase KCB, Stagecoach settled for a 20% stake in competitor Strathclyde Buses who purchased KCB, the present Stagecoach Glasgow operations were launched in 1997, after Strathclyde Buses sold to FirstGroup, and offered fast, direct and frequent services from Glasgow City Centre to Easterhouse, Castlemilk, Pollok, Darnley, East Kilbride and Cumbernauld. 

The Pollok and Darnley routes were express services which made good use of the new M77 motorway in the area and used new low floor vehicles. However, due to First Glasgow&#x27;s new operations in Stagecoach&#x27;s key Ayrshire and Fife markets Stagecoach decided to scale down operations in the area. It acquired Arriva Scotland West&#x27;s 49% stake in Paisley company Dart Buses. Dart took over operation of the Pollok and Darnley services, which were closer to its base in Paisley and more in fitting with the rest of its west of Glasgow motorway express services. Stagecoach supplied vehicles to operate the routes, which continued under the &quot;Stagecoach Glasgow&quot; livery and brand, while several Dart vehicles were repainted into the Stagecoach corporate livery. Dart Buses ran into financial trouble early in the new millennium and without notice ceased operations overnight in October 2001. First registered the defunct company&#x27;s motorway services before either Arriva or Stagecoach could, and as such Stagecoach decided not to restart operations.

The East Kilbride services were soon withdrawn, some regarding the timetabling of it as optimistic, and the remaining operations were rebranded as the &quot;no-frills&quot; Magic Bus with rock bottom fares and older vehicles. The Castlemilk operation was taken over by FirstGroup in June 2005 who until January 2006 kept the old Stagecoach service 175 running alongside its own 75 service. Vehicles in the Magic Bus operation wear a deep blue livery with bright yellow lettering, complete with slogans &quot;It&#x27;s magic!&quot; and &quot;It goes roon the toon!&quot; (sic), the latter imitating the Glasgow dialect. Though the Ballieston service was withdrawn during summer 2006, the Easterhouse service is still operated, though now by &quot;Stagecoach in Glasgow&quot; branded vehicles, the Magic Bus brand having been dropped in the city.

In July 2004, Stagecoach announced the acquisition of the M8 Motorvator Glasgow to Edinburgh express service from Lanarkshire firm, Longs Coaches. This pitched Stagecoach in fierce and direct competition from Scottish Citylink, a company Stagecoach ironically operated vehicles for under a franchise agreement. Stagecoach continued to use the distinctive M8 Motorvator brand on this route, with vehicles wearing a red and off-white livery, and was operated by Stagecoach Glasgow Ltd. Some seats on the Motorvator service were available for purchase through the low-cost Stagecoach subsidiary Megabus. Both companies offered fast, frequent and affordable express services along the M8 motorway corridor between the two Scottish cities, a situation that continued until 13 September 2005. On that date, Stagecoach and Citylink parent company ComfortDelGro announced a joint venture in the provision of express coach services in Scotland. Under the terms of the agreement, Stagecoach would take a 35% stake in Citylink in return for certain rights to the Megabus brand in Scotland. This ended competition between the two operators and the withdrawal of the Motorvator brand. Stagecoach has resumed operating vehicles for Citylink under a franchise agreement, and many vehicles that operated as Motorvator now wear Citylink livery. However this sale is being investigated by the office of fair trading.

During 2006, Stagecoach introduced several new express services, including the short-lived X33 from Ayr to Paisley later extended to Braehead Shopping Centre, of which part of the route from Ayr to Paisley was originally operated by Western until the 1970s, albeit using a slightly different route. The X33 service was the first time the company had strayed into the heartlands of &#x27;Clydeside&#x27; Another new service was the X16 connecting Ayr with Hamilton and East Kilbride via Kilmarnock, although the service was reduced to only serve between Ayr and Kilmarnock from summer 2020 due to low passenger usage, before being withdrawn completely among a number of service cuts from 17 July 2022.

==Operations==
Stagecoach West Scotland operates in west central and southwest Scotland, in an area bounded by Largs and Braehead to the north, Hamilton to the east, Stranraer and Lockerbie to the south and the Isle of Arran to the west. Frequent express services also reach Glasgow and Edinburgh from throughout Ayrshire &amp; the X74 from Dumfries.

Stagecoach West Scotland operates under Stagecoach Western which is the prevalent brand and is used for the vast majority of bus operations throughout the West Scotland region. Most Stagecoach Western branded vehicles wear the old Stagecoach corporate livery of red, blue, orange and white, while the remainder wear the new Stagecoach corporate liveries. It is the principal trading name of Western Buses Ltd.

The company also provide vehicles for Scottish Citylink express work, mainly on the Glasgow to Edinburgh corridor, and also for Megabus, mainly running from Aberdeen to London.

Stagecoach West Scotland had faced sustained competition from the FirstGroup between Ardrossan and Kilmarnock since Stagecoach launched its network of Glasgow city services in the heart of First&#x27;s Glasgow operating territory in 1997, though First withdrew from Ayrshire in October 2005 leaving Stagecoach the sole dominant operator once again. While minor competition existed for several years from T &amp; E Docherty around Irvine, Stagecoach has since purchased the routes and vehicles used by that operator. Minor competition exists from Shuttle Buses between Kilwinning and Kilmarnock (including local operation in Irvine) and McGill&#x27;s Bus Services in Largs.

At both the 2005 and 2006 UK Bus Awards, Stagecoach West Scotland took the top award of &#x27;UK Bus Operator of the Year&#x27;, having narrowly missed out on the prize in 2004. It also received the &#x27;Best Large Fleet Operator&#x27; award at the industry ceremony for both years.

<text>John Stears (25 August 1934 – 28 April 1999) was an English special effects artist. A two-time Academy Award winner, nicknamed the &quot;Dean of Special Effects,&quot; he was responsible for creating a host of iconic movie gadgets and effects, including James Bond&#x27;s lethal Aston Martin DB5, Luke Skywalker&#x27;s Landspeeder, the Jedi Knights&#x27; lightsabers, the Death Star, and the robots R2-D2 and C-3PO.
== Life and family ==
Stears was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex (now part of Greater London) on 25 August 1934 and grew up in nearby Ickenham. Stears studied at Harrow College of Art and Southall Technical School before working as a draughtsman with the Air Ministry.

He served as a dispatch rider during his National Service, then joined a firm of architects where he was able to utilise his passion for model-making by constructing scale models of building projects for clients.

For most of his life he lived at Welders House in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, where he reared cattle and his wife ran the Livny Borzoi Kennels, breeding Borzoi show dogs.

In 1993, he sold his Welders House country estate in Buckinghamshire to the singer Ozzy Osbourne and emigrated to California with his wife Brenda, whom he married in 1960, the couple had two children.

== Film career ==
Stears&#x27; effects featured in the first eight James Bond films, winning an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1965 for &quot;Thunderball,&quot; and sharing another Academy Award in 1977 for &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

He created some of the most famous scenes in the movies. He blew up the villain&#x27;s Jamaican hideout at the end of &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), and for &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), he created Agent 007&#x27;s Aston Martin DB5, featuring bullet-proof windows, revolving licence plates, forward-firing machine guns, a rear oil-slick dispenser and a passenger-side ejector seat.

He also created an avalanche for &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969) and built flying cars for the musical film &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968) and the Bond film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974).

Stears grew disenchanted with the Bond franchise, and vowed never to do another one. He complained that the &quot;team spirit&quot; had gone. Stears expressed great regret that Kevin McClory could not get his rival Bond film, &quot;Warhead&quot;, into production, as Stears wanted to work on that film.

In 1976, Stears received a telephone call from George Lucas, who had been a great admirer of the Bond films, who wanted to know if he was interested in creating mechanical and electrical effects for a film that he had written, &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Stears accepted the offer. Stears had something in common with Alec Guinness and John Williams; he had won an Academy Award before working on &quot;Star Wars&quot;.
For &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), Stears created the robots R2-D2 and C-3PO, Luke Skywalker&#x27;s Landspeeder, the special effects for the Jedi Knights&#x27; lightsabers - the first lightsaber hilt props having been created for Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) by Roger Christian -, and the Death Star. Stears was also credited, along with John Dykstra, for the original film&#x27;s climactic aerial dogfight. Other well known mechanical effects Stears orchestrated included the garbage compactor, making an X-wing fighter fly and the Jawa&#x27;s sandcrawler. 

In 1978, producer Harry Saltzman hired Stears to direct the &quot;shrunken man&quot; epic film &quot;The Micronauts&quot;. The troubled project had been in pre-production for many years and saw many directors come and go; ultimately the film never made it into production.

<doc id="1252991" wikidata="Q274511" url="?curid=1252991" title="Orbital hybridisation">
<text>In chemistry, orbital hybridisation (or hybridization) is the concept of mixing atomic orbitals to form new &quot;hybrid orbitals&quot; (with different energies, shapes, etc., than the component atomic orbitals) suitable for the pairing of electrons to form chemical bonds in valence bond theory. For example, in a carbon atom which forms four single bonds, the valence-shell s orbital combines with three valence-shell p orbitals to form four equivalent sp3 mixtures in a tetrahedral arrangement around the carbon to bond to four different atoms. Hybrid orbitals are useful in the explanation of molecular geometry and atomic bonding properties and are symmetrically disposed in space. Usually hybrid orbitals are formed by mixing atomic orbitals of comparable energies.

== History and uses ==

Chemist Linus Pauling first developed the hybridisation theory in 1931 to explain the structure of simple molecules such as methane (CH4) using atomic orbitals. Pauling pointed out that a carbon atom forms four bonds by using one s and three p orbitals, so that &quot;it might be inferred&quot; that a carbon atom would form three bonds at right angles (using p orbitals) and a fourth weaker bond using the s orbital in some arbitrary direction. In reality, methane has four C–H bonds of equivalent strength. The angle between any two bonds is the tetrahedral bond angle of 109°28&#x27; (around 109.5°). Pauling supposed that in the presence of four hydrogen atoms, the s and p orbitals form four equivalent combinations which he called &quot;hybrid&quot; orbitals. Each hybrid is denoted sp3 to indicate its composition, and is directed along one of the four C–H bonds. This concept was developed for such simple chemical systems, but the approach was later applied more widely, and today it is considered an effective heuristic for rationalizing the structures of organic compounds. It gives a simple orbital picture equivalent to Lewis structures.

Hybridisation theory is an integral part of organic chemistry, one of the most compelling examples being Baldwin&#x27;s rules. For drawing reaction mechanisms sometimes a classical bonding picture is needed with two atoms sharing two electrons. Hybridisation theory explains bonding in alkenes and methane. The amount of p character or s character, which is decided mainly by orbital hybridisation, can be used to reliably predict molecular properties such as acidity or basicity.

== Overview ==
Orbitals are a model representation of the behavior of electrons within molecules. In the case of simple hybridization, this approximation is based on atomic orbitals, similar to those obtained for the hydrogen atom, the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved exactly. In heavier atoms, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, the atomic orbitals used are the 2s and 2p orbitals, similar to excited state orbitals for hydrogen.

Hybrid orbitals are assumed to be mixtures of atomic orbitals, superimposed on each other in various proportions. For example, in methane, the C hybrid orbital which forms each carbon–hydrogen bond consists of 25% s character and 75% p character and is thus described as sp3 (read as &quot;s-p-three&quot;) hybridised. Quantum mechanics describes this hybrid as an sp3 wavefunction of the form formula_1, where N is a normalisation constant (here 1/2) and pσ is a p orbital directed along the C-H axis to form a sigma bond. The ratio of coefficients (denoted λ in general) is formula_2 in this example. Since the electron density associated with an orbital is proportional to the square of the wavefunction, the ratio of p-character to s-character is λ2 = 3. The p character or the weight of the p component is N2λ2 = 3/4.

== Types of hybridisation ==

=== sp3 ===

Hybridisation describes the bonding of atoms from an atom&#x27;s point of view. For a tetrahedrally coordinated carbon (e.g., methane CH4), the carbon should have 4 orbitals directed towards the 4 hydrogen atoms.

Carbon&#x27;s ground state configuration is 1s2 2s2 2p2 or more easily read:

This diagram suggests that the carbon atom could use its two singly occupied p-type orbitals to form two covalent bonds with two hydrogen atoms in a methylene (CH2) molecule, with a hypothetical bond angle of 90° corresponding to the angle between two p orbitals on the same atom. However the true H–C–H angle in singlet methylene is about 102° which implies the presence of some orbital hybridisation.

The carbon atom can also bond to four hydrogen atoms in methane by an excitation (or promotion) of an electron from the doubly occupied 2s orbital to the empty 2p orbital, producing four singly occupied orbitals.


The energy released by the formation of two additional bonds more than compensates for the excitation energy required, energetically favoring the formation of four C-H bonds.

According to quantum mechanics the lowest energy is obtained if the four bonds are equivalent, which requires that they are formed from equivalent orbitals on the carbon. A set of four equivalent orbitals can be obtained that are linear combinations of the valence-shell (core orbitals are almost never involved in bonding) s and p wave functions, which are the four sp3 hybrids.

In CH4, four sp3 hybrid orbitals are overlapped by hydrogen 1s orbitals, yielding four σ (sigma) bonds (that is, four single covalent bonds) of equal length and strength.

The following :

translates into :
=== sp2 ===


Other carbon compounds and other molecules may be explained in a similar way. For example, ethene (C2H4) has a double bond between the carbons.

For this molecule, carbon sp2 hybridises, because one π (pi) bond is required for the double bond between the carbons and only three σ bonds are formed per carbon atom. In sp2 hybridisation the 2s orbital is mixed with only two of the three available 2p orbitals, usually denoted 2px and 2py. The third 2p orbital (2pz) remains unhybridised.

forming a total of three sp2 orbitals with one remaining p orbital. In ethene, the two carbon atoms form a σ bond by overlapping one sp2 orbital from each carbon atom. The π bond between the carbon atoms perpendicular to the molecular plane is formed by 2p–2p overlap. Each carbon atom forms covalent C–H bonds with two hydrogens by s–sp2 overlap, all with 120° bond angles. The hydrogen–carbon bonds are all of equal strength and length, in agreement with experimental data.

=== sp ===
The chemical bonding in compounds such as alkynes with triple bonds is explained by sp hybridization. In this model, the 2s orbital is mixed with only one of the three p orbitals,

resulting in two sp orbitals and two remaining p orbitals. The chemical bonding in acetylene (ethyne) (C2H2) consists of sp–sp overlap between the two carbon atoms forming a σ bond and two additional π bonds formed by p–p overlap. Each carbon also bonds to hydrogen in a σ s–sp overlap at 180° angles.

== Hybridisation and molecule shape ==
Hybridisation helps to explain molecule shape, since the angles between bonds are approximately equal to the angles between hybrid orbitals. This is in contrast to valence shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory, which can be used to predict molecular geometry based on empirical rules rather than on valence-bond or orbital theories.

=== spx hybridisation ===
As the valence orbitals of main group elements are the one s and three p orbitals with the corresponding octet rule, spx hybridization is used to model the shape of these molecules.
=== spxdy hybridisation ===
As the valence orbitals of transition metals are the five d, one s and three p orbitals with the corresponding 18-electron rule, spxdy hybridisation is used to model the shape of these molecules. These molecules tend to have multiple shapes corresponding to the same hybridization due to the different d-orbitals involved. A square planar complex has one unoccupied p-orbital and hence has 16 valence electrons.

=== sdx hybridisation ===
In certain transition metal complexes with a low d electron count, the p-orbitals are unoccupied and sdx hybridisation is used to model the shape of these molecules.

== Hybridisation of hypervalent molecules ==
=== Octet expansion ===
In some general chemistry textbooks, hybridization is presented for main group coordination number 5 and above using an &quot;expanded octet&quot; scheme with d-orbitals first proposed by Pauling. However, such a scheme is now considered to be incorrect in light of computational chemistry calculations.

In 1990, Eric Alfred Magnusson of the University of New South Wales published a paper definitively excluding the role of d-orbital hybridisation in bonding in hypervalent compounds of second-row (period 3) elements, ending a point of contention and confusion. Part of the confusion originates from the fact that d-functions are essential in the basis sets used to describe these compounds (or else unreasonably high energies and distorted geometries result). Also, the contribution of the d-function to the molecular wavefunction is large. These facts were incorrectly interpreted to mean that d-orbitals must be involved in bonding.

=== Resonance ===
In light of computational chemistry, a better treatment would be to invoke sigma bond resonance in addition to hybridisation, which implies that each resonance structure has its own hybridisation scheme. All resonance structures must obey the octet rule.

== Hybridisation in computational VB theory ==

While the simple model of orbital hybridisation is commonly used to explain molecular shape, hybridisation is used differently when computed in modern valence bond programs. Specifically, hybridisation is not determined &quot;a priori&quot; but is instead variationally optimized to find the lowest energy solution and then reported. This means that all artificial constraints, specifically two constraints, on orbital hybridisation are lifted:
* that hybridisation is restricted to integer values (isovalent hybridisation)
* that hybrid orbitals are orthogonal to one another (hybridisation defects)
This means that in practice, hybrid orbitals do not conform to the simple ideas commonly taught and thus in scientific computational papers are simply referred to as spx, spxdy or sdx hybrids to express their nature instead of more specific integer values.

=== Isovalent hybridisation ===

Although ideal hybrid orbitals can be useful, in reality, most bonds require orbitals of intermediate character. This requires an extension to include flexible weightings of atomic orbitals of each type (s, p, d) and allows for a quantitative depiction of the bond formation when the molecular geometry deviates from ideal bond angles. The amount of p-character is not restricted to integer values; i.e., hybridizations like sp2.5 are also readily described.

The hybridization of bond orbitals is determined by Bent&#x27;s rule: &quot;Atomic s character concentrates in orbitals directed towards electropositive substituents&quot;.

For molecules with lone pairs, the bonding orbitals are isovalent spx hybrids. For example, the two bond-forming hybrid orbitals of oxygen in water can be described as sp4.0 to give the interorbital angle of 104.5°. This means that they have 20% s character and 80% p character and does &quot;not&quot; imply that a hybrid orbital is formed from one s and four p orbitals on oxygen since the 2p subshell of oxygen only contains three p orbitals.

=== Hybridisation defects ===
Hybridisation of s and p orbitals to form effective spx hybrids requires that they have comparable radial extent. While 2p orbitals are on average less than 10% larger than 2s, in part attributable to the lack of a radial node in 2p orbitals, 3p orbitals which have one radial node, exceed the 3s orbitals by 20–33%. The difference in extent of s and p orbitals increases further down a group. The hybridisation of atoms in chemical bonds can be analysed by considering localised molecular orbitals, for example using natural localised molecular orbitals in a natural bond orbital (NBO) scheme. In methane, CH4, the calculated p/s ratio is approximately 3 consistent with &quot;ideal&quot; sp3 hybridisation, whereas for silane, SiH4, the p/s ratio is closer to 2. A similar trend is seen for the other 2p elements. Substitution of fluorine for hydrogen further decreases the p/s ratio. The 2p elements exhibit near ideal hybridisation with orthogonal hybrid orbitals. For heavier p block elements this assumption of orthogonality cannot be justified. These deviations from the ideal hybridisation were termed hybridisation defects by Kutzelnigg.

However, computational VB groups such as Gerratt, Cooper and Raimondi (SCVB) as well as Shaik and Hiberty (VBSCF) go a step further to argue that even for model molecules such as methane, ethylene and acetylene, the hybrid orbitals are already defective and nonorthogonal, with hybridisations such as sp1.76 instead of sp3 for methane.

== Photoelectron spectra ==
One misconception concerning orbital hybridization is that it incorrectly predicts the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra of many molecules. While this is true if Koopmans&#x27; theorem is applied to localized hybrids, quantum mechanics requires that the (in this case ionized) wavefunction obey the symmetry of the molecule which implies resonance in valence bond theory. For example, in methane, the ionised states (CH4+) can be constructed out of four resonance structures attributing the ejected electron to each of the four sp3 orbitals. A linear combination of these four structures, conserving the number of structures, leads to a triply degenerate T2 state and an A1 state. The difference in energy between each ionized state and the ground state would be ionization energy, which yields two values in agreement with experimental results.

== Localized vs canonical molecular orbitals ==

Bonding orbitals formed from hybrid atomic orbitals may be considered as localized molecular orbitals, which can be formed from the delocalized orbitals of molecular orbital theory by an appropriate mathematical transformation. For molecules in the ground state, this transformation of the orbitals leaves the total many-electron wave function unchanged. The hybrid orbital description of the ground state is, therefore &quot;equivalent&quot; to the delocalized orbital description for ground state total energy and electron density, as well as the molecular geometry that corresponds to the minimum total energy value.

=== Two localized representations ===
Molecules with multiple bonds or multiple lone pairs can have orbitals represented in terms of sigma and pi symmetry or equivalent orbitals. Different valence bond methods use either of the two representations, which have mathematically equivalent total many-electron wave functions and are related by a unitary transformation of the set of occupied molecular orbitals.

For multiple bonds, the sigma-pi representation is the predominant one compared to the equivalent orbital (bent bond) representation. In contrast, for multiple lone pairs, most textbooks use the equivalent orbital representation. However, the sigma-pi representation is also used, such as by Weinhold and Landis within the context of natural bond orbitals, a localized orbital theory containing modernized analogs of classical (valence bond/Lewis structure) bonding pairs and lone pairs. For the hydrogen fluoride molecule, for example, two F lone pairs are essentially unhybridized p orbitals, while the other is an sp&quot;x&quot; hybrid orbital. An analogous consideration applies to water (one O lone pair is in a pure p orbital, another is in an sp&quot;x&quot; hybrid orbital).

<text>Yvonne Fay Minton CBE (born 4 December 1938) is an Australian-born but mostly British-resident opera singer. She is variously billed as a soprano, mezzo-soprano or contralto.

A native of Sydney, she studied voice while on a scholarship at the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music. She won the £1000 Shell Aria, run in conjunction with the 1960 National Eisteddfod, Canberra. By this stage she had become one of the country&#x27;s leading contraltos, often appearing on radio and television and with the Sydney and Queensland orchestras.

Minton left Australia in 1961 to pursue her studies in London. The same year, she won the Kathleen Ferrier Prize for the best contralto at the International Vocal Competition &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands. Her first major part in England was as Maggie Dempster in the premiere of Nicholas Maw&#x27;s &quot;One Man Show&quot;. She sang the role of Clotilde on the 1965 Decca recording of Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot;.

Shortly thereafter, she became a regular member of the company of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, appearing in such roles as Lola in &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;. She created the role of Thea in Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Knot Garden&quot; (1970) and appeared at the Cologne Opera from 1969 (début as Sesto in &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;). She has since appeared with most of the major English orchestras and in opera houses throughout Europe and the United States. She has also appeared at Bayreuth (Brangäne in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;) and the Salzburg Festival 1978 (Octavian). In 1973, she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Octavian in Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;. She sang the role of Countess Geschwitz in &quot;Lulu&quot; in Paris in 1979. She has also made many concert appearances, notably with Sir Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

Her recordings include &quot;Parsifal&quot; (Armin Jordan), &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; (Georg Solti), &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (Colin Davis), Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor (Karl Münchinger), Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; (István Kertész), Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, Mahler&#x27;s &quot;The Song of the Earth&quot;, &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot;, &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; (all with Solti), &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; (Leonard Bernstein), and &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; (Daniel Barenboim).

In the New Year Honours 1980, she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to music.

<text>Per Fine Ounce is the title of an unpublished novel by Geoffrey Jenkins featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond. It was completed c.1966 and is considered a &quot;lost&quot; novel by fans of James Bond because it was actually commissioned by Glidrose Productions, the official publishers of James Bond. It was rejected for publication, however, missing the opportunity to become the first continuation James Bond novel. &quot;The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003½&quot;, a novel written by the pseudonymous R. D. Mascott, was later published in 1967 featuring James Bond&#x27;s nephew; &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; written by Kingsley Amis under the pseudonym Robert Markham was published in 1968 as the first adult continuation novel following Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1965).

==History==
Geoffrey Jenkins was given a job in the Foreign Department of Kemsley Newspapers, an organisation owned by the London &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, by Viscount Kemsley. There he worked with Ian Fleming, who was the Foreign Manager of the department, and the two men became friends. In a letter to John Pearson in 1965 when he was researching his biography on Ian Fleming, &quot;The Life of Ian Fleming&quot;, Jenkins revealed that in the late 1950s he had discussed the idea of a James Bond novel set in South Africa with Fleming, and even written a synopsis of it, which Fleming had very much liked. Fleming had said he would come to South Africa to research the book, but he died before this happened. Pearson was understandably excited by this revelation, and even more so when he found Jenkins&#x27; Bond synopsis in Fleming&#x27;s papers.

At the same time, Glidrose were considering the idea of asking other authors to continue writing James Bond novels, a notion that Fleming&#x27;s wife, Ann, was against, but his brother, Peter Fleming, who at the time was Glidrose&#x27;s director, favoured. In November 1965, Jenkins met with Harry Saltzman, co-producer of the James Bond films between 1962 and 1974, and Charles Tyrell from Glidrose to discuss the possibility of his making his South African synopsis into the first James Bond &quot;continuation&quot; novel. Negotiations were protracted, but Jenkins was formally granted permission to write the book on May 12, 1966; a contract was drawn up on August 24, 1966, which stated that Jenkins would be entitled to a percentage of profits in any film made from the novel, but not from any related merchandise that might come about.

Not much is known of the plot for &quot;Per Fine Ounce&quot;. The reference work &quot;The Bond Files&quot; by Andy Lane and Paul Simpson indicates that it was based upon a story Jenkins claimed he and Fleming had worked on around 1957, and that the storyline was set in South Africa and dealt with diamond smugglers and a spy ring and bore some resemblance to Fleming&#x27;s Bond novel &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; as well as his non-Bond work, &quot;The Diamond Smugglers&quot;. However, in an interview with &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; magazine published in 2005, Peter Janson-Smith, Fleming&#x27;s former literary agent and former chairman of Glidrose, claimed that he believed the story may have been about gold. This makes more sense, as the title derives from the line &quot;per fine Troy ounce&quot; or a variation of. A fine ounce is a Troy ounce of not quite pure gold. Jenkins&#x27; synopsis found by John Pearson in Fleming&#x27;s papers featured gold bicycle chains, baobab tree coffins and the magical Lake Fundudzi—presumably, Jenkins used some or all of these elements in the book itself. Four draft pages of the manuscript were discovered in 2005, in which we learn that the Double-O Section has been closed down and James Bond defies M on a matter of principle, resigning from MI6 to pursue his mission in South Africa alone.

Despite such promising-sounding material, and the fact that Jenkins was a best-selling thriller writer in the Fleming mould, had been a friend and colleague of Fleming&#x27;s and had apparently had his blessing and input for the project, Glidrose rejected Jenkins&#x27; submitted manuscript. Peter Janson-Smith later recalled that he thought it was badly written, although he admitted that Glidrose may have been &quot;stricter in those days.&quot;

A copy of the manuscript is rumoured to exist in the archives of Ian Fleming Publications (renamed from Glidrose in 1998); however, Peter Janson-Smith has said that he doesn&#x27;t believe Ian Fleming Publications still holds a copy and that the most likely scenario is that the manuscript was returned for legal reasons (so as to not be sued in the future for plagiarism if a book with a similar plot is used). Jenkins&#x27; contract with Glidrose gave him a licence to reuse the material in the novel in the event of its rejection, with the proviso that he could not use any of Fleming&#x27;s characters. Jenkins may have done this: his 1973 novel &quot;A Cleft of Stars&quot;, while not containing any rogue British secret agents, is set in almost precisely the same area of South Africa, involves diamonds and gold, and has the hero temporarily hiding in a baobab tree.

In 2005, Titan Books published a reprint of a comic strip based upon &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;. The introduction states that in the mid-1970s Amis lobbied for Eon Productions (producers of the Bond film franchise) to produce a film based upon his book. Reportedly he was told that Saltzman had forbidden that any film be made based on &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; due to Glidrose refusing to publish &quot;Per Fine Ounce&quot; a decade earlier.

In 2010, previously unreleased extracts from the &quot;lost&quot; Jenkins manuscript &quot;Per Fine Ounce&quot; were released exclusively on James Bond website MI6. The extract reveals 007&#x27;s traditional briefing with &quot;M&quot;.

<doc id="1252997" wikidata="Q1452422" url="?curid=1252997" title="Dactylioceras">
<text>Dactylioceras was a widespread genus of ammonites from the Lower Jurassic period, approximately 180 million years ago (mya). and Like many other ammonites, the genus &quot;Dactylioceras&quot; is extremely important in biostratigraphy, being a key index fossil for identifying their region of the Jurassic. It had a nearly cosmopolitan distribution during the time it existed.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Dactylioceras&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;dactyl&quot;, meaning “finger”, and &quot;keras&quot;, meaning &quot;horn&quot; and refers to the shell&#x27;s branching ribs.

==Description==
&quot;Dactylioceras&quot; are generally small, averaging in diameter. They have a strong, ribbed shell. The ribs are slightly inclined forward, running over the outer edge, and either simple or forking at outer end. Though they eventually died out 180 mya, their style of ribbing was copied by numerous subsequent ammonite genera until the whole group became extinct 66 million years ago with the dinosaurs.

==Ecology==
&quot;Dactylioceras&quot; probably lived by scavenging on the sea floor. Mass mortality specimens of &quot;Dactylioceras&quot; are common, and perhaps suggest that these ammonites may often have died shortly after spawning. The dead shells were probably gently washed up into a shell bank on the margins of the Lower Jurassic seas. Flow tank experiments show that &quot;Dactylioceras&quot; was probably a slow swimmer. It was likely prey for larger marine animals at the time including several belemnites.

==Distribution==
&quot;Dactylioceras&quot; has been collected from almost every continent, and was one of the most successful ammonite lineages ever. They are abundant throughout Europe, with exceptionally fine specimens found in England and Germany. 

==Subgenera==
Currently, 3 or 4 subgenera are considered to be valid. Number differs on authors opinions.
* &quot;D. (Dactylioceras)&quot; : type species: &quot;Ammonites communis&quot; 
* &quot;D. (Orthodactylites)&quot; : type species: &quot;Dactylioceras directus&quot; 
* &quot;D. (Iranodactylites)&quot; : type species: &quot;Dactylioceras (Iranodactylites) ketevanae&quot; 
* &quot;D. (Eodactylites)&quot; : type species: &quot;Dactylioceras pseudocommune&quot; . This subgenus is not recognized by some authors, while some other prefer to maintain it.

<doc id="1253011" wikidata="Q319741" url="?curid=1253011" title="Dimitri Mitropoulos">
<text>Dimitri Mitropoulos (; – 2 November 1960) was a Greek and American conductor, pianist, and composer.

== Life and career ==

Mitropoulos was born in Athens, the son of Yannis and Angelikē (Angeliki) Mitropoulos. His father owned a leather goods shop in downtown Athens. He was musically precocious, demonstrating his abilities at an early age. From the ages of eleven to fourteen, when Mitropoulos was in secondary school, he would host and preside over informal musical gatherings at his house every Saturday afternoon. His earliest acknowledged composition – a sonata for violin and piano, now lost – dates from this period. His opera Soeur Béatrice, based on the play by Maurice Maeterlinck, premiered in 1919.

He studied music at the Athens Conservatoire as well as in Brussels and Berlin, with Ferruccio Busoni among his teachers. In 1921 he conducted the inaugural music of the Bavarian Socialist Republic. From 1921 to 1925 he assisted Erich Kleiber at the Berlin State Opera and then took a number of posts in Greece. At a 1930 concert with the Berlin Philharmonic, finding that his soloist was sick, he played the solo part of Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 and conducted the orchestra from the keyboard, becoming one of the first to do so.

=== United States ===
Mitropoulos made his U.S. debut in 1936 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and he later settled in the country, becoming a citizen in 1946. From 1937 to 1949 he served as principal conductor of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (forerunner of today&#x27;s Minnesota Orchestra).

In 1949 Mitropoulos began his association with the New York Philharmonic. He was initially co-conductor with Leopold Stokowski and became the sole music director in 1951. Mitropoulos recorded extensively with the Philharmonic for Columbia Records and sought to reach new audiences in the city through appearances on television and by conducting performances at the Roxy Theatre, a popular movie theatre in 1950–51. He expanded the Philharmonic&#x27;s repertoire, commissioning works by new composers and championing the symphonies of Gustav Mahler. In 1955, Philharmonic&#x27;s performance under Mitropoulos at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus was the main event of the inaugural edition of Athens Festival. In 1958, he was succeeded as the Philharmonic&#x27;s conductor by a protégé, Leonard Bernstein. In January 1960, he guest conducted the Philharmonic in a performance of Mahler&#x27;s Fifth Symphony, which was recorded.

=== Work in opera ===
In addition to his orchestral career, Mitropoulos conducted opera extensively in Italy, and from 1954 until his death in 1960 was the principal conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in New York, although the Met never had an official &#x27;principal conductor&#x27; title until the 1970s. His musically incisive and dramatically vivid performances of Puccini, Verdi, Richard Strauss and others remain models of the opera conductor&#x27;s art. The Met&#x27;s extensive archive of recorded broadcasts preserves many of these fine performances.

Mitropoulos&#x27;s series of recordings for Columbia Records with the New York Philharmonic included a rare complete performance of Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot;. Many of these have been reissued by Sony Classics on CD, including most recently his stereo recordings of excerpts from Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. He recorded with the Minneapolis Symphony for RCA Victor during the 78-rpm era. He was also represented on the Cetra Records label, most notably with an early recording of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elektra&quot;.

Mitropoulos premiered many contemporary works. Examples include the American premieres of Shostakovich&#x27;s Tenth Symphony (1954) and First Violin Concerto (1956) and the world premieres of Barber&#x27;s &quot;Vanessa&quot; (1958), Ernst Krenek&#x27;s Fourth Symphony (1947), and John J. Becker&#x27;s &quot;Short Symphony&quot; (1950).

===Personal life===
Mitropoulos was noted for having an eidetic memory (which enabled him to conduct without a score, even during rehearsals) and for his monk-like life style due to his deeply religious, Greek Orthodox beliefs.

Mitropoulos was &quot;quietly known to be homosexual&quot; and &quot;felt no need for a cosmetic marriage&quot;. Among his relationships reportedly was one with a young Leonard Bernstein. Mitropoulos was a close friend and mentor to William Bast.

Mitropoulos died in Milan, Italy at the age of 64 of heart failure, while rehearsing Mahler&#x27;s Third Symphony at the La Scala Opera House. One of his last recorded performances was Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot; with Giuseppe Di Stefano, Antonietta Stella and Ettore Bastianini in Vienna on 23 September 1960. On 31 October 1960, two days before his death, Mitropoulos conducted Mahler&#x27;s Third Symphony with the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra. The performance was recorded and later issued commercially.

In 1971, Glover and jazz musician Putter Smith portrayed the assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, respectively, in the James Bond film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;.

Glover played a motorcycle gang leader known as Bach in the &quot;Adam-12&quot; episode &quot;Log 103: A Sound Like Thunder&quot; (1969).

<doc id="1253029" wikidata="Q2526292" url="?curid=1253029" title="Henry Flitcroft">
<text>Henry Flitcroft (30 August 1697 – 25 February 1769) was a major English architect in the second generation of Palladianism. He came from a simple background: his father was a labourer in the gardens at Hampton Court and he began as a joiner by trade. Working as a carpenter at Burlington House, he fell from a scaffold and broke his leg. While he was recuperating, the young Lord Burlington noticed his talent with the pencil, and by 1720 Flitcroft was Burlington&#x27;s draughtsman and general architectural assistant, surveying at Westminster School for Burlington&#x27;s dormitory, and superintending at the site at Tottenham House. Working life in the inner circle that was driving the new Palladian architecture was an education for Flitcroft.

Flitcroft redrew for publication the drawings for &quot;The Designs of Mr. Inigo Jones,&quot; published by William Kent in 1727, under Burlington&#x27;s patronage and supervision. In May 1726 Burlington got his protégé an appointment at the Office of Works, where he worked his way up from Master Carpenter and Master Mason to Comptroller of the King&#x27;s Works, a prestigious position at the top of the architectural field. Royal commissions came his way in the form of some private projects for junior members of the British Royal Family; namely the Duke of Cumberland. His work for the Duke at Windsor Great Park included creating the Virginia Water Lake.

Flitcroft&#x27;s hands were constantly occupied with private commissions and, like most professional architects (and unlike virtuoso earls), he did some speculative construction in new-building London streets, supplied stone, and contracted to erect the buildings he was designing.

Panelling and a mantelpiece from an old panelled room designed by Flitcroft in the 1720s from Potternewton Hall near Leeds were installed in Sutton Park in Yorkshire after 1935.

From 1746 to 1756, he was Surveyor of the Fabric of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

In 1724 Flitcroft married Sarah Minns at St Benet&#x27;s, Paul&#x27;s Wharf. His son Henry was born in Hampton (1742). Flitcroft is buried at St Mary with St Alban, Teddington, together with his son Henry (died 1826), and wife Jane (died 1778). The inscription on his tomb records that &quot;Here lies the body of HENRY FLITCROFT of Whitehall in the county of Middlesex who had the honour of serving three first Princes of the House of Brunswick in the Board of Works of which he was successively Appointed Clerk, Master Mason &amp; Controller in the last of which Office he continued till his death which happened on the 25th of February 1769.&quot; Inside the church on the west wall is a memorial to Henry Flitcroft.

Flitcroft Street, near St Giles in the Fields, London, was named after Henry Flitcroft.

<text>Friedrich Ratzel (August 30, 1844 – August 9, 1904) was a German geographer and ethnographer, notable for first using the term &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (&quot;living space&quot;) in the sense that the National Socialists later would.

==Life==
Ratzel&#x27;s father was the head of the household staff of the Grand Duke of Baden. Friedrich attended high school in Karlsruhe for six years before being apprenticed at age 15 to apothecaries. In 1863, he went to Rapperswil on the Lake of Zurich, Switzerland, where he began to study the classics. After a further year as an apothecary at Moers near Krefeld in the Lower Rhine region (1865–1866), he spent a short time at the high school in Karlsruhe and became a student of zoology at the universities of Heidelberg, Jena and Berlin, finishing in 1868. He studied zoology in 1869, publishing &quot;Sein und Werden der organischen Welt&quot; on Darwin.

After the completion of his schooling Ratzel began a period of travels that saw him transform from zoologist/biologist to geographer. He began field work in the Mediterranean, writing letters of his experiences. These letters led to a job as a traveling reporter for the &quot;Kölnische Zeitung&quot; (&quot;Cologne Journal&quot;), which provided him the means for further travel. Ratzel embarked on several expeditions, the lengthiest and most important being his 1874-1875 trip to North America, Cuba, and Mexico. This trip was a turning point in Ratzel&#x27;s career. He studied the influence of people of German origin in America, especially in the Midwest, as well as other ethnic groups in North America.

He produced a written account of his travels in 1876, &quot;Städte-und Kulturbilder aus Nordamerika&quot; (Profile of Cities and Cultures in North America), which would help establish the field of cultural geography. According to Ratzel, cities are the best place to study people because life is &quot;blended, compressed, and accelerated&quot; in cities, and they bring out the &quot;greatest, best, most typical aspects of people&quot;. Ratzel had traveled to cities such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Richmond, Charleston, New Orleans, and San Francisco.

Upon his return in 1875, Ratzel became a lecturer in geography at the Technical High School in Munich. In 1876, he was promoted to assistant professor, then rose to full professor in 1880. While at Munich, Ratzel produced several books and established his career as an academic. In 1886, he accepted an appointment at Leipzig University. His lectures were widely attended, notably by the influential American geographer Ellen Churchill Semple as well as Martha Krug-Genthe, the first woman to obtain a doctorate in geography.

Ratzel produced the foundations of human geography in his two-volume &quot;Anthropogeographie&quot; in 1882 and 1891. This work was misinterpreted by many of his students, creating a number of environmental determinists. He published his work on political geography, &quot;Politische Geographie&quot;, in 1897. It was in this work that Ratzel introduced concepts that contributed to Lebensraum and Social Darwinism. His three volume work &quot;The History of Mankind&quot; was published in English in 1896 and contained over 1100 excellent engravings and remarkable chromolithography.

Ratzel continued his work at Leipzig until his sudden death on August 9, 1904, in Ammerland, Lake Starnberg, Germany.
Ratzel, a scholar of versatile academic interest, was a staunch German. During the outbreak of Franco-Prussian war in 1870, he joined the Prussian army and was wounded twice during the war.

==Writings==
Influenced by thinkers including Darwin and zoologist Ernst Heinrich Haeckel, he published several papers. Among them is the essay &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (1901) concerning biogeography, creating a foundation for the uniquely German variant of geopolitics: &quot;Geopolitik&quot;.

Ratzel&#x27;s writings coincided with the growth of German industrialism after the Franco-Prussian war and the subsequent search for markets that brought it into competition with Britain. His writings served as welcome justification for imperial expansion. Influenced by the American geostrategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach, agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining, as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine, unlike land power.

Ratzel&#x27;s idea of &quot;Raum&quot; (space) would grow out of his organic state conception. His early concept of &quot;lebensraum&quot; was not political or economic but spiritual and racial nationalist expansion. The &quot;Raum-motiv&quot; is a historically-driving force, pushing peoples with great &quot;Kultur&quot; to naturally expand. Space, for Ratzel, was a vague concept, theoretically unbounded. &quot;Raum&quot; was defined as where German peoples live, and other weaker states could serve to support German peoples economically, and German culture could fertilize other cultures. However, it ought to be noted that Ratzel&#x27;s concept of &quot;raum&quot; was not overtly aggressive, but he theorized simply as the natural expansion of strong states into areas controlled by weaker states.

The book for which Ratzel is acknowledged all over the world is &quot;Anthropogeographie&quot;. It was completed between 1872 and 1899. The main focus of this monumental work is on the effects of different physical features and locations on the style and life of the people.

==Quotations==

* &quot;Der Grenzraum ist das Wirkliche, die Grenzlinie ist das Abstraktion davon&quot; (The borderlands are the reality, the boundary line is an abstraction thereof). (Ratzel, 1895)
*&quot;A philosophy of the history of the human race, worthy of its name, must begin with the heavens and descend to the earth, must be charged with the conviction that all existence is one—a single conception sustained from beginning to end upon one identical law.&quot;
* &quot;Culture grows in places that can adequately support dense labor populations.&quot;

==Selected bibliography==
Here are his other notable writings:
* &quot;Wandertage eines Naturforschers&quot; (Days of wandering of a student of nature, 1873–74)
* &quot;Vorgeschichte des europäischen Menschen&quot; (Prehistory of Europeans, 1875)
* &quot;Die Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika&quot; (The United States of North America, 1878–80)
* &quot;Die Erde, in 24 Vorträgen&quot; (The Earth in 24 lectures, 1881)
* &quot;Völkerkunde&quot; (Ethnology, 1885,1886,1888)

<doc id="1253037" wikidata="Q5152616" url="?curid=1253037" title="Commissary">
<text>A commissary is a government official charged with oversight or an ecclesiastical official who exercises in special circumstances the jurisdiction of a bishop.

In many countries, the term is used as an administrative or police title. It often corresponds to the command of a police station, which is then known as a &quot;commissariat&quot;. In some armed forces, commissaries are officials charged with overseeing the purchase and delivery of supplies, and they have powers of administrative and financial oversight. Then, the &quot;commissariat&quot; is the organization associated with the corps of commissaries. By extension, the term &quot;commissary&quot; came to be used for the building where supplies were disbursed.

In some countries, both roles are used; for example, France uses &quot;police commissaries&quot; (&quot;commissaires de police&quot;) in the French National Police and &quot;armed forces commissaries&quot; (&quot;commissaires des armées&quot;) in the French armed forces.

The equivalent terms are &quot;commissaire&quot; in French, &quot;commissario&quot; in Italian, &quot;Kommissar&quot; in Standard German, &quot;Kommissär&quot; in Swiss German and Luxembourgish, &quot;comisario&quot; in Spanish, &quot;commissaris&quot; in Dutch and Flemish, &quot;komisario&quot; in Finnish, &quot;komisarz&quot; in Polish and &quot;comissário&quot; in Portuguese. In many instances these words may also be the equivalent to commissioner, depending on the context.

==Etymology==
The word is recorded in English since 1362, for &quot;one to whom special duty is entrusted by a higher power&quot;. This Anglo-French word derives from Medieval Latin &quot;commissarius&quot;, from Latin &quot;commissus&quot; (pp. of committere) &quot;entrusted&quot;.

==Examples==
===Government and administration===
Governmental or administrative structures (or bodies) headed by a commissary (or composed of several commissaries) are often referred to as &quot;commissary governments&quot; or &quot;commissary administrations&quot;. Such terms were often used during the colonial era, and it was also used to designate various &quot;provisional&quot; governments of administrations. Executive or administrative body composed of several commissaries is often called &quot;Council of Commissaries&quot; or &quot;Board of Commissaries&quot;. Deputy of a commissary is styled as &quot;vice-commissary&quot; or &quot;sub-commissary&quot;.

In the Soviet Union, commissaries&#x27; powers of oversight were used for political purposes. These commissaries are often known as commissars in English.

===Police===
A Spanish police Commissary is considered to be equal in rank to a commandant in the Spanish army.

In the French National Police, a &quot;commissaire&quot; is assigned to a commune with a population of more than 30,000. Larger communes have more than one. Paris has well over one hundred commissaires. All &quot;commissaires&quot; are graduates and can fulfill both administrative and investigative roles.

In the Romanian Police, similarly to the French National Police, the rank of &quot;comisar&quot; is equivalent to the British police rank of superintendent (&quot;see also Romanian police ranks&quot;).

===Military===
====British army====
With the establishment of an English standing army following the Restoration of the Monarchy a Commissary General of Musters was appointed on 20 December 1660. This officer, with the assistance of four deputies, was responsible for mustering troops by regiment and checking their names against the muster roll. These musters took place six or seven times per year (and monthly from 1687). At a muster the total number of officers and men was checked against the roll, each soldier&#x27;s arms and accoutrements were inspected and each officer&#x27;s rank (and record of leave) was checked against their level of pay. Only after the Commissary General had certified the muster roll would the Paymaster General of the forces issue pay to the regiment. In 1798 the commanding officer of each regiment, together with its regimental Paymaster, took over responsibility for the musters and the Deputy Commissaries were dismissed. The Commissary General continued to oversee a central office of musters until 1817 when the post was abolished and its duties transferred to the Secretary at War.

The appointment of a Commissary General of Provisions was first made by James II in 1685 to provide for his troops encamped on Hounslow Heath. As a permanent post the appointment had lapsed by 1694, but a century later it was revived for senior officer of the Commissariat (a department of HM Treasury responsible for the procurement and issue of various stores and victuals to the army and the provision of transport). The Commissariat officers were uniformed civilians, appointed by the Treasury but issued with letters of commission by the War Office; they were given rank as follows:
* Commissary General (equivalent to a Brigadier General)
* Deputy Commissary General (equivalent to a Lieutenant Colonel or Major)
* Assistant Commissary General (equivalent to a Captain)
* Deputy Assistant Commissary General (equivalent to a Lieutenant)
* Commissary Clerk (equivalent to an Ensign).
The department was overseen by a &quot;Commissary-in-Chief&quot; from 1809 to 1816, and by a &quot;Commissary General in Chief&quot; from 1858 to 1869.

Between 1793 and 1859 &quot;Assistant Commissary&quot;, &quot;Commissary&quot; and (from 1810) &quot;Chief Commissary&quot; were (civilian) ranks in the Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance (the field force element of the Ordnance storekeeping system).

After 1869 &quot;Commissary&quot; and associated titles were used as junior officer ranks by the Control Department (military successor to both the Commissariat and the Ordnance Field Train). A split in 1875 created the Commissariat and Transport Department and the Ordnance Store Department, which used (respectively) &quot;Commissary-General&quot; and &quot;Commissary-General of Ordnance&quot; for their senior officers (along with other Commissary ranks down the chain of command). After 1880 officers of the new Army Service Corps were given full military rank, but the Army Ordnance Department retained &quot;Commissary of Ordnance&quot; (and &quot;Deputy&quot; and &quot;Assistant Commissary of Ordnance&quot;) as its junior officer ranks throughout the First World War.

===Ecclesiastical===
====Anglican Communion====
The Canons of the Church of England, referring to the metropolitical jurisdiction of archbishops and to the ordinary jurisdiction of diocesan bishops, states that: &quot;Such jurisdiction is exercised by the (arch)bishop himself, or by a Vicar-General, official, or other commissary to whom authority in that behalf shall have been formally committed by the (arch)bishop concerned.&quot;.

In previous centuries Bishops sometimes appointed representatives, called commissaries, to perform functions in distant portions of their dioceses. In 1684 Henry Compton, the Bishop of London, resolved to use the commissary system to provide leadership for churches in the American colonies. (James Blair was an early such commissary). Commissaries were appointed to some, but not all, of the thirteen colonies into the second half of the eighteenth century. Later, commissaries were sometimes appointed for other parts of the British Empire.

In 2011 the Archbishop of Canterbury appointed commissaries to conduct a visitation upon the Diocese of Chichester with regard to safeguarding failures in the diocese over many years. According to their interim report: &quot;Our appointment by the Archbishop of Canterbury - the first such appointment of Commissaries for over 100 years - is evidence of the deep concern held in the Church of England for this diocese and its failure properly to protect children in its care&quot;.

In current practice in the Church of England, the relevant archbishop appoints an &quot;episcopal commissary&quot; during a diocesan vacancy in see; that bishop (usually the senior suffragan in the diocese) is commonly called Acting Bishop of the diocese (e.g. Acting Bishop of Birmingham).

<doc id="1253039" wikidata="Q1377438" url="?curid=1253039" title="National Iraqi Alliance">
<text>The National Iraqi Alliance (NIA or INA; ), also known as the Watani List, was an Iraqi electoral coalition that contested the 2010 Iraqi legislative election. The Alliance was mainly composed of Shi&#x27;a Islamist parties. The alliance was created by the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (the at the time largest Shi&#x27;a party) to contest in the January 2005 and December 2005 under the name United Iraqi Alliance (UIA; ), when it included all Iraq&#x27;s major Shi&#x27;a parties. The United Iraqi Alliance won both those of elections however later fell apart after several major parties (most notably the Sadr Movement) left the alliance due to disputes with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and the Supreme Council.

The component parties contested the 2009 provincial elections separately but later that year started negotiations to revive the list. In August 2009, they announced the creation of the National Iraqi Alliance for the 2010 parliamentary election, this time without Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki&#x27;s Islamic Dawa Party, which formed the State of Law Coalition. Later that year the two lists would re-unite again, forming the National Alliance.

==January 2005 Parliamentary Election==
The Alliance formed in the lead-up to the January 2005 elections from mainly Shi’ite groups most importantly the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, whose leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim headed the list, and Islamic Dawa Party. Other important members included the secular Iraqi National Congress led by Ahmed Chalabi and the independent nuclear physicist Hussain Shahristani. It also included supporters of cleric Muqtada al-Sadr who preferred not to back his National Independent Cadres and Elites party, and a number of independent Sunni representatives. The coalition was widely believed to have been supported by senior Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most widely respected religious figure in Iraq. Although Sistani offered no official endorsement, many in Iraq understood the UIA to be the &quot;Sistani list.&quot;

The 22 parties included in the coalition, which was called List 228, were:
# Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI)
# Badr Organisation
# Islamic Dawa Party (al-Dawa)
# Islamic Dawa Party—Iraq Organisation
# Islamic Virtue Party
# Hezbollah Movement in Iraq
# Hezbollah al-Iraq
# Islamic Action Organisation
# Sayyid Al-Shuhadaa Organisation
# Shaheed Al-Mihrab Organisation
# Iraqi National Congress (INC)
# Centrist Assembly Party
# Islamic Fayli Grouping in Iraq
# Fayli Kurd Islamic Union
# First Democratic National Party
# Assembly “Future of Iraq”
# Justice and Equality Grouping
# Islamic Master of the Martyrs Movement
# Islamic Union for Iraqi Turkomans
# Turkmen Fidelity Movement

Many members of the Alliance had lived in exile in Iran, including Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Iraq&#x27;s Prime Minister from 2005 to 2006, who led the Islamic Dawa Party. In 1980, thousands of al-Dawa supporters were imprisoned or executed after advocating replacing Saddam Hussein&#x27;s secular Ba&#x27;ath Party government with an Islamic government. The Iranian government supported their efforts and allowed members of Al-Da’wa to seek exile in Iran.

The Alliance received 4.08 million votes (48.1%) in the election, which gave the bloc 140 seats on the 275-seat Council of Representatives of Iraq. The Alliance&#x27;s nominees included 42 women. The Alliance formed a coalition Iraqi Transitional Government with the Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan. Ibrahim al-Jaafari, leader of the Islamic Dawa Party, became the Prime Minister of Iraq and Jalal Talabani of the Kurdistani Alliance became the President of Iraq.

In March 2005, the Iraqi Turkmen Front agreed to join the UIA’s caucus in the National Assembly. In return, Sistani reportedly pledged support for the recognition of Iraqi Turkmen as a national minority.

==December 2005 Parliamentary Election==
The Iraqi National Congress left the alliance prior to the December 2005 elections, which also brought the Sadrist Movement more firmly into the Alliance. Al-Sistani also stated that he would not support any party in this election.

The election saw an increased turnout, mainly because the Sunni Arab population decided not to boycott. The alliance won 5.0 million votes (41.2%) an increase of 23% in the number of votes but a reduction of 6.9% in the vote share. They gained 128 seats, 12 fewer than the previous election.

Analysis of the seat allocation after the elections showed that the 109 district seats and 19 compensatory seats won by the UIA were split as follows:

Other parties include:

*Centrist Coalition Party
*Turkman Islamic Union of Iraq
*Justice and Equality Assembly
*Iraqi Democratic Movement
*Movement of Hizbullah in Iraq
*Turkmen Loyalty Movement
*Saed Al Shuhada Islamic Movement
*Al Shabak Democratic Gathering
*Malhan Al Mkoter
*Reform And Building Meeting
*The Justice Community
*Iraq Ahrar

Following the election, the Islamic Virtue Party withdrew from the Alliance, saying they wanted to &quot;&quot;prevent blocs forming on a sectarian basis&quot;. This followed differences with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki over control of the Oil Ministry in the Government of Iraq from 2006. This was followed in September 2007 by the Sadrist Movement, who complained the Alliance was &quot;dominated by some parties&quot;&quot;.

The Alliance formed a coalition with the Kurdistani Alliance, the Sunni Arab-majority Iraqi Accord Front and the secularist Iraqi National List. The Alliance nominated Jaafari for another term as prime minister, but his appointment was blocked by the Alliance&#x27;s coalition partners. Nouri al-Maliki, a deputy leader of the Islamic Dawa Party was agreed instead.

==National Iraqi Alliance: 2010 Parliamentary Election==
The component parties of the United Iraqi Alliance contested the 2009 provincial elections separately and in August 2009, they announced a new coalition for the 2010 parliamentary election without Prime Minister Maliki&#x27;s Islamic Dawa Party. The new alliance was called the National Iraqi Alliance. The chairman of the group is former Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari.

The parties taking part in the National Iraqi Alliance for the 2010 elections include:

*Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council (ISCI) - led by Ammar al-Hakim
**Badr Organisation - led by Hadi al-Amiri
**Hezbollah Movement in Iraq - led by Hassan al-Sari
**Sayyid al-Shuhada - led by Daghir al-Musawi
*Sadr Movement - led by Muqtada al-Sadr
*National Reform Trend (Islah) - led by Ibrahim al-Jaafari
*Islamic Virtue Party (Fadhilah) led by Abd al-Rahim al-Hasini
*Islamic Dawa Party - Tanzim al-Dakhli - led by Abdul Karim al-Anizi
*Iraqi National Congress (INC) - led by Ahmad Challabi
*Anbar Salvation Council - led by Hamid Hayes
*Solidarity Bloc (Tadamun) - led by Qassim Daoud
*Gathering of Justice and Unity - led by Sheikh al-Faiz
*Turkmeneli Political Party
*Shiite Turkmen Movement
*Constitutional Monarchy Movement - led by Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein
*The party belonging to the Bahr al-Ulloum family - led by Mohammad Bahr al-Ulloum
*The party led by Khalid Abd al-Wahhab al-Mulla
*Several Independent politicians.

===Results===


Among the five seats not belonging to the INA&#x27;s 4 major parties, 1 seat went to ISCI affiliated Hezbollah in Iraq, 1 seat went to the Iraqi National Accord (Ahmad Challabi&#x27;s seat) and 1 went to the Basra-based Shaykhi party: Gathering of Justice and Unity.

<text>Lexell is a lunar impact crater that lies across the southeastern rim of the huge walled plain Deslandres, in the southern part of the Moon. It was named after Swedish-Russian mathematician and astronomer Anders Johan Lexell. To the northeast is the walled plain Walther, and to the south is Orontius, another walled plain.

This is a somewhat irregular formation with a wide break in the northern rim. The western rim forms a low, arcing wall, and is overlain to the southwest by Lexell H after passing the rim of Deslandres. The rim peaks along the southeast, then comes to an end at a rugged promontory-like ridge. The interior floor has been resurfaced by lava to the northwest and in sections of the remainder of the floor. There are some low rises and ghost-crater rims in the southeast half part of the interior floor.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lexell.

<doc id="1253052" wikidata="Q1349827" url="?curid=1253052" title="Kokomo Arnold">
<text>James &quot;Kokomo&quot; Arnold (February 15, 1896 or 1901 – November 8, 1968) was an American blues musician. A left-handed slide guitarist, his intense style of playing and rapid-fire vocal delivery set him apart from his contemporaries. He got his nickname in 1934 after releasing &quot;Old Original Kokomo Blues&quot; for Decca Records, a cover version of Scrapper Blackwell&#x27;s blues song about the city of Kokomo, Indiana.

==Early life==
Arnold was born in Lovejoy&#x27;s Station, Georgia. Most sources give the date his birth as 1901, but the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc give the date as 1896, on the basis of information in the 1900 census. He learned the basics of playing the guitar from his cousin, John Wiggs.

==Career==
Arnold began playing in the early 1920s as a sideline, when he was working as a farmhand in Buffalo, New York, and as a steelworker in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1929 he moved to Chicago and ran a bootlegging business, an activity he continued until the end of Prohibition. In 1930 he moved south briefly and made his first recordings, &quot;Rainy Night Blues&quot; and &quot;Paddlin&#x27; Madeline Blues&quot;, under the name Gitfiddle Jim, for the Victor label in Memphis. He soon moved back to Chicago, where he was forced to make a living as a musician after Prohibition ended in 1933. Kansas Joe McCoy heard him and introduced him to Mayo Williams, a producer for Decca Records.

From his first recording for Decca, on September 10, 1934, until his last, on May 12, 1938, Arnold made 88 sides, seven of which have been lost.

Arnold, Peetie Wheatstraw and Bumble Bee Slim were well-known musicians in Chicago blues circles at that time. Wheatstraw and Arnold, in particular, were also major influences on their contemporary, the Delta blues artist Robert Johnson. Johnson turned &quot;Old Original Kokomo Blues&quot; into &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot; and &quot;Milk Cow Blues&quot; into &quot;Milkcow&#x27;s Calf Blues&quot;. Another Arnold song, &quot;Sagefield Woman Blues&quot;, introduced the phrase &quot;dust my broom&quot;, which Johnson used as a song title.

Other notable songs include his 1934 recording of &quot;Sissy Man Blues&quot;, with lyrics referring to bisexuality (&quot;Lord, if you can&#x27;t send me no woman, please send me some sissy man&quot;). It was later recorded by other blues musicians of the era, including Josh White (as &quot;Pinewood Tom&quot;), George Noble and Connie McLean&#x27;s Rhythm Boys.

In 1938 Arnold left the music industry and began to work in a Chicago factory. Located by blues researchers in 1962, he showed no interest in returning to music to take advantage of the resurgence of interest in the blues among young white audiences. His song &quot;Milk Cow Blues&quot; was recorded by Cliff Bruner&#x27;s Texas Wanderers (1937), Johnnie Lee Wills (brother of Bob Wills) (1941), Elvis Presley (1954), Ricky Nelson (1960), The Kinks (1965), Aerosmith (1977), and Willie Nelson (2000).

==Death==
Arnold died of a heart attack in Chicago on November 8, 1968, aged either 67 or 72, and was buried in Burr Oak Cemetery, in Alsip, Illinois.

<text>Mercurius is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeastern part of the Moon. It was named by the IAU in 1935.

It lies to the northeast of the smaller crater Carrington, and west-northwest of Zeno. Just to the south is the small lunar mare named Lacus Spei, and to the west is the larger Lacus Temporis.

The rim of Mercurius is circular, with a somewhat irregular edge. There are small outward bulges along several sections of the rim, with the most notable bulges being along the eastern and southern sides. The inner wall has slumped around much of the perimeter, producing a sharp edge. The sides are also somewhat worn, with some tiny craterlets overlying the inner wall.

Within the rim the interior floor has been resurfaced by lava and is nearly level, with a slight hint of a central mound. The remainder of the floor is marked only by a few tiny craterlets and some low ridges in the northeastern corner.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Mercurius.

<text>Charles Joseph Carter (June 14, 1874 – February 13, 1936) was an American stage magician, also known as Carter the Great.

==Biography==
He was born on June 14, 1874, in New Castle, Pennsylvania, and developed an interest in magic from a young age. Carter&#x27;s first theatrical experience occurred at the Herzog&#x27;s museum and Pat Harris&#x27; Masonic Temple in Baltimore at the age of 10, where he appeared as &quot;Master Charles Carter the Original Boy Magician&quot;. Due to stiff competition from the number of magic acts on the American stages at the time, Carter opted to pursue his career abroad, where he gained fame.

Among the highlights of Carter&#x27;s stage performances during his career were the classic &quot;sawing a woman in half&quot; illusion (an elaborate surgical-themed version with &quot;nurses&quot; in attendance), making a live elephant disappear and &quot;cheating the gallows&quot;, where a shrouded Carter would vanish, just as he dropped at the end of a hangman&#x27;s noose. He was also known for devising acts that were inspired by recent events that captured the public&#x27;s imagination, such as the discovery of Tutankhamen&#x27;s tomb in 1922 or John Dillinger&#x27;s famous jailbreak in 1934.

In 1894 he met his future wife, Corrine, whom he married and included in his show. A year later, his son, Lawrence, who would eventually take over the act after his death, was born.

Around the beginning of the century, Carter decided to settle down in Chicago along with his wife and son, his first major break from touring. During this time he tried to get a series of different business ventures up and running, such as an entertainment agency called The National Theatrical Exchange and his trade magazine called &quot;The Chicago Footlights,&quot; with various levels of success. During this time, he also enrolled in law school, from which he graduated in 1905.

In 1907 he set off again on a world tour that took him and his family to Australia, New Zealand, India, China, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Italy and beyond for three years. He would continue to tour the world with only short respites in the United States until 1917, completing seven world tours in this time. Because of his elaborate live shows, he had to travel everywhere with a lot of equipment, which at one point reached the weight of 31 tons. According to some sources, it was this heavy equipment of his that lead to him being refused a place on the RMS Titanic during a return trip to the US in 1912.

Looking for a break from his world touring magic show, Carter purchased the famous Martinka Magic Palace in 1917. Despite plans of opening Martinka shops all over the country, Carter soon discovered that he was losing money in the magic shop business and sold the Martinka two years later to a group of investors that included Harry Houdini. A famous anecdote states that he kept his lion, Monty, in the back room of the shop and when it would roar, the startled customers would run for the door.

In 1920, The Great Carter was touring again, opening at the Criterion in Sydney, Australia in May, accompanied by stage psychic Miss Evelyn Maxwell. The pair then toured Australia before heading overseas again.

In 1921, he lost a fortune while filming &quot;The Lion’s Bride&quot; in South Africa, a movie starring himself, that he had also written, produced, directed. The film never made it to screen.

The Great Carter returned to touring, playing packed houses in Australia in 1924 and again in 1934 together with Miss Evelyn Maxwell.

In 1936, Charles Joseph Carter suffered a heart attack on his way to Bombay, India. He was sent to the hospital and his son Larry took over the show. He died on February 13, 1936, aged 61 following a second heart attack. He is buried in the Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York.

==Legacy==
Carter&#x27;s home in San Francisco was rented by the Sumitomo Bank of California in the 1980s–90s and used as a residence for the Bank&#x27;s President. Carter used to put on shows in the basement and people still discover occult references in the stained glass windows. The house is in the Seacliff District of San Francisco near the Pacific Ocean. It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as the &quot;Houdini Mansion&quot;. It is now used as a foreign consulate.

Following Charles Carter&#x27;s death from a heart attack in 1936, his son Larry Carter took over as Carter the Great.

A variety of vintage posters, advertising his shows, are on display at the House on the Rock in Wisconsin.

It is commonly believed that the character &#x27;Maxwell&#x27; from the video game &#x27;Don&#x27;t Starve&#x27; was inspired by Carter because of his connections to magic and his relation to the city of San Francisco, as well that his real name is &#x27;William Carter&#x27;.

A highly fictionalized account of his life can be found in &quot;Carter Beats the Devil&quot; () by Glen David Gold. The rights to the novel were purchased in 2002 by Paramount, with Tom Cruise planning to star and produce, but the film has since been stuck in development hell. Warner Bros. currently hold the rights to a Carter Beats the Devil film.

<text>Brian Selden (born 1980 in San Diego, California) was the winner of the 1998 &quot;&quot; .

His strategy in the tournament was to use two cards, called &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; and &quot;Recurring Nightmare&quot; repeatedly. The former card puts creatures into the , while the latter allows the user to return them to the battlefield without using any . This results in a constant cycle of resurrected creatures. Selden used this tactic to bring back utility creatures or either &quot;Verdant Force&quot; or &quot;Spirit of the Night&quot;, both very expensive, powerful, and usually game-ending cards.

<doc id="1253093" wikidata="Q234618" url="?curid=1253093" title="Paz Vega">
<text>María de la Paz Campos Trigo (born 2 January 1976), known professionally as Paz Vega (), is a Spanish actress and filmmaker. She became popular for her performance in comedy television series &quot;7 vidas&quot;. Her film credits include &quot;Sex and Lucia&quot; (2001), &quot;Mine Alone&quot; (2001), &quot;The Other Side of the Bed&quot; (2002), &quot;Carmen&quot; (2003), &quot;Spanglish&quot; (2004), &quot;10 Items or Less&quot; (2006), &quot;&quot; (2007), &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (2012), &quot;All Roads Lead to Rome&quot; (2015), &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; (2017), and &quot;&quot; (2019). She played the role of Catalina Creel in the 2019 television series &quot;Cradle of Wolves&quot; (&quot;Cuna de lobos&quot;).

==Early life==
Vega was born in Seville, Andalusia, in 1976 to a housewife mother and a father who was a former bullfighter. Vega&#x27;s younger sister has performed as a flamenco dancer. Vega has described her family as &quot;traditional&quot; and Catholic. She took her stage surname of &#x27;Vega&#x27; from her grandmother. Vega decided to become an actress after attending a performance of Federico García Lorca&#x27;s play, &quot;Bernarda Alba&#x27;s House&quot; (&quot;La casa de Bernarda Alba&quot;), when she was 16.

After completing compulsory education at 16, Vega was accepted at the &quot;Andalusian Theater Center&quot; (&quot;Centro Andaluz de Teatro&quot;) stage school. She studied there for two years and took another two years studying journalism. She next moved to Madrid to seek her future.

== Screen career ==

Vega made her television debut in the Spanish TV series, &quot;My Father Is So Nice&quot; (&quot;Menudo es mi padre&quot;), which starred rumba singer El Fary. She appeared in two other series in 1997; &quot;More Than Friends&quot; (&quot;Más que amigos&quot;) and &quot;Companions&quot; (&quot;Compañeros&quot;).

In 1999, she made her film debut in &quot;Zapping&quot;. The same year, she also had a minor role in the David Menkes movie &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, alongside Emma Suárez, and Juan Diego Botto.

Vega found success in 1999&#x27;s TV series &quot;7 Lives&quot; (&quot;7 Vidas&quot;). The series was billed as a Spanish &quot;Friends&quot; and became one of the country&#x27;s best-loved domestic sitcoms. Vega played Laura, a perky Andalusian girl who had come to stay with David, who had recently come out of a coma. The series was broadcast on Telecinco and finished on 12 April 2006, albeit without Vega.

In 2001, she starred in Julio Médem&#x27;s film &quot;Sex and Lucia&quot;, which brought her to the attention of a larger audience. However, she received prominent exposure, particularly to American audiences, when she appeared in the 2004 James L. Brooks American film &quot;Spanglish&quot; opposite Adam Sandler. In 2006, she co-starred with American actor Morgan Freeman in the independent film &quot;10 Items or Less&quot;, directed by Brad Silberling. In 2008, she co-starred with Gabriel Macht, Samuel L. Jackson, and Scarlett Johansson in &quot;The Spirit&quot;. In 2011, Vega had a role in Michele Placido&#x27;s film &quot;Vallanzasca – The Angels of Evil&quot;.

Vega also works as a model; she is signed to 1/One Management in New York City. In May 2011, Vega replaced Penélope Cruz as the face for L&#x27;Oreal Spain.

In 2018, she participated in the third season of the reality cooking show &quot;MasterChef Celebrity&quot;.

In 2019, Vega appeared in Televisa to portray the lead character Catalina Creel in the miniseries &quot;Cradle of Wolves&quot; (&quot;Cuna de Lobos&quot;), based on the 1986 original telenovela of the same title. The same year, she portrayed an independent Mexican reporter in &quot;Rambo: Last Blood&quot;, in which she co-starred with Sylvester Stallone.

In 2023, Vega announced in Cannes the beginning of filming of her directorial debut, &quot;Rita&quot;, a feature film set in 1980s Seville billed by Vega as a &quot;&quot;costumbrista&quot; and nostalgic&quot; story. The film premiered at 2024 Locarno Film Festival and earned her a nomination for the Goya Award for Best New Director.

<doc id="1253108" wikidata="Q5157154" url="?curid=1253108" title="Compton Crook Award">
<text>The Compton Crook Award is presented by the Baltimore Science Fiction Society (BSFS) to the year&#x27;s best English language debut novel in the science fiction, fantasy, or horror genres, as voted by its members. BSFS confers the award at their annual science fiction convention, Balticon, held in Baltimore on Memorial Day weekend. The award, also known as the Compton Crook/Stephen Tall Award, has been presented since 1983. Compton Crook, who wrote under the name of Stephen Tall, was a long-time Baltimore resident, Towson University professor, and science fiction author who died in 1981.

The list of eligible books is published in the monthly newsletter so that all club members will have a chance to read and vote. The winning author receives a cash award of $1,000 as well as a plaque, and their Balticon attendance is sponsored for two years; in the second year, the author presents the award to their successor. The invitation to Balticon is intended in part as a professional networking opportunity for the new author.

<text>In linguistics, fortis ( ; Latin for &#x27;strong&#x27;) and lenis (, ; Latin for &#x27;weak&#x27;), sometimes identified with &#x27;tense&#x27; and &#x27;lax&#x27;, are pronunciations of consonants with relatively greater and lesser energy, respectively. English has fortis consonants, such as the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;pat&quot;, with a corresponding lenis consonant, such as the &quot;b&quot; in &quot;bat&quot;. Fortis and lenis consonants may be distinguished by tenseness or other characteristics, such as voicing, aspiration, glottalization, velarization, length, and length of nearby vowels. &quot;Fortis&quot; and &quot;lenis&quot; were coined for languages where the contrast between sounds such as &#x27;p&#x27; and &#x27;b&#x27; does not involve voicing (vibration of the vocal cords).

== History ==
Originally, the terms were used to refer to an impressionistic sense of strength differences, though more sophisticated instruments eventually gave the opportunity to search for the acoustic and articulatory signs. For example, tested whether articulatory strength could be detected by measuring the force of the contact between the articulators or of the peak pressure in the mouth. Because such studies initially found little to substantiate the terminology, phoneticians have largely ceased using them, though they are still commonly used as &quot;phonological labels for specifying a dichotomy when used language-specifically.&quot; This can be useful when the actual articulatory features underlying the distinction are unknown, under-researched or irrelevant.

== Characteristics ==

=== Articulatory strength ===
Later studies have shown that articulatory strength is not completely irrelevant. The articulators in the mouth can move with a greater velocity and/or with higher electromyographic activation levels of the relevant articulatory muscles with fortis consonants than with lenis ones.

==== Oral pressure ====
Generally, voiceless stops have greater oral pressure than voiced ones, which could explain this greater articulatory energy. In Ewe, for example, the lips reach closure faster in articulating than in , making the lip closure longer. These differences in oral articulatory energy in consonants of different laryngeal settings is fairly widespread, though the correlation of energy and voicing is not universal. Indeed, a number of languages have been proposed as making strength differences independently of voicing, such as Tabasaran, Archi, Udi, and Aghul.

==== Subglottal pressure ====
It is rare for the use of greater &quot;respiratory&quot; energy for segments to occur in a language, though some examples do exist, such as Korean, which makes a three way contrast amongst most of its obstruents with voiceless, aspirated, and a third faucalized voiced set that involves both an increase in subglottal pressure as well as greater glottal constriction and tenseness in the walls of the vocal tract. Igbo has also been observed to utilize an increase in subglottal pressure involving its aspirated consonants.

=== Consonant length ===
&quot;Fortis&quot; and &quot;lenis&quot; have also been used to refer to contrasts of consonant duration in languages like Jawoyn, Ojibwe, Dalabon, Kunwinjku, and Zurich German. The Zapotec languages are also considered to have contrast of length rather than of voicing. For example, in Mixe, lenis consonants are not only pronounced shorter than their fortis counterparts, but they are also prone to voicing in voiced environments, which fortis consonants are not.

This association with longer duration has prompted some to propose a diachronic link between fortis consonants and gemination. even proposes that gemination is itself a process of fortition in Italian.

Many North Caucasian languages (Northwest and especially Northeast) have a consonantal distinction described as &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;preruptive&quot; that has concomitant length. Akhvakh and other Northeast Caucasian languages even possess a distinction between strong/long and weak/short ejective consonants: (&#x27;soup&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;cock&#x27;s comb&#x27;)

=== Relationship between strength and length ===
 describes the fortis consonants for Archi: 
Fortis stops in Australian Aboriginal languages such as Rembarunga (see Ngalakgan) also involve length, with short consonants having weak contact and intermittent voicing, and long consonants having full closure, a more powerful release burst, and no voicing. It is not clear if strength makes the consonants long, or if during long consonants there is a greater opportunity for full articulation.

=== Enforcement of phonemic distinctions ===
Articulatory strength can reinforce other distinctions. Ewe, for example, which contrasts a voiceless bilabial fricative and a voiceless labiodental fricative , pronounces the latter markedly more strongly than in most languages. This helps differentiate what would otherwise be a very subtle distinction.

In English, use of the terms &quot;fortis&quot; and &quot;lenis&quot; is useful to refer to contrasts between consonants that have different phonetic attributes depending on context. The alveolar consonants and , for example:
: Depending on dialect, and may not neutralize with flapping, with the contrast manifesting itself in the preceding vowel&#x27;s duration.
: In the same syllable, the distinction between and is lost after .

As the above table shows, no one feature is adequate to accurately reflect the contrasts in all contexts. Word-initially, the contrast has more to do with aspiration; is aspirated and is an unaspirated voiceless stop. In the syllable coda, however, is instead pronounced with glottalization, unrelease, and a shorter vowel while remains voiceless. In this way, the terms &quot;fortis&quot; and &quot;lenis&quot; are convenient in discussing English phonology, even if they are phonetically imprecise.

In southern German dialects, the actual distinction underlying obstruent pairs varies somewhat depending on the dialect, but is often one of length—fortis sounds are pronounced geminated in all positions in a word, even at the end of a word or before other consonants.

== Notation ==
The IPA provides no specific means for representation of a fortis–lenis contrast. The extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet provide a diacritic for strong articulation (e.g. ) and weak articulation (), but this does not cover all of the phonetic differences that have been categorized under fortis and lenis. Americanist phonetic notation uses fortis and lenis .

Different ways of transcribing the fortis–lenis contrast have been used. For instance, for the transcription of the Zürich German fortis–lenis contrast – which involves neither voicing nor aspiration –, notations such as the following ones have appeared in the relevant literature:

*The fortis–lenis contrast may be transcribed with plain vs .
*The fortis–lenis contrast may be transcribed as a gemination contrast ( or vs ).
*The fortis–lenis contrast may be transcribed as vs , that is, the lenes are marked with the IPA diacritic for voicelessness. By strict IPA definition, in this context can only denote partially devoiced obstruents. This notation emphasizes that there is more than just voice to the contrast between vs .

This means that depending on the system, may have opposite values, i.e. they may represent either fortis or lenis sounds.

<doc id="1253114" wikidata="Q157847" url="?curid=1253114" title="Toni Schumacher">
<text>Harald Anton &quot;Toni&quot; Schumacher (born 6 March 1954) is a German former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. At club level, he won a Bundesliga title and three DFB-Pokal titles with 1. FC Köln. At international level, he represented West Germany. Schumacher won the 1980 European Championship and reached two World Cup finals, in 1982 and 1986, being on the losing side for both. 
In the 1982 FIFA World Cup semi-final, he controversially collided with and seriously injured French defender Patrick Battiston. Schumacher was voted German Footballer of the Year in 1984 and 1986. Since April 2012, he has served as vice president at 1. FC Köln.

==Club career==
Schumacher made his first-team debut with 1. FC Köln at the age of 19. He played for the club from 1972 to 1987, including in 213 consecutive Bundesliga matches from 1977 to 1983. For most of those years, until well into the mid-1980s, he was widely considered one of the world&#x27;s top goalkeepers, and he was the automatic first-choice goalkeeper for his country. He backstopped Köln to the double in 1978, winning the Bundesliga title (ahead of Borussia Mönchengladbach on goal difference) and the DFB-Pokal (defeated Fortuna Düsseldorf). The year before he had led Köln to a DFB-Pokal victory (against Hertha BSC in the final), the club&#x27;s first major trophy win in nine years. He appeared in two other DFB-Pokal finals, in 1980 (lost to Fortuna Düsseldorf) and 1983 (defeated Fortuna Köln). Schumacher was voted German Footballer of the Year twice, in 1984 and 1986, by the nation&#x27;s football journalists.

==International career==
Schumacher played 76 international matches for West Germany between 1979 and 1986, including 15 World Cup qualifying matches and 14 World Cup matches. He won the 1980 European Championship (defeated Belgium 2–1 in the final) and reached two World Cup finals, losing both – in 1982 (to Italy, 3–1) and 1986 (to Argentina, 3–2). In the 1982 tournament, in the controversial semi-final against France, he saved two penalties in the first penalty shootout of the World Cup Finals, which West Germany ultimately won. In the 1986 quarter-final against tournament hosts, Mexico, he saved two of the three shootout penalties he faced, enabling West Germany to advance again.

===Controversy at 1982 World Cup===

Schumacher was involved in a collision with a French defender, substitute Patrick Battiston, in the semi-final of the 1982 World Cup. Battiston and Schumacher were both sprinting towards a long through ball pass from Michel Platini. Battiston managed to reach the ball first and flicked it up and to the side of the approaching Schumacher. Schumacher leapt into the air as the ball sailed past him, ultimately wide of the goal. Schumacher, still in the air, collided with Battiston. The resulting contact left Battiston unconscious, later slipping into a coma. Schumacher has always denied any foul intention regarding the incident, saying that he was simply going for the ball, as a goalkeeper is entitled to do. Others have alleged that he intentionally collided with Battiston. Battiston also lost two teeth and had three cracked ribs. He received oxygen on the pitch. Michel Platini later said that he thought Battiston had died, because &quot;he had no pulse and looked pale&quot;. The Dutch referee Charles Corver did not award a penalty for the incident. Schumacher proceeded to take the goal kick and play resumed. West Germany would eventually go on to win the game on penalty kicks after the match was tied at 3–3.

Schumacher caused more controversy after the game with his response to news that Battiston had lost two teeth: &quot;If that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s wrong, tell him I&#x27;ll pay for the crowns.&quot;

Schumacher did visit Battiston in the hospital, and though the Frenchman felt his apology at the time was insincere, Battiston admitted that he had forgiven him by the time the two countries faced each other four years later in yet another World Cup semifinal. That match ended in a 2–0 victory for West Germany.

A French newspaper poll asked which was the least popular man in France. Schumacher came first, beating second place Adolf Hitler.

When West Germany and France met again in World Cup 1986, Battiston said that the incident was &quot;forgiven and forgotten&quot;. However, he said that he was wary of getting &quot;close to Schumacher&quot; and said that he would hold a distance of at least 40 meters from the West German goalkeeper. Schumacher would mostly refrain from commenting on the incident.

==Coaching career==
As coach of SC Fortuna Köln he was sacked at half time by club chairman Jean Löring when his club was 0–2 behind against Waldhof Mannheim in December 1999.

== Vice president 1. FC Köln ==
Schumacher was elected on 23 April 2012 vice president of 1. FC Köln together with Werner Spinner as president. During his tenure within the presidium, he was primarily responsible for the sporting area. His term of office ended at the beginning of September 2019.

==Autobiography==
In 1987, Schumacher&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Anpfiff&quot; (&quot;kick-off&quot;) was published in various countries, including France, where there was interest in Schumacher&#x27;s comments on the Battiston incident. Schumacher maintained that his actions did not constitute a foul and that he was only trying to get the ball. He said that he did not go over to check on Battiston&#x27;s condition because several French players were standing around Battiston and making threatening gestures in his direction.

The book also included accounts of alleged improprieties by German football players, including substance abuse. This resulted in Schumacher&#x27;s exclusion from the Germany national team and his long-term Bundesliga club, 1. FC Köln.

<text>The Battle of Kennesaw Mountain was fought on June 27, 1864, during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. The most significant frontal assault launched by Union Major General William T. Sherman against the Confederate Army of Tennessee under General Joseph E. Johnston, it produced a tactical defeat for the Union forces but failed to deliver the result that the Confederacy desperately needed: a halt to Sherman&#x27;s advance on Atlanta, Georgia.

Sherman&#x27;s 1864 campaign against Atlanta began with a series of flanking maneuvers that compelled Johnston&#x27;s forces to withdraw from heavily fortified positions with minimal casualties on either side. After two months and of such maneuvering, Sherman&#x27;s path was blocked by imposing fortifications on Kennesaw Mountain, near Marietta, Georgia. The Union general chose to change his tactics and ordered a large-scale frontal assault on June 27. Major General James B. McPherson feinted against the northern end of Kennesaw Mountain, while his corps under Major General John A. Logan assaulted Pigeon Hill on its southwest corner. At the same time, Major General George H. Thomas launched strong attacks against Cheatham Hill at the center of the Confederate line. Both attacks were repulsed with heavy losses, but a demonstration by Major General John M. Schofield achieved a strategic success by threatening the Confederate army&#x27;s left flank, prompting yet another Confederate withdrawal toward Atlanta and the removal of General Johnston from command of the army.

==Background==
In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant was promoted to lieutenant general and named general in chief of the Union Army. He devised a strategy of multiple, simultaneous offensives against the Confederacy, hoping to prevent any of the rebel armies from reinforcing the others over interior lines. The two most significant of these were by Major General George G. Meade&#x27;s Army of the Potomac, accompanied by Grant himself, which would attack Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army directly and advance toward the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia; and Major General William T. Sherman, replacing Grant in his role as commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi, who would advance from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Atlanta.

Both Grant and Sherman initially had objectives to engage with and destroy the two principal armies of the Confederacy, relegating the capture of important enemy cities to a secondary, supporting role. This was a strategy that President Abraham Lincoln had emphasized throughout the war, but Grant was the first general who actively cooperated with it. As their campaigns progressed, however, the political importance of the cities of Richmond and Atlanta began to dominate their strategy. By 1864, Atlanta was a critical target. The city of 20,000 was founded at the intersection of four important railroad lines that supplied the Confederacy and was a military manufacturing arsenal in its own right. Atlanta&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Gate City of the South&quot; was apt—its capture would open virtually the entire Deep South to Union conquest. Grant&#x27;s orders to Sherman were to &quot;move against Johnston&#x27;s Army, to break it up and to get into the interior of the enemy&#x27;s country as far as you can, inflicting all the damage you can against their war resources.&quot;

Sherman&#x27;s force of about 100,000 men was composed of three subordinate armies: the Army of the Tennessee (Grant&#x27;s and later Sherman&#x27;s army of 1862–63) under Major General James B. McPherson; the Army of the Cumberland under Major General George H. Thomas; and the relatively small Army of the Ohio (composed of only the XXIII Corps) under Major General John M. Schofield. Their principal opponent was the Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, who had replaced the unpopular Braxton Bragg after his defeat in Chattanooga in November 1863. The 50,000-man army consisted of the infantry corps of lieutenant generals William J. Hardee, John Bell Hood, and Leonidas Polk, and a cavalry corps under Major General Joseph Wheeler.

==Start of the Atlanta campaign==

Sherman&#x27;s campaign began on May 7, as his three armies departed from the vicinity of Chattanooga. He launched demonstration attacks against Johnston&#x27;s position on the long, high mountain named Rocky Face Ridge while McPherson&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee advanced stealthily around Johnston&#x27;s left flank toward the town of Resaca, and Johnston&#x27;s supply line on the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad. Unfortunately for Sherman, McPherson encountered a small Confederate force entrenched in the outskirts of Resaca and cautiously pulled back to Snake Creek Gap, squandering the opportunity to trap the Confederate army. As Sherman swung his entire army in the direction of Resaca, Johnston retired to take up positions there. Full scale fighting erupted in the Battle of Resaca on May 14–15 but there was no conclusive result and Sherman flanked Johnston for a second time by crossing the Oostanaula River. As Johnston withdrew again, skirmishing erupted at Adairsville on May 17 and more general fighting on Johnston&#x27;s Cassville line May 18–19. Johnston planned to defeat part of Sherman&#x27;s force as it approached on multiple routes, but Hood became uncharacteristically cautious and feared encirclement, failing to attack as ordered. Encouraged by Hood and Polk, Johnston ordered another withdrawal, this time across the Etowah River.

Johnston&#x27;s army took up defensive positions at Allatoona Pass south of Cartersville, but Sherman once again turned Johnston&#x27;s left as he temporarily abandoned his railroad supply line and advanced on Dallas. Johnston was forced to move from his strong position and meet Sherman&#x27;s army in the open. Fierce but inconclusive fighting occurred on May 25 at New Hope Church, May 27 at Pickett&#x27;s Mill, and May 28 at Dallas. By June 1, heavy rains turned the roads to quagmires and Sherman was forced to return to the railroad to supply his men. Johnston&#x27;s new line (called the Brushy Mountain Line) was established by June 4 northwest of Marietta, along Lost Mountain, Pine Mountain, and Brush Mountain. On June 14, following eleven days of steady rain, Sherman was ready to move again. While on a personal reconnaissance, he spotted a group of Confederate officers on Pine Mountain and ordered one of his artillery batteries to open fire. Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk, the &quot;Fighting Bishop&quot;, was killed and Johnston withdrew his men from Pine Mountain, establishing a new line in an arc-shaped defensive position from Kennesaw Mountain to Little Kennesaw Mountain. Hood&#x27;s corps attempted an unsuccessful attack at Peter Kolb&#x27;s farm (the Battle of Kolb&#x27;s Farm) south of Little Kennesaw Mountain on June 22. Major General William W. Loring succeeded in temporarily commanding Polk&#x27;s corps.

Sherman was in a difficult position, stalled north of Atlanta. He could not continue his strategy of moving around Johnston&#x27;s flank because of the impassable roads, and his railroad supply line was dominated by Johnston&#x27;s position on the top of Kennesaw Mountain. He reported to Washington &quot;The whole country is one vast fort, and Johnston must have at least of connected trenches with abatis and finished batteries. We gain ground daily, fighting all the time. ... Our lines are now in close contact and the fighting incessant, with a good deal of artillery. As fast as we gain one position the enemy has another all ready. ... Kennesaw ... is the key to the whole country.&quot; Sherman decided to break the stalemate by attacking Johnston&#x27;s position on Kennesaw Mountain. He issued orders on June 24 for an 8:00 a.m. attack on June 27.

==Battle==
Sherman&#x27;s plan was first to induce Johnston to thin out and weaken his line by ordering Schofield to extend his army to the right. Then McPherson was to make a feint on his extreme left—the northern outskirts of Marietta and the northeastern end of Kennesaw Mountain—with his cavalry and a division of infantry, and to make a major assault on the southwestern end of Little Kennesaw Mountain. Meanwhile, Thomas&#x27;s army was to conduct the principal attack against the Confederate fortifications in the center of their line, and Schofield was to demonstrate on the Confederate left flank and attack somewhere near the Powder Springs Road &quot;as he can with the prospect of success.&quot;

At 8:00 a.m. on June 27, Union artillery opened a furious bombardment with over 200 guns on the Confederate works and the Rebel artillery responded in kind. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph S. Fullerton wrote, &quot;Kennesaw smoked and blazed with fire, a volcano as grand as Etna.&quot; As the Federal infantry began moving soon afterward, the Confederates quickly determined that much of the wide advance consisted of demonstrations rather than concerted assaults. The first of those assaults began at around 8:30 a.m., with three brigades of Brigadier General Morgan L. Smith&#x27;s division (Major General John A. Logan&#x27;s XV Corps, Army of the Tennessee) moving against Loring&#x27;s corps on the southern end of Little Kennesaw Mountain and the spur known as Pigeon Hill near the Burnt Hickory Road. If the attack were successful, capturing Pigeon Hill would isolate Loring&#x27;s corps on Kennesaw Mountain. All three brigades were disadvantaged by the approach through dense thickets, steep and rocky slopes, and a lack of knowledge of the terrain. About 5,500 Union troops in two columns of regiments moved against about 5,000 Confederate soldiers, well entrenched.

On the right of Smith&#x27;s attack, the brigade of Brigadier General Joseph A. J. Lightburn was forced to advance through a knee-deep swamp, and were stopped short of the Confederate breastworks on the southern end of Pigeon Hill by enfilading fire. They were able to overrun the rifle pits in front of the works, but could not pierce the main Confederate line. To their left, the brigades of Colonel Charles C. Walcutt and Brigadier General Giles A. Smith crossed difficult terrain interrupted by steep cliffs and scattered with huge rocks to approach the Missouri brigade of Brigadier General Francis Cockrell. Some of the troops were able to reach as far as the abatis, but most were not and they were forced to remain stationary, firing behind trees and rocks. When General Logan rode forward to judge their progress, he determined that many of his men were being &quot;uselessly slain&quot; and ordered Walcutt and Smith to withdraw and entrench behind the gorge that separated the lines.

About to the south, Thomas&#x27;s troops were behind schedule, but began their main attack against Hardee&#x27;s corps at 9:00 a.m. Two divisions of the Army of the Cumberland—about 9,000 men under Brigadier General John Newton (Major General Oliver O. Howard&#x27;s IV Corps) and Brigadier General Jefferson C. Davis (Maj. Gen. John M. Palmer&#x27;s XIV Corps)—advanced in column formation rather than the typical broad line of battle against the Confederate divisions of major generals Benjamin F. Cheatham and Patrick R. Cleburne, entrenched on what is now known as &quot;Cheatham Hill&quot;. On Newton&#x27;s left, his brigade, under Brigadier General George D. Wagner, attacked through dense undergrowth, but was unable to break through the abatis and fierce rifle fire. On his right, the brigade of Brigadier General Charles G. Harker charged the Tennessee brigade of Brigadier General Alfred Vaughan and was repulsed. During a second charge, Harker was mortally wounded.

Davis&#x27;s division, to the right of Newton&#x27;s, also advanced in column formation. While such a movement offered the opportunity for a quick breakthrough by massing power against a narrow point, it also had the disadvantage of offering a large concentrated target to enemy guns. Their orders were to advance silently, capture the works, and then cheer to give a signal to the reserve divisions to move forward to secure the railroad and cut the Confederate army in two. Colonel Daniel McCook&#x27;s brigade advanced down a slope to a creek and then crossed a wheat field to ascend the slope of Cheatham Hill. When they reached within a few yards of the Confederate works, the line halted, crouched, and began firing. But the Confederate counter fire was too strong and McCook&#x27;s brigade lost two commanders (McCook and his replacement, Colonel Oscar F. Harmon), nearly all of its field officers, and a third of its men. McCook was killed on the Confederate parapet as he slashed with his sword and shouted &quot;Surrender, you traitors!&quot; Colonel John G. Mitchell&#x27;s brigade on McCook&#x27;s right suffered similar losses. After ferocious hand-to-hand fighting, the Union troops dug in across from the Confederates, ending the fighting around 10:45 a.m. Both sides nicknamed this place the &quot;Dead Angle&quot;.

To the right of Davis&#x27;s division, Major General John W. Geary&#x27;s division of Major General Joseph Hooker&#x27;s XX Corps advanced, but did not join in Davis&#x27;s attack. Considerably farther to the right, however, was the site of the only success of the day. Schofield&#x27;s army had been assigned to demonstrate against the Confederate left and he was able to put two brigades across Olley&#x27;s Creek without resistance. That movement, along with an advance by Major General George Stoneman&#x27;s cavalry division on Schofield&#x27;s right, put Union troops within of the Chattahoochee River, closer to the last river protecting Atlanta than any unit in Johnston&#x27;s army.

==Aftermath==

Sherman&#x27;s armies suffered about 3,000 casualties in comparison to Johnston&#x27;s 1,000. The Union general was not initially deterred by these losses and he twice asked Thomas to renew the assault. &quot;Our loss is small, compared to some of those [battles in the] East.&quot; The Rock of Chickamauga replied, however, &quot;One or two more such assaults would use up this army.&quot; A few days later Sherman wrote to his wife, &quot;I begin to regard the death and mangling of couple thousand men as a small affair, a kind of morning dash.&quot;

Kennesaw Mountain was not Sherman&#x27;s first large-scale frontal assault of the war, but it was his last. He interrupted his string of successful flanking maneuvers in the Atlanta campaign for the logistical reasons mentioned earlier, but also so that he could keep Johnston guessing about the tactics he would employ in the future. In his report of the battle, Sherman wrote, &quot;I perceived that the enemy and our officers had settled down into a conviction that I would not assault fortified lines. All looked to me to outflank. An army to be efficient, must not settle down to a single mode of offence, but must be prepared to execute any plan which promises success. I wanted, therefore, for the moral effect, to make a successful assault against the enemy behind his breastworks, and resolved to attempt it at that point where success would give the largest fruits of victory.&quot;

Kennesaw Mountain is usually considered a significant Union tactical defeat, but Richard M. McMurry wrote, &quot;Tactically Johnston had won a minor defensive triumph on Loring&#x27;s and Hardee&#x27;s lines. Schofield&#x27;s success, however, gave Sherman a great advantage, and the federal commander quickly decided to exploit it.&quot; The opposing forces spent five days facing each other at close range, but on July 2, with good summer weather at hand, Sherman sent the Army of the Tennessee and Stoneman&#x27;s cavalry around the Confederate left flank and Johnston was forced to withdraw from Kennesaw Mountain to prepared positions at Smyrna.

On July 8, Sherman outflanked Johnston again—for the first time on his right—by sending Schofield to cross the Chattahoochee near the mouth of Sope Creek. The last major geographic barrier to entering Atlanta had been overcome. Alarmed at the imminent danger posed to the city of Atlanta, and frustrated with the strategy of continual withdrawals, Confederate president Jefferson Davis relieved Johnston of command on July 17, replacing him with the aggressive John Bell Hood, who was temporarily promoted to full general. Hood proceeded to attack Sherman in battles at Peachtree Creek (July 20), Atlanta/Decatur (July 22), and Ezra Church (July 28), in all of which he suffered enormous casualties without tactical advantage. Sherman besieged Atlanta for the month of August, but sent almost his entire force swinging to the south to cut off the city&#x27;s last remaining railroad connection. In the Battle of Jonesboro (August 31 and September 1), Hood attacked again to save his railroad, but was unsuccessful and was forced to evacuate Atlanta. Sherman&#x27;s men entered the city on September 2 and Sherman telegraphed President Lincoln, &quot;Atlanta is ours, and fairly won.&quot; This milestone was arguably one of the key factors enabling Lincoln&#x27;s reelection in November.

==A soldier&#x27;s perspective==
The battle is described from the perspective of Sam Watkins, a volunteer in the 1st Tennessee Infantry Regiment of the Confederate Army, in the book &quot;Company Aytch&quot; (see the section entitled &quot;Dead Angle, on the Kennesaw Line&quot;).

==Battlefield today==
The site of the battle is now part of Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, where both Confederate deliberate trenches on top of the mountain and some Union rifle pits are still visible. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have saved almost four acres of battlefield land outside the park as of mid-2023.

<text>Raymond Lynch (born July 3, 1943) is an American guitarist, lutenist, keyboardist, and composer known for his new-age releases in the 1980s. 

In the late 1960s, Lynch performed on the lute in New York&#x27;s Renaissance Quartette, but he withdrew to California and began incorporating electronic music elements, as heard in 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Sky of Mind&quot;. He vaulted to fame in 1986 with the single &quot;Celestial Soda Pop&quot; and the 1984 album &quot;Deep Breakfast&quot;, becoming the first independent new-age artist certified Gold for sales of 500,000. His album &quot;No Blue Thing&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; New Age album chart in 1989. Lynch sued his label Music West and joined Windham Hill in 1992 before retiring in 2000. 

==Early life==
Lynch was born on July 3, 1943, in Salt Lake City, Utah. As the second of four children, Lynch was raised in West Texas. Lynch&#x27;s father was a lawyer; Lynch&#x27;s mother was a noted watercolorist and an amateur pianist who influenced him to create music as a child. Other early influences included hymns and soundtracks. Lynch began studying the piano at the age of six. At age twelve, he was inspired by Andrés Segovia&#x27;s classical recordings and decided to pursue a career in music. After attending High School in both St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal School and Austin High School, Lynch went to the Austin campus of the University of Texas. After studying there for a year, he moved to Barcelona with his then wife Ginny and his child. Over there, he was apprenticed to Eduardo Sainz de la Maza, a classical guitar teacher. Three years later Lynch returned to the university to study composition with various instruments including guitar, lute, and vihuela. While Lynch went on to become a musician, his siblings ended up becoming lawyers.

==Life and career==
In 1967, while still in college, Lynch was invited to New York City to join the Renaissance Quartet, performing the lute alongside Robert White (tenor), Barbara Mueser (viol), and Morris Newman (recorder), replacing Joseph Iadone. Lynch also performed with other groups, such as &quot;Festival Winds&quot;, as well as collaborative and solo performances. Lynch also taught the guitar, lute, and vihuela in the Mexican city of Taxco in the late 1960s. During his career, Lynch purchased a 125-acre farm in Maine. By 1974, Lynch experienced a &quot;spiritual crisis&quot; that led to his decision to move from Maine to California and give up his musical career. Although he became a carpenter and a purchasing agent in California, Lynch also continued to practice his compositional skills. In an interview with &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, Lynch said that his return to music was prompted by a suggestion from his spiritual teacher, Adi Da, in California.

To prepare for his return to music, Lynch bought an ARP Odyssey with &quot;borrowed money&quot; in 1980; the synthesizer helped him create music in the developing electronic genre. Two years later, Lynch released his first album, &quot;Truth Is the Only Profound&quot;, which recites the teachings of Adi Da &quot;set to the background of devotional music and songs&quot;. Lynch later followed up with an instrumental album, &quot;The Sky of Mind&quot;. When Lynch released his third album, &quot;Deep Breakfast&quot;, in 1984 independently, he sold over 72,000 albums out of his small apartment. Lynch was featured on Musical Starstreams in June 1985. Immediately after joining Music West in Winter 1985, he released &quot;Deep Breakfast&quot; to a wider audience. The track &quot;Celestial Soda Pop&quot; was used in 1986 as theme music for the NPR program &quot;Fresh Air&quot;. In January 1989, the album hit number 2 on the Billboard New Age chart, then in April it was certified Gold by the RIAA. In August 1989, &quot;No Blue Thing&quot; was released, and it became Lynch&#x27;s first album to hit number 1 on Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Top New Age Albums&quot; chart, doing so in September. &quot;No Blue Thing&quot; was also his only album to appear on Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Top 200 Albums&quot;, peaking at number 197. It won Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Top New Age Album&quot; in 1990, and Lynch also won Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Top New Age Artist&quot; in both 1989 and 1990. After years of steady sales, &quot;Deep Breakfast&quot; was certified Platinum in May 1993.

During his time with Music West, Lynch was featured on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; as well as the Spanish La 1 program &quot;Música N.A.&quot;. In 1991, Lynch sued Music West for allegedly not paying him for his work. He left Music West, taking the rights to his music with him, and signed up with Windham Hill Records. Under the new label, Lynch&#x27;s albums &quot;The Sky of Mind&quot; and &quot;No Blue Thing&quot; (but not &quot;Deep Breakfast&quot;) were re-released in September 1992 with new album covers.

Under the new record company, Lynch followed up with his final album, the classical &quot;Nothing Above My Shoulders but the Evening&quot;, in 1993. The album featured members of the San Francisco Symphony. Like the preceding album, it hit number 1 on the &quot;Top New Age Albums&quot; chart. In 1998, Lynch released his first and only compilation album, &quot;Ray Lynch: Best Of, Volume One&quot;, which included two original tracks and a remix of &quot;Celestial Soda Pop&quot;. Lynch left Windham Hill in 2000 and re-released his own catalog of music under his own record company.

In September 2015, Lynch&#x27;s house was destroyed by the Valley Fire, along with his studio, awards, and the master tapes of his music. As a result, his friend Grant Valdes Huling set up a GoFundMe page, which ultimately raised over $20,000.

== Influences ==
Throughout his career, Lynch did not want his music to be classified as &quot;New Age&quot;. In an interview with CD Review in August 1989, Lynch said he didn&#x27;t really mind being labeled as a &quot;new age&quot; artist, but says that he doesn&#x27;t like &quot;being grouped with music that I felt is, in general, pretty mediocre and boring&quot;. Lynch also said that &quot;&#x27;classical&#x27; would be the best category for me.&quot;

Lynch had been both a student and follower of Adi Da since 1974. In regards to the spiritual nature of his music, Lynch believed that it &quot;has to be judged subjectively by the listener, not the composer.&quot; Lynch named several of his songs and albums after the themes found in Da&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Mummery Book&quot;. However, in a 1989 Arizona Republic interview, Lynch clarified that he wasn&#x27;t trying to promote Da&#x27;s work through his music. After the death of Adi Da, Lynch performed various songs for Da&#x27;s tribute album, &quot;May You Ever Dwell In Our Heart&quot;, in 2009.

<text>Assignment Nor&#x27;Dyren is a 1973 science fiction novel by American writer Sydney J. Van Scyoc. It deals with an imagined world, Nor&#x27;Dyren, where an alien human-like species has a more structured social system than is the case for human society. When humans come to Nor&#x27;Dyren, they discover that there are three specialized types of Nor&#x27;Dyrenese.

This three-way division of labor does not seem to be working. Nobody on Nor&#x27;Dyren knows how to repair broken machines. Nobody ever creates anything new. Archeological investigation reveals that the world Nor&#x27;Dyren has been in decline for 200 years from its cultural and technological apex.

==Plot details==

Eventually, the humans who are visiting Nor&#x27;Dyren discover that until 200 years previously, there were four distinct groups of Nor&#x27;Dyrenese. The fourth group (Qattagon) had been specialized to perform all of the creative work of society and was very artistic. However, the Qattagon had gotten too wild and radical and had come into conflict with the Gonnegon. This conflict ended when the administrative Gonnegon engineered the Qattagon out of the social system. This was possible because the Qattagon were not capable of reproducing; Qattagon were the result of interbreeding among the other three groups. To engineer Qattagon out of the society, the administrators decreed that members of each of the other three groups could only mate with other members of their own group. Under this imposed rule, none of the artistic hybrid Qattagon were born anymore.

The reason that the Qattagon had gotten out of control and become a problem for Nor&#x27;Dyren was because the balance between the four groups had been engineered to be appropriate for worlds that were part of a large interstellar empire. But in the distant past, that empire had collapsed, leaving the planet Nor&#x27;Dyren isolated and unable to absorb the full force of the creativity of its Qattagon.

==Implications for human society==
&quot;Assignment Nor&#x27;Dyren&quot; is a pleasant mystery novel set on an interesting alien world, but it also leads the reader to think about some issues that are important on Earth.

===Genetic engineering of the human species===
The most interesting technical issue raised by this book concerns genetic engineering. The Allegon, Berregon, Gonnegon and Qattagon appear to be the result of genetic engineering, four specialized variations of the original species, rationally designed so as to form a stable social system. On Earth, humans now have the technology for genetically modifying our own species. We are also starting to explore space and confronting the problem of how to deal with the changes that come with science and technology. Is any human-like species biologically suited for dealing with the challenges of science, technology and space exploration? Is it inevitable that in order to survive its &quot;technological adolescence&quot;, any species must get involved with genetically modifying itself?

===Homosexuality and creativity===
A major social issue raised by this book is the relationship between creativity and human homosexuality. The possibility of a link between homosexuality and creativity has been a matter of debate for many years.

Some view the idea of a link between creativity and homosexuality as a myth while at the same time taking note of the impact that homosexuals have on society:

Research into possible differences in the brain that might be linked to homosexuality continues at a slow pace and remains fairly primitive.

The hypothesis that homosexuality can be associated with certain behavioral traits such as creativity remains a topic for further research.

<doc id="1253138" wikidata="Q3238302" url="?curid=1253138" title="Religion in the Inca Empire">
<text>The Inca religion was a group of beliefs and rites that were related to a mythological system evolving from pre-Inca times to Inca Empire. Faith in the &quot;Tawantinsuyu&quot; was manifested in every aspect of his life, work, festivities, ceremonies, etc. They were polytheists and there were local, regional and pan-regional divinities.

It has been noted that aspects of the Andean religion extend well beyond the border of the former Inca Empire into the lands of the Mapuches and Huilliches in southern Chile, which has raised the hypothesis whether there is a prior dissemination of Andean religion from Tiwanaku.

== Duality ==
A theme in Inca mythology is the duality of the Cosmos. The realms were separated into the upper and lower realms, the &quot;hanan pacha&quot; and the &quot;ukhu pacha&quot; and &quot;urin pacha&quot;. &quot;Hanan pacha&quot;, the upper world, consisted of the deities of the sun, moon, stars, rainbow, and lightning while &quot;ukhu pacha&quot; and &quot;urin pacha&quot; were the realms of Pachamama, the earth mother, and the ancestors and heroes of the Inca or other ayllus. &quot;Kay pacha&quot;, the realm of the outer earth, where humans resided was viewed as an intermediary realm between &quot;hanan pacha&quot; and &quot;ukhu pacha&quot;. The realms were represented by the condor (upper world), puma (outer earth) and snake (inner earth).

Asymmetrical dualism is especially important in Andean worldview. Asymmetrical dualism is the idea that reality is built by forces that are different and compromised but need each other to be complete. Additionally, one force is slightly larger or more powerful than the other, leading to a disparity between beings and forces. This disparity is the foundation of reality and which causes things to happen. Throughout Andean thought, this asymmetrical dualism can be seen in the dispersion of life force or vitality throughout the land. Camac is the life force that inhabits everything in reality. It does not distinguish between living and dead and inhabits things in different quantities. This life force permeating different places at different times gives recognition to certain places or objects. These places and objects were regarded as holding special energy and were collected under the title of &quot;wak’a&quot;.

Sacred sites or things named &quot;wak&#x27;a&quot; were spread around the Inca Empire. In Andean mythology a &quot;wak&#x27;a&quot; was a deific entity which resided in natural objects such as mountains, boulders, streams, battle fields, other meeting places, and any type of place that was connected with past Incan rulers. A &quot;wak&#x27;a&quot; could also be an inanimate object such as pottery which was believed to be a deity-carrying vessel. Spiritual leaders in a community would use prayer and offerings to communicate with a &quot;wak&#x27;a&quot; for advice or assistance. Human sacrifice was part of Incan rituals in which they usually sacrificed a child (&quot;qhapaq hucha&quot;) or a slave. The Incan people thought it was an honor to die as an offering.

Archaeological remains confirm such human sacrificial practices, according to Reinhard and Ceruti: &quot;Archaeological evidence found on distant mountain summits has established that the burial of offerings was a common practice among the Incas and that human sacrifice took place at several of the sites. The excellent preservation of the bodies and other material in the cold and dry environment of the high Andes provides revealing details about the rituals that were performed at these ceremonial complexes.&quot;

== Deities ==
Inca deities occupied the three realms:
*&quot;hanan pacha&quot;, the celestial realm in the sky.
*&quot;ukhu pacha&quot;, the inner earth realm.
*&quot;kay pacha&quot;, the outer earth realm, where humans live.

=== Deities of the official pantheon ===
*Viracocha: He was typically personified as a human male, and known as the creator of humanity and everything else in the world. In Inca Water Worship and Religion, it states, &quot;He created humanity on an island in Lake Titicaca on the border between modern Peru and Bolivia and taught people how to live, assigning them tribal dress and customs and determining where they should live.&quot; After this occurred, Viracocha gave control over humanity to lower gods then disappeared. When the Spaniards came to the Inca territory, the Inca thought they were god like because of their similarities in appearance with Viracocha. Viracocha is often depicted as one of a triad of gods with Inti and Inti-Illapa. Not to be confused as a trinity (as later Christians would do), the three gods had multiple, overlapping personalities. There does not seem to be any major ceremonies devoted to him as well, as a small priesthood and only a few shrines dedicated to him.
* Inti: Inti was one of the most important gods to the Inca people and known as the sun god. He is typically viewed as a boy from the Inca society and was also known as a golden disk with fire-like rays coming and a face in the middle. The image of Inti as a boy with sun rays protruding from his head is reflected in the principal idol of Inti that was created by Pachakuti. Named Punchao, this idol bridged the expanse between the Sun and humanity, as Inca rulers’ vital organs were burned, and the ash stored inside the statue. The Inca believed the sun was a key element for agriculture by protecting and helping with the growth of their crops. The temple dedicated to Inti was the Coricancha (a.k.a. The Golden Enclosure), which was one of the most important temples for the Inca people. Inside Coricancha was a miniature field of corn and the corn was made out of gold. Annually, the emperor would &quot;farm&quot; this as a tradition. Viracocha did not start out as the top deity in Inca religion, Inti was the first original and most powerful god. The transition from Inti to Virachocha has a couple of theories including: 1. The Inca society and people developed intellectually and started to question Inti&#x27;s power. They questioned why an all-powerful god did the same thing every day. 2. The society moved forward and they started going more towards Henotheism. Since Viracocha was seen as a human, they saw this as being more powerful.
* Illapa (Inti-Illapa): The name of this god means thunder and controls things like weather, rain, and lightning. The Inca valued this god because Illapa was in control of the weather and the growth of their crops. Many of the Inca society saw the image of this deity as a man wearing a sling. Every time that Illapa used the sling, it would create the thunder heard by the Inca people.
* Kon(Wakon): The Inca rain god extended beyond its agricultural significance to encompass its role in spiritual beliefs and rituals. This god was perceived as a divine entity capable of both providing life-giving rains and unleashing destructive floods, highlighting the complex relationship between the Inca people and the forces of nature. Integrated into broader cosmological beliefs, reflecting the interconnectedness of water, life, and spirituality in Inca culture
* Mamaquilla (Kilyamama): The name of this god in the Inca language can be translated into Mother Moon. The Coya, or Incan queen was considered to be the daughter of Mamaquilla and leader of moon worship. All of the Inca society recognized this deity as female who was also seen as a silver disk with a face in the middle. She was the wife of the deity Inti and was also in control of calendars. This god was in charge of calendars because of the moon&#x27;s cycle which the Inca could track. All the temples that worshiped Mamaquilla were worked on by priestesses.
* Pachamama: The name of this god translates to Earth Mother and is known as a female among the Inca society. The Inca saw her as a protector of their crops/fields and a god of fertility to help their crops grow. Pachamama embodies a gendered understanding of nature, representing both a maternal nurturing force and a powerful deity. Pachamama is portrayed as a source of fertility and abundance in Bolivian indigenous belief systems, influencing agricultural practices and environmental administration. Pachamama embodies the interconnectedness of life and nature, serving as a central figure in rituals and ceremonies that honor the earth and its resources.
* Mama Cocha: The meaning of this god&#x27;s name from the Inca language is Mother of Lakes and is widely known as a female. The job of this deity is to keep the world strong and provide sources of water.
* Stellar Deities: These are deities formed using constellations or other cosmology features and are mostly believed to be of animals or activities. In the book &quot;Inca Water Worship and Religion&quot;, an example would be &quot;Urcuchillay, which is known to western astronomers as Lira, [who] was thought to protect llamas and alpacas.&quot; Another important stellar deity was Qollqa (Pleiades). This constellation was honored because she was the mother of all other stellar deities. When the constellation appeared after not being visible for 37 days, the start of the agricultural year was marked.
* Huacas: Anything, including people, places, and objects, in the world that the Inca believed had a supernatural spirit, were called Huacas. The size of the Huaca determined how much power it had. For example, mountains were considered some of the more powerful Huacas. The Inca worshiped and cared for them similar to the other deities.

===Household gods===

In addition to the communally worshiped deities, Incan families sometimes worshiped household gods via their representation as miniature figurines most commonly referred to as or . were often natural or carved stone objects that resembled crops or livestock, such as for maize, for potatoes and for llamas.

==Origin==
The Incas had an immense number of origin stories that historians and scholars have trouble deciphering and sorting out. These stories often contradict themselves, seeming to retell the story at a later point to include information and events that had occurred. Many of the origin stories of the Incas had life begin at Lake Titicaca. The story has the Creator god Wiraqocha Pachayachachic form giants to see if humans would work well at that size. When he found that they did not, he made them of his own size. These humans were hubristic and greedy, and thus were turned to stone or other forms and some were engulfed by the stone or sea. The Creator then summoned a great flood to destroy the land and all life on it except for three men, who would later help create humans again. At a later point at Lake Titicaca, the Creator made the sun, moon, and stars. The moon shone brighter than the sun, and being filled with jealousy, the sun threw ashes in her face to dim her shine. The Creator then spread out with two servants to call forth the people of every nation, from every mountain, crevice, cave and lake before walking over the water into the west.

The origin stories of the Incas reflect an attitude of change, where the past could be changed to better situate the present. This allowed for the possibility of new peoples and lands being discovered having been present from the very beginning. The origins of the Incas however do not represent the origin stories of other pre-Incan Andean peoples. There are vastly more versions and stories that predate and play into the Incan stories. Inca origin and religion draws from many local and ancestral traditions. The official tradition of the Inca Empire was the cult of the Sun, but the Incas allowed locals to worship their existing beings. Many people thought that their founding ancestor arose from an exact spot, a paqarisqa. These locals worshiped their gods through pilgrimages, offerings, and other rites that allowed them to keep true to tradition while still providing necessary sacrifices and offerings to the Sun god.

==Religious expansion==
Religious traditions in the Andes tended to vary among different ayllus. While the Inca generally allowed or even incorporated local deities and heroes of the ayllus they conquered, they did bring their gods to those peoples by incorporating them in law such as required sacrifice. The Inca attempted to combine their deities with conquered ones in ways that raised the status of their own. One example of this is Pachamama, the goddess of Earth, who was worshiped long before the rise of the Inca. In the Inca mythology Pachamama having been integrated was placed below the Moon who the Inca believed ruled over all female gods.

==Divination==
The Incas also used divination. Divination was used to inform people in the city of social events, predict battle outcomes, and ask for metaphysical intervention.

Divination was essential before taking any action. Nearly every religious rite was accompanied by sacrifices. These were usually maize beer, food or llamas, but were occasionally of virgins or children.

Divination was an important part of Inca religion, as reflected in the following quote:
== Mummification ==
Rulers in Peru, such as the Inca ruler Huayna Capac, were often mummified upon the time of their death, allowing for their bodies to be worshipped within the palaces. These worshipping events were intercepted by the Spaniards under Polo de Ondegardo, who was newly appointed as Corregidor (Chief Magistrate) of Cuzco in 1559, when it was under Spanish control. Ondegardo conducted a massive effort to prevent the Inca from committing their “idolatrous sins”, mainly by locating the mummified bodies of late Inca kings and sending them to the viceroy in Lima. They remained in a hospital for around 80 years before their whereabouts became unknown. The Inca used to mummify their kings and several times a year they would be aligned in accordance to when they chronologically ruled in Cuzco&#x27;s plaza for the public to pay their respects. In the other parts of the year, the mummies were returned to the Cuzco palaces and were worshipped privately by groups of visitors. Francisco Pizarro stated that “It was customary for the dead to visit one another, and they held great dances and debaucheries, and sometimes the dead went to the house of the living, and sometimes the living came to the house of the dead”. The kings were thought to have been able to speak back to the worshippers through the use of oracles, and even gave advice to the protection and ruling of the land. The ruling Inca was expected to seek advice from the mummies of his ancestors for important issues. Not all Inca mummies were glorified, however, as in one case Topa Inca Yupanqui&#x27;s mummified body was torched and his bloodline all killed as they sided with Huascar in the civil war.

Inca mummies were seen as possessing agency, not really alive nor dead, more of an animated death. Terence D&#x27;Altroy said that, “royal mummies ate, drank, visited one another, sat at council, and judged weighty questions.” Mummies participated in ceremonial roles that allowed them to be consulted as advisors in times of distress. Originally kept on royal estates, the descendants eventually thought that by staying in his own house, a mummy could be better served and watched over. The mummies played such an important role in politics that there are instances of mummies being married. One such story is that Washkar had his mother marry his father&#x27;s mummy in order for him to receive a legitimate ruling claim.

Upon the arrival of the Spanish, the Inca started to hide the bodies of the kings and become more secretive with their worship, as stated by Juan de Betanzos. After being appointed, Polo do Ondegardo and his men found most of the mummified kings and took their bodies along with other ritualistic items such as their , or their statues. A popular thought is that Ondegardo had the bodies buried in or around Cuzco in secret so that they would not be uncovered and worshipped again. Garcilaso de la Vega visited Ondegardo&#x27;s house and was shown an assembly of embalmed kings and attested to the degree of their preservation: “The bodies were perfectly preserved without the loss of hair of the head or brow or an eyelash. They were dressed as if they had been in life, with Ilautus (royal headbands) on their heads... their hands were crossed across their breast.”. The mummies were afterwards sent to the viceroy for him to see them and then afterwards they were brought back to Cuzco and thought to be secretly buried. The viceroy stored the mummies in the Hospital of San Andrés in Lima because he was “a major benefactor of it”. Since the hospital was solely for the Spanish residents, they were likely on display for the citizens to view, away from the natives.

==In Cusco==

Because of their immediate defeat at the hands of the Spanish, much information surrounding Incan religion has been lost. Many historians rely on the religious customs of conquered Incan subjects to gather information about Incan beliefs. The Incans adopted most if not all of their religious beliefs from three main groups that lived around Peru. These groups were the Wari, the Chavin and the Nazca. With the combination of all three of these ancestral societies’ religions, the Incas were able to create a religious system that dominated almost every aspect of life in the empire.

The Incas were profoundly religious, and so it makes sense that their religious structure was very complicated. The religion was centralized in the capital city of Cusco. Within Cusco, a highly complicated and organized calendar controlled the state religion&#x27;s festivals and holy days. This calendar was responsible for almost all of the religious ceremonies that took place throughout the empire. Within the city of Cusco, there were also over three hundred and twenty eight huacas or sacred objects. Huacas were located throughout the empire with most of them happening to be around the capital city. Within the capital city there was also a quipa. The quipa described all the sacred places and how they are to be used during ceremonies and sacrifices. Each sacred place or huaca was organized into forty-one different directions called ceques. These ceques started from the central temple of the Sun called Coricancha or &quot;the golden enclosure&quot;.

There were ten groups of Incan nobility that were in charge of being priests within the city of Cuzco. These ten groups of nobility were called panacas. The panacas had a vital role to Incan society in Cusco because they were in charge of worship for the deities. All of the religious aspects that took place around the city were organized and arranged by this special group of nobility. The members of these ten groups were said to have a first royal ancestor that had conquered the valley. The panacas were decided through mother&#x27;s rank, fraternal succession, choice, and the success and honor of the individual on the battlefield. These ten groups were then divided into two smaller groups, one representing Hanan who lived north of the valley river and also Hurin who lived south of the valley river. The Hanan and Hurin each consisted of five groups of nobility. It is known that the first group of each of the Panacas dedicated all their sacrifices to the sun. The remaining four were in charge of dedicating their sacrifices to Moon, Thunder, Virachoa, and the Earth. These groups of nobility made up the uppermost tier of society, and they were highly revered and respected throughout the empire.

These fives gods or entities that received the majority of sacrifices in Cusco represent the most vital aspects of Incan life. The Sun God represented the institutional organization of the society because everything in Incan life revolved around the Sun. Virachoa is also known as Apu Qun Tiqsi Wiraqutra and is considered the creator of civilization. He is one of the most, if not the most, powerful gods in Incan mythology. The sacrifices to Virachoa represent how much the Incans relied on outside forces to explain events in their daily lives. The sacrifices to Thunder represent the handling of transitions in life and society. The sacrifices to Earth and Moon show the fertility of the Earth and nature. All ten groups of nobilities had the responsibility to explain and account for all the occurrences of the natural world in and outside of the Incan empire.

==Festivals==
The Inca calendar had 12 months of 30 days, with each month having its own festival, and a five-day feast at the end, before the new year began. The Incan year started in December, and began with Qhapaq Raymi, the magnificent festival.

The Qhapaq Raymi was the first and biggest festival of the year. During this festival, Inca boys went through their puberty rites as they entered adulthood. Additionally, public events of drinking, dancing, and eating llama blood cakes occurred to venerate the Sun god.

Inti Raymi, perhaps the second most important festival, occurred during the month with June&#x27;s solstice. Like the Qhapag Raymi, the Inti Raymi focused on celebrating the Sun god, with day-long chanting that escalated at noon and diminished till sunset. The festival lasted eight or nine days and was filled with offerings of &quot;chicha&quot;, coca, and other items that venerated the Sun god. At the end of the festival, the Inca ruler was the first to plow the earth, signaling the beginning of the plowing season.

In the month of Qoya Raymi the Situa, a ceremony of purification, was performed that started in Cuzco and expanded out in the four directions. Performed in the rainy season, due to a higher number of illnesses, residents of Cuzco beat each other with torches and shook clothing outside to rid themselves of disease. Then four groups of 100 people left with sacrificial ashes along the four roads out of Cuzco, the roads of Kollasuyu, Chinchaysuyu, Antisuyu, and Cuntisuyu. The runners took the ashes along these roads and passed them off to people of lesser social status who continued the carrying of the burden. When they reached a designated area, they would bathe in a river, ridding Cuzco and its peoples of impurities.

<text>Hildegard ( – 30 April 783) was a Frankish queen and the wife of Charlemagne from until her death. Hildegard was a noblewoman of Frankish and Alemannian heritage. Through eleven years of marriage with Charlemagne, Hildegard helped share in his rule as well as having nine children with him, including the kings Charles the Younger and Pepin of Italy and the emperor Louis the Pious. 
==Life==
Hildegard was the daughter of the Frankish count Gerold and his wife, the Alemannian noblewoman Imma. Thegan of Trier, a ninth-century biographer of Hildegard&#x27;s son Louis emphasizes her Alemannian heritage and descent from duke Gotfrid through her mother, indicating that Imma was of higher status than Gerold. Hildegard was likely born in 757 or 758.

Gerold held lands in the vicinity of the Middle Rhine under the Frankish king Carloman I. Carloman died on 4 December 771 and his brother king Charlemagne sought to bring Carloman&#x27;s lands under his rule. Charlemagne arranged to marry Hildegard and gain Gerold&#x27;s support. Hildegard married Charlemagne shortly after Carloman&#x27;s death, certainly before 30 April 772. She was thirteen or fourteen years old at the time of the marriage. By marrying Hildegard, Charlemagne ended his marriage to a daughter of the Lombard king Desiderius. Charlemagne had also had a previous relationship (perhaps a marriage) with the Frankish noblewoman Himiltrude, and had a son with her named Pepin. As queen, Hildegard would have been responsible for administering the royal household and estates. She also joined her husband as the co-signer of charters, including grants of patronage to monasteries.

Charlemagne took Hildegard to the Frankish royal palace at Thionville, where they stayed for two months before he set off on a campaign in Saxony. At the end of the campaigning season, Charlemagne returned to Thionville, and during this period the couple&#x27;s son Charles was born. At Thionville, Charlemagne received an emissary from Pope Adrian I who was seeking his help against Desiderius. Charlemagne, heeding the Pope&#x27;s call for aid, invaded Lombardy in late 773 and besieged the Lombard capital of Pavia. In early 774, Charlemagne sent for Hildegard to travel to the Frankish camp at Pavia with Pippin and Charles. Hildegard was heavily pregnant, and gave birth to a daughter named Adelhaid during the siege. They sent the baby back north to Francia for safety, but she died on the way. By June, Charlemagne conquered the city, deposed Desiderius and his wife Ansa, and named himself king of the Lombards. Charlemagne and Hildegard likely went through a ritual installation as the new king and queen in Pavia (though no direct source exists), and a charter issued in Lombardy in July was a grant of Lombard land to the Abbey of St. Martin made in both of their names.

The royal family returned to Francia later in the summer of 774. The next year, as Charlemagne campaigned in Saxony, Hildegard gave birth to their daughter Rotrude. Their next child was Carloman, born in 777. In 778, Hildegard traveled with Charlemagne to Chasseneuil-du-Poitou, where he was amassing his army for a campaign in Spain. Hildegard was pregnant when they arrived, and gave birth to twin boys, Louis and Lothair, while Charlemagne was on campaign. Lothair died in 780 at the age of two, the same year Hildegard gave birth to another daughter, Bertha.

In 781, Charlemagne and Hildegard traveled to Rome with Louis, Carloman, and their daughters at Pope Adrian&#x27;s request. Carloman was four years old, but his parents had delayed his baptism so that the Pope could perform it. Carloman was baptized, and Adrian then crowned him as king of the Lombards (later styled king of Italy) and Louis as king of Aquitaine. As part of Carloman&#x27;s baptism, he was renamed Pepin, now sharing a name with his half-brother. The two new kings, still young children, were sent to their new kingdoms to be raised by regents and advisors in their own courts. On this trip to Italy, Hildegard also gave birth to her third daughter, Gisela, and she was baptized in Milan. Around this time, Hildegard and Charlemagne jointly commissioned the Godescalc Evangelistary, a surviving illuminated manuscript of the Gospels and exemplary piece of Carolingian Renaissance art.

Hildegard had her final pregnancy in 782–783, and she and Charlemagne stayed in the palace at Thionville during that winter. Hildegard gave birth to another daughter in late April, but died shortly after on 30 April 783, possibly due to complications from the birth. The baby was named in her mother&#x27;s honor, but also died less than two months later. Hildegard was buried at the Abbey of Saint-Arnould at Metz, and Charlemagne arranged for her tomb to be perpetually lit and for daily masses to be said there, as well as commissioning an epitaph in her honor from his courtier Paul the Deacon.

==Children==
In her marriage to Charlemagne, Hildegard had nine children:

*Charles the Younger (–811), Duke of Maine and king under Charlemagne
*Adalhaid (773/4–774), born while her parents were on campaign in Italy. She was sent back to Francia, but died before reaching Lyons.
*Rotrude (or Hruodrud) (–810)
*Carloman, renamed Pepin (777–810), King of Italy
*Louis (778–840), King of Aquitaine and Emperor
*Lothair (778–779/780), twin of Louis, he died in infancy
*Bertha (779/780–826)
*Gisela (b. 782)
*Hildegard (782–783)

Louis and Pepin both married and had children. Rotrude had been betrothed to Emperor Constantine VI, but this betrothal was ended. None of Hildegard&#x27;s daughters married, though several had children with unmarried partners: Bertha had two sons, Nithard and Hartnid with Charlemagne&#x27;s courtier Angilbert; and Rotrude had a son named Louis possibly with Count Rorgon.

<text>A teleseism is a tremor caused by an earthquake that is very far away (from the Ancient Greek τῆλε) from where it is recorded. According to the USGS, the term &quot;teleseismic&quot; refers to earthquakes that occur more than 1000 km from the measurement site. Small teleseismic events register only on sensitive seismometers in low background noise locations. In general, seismic waves from earthquakes of magnitude 5.0 and up can be recorded almost anywhere in the world with modern seismic instrumentation.

<doc id="1253157" wikidata="Q2705947" url="?curid=1253157" title="Dickite">
<text>Dickite () is a phyllosilicate clay mineral named after the metallurgical chemist Allan Brugh Dick, who first described it. It is chemically composed of 20.90% aluminium, 21.76% silicon, 1.56% hydrogen and 55.78% oxygen. It has the same composition as kaolinite, nacrite, and halloysite, but with a different crystal structure (polymorph). Dickite sometimes contains impurities such as titanium, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium.

Dickite occurs with other clays and requires x-ray diffraction for its positive identification. Dickite is an important alteration indicator in hydrothermal systems as well as occurring in soils and shales.

Dickite&#x27;s type location is in Pant-y-Gaseg, Amlwch, Isle of Anglesey, Wales, United Kingdom, where it was first described in 1888. Dickite appears in locations with similar qualities and is found in China, Jamaica, France, Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Italy, Belgium and Canada.

==History==
In 1888, Allan Brugh Dick (1833–1926), a Scottish metallurgical chemist, was on the island of Anglesey to conduct research on kaolin. He performed various experiments describing the clay mineral. It was not until 1931 that Clarence S. Ross and Paul F. Kerr looked closer at the mineral and concluded that it was different from the known minerals of kaolinite and nacrite. They named it after the first person to describe the mineral.

==Composition==
 is the chemical formula of dickite. The calculated percent abundances are very close when compared to other kaolin minerals.

Chemical composition of dickite:
* 46.54%
* 39.50%
* 13.96%

Dickite and other kaolin minerals are commonly developed by weathering of feldspars and muscovite. Through its evolution, dickite, a phyllosilicate mineral, maintains the aluminium and silicon elements influencing the formation of hexagonal sheets common to clay minerals.

The problem of mistaken identity arises when comparing dickite to other kaolin minerals due to the fact that kaolinite, dickite, and nacrite all have the same formula but different molecular structures. The only way to determine the true identity of the mineral is through powder x-ray diffraction and optical means.

==Geologic occurrence==
Dickite was first discovered in Almwch, Island of Anglesey, Wales, UK. Dickite is scattered across Wales forming occurrences in vein assemblages and as a rock-forming mineral. This area and others where dickite can be found all share similar characteristics. Pockets in phylloid algal limestones, in interstices of biocalcarenites and sandstone are a suitable environment for dickite. Very low pressure and high temperatures are the ideal environment for the formation of dickite. The more perfected crystallization of dickite occurs in porous algal limestones in the form of a white powder. The more disordered dickites can be found in less porous rocks.

Another occurrence spot, as indicated by Brindley and Porter of the American Mineralogists journal, is the Northerly dickite-bearing zone in Jamaica. The dickite in this zone ranges from indurate breccias containing cream to pinkish and purplish fragments composed largely of dickite with subordinate anatase set in a matrix of greenish dickite, to discrete veins and surface coatings of white, cream and translucent dickite. It appears that dickite in the northerly zone were formed by hot ascending waters from an uncertain origin.

Dickite is found worldwide in locations such as Ouray, Colorado, US; San Juanito, Chihuahua, Mexico, in a silicified zone among the rhyolite area; and in St. George, Utah, US, where the mineral is thought to be associated with volcanic rock. An extensive study was done on dickite pertaining to its location in Pennsylvanian limestones of southeastern Kansas, US.

In the dickite deposits of southeast Kansas the distribution is dependent on the following: the stratigraphic alternation of limestones and shales, westward regional dip, thick deposits of highly porous algal limestones, and igneous intrusions. It was found that groundwaters substantially heated along with magmatic waters which made its way up-dip and through the intrusions in the conduit-like algal mounds which allowed the dickite to be deposited in this area and it might be conclusive to say that this trend follows elsewhere in other locations around the world.

==Physical properties==
Dickite takes on the appearance of a white, brown earthy color and is often found embedded in many other minerals such as quartz.

Dickite has perfect cleavage in the (001) direction. Its color varies from blue, gray, white to colorless. It usually has a dull clay-like texture. Its hardness on the Mohs scale is 1.5–2, basically between talc and gypsum. This is attributed to its loose chemical bonds. It is held with hydrogen bonds, which are otherwise weak. It leaves a white streak and it has a pearly luster. It has a density of 2.6. Dickite is biaxial, its birefringence is between 0.0050–0.0090, its surface relief is low and it has no dispersion. The plane of the optical axis is normal to the plane of symmetry and inclined 160, rear to the normal to (0,0,1).

The atomic structure of dickite, being very similar to that of kaolinite and other kaolin type minerals, has a very specific arrangement that differs slightly enough to set its physical appearance and other physical properties apart from that of its family members kaolinite and nacrite. In a comparison of the family of minerals through experiments examined by Ross and Kerr the similarities between them are clearly evident and can, depending on the samples, be indistinguishable by optical means.

The hexagonal structure and the stacking of the atoms influence the physical properties in many ways including the color, hardness, cleavage, density, and luster. Another important factor in influencing physical properties of minerals is the presence of bonding between atoms. Within dickite there exists dominant O-H bonding, a type of strong ionic bonding.

==Structure==
Dickite has a monoclinic crystal system and its crystal class is domatic (m). This crystal system contains two non-equal axes (a and b) that are perpendicular to each other and a third axis (c) that is inclined with respect to the a axis. The a and c axes lie in a plane. Dickite involves an interlayer bonding with at least 3 identifiable bonds: an ionic type interaction due to net unbalanced charges on the layers, Van der Waals forces between layers and hydrogen bonds between oxygen atoms on the surface of one layer and hydroxyl groups on the opposing surface. A hydrogen bond, as the term is used here, involves a long range interaction between hydrogen of a hydroxyl group coordinated to a cation and an oxygen atom coordinated to another cation. The reaction is predominantly electrostatic; hence an ionic bonding model is appropriate. Its axial ratio is a=0.576, b=1, c=1.6135.

The hexagonal network of Si-O tetrahedra along with the superimposed layer of Al-O, OH octahedra make up the kaolin layer found in dickite. Dickite is composed of regular sequences of one, two and six kaolin layers. Analysis of the dickite structure reveals the space group to be C4s-Cc. The a and c axis both lie on the glide plane of symmetry. Dickite&#x27;s structure is made up of a shared layer of corner-sharing tetrahedra filled by a plane of oxygens and hydroxyls along with a sheet of edge-sharing octahedra with every third site left empty.

An experiment was conducted using a pseudo-hexagonal crystal of dickite to determine the unit cell information and the layers that exist within dickite. It was found that there are six layers within the kaolin layer within dickite. This is evidenced in the following findings. There is an oxygen atom from the all oxygen layer that lies at the center. The atoms of the O layer, the Si layer and the O, (OH) layer are situated for the ideal kaolin layer.

X-ray experiments were performed by C. J. Ksanda and Tom F. W. Barth and it was concluded that dickite is composed of tiny layers of cations and anions which are parallel to the a-b plane stacked on top of one another which they found to be exactly as Gruner had described. It was also concluded that the two dimensional arrangement of some of the atoms are not as Gruner described.
