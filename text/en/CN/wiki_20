<text>David Bellion (born 27 November 1982) is a French former professional footballer who played as a striker. His previous clubs include Cannes, Sunderland, Manchester United, West Ham United, Nice, Bordeaux and Red Star.

==Club career==
===Cannes===
Bellion was born in Sèvres, Hauts-de-Seine, to a Senegalese father and French mother. He started his career at Cannes at the age of 14, and earned a move to English club Sunderland in the summer of 2001. In his youth, he was a talented athlete, competing in the 2001 National Indoor Youth Championships, where he won the 60 metres.

===Sunderland===
Bellion signed for Premier League club Sunderland in July 2001. He made his debut at Fulham in August 2001, coming on as a substitute. His first senior goal was against Aston Villa at the Stadium of Light which gave Sunderland a 1–0 win in September 2002. It was his only Premier League goal for Sunderland. Following the goal, Bellion became a first-team regular at Sunderland, although he was unable to save them from relegation with the third-lowest Premier League points tally ever. During the 2002–03 season, Sunderland offered a new contract, but he turned it down as he wanted to leave the club. He agreed a move to Manchester United in July 2003, although the transfer was completed amid &quot;tapping up&quot; allegations that were resolved by Sunderland, receiving a compensation payment of £2 million, rising to £3 million depending on appearances, in an out-of-court agreement.

===Manchester United===
Bellion scored on his Manchester United debut against Celtic on the club&#x27;s pre-season American tour. His first competitive goal came at Leeds United in the League Cup, and he scored two goals in the 2003–04 season, against Everton and Tottenham Hotspur, both at Old Trafford. During the season, he made his Champions League debut when he came on as a substitute in the 5–0 win over Panathinaikos in the group stage.

Despite being compared to Thierry Henry and early-season goals against Norwich City and Bolton Wanderers, the 2004–05 campaign proved frustrating for Bellion as he found himself increasingly frozen out of the first-team squad. His season was curtailed in early May, when he suffered a fractured fibula against Charlton Athletic Reserves. During 2004–05, Bellion scored his first Champions League goal (not including qualifiers) in a 6–2 win over Fenerbahçe and was involved in the squad for the FA Community Shield in a 3–1 loss against Arsenal.

Bellion spent time on loan at West Ham United at the beginning of the 2005–06 season. He scored on his debut, a League Cup win over Sheffield Wednesday on 20 September 2005. After the match, manager Alan Pardew praised Bellion, believing he could make an impact at the club. However, he never flourished and his first-team opportunities were limited and he went on to make just ten appearances for the club, mostly as a substitute.

===Nice===
He returned to France on 9 January 2006, joining Nice on loan until the end of the season, a move that was later made permanent in June 2006. Speaking of his move, Bellion said it was good to be home in France, and he settled quickly at the club. Shortly after his move, Bellion made his debut, coming on as a substitute and receiving a yellow card, in a 0–0 draw against Nantes. Bellion scored in the quarter-final of Coupe de la Ligue in a 2–1 win over Bordeaux on 17 January 2006. The club advanced to the semi-final and then progressed to the final but lost against Nancy on 22 April 2006. On 14 February 2006, he scored his first goal, the only goal in the match, against Saint-Étienne. Toward the end of the season, he scored three goals in three matches against Rennes, Ajaccio and Metz. At the end of the season, Bellion signed a permanent deal with the club. After finally leaving Manchester United, Bellion said he had no hard feelings toward the club, and also said his experience in English football was &quot;frustrating&quot;.

In his first permanent season at Nice, Bellion&#x27;s form dropped. He made several critical errors and misjudgements, and scored eight goals. Following an injury on 23 December 2006, in a 2–1 loss against Lens, it was announced that Bellion would be out for three weeks. Soon after, he had another injury on his right fibula. He completed his recovery on 9 March 2007 after three months on the sidelines. Despite this, Bellion finished his first season with eight goals, making him the club&#x27;s joint top scorer in the league along with Bakari Koné.

===Bordeaux===
Bellion joined Bordeaux on 15 July 2007, signing a four-year deal for a fee rumoured to total €4.5 million. He was signed as a replacement for Jean-Claude Darcheville. He marked his first match by scoring the only goal in a 1–0 win over Lens. Up until the second half of the season, he was in impressive form, scoring eight goals in twelve matches. However, in the second half, he only scored four goals. The club would end up in second place behind Lyon, who won their seventh title. Despite failing to win the league and his faltering form in the latter half, Bellion said it was his best season.

The following 2008–09 season, Bellion became third-choice striker behind Marouane Chamakh and Fernando Cavenaghi, limiting his first-team opportunities. He managed to score four goals this season while mostly playing off the bench. In the UEFA Cup third round against Galatasaray, he scored past Morgan De Sanctis in just eleven seconds, the fastest goal in the history of the UEFA Cup, but Bordeaux lost 4–3. Towards the end of the season, the club would win not only the Coupe de la Ligue but also the league.

At the start of the 2009–10 season, Bellion signed a three-year contract with the club, keeping him there until 2014. He did not regret this, when asked by &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; after the season ended whether he regretted signing a contract in the interview. Bellion spoken out of his first team, saying he had become more increasingly frustrated at the club, due to lack of regular football. However, in three seasons, Bellion was barely used in the first team and stayed on the substitutes bench, even upon his return on loan from Nice and also his own injury concerns. In an interview with Goal.com, Bellion claims that he was ignored by the team&#x27;s management.

In December 2010, Bellion returned to Nice on loan until the end of the season, to gain first-team experience. Shortly after moving, he believed the move would relaunch his career. However, his time at Nice was &#x27;forgettable&#x27;, due to his lack of goals, goals that he had produced four years ago, and much to the fans&#x27; dismay and also his own injury concerns, like being injured in a taxi for example. He departed back to Bordeaux at the end of the season.

Bellion scored his first goal in two years since September 2010 in the Europa League in a 1–0 win over Marítimo on 8 November 2012. After the match, Bellion spoke of his first goal as &quot;running a rhythm&quot; to score. He scored again, in the second round of Coupe de France, in a 2–1 win to Moulins. A few weeks later, Bellion scored his first league in over four years, in a 2–0 win against Valenciennes. After the match, Bellion described his first goal in over a year as &quot;mini relief and a small reward&quot;. However, towards the end of the season, Bellion was soon less included, especially missing out from the squad, when the club won the Coupe de France.

In June 2013, Bellion was linked with a move to the United States, where he trained with the New York Cosmos on trial. Eventually, his trial with them ended after he rejected a move, and he travelled back to Bordeaux.

===Red Star===
In July 2014, after his contract with Bordeaux expired, Bellion joined Championnat National club Red Star. He registered a consolation goal on his first appearance on 8 August 2014 to Amiens, as Red Star were defeated 3–1. Bellion&#x27;s goals helped Red Star win the league and gain promotion to Ligue 2 after beating Istres with a 4–0 victory at home on 8 May 2015. After ending his playing career in 2016, Bellion remained with the club after being appointed their creative director, building links between the club and the world of culture and the arts.

<text>Max Jean (born 27 July 1943) is a French former racing driver who won the Formule France championship in 1968. In addition to numerous Formula Two and Formula Three entries, Jean participated in one Formula One Grand Prix, driving a March for Frank Williams Racing Cars in his home race on 4 July 1971. He scored no championship points.

==Career summary==
Max Jean was born in Marseille. Early in his career, his name was incorrectly listed as &quot;Jean Max&quot; on an entry form and he was often known by this name subsequently. He was Formule France champion in 1968 – driving for the works GRAC team, and taking 11 victories from the series&#x27; 17 events – in a field that included future two-time 24 Hours of Le Mans race winner Gérard Larrousse and future Formula One driver Jean-Pierre Jarier. His success encouraged Ecurie GRAC to construct a Formula Three car for him to run in 1969, but results were meager. He finished tenth at the Pau round and seventh in Dijon, but these were his only two race finishes in the French championship and he frequently failed to qualify for races.

In 1970 he parted company from GRAC and secured funding from the lubricants manufacturer Motul to run a works-supported Tecno car. At the opening race of the season, in Nogaro, he finished in second position. He repeated this placing in the fourth and fifth rounds of the championship at Linas-Montlhéry and Magny-Cours. However, apart from a sixth placed finish in round eight at Dijon and ninth on aggregate at the second visit to Nogaro, he did not reach the finishing flag in any of his other appearances, having suffered from a variety of mechanical failures. Nevertheless, despite his disappointing performances in Formula Three, he was drafted into the works Tecno team for Formula Two races at Paul Ricard in France and Tulln-Langenlebarn in Austria, where he finished in seventh and 13th places, respectively.

In 1971 Jean took his Motul sponsorship to the independent Frank Williams Racing Cars team, and he drove their March 712M Formula Two car for them at Rouen and Pau. However, on both occasions he failed to finish. He also failed to qualify the car for the Monza Lottery race in June. His involvement with the Williams team gave Jean the opportunity to participate in his home Formula One event that year: the 1971 French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard in July. As Williams had upgraded their lead driver, Jean&#x27;s compatriot Henri Pescarolo, to a 1971-model March 711 car the team&#x27;s 1970-specification March 701 was available. Jean qualified the 701 in 23rd place in the 24 car field, but started in 22nd position following the withdrawal of March works driver Nanni Galli. During the race Jean&#x27;s car suffered from a malfunctioning gearbox and he finished the race unclassified and last, nine laps behind the winner.

After 1971 Jean&#x27;s racing activities reduced. In 1972 he took part in two Formula Two races for the Rondel Racing team, who also benefitted from Motul sponsorship. He failed to qualify the team&#x27;s Brabham BT38 for the Pau round, and finished in 13th position in August&#x27;s race at Albi. In 1973 Jean re-entered the French Formula Three championship, driving an Automobiles Martini car for the ORECA team. Following a season of low points and no points finishes and retirements, at the end of the year Motul cut their sponsorship and Jean retired.

Following the conclusion of his racing career, Max Jean built a successful family business in transport.

<text>William Emerson Brock (March 14, 1869August 5, 1950) was a Democratic United States Senator from Tennessee from 1929 to 1931.

==Life and career==
Brock was born in Davie County, North Carolina, the son of Mary Ann (Howell) and Richard Emerson Brock. He attended public school and engaged in agricultural pursuits until 1894. He then moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and became a clerk in a general store.

From 1896 until 1901 he worked as a tobacco salesman. In 1909 he moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee. In Chattanooga, Brock became involved in candy manufacturing, and also had involvements in insurance and banking interests. He became a trustee of the former University of Chattanooga, now the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Emory and Henry University, and also Martha Washington College.

On September 2, 1929, the Governor of Tennessee, Henry Hollis Horton, appointed Brock to the vacancy in the U.S. Senate caused by the death of Lawrence D. Tyson; Horton had first offered the appointment to former Senator Luke Lea, who declined. On November 4, 1930, Brock was elected to the balance of this term. He did not run for the full six-year term that was on the ballot at the same time, and his service as a U.S. senator ended on March 3, 1931. He was succeeded by Cordell Hull.

After leaving the Senate, Brock returned to his Chattanooga candy manufacturing business and remained involved in its operation until his death in 1950. He was buried at Forest Hills Cemetery in Chattanooga.

Brock&#x27;s grandson, Bill Brock, was a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives and a U.S. senator from Tennessee.

<doc id="1235076" wikidata="Q61507" url="?curid=1235076" title="Gerhard Marcks">
<text>Gerhard Marcks (18 February 1889 – 13 November 1981) was a German artist, known primarily as a sculptor, but who is also known for his drawings, woodcuts, lithographs and ceramics.

==Early life==
Marcks was born in Berlin, where, at the age of 18, he worked as an apprentice to sculptor Richard Scheibe. In 1914, he married Maria Schmidtlein, with whom he would raise six children. During World War I, he served in the German army, which resulted in long-term health problems.

With architect Walter Gropius, German-American painter Lyonel Feininger, Scheibe and others, Marcks was a member of two art-related political groups, the Novembergruppe (November Group) and the Arbeitsrat für Kunst (Working Council for Art). He was also affiliated with the Deutscher Werkbund, of which Gropius was a founding member.

==Bauhaus master==
In 1919, when Gropius founded the Bauhaus, in Weimar, Marcks was one of the first three faculty members to be hired, along with Feininger and Johannes Itten. Specifically, Marcks was appointed the &quot;Formmeister&quot; (Form Master) of the school&#x27;s Pottery Workshop, which was located not in Weimar but in an annex to the school in nearby Dornburg. The other teacher in that workshop, its &quot;Lehrmeister&quot; (Crafts Master) was Master Potter Max Krehan, the last of a long line of potters, whose workshop was in Dornburg. Krehan taught the students to throw pots on the wheel, to trim and glaze them, and to fire the kiln. Marcks, in addition to duties in Weimar, taught the history of the practice, encouraged experimentation, and sometimes decorated pots.

Earlier, Marcks had made the models for a series of animal sculptures, which were reproduced in China by a porcelain factory. His interest in animal forms is reflected in the work he made for his first Bauhaus portfolio (&quot;Neue Europaeische Graphik I&quot;), such as &quot;Die Katzen&quot; (&quot;The Cats&quot;) and &quot;Die Eule&quot; (&quot;The Owl&quot;), both woodcuts. In time, his focus shifted to the human figure, and it was this subject that continued to hold his attention for the rest of his life.

==Further career==
In September 1925, the Bauhaus was relocated to Dessau, and its pottery workshop was discontinued. Marcks moved instead to the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Applied Arts) in Burg Giebichenstein near Halle. After the death of its director, Paul Thiersch, Marcks was named his replacement, a position he continued in until 1933. He was fired because his work was deemed unsuitable by the Nazis, with the result that several works were in the infamous exhibition of &quot;degenerate art&quot; in Munich in 1937, along with that of other Bauhaus artists, among them Herbert Bayer, Lyonel Feininger, Johannes Itten, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, László Moholy-Nagy, Oskar Schlemmer and Lothar Schreyer.

Despite such persecution, Marcks continued to live in the German city of Mecklenburg throughout World War II. In 1937, when twenty-four of his works were confiscated and destroyed by the Nazis, he was prohibited from exhibiting and threatened with being forbidden to work. During this period, he made several trips to Italy, where he worked in the Villa Romana in Florence and the Villa Massimo in Rome. In 1943, his studio in Berlin was hit during an air raid, and many of his works destroyed.

After World War II, Marcks became Professor of Sculpture at the Landeskunstschule (Regional Art School) in Hamburg, where he taught for four years, before retiring to Cologne. He also designed memorials for soldiers and civilians who had died in the war, and his work was part of the art competitions at three Olympic Games.

==Death and legacy==
Marcks died in 1981 in Burgbrohl, Eifel. A decade earlier, the museum called Gerhard Marcks Haus, which houses a permanent exhibition of his artwork, was established in his honor in Bremen, Germany. In this museum are 12,000 of his sketches and preparatory drawings, 900 prints, and all his sculptures (about 350). In the U.S., there is a collection of Marcks&#x27; work (68 drawings, 65 prints and 9 nine bronze sculptures) at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, most of which were given to that school by his former student and close associate, Marguerite Wildenhain. Of particular note is a monumental Marcks bronze statue titled &quot;Oedipus and Antigone&quot; (1960), which was installed there in 2000. 

His niece, the caricaturist Marie Marcks (1922-2014) was called the &quot;Grande Dame&quot; of political caricature.

== Honors and exhibitions ==

*In 1914 Marcks participated in exhibitions of the Berlin Secession and the Deutscher Werkbund, after World War II at the Venice Biennale and the Documentas I (1955), II (1959) and III (1964) in Kassel.
*In 1949 the city of Frankfurt am Main awarded him the Goethe Plaque.
*In 1952 he was appointed a Knight of the Peace Class of the Order Pour le Mérite.
*In 1954 North Rhine-Westphalia awarded him its Grand Art Prize.
*In 1955 the city of Berlin awarded him its Art Prize.
*In 1962 the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg, made him an honorary member
*In 1979 he was honored on his 90th birthday by exhibitions in Berlin, Bremen, Cologne and Nuremberg, as well as by the award of the Grand Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.
*In 1980 the American Academy of Letters, New York, made him an honorary member, together with Max Ernst and Karlheinz Stockhausen.
*In 1991 10778 Marcks (1991 gn10), a minor planet (asteroid) was discovered on 9 April, and named in his honor.

<text>Jinja is a city in the Eastern Region of Uganda, located on the north shore of Lake Victoria.

==Location==
Jinja is in Jinja District, Busoga sub-region, in the Eastern Region of Uganda. It is approximately east of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda.

It sits along the northern shores of Lake Victoria, near the source of the White Nile, at an average elevation of above sea level.

==History==
The city was founded in 1901 by British settlers. It was planned under colonial rule in 1948 by Ernst May, German architect and urban planner. May also designed the urban planning scheme for Kampala, creating what he called &quot;neighbourhood units&quot;. Estates were built for the ruling elite in many parts outside the centre city. This led to the area&#x27;s &#x27;slum clearance&#x27; which displaced more than 1,000 residents in the 1950s.

In 1954, the construction of the Owen Falls Dam submerged the Ripon Falls. Most of the &quot;Flat Rocks&quot; that gave the area its name disappeared under water as well. Both the Baganda on the western side and the Busoga on the eastern side of the Nile called the area &quot;the stones&quot; which is &quot;ejjinja&quot; in both languages. The name &quot;Jinja&quot; derives from this. A description of what the area looked like can be found in the notes of John Hanning Speke, the first European to lay eyes on the source of the Nile:

Though beautiful, the scene was not exactly what I expected, for the broad surface of the lake was shut out from view by a spur of hill, and the falls, about twelve feet deep and four to five hundred feet broad, were broken by rocks; still it was a sight that attracted one to it for hours. The roar of the waters, the thousands of passenger fish leaping at the falls with all their might, the fishermen coming out in boats, and taking post on all the rocks with rod and hook, hippopotami and crocodiles lying sleepily on the water, the ferry at work above the falls, and cattle driven down to drink at the margin of the lake, made in all, with the pretty nature of the country—small grassy-topped hills, with trees in the intervening valleys and on the lower slopes—as interesting a picture as one could wish to see.&quot;

Jinja was among the Ugandan cities affected by the Uganda–Tanzania War of 1978–1979. After the Fall of Kampala to the coalition of the Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force (TPDF) and the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA), Ugandan President Idi Amin initially fled to Jinja. There, he attempted to rally remnants of the Uganda Army (UA). According to journalist Nelson Bwire Kapo, Amin even declared Jinja the new capital of Uganda, but soon fled to Arua and from there into exile. Parts of the local UA garrison belonging to the Eagle Colonel Gaddafi Battalion remained, drunkenly harassing and murdering local civilians, but most soldiers gradually deserted and fled Jinja. The TPDF and their UNLA allies assaulted Jinja on 22 April 1979, occupying the city after encountering little resistance. The remaining UA troops mostly fled, and Jinja&#x27;s civilian residents greeted the TPDF-UNLA force with cheers. The operation was accompanied by some looting in the city. Following the end of hostilities, Tanzanian officers reportedly used Jinja as a hub to transport stolen goods from Uganda to Mwanza, including cars, tons of coffee, large amounts of gasoline, and war materiel.

===Population during the 2000s===
The national census of 2002 estimated Jinja&#x27;s population to be 71,213 of which 36,325 were males and 34,888 were females. In 2010, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) estimated the population at 82,800. In 2011, UBOS estimated the population at 89,700. In 2014, the national population census put the population at 72,931 However, the Municipality Authority contested the recent census of 2014, saying it under-counted Jinja&#x27;s population. According to the 2014 national population census data, Jinja is the largest metropolitan area in the Jinja District and the 14th-largest metropolis in the country.

The majority of the population are of Bantu origin. Lusoga is the main local language. Jinja has a large population of inhabitants who are defined as &quot;working urban poor&quot;. The average annual household income is estimated at US $100.

==Economy==
Jinja has the second largest economy in Uganda. In the past, factories chose Jinja as their base because of the nearby electric power station at the Owen Falls Dam. Since the early 2000s, the economy of Jinja has picked up steadily. The main economic activities take place in the central business district.

A new market for fresh produce was completed during the fourth quarter of 2014. The facility can accommodate up to 4,500 vendors and cost US$13.7 million to construct, with a loan from the African Development Bank from 2011 until 2014.

The biggest local employer is the Kakira Sugar Works (KSW), a member of the Madhvani Group of companies. KSW is one of the largest sugar factories in East Africa, employing over 7,500. The factory burns bagasse byproducts from sugar manufacturing to generate 50 megawatts of electricity for internal use and sale to the national grid. Sugar cane cutting median wages are about UGX:1,000 per day.

The headquarters of Nile Breweries Limited are in Njeru, in Buyikwe district in central Uganda, near the Source of the Nile, from which the brewery has been drawing its water since 1956. Building of the brewery commenced in 1952 and was completed four years later. Bottles of Nile Beer, renamed Nile Special Lager, the company&#x27;s flagship brand, were first consumed in 1956. In 2001, Nile Breweries Limited was fully acquired by South African Breweries.

MM Integrated Steel Uganda Limited is one of the leading manufacturers of steel in the region. It has completed a $47 million (Shs122 billion) plant to produce 50,000 tonnes of steel products a year and directly employs 1,800 people. The company has projected to invest US$600 million through 2018.

Bidco International Oil Refining Company maintains a palm oil factory in the city. The palm oil fruits come from Bidco&#x27;s plantation on Bugala Island in the Ssese Islands Archipelago, Kalangala District, in Lake Victoria. The factory in the islands crushes the fruit, and the crude palm oil is transported to Jinja for refining into edible oil and other products.

Kiira Motors Corporation, also known as the Kiira EV Project, a locally based startup car company, expects to set up the first car manufacturing facility in Uganda, based in Jinja. The Kiira EV Project received of land at the Jinja Industrial and Business Park. Production is expected to start in 2018. The government of Uganda will provide funding to the initial production and setting up of a factory for the project.

<text>Hanif Kureishi (born 5 December 1954) is a British Pakistani playwright, screenwriter, filmmaker, and novelist. He is known for his film &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; and novel &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Hanif Kureishi was born on 5 December 1954 in Bromley, South London, to a Pakistani father, Rafiushan (Shanoo) Kureishi, and an English mother, Audrey Buss. His father was from a wealthy family based in Madras (now Chennai), whose members moved to Pakistan after the Partition of India in 1947. Rafiushan&#x27;s father was a colonel and doctor in the British Indian Army. Rafiushan went to the same Cathedral School attended by Salman Rushdie, and the family were later close to the Bhuttos. Rafiushan&#x27;s brother (Hanif&#x27;s uncle), Omar Kureishi, was a newspaper columnist and manager of the Pakistan cricket team.

Rafiushan travelled to the UK in 1950 to study law, but he ran out of money and needed to take a desk job at the Pakistani high commission instead. There he met his wife-to-be, Audrey Buss. He wanted to be a writer but his ambitions were frustrated, with his submissions to publishers turned down.

Hanif Kureishi attended Bromley Technical High School and studied for A-levels at Bromley College of Technology. While at this college, he was elected as student union president (1972). Some of the characters from his semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot;, are drawn from this period.

He spent a year studying philosophy at Lancaster University, then withdrew. He later attended King&#x27;s College London and earned a degree in philosophy.

==Career==
Kureishi started his career in the 1970s as a pornography writer, under the pseudonyms Antonia French and Karim.

He went on to write plays for the Hampstead Theatre, Soho Poly, and by the age of 18, was with the Royal Court.

He wrote &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; in 1985, about a gay Pakistani-British boy growing up in 1980s London, for a film directed by Stephen Frears. The screenplay, especially the racial discrimination experienced, contained elements from Kureishi&#x27;s experiences as the only Pakistani student in his class at school. It won the New York City Film Critics Best Screenplay Award and an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. He also wrote the screenplay for &quot;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid&quot; (1987). 

His book &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot; (1990) won the Whitbread Award for the best first novel and was made into a BBC television series with a soundtrack by David Bowie. 

In 1991 his feature film titled &quot;London Kills Me&quot;, which he wrote and directed, was released.

Kureishi:s novel &quot;Intimacy&quot; (1998) revolved around the story of a man leaving his wife and two young sons after feeling physically and emotionally rejected by his wife. This created some controversy as Kureishi recently had left his own partner (the editor and producer Tracey Scoffield) and two young sons; it was assumed to be at least semi-autobiographical. In 2000/2001, the novel was adapted into the film &quot;Intimacy&quot; by Patrice Chéreau, which won two awards at the Berlin Film Festival. The book was translated into Persian by Niki Karimi in 2005.

Kureishi&#x27;s drama &quot;The Mother&quot; was adapted as a film by Roger Michell, released in 2003. It tells the story of a cross-generational relationship with a reversal of expected roles: a 70-year-old English grandmother seduces her daughter&#x27;s boyfriend. 

Kureishi wrote the 2006 screenplay &quot;Venus&quot;, for the film starring Peter O&#x27;Toole. A novel titled &quot;Something to Tell You&quot; was published in 2008.

His 1995 novel &quot;The Black Album&quot;, adapted for the theatre, was performed at the National Theatre in July and August 2009. 

In May 2011, he was awarded the second Asia House Literature Award on the closing night of the Asia House Literary Festival, where he discussed his &quot;Collected Essays&quot; (Faber).

Kureishi has also written non-fiction, including an autobiography, &quot;My Ear at His Heart&quot;. In it, he describes his relationship with his father, Rafiushan, who died in 1991.

Major influences on Kureishi&#x27;s writing include P.G. Wodehouse and Philip Roth.

== Other activities ==
In October 2013, Kureishi was appointed as a professor in the creative writing department at Kingston University in London, where he was a writer in residence. 
==Personal life==
Kureishi was living in West London in 2016. His entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; lists his recreations as &quot;music, cricket, sitting in pubs&quot;.

Although he acknowledges his father&#x27;s Pakistani roots, Kureishi rarely visits Pakistan. A 2012 visit sponsored by the British Council was his first trip to Pakistan in 20 years. Kureishi&#x27;s uncle was the writer, columnist and Pakistani cricket commentator and team manager Omar Kureishi. The poet Maki Kureishi was his aunt. 

He is bisexual. He has twin boys from his relationship with film producer Tracey Scoffield and a younger son from a previous relationship. 

Kureishi&#x27;s family have accused him of exploiting them with thinly disguised references in his work, with his sister Yasmin writing a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; about it. She says that his descriptions of her family&#x27;s working-class roots are fictitious, and their father was not a bitter old man. Yasmin takes issue with her brother for his thinly-disguised autobiographical references in his first novel &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot;, as well as for the image of his own past that he portrays in newspaper interviews. Hanif&#x27;s father felt that Hanif had robbed him of his dignity in &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot;, and didn&#x27;t speak to him for many months. There was further furore with the publication of &quot;Intimacy&quot;, as the story was assumed to be autobiographical.

In early 2013, Kureishi lost his life savings in a suspected fraud. 

In 2014, the British Library announced that it would be acquiring the archive of Kureishi&#x27;s documents spanning 40 years of his writing life. The body of work was to include diaries, notebooks and drafts.

On 26 December 2022, Kureishi was hospitalised following a fall in Rome, which left him with spinal injuries and unable to move his limbs. According to Kureishi, the fall triggered a near-death experience. He was convinced he was going to die while in hospital, later saying that his partner, Isabella d&#x27;Amico, helped keep him calm and saved his life. He has since written about the fall and his recovery process on social media and in a blog. His detailed memoir, including diary entries on the accident, &quot;Shattered&quot;, was published in 2024.

In September 2024, the BBC released a biographical documentary &quot;In My Own Words&quot; by his close friend Nigel Williams in which the writer revisits his life and career via the medium of old archive footage.

==Recognition, awards and honours==
Kureishi was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours for services to Literature and Drama.
In the same year, &quot;The Times&quot; included Kureishi in its list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.

<doc id="1235105" wikidata="Q5536500" url="?curid=1235105" title="George Augustus Sala">
<text>George Augustus Henry Fairfield Sala (24 November 1828 – 8 December 1895) was an author and journalist who wrote extensively for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; as G. A. S. and was most famous for his articles and leaders for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He founded his own periodical, &quot;Sala&#x27;s Journal&quot;, and the Sydney Savage Club. The former was unsuccessful but the latter still continues.

==Life==
Sala was born on 24 November 1828 in London. His legal father Augustus John James Sala (1789–1829) being the son of an Italian who came to London to arrange ballets at the theatres. His natural father and godfather was Captain Charles &quot;Henry&quot; Fairfield, an acquaintance of his mother, Henrietta Catharina Simon (1789–1860), an actress and teacher of singing. She was the daughter of Catherina Cells, a former slave, and Demerara planter D. P. Simon. His great-grandmother was the Caribbean entrepreneur, Dorothy Thomas. He was at school at Paris from 1839 but his family returned to England due to the political unrest in the city. He learnt drawing in London, and in his earlier years he did odd-jobs in scene-painting (for John Medex Maddox at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, London) and book illustration. The connection of his mother and elder brother (Charles Kerrison Sala) with the theatre gave him useful introductions to authors and artists.

At an early date he tried his hand at writing, and in 1851 attracted the attention of Charles Dickens, who published articles and stories by him in &quot;Household Words&quot; and subsequently in &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, and in 1856 sent him to Russia as a special correspondent. About the same time he got to know Edmund Yates, with whom, in his earlier years, he was constantly connected in his journalistic ventures and also become a lifelong friend of the penny dreadful publisher Edwin Brett. In 1860, over his own initials &quot;G.A.S.&quot;, he began writing &quot;Echoes of the Week&quot; for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, and continued to do so until 1886, when they were continued in a syndicate of weekly newspapers almost to his death. William Makepeace Thackeray, when editor of the &quot;Cornhill&quot;, published articles by him on Hogarth in 1860, which were issued in column form in 1866; and in the former year he was given the editorship of &quot;Temple Bar&quot;, which he held until 1863.
Meanwhile, he had become in 1857 a contributor to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and it was in this capacity that he did his most characteristic work, whether as a foreign correspondent in all parts of the world, or as a writer of &quot;leaders&quot; or special articles. His literary style, highly coloured and bombastic, gradually became associated by the public with their conception of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;; and though the butt of the more scholarly literary world, his articles were invariably full of interesting matter and helped to make the reputation of the paper. He collected a large library and had an elaborate system of keeping common-place books, so that he could be turned on to write upon any conceivable subject with the certainty that he would bring into his article enough show or reality of special information to make it excellent reading for a not very critical public; and his extraordinary faculty for never saying the same thing twice in the same way had a sort of &quot;sporting&quot; interest even to those who were more particular. Also in 1857, Sala became one of the founders of the Sydney Savage Club, which still flourishes today.

He earned a large income from the &quot;Telegraph&quot; and other sources, but he never could keep his money. In 1879, Sala wrote a bawdy pantomime called &quot;Harlequin Prince Cherrytop&quot;, which subsequently was adapted as a monologue sometimes called &quot;The Sod&#x27;s Opera&quot; and is often falsely attributed to Gilbert and Sullivan. Three years later, he published a pornographic novel of flagellation erotica entitled &quot;The Mysteries of Verbena House&quot; (under the pseudonym Etonensis) and a travelogue of North America. In 1892, when his popular reputation was at its height, he started a weekly paper called &quot;Sala&#x27;s Journal&quot;, but it was a disastrous failure; and in 1895 he had to sell his library of 13,000 volumes. Lord Rosebery gave him a civil list pension of £100 a year, but he was a broken-down man, and he died at Brighton, England, on 8 December 1895.

Sala published many volumes of fiction, travels and essays, and he edited various other works, but his &quot;métier&quot; was that of ephemeral journalism; and his name goes down to posterity as perhaps the most popular and most voluble of the newspaper men of the period.

During a visit to Australia in 1885, Sala coined the phrase &quot;Marvellous Melbourne&quot; to describe the booming city of Melbourne, a phrase which stuck with the locals and is still used to this day.

Mrs. George Augustus Sala died in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia 31 December 1885, after a very brief illness. In 1890, Sala married a second wife, Bessie Stannard, who was the sister-in-law of writer John Strange Winter [Henrietta Vaughan Stannard].

== Quotations ==
&quot;In the course of life, it is by little acts of watchful kindness recurring daily and hourly, by words, tones, gestures, looks, that affection is won and preserved&quot;

&quot;A future is always a fairyland to the young.&quot;

&quot;And for how long will a People suffer the mad tyranny of a Ruler, who outrages their Laws, who strangles their Liberties, who fleeces and squeezes and tramples upon them&quot; (&quot;The Strange Adventures of Captain Dangerous&quot;).

&quot;There is a mighty quantity of Sand and good store of Mud at Ostend, and a very comforting smell of fish.&quot; (&quot;The Strange Adventures of Captain Dangerous&quot;).

&quot;Not only to say the right thing, at the right place, but far more difficult to leave unsaid, the wrong thing, at the tempting moment!&quot;

&quot;Melbourne the Marvellous&quot; commonly misquoted or shortened today as &quot;Marvellous Melbourne.&quot;

<doc id="1235112" wikidata="Q560182" url="?curid=1235112" title="Chittaranjan Das">
<text>Chittaranjan Das (5 November 1870 – 16 June 1925), popularly called Deshbandhu (friend of the country), was a Bengali freedom fighter, political activist and lawyer during the Indian Independence Movement and the political guru of Indian freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. He was the founder-leader of the Swaraj Party in undivided Bengal during the period of British Colonial rule in India. His name is abbreviated as C. R. Das.
He was closely associated with a number of literary societies and wrote poems, apart from numerous articles and essays.

==Early life==
Chittaranjan Das was born on 5 November 1870 to a well-known Bengali Hindu Baidya family in Calcutta but his family originally form the village named Telirbagh, situated in present-day Tongibari Upazila of the Munshiganj (Bikrampur) district of Bangladesh.

== Family ==

Das family were members of Brahmo Samaj. Chittaranjan was the son of Bhuban Mohan Das, and nephew of the Brahmo social reformer Durga Mohan Das. His father was a solicitor and a journalist who edited the English church weekly, &quot;The Brahmo Public Opinion&quot;. Some of his cousins were Atul Prasad Sen, Satya Ranjan Das, Satish Ranjan Das, Sudhi Ranjan Das, Sarala Roy and Lady Abala Bose. His eldest grandson was Siddhartha Shankar Ray and his grand daughter is Justice Manjula Bose.

He married Basanti Devi (1880–1974) and had three children, Aparna Devi (1898–1972), Chiraranjan Das (1899–1928) and Kalyani Devi (1902–1983).

==Education==
The Das family of Durga Mohan was a family of lawyers. Durga Mohan&#x27;s eldest son Satya Ranjan matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and was at Middle Temple during 1883–1886, followed by Chitta Ranjan Das, Durga Mohan&#x27;s brother&#x27;s son, during 1890–1894. Satish Ranjan Das (1891–1894), Jyotish Ranjan Das and Atul Prasad Sen (1892–1895) followed suit.

In London, Das befriended Sri Aurobindo Ghosh, Atul Prasad Sen, and Sarojini Naidu, among others, and together they promoted Dadabhai Naoroji in the British Parliament.

==Career==
===Law career===
In 1894 Das gave up his law practice, and went into politics during the non-cooperation movement against the British colonial government. He again took up the brief, and successfully defended Aurobindo Ghosh on charges of involvement in the Alipore bomb case, in 1909. In his Uttarpara speech, Sri Aurobindo acknowledged that Das broke his health to save him.

In the Alipore bomb case in 1908, Chittaranjan Das as defence counsel for Sri Aurobindo Ghosh, made this closing statement:

===Political career===

Chittaranjan Das was actively involved in the activities of Anushilan Samiti. When Pramatha Mitter organised the Samiti as its president to produce hundreds of young firebrands who were ready to sacrifice their lives for the cause of the Nation, Chittaranjan became his associate. Anushilan Samiti was maintained by P. Mitter with the assistance of Chittaranjan Das (1894), Haridas Bose (1895), Suren Haldar (1900) and Manabendra Nath Roy (1901).

He was a leading figure in Bengal during the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1919–1922, and initiated the ban on British-made clothes, setting an example by burning his own European clothes and wearing Khadi clothes.
He brought out a newspaper called &quot;Forward&quot; and later changed its name to &quot;Liberty&quot; as part of his support for various anti-British movements in India. When the Calcutta Municipal Corporation was formed, he became its first mayor.

He was a believer in non-violence and constitutional methods for the realisation of national independence, and advocated Hindu-Muslim unity, cooperation and communal harmony and championed the cause of national education. He resigned his presidency of the Indian National Congress at the Gaya session after losing a motion on &quot;No Council Entry&quot; to Gandhi&#x27;s faction. He then founded the Congress-Khilafat Swaraj Party, with Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar and veteran Motilal Nehru. Other prominent leaders included Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Subhas Chandra Bose of Bengal, Vithalbhai Patel and other Congress leaders who were becoming dissatisfied with the Congress. In May 1923, at AICC meet in Bombay, Das was able to get majority support for his policy of council entry, with 96 members voting in favour, and 71 against.

===Poet===
Chittaranjan Das emerged as a distinguished Bengali poet, when, during the troubled days of National movement, he published the first two volumes of his collection of poems titled &quot;&quot;Malancha&quot; and &quot;Mala&quot;. In 1913 he published &quot;Sagar Sangeet&quot;&quot; (The Songs of the Sea). Sri Aurobindo was in Pondichery and when he was in dire need of financial support. Chittaranjan offered him one thousand rupees as a token of his support for an English translation of the poem, a few verses of which are given below:

Chittaranjan started a monthly journal named Narayana, and many eminent writers such as Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay, Bipin Chandra Pal and Hariprasad Shastri contributed their writings in the journal.

==Death==

In 1925 Chittaranjan&#x27;s health began to fail due to overwork. Chittaranjan went to Darjeeling to recuperate his health staying at Sir N. N. Sircar&#x27;s house &quot;Step Aside&quot; in May 1925. Mahatma Gandhi visited him and stayed with him for some days. Gandhiji wrote, 

The funeral procession in Calcutta was led by Gandhi, who said:

<text>Michael Christopher Thackwell (born 30 March 1961) is a former racing driver from New Zealand, who participated in a number of prominent racing categories, including Formula 1. The sixth youngest driver ever to qualify for a Grand Prix, he participated in five of them, making his first start on 28 September 1980 at the Canadian Grand Prix. He scored no championship points. He had previously attempted unsuccessfully to qualify for the Dutch Grand Prix which was held on 31 August 1980.

Thackwell has been described as a &quot;teenage sensation&quot;, a &quot;maverick&quot; and as &quot;something of a cult hero&quot;. Outside Formula One, he competed successfully in Formula Three, Formula Two, Formula 3000 and sports cars, amongst other categories.

In 1984, Thackwell won the European Formula Two Championship. He was runner up in that championship in 1983, and in its successor, the International Formula 3000 Championship, in 1985. In each case, he was driving a works Ralt. Also in 1986, he won the Pau Grand Prix, again in a works Ralt. Later in the year, he combined with Henri Pescarolo to win the 1000km Nürburgring sports car race, in a Sauber C8.

==Early life==
Thackwell was born into a motor racing family. For many years, his father, Ray, was a successful international speedway rider and racing driver. When Mike was six years old, his family emigrated from New Zealand to Perth, Western Australia, where he spent his formative years, and also began racing. Michael Thackwell has 4 siblings Joan Caccioppoli – Kerry John Thackwell – Lisa Brabham – Heidi Thackwell. Lisa is married to David Brabham.

Between 1972 and 1976, Thackwell attended Christ Church Grammar School, in Claremont, a suburb of Perth. By the time of his Formula One debut in 1980, he spoke with an Australian accent, and regarded himself as Australian, but he competed, and liked to be known, as a New Zealander.

For three years from the age of nine, Thackwell competed in motocross events on motorcycles supplied by his father, an importer of high performance racing and sports cars. He then switched to karts, winning the Western Australian championship at the age of 14. After also winning the Hong Kong Kart Grand Prix in 1975 and 1976, he moved to England. A friend of Ray&#x27;s, who built Formula Ford race cars put Mike in touch with Mike Eastick Scorpion Racing Drivers School at Thruxton in Hampshire.

==Career==

===Starter formulae===

In early 1978, Thackwell began his European career, in the Dunlop Star of Tomorrow Formula Ford championship, held in the United Kingdom. He campaigned with a Van Diemen-Scholar RF78, entered by the Rushen Green team. In a closely fought, 11-round series, he won five rounds, and made the podium on two other occasions, but finished only third in the championship, with 72 points, behind Canadian entrant Robert Zurrer (77 points) and British driver Terry Gray (76 points).

The following year, 1979, Thackwell moved up to the Vandervell British Formula 3 Championship, at the wheel of a March-Toyota 793, entered by the March works team. In a 19-race series, he managed five more wins and four other podium finishes, along with a pole position and a fastest lap. Once again, he finished the championship in third place, this time with 71 points, behind Chico Serra (103 points) and Andrea de Cesaris (90 points), but ahead of Stefan Johansson (fourth), Nigel Mansell (eighth), Alain Prost (equal 12th) and Thierry Boutsen (19th), all four of whom were later to have lengthy, and in most cases race-winning, Formula One careers.

Also in 1979, March entered Thackwell and the March 793 in two races of the FIA European Formula Three Championship. He achieved a win and a fastest lap, at Monza in the Gran Premio della Lotteria. In a championship won by Alain Prost, he also finished equal eighth overall, ahead of Boutsen (nine races), Arie Luyendyk (11 races), Serra (one race) and Philippe Streiff (five races) (equal thirteenth), and Jo Gartner (3 races; 21st). Thackwell and the March 793 also managed pole position and fastest lap in the non-championship RAC FOCA Trophy race at Donington Park, but finished only ninth.

For 1980, Thackwell decided to follow Serra and de Cesaris into Formula Two. However, before that he returned to New Zealand to race a Marlboro-backed works March 792 in Aurora AFX New Zealand International Formula Pacific series, alongside de Cesaris. The cars, modified F2 cars, were overweight and under performed.

His return to Europe saw him again driving a March. As early as round two at Hockenheim he was on the pace, setting fastest lap, a feat he would repeat in the following round on the 14.272 mile Nürburgring Nordschleife. However it was at Zandvoort that he marked himself as a genuine talent.

===Formula One debut===

In 1980, having tested for both Ensign and Tyrrell, Thackwell had been signed by Ken Tyrrell to be a test driver for the Tyrrell F1 team, alongside his F2 campaign. He was invited to the Dutch Grand Prix by Tyrrell as a spectator, both to learn about the track and the Tyrrell 010 when Arrows team boss Jackie Oliver approached him after the first unofficial practice session to ask if he&#x27;d like to drive the Arrows A3. Oliver&#x27;s regular driver, Jochen Mass had been injured at the previous grand prix, but his car was at Zandvoort. Although the car was still set up for Mass, including his seat and pedal arrangement, Thackwell got permission to drive the car from Tyrrell and though he failed to qualify, eventually set a faster time than Keke Rosberg in the Fittipaldi.

He made his official debut a few weeks later, when Tyrrell made the third car available for him at the Canadian Grand Prix. Because he took part in this event, Thackwell was often listed as the youngest driver to start a Formula One race, but this claim is arguable. On the first lap of the race, Alan Jones and Nelson Piquet collided at the first turn and were subsequently hit by a number of other cars, including Jean-Pierre Jarier and Derek Daly, both driving Tyrrells. Thackwell negotiated his way through the carnage and returned to the start/finish line undamaged by which time, the race had been red flagged. As both Jarier&#x27;s and Daly&#x27;s cars were too badly damaged to repair quickly, Thackwell was instructed by Ken Tyrrell to give up his car for Jarier. Under Formula One regulations, when the race is stopped after less than two full laps, the original start is declared null and void and the race starts anew. If a driver cannot bring their car back to the second start, they have technically not taken part in the Grand Prix. Using these criteria, Ricardo Rodríguez remained the youngest race starter until Jaime Alguersuari broke the record at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix; a record that was subsequently broken by Max Verstappen in 2015.

Thackwell had another opportunity at the next race with Tyrrell, the United States Grand Prix. After he suffered a fractured brake disc during qualifying, he was unable to qualify to race at Watkins Glen.

===Between Formula One===

Thackwell&#x27;s debut in a Tyrrell was unsuccessful; he returned to Formula Two in 1981. He was still considered to be one of stars of the future and was signed by Ralt to partner Geoff Lees. After winning the International Trophy at Silverstone, and a third place at Hockenheim, he suffered a massive testing accident driving the works Ralt-Honda at Thruxton that left him with a shattered heel and head injuries. According to Autosport he hit a bank head on and stopped from 140 mph to 0 mph in under 2 feet. Within weeks, although still on crutches, he completed the rest of the season and finished 6th in the Championship.

Unable to secure any works drive in 1982 owing to belief of team owners that he had still not recovered from his accident the previous year. With finance from family, friends and small sponsors, he managed to obtain a drive for the 1982 season in the small under-financed and privately run Horag Racing and Bertram Schäfer Racing Teams; he still managed two top three results at Pau and Spa-Francorchamps.

He rejoined the works Ralt team for 1983, coming second in that year&#x27;s F2 championship to Jonathan Palmer, after a win at Jarama with another eight visits to the podium.
The following season he remained at Ralt, and despite having Roberto Moreno as teammate Thackwell went one better, dominating the championship, taking the title on the back of seven victories out of eleven races, including another success in the International Trophy race at Silverstone. By the end of the season he had taken another six pole positions and nine fastest laps. He led a total of 408 of the 580 laps.

===Return to Formula One===

Suddenly in the middle of his season of dominance, Thackwell was back in demand again. However, this only amounted to two more fill-in one-off drives, the last of his career in F1.

For the Canadian Grand Prix, he replaced Palmer at the RAM team. He duly qualified in 25th place, one place higher than teammate Philippe Alliot, faster by 1.556 seconds. His race lasted until lap 30, when a broken turbo wastegate forced him into retirement. Palmer would reclaim his seat for the next race. Tyrrell wanted him to race in Germany, as Stefan Bellof was unavailable. Once again Thackwell failed to qualify for the German Grand Prix by just 0.055secs. He also tested for Williams during the season.

===After Formula One===
The opportunity to sample other racing categories arose. He drove in two World Endurance Championship races, coming 21st at the Nürburgring 1000km for Obermaier Racing in their Porsche 956 and finishing 5th in the 956 of Kremer Racing at the Fuji 1000km.
Thackwell finished the 1984 season in CART for Penske Racing, in their Pennzoil March 84C, after foot injuries at Sanair during practice for the Molson 300 sidelined Penske ace Rick Mears. While not scoring any points in his two races, unlike Johnny Rutherford, who raced the first two races of Mears&#x27; eventual year and a half recovery as a substitute, the #6 team finished third overall in the 1984 season.

Unable to get a decent drive in F1 and CART, he turned his back on them and raced in the F2 replacement series, the Formula 3000. He won the first round at Silverstone and in the process, won his third International Trophy race. He added two victories before finishing runner-up to Christian Danner. Meanwhile, he also raced four times for the TWR Jaguar team, rounding his season off with a second place at the Shah Alam circuit, partnered by John Nielsen.

In 1986 he continued to win in F3000, both in Europe and Japan, and scored Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s first modern racing success when he shared a Sauber with Henri Pescarolo to win the Nürburgring 1000km.

During the European winter of 1987, Thackwell returned to New Zealand to race in Formula Pacific. He won the first three rounds of the MANZ Formula Pacific International Championship, going on to take the title.
He concentrated on sports car racing with the Kouros Racing Team in their Sauber C9 in 1987, putting the car on pole position at Spa only to receive yet more disappointment during the race when his seat mountings broke when leading the race. His only podium finish in the World Endurance series came after he quit and took a drive with Britten Lloyd Racing in their Porsche 962GTi, this time partnering Mauro Baldi.

In 1988 he had a one-off F3000 drive for the works Ralt outfit at Pau. However, having become disillusioned with motorsport, he turned his back on it at the end of 1988.

In the years following his withdrawal from motorsport, he worked, among other occupations, as a helicopter pilot in the North Sea for British International Helicopters, a gold miner in the North-West of Western Australia and as a teacher in England. He is widely felt to have been one of the great &#x27;lost talents&#x27; – a driver in the wrong place at the wrong time. According to the English magazine Motorsport Thackwell now lives on the South Coast of England, where he spends his free time surfing summer and winter when waves allow.

<text>William Michael Wilds (born 7 January 1946) is a British racing driver from England. He participated in eight Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 20 July 1974. He scored no championship points.

==Career==
After winning a few races in Formula 3 in the early 1970s, Wilds moved on to Formula 5000. At the same time, he took part in a few Formula One Grands Prix, firstly with a non-works March, then with Ensign and BRM. After he failed to qualify at his home Grand Prix in 1976, with a privately run Shadow, he concentrated on other forms of motor sport, including sports car racing and historic racing.

In an interview with Wilds, published on YouTube, he described one of the highlights of his short-lived Formula One career, at the 1974 United States Grand Prix after qualifying, Tyrrell founder Ken Tyrrell walked up to him, telling Wilds that Jody Scheckter wanted to speak to him. Wilds had gone out in qualifying just ahead of Jody, assuming he was going too slow for the Tyrrell. Upon approaching Scheckter, Wilds thought he would be told he was slow. When the South African driver approached him, Wilds raised his voice to him, thinking he would be complained at. After this, Scheckter complemented Wilds&#x27; control and handling of the old Ensign N174.

Wilds won the Formula Two class in the 1978 Aurora AFX championship, driving a Ralt and finished ninth in the overall standings. He also won the Thoroughbred Sports Cars championship in 1984 driving an Aston Martin DB4.

Wilds won the RJB Mining Historic Sports Car Championship in 1992, &#x27;93, &#x27;96 and 98.

Wilds&#x27; sports car racing career included driving at Le Mans 8 times, including C2 cars for Ecurie Ecosse (World Champion C2, 1986), and Group C for Nissan in 1988 with team-mate Win Percy.

Wilds won the 2008 Britcar Drivers Championship together with Ian Lawson and Mike&#x27;s son Anthony Wilds in the ING Sport BMW; the team also went on to win again in 2013 and also won the 2008 Group C Enduro Trophy in the Porsche 962 with Henry Pearman.

He still occasionally drives in events for historic cars. He raced a Porsche 962 and an Elva Mk5 in the 2008 Silverstone Classic. He returned to the Britcar Endurance grid in May 2016 posting his first win as a shared drive with son Anthony in a Ferrari 458.

At the age of 72 Wilds is set to make his debut in the Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain series with the Redline Racing team at Brands Hatch.

In addition to his car racing career, Wilds is an active commercial helicopter pilot and instructor. He is affectionately known as &#x27;The Honorific&#x27; Mike Wilds.

<doc id="1235121" wikidata="Q172143" url="?curid=1235121" title="Moisés Solana">
<text>Moisés Solana Arciniega (26 December 1935 – 27 July 1969) was a Mexican racing driver. He participated in eight Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 27 October 1963, and scoring no championship points. He also participated in one non-championship Formula One race. He also took part in Formula Two in with Team Lotus at the Jarama Circuit near Madrid, Spain. His first racing events were in a 1954 special (the &quot;Solana Sports&quot;), built by Javier Solana. Solana was also a proficient Jai alai player and his racing career was partly funded by this.

In 1968, Solana tested a Formula Two car for Ferrari. He also drove for Lola and McLaren in the USRRC/Can-Am series between 1966 and 1968, and in March 1968 he won the first point-scoring race of the USRRC Group 7 series in the first international race in Mexico City. He still holds all the records in the Mexican road race categories and those at the Mexican Magdalena Mixhuca circuit.

He was the only driver in the history of the Formula One World Championship to start a race in a number 13 car (Divina Galica, in the 1976 British Grand Prix, also attempted a race with the number, but failed to qualify), something he did for BRM on his Formula One debut in the 1963 Mexican Grand Prix until Pastor Maldonado adopted 13 as his permanent number in 2014. Solana was a classified finisher in 11th despite his engine having failed eight laps short of the chequered flag.

On 27 July 1969, Solana was killed in the &quot;Hillclimb Valle de Bravo-Bosencheve&quot; in Mexico, in a fatal accident after his McLaren went wide in a bend and hit a concrete trimming on the edge of the road, overturning the car which landed on top of him and caught fire. The Solana family is still very active in motor racing and has manufactured handmade sports cars on a mostly one-off basis.

The first chicane at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City (turns 1–3) is known as the &quot;Ese Moisés Solana&quot; (&quot;the Moisés Solana Esses&quot;).

<doc id="1235127" wikidata="Q172460" url="?curid=1235127" title="Nello Pagani">
<text>Cirillo Pagani (11 October 1911 – 19 October 2003), nicknamed &quot;Nello&quot;, was an Italian Grand Prix motorcycle road racer and Formula One driver. He was born in Milan, Lombardy, and died in Bresso.

He was known for his long career, spanning from 1928 to 1955, and for becoming the first 125cc World Champion in the inaugural 1949 campaign. He almost became a double Champion in that first year of the World Championship series. In the 500cc class he was officially runner-up. The series was run over six rounds with a rider&#x27;s best three scores counting towards the championship. Englishman Les Graham on an AJS was Pagani&#x27;s main rival. Although Pagani scored more overall points than Graham, he lost the championship with two wins and a third place as his scores that counted, whilst Graham had two wins and a second.

Pagani&#x27;s car racing exploits resulted in wins at the Pau Grand Prix in 1947 and 1948, before his single Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, on 4 June 1950, in the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix at Bremgarten. He finished seventh and scored no championship points. He also finished fourth in the Modena Grand Prix that year, driving a Simca-Gordini.

In 1952 Pagani finished second in class in the Mille Miglia, driving an OSCA but was more involved with motorcycle racing and became the manager of the MV Agusta team.

He was the father of Alberto Pagani, who was also a racing motorcyclist.

<text>Nicolas Kiesa (born 3 March 1978) is a Danish former racing driver of Italian descent. He participated in five Formula One Grands Prix in the 2003 season, scoring no championship points.

Previously, he had won the 2003 Formula 3000 race at Monaco, when Björn Wirdheim slowed on the last lap on the front straight to greet his team.

He returned to Formula One in 2005, replacing Robert Doornbos as Jordan&#x27;s third driver for the German Grand Prix and for the rest of the season.

==Formula One==
Kiesa drove for the Minardi team for five races in 2003, taking the seat vacated after Justin Wilson moved to Jaguar. He made his debut in the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, which he finished in 12th position. Kiesa finished all five races, his best result being 11th in the USA Grand Prix at Indianapolis, but did not outqualify his teammate Jos Verstappen at any race.

<doc id="1235134" wikidata="Q173443" url="?curid=1235134" title="Nino Vaccarella">
<text>Nino Vaccarella (4 March 1933 – 23 September 2021) was an Italian sports car racing and Formula One driver.

His principal achievements include having won the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the Targa Florio in 1965, 1971 and 1975, the latter year when it no longer was a World Sportscar Championship event.

==Sports car career==

Sicily-born Vaccarella was well known for being a Targa Florio specialist. According to Vic Elford &quot;he knew the roads on Sicily like the back of his hand&quot;. His first Targa was in 1959 in a privately entered Maserati, the car finished 10th. The following year he was teamed with Umberto Maglioli for the 1960 Targa Florio in a &quot;birdcage&quot; Maserati, which was owned by the Camoradi team. Maglioli had previously won the race twice; Vaccarella was a schoolteacher in Palermo with a great passion for motorsport. They took the lead in the early afternoon on 8 May and maintained it for three laps until the car broke down. The event was won by Joakim Bonnier and Hans Herrmann in a small silver Porsche. 

His participation in this race kickstarted Vaccarella&#x27;s racing career. He finished 2nd at the 12 Hours of Sebring in the United States, but during the 1963 Nurburgring 1000km, during practice he crashed a brand-new works-entered Ferrari 250P, and broke his arm and was soaked in fuel. He came back to the race a year later to win it with Ludovico Scarfiotti, driving for the factory. He then found even greater success by winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Jean Guichet, reaching the pinnacle of sports car racing.

Vaccarella was paired with Lorenzo Bandini in the 1965 Targa Florio when they won with an average speed of 63.7 miles per hour, finishing in 7 hours and 1 minute. 12.4 seconds. In 1966 Vaccarella and Bandini led most of the race until their Ferrari 330 ran off the track after seven laps and was too damaged to continue. While waving his hand to acknowledge the crowd, Vaccarella made eye contact with a retaining wall that carried the inscription &quot;Viva Nino&quot;. Maglioli and Vaccarella drove a Ford GT-40 to fifth place in the 1967 12 Hours of Sebring. 

The 8 May 1968 edition of &quot;Giornale Di Sicilia&quot; proclaimed in its headline, &quot;Only Vaccarella Can Bring Off The Miracle&quot;. The meaning had to do with the Sicilian driver&#x27;s great task of gaining victory in the Targa Florio in his 2.5-litre Alfa Romeo, called the &quot;Tipo 33&quot;. He was up against four German competitors who were driving Porsche 910 models. The Porsches had recently swept the endurance races at Daytona and Sebring. Few experts gave the four Alfa Romeos much of a chance against the &quot;flawless&quot; Porsches, but Sicilians were trusting the skill of Vaccarella&#x27;s driving. Vaccarella also found more success by winning the Mugello Grand Prix on a 38-mile street circuit similar to the Targa in July of that year. Vaccarella qualified eighth for the 1970 24 Hours of Daytona in a Ferrari 512S, and he won Sebring that year after Mario Andretti was put into Vaccarella and Ignazio Giunti&#x27;s car and put in a stupendous drive to win. He also drove the big V12-powered Ferrari 512S in a heroic yet ultimately losing effort in 1970, damaging the car in the final stages. This was one of a series of 11 endurance events held in Europe and North America for the 1970 world manufacturers championship. 

Vaccarella and Toine Hezemans won the 1971 Targa Florio in an Alfa Romeo. They crossed the finish line over a minute ahead of Andrea de Adamich and Gijs van Lennep, who also drove an Alfa Romeo. This race ended the dominance of Porsche, which had finished first in the previous five Targa Florio races. Vaccarella competed in the 1972 12 Hours of Sebring in one of four Alfa Romeo 33/3TT&#x27;s to be entered in the event. His driving partner was Nanni Galli. They qualified fifth after another Alfa Romeo of Rolf Stommelen and Peter Revson, who started third.

Vaccarella would win the Targa Florio one more time, in 1975 driving an Alfa Romeo 33TT12- the Targa was no longer part of the World Championship but was an Italian national event. After this, Vaccarella retired from racing. His son Giovanni had been born in 1972 and he wanted to be alive to raise his son in this very dangerous era of motor racing. In a later interview, although he was known as a Targa Florio specialist Vaccarella admitted that he preferred fast circuits like Le Mans, Monza and Spa over slow circuits the Targa, Monaco and the Nürburgring. He also admitted in this interview that Le Mans was his favorite circuit.

==Formula One==
Vacarella was selected for the 1962 Ferrari Formula One race team by Enzo Ferrari. He was joined by John Surtees, Mike Parkes, Willy Mairesse, Lorenzo Bandini, and Ludovico Scarfiotti. He participated in five World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 10 September 1961. He scored no championship points. He also participated in several non-Championship Formula One races.

<doc id="1235136" wikidata="Q173311" url="?curid=1235136" title="Norberto Fontana">
<text>Norberto Edgardo Fontana (born 20 January 1975) is an Argentine racing driver. He participated in four Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 29 June 1997 but scoring no championship points.

His opportunity to race came as a result of two separate injuries sustained by regular Sauber driver Gianni Morbidelli during the 1997 season. During the 1997 European Grand Prix, Fontana had gained attention for apparently blocking Jacques Villeneuve to let rival Michael Schumacher pull away from the Canadian. He attempted to enter with the Tyrrell team for 1998 but was dropped in favour for Brazilian Ricardo Rosset and with Minardi for 2000. In between his time in F1, Fontana raced in Formula Nippon. In 2010 he won the Konex Award as one of the five best Racing Drivers of the last decade in Argentina.

==Early career==
Fontana was born in Arrecifies, Buenos Aires as the son of Hector and Clara Fontana. He started racing at the age of 8 at the Summer Night Championship in Lujan. In 1989, he began a full season of karting and finished 2nd in the Youth Kart Championship of Buenos Aires Province. The following year, Fontana progressed to a higher level of championship and finished 4th. In 1992, he moved into car racing and competed in the Formula Renault Argentina series before moving into the European series events in 1993.

Fontana raced in the German Formula Three Championship series in 1994 and 1995, winning the 1995 title as well as that year&#x27;s Marlboro Masters event at Zandvoort circuit. He claimed the title ahead of drivers including Ralf Schumacher, Alexander Wurz, Jarno Trulli and Jan Magnussen.

In 1996, Fontana entered Formula Nippon for the Nova Engineering team driving a Lola T96/51 Mugen. His highlights were finishing 2nd twice in Fuji in a season that included multiple accidents, mechanical failures and poor results. For 1997, he drove for the Le Mans team in their Reynard 97D Mugen. The season started badly but made a comeback to finish 5th in Fuji, a win at Mine and 3rd in Motegi.

==Formula One==
Fontana joined the Sauber test team in 1995 when Peter Sauber approached him for a test session that took place at Barcelona in late 1994. He retained this role throughout 1995 and 1996.

===1997===
Fontana made his Formula One debut at the 1997 French Grand Prix replacing Gianni Morbidelli who had broken his arm prior to the race. He qualified 20th and retired when he understeered and ended up in a gravel trap. Prior to the British GP, team principal Peter Sauber looked for replacements to take Fontana&#x27;s seat but eventually decided to keep Fontana on board. During qualifying, he missed a red light indicating that the car must come in for a mandatory weight check. Fontana drove past the light and was forced to start at the back of the grid. In the race, Fontana finished 9th despite his right leg becoming numb. At Hockenheim, he started 18th and finished 9th despite spinning early on.

At the 1997 European Grand Prix in Jerez, Fontana received a $5,000 fine for speeding in the pitlane and eventually qualified 18th. During the race, Fontana appeared to block Jacques Villeneuve, who was the direct rival of Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher at the time. ITV commentator Martin Brundle pointed out that the Sauber team used Ferrari engines at the time. Fontana eventually finished 14th with his highlight being overtaking Jos Verstappen with two wheels on the grass.

===Attempted comebacks===
Fontana was considered as a driver for the dying Tyrrell team for 1998 with team principal Ken Tyrrell negotiating with the Argentine. Fontana signed a draft contract, but did not sign the final contract as the owners British American Tobacco had vetoed the suggestion and Tyrrell was forced to sign Brazilian Ricardo Rosset who had more sponsorship brought to the team. In 1999, Fontana tested with Minardi for a seat that would partner Marc Gené. However, sponsorship once again caused the Argentine to lose the seat for a possible comeback.

==Post-Formula One==
Fontana decided to return to Formula Nippon and finished 4th in the series which included a win in Fuji. He also competed in the Japanese GT Championship and was paired with Masanori Sekiya. The pair finished 6th in Suzuka, 3rd at Sendai and Motegi. The pair finished 7th in the championship.

===Touring car racing===

He subsequently moved into Argentine touring car racing, driving in the Turismo Carretera, TC2000 and Top Race V6. In the TC2000 he was champion in 2002 (with Toyota) and 2010 (with Ford), and third in 2004 and 2014. In 2006, he was Turismo Carretera champion. Until 2009 he drove for Toyota, given the relationship he had with the brand when he raced in Japan.

In 2022, at the age of 49, Fontana joined TCR South America.

Fontana also competed at the 2011 Dakar Rally in a buggy.

<doc id="1235149" wikidata="Q171620" url="?curid=1235149" title="Oscar Larrauri">
<text>Oscar Rubén Larrauri (born 19 August 1954) is a racing driver from Argentina. He participated in 21 Formula One Grands Prix, all with the EuroBrun team, debuting at the 1988 Brazilian Grand Prix. He scored no championship points, only qualifying 8 times.

He was for many years part of Brun Motorsport in sports car racing, and involved in the World Sportscar Championship, IMSA GT Championship, Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft, and All Japan Sports Prototype Championship during his career.

==Formula One==
===1988===
After spending a number of years in sports cars, Brun Motorsport owner Walter Brun decided to move into Formula One in . Brun Motorsport formed an alliance with Giampaolo Pavanello&#x27;s Euroracing team who had previously run the factory backed Alfa Romeo team from 1982-1985. The team became known as EuroBrun and Larrauri was signed to drive for the team alongside 1987 Formula 3000 champion Stefano Modena.

The EuroBrun ER188, powered by the Cosworth DFZ V8 engine, proved to be one of the slowest cars in its debut season with Larrauri in particular gaining an unwanted reputation as a mobile road block in the René Arnoux mould (i.e. one who rarely used his mirrors and often held up faster cars from lapping him, and even getting in the way during qualifying runs). Larrauri&#x27;s best finish for the year was a 13th place in Mexico (Rd.4) with his only other finish being a 16th place in Germany (Rd.8). With a lack of results coming, Brun actually looked to replace the Argentine in mid-season, but no driver was available who could fit into the car and Larrauri was retained for the rest of the season.

===1989===
Without a drive at the start of , Larrauri only entered in the last five Grands Prix of the season, again with EuroBrun, though he failed to pre-qualify on each occasion bringing an end to his brief Formula One career. Larrauri then moved back into sports car racing.

<doc id="1235162" wikidata="Q4875017" url="?curid=1235162" title="Bayview Village">
<text>Bayview Village is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is part of the federal Don Valley North riding and the provincial Don Valley North electoral district, and Toronto electoral Ward 17: Don Valley North. In 2006, it had a population of 15,370.

The area is bordered on the north by Finch Avenue East, on the west by Bayview Avenue, on the east by Leslie Street, and on the south by Highway 401, and also including the grounds of North York General Hospital, east of Leslie in the neighbourhood&#x27;s southeast corner, according to the City of Toronto&#x27;s definition. The Bayview Village Association regards the east boundary as the Don River (east branch) and the south boundary as Sheppard Avenue East, thereby excluding land between the Don River and Leslie, Sheppard and Highway 401.

==History==

The Bayview Village neighbourhood was planned in 1954 by a group of developers led by Farlinger Development Ltd. Bayview Village was hailed as &quot;contemporary living in the countryside, at the doorstep of the urban concentration of Metropolitan Toronto.&quot; The design and layout of Bayview Village is very much influenced by the East Don Valley Parklands. Dr E. G. Faludi, the town planner who designed Bayview Village, recognized the importance of the East Don Valley Parklands when he said: &quot;We will fit the community into the landscape and not the landscape into the community.&quot; Faludi&#x27;s trademark curvilinear street pattern follows the natural contours of the land. Nearly a quarter of the space in Bayview Village is green. Bayview Village&#x27;s winding streets and culs-de-sac are planted with mature birch, cedar, willow, spruce, pine and maple trees. Some of the Bayview Village houses are situated on ravine lots that feature views of the East Don River Valley Parklands. Several of the street names in Bayview Village, such as Citation Drive, Palomino Cres., Ravenscroft Circle recall that the area was a racehorse training stable and grounds before being developed. In the Bayview Village area, there are United, Greek Orthodox, Catholic, and Anglican churches, the latter is located just outside the area&#x27;s southwest boundary.

The Bayview Village Association was established in 1956. It is a volunteer group of residents who work to monitor city and provincial initiatives on a wide range of topics including traffic, local development, parks, and safety. In addition, they produce a regular newsletter distributed to all homes covering a wide range of topical issues. The Bayview Village Association also hosts a number of events throughout the year including clean-up days, all-candidates meetings, community fairs, speakers series, annual perennial swaps, etc. Over 50% of Bayview Village residents are members of the Association.

The Bayview Village Shopping Centre opened in 1963. It is located at the northeast corner of Sheppard Avenue and Bayview Avenue.

==Architecture==
Most Bayview Village homes were built between 1954 and 1964. The mix of housing here includes raised and executive ranch style bungalows, split-level houses, and Georgian Revival-style homes. Most of the houses are original. Many homes have undergone renovation and landscaping to fit the park-like neighbourhood. There has been increasing infill housing (newly built houses replacing the older ones) within the Bayview Village area.

There also continues to be high rise condominium development along Sheppard Avenue and in the land south of Sheppard Avenue and north of Highway 401. This development is of a completely different nature to the single-family suburban low-rise architecture found in the northern area.

==Education==
One public school board operate schools in Bayview Village, the secular English first language Toronto District School Board (TDSB).

TDSB operate public elementary schools in the neighbourhood. The TDSB operates two institutions that provide primary education, Bayview Middle School, and Elkhorn Public School.

No school board operates a secondary school in the neighbourhood, with CSV, and TDSB secondary school students residing in Bayview Village attending institutions in adjacent neighbourhoods. The public separate school board, Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and its French first language counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM) also offer schooling to applicable residents of Bayview Village. However, they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood. CSCM and TCDSB students attend schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto.

== Recreation==

The Bayview Village Tennis Club, home of &quot;tennis ace&quot; Daniel Nestor is a community tennis club serving Bayview Village since 1975. It was an initiative of the Bayview Village Association. The courts at Bayview Village Tennis Club were completely rebuilt at the end of the 2008 tennis season. Today, Bayview Village Tennis Club continues to be looked upon as the premier tennis club of North York. There are also free public tennis courts in Bayview Village Park.

The North York YMCA, located at the southeast corner of Bayview Avenue and Sheppard Avenue, is the largest recreational facility serving this neighbourhood. Some of the programs being offered at this YMCA include play-gym and swim lessons for preschoolers, gymnastics, karate, swimming and basketball programs for children, and aerobics, yoga and aquafit for adults. Facilities at this centre include a gymnasium, a dance studio, a conditioning room, a main swimming pool with lanes and a training swimming pool.

===Parks===

The western edge of the East Don Parklands winds its way through the centre of Bayview Village and is a vast and expansive green haven with various trails, walkways and bicycle paths. The park&#x27;s naturalization and preservation programs have made the space a habitat for wildlife and a number of rare plant species. The East Don Parklands is situated around the East Don River Valley, which forms a part of the larger Toronto ravine system.

There are many smaller parks and parkettes in Bayview Village including Alamosa Park, and Leslie Park. Blue Ridge Park, Clarinda Park and Bayview Village Park are child-focused, with baseball diamonds, splash pads and playgrounds. Municipal parks in Bayview Village are maintained by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division.

== Transportation ==

Several major roadways serve as the boundary of the neighbourhood, with Bayview Avenue to the west, Finch Avenue to the north, Leslie Street to the east, and Highway 401 to the south. Highway 401 is a major east-west controlled access highway. Other major east-west roadways in the neighbourhood include Sheppard Avenue.

Public transportation in Bayview Village is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), which operates several bus routes, as well as Line 4 Sheppard of the Toronto subway. The subway may be accessed at three stations on Sheppard Avenue, Bayview, Bessarion, and Leslie station.

<text>Wayne Michael Bridge (born 5 August 1980) is an English former professional footballer who played as a left back.

A graduate of the Southampton academy, he made his debut in 1998 and would go on to make over 150 league appearances in Premier League before going on to have an extensive career with Chelsea where he won all three domestic competitions over the course of his six-year stay at Stamford Bridge. He also spent time on loan with Fulham before later in 2009 joining Manchester City, where he remained for four seasons, although his final two were spent on loan with West Ham and Sunderland as well as a spell in the EFL Championship with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. He retired in 2014 following a season with Reading.

Bridge made 36 appearances for the England national team between 2002 and 2009, being selected for two FIFA World Cup squads and UEFA Euro 2004.

==Club career==

===Southampton===
Bridge was born in Southampton, but moved to Stanmore, Winchester at an early age. He attended Oliver&#x27;s Battery Primary and Kings&#x27; School, Winchester. When playing for Olivers Battery F.C. he was spotted by Micky Adams, who recommended him to Southampton, who signed him as a trainee in July 1996. He made his reserve team debut as a centre-forward against Portsmouth on 13 August 1997 and turned professional in January 1998.

Bridge made his first-team debut on 16 August 1998 (the opening day of the 1998–99 season) coming on as a replacement for John Beresford, who had badly damaged his knee. Bridge made his first senior start in the next match on 22 August in a 5–0 defeat away to Charlton Athletic. As Southampton struggled to pick up points (with only two points after the first nine games), Bridge played (on the left wing) in most of Saints&#x27; league games until early December before losing his place to Hassan Kachloul. For the remainder of the 1998–99 Premier League season, Bridge was only used occasionally as Saints narrowly avoided relegation. He completed his first season as a first-team player with 15 starts and eight substitute appearances.

The following season carried on in a similar vein with Bridge making occasional appearances on the left wing until injuries to Francis Benali and the poor form of his intended replacement Patrick Colleter gave Bridge the opportunity to play at left-back, where he soon became a fixture in the Saints starting line-up. In the 1999–2000 season, he made 15 starts (plus four substitute appearances) scoring his first senior goal, with a powerful free-kick over the wall, in the final match of the season on 14 May 2000 against Wimbledon, as a result of which Wimbledon were relegated to Division 1 after 14 years in the top flight.

In the 2000–01 season, Bridge was an ever-present at left-back as Saints finished their final season at The Dell in tenth place in the Premier League table. Bridge was rewarded by being voted the Southampton Player of the Year for the 2000–01 season.

Bridge was &quot;fast, determined, skilful and full of youthful promise&quot; and &quot;his forward runs became an exciting sight at The Dell and then at St Mary&#x27;s.&quot; He was an ever-present yet again in the following season as Saints again finished their first season at their new stadium comfortably in mid-table.

Bridge&#x27;s temperament and consistency, together with a high level of fitness, enabled him to continue to play every match until 18 January 2003 when he limped off with an injury in a 1–0 defeat to Liverpool. This brought to an end a run of 113 consecutive appearances, a Premier League record for an outfield player (since surpassed by Frank Lampard). His run started on 4 March 2000, from when Bridge played 10,160 consecutive minutes of Premier League football, not missing any play through injury or suspension.

By now, bigger clubs were trailing Bridge, and he was finally tempted away to join Chelsea for £7 million in the 2003 close season. His last appearance for the club came in the 2003 FA Cup Final defeat to Arsenal. During his five years as a Saints first-team player, he made 173 appearances, with two league goals against Wimbledon and Bolton Wanderers.

===Chelsea===

====2003–04 season====
After five years with the Saints, Bridge moved to Chelsea in July 2003 for a fee of £7 million plus Graeme Le Saux, and was initially a regular starter. His finest moment came in the Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal in 2003–04. Bridge scored the winning goal in the 88th minute to send Chelsea into the semi-finals and end an 18-game winless run against Arsenal. The goal was later voted goal of the season. Bridge also scored against Beşiktaş and Portsmouth in the 2003–04 season.

====2004–05 season====
Bridge started the 2004–05 season playing regularly under new manager José Mourinho, but he picked up a serious ankle injury in an FA Cup tie against Newcastle United on 20 February 2005. This ended his season and also meant he missed the following weekend&#x27;s League Cup Final. Chelsea went on to win the Premier League in his absence but Bridge had already made enough appearances (15) to receive a winners&#x27; medal.

====2005–06 season====
For the 2005–06 season, Chelsea signed Spanish left-back Asier del Horno and Bridge faced a challenge to get back into the side when he recovered from the injury that kept him out of the team in the latter stages of the 2004–05 campaign. He only made two appearances for Chelsea that season, both in domestic cup games. These limited first team opportunities saw him join Fulham on loan on 19 January 2006. He made his debut in a 2–1 defeat to West Ham United at Upton Park. The move seemed to benefit him as he managed to secure his place in the 2006 World Cup English squad for the tournament in Germany. Chelsea won the Premier League again, but Bridge was not eligible for a medal this time as he had not made a single league appearance for them all season.

====2006–07 season====
Bridge&#x27;s main competition for the Chelsea left back position then came from fellow England international left back Ashley Cole. Bridge played the full match in Chelsea&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Manchester City on the opening day of the 2006–07 Premier League season, providing a telling cross for the third goal, scored by a header from Didier Drogba. His strong early season form, however, was not enough to hold down the left-back position, with Mourinho preferring Ashley Cole in most games. Following Cole&#x27;s injury in the 3–0 Premier League win against Blackburn Rovers early in 2007, Bridge became Chelsea&#x27;s natural choice for left-back.

Bridge featured in attack for an injury struck Chelsea side against League Two side Wycombe Wanderers in the 2007 semi-final 1st leg League Cup match, scoring one goal in the process.

Bridge finished the 2006–07 season with two cup final winner&#x27;s medals after playing in both the League Cup Final against Arsenal in a 2–1 win and in the FA Cup Final against Manchester United in a 1–0 victory.

====2007–08 season====
Bridge played his third cup final for Chelsea in just over two years in the 2–1 loss in the 2008 League Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur. Bridge was adjudged to have handled the ball in the penalty area and Tottenham were awarded a penalty from which they scored, going on to win 2–1 after extra-time.

====2008–09 season====
In the League Cup fourth round tie against Burnley in the 2008–09 season, Bridge wore the captain&#x27;s armband in the absence of John Terry and Frank Lampard, but the Blues lost on penalties.

===Manchester City===
====2009–11 seasons====

On 2 January 2009, it was confirmed by Mark Hughes that Manchester City had agreed an undisclosed fee with Chelsea for Bridge, thought to be around £10 million and, on the following day, Manchester City agreed personal terms with the player, who later passed his medical, thus enabling the transfer to be completed and he signed a four-and-a-half-year deal. Bridge was unveiled to the home fans that day at an FA Cup home tie against Nottingham Forest, and two weeks later made his debut for the club in a 1–0 win against Wigan Athletic in the league. He was given the squad number 25. For the 2009–10 season, Bridge switched to the number 3, which was previously worn by Michael Ball.

On 27 February 2010, City inflicted Chelsea&#x27;s first home Premier League defeat of the season with a 4–2 victory. Prior to the match, Bridge was involved in a highly publicised incident in which he refused to shake hands with Chelsea captain and former club and international teammate John Terry, who was at the time the subject of claims that he had had an affair with Bridge&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel. His position as left-back for Manchester City gradually faded with the arrival of two new left-backs. In the summer of 2010, Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini signed Aleksandar Kolarov from Lazio, and in 2011 signed Gaël Clichy from Arsenal, thus indicating Bridge was surplus to requirements at City.

====West Ham United (loan)====

On 12 January 2011, Bridge joined West Ham United on loan until the end of the season. He made his West Ham debut on 15 January 2011 in a 3–0 loss to Arsenal. Bridge made 18 appearances in all competitions for West Ham before his loan ended.

====Sunderland (loan)====
On 31 January 2012, it was announced that Bridge had joined Sunderland on a loan deal until the end of the 2011–12 season. He made his debut appearance as an 82nd minute substitute for Kieran Richardson in Sunderland&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Norwich City the following day. He made his first start for Sunderland in their 1–0 win over Liverpool on 10 March 2012, and also featured in the FA Cup quarter-final draw with Everton the following week.

====Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (loan)====
On 6 July 2012, it was confirmed that Bridge would join Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on a season-long loan. He made his debut for Brighton on 14 August 2012 in a 3–0 away defeat to Swindon Town in the League Cup. His first Brighton goal came on 25 August 2012 in a 5–1 home victory over Barnsley, his first league goal since scoring for Chelsea in December 2003.
 Bridge played 37 league games for Brighton, scoring three goals and helping them reach fourth place in the league to qualify for the play-offs. He played in both semi-final games against Crystal Palace where Brighton were beaten 2–0 on aggregate. At the end of the season, Bridge thanked Brighton manager Gus Poyet for revitalising his footballing career. He told &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Brighton have been great to me. I just want to say a big thank you to the chairman and the fans. Gus has revitalised my love for football after I was in the wilderness at Manchester City.&quot;

===Reading and retirement===
In June 2013, Bridge signed a one-year contract with Reading, who had just been relegated to the Football League Championship. Bridge chose Reading ahead of offers from Queens Park Rangers and Brighton, who wished to make his loan permanent.

On 6 May 2014, Bridge was released by Reading after 12 games in his only season for the club, subsequently retiring from professional football.

==International career==
During his time with Southampton, all Bridge&#x27;s managers (Jones, Hoddle and Gray) predicted full international honours. He was soon making regular appearances for the England under-21 team, and the managers&#x27; prophecy was realised when Sven-Göran Eriksson gave him his first full cap against the Netherlands on 13 February 2002. He quickly proved himself and appeared twice as a substitute in the 2002 World Cup, although he did not appear at all in Euro 2004, with Ashley Cole being preferred.

During qualification for the 2006 World Cup, Bridge occupied England&#x27;s problematic left midfield position, but lost this to his Chelsea teammate Joe Cole when he received an injury. He returned to the England team for a friendly against Argentina in November 2005, covering for the injured Cole at left back and winning his 21st cap.

Bridge played in the Euro 2008 qualifier match against Estonia on 6 June 2007, which England won 3–0, with Bridge assisting Joe Cole&#x27;s goal with a long throw into the box.

Bridge&#x27;s final appearance for England was against Brazil on 14 November 2009.
On 25 February 2010, Bridge announced his permanent withdrawal from international duty following allegations regarding England captain John Terry and Bridge&#x27;s former girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel.

== Boxing==
On 23 March 2018, Bridge took part in an exhibition boxing match against English television personality Spencer Matthews as part of BBC&#x27;s Sport Relief programme. Bridge defeated Matthews via unanimous decision after three rounds.

On 18 January 2025, it was reported that Bridge was being lined up to face English internet personality KSI on 29 March in a professional boxing match. Later that night during the broadcast of MF &amp; DAZN: X Series 20, KSI came into the ring and revealed his original opponent scheduled for March withdrew, thus leading into a face-off with Bridge. The pair got into a brawl after KSI pushed Bridge and brought up John Terry and Bridge&#x27;s former girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel. Two days later Bridge withdrew from the bout due to the comments made by KSI.

==Personal life==

Bridge was in a relationship with French model Vanessa Perroncel from 2005 to 2009. They had a son together, Jaydon Jean Claude Bridge, who was born on 21 November 2006. The next day, Bridge signed a new four-year contract with Chelsea.

In January 2010, a super injunction was imposed by a High Court judge preventing the media reporting that Bridge&#x27;s former teammate John Terry had allegedly had an affair with Perroncel shortly after she split from Bridge. The injunction was lifted a week later. On 25 March, Perroncel succeeded in a claim against Bridge for maintenance for their son with the High Court awarding her a payment of £6,000 per month until Jaydon&#x27;s 18th birthday. The &quot;News of the World&quot; printed an apology for the story on 3 October 2010 to Perroncel for invading her private life, and indicating that she has refuted the claims against herself and Terry.

On 8 April 2013, the Saturdays singer Frankie Sandford announced on Twitter that she was engaged to Bridge. She gave birth to their son, Parker Bridge, on 18 October 2013. The couple married on 19 July 2014 in a private ceremony. In January 2015, Sandford announced that they were expecting their second child. On 15 August 2015, Carter Bridge was born.

Bridge was a contestant in the 2016 series of television series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, but was voted out on 2 December. In 2019, he won the first celebrity series of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, after trekking the El Morado glacier in Chile.

Bridge has spoken about his love for playing poker, which began when his friends started a local monthly home game. He plays in one day live events, and has described his style of play as &#x27;kamikaze&#x27;.

<text>Oswald Karch (6 March 1917 – 28 January 2009) was a racing driver from Germany. He participated in one World Championship Formula One Grand Prix, the 1953 German Grand Prix. Despite not setting a time during qualifying, he was allowed to start the race in 34th position. He retired from the race with engine failure on lap 11 while running 22nd.

During the 1950s, Karch raced in both East and West Germany in Formula Two, initially driving a BMW Eigenbau, and subsequently a Veritas RS. After his appearance in the German Grand Prix in 1953, he competed nationally during 1954, and also finished sixth in his class at the 1954 12 Hours of Casablanca.

Karch died after a period of illness in a nursing home in Mannheim in 2009.

<text>Kojima Engineering was a Japanese Formula One constructor who entered cars in the Japanese Grand Prix in 1976 and 1977.

The team was founded in 1976 by Matsuhisa Kojima. Kojima had made a fortune importing bananas, and was a motor-racing enthusiast, having ridden in Motocross himself in the 1960s. He began entering Formula Two cars in Japan, and struck a deal with Dunlop to supply tyres for the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix. To go with these, the company constructed the KE007 chassis, and brought in several staff-members from the Maki team. They helped arrange an entry for the Grand Prix at Fuji, and a Cosworth DFV engine.

The car was tested throughout the autumn of 1976, with Masahiro Hasemi, a Japanese Formula 2 driver, at the wheel. Hasemi then scored a huge stir at the Japanese Grand Prix, posting 4th best time in the first qualifying session. However, he crashed in the second session, and the car had to be rebuilt virtually from scratch. Hasemi started 10th, and ran superbly before tyre trouble led to an eventual 11th place. He was initially credited with fastest lap, but this was a measurement mistake, and, several days later, the circuit issued a press release to correct the fastest lap holder of the race to Jacques Laffite.

A planned entry into the 1977 South American races was cancelled, but the team built a new Kojima KE009 for the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix. Bridgestone this time supplied the tyres, but these were unsatisfactory, and Noritake Takahara started only 19th before crashing avoiding debris. A second KE009 was entered by Heros Racing for the same race, Kazuyoshi Hoshino starting and finishing 11th.

Kojima continued as an F2 entrant until the late 1980s, but did not venture again beyond domestic racing.

== Notes ==
# It was initially announced that the fastest lap at the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix was set by Masahiro Hasemi in a Kojima, but this was a measurement mistake, and, several days later, the circuit issued a press release to correct the fastest lap holder of the race to Jacques Laffite in a Ligier. This release was promptly made known in Japan, and the Japan Automobile Federation (JAF) and Japanese media corrected the record. But this correction was not made well known outside Japan, thus, Kojima is credited with one fastest lap in many record books.

<text>A spigot algorithm is an algorithm for computing the value of a transcendental number (such as  or &quot;e&quot;) that generates the digits of the number sequentially from left to right providing increasing precision as the algorithm proceeds. Spigot algorithms also aim to minimize the amount of intermediate storage required. The name comes from the sense of the word &quot;spigot&quot; for a tap or valve controlling the flow of a liquid. Spigot algorithms can be contrasted with algorithms that store and process complete numbers to produce successively more accurate approximations to the desired transcendental.

Interest in spigot algorithms was spurred in the early days of computational mathematics by extreme constraints on memory, and such an algorithm for calculating the digits of &quot;e&quot; appeared in a paper by Sale in 1968. In 1970, Abdali presented a more general algorithm to compute the sums of series in which the ratios of successive terms can be expressed as quotients of integer functions of term positions. This algorithm is applicable to many familiar series for trigonometric functions, logarithms, and transcendental numbers because these series satisfy the above condition. The name &quot;spigot algorithm&quot; seems to have been coined by Stanley Rabinowitz and Stan Wagon, whose algorithm for calculating the digits of is sometimes referred to as &quot;&quot;the&quot; spigot algorithm for &quot;.

The spigot algorithm of Rabinowitz and Wagon is &quot;bounded&quot;, in the sense that the number of terms of the infinite series that will be processed must be specified in advance. The term &quot;streaming algorithm&quot; indicates an approach without this restriction. This allows the calculation to run indefinitely varying the amount of intermediate storage as the calculation progresses.

A variant of the spigot approach uses an algorithm which can be used to compute a single arbitrary digit of the transcendental without computing the preceding digits: an example is the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula, a digit extraction algorithm for which produces base 16 digits. The inevitable truncation of the underlying infinite series of the algorithm means that the accuracy of the result may be limited by the number of terms calculated.

==Example==
This example illustrates the working of a spigot algorithm by calculating the binary digits of the natural logarithm of 2 using the identity

:formula_1

To start calculating binary digits from, as an example, the 8th place we multiply this identity by 27 (since 7 = 8 − 1):

:formula_2

We then divide the infinite sum into a &quot;head&quot;, in which the exponents of 2 are greater than or equal to zero, and a &quot;tail&quot;, in which the exponents of 2 are negative:

:formula_3

We are only interested in the fractional part of this value, so we can replace each of the summands in the &quot;head&quot; by

:formula_4

Calculating each of these terms and adding them to a running total where we again only keep the fractional part, we have:

We add a few terms in the &quot;tail&quot;, noting that the error introduced by truncating the sum is less than the final term:

Adding the &quot;head&quot; and the first few terms of the &quot;tail&quot; together we get:

:formula_5

so the 8th to 11th binary digits in the binary expansion of ln(2) are 1, 0, 1, 1. Note that we have not calculated the values of the first seven binary digits – indeed, all information about them has been intentionally discarded by using modular arithmetic in the &quot;head&quot; sum.

The same approach can be used to calculate digits of the binary expansion of ln(2) starting from an arbitrary &quot;n&quot;th position. The number of terms in the &quot;head&quot; sum increases linearly with &quot;n&quot;, but the complexity of each term only increases with the logarithm of &quot;n&quot; if an efficient method of modular exponentiation is used. The precision of calculations and intermediate results and the number of terms taken from the &quot;tail&quot; sum are all independent of &quot;n&quot;, and only depend on the number of binary digits that are being calculated – single precision arithmetic can be used to calculate around 12 binary digits, regardless of the starting position.

<text>Cyrtanthus elatus, the Scarborough lily, is a bulbous flowering plant which originates from the Cape Province of South Africa. Other common names are fire lily and George lily.

Cultivars of the Scarborough lily have flowers which may be bright red, orange, yellow, or occasionally pink or white. The stems can grow to a height of . They are relatively easy to grow in a warm, sheltered, frost-free spot. Alternatively, they can be grown under glass in pots. They require either full sun or slight shade. They flower in late summer or early autumn.

The Latin specific epithet &quot;elatus&quot; means &quot;tall&quot;.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).

<doc id="1235196" wikidata="Q5610643" url="?curid=1235196" title="Grosvenor House">
<text>Grosvenor House was one of the largest townhouses in London, home of the Grosvenor family (the family of the Dukes of Westminster) for more than a century. Their original London residence was on Millbank, but after the family had developed their Mayfair estates, they moved to Park Lane to build a house worthy of their wealth, status and influence in the 19th century. The house gave its name to Upper Grosvenor Street and Grosvenor Square.

The house was requisitioned during the First World War, and was sold and demolished in the 1920s. The Grosvenor House Hotel was built on its site.

==History==
The site was originally occupied by a small house named &#x27;Gloucester House&#x27; (after Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, who owned it), with the front entrance on Upper Grosvenor Street. This house was purchased by Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster, in 1805 for £20,000. He spent £17,000 on extending the house to make it more fashionable. In 1821, a large picture gallery long was added to the west of the house. It was here that many of the Grosvenor family&#x27;s treasures were held.

Another extension was added in 1842, in the form of a long classical-style colonnaded entrance screen on Upper Grosvenor Street. At each end was a triumphal arch with pediments above sculpted with the Grosvenor arms. Thomas Cundy, the architect of this vast house, then proposed a larger mansion to go all the way along to Park Street, extending all the way to . This idea was dropped, as the 2nd Marquess thought it would be too lavish.

In 1870, Hugh Grosvenor, 3rd Marquess of Westminster (later the 1st Duke) commissioned Henry Clutton to add a porte-cochère to the north, and he had many of the state rooms redesigned. In 1889, electricity was introduced, being one of the first buildings in London to do so.

===Demolition===
The house was in the Grosvenor family&#x27;s possession until the First World War, at which point the government requisitioned it. After the war, the family decided that the home was too lavish to maintain, and it was sold. The house was demolished during the 1920s, and the Grosvenor House Hotel was built on the site.

==Art collections==
It is said that the home originally housed one of the best private art collections in the world, with paintings by Gainsborough, Velázquez and other old masters. Some of these were sold between the wars, but most remain in the other Grosvenor family homes, mainly their country seat - Eaton Hall in Cheshire.

<doc id="1235197" wikidata="Q2447438" url="?curid=1235197" title="Menominee">
<text>The Menominee ( ; meaning &quot;Menominee People&quot;, also spelled Menomini, derived from the Ojibwe language word for &quot;Wild Rice People&quot;; known as Mamaceqtaw, &quot;the people&quot;, in the Menominee language) are a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans officially known as the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. Their land base is the Menominee Indian Reservation in Wisconsin. Their historic territory originally included an estimated in present-day Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The tribe currently has about 8,700 members.

Federal recognition of the tribe was terminated in the 1960s under policy of the time which stressed assimilation. During that period, they brought what has become a landmark case in Indian law to the United States Supreme Court, in &quot;Menominee Tribe v. United States&quot; (1968), to protect their treaty hunting and fishing rights. The Wisconsin Supreme Court and the United States Court of Claims had drawn opposing conclusions about the effect of the termination on Menominee hunting and fishing rights on their former reservation land. The U.S. Supreme Court determined that the tribe had not lost traditional hunting and fishing rights as a result of termination, as Congress had not clearly ended these in its legislation.

The tribe regained federal recognition in 1973 by an act of Congress, re-establishing its reservation in 1975. It operates under a written constitution establishing an elected government. The tribe took over tribal government and administration from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in 1979.

==Overview==

The Menominee are part of the Algonquian language family of North America, made up of several tribes now located around the Great Lakes and many other tribes based along the Atlantic coast. They are one of the historical tribes of present-day upper Michigan and Wisconsin; they occupied a territory of about in the period of European colonization. They are believed to have been well-settled in that territory for more than 1,000 years. By some accounts, they are descended from the Old Copper Culture people and other indigenous peoples who had been in this area for 10,000 years.

Menominee oral history states that they have always been here and believe they are Kiash Matchitiwuk (kee ahsh mah che te wuck) which is &quot;Ancient Ones&quot;. Their reservation is located 60 miles west of the site of their Creation, according to their tradition. They arose where the Menominee River enters Green Bay of Lake Michigan, where the city of Marinette, Wisconsin, has since developed.

Their name for themselves is Mamaceqtaw, meaning &quot;the people&quot;. The name &quot;Menominee&quot; is not their autonym. It was adopted by Europeans from the Ojibwe people, another Algonquian tribe whom they encountered first as they moved west and who told them of the Menominee. The Ojibwe name for the tribe was &quot;manoominii&quot;, meaning &quot;wild rice people&quot;, as they cultivated wild rice as one of their most important food staples.

Historically, the Menominee were known to be a peaceful, friendly and welcoming nation, who had a reputation for getting along with other tribes. When the Oneota culture arose in southern Wisconsin between AD 800 and 900, the Menominee shared the forests and waters with them.

The Menominee are a Northeastern Woodlands tribe. They were initially encountered by European explorers in Wisconsin in the mid-17th century during the colonial era, and had extended interaction with them during later periods in North America. During this period they lived in numerous villages which the French visited for fur trading. The anthropologist James Mooney in 1928 estimated that the tribe&#x27;s number in 1650 was 3,000 persons.

The early French explorers and traders referred to the people as &quot;folles avoines&quot; (wild oats), referring to the wild rice which they cultivated and gathered as one of their staple foods. The Menominee have traditionally subsisted on a wide variety of plants and animals, with wild rice and sturgeon being two of the most important. Wild rice has a special importance to the tribe as their staple grain, while the sturgeon has a mythological importance and is often referred to as the &quot;father&quot; of the Menominee. Feasts are still held annually at which each of these is served.
Menominee customs are quite similar to those of the Chippewa (Ojibwa), another Algonquian people. Their language has a closer affinity to those of the Fox and Kickapoo tribes. All four spoke Anishinaabe languages, part of the Algonquian family.

The five principal Menominee clans are the Bear, the Eagle, the Wolf, the Crane, and the Moose. Each has traditional responsibilities within the tribe. With a patrilineal kinship system, traditional Menominee believe that children derive their social status from their fathers, and are born &quot;into&quot; their father&#x27;s clan. Members of the same clan are considered relatives, so must choose marriage partners from outside their clan. Ethnologist James Mooney wrote an article on the Menominee which appeared in &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1913), incorrectly reporting that their descent and inheritance proceeds through the female line. Such a matrilineal kinship system is common among many other Native American peoples, including other Algonquian tribes.

==Culture==

Traditional Menominee spiritual culture includes rites of passage for youth at puberty. Ceremonies involve fasting for multiple days and living in a small isolated wigwam. As part of this transition, youth meet individually with Elders for interpretation of their dreams, and to receive information about what adult responsibilities they will begin to take on following their rites of passage.

===Ethnobotany===
Traditional Menominee diets include local foods such as &quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; (ramps, or wild garlic). Boiled, sliced potatoes of &quot;Sagittaria cuneata&quot; are traditionally strung together and dried for winter use. &quot;Uvularia grandiflora&quot; (bellwort) has historically been used to treat pain and swellings. &quot;Pseudognaphalium obtusifolium, ssp obtusifolium&quot; (rabbit tobacco) is also used medicinally. &quot;Taenidia integerrima&quot; (a member of the parsely family) is taken as a root infusion for pulmonary troubles, and as chew, the steeped root, for &#x27;bronchial affections&#x27;; it is also used as a companion herb in other remedies because of its pleasant smell. The inner bark of &quot;Abies balsamea&quot; is used as a seasoner for medicines, taking an infusion of the inner bark for chest pain and using the liquid balsam pressed from the trunk for colds and pulmonary troubles. The inner bark is used as a poultice for unspecified illnesses. Gum from plant blisters is also applied to sores.

==History==

The tribe originally occupied a large territory of extending from Wisconsin to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Historic references include one by Father Frederic Baraga, a missionary priest in Michigan, who in his 1878 dictionary wrote:

&quot;Mishinimakinago;&quot; pl.&quot;-g.&quot;—This name is given to some strange Indians (according to the sayings of the Otchipwes [Ojibwe]), who are rowing through the woods, and who are sometimes heard shooting, but never seen. And from this word, the name of the village of &quot;Mackinac&quot;, or &quot;Michillimackinac&quot;, is derived.

&quot;Maehkaenah&quot; is the Menominee word for turtle. In his &quot;The Indian Tribes of North America&quot; (1952), John Reed Swanton recorded under the &quot;Wisconsin&quot; section: &quot;Menominee,&quot; a band named &quot;Misi&#x27;nimäk Kimiko Wini&#x27;niwuk, &#x27;Michilimackinac People,&#x27; near the old fort at Mackinac, Mich.&quot; Michillimackinac is also spelled as Mishinimakinago, Mǐshǐma‛kǐnung, Mi-shi-ne-macki naw-go, Missilimakinak, Teiodondoraghie.

The Menominee are descendants of the Late Woodland Indians who inhabited the lands once occupied by Hopewell Indians, the earliest human inhabitants of the Lake Michigan region. As the Hopewell culture declined, circa A.D. 800, the Lake Michigan region eventually became home to Late Woodland Indians.

Early fur traders, &quot;coureur-de-bois,&quot; and explorers from France encountered their descendants: the Menominee, Chippewa (Ojibwa), Ottawa, Potawatomi, Sauk, Fox, Winnebago, and Miami. It is believed that the French explorer Jean Nicolet was the first non-Native American to reach Lake Michigan in 1634 or 1638.

===First European encounter===

In 1634, the Menominee and Ho-Chunk people (along with a band of Potawatomi who had recently moved into Wisconsin) witnessed the French explorer Jean Nicolet&#x27;s approach and landing. Red Banks, near the present-day city of Green Bay, Wisconsin, later developed in this area. Nicolet, looking for a Northwest Passage to China, hoped to find and impress the Chinese. As the canoe approached the shore, Nicolet put on a silk Chinese ceremonial robe, stood up in the middle of the canoe and shot off two pistols.

Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix, a French Catholic clergyman, professor, historian, author and explorer, kept a detailed journal of his travels through Wisconsin and Louisiana. In 1721 he came upon the Menominee, whom he referred to as &quot;Malhomines&quot; (&quot;peuples d&#x27;avoines&quot; or Wild Oat Indians), which the French had adapted from an Ojibwe term:

After we had advanced five or six leagues, we found ourselves abreast of a little island, which lies near the western side of the bay, and which concealed from our view, the mouth of a river, on which stands the village of the Malhomines Indians, called by our French &quot;peuples d&#x27;avoines&quot; or Wild Oat Indians, probably from their living chiefly on this sort of grain. The whole nation consists only of this village, and that too not very numerous. &#x27;Tis really great pity, they being the finest and handsomest men in all Canada. They are even of a larger stature than the Potawatomi. I have been assured that they had the same original and nearly the same languages with the Noquets, and the Indians at the Falls.

===19th century===

Initially neutral during the War of 1812, the Menominee later became allied with the British and Canadians, whom they helped defeat American forces trying to recapture Fort Mackinac in the Battle of Mackinac Island. During the ensuing decades, the Menominee were pressured by encroachment of new European-American settlers in the area. Settlers first arrived in Michigan, where lumbering on the Upper Peninsula and resource extraction attracted workers. By mid-century, encroachment by new settlers was increasing. In the 1820s, the Menominee were approached by representatives of the Christianized Stockbridge-Munsee Indians from New York to share or cede some of their land for their use.

The Menominee gradually sold much of their lands in Michigan and Wisconsin to the U.S. government through seven treaties from 1821 to 1848, first ceding their lands in Michigan. The US government wanted to move them to the far west in the period when Wisconsin was organizing for statehood, to extinguish all Native American land claims. Chief Oshkosh went to look at the proposed site on the Crow River and rejected the offered land, saying their current land was better for hunting and game. The Menominee retained lands near the Wolf River in what became their current reservation. The tribe originated in the Wisconsin and are living in their traditional homelands.

==Menominee Indian Reservation==
The Menominee Indian Reservation is located in northeastern Wisconsin. For the most part, it is conterminous with Menominee County and the town of Menominee, which were established after termination of the tribe in 1961 under contemporary federal policy whose goal was assimilation. The tribe regained its federally recognized status and reservation in 1975.

The reservation was created in a treaty with the United States signed on May 12, 1854, in which the Menominee relinquished all claims to the lands held by them under previous treaties, and were assigned on the Wolf River in present-day Wisconsin. An additional treaty, which they signed on February 11, 1856, carved out the southwestern corner of this area to create a separate reservation for the Stockbridge and Lenape (Munsee) tribes, who had reached the area as refugees from New York state. The latter two tribes have the federally recognized joint Stockbridge-Munsee Community.

After the tribe had regained federal recognition in 1973, it essentially restored the reservation to its historic boundaries in 1975. Many small pockets of territory within the county (and its geographically equivalent town) are not considered as part of the reservation. These amount to 1.14% of the county&#x27;s area, so the reservation is essentially 98.86% of the county&#x27;s area. The largest of these pockets is in the western part of the community of Keshena, Wisconsin. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the combined Menominee reservation and off-reservation trust land have a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The small non-reservation parts of the county are more densely populated than the reservation, with 1,223 (28.7%) of the county&#x27;s 4,255 total population, as opposed to the reservation&#x27;s 3,032 (71.3%) population in the 2020 census.

The most populous communities are Legend Lake and Keshena. Since the late 20th century, the members of the reservation have operated a number of gambling facilities in these communities as a source of revenue. They speak English as well as their traditional Menominee language, one of the Algonquian languages. Current population of the tribe is about 8,700.

===Communities===
* Keshena (most, population 1,268)
* Legend Lake (most, population 1,525)
*Middle Village (part, population 281)
*Neopit (most, population 690)
*Zoar (most, population 98)

==Conflict over logging==
The Menominee have traditionally practiced logging in a sustainable manner. In 1905, a tornado swept through the reservation, downing a massive amount of timber. Because the Menominee-owned sawmills could not harvest all the downed timber before it decomposed, the United States Forest Service became involved in managing their forest. Despite the desire of the tribe and Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr. for sustainable yield policy, the Forest Service conducted clear-cutting on reservation lands until 1926, cutting 70 percent of the salable timber.

The Department of the Interior regained control of the territory, as it holds the reservation in trust for the Menominee. During the next dozen years, it reduced the cutting of salable timber to 30 percent, which allowed the forest to regenerate. In 1934, the Menominee filed suit in the United States Court of Claims against the Forest Service, saying that its policy had heavily damaged their resource. The court agreed and settled the claim finally in 1952, awarding the Menominee $8.5 million.

===20th-century termination era===

The Menominee were among the Native Americans who participated as soldiers in World War II with other United States citizens.

During the 1950s, federal Indian policy envisioned termination of the &quot;special relationship&quot; between the United States government and those tribes considered &quot;ready for assimilation&quot; to mainstream culture. The Menominee were identified for termination, which would end their status as a sovereign nation. At the time, the Klamath people in Oregon were the only other tribal group identified for termination. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) believed the Menominee were sufficiently economically self-reliant on their timber industry to be successful independent of federal assistance and oversight. Before termination, they were one of the wealthiest American Indian tribes.

In 1954, Congress passed a law which phased out the Menominee reservation, effectively terminating its tribal status on April 30, 1961. Commonly held tribal property was transferred to a corporation, Menominee Enterprises, Inc. (MEI). It had a complicated structure and two trusts, one of which, First Wisconsin Trust Company, was appointed by the BIA. First Wisconsin Trust Company always voted its shares as a block, and essentially could control the management operations of MEI.

At the request of the Menominee, the state organized the former reservation as a new county, so they could maintain some coherence. The tribe was expected to provide county government functions but it became a colony of the state.

The change resulted in diminished standards of living for the members of the tribe; officials had to close the hospital and some schools in order to cover costs of the conversion: to provide their own services or contract for them as a county. Menominee County was the poorest and least populated Wisconsin county during this time, and termination adversely affected the region. Tribal crafts and produce alone could not sustain the community. As the tax base lacked industry, the Menominee could not fund basic services. MEI funds, which totaled $10 million in 1954, dwindled to $300,000 by 1964. Struggling to manage financially, the white-dominated MEI proposed in 1967 to raise money by selling off former tribal lands to non-Native Americans, which resulted in a fierce backlash among the Menominee.

It was a period of Indian activism, and community members began an organizing campaign to regain political sovereignty as the Menominee Tribe. Activists included Ada Deer, an organizer who would later become an advocate for Native Americans at the federal level as Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs (1993–1997). In 1970 the activists formed a group called the Determination of Rights and Unity for Menominee Stockholders (DRUMS). They blocked the proposed sale of tribal land by MEI to non-Indian developers, and successfully gained control of the MEI board of directors. They also persuaded Congress to restore their status as a federally recognized sovereign tribe by legislation.

At the same time, President Richard Nixon encouraged a federal policy to increase self-government among Indian tribes, in addition to increasing education opportunities and religious protection. He signed the bill for federal recognition of the Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin on December 22, 1973. The sovereign tribe started the work of reorganizing the reservation, which they re-established in 1975. Tribal members wrote and ratified a tribal constitution in 1976, and elected a new tribal government, which took over from BIA officials in 1979.

===&quot;Menominee Tribe v. United States&quot; (1968)===

During the period of termination, when the Menominee individually were subject to state law, in 1963 three members of the tribe were charged with violating Wisconsin&#x27;s hunting and fishing laws on what had formerly been their reservation land for more than 100 years. The tribal members were acquitted. When the state appealed the decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee tribe no longer had hunting and fishing rights due to the termination act of Congress in 1954.

Due to the state court&#x27;s ruling, the tribe sued the United States for compensation for the value of the hunting and fishing rights in the U.S. Court of Claims, in &quot;Menominee Tribe v. United States&quot; (1968). The Court ruled that tribal members still had hunting and fishing rights, and that Congress had not abrogated those rights. The opposite rulings by the state and federal courts brought the issue to the United States Supreme Court.

In 1968 the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaties involved, and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Termination Act, as Congress had not clearly removed those rights in its legislation. This has been a landmark case in Indian law, helping preserve Native American hunting and fishing rights.

==Government==
The tribe operates according to a written constitution. It elects a tribal council and chairman.

The Menominee developed the College of Menominee Nation in 1993 and it was accredited in 1998. It includes a Sustainable Development Institute. Its goal is education to promote their ethic for living in balance on the land. It is one of a number of tribal colleges and universities that have been developed since the early 1970s, and one of two in Wisconsin.

==Current tribal activities==

The nation has a notable forestry resource and ably manages a timber program. In an 1870 assessment of their lands, which totaled roughly , they counted of timber. that has increased to . In the intervening years, they have harvested more than . In 1994, the Menominee became the first forest management enterprise in the United States certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC.org).

Since June 5, 1987, the tribe has owned and operated a Las Vegas-style gaming casino, associated with bingo games and a hotel. The complex provides employment to numerous Menominee; approximately 79 percent of the Menominee Casino-Bingo-Hotel&#x27;s 500 employees are ethnic Menominee or are spouses of Menominee.

<doc id="1235199" wikidata="Q263094" url="?curid=1235199" title="Elizabeth Stride">
<text>Elizabeth &quot;Long Liz&quot; Stride ( Gustafsdotter; 27 November 1843 – 30 September 1888) is believed to have been the third victim of the unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, who killed and mutilated at least five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London from late August to early November 1888.

Unlike the other four canonical Ripper victims, Stride had not been mutilated following her murder, leading some historians to suspect Stride had not actually been murdered by Jack the Ripper. However, Stride&#x27;s murder occurred less than one hour before the murder of the Ripper&#x27;s fourth canonical victim, Catherine Eddowes, within walking distance, and her act of murder is suspected to have been disturbed by an individual entering the crime scene upon a two-wheeled cart. In addition, both women had been murdered by slash wounds to the throat, leading most authors and researchers to consider Stride to be the third of the Ripper&#x27;s canonical five victims.

Stride was nicknamed &quot;Long Liz&quot;. Several explanations have been given for this pseudonym; some believe it sources from her married surname (a stride being a reference to a long step), while others believe this is a reference to either her height, or her general facial structure.

==Early life==
Stride was born Elisabeth Gustafsdotter on 27 November 1843 in Stora Tumlehed, a rural village within the parish of Torslanda, west of Gothenburg, Sweden. She was the second of four children born to Swedish farmer Gustaf Ericsson (age 32) and his wife Beata Carlsdotter (age 33). As a child, Gustafsdotter lived upon this village farm. All four children were raised in the Lutheran faith, and all were required to perform numerous chores upon the farm.
Gustafsdotter was confirmed at the Church of Torslanda on 14 August 1859 at the age of 15, with contemporary records indicating her biblical knowledge as being thorough. The following year, she chose to relocate from Stora Tumlehed to the city of Gothenburg in search of employment. Shortly thereafter, she obtained employment as a domestic worker in the Gothenburg parish of Carl Johan, being employed by a couple named Olofsson. This employment lasted until 2 February 1864, whereupon Gustafsdotter relocated to another district of Gothenburg, again securing employment as a domestic servant. She was between and in height and had curly dark brown hair, light grey eyes and a pale complexion.

Unlike the other canonical victims of the Whitechapel murders—at least three of whom resorted to prostitution due to poverty following failed marriages—Stride became a prostitute earlier in life. Gothenburg police records dating from March 1865 confirm her arrest upon this charge. She was treated at least twice for venereal disease. On 21 April 1865, Gustafsdotter gave birth to a stillborn girl.

==Relocation to London==
In February 1866, Gustafsdotter moved from Gothenburg to London. Her actual reason for relocating from Sweden to England is unknown, as she is known to have told acquaintances two differing stories as to why she relocated. To some, Gustafsdotter claimed she had relocated to England due to her employment in the domestic service of &quot;a gentleman&quot; who lived near Hyde Park; to others, Gustafsdotter claimed she had family in London and chose to visit her relatives in the city before opting to remain in England. Whatever the truth regarding Gustafsdotter&#x27;s decision to relocate to London, it is likely she funded this trip with the 65 kronor she inherited following the death of her mother in August 1864, and which she had received in late 1865.

Upon her arrival in London, Gusdafsdotter learned to speak both English and Yiddish in addition to her native language. She is also known to have briefly dated a policeman in the late 1860s.

==Marriage==
On 7 March 1869, Gustafsdotter married John Thomas Stride, a ship&#x27;s carpenter from Sheerness, who was 22 years her senior. They married in a modest ceremony at St Giles in the Fields Church. The couple had no children.

For several years after their marriage, the couple resided in East India Dock Road, operating a coffee shop in Poplar, east London. This business was initially located on Upper North Road before the establishment relocated to Poplar High Street in approximately 1871. Their income throughout this period was also supplemented by John Stride continuing his trade as a carpenter.

By 1874, the Strides&#x27; marriage had begun to deteriorate, although they continued to live together. The following year, John Stride sold the coffee shop, likely due to financial hardship.

===Separation===
In March 1877, Stride was admitted to the Poplar Workhouse, suggesting that the couple had separated by this date. However, census records from 1881 indicate the two had reunited and lived together in the district of Bow, although the couple had permanently separated by the end of that year, with Stride being admitted to a Whitechapel workhouse infirmary suffering from bronchitis in December 1881. She was discharged from this infirmary on 4 January 1882, and is believed to have taken residence in one of several common lodging-houses on Flower and Dean Street, Whitechapel, shortly thereafter. Two years later, on 24 October 1884, John Stride died of tuberculosis in the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum.
In the years following the collapse of her marriage and the death of her husband, Stride is known to have informed several individuals that her husband and two of her nine children had drowned in the 1878 sinking of the &quot;Princess Alice&quot; in the River Thames. According to Stride, she and her husband had been employed upon this steamer, although she had survived the accident by climbing the ship&#x27;s mast, but as she had done so, she had been kicked in the mouth by another survivor of the sinking, and this injury to her palate had caused a permanent stutter.

===Common lodging residences===
While residing in common lodging-houses, Stride occasionally received charitable assistance from the Church of Sweden in London, and from 1885 until her death lived much of the time with local dock labourer Michael Kidney, who resided in Devonshire Street. The couple had a tumultuous relationship and regularly separated, with Stride sleeping in local lodging houses before returning to live with Kidney. In April 1887, Stride filed a formal assault charge against Kidney, although she failed to pursue this charge in court and the case was discharged. Her relationship with Kidney continued in an on-and-off manner between 1885 and 1888. 

In addition to prostitution, Stride occasionally earned income from sewing and housecleaning. An acquaintance described her as having a calm temperament, though she appeared before the Thames Magistrates&#x27; Court on approximately eight occasions for both drunk and disorderly conduct and the use of obscene language, with the final occasion being on 3 September 1888. Occasionally, Stride used the alias Annie Fitzgerald at these hearings.

==1888==
Following an argument on 26 September 1888, Stride and Kidney again separated, and she again took residence at 32 Flower and Dean Street (then a notorious slum and criminal rookery), informing a fellow lodger named Catherine Lane she and Kidney &quot;had had a few words&quot;. Over the following days she regularly earned money by performing cleaning duties, both at the lodging house and for local residents, being observed by the housekeeper, Elizabeth Tanner, to be a quiet woman who occasionally performed cleaning work for the local Jewish community.

===29 September===
On the day prior to her murder, Stride is known to have cleaned two rooms at her lodging house, for which she was paid sixpence. That evening, she wore a black jacket and skirt, with a posy of a red rose in a spray of either maidenhair fern or asparagus leaves. Her outfit was complemented by a black crêpe bonnet. In an effort to make her clothing look more respectable, she is known to have borrowed a brush from a fellow resident. At 6:30 p.m., Stride and Elizabeth Tanner briefly visited the Queen&#x27;s Head pub on Commercial Street before Stride returned alone to the lodging house.

Subsequent eyewitness accounts of Stride&#x27;s movements later in the evening of 29 September and the early morning of 30 September indicate she may have been in the company of one or more acquaintances and/or clients. The first of these individuals is described as a short man with a dark moustache, wearing a morning suit and bowler hat, with whom she was seen at approximately 11:00 p.m. at a location close to Berner Street. A second eyewitness account by labourer William Marshall places Stride in the company of a man wearing a peaked cap, black coat and dark trousers standing on the pavement opposite number 58 Berner Street at approximately 11:45 p.m. According to Marshall, Stride had stood with this &quot;decently dressed&quot; individual, and the two had repeatedly kissed before the man had said to her: &quot;You would say anything but your prayers.&quot;

===30 September===
At 12:35 a.m., PC William Smith saw Stride with a man wearing a hard felt hat standing opposite the International Working Men&#x27;s Educational Club, a socialist and predominantly Jewish social club, at 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street) in Whitechapel. The man was carrying a package about 18 inches (45 cm) long. Having no reason to feel suspicious, Smith continued on his beat in the direction of Commercial Road. Between 12:35 a.m. and 12:45 a.m., dockworker James Brown saw a woman he believed to be Stride standing with her back against a wall at the corner of Berner Street speaking with a man of average build in a long black coat. Brown heard Stride say, &quot;No. Not tonight. Some other night.&quot;
==Murder==
Stride&#x27;s body was discovered at approximately 1:00 a.m. on Sunday 30 September 1888 in the adjacent Dutfield&#x27;s Yard by Louis Diemschutz, the steward of the International Working Men&#x27;s Educational Club. Diemschutz had driven into the poorly illuminated yard with his horse and two-wheeled cart, when his horse abruptly shied to the left to avoid what appeared to be a bundle lying upon the ground. Noting what he later described as a &quot;dark object&quot; lying on the ground, Diemschutz unsuccessfully attempted to lift the object with his whip handle before leaving his cart to inspect it. Upon lighting a match, Diemschutz saw a prone body. He immediately ran inside the club to check his wife was safe. After finding her safe and sound, he reported his discovery before the group promptly dispersed to seek help.

Blood was still flowing from a single knife wound inflicted to Stride&#x27;s neck and, although her hands were cold to the touch, other sections of her body were either slightly or &quot;quite&quot; warm. This suggests Stride was killed shortly before Diemschutz&#x27;s arrival in the yard. Several patrons of the Working Men&#x27;s Educational Club who had left the premises between 12:30 and 12:50 a.m., later informed police they had observed nothing amiss.

==Post-mortem==
The first doctor to arrive was Frederick William Blackwell. Police surgeon Dr George Bagster Phillips, who had examined the body of previous Whitechapel murder victim Annie Chapman, arrived about 10 minutes later. Phillips&#x27;s official post-mortem documents state:

Blackwell opined his belief that Stride&#x27;s murderer may have pulled her backwards onto the ground by her neckerchief (the bow of which was observed to be markedly tight) before cutting her throat. Phillips concurred with this opinion, stating that Stride had probably been lying on her back when she was killed by a single, swift slash wound from left to right across her neck, strongly indicating her murderer had been right-handed. Bruising on Stride&#x27;s chest suggested that she had been pinned to the ground prior to the wound to her neck being inflicted.

==Investigation==
Police searched the crime scene and interrogated everyone who had been at the International Working Men&#x27;s Educational Club, as well as all residents of the area.

Israel Schwartz told investigators he had seen Stride being attacked outside Dutfield&#x27;s Yard at approximately 12:45 a.m. by a man with dark hair, a small brown moustache and approximately 5 feet 5 inches in height. According to Schwartz, this man attempted to pull Stride onto the street before turning her around and shoving her to the ground. As Schwartz had observed this assault, Stride&#x27;s assailant shouted the word &quot;Lipski&quot; either to Schwartz himself or to a second man who had exited the club amidst this altercation and lit a pipe. Schwartz did not testify at the inquest on Stride, possibly because he was of Hungarian descent and spoke very little, if any, English. Ripper investigator Stephen Knight found Schwartz&#x27;s statement in case files in the 1970s. At approximately the same time, Stride (or a woman matching her description) was seen by James Brown rejecting the advances of a stoutish man slightly taller than her in the adjacent street to Berner Street (Fairclough Street). A note in the margin of the Home Office files on the case points out that there was sufficient time for Stride to meet another individual between her death and the latest sightings of her.

No money was found on or near Stride&#x27;s body. This indicated that her money could have been taken during or after the altercation witnessed by Israel Schwartz, or by her murderer if it were not the same person. It seemed she had willingly entered Dutfield&#x27;s Yard and had either encountered her murderer within or had walked there with the person before being attacked.

Mrs Fanny Mortimer, who lived two doors away from the club, had stood in Berner Street to listen to the communal singing at about the time Stride had been murdered, but had not seen anyone entering the yard or heard anything amiss. Mortimer did see a man with a shiny black bag race past, and this was reported widely in the press. However, one of the club&#x27;s members, Leon Goldstein, identified himself as the man Mortimer had seen and he was soon eliminated from the inquiry.

On 19 October, Chief Inspector Swanson reported that 80,000 leaflets appealing for information about the murder had been distributed around Whitechapel, noting that, among other lines of enquiry, some 2,000 lodgers had been interrogated or investigated in relation to her death.

===Reaction of Michael Kidney===
On 1 October, a drunken Michael Kidney walked into Leman Street police station and accused the police of incompetence, stating that had he been a policeman on duty in Berner Street during the murder, he would have shot himself.

Kidney has been suspected of being Stride&#x27;s murderer because of their turbulent relationship and because there is no record of his alibi. However, investigators appear to have eliminated Kidney from their inquiries.

The following year, Whitechapel Workhouse Infirmary records show Kidney visited three times: for syphilis in June 1889; for lumbago that August; and for dyspepsia in October. Kidney&#x27;s declining health and general distress in the year after Stride&#x27;s murder indicates a detrimental psychological and emotional reaction to her death.
==Inquest==
The inquest into Stride&#x27;s death was opened at the Vestry Hall, Cable Street, St George in the East on 1 October. This inquest was presided over by the Middlesex coroner, Wynne Edwin Baxter. The first day of the inquest heard testimony from three witnesses: two patrons of the International Working Men&#x27;s Educational Club who had been in the premises on the night of Stride&#x27;s murder, and Louis Diemschutz. The two patrons to testify—William Wess and Morris Eagle—each stated approximately 25 to 30 individuals had been in the club at the time of the discovery of Stride&#x27;s body, that they had heard nothing amiss while in the club, with Wess also stating Stride&#x27;s body could not have been in the location where Diemschutz had discovered her when he had left the premises at approximately 12:15 a.m. Diemschutz recounted his discovery of Stride&#x27;s body before informing the coroner the first medical personnel at the scene had arrived &quot;about twenty minutes&quot; after the police.

The second day of the inquest heard conflicting testimony as to the identity of the deceased. Although police were certain the woman was Stride, a Mrs Mary Malcolm swore the body was that of her sister, Elizabeth Watts. Physician and surgeon Frederick Blackwell said he had been summoned to the crime scene at precisely 1:16 a.m. on 30 September by a policeman, being joined by Dr Phillips approximately 20 minutes later. Blackwell testified blood was still flowing from Stride&#x27;s neck wound into a gutter and down a drain close to her feet, and that he estimated death had occurred &quot;from twenty minutes to half an hour&quot; prior to his arrival. As the blood vessels on only one side of Stride&#x27;s neck had been cut, with her carotid artery only partially severed, Blackwell stated her death would have occurred &quot;comparatively slowly&quot;, and that Stride would have been unable to cry for help.

===Character testimony===
On 3 October, the housekeeper of the common lodging-house Stride resided in at the time of her murder, Elizabeth Tanner, testified that Stride, who she knew as &quot;Long Liz&quot;, had lodged at 32 Flower and Dean Street &quot;on and off, for the last six years&quot;. Prior to 26 September, she &quot;had been away from my [lodging] house about three months&quot;. Tanner stated Stride had been a &quot;very quiet&quot; and sober woman. Tanner said that, although Stride had Swedish heritage, she had &quot;[spoken] English as well as an English woman&quot;. Stride had informed her that her husband and children had drowned in the 1878 &quot;Princess Alice&quot; paddle steamer sinking.

Charwoman Catherine Lane also testified she knew Stride as a Swede named Long Liz whom she had known for about six months. Lane said Stride had informed her shortly before her death that she had &quot;had a few words&quot; with her partner, and that this was the reason she was again taking residence at Flower and Dean Street. Stride had given Lane a large piece of green velvet as she left the lodging-house before her death, asking Lane to &quot;mind&quot; the garment until she returned.

On 3 October, Michael Kidney formally identified Stride&#x27;s body, stating the two had been in a relationship for &quot;nearly three years&quot;. He added that they had occasionally separated because of Stride&#x27;s heavy drinking, although she inevitably returned to him.

===Medical testimony===
Dr Phillips testified that the cause of death had been &quot;undoubtedly the loss of blood from the left carotid artery and the division of the windpipe.&quot; He firmly believed Stride had been &quot;seized by the shoulders and placed on the ground, and that [her] murderer was [kneeling to] her right side&quot; when he had inflicted the wound to her throat.

==Conclusion==
The inquest into Stride&#x27;s murder lasted five days, with the final day of hearings being adjourned until 23 October. This final day of the hearing saw three witnesses testify—all of whom provided testimony confirming the identity of the decedent.

At the conclusion of this final day of hearings, coroner Baxter stated his belief that Stride had been attacked in a swift, sudden manner, with her death undoubtedly being a homicide, and no known circumstances being available which could reduce the crime to one of manslaughter. The murderer could have taken advantage of the checked scarf Stride was wearing to grab her from behind before slitting her throat, as had earlier been suggested by Phillips. Baxter, however, thought the absence of a shout for assistance and the lack of obvious marks of a struggle indicated that Stride had willingly lain down on the ground before the wound had been inflicted. Stride was still clenching a packet of cachous in her left hand when she was discovered, indicating that she had not had time to defend herself and that the attack had been sudden.

In relation to the actual crime scene, Baxter noted the decedent had been attacked in the passageway leading into a courtyard in which several families resided in cottages located a matter of yards from where her body was discovered, and that although this location afforded darkness, it was unlikely the murderer would have selected the location on account of Dutfield&#x27;s Yard being an unfrequented location. Baxter further noted the windows of the International Working Men&#x27;s Educational Club had been open, and that both Stride and her assailant would undoubtedly have heard the patrons&#x27; singing and dancing.

With regard to the witness testimony pertaining to the man or men seen in Stride&#x27;s company in the two hours before the discovery of her body, Baxter stated many points of similarity had been given with regards to the physical description of the individual in her company, but also some of dissimilarity. However, Baxter stated these discrepancies did not conclusively prove there had been more than one man in the company of Stride between 11:00 p.m. and 12:45 a.m., but that the eyewitness descriptions suggested either that she had been in the company of a minimum of two men in her final hours, or that one or more eyewitness was mistaken in details of the description of the man he had seen.

Following a short deliberation, the jury, having been instructed to deliberate precisely how, when, and by what means Stride came about her death, returned a unanimous verdict: &quot;Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.&quot;

==Connection to Jack the Ripper==
Stride&#x27;s murder occurred in the midst of the spree of murders attributed to a serial offender known prior to her death as both the Whitechapel Murderer and Leather Apron, and due to a letter forwarded to Scotland Yard the day immediately prior to her death as Jack the Ripper. However, unlike at least three other murder victims then-ascribed to this perpetrator (each of whom had received extensive abdominal injuries in addition to one or more slash wounds across her neck), Stride had received no mutilation injuries, with her sole injury being a deep cut measuring two-and-a-half-inches beneath her jaw, which had severed her left carotid artery and trachea and had terminated beneath her right jaw.

As two other murders (those of Mary Ann Nichols and Annie Chapman) had occurred in the districts of Whitechapel and Spitalfields—both of which had been initially caused by knife wounds to the throat—within the previous month, Stride&#x27;s murder was added to the Whitechapel murders investigation, and was widely believed to have been perpetrated by the same killer. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride&#x27;s murder was unconnected to the other canonical murders This opinion is upon the basis that the body had not been subjected to any mutilation and that this murder was the only murder ascribed to Jack the Ripper to occur south of Whitechapel Road. Furthermore, it is believed that the blade used to cause the wound to Stride&#x27;s neck may have been shorter and of a different design than that used to murder and subsequently mutilate the other four canonical murder victims. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in this case distinctive enough to connect Stride&#x27;s murder with the two earlier Ripper murders, in addition to the murder of Catherine Eddowes later that same night.

The murder of Stride is regarded as one of the canonical Ripper killings due to numerous factors, including the general physical and lifestyle characteristics of the victim, the day of the week she had been murdered, the time of death, the murder location, and the method of her murder. It is suspected that when Stride&#x27;s murderer heard Diemschutz&#x27;s horse and two-wheeled cart approaching or entering Dutfield&#x27;s Yard, he ceased his attack. The killer may have still been inside Dutfield&#x27;s Yard upon Diemschutz&#x27;s approach, as the gate on Berner Street was the only point of entry. He may have escaped when Diemschutz entered the International Working Men&#x27;s Educational Club. Less than one hour later, Catherine Eddowes was murdered in Mitre Square, and both Stride and Eddowes had lived in Flower and Dean Street.

The deaths of Eddowes and Stride sent London into a renewed state of general panic, as this was the first occasion in which two murders ascribed to the Ripper had occurred in one night.
===Correspondence===

On 1 October, a postcard dubbed the &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard and also signed &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, was received by the Central News Agency. This letter claimed responsibility for the murders of both Stride and Eddowes, and described the killing of the two women as a &quot;double event&quot;; a designation which has endured. It has been argued that this postcard was mailed before the murders were publicised, making it unlikely that a crank would hold such detailed knowledge of the crime. However, the letter was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings had occurred; long after details of the murders were known by both journalists and residents of the area. Police officials later claimed to have identified a journalist as the author of the postcard, leading this letter to be dismissed as a hoax, an assessment shared by most Ripper historians.

Two weeks later, on 16 October, a parcel containing half a preserved human kidney, accompanied by a note, was received by the Chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, George Lusk. This note has become known as both the &quot;Lusk letter&quot; and the &quot;From hell&quot; letter, because of the return address used by the writer: &quot;From hell&quot;. The author of this letter claimed to have &quot;fried and ate&quot; the missing half of the human kidney. The handwriting and general style of this letter significantly differ from that of the &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard.

The section of kidney was taken to Dr Thomas Horrocks Openshaw at the nearby Royal London Hospital. He believed that the kidney was human and originated from the left side of the individual from whom it had been taken. Dr Openshaw also stated the organ had been preserved in spirits prior to postage.

Acting Commissioner of the City Police, Major Henry Smith, claimed in his memoirs that this kidney matched the one missing from the body of Catherine Eddowes, because the length of renal artery attached to the kidney matched the missing length from Eddowes&#x27;s body, and that the forensic examination conducted upon Eddowes&#x27;s body and the section of kidney revealed signs of Bright&#x27;s disease. Smith&#x27;s story is considered by some historians to be a dramatic recollection on his part.

==Other theories==
In his book &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot;, author Stephen Knight linked the prominent physician Sir William Gull to Stride on the basis that both were reported to carry grapes; a theory which another author, Martin Fido, has dismissed as a &quot;wild allegation&quot;.

A grocer named Matthew Packer is known to have implied to two private detectives employed by the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee named Le Grand and Batchelor that he had sold some grapes to Stride and her murderer shortly before her death. When interviewed by the police, Packer described the man he had seen as being aged between 25 and 30, slightly taller than Stride, and wearing a soft felt hat. Neither of Packer&#x27;s descriptions of this individual matched witness statements provided by other witnesses who may also have seen Stride with potential clients shortly before her murder. However, overall, the witness descriptions given to police of individuals seen either in the company of Stride or the vicinity of her murder differed significantly. Moreover, Packer is known to have also informed a police sergeant named Stephen White that he had closed his shop on the date of the murder without seeing any suspicious characters or activity.

At the inquest into Stride&#x27;s murder, pathologists had stated emphatically that the decedent had not held, swallowed or consumed grapes in the hours before her death. Both Blackwell and Phillips described the contents of Stride&#x27;s stomach as being &quot;cheese, potatoes and farinaceous powder&quot;.

Despite Packer&#x27;s self-contradictory statements, investigators did discover a single grape stalk in Dutfield&#x27;s Yard, and his story was reported in the &quot;London Evening News&quot; on 3 October. Nonetheless, the overall commander of the investigation into the Ripper murders, Chief Inspector Donald Swanson, is known to have stated that &quot;any statement [made by grocer Matthew Packer] would be rendered almost valueless as evidence&quot; and had likely been fabricated in order that Packer could sell his story to the press.

Further doubt is cast on the truthfulness of Packer&#x27;s accounts by the general character of Le Grand (also known as Charles Grand, Charles Grandy, Charles Grant, Christian Neilson, and Christian Nelson). This individual had accrued an extensive criminal record, which included assault on a prostitute and conviction for theft. He was convicted of conspiracy to defraud in 1889 and served two years&#x27; imprisonment. After his release, he was arrested while in possession of a revolver and charged with demanding money with menace; a crime for which he was sentenced to twenty years&#x27; imprisonment.
==Funeral==
Elizabeth Stride was buried on Saturday 6 October 1888 in the East London Cemetery, located within the east London district of Plaistow. Her funeral was attended by a small number of mourners, and the costs were provided at the expense of the parish by the undertaker, a Mr Hawkes.

Her headstone is inscribed with her name and the years of her birth and death.

<text>The EPC 2000 or European Patent Convention 2000 is the version of the European Patent Convention (EPC) as revised by the Act Revising the Convention on the Grant of European Patents signed in Munich on November 29, 2000. On June 28, 2001, the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation adopted the final new text of the EPC 2000. The EPC 2000 entered into force on December 13, 2007.

The EPC 2000 does not introduce any major changes in substantive patent law, except changes concerning novelty, industrial applicability and priority rights. The EPC 2000 is however a comprehensive revision introducing &quot;a considerable number of smaller amendments&quot;.

== Background ==

A diplomatic conference was held from 20 November to 29 November 2000 in Munich to revise the Convention on the Grant of European Patents of 5 October 1973, amongst other things to integrate in the EPC new developments in international law, especially those of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement) and of the Patent Law Treaty, and to add a level of judicial review of the Boards of Appeal decisions.

== Entry into force ==

Greece deposited its instrument of ratification on December 13, 2005, and was the fifteenth Contracting State to ratify or accede to the EPC 2000. In addition, since not all the contracting states had deposited their instruments of ratification or accession by September 30, 2007, the EPC 2000 entered into force on December 13, 2007.

A Contracting State that would not have ratified or acceded to the EPC 2000 at the time of its entry into force, i.e. on December 13, 2007, would have ceased to be party to the EPC as from that time. All Contracting States ratified in due time.

== Amendments ==
=== Prior art effect and double patenting ===
Under the EPC 1973, in order to preclude double patenting, the prior art effect of a first European patent application (a so-called &quot;conflicting patent application&quot;) filed before the filing date of a second European patent application, but published after said filing date, on the second application is limited to the designated states in common. 

In the EPC 2000, this provision, i.e. Article 54(4) EPC, has been deleted. This means in the EPC 2000 that &quot;any European application falling under
Article 54(3) EPC constitutes prior art with effect for all the EPC contracting states at the time of its publication.&quot; has been deleted following the deletion of Article 54(4).

The deleted Article 54(4) EPC remains applicable to the European patents granted before December 13, 2007 and the European patent applications pending on December 13, 2007. In other words, Art. 54(4) EPC 1973 is still transitionally applicable.

This amendment along with the absence of a transitional provision for Rule 23a (providing that Rule 23a EPC 1973 would continue to apply for pending applications or granted patents at the date of entry into force of the EPC 2000) has raised concerns that, &quot;if the provisions of the EPC 2000 are interpreted strictly&quot;, patent rights existing at the date of entry into force of the EPC 2000 may become invalid after the entry into force of the EPC 2000, on December 13, 2007. In September 2007, the European Patent Office published a notice indicating that &quot;the provisions currently laid down in Article 54(3) and (4) in conjunction with Rule 23a EPC 1973 will continue to apply to European patent applications filed and patents granted before the entry into force of the EPC 2000&quot;.

=== Requirements for obtaining a date of filing ===
The requirements to obtain a date of filing (for a European patent application), laid out in Article 80, have been amended. A reference is now made to the Implementing Regulations, which are now in line with &quot;the worldwide standard laid out in Article 5 of the Patent Law Treaty 2000 (PLT)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;4/2007-84-1&quot;&gt; OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 84, item 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Rule 40 EPC 2000 is relevant. There is no requirement anymore to file claims to obtain a date of filing.&lt;ref name=&quot;4/2007-84-2&quot;&gt; OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 84, item 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the description may be filed in any language. Among the requirements, a reference to a previously filed application may also be used to obtain a date of filing. Furthermore, filing by reference to a previously filed application may incorporate the claims of the previously filed application.

From December 13, 2007 to December 19, 2008, &quot;54 applications [have] been received with a later date of receipt of claims than the original application date. Sixty-one invitations to file claims have been prepared for other applications missing the date of receipt of claims. The possibility to replace descriptions and drawings with a reference to a previously filed application was used by applicants 391 times (usually for divisional applications) during the year following the entry into force of the EPC 2000, &quot;accounting for 0.6 % of all direct European filings.&quot;

=== Priority rights extended to first filing in WTO members ===
The priority rights are extended to filing in or for any member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), in addition to any state party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. This amendment has been made to align the European Patent Convention with Article 2 of the TRIPS Agreement.

=== Legal remedies ===
Extensive changes were also made to the possibilities for the legal remedy of the failure to observe various time limits within the European patent system. Most particularly, the failure to pay various fees (filing fee, designation fee, search fee and examination fee) were, until the coming into force of the EPC 2000, excluded from the standard legal remedies of further processing and re-establishment of rights. Under the EPC 1973, the failure to observe the time limits for paying these fees could only be remedied by strict grace periods. These grace periods have now been replaced by the application of further processing and, if the further processing time limit is missed, re-establishment of rights, which although not directly applicable to the time limit missed originally, is applicable to the failure to observe the time limit for further processing. 

One of the biggest changes, was to allow the excuse of the failure to observe the 12 month priority period. If this period is missed, this failure can be remedied by a request for re-establishment of rights filed within 2 months of the expiry of the priority period (in most other cases, the request for re-establishment must be filed within two months of the removal of the impediment to completing the act in question on time, up to a maximum of 12 months). This is provided that the failure to observe the original period was despite the applicant having taken all due care (i.e. the applicant has a legitimate reason for missing the deadline). There is some uncertainty as to whether this is an aggregate time limit or a unitary time limit, which can make difference of up to several days as to when it expires.

=== Requests for limitation or revocation ===

Article 105a(1) EPC 2000 introduces a procedure for centrally limiting or revoking a European patent. A request for limitation or revocation may be filed at any time throughout the term of the European patent.

=== Petition for review ===

Article 112a EPC 2000 introduces a procedure for contesting the decisions of the boards of appeal by filing a petition for review. The petition for review can only be based on a fundamental procedural defect and its purpose is not to obtain a review of the application of substantive law. The petition is in fact a restricted form of judicial review, limited to examining serious errors of procedure which might have been committed by the Legal or Technical Boards of Appeal, prejudicing the right to a fair hearing of one or more appellants. Previously it was not possible for a party who did not have his requests granted in an appeal to challenge the final decision of the Legal or Technical Board of Appeal on any grounds.

The first petitions for review included &quot;R1/08&quot; (application no 97600009), &quot;R2/08&quot; (application no 00936978), &quot;R3/08&quot; (application no 01943244) and &quot;R4/08&quot; (application no 98116534). The first allowable petition for review was decision R 7/09, for a fundamental violation of .

== Transitional provisions ==
According to Article 7(1) of the Act revising the European Patent Convention of 29 November 2000,

Pursuant to Article 7(1) and (2) of the Act revising the EPC of 29 November 2000, the Administrative Council decided on 28 June 2001 to adopt a certain number of exceptions (&quot;unless otherwise decided by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation&quot;). Amongst these exceptions (as laid out in Article 1.1 of the Administrative Council&#x27;s decision of 28 June 2001), Articles 106 and 108 EPC are said to apply to all European patent applications pending at the time of the entry into force of the EPC 2000. However, the Legal Board of Appeal in case J 10/07 decided, in order to reflect the intention and purpose of those transitional provisions, to apply Articles 106 and 108 as applicable before the entry into force of the EPC 2000 (i.e. Articles 106 and 108 EPC 1973) to a pending European patent application.

<text>Stanley J. Aronoff (June 8, 1932 – January 31, 2024) was an American politician of the Republican Party who served for a time as president of the Ohio Senate. 

==Biography==
Stanley J. Aronoff was born on June 8, 1932. He was raised in a Jewish family in the North Avondale neighborhood of Cincinnati and attended high school at Walnut Hills High School. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a law degree from Harvard University, after which he returned to Cincinnati to enter into the private practice of law.

In 1960, Ambrose Lindhorst (the head of the Hamilton County Republican Party), Walton Bachrach (mayor of Cincinnati), and Republican operative George Eyrich persuaded Aronoff to run for a seat in the Ohio General Assembly. He began serving in the Ohio House of Representatives in 1961 and was re-elected twice, serving until 1967.

In 1966, Aronoff won a seat in the Ohio Senate. He was reelected in 1968 and 1972. In the 1974 primary election, he made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for Ohio Attorney General. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1976.

In 1978, Aronoff sought the party&#x27;s nomination for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, but party bosses endorsed television news broadcaster Thearon &quot;Tom&quot; Atkins instead. It was suspected, with the Jewish Bill Gradison already representing the Hamilton County Republican Party in Congress, that party leaders shied away from endorsing another Jew for Cincinnati&#x27;s other congressional seat. Nevertheless, Aronoff prevailed in the Republican primary, but lost narrowly in the general election to Democrat Tom Luken.

By the 1980 elections, the Republican party achieved a majority in the Ohio Senate, and Aronoff was named chairman of the Finance Committee. However, the party was again in the minority two years later. In the 1984 campaign, Aronoff&#x27;s success at fundraising was key to the Republican recapture of the Senate. The Senate Republican leader was Paul Gillmor; when Gillmor won a seat in Congress in 1988, Aronoff became President of the state Senate.

In 1995, Aronoff—and other legislators, including former Democratic Ohio House of Representatives Speaker Vern Riffe—was investigated for the misdemeanor of accepting multiple low fees from more than one source for the same event in order to avoid disclosure (&quot;fee pancaking&quot;, like a stack of pancakes); the law required that legislators disclose the acceptance of any speaking fee exceeding US$500. Aronoff was indicted and pleaded guilty to not disclosing $4,500 in fees for the same speech accepted from various arms of The Limited company. He was sentenced to community service, which he fulfilled by giving lectures to students on government ethics.

In 1996 Aronoff retired from public service. He was connected with the law firm of Aronoff, Rosen and Hunt, established in 1928 by Irwin I. Aronoff.

Aronoff died on January 31, 2024, at the age of 91.

Small Bassa communities are also found in Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast.

The Bassa speak the Bassa language, a Kru language that belongs to the Niger-Congo family of languages. They had their own pictographic writing system but it went out of use in the 19th century, was rediscovered among the slaves of Brazil and the West Indies in 1890s, and reconstructed in early 1900 by Thomas Flo Darvin Lewis. The revived signs-based script is called &quot;Ehni Ka Se Fa&quot;.

In local languages, the Bassa people are also known as Gboboh, Adbassa or Bambog-Mbog people.

==History==

The linguistic evidence and oral traditions of these geographically diverse, small yet significant group suggests that their name &quot;Bassa&quot; may be related to &quot;Bassa Sooh Nyombe&quot; which means &quot;Father Stone&#x27;s people&quot;. Early European traders had trouble pronouncing the entire phrase, and the shorter form Bassa has been used in Western literature ever since.

The Dan people, neighbors of the Bassa in Liberia, were especially attracted to brass jewelry. Dan women wore significant amounts of brass jewelry, as the amount of brass was directly correlated to their husband&#x27;s wealth. Many Dan women would wear several pairs of anklets and bracelets that could weigh up to 8 pounds each. Until brass jewelry was banned in the late 1930s by Liberia&#x27;s minister of health, Rudolf Fuszek, that claimed the brass jewelry was the cause of chafing infections and orthopedic problems. The sudden surplus of brass would be melted down and recast for other purposes. The Bassa people are likely responsible for producing some of these new uses for brass among the Dan. they were miniature brass cast masks called &quot;ma go,&quot; or &quot;small head&quot;.

== Society ==
The Bassa people are traditionally settled farmers who grow yam, cassava, eddoes and plantain. They are a lineage-linked independent clans who live in villages, each with a chief.

The Bassa people, before colonial occupation, had populations with occupational categories of farmers, barterers / traders, and lagoon fishermen. As well as a set of categories that had hierarchies based on practitioner skill, consisting of blacksmiths, carvers, weavers, potters, and other craftsmen.

The Bassa people acquired the &quot;Port Society&quot; and &quot;&quot;Gree-Gree&quot; bush&quot; traditions of education and initiation of children, from their neighboring &quot;Dei&quot; and &quot;Kpelle&quot; tribes.

The Bassa people are among those that practice the woman initiation society called Sande. (Also referred to as Bondo). The Sande / Bondo sub-culture is believed to be originated from the Mende people. The practice Sande (or Bondo), which consist of rituals involving special helmet / masks that some practicing cultures called &quot;Sowei / sowo.&quot; The masks themselves are not named, and Sowei / sowo refers to the title of the association official that wears the helmet mask. These type of masks are made by numerous cultures leading to some distinction in style, but the purpose of the helmet mask is always a representation of a primordial ancestor spirit that originates from a body of water during a sacred journey by a member or official.

==Religion==
The traditional religion of the Bassa people has a moral and ethical foundation, one that reveres ancestors and supernatural spirits. 

The Sande / Bondo helmet masks, worn by a society official during special ceremonies, represent the idealized beauty of a female primordial ancestor spirit, believed to reside in bodies of water.

Christianity arrived among the Bassa people during the colonial era, and the first Bible was translated into Bassa language in 1922. The adoption process fused the idea of Christian God with their traditional idea of a Supreme Being and powerful first ancestor who is merciful and revengeful, rewarding the good and punishing the bad. The traditional religion has included secret rites of passage for men and women, such as the Sande society.

The introduction of Christianity created a division between the inland Forest Bassa that maintained Bassa traditional practices and rituals, and the Coastal Bassa, that converted to Christianity.

Numerous missionaries from different denominations of Christianity have been active among the Bassa people during the 20th century. These has led to many Bassa independent churches from Europe, North America, Africa and Evangelical movements. In contemporary times, the Bassa people predominantly practice Christianity, but they have retained elements of their traditional religion.

== Village Layout and Architecture ==
Inland Forest Bassa took extra consideration to the location and layout of villages. The choice of location is determined by simple factors, access to fresh water, good farmland, and the presence of certain reeds for use as roofing material.

The layout of the village appears to be disorganized clusters of huts placed seemingly at random but is actually very intentional. The village layout is arranged in such a way, looking in any direction one&#x27;s line of sight is interrupted by huts, this inability to get bearings as an outsider is specifically for spies and attackers, as they would get lost easily, giving the Bassa, familiar with their own village an advantage. A Bassa village with this layout lacks any sort of main road and do include several empty &#x27;lots&#x27; making traveling through the village intentionally difficult and confusing for outsiders.

== Art ==
During the late 1930s, the brass jewelry the Dan wore was banned, the surplus brass from the jewelry was melted down and recast for other things. One of those things were created by the Bassa for the Dan. Those were &quot;ma go,&quot; &quot;small head&quot;, miniature masks that featured protruding open lips, flared nostrils, and pierced slit eyes, as well as a tattoo pattern from forehead to chin.

Another brass work of the Bassa people is the Brass Finial. the Brass Finial is an iron rod that had brass cast over it. the top of the staff features a woman&#x27;s head, with five rows of hair that run from front to back, as well as an encircling herringbone pattern. According to Bassa legend, the staff was the walking stick of a mythical ancestor by the name of &quot;Sma Vlen.&quot; Who was believed to have migrated towards the coast during the 16th century.

Bassa Masks were wood carved and are distinguished from neighboring peoples own masks through a style that gives the masks angular faces. With the mask, the wearer would also wear a braided bonnet, fastened at an angle to the forehead.

Other Bassa Masks have perorated eyes but are not worn directly on the face of the performer, but rather fastened to the forehead area of a weaved basket that is worn by the performer.

Bassa Masks have a hierarchy based on the purpose that each mask is meant to fulfill, whether it be private or for a ritual. One type of Bassa masks are made with the intent of projecting reverence and fear with monstrous face with protruding eyes, swollen lips and contorted human and animal features. These masks depict the likeness of spirits from the darkest parts of the forest.

The next type of mask are the portrait masks created exclusively by skilled carvers following tribal sculptural laws passed down by masters of the craft for generations. These masks are made to embody the defined concepts of beauty, within this category are ancestor masks, meant to give leniency, be at peace, and promise peace to heirs. these masks are deliberately made to not resemble specific individuals.

An exception to the making of a mask that resembles a specific individual came when there was a need to accustom the people of a village to the disfigurement of someone. A mask in their likeness was made and used by a performer that danced with crowds and told jokes, giving the features of the individual&#x27;s disfigurement positive association, as part of deliberate act of social to prevent a member of the village from becoming an outcast.

Another type of portrait masks, known in English as &quot;devil&quot; masks are worn by soothsayers and various performers like acrobats and jugglers, and said wearers are agents of social control.

<doc id="1235261" wikidata="Q3544370" url="?curid=1235261" title="USS Worden (DD-16)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Worden&quot; (DD-16) was a in the United States Navy. She was named for Admiral John Lorimer Worden. It was the first US ship equipped with a stabilizer.

==Built in Sparrows Point, Maryland==
&quot;Worden&quot; was laid down at Sparrows Point, Maryland, on 13 November 1899 by the Maryland Steel Company; launched on 15 August 1901; sponsored by Mrs. Daniel F. Worden, the daughter-in-law of Rear Admiral Worden; and commissioned on 17 March 1903.

==Pre-World War I==
&quot;Worden&quot; passed her final acceptance test on 18 July and began duty with the 2nd Torpedo Flotilla, based at Norfolk, Virginia. For more than four years, she remained a unit of the 2nd Torpedo Flotilla and conducted operations along the eastern seaboard from Maine south to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Annually, she participated in the Fleet maneuvers held in the warm waters of the Caribbean.

On 18 November 1907, the warship was placed in reserve at the Norfolk Navy Yard. As a unit of the Reserve Torpedo Flotilla, she was berthed first at Norfolk and, later, at Charleston, South Carolina. Save for a six-month interlude from May to November 1909 when she was returned to full commission, &quot;Worden&quot; remained inactive until 1912. Then, though still in reserve, she was loaned to the Pennsylvania Naval Militia for training purposes and was stationed at Philadelphia until returned to Charleston and the Reserve Torpedo Flotilla the following year.

Sometime in 1914, the torpedo-boat destroyer became a tender to the Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force and continued to operate in support of submarines until sometime in March 1917 when she was sent to New York on special duty in connection with a recruiting campaign necessitated by the probability that the United States would enter World War I. In June, she was reassigned back to her own type command as a unit of Division B, Destroyer Force; however, she continued her recruiting duty at New York through the end of the year.

==World War I==
On 16 January 1918, &quot;Worden&quot; got underway for Europe in company with , , , and . She steamed with them - via Bermuda - to Ponta Delgada in the Azores, where she arrived on 29 January. There, &quot;Worden&quot; and &quot;Stewart&quot; parted company with the other three warships and were put to sea again on 4 February to continue on to the French coast. They reached Brest on the 9th and soon thereafter began escorting coastal convoys and hunting for enemy U-boats. During the remaining nine months of World War I, &quot;Worden&quot; maintained a grueling schedule escorting convoys between ports on the French coast.

==Inter-war period==
On 18 December 1918, about five weeks after the 11 November armistice, she stood out of Brest in company with , &quot;Stewart&quot;, and to return home. Following refueling and provisioning stops in the Azores and at Bermuda, she and her traveling companions arrived at Philadelphia on 3 January 1919. She remained in commission for a little over six months, probably at Philadelphia. In any event, &quot;Worden&quot; was placed out of commission there on 13 July, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September. In 1920, on the first anniversary of her return home, 3 January, she was sold to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company of Philadelphia for conversion to mercantile service.

&quot;Worden&quot; retained her former name while in mercantile service. On 1 May 1942, she was steaming off the Florida coast when the nearby British freighter &quot;La Paz&quot;, en route from Liverpool, England, and Hampton Roads, VA, to Valparaiso, Chile, was torpedoed by the German submarine U-109 (Kapitänleutnant Heinrich Bleichrodt). Worden stood by the damaged vessel and towed her toward Jacksonville. Although Bleichrodt claimed both ships as sunk, &quot;Worden&quot; with a torpedo meant for &quot;La Paz&quot;, both ships survived, &quot;La Paz&quot; salvaged and resuming service, the fruit carrier continuing in that trade into the post-war period.

* Lieutenant commander Oscar C. Badger II (August 1918-October 1918) (Later Admiral)

<doc id="1235263" wikidata="Q5294581" url="?curid=1235263" title="Don Pease">
<text>Donald James Pease (September 26, 1931 – July 28, 2002) was an American politician. He served eight terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio&#x27;s 13th District, an area in northeast Ohio. He was a Democrat.

== Education and early life ==
Pease was born in Toledo, Ohio. He attended Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, supporting himself through college by working summers as a laborer at a Toledo oil refinery. Pease was the president of the student body, the editor of the student newspaper (The &quot;Post&quot;), and a student reporter for the &quot;Athens Messenger.&quot; He was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He graduated from Ohio University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism in 1953. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in government from Ohio University in 1955 and completed graduate work as a Fulbright Scholar at King&#x27;s College, Durham University.

After serving two years in the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957, Pease moved to Oberlin, Ohio. Pease became editor and copublisher of the weekly local newspaper, &quot;Oberlin News-Tribune.&quot; He was a member of the International Society of Weekly Newspaper Editors (ISWNE), winning ISWNE&#x27;s Golden Quill Award for editorial writing in 1962 and serving as president of the Society in 1965.

== Political career ==

Pease&#x27;s political career began with his election to the Oberlin City Council in 1961. He served in the Ohio Senate from 1965 to 1967. In 1968, he was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served from 1969 to 1975. In 1974, he was again elected to the Ohio Senate, where he served from 1975 to 1977.

Early in his career, Pease established a reputation for honesty and integrity, which he maintained throughout his political career. Pease was a member of the Democratic Party and was regarded as a liberal (supporting progressive tax reform, advocating for universal human rights, linking respect for internationally recognized worker rights to international trade, aid, and investment agreements, upholding civil liberties, emphasizing education reform, and other liberal causes). He was well respected as a reasonable and ethical public servant, even by his conservative colleagues, who saw him as a &quot;straight arrow.&quot;

In 1976, Pease was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives (95th Congress). He served eight terms in Congress, easily winning all eight elections in the Democratic-leaning 13th Congressional District of Ohio. His long-time Chief of Staff and Legislative Director was Bill Goold whom Pease had hired upon his graduation from Oberlin College.

== Uganda trade ban ==
Pease quickly distinguished himself as a skillful legislator and staunch human rights advocate. Over the opposition of the Carter Administration, Pease, in his first term of Congress, sponsored legislation, which passed, to cut off US trade with Uganda, which was enduring a brutal reign of terror at the hands of the infamous dictator Idi Amin in which at least 500,000 Ugandans perished.

Within months of the establishment of the enactment of the trade ban, Amin was deposed. The trade ban resulted in the sudden loss of hundreds of million of dollars in hard currency to Amin, mostly from coffee exports to the US, which had been used by Amin to buy arms, luxury goods, and the loyalty of his mercenary army. It is widely considered one of the best examples of the most effective uses of economic sanctions in modern US foreign policy.

== Trade-linked workers&#x27; rights ==
Pease was the legislative champion of the rapidly growing movement inside and outside of Congress in the early 1980s to link respect for internationally recognized workers&#x27; rights, such as prohibiting exploitative child labor in the production of products for export, to international trade, investment and aid agreements to which the US is a party. He successfully authored six different laws in this regard before he left Congress.

== Tax legislation ==
Pease authored controversial legislation within the United States Internal Revenue Code (income tax code) that partially disallowed itemized deductions for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes above certain thresholds, known as the &quot;Pease Limitations.&quot;

== Later life ==
Pease decided not to run for re-election in 1992. After leaving Congress, he taught as Visiting Distinguished Professor of Politics at Oberlin College. He was also appointed by Bill Clinton to the Amtrak Board of Directors and served five years.

Pease married Jeanne Camille Wendt August 29, 1953, who still resides in Oberlin. One daughter, Jennifer, was born on August 30, 1964.

Pease died in Oberlin, July 28, 2002.

<doc id="1235268" wikidata="Q2685427" url="?curid=1235268" title="Tree-topper">
<text>A tree-topper or treetopper is a decorative ornament placed on the top (or &quot;crown&quot;) of a Christmas tree or Chrismon tree. Tree-toppers come in many forms, with the most common being a star (representing the Star of Bethlehem) or an angel (representing the Angel Gabriel), both from the Nativity. Additional forms range from a Christian cross, white dove, , ribbon bow, Father Christmas or Santa Claus.

Tree-toppers may be made of a wide range of materials. Modern plastic tree-toppers are often electric and, once connected with the tree&#x27;s lights, offer a gentle glow. Following World War II, various symbols of Christmastide, such as stars, were introduced as electrified tree-toppers. The tradition of using a symbol representing the Star of Bethlehem as a tree-topper, however, dates as early as the 1840s.

==Origin and use==
The use of a Christmas angel as a tree-topper represents the angel Gabriel from the Nativity of Jesus:

Use of a star represents the Star of Bethlehem:

During the 1870s, in conjunction with the growing power of the British Empire, the Union Jack became another popular tree-topper among some persons.

==Popular culture==
Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s 1844 short story, &quot;The Fir-Tree&quot;, describes the decoration of a Christmas tree in Denmark, including its topper:

The use of a tree-topper is also depicted in Christmas songs, with lines such as &quot;Först en stjärna utav gull&quot; and &quot;So hang a shining star upon the highest bough&quot;.

<doc id="1235269" wikidata="Q367354" url="?curid=1235269" title="Thalassery">
<text>Thalassery (), formerly Tellicherry (colonial name), is a city and municipality on the Malabar Coast in Kannur district in the state of Kerala, India, bordered by the districts of Mahe and Kozhikode. Thalassery municipality has a population of just under 100,000 as of 2011 census. Thalassery Heritage City has an area of . Thalassery has an altitude ranging from above mean sea-level. It is located 25 km (15 mi) from Vadakara, 15 km (10 mi) from Mahé and 22 km (13 mi) from Kannur. 

Tellicherry municipality was formed on 1 November 1866 according to the Madras Act 10 of 1865 (Amendment of the Improvements in City act 1850) of the British Indian Empire, making it the second oldest municipality in the state. At that time, the municipality was known as Tellicherry Commission and Tellicherry was the capital of North Malabar. G. M. Ballard, the Malabar collector, was the first president of the municipal commission. A European barrister, A. F. Lamaral, would later become the first Chairman of Thalassery municipality. Thalassery grew into a prominent place during European rule, due to its strategic geographic location. Thalassery has played a significant historical, cultural, educational and commercial role in the history of India, especially during the colonial period. On 9 February 2014, Thalassery taluk was split in two and Iritty taluk was formed. The northeastern hilly region of the former Thalassery Taluk, including Peravoor, Aralam, Ayyankunnu, Kottiyoor, and Kelakam, are within the Iritty Taluk area.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Thalassery&quot; likely originated from a combination of the Dravidian words &quot;Thala&quot; (Head) and &quot;cheri&quot; (low lying settlement), meaning &#x27;starting place of a settlement&#x27; or &#x27;head of a settlement&#x27;. It could also have emerged from &quot;Talakkathe cheri&quot;, a combination of &quot;Talakkathe&quot; (upper or north) and &quot;Cheri&quot; (settlement).

The second volume of the 1885 administration manual of the former Madras Presidency cites, which includes information on the research of regional legends and folklore, indicates that the name &quot;Thalassery&quot; in ancient Sanskrit literature was Shwetaranyapura.

==Modern history==

Thalassery was a trade hub where Dutch, British, Portuguese, Chinese, Arab, and Jewish traders had considerable influence in the spice market.

The British established a trading post and built a factory at Tellicherry in 1694, having gained permission from Vadakkalankur, the prince regent of the Raja of Kolathunad. They had already been trading on the Malabar coast for much of that century, buying pepper from merchants, and had established a similar post at Travancore ten years earlier.

In 1761, the British captured Mahe, which lies adjacent to Thalassery, and the settlement was handed over to the ruler of Kadathanadu. The British restored Mahe to the French as a part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris. In 1779, the Anglo-French war broke out, resulting in the French loss of Mahe. In 1783, the British agreed to restore to the French their settlements in India, and Mahe was handed over to the French in 1785.

After the annexation of Malabar, the British called upon Thalassery, the royal families and other major Nair and Namboothiri feudal lords to return, but this was heavily opposed by some local rulers. Along with heavy taxation and laws that curbed free movement, the appeal resulted in multiple uprisings against the British with heavy casualties to British forces. Thousands of soldiers were killed, but the resistance was eventually defeated.

==Geography==
Thalassery lies on the west coast of the Indian subcontinent, in the northern part of Kerala State. The city has Dharmadam Panchayat in the north, Eranholi and Kodiyeri in the east New Mahe in the south and the Arabian Sea on the west. The palm-fringed terrain has a scenic coastline and features four rivers, canals and hills with orange-hued rock. One of the four rivers is the Mahe River (Mayyazhipuzha). During the British Raj, the Mahe River was nicknamed the English Channel because it separated British-ruled Thalassery from French-ruled Mahe. Other rivers are Kuyyali River, Ummanchira River and Anjarakandi River. Muzhappilangad Beach, the sole beach where driving is possible in Kerala (with a 4 km long drivable area), is located within 6 km from the downtown part of Thalassery.

Unlike southern Kerala, the region of Thalassery does not have lagoons, although many rivers flow through it. Thalassery however has a large area of mangroves, which is now being protected. The coast has no delta formation. The coastal plain is only a few kilometres in width and is bordered by highlands. The north of Thalassery is Dharmadam, an island area surrounded by two rivers and the sea. On the eastern side, hilly areas start from Kuthuparamba.

==Demographics==
As of the 2001 India census, Thalassery had a population of 92,558, making it Kerala&#x27;s eighth largest city in population. Males constituted 47% of the population and females 53%. The city had an average literacy rate of 86%, higher than the national average of 59.5%. Both male and female literacy were 86%. In Thalassery, 10% of the population were under 6 years of age.

The Thalassery urban agglomeration consists of the Thalassery municipality and panchayaths of Eranholi, Kadirur, Dharmadam, Muzhappilangad, Pinarayi and New Mahe with a present population of around 300,000.

Hindus made up 61.37% of the population, followed by Muslims (34.30%), and Christians (3.64%).

==Culture==
Thalassery is nicknamed the city of three Cs -- Cake, Cricket and Circus. The first bakery in Kerala was established in the city and cricket was first played in India here. The British had considerable impact on local culture. As an ancient trade center, the trading and business relations that existed with the Europeans and the Arabs brought people and ideas from many other lands. The European Christian missionaries and the educational reforms they brought played an important role in transforming society.

The Government of Kerala has included Thalassery in its heritage city project. The project includes the preservation of historical structures.
Thalassery cuisine (a blend of Arabian, Persian, Indian and European styles of cooking) is popular around the world. Thalassery biryani is popular as an ethnic brand, and Tellicherry pepper is also used in Europe.

Painting and sculpture exhibitions are frequently held at the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi art gallery located in Keezhantimukk, Thiruvangad. 

===Theyyam===
Theyyam (or Thirayattam) is a ritual performance art form that depict the cultural heritage of North Malabar, especially of ancient Kolathunad. Theyyam depicts Shiva bhutaganas, Kali and other deities and cultural heroes and ancestors of the region. The drama is enacted based on ancient stories and the language used is &quot;Tottam pattu&quot;, north Malabar dialect of Malayalam. Theyyam is usually held from October to May every year. The colour of Theyyam, is typically red. Velan, a reporter and prophet endowed with supernatural powers in Veriyatal is described in the Sangam literature 500 CE. It could have been a tribal ritual art which evolved under Buddhism and the Brahminic revival of Hinduism. This art form is called, variously, &quot;Kaliyattom&quot; or &quot;Theyyam&quot; or &quot;Tirayattom&quot;, depending on the locality.

==Literature and journalism==

The first Malayalam short story Vasanavikriti was written by Vengayil Kunhiraman Nayanar in Thalassery. Indulekha, the first major Malayalam novel was published from Thalassery. Veenapoovu, the poem by Kumaran Asan was also published from Thalassery. Thinker and orator M N Vijayan spent a lifetime in Thalassery. Thalassery is also home to writer N. Prabhakaran. Actor and screenwriter Sreenivasan hails from Thalassery.

William Logan was said to be fluent in Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu. He is remembered for his 1887 guide to the Malabar District, popularly known as the &quot;Malabar Manual&quot;.

Rajyasamacharam and Paschimodayam (the first two Malayalam newspapers) were published from Illikunnu, Nettoor in Tellicherry in 1847 by Hermann Gundert, who was the editor of the journal and was a religious propagator from the Basel Evangelical Mission Society (BEMP). Rajyasamacharam started publishing from Illikkunnu in Thalassery City.

==Circus==
Vishnu Pant Chhatre&#x27;s Great Indian Circus, established in 1880 in Bombay, was the first circus establishment in India. A tour of Thalassery led to the meeting of Chhatre with Keeleri Kunhikannan, a martial arts trainer. Keeleri Kunjikannan established the first dedicated circus school in India in 1901. He is known as &quot;the father of Kerala Circus&quot;. A circus academy was inaugurated in Thalassery in 2010.

==Cuisine==

Thalassery is known for its biryani (in local dialect, biri-yaa-ni) Unlike other biriyani cuisines, Thalassery biryani uses Kaima/Jeerakasala rice instead of the usual basmati rice. Porridges such as (ragi porridge) are also popular.

The spice trade from the Malabar coast which began around 1500 BC is still active.

==Cricket==
In 1800, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington made Thalassery (then Tellicherry) his base. Wellesley and his colleagues played cricket in the town maidan, often watched by bystanders, who would help the English officers whenever they were short of players. They played were from the dhobi community and the fishermen who lived along the beach. In 1830, the Tellicherry Cricket Club (TCC) was formed. By the 1930s Thalassery had become a major cricket centre. Many teams used to visit the town for matches. The earliest record of a cricket match in Thalassery is a report in &quot;Malayala Manorama&quot; in 1890. It&#x27;s about a match between Thalassery and the neighbouring town of Kannur.

Thalassery Stadium, located close to the sea, hosts Ranji Trophy cricket matches quite often. Wellesley is believed to have introduced this game in Kerala in the 18th century for British soldiers garrisoned in the Tellichery Fort. India&#x27;s first cricket club, which was later named the Town Cricket Club, was formed in 1850 at Tellichery by Wellesley. The Tellichery Cricket ground was the hub of cricket activities during this period. An exhibition match was conducted in there to raise funds during the First World War.

==Education==


The educational renaissance of Malabar started from Thalassery due to the influence of European missionaries. Government Brennen College, Thalassery, founded in 1862, is one of the oldest educational institutions in India.

Kannur University Thalassery Campus is located at Palayad, 6 km north of Thalassery. The Basel Evangelic Mission Parsi High school is an English Medium school (established 1856) in Malabar. Dr. Hermann Gundert was a tutor there. Kaikose Ruderasha, a Parsi, donated funds to build the institute with the assistance of German missionaries.

Other educational institutions include Sports Authority of India Centre, Nettur Technical Training Foundation, St Joseph&#x27;s Higher Secondary School, Sacred Heart Girls High School, and Basel Evangelical Mission Parsi High School.

Clashes in 2008 left seven people killed and many have been injured. The High Court of Kerala called this manslaughter a &quot;compelling sport&quot; and suggested permanent deployment of Central forces in the affected areas.

<doc id="1235271" wikidata="Q306395" url="?curid=1235271" title="Betatron">
<text>A betatron is a type of cyclic particle accelerator for electrons. It consists of a torus-shaped vacuum chamber with an electron source. Circling the torus is an iron transformer core with a wire winding around it. The device functions similarly to a transformer, with the electrons in the torus-shaped vacuum chamber as its secondary coil. An alternating current in the primary coils accelerates electrons in the vacuum around a circular path. The betatron was the first machine capable of producing electron beams at energies higher than could be achieved with a simple electron gun, and the first circular accelerator in which particles orbited at a constant radius.

The concept of the betatron had been proposed as early as 1922 by Joseph Slepian. Through the 1920s and 30s a number of theoretical problems related to the device were considered by scientists including Rolf Wideroe, Ernest Walton, and Max Steenbeck. The first working betatron was constructed by Donald Kerst at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1940.

== History ==

After the discovery in the 1800s of Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, which showed that an electromotive force could be generated by a changing magnetic field, several scientists speculated that this effect could be used to accelerate charged particles to high energies. Joseph Slepian proposed a device in 1922 that would use permanent magnets to steer the beam while it was accelerated by a changing magnetic field. However, he did not pursue the idea past the theoretical stage.

In the late 1920s, Gregory Breit and Merle Tuve at the Bureau of Terrestrial Magnetism constructed a working device that used varying magnetic fields to accelerate electrons. Their device placed two solenoidal magnets next to one another and fired electrons from a gun at the outer edge of the magnetic field. As the field was increased, the electrons accelerated in to strike a target at the center of the field, producing X-rays. This device took a step towards the betatron concept by shaping the magnetic field to keep the particles focused in the plane of acceleration.

In 1929, Rolf Wideroe made the next major contribution to the development of the theory by deriving the &quot;Wideroe Condition&quot; for stable orbits. He determined that in order for the orbit radius to remain constant, the field at the radius must be exactly half of the average field over the area of the magnet. This critical calculation allowed for the development of accelerators in which the particles orbited at a constant radius, rather than spiraling inward, as in the case of Breit and Tuve&#x27;s machine, or outward, as in the case of the cyclotron. Although Wideroe made valuable contributions to the development of the theory of the Betatron, he was unable to build a device in which the electrons orbited more than one and a half times, as his device had no mechanism to keep the beam focused.

Simultaneously with Wideroe&#x27;s experiments, Ernest Walton analyzed the orbits of electrons in a magnetic field, and determined that it was possible to construct an orbit that was radially focused in the plane of the orbit. Particles in such an orbit which moved a small distance away from the orbital radius would experience a force pushing them back to the correct radius. These oscillations about a stable orbit in a circular accelerator are now referred to as &quot;betatron oscillations&quot;.

In 1935 Max Steenbeck applied in Germany for a patent on a device that would combine the radial focusing condition of Walton with the vertical focusing used in Breit and Tuve&#x27;s machine. He later claimed to have built a working machine, but this claim was disputed.

The first team unequivocally acknowledged to have built a working betatron was led by Donald Kerst at the University of Illinois. The accelerator was completed on July 15, 1940.

==Operation principle==
In a betatron, the changing magnetic field from the primary coil accelerates electrons injected into the vacuum torus, causing them to circle around the torus in the same manner as current is induced in the secondary coil of a transformer (Faraday&#x27;s law).

The stable orbit for the electrons satisfies
: formula_1
where
: formula_2 is the flux within the area enclosed by the electron orbit,
: formula_3 is the radius of the electron orbit, and
: formula_4 is the magnetic field at formula_3.

In other words, the magnetic field at the orbit must be half the average magnetic field over its circular cross section:

: formula_6

This condition is often called &quot;Widerøe&#x27;s condition&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;betatron&quot; (a reference to the beta particle, a fast electron) was chosen during a departmental contest. Other proposals were &quot;rheotron&quot;, &quot;induction accelerator&quot;, &quot;induction electron accelerator&quot;, and even &quot;Außerordentlichehochgeschwindigkeitselektronenentwickelndesschwerarbeitsbeigollitron&quot;, a suggestion by a German associate, for &quot;Hard working by golly machine for generating extraordinarily high velocity electrons&quot; or perhaps &quot;Extraordinarily high velocity electron generator, high energy by golly-tron.&quot;

==Applications==
Betatrons were historically employed in particle physics experiments to provide high-energy beams of electrons—up to about 300 MeV. If the electron beam is directed at a metal plate, the betatron can be used as a source of energetic x-rays, which may be used in industrial and medical applications (historically in radiation oncology). A small version of a betatron was also used to provide a source of hard X-rays (by deceleration of the electron beam in a target) for prompt initiation of some experimental nuclear weapons by means of photon-induced fission and photofission in the bomb core.

The Radiation Center, the first private medical center to treat cancer patients with a betatron, was opened by Dr. O. Arthur Stiennon in a suburb of Madison, Wisconsin in the late 1950s.

==Limitations==
The maximum energy that a betatron can impart is limited by the strength of the magnetic field due to the saturation of iron and by practical size of the magnet core. The next generation of accelerators, the synchrotrons, overcame these limitations.

<text>Pete Clifton is Editor-in-Chief at the Press Association (PA). Prior to the appointment he was Executive Producer for MSN in the UK and former Head of Editorial Development at BBC News.

==Career==
Clifton was previously the editor of Ceefax, and before joining the BBC was a news and sports reporter at the &quot;Chronicle and Echo&quot; in Northampton, a sports journalist at the Exchange Telegraph national news agency, chief sports sub at the UK&#x27;s Press Association (PA) and editor of the PA&#x27;s Teletext service.

Clifton was involved in the founding of BBC News Online and also helped set up the BBC Sport website in 2000. He went on to become editor of BBC News Online in 2004, succeeding founding editor Mike Smartt, until he was promoted to head of BBC News Interactive in October 2005 with responsibility for BBC News Online, CBBC Newsround, the Ceefax teletext service, the digital text service, On This Day, BBC&#x27;s Interactive TV, the Action Network and a variety of news services to mobile phones and other mobile devices.

Clifton replaced Richard Deverell as head of BBC News Interactive, who had moved to become chief operating officer of CBBC. Clifton&#x27;s successor as editor of BBC News Online was Steve Herrmann.

Clifton admitted on the BBC Editor&#x27; Blog on 16 August 2007 that he had edited his own Wikipedia entry after viewing an incorrect entry for BBC News Online, but would be leaving the editing of the page to others in future.

In March 2011, the BBC announced Clifton would be made redundant following the closure of the BBC Journalism group within the organisation. The following month it was announced that he would be moving to MSN UK to become executive producer.

In January 2015, he was appointed Editor-in-Chief of the Press Association.

<doc id="1235284" wikidata="Q5470038" url="?curid=1235284" title="Formation of rocks">
<text>:&quot;This article discusses how rocks are formed. There are also articles on physical rock formations, rock layerings (strata), and the formal naming of geologic formations.&quot;

Terrestrial rocks are formed by three main mechanisms:
* Sedimentary rocks are formed through the gradual accumulation of sediments: for example, sand on a beach or mud on a river bed. As the sediments are buried they get compacted as more and more material is deposited on top. Eventually the sediments will become so dense that they would essentially form a rock. This process is known as lithification.
* Igneous rocks have crystallised from a melt or magma. The melt is made up of various components of pre-existing rocks which have been subjected to melting either at subduction zones or within the Earth&#x27;s mantle. The melt is hot and so passes upward through cooler country rock. As it moves, it cools and various rock types will form through a process known as fractional crystallisation. Igneous rocks can be seen at mid-ocean ridges, areas of island arc volcanism or in intra-plate hotspots.
* Metamorphic rocks once existed as igneous or sedimentary rocks, but have been subjected to varying degrees of pressure and heat within the Earth&#x27;s crust. The processes involved will change the composition and fabric of the rock and their original nature is often hard to distinguish. Metamorphic rocks are typically found in areas of mountain building.

Rock can also form in the absence of a substantial pressure gradient as material that condensed from a protoplanetary disk, without ever undergoing any transformations in the interior of a large object such as a planet or moon. Astrophysicists classify this as a fourth type of rock: primitive rock. This type is common in asteroids and meteorites.

== Rock formation ==

=== 19th-century efforts to synthesize rocks === 

The synthetic investigation of rocks proceeds by experimental work that attempts to reproduce different rock types and to elucidate their origins and structures. In many cases no experiment is necessary. Every stage in the origin of clays, sands and gravels can be seen in process around us, but where these have been converted into coherent shales, sandstone and conglomerates, and still more where they have experienced some degree of metamorphism, there are many obscure points about their history upon which experiment may yet throw light. Attempts have been made to reproduce igneous rocks, by fusion of mixtures of crushed minerals or of chemicals in specially contrived furnaces. The earliest researches of this sort are those of Faujas St Fond and of de Saussure, but Sir James Hall really laid the foundations of this branch of petrology. He showed (1798) that the whinstones (diabases) of Edinburgh were fusible and if rapidly cooled yielded black vitreous masses closely resembling natural pitchstones and obsidians. If cooled more slowly they consolidated as crystalline rocks not unlike the whinstones themselves and containing olivine, augite and feldspar (the essential minerals of these rocks).

Many years later Daubrée, Delesse and others carried on similar experiments, but the first notable advance was made in 1878, when Fouqué and Lévy began their researches. They succeeded in producing such rocks as porphyrite, leucite-tephrite, basalt and dolerite, and obtained also various structural modifications well known in igneous rocks, e.g. the porphyritic and the ophitic. Incidentally, they showed that while many basic rocks (basalts, etc.) could be perfectly imitated in the laboratory, the acid rocks could not, and advanced the explanation that for the crystallization of the latter the gases never absent in natural rock magmas were indispensable mineralizing agents. It has subsequently been proved that steam, or such volatile substances as certain borates, molybdates, chlorides, fluorides, assist in the formation of orthoclase, quartz and mica (the minerals of granite). Sir James Hall also made the first contribution to the experimental study of metamorphic rocks by converting chalk into marble by heating it in a closed gun-barrel, which prevented the escape of the carbonic acid at high temperatures. In 1901 Adams and Nicholson carried this a stage further by subjecting marble to great pressures in hydraulic presses and have shown how the foliated structures, frequent in natural marble may be produced artificially.

== Extraterrestrial rock ==
Off-Earth, rock can also form in the absence of a substantial pressure gradient as material that condensed from a protoplanetary disk, without ever undergoing transformations in the interior of a large object such as planets and moons. Astrophysicists classify this as a fourth type of rock: Primitive rock. 

Primitive rocks &quot;have never been heated much, although some of their constituents may have been quite hot early in the history of our Solar System. Primitive rocks are common on the surfaces of many asteroids, and the majority of meteorites are primitive rocks.&quot;
An example of a primitive rock is the achondritic iron-nickel octahedrite mineral seen in the Widmanstätten pattern that is found in a number of iron-rich meteorites. Consisting of kamacite and taenite and formed under extremely slow cooling conditions—about 100 to 10,000 °C/Myr, with total cooling times of 10 Myr or less—it will precipitate kamacite and grow kamacite plates along certain crystallographic planes in the taenite crystal lattice.

<doc id="1235285" wikidata="Q629411" url="?curid=1235285" title="Timesheet">
<text>A timesheet (or time sheet) is a method for recording the amount of a worker&#x27;s time spent on each job. Traditionally a sheet of paper with the data arranged in tabular format, a timesheet is now often a digital document or spreadsheet. The time cards stamped by time clocks can serve as a timesheet or provide the data to fill one. These, too, are now often digital. Timesheets came into use in the 19th century as time books. To record time in a more granular fashion, time-tracking software may be used.

==Use==
Originally developed for an employer to calculate payroll, a timesheet can also be used for management accounting. Timesheets may track the start and end times of tasks or just the duration. It may contain a detailed breakdown of tasks accomplished throughout the project or program. This information may be used for payroll, client billing, and increasingly for project costing, estimation, tracking, and management. 

Some companies provide web-based timesheet software or services that provide a means to track time for payroll, billing and project management. One of the major uses of timesheet in a project management environment is comparing planned costs versus actual costs, as well as measuring employee performance and identifying problematic tasks. This knowledge can drive corporate strategy as users stop performing or reassign unprofitable work.

==Time cards==

Factory workers may often have a &quot;time card&quot; (also known as punch card) and &quot;punch in&quot; by inserting their card into an automatic timestamp machine (called a time clock or bundy clock) when starting and ending their work shift, though other card technologies such as swipe cards have become more prevalent.

==Advantages==
Time tracking can reduce costs in three ways: by making payroll processing more efficient, by making costs visible so they can be reduced, and by automating billing and invoicing.

Time tracking can increase revenue through automating billing, which tends to make it easier for a company to get correct invoices out for all hours worked by consulting staff. This speeds up payment and eliminates the hassles of &#x27;dropping&#x27; bills.

By reducing costs in three ways, and increasing revenue in one way, timesheet management technologies that are web-based can improve the health of companies.

In project management, timesheet can also be used to build a body of knowledge about how much effort tasks take to develop. This data helps resource managers to allocate resource accurately. Machine learning is being used to automatically find patterns in timesheet — then using this information to recommend more accurate project plans in the future. For example, if developing a training plan has historically taken a month, then it can be assumed that creating a new one will take a month. Also, most timesheet software has the ability to track resource costs and project expenses to allow for better future budgeting. 

For the HR function, the time spent on activities by individuals can be analysed over a period of time and categorised into broad types. Based on the outcome, roles could be realigned.

<doc id="1235289" wikidata="Q813266" url="?curid=1235289" title="TrackMania">
<text>TrackMania is a series of racing games for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, Nintendo DS, and Wii developed by Ubisoft Nadeo and Firebrand Games. Instead of following the usual trend of choosing a set car and track to play the game, in &quot;TrackMania&quot; the players can create their own tracks using a &quot;building block&quot; process similar to games that existed before the first TrackMania game, such as the 1984 game &quot;Excitebike&quot;, the 1985 game &quot;Racing Destruction Set&quot;, and the 1990 game &quot;Stunts&quot;.

&quot;TrackMania&quot; games typically have a time trial format, with medals awarded for beating set times in single-player mode, as well as the ability to submit times to various online rankings. Players may choose to respawn (retire) at any time, for example if they land upside down, leave the track or get off to a poor start. Multiplayer races operate as concurrent time trials; players&#x27; cars are visible on the same track at the same time, but cannot physically interact with one another.

==Games==

===&quot;TrackMania (2003)&quot;===
===&quot;TrackMania Sunrise&quot;===
===&quot;TrackMania Nations (Electronic Sports World Cup)&quot;===

On January 27, 2006, Nadeo released TrackMania Nations, also called TrackMania Nations ESWC partly as a promotion for the Electronic Sports World Cup, and also for &quot;TrackMania&quot; itself. This free, stand-alone game had one new environment, &quot;Stadium&quot;, and many of the &quot;Sunrise&quot; edition features, including the advertisement panels, which show ads from sponsors streamed from the internet. The game contains 100 single player tracks, the earlier ones relatively simple in both design and gameplay, but it is largely pitched as an online game. One of the main attractions is the leader board, where players compete for the best times and points. The top five players can be seen on the game&#x27;s homepage. &quot;Nations&quot; quickly became popular with almost 1 million registered online players within weeks of its launch), largely due to the wide availability of the freeware game.

===&quot;TrackMania United&quot;===

On June 30, 2006, &quot;TrackMania United&quot; was announced, a version that amalgamated all previous &quot;TrackMania&quot; editions into a single game that includes all the environments from the earlier games, and subsequently future installments of the series. &quot;TrackMania United&quot; features a peer-to-peer networking system allowing players to share custom content more easily, and a unified ranking system. The updated graphics engine includes a shadow mapping acceleration system, which is used in the most recent &quot;Stadium&quot; version. The new engine allows for more realistic shadows on high end systems while the &quot;Stadium&quot; environment has double the number of blocks featured in the free version, including dirt paths, water, and indoor sections.

Focus announced on November 9, 2006, that 10,000 copies of &quot;TrackMania United&quot; could be bought and pre-loaded online then activated from November 16, 2006 onwards. The game became available in retail outlets in France, Canada, Australia, Belgium, the French-speaking part of Switzerland and Russia later in 2006, then on February 23, 2007 in Germany, then on March 9, 2007 and later in other regions.

The game is available in the UK and was made available in the US via download for $49.99 on March 23, 2007 and $39.99 on April 17, 2007. As of September 7, 2007, the game is available for $29.95. It was made available for pre-order and pre-load on Steam on June 7, 2007 and unlocked on June 14, 2007.

Players who previously purchased &quot;TrackMania&quot; or &quot;TrackMania: Sunrise&quot; can earn a daily copper bonus in &quot;TrackMania United&quot; by registering their product keys through the game.

&quot;Trackmania United Forever&quot; is an updated version of &quot;Trackmania United&quot; featuring seven environments and an all-new mediatracker. It was published by Focus Home Interactive and developed by Ubisoft Nadeo and has a similar layout to &quot;Trackmania Nations Forever&quot;. Four main modes are available: &quot;Race&quot;, &quot;Stunt&quot;, &quot;Platform&quot;, and &quot;Puzzle&quot; as well as all the tracks from &quot;Trackmania Nations&quot;.

===&quot;TrackMania United Forever &amp; Nations Forever&quot;===
On October 7, 2007, Ubisoft Nadeo announced that they were working on updated versions of &quot;TrackMania United&quot; and &quot;TrackMania Nations&quot;. Both new versions have &quot;Forever&quot; added to their name, and are network compatible. &quot;TrackMania Nations Forever&quot; includes the new stadium blocks and physics system introduced in &quot;TrackMania United&quot;, which allow &quot;TrackMania United Forever&quot; and &quot;TrackMania Nations Forever&quot; players to compete on the same (Stadium) servers.

Nadeo has stated that because they want the game to have a long lifespan, they are working on the engine and user interface rather than adding new content. &quot;TrackMania United Forever&quot;, for instance, no longer requires the CD to be in the drive due to different copy protection and anti-cheat systems. They also warn players that some features may not be the final versions.

&quot;TrackMania United Forever&quot; was released on April 15, 2008, with the free-to-play variant &quot;TrackMania Nations Forever&quot; released the following day.

As of 9 December 2010, following the closure of the company used for providing in-game advertising, Nadeo introduced the &quot;FreeZone&quot; system to the game. This meant that Nations Forever players could only play on specific FreeZone servers or normal servers that they manually added to their in-game favourites list. Additionally, Nations Forever players were forced to spectate every one in five races. These changes were made as an incentive for players to upgrade to the paid &quot;TrackMania United Forever&quot; as Nadeo could no longer make money from in-game advertising.

There were also plans to add additional environments, like Toy, Moon and a third unnamed environment, but they were scrapped.

===&quot;TrackMania DS&quot;===
===&quot;TrackMania Turbo&quot; (DS)===
===&quot;TrackMania: Build to Race&quot;===
On June 30, 2009, a &quot;TrackMania&quot; game for the Wii, titled &quot;TrackMania Wii&quot; was announced by jeuxvideo.com in an interview with one of the developers. The game features all the environments from &quot;TrackMania United&quot; apart from &quot;Bay&quot;, due to the complexity of its scenery. The game was supposed to be released in North America under the title TrackMania: Build to Race on July 20, 2010 but on July 19, 2010, Michael Mota of Dreamcatcher Interactive, TrackMania Wii&#x27;s publisher, told the Examiner &quot;We made the announcement to the major retailers about the TrackMania delay; I’m not sure why that hasn’t been changed. The game has been delayed until December.&quot; The game eventually came out in North America on March 24, 2011. It has a more primitive online play system than the PC line of games and also uniquely features a special &quot;F&quot; class of tracks unlocked after a certain amount of medals are accrued.

An updated Wii release date on the Nintendo website for the UK version published by Focus Home Interactive has been given as September 23, 2010. The game was released in Europe with the &quot;Build to Race&quot; subtitle removed.

===&quot;TrackMania2&quot;===
====&quot;TrackMania2: Canyon&quot;====
Like previous &quot;TrackMania&quot; games, players can race on tracks while doing various stunts as well as build their own tracks. The game features a new environment, Canyon, as well as two modes, Race and Platform. Platform mode is featured in the free extension pack, TrackMania2: Platform.

Besides the new environment, the game also includes a split-screen mode, and a scripting language called &quot;ManiaScript&quot; which lets players add their own new features to the game.

====&quot;TrackMania2: Stadium&quot;====
&quot;TrackMania2: Stadium&quot; was announced on November 2, 2012. This environment was opened to the public with an open beta on February 27, 2013. The game features the classic Stadium environment that was introduced in &quot;TrackMania Nations&quot;. There have been some improvements to the graphics and some new added blocks in the editor. It uses ManiaPlanet&#x27;s client and interface. The game was released on June 20, 2013.

====&quot;TrackMania2: Valley&quot;====
&quot;TrackMania2: Valley&quot; was announced on November 2, 2012. This environment became available on ManiaPlanet on July 4, 2013.

====&quot;TrackMania2: Lagoon&quot;====
&quot;TrackMania2: Lagoon&quot; was announced on May 9, 2017. This environment became available on ManiaPlanet on May 23, 2017. With this environment ported from TrackMania Turbo (2016), ManiaPlanet was given a large update called &quot;ManiaPlanet 4&quot;.

===&quot;TrackMania Turbo&quot; (2016)===

Announced at Ubisoft&#x27;s E3 2015 conference, &quot;TrackMania Turbo&quot; is a spin-off heavily inspired by 90s arcade racers. The game has been released in North America on March 22, 2016 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and on March 24, 2016 for Microsoft Windows.

===&quot;Trackmania&quot; (2020)===

A remake of &quot;Trackmania Nations&quot; was announced for Microsoft Windows on February 29, 2020, and was due to be released on May 5, 2020, but was delayed until July 1, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released on consoles and cloud platforms on May 15, 2023.
The base game is free-to-play, with additional content available with a paid subscription model, including a more advanced in-game track editor, online events and car customization.

==Reception==
Due to the success of the &quot;TrackMania&quot; series, Guinness World Records awarded the games six world records in the &quot;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008&quot;. These include &quot;Biggest Online Race&quot;, &quot;Most Popular Online Racing Sim&quot; and &quot;Largest Content Base of Any Racing Game&quot;, with hundreds of thousands of user-created tracks and hundreds of unique cars available for download.

==Copy protection system==
The PC games in the &quot;TrackMania&quot; series used a copy protection system called StarForce, which silently installed a driver with all versions of &quot;TrackMania Original&quot;, &quot;TrackMania Sunrise&quot; and the original &quot;TrackMania Nations&quot;. Many sources falsely reported that &quot;TrackMania Nations&quot; updated the StarForce drivers only if they were already installed, although versions released after May 28, 2007, installed the StarForce drivers on all computers even though &quot;TrackMania Nations&quot; is freeware. The original &quot;TrackMania United&quot; features StarForce restrictions built into the executable to check the software&#x27;s key, but it does not install the driver.

Although Valve originally included it in the system, on June 29, 2007, the company announced that the version of &quot;TrackMania United&quot; distributed via their Steam digital distribution platform would no longer include StarForce.

&quot;TrackMania United Forever&quot; and &quot;TrackMania Nations Forever&quot; do not include StarForce. If they are applied as upgrades to version of &quot;TrackMania United&quot; or &quot;TrackMania Nations&quot; which include StarForce, they attempt to remove it.

==Spin-offs==

As the TrackMania games have grown in popularity, Nadeo started plans for two completely new games; namely, they began work on role-playing and first-person shooter games. These were first announced in 2009 through TrackMania United Forever, where the player&#x27;s loading screen was replaced with images announcing either &quot;Shootmania&quot; or &quot;Questmania&quot;. On 19 February 2012, Nadeo officially announced &quot;Shootmania&quot;. On 10 April 2013, Nadeo released &quot;Shootmania&quot; on Maniaplanet. Questmania, however has not been released yet.

<doc id="1235292" wikidata="Q6548600" url="?curid=1235292" title="Lily pad network">
<text>A lily pad network is a series of wireless access points spread over a large area, each connected to a different network and owned by different enterprises and people, providing hotspots where wireless clients can connect to the Internet without regard for the particular networks to which they link.

This is in contrast with wireless community networks, where the access points route traffic between them, as well as a corporate wireless LAN where several access points are connected to the corporate network, and the members of the organization are supposed to stick to their own network.

Unlike a traditional corporate wireless LAN, which allows access to other networks only via access points connected to the main corporate network, a lily pad does not restrict a network user to connecting only to their own network. In this way, a lily pad network enables the network users to roam over a large area while staying connected, without needing the overheads of the access points to route traffic between the individual networks.

Lily pad networks derive their name from their frog-like &quot;hopping&quot; facility, where mobile stations which roam over a large area are akin to frogs, hopping from lily pad to lily pad, and because of the technology, remaining continuously connected. Unlike typical wireless mesh networks, where each network client needs to manage their own network connection continuity, a lily pad network topology enables roaming by linking a number of wireless access points together.

A lily pad network is particularly suitable for mobile wireless network connectivity over a large geographic area, such as a combination of coffee houses, libraries, and other public spaces. In these locations wireless access infrastructure is available for configuring the lily pad network to provide &quot;hot spots&quot;, allowing a mobile station to connect to the Internet for both surfing or VoIP.</text><links>

<doc id="1235299" wikidata="Q1770064" url="?curid=1235299" title="Battle of Otford (776)">
<text>The Battle of Otford was fought in 776 between the Mercians, led by Offa of Mercia, and the Jutes of Kent. The battle took place at Otford, in the modern English county of Kent.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; recorded that the Mercians and the people of Kent fought at Otford, without giving the outcome, although it is considered significant that Kent was re-established as an independent kingdom after the battle. The kings of Kent continued to issue charters after 776, without any reference to Offa, so historians have deduced that Otford was a Kentish victory. The charters S 35 (dated 778), S 36 (dated 779) and S 37 (765 x 785) are in the name of Egbert, while S 38 (dated 784) is in the name of King Ealhmund. The changeover between Ecgberht and Ealhmund cannot be dated more precisely than 779–784.

Kent was struggling to remain independent against the growing power of Mercia. In the 770s, the kings of Kent were resisting their demotion to subkings. According to the chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, the Mercians were victorious at the battle near Sevenoaks. The historian Frank Stenton argued that Egbert of Kent defeated Offa and that Kentish independence was restored for some years. Offa&#x27;s victory over Wessex at Bensington, Mercian pressure resumed and Kent was absorbed into Mercia.

<doc id="1235304" wikidata="Q15044898" url="?curid=1235304" title="The Lilac Time">
<text>The Lilac Time are an English alternative folk-rock band, originally formed in Herefordshire by Stephen Duffy, his brother Nick Duffy and their friend Michael Weston in 1986. The band&#x27;s name was taken from a line in the Nick Drake song &quot;River Man&quot;.

The Lilac Time has gone through various line-up changes, with the Duffy brothers as mainstays. The band&#x27;s activity has intertwined with Stephen Duffy&#x27;s solo and songwriting career.

==History==
The Duffy brothers and Michael Weston recorded music that was first released on Swordfish Records in 1987 and later became the band&#x27;s self-titled debut. Michael Giri and Fraser Kent joined when the band went on tour. The group signed to Fontana, which reissued the band&#x27;s first album in remixed form in 1988. The group went on to release the albums &quot;Paradise Circus&quot; in 1989, and &quot;&amp; Love for All&quot; in 1990, the latter produced by Andy Partridge and John Leckie.

The Lilac Time was dropped by Fontana then briefly signed to Creation Records, where the band was subsequently managed by label head Alan McGee. The band&#x27;s sole release on Creation was &quot;Astronauts&quot;, in 1990. The Duffy&#x27;s cousin, noted session musician Cara Tivey, contributed organ and piano to the album.

The band later regrouped with Claire Worrall and Melvin Duffy (no relation to the brothers) and recorded &quot;Looking For A Day In The Night&quot; with producer Stephen Street for spinART Records in 1999. They than released &quot;Lilac 6&quot; on Cooking Vinyl in 2001, followed by &quot;Keep Going&quot;, released in 2003 under the name &quot;Stephen Duffy and the Lilac Time&quot; on Folk Modern.

&quot;Runout Groove&quot; was released on 22 October 2007 on Bogus Frontage. The band played the 2007 Green Man Festival and the Queen Elizabeth Hall as a six-piece. The band&#x27;s gig at the Green Man Festival serves as the backdrop to the film &quot;Memory &amp; Desire — 30 Years in the Wilderness With Stephen Duffy &amp; The Lilac Time.&quot; The documentary was filmed over six years by Douglas Arrowsmith and included new and vintage Lilac footage. The film is accompanied by a Universal Records album of the same name, which compiles songs from Duffy&#x27;s thirty years making music. The Queen Elizabeth Hall concert is to be released as a live recording.

&quot;No Sad Songs&quot; was released on Tapete Records in April 2015.

A new Lilac Time album, &quot;Return to Us&quot;, was released in October 2019.

The band is now based in Cornwall.

<doc id="1235315" wikidata="Q6767006" url="?curid=1235315" title="Mark Carlisle">
<text>Mark Carlisle, Baron Carlisle of Bucklow, QC, DL, PC (7 July 1929 – 14 July 2005) was a British Conservative Party politician and was Member of Parliament (MP) for Runcorn from 1964 to 1983 and then for Warrington South until 1987. Created a life peer in November 1987, he served as Secretary of State for Education and Science from 1979 until 1981.

Mark Carlisle&#x27;s father was a Manchester cotton merchant, and his parents were in Montevideo, Uruguay, when he was born. He was educated at Radley College in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, and the University of Manchester. He was Chairman of the university&#x27;s Conservative association, and Federation of university Conservatives in 1953. In 1957 he was vice-chairman of North-West Young Conservatives. He was admitted Gray&#x27;s Inn, was called to the bar, and made QC in 1971.

== Political career ==
Carlisle was an unsuccessful Conservative candidate at the 1958 St Helens by-election, and lost again in the subsequent 1959 general election.

He was eventually selected for the Cheshire constituency of Runcorn, a rural and suburban seat which he won at the 1964 general election. He was a liberal Tory from the start, voting for the abolition of capital punishment in 1964. Tall, affable and easy-going, he was a more relaxed figure in Edward Heath&#x27;s party than later under the first female prime minister. He disliked her abrasive manner, and according to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; &quot;was unhappy as Education secretary&quot;. He represented legal and penal policy on the party&#x27;s 1922 committee. Carlisle was on the board of NACRO for many years and an experienced voice on the Home Office Advisory Council 1966–70. His reasoning on the question of capital punishment was revealed in a Commons speech made twenty years later on 1 April 1987:
There are strong moral objections to the death penalty and to the state taking life. I do not suggest that those objections are by any means absolute. I accept and realise that the state has a responsibility to secure the safety of society. However, I believe that the moral objections to the state taking life mean that the burden of proof for the restoration of capital punishment must rest on those who claim that it is right and necessary to take life. I believe that they can do that only if they can show that the death penalty is a unique deterrent.

He was Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs from 1970 to 1972 when he became a Minister of State for Home Affairs. Carlisle steered the government Criminal Justice bill through, and warned the prison establishments to improve institutional discipline. The Conservatives were out of office after February 1974 general election, but the new Labour government retained his services on the Franks Immigration committee, as he was practising as a QC. During the 1970s he lived in Dolphin Square.

Carlisle was a Heathite moderate on issues of public expenditure and European integration.

He was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Education and Science in 1978 before being appointed to the department itself when Margaret Thatcher won the general election in May 1979. Former Labour Cabinet Minister Clare Short has said that it was her low opinion of Carlisle, whom she worked under as a civil servant, which persuaded her to enter elected politics herself because she believed she &quot;could do better&quot; than many of the MPs she dealt with. A liberal traditionalist, Carlisle created the Assisted Places Scheme, which enabled very bright working-class children gain a free place at some of Britain&#x27;s top public schools. Moreover, as Education Secretary he removed subsidised meals at school dinners on advice that they were not being taken up. What proved the undoing of this cabinet &quot;wet&quot; was a promise of Maintenance Grant funding to local education. Carlisle fell foul of the Prime Minister&#x27;s economic strategy. In his first budget Geoffrey Howe retained education funding for two years, but by 1981 deeper cuts had been passed. He resisted a total of £1 bn in cuts, but when pushed by the Prime Minister to accept cuts to free school transport, he was forced to back down.

Thatcher wrote in her memoirs that Carlisle &quot;had not proved a particularly effective Education Secretary&quot; and to this effect he was dismissed in the September 1981 Cabinet reshuffle. However he left with ‘courteousness and good humour&#x27;, which was in contrast to Sir Ian Gilmour who having left the cabinet in the same reshuffle, stormed out of Downing Street, announcing that government policy was &quot;heading for the rocks&quot;. Boundary changes meant that Carlisle appeared to change seats at the 1983 general election but in fact areas to the south of Warrington had previously been part of the Runcorn seat. He remained an MP until he stood down at the 1987 general election. On his resignation Bill Cash MP remarked &quot;he has done a great service to his office,&quot; at a time when prison policy was hardening, with a requirement for longer sentences from Criminal Justice Acts. He was instrumental in amending a justice bill reforming suspended sentences for youth offenders, who had been treated as adults. He resisted unnecessary amendments leading to the accumulation of executive power over the Court of Appeal. Sales of crossbows were restricted in scope and markets under a prohibitory act. He took a strong line against unlawful immigration.

Later the same year he was elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer with the title Baron Carlisle of Bucklow, of Mobberley in the County of Cheshire on 2 November 1987 where he sat as a Conservative life peer. He was Chairman of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board from 1989 to 2000.

== Family life ==
Carlisle married Sandra des Voeux, a Cornishwoman; they had a daughter.

Carlisle&#x27;s brother, Captain Edmund Carlisle (born 1923) was also educated at Radley, and RMA Sandhurst. His sons and grandsons were also educated at the school.

==Media==
In the 2012 film &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; he was played by Martin Wimbush.

<text>NASCAR dad is a phrase that broadly refers to a demographic group of often white, usually middle-aged, working-class or lower-middle-class men in North America. The group received the nickname because they are men who are believed to typically enjoy watching NASCAR racing or comparable high-impact sports or entertainment.

The term was often used during the 2004 United States presidential election, particularly in describing the efforts of Democrats to regain the votes of white southern males. As of 2004, the group consists of an estimated 45 million people in the United States.

<doc id="1235329" wikidata="Q470260" url="?curid=1235329" title="Griffin Dunne">
<text>Thomas Griffin Dunne (; born June 8, 1955) is an American actor, director and producer. He is known for portraying Jack Goodman in &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981) and Paul Hackett in &quot;After Hours&quot; (1985), for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

==Early life==
Thomas Griffin Dunne was born on June 8, 1955, in New York City. He is the oldest child of Ellen Beatriz (née Griffin) and Dominick Dunne. His father was born and raised in an Irish Catholic family, while his maternal grandfather was Irish-American and his maternal grandmother was from Sonora, Mexico. He is the older brother of Alexander and Dominique Dunne. His mother founded the victims&#x27; rights organization &quot;Justice for Homicide Victims&quot; after Dominique&#x27;s murder in 1982. His father was a journalist, producer, writer, and actor. He is also a nephew of writers John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion. Raised in Los Angeles, Dunne attended the Fay School in Southborough, Massachusetts, and Fountain Valley School in Colorado Springs, where he developed an interest in acting, appearing in many school plays. He was scheduled to perform in a school production of &quot;Othello&quot; when, on the eve of a performance, a teacher found him smoking marijuana. Dunne was subsequently expelled, and moved back to New York to pursue his acting interests. He studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre under Sanford Meisner.

==Career==

===Acting===
Dunne began his professional acting career at age 19 with a small supporting role in &quot;The Other Side of the Mountain&quot; in 1975. He has since appeared on both film and television, starring in &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981) as Jack Goodman, &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; (1984) as Tommy Kelly, &quot;After Hours&quot; (1985) as Paul Hackett, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; (1987) as Loudon Trott opposite Madonna, &quot;My Girl&quot; (1991) as Jake Bixler, &quot;Quiz Show&quot; (1994) as the Geritol Account Executive, &quot;Game 6&quot; (2005) as Elliott Litvak, and &quot;I Like It Like That&quot; (1994) as Stephen Price. Dunne also played Dr. Vass, opposite Matthew McConaughey, in the Oscar-winning 2013 film &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot;.

Dunne&#x27;s television appearances include &quot;Frasier&quot; (pilot episode &quot;The Good Son&quot; as caller Russell, and in season 3 episode 11 &quot;The Friend&quot; as Bob), &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Alias,&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (Episodes 5, 118, and 128). He portrayed Tony Mink in the comedy &quot;Trust Me&quot; on TNT. In 2012, Dunne guest-starred as management consultant Marco Pelios in seven episodes of the premiere season of the Showtime TV series &quot;House of Lies&quot;.

In 2018 he joined the cast of &quot;This is Us&quot; where he starred as Nicky Pearson, Jack Pearson&#x27;s brother until the series concluded in 2022.

===Producing===
Dunne&#x27;s first experience as a producer was the successful 1982 film &quot;Chilly Scenes of Winter&quot;, an adaptation of the 1976 novel of the same name by Ann Beattie. Dunne and his co-producers, Amy Robinson and Mark Metcalf, had formed their production company, Triple Play Productions, in the late 1970s and optioned Beattie&#x27;s book after agreeing to her stipulation that she be given a role. The film had a less than successful short run in theaters when it was released three years earlier with a &quot;happy&quot; ending and an alternate title, at the insistence of the distributor, United Artists. The trio persevered to have the film re-released with a more realistic ending and the same title as the book, which proved more successful. Dunne had a small part in the film, as Mark, a young doctor. After Mark Metcalf left the company, Dunne and Robinson continued as producing partners. Their company, now called Double Play Productions, produced several films, including &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot;, &quot;After Hours&quot;, &quot;Running on Empty&quot; and &quot;Game 6&quot;. In 1986, the company had signed an agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for a two-year production agreement.

===Directing===
Dunne&#x27;s directorial debut was the 1995 short film &quot;Duke of Groove&quot;. For it, Dunne received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film, along with producer Thom Colwell.

Since then, he has directed five feature films, including &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; (1997) and &quot;Practical Magic&quot; (1998). He also directed one segment of the 2013 anthology sex comedy film &quot;Movie 43&quot;, which later earned him a Razzie. Dunne produced and directed &quot;Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold&quot; (2017), a documentary about his aunt, author Joan Didion, whom Dunne interviews and appears with on screen.

===Writing===
Dunne has written articles for New York Times Travel section, Details Magazine, Porter Magazine and has a Kindle Single collection of short stories on Amazon called Air Guitar. His New York Times best-selling family memoir, The Friday Afternoon Club, was released on June 11, 2024.

==Personal life==
Dunne was married to American actress Carey Lowell from 1989 to 1995. They had one daughter together, actress Hannah Dunne.

He was married to Anna Bingemann, an Australian stylist, from 2009 to 2010.

<text>Ramón Luis Ayala Rodríguez (born February 3, 1976), known professionally as Daddy Yankee (), is a Puerto Rican rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor who rose to worldwide prominence in 2004 with the song &quot;Gasolina&quot;. Dubbed the &quot;King of Reggaeton&quot;, he is often cited as an influence by other Hispanic urban performers. He retired on December 3, 2023, after completing his final stage performance on his &quot;La Meta&quot; tour in Puerto Rico.

Ayala was born in Río Piedras and was raised in the Villa Kennedy Housing Projects neighborhood. He aspired to be a professional baseball player and tried out for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball. Before he could be officially signed, he was hit by a stray round from an AK-47 rifle while taking a break from a studio recording session with reggaeton artist DJ Playero. Ayala spent roughly a year and a half recovering from the wound; the bullet was never removed from his hip, and he credits the shooting incident with allowing him to focus entirely on a music career.

In 2004, Daddy Yankee released his international hit single &quot;Gasolina&quot;, which is credited with introducing reggaeton to audiences worldwide, and making the music genre a global phenomenon. Since then, he has sold around 30 million records, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists. Daddy Yankee&#x27;s album &quot;Barrio Fino&quot; made history when it became the top-selling Latin music album of the decade between 2000 and 2009.

In 2017, Daddy Yankee, in collaboration with Latin pop singer Luis Fonsi, released the hit single &quot;Despacito&quot;. It became the first Spanish-language song to hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 since &quot;Macarena&quot; in 1996. The single gained global success. The video for &quot;Despacito&quot; on YouTube received its billionth view on April 20, 2017, and became the most-watched video on the platform. Its success led Daddy Yankee to become the most-listened artist worldwide on the streaming service Spotify in June 2017, the first Latin artist to do so. In March 2022, Daddy Yankee announced that he would be retiring from music after the release of his seventh studio album &quot;Legendaddy&quot; and its supporting tour.

During his career, Daddy Yankee earned numerous accolades, including five Latin Grammy Awards, two &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, 14 &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, two Latin American Music Awards, eight Lo Nuestro Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, and six ASCAP Awards. He also received a Puerto Rican Walk of Fame star, special awards by &quot;People en Español&quot; magazine, and the Presencia Latina at Harvard University. He was named by CNN as the &quot;Most Influential Hispanic Artist&quot; of 2009, and included in &quot;Time&quot; 100 in 2006.

== Early life ==
Ayala was born in the Río Piedras district of San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Rosa Rodríguez and Ramón Ayala, who is a salsa percussion player.

== Musical career ==
=== 1992–1999: Career beginnings ===
Often considered to be one of the pioneers within the reggaeton genre, Ayala was originally going to become a professional baseball player but he was shot in the leg while taking a break from a studio recording session. The bullet was never removed and he credits this incident with allowing him to pursue a musical career. He first appeared on the 1992 DJ Playero&#x27;s Mixtape, Playero 34, with the song &quot;So&#x27; Persigueme, No Te Detengas&quot;. Daddy Yankee would then rise to prominence after his appearance on &quot;Playero 37&quot; which includes his first hits &quot;Donde Mi No Vengas&quot; and &quot;Yamilette&quot; which he continued to perform live in concert throughout his career until his recent retirement. His first official studio project as a solo artist was &quot;No Mercy&quot;, which was released on April 2, 1995, through White Lion Records and BM Records in Puerto Rico. Early in his career he attempted to imitate the rap style of Vico C. He went on to emulate other artists in the genre, including DJ Playero, DJ Nelson, and Tempo taking elements from their styles in order to develop an original style with the Dembow rhythm. In doing so, he eventually abandoned the traditional model of rap and became one of the first artists to perform reggaeton. Throughout the 1990s, Daddy Yankee appeared in several of DJ Playero&#x27;s underground mixtapes which were banned by the Puerto Rican government due to explicit lyrics; these songs would later be among the first reggaeton songs ever produced.

=== 2000–2003: Early music and &quot;El Cangri.com&quot; ===
In 1997, Daddy Yankee collaborated with the rapper Nas, who was an inspiration for Ayala, in the song &quot;The Profecy&quot;, for the album &quot;Boricua Guerrero&quot;. He released two compilation albums with original material: &quot;El Cartel&quot; (1997) and &quot;El Cartel II&quot; (2001). Both albums were successful in Puerto Rico, but not throughout Latin America. Between those years, Daddy Yankee released a total of nine music videos, including &quot;Posición&quot; featuring Alberto Stylee, &quot;Tu Cuerpo en la Cama&quot; featuring Nicky Jam, and &quot;Muévete y Perrea&quot;. In 2000, Daddy Yankee formed an unofficial duo called &quot;Los Cangris&quot; with Nicky Jam and released several successful singles together. Yankee and Nicky Jam fell apart in 2004 due to personal issues and creative differences. In 2012, Daddy Yankee and Nicky Jam reconciled and performed in various concerts together.

In 2002, &quot;El Cangri.com&quot; became Daddy Yankee&#x27;s first album with international success, receiving coverage in the markets of New York City and Miami with hits including &quot;Latigazo&quot;, &quot;Son las Doce&quot;, &quot;Guayando&quot; and other songs like &quot;Enciende&quot;, which talks about different social problems of the era, mentioning 9/11, corruption and religion. In 2003, Daddy Yankee released a compilation album named &quot;Los Homerun-es&quot;, which contains his first charted single (&quot;Segurosqui&quot;), five new songs and 12 remakes of DJ Playero&#x27;s albums songs. that was later charted, &quot;Seguroski&quot;, being his first charted single after six of them. In 2003, Daddy Yankee collaborated for the first time with the prestigious reggaeton producers Luny Tunes on the album &quot;Mas Flow&quot;, with his commercial success song &quot;Cógela Que Va Sin Jockey&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Métele con Candela&quot;), and &quot;Mas Flow 2&quot;.

=== 2004–2006: &quot;Barrio Fino&quot; and &quot;Gasolina&quot; ===
Daddy Yankee&#x27;s next album, &quot;Barrio Fino&quot;, was produced by Luny Tunes and DJ Nelson among others and released in July 2004 by El Cartel Records and VI Music. It was the most highly anticipated album in the reggaeton community. Daddy Yankee had enjoyed salsa music since he was young, and this led him to include music of genres besides reggaeton in the album. The most prominent of these cross-genre singles was &quot;Melao&quot;, in which he performed with Andy Montañez. The album was described as his most complete, and with it he intended to introduce combinations of reggaeton and other genres to the English-speaking market. &quot;Barrio Fino&quot; was followed up by an international tour with performances in numerous countries including the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Honduras, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela, and the United States. The album has sold over 1.1 millions of copies in the United States alone, making it the seventh best-selling Latin album in the country according to Nielsen SoundScan. Also, It had sold over 2 million copies throughout Latin America and worldwide.

During this same time, Daddy Yankee was featured in N.O.R.E.&#x27;s single &quot;Oye Mi Canto&quot; which hit number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; a record for a reggaeton single at the time. Other successful featured singles included &quot;Mayor Que Yo&quot; and &quot;Los 12 Discípulos&quot;.

In 2005, Daddy Yankee won several international awards, making him one of the most recognized reggaeton artists within the music industry. The first award of the year was Lo Nuestro Awards within the &quot;Album of the Year&quot; category, which he received for &quot;Barrio Fino&quot;. In this event he performed &quot;Gasolina&quot; in a performance that was described as &quot;innovative&quot;. &quot;Barrio Fino&quot; also won the &quot;Reggaeton Album of the Year&quot; award in the Latin &quot;Billboard&quot; that took place on April 28, 2005, where he performed a mix of three of his songs in a duet with P. Diddy. The album was promoted throughout Latin America, the United States, and Europe, reaching certified gold in Japan. Due to the album&#x27;s success, Daddy Yankee received promotional contracts with radio stations and soda companies, including Pepsi. His hit single, &quot;Gasolina&quot;, received the majority of votes cast for the second edition of &quot;Premios Juventud&quot;, in which it received eight nominations and won seven awards. Daddy Yankee also made a live presentation during the award ceremony. &quot;Gasolina&quot; received nominations in the Latin Grammy and MTV Video Music Awards. The commercial success of &quot;Gasolina&quot; in the United States led to the creation of a new radio format and a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart: Latin Rhythm Airplay. According to Nestor Casonu, CEO of Casonu Strategic Management, &quot;Daddy Yankee and &#x27;Gasolina&#x27; triggered the explosion of urban Latin music worldwide&quot;.

The successful single, &quot;Gasolina&quot;, was covered by artists from different music genres. This led to a controversy when &quot;Los Lagos&quot;, a Mexican banda group, did a cover with the original beat but changed the song&#x27;s lyrics. The group&#x27;s label had solicited the copyright permission to perform the single and translate it to a different music style, but did not receive consent to change the lyrics; legal action followed. Speaking for the artist, Daddy Yankee&#x27;s lawyer stated that having his song covered was an &quot;honor, but it must be done the right way.&quot;

On December 13, 2005, he released &quot;Barrio Fino en Directo&quot;, a live record and the follow-up of &quot;Barrio Fino&quot;. The album sold more than in 800,000 copies in the United States, becoming the 13th best-selling Latin album in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan and over 3 million of copies worldwide.

On April 30, 2006, Daddy Yankee was named one of the 100 most influential people by &quot;Time&quot;, which cited the 2 million copies of &quot;Barrio Fino&quot; sold, Daddy Yankee&#x27;s $20 million contract with Interscope Records, and his Pepsi endorsement.

During this period, Daddy Yankee and William Omar Landrón (more commonly known by his artistic name Don Omar) were involved in a rivalry within the genre, dubbed &quot;tiraera&quot;. The rivalry received significant press coverage despite being denied early on by both artists. It originated with a lyrical conflict between the artists begun by Daddy Yankee&#x27;s comments in a remix single, where he criticized Landron&#x27;s common usage of the nickname &quot;King of Kings&quot;. Don Omar responded to this in a song titled &quot;Ahora Son Mejor&quot;, in his album &quot;Los Rompediscotecas&quot;.

=== 2007–2009: &quot;El Cartel: The Big Boss&quot; and &quot;Talento de Barrio&quot; ===
&quot;El Cartel: The Big Boss&quot; was released by Interscope on June 5, 2007. Daddy Yankee stated that the album marked a return to his hip-hop roots as opposed to being considered a strictly reggaeton album. The album was produced in 2006, and included the participation of will.i.am, Scott Storch, Tainy Tunes, Neli, and personnel from Daddy Yankee&#x27;s label. Singles were produced with Héctor el Father, Fergie, Nicole Scherzinger and Akon. The first single from the album was titled &quot;Impacto&quot;, and was released prior to the completion of the album. The album was promoted by a tour throughout the United States, which continued throughout Latin America. He performed in Mexico, first in Monterrey, where 10,000 attended the concert, and later at San Luis Potosí coliseum, where the concert sold out, leaving hundreds of fans outside the building. Daddy Yankee performed in Chile as well, and established a record for attendance in Ecuador. He also performed in Bolivia, setting another record when 50,000 fans attended his Santa Cruz de la Sierra concert. This show was later described as &quot;the best show with the biggest attendance in history&quot; and as &quot;somehappy that his album had sold more than those of Juan Luis Guerra and Juanes, and that this was an &quot;official proof that reggaeton&#x27;s principal exponent defeated the rest of the genres&quot;.

Between 2007 and 2008, Daddy Yankee made several guest appearances in famous reggaeton compilation albums including Caribbean Connection, Echo Presenta: Invasión, Mas Flow: Los Benjamins, and 20 Number 1&#x27;s Now.

He appeared on the 2008 Rockstar Games&#x27; video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; as the DJ of Radio San Juan Sounds, with spanglish lines. The radio includes reggaeton songs from Daddy Yankee&#x27;s colleagues, like Wisin &amp; Yandel, Héctor el Father, Tito El Bambino and Jowell &amp; Randy. San Juan Sounds also featured Daddy Yankee&#x27;s hit &quot;Impacto&quot;.

In July 2008, Daddy Yankee announced that as part of his work, he would produce a cover version of Thalía&#x27;s song, &quot;Ten Paciencia&quot;. On August 17, 2008, his soundtrack album &quot;Talento De Barrio&quot; for the eponymous film was released. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Daddy Yankee scheduled several activities, including an in-store contract signing. The album was awarded as &quot;Multi-Platinum&quot; by RIAA on April 17, 2009. On February 27, 2009, he performed at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival in Chile. In this event, the artists receive awards based on the public&#x27;s reaction. After performing &quot;Rompe&quot;, &quot;Llamado de emergencia&quot;, &quot;Ella Me Levantó&quot;, &quot;Gasolina&quot;, &quot;Limpia Parabrisas&quot; and &quot;Lo Que Pasó, Pasó&quot; over the course of two hours, Daddy Yankee received the &quot;Silver Torch&quot;, &quot;Gold Torch&quot; and &quot;Silver Seagull&quot; recognitions. On April 24, 2009, he received the Spirit of Hope Award as part of the Latin &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards ceremony. The recognition is given to the artists that participate in their community or social efforts throughout the year.

=== 2009–2013: &quot;Mundial&quot; and &quot;Prestige&quot; ===
The single, &quot;Grito Mundial&quot;, was released on October 8, 2009, in order to promote his ninth album, &quot;Mundial&quot;. The song was going to be the official theme for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, but Daddy Yankee rejected the FIFA offer, which gave them 100% of the rights. Despite releasing &quot;El Ritmo No Perdona (Prende)&quot; more than a month before, that single was not considered the first official promotional single. The second single, &quot;Descontrol&quot;, was released on January 12, 2010, and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Rhythm Airplay. The music video was filmed in New York City and was released on May 17, 2010. &quot;La Despedida&quot; was the third single, released on August 4, 2010. The song reached #4 in both Billboard Top Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs.

Daddy Yankee&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Prestige&quot; was released on September 11, 2012.

The album was certified as &quot;Gold&quot; by the RIAA on March 8, 2013.

The year 2012 had one of the most important genre events of the year: the reconciliation between Daddy Yankee and Wisin &amp; Yandel, after some years of rivalry. Six years after their last collaboration, Daddy Yankee appeared on the duo&#x27;s remix song &quot;Hipnotízame&quot;, with positive acclaim from fans. Two months later, on February 16, 2013, Wisin &amp; Yandel collaborated in the remix of &quot;Limbo&quot;. Later in 2013, the three artists performed songs like &quot;Hipnotízame&quot;, &quot;Mayor Que Yo&quot; and &quot;Noche de Entierro&quot; in two concerts (one in Puerto Rico and another in Colombia).

On February 25, 2013, Daddy Yankee performed in the 2013 Viña del Mar International Song Festival, to a sold-out audience. He performed hits like &quot;Limbo&quot;, &quot;Gasolina&quot;, &quot;Pose&quot;, &quot;Ella Me Levantó&quot; and &quot;Descontrol&quot;. He won the Silver and Golden Torch and the Silver and Golden Seagull recognitions. In 2013, Daddy Yankee performed on his Prestige World Tour, touring several countries in Europe including, Spain, Germany, France and Italy. He has also toured in Colombia, Peru, Chile to sold-out audiences. In 2013 he released music videos of &quot;El Amante&quot; featuring J Alvarez, &quot;Summertime&quot; and &quot;Noche de los Dos&quot; featuring Natalia Jimenez, with millions of views on YouTube.

=== 2013–2015: &quot;King Daddy&quot; ===
On October 29, 2013, Daddy Yankee released a mixtape entitled &quot;King Daddy&quot;, produced by Los de la Nazza (Musicólogo &amp; Menes), as part the &quot;Imperio Nazza&quot; Mixtapes series and was released as a digital-format only. The mixtape was made because of the high demand from the fans and is a return to his original reggaeton roots. It includes 11 tracks with collaborations from J Alvarez, Arcángel, Yandel, Farruko, and Divino. According to Daddy Yankee, &quot;King Daddy&quot; was recorded in two and a half weeks, because there was &quot;a lot of inspiration&quot;. The song &quot;La Rompe Carros&quot; has garnered popularity among the public, but his hit single was &quot;La Nueva y La Ex&quot; which has been widely received all over South America, Europe, and North America. During a press conference earlier this year, Daddy Yankee announced the physical release of King Daddy scheduled for later this year with 3 or 4 bonus tracks for a total of 14 or 15 songs included.

From May 13 to June 22, 2014, Daddy Yankee performed on his &quot;King Daddy Tour&quot;, touring several cities in Europe. He has also toured in South and North American cities. In Spain, his concerts were on the 4º position in the box-office ranking, being the first Latin artist on the top 5 in this country, underneath Iron Maiden and the Rolling Stones, and over artists like Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus and Michael Bublé.

On June 17, 2014, the single &quot;Ora por Mí&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Pray for Me&quot;) was released as part of the King Daddy&#x27;s bonus tracks and uses the Scorpions&#x27; &quot;Send Me An Angel&quot; instrumental, with a rap sampler. The official video for &quot;Ora Por Mí&quot; was released on June 24, 2014. It was filmed in many locations in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and talks about Ayala&#x27;s life and the dark side of fame. According to Daddy Yankee, it is the most personal song of his career. On September 2, 2014, it was released another single called &quot;Palabras Con Sentido&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Words With Sentiments&quot;), which defends reggaeton and urban music of all the accusations of being a &quot;society poison&quot;. Daddy Yankee expressed that all music has something good to give, even urban music. On his single, he also says that urban music saves lives, like his own, and the solution would be that churches have to remain, journalists have to tell the truth, artists have to have more inspiration, and the rich people have to help the poor ones. On September 9, 2014, he released his first totally English single called &quot;This Is Not A Love Song&quot; featuring new rapper Duncan.

=== 2016–2023: Continued success, &quot;Despacito&quot;, &quot;Legendaddy&quot; and retirement ===
On April 28, 2016, Daddy Yankee was awarded the &quot;Industry Leader Award&quot; during the 2016 Latin &quot;Billboard&quot; Awards. After a decade-long feud with longtime rival Don Omar for the &quot;King of Reggaeton&quot; title, in early 2016 Daddy Yankee and Don Omar announced in a &quot;Billboard&quot; press conference that they would perform together on stage in a concert series called The Kingdom Tour. The tour announcement left many fans in disbelief as it sold out in minutes in major cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles, New York. The concerts were structured like a boxing match, where the two artists got to trade off musical rounds, and fans voted for their winner in each city via an app designed for the event. &quot;Two kings, one throne&quot;, said Pina Records founder Rafael Pina, who had a well-established relationship with both artists, and who also came up with the idea for the tour concept. Discussing the tour and his rivalry with Daddy Yankee, Don Omar said &quot;Let me clarify: I am not his best friend, and he is not my best friend, but we respect each other. That desire to be the best is what has pushed us to be better.&quot;

In 2017, Daddy Yankee, in collaboration with Latin pop singer Luis Fonsi, released the hit single &quot;Despacito&quot;. It became the first Spanish-language song to hit number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 since &quot;Macarena&quot; in 1996. The single gained global success. The official video for &quot;Despacito&quot; on YouTube received its billionth view on April 20, 2017, after 97 days, becoming the second-fastest video on the site to reach the milestone behind Adele&#x27;s &quot;Hello&quot;. Its success led Daddy Yankee to become the most listened artist worldwide on the streaming service Spotify in June 2017, being the first Latin artist to do so.

In early 2018, Daddy Yankee released his first latin trap singles with the song &quot;Hielo&quot;, and on the single &quot;Vuelve&quot; on which he collaborated with Bad Bunny. In August 2018, Daddy Yankee collaborated with Janet Jackson on her return to music on the song &quot;Made for Now&quot;. He released the 2019 single &quot;Con Calma&quot;, a reimagination of Snow&#x27;s 1992 hit single &quot;Informer&quot;. Snow recorded new parts and the Spanish-language remake topped the charts of 20 countries and reached the top 10 in 10 others.

On March 21, 2022, Daddy Yankee announced his seventh and final studio album &quot;Legendaddy&quot;, which released on March 24, alongside its supporting tour, due to run from August to December. He also announced that he planned on retiring from music after completing the tour. On January 26, 2023, Rauw Alejandro released the single &quot;Panties y Brasieres&quot; with Yankee. On February 17, Yankee released the single &quot;La Hora y el Día&quot; with Justin Quiles and Dalex. On June 2, Yankee released the single &quot;Beachy&quot; with Omar Courtz. On June 16, Yandel released the single &quot;Yankee 150&quot; with Feid and Yankee. On June 26, Tainy released the single &quot;La Baby&quot; with Yankee, Feid and Sech. His final concert was on December 4, in San Juan. He later shared a post on Instagram confirming his retirement.

===2024–present: Standalone releases===

On January 2025, Yankee released the standalone single &quot;En el Desierto&quot;.

== Film and other career projects ==
Ayala has negotiated promotional deals with several companies outside of the music industry, releasing merchandise under his name. In 2005, he became the first Latin artist to sign a deal with Reebok, in order to produce accessories, including the licensed clothing line &quot;DY&quot;, which was released in 2006. He also teamed up with the company to have his own shoes and sporting goods made, which were first distributed on May 23, 2006. Reebok continued the partnership with the introduction of the Travel Trainer collection in July 2007. In August 2007, Pepsi began an advertising campaign titled &quot;Puertas&quot;, in which Ayala is depicted returning to his youth by opening a series of doors.

Ayala has worked in the film industry as both an actor and producer. His acting debut was as an extra in the 2004 film &quot;Vampiros&quot;, directed by Eduardo Ortiz and filmed in Puerto Rico. The film premiered at the Festival of Latin American Cinema in New York, where it received a positive reaction. This led Image Entertainment to produce a DVD, internationally released in March 2005. Ayala played the main role, &quot;Edgar Dinero&quot;, in &quot;Talento de Barrio&quot;, which was filmed in Puerto Rico and directed by José Iván Santiago. Ayala produced the film, which is based on his experience of growing up in a poor city neighborhood. While the film is not directly a biography, Ayala has stated that it mirrors his early life. &quot;Talento de Barrio&#x27;s&quot; debut was scheduled for July 23, 2008, in New York&#x27;s Latino Film Festival. After the premier, Ayala expressed satisfaction, saying that he had been invited to audition for other producers. On release, &quot;Talento de Barrio&quot; broke the record held by &quot;Maldeamores&quot; for the most tickets to a Puerto Rican movie sold in a single day in Caribbean Cinemas.

Ayala has been involved in the administration of three organizations, the first being El Cartel Records which he co-owns with Andres Hernandez. He also created the &quot;Fundación Corazón Guerrero&quot;, a charitable organization in Puerto Rico which works with young incarcerated people. On April 26, 2008, he was presented with a &quot;Latino of the Year Award&quot; by the student organization &quot;Presencia Latina&quot; of Harvard College, receiving it for his work with Puerto Rican youth and creating &quot;Corazón Guerrero&quot;. On February 6, 2008, Ayala announced in a Baloncesto Superior Nacional press conference that he had bought part of the Criollos de Caguas&#x27; ownership. He has also been active with Cruz Roja Puerto Rico in several media campaigns.

In March 2013, Daddy Yankee talked about a new movie production during an interview in Las Vegas. During an interview in a radio station in January 2014, Ayala announced the film, but he only mentioned that many reggaeton exponents would take part of it. In February 2014 it was confirmed that the movie would be about the boxer Macho Camacho&#x27;s life. According to Ayala, he had the boxer&#x27;s support to film the movie, but it remained unreleased after Camacho&#x27;s death on November 24, 2012. The film was due for release in 2015.

The most recent of Daddy Yankee&#x27;s non-music projects was the release of his game &quot;Trylogy&quot;, a 3D video game based in tower defense games. The game was presented at the New York Comic Con and was released on November 29, 2013. The game also features Ayala&#x27;s songs like &quot;Gasolina&quot; and &quot;Limbo&quot;.

Daddy Yankee served as an executive producer of &quot;Neon,&quot; A Netflix series about three friends who move from a small town in Florida to Miami with the hopes of making it big in the reggaeton world. Daddy Yankee also made a cameo in the show. The series premiered in 2023.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
Ayala has kept most of his personal life private, rarely speaking about it in interviews. He has said that he avoids doing so because such details are the only aspect of his life that are not public and that they are like a &quot;little treasure.&quot; In 2006 he spoke about his relationship with his wife, Mireddys González, and children in an interview with María Celeste Arrarás in &quot;Al Rojo Vivo&quot;. He stated that his marriage is strong because he and his wife are &quot;friends above anything&quot; and that he has tried to ignore other temptations because &quot;weakness is the reason for the downfall of several artists.&quot; He met his wife when they were little and at just 17 years old they decided to get married. As a result of the union, their first daughter, Yamilette Ayala González, was born. She was born when he was 17 years old, which he described as confusing at first, adding that raising a daughter at that age was a hard experience. He has another daughter, Jesaaelys, born in 1996, and a son, Jeremy, born in 1998. On December 1, 2024, Ayala revealed on his Instagram page that he and his wife were divorcing after nearly 30 years of marriage. Amid divorce proceedings, Ayala filed an injunction against Mireddys, claiming that she withdrew $100 million from his business accounts without authorization.

=== Political views ===
In 2008, Ayala participated in a campaign to promote voting in the 2008 general elections in Puerto Rico. This initiative included a concert titled &quot;Vota o quédate callado&quot; (&quot;Vote or Remain Silent&quot;).

On August 25, 2008, Ayala endorsed John McCain of the Republican Party in the 2008 United States presidential election, stating that McCain was a &quot;fighter for the Hispanic community&quot;. As part of this campaign, Ayala moderated a debate titled &quot;Vota o quédate callado: los candidatos responden a los jóvenes&quot;, which was aired on October 9, 2008.

In November 2019, Ayala inaugurated a museum of reggaeton at Plaza Las Américas, the first of its kind.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 2007, Daddy Yankee became the spokesperson of the environmental organization &quot;Yo Limpio a Puerto Rico&quot; (I Clean Puerto Rico) founded by Ignacio Barsottelli. Yo Limpio a Puerto Rico, PepsiCo and Wal-Mart announced a joint effort to promote recycling in Puerto Rico among the general public and schools across the island with the campaign &quot;Tómatelo en Serio, Recicla por Puerto Rico&quot; (Take it seriously, recycle for Puerto Rico), in which Daddy Yankee became the main spokesperson. This campaign incorporated a recycling contest among public and private schools from around the island in the elementary, junior high, and high school categories. The program established 16 recycling centers located at Wal-Mart and Sam&#x27;s Club stores across the island, where consumers were able to deposit recyclable items.

In 2017, Daddy Yankee donated $100,000 to the Food Bank of Puerto Rico after the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria. The money provided food to roughly 9,000 families on the island.

Daddy Yankee presented the HR Derby Champ medallion to Pete Alonso upon his winning the MLB HR Derby on July 8, 2019.

=== Beliefs ===
In December 2023, during his tour at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico, he announced that he had become Christian and wanted to serve in evangelization.

== Legacy ==
Daddy Yankee has been dubbed &quot;King of Reggaeton&quot; by media. Rachel Grace Almeida from &quot;Vice&quot; felt Daddy Yankee paved the way with his music to amplify and normalize the &quot;marginalised&quot; &quot;Latino&quot; identity. She also commented that Yankee played a vital part in &quot;bringing glamour to the &quot;barrio&quot; and challenged the mainstream media&#x27;s portrayal of Hispanic poverty in those neighbourhoods&quot;. He was highlighted by CNN and &quot;Time&quot; as one of the most influential Hispanics in the world. Roy Trakin from &quot;Pollstar&quot; considered his collaboration with Luis Fonsi in &quot;Despacito&quot; helped &quot;turn his native Puerto Rico&#x27;s music into a global phenomenon&quot;.

Daddy Yankee&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Barrio Fino&quot; (2004) ushered reggaeton into the mainstream. Its single &quot;Gasolina&quot; &quot;[altered] the business, sound and aesthetic of Latin music&quot;, stated &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;the genre would revive sales of Latin music, usher in a new radio format in the U.S. (Latin Rhythm Airplay) and establish the urban base responsible for many Latin radio hits today.&quot; According to Nestor Casonú, president for Kobalt Music Latin America, &quot;Daddy Yankee and &#x27;Gasolina&#x27; triggered the explosion of urban Latin music worldwide.&quot;

In 2006, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article deemed him &quot;The King of Reggaeton&quot; while commenting on 2004&#x27;s music revenue, &quot;one bright spot for the music industry was Latin music: sales grew by 12 percent, according to Nielsen SoundScan. At least some of that success is owed to reggaeton and by extension to Daddy Yankee, its top-selling act.&quot;

Multiple artists have cited him as an inspiration, including J Balvin, Ozuna, Bad Bunny, Tini, Lunay, Miguelito, and Natti Natasha.

== Achievements ==

Daddy Yankee has received several awards and honors, including 10 Guinness World Records and seven Billboard Music Awards (the most for any Latin artist). He was honored with the Icon Award by Latin American Music Awards, the Industry Leader Award from the Latin &quot;Billboard&quot; Awards and inducted into its Hall of Fame, and received the Lifetime Achievement Award in Lo Nuestro Awards from Balvin. J Balvin stated: &quot;Reggaeton would not be what it is without Daddy Yankee and without Yankee, there would be no Balvin&quot;.

Having sold 30 million records worldwide, Yankee is one of the best-selling Latin music artists. As of April 2020, Daddy Yankee is the most subscribed Latin artist on YouTube Music. He also is the first Latin act to be the most listened-to artist worldwide, and remains on Top 20 as of April 2020. In 2019, he set a new record in his country as the artist with the most shows at Coliseum of Puerto Rico, with 12 consecutive sold-out concerts.

Yankee has multiple charts records. He is the artist with the most number one and most entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Rhythm Airplay. He also has the most entries on the Latin Pop Airplay and the second most entries on Hot Latin Songs. Additionally, he achieved three and six top 25 and top 50 Spanish-language singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively, the most by any artist. &quot;Barrio Fino&quot; and &quot;Barrio Fino en Directo&quot; are two of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States.

With &quot;Despacito&quot;, both Yankee and Luis Fonsi achieved multiple worldwide records, including the most-viewed YouTube video (and it became the first video on the site to reach the milestones of three, four, five, six, and seven billion views) and the first Latin song to receive a diamond certification by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Additionally, &quot;Despacito&quot; received thirteen-times platinum by RIAA for units of over 13 million sales plus track-equivalent streams, making it then the highest-certified single in the United States. It also became the song with most weeks at number one in Switzerland and Germany, and the most weeks at number one on Hot Latin Songs.

<text>Ottorino Volonterio (7 December 1917 – 10 March 2003) was a racing driver from Switzerland.
==Biography==
A member of Swiss nobility, he was born in Orselina and was trained as a lawyer, before he began participating in sports car racing.

He debuted in Formula One at the 1954 Spanish Grand Prix at Pedralbes in a Maserati 250F which he shared with Emmanuel de Graffenried, but the compatriots retired with engine failure. He contested two other World Championship Grands Prix, the 1956 German Grand Prix on the Nürburgring &quot;Nordschleife&quot; where he was unclassified having finished 6 laps behind race winner Juan Manuel Fangio, and the 1957 Italian Grand Prix at Monza with André Simon where he finished 11th some 15 laps behind the winner Stirling Moss.

Volonterio continued to compete in non-championship Formula One races and sports cars, with his best result a second place in the Coupe de Paris at Montlhéry in 1955. He also fielded Grand Prix cars for other drivers. He continued racing until 1973, and died in Lugano in 2003.

<doc id="1235356" wikidata="Q171613" url="?curid=1235356" title="Paolo Barilla">
<text>Paolo Barilla (born 20 April 1961) is a businessman and a former Formula One driver who raced for the Minardi team. He is now the Deputy Chairman of the Barilla Group and, as of January 2017, had a net worth of US$1.39 billion.

==Racing career==
Barilla started racing in 1975 and won the Italian 100cc karting title the following year. He entered Formula Fiat Abarth in 1980 and the next year moved up to Formula 3, in which he won some races and finished third in the Italian Championship. He then entered Formula 2 in 1982 with Minardi, but between 1983 and 1988 he concentrated in sports car racing, winning 24 Hours of Le Mans by a three-lap margin in 1985, among other victories, in the Joest Racing Porsche 956, co-driven at various times with Klaus Ludwig, Paul Belmondo, Marc Duez and Louis Krages (also known at the time as John Winter).

In 1987 Barilla returned to single-seaters and raced in the Japanese Formula 3000 Championship, before returning to Minardi in 1989 for a test. This test gave him the chance to replace Pierluigi Martini at Suzuka that year and afterwards was signed to drive for the team in 1990. Barilla wasn&#x27;t quick enough to qualify regularly and was replaced before the end of the year by Gianni Morbidelli.

In 2014, Barilla won the Monaco Historic Grand Prix in the Formula 3 class driving a Chevron B34.

Barilla was featured in a 2017 documentary about the restoration of a Ferrari 312B historic Formula 1 race car.

==Business career==
In 1990 Barilla retired from racing and joined his family&#x27;s businesses. Upon his return to the corporation, he briefly filled in as the CEO from 1999 to 2000 before taking a more permanent position as a Deputy Chairman.

In 2010 he was appointed President of the Industrial Association AIDEPI (Associazione delle Industrie Dolciarie e Pastaie Italiane), established in the same year. From 2010 onwards, he held numerous membership positions until he was appointed, in 2014, Vice-president of the Barilla Center for Food &amp; Nutrition Foundation, a multidisciplinary and independent thinking center that works on food sustainability.
In 2016 Barilla was elected President of the International Pasta Organization (IPO), a non-profit association dedicated to increasing consumption and awareness of pasta, promoting consumer understanding of the nutritional value and health benefits of food.
From March 2017 to December 2018, he was the Chairman of the Italian Food Association (Unione Italiana Food), and since 1 January 2019, he has taken on the role of Deputy Vice-Chairman, a position aligned with the commitments taken to protect the industry, both nationally and internationally.

Since July 2020 he is a member of the Confindustria Executive Council (Consiglio Direttivo).

<text>Patrick Gaillard (; born 12 February 1952) is a former racing driver from France. He participated in 5 World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 1 July 1979. He scored no championship points.

After performing well in French Formula Renault and Formula 3, Gaillard moved into Formula 2 in 1979, the same year as he drove for Ensign in Formula 1. The Ensign N179 was not a good car and Gaillard struggled on occasions, failing to qualify three times out of five, before being dropped in favour of Marc Surer.

In 1980 Gaillard returned to Ensign for the Spanish Grand Prix and finished in a points-paying 6th place—the last of 6 cars still running at the finish, 5 laps down. However, the result did not count as this race was subsequently downgraded to non-Championship status due to the FISA–FOCA war (F1 sporting body versus the F1 manufacturers), making Gaillard&#x27;s only point nullified.

Thereafter he drove in Formula 2, CanAm, and sports cars including the 24 Hours of Le Mans before retiring. He later became a racing instructor.

After a one-off drive with Ensign, he spent 1977 with newly formed Williams Grand Prix Engineering, driving a March with very little in the way of results. The following year he tried to enter his own March in his home grand prix, but it was not authorized.

<text>Paul Alexandre Belmondo (born 23 April 1963) is a French actor and racing driver who raced in Formula One for the March and Pacific Racing teams. He was born in Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine, the son of actor Jean-Paul Belmondo and grandson of sculptor Paul Belmondo. Around 1981, Paul gained publicity for becoming the lover of Princess Stéphanie of Monaco.

Through 1987, he participated in Formula 3 and Formula 3000, although he was never a top 10 championship finisher in either. In 1992, he joined the March F1 team as a pay driver, getting a ninth place at the Hungarian Grand Prix, but only qualifying 4 more times before he ran out of money and was replaced by Emanuele Naspetti. Two years later he became a member of the uncompetitive Pacific Grand Prix team, where he only qualified for two races and was usually behind teammate Bertrand Gachot. Thereafter he concentrated on GT racing, at the wheel of a Chrysler Viper GTS-R. He started his own team, &quot;Paul Belmondo Racing&quot;, which raced in the FIA GT Championship and Le Mans Endurance Series championship before folding in 2007.

<doc id="1235362" wikidata="Q1570656" url="?curid=1235362" title="United States midterm election">
<text>Midterm elections in the United States are the general elections that are held near the midpoint of a president&#x27;s four-year term of office, on Election Day on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Federal offices that are up for election during the midterms include all 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives, and 33 or 34 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate.

In addition, 34 of the 50 U.S. states elect their governors for four-year terms during midterm elections, while Vermont and New Hampshire elect governors to two-year terms in both midterm and presidential elections. Thus, 36 governors are elected during midterm elections. Many states also elect officers to their state legislatures in midterm years. There are also elections held at the municipal level. On the ballot are many mayors, other local public offices, and a wide variety of citizen and legislatively referred initiatives.

Special elections are often held in conjunction with regular elections, so additional Senators, governors and other local officials may be elected to partial terms.

Midterm elections historically generate lower voter turnout than presidential elections. While the latter have had turnouts of about 50–60% over the past 60 years, only about 40% of those eligible to vote go to the polls in midterm elections. Historically, midterm elections often see the president&#x27;s party lose seats in Congress, and also frequently see the president&#x27;s opposite-party opponents gain control of one or both houses of Congress.

==Background==
While Article II, Section 1, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution sets the U.S. president&#x27;s term of office to four years, Article I, Section 2, Clause 1 sets a two-year term for congressmembers elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Article I, Section 3, Clause 1 then sets a six-year term for those elected to the U.S. Senate, with Clause 2 dividing the chamber into three &quot;classes&quot; so that approximately one-third of those seats are up for election every two years.

The elections for many state and local government offices are held during the midterms so they are not overshadowed or influenced by the presidential election. Still, a number of state and local governments instead prefer to avoid presidential and midterm years altogether and schedule their local races during odd-numbered &quot;off-years&quot;.

==Historical record of midterm==
Midterm elections are regarded as a referendum on the sitting president&#x27;s and/or incumbent party&#x27;s performance.

The party of the incumbent president tends to lose ground during midterm elections: since World War II, the president&#x27;s party has lost an average of 26 seats in the House, and an average of four seats in the Senate.

Moreover, since direct public midterm elections were introduced, in only eight of those (under presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden) has the president&#x27;s party gained seats in the House or the Senate, and of those only two (1934, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and 2002, George W. Bush) have seen the president&#x27;s party gain seats in &quot;both&quot; houses.

The losses suffered during a president&#x27;s second midterm tend to be more pronounced than during their first midterm, in what is described as a &quot;six-year itch&quot;.

<doc id="1235365" wikidata="Q270286" url="?curid=1235365" title="Christmas ornament">
<text>Christmas ornaments, baubles, globes, &quot;Christmas bulbs&quot;, or &quot;Christmas bubbles&quot; are items, usually to decorate Christmas trees. These decorations may be woven, blown (glass or plastic), molded (ceramic or metal), carved from wood or expanded polystyrene, or made by other techniques.

Ornaments are available in a variety of geometric shapes and image depictions. Ornaments are almost always reused year after year rather than purchased annually, and family collections often contain a combination of commercially produced ornaments and decorations created by family members. Such collections are often passed on and augmented from generation to generation. Festive figures and images are commonly preferred.

Lucretia P. Hale&#x27;s story &quot;The Peterkins&#x27; Christmas-Tree&quot; offers a short catalog of the sorts of ornaments used in the 1870s:
The modern-day mold-blown colored glass Christmas ornament was invented in the small German town of Lauscha in the mid-16th century.

== History ==

=== Invention ===

The first decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes, and pastries in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers. Glass baubles were first made in Lauscha, Germany, by Hans Greiner, who produced garlands of glass beads and tin figures that could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations grew into the production of glass figures made by highly skilled artisans with clay molds.

The artisans heated a glass tube over a flame, then inserted the tube into a clay mold, blowing the heated glass to expand into the shape of the mold. The original ornaments were only in the shape of fruits and nuts.

After the glass cooled, a silver nitrate solution was swirled into it, a silvering technique developed in the 1850s by Justus von Liebig. After the nitrate solution dried, the ornament was hand-painted and topped with a cap and hook.

=== Export ===
Other glassblowers in Lauscha recognised the growing popularity of Christmas baubles and began producing them in various designs. Soon, the whole of Germany started to buy Christmas glassware from Lauscha. On Christmas Eve 1832, a young Victoria wrote about her delight at having a tree, hung with lights, ornaments, and presents placed round it. In the 1840s, after a picture of Victoria&#x27;s Christmas tree was shown in a London newspaper decorated with glass ornaments and baubles from her husband Prince Albert&#x27;s native Germany, Lauscha began exporting its products throughout Europe.

In the 1880s, American F. W. Woolworth discovered Lauscha&#x27;s baubles during a visit to Germany. He made a fortune by importing the German glass ornaments to the United States.

=== Mass production ===
William DeMuth created the first American-made glass ornaments in New York in 1870. In 1880, Woolworth&#x27;s began selling Lauscha glass ornaments. Other stores began selling Christmas ornaments by the late 19th century and by 1910, Woolworth&#x27;s had gone national with over 1000 stores bringing Christmas ornaments across America. New suppliers popped up everywhere including Dresden die-cut fiberboard ornaments which were popular among families with small children.

By the 20th century, Woolworth&#x27;s had imported 200,000 ornaments and topped $25 million in sales from Christmas decorations alone. As of 2009, the Christmas decoration industry ranks second to gifts in seasonal sales.

Many silver companies, such as Gorham, Wallace, Towle, Lunt and Reed &amp; Barton, began manufacturing silver Christmas ornaments in 1970 and 1971.

In 1973, Hallmark Cards started manufacturing Christmas ornaments. The first collection included 18 ornaments, including six glass ball ornaments. The Hallmark Keepsake Ornament collection is dated and available for just one year. By 1998, 11 million American households collected Hallmark ornaments, and 250,000 people were member of the Keepsake Ornament Collector&#x27;s Club. There were as many as 400 local Keepsake Ornament Collector&#x27;s Club chapters in the US. One noted Christmas ornament authority is Clara Johnson Scroggins who has written extensively on the topic and has one of the largest private collections of Christmas ornaments.

In 1996, the ornament industry generated $2.4 billion in total annual sales, an increase of 25% over the previous year. Industry experts estimated more than 22 million US households collected Christmas ornaments, and that 75% of those households collected Hallmark Keepsake Ornaments.

=== Post–World War II ===
After World War II, the East German government turned most of Lauscha&#x27;s glassworks into state-owned entities, and production of baubles in Lauscha ceased. After the Berlin Wall came down, most of the firms were reestablished as private companies. As of 2009, there are still about 20 small glass-blowing firms active in Lauscha that produce baubles. One of the producers is Krebs Glas Lauscha, part of the Krebs family, which is now one of the largest producers of glass ornaments worldwide.

== Modern baubles ==
Although glass baubles are still produced, as expensive good-quality ornaments often found at markets, baubles are now frequently made from plastic and available worldwide in a massive variety of shapes, colours and designs. Since the 19th century, there are a large number of manufacturers producing sophisticated Christmas glass ornaments in Poland, which produce &quot;&quot;bombka&quot; or the plural form &quot;bombki&quot;&quot;; Poland is the largest producer of glass bombe (bauble) ornaments that are exported to many countries all over the world, mainly to the United States, Japan, Australia, Sweden, Norway, France, the UK, and millions of glass-blown Christmas ornaments are made year-round in Tlalpujahua, Michoacan, Mexico, and exported to Spain, New Zealand and France. They are also made in Chignahuapan, Puebla, Mexico.

== Handcrafted ==
Handcrafted Christmas ornaments have become a staple of craft fairs, and many smaller online businesses owe much of their success to both the internet and the growth of craft stores. Sugar cookies, popcorn balls, gingerbread and many types of cookies can be used as ornaments.

<text>The Capitulary of Quierzy () was a capitulary of Emperor Charles II that had a series of measures to safeguard the administration of his realm during his second Italian expedition, as well as directions for his son Louis the Stammerer, who was entrusted with the government during his father&#x27;s absence. It has traditionally been seen as the basis on which the major vassals of the kingdom of France such as the counts of Flanders, were enabled to become more independent.

It was promulgated on 14 June 877 at Quierzy-sur-Oise in France (&quot;département&quot; of Aisne), the site of a Carolingian royal palace, before a great concourse of clergy and nobles. Among the participants were Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims; Gauzlin, Bishop of Paris; and Reginar, Duke of Lorraine. In the document, Charles took elaborate precautions against Louis, whom he apparently deeply distrusted. He forbade him to stay in certain palaces and particularly forests and compelled him to swear not to despoil his stepmother, Richilde, of her allodial lands and benefices. Charles also refused to allow Louis to nominate to the countships that were left vacant in the emperor&#x27;s absence. In principle, the &quot;honores&quot; (benefices) and the office of a deceased count had to be given to his son, who would be placed provisionally in possession by Louis. The definitive investiture, however, could be conferred only by Charles.

The capitulary thus served as a guarantee to the aristocracy that the general usage would be followed and was also a means of reassuring the counts who had accompanied the emperor into Italy as to the fate of their benefices. It cannot, however, be regarded as introducing a new principle, and the old opinion that the capitulary was a legislative text to establish the hereditary system of fiefs has been proved to be untenable.

An earlier capitulary of Charles the Bald was promulgated at Quierzy on 14 February 857 and aimed especially at the repression of brigandage.

<doc id="1235383" wikidata="Q634253" url="?curid=1235383" title="Yotvata">
<text>:&quot;&quot;Yotvat&quot; is also the Hebrew name for Tiran Island&quot;.
Yotvata (, ) is a kibbutz in the Arava Valley in southern Israel. Located on the Highway 90&#x27;s segment known as the Arava Road, adjacent to the southern Negev, it falls under the jurisdiction of Hevel Eilot Regional Council. In , it had a population of .

The Arava Valley is an arid desert where the average annual rainfall is less than 30 mm and temperatures often exceed 40 °C (104 °F) in summer and 21 °C (70 °F) in winter.

==Location==
Located approximately 40 km north of the Red Sea, Yotvata is most prosperous Kibbutz in Hevel Eilot Regional Council. Being relatively far from major urban centers (41 kilometers north of Eilat and 130 kilometers south of Dimona), it is the center of the region, where most regional facilities are based, including a regional school, regional council offices, community center, sports center, movies and concert hall, and local airfield.

==History==
===Establishment===
Yotvata was formed in 1951 as a Nahal settlement named Ein Radian. In 1957, it became the first kibbutz in the southern Arava region, affiliated Ihud HaKvutzot VeHaKibbutzim. The kibbutz was named for an Israelite encampment mentioned in Numbers 33:34 and Deuteronomy 10:7: &quot;…from there they went to Gudgodah, and then to Jotbatha, a land of streaming water&quot;. Some say that biblical Yotvata was closer to the Red Sea near Taba.

The founders were a small group of men and women after military service. The challenges were many: the burning sun, heat, shortage of water, infertile land, distance from other settled areas and no solid source of income. They experimented with different crops, such as grapes, pomegranates and vegetables. They also tried to raise cattle and chickens but with little success. A date plantation proved more suitable to the arid conditions.

At that point, they decided to found a dairy that would provide milk to Eilat although breeding milking cows in the desert was considered an impossible mission. In 1962 the dairy was founded, with four cows. The person who came up with the idea was Ori Horazo (1939–1966). The Jewish Agency refused to finance the project but the Israeli Trade and Industry Minister, Pinhas Sapir agreed. In its first year, the dairy produced 500,000 liters of milk. By 2008, it was producing 62 million liters a year and controlled 63% of the Israeli dairy-beverage market (making NIS 400 million a year), and 49% of the fortified milk market (making NIS 250 million a year). It employed 130 workers and had 700 cows. The dairies of Kibbutz Yahel, Lotan, and Ketura provide milk for Yotvata.

In 1960, the first children of the community were born, and six years later the school opened with three first graders; today there are 200 kids in the kibbutz, and 600 students from all of the region communities attend the Maale Shaharut School in Yotvata from 1st grade until 12th grade.

===Archaeology===
Judging by the numerous historic forts surrounding the Kibbutz, Yotvata&#x27;s location was a strategic one:
* Southwest of the kibbutz lies a Roman fortress built during the reign of the Emperor Diocletian (dated c. 300 AD) as part of a line of border fortresses (the &quot;Limes Arabicus&quot;) in the Negev, in order to protect the trade route from marauding Arab nomads.
* East of the kibbutz lies an ancient Arab resting fortress with towers in its corners, dating from the Nabataeans era (c. 700 AD) and served as a resting station for the convoys crossing the desert.
* On a hill west of the kibbutz (50 m), there is an ancient fort dating from the Iron Age (c. 12th century BCE). The fort overlooks the wellspring, and is considered to have served the Egyptians copper miners.
* East of the kibbutz to the north and to the south there is a wells-chain (known as Fugaras) connected with a tunnel that leads the aquifer water to the surface. Fugaras is an ancient but sophisticated irrigation system.
* North of the kibbutz are two ancient leopard traps. Leopards are known to have inhabited this area.

==Economy and community==
Yotvata is a cooperative community, where most adult residents work on the kibbutz in production, services or education. The revenues are equally distributed among the members regardless of their position, along the idea of &quot;each one gives as much as he can and gets as much as he needs&quot;. Most of daily affairs are conducted communally: education, holidays, dining (three meals a day conducted in the commune dining room give the community more relaxed time to spend together) and more.

Yotvata Dairy is a milk products factory which provides the kibbutz with its main source of income and occupies the highest number of members.

Agriculture ranks second in terms of income but perhaps first in importance to the community character and pride. Agriculture branches are irrigated land (onions, potatoes, corn, animal feed, garlic and pumpkins), plantations (dates and mangos) and a big and modern dairy farm.
There is a large road station with restaurant, local ice cream and souvenir shop on the Arava Road.

Other small branches are a picturesque horse stable that lies in the date plantation east to the kibbutz and a few artistic studios.

All members take turns contributing to the kibbutz service branches: kitchen, dining room, laundry, and security.

The kibbutz gets all its drinking and irrigation water from aquifer wells in the Arava Valley.

==Attractions==
Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve is dedicated to reintroducing extinct species mentioned in the Bible, as well as other endangered desert animals, to the wild. It has three parts: a park for herbivorous animals; a Predators Center that displays reptiles, small desert animals and large predators; and the Desert Night Life Exhibition Hall to observe nocturnal animals during their active hours.

15 km south of Yotvata lies Timna valley, where the sandstone and calcareous rock formations present some breathtaking desert features such as the Solomon&#x27;s Pillars, Arches and a Mushroom. Timna is also known for its ancient copper mines.

The area provides many great desert walks including canyons, roman routes, sand dunes, fossil hunting, rock-climbing and more.

<doc id="1235384" wikidata="Q172342" url="?curid=1235384" title="Paul Hawkins (racing driver)">
<text>Robert Paul Hawkins (12 October 1937 – 26 May 1969) was an Australian motor racing driver. The son of a racing motorcyclist-turned-church minister, Hawkins was a capable single-seater driver but really made his mark as an outstanding sports car competitor driving Ford GT40s and Lola T70s. In 1969 Hawkins was included in the FIA list of graded drivers, an elite group of 27 drivers who by their achievements were rated the best in the world.

Hawkins was hugely popular and known as &quot;Hawkeye&quot;; the son of a gentleman of the cloth, he was a colourful character with a wide colourful vocabulary. He was also famous for being one of two racers to crash into the harbour at the Monaco Grand Prix.

==Early racing career==
Hawkins began racing in Australia with an Austin-Healey in 1958. He left Australia and arrived in England in 1960. He found employment with the Donald Healey Motor Company Ltd., under John Sprinzel:
&quot;I put an ad in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspaper looking for a mechanic and employed a really good guy to be our works foreman; his name was Paul Hawkins. Paul literally came in straight off the boat from Australia. He’d done a little bit of racing and was a very good mechanic, very good as he knew his stuff, and certainly knew the best parts of the English language, too.&quot;
Hawkins was soon behind the wheel of an Austin-Healey Sprite, racing at the Aintree 200 meeting on 30 April 1960, and winning his class in the GT race. He then finished 38th at the 1960 Nürburgring 1000 km race, with co-driver Cyril Simson, known as Team 221, on a &quot;miserable foggy day in May&quot;. In 1961 at Le Mans Hawkins teamed with John Colgate in an Austin-Healey Sprite, but they retired in the eighth hour with engine problems. On Whit Monday, 1962, at Crystal Palace Hawkins drove Ian Walker&#x27;s Lotus-Ford to victory in the up to 1,150 c.c. sports car race, setting lap and race records. At Le Mans in 1965 Hawkins, with John Rhodes, finished twelfth overall, and first in class, in a 1.3-litre Austin-Healey Sebring Sprite entered by the Donald Healey Motor Company, completing 278 laps.

Hawkins also drove single-seaters, participating in the first race run to the new Formula Two regulations at Pau on 5 April 1964, finishing seventh in a pushrod Alexis. He was entered in a Team Alexis Alexis-Cosworth at Silverstone on 20 March 1965 but the race was abandoned due to heavy rain. He went on to win the Formula Two Eifelrennen race on the Nürburgring south circuit, in bad weather, in an Alexis-Cosworth Mk. 7 on 25 April 1965.

==Formula One racing==

Hawkins participated in three Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 1 January 1965 at the South African Grand Prix in a pushrod Ford 1500cc-engined Brabham Formula Two car. Like fellow-Australian Frank Gardner he started with the John Willment Automobiles team. He scored no championship points, as his best finish was ninth on his debut. He did have two podium finishes in the non-championship Rand Grand Prix, held in South Africa. He finished second in 1964 and third in 1965. In 1964 he won the Rhodesian Grand Prix in the Brabham and in 1965 he also won the Cape South Easter Formula One Trophy. He was a non-starter in the 1965 British Grand Prix and retired from the German Grand Prix that year with an oil leak.

He is one of only two Formula One drivers, along with Italian Alberto Ascari, to have crashed into the harbour in Monaco during a Grand Prix. He did so during the 1965 race, when he spun at the chicane after 79 of the 100 laps. He escaped from the crash unhurt: 
&quot;At this point there was a bit of a furore at the chicane for 
Hawkins struck the wooden barrier at the entry and spun through the straw bales and over the edge of the quay and into the harbour. 
The Lotus sank to the bottom and the rugged Australian bobbed to the surface and struck out for shore, while boats went to his rescue.&quot;
==Sports car racing==
Hawkins had some considerable success in the World Sports Car Championship. On 14 May 1967, he won the Targa Florio, in Sicily, teamed with Rolf Stommelen, in the factory-entered 8-cylinder Porsche 910. On 23 May 1967, he finished second in the Nürburgring 1000 km in a Porsche 910. He also won the Zeltweg 500 km race on 20 August 1967, in a Ford GT40. On 15 October 1967, at the end of the season Hawkins, paired with Jacky Ickx, won the Paris 1000 km race at Montlhéry in a J.W. Automotive Mirage.

Then on 25 April 1968, he won the Monza 1000 km race with David Hobbs in a Ford GT40, finished second in the Watkins Glen 6-hour, again with Hobbs, and scored thirds at the Nürburgring 1000 km with Jacky Ickx and Zeltweg 500 km races. On 23 November 1968, he won the Cape Town Three Hours solo in a Ferrari P4.

Hawkins was building a business as an owner/operator of racing cars, and in the spring of 1969 he moved his racing shop from North London to Slough. He was killed when his Lola T70 MkIIIB GT crashed and burned at Island Bend during the 1969 RAC Tourist Trophy at Oulton Park.

Contemporary Mike Hailwood gave the following quote in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; article concerning Hawkins&#x27; death: &quot;The news of his death horrified me. I can hardly believe that a man as skilful and as experienced as he was should be killed in this way.&quot;

<text>Paul Pietsch (20 June 1911 – 31 May 2012) was a racing driver, journalist and publisher from Germany, who founded the magazine &quot;Das Auto&quot;. He was the first German ever to take part in a Formula One Grand Prix.

==Biography==
Born in Freiburg, Pietsch began his racing career in 1932 with a private Bugatti and Alfa Romeo.

Racing with an Alfa Romeo, he won the 1933 III Svenska Isloppet GP ice race in Hemfjärden, and the 1934 I Vallentunaloppet ice race in Vellentunasjön, both in Sweden.

In the 1935 German Grand Prix he raced for Auto Union, and he finished third in the 1935 Italian Grand Prix before leaving the team with its hard-to-drive rear engines. From 1937 onwards he entered a private Maserati. His greatest hours came in the 1939 German Grand Prix which he led from lap two until the ignition failed, making him drop down to third, which was still an excellent result for a privateer against the dominant force of the Silver Arrows.

After the war, he participated in three World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on September 3, 1950. His drive in a factory Alfa Romeo in the 1951 German Grand Prix ended with an accident. He scored no championship points.

At that time, Pietsch was already a successful editor and publisher of motorcycle and automobile magazines. His company, Motor Presse Stuttgart, is the largest in the European market for technology and special interest magazines.

From the death of his countryman Karl Kling in 2003 until his own death, Pietsch was the oldest surviving Formula One driver, at age 100 and the last surviving driver of pre-war grand prix era. His son Peter-Paul Pietsch races often at the Nürburgring with fellow journalists.

On 31 May 2012, Pietsch died from pneumonia at the age of 100 years, 11 months and 11 days. Pietsch was also the first &quot;Grand Prix&quot; driver to reach the age of 100.

<text>Gerard Carlton &quot;Pete&quot; Lovely (April 11, 1926 – May 15, 2011) was a racecar driver and businessman from the United States. He was born in Livingston, Montana.

==Racing career==
On November 9, 1957, Lovely won the first ever race held at Laguna Seca, driving a Ferrari. Lovely participated in 11 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on May 10, 1959. He scored no championship points. He won the S3.0 class and achieved a podium overall at the 1960 12 Hours of Sebring with a Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa. He was best known in his Formula One career for racing various private Lotus cars in World Championship events (usually entered under the banner of &#x27;Pete Lovely Volkswagen&#x27;) including a hybrid made from a Lotus 69 Formula Two car fitted with a Formula One-specification, 3.0L Cosworth DFV V8 engine. After his retirement from Formula One he was an entrant in various kinds of racing in the USA until the 1980s. Lovely&#x27;s racing career spanned more than 50 years, and he continued to participate in Vintage and Historic events into the 2000s.

==Business career==
Lovely opened &quot;Pete Lovely Volkswagen&quot;, a Volkswagen dealership in Fife, Washington, in 1954 and ran it for 34 years. He also owned &quot;Pete Lovely Racing&quot; which restored vintage race cars.

Pete&#x27;s only son, Chris, began working on Pete&#x27;s cars at a young age and went on to become a highly respected mechanic in Can-Am, CART, Champ Car and IndyCar, working for championship-winning teams.

<text>Peter Hawthorn Ashdown (born 16 October 1934 in Danbury, Essex) is a former motor racing driver. He drove in a single Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, racing a Cooper.

 Ashdown had trained as a vehicle mechanic, and had been a few years in the Royal Air Force when he started racing. First seen in a Dellow with a Ford 10 engine, he continued around 1955 to race in a Lotus Mark IX as a privateer, not being part of any particular racing team.

Prior to Formula One, he was one of the leaders of the British Formula Junior scene, but an accident at Rouen-Les-Essarts in 1958, in which he broke his collarbone, considerably hampered his career.

He continued racing, and competed in a Formula Two (F2) Cooper-Climax entered by Alan Brown at the 1959 British Grand Prix at Aintree. He finished in 12th position, third of the F2 cars and six laps down.

From there he drove a Formula Junior Lola and many small-engined sports cars, winning his class in the 1960 and 1962 1000km of Nürburgring. On the latter occasion at the Nordschleife, he and the co-driver Bruce Johnstone scored the debut win for Lotus 23 in the 1L Sportscar class with a 997cc Cosworth Mk.III as a semi-works entry (Ian Walker Racing), while the other semi-works (Essex Racing Stable) Lotus 23 of Jim Clark crashed on lap 12 of the 44 lap race.

He retired in 1962 and focused his efforts on a Vauxhall dealership in Essex.

<text>Peter William Broeker (15 May 1926 - 4 November 1980) was a racing driver from Canada. He participated in one World Championship Formula One Grand Prix, the 1963 United States Grand Prix, driving a Stebro, a car of his own construction. He finished seventh, albeit 22 laps down, and scored no championship points. According to the Toronto Star at the time: &quot;Broeker, first Canadian ever to compete in a world championship Formula One race in a Canadian-built car, finished seventh over-all despite giving away more than 80 horsepower to the rest of the field of 21.&quot; He owned Stebro, an aftermarkets performance parts company that is still in operation.

In 1973 Broeker wrote and published &quot;Olympic Coins: From Antiquity to the Present&quot;. He held US citizenship as well as Canadian.

<text>Hugh Anderson Haralson (November 13, 1805 – September 25, 1854) was an American farmer, lawyer and politician based in Lagrange, Georgia.

==Early years and education==
Hugh Haralson was born November 13, 1805, in Greene County, Georgia. He graduated from Franklin College of Arts and Sciences (University of Georgia). After graduation, Haralson was admitted to the bar by way of a special act of the Legislature, because he was under the age of twenty-one.

==Political and military careers==
Haralson first served in the Georgia House of Representatives, at age 26, from 1831 to 1832. He was next elected to the Georgia State Senate in 1836, and served from 1837 to 1838. He was commissioned as a major general in the Georgia Militia, 9th Division, in 1838. Haralson was originally a member of the Whig Party, but left when that party advocated for a restoration of the Bank of the United States, something that Haralson was opposed to because of his Jeffersonian leanings. Haralson subsequently joined the Democratic Party and stood for election to Congress under that banner. Despite the fact that Georgia voted overwhelmingly for the Whig party, in 1840, Haralson was elected as a Democrat two years later. Haralson represented Georgia in the U.S. Congress from 1843 to 1851, where he was chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs during the Mexican–American War. He was the father-in-law of the famous Confederate General, and Georgia governor John B. Gordon.

==Death and legacy==
Hugh A. Haralson died September 25, 1854, in LaGrange, Georgia. Haralson County, Georgia and the city of Haralson, Georgia in Coweta County, are named in his honor.

<text>Toftir () is a village in Nes Municipality on the island of Eysturoy, in the Faroe Islands. It is part of a chain of villages stretching over a distance of 10 kilometres on the east side of Skálafjørður (fjord) on Eysturoy island. The highest hill in Toftir, called &quot;Húkslond&quot;, is 129 metres high, and Nes Municipality is the only area in the Faroes which has no mountains above 200 metres.

The Lake Toftir area was the first area in the Faroe Islands to become a Nature reserve in the 1980s, and in 2006 Nes Municipality, in cooperation with neighbouring Runavík Municipality, joined a network of local authorities in the Nordic countries working to halt the loss of biodiversity in their local areas.

== History ==

The settlement of Toftir dates back to the &quot;landnám&quot; (settlement) period. According to local lore, only one woman survived the Black Death (1348–1350), which left the village in ruins; hence the name Toftir, meaning &quot;ruins&quot;. The village name prior to the Black Death is said to have been Hella, meaning &quot;slope&quot;, which refers to the gradual sloping hillside on which the village is built.

== Local economy ==

Toftir has one major retail store with late opening hours, one café &quot;Í Hópinum&quot;, which serves liquor, and a shop, &quot;Navia&quot; which sells woollens and also souvenirs. Toftir has a relatively large harbour with a filleting plant that opened in 1969, and hosts the headquarters of Faroe Fish Market.

== Fredericks Church ==

Fredericks Church (&quot;Fríðrikskirkjan&quot;) (CotFI) in Nes was completed in 1994 and was named in honor of Fríðrikur Petersen (1853-1917) who served as rural dean on Nes from 1900 to 1917. 

Other local religious communities include the Inner mission which is a revivalist movement of the Plymouth Brethren and the Baháʼí Community.

== Sport ==
The major sports venue in Toftir is the Svangaskarð, the first of its kind in the Faroe Islands. Like most Faroese settlements, Toftir used to participate in the National Rowing sport of the Faroe Islands, but ceased participating in this sport in the 1980s. The village&#x27;s football team, B68 Toftir, was established in 1962 and has won the Faroese league 3 times, in 1984, 1985 and 1992.

The local swimming club &quot;Flot&quot; was established in 1984; it participates in the national swimming competitions in the islands. In 2009 a Volleyball team was established in Toftir; in 2010 the name &quot;Ternan&quot; was chosen for the team. Toftir is also home to one of the pioneering chess clubs in the islands, &quot;Tofta Talvfelag&quot; which has won the Islands&#x27; Chess Championships once. The Toftir Boat Association (&quot;Bátafelagið&quot;) was established on 13 March 2005, and two months later the first Boat Festival was held in Toftir; it is now held every year on the first weekend of May.

<doc id="1235402" wikidata="Q590733" url="?curid=1235402" title="Stebro">
<text>Stebro was a Canadian constructor of Formula Junior racing cars. The team also competed in one Formula One race, the 1963 United States Grand Prix, where their one car finished in seventh place.

Peter Broeker, the owner and president of a firm of automotive accessory manufacturers, designed and built the Stebros in his Montreal plant, to promote the company in the Canadian market. A Stebro Formula Junior chassis, fitted with an enlarged Ford 105E engine appeared in one Formula One Grand Prix, the 1963 United States Grand Prix. The engine, including a Hewland gearbox, was the only alteration, with the Weber Ford 1,500 c.c. engine developing . The car was driven by Broeker and, against the more powerful Formula One cars of the day, finished in seventh place, completing 88 of the 110 laps. Broeker&#x27;s Stebro later won the all-formula sprint at the Indian Summer Trophy races at Mosport on September 4, 1965.

Around 1959, Peter Broeker had introduced the Stebro brand of performance exhaust systems for imported cars. Initially, these were imported from Italy through an association with Frank Reisner (who was in the initial stages of creating Intermeccanica). Broeker quickly set up a plant to fabricate these exhaust systems in Pointe Claire, Quebec, and eventually moved to eastern Ontario. After ending the race program, Stebro remained a manufacturer of performance exhaust systems for European and American cars until some point after Broeker&#x27;s death in 1980. Two decades later, the Stebro name and jigs were eventually purchased by a Swiss mechanic called Andy Petschenig; he reintroduced the Stebro brand, now featuring stainless steel and concentrating at first on Italian automobile applications. Their products were developed and manufactured from a factory near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Problems with delivery hurt their reputation and the new Stebro went out of business in 2013.

==Motor racing==

Peter Broeker moved to Canada with his family at the end of World War II. He opened an automotive repair business in Hamilton, Ontario, moving to Montreal later in the fifties, where he opened the Stebro Garage. Though a fan of racing, it was not until his move to Montreal that he became serious with the sport, especially single seat formula car racing. Soon he was supply the racing world with customized exhaust systems to improve performance, and later would become a race car constructor.

The Stebro Mark 1, the first of Stebro, was built in 1960 in the Stebro repair garage on McGill street in Montreal. It had a front engine formula junior design powered by a BMC engine and drive train. The second evolution of the Stebro was the Mark II, a mid-engine design also powered by BMC. The Mark III was a modified Sadler MKV sports racer. The Sadler was modified by adding eight inches to the wheelbase and fitted with a conventional transaxle.

The Mark IV was built over the winter in 1962 and 1963. It featured a space frame chassis made of thin wall chrome-moly tubing. The body was clothed in aluminum and original powered by a modified Ford FJ engine mated to a Hewland MKIV five speed gearbox. In the front was a conventional upper and lower A-arm suspension setup, with a reversed lower A-arm and upper top link in the rear. Girling brakes, courtesy of a Lotus 21 F1 car, could be found at all four corners. The large fuel tank meant it could race more than the traditional 20 lap Formula Junior race.

Broeker made a deal with Martin engines in England to purchase a supply of the F1 motors they were developing. These new powerplants were based on the recently introduced Ford of England 1500cc five bearing block. Broeker intended to build two cars and enter them in the 1963 United States Grand Prix. His intended drivers were to be John Cannon and Ernie DeVos, who had considerable success in FJ in Canada.

Like so many stories, the build did not go as planned and delays meant changes to the schedule. These delays meant there was not time to build two Mark IVs, so Broeker&#x27;s entry for the US GP was for one Mark IV and one Mark II, both fitted with Martin Ford Power. John Cannon tested the Mark IV and found it to be a capable machine, but then left Canada to race for John Mecom in the United States. Broeker then campaigned the Mark IV as an FJ for the remainder of the 1963 season.

The Martin F1 engine turned out to be troublesome and unreliable. As the dates for the US GP approached (at the time, the United States Grand Prix was held in September), Broeker kept asking for his motors, as he had already paid for them and was awaiting delivery. Martin continued to put off Broeker as they aggressively worked to resolve the engine problems. The engine was not ready in time, and Broeker was forced to find an alternative. He built up an essentially stock Ford 1500cc engine, using whatever performance products he could find from his current race motors, and trailered the car down to Watkins Glen. Enrie DeVos, realizing the car was seriously lacking in power, left - leaving Broeker as the team&#x27;s driver.

During practice, the front oil seal failed on the hastily built motor, causing oil to flow onto the track. He was able to qualify the car, just three and a half seconds slower than Baghetti in the ATS.

After about three laps into the race, the gearbox jammed in fourth gear. Broeker continued to race, though the car was down on power and not able to achieve its full speed due to the gearbox jam. As the checkered flag fell, Broeker was classified in seventh place, making him the first Canadian to compete in and finish a World Championship Grand Prix. The Stebro became the first and only Canadian-built car to do the same.

The following season, Broeker brought the car to Europe for the inaugural European Championship Formula II season. Power was from an 1100cc Martin Ford Motor, which would prove to be lacking compared to the finely tuned Cosworth engines. The best results were 8th places at Hockenhiem and Zeltwig.

Broeker returned to Canada, and in preparation for the 1965 season, he modified the Mark IV slightly, giving it a larger radiator, modified bodywork, and a Lotus Ford twin cam motor. In this guise, the car won many of its outings. For the next three years, the car accumulated over 100 victories across North America in Formula Libre and Formula B class races.

At a race in late September 1968, Broeker crashed the Stebro at the St. Jovite track. The car was badly damaged, but Broker was uninjured. The car was quickly rebuilt and tested, only to reveal problems with the handling. Instead of building a new car, Broeker purchased a British Chevron. Broeker would continue to race until his death in 1980.

Broeker had kept the Mark IV as a back-up car in case he needed it. After his death, it remained outside where it began deteriorating quickly. The current owner purchased the car in 1985 and began a complete restoration. After the work was completed, it was entered in a race in late September 1988. It won the vintage class at the Canadian Run Offs held at St. Jovite.

The car is currently powered by a Ford 1500cc, just like it was fitted when it raced in the US GP in 1963. It has its original gearbox and other major mechanical components. The bodywork is the original 1965 modified, including the paint job and the dents and dings of decades of racing. There is a modern roll bar, a fuel cell, fire extinguisher system, and seat belts to comply with modern racing requirements.

In period the Stebro raced in Formula Junior, F1, F2, Formula Libre and Formula B between 1963 - 1968.

In 2009, the car was offered for sale by Bonhams Auction at the Exceptional Motorcars and Automobilia sale in Carmel, CA. It was thought that it would sell for $70,000 - 100,000, but it left the auction unsold.

<text>Peter David de Klerk (16 March 1935 – 11 July 2015) was a racing driver from South Africa. He participated in four Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 28 December 1963. He scored no championship points.

==Alfa Special==

In 1962, de Klerk created a custom-made, single-seater racing special built for the South African Formula One Championship, powered by an Alfa Romeo Giulietta 1.5-litre straight-4 engine, which was christened as the &quot;Alfa Special&quot;. The Special participated in two World Championship Grands Prix, retiring at the 1963 South African Grand Prix and finishing 10th at the 1965 South African Grand Prix. It also entered five non-championship Grands Prix, scoring a podium finish at the 1963 Rand Grand Prix.

<doc id="1235405" wikidata="Q1027293" url="?curid=1235405" title="Tip O'Neill Award">
<text>The Tip O&#x27;Neill Award is given annually to a Canadian baseball player who is &quot;judged to have excelled in individual achievement and team contribution while adhering to the highest ideals of the game of baseball.&quot; The award was created by the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and first presented in 1984. It is named after James &quot;Tip&quot; O&#x27;Neill, one of the earliest Canadian stars in Major League Baseball (MLB).

Larry Walker, Jason Bay, Joey Votto, and Justin Morneau are the only players to win the Tip O&#x27;Neill Award at least three times. Walker won the award nine times, and Votto has won it seven times. Six winners – Walker, Bay, Terry Puhl, Rob Ducey, Ryan Dempster, and Corey Koskie – are members of the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. The award has been presented to one amateur player, Daniel Brabant. Walker, Votto, and Justin Morneau won the MLB Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award alongside the Tip O&#x27;Neill Award; the trio are the only Canadians to win the MLB MVP Award. Éric Gagné, the 2002 and 2003 recipient, compiled a major league record of 84 consecutive save opportunities converted from 2002 to 2004 and won the Cy Young Award in 2003. He and John Axford went on to win the Rolaids Relief Man Award in the same year as the Tip O&#x27;Neill Award. Bay became the first Canadian to win the Rookie of the Year Award, which he won the same year he won his first Tip O&#x27;Neill Award. Votto is the only award winner to also win the Hank Aaron Award.

Initially, the award was presented annually at either Exhibition Stadium or Rogers Centre in Toronto or Olympic Stadium in Montreal, depending on which venue the award winner&#x27;s team was scheduled to play at during the MLB season. However, as the Montreal Expos moved to Washington, D.C., and the Toronto Blue Jays do not host all the National League teams on an annual basis, the award has since also been presented at the home park of the yearly winning player. 

Josh Naylor of the Cleveland Guardians is the latest recipient (2023) of the award.

<text>The Alabama Theatre is a movie palace in Birmingham, Alabama, United States. It was built in 1927 by Paramount&#x27;s Publix Theatres chain as its flagship theater for the southeastern region of the United States. Seating 2,500 people at the time, it was the largest in the Birmingham theater district. The district was once home to many large theaters and movie palaces that featured vaudeville, performing arts, nickelodeons and Hollywood films. Built to show silent films, the Alabama still features its original Wurlitzer theater organ. The Alabama Theatre and Lyric Theatre are the district&#x27;s only remaining theaters, and as of 2024, both are in operation.
The Alabama and its historic organ were added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on February 15, 1977 and to the National Register of Historic Places on November 13, 1979. The theater has been surveyed by the Historic American Buildings Survey on several occasions, most recently in 1996. It was designated as the state&#x27;s historic theater in 1993.

==History==
Construction plans for the Alabama Theatre were announced in 1926, but groundbreaking was delayed until April 1, 1927. The grand opening was held as originally scheduled on December 26, 1927. Construction of the concrete-and-steel building cost approximately $1.5 million.
In 1934, the adjacent Loveman&#x27;s of Alabama department store was destroyed by fire. However, a thick firewall protected the theater and limited the impact to some smoke damage around air vents in the auditorium. The smoke stains would remain until the 1998 theater restoration.

In its early days, the Alabama Theatre hosted weekly Saturday meetings of the local chapter of Mickey Mouse Club, which was formed in 1933. By 1935, the club had more than 7,000 members, making it the world&#x27;s largest Mickey Mouse Club. Membership eventually peaked at more than 18,000 before the club closed nearly ten years after it had been formed.

The Alabama Theatre hosted the Miss Birmingham pageant from 1935 to 1948 and the Miss Alabama pageant from 1949 until 1966.
The decline of downtown Birmingham through the 1960s and 1970s saw the closing of most of the downtown&#x27;s movie theatres. In 1981, Plitt Theatres closed the Alabama and sold it to Cobb Theaters of Birmingham. Cobb unsuccessfully attempted to reopen the Alabama several times and eventually sold it to Costa and Head, developers working to revitalize the downtown area. Costa and Head initiated a series of classic films at the Alabama with some success, but ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 1986.

The Alabama chapter of the American Theatre Organ Society (ATOS) began maintaining the Alabama&#x27;s organ in the 1970s. The group sought permission to remove the organ from the Alabama in order to save it, but Costa and Head&#x27;s creditors deemed it the most valuable item in the building and forbade its removal. In response, the group began a fundraising effort to buy the theater, and it was purchased in 1987 by Birmingham Landmarks, Inc., a nonprofit organization originally started with the sole purpose of saving the theater. With the purchase, the theater was renamed the Alabama Theatre for the Performing Arts. In 1993, the Alabama was designated the official state historic theater of the state of Alabama.

In 1998, the Alabama Theatre underwent a complete restoration in which gold leaf and paint were cleaned or replaced, seats were replaced or recovered and some carpeting and drapes were replaced. The renovation coincided with the conversion of the 1935 Loveman&#x27;s building into the McWane Science Center.

Birmingham Landmarks continues to own the theater, as well as the Lyric Theatre, a 1914 vaudeville theater located across the street from the Alabama, which reopened in 2016 after an $11.5 million restoration. The Alabama hosts approximately 250 events each year, attracting more than 400,000 people to a variety of performances including Broadway-type theatre, ballet, opera, concerts and film.

==Organ==

When the Alabama Theatre was built in 1927, films were silent and required musical accompaniment, typically provided by an orchestra or theater pipe organ. The Alabama&#x27;s organ is a Crawford Special-Publix One Mighty Wurlitzer. Only 17 products of this model were built, and the Alabama&#x27;s organ, nicknamed Big Bertha, is one of only three still installed at their original sites.

The Alabama&#x27;s organ is a four-manual keyboard organ. It was originally installed with 20 ranks (sets of pipes) but has been expanded to 32. It also features numerous percussion instruments and sound effects to accompany silent films.

<doc id="1235428" wikidata="Q2179394" url="?curid=1235428" title="Nude swimming">
<text>Nude swimming is the practice of swimming without clothing, whether in natural bodies of water or in swimming pools. A colloquial term for nude swimming is &quot;&quot;.

In both British and American English, to swim means &quot;to move through water by moving the body or parts of the body&quot;. In British English, bathing also means swimming; but in American English, bathing refers to washing, or any immersion in liquid for hygienic, therapeutic, or ritual purposes. Many terms reflect British usage, such as sea bathing and bathing suit, although swimsuit is now more often used.

In prehistory and for much of ancient history, both swimming and bathing were done without clothes, although cultures have differed as to whether bathing ought to be segregated by sex. Christian societies have generally opposed mixed nude bathing, although not all early Christians immediately abandoned Roman traditions of mixed communal bathing. In Western societies into the 20th century, nude swimming was common for men and boys, particularly in male-only contexts and to a lesser extent in the presence of clothed women and girls. Some non-Western societies have continued to practice mixed nude bathing into the present, while some Western cultures became more tolerant of the practice over the course of the 20th century.

The contemporary practices of naturism include nude swimming. The widespread acceptance of naturism in many European countries has led to legal recognition of clothing-optional swimming in locations open to the public. After a brief period of popularity in the 1960s–1970s of public &quot;nude beaches&quot; in the United States, acceptance is declining, confining American nude swimming generally to private locations.

== History ==
Based upon rock painting found in caves, the human activity of swimming existed for many thousands of years prior to the first civilizations, during which humans were generally naked.

=== Ancient to early modern ===
In Ancient Egypt, clothing was symbolic of social status, making adult nudity an indicator of low status or poverty. However, children, even of the upper classes, would be naked until puberty. Manual laborers of either sex would wear a loincloth or skirt unless their tasks included swimming; fishermen and boatmen often being nude.

In ancient Rome, clothing also represented social status, but public bathhouses were an exception. Bathhouses might include swimming pools that were located in open courtyards.

Swimming became increasingly unpopular after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, being viewed by the Christian church as both sinful and unhealthy. In spite of church teaching, swimming and bathing returned in the 12th century, sometimes without segregation of the sexes. Defying the Church of England, Everard Digby&#x27;s book &quot;The Art of Swimming (De Arte Natandi)&quot; was published in 1587. Melchisédech Thévenot&#x27;s 1696 instruction book, also called &quot;The Art of Swimming&quot;, was illustrated by 40 copperplate etchings that showed swimming was normally nude.

Indigenous peoples swimming naked were depicted by colonists in the Americas beginning in the 16th century.

=== Modern era ===
==== Australia ====
In the Victorian era, public baths and swimming pools were built in Adelaide to address problems of health and safety, but also to reduce the persistence of nude swimming in open waters. Swimming costumes were issued to pool patrons.

==== England ====
Modest clothing for bathing or swimming was not considered until the 15th century, when women began wearing bathing dresses and men linen drawers. In male-only groups, men continued to swim nude in rivers and the sea until the mid-19th century.
=====18th century=====
The Bath Corporation official bathing dress code of 1737 prohibited men and women from swimming nude either in the day or in the night.

In the early 1730s, fashionable sea bathing initially followed the inland health-seeking tradition. Sea bathing resorts modelled themselves on Bath, and provided promenades, circulating libraries, and assembly rooms. While sea bathing or dipping, men and boys were naked, women and girls were encouraged to dip wearing loose clothing. Scarborough was the first resort to provide bathing machines for changing. Some men extended this to swimming in the sea, and by 1736, it was seen at Brighton and Margate, and later at Deal, Eastbourne, and Portsmouth.

In England, bathing in the sea by the lower classes was noted in Southampton by Thomas Gray in 1764, and in Exmouth in 1779. In Lancashire, working women and men bathed naked in the sea together in 1795: &quot;Lower classes of people of both sexes made an annual pilgrimage to Liverpool where they dabbled in the salt water for hours at each tide in promiscuous numbers and not much embarrassing themselves about appearance.&quot;

=====19th century=====

At the beginning of the Victorian period in England, men and boys typically swam naked in the sea near bathing machines that were used by women. Some efforts were made to designate separate beach sections for males and females. An 1842 review of seaside resorts noted that naked men in the sea were a primary attraction for visitors to Ramsgate, including women. The writer finds this no different from women viewing images of nude men in art galleries, near-naked men in the opera, or workers in the water. On the River Cherwell near the University of Oxford, an area for male nude bathing was known as Parson&#x27;s Pleasure.

In the latter half of the 19th century, the rise of the influence of Christian Evangelicals caused arrangements for mixed bathing to be reassessed. Moral pressures led some town councils to establish zones for the women and men to bathe separately. These areas were not policed; mixed bathing was a popular activity. Resorts attempted to placate the Evangelicals without upsetting traditional bathers. There are very few records of magistrates enforcing the bylaws. In 1895,&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; reported: &quot;At most English resorts, buff bathing is available before eight o&#x27;clock in the morning&quot; while Brighton, Worthing, Hastings, Bexhill, Bognor and Folkestone still tolerated nude bathing at any time of the day, in areas away from the central bathing areas.

Drawers, or &quot;caleçons &quot;as they were called (&quot;fr:caleçon de bain&quot;), came into use in the 1860s. Even then, many protested against them and wanted to remain in the nude. Rev. Francis Kilvert, an English clergyman and nude swimmer, described men&#x27;s bathing suits coming into use in the 1870s as &quot;a pair of very short red and white striped drawers&quot;. Excerpts from Kilvert&#x27;s diary show the transition in the England of the 1870s from an acceptance of nude bathing to the acceptance of bathing suits. Kilvert describes &quot;a delicious feeling of freedom in stripping in the open air and running down naked to the sea.&quot;

In 1895, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Standard&quot;, &quot;Daily Graphic&quot; and &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspapers ran a campaign to reintroduce mixed bathing in all resorts, pointing out that its prohibition split up families and encouraged them to take their holidays abroad. Commercial pressure defeated the moral pressures. Sea bathing had ceased to be done for health reasons and was done overwhelmingly for pleasure. As the segregated beaches in town disappeared, bathing costumes for men became part of the commercial package, and nude bathing ceased. 
The introduction of mixed bathing throughout Europe and elsewhere certainly created pressure towards bathing costumes being worn by both genders. However, well into the latter days of the Victorian Era, whereas all females were routinely wearing modest bathing attire, many boys well into their teens in Victorian England, even when in a mixed gender setting, were still swimming and playing at the beach resorts completely naked. An article published on August 23, 1891, in the &quot;Syracuse Sunday Herald&quot; suggests naked boys of up to 15 years in age were problematic for American parents with daughters, and read:

====South Africa====
From 1873, the East London, Eastern Cape town council promulgated measures to control swimming hours, apparel and especially separate swimming areas for men and women. These regulations were too conservative and constraining for the taste of the residents of this coastal town and for several decades they were the subject of legal battles, or were simply ignored. The dispute was finally settled in 1906 when mixed bathing was permitted with the proviso that both men and women should wear suitable swimming costumes.

====United States====
Benjamin Franklin and John Quincy Adams were known to skinny dip.

In 1850, Grand Rapids, Michigan addressed the issue of both men and women swimming nude in the Grand River by passing an ordinance allowing the activity only at night, between 8PM and 5AM.

== 20th century ==
Since the early 20th century, the naturist movement has developed in western countries, seeking a return to non-sexual nudity when swimming and during other appropriate activities.

===Canada===
In the late 19th to early 20th century, using tax revenue to provide public bathing facilities for working-class men was not politically popular in London, Ontario, while private establishments served the middle and upper classes. These included swimming at the YMCA, which required membership or payment of fees. However, the problem of men being publicly naked while swimming and bathing in open water was recognized. Efforts to regulate nude swimming with laws against doing so during daylight hours did not prevent increases in incidents in the 1860s through the 1880s by laborers and boys.

In the 19th century, boys and working-class men in Toronto swimming nude in the Humber and Don Rivers was allowed in secluded swimming holes, while officially prohibited elsewhere. Skinny-dipping was seen by many as an innocent activity for young males, as long it did not intrude upon the sensibilities of females. In the 20th century, urban growth had encroached upon this isolation, and also created the problem of water pollution. The development of beaches in the Sunnyside district on the Lake Ontario waterfront marked the end of nude outdoor swimming.

As in the United States, men swam nude at the YMCAs until they became coed.

===China===
In 2004 after some local university students went skinny-dipping there, signs were placed at a riverside beach in a public park in Zhejiang province declaring a section to be a nudist beach. Following complaints from other park visitors, the signs were removed, although officially China has no law forbidding swimming nude. In a July 2005 heat wave, a number of incidents of men skinny-dipping were noted.

===England===
In English boys&#x27; schools (Manchester Grammar School, for example), students recall nude swimming being required at least from the 1930s until the 1970s. No official reason for the practice was given, but some mention the problem in the early years of fibres from wool swimsuits clogged pool filters. However, nude swimming continued when modern swimsuit materials were available.

In a less formal setting, young boys might be nude in mixed company, as shown in a home movie of an outing featuring young Brownies, Girl Guides and Scouts playing in the grounds of a stately home in 1940s Britain. While the girls and older boys wore suits, the boys of about 10 years of age played in the river naked.

===Germany===

Mixed gender nude swimming in lakes, rivers and beaches following WWI was part of the social liberalization in the Weimar Republic. Some swimmers were part of the organized naturist movement, others sought only an escape from economic and political turmoil. Economic problems had eliminated support for swimming pools and other recreational facilities, these needs being replaced by &quot;wild swimming&quot; in natural bodies of water.

===Greece===
In the 1870s, sea bathing at the Athenian seafront was an activity dominated by working class men who swam naked. With the beginning of the 20th century, resorts for the middle class were established, a transition which was at odds with male nudity. This was dealt with by having separate male and female bathing areas, but these became difficult to enforce. In the 1910s, mixed gender bathing began, and became actual swimming away from shore rather that wading. Female beach attire became &quot;semi-nude&quot; by the standard of prior years, exposing women&#x27;s arms and legs.

===United States===

In the United States, skinny-dipping by young people, mostly boys, was common in rural areas across the country. As towns such as Logan, Utah, Humboldt, Iowa, and Dixon, Illinois, grew in the 1890s, the traditional locations became more visible to the public, and local ordinances were implemented prohibiting nude swimming, but were difficult to enforce, or involved very young children who were not punished. In 1907 Nashville, Tennessee, deputy sheriffs took no action to stop nude swimming by men and boys in the Cumberland River if they were outside populated areas.

The 1927 California Channel Swim between Catalina Island and the mainland was declared clothing optional by the sponsor, William Wrigley. Two Black American swimmers stated their intention to swim nude, as did several other women, saying the suits available were a handicap. In the 1927 Lake George 24 mile marathon, suits were optional if swimmers chose to cover their bodies with grease. 

U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt described nude swims in the Potomac with his &quot;tennis cabinet&quot; in his &quot;Autobiography&quot;: &quot;If we swam the Potomac, we usually took off our clothes&quot;.

Ernest Thompson Seton describes skinny dipping as one of the first activities of his Woodcraft Indians, a forerunner of the Scout movement, in 1902. A 1937 article on swimming at boy scout summer camps in Washington state makes no mention of the boys being naked in almost all the photographs. Descriptions of special &quot;carnival&quot; days that were coed did not mention whether swimsuits were available. It does state &quot;Both boys and girls enjoy the thrill of swimming in the nude, so on occasion, suits may be discarded for the night plunge.&quot; Night swimming was allowed only in camps where this was safe. In 1937, boys swimming nude in creeks of Atlanta, Georgia resulted only in warnings.

Among the features of rural Vermont being overtaken by development in the 1970s, an editorial mentions the removal of forests that sheltered ponds where boys had been swimming naked for 200 years. Older residents of Duncanville, Texas, remembered the &quot;Blue Hole&quot; on Ten Mile Creek a few hundred feet west of Main Street as the place to skinny-dip for decades. In 1967, misbehavior including drinking, fighting, and accidents led to complaints and calls to make the place off-limits.

====Swimming in indoor pools====
Initially, men and boys swam in the nude in indoor swimming pools, as had previously been customary in lakes and rivers. YMCAs everywhere had nude swimming beginning in the 1890s until they became coed in the 1960s. Given the limits of chlorination at that time, behavioral measures were used to maintain water quality. In 1933, in addition to recommending nudity, all bathers were required to empty their bladder and shower before entering the pool. Those suffering from skin or respiratory disease were prohibited from using the pool. In 1940 health experts continued to favor boys wearing bathing suits only in pools visible to both sexes. Girls were issued cotton suits that could be boiled to disinfect them between uses; the wool suits used by boys could not because they would shrink. It was also noted that wool suits that had previously been used in salt water could not be washed effectively because salt prevents soap from lathering. In 1926, the American Public Health Association (APHA) standards handbook recommended that indoor swimming pools used by men adopt nude bathing policies and that indoor swimming pools used by women require swimsuits &quot;of the simplest type&quot;. Students bringing their own suits was discouraged, the institutions not having control of decontamination.

In 1947 girls at the Liberty School in Highland Park, Michigan, also swam nude in their classes. Boys not having worn suits for years, girls requested to do the same in order to give them more time in the pool rather than changing. After six weeks, the girls in the middle school were ordered to wear suits, but the elementary school girls continued to be nude. While following the wishes of parents who believed older girls should behave modestly, all the board members disagreed, stating that there was &quot;no moral issue involved&quot;.

New developments in pool chlorination, filtration, and nylon swimsuits led the APHA to abandon its recommendation of nude swimming for males in 1962. However, the custom did not immediately cease. During the 1970s, the adoption of mixed-gender swimming led to the gradual abandonment of nude male swimming in schools. Federal Title IX rules mandating equality in physical education led most schools to switch to co-educational gym classes by 1980, ending nude swimming in public schools. In the 21st century, the practice has been forgotten, denied having existed, or viewed as an example of questionable behaviors in the past that are no longer acceptable. However, Jungian psychoanalyst Barry Miller views the sexualization of nudity in male only situations such as locker rooms and swimming pools as a loss.

== Contemporary practices ==

In many countries in the 21st century, nude swimming mostly takes place at nude beaches, naturist facilities, private swimming pools, or secluded or segregated public swimming areas. Some Western countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, have no laws prohibiting nude swimming in public areas, but some countries around the world strictly enforce various laws against public nudity, including nude swimming. Some jurisdictions which maintain laws against public nudity may turn a blind eye to incidents of skinny dipping depending on the circumstances, as police officers on the spot decline to make arrests.

A 2006 Roper poll showed that 25% of all American adults had been skinny dipping at least once, and that 74% believed nude swimming should be tolerated at accepted locations. Nude swimming is fairly common in rural areas of the United States, where unexpected visitors are less likely. However, in some places, even that type of swimming is prohibited by law. There is no federal law against nudity. Nude beaches such as Baker Beach in San Francisco operate within federal park lands in California. However, under a provision called &quot;concurrent jurisdiction&quot;, federal park rangers may enforce state and local laws against nudity or invite local authorities to do so. Skinny-dippers generally deal with this by keeping an eye out for local patrols, who generally do not go out of their way to find violators. Many swimmers in the United States confine nude swimming to private locations due to concerns about attitudes to public nudity.

In Germany, nude bathing is more widespread than in many other countries. A 2014 study revealed Germans (28%) were the most likely of all nations surveyed to have been nude at a beach. As urban rivers in Europe become cleaner, and residents more often seek relief from rising temperatures, many swim or sunbathe nude.

The world record for the largest skinny dip—2,505 persons—was set on 9 June 2018 at Meaghermore beach in County Wicklow, Ireland. The record was set at an annual all-women&#x27;s event known as Strip and Dip, which was created by cancer survivor Deirdre Featherstone. The 2018 event raised money for a national children&#x27;s cancer charity.

==Artistic depictions==
Nude swimming was a common subject of Old Masters – painters from before the 19th century – and Romantic oil paintings, usually bucolic or in a mythological or historical settings. For example, Swedish painters Georg Pauli and Anders Zorn painted a number of nude swimming scenes.

Late in the 19th century, painters started to render nude boys and men in realistic settings. Daumier&#x27;s &quot;Bathers&quot; shows youths clumsily hauling off their clothes (a symbol of repression) and a naked short stocky youth stepping cautiously into the water that represents freedom. Seurat&#x27;s &quot;Bathers Asnières&quot; uses similar symbolism to show the bathers removing their everyday identities to step into the momentary sunlight.

The bathers in Thomas Eakins&#x27; &quot;The Swimming Hole&quot; each represent different stages in the artist&#x27;s life. He prepared for this canvas by taking multiple photographs of his students frolicking at this location. The painting portrays a happy physical un-selfconsciousness seen through the perspective of age; a nostalgia for youth. By the 1880s, this nostalgia for youth was a veneer carefully disguising a latent homosexuality. In contrast, there were poets and painters who would contrast the free young beauty of bodies in the water with the approaching grind of maturity and responsibility. Henry Scott Tuke painted naked bathers in a soft, idealized style, deliberately avoiding overt sexuality.

Cezanne&#x27;s monumental male bathers derive from memories of a happy childhood rather than direct observation. This was described by his friend Emile Zola as a time when &quot;they were possessed with the joys of plunging (naked) into the deeper pools where the waters flowed, or spending the days stark naked in the sun, drying them selves on the burning sand, diving in once more to live in the river...&quot;

In later periods, depictions of nude swimming scenes became rarer, but more likely to depict straightforward contemporary scenes. The cover of the August 19, 1911, edition of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; had a Leyendecker painting of three boys; the cover of the June 4, 1921, edition had Norman Rockwell&#x27;s painting &quot;No Swimming&quot;, depicting boys in various states of undress escaping from the local authorities.

==In film==

A number of films have included nude swimming scenes, which have received varying reactions from reviewers and the public.
=== 20th century ===
* 1918 – &quot;Tad&#x27;s Swimming Hole&quot; was a silent comedy film by King Vidor; it had frontal shots of nude boys that were censored in some places e.g. Chicago.
* 1933 – &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, a Czech film directed by Gustav Machatý was banned in many places and censored in others. The film included a nude swimming scene with Hedy Lamarr in her film debut.

* 1934 – &quot;Tarzan and His Mate&quot; featured the female lead (played by a double) swimming nude. However, religious groups lobbied to have the scene removed. Three versions of this movie now exist.
* 1943 – &quot;Child Bride&quot; featured the female lead, 12-year-old Shirley Mills, swimming nude. It is considered the most notable scene on the film.
*1954 – &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; is a nudist film directed by Max Nosseck features Susan Lattimore. In &quot;Excelsior Pictures vs. New York Board of Regents&quot; the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that onscreen nudity was not obscene, allowing more open depictions of nudity in film.
*1960 – &quot;The Nudist Story&quot; is a British film directed by Ramsey Herrington set in the Avonmore Sun Camp, with people of all ages swimming in the camp pool.
* 1960 – &quot;Pollyanna&quot; starts with a close-up of the nude backside of a 6-year-old blond boy, played by William Betz, on a rope swing dropping into White Sulfur Springs, Santa Rosa, California; his mother was an extra on the film. The scene includes several other boys swimming nude in the river.
* 1962 – &quot; Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot;, an unfinished American film directed by George Cukor, features a long scene showing Ellen Wagstaff Arden (Marilyn Monroe) swimming nude in her home&#x27;s swimming pool. She tries to encourage her husband Nicholas Arden (Dean Martin) to join her and also inadvertently shocks an insurace salesman (Phil Silvers), who has stopped by for a brief meeting with her husband, after she gets out of the pool.
* 1965 – &quot; Crónicas de un Niño Solo (Chronicle of a Boy Alone)&quot;, an Argentine film directed by Leonardo Favio, features a long scene which shows a group of children swimming and walking nude in a forest lake.
* 1968 – &quot; Planet of the Apes&quot;, an American film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, features a scene in which George Taylor (Charlton Heston), Landon (Robert Gunner) and Dodge (Jeff Burton) are seen swimming nude together in a freshwater lake with lush vegetation which is in the middle of a desolate wasteland while their clothes are stolen and shredded by primitive mute humans.
* 1968 – &quot;Robby&quot;, an American film directed by Ralph C. Bluemke and inspired by the &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; story. It features the male leads, 8-year-old Robby (Warren Raum) and 10-year-old Friday (Ryp Siani), walking, playing and sea bathing in the nude together during several lengthy scenes which show full frontal nudity and rear nudity of both boys. As a result, the film failed to attain a wide distribution deal, as prospective distributors were wary about the extensive amount of nudity featured in the film. The film was shot on location on Vieques Island in Puerto Rico, the same island on which &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was shot five years earlier.
* 1968 – &quot;The Swimmer&quot;, an American film directed by Frank Perry and based on the 1964 short story &quot;The Swimmer&quot; by John Cheever. Burt Lancaster plays Neddy Merrill, a man who decides to return to his home eight miles away by visiting swimming pools he knows along the way. One belongs to a nudist couple who insist that he must be nude to use their pool, which he does. 
* 1969 – &quot;Age of Consent&quot;, a UK/Australian film by director Michael Powell&#x27;s film, an extended scene shows Helen Mirren (actually 24) playing a teenage girl, swimming underwater in an Australian reef.
* 1969 – &quot;La Gran Aventura (The Great Adventure)&quot;, a Mexican film directed by Roberto Rodríguez, features a brief scene in which Pepe (Julián Bravo) and Juanito (Nino del Arco) swim nude together in a lake alongside their pet dog before coming face to face and running away from a bull. 
* 1969 – &quot;My Side of the Mountain&quot;, an American film directed by James B. Clark, features a brief scene of the male lead, Sam Gribley (Teddy Eccles), bathing nude in a forest lake.
* 1970 – &quot;Woodstock&quot;, an American Documentary film directed by Michael Wadleigh, includes a segment focusing on those swimming in the pond nude and talking about its benefits and symbolism relative to the event.
*1971 – &quot;Christa&quot; is a Danish film directed by Jack O&#x27;Connell (renamed &quot;Swedish Fly Girls&quot; in English) about flight attendants sharing an apartment in Copenhagen with much domestic nudity as well as visits to a nude beach that includes families with children.
*1971 – &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; is an American film by Peter Bogdanovich that includes a skinny dipping party at the home of one of the teenagers.
* 1971 – &quot;Walkabout&quot;, an Australian/British film directed by Nicolas Roeg, shows actress Jenny Agutter and actors David Gulpilil and Luc Roeg swimming nude. The nude swimming scenes are set in several water holes in the Australian outback, during an extended time disconnected from civilization.
* 1972 – &quot;The Genesis Children&quot;, an art film directed by Anthony Aikman. Although it was called &quot;very benign&quot; by the US rating administration, it received an X rating. It has remained controversial ever since, because of several lengthy scenes featuring full frontal nudity and rear nudity which show a large group of teenage and preteen boys walking, dancing and swimming nude together on a beach.
* 1974 – &quot;Visit to a Chief&#x27;s Son&quot;, an American film directed by Lamont Johnson, features a brief scene in which Kevin (John Philip Hogdon) and his friend Codonyo (Jesse Kinaru) are seen swimming and playing nude together in a lake in which there are also several hippopotamus nearby. As Kevin goes into the water having taken off all his clothes, Codonyo remarks he notices his friend is already circumcised. Because of this scene the film was originally given an R-rating. In a 1974 interview, Johnson stated: &quot;Four frames of film in which a barely perceptible view of a 12-year-old boy&#x27;s penis appeared in an underwater sequence gave my movie &quot;Visit to a Chief&#x27;s Son&quot; an R-rating until the objectionable subliminal flash was blown up to eliminate it. That my film, from its conception to its final cut an unabashed family, kids-and-animals-in-Africa picture, should have the same rating as &quot;The Exorcist&quot; is an obscenity symptomatic of our national disease of censorship&quot;.
* 1974 – &quot;Vang Vir My &#x27;n Droom (The Spots on My Leopard/Catch Me a Dream)&quot;, a South African film directed by Tim Spring from a screenplay written by C.F. Beyers-Boshoff.

* 1979 – &quot;Blauvogel (Blue Bird)&quot;, a German film directed by Ulrich Weiß from a screenplay written by Gerd Gericke based on the 1950 novel by Anna Müller-Tannewitz. The film features a lengthy scene showing the male lead George Ruster (Robin Jaeger) alongside his adoptive Iroquois father Little Bear (Gheorghe Patru) and his young daughter Malia (Niculina Ursaru) all of whom are playing, swimming and fishing nude together in a forest river.

In the late Victorian period, two cousins, nine-year-old Richard and seven-year-old Emmeline Lestrange, and galley cook Paddy Button, are shipwrecked on a tropical island in the South Pacific. The children, played by Glenn Kohan and Elva Josephson, are shown playing and swimming nude on the beach. When Paddy dies after drinking a barrel of rum, the film moves forward to Emmeline (Brooke Shields, age 14 at the time) and Richard (Christopher Atkins, age 18) as teenagers. The underwater scenes of Emmeline swimming nude were filmed with an adult body double. In the scenes in which Shields is topless, her long hair is covering her breasts, while Atkins does his own nude scenes, including full frontal.

Cooper attended Dixon Academy in Shelbyville, Tennessee, and graduated from Jackson College in Jackson, Tennessee, in 1847. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1850.

== Political career==
Cooper served as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1853 to 1855 and again from 1857 to 1859. He was appointed judge of the former 7th Judicial Circuit in April, 1862.

<text>Loren Brooks Pope (July 13, 1910 – September 23, 2008) was an American writer and educational consultant, best known for his book, &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot;. He was also the education editor of &quot;The New York Times.&quot;

== Background ==
Born in Minneapolis, Pope grew up in northern Virginia. He was a Democrat, in a family of stalwart Republicans. He was an alumnus of DePauw University. Pope married and divorced Charlotte Swart Pope and Ida Wallace Pope. Pope was married 24 years to Viola Barrett Greenland Pope, who lived to the age of 96.

In 1965, Pope, founded the College Placement Bureau, one of the first independent college placement counseling services in the United States.

His first book, &quot;The Right College: How to Get In, Stay In, Get Back In&quot; (Macmillan, 1970), was followed by a nationally syndicated article series, &quot;Twenty Myths That Can Jinx Your College Choice,&quot; published in &quot;The Washington Post Magazine&quot; and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. A second book, &quot;Looking Beyond the Ivy League: Finding the College That’s Right for You&quot; (Penguin, 1995), was written and published several years later. Pope was also known for commissioning the Pope-Leighey House in 1939, designed and constructed originally in Falls Church, Virginia, by Frank Lloyd Wright. Pope, who was working as a $50-a-week copy editor at the Washington &quot;Evening Star&quot; (his employer financed the construction), convinced Wright to build the small house by writing him a famously flattering letter. Pope opened, &quot;There are certain things a man wants during life, and, of life. Material things and things of the spirit. The writer has one fervent wish that includes both. It is for a house created by you.&quot; He closed with the plea, &quot;Will you create a house for us? Will you?&quot; The architect&#x27;s reply was brief: &quot;Dear Loren Pope: Of course I am ready to give you a house.&quot;

==&quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot;==
His final and best-selling work, &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot;, profiled his top 40 choices—schools that he said would &quot;do as much as, and perhaps even more than, any name-brand schools to fully educate students and to give them rich, full lives.&quot; He focused mainly on small liberal arts colleges, arguing that smaller, less selective institutions offered superior educational experiences. The first edition was first published in 1996, with revised editions in 2000 and 2006. A final fourth revision was published in 2012 after Pope&#x27;s death, updated by Hilary Masell Oswald. A non-profit organization modeled after the book now carries the name.

The fourth edition profiles 40 choices for liberal arts colleges that &quot;have one primary mission: educate the undergraduate. Each appeals to a slightly different type of teenager, but they all share a mission to raise students&#x27; trajectories and develop thinkers, leaders, and moral citizens. The little-known truth is that these colleges have been on the cutting edge of higher education for decades. Many of them have outperformed most of the ranking sweethearts in the percentages of graduates who become America&#x27;s scientists and scholars.&quot;

<doc id="1235447" wikidata="Q852725" url="?curid=1235447" title="Montería">
<text>Montería () is a municipality and city located in northern Colombia and the capital of the Department of Córdoba. The city is located away from the Caribbean sea, by the Sinú River. The city and region are known for their distinct cultural heritages, which include a blend of mainly colonial Spanish descendants, Indigenous Zenú peoples, Crypto-Jews, and more recently, Middle East immigrants. The city is home to the Sombrero Vueltiao, a national symbol; and is the home of Porro folklore music. The city has an inland seaport connected to the Caribbean Sea by the Sinú River.

==History==
The area where the Department of Córdoba is located today was first settled by Zenú Indians, who lived near the banks of three rivers: the Sinú (Finzenú), the San Jorge (Panzenú) and the Nechí (Zenúfana). Montería was founded on May 1, 1777 by Spanish officer Antonio de la Torre y Miranda, being governor of the Province of Cartagena officer Juan de Torrezar Díaz Pimienta. The city, which had been named Montería by its inhabitants and located on the east side of the Sinú river, was then renamed &quot;San Jerónimo de Buenavista&quot; and moved to the west side of the river.

&quot;San Jerónimo de Buenavista&quot; was chosen by Antonio de la Torre y Miranda to name the city, in order to honor Saint Jerome, but people referred to it as Montería. In 1803, the city was burned by a group of natives, so the residents decided to move back to the Sinú&#x27;s east bank, where it remains today. In recent years, Monteria has seen a growth in population on the west side. In 1923, it became a municipality of Bolívar Department, and in 1952, it was designated as capital of the new Department of Córdoba. Montería was located within the boundaries of the Colombian Department of Bolívar until 1952 when it separated from Bolívar and became the capital of the new Department of Córdoba.

With a population of approximately 400,000, the city is considered to be one of the ten most important cities in Colombia and is locally known as La Perla del Sinú (The Pearl of the River Sinú).

==Geography and climate==

The city, which lies in the Sinú valley, is divided by the Sinú river and surrounded and sparsely populated by tropical flora and fauna. The town&#x27;s weather is mainly warm and moderately humid, with average yearly temperatures of . The area is subject to flooding.


==Media and communications==

===Newspapers===
* &quot;El Espectador&quot; (national daily newspaper)
* &quot;El Heraldo de Barranquilla&quot; (regional newspaper)
* &quot;Diario El Meridiano de Córdoba&quot;(regional newspaper)
* &quot;El Tiempo&quot; (national daily newspaper)
* &quot;El Universal&quot; (regional newspaper)

==Economy==
The town&#x27;s outskirts fuel the economy mainly through cattle and cattle ranching; within the city limits, there is a highly prosperous commercial district consisting of several shopping centres and malls, streets lined with shops, and numerous restaurant chains. It is considered to be the “Cattle Farming Capital” of Colombia, and celebrates this title with a yearly festival. The singer-songwriter Manuel Turizo (along with his older brother Júlian, also a talented musician) was born in Montería and grew up on a local cattle farm, the family having been involved in the cattle industry. In one particular interview, when asked what his “favorite foods” were, Turizo answered confidently, “&quot;The ‘cow-meat’! Cows!&quot;”

Additionally, Montería is one of the most important destinations for musical acts in the country, featuring several excellent stadiums, arenas, convention centres, and other performance venues. Montería has hosted many notable musicians and celebrities on tour, such as Maelo Ruiz, Jorge Celedón, Shakira, Years and Years, Juanes, Carlos Vives, and others.

==Transportation==
Monteria lies on a major highway connecting Medellín to Sincelejo and extending to Cartagena and Barranquilla. It has an effective public transportation system and arterial connections to the rest of the country.

===Public transportation===
As is common in most Colombian municipalities, public transportation is tightly integrated into the city. A system of taxis and several lines of large and small buses serve the community on surface streets. The streets of Monteria are also full of motorcycle taxis or &quot;rapimotos&quot; that provide economical transportation.

A passenger-only ferry system known as &quot;Planchones&quot;, consists of roofed wooden rafts. It traverses the Sinu river along a system of manual cable tows. It was made as a way to cross the river before a proper bridge could be built and has served as an alternative to cross the river ever since. It is one of the most remarkable features of the city.

===Water===

The city is served by a fishing port, but the waters of the Sinu river do not run deep enough and are not wide enough to serve as a commercial channel. High quality sand is brought up from the bottom of the river in buckets placed by divers, for use in the making of cinder blocks for local and regional construction projects.

===Air travel===
Monteria is home to an international airport, Los Garzones Airport, which provides service to major cities via Avianca, Easyfly and LATAM airlines.

Major cities served from the airport include Bogotá, Medellín, Cali and Panama City.

==Demographics==
The region is populated by a diverse mix of people, including the descendants of Spaniards/Basque, Arabs, French, Italians and Sinu Indians, a tribe of natives with their own language that once produced ornate pottery and goldworks. According to 2018 estimates, the population of Monteria was 490,935, with a population density of 160 persons per square kilometer.

<text>Theodore Zeldin (born 22 August 1933) is a British academic and current Associate Fellow of Green Templeton College, Oxford. He is the author of &quot;A History of French Passions&quot;, a quotidian history of the French people, as well as &quot;An Intimate History of Humanity&quot;. He is also a Fellow of St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, having previously been its dean for 13 years, and a Fellow of the British Academy and the Royal Society of Literature.

==Personal life==
Theodore Zeldin was born on 22 August 1933, the son of Russian-Jewish parents who later chose to become naturalised British subjects. His father was a civil engineer, an expert in bridge-building, a colonel in the Russian Czarist Army, and a socialist who rejected the Bolsheviks. Zeldin&#x27;s mother, the daughter of an industrialist, was a dentist who completed her training in Vienna. Escaping from the Russian Civil War, Zeldin&#x27;s parents emigrated to Palestine, where his father worked for the British Colonial Service building railways. He was disappointed by the failure of the movement for Arab-Jewish solidarity, which he favoured together with other scientists and intellectuals, and of which the railwaymen&#x27;s trade union was a vocal advocate.

Zeldin was educated at the English School Heliopolis (a coeducational boarding school) and at Aylesbury Grammar School. He graduated from Birkbeck, University of London at the age of 17, having studied philosophy, history, and Latin, and then from Christ Church, Oxford studying modern history. He received Firsts from both, followed by a doctorate from the newly established St Antony&#x27;s College in Oxford. He has been a Fellow (now Emeritus) of the college since 1957 and was its dean for thirteen years, playing a lead role in developing it as the university&#x27;s centre for international studies. Now, as an Associate Fellow of Green-Templeton College, Oxford, he is active in its Future of Work project.

Zeldin has been elected a Fellow of the British Academy and of the Royal Society of Literature, and is a member of the European Academy. He has been decorated as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, a Commander of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur and a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters of France. Zeldin also holds the Wolfson Prize, Britain&#x27;s top award for history.

He has been married to Deirdre Wilson, the co-inventor of relevance theory, since 1975; they live in an Art Deco house outside Oxford. His hobbies are &#x27;gardening, painting and mending things&#x27;.

<text>STS-61-H was a NASA Space Shuttle mission planned to launch on 24 June 1986 using &quot;Columbia&quot;. However, it was canceled after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

== Crew ==
=== Backup crew ===
== Crew notes ==
Before Buchli was assigned to STS-61-H, Norman E. Thagard was the potential Mission Specialist 3 for this flight.

== Mission objectives ==
The main task of the mission was to bring two commercial satellites into orbit – Palapa B3 and Westar-6S, and military communication satellite - Skynet-4A, The British Skynet and the Indonesian Palapa were supposed to be accompanied by an astronaut from the two countries.

After the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, the deployment of commercial satellites by the Space Shuttle was stopped, and for several years no international astronauts were nominated. Thus, neither the British nor the Indonesian payload specialists got a second chance for a spaceflight. The NASA crew however stayed together and participated in a 56-hour-long simulated mission known as STS-61-M(T) in 1987. The crew finally flew on STS-29, with Anna L. Fisher being replaced by James P. Bagian.

Skynet 4A was launched on 1 January 1990 with a Titan III, Westar-6S was renamed Galaxy-6 and launched on 12 October 1992 by an Ariane 44L. Palapa-B3 was renamed to Palapa B2P and was launched on 20 March 1987 with a Delta-3920.

<doc id="1235459" wikidata="Q2500278" url="?curid=1235459" title="River-class frigate">
<text>The River class was a class of 151 frigates launched between 1941 and 1944 for use as anti-submarine convoy escorts in the North Atlantic. The majority served with the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), with some serving in the other Allied navies: the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the Free French Naval Forces, the Royal Netherlands Navy and, post-war, the South African Navy.

The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940, and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada, they were named for towns and cities, though they kept the same designation. Originally called a &quot;twin-screw corvette&quot;, the name &quot;frigate&quot; was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy W. Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the locks on the Lachine Canal so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal. In all, Canada ordered the construction of 70 frigates, including ten for the Royal Navy, which transferred two ( and ) to the United States Navy. These served as the basis of the US Navy Tacoma class frigate series. Twelve were built in Australia for the RAN (four to a modified design).

After World War II, they found employment in many other navies the world over; several RCN ships were sunk as breakwaters. One, , was purchased by Aristotle Onassis and converted into the luxury yacht .

==Design==

The River-class ships were designed by naval engineer William Reed, of Smith&#x27;s Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees, to have the endurance and anti-submarine capabilities of the sloops, while being quick and cheap to build in civil dockyards using the machinery (e.g. reciprocating steam engines instead of turbines) and construction techniques pioneered in the building of the s. Its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy, including the Flower class.

Improvements over the corvette design included markedly better accommodation. The twin engines gave only more speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette to at . Among other lessons applied to the design was armament better designed to combat U-boats, including a twin mount forward and 12-pounder [] aft. Fifteen Canadian frigates were initially fitted with one gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the twin mount. For underwater targets, it was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar, depth charge rails and four side-mounted throwers aft for a 10-charge pattern (some had 8 throwers for a 14-charge pattern for a brief period until this was abandoned).

River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan-beam active sonar transmitter, in addition to the regular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing, unless a target was struck. Better radar and radio direction-finding equipment improved the RCN&#x27;s ability to find and track enemy submarines over previous classes. The River-class design was used as the basis for the United States Navy (which served in the Royal Navy as the ); the hull design was later elaborated into the and subsequently the .

==Ships in class==

Two hundred and forty-three frigates were built in Britain, Canada and Australia for seven navies during World War II.

==Vessels lost in action==
==Survivors==
On display in Brisbane, Australia is , the last complete River-class frigate, preserved at the Queensland Maritime Museum.

 served as a convoy escort during the Battle of the Atlantic and was present at the D-Day landings. In 1947, Greek shipowner Aristotle Onassis purchased her for scrap value and converted her into a luxurious superyacht named &quot;Christina O&quot;, after his daughter. The vessel is now owned by John Paul Nicolaou, who lets the yacht for elite charters and cruises.

, formerly served as a convoy escort during World War II and later transferred to the Israeli Navy and then the Royal Ceylon Navy, which later became the Sri Lankan Navy. She was withdrawn from active duty in 1980 and is now used as a training ship by Sri Lanka.

, formerly , is preserved in Seikkyi, Myanmar.

==In fiction==
&quot;HMS &quot;Saltash&quot;&quot; was a fictional River-class frigate in Nicholas Monsarrat&#x27;s 1951 book &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;. (In the 1953 Jack Hawkins film version she is called &quot;HMS &quot;Saltash Castle&quot;&quot;, and was played by the corvette .)

 played the fictional frigate &quot;HMS &quot;Rockhampton&quot;&quot; in the 1955 John Wayne film &quot;The Sea Chase&quot;. (She had just been recommissioned as a &quot;Prestonian&quot; class upgrade of the Canadian River-class frigate, after ten years in reserve.)

&quot;HMS &quot;Nairn&quot;&quot; was a fictional River-class frigate in Alistair MacLean&#x27;s 1955 book &quot;HMS Ulysses&quot;.

<text>Quirites is the name of Roman citizens in their peacetime functions. Its use excluded military statute. During the mutiny of his legions in 47 BC, Julius Caesar expressed the dismissal of his army by addressing them as Quirites, implying his soldiers had been returned to civilian life.

== Etymology ==
Latin &quot;Quirītis&quot; most likely stems from an earlier *&quot;quiri-&quot;, although an etymology from *&quot;queri&quot;- cannot be excluded in view of the sporadic assimilation of *&quot;e&quot; to an &quot;i&quot; in the following syllable. Its original meaning remains uncertain. According to linguist Michiel de Vaan, since the &quot;quirīs&quot; and &quot;Quirīnus&quot; are connected with Sabellic immigrants into Rome in ancient legends, it may be a loanword. Ancient etymologies derived the term from the Sabine word for &quot;spear&quot;, or from the Sabine capitol of Cures, after the Sabine people were assimilated early in Roman history.

The etymology &quot;*ko-wir-&quot;, then *&quot;co-uiri-um&quot;, &#x27;assembly of the men&#x27;, has been proposed by some scholars, although de Vaan notes that it &quot;is not credible phonetically and not very compelling semantically&quot;.

Combined in the phrase &quot;populus Romanus quirites&quot; (or &quot;quiritium&quot;) it denoted the individual citizen as contrasted with the community. Hence &quot;ius quiritium&quot; in Roman law is full Roman citizenship. Subsequently, the term was applied (sometimes in a deprecatory sense, cf. Tac. &quot;Ann.&quot; ~. 42) to the Romans in domestic affairs, Romani being reserved for foreign affairs.

The English word &quot;cry&quot; comes from French &quot;crier&quot;, from Latin &quot;quirītāre&quot;, meaning &#x27;to raise a plaintive cry, a public outcry&#x27;. According to Varro, it originally meant &#x27;to implore the aid of the &quot;Quirītes&quot; or Roman citizens&#x27; (&quot;quiritare dicitur is qui Quiritum fidem clamans implorat&quot;).

<text>The 2005 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 2005 season. The 101st edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Chicago White Sox and the National League (NL) champion Houston Astros. The White Sox swept the Astros in four games, winning their third World Series championship and their first in 88 years. The series was played between October 22–26, 2005.

Home field advantage was awarded to Chicago by virtue of the AL&#x27;s 7–5 victory over the NL in the 2005 MLB All-Star Game. The Astros were attempting to become the fourth consecutive wild card team to win the Series, following the Anaheim Angels (2002), Florida Marlins (2003) and Boston Red Sox (2004). Both teams were attempting to overcome decades of disappointment, with a combined 132 years between the two teams without a title. The Astros were making their first Series appearance in 44 years of play, while the White Sox had waited exactly twice as long for a title, having last won the Series in 1917, and had not been in the Series since 1959, three years before the Astros&#x27; inaugural season. As of 2024, this is the most recent postseason series won by the White Sox.

The Houston Astros have since changed conferences in 2013. This means this matchup cannot repeat unless one of these two teams changes conferences to the National League. As MLB&#x27;s 30 teams are equally divided among baseball&#x27;s six divisions, this is unlikely for the foreseeable future.

==Background==
===Chicago White Sox===

The Chicago White Sox finished the regular season with the best record in the American League at 99–63. The 2005 White Sox led their division wire to wire and only lost one game in the postseason. After starting the season on a tear, the White Sox began to fade in August, when a game lead (for the AL Central division title) fell all the way to at one point. However, the White Sox were able to hold off the Cleveland Indians to win the American League Central Division by six games, sweeping the Indians in three games on the season&#x27;s final weekend. In the American League Division Series, the top-seeded White Sox swept the defending champion Boston Red Sox. The American League Championship Series began with the second-seeded Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim winning Game 1, but a controversial uncaught third strike in Game 2 helped the White Sox start a run and win Games 2–5, all on complete games pitched by starters Mark Buehrle, Jon Garland, Freddy García, and José Contreras, clinching their first American League pennant since 1959. In game 3 of the ALDS Orlando Hernandez came in with the bases loaded due to Damaso Marte loading the bases with a single and back to back walks. El Duque came in and induced 2 pop outs and a strike out to end the inning and preserve the lead.
Manager Ozzie Guillén then led the White Sox to a World Series victory, their first in 88 years. Slugger Frank Thomas was not on the post-season roster because he was injured, but the team honored his perennial contributions to the franchise during Game 1 of the Division Series against the Red Sox when he was chosen to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. &quot;What a feeling,&quot; Thomas said. &quot;Standing all around the place. People really cheering me. I had tears in my eyes. To really know the fans cared that much about me – it was a great feeling. One of my proudest moments in the game.&quot; 

The White Sox completed the 2005 postseason with an 11-1 record. The White Sox also won the last 5 regular season games and thus closed out the 2005 campaign winning 16 of the last 17 games played, a record finish unmatched in all of MLB history.

===Houston Astros===

The Houston Astros won the Wild Card for the second straight year, once again clinching it on the final day of the season. The Astros embarked on a memorable National League Division Series rematch against the Atlanta Braves, who were the second seed in the National League. With the Astros in the lead two games to one, the teams played an 18-inning marathon in Game 4, which was the longest (in both time and innings played) postseason game in history. In this game, Roger Clemens made only the second relief appearance of his career, and the first in postseason play. Chris Burke&#x27;s walk-off home run ended the game in the bottom of the 18th. For the second straight year, the Astros played the top-seeded St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series. Like the White Sox, the Astros dropped Game 1, but were able to regroup and win Games 2–4. With the Astros on the verge of clinching their first ever National League pennant in Game 5, Albert Pujols hit a mammoth three-run home run off Brad Lidge in the top of the ninth inning to take the lead, and subsequently stave off elimination. However, behind NLCS MVP Roy Oswalt, the Astros were able to defeat the Cardinals 5–1 in Game 6 and earned a trip to the World Series. With the win, this was the Astros&#x27; first World Series appearance in franchise history, and the last game played in Busch Stadium II, as it was demolished months after the game and the Cardinals moved to Busch Stadium III the next season.

==Summary==

==Matchups==
===Game 1===
Playing in their first World Series home game since 1959, the White Sox took an early lead with a home run from Jermaine Dye in the first inning. After Mike Lamb&#x27;s home run tied the game in the second, the Sox scored two more in the second when Juan Uribe doubled in A. J. Pierzynski after Carl Everett had already scored on a groundout earlier in the inning. The Astros responded in the next inning when Lance Berkman hit a double, driving in Adam Everett and Craig Biggio. In the White Sox half of the fourth, Joe Crede hit what turned out to be the game-winning home run. In the bottom of the eighth, Scott Podsednik hit a triple with Pierzynski on second off of Russ Springer for an insurance run. Roger Clemens recorded his shortest World Series start, leaving after the second inning with 53 pitches, including 35 for strikes, due to a sore hamstring that he had previously injured (which had caused him to also miss his last regular season start) as the loss went to Wandy Rodríguez. José Contreras pitched seven innings, allowing three runs on six hits for the win. Before exiting, Contreras allowed a leadoff double by Willie Taveras with no outs. Neal Cotts entered the game in the top of the eighth inning. It marked the first time in five games that the White Sox had gone to their bullpen. Cotts pitched innings before Bobby Jenks was called upon by manager Ozzie Guillén to relieve him. Guillen signaled for the large pitcher by holding his arms out wide and then up high. In the postgame conference, the Sox manager joked that he wanted to be clear he was asking for &quot;The Big Boy.&quot; Jenks returned in the ninth to earn the save, giving the White Sox a 1–0 lead in the series.
===Game 2===

On a cold () and rainy evening, Morgan Ensberg&#x27;s first-pitch home run off starter Mark Buehrle put the Astros on top in the second inning. The White Sox answered in the bottom of the second with two runs off Andy Pettitte on Joe Crede&#x27;s RBI single with two on and Juan Uribe&#x27;s sacrifice fly, the only runs Pettitte allowed in six solid innings. Houston&#x27;s Lance Berkman tied the game on a sacrifice fly in the third after a one-out triple by Willy Taveras, then hit a two-run double in the fifth to give the Astros a 4–2 lead. In the seventh, Dan Wheeler loaded the bases with a double by Juan Uribe, a walk to Tadahito Iguchi, and plate umpire Jeff Nelson&#x27;s ruling that Jermaine Dye was hit by a pitched ball. The Astros brought in Chad Qualls, who promptly served up a grand slam to Paul Konerko on his first pitch, the 18th grand slam in the annals of the Fall Classic. In the top of the ninth, Sox closer Bobby Jenks blew the save on a game-tying pinch-hit two-run single by José Vizcaíno. In the bottom of the ninth, Astros closer Brad Lidge gave up a one-out, walk-off home run—the 14th in Series history—to Scott Podsednik, giving Lidge his second loss in as many post-season appearances (his previous appearance was in Game 5 of 2005 National League Championship Series). Podsednik had not hit a single homer in the regular season, but this was his second of the post-season. This was the second time in World Series history where a grand slam and a walk-off home run were hit in the same game. The Oakland A&#x27;s Jose Canseco (grand slam) and the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; Kirk Gibson (walk-off) in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series were the first to do it. Never before had a World Series grand slam and a World Series walk-off home run been hit by the same team in the same game. Until the grand slam by Adam Duvall of the Atlanta Braves in 2021 World Series, the grand slam by Konerko was the last World Series grand slam hit by the home team.
===Game 3===

Game 3 was the first World Series game played in the state of Texas. Before the game, it was ruled by Commissioner Bud Selig that the retractable roof would be open at Minute Maid Park, weather permitting. The Astros objected, citing that their record in games with the roof closed was better than with the retractable roof open. Selig&#x27;s office claimed that the ruling was based on the rules established by Houston and were consistent with how the Astros organization treated the situation all year long, as well as the weather forecasts for that period of time.

The game would become the longest World Series game in length of time (5 hours and 41 minutes) and tied for the longest in number of innings (14, tied with Game 2 of the 1916 World Series and Game 1 of the 2015 World Series) until it was surpassed by Game 3 of the 2018 World Series. Houston struck early on a Lance Berkman single after a Craig Biggio lead-off double in the bottom of the first off Chicago starter Jon Garland. A White Sox rally was snuffed in the second inning; after Paul Konerko hit a leadoff double and A. J. Pierzynski walked, Aaron Rowand lined out into a double play. Houston scored in the third; Adam Everett walked, was caught in a rundown and got hit by the ball on a Juan Uribe throwing error, then scored on a Roy Oswalt sacrifice bunt and a Biggio single. Two batters later, Morgan Ensberg singled Biggio home. Jason Lane led off the Astros&#x27; fourth with a home run to left-center field. It was later shown in replays that the ball should not have been ruled a home run, hitting to the left of the yellow line on the unusual wall in left-center field.

After Houston starter Roy Oswalt had thrown four shutout innings, the White Sox rallied for five runs in the top of the fifth, true to their &quot;Win Or Die Trying&quot; mantra of 2005, starting with a Joe Crede lead-off homer. Uribe, on first after hitting a single, scored on a Tadahito Iguchi base hit with one out, followed by Scott Podsednik coming home on a single by Jermaine Dye. Pierzynski hit a two-out double to Tal&#x27;s Hill, driving in two runs, scoring Iguchi and Dye giving the Sox the lead. The Astros rallied in the last of the eighth when the Sox bullpen collapsed. Cliff Politte got two outs, but walked Ensberg and was replaced by Neal Cotts, who promptly walked Mike Lamb to put two on and forced the Sox to put their regular-season closer Dustin Hermanson in place of Cotts. However, Hermanson could not hold down the save when Lane doubled to score Ensberg, but did not allow many more runs by striking out Brad Ausmus. Houston tried to rally to win in the ninth against Orlando Hernandez, but stranded Chris Burke at third, after he had walked, reached second on an error and stolen third.

The Astros tried again in the 10th as well as in the 11th, but failed each time. In the top of the 14th, after the Sox hit into a spectacular double play started by Ensberg, Geoff Blum (a former Astro and the Astros&#x27; television color analyst as of 2015), who had entered the game in the 13th, homered to right with two outs off Ezequiel Astacio. Infield singles by Rowand and Crede were followed by walks to Uribe and Chris Widger. Astacio was replaced by Game 1 loser Wandy Rodriguez, who got the final out with the bases loaded. Trailing 7–5, Houston tried to rally with the tying runs on first and third and two outs after a Uribe error. Game 2 starter Mark Buehrle earned the save for winning pitcher Dámaso Marte when Everett popped out, bringing Chicago one game closer to its first championship in 88 years. Buehrle became the first pitcher to start a game in the Series and save the next one since Bob Turley of the Yankees in the 1958 World Series.

Many records were set or tied besides time and innings: The teams combined to use 17 pitchers (nine for the White Sox, eight for the Astros), throwing a total of 482 pitches, and walking 21 batters (a dozen by Chicago, nine by Houston); 43 players were used (the White Sox used 22 and the Astros used 21), and 30 men were left on base (15 for each team), all new high-water marks in Fall Classic history. Scott Podsednik set a new all-time record with eight official at-bats in this game. One tied record was total double plays, with six (four by the Astros, two by the White Sox).
===Game 4===

Before the game, Major League Baseball unveiled its Latino Legends Team presented by Chevrolet.

The fourth game was the pitchers&#x27; duel that had been promised throughout the series. Both Houston starter Brandon Backe and Chicago starter Freddy García put zeros on the scoreboard through seven innings, the longest Series scoreless stretch since Game 7 of the 1991 World Series. Scott Podsednik had a two-out triple in the top of the third, but a Tadahito Iguchi groundout ended that threat. The Astros wasted a chance in the sixth, Jason Lane striking out with the bases loaded. The White Sox in the top of the seventh put runners at second and third, but Backe struck out shortstop Juan Uribe. Chicago broke through in the next inning against embattled Houston closer Brad Lidge, who relieved Backe. Willie Harris hit a pinch-hit single. Podsednik advanced him with a sacrifice bunt. Carl Everett pinch-hit for Iguchi and grounded out to the right side to allow Harris to move to third. Jermaine Dye, the Most Valuable Player of the series, had the game-winning single, driving in Harris.

Things got a little sticky for the Sox in the Astros half of the eighth when reliever Cliff Politte hit Willy Taveras, threw a wild pitch, sending Taveras to second, and walked Lance Berkman. After Morgan Ensberg flew out to center, the White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén brought in Neal Cotts to finish the inning. Cotts induced pinch-hitter José Vizcaíno into a ground out to Uribe. Bobby Jenks, the 24-year-old fireballer, started the ninth inning. He allowed a single to Jason Lane and a sacrifice bunt to Brad Ausmus. Chris Burke came in to pinch-hit; he fouled one off to the left side, but Uribe made an amazing catch in the stands to retire Burke.

The game ended when pinch-hitter Orlando Palmeiro grounded to Uribe to strand Lane. It was a bang-bang play as Paul Konerko caught the ball from Uribe at 11:01 pm CDT to begin the biggest celebration in Chicago since the sixth NBA championship by the Bulls, co-owned with the White Sox, in . As a result, Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of both teams, had won seven championships overall.

This game would be the last postseason game for the Astros as a member of the NL, as they would move to the AL in 2013, and not appear in a postseason game until the 2015 American League Wild Card Game. They also became the only team in the MLB to win both the National and American League pennant after they defeated the New York Yankees in the 2017 ALCS.

The last two Series games technically ended on the same day, Game 3 having concluded after midnight, Houston time.

The 1–0 shutout was the first game with a total of one run scored to end a World Series since the 1995 World Series, in which Game 6 was won by the Atlanta Braves over the Cleveland Indians, and the first 1–0 game in any Series game since Game 5 of the 1996 World Series when the New York Yankees shut-out the Braves in the last game ever played at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium.

The 2005 White Sox joined the 1995 Atlanta Braves and 1999 New York Yankees as the only teams to win a World Series after losing no more than one game combined in the Division Series and Championship Series. They became the 3rd team in history to lead their division the entire year and sweep the opposition in the world series. Joining the 1927 New York Yankees and the 1990 Cincinnati Reds. 

This was the second consecutive World Series to be won by a team that has the word &quot;Sox&quot; in its nickname, after the Boston Red Sox won the 2004 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. This also happened in 1917 and 1918. Furthermore, it was the second year in a row in which the Series champions broke a long-lived &quot;curse.&quot; In one of those ways that patterns appear to emerge in sporting events, the White Sox World Series win in 2005, along with the Boston Red Sox win in 2004, symmetrically bookended the two teams&#x27; previous World Series winners and the long gaps between, with the Red Sox and White Sox last Series wins having come in 1918 and 1917, respectively.

==Composite line score==

2005 World Series (4–0): Chicago White Sox (A.L.) over Houston Astros (N.L.)

The winning margin of six runs tied for the lowest for a four-game sweep; the only other time was in 1950.

==Media==

As per their contract, Fox Sports carried the World Series on United States television. Joe Buck provided play-by-play for his eighth World Series while analyst Tim McCarver worked his sixteenth.

ESPN Radio was the nationwide radio broadcaster, as it had been since 1998. Jon Miller and Joe Morgan provided the play-by-play and analysis. Stirring major controversy, ESPN has, on at least two occasions, publicly failed to acknowledge the White Sox as the 2005 World Series champions.

Locally, KTRH-AM and WMVP were the primary carriers for the World Series in the Houston and Chicago markets. For KTRH long time Astros voice Milo Hamilton provided play-by-play while John Rooney called the games for the White Sox. Game 4 was Rooney&#x27;s last call after 17 years as the radio voice of the White Sox, as he left to take the same position with the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals proceeded to win the 2006 World Series, making Rooney the first home announcer to call back-to-back World Series wins for two teams. That the teams were in two leagues makes the feat even more unusual.

==Ratings==
The ratings for the 2005 World Series were considered weak.

With an overall average of 11.1, 2005 set a record for the lowest rated World Series of all-time. The prior lowest was 11.9, set by the 2002 World Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Anaheim Angels (importantly, this series went 7 games, and the 2005 Series went 4).

Following the 2005 World Series, however, every subsequent Series through 2013 except for 2009 produced lower ratings. The record-low 2012 World Series, another four-game sweep, averaged 7.6 (3.5 points lower than 2005&#x27;s rating) and 12.7 million viewers (4.4 million fewer viewers than 2005).


==Aftermath==
Neither team advanced to the postseason in 2006, but both the White Sox and the Astros were in the Wild Card race until the final weeks of the season, with the White Sox finishing with 90 wins, the Astros with 82 wins. The White Sox made their first post-2005 postseason appearance in 2008, while the Astros would not return to the postseason until 2015, their third season as an American League team and would not return to the World Series until 2017, their fifth season as an American League team. Both teams would meet again in the 2021 American League Division Series, their first match-up in the post-season since the 2005 World Series (and the first since the Astros moved to the AL). Houston won the series 3–1.
This was the city of Chicago&#x27;s first professional sports championship since the Chicago Fire won MLS Cup &#x27;98 (which came four months after the Chicago Bulls&#x27; sixth NBA championship that year). The next major Chicago sports championship came in 2010, when the NHL&#x27;s Chicago Blackhawks ended a 49-year Stanley Cup title drought. With the Chicago Bears&#x27; win in Super Bowl XX and the Chicago Cubs&#x27; own World Series championship in , all Chicago sports teams have won at least one major championship since 1985. However, the White Sox would only make three postseason appearances since their 2005 championship (2008, 2020, 2021), and in 2024, the team set a new mark of baseball futility by losing an MLB-record 121 games.

Astros&#x27; manager Phil Garner admitted in January 2010 on a Houston radio station that he used a corked bat against Gaylord Perry and &quot;hit a home run&quot; with it. Garner also admitted that the 2005 Houston Astros used corked bats during the 2005 MLB season and 2005 World Series of which he was the manager.

Meanwhile, the Astros themselves made it back to the World Series in , but this time as an AL team, where they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games, resulting in Houston&#x27;s first professional sports championship since the 2006–07 Houston Dynamo won their back-to-back MLS Championships. However, Houston&#x27;s 2017 World Series victory became controversial due to the sign stealing scandal that was made public in 2019. The Astros would eventually redeem themselves by winning the 2022 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.

Closer Brad Lidge and utility player Eric Bruntlett went on to play on the Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; 2008 World Series-winning team, while outfielder/first baseman Lance Berkman won a World Series in with the St. Louis Cardinals. Aaron Rowand and Juan Uribe both won a second World Series title together as members of the San Francisco Giants.

<text>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose refused Gandhi&#x27;s way of seeking independence and broke away from Indian National Congress and formed his own party and became the first leader of All India Forward Bloc. In 1943 Netaji ask help from the Empire of Japan to fought against the British Armed Forces to free India from British rule in India.He created a his own Country name Azad Hind (free India) whose ideology was Fascism and semi Socialist with a Provisional government under Japanese rule. He wanted the entire British Raj under his government&#x27;s control. Azad Hind Fauj also participated in wars like Burma campaign and Arakan campaign (1942–1943) which resulted in Azad Hind and Empire of Japan victory.

The end of this short live country was unknown and the British never came to re-occupied this area. So, many people say that this country collapse after 18th August 1945 (death of Subhas Chandra Bose) while others say that it succeed in India in 15th August 1947 (Indian Independence)

The Provisional Government of Free India or, more simply, Azad Hind, was a short-lived Japanese-supported provisional government in India. It was established in Japanese occupied Singapore during World War II in October 1943 and has been considered a puppet state of the Empire of Japan.

It was a part of the political movement originating in the 1940s outside India with the purpose of allying with the Axis powers to liberate India from British rule. It was established by Indian nationalists in exile during the latter part of the World War II in Singapore with monetary, military and political assistance from Imperial Japan.

Founded on 21 October 1943, the government was inspired by the concepts of Subhas Chandra Bose who was also the leader of the government and Head of state. The government proclaimed authority over Indian civilian and military personnel in Southeast Asian British colonial territory and prospective authority over Indian territory to fall to the Japanese forces and the Indian National Army during the Japanese thrust towards India. The government of Azad Hind had its own currency, court and civil code, and in the eyes of some Indians, its existence gave a greater importance to the independence struggle against the British. Japan also handed over nominal authority of the Japanese occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 1943, though the government continued to be dependent on Japanese support. Immediately after the formation of the provisional government, Free India declared war against the Allied forces on the Indo-Burma Front. Its army, the Indian National Army (&quot;Azad Hind Fauj&quot;), went into action against the British Indian Army and the allied forces as part of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Imphal-Kohima sector. The INA had its first major engagement at the Battle of Imphal where, under the command of the Japanese Fifteenth Army, it breached the British defences in Kohima, reaching the salient of Moirang before suffering a catastrophic defeat as the Allied forces held, and Allied air dominance and compromised supply lines forced both the Japanese and the INA to retreat. The existence of Azad Hind was essentially coterminous with the existence of the Indian National Army. While the government itself continued until the civil administration of the Andaman Islands was returned to the jurisdiction of the British towards the end of the war, the limited power of Azad Hind was effectively ended with the surrender of the last major contingent of INA troops in Rangoon. The death of Bose is seen as the end of the entire Azad Hind Movement.

The legacy of Azad Hind is, however, open to judgment. After the war, the Raj observed with alarm the transformation of the perception of Azad Hind from traitors and collaborators to liberators. The British Empire, which was seriously threatened by the INA, charged 300 INA officers with treason in the INA trials, but eventually backtracked in the face of opposition by the Congress.

==Establishment==
The direct origins of Azad Hind can be linked to two conferences of Indian expatriates from across Southeast Asia, the first of which was held in Tokyo in March 1942. At this conference, convened by Rash Behari Bose, an Indian expatriate living in Japan, the Indian Independence League was established as the first move towards an independent Indian state politically aligned with the Empire of Japan. Rash also moved to create a sort of independence army that would assist in driving the British from India – this force would later become the Indian National Army. The second conference, held later that year in Bangkok, invited Subhas Chandra Bose to participate in the leadership of the League. Bose was living in Germany at the time and made the trip to Japan via submarine.

Rash Behari Bose, who was already ageing by the time the League was founded, struggled to keep the League organised and failed to secure resources for the establishment of the Indian National Army. He was replaced as president of the Indian Independence League by Subhas Chandra Bose; there is some controversy as to whether he stepped down of his own volition or by pressure from the Japanese who needed a more energetic and focused presence leading the Indian nationalists.

Bose arrived in Tokyo on 13 June 1943 and declared his intent to make an assault against the eastern provinces of India in an attempt to oust the British from control of the subcontinent. Bose arrived in Singapore on 2 July, and in October 1943 formally announced the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India at the Cathay Cinema Hall. In defining the tasks of this new political establishment, Subhas declared: &quot;It will be the task of the Provisional Government to launch and conduct the struggle that will bring about the expulsion of the British and their allies from the soil of India.&quot; Bose, taking formal command of the demoralised and undermanned Indian National Army from Rash Bose, turned it into a professional army with the help of the Japanese. He recruited Indian civilians living in Japanese-occupied territories of South-east Asia and incorporated vast numbers of Indian POWs from British forces in Singapore, Malaya and Hong Kong to man the brigades of the INA.

==Ministers==
The Provisional Government of Free India consisted of a Cabinet headed by Subhas Chandra Bose as the Head of the State, The Prime Minister and the Minister for War and Foreign Affairs.

Captain Dr. Lakshmi Swaminadhan (later married as Lakshmi Sahgal) was the Minister in Charge of Women&#x27;s Organization. She held this position over and above her command of the Rani Jhansi Regiment, a brigade of women soldiers fighting for the Indian National Army. For a regular Asian army, this women&#x27;s regiment was quite visionary; it was the first of its kind established on the continent. Lakshmi was one of the most popular and prosperous gynaecologists in Singapore before she gave up her practice to lead the troops of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment.

Other public administration ministers of the Provisional Government of Free India included:
*Lakshmi Swaminadhan – The Minister in Charge of Women&#x27;s Organization
*S. A. Ayer – The Minister of Broadcasting and Publicity
*Lt. Col. A. C. Chatterji – The Minister of Finance

The Indian National Army was represented by Armed Forces ministers, including:
*Lt. Col. Aziz Ahmed
*Lt. Col. N. S. Bhagat
*Lt. Col. J. K. Bhonsle
*Lt. Col. Guizara Singh
*Lt. Col. M.Z. Kiani
*Lt. Col. A. D. Loganathan
*Lt. Col. Ehsan Qadir
*Lt. Col. Shahnawaz Khan

The Provisional Government was also constituted and administered by a number of Secretaries and Advisors to Subhas Chandra Bose, including:
*Capt. Dilip Singh Siwach
*A. M. Sahay – Secretary
*Karim Ghani
*Debnath Das
*D. M. Khan
*A. Yellapa
*J. Thivy
*Sardar Ishar Singh Narula
*A. N. Sarkar – the government&#x27;s official Legal Advisor

All of these Secretaries and Advisory officials held Ministerial rank in the Provisional Government. The extent of the Provisional Government&#x27;s day-to-day management of affairs for Azad Hind is not entirely well-documented, so their specific functions as government officials for the state outside their positions as support ministers for Subhas Chandra Bose is not entirely certain.

==Recognition==

Azad Hind was recognised as a legitimate state by only a small number of countries limited solely to Axis powers and their allies. Azad Hind had diplomatic relations with nine countries: Nazi Germany, the Empire of Japan, Italian Social Republic, Independent State of Croatia and Wang Jingwei Government, Thailand, the State of Burma, Manchukuo and the Second Philippine Republic. On the declaration of its formation in occupied Singapore the Taoiseach of Ireland, Éamon de Valera, sent a note of congratulations to Bose. Vichy France, however, although being an Axis collaborator, never gave formal political recognition to Azad Hind. This government participated as an observer in the Greater East Asia Conference in November 1943.

==Government administration and World War II==

The same night that Bose declared the existence of Azad Hind, the government took action to declare war against the United States and Britain. The government consisted of a Cabinet ministry acting as an advisory board to Subhas Bose, who was given the title &quot;Netaji&quot; (translating roughly to &quot;leader&quot;) and was no doubt the dominant figure in the Provisional Government. He exercised virtual authoritarian control over the government and the army. With regards to the government&#x27;s first issuances of war declarations, the &quot;Cabinet had not been unanimous about the inclusion of the U.S.A. Bose had shown impatience and displeasure – there was never any question then or later of his absolute authority: the Cabinet had no responsibility and could only tender advice...&quot;
At the end of October 1943, Bose flew to Tokyo to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference as an observer to Japan&#x27;s Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere; it could not function as a delegate because India had technically fallen outside the jurisdiction of Japan&#x27;s definition of &quot;Greater East Asia&quot;, but Bose gave speeches in opposition to Western colonialism and imperialism at the conference. By the end of the conference, Azad Hind had been given a limited form of governmental jurisdiction over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which had been captured by the Imperial Japanese Navy early on in the war.
Once under the jurisdiction of Azad Hind, the islands formed the government&#x27;s first claims to territory. The islands themselves were renamed &quot;Shaheed&quot; and &quot;Swaraj&quot;, meaning &quot;martyr&quot; and &quot;self-rule&quot; respectively. Bose placed the islands under the governorship of Lt Col A. D Loganathan, and had limited involvement with the official governorship of the territory, instead involving himself in plans to expand the Indian National Army, ensure adequate men and materiel, and formulate its course of actions and the administrations and relations of the Indian population in southeast Asia and determining Japanese designs in India and his provisional government. In theory, the government itself had the power to levy taxes on the local populace, and to make and enforce laws: in practice, they were enforced by the police force under Japanese control. Indians were willing to pay these taxes at first but became less inclined to do so towards the end of the war when the Provisional Government enacted legislation for higher war-time taxes to fund the INA. During his interrogation after the war, Loganathan admitted that he had only had full control over the islands&#x27; vestigial education department, as the Japanese had retained full control over the police force, and in protest, he had refused to accept responsibility for any other areas of Government. He was powerless to prevent the Homfreyganj massacre of 30 January 1944, where forty-four Indian civilians were shot by the Japanese on suspicion of spying. Many of them were members of the Indian Independence League, whose leader in Port Blair, Diwan Singh, had already been tortured to death in the Cellular Jail after doing his best to protect the islanders from Japanese atrocities during the first two years of the occupation.

Azad Hind&#x27;s military forces in the form of the INA saw some successes against the British and moved with the Japanese army to lay siege to the town of Imphal in eastern India. Plans to march towards Delhi, gaining support and fresh recruits along the way, stalled both with the onset of monsoon season and the failure to capture Imphal. British bombing seriously reduced morale, and the Japanese along with the INA forces began their withdrawal from India.

In addition to these setbacks, the INA was faced with a formidable challenge when the troops were left to defend Rangoon without the assistance of the Japanese in the winter of 1944–1945. Loganathan was relocated from the Andaman Islands to act as field commander. With the INA garrison about 6,000 strong, he manned the Burmese capital in the absence of any other police force or troops during the period between the departure of the Japanese and the arrival of the British. He was successful in maintaining law and order to the extent that there was not a single reported case of dacoity or of looting during the period from 24 April to 4 May 1945.

==Indian areas under the administration of the Provisional Government==
Almost all of the territory of the Provisional Government lay in the Andaman Islands, although the Provisional Government was allowed some authority over Indian enclaves in Japanese-occupied territories. Provisional Government civil authority was never enacted in areas occupied by the INA; instead, Japanese military authority prevailed and responsibility for administration of occupied areas of India was shared between the Japanese and the Indian forces.

==INA defeat and Provisional Government collapse==
Left to defend Rangoon from the British advance without support from the Japanese, the INA was soundly defeated. Bose was suggested to leave Burma to continue his struggle for Indian independence and returned to Singapore before the fall of Rangoon; the government Azad Hind had established on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands collapsed when the island garrisons of Japanese and Indian troops were defeated by British troops and the islands themselves retaken. Allegedly Bose himself was killed in a plane crash departing from Taiwan attempting to escape to the Soviet Union. The Provisional Government of Free India ceased to exist with the deaths of the Axis, the INA, and the disappearance of Bose in 1945.
The troops who manned the brigades of the Indian National Army were taken as prisoners of war by the British. A number of these prisoners were brought to India and tried by British courts for treason, including a number of high-ranking officers such as Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon. The defence of these individuals from prosecution by the British became a central point of contention between the British Raj and the Indian Independence Movement in the post-war years.

==Relations with the Axis Powers==
Since Subhas Chandra Bose aligned with Empire of Japan and the Axis Powers, which also included Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, Britain portrayed him as a controversial figure for his official stance against imperialism which would run in opposition against Japanese imperialism in Asia during World War II. Bose himself claimed to oppose all manner of colonial practices but claimed Britain as hypocritical in &quot;fighting a war for democracy&quot; while refusing to extend the same respect for democracy and equal rights to their colonial subjects in India. Bose opposed British racial policy and declared working for the abolition of racial discrimination with Burmese, Japanese and other Asians.

Britain accused Bose of fascism, citing his role in the Provisional Government of Azad Hind as evidence of this; and pointed to him wanting to establish a totalitarian state in India with the blessings of the Axis powers. Bose believed that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for India immediately after independence and that a centrally organised, self-sufficient, semi-socialist India under the firm control of a single party was the best course for Indian government. Some of his ideas would help shape Indian governmental policy in the aftermath of the country&#x27;s independence from Britain.

It has been argued that the fact that Azad Hind was aligned politically with Japan and the Axis Powers may have had more to do with what Bose saw as a pragmatic approach to Indian independence. Disillusioned with Congress&#x27;s non-violent movement, Bose was clearly of the camp that supported exploiting British weakness to gain Indian independence. Throughout the existence of Azad Hind, Bose sought to distance himself from Japanese collaboration and become more self-sufficient but found this difficult since the existence of Azad Hind as a governmental entity had only come about with the support of the Japanese, on whom the government and army of Azad Hind were entirely dependent. Bose, however, is considered a hero by some in present-day India and is remembered as a man who fought fiercely for Indian independence. However, Subhas Chandra Bose had supported Fascism and Nazism before the start of WWII, declaring that India needed &quot;a synthesis of what modern Europe calls socialism and fascism&quot; in a speech in made in Calcutta in 1930.

Although Japanese troops saw much of the combat in India against the British, the INA was certainly by itself an effective combat force, having faced British and allied troops and making their mark in the Battle of Imphal. On 18 April 1944 the suicide squad led by Col. Shaukat Malik broke through the British defence and captured Moirang in Manipur. The Azad Hind administration took control of this independent Indian territory. Following Moirang, the advancing INA breached the Kohima road, posing a threat to the British positions in both Silchar and Kohima. Col. Gulzara Singh&#x27;s column had penetrated 250 miles into India. The Azad Brigade advanced, by outflanking the Anglo-American positions.

However, INA&#x27;s most serious, and ultimately fatal, limitations were the reliance on Japanese logistics and supplies and the total air-dominance of the allies, which, along with a supply line deluged by torrential rain, frustrated the INA&#x27;s and the Japanese bid to take Imphal.

With the siege of Imphal failing, the Japanese began to shift priority for resource allocation from South Asia to the Pacific, where they were fighting United States troops advancing from island to island against Japanese holdings there. When it had become clear that Bose&#x27;s plans to advance to Delhi from the borders of Burma would never materialise due to the defeat of the INA at Imphal and the halt of Japanese armies by British aerial and later naval superiority in the region, Japanese support for Azad Hind declined, and then fully collapsed with the surrender of Japan to the Americans on 2 September 1945.

<text>Gregg Alan Rolie (born June 17, 1947) is an American keyboardist, singer and songwriter. Rolie served as lead singer of the bands Santana and Journey – both of which he co-founded. He also helmed rock group the Storm, performed in Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band until 2021, and since 2001 with his Gregg Rolie Band. Rolie is a two-time inductee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, having been inducted both as a member of Santana in 1998 and as a member of Journey in 2017.

==Career==
Rolie was born in Seattle, Washington, United States. Prior to Santana, he played with a group called William Penn and His Pals while attending Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, California 1965, his senior year.

In 1966, Rolie joined Carlos Santana and others to form the Santana Blues Band, which was later shortened simply to Santana. As a co-founding member of Santana, Rolie was part of the band&#x27;s first wave of success, including an appearance at the Woodstock Music and Art Festival in 1969 and central roles in several hit albums. He was their original lead vocalist, with his voice appearing on well-known Santana songs such as &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; (US #4), &quot;Oye Como Va&quot;, &quot;No One To Depend On&quot; and &quot;Evil Ways&quot;. He also became well known for his skill on the Hammond B3 organ, with solos on many of the aforementioned hits. He has song-writing credits on many tracks from this period. However, persistent differences with Carlos Santana regarding the musical direction of the band led Rolie to leave in 1972.

In 1973 Rolie joined a new band with ex-Santana guitarist Neal Schon. This became Journey. Starring in a lineup that featured Schon, Aynsley Dunbar, George Tickner, and Ross Valory, he was keyboardist for the band&#x27;s first six albums. On &quot;Journey&quot; and &quot;Look into the Future&quot;, he was lead vocalist, and on &quot;Next&quot; he shared those duties with guitarist Neal Schon. After Steve Perry joined the band in 1977, Rolie sang co-lead vocals on several songs on the albums &quot;Infinity&quot;, &quot;Evolution&quot;, and &quot;Departure&quot;. He started to feel burned out by the non-stop schedule of touring, plus felt his creativity was drained, and soon announced he was leaving the band. Since his departure was amicable, he hand picked his successor, Jonathan Cain.

After leaving Journey in 1980, Rolie released several solo albums, including the eponymous &quot;Gregg Rolie&quot; in 1985. This album featured the song &quot;I Wanna Go Back&quot;, which later became a hit for Eddie Money, and included contributions from Carlos Santana, Peter Wolf, Neal Schon, and Craig Chaquico. A second solo effort, &quot;Gringo&quot;, was released in 1987.

Rolie formed the Storm in 1991 with Steve Smith and Ross Valory of Journey. The band also included singer Kevin Chalfant and guitarist Josh Ramos. Prior to their inaugural tour in support of their first album, Steve Smith left the band and was replaced by Ron Wikso. 

Similar to his work with Santana and Journey, Rolie played keyboards and was a co-lead vocalist on several tracks of the band&#x27;s first, eponymous, album, which spent 17 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart peaking at #133 and spawned the hit singles &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Lot to Learn About Love,&quot; and &quot;Show Me the Way.&quot; Despite this success, Interscope Records shelved the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Eye Of The Storm,&quot; which was recorded in 1993. It was finally released in 1996 in Europe on the Music For Nations label, in 1997 in Japan on the Avex Trax/Bateknuckle label, and in 1998 in the United States on the Miramar label. 

In 1998, Rolie and other former members of Santana, including Neal Schon, briefly reunited as Abraxas Pool, releasing one album.

When Schon left to lead a re-formed Journey later that year, Rolie and Ron Wikso began work in 1999 on a Gregg Rolie solo CD titled &quot;Roots&quot;, which eventually led to the forming of the Gregg Rolie Band. Besides Rolie and Wikso, &quot;Roots&quot; featured appearances by Neal Schon, Alphonso Johnson, Dave Amato, Adrian Areas and Michael Carabello. The Gregg Rolie Band saw Kurt Griffey taking over guitar duties and the addition of Wally Minko as a second keyboardist. They recorded a live CD at Sturgis called &quot;Rain Dance&quot;, which was released in 2009.

In 2010, Rolie released &quot;Five Days&quot; and subsequently formed a duo with Alan Haynes, which eventually led to the formation of the Gregg Rolie Quartet, with the addition of long time collaborator/drummer, Ron Wikso and bassist Evan &quot;Sticky&quot; Lopez.

From 2012 to 2021 he toured as a member of Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band performing Santana hits &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot;, &quot;Evil Ways&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Everything&quot;. The band also included Toto guitarist Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Richard Page, Mark Rivera and Gregg Bissonette.

On February 2, 2013 Carlos Santana confirmed that he would reunite his classic lineup, most of whom played Woodstock with him in 1969. Santana said of Rolie, &quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure Gregg&#x27;s going to do it.&quot; Speaking in 2012 of such a reunion, Rolie told Radio.com &quot;it&#x27;s just a matter of putting it together and going and doing it. I would do it. I think it&#x27;s a great idea. People would love it. It could be great!&quot; In 2016, as part of Santana&#x27;s original line-up they released their fourth album, titled &quot;Santana IV&quot;.

On February 9, 2018, Rolie reunited with Schon for a charity show at San Francisco&#x27;s The Independent, benefiting North Bay Fire Relief. The group also featured former Journey drummer Deen Castronovo (who also sang some of the vocals) and bassist Marco Mendoza of The Dead Daisies. In 2019 Rolie reunited with Schon, Castronovo and Mendoza for four more concert dates.

==Philanthropy==
Rolie is a proponent of music education for children. In 2005, he signed on as an official supporter of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and instruction to children in underserved public schools throughout the US. He sits on the organization&#x27;s Honorary board of directors.

==Personal life==
Rolie and his wife, Lori, reside near Austin, Texas.

<text>Wilhelm Raabe (; September 8, 1831November 15, 1910) was a German novelist. His early works were published under the pseudonym of Jakob Corvinus.

==Biography==
He was born in Eschershausen (then in the Duchy of Brunswick, now in the Holzminden District). After attending gymnasia in Holzminden and Wolfenbüttel, he entered a bookstore in Magdeburg as apprentice in 1849. He used this opportunity for wide reading and enriched himself with the tales and folklore of his own and other countries. He remained an apprentice until 1854.

Tiring of the routine of business, he then studied philosophy at Berlin (1855–1857). While a student at that university, under his pseudonym he published his first work, &quot;The Chronicle of Sparrow Lane (1857)&quot; (German: &quot;Die Chronik der Sperlingsgasse&quot;). This book, which contains sketches of life among the German bourgeoisie, quickly became popular.

With this encouragement, Raabe gave up his studies and devoted himself entirely to literary work. He returned to Wolfenbüttel, and then lived (1862–1870) in Stuttgart. Then he again returned to Brunswick and remained active until the end of the century, publishing upwards of 30 novels and a number of short stories and sketches. He died in 1910 and was buried in Braunschweig Main Cemetery.

==Work==

Raabe&#x27;s life work may be divided into three periods. During the first, he wrote with a light touch, producing a series of pictures of German life from the abundance of his imagination and experience, among which are: 
* &quot;Die Chronik der Sperlingsgasse&quot; (1856)
* &quot;Die Kinder von Finkenrode&quot; (1859)
* &quot;Unser Herrgotts Kanzlei&quot; (1862)

The influence of the pessimism of Schopenhauer is evident during the second period. Representative works of this period are: 
* &quot;Der Hungerpastor&quot; (1864)
* &quot;Abu Telfan&quot; (1867)
* &quot;Der Schüdderump&quot; (1870)
These three works are sometimes referred to as a trilogy. While they are independent of each other in substance, they do represent a distinct epoch in the life of Raabe.

During the third period of the novelist&#x27;s life his works no longer show this pessimistic strain. A genial humor pervades them, reminiscent of Dickens, though they frequently deal with serious subjects. &quot;Horacker&quot; (1876) perhaps best represents this tendency, and has been cited as his masterpiece. &quot;Der Dräumling&quot; (1872), and &quot;Deutscher Mondschein&quot; (1873), also come under this head. Of his numerous later works &quot;Das Odfeld&quot; (1889) and &quot;Die Akten des Vogelsangs&quot; (1895) seemed to be most read. &quot;Kloster Lugau&quot; (1894) and &quot;Hastenbeck&quot; (1899) also belong to this period.

Raabe&#x27;s early works were influenced to some extent by Jean Paul. Later he shows evidences of having read Dickens and Thackeray.

His estimation by the German people was especially shown at the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1901. Beginning in 1965, the critical edition of Raabe&#x27;s complete works was published as &quot;Sämtliche Werke&quot; (Braunschweiger Ausgabe) commissioned by the Braunschweigischen Wissenschaftlichen Gesellschaft and edited by Karl Hoppe.

<text>Getting Even with Dad is a 1994 American comedy film starring Macaulay Culkin and Ted Danson.

==Plot ==
Timmy Gleason is the estranged son of ex-con Ray Gleason and has been living with his aunt Kitty and her fiancée Wayne since the death of his mother some years earlier. Ray works in a bakery designing cakes. When Kitty goes on her honeymoon with new husband Wayne, she dumps Timmy on a reluctant Ray, leaving him to look after his son in San Francisco for the next week.

Timmy is hoping to spend time with his father, but is largely ignored by Ray, who is in the midst of planning a rare-coin heist with his two cronies Bobby and Carl. The robbery is successful, but Timmy learns of it and hides the stolen coins from them. He uses it to blackmail Ray into spending time with him, promising that he will return the coins afterwards. Thus father and son spend the next few days fishing, playing miniature golf and visiting amusement parks, with an amiable Carl and angry Bobby tagging along.

After Timmy suggests to Carl that he made a map of the coins&#x27; location, Carl and Bobby find a map in Ray&#x27;s bedroom and decide to look for the coins on their own without Timmy or Ray. However, this sends them on a wild goose chase that results in them getting arrested for attempting to steal a chest with communion wine from a church thinking the coins were in there. Realizing the map was fake, Bobby then believes Timmy and Ray set them up.

The police are suspicious of Ray, so Detective Theresa Walsh is assigned by her superior to go undercover and surveil him. By chance, Ray and Timmy get talking to Theresa, unaware of who she really is, and invite her for a coffee and then to dinner. Theresa and Ray develop a mutual attraction, causing her boss concern over her willingness to do her job. Timmy and Ray have also gotten closer, so Timmy decides that he wants to stay with his dad permanently. He urges Ray to forget about the stolen coins, because he will probably be caught and sent back to prison. Ray refuses, so Timmy prepares to return home.

At the last moment, Ray has a change of heart. Bobby, however, appears at the bus station, where at gunpoint he forces Ray to open the locker containing the coins. Ray and Bobby are set upon by the waiting police and arrested. Ray is crushed to discover that Theresa is a cop. However, it turns out that the bag in the locker was full of pennies, so Ray is released again. At Timmy&#x27;s prompting, Theresa finds the rare coins in a gym bag in a department store held by a mannequin. The coins are returned and all charges against Ray are dropped. Ray decides to take on full custody of Timmy and they prepare for a new life together.

==Production==
MGM bought the film as a spec script in a bidding war with Hollywood Pictures, Columbia, TriStar, and Paramount with MGM acquiring the script for $500,000.

Macaulay Culkin&#x27;s character was supposed to have a short haircut in this movie, but Culkin, who had let his hair grow at the time, liked his looks and did not want to cut it. His father, Kit Culkin, demanded his son be allowed to keep his hair the way it was, pointing out that his character was a working-class boy and not a clean-cut, prep school one. He got to keep his long hair.

===Locations===
The theme park featured in the movie was Paramount&#x27;s Great America located in Santa Clara, California. Ray&#x27;s apartment in the movie is located at the corner of Jackson and Mason St. in Chinatown, San Francisco. The church featured in the movie is Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church on 666 Filbert Street in San Francisco. The miniature golf course was filmed at Scandia Family Fun Center located in Rohnert Park, California. The ice rink was located in Berkeley, California. Principal photography took place between July and October 1993.

==Reception==
 Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two out of four stars saying, &quot;It wants to be a caper, a comedy, a romance, and a showcase for Macaulay Culkin. That&#x27;s too much of a stretch.&quot; 
Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also gave the film a negative review explaining that &quot;after plying the audience with formulaic predictability, &quot;Getting Even&quot; doesn&#x27;t even have the decency to end quickly. Minutes away from sending the audience home, it chooses to fall asleep on the job.&quot;

The film grossed $18.8 million in the United States and Canada and $35 million worldwide.

== Year-end lists ==
* Dishonorable mention – Glenn Lovell, &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;
* Worst (not ranked) – Bob Ross, &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;

<text>HMAS &quot;Gascoyne&quot; (K354/F354/A276) was a that served in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Laid down in 1942 and commissioned in 1943, the frigate served during World War II, before being placed in reserve in 1946. Reactivated in 1959, &quot;Gascoyne&quot; was reclassified as a survey and research ship, a role she fulfilled until she was decommissioned again in 1966, and sold for scrap in 1972.

==Construction==
&quot;Gascoyne&quot; was laid down by Mort&#x27;s Dock &amp; Engineering Company, Sydney on 3 July 1942. She was launched on 20 February 1943 by Lady Wakehurst, wife of the Governor of New South Wales, and commissioned into the RAN on 18 November 1943. The ship was named after the Gascoyne River.

==Operational history==
&quot;Gascoyne&quot; was present in Tokyo Bay on Victory over Japan Day (2 September 1945), when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed.

The frigate received five battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;New Guinea 1944&quot;, &quot;Leyte Gulf 1944&quot;, &quot;Lingayen Gulf 1945&quot;, &quot;Borneo 1945&quot;, and &quot;Pacific 1945&quot;.

&quot;Gascoyne&quot; paid off into reserve on 12 April 1946, but recommissioned at Sydney on 8 June 1959 for survey and oceanographic research duty. She was equipped with a deep water mechanical bathythermograph instrument.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Gascoyne&quot; paid off again on 1 February 1966, and was sold for scrap to the Fujita Salvage Company Limited of Osaka in Japan on 15 February 1972. The bathythermograph was transferred to . &quot;Gascoyne&quot; left Melbourne under tow for Japan on 6 July 1972.

<text>Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s is a 1989 American black comedy film directed by Ted Kotcheff, written by Robert Klane, and starring Andrew McCarthy, Jonathan Silverman, Catherine Mary Stewart, and Terry Kiser. 

It tells the story of two young insurance corporation employees who discover that their boss, Bernie, is dead after arriving at his house in The Hamptons. While attempting to convince people that Bernie is still alive until they can leave to prevent them from being falsely suspected for causing his death, they discover that Bernie had, in fact, ordered their killing to cover up his embezzlement. 

&quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot; grossed $30 million on a $15 million budget. The film&#x27;s success inspired the sequel, &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s II&quot;, released in 1993.

==Plot==
Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are two low-level financial employees at an insurance company in New York City. While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers a series of payments made for the same death. He and Larry take their findings to the CEO, the wealthy and hedonistic Bernie Lomax, who commends them for discovering the insurance fraud and invites them to his beach house in The Hamptons for the Labor Day weekend. Unbeknownst to the pair, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partner, Vito, Bernie asks to have the two killed to cover up the discovery. After Bernie leaves, Vito instead orders that Bernie himself be killed for sleeping with Vito&#x27;s girlfriend, Tina.

Bernie arrives before the pair and plans the murders with hitman Paulie on the phone, unaware the conversation is being recorded on his answering machine. Paulie arrives and kills Bernie with a lethal heroin injection, then stages it as self-inflicted accidental overdose.

When Larry and Richard arrive, they find Bernie&#x27;s body, but before they can call the authorities, guests arrive for a party that Bernie usually hosts every weekend. To the pair&#x27;s amazement, the guests are too busy partying to notice he is dead, with his dopey grin from the injection and sunglasses concealing his lifeless state. Fearing implication in Bernie&#x27;s death and wanting to enjoy the luxurious house for the weekend, Larry proposes he and Richard maintain the illusion that Bernie is still alive, which Richard finds absurd. He changes his mind when Gwen Saunders, a summer intern for the company with whom he has a flirtatious relationship, also arrives.

After the party, a drunken Tina arrives at the house and demands the pair direct her to Bernie. However, she also fails to realize the situation and has sex with his corpse. One of Vito&#x27;s mobsters witnesses this and, mistakenly thinking Bernie&#x27;s assassination failed, notifies Vito, who sends Paulie back.

The next morning, Richard is appalled to discover Larry furthering the illusion by manipulating Bernie&#x27;s limbs. He attempts to call the police, but instead activates the phone message detailing Bernie&#x27;s plot against them. Unaware of how Bernie died, they mistakenly believe they are still the targets of a mob hit and, as Bernie had said not to kill them while he was in the area, decide to use Bernie&#x27;s corpse as a shield. All of their attempts to leave the island are thwarted, as they repeatedly misplace and recover Bernie&#x27;s body, and eventually are forced to return to Bernie&#x27;s home. Meanwhile, while they are not looking, Paulie makes numerous other assassination attempts, and grows unhinged at his repeated &quot;failures&quot;.

Gwen, who has been trying to talk to Bernie, is walking on the beach when she sees Larry and Richard with the body. This forces Larry and Richard to reveal his death to her. Paulie then arrives and repeatedly shoots the corpse before turning his attention to Larry, Richard, and Gwen. Chasing after the trio, Paulie corners Larry, who subdues him.

The police arrive and arrest Paulie, taking him away in a straitjacket as he continues to insist Bernie is still alive. Gwen invites Richard to stay with her family for the week while Larry decides to go home to give them space. Bernie&#x27;s body is loaded into an ambulance. However, the gurney rolls away and topples off the boardwalk, dumping the body onto the beach right behind the trio, who run away in terror. Afterwards, a young boy who, earlier, buried the body in the sand, comes along and starts burying it again.

==Cast==
==Production==
Jon Cryer was originally cast in the film, but was replaced by Andrew McCarthy. Shooting took place in New York City in August 1988. The Hamptons scenes were filmed at Bald Head Island, North Carolina, Bernie&#x27;s house was filmed at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, and the ferry scenes were filmed at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 54% approval rating based on 26 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot; wrings a surprising amount of laughs out of its corpse-driven slapstick premise, but one joke can only carry a film so far.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 32 out of 100 based on reviews from five critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;B&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the film &quot;tasteless&quot; and &quot;crude&quot; and felt that in the end it was impossible to &quot;drag one tired joke around for nearly two hours. Like Bernie, the movie ends up dead on its feet.&quot; Roger Ebert echoed this sentiment, arguing that movies centered on dead bodies are rarely funny. Ebert gave the film 1 out of 4 stars, stating &quot;&quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot; makes two mistakes: It gives us a joke that isn&#x27;t very funny, and it expects the joke to carry an entire movie.&quot;

The film grossed $30 million at the box office and was profitable on home video.

The film has remained popular in part because of repeated showings on cable television. &quot;People&quot; described it as having &quot;aged into something close to respectability&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s closing credits feature the song &quot;Hot and Cold&quot;, performed by American singer Jermaine Stewart. It was written by Andy Summers and Winston &quot;Pipe&quot; Matthews, and produced by Richard Rudolph and Michael Sembello. The song was released as a single by Arista in the United States during June 1989 to promote the film.

==Lawsuit==
On January 24, 2014, director Ted Kotcheff and screenwriter Robert Klane filed a lawsuit against Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and 20th Century Fox for breach of contract for profits they claimed were due from the film.
