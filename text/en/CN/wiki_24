<text>KDKA-TV (channel 2), branded CBS Pittsburgh, is a television station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It is owned and operated by the CBS television network through its CBS News and Stations division alongside WPKD-TV (channel 19), an independent station. The two stations share studios at the Gateway Center in Downtown Pittsburgh; KDKA-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in the city&#x27;s Perry North neighborhood. KDKA-TV, along with sister station KYW-TV in Philadelphia, are the only CBS-affiliated television stations east of the Mississippi River with &quot;K&quot; call signs.

KDKA-TV is available on cable in parts of the Johnstown–Altoona, Wheeling–Steubenville and Youngstown areas, as well as several other out-of-market cable systems in northwestern Pennsylvania, western Maryland, northeastern and east-central Ohio, and north-central West Virginia. The farthest south KDKA-TV is carried on cable is in Beverly, West Virginia.

==History==

===DuMont origins (1949–1954)===

The station signed on as WDTV on January 11, 1949, as a primary affiliate of the former DuMont Television Network, while carrying secondary affiliations with CBS, NBC, and ABC. It originally broadcast on channel 3 and was owned and operated by DuMont parent company Allen B. DuMont Laboratories. It was the 51st television station in the U.S., the third and last DuMont-owned station to sign on the air (behind WABD (now WNYW) in New York City and WTTG in Washington, D.C.), and the first owned-and-operated station in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. To mark the occasion, a live television special aired that day from 8:30 to 11 p.m. on WDTV, which began with a one-hour local program broadcast from Syria Mosque in Pittsburgh. The remainder of the show featured live segments from DuMont, CBS, NBC, and ABC with Arthur Godfrey, Milton Berle, DuMont host Ted Steele, and many other celebrities.

The station also represented a milestone in the television industry, providing the link between the Midwestern and East Coast stations which included 13 other cities able to receive live telecasts from Boston to St. Louis for the first time. WDTV was one of the last stations to receive a construction permit before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-imposed four-year freeze on new television station licenses.

When the release of the FCC&#x27;s &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot; ended the license freeze in 1952, DuMont was forced to give up its channel 3 allocation to alleviate interference with nearby stations broadcasting on the frequency, notably NBC-owned WNBK (now WKYC) in Cleveland, which itself moved to the frequency to avoid interference with stations in Columbus and Detroit. WDTV moved its facilities to channel 2 on November 23, 1952; WPSU-TV would later sign on with the channel 3 frequency for the Johnstown–Altoona market. Shortly after moving, it was the first station in the country to broadcast 24 hours a day, seven days a week, advertising that its 1–7 a.m. &quot;Swing Shift Theatre&quot; served the &quot;200,000 workers [in their viewing area] who finished shift work at midnight&quot;. DuMont&#x27;s network of stations on coaxial cable stretched from Boston to St. Louis. These stations were linked together via AT&amp;T&#x27;s coaxial cable feed with the sign-on of WDTV allowing the network to broadcast live programming to all the stations at the same time. Stations not yet connected to the coaxial cable received kinescope recordings via physical delivery.

===Dealing with competition===
Until the end of the freeze, WDTV&#x27;s only competition came in the form of distant signals from stations in Johnstown, Altoona, Wheeling and Youngstown. However, Pittsburgh saw two UHF stations launch during 1953—ABC affiliate WENS (channel 16, later to become WINP-TV), and WKJF-TV (channel 53, later to become WPGH-TV), an independent station. At the time, UHF stations could not be viewed without the aid of an expensive set-top converter, and the picture quality was marginal at best with one. UHF stations in the area faced an additional problem because Pittsburgh is located in a somewhat rugged dissected plateau, and the reception of UHF stations is usually poor in such terrain. These factors played a role in the short-lived existences of both WKJF and WENS.

Although Pittsburgh was the sixth largest market in the country (behind New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Washington/Baltimore), the other VHF stations in town were slow to develop. This was because the major cities in the Upper Ohio Valley are so close together that they must share the VHF band. After the FCC lifted the license freeze in 1952, it refused to grant any new commercial VHF construction permits to Pittsburgh in order to give the smaller cities in the area a chance to get on the air. WDTV had a &quot;de facto&quot; monopoly on Pittsburgh television. Like its sister stations WABD and WTTG, it was far stronger than the DuMont network as a whole. According to network general manager Ted Bergmann, WDTV brought in $4 million a year, which was more than enough to keep the network afloat. Owning the only readily viewable station in such a large market gave DuMont considerable leverage in getting its programs cleared in large markets where it did not have an affiliate. As CBS, NBC and ABC had secondary affiliations with WDTV, this was a strong incentive to stations in large markets to clear DuMont&#x27;s programs or risk losing valuable advertising in the sixth-largest market. Also, NBC affiliates from Johnstown (WJAC-TV, channel 6) and Wheeling (WTRF-TV, channel 7) were able to be received in Pittsburgh and a CBS affiliate from Steubenville, Ohio (WSTV-TV, now WTOV-TV) was also able to be received there as well. CBS, in fact, actually attempted to purchase WSTV-TV&#x27;s license before it went on the air and move its channel 9 allocation to Pittsburgh due to the close proximity between Pittsburgh and Steubenville (At the time less than an hour apart by car; the completion of the Penn-Lincoln Parkway in 1964 reduced that time to about a half-hour driving time today), but the FCC turned CBS down. The Wheeling/Steubenville TV market, despite its very close proximity to Pittsburgh and overlapping signals, remains a separate market by FCC standards today.

WDTV aired all DuMont network shows live and &quot;cherry-picked&quot; the best shows from the other networks, airing them on kinescope on an every-other-week basis. WDTV&#x27;s sign-on was also significant because it was now possible to feed live programs from the East to the Midwest and vice versa. In fact, its second broadcast was the activation of the coaxial cable linking New York City and Chicago. It would be another two years before the West Coast received live programming, but this was the beginning of the modern era of network television.

===As KDKA-TV (1954–present)===

By 1954, DuMont was in serious financial trouble. Paramount Pictures, which owned a stake in DuMont, vetoed a merger with ABC, who had merged with Paramount&#x27;s former theater division United Paramount Theaters a year before. A few years earlier, the FCC had ruled that Paramount controlled DuMont and there were still lingering questions about whether UPT had actually broken off from Paramount. Paramount did not want to risk the FCC&#x27;s wrath.

Meanwhile, Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric Corporation had been competing with local politicians to acquire the non-commercial channel 13 license from the FCC, as no other Pittsburgh-allocated VHF station would be signing on for the foreseeable future. After launching WBZ-TV in Boston in 1948 and purchasing two other television stations, Westinghouse was growing impatient with not having a station in its own home market. Before the freeze, Westinghouse was a shoo-in for the channel 6 license that would later be given to WJAC-TV in Johnstown after that station gave up the channel 13 allocation to Pittsburgh as part of the FCC&#x27;s reallocation plan. Westinghouse later offered a compromise plan to the FCC, in which the commission would grant Westinghouse the channel 13 license; Westinghouse would then &quot;share&quot; the facility with the educational licensee. Finding the terms unacceptable, Pittsburgh attorney Leland Hazard called Westinghouse CEO Gwilym Price to ask him if he should give up on his fight for public television. Price said that Hazard should keep fighting for it, giving Westinghouse backing for the station that would eventually become WQED.

Westinghouse then turned its attention to WDTV, offering DuMont a then-record $9.75 million for the station in late 1954. Desperate for cash, DuMont promptly accepted Westinghouse&#x27;s offer. While the sale gave DuMont a short-term cash infusion, it eliminated DuMont&#x27;s leverage in getting clearances in other major markets. Within two years, the DuMont network was no more. Once the sale closed in January 1955, Westinghouse changed WDTV&#x27;s call letters to KDKA-TV, after Westinghouse&#x27;s pioneering radio station KDKA (1020 AM). As such, it became one of the few stations east of the Mississippi River with a &quot;K&quot; call sign.

As KDKA radio had long been an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network (Westinghouse was a co-founder of RCA, NBC&#x27;s then-parent company), it was expected that KDKA-TV would eventually become a primary affiliate of the NBC television network. But the network was seeking to purchase Westinghouse&#x27;s Philadelphia stations, KYW radio and WPTZ (now KYW-TV). When Westinghouse balked, NBC threatened to pull its programming from WPTZ and Boston&#x27;s WBZ-TV unless Westinghouse agreed to trade its Philadelphia properties for NBC&#x27;s radio and television properties in Cleveland. (Related to the trade, Westinghouse received a cross-station waiver from the FCC to own the Cleveland properties due to overlapping signals with KDKA radio and channel 2.) The decision would lead to an acrimonious relationship between Westinghouse and NBC in later years. Two years after the ownership change, channel 2 became a primary affiliate of the higher-rated CBS network instead. KDKA-TV retained secondary affiliations with NBC until WIIC-TV (channel 11, now WPXI) signed on in 1957, and ABC until WTAE-TV (channel 4) signed on in 1958. Despite the ending of its commercial VHF monopoly, KDKA-TV did welcome competitor WIIC-TV on the air. KDKA-TV became the flagship station of Westinghouse&#x27;s broadcasting arm, Group W. During the late 1950s, KDKA-TV was briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network, sharing the affiliation with WTAE-TV, WIIC-TV, and WQED. On November 22, 1963, newscaster Bill Burns provided almost three hours of live coverage after the shooting of President John F. Kennedy.

In 1994, Westinghouse was looking to make a group-wide affiliation deal for its stations as part of a larger plan to transform itself into a major media conglomerate after WJZ-TV lost its ABC affiliation to Scripps-owned WMAR-TV in an affiliation deal spurred by Fox&#x27;s affiliation deal with New World Communications. Westinghouse negotiated with NBC and CBS for a deal. Had Westinghouse signed with NBC, KDKA-TV would affiliate itself with NBC 40 years after passing up the network, with the CBS affiliation going to WPXI, who had originally intended to affiliate itself with CBS until the NBC-Westinghouse feud started as well as channel 11&#x27;s own sign-on problems in the 1950s. While NBC (the highest-rated network during much of the 1980s and 1990s) offered more money, CBS was interested in the programming opportunities Westinghouse offered, due to its own stagnation in programming at the time. CBS also offered a potential merger of their respective radio networks down the road (which ultimately happened), while NBC had abandoned radio in 1987. Ultimately, Westinghouse signed a long-term deal with CBS to convert the entire five-station Group W television unit to a group-wide CBS affiliation, making the Pittsburgh market one of the few major markets that were not affected by the affiliation switches.

In 1995, Westinghouse acquired CBS, making KDKA-TV a CBS owned-and-operated station, after four decades as being simply a CBS affiliate. In 1997, Westinghouse became CBS Corporation, which would then merge with Viacom (which had been Paramount&#x27;s parent since 1994) in 2000, making KDKA-TV a sister station with Pittsburgh UPN affiliate WNPA-TV (channel 19, now independent station WPKD-TV). Five years later, Viacom became the new CBS Corporation and spun off a new Viacom. In May 2003, KDKA-TV retired the distinctive Group W font in its logo after 40 years, adopting a more standardized CBS branding identity.

In August 2007, KDKA-TV unveiled a new image campaign, entitled &quot;Your Home&quot;, with music and lyrics performed by singer-songwriter Bill Deasy. The promo features scenes of Pittsburgh and its surrounding areas, as well as three of the station&#x27;s personalites. In September 2007, the station unveiled another promo featuring the Joe Grushecky song &quot;Coming Home&quot;. Later, a third spot, &quot;Long Way Home&quot;, was introduced, featuring the voice of Kelsey Friday.

On February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to sell CBS Radio to Entercom (now Audacy), currently the fourth-largest radio broadcasting company in the United States. The sale was completed on November 17, 2017, and was conducted using a Reverse Morris Trust so that it was tax-free. While CBS shareholders retained a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was the surviving entity, with KDKA radio and its sister stations now separated from KDKA-TV, though the three stations maintain a strong news and content sharing agreement.

On December 4, 2019, CBS Corporation and Viacom remerged into ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global).

On March 21, 2023, KDKA-TV adopted a new logo and on-air branding in accordance with the current CBS &quot;deconstructed eye&quot; corporate identity; the new brand maintains the &quot;KDKA-TV News&quot; title as a verbal brand alongside a standardized &quot;CBS News Pittsburgh&quot; logo. Though most of its sister stations went with the corporate blue/white color scheme as a default, the station instead went with a black and gold scheme, embolic of the primary and secondary colors used in the flag of Pittsburgh, along with the city&#x27;s professional sports teams. Conversely, its sister station in Philadelphia, KYW-TV, went with a black and green motif matching that of the Philadelphia Eagles.

==Programming==
Part of the 1995 affiliation agreement between CBS and Westinghouse included a deal to carry the entire CBS lineup in pattern, with no preemptions except for extended breaking news coverage or local news events. In the fall of 1995, channel 2 began running the entire CBS lineup in pattern, as it, and sister station KPIX-TV in San Francisco, were already affiliated with the network. However, unlike its rivals, KDKA-TV runs the weekday edition of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; a half-hour later, from 7 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time, due to its evening newscast running for three full hours from 4 to 7 p.m. The weekend editions usually air on Saturdays at 6:30 p.m. and Sundays at 6 p.m.

===Preempted programming===
Prior to 1995, channel 2 preempted moderate amounts of CBS programming. From the early 1960s to July 1990, the station did not clear &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, except for a brief period from December 1976 to October 1978. At the same time, WTAJ-TV in Altoona had run the program and was viewable in much of Pittsburgh itself and the eastern part of the market, and was even carried on many Pittsburgh-area cable systems well into the 1980s. Also, CBS affiliates WTOV-TV in Steubenville (until 1980) and WTRF-TV in Wheeling (from 1980) were viewable in Pittsburgh and points west. Until 1978, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; ran on WPGH and for a few years after that, it ran on WPTT-TV (channel 22). KDKA-TV also preempted the daytime game shows and reruns from CBS at various points during the 1970s. KDKA-TV was one of four CBS affiliates to preempt the 1974 film &quot;Death Wish&quot; on its television debut despite the network&#x27;s 30+ cuts to its violent content; these affiliates objected not only to the remaining amount of violence in the film, but also to the apparent endorsement by the film of vigilante violence. The station also occasionally preempted other CBS prime time programs for a syndicated movie, local news special, or sports (during the years in which the station had broadcast rights to Pittsburgh Pirates baseball and Pittsburgh Penguins hockey). Weekend preemptions included a small portion of Saturday and Sunday morning cartoons, and Sunday morning religious programs. In 1993, KDKA-TV stopped running &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; and instead ran Disney&#x27;s syndicated cartoon block. Despite the preemptions, CBS was mostly satisfied with KDKA-TV, as it was the far-and-away market leader in Pittsburgh owing to its eight-year head-start on its main competitors.

===Syndicated and local talk shows===
As a Westinghouse-owned station, KDKA-TV carried the numerous syndicated talk shows produced by its subsidiary Group W Productions, including &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;Evening Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Hour Magazine&quot;. It also produced a local program titled &quot;Pittsburgh Talks&quot;.

Later in the 1980s, KDKA-TV carried the early seasons of the syndicated &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, though in separate time slots as opposed to the standard practice of airing them back-to-back; the station lost both shows to WPXI in 1988. Channel 2 also aired another King World Productions-distributed program, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, during its first nine nationally syndicated seasons (1986–1995), airing the show weekdays at 5 p.m. In 1989, KDKA-TV acquired the rights to &quot;The Sally Jessy Raphael Show&quot;, airing it weekdays at 9 a.m. and &quot;Donahue&quot; weekdays at 4 p.m., respectively. However, due to the poor ratings of &quot;Donahue&quot; in the Pittsburgh market, KDKA-TV showed strong interest in new talk shows.

&quot;Sally&quot; and &quot;Donahue&quot; moved to WTAE-TV in 1993, and two years later, KDKA-TV debuted a 5 p.m. newscast, at which point &quot;Oprah&quot; also moved to WTAE-TV, airing at 4 p.m. In 1997, &quot;The Ricki Lake Show&quot; moved to WPGH-TV and &quot;Sally&quot; returned to KDKA-TV, and once again was given the 9 a.m. time slot, where it remained on and off until its cancellation in 2002. &quot;Sally&quot; was a success in the Pittsburgh area, even beating &quot;Montel Williams&quot; on WPXI in the 1990s. A revamped version of &quot;Pittsburgh 2day Live&quot; replaced &quot;Sally&quot;.

KDKA-TV aired &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; during its entire six-year run at the 4 p.m. time slot. After the show ended its run in 2002, rather than airing its replacement (the short-lived &quot;Caroline Rhea Show&quot;, which aired on WPXI), KDKA-TV became the first station in the Pittsburgh market to air a 4 p.m. newscast.

From August 2020 to March 2023, &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; was the only syndicated show airing on KDKA-TV in any capacity outside of the graveyard slot between the post-late fringe and breakfast television, as the station aired either CBS network programming or local news throughout the day except for the 3–4 p.m. slot for &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, with sister station WPKD now airing a heavy syndicated schedule during daytime programming. With &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; ending its run, rather than expanding its evening newscasts to five hours, KDKA-TV launched a new afternoon talk-show spinoff of &quot;PTL&quot; called &quot;Talk Pittsburgh&quot; on March 20, 2023. &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; has since aired on sister station WPKD-TV.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
As CBS holds the broadcast contract with the NFL to show games involving AFC teams, KDKA-TV has been the official broadcaster of most Pittsburgh Steelers games since 1998, and serves as the team&#x27;s flagship station. The team&#x27;s preseason games that are not nationally televised are also shown on KDKA-TV. KDKA-TV began its relationship with the Steelers in 1962, when CBS first started the leaguewide television package. The Steelers are one of three AFC teams that predate the AFC&#x27;s basis league, the American Football League, and so KDKA-TV, and not WTAE-TV or WIIC-TV (now WPXI), carried Steelers road games (home games were blacked out locally under all circumstances until 1973, when sold-out home games began to be allowed on local television)—the AFL had television contracts with ABC, and later, NBC.

Due to the NFL rules of the time, after the AFL-NFL merger (and with it, the Steelers move to the newly formed AFC), KDKA-TV did not broadcast any Steelers games from 1970 to 1972 (Steeler games were exclusive to what was then WIIC-TV in that period). Beginning in 1973, KDKA-TV was allowed to air any Steelers games in which they hosted a team from the National Football Conference, which contained most of the old-line NFL teams. KDKA-TV also broadcast two Steeler championship wins, Super Bowl X in 1976 and Super Bowl XIV in 1980. Since the Steelers have sold out every home game starting in 1972, no blackouts have been required. In the meantime, from 1970 to 1997, channel 11 aired most Steelers games (and exclusively from 1970 to 1972).

When the NFC package moved from CBS to Fox in 1994, WPGH-TV aired the Steelers games that had before aired on KDKA-TV, leaving the senior station without Steelers games for four years. Today, and in general since 1970, the only exceptions to all the above are when the Steelers play at night. Their &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games have always aired locally on WTAE-TV, first when ABC had the rights, and since 2006, on ESPN. WTAE-TV also aired simulcasts of their games aired as part of &quot;ESPN Sunday Night Football&quot; from 1987 to 2005 (since 2006, WPXI airs Steelers games when they play on Sunday nights). The NFL requires games on cable channels to be simulcast over-the-air in the markets of the participating teams (again with the home team&#x27;s broadcast subject to blackout). WTAE-TV has simulcast ESPN-aired games because ESPN is 20% owned by WTAE-TV&#x27;s owners, Hearst Corporation—their ABC stations have right of first refusal for these simulcasts. Games on TNT and NFL Network have aired on various stations in the area. In 2014, with the NFL&#x27;s new &#x27;cross-flex&#x27; broadcast rules, any games that involve the Steelers playing another AFC opponent (or NFC opponent on the road) scheduled to air on KDKA-TV can now air on Fox station WPGH-TV.

===News operation===

KDKA-TV presently broadcasts 43 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday, hours on Saturdays and hours on Sundays); KDKA-TV also produces 3 hours, 35 minutes of local newscasts each weekday for its independent sister station WPKD-TV, in the form of a two-hour extension of KDKA-TV&#x27;s weekday morning newscast at 7 a.m., a prime time newscast at 8 p.m., and a nightly 35-minute newscast at 10 p.m. The station also shares newsgathering operations and co-produces certain public affairs shows with the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; newspaper.

Under Westinghouse ownership, KDKA-TV used the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; branding for its newscasts, pioneered by sister station KYW-TV. That, combined with being locally owned, saw the station dominate its local news ratings for decades, though WTAE-TV became more competitive in the 1970s with its &quot;Action News&quot; format (which it still uses the branding for today), as well as signing over ex-KDKA-TV talent Paul Long and Don Cannon and a general larger investment in its news department by its owner Hearst Communications.

The 1990s saw many changes to the news department at KDKA-TV, notably Westinghouse&#x27;s purchase of CBS and moving its headquarters to New York City (thus losing its locally owned status), as well as KDKA-TV losing its flagship station status to WCBS-TV and KCBS-TV. Additionally, the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; branding was dropped on April 22, 1996, in favor of simply &quot;KDKA-TV News&quot;. By this point, WPXI had become more competitive with KDKA-TV and WTAE-TV due to its own investment into the news department back in the 1980s by its owner Cox Media Group, leading to a spirited three-way battle for first place in a market KDKA-TV once dominated.

In 2001, KDKA-TV began producing a 10 p.m. newscast on WNPA (now WPKD-TV); in 2005, it added a two-hour weekday morning newscast from 7 to 9 a.m. on that station (which was later reduced to one hour from 7 to 8 a.m., but in 2019 the 8 a.m. hour was restored).

On June 16, 2009, KDKA-TV began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

In January 2019, the station fired an employee who programmed a lower third graphic to refer to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as a &quot;known cheater&quot; during a report on Super Bowl LIII.

KDKA-TV launched a streaming news service, CBSN Pittsburgh (a localized version of the national CBSN service) on March 5, 2020, as part of a rollout of similar services across the CBS-owned stations. It was rebranded to CBS News Pittsburgh in early 2022.

On August 17, 2020, KDKA premiered a new weekday news program at 7:30 p.m., replacing &quot;Extra&quot;, which is still seen overnights. This competes against WTAE-TV&#x27;s 7 p.m. newscast on its Cozi TV subchannel, leaving KDKA-TV the only station in the Pittsburgh market to air a newscast during the Prime Time Access Hour on its main signal. On January 8, 2024, KDKA-TV premiered an 8 p.m. newscast on WPKD to replace CW network programming after Paramount Global&#x27;s deal with Nexstar Media Group. 

====Ratings====
As of May 2015, KDKA-TV is the most watched news station in the Pittsburgh area in the hours of Noon, 4, 5, 6 and 11 p.m.; the 7 a.m. newscast it produces for WPKD rated quite strongly at that time slot. However, WTAE-TV is the most watched news program in the area at 6 a.m. WPXI is also most watched at the 5 a.m. hour. WPGH-TV is the 10 p.m. newscast leader; WPXI has supplied its newscasts since 2006.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KDKA-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate, during that night&#x27;s broadcast of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The station showed the &quot;High Flight&quot; video clip, and a compilation of their analog history with &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as background music, before signing off with DuMont test card and original name. As part of the SAFER Act, KDKA-TV kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters. On June 17, 2009, during the nightlight period, KDKA-TV temporarily resumed regular programming to air severe weather coverage. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 25, using virtual channel 2.

In July 2009, the station applied to the FCC to operate two repeater signals: channel 31 in Morgantown, West Virginia, and channel 40 in Johnstown.

<text>WTAE-TV (channel 4) is a television station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, affiliated with ABC. It has been owned by Hearst Television since the station&#x27;s inception, making this one of two stations that have been built and signed on by Hearst (alongside company flagship WBAL-TV in Baltimore). WTAE-TV&#x27;s studios are located on Ardmore Boulevard (PA 8) in the suburb of Wilkinsburg (though with a Pittsburgh mailing address), and its transmitter is located in Buena Vista, Pennsylvania.

==History==
WTAE-TV began broadcasting on September 14, 1958; the station has been Pittsburgh&#x27;s ABC affiliate since its sign-on.

Pittsburgh had only one major commercial television station for close to a decade—DuMont-owned WDTV (channel 2, now KDKA-TV), which signed on in 1949 and carried programs from all four television networks (DuMont, ABC, NBC and CBS). Further development of stations in Pittsburgh was halted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s freeze on license awards, which ran from 1948 until 1952. Even after the freeze was lifted by the FCC, new VHF stations in Pittsburgh were held back to give the smaller cities in the Upper Ohio Valley a chance to get on the owing to VHF band limitations.

Several months after the freeze was lifted, two UHF stations in Pittsburgh, WENS-TV (channel 16, now WINP-TV) and WKJF-TV (channel 53, now WPGH-TV), went on the air. For technical and financial reasons, both stations were short-lived. Meanwhile, revisions to the VHF allocation had given the Pittsburgh area three additional channels—4, 11, and 13, the latter reserved for non-commercial educational purposes. The channel 4 frequency on which WTAE-TV began operations during the analog television era was originally allocated to suburban McKeesport, in Allegheny County; other official documents have listed the community of license as Irwin, in Westmoreland County.

Hearings on the channel 4 permit opened in 1955, and it was originally granted by the FCC to KQV radio in 1956. Hearst and the other three applicants that lost petitioned the FCC to re-open the permit hearings following the death of KQV co-owner Irwin D. Wolf. The subsequent reconsideration awarded channel 4 to Hearst. The agency&#x27;s commissioners were divided on how to break the stalemate to the satisfaction of both winning parties, and suggested a merger between Hearst and the KQV group, who sold their radio station to ABC to appease FCC cross-ownership restrictions. Together, both firms became equal partners in Television City, Inc., under which ownership WTAE-TV went on the air. Hearst would purchase the remaining 50 percent of the station in 1962. WTAE-TV is the only Pittsburgh television station affiliated with a major network not to have changed ownership.

Shortly before the station signed on, the FCC moved the channel 4 assignment to Pittsburgh proper following several years of petitioning by then-Pittsburgh mayor (and future Governor of Pennsylvania) David L. Lawrence. However, the FCC changed its rules so that channel 4 could have based its main studio in Pittsburgh, even if it had been licensed to McKeesport or Irwin. The station&#x27;s original ownership group&#x27;s connections with powerful U.S. Senator from Florida, George Smathers led to televised U.S. House hearings with both Lawrence and Smathers testifying in 1958. WTAE-TV was thus short-spaced to other channel 4 stations in Detroit, Michigan; Columbus, Ohio; Oak Hill, West Virginia; Buffalo, New York; and Washington, D.C.; the transmitter was located southeast of the city as a result of the move. Shortly after signing on, WTAE-TV was briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network, sharing the affiliation with KDKA-TV, WIIC-TV (now WPXI), and WQED.

WTAE-TV first adopted the &quot;Circle 4&quot; logo in 1973, eventually adopting the current version in 1995. Due to the design and similar callsigns, the logo has received comparisons to fellow ABC affiliate WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee, who has used the &quot;Circle 6&quot; logo since 2011. Aside from the ABC affiliation, the two stations are not related. In 2012, the &quot;Circle 4&quot; logo surpassed KDKA-TV&#x27;s Group W-era logo that in various forms was used from 1965 to 2003 for the longest-used station logo on Pittsburgh television. WOTV in southwestern Michigan uses a similar device for its &quot;channel 4&quot; logo. 

On April 24, 1980, WTAE-TV personality Nick Perry, who hosted &quot;Bowling for Dollars&quot; and also called the lottery drawings for the Pennsylvania Lottery, fixed the Lottery&#x27;s daily numbers drawing so that it would come up as &quot;6-6-6&quot;. Perry served jail time, and the drawings were moved to WHP-TV in Harrisburg a year later. This resulted in lotteries now being audited and monitored with &quot;witnesses&quot; from the government and/or accounting firms, and also inspired the movie &quot;Lucky Numbers&quot;. KDKA-TV aired the Lottery drawings in the Pittsburgh market after this incident until 2009, when they moved back to WTAE-TV.

In April 1985, WTAE-TV became the only station in the United States to transmit the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s &quot;WrestleMania&quot; event free over-the-air, after a technical glitch prematurely ended the event&#x27;s closed-circuit broadcast from the Civic Arena.
In 1986, WTAE-TV partnered with The Salvation Army and started &quot;Project Bundle Up&quot;, an operation to make sure that children and seniors receive warm clothing. WTAE-TV has run the &quot;Project Bundle Up Auction&quot; where local businesses donate products to be auctioned off, and the &quot;Project Bundle Up Telethon&quot;, where viewers call in to donate money. Businesses donate money and all of their proceeds from the auction and telethon to benefit the Salvation Army. In 2007, WTAE-TV moved the auction to the Internet.

In early 2001, Hearst bought Clarksburg, West Virginia–based NBC affiliate WBOY-TV, which has a significant signal overlap with WTAE-TV (a year earlier, the FCC began to allow companies to own television stations with overlapping coverage areas). However, Hearst decided to sell WBOY-TV to West Virginia Media Holdings in September of that year after less than a year of ownership; that station is now owned by Nexstar Media Group, who to this day does not own or operate a station serving Pittsburgh.

In June 2011, a WTAE-TV staff photographer was charged with a sexual crime when an alleged victim stated that the photographer had inappropriate physical contact with her. The photographer arrived in a WTAE-TV news vehicle with station equipment and claimed he was doing an interview, although WTAE-TV management claims that he was not on duty at the time—even though he was using station resources.

In the early years, Channel 4 was best known in the market for its locally originated entertainment programming, including popular early program late night movie show &quot;Shock Theatre&quot;, which was hosted by former Pittsburgh radio disc jockey Bob Drews, who portrayed Sir Rodger (often misspelled as Sir Roger). &quot;Shock Theatre&quot; featured monster movies such as &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; in-between live-action comedic skits. By the 1970s, WTAE-TV was running a mix of cartoons and sitcoms from 6:30 to 9 am, a local talk show, some ABC shows, more cartoons and off-network sitcoms in the afternoon, news and some first run shows in the evening, and ABC prime time programming.

===Sports programming===
Owing to parent company Hearst&#x27;s 20% minority stake in ESPN, WTAE-TV has the right of first refusal for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games featuring the Pittsburgh Steelers; the station has aired all &quot;MNF&quot; games since the program&#x27;s inception in 1970, even though the program moved from ABC to ESPN after the 2005 season. The station aired the Steelers&#x27; Super Bowl XL victory in 2006, which was the last NFL game aired on ABC until the 2015 Wild Card game.

WTAE-TV also aired select Pittsburgh Pirates games via ABC&#x27;s MLB broadcast contract from 1976 to 1989, including the team&#x27;s 1979 World Series championship.

WTAE-TV serves as the over-the-air television provider for the Pittsburgh Penguins via ESPN/ABC&#x27;s NHL broadcasting contract from 2022 to 2028.

===Past program preemptions and deferrals===
Although it was the only ABC affiliate in the region when it signed on at the time, WTAE-TV preempted and/or delayed a considerable amount of ABC programming, most notably some of its daytime lineup from the 1960s to the late 1990s. WTAE-TV did not begin running &quot;Good Morning America&quot; until December 1978, and only aired an hour of the program until 1980. &quot;One Life to Live&quot; did not run on WTAE-TV from its 1968 debut up until 1978, when the soap opera expanded to an hour-long format. Another soap opera, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, was aired at 10 a.m. on a delay from December 2, 1975 (the day after its relocation from CBS to ABC) until August 13, 1982. From 1969 to 1971, and again from 1974 to 1979, ABC shows that were not broadcast on channel 4 ended up airing instead on WPGH-TV. After 1980, some of these shows ran on WPTT (channel 22, now WPNT). WTAE-TV also preempted the Sunday morning ABC children&#x27;s programming block the entire time ABC offered it, as well as a couple of hours of ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning cartoons until 1979. WTAE-TV ran syndicated cartoons in place of the network-supplied children&#x27;s programs, while the preempted Saturday morning network programs (including &quot;American Bandstand&quot;) aired on WPGH during that time.

By the 1980s, WTAE-TV was running many of the top rated off-network syndicated sitcoms from 4 to 6 p.m. By 1990, WTAE-TV was beginning to focus more on news, and in 1992 dropped the entire ABC Saturday morning cartoon lineup for a hour newscast (which WPXI was also doing, beginning in 1990). WTAE-TV also expanded its midday newscast to an hour and dropped &quot;The Home Show&quot; during 1991. &quot;Loving&quot; was dropped from the daytime lineup in January 1991 and moved to overnights, then dropped from the schedule altogether in 1992. Later in the decade, WTAE-TV also did not carry &quot;Mike and Maty&quot; or &quot;The City&quot;. WTAE-TV began carrying &quot;Port Charles&quot; in January 1998, but dropped the show entirely in September 2000, three years shy of its cancellation by ABC, and replaced it with &quot;Judge Hatchett&quot;, which itself was replaced by &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; in 2004. Beginning in 1996, WTAE-TV began running two hours of the ABC Saturday cartoon lineup on Sunday mornings, a half-hour on Saturday mornings, and a half-hour at 12:30 p.m. In 1997, the station cut back its Saturday morning newscast to three hours at 7 to 10 a.m. and began running three hours of the ABC children&#x27;s lineup from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Today, though it still offers a news-intensive schedule, WTAE-TV clears the entire ABC lineup. Viewers and ABC had also begun to clamor for &quot;The View&quot;, which premiered in 1997 to acclaim, and success compared to ABC&#x27;s past late morning programs (and was also under the network&#x27;s full editorial control), to air in Pittsburgh at its prescribed time. WTAE had continued to delay &quot;The View&quot; to late night until March 27, 2000, when it began to air in its proper 11 a.m. time slot.

WTAE-TV was one of many ABC stations that preempted the special showing of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; in late 2004 due to concerns that the FCC would impose a fine on them if they had aired the World War II–set movie due to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy earlier that year. The station, along with other Hearst-owned ABC affiliated stations, aired the 1992 film &quot;Far and Away&quot; instead. ABC affiliate WYTV in Youngstown, Ohio, still aired &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, giving viewers in the northern and western portions of WTAE-TV&#x27;s viewing area the option of watching the film. It was later determined that the movie&#x27;s broadcast was not a violation of FCC regulations.

===News operation===
WTAE-TV presently broadcasts 43 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, five hours on Saturdays and hours on Sundays). Like its NBC rival, WPXI, Channel 4 was not a major player in news coverage in its early years, as the Pittsburgh market was dominated by KDKA-TV and anchor Bill Burns. That changed in 1969, when longtime KDKA radio-and-TV newscaster Paul Long joined WTAE-TV, along with his KDKA meteorologist-sidekick Joe DeNardo. WTAE-TV was known for the &quot;legendary&quot; news crew of Paul Long and Don Cannon from the late 1960s into the 1990s.

Sports has been a major division at WTAE-TV. In 1972, WTAE-TV sportscaster Myron Cope, thanks to a phone call from a female fan, introduced the phrase &quot;The Immaculate Reception&quot; to describe Franco Harris&#x27; miraculous, running shoestring catch that gave the Pittsburgh Steelers a 13–7 playoff victory over the Oakland Raiders (Cope chuckled at the woman&#x27;s call, and responded, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I can say that!&quot; Cope figured out an innocuous way to introduce the phrase on air, prefacing the remark by saying, &quot;It comes from a good Christian lady.&quot;) WTAE-TV and its channel 4 logo was immortalized in the 1979 basketball comedy film &quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot;, whose fictional sportscaster Murray Sports (played by Harry Shearer) was also patterned after Cope. The last sports director was Andrew Stockey, who left the position in 2006 to become a news anchor. However, in 2011, he returned to head the sports department. Along with Stockey, the sports department consists of Guy Junker, Ryan Recker, and Bill Hillgrove (&quot;Steeler Insider&quot;) as of 2013.

In the fall of 1990, WTAE gave Pittsburgh its first 5am newscast and expanded its one-hour morning newscast to two hours, shifting the starting time from 6 a.m. to 5 a.m. The move took place the same day KDKA expanded its half-hour morning newscast to an hour and started it at 6 a.m. As it gained news in the morning, WTAE lost news at noon. The station&#x27;s noon news (it was brought back in early 1992) and the resumption of a noon newscast meant Channel 4 had gone full circle in a very short time. It had dropped the noon news and plugged the slot with the short lived game show &quot;The Challengers&quot; (which only lasted one season) and Graham Kerr&#x27;s cooking program (which lasted one season as well) before &quot;Good Day Pittsburgh&quot;.

In June 1992, the station expanded its news production, adding a Saturday morning newscast from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. (matching WPXI&#x27;s Saturday morning newscast of the then-same length, which began in 1990) and a three-hour Sunday morning newscast. The station also extended its weekday early evening newscast to begin at 5 p.m, and began to air a weekday morning newscast from 5 to 7 a.m. In 1997, the station expanded its Sunday morning newscast by an hour and began to air its Saturday morning newscast from 6 to 10 a.m.

In 2002, Jean Connelly became the first woman from Western Pennsylvania to be inducted into the Pennsylvania Broadcasters Hall of Fame. In doing so, she joined ranks with Paul Long, David Crantz, and Fred Young. Connelly is famous for producing and hosting her own talk show, &quot;The Jean Connelly Show&quot;. WTAE-TV unveiled a new set designed by FX Group during the 5 p.m. newscast on September 4, 2007. That year, WTAE-TV debuted a YouTube channel, which features stories featured on channel 4&#x27;s newscasts. On September 15, 2008, WTAE-TV became the second station in the market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. Field reports continued to be broadcast in 4:3 standard-definition until September 2011, when field reports began to be broadcast in 16:9 SD.

At the end of 2011, WTAE-TV on-air talent took to both Twitter and Facebook to voice their opinions about unfair treatment by management. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reported that WTAE-TV&#x27;s on-air staff claimed it was being denied severance benefits for employees fired without cause, a minimum salary scale, overtime pay for work hours totaling more than eight hours a day, retirement benefits equalling those of other employees at the station, and consideration for unscheduled call-outs, split shifts and work on the sixth consecutive day and thereafter. Former general manager Michael Hayes stated that bargaining had been taking place in good faith. An online petition was launched in support of the anchors, reporters, meteorologists, and sportscasters.

====New studio set for newscasts====
On April 28, 2016, WTAE became the third television station in the Pittsburgh DMA to launch a new studio set in Studio B of the WTAE Studios. The design focuses heavily on the use of video monitors, Pittsburgh culture, and HD lighting.

====&quot;Pittsburgh&#x27;s Action News 4 at 7 on Cozi TV Pittsburgh&quot;====
On January 6, 2016, WTAE announced that the station will add a 7 p.m. newscast on subchannel 4.2 beginning February 1. The newscast will be hosted by current weekend morning anchor Jackie Cain and chief meteorologist Mike Harvey. &quot;We understand viewers are constantly looking for news, no matter what time of the day,&quot; said WTAE President &amp; general manager Charles W. Wolfertz III. &quot;Our new 7 p.m. newscast will give viewers more options to get news and weather information when they want it. Whether it&#x27;s on our traditional broadcast station, on-line, or on a mobile device, WTAE Channel 4 is always looking for more ways to make it convenient for our viewers to get the local news and weather that&#x27;s important to them.&quot;

====&quot;Chronicle&quot;====
In June 2013, WTAE-TV announced that longtime anchor Sally Wiggin would host &quot;WTAE Chronicle&quot;, a series of hour-long news specials dedicated to in-depth reporting on relevant topics to Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania. The format was lifted from Boston sister station WCVB-TV, where their &quot;Chronicle&quot; has been on the air since 1982, albeit in the form of a weeknight, half-hour news-magazine. Wiggin shifted from her role as anchor of WTAE-TV&#x27;s noon newscast to focus on &quot;WTAE Chronicle&quot; and additional station projects. &quot;Chronicle&quot; debuted on WTAE-TV in March 2013, with a report from Vatican City on the election of Pope Francis.

The second edition focused on the importance of &quot;The Point&quot;—the iconic area of downtown Pittsburgh where the three rivers meet.

The third edition of &quot;Chronicle&quot; aired on December 3, 2013 (&quot;Concussions &amp; Our Kids&quot;) which focused on brain injuries in youth sports; and the fourth installment aired on March 25 called &quot;Living Like Lou&quot; a special on Pittsburghers with ALS. The original broadcast was accompanied simultaneously with a one-hour telethon to raise funds for ALS assistance; it resulted in over $130,000 raised.

A fifth edition debuted on September 15 right after the season premiere of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; called &quot;Chronicle: The New Pittsburgh&quot;. It focused on the rebirth and growth of Pittsburgh in the past twenty years.

The sixth edition was centered on the highly debated topic around fracking or natural gas drilling in Western Pennsylvania. The edition titled &quot;Drilling Down&quot; was the first look at the topic from three perspectives: the drilling companies, the protesters, and the communities impacted by the wells.

The seventh edition called &quot;Chronicle: Taste of the &#x27;Burgh&quot; was aired to massive ratings and focused on Pittsburgh&#x27;s growing &quot;Foodie&quot; culture, its impact on the local economy, employment, and national attention. It is the highest viewed &quot;Chronicle&quot; to date.

The eighth edition of &quot;Chronicle&quot; called &quot;Burning Questions&quot; dealt with the ongoing issue in Western Pennsylvania local fire departments failing to meet the national standards for fire response times. It consisted of a four-month-long investigation, laying the foundation for a comprehensive, eye-opening look at the challenges for first responders. This installment of Chronicle examines how volunteers are struggling to make do with a 200-year-old system, putting our communities at risk. It was high-profile installment that opened up discussions with the state, regional, and local leaders to help solve the problem. The ratings for it won the night.

&quot;Chronicle: After War&quot;, the ninth installment of the series, examined the life of Western Pennsylvania&#x27;s military men, women and their families after the battle has ended. Local combat veterans are now struggling to find jobs while adjusting to family life and their physical disabilities. America&#x27;s longest war has ended, and a new generation of veterans is transitioning to life at home. The online live video stream was picked up veterans organizations around the country and the highest watched &quot;Chronicle&quot; to date.

&quot;Chronicle: Dog Stories&quot;, the tenth installment of the series, dove into Pittsburgh&#x27;s love affair with dogs, from the ones that protect us at home and overseas to the shelter culture here in the &#x27;Burgh. It also looked at the shelter culture in Pittsburgh and how humans and dogs have worked together to form an incredible bond.

All ten were ratings hits in the Pittsburgh television market.

====Awards and honors====

In March 2008, the station won a Freedom of Information Award and an IRE Medal from the Investigative Reporters and Editors for &quot;pushing open the front door&quot; of the state-run student loan agency. In April 2008, that same effort resulted in a Peabody Award for the station, in recognition of &quot;station&#x27;s relentless legal campaign to obtain public records of a state-run student loan program&quot; which &quot;netted evidence of financial misconduct and pushed the state to rewrite an antiquated right-to-know law&quot;.

In April 2012, WTAE-TV was awarded the Edward R. Murrow Award for &quot;Video Continuing Coverage&quot; of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.

In February 2013, the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters awarded WTAE-TV the following Awards for Excellence in Broadcasting: Outstanding Television Feature Story/Report/Series, Outstanding Television Breaking News Report, and Outstanding Investigative Report.

In April 2013, WTAE-TV was awarded the Edward R. Murrow Award for &quot;Reporting: Hard News&quot; for the Downtown Pittsburgh office building hostage crisis.

In September 2013, WTAE-TV received 21 nominations for the 2013 Regional Emmy Awards, the second most nominations among all the television stations in the state. WTAE-TV took home numerous awards in six categories including special coverage of the Vatican elections with Mike Clark.

In March 2014, it was announced that WTAE-TV will be awarded three awards by the Pennsylvania Broadcasters Association: &quot;Outstanding Television Documentary Program&quot; for &quot;Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Television Public Affairs Program/Series&quot; for &quot;Chronicle&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Television Website&quot; for WTAE.com.

In April 2014, it was announced that WTAE-TV was awarded two Regional Edward R. Murrow Awards by the Radio Television Digital News Association: &quot;Overall Excellence&quot; and &quot;Best Website&quot;. WTAE-TV competed against TV stations all across Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey; including two of the largest TV markets in the U.S.: New York City and Philadelphia.

In August 2014, it was announced that WTAE-TV was nominated for 25 Emmy Awards by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for the Mid-Atlantic Region. On September 20 at the Emmy Awards Gala, it was confirmed that WTAE-TV won more Emmy awards than any other Western PA television station which included the following awards: Health News (Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Research), Health/Environment/Science Program (Chronicle: Living Like Lou), Human Interest (Love Front Porch), Sportscast (September 23, 2013, edition), news Anchor (Wendy Bell), Feature Reporter (Wendy Bell), and for Specialty Reporter (Wendy Bell).

On April 23, 2015, it was announced that WTAE-TV was awarded the Edward R. Murrow Award for Overall Excellence in Television along with an award for Breaking News (for their national coverage of the Franklin Regional Stabbings) and an award Documentary (for &quot;Chronicle: Drilling Down edition&quot;). This is the second year in a row that WTAE-TV has been awarded the Overall Excellence award; no other Pittsburgh station has achieved that.

In May 2015, Anchor/Host Sally Wiggin was inducted into the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. Wiggin joined an elite group of Commonwealth broadcasters, and four former WTAE inductees, whose distinguished service has made a positive impact on audiences and the industry.

On August 11, 2015, it was announced that WTAE-TV had been honored with 18 Emmy Award nominations by the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences for the Mid-Atlantic Region. These nominations were for coverage such as the Franklin Regional HS Stabbings, Investigative Reports, and the various Chronicle editions. Winners will be announced at the Emmy Awards on September 19, 2015. WTAE-TV was awarded the most Emmy nominations among all the television stations in Pittsburgh region. At the Emmy Awards, the station in September received six awards, the most of any standard television in the state and twice as many as its local competitors: WPXI and KDKA.

In 2016, the station won numerous national awards:
* Peabody Award: WTAE earned the Peabody Award from the University of Georgia&#x27;s Grady College of Journalism for its series of special reports &quot;Burning Questions: Investigation into Fire Response Times&quot;.

* Pennsylvania Associated Press Broadcasters Awards: WTAE took home 10 first place awards and four second place awards from the Associated Press ranging from the station&#x27;s Firefighting Series to the Plum School Teacher Sex Scandal. The station also took home the Jim Snyder for Outstanding News Service in 2015.

On September 24, 2016, WTAE-TV received four Emmy Awards from the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, including the Overall Excellence award; the highest honor bestowed each year. Chief Meteorologist Mike Harvey received two Emmys including excellence in weather.

====New Sky 4====
As of October 2013, WTAE-TV launched its new helicopter, carrying over the name &quot;Sky 4&quot;. This new aircraft is the most technologically advanced news gathering helicopter in the region; capable of flying higher, faster, and longer than any other news helicopter in the market.

====NewsOn====
WTAE-TV was the first of two Pittsburgh television stations (along with WPXI) to have its newscasts available on the NewsON app due in part to its ownership group, Hearst Television, being a founding member of the NewsON group.

===Wendy Bell controversy===
WTAE news anchor Wendy Bell was fired in March 2016 after posting comments following the 2016 Wilkinsburg shooting, including: &quot;You needn&#x27;t be a criminal profiler to draw a mental sketch of the killers who broke so many hearts two weeks ago Wednesday... they are young black men.&quot; WTAE-TV&#x27;s president and general manager publicly apologized for the incident on air. Two black males were arrested and charged, but not convicted of the murders. Bell sued her former employer, Hearst Communications, claiming &quot;she wouldn&#x27;t have been fired for her comments if she were not white&quot;. The terms of an out-of-court settlement were not disclosed, though Bell said she &quot;was satisfied&quot;. Bell has since become a controversial conservative talk radio host with runs at KDKA and WJAS, expressing skepticism regarding COVID-19 vaccinations and the validity of the 2020 presidential election.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

On August 3, 2009, WTAE-TV converted its traffic/weather subchannel into a This TV affiliate.

WTAE-TV is among a handful of ABC-affiliated stations and one of five Hearst-owned ABC affiliates (the other four are WCVB-TV in Boston, WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire, KMBC-TV in Kansas City and KETV in Omaha) that broadcast their HDTV signals in 1080i rather than the 720p format of most other ABC stations, which allows the station&#x27;s weather graphics and local advertising (often filmed in 1080i or 1080p) to be carried in a native format without a step of downscaling.

On January 1, 2018, WTAE-TV replaced This on WTAE-DT2 with Cozi TV upon the end of Hearst&#x27;s carriage agreement with parent Tribune Broadcasting for that network.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WTAE-TV signed on its high-definition digital signal on December 3, 1998. WTAE-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 51, using virtual channel 4. 

As part of the SAFER Act, WTAE kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

WTAE-TV operates a 15-kilowatt digital broadcast translator on channel 22 to cover portions of the northern Pittsburgh area which were unable to receive channel 4&#x27;s digital signal. WTAE-TV had to wait for WPMY, which had been operating in analog nightlight mode after terminating regular programming on analog UHF channel 22 on the original February 17 deadline, to leave the channel entirely on March 19 before operating it.

==Out-of-market coverage==
At various times, WTAE-TV has also served as the default ABC affiliate for the neighboring Johnstown–Altoona, Wheeling–Steubenville, and Clarksburg–Weston television markets (all of which could receive WTAE-TV as a grade B signal). With WTAE-TV having long been one of ABC&#x27;s strongest affiliates, both parties reportedly resisted efforts by other television stations in those cities to obtain a full-time ABC affiliation. Since then, one station was eventually granted affiliation in Altoona (WATM-TV), while WBOY-TV in Clarksburg and WTRF-TV in Wheeling began carrying ABC programs through digital subchannel affiliations in August 2008 on WBOY-DT2 (Your ABC) and WTRF-DT3 (ABC Ohio Valley), respectively. WTAE-TV remains available on cable in all three markets. In addition to those areas, WTAE-TV can also be seen on several out-of-market cable systems throughout northwestern and central Pennsylvania, and several locations in eastern and northeast Ohio.

<text>MP3 Surround is an extension of MP3 for multi-channel audio support including 5.1 surround sound. It was developed by Fraunhofer IIS in collaboration with Thomson and Agere Systems, and released in December 2004.

MP3 Surround is backward compatible with standard MP3. The data overhead is 16 kbit/s, which allows for file sizes similar to standard stereo MP3 files. The file size is approximately 10% larger than that of a typical MP3 file. The current evaluation encoder is licensed for personal and non-commercial uses. An MP3 Surround file can be created from 5 or 6 channels of WAV audio.

Several companies, such as DivX, Inc. and Magix, have announced support for the new codec. DivX, Inc. released their first player with MP3 Surround support on September 6, 2006.

In January 2006, Thomson and Fraunhofer IIS also released two new companion technologies: Ensonido, which allows playback of MP3 Surround 5.1 channel sound through stereo headphones, and MP3 SX, which upgrades standard stereo mp3 file to mp3 surround files.

On its 5.5 release, Nullsoft Winamp has included the MP3 Surround format as a part of its integrated MPEG audio decoder (released October 10, 2007).

As of 2 July 2008, with system software v2.40, PlayStation 3 supports MP3 Surround playback.

<doc id="1236502" wikidata="Q10985787" url="?curid=1236502" title="WPXI">
<text>WPXI (channel 11) is a television station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, affiliated with NBC and owned by Cox Media Group. The station&#x27;s offices and studios are located on Evergreen Road in the Summer Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Its transmitter is on Television Hill in the Fineview section of the city, at the site of the station&#x27;s original studio location.

==History==
===As WIIC (1957–1981)===

On September 1, 1957, Pittsburgh&#x27;s second commercial VHF station signed on as WIIC. The station&#x27;s construction permit was originally issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in June 1955, to WIIC Incorporated – a joint venture of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, which owned WWSW radio (970 AM, now WBGG), and Pittsburgh Radio Supply House, the then-owners of WJAS radio (1320 AM). Both radio stations had competed individually for the permit grant along with other applicants. CBS, which was looking to gain its own full-time affiliate in the market, signed a contract with the then-unnamed channel 11 shortly thereafter. Before the &quot;freeze&quot; on television station licenses, the two stations were competing for the channel 10 license originally assigned to Pittsburgh before the FCC reallocated the channels in 1952, with channel 10 going to Altoona; the Hearst Corporation (then-owners of WCAE and eventual owners of WTAE-TV) and two other companies were also applying for the channel 10 license.

Channel 11, however, did not sign on for well over two years after its permit was granted. The primary reason for the delay was on the part of WENS-TV (channel 16, now WINP-TV), whose application for the permit had been denied and later contested the FCC&#x27;s original decision. In the interim, CBS continued to have most of its programs cleared by Westinghouse-owned KDKA-TV (channel 2), at the time Pittsburgh&#x27;s only commercial VHF station. When CBS decided to make KDKA-TV its full-time Pittsburgh affiliate, NBC (which shared time on KDKA-TV with CBS, ABC, and station founder DuMont since its sign-on in 1949) reached a deal to affiliate with WIIC. Also, as a condition of the license grant, WJAS radio had to be sold; NBC wound up purchasing that station in August 1957. The WJAS interests later divested their 50 percent share of WIIC to another local broadcaster.

Bill Cardille signed the station on the air. In addition to Cardille, five other announcers that were with the station when it launched in 1957 include Mal Alberts, Bob Cochran, Ed Conway, Len Johnson and Mark Schaefer. Some of the first original programming to air on WIIC included &quot;Studio Wrestling&quot; and &quot;Chiller Theatre&quot;, both hosted by Cardille. Shortly after its sign-on, WIIC was briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network, sharing the affiliation with KDKA-TV, WTAE-TV, and public television station WQED.

In 1964, WIIC was sold to Cox Enterprises; Cox subsequently traded its share in the then new cable system (today&#x27;s Buckeye Broadband) in Toledo, Ohio, to the &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; parent company Block Communications, which is based in Toledo. The station has been the longest running NBC affiliate under Cox&#x27;s ownership, especially after sister stations WSOC-TV in Charlotte and WSB-TV in Atlanta switched their affiliations to ABC in 1978 and 1980, respectively. In 1970, WIIC made Pittsburgh broadcasting history when Eleanor Schano became the first woman to anchor a newscast solo. Schano also hosted a weekly 30-minute public affairs program called &quot;Face to Face&quot;.

Around 1975, Channel 11 branded itself as &quot;e11even&quot;. Around 1977, WIIC used the &quot;11 Alive&quot; moniker (which had become popularized by fellow NBC affiliate WXIA-TV in Atlanta and WPIX in New York City). WIIC carried the Operation Prime Time package in 1979.

===As WPXI (1981–present)===

On April 20, 1981, the station&#x27;s call sign was changed to WPXI (for &quot;Pittsburgh 11&quot;, with &quot;XI&quot; being the Roman numeral for 11). Although the station has officially never had the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix since adopting the WPXI call sign, the station has on occasion been marketed as &quot;WPXI-TV&quot;. The WIIC calls in Pittsburgh were later used by an unrelated low-power independent station that ran a music video format (that station is currently a Rev&#x27;n affiliate).
WPXI joined the syndicated MGM/UA Premiere Network, with the November 10, 1984, showing of &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;.

WPXI also televised the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot; as the &quot;Love Network&quot; affiliate of the annual fundraiser for the Pittsburgh market, until the Muscular Dystrophy Association decided to move the event from syndication to ABC (and locally to WTAE) as the &quot;MDA Show of Strength&quot; in 2013; the show ended the next year. The local portion of the telethon continued to be hosted by Bill Cardille until 2012.

In 2000, Cox Enterprises purchased WTOV in Steubenville, Ohio, and WJAC-TV in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, from Sunrise Television. Those stations—which are also NBC affiliates—often appear in channel lineups for the same viewers that watch WPXI, either by over-the-air signal or via cable provider, and due to the proximity of the three stations to each other (as well as the common affiliation with NBC), were occasionally marketed together as a result. Cox changed the stations&#x27; on-air appearances to match WPXI&#x27;s look, despite WPXI changing its own look in 2004. WTOV still used WPXI&#x27;s former look until October 2010, and WJAC-TV adopted WPXI&#x27;s current design in October 2011.

Over the Labor Day weekend of 2007, WPXI began relocating from its longtime studios at Television Hill in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Fineview neighborhood after 50 years, to a new studio facility in the city&#x27;s Summer Hill neighborhood near the Parkway North. The station&#x27;s transmitter tower continues to be located in the Fineview neighborhood. WPXI began broadcasting its newscasts from the Summer Hill studio on October 6 beginning with the 6 p.m. newscast. In turn, it also became the first station in the Pittsburgh market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The station was criticized for technical glitches during the initial week of the new system run but worked through the issues and set the pace of technological advances for WTAE and KDKA to follow. With the switch to HD came a new set, created by FX Group and a new graphics package designed by Hothaus Creative.

In mid-October 2008, WPXI, in collaboration with Cox&#x27;s longtime partner Internet Broadcasting, launched a redesigned website. By early November 2008, the websites of all of Cox&#x27;s stations east of the Mississippi River began using the new format pioneered by WPXI; the websites of the company&#x27;s stations west of the Mississippi River followed suit a month later. In 2011, Cox Media Group&#x27;s partnership with Internet Broadcasting was dissolved, and the Cox television stations relaunched their website operations in-house. WPXI&#x27;s and WSOC-TV&#x27;s websites remained under the stewardship of Internet Broadcasting until late January 2012, when they became the last two stations to have redesigned their websites to match the format of the in-house web operations of their sister stations.

With Cox Media Group&#x27;s February 23, 2013, sale of WJAC and WTOV (a sale which also included KFOX-TV in El Paso, Texas, and KRXI and KAME-TV in Reno, Nevada) to the Sinclair Broadcast Group, owners of local Fox affiliate WPGH-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WPMY (which was completed on May 2), WPXI became Cox&#x27;s only NBC-affiliated station until 2019 when the company acquired Northwest Broadcasting stations KYMA-DT in Yuma, Arizona, KIEM-TV in Eureka, California, KPVI-DT in Pocatello, Idaho, and WNBD-LD in Grenada, Mississippi; these four stations were sold in 2022 to Imagicomm Communications, a company affiliated with the cable network INSP, at which time WPXI regained its status as the only Cox-owned NBC affiliate.

WPXI currently uses the number 11 drawn into a circle, which debuted in 1987. The &quot;11&quot; symbol is colored gold, while the box around it is dark blue. WPXI previously used the NBC Peacock in its logo, which was copied by sister stations WTOV and WJAC and is still used by WTOV, but revamped its own look in October 2004. WPXI&#x27;s current look uses the circle 11 logo with a stylized &quot;WPXI&quot; below it.

On September 2, 2013, WPXI expanded its noon news to an hour, becoming Pittsburgh&#x27;s first hour-long noon newscast.

===Sale to Apollo Global Management===
On July 24, 2018, WPXI parent Cox Enterprises announced that it was &quot;exploring strategic options&quot; for Cox Media Group&#x27;s television stations, which the company said could involve &quot;partnering or merging these stations into a larger TV company.&quot; Cox Media Group&#x27;s president, Kim Guthrie, subsequently clarified to trade publication &quot;Radio &amp; Television Business Report&quot; that the company was solely seeking &quot;a merger or partnership&quot; and not an outright sale of the television stations.

In February 2019, it was announced that Apollo Global Management would acquire Cox Media Group and Northwest Broadcasting&#x27;s stations. Although the group planned to operate under the name Terrier Media, it was later announced in June 2019 that Apollo would also acquire Cox&#x27;s radio and advertising businesses, and retain the Cox Media Group name. The sale was completed on December 17, 2019.

==Programming==
===Local programming===
From 1963 to 1983, the station produced and broadcast &quot;Chiller Theater&quot;, a late Saturday evening horror film show hosted by Bill Cardille, or as he was referred to, &quot;Chilly Billy&quot;. The show originally had Cardille as a solo host. In the 1970s, a cast of characters was added, and the setting was changed from a laboratory to a castle. Cardille would introduce the film being shown, as well as perform skits during breaks in the film. Cardille became well known for hosting the show and the shows themselves became part of local yore. The final program aired on January 1, 1984. Cardille remained on-air at WPXI through the early-to-mid-1990s as the weekday morning and noon weather forecaster. Cardille remained in Pittsburgh as midday personality on WJAS radio until the station format changed to talk radio in 2014; Cardille died in 2016.

The show was part of a trend during the 1960s and 1970s for television stations to produce local programming. Local stations often created their own children&#x27;s shows as well. Horror theater shows, such as &quot;Shock Theatre&quot;, hosted by Ghoulardi and &quot;Big Chuck &amp; Little John&quot; in Cleveland, as well as &quot;Chiller Theater&quot;, were not only easy to produce, but popular with the local audience.

From 1966 to 1972, WIIC had a &quot;Bandstand&quot;-type show on Saturday afternoons. &quot;Come Alive&quot; was originally sponsored by Pepsi and hosted by KQV disc jockey Chuck Brinkman. Later, WIXZ DJ Terry Lee would take over as host. The show featured teens dancing to current hit records, a weekly Top 10 countdown and appearances by local bands.

From the earliest days of the station through 1973, WIIC produced a weekly live professional wrestling show. &quot;Studio Wrestling&quot;, independent of the National Wrestling Alliance, which aired on Saturday evenings and drew strong ratings. Mal Alberts was the original host, but Cardille took over after a few years and handled the rest of the show&#x27;s run. It started as a one-hour show, but was then expanded to 90 minutes because of its popularity. The show marked the earliest appearances of Bruno Sammartino, who moved to Pittsburgh from Italy as a teenager and resided in the area until his death in 2018. &quot;Studio Wrestling&quot; was run by Toots Mondt, who co-owned NWA member Capitol Wrestling Corporation (the predecessor to the present-day WWE) with Vince McMahon Sr. McMahon promptly signed Sammartino to the CWC and where Sammartino would eventually become a two-time WWWF Champion for a combined record of 11 years. WIIC/WPXI has not produced its own wrestling program since &quot;Studio Wrestling&quot;, although it has aired various WWF/WWE shows through its affiliation with NBC in the years since.

WIIC also produced a daily afternoon game show, &quot;Give It a Whirl&quot;, from 1965 to 1967. Steve Rizen of KQV radio hosted the show, which had contestants spinning a wheel to determine what prizes they could win. Local musician Dom Trimarkie was part of the show, providing material for the &quot;Mystery Tunes&quot; segment.

In regards to children&#x27;s programming, WIIC produced &quot;Cartoon Colorama&quot;, which aired older cartoons produced in color (hence the name), hosted by Willie the Duck, a hand-puppet with a Donald Duck type of voice who spoke to off-camera announcer Don Riggs (who served as Willie&#x27;s comedy foil) in between the cartoons. The show had been previously hosted by a character called &quot;Captain Jim&quot;, who had hosted one of WIIC&#x27;s best-remembered children&#x27;s programs: &quot;Cap&#x27;n Jim&#x27;s Popeye Club&quot;, built around Popeye cartoons. The Captain was briefly played at the beginning by the little-known Jim Saunders, and from 1959 on by Ted Eckman. The station also aired a local version of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; during the 1960s, which was hosted by By Williams.

From 2022 to 2024, WPXI partnered with Nexstar Media Group on state governmental public affairs programming airing throughout the state, with programming airing on WPXI and (outside of Pittsburgh) on Nexstar owned or operated stations within Pennsylvania. As the Pittsburgh DMA is both the only market in Pennsylvania where Cox owns a station as well as the only market where Nexstar does not own or operate a station, the deal had no overlap between the two companies. Nexstar-produced shows now air on CBS-owned KDKA, sister station to Nexstar&#x27;s WPHL Philadelphia rival, KYW-TV.

===Sports programming===
In 1970, when the Pittsburgh Steelers moved to the American Football Conference after the AFL-NFL merger, channel 11 became the station of record for the team (as NBC held the broadcast rights to AFC games then); this partnership continued through 1997 (after that season, CBS took over the AFC broadcast rights, and most games moved to CBS O&amp;O KDKA-TV; channel 2 had previously served as the default home station from 1962 to 1969). Even though it aired most of the games from the Steelers&#x27; glory years of the 1970s—typically the highest-rated television programs in the market during that time—channel 11 stayed in the ratings basement. Today, Steelers games are shown on WPXI when they are featured on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;; in addition, the station has aired three of its Super Bowl victories (IX, XIII and XLIII) and its appearance in Super Bowl XXX. In 2022, WPXI gained the rights to air Thursday Night Football games involving the Steelers that air on Prime Video, including a Saturday night wild card playoff game in the 2024 season (the first playoff game to air exclusively on Prime Video).

WPXI also aired most Pittsburgh Pirates games that were part of NBC&#x27;s Major League Baseball broadcast contract from its sign-on until 1989; this included the team&#x27;s 1960 and 1971 World Series victories.

In addition, WPXI served as the secondary station for the Pittsburgh Penguins as they had carried games that were part of NBC&#x27;s National Hockey League broadcast contract from the 2005–06 NHL season to the 2020–21 season; this included the team&#x27;s 2009, 2016 and 2017 Stanley Cup championship victories.

===Syndicated programming===
Since its sign-on in 1957, WIIC, and later WPXI, has aired a mix of syndicated first-run shows, off-network reruns, and afternoon movies throughout its history, although by the 1980s the schedule would become less dependent on most of this product in favor of more talk fare and an expanding newscast. WPXI acquired the rights to then-King World (now CBS Media Ventures)-distributed syndicated game shows &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; from then-Westinghouse-owned KDKA-TV in 1987. In the late 1990s, WPXI was known as one of the &quot;Big 3&quot; stations in the Pittsburgh area to air popular tabloid talk shows &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; and &quot;Jenny Jones&quot; in their late morning and afternoon daytime lineup. Today, WPXI&#x27;s syndicated programming focuses on hard-hitting news and lifestyle platforms.

In September 2018, WPXI acquired &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot; from WPGH-TV after going back and forth at its 10 a.m. time slot on the station since its 2009 debut. The show aired at 11 a.m. until its 2022 cancellation and being replaced in the timeslot by the new syndicated talk show &quot;Sherri&quot;, serving as a lead-in to the midday newscast.

==Newscasts==
WPXI broadcasts 42 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, four hours on Saturdays and hours on Sundays).

Despite its early newspaper heritage with the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; (which would later partner with KDKA-TV), channel 11 struggled in the local ratings due to the dominance of KDKA-TV, which unlike channel 11 and WTAE-TV was locally owned by Westinghouse as well as channel 2&#x27;s eight-year head start on the market before channel 11 signed on. WTAE-TV would become competitive with KDKA-TV during the 1970s due to an investment in its news department by owner Hearst Television, leaving WIIC-TV in a distant third place in the ratings behind KDKA-TV and WTAE-TV during much of the decade. This coincided with much of the period where NBC also struggled in the ratings. The station&#x27;s ratings were so bad that Cox was unable to switch the station&#x27;s affiliation to ABC like it did with sister stations WSB-TV and WSOC-TV in 1978, as Hearst Television had developed a solid affiliate relationship with ABC, thus WTAE-TV was one of its strongest affiliates and unwilling to exchange networks. It could also be argued that if not for sports coverage like the Steeler dynasty of the 1970s and the Pirates in the playoffs airing via NBC, WIIC-TV&#x27;s ratings could have even been below PBS member station WQED (during the peak era of locally recorded &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;) and lowly independent WPGH-TV, years before Fox&#x27;s existence.

Following the change in callsigns to WPXI in 1981, Cox began to follow WTAE-TV&#x27;s lead and invest heavily in its news department. Upon adopting its current logo in 1987, WPXI started using the famous &quot;Move Closer to Your World&quot; theme by Al Ham that was popularized by ABC O&amp;O WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, even adopting that station&#x27;s fast-paced video montage (but not the Action News branding, due to it being used by WTAE-TV), eventually commissioning a modernized version of the theme used during the 1990s. The changes, combined with Westinghouse absorbing CBS and standardizing KDKA-TV along the lines of its new CBS O&amp;O sister stations (and subsequent less emphasis on local programming), finally saw WPXI reach parity with KDKA-TV and WTAE-TV during the 1990s. Nowadays in addition to being in a dead heat for number one in local news ratings, WPXI is currently one of NBC&#x27;s strongest major-market affiliates overcoming any lags due to the station&#x27;s delays in signing on in its early years and despite the fluctuating strength of network programming. Over the past decade, Pittsburgh has been a perennially competitive market for local news, with news ratings usually differing by less than a full ratings point.

WPXI was the first station to offer a 5:30 p.m. newscast in Pittsburgh from 1981 to 1984 (titled &quot;5:30 Live&quot;); it was then revived in 1987 with the name &quot;Channel 11 News First Edition&quot;. It was also the first station to offer a 5 p.m. newscast in the early 1990s, titled &quot;Channel 11 News First at 5.&quot; WPXI dropped NBC&#x27;s Saturday morning cartoons in September 1990 in favor of a running a newscast airing from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The success of the weekend morning newscast prompted NBC network officials to extend the &quot;Today&quot; show to weekends. WPXI, however, has since scaled back the length of its weekend morning newscasts. Pittsburgh native Jodi Applegate co-anchored NBC&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Today&quot;, but was never seen locally due to WPXI&#x27;s weekend morning newscasts. WPXI added &quot;Weekend Today&quot; in September 2012. In September 2021, WPXI added a 4 p.m. newscast.

On January 12, 2006, Sinclair Broadcast Group (owner of Fox affiliate WPGH-TV) and WPXI entered into a news share agreement allowing channel 11 to take over production of WPGH&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast. WPXI began producing a 10 p.m. newscast for that station (titled &quot;Channel 11 News on Fox 53 at Ten&quot;) on January 30, 2006, two weeks after WPGH shut down its in-house news department due to corporate cutbacks made by Sinclair at its news-producing stations. All of WPGH&#x27;s news staff, except for sportscaster Alby Oxenreiter, were laid off. The program runs for 45 minutes on Sunday through Friday nights, and for 30 minutes on Saturdays; a sports highlight show titled &quot;Ox on Fox Sports Extra&quot; (hosted by Oxenreiter) fills the remaining 15 minutes of the newscast Sunday through Fridays. As part of WPXI&#x27;s contract with Sinclair, WPGH is permitted to air Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;must-run&quot; programming, but must air them &quot;after&quot; the WPXI-produced newscast with a brief disclaimer stating that the editorials are from Sinclair and not WPXI; as a result, WPGH does not air Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;must-runs&quot;, though it does air other political programming from Sinclair in prime time during election years. WPXI also produces a 6:30p.m. newscast for WPGH, which launched on March 14, 2022.

Since dropping &quot;Move Closer to Your World&quot; in the late 1990s, WPXI is known to commission its own theme music from various composers. It has commissioned &quot;Total Coverage&quot; (its previous package), and after WPXI moved to its new Summer Hill television building, it started using &quot;The Tower V.2&quot;, ending the &quot;NBC Collection&quot; altogether. WPXI dropped &quot;The Tower V.2&quot; in 2014 and replaced it with a new special news theme, which lasted until January 2024.

===Pittsburgh Cable News Channel===
The station went into cable television on January 1, 1994, with the launch of the Pittsburgh Cable News Channel (PCNC). PCNC produced the first 10 p.m. newscast in the Pittsburgh market. The final installment of PCNC&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast aired on January 26, 2006, as WPXI took over production of WPGH-TV&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast. Comcast (Xfinity) announced in early 2020 that it would drop PCNC from its line up, greatly reducing the viewing audience. WPXI added PCNC to its digital subchannel lineup in early March 2023.

===Ratings===
Pittsburgh is one of the most competitive markets in the country for local news and viewers benefit by getting quality newscasts from three strong stations. More recently, however, WPXI has had an increase in most dayparts, although it continues to maintain a tie with KDKA-TV in the market for daytime news, as of the May 2009 Nielsen ratings period. Also during this period, WPXI had in increase during the morning hours and the WPXI-produced 10 p.m. news remained in first place. From 1997 to 1999, WPXI led #1 ahead of WTAE-TV and KDKA-TV in viewership for the 5 p.m. newscast due to lead-in by early fringe talk show, &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; at 4 p.m. As of May 2010, WPXI has a strong lead with viewers in the 5–6 a.m. and 10 p.m. timeslots. However, WPXI had the least-watched newscasts in Pittsburgh at noon, 4, 5, 6, and 11 p.m. (with KDKA-TV being the highest watched during those timeslots, except for WTAE-TV which was the leader at 11 p.m. as of the February 2013 ratings period).

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
WPXI was the first station in Pittsburgh to make use of additional programming on its digital channels. On June 21, 2007, WPXI began carrying programming from NBC Weather Plus on digital subchannel 11.2. The service, branded as WPXI 11 Weather Plus, offered local and national weather information 24 hours a day. Locally, WPXI&#x27;s Scott Harbaugh served as the main meteorologist on the station&#x27;s Weather Plus service.

WPXI added an airwave digital channel on 11.3 on October 15, 2007, when it began an affiliation with Retro Television Network. Sister stations WJAC-TV and WTOV-TV also began offering RTV programming on their subchannels. Following the shutdown of NBC Weather Plus in December 2008, WPXI moved RTV to 11.2 while the 11.3 subchannel went dark. On June 13, 2011, WPXI replaced RTV with competing classic television network Me-TV.

While all three Pittsburgh news stations air news video on its websites with WTAE even airing full newscasts on its website, WPXI was the first station in the Pittsburgh market to have over-the-top content available on a streaming service, having its own dedicated channel on Roku since 2014. If someone within the WPXI viewing area orders a Roku Player, the WPXI News app is automatically installed on the player. The WPXI-Roku partnership is part of a larger partnership between Roku and Cox-owned stations. WPXI was the only station in Pittsburgh with such a service until KDKA-TV launched CBSN Pittsburgh as part of CBS News on March 5, 2020.

On April 15, 2015, WPXI became a charter affiliate of Laff on channel 11.3, bringing 11.3 live again for the first time since NBC Weather Plus shut down.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WPXI shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 48. One of the station&#x27;s last programs it aired on its analog signal was Game 7 of the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals, which saw the Pittsburgh Penguins clinch their third Stanley Cup less than an hour and a half before WPXI shut down its analog signal. WPKD-TV currently operates its digital signal on WPXI&#x27;s former analog position.

===Translators===
* 34 New Castle
* 24 Uniontown

In July 2009, the station applied with the FCC to operate three repeater signals: channel 21 in Derry Township (which was not used and the permit has expired), channel 23 in Uniontown, and channel 33 in New Castle. The signal in Derry Township was expected to cover all of Westmoreland County, while the Uniontown signal could penetrate into the Pittsburgh suburb of McKeesport. The New Castle signal partially goes into Youngstown, Ohio (to which New Castle is much closer despite being part of the Pittsburgh DMA), and serves as a secondary NBC affiliate for the Youngstown television market, which is primarily served by WFMJ-TV (and in some parts with Cleveland NBC affiliate WKYC), while giving the Youngstown market an outlet for MeTV and a secondary outlet for Laff alongside that market&#x27;s primary affiliate WYFX-LD. Digital television receivers display the virtual channels of its main signal and its three repeaters as its former VHF analog channel 11.

<text>The Josette Frank Award is an American children&#x27;s literary award for fiction given annually by the Children&#x27;s Book Committee at Bank Street College of Education. It &quot;honors a book or books of outstanding literary merit in which children or young people deal in a positive and realistic way with difficulties in their world and grow emotionally and morally&quot;.

Gary D. Schmidt, winner of the 2024 Josette Frank Award for his novel &quot;The Labors of Hercules Beal&quot;, wrote in his acceptance letter, &quot;If it can be said that awards such as the Josette Frank award fight for children, then Bank Street has, for many years, fought valiantly for children. You’ve held high standards of artistic excellence AND encouraged writers and illustrators who want to talk about the world that real children inhabit, even if it’s a pretty broken world that fills those pages. Just listing those titles suggests how the award has honored books that are honest accounts, that point to a world that doesn’t always value children and their experience, a world that often wars against them. But these books assert that in that world are children whose lives are mighty and lovely, and that their immediate experience is not always to be determined by the brokenness children find around them every single day. What could possibly be more important in today’s literature than a book that a child could pick up, read, and come away saying, &#x27;I can grow too&#x27;?&quot;

Known as the Children&#x27;s Book Award from 1943 to 1997, it was renamed in honor of Josette Frank, the editor of many anthologies for children and a former Executive Director of the Child Study Association of America. The prize to the author of the book has been provided by the Florence L. Miller Memorial Fund.

The Josette Frank Award is one of several prominent awards that the Children&#x27;s Book Committee gives each year. The Flora Stieglitz Straus Award, established in 1994, is presented to &quot;a distinguished work of nonfiction that serves as an inspiration to young people.&quot; The Claudia Lewis Award, given for the first time in 1998, honors the best poetry book of the year. The Margaret Wise Brown Board Book Award, a biennial award, presented to published or adapted board books, was established in 2023 and honored books published in 2021-2022.

<doc id="1236508" wikidata="Q7954638" url="?curid=1236508" title="WQED (TV)">
<text>WQED (channel 13) is a PBS member television station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Owned by WQED Multimedia, it is sister to public radio station WQED-FM (89.3). The two outlets share studios on Fifth Avenue near the Carnegie Mellon University campus and transmitter facilities near the campus of the University of Pittsburgh, both in the city&#x27;s Oakland section.

Established on April 1, 1954, WQED was the first community-sponsored television station in the U.S. and the country&#x27;s fifth public television station. It was the first station to telecast classes to elementary school classrooms when Pittsburgh launched its Metropolitan School Service in 1955. The station has been the flagship for the shows &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, &quot;Once Upon A Classic&quot;, &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (a co-production with Boston&#x27;s WGBH-TV; filmed in New York City), and &quot;Daniel Tiger&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot; (whose live-action scenes are filmed in Pittsburgh).

==History==

A public television station was the brainchild of Pittsburgh mayor David L. Lawrence, who wanted 12 percent of U.S. TV stations licensed for non-commercial educational use. Despite the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) putting an indefinite freeze on new TV station licenses (due to the number of applications on file), the commission granted Lawrence a license if he could raise money to equip and operate the station. Lawrence, a friend of President Harry S. Truman, recruited Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company attorney Leland Hazard to help get the station off the ground.
Its greatest obstacle was Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric Corporation, owners of radio station KDKA. Westinghouse wanted a TV station in the city to compete with the DuMont-owned-and-operated WDTV (which had a &quot;de facto&quot; monopoly in the nation&#x27;s sixth-largest television market), and was impatient with the freeze on new licenses. Although the corporation launched WBZ-TV in Boston in 1948 and purchased Philadelphia&#x27;s WPTZ-TV (now KYW-TV) in 1952, it was unable to secure a TV-station license in its home market. When the freeze was lifted in 1952, the FCC granted station licenses to smaller cities (such as Steubenville and Youngstown, Ohio; Wheeling and Clarksburg, West Virginia, and Johnstown, Altoona and Erie, Pennsylvania) before granting more licenses in Pittsburgh. All those cities shared the VHF band with Pittsburgh, and only Youngstown would end up as a UHF island.
Westinghouse presented a compromise to the FCC, offering to share its proposed KDKA-TV with WQED on channel 13. Hazard found this unacceptable, and asked Westinghouse CEO Gwilym Price if he should give up his quest for public television. Price said that Hazard should keep fighting, promising Westinghouse support for WQED. Westinghouse donated the tower it had purchased for the channel 13 license, enabling WQED to begin operations on April 1, 1954. The station&#x27;s call letters are from the Latin phrase &quot;quod erat demonstrandum&quot; (&quot;what was demonstrated&quot;), commonly used in mathematics.

Westinghouse soon had its Pittsburgh TV station. Knowing that DuMont needed WDTV&#x27;s cash flow to get its programming cleared in larger markets and a short-term cash infusion after DuMont investor Paramount Pictures vetoed a merger between DuMont and ABC, Westinghouse offered DuMont $10 million for WDTV in January 1955. It changed the station&#x27;s call sign to KDKA-TV, making it a sister station of KDKA radio. DuMont, unable to obtain clearance in larger markets, was out of business by the end of 1956. Although KDKA-TV is now owned by Westinghouse successor Paramount Global, the station retains a close relationship with WQED.

WQED briefly shared channel 13 with WENS-TV in 1955, after a storm damaged the WENS-TV tower in Reserve Township, until the WENS-TV tower was repaired. WQED acquired the station and renamed it WQEX in 1959, using the construction permit it had acquired for channel 22 to launch WQEX on channel 16. The Commercial Radio Institute acquired the WENS-TV permit for channel 22, launching WPTT (now WPNT) in 1978.

The station was briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network during the late 1950s, sharing the affiliation with KDKA-TV, WTAE-TV, and WIIC-TV (now WPXI). From sign-on until its replacement by PBS in 1970, WQED was a National Educational Television member station.

During its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, WQED supplied programming to PBS. For 15 years, WQED produced the &quot;National Geographic&quot; specials for the National Geographic Society. The programs won several Emmy and other awards, including Peabody Awards.

Actor Michael Keaton, who worked behind the scenes on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, went on to international fame. During its heyday, WQED supported a post-production office and editing facility in Los Angeles. Known as QED/West, the satellite edited much of WQED&#x27;s national programming.

During the early 1990s, WQED faltered, as did many other PBS stations across the country, as the rapidly-changing media landscape shifted. The downturn was exacerbated by a scandal in which top executives were discovered to have been augmenting their income without informing the board of directors. The period was chronicled in Jerold Starr&#x27;s 2000 book, &quot;Air Wars: The Fight to Reclaim Public Broadcasting&quot;.

Problems continued with a failed attempt to sell WQED&#x27;s auxiliary station, WQEX, in 1999. In 2002, WQEX&#x27;s non-commercial educational status was removed; the station moved to a shopping format, first with America&#x27;s Store and later with ShopNBC; that in effect made WQEX a for-profit arm to generate revenue for channel 13. In November 2010, WQED agreed to sell WQEX to Ion Media Networks for $3 million. The sale was completed (after FCC approval) on May 2, 2011, when the station&#x27;s call sign changed from WQEX to WINP-TV. WQED received $9.9 million in a 2017 spectrum auction, and would use the proceeds to pay down debt the station has carried since the 1990s.

The Fred Rogers Studio, where Fred Rogers recorded his iconic television series &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, is featured in the film &quot;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood&quot; with Tom Hanks playing Rogers. The cast and crew shot at the WQED headquarters throughout October 2018.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
On January 5, 2009, WQED launched Create on 13.2, replacing the standard-definition simulcast of WQED&#x27;s main channel.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WQED shut down its analog signal on VHF channel 13 on June 12, 2009, when full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts by federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 38 to VHF channel 13. WQED was the only full-power station in the Pittsburgh market to move its digital signal back to its analog-era channel. Former sister station WINP-TV took over WQED&#x27;s former digital channel 38, broadcasting on virtual channel 16.1. 

On June 27, 2019, at 8 a.m. during the FCC repack, WQED relocated from channel 13 to channel 4.

<text>George Papassavas (born 28 January 1924) is a Greek painter who has traveled extensively throughout Latin America.

Born in Stavroupoli, Greece, Papassavas against his father&#x27;s will taught himself the techniques of the classical artist at a young age. At the age of 17, he was put into exile and forced into labor by the invading Bulgarian army. After his return to Greece, he began formal study at the Athens School of Fine Arts. In 1955, after being enchanted by the book &quot;Brazil: A Land of the Future&quot; by Stefan Zweig, Papassavas journeyed with his wife to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he studied under Candido Portinari. In search of artistic inspiration, Papassavas made several trips throughout South America observing both its people and natural environment. At the end of 1967, he moved to United States and continued his development in art at Harvard University.

The end of 1974, Papassavas moved to Florida, where he became a U.S. citizen in 1978. To this day he still paints. He and his wife currently divide their time between Florida, Maine, and Massachusetts. He has numerous one man and group shows throughout Europe, South America, and the United States. His work is included in museums, libraries, and both private and corporate collections. His art has also been featured in many newspapers, magazines, and books.

Bold outlines and warm colors characterize his dominate style in painting.

<doc id="1236513" wikidata="Q740146" url="?curid=1236513" title="Piper PA-15 Vagabond">
<text>The Piper PA-15 Vagabond and PA-17 Vagabond are both two-seat, high-wing, conventional gear light aircraft that were designed for personal use and for flight training and built by Piper Aircraft starting in 1948.

==Development==
The PA-15 was the first post-World War II Piper aircraft design. It utilized much of the same production tooling that created the famous Piper Cub, as well as many of the Cub structural components (tail surfaces, landing gear, most of the wing parts). The Vagabond has a wing that is one bay shorter ( versus ) than that on the Cub, which led to the unofficial term describing the type: &quot;Short Wing Piper&quot;. This allowed the aircraft to be built with minimal material, design and development costs, and is credited with saving Piper Aircraft from bankruptcy after the war.

The prototype PA-15 made its first flight on 3 November 1947, with deliveries of production aircraft beginning in January 1948.
Vagabonds used a new fuselage with side-by-side seating for two instead of the Cub&#x27;s tandem seating.

The PA-17 Vagabond version features dual controls, enabling it to be used for pilot training. It has a bungee cord shock-absorbed landing gear (solid gear on the PA-15), and a Continental A-65 engine. There was a small increase in climb rate and useful load over the PA-15, despite an increase in empty weight.

The Vagabond was followed by the Piper PA-16 Clipper, which is essentially a Vagabond with a longer fuselage, Lycoming O-235 engine of , extra wing fuel tank, and four seats. The Pacer, Tri-Pacer and Colt are all variations of the Vagabond design and thus all Short Wing Pipers.

==Operational history==

In March 2018 there were still 167 PA-15s and 101 PA-17s registered in the USA.

There were 13 PA-15s and 12 PA-17s registered in Canada in March 2018.

==Variants==

;PA-15 Vagabond
:Side-by-side two-seater powered by one Lycoming O-145 engine. 387 built, plus one converted from a PA-17.
;PA-17 Vagabond
:Also known as the Vagabond Trainer a variant of the PA-15 with dual-controls, shock-cord suspension and powered by one Continental A-65-8 engine. 214 built.

<doc id="1236517" wikidata="Q1263250" url="?curid=1236517" title="Hyam Maccoby">
<text>Hyam Maccoby (, 1924–2004) was a Jewish-British scholar and dramatist specialising in the study of the Jewish and Christian religious traditions. He was known for his theories of the historical Jesus and the origins of Christianity.

==Life== 
Maccoby was a Domus Exhibitioner in Classics at Balliol College, Oxford University. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Signals. Maccoby was librarian of Leo Baeck College in London. In retirement he moved to Leeds, where he held an academic position at the Centre for Jewish Studies, University of Leeds.

==Theories of historical Jesus==
Maccoby considered the portrayal of Jesus given in the canonical gospels and the history of the early Church from the Book of Acts to be heavily distorted and full of later mythical traditions, but he claimed that a fairly accurate historical account of the life of Jesus could still be reconstructed from them.

Maccoby argued that the real Jesus was not a rebel against the Jewish law but instead a Jewish Messianic claimant whose life and teaching were within the mainstream of 1st-century Judaism. He believed that Jesus was executed as a rebel against the Roman occupation of Judaea. However, he did not claim that Jesus was the leader of an actual armed rebellion. Rather, Jesus and his followers, inspired by the Tanakh or Old Testament prophetic writings, were expecting a supernatural divine intervention that would end Roman rule, restore the Davidic Kingdom with Jesus as the divinely anointed monarch and inaugurate the Messianic age of peace and prosperity for the whole world. Those expectations were not fulfilled, and Jesus was arrested and executed by the Romans.

According to Maccoby, Barabbas, from the Aramaic Bar Abba, &quot;Son of the Father&quot;, originally referred to Jesus himself, who was called thus from his custom of addressing the Father as &quot;Abba&quot;, &quot;Father&quot;, in his prayers, or else as a form of the rabbinic honorific &quot;Berab&quot;.

Many of the disciples of Jesus did not lose their hopes; they believed that Jesus would soon be miraculously resurrected by God, and continued to live in expectation of his second coming. Their fellowship continued to exist in Jerusalem as a strictly-orthodox Jewish sect under the leadership of James the Just.

In 2012, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach wrote &quot;Kosher Jesus&quot; in which he drew on past work by Maccoby.

==Theories on Paul==
According to Maccoby, the founding of Christianity as a religion separate from Judaism was entirely the work of Paul of Tarsus. In this Maccoby&#x27;s view is largely based on that of Heinrich Graetz.

Maccoby claimed that Paul was a Hellenized Jewish convert or perhaps even a Gentile, from a background in which he had been exposed to the influence of Gnosticism and the pagan mystery religions, such as the Attis cult, a myth involving a life-death-rebirth deity. The mystery religions, according to Maccoby, were the dominant religious forms in the Hellenistic world of that age and strongly influenced Paul&#x27;s mythological psychology. Maccoby partially derived his theory from fragments of the writings of opponents of Ebionites, particularly the treatise on &quot;Heresies&quot; by Epiphanius of Salamis.

Maccoby considered Paul&#x27;s claims to an orthodox Pharisaic Jewish education to be false and asserted that while many of Paul&#x27;s writings sound authentic to the uninitiated, they actually betray an ignorance of the original Hebrew scripture and the subtleties of Jewish Law. Maccoby claimed that an examination of the New Testament indicates that Paul knew no Hebrew at all and relied entirely on Greek texts that no actual Pharisee would ever use because they were not properly translated from the Hebrew originals.

According to Maccoby, Paul fused the historical story of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion with elements of contemporary mystery religions and Gnosticism and developed such new non-Judaic mythic ideas as the Trinity and the Last Supper. Paul also made an attempt to find prophetic justification for his newly created myth in the Old Testament. Paul came to present Jesus as a dying and rising saviour deity similar to those from the Hellenistic mystery cults, fused with the historical pedigree of Judaism, and thus gave birth to a powerful new myth whose preaching gained him a large following. As the Jerusalem group of the original disciples of Jesus gradually became aware of Paul&#x27;s teachings, bitter hostility ensued between them.

Maccoby interpreted certain New Testament passages (such as Paul&#x27;s account of his quarrel with Peter in the Incident at Antioch) as remnants of authentic accounts of that hostility. However, the Jewish Rebellion of 66–70 soon brought a violent end to the Jerusalem sect, and the Gentile Church that was founded by Paul emerged as the winner by default. Maccoby viewed the Book of Acts as a later attempt by the Pauline Church to present the relations between Paul and the Jerusalem disciples as harmonious and the Pauline Church as legitimised by the chain of apostolic succession reaching back to the original disciples of Jesus. Maccoby also conjectured that the Jewish-Christian sect of Ebionites may have been an authentic offshoot of the original Jerusalem community.

===Criticisms===
John Gager of Princeton University reviewed &quot;The Mythmaker&quot; (1986) in the &quot;Jewish Quarterly Review&quot; (1988), describing part of Maccoby&#x27;s thesis as &quot;perverse misreading&quot; and concluded &quot;Thus I must conclude that Maccoby&#x27;s book is not good history, not even history at all.&quot; Skarsaune (2002), referencing Maccoby&#x27;s work and the theory that Paul represents a Christianity totally different from that of the early community in Jerusalem, writes that &quot;Acts provides no evidence to substantiate this theory.&quot; James D. G. Dunn (2006) describes Maccoby&#x27;s revival of Graetz&#x27; accusations that Paul was a Gentile as &quot;a regrettable reversion to older polemics&quot;. The continuity with Graetz is also noted by Langton (2009), who contrasts Maccoby&#x27;s approach with adherents of a &quot;building bridges&quot; view, such as Isaac Mayer Wise, Joseph Krauskopf, and Claude Montefiore, even if they shared some details of the polemic critique of Paul.

==&quot;The Disputation&quot;==
Maccoby&#x27;s play &quot;The Disputation&quot; is a re-enactment of the Disputation of Barcelona, a dramatic confrontation between the Spanish Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, better known as Nachmanides, and a Spanish convert from Judaism to Christianity, Pablo Christiani, before King James I of Aragon in 1263. Much of the play is drawn from Nachmanides&#x27;s account of the disputation, and much is inferred from the king&#x27;s affection for the rabbi and considerable generosity to him after Christiani&#x27;s formal victory. The play centres on King James, who is portrayed as a complex troubled soul who comes to accept the rabbi&#x27;s ideas. The play has been widely performed and was broadcast by Channel 4 starring Christopher Lee and Toyah Willcox.

<doc id="1236519" wikidata="Q7954278" url="?curid=1236519" title="WPGH-TV">
<text>WPGH-TV (channel 53) is a television station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, affiliated with the Fox network. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside dual CW and MyNetworkTV affiliate WPNT (channel 22). The two stations share studios on Ivory Avenue in the city&#x27;s Summer Hill neighborhood, where WPGH-TV&#x27;s transmitter is also located.

Channel 53 was the second TV channel to be activated in Pittsburgh, but the history of this station is discontinuous. It first emerged as WKJF-TV with commercial programming beginning on August 1, 1953. Owned by Agnes Jane Reeves Greer, it had second-choice rights to NBC programming and operated from a site shared with sister FM station WKJF-FM. Like many other ultra high frequency (UHF) TV stations, it struggled economically because not all homes could receive it and its signal was comparatively weak. It left the air on July 2, 1954, but the permit remained alive; the call sign was changed to WAND-TV in 1961, and the antenna was not dismantled until 1962. After federal authorities pushed holders of inactive UHF TV permits to build them, sell them, or forfeit them, Daniel H. Overmyer acquired the station in 1965 as part of a projected independent station group. He was unable to build what he called WECO-TV because of unexpected problems in transmitter site construction and financing difficulties. The independent stations were sold to U.S. Communications, a unit of American Viscose Corporation, which completed construction and put WPGH-TV on the air on February 1, 1969. U.S. Communications struggled with all of Overmyer&#x27;s permits amid a soft advertising market; WPGH-TV was the third to leave the air on August 16, 1971, and was placed into bankruptcy.

Leon Crosby of San Francisco led an investor consortium named Pittsburgh Telecasting, which bought WPGH-TV out of bankruptcy and returned it to the air, this time for good, on January 14, 1974. Under Crosby and the successive ownerships of the Meredith Corporation, Lorimar-Telepictures, and Renaissance Broadcasting, WPGH-TV endured as Pittsburgh&#x27;s leading independent outlet. In 1986, it affiliated with Fox at the new network&#x27;s launch; the Fox affiliation improved the station&#x27;s ratings and advertising sales.

Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired WPGH-TV in 1991, selling the underperforming channel 22 (then WPTT) to Edwin Edwards in a move that in reality created a local marketing agreement. WPGH-TV started a 10 p.m. newscast, the &quot;Fox 53 Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, in January 1997. It was the first such newscast on a broadcast station in the Pittsburgh market, but it was a ratings underperformer relative to similar newscasts in similarly sized markets. In 2003, Sinclair converted it to its News Central hybrid format, which led to ratings declines. The standalone news department was dissolved in January 2006, and WPGH-TV began airing newscasts produced by Pittsburgh NBC affiliate WPXI (channel 11).

==WKJF-TV==
When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened up applications for new TV stations after a years-long freeze, in 1952, it allocated three commercial ultra high frequency (UHF) TV channels to the city. The only applicant for channel 53 was Agnes Jane Reeves Greer, owner of WKJF-FM, the city&#x27;s only standalone FM radio station. The FCC awarded permits for the other two UHF channels, 16 and 47, in December 1952; it deferred action on the channel 53 application until Reeves supplied &quot;further information&quot;, granting it on January 8, 1953. Two executives from Pittsburgh&#x27;s only operating TV station, WDTV, left to take up posts with the new WKJF-TV. Officials expected to be on the air within months based on a prior equipment order. The planned spring date was scrapped when a strike at General Electric delayed fabrication of the antenna, to be fastened to WKJF&#x27;s tower on Mount Washington. It arrived in July, but a dispute over union jurisdiction held up completion of the job.

On July 11, 1953, WKJF-TV put out its first test picture; it was on for five minutes and still elicited a call from a viewer. A regular schedule of test patterns followed starting on July 14. Days before launching, the station finally secured network programming in the form of a secondary affiliation with NBC. WDTV continued to enjoy right of first refusal to telecast NBC programs in Pittsburgh, so WKJF-TV would only get those programs not aired by channel 2. On July 28, the station initiated its first test programs beyond a pattern. From studios on Grandview Avenue, WKJF-TV began airing regular programming on August 1, 1953. At the end of August, after an AT&amp;T network loop was completed to the Mount Washington facility, the first NBC shows appeared on the station. In at least one instance, the station also carried a DuMont Television Network program; WDTV passed over DuMont&#x27;s &quot;Boxing from Eastern Parkway Arena&quot; to carry &quot;Studio One&quot;, so WKJF-TV picked it up.

WKJF-TV was one of two UHF stations to start in Pittsburgh in 1953, the other being WENS on channel 16, which operated at much higher power. Further, UHF stations performed poorly in rougher terrain. Though Pittsburgh had only one pre-freeze and very high frequency station, WDTV on channel 2, much of the city could receive a second VHF station, WJAC-TV on channel 6. These stations could be received by any set, unlike WENS and WKJF-TV, which required converters to view on many VHF-only sets. On July 2, 1954, the station left the air indefinitely, expressing hope of returning if Congress did something to alleviate the plight of UHF stations; it lost $1 million in its operational history. WENS remained on air but struggled to get sponsors despite carrying popular network shows.

A Cleveland mail-order distributor expressed interest in buying WKJF-TV in 1955; he would have renamed the station WDAV and run it for the benefit of disabled veterans. The deal never came to fruition as the owners waited for the UHF situation to change. Rumors circulated that the group putting together Pittsburgh&#x27;s new VHF station on channel 11 was interested in the property. The call sign on the channel 53 permit was changed from WKJF-TV to WAND-TV on March 13, 1961; the WAND letters had belonged to a Reeves-owned station in Canton, Ohio. The antenna was dismantled in 1962 and replaced with a new FM antenna for the co-located radio station; the former television facility was leased to another tenant.

==Overmyer–U.S. Communications era==
===A construction project undermined===
In November 1964, the FCC told 29 permittees of inactive UHF stations, including WAND-TV, that they faced losing their permits unless action was taken to put them back into service. Faced with the pressing FCC action, in February 1965, Reeves Greer agreed to sell to the New York–based Overmyer Communications Corporation, owned by Daniel H. Overmyer. The purchase presented a complication for Overmyer, as it was the eighth station he was attempting to acquire and the ownership limit was seven stations. The $28,000 transaction did not include any physical facilities. Overmyer, as well as a group attempting to reactivate WENS, were encouraged not only by the FCC&#x27;s action but by the All-Channel Receiver Act making all new sets UHF-compatible. The FCC denied Overmyer&#x27;s petition to waive the ownership rule and returned the original filing as unacceptable. It was refiled and approved by the FCC in July.

On November 30, 1965, WAND-TV became WECO-TV, one of four stations named for Daniel Overmyer&#x27;s children—in this case, Elizabeth C. Overmyer. Overmyer had opted not to lease any facilities from WKJF. By March 1966, Overmyer was preparing to put the station on the air for the fall television season as Pittsburgh&#x27;s first independent station, with a mix of syndicated shows and network programs preempted by the local affiliates. Even before signing on, the station acquired mobile video tape recording equipment. Overmyer was still promising this in May, along with a series of 22 new warehouses to be located in the Pittsburgh area.

Soon after, Overmyer&#x27;s quest to build WECO-TV hit a series of snags. The station was on target to launch in September when crews erecting its tower found that the anchor points for two of its three guy wires were over abandoned mine shafts, and a third such tunnel was also found. This forced a change of site for the tower and delayed the prospective launch date to June 1967. The delay prevented WECO-TV from being part of its owner&#x27;s planned Overmyer Network, which went on the air as the United Network on May 1, 1967. Its lone offering, &quot;The Las Vegas Show&quot;, aired on WIIC-TV.

===Sale to AVC===
Needing financing to finish construction of WPGH-TV and the other station permits he held nationwide, Overmyer agreed on March 28, 1967, to sell 80-percent majority control of his construction permits to the American Viscose Corporation (AVC). One partner in the investment firm facilitating the sale with Overmyer was a stockholder in WPHL-TV, an existing UHF station in Philadelphia; another partner was appointed to the AVC board of directors after the sale. AVC arranged to merge the Overmyer permits with WPHL&#x27;s parent company to form U.S. Communications Corporation on June 8, 1967, giving the combined company six television stations in the top 50 markets. The FCC approved the sale on December 8, 1967, waiving a proposed rule in place since 1965 that sought to limit television station ownership within the top 50 markets, a practice the FCC had employed before in similar transactions.

Days after the deal was approved, Rep. Harley O. Staggers, chairman of the House Investigations Subcommittee, summoned all FCC members to testify over the decision not to hold hearings. FCC chairman Rosel H. Hyde testified that if a hearing had been ordered, the sale would have been abandoned. Hyde stated, &quot;I believe that the possibility of refinancing the UHF stations would have failed had we designated the matter for hearing&quot; and that any hearing &quot;...might very well have defeated this effort to salvage a sinking enterprise&quot;. Hyde concluded Overmyer&#x27;s application was sufficient for approval&quot; and agreed with commissioner Kenneth A. Cox that the true nature of the transaction was to raise funds to save the warehouse business. Cox criticized the submission of out-of-pocket expenses and the loan and option agreement in the transaction, claiming it violated an FCC policy by providing a profit.

When the deal closed on January 15, 1968, Overmyer received the second $1.5 million portion of the total $3 million agreed to in the loan contract. AVC was an investment company with no experience in television broadcasting and thus only provided financing for U.S. Communications, while WPHL was used for leadership: two WPHL executives became part of U.S.&#x27;s management team. Overmyer&#x27;s role was limited to only his 20-percent stock in the Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Houston permits, with no managerial oversight; U.S. also included a provision that could compel Overmyer to divest his 20-percent interest and an option to purchase it between January 16, 1971, and January 15, 1972. The contract limited the highest purchase price to $3 million, the same amount AVC had loaned to Overmyer; the loan was secured by second mortgages on twenty-three of Overmyer&#x27;s warehouse properties and his 20 percent interest in the TV stations. U.S. never executed its option to buy the stock, and Overmyer repaid the $3 million loan.

===Second on-air stint (1969–1971)===
After the sale to AVC, planning moved forward in Pittsburgh. By July 1968, the firm was still scouting a site for channel 53, which would have a far more powerful signal than the old WKJF-TV. The station set up its studios, offices, and transmitter at 750 Ivory Avenue in the North Hills area; the Ivory facility had previously belonged to WENS. The Pittsburgh Ad Club held a contest to select new call letters to replace WECO-TV, taking the call sign WPGH on December 7. 

WPGH-TV made its on-air debut on February 1, 1969—the first broadcast from channel 53 in nearly 15 years. Programs included a local version of &quot;Bozo the Clown&quot;; &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and the &quot;CBS Sunday Night News&quot;, which the local affiliates did not or were about to cease airing; syndicated sports heretofore unavailable in Pittsburgh; and daily movies. Local programming included Duquesne Dukes men&#x27;s basketball; Pittsburgh Penguins hockey; and an interview show, &quot;Pittsburgh Now&quot;.

U.S. Communications struggled with the station permits it had acquired from Overmyer and built out. In July 1970, WPGH-TV cut back its broadcasting day to start at noon on weekdays, 3 p.m. on Saturdays, and 1 p.m. on Sundays. The company&#x27;s woes became more acutely felt in 1971. On March 31, due to financial problems, the firm shut down its stations in San Francisco (KEMO-TV) and Atlanta (WATL). On August 5, 1971, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that U.S. Communications had asked the FCC for permission to take WPGH-TV and WXIX-TV in Cincinnati off the air. The two stations, however, got a reprieve because they had instead attracted potential buyers. In the case of WPGH-TV, the reprieve was short-lived. On the afternoon of August 16, 1971, U.S. Communications informed the 48 employees of channel 53 that the station would cease broadcasting at 6 p.m., with the entire staff being laid off.

==Crosby and Meredith ownership==
AVC began liquidating the U.S. Communications stations. With the February 1972 sale of WPHL-TV, the only station never threatened with closure, WPGH-TV became the last unsold station. It was instead assigned to a liquidating receiver. A Black-led group, Aquarius Broadcasting, investigated the purchase, but Leon Crosby emerged the winner in a November 1972 bankruptcy court hearing. Crosby, who also bought KEMO-TV in San Francisco from AVC, promised to program WPGH-TV as an independent station with a mix of movies, reruns, children&#x27;s shows, and sports, as well as local program concepts that had been successful in San Francisco such as a Black variety show. Crosby and his company, Pittsburgh Telecasting, spent most of 1973 awaiting FCC approval; during that time, a tilt in the antenna was identified as a possible cause of signal reception issues in some areas. The commission granted the purchase on December 12, 1973. To get the station back into operating condition, rotting carpets had to be removed from the studio. WPGH-TV returned to the air on January 14, 1974. Like its prior incarnation, it picked up preempted network programs; this time, it added some morning programming from the Christian Broadcasting Network.

The Meredith Corporation purchased WPGH-TV for $12.2 million in 1978. It was the company&#x27;s first UHF independent station and second total after KPHO-TV in Phoenix. That same year, Pittsburgh gained a second independent in the form of WPTT-TV (channel 22), started by the Baltimore-based Commercial Radio Institute (predecessor to Sinclair Broadcast Group). Though the new UHF outlet initially eroded WPGH-TV&#x27;s ratings, channel 53 easily beat the comparatively neglected WPTT-TV in the ratings, and when David D. Smith became its general manager in 1984, he readily conceded that even a revived WPTT would be &quot;the fifth station in this market&quot;. WPGH-TV responded by becoming an aggressive buyer of programming including shows and movies, pushing costs up. In Meredith&#x27;s final months of ownership, the station agreed to join the new Fox network when it started providing programming in October 1986. By this time, it was well-regarded in the industry.

==Lorimar-Telepictures and Renaissance Broadcasting ownership==

In July 1986, the Meredith Corporation agreed to sell WPGH-TV to Lorimar-Telepictures for $35 million. At the time, Lorimar—a production powerhouse responsible for shows like &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, and &quot;The Waltons&quot;—was breaking rapidly into station ownership with three stations owned and in the process of buying WPGH and eight other stations, including WTTV, an independent station serving the Indianapolis market. Meredith did not have WPGH-TV on the market, but the deal made sense; Pittsburgh was not the kind of growth market Meredith was seeking, while Lorimar found in the city an area that was undervalued nationally. In the months following the purchase&#x27;s announcement, the independent TV station market soured; a number of stations sought bankruptcy protection, including WTTV, which Lorimar stopped pursuing. The purchase price was cut to $21.25 million by the time the deal closed in January 1987. Less than six months later, Lorimar-Telepictures decided to reorganize as a production company solely and divest all its television stations. The small-market holdings were spun off in a management buyout, while Lorimar gave itself 24 months to sell WPGH-TV.

Renaissance Broadcasting, a company formed by Michael Finkelstein, agreed to purchase WPGH-TV in August 1988 for $30 million. Finkelstein was a stakeholder in Odyssey Partners and transferred its two independent stations—WDZL in Miami and WTXX in Connecticut—to the new business. WDZL and WTXX had similar programming philosophies. The new owners took control in January 1989. During Renaissance ownership, the station benefited from Fox&#x27;s surging fortunes as a network and from a far more aggressive approach than that taken under former owners. The station rebranded as &quot;Fox 53&quot; and increased its spending on advertising, rebuilt its afternoon lineup to serve the unserved children&#x27;s market, and earned notice as an increasing competitor to the traditional network affiliates.

==Sinclair ownership==
===A controversial purchase and sale===
In January 1991, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced it would purchase WPGH-TV from Renaissance for $55 million. Sinclair already owned WPTT-TV, which it had to put up for sale. Speculation swirled that WPTT would switch to the Home Shopping Network (HSN). The buyer for channel 22 was Edwin Edwards, WPTT&#x27;s station manager and a Black man. For Sinclair, the deal was a trade-up. WPTT-TV had never been a ratings success, and WPGH-TV was closer to Sinclair&#x27;s cluster of Fox affiliates that included stations WBFF-TV in Baltimore and WTTE in Columbus, Ohio. There was a marked difference in financial performance between first-tier and second-tier independent stations, and cost-cutting was seen as useful to WPTT-TV, which had lost $26 million in its 14-year history.

Under the deal, Commercial Radio Institute, the Sinclair subsidiary that had owned WPTT-TV, held $1 million in Edwards&#x27;s debt as a convertible debenture and received a tax certificate for selling the station to a minority. The deal as originally structured permitted Sinclair to convert that debenture into an 80-percent ownership interest. Mark I. Baseman, a Pittsburgh attorney, filed an objection to the two deals in March, believing the sales gave Sinclair too much influence over WPTT-TV and represented an impermissible duopoly. Baseman also objected to the switch of WPTT-TV to home shopping, which eliminated competition for WPGH-TV. Baseman later disclosed the objection was filed on behalf of a client, which was only revealed in January 1992 as ABRY Communications. ABRY owned WNUV in Baltimore, a competitor to Sinclair&#x27;s WBFF-TV, and fretted that Sinclair was using its buying power in Pittsburgh to force syndicators to place their shows on WBFF-TV in Baltimore lest they be shut out altogether in Pittsburgh.

The FCC approved the WPGH-TV and WPTT-TV sales in June 1991, and when they closed, on August 30, WPTT switched to HSN on a full-time basis. Threatened by cable systems seeking to drop the all-HSN WPTT, WPGH and Sinclair agreed to purchase and program nine hours a day of airtime. The operating arrangement attracted FCC scrutiny, and litigation resulted from the double transaction.

===Starting a news operation===
Sinclair began planning in early 1996 to launch a 10 p.m. newscast for WPGH the next year. Pittsburgh, compared to some markets, had little history of 10 p.m. local news. When WTAE-TV signed on in 1958, it offered a newscast at 10:30 p.m., which was short-lived. Through the 1980s, WPGH-TV aired the &quot;Independent Network News&quot; with local cut-ins. In 1990, when Sinclair still owned WPTT-TV and was setting up news operations for its Baltimore and Columbus stations, it proposed launching a 10 p.m. newscast for which production would have been outsourced to a third party. In 1994, WPXI-TV started the Pittsburgh Cable News Channel (PCNC), a local cable service which offered a live 10 p.m. newscast. The news director, David Janecek, came from Sinclair&#x27;s WLFL in Raleigh, North Carolina, a Fox affiliate with a 10 p.m. newscast. Janecek hired Carolyn Clifford, with whom he had worked in Raleigh, and John Huck, a former Headline News anchor. Most of the news team came from outside the market, with the notable exception of sports anchor Alby Oxenreiter, who joined from WTAE. On weekends, Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle presented the sports. To accommodate the news department, the Ivory Avenue facility was extensively remodeled with the addition of a new three-story building to help house the 40 full-time and 10 part-time employees added in the expansion—a total investment of $3 million. The station needed to mesh the younger target viewer profile of Fox network programming with the older demographic of Pittsburgh TV viewers.

The &quot;Fox 53 Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; debuted on January 26, 1997, after Fox&#x27;s presentation of Super Bowl XXXI. The program had a slow start; though it quickly put behind technical glitches that pockmarked its first showing, the newscast was seen as a ratings underperformer with a share of just 3 percent in the 10 p.m. hour. In the November 1997 sweeps, it attracted fewer viewers than the episodes of &quot;Coach&quot; the station had been airing prior to launching the newscast.

Sinclair installed a new regional manager, Stu Powell, to oversee WPGH, WPTT, and other stations in November 1997. Powell had been the general manager at WXIX-TV in Cincinnati when it launched 10 p.m. news in 1993, finding ratings success. The next year, Clifford was replaced with Sheila Hyland, previously of WTAE. The quality of the newscast was seen to have improved, and it extended to an hour in November 1998. The expanded newscast brought with it several new reporters. In 2001, the market gained a third 10 p.m. newscast on UPN affiliate WNPA, produced by KDKA-TV. However, Pittsburgh&#x27;s appetite for news in that time slot continued to trail the national average. Ratings stalled, and while WPGH-TV led the pack at 5 percent, the total market share of WPGH and its competition was 9 percent where the leading early local newscasts in Sacramento, St. Louis, and Portland, Oregon—all similarly-sized TV markets—attracted that many viewers or more. News director John Poister believed an additional newscast would bolster the station&#x27;s reputation, but Sinclair had no expansion plans.

===News Central===
Starting May 28, 2003, Sinclair converted WPGH-TV&#x27;s news department into a hybrid operation utilizing the services of News Central, the company&#x27;s national news and weather service operating from its headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland. The 10 p.m. newscast now combined local news segments, reported locally and presented by Hyland from Pittsburgh, with national and international news segments from News Central. Ten employees were fired, including weeknight meteorologist Matt Morano, and a new set was introduced to match the News Central set. The national weather center had already been supplying weekend weather reports to WPGH-TV since January.

Where WPGH&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast had commanded 7 percent of the viewership at that time in February 2003, the station&#x27;s share declined to 4 percent a year later, while WNPA posted viewership gains. Station staff were frustrated because the same local reporting and sports staff, producing the same reporting, was being weighed down by the change in news format. The news director was fired and replaced. Ratings began to improve after the time devoted to segments from News Central was cut back in August 2005, with WPGH regaining its lead over WNPA, but by the end of the year, rumors were running hot that Sinclair was about to dismantle the operation altogether and have WPXI produce news for WPGH.

===Newscasts from WPXI===
The rumors turned into reality on January 11, 2006, when Sinclair announced that WPGH would produce its last newscast on January 27, with WPXI taking over production on January 30 from its studios. Alby Oxenreiter was hired by WPXI to work in its sports department, but most other staff were laid off by Sinclair. The PCNC newscast, which WPXI had continued producing, moved to 7 p.m.; the new 10 p.m. news on channel 53 was anchored on weeknights by WPXI&#x27;s evening anchor team of David Johnson and Darieth Chisolm. In 2013, former CNN anchor Lisa Sylvester replaced Chisolm as the 6, 10 and 11 p.m. news anchor for WPXI.

For the first time since WPGH began airing local news in 1997, the news offering expanded beyond 10 p.m. on March 14, 2022, with the debut of &quot;Channel 11 News on Fox 53 at 6:30&quot;, replacing a second half-hour of &quot;You Bet Your Life with Jay Leno&quot;. On January 8, 2024, &quot;Channel 11 Morning News on Fox 53&quot; debuted at 7 a.m. as an extension of WPXI&#x27;s existing morning newscast.

On January 18, 2021, WPGH-TV began airing the Sinclair-produced &quot;The National Desk&quot; from 7 to 9 a.m. With the 2024 morning news launch, the station instead began airing &quot;TND&quot; at 6 and 8 a.m.

==Notable former on-air staff==
* Tamsen Fadal – reporter, 1997
* Jay Harris – reporter, weekend anchor, weeknight anchor (1997–2003)
* Eleanor Schano – host of &quot;Good Day Pittsburgh&quot; and &quot;Pittsburgh Women &#x27;79&quot; in the 1970s

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

WPGH-TV began broadcasting a digital signal on channel 43 on April 1, 2002. The analog signal on channel 53 was shut down on February 17, 2009, which had been the original digital television transition date. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on channel 43. WPGH relocated its signal from channel 43 to channel 20 on December 6, 2019, as a result of the 2016 United States wireless spectrum auction.

In June 2020, WPNT converted to ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) operation, with its main channel broadcast in ATSC 1.0 format on WPGH-TV.

<text>T.B. Ackerson Company was a real estate development company that built several planned communities in the New York metropolitan area during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==History==
The company was founded by Thomas Benton Ackerson in 1898. That year, it purchased and began developing land in Flatbush bounded between East 19th Street, Ocean Avenue, Beverly Road and Cortelyou Road. The development, known as Beverly Square East, was completed and fully sold by 1901.

In the 1920s, the company developed a neighborhood over a portion of shipping tycoon Carlos W. Munson&#x27;s estate in Flower Hill, New York.

Its former real estate office building for Fiske Terrace is now a station house for the New York City Subway&#x27;s Avenue H station, at the corner of Avenue H and East 16th Street. The building was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2005.

== Notable developments ==
* Beverley Squares (in Brooklyn)
* West Midwood (in Brooklyn)
* Fiske Terrace (in Brooklyn)
* Brightwaters, New York (on Long Island; now an incorporated village of the same name)

<doc id="1236523" wikidata="Q1425203" url="?curid=1236523" title="Tommy Windich">
<text>Tommy Windich ( – ) was an Indigenous Australian member of a number of exploring expeditions in Western Australia in the 1860s and 1870s.

Tommy Windich (or Windiitj) was born around 1840 near Mount Stirling in Western Australia. Little is known of his youth, but his skills in tracking and knowledge of a number of Aboriginal languages suggest a traditional upbringing, whereas his skills in horseriding and marksmanship indicate extensive contact with colonial culture.

By the early 1860s, Windich was working as a &quot;native assistant&quot; in the police force at York, where his main tasks were to assist in the tracking of escaped convicts, Aborigines who were wanted by the authorities, and escaped horses.

In 1863, he joined the first aboriginal assistant policeman Cowits to accompany Henry Maxwell Lefroy on his expedition east of York to the interior.

In 1865 he tracked and helped to recapture a prison escapee named Joseph Johns, who would later become the notorious bushranger Moondyne Joe. Early in 1866 he helped to capture three Aborigines who had murdered a pastoralist, one of whom fought against his arrest, spearing Windich in the arm. This expedition appears to have made Windich&#x27;s name as a superb tracker and a reliable and useful member of any travelling party, for he was afterwards in constant demand. 

Windich and Cowits joined Constable Edwards in the police expedition east in May 1866 which discovered petroleum.

Sometime in 1866 Windich was stationed to Beverley, where he continued his usual work as a native assistant, but was also sent on a number of exploring expeditions. Windich&#x27;s next exploratory expedition (also with Cowits) was the third expedition of the explorer Charles Hunt. The objective was to explore the area east of the Hampton Plains but an unseasonal drought caused a great shortage of water and feed for the horses, and they were forced to abandon their plans and return to York.

In 1869, Windich was a member of John Forrest&#x27;s first expedition, which searched without success for clues to the fate of the long-lost explorer Ludwig Leichhardt in the desert west of the site of the present-day town of Leonora. The following year, he was a member of Forrest&#x27;s second expedition, which surveyed Edward John Eyre&#x27;s route between the colonies of Western Australia and South Australia along the coast of the Great Australian Bight. In 1871, Windich was part of another attempt to explore the land beyond the Hampton Plains, this time under the guidance of Alexander Forrest. This expedition discovered about of pastoral land, half of which was of fine quality, but also found water to be extremely scarce. In 1874, Windich was a member of John Forrest&#x27;s third and most ambitious expedition. This expedition explored the watershed of the Murchison River, discovering much new pastoral land, then headed east through the uncharted centre of Western Australia, to the overland telegraph line from Darwin to Adelaide.
Early in 1876, Windich was working as a guide with the party constructing the overland telegraph line from Perth to Adelaide, when he caught a chill that became a serious illness. On about 20 February, he died of pneumonia. He was buried at Dempster Head near Esperance. John Forrest said at the time
:&quot;his name is almost a household word in this colony... I feel that I have lost an old and well tried companion and friend.&quot;

==Cultural references==
In September 1988, a cultivar of barley, bred by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture for performance in medium to high rainfall areas, was released under the name &quot;&quot;Hordeum vulgare&quot; (Barley) c.v. Windich&quot;. Commonly referred to simply as &quot;Windich&quot;, the cultivar is named for Tommy Windich, continuing a tradition of naming Western Australian grain cultivars after historic people of Western Australia.

<text>Dianne Virginia Judge (born 19 August 1956) is a former Australian politician, who was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Strathfield for the Labor Party from 2003 until 2011.

==Early life==
Judge was born in Cooma, New South Wales, and educated in her early years in both Canberra and New Delhi, India, where her father was posted as a diplomat associated with the Columbo Plan.

She obtained distinctions at 6th grade with the NSW Music Examinations Advisory Board in each of Speech and Drama, Pianoforte and Music Theory. Unfortunately, her intended career as an opera singer was cut short by vocal cord polyps.

She received a Bachelor of Education from the Canberra College of Advanced Education (later University of Canberra) and the Canberra School of Music.

Judge taught in primary and secondary schools in both Sydney and Canberra. She also worked as a volunteer abroad for the Overseas Service Bureau in Tonga and as a project officer for small non-government organisation, &quot;The Australian Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific&quot;, now known as &quot;Action on Poverty&quot;, delivering items such as humidicribs, toilets and ovens to Pacific islands such as Nauru, the Solomon Islands and Fiji. While working in Tonga as an overseas volunteer she was employed as a teacher at Queen Salote College, a very large high school in Nuku’alofa in Tonga. After her work in Tonga, Judge returned to Sydney and resumed her teaching career, including at Evondale Special School for students with intellectual disabilities. She also studied law part-time at Macquarie University.

==Local Government career==

Judge was elected to Strathfield Municipal Council in 1995, and was reelected with overwhelming community support, enabling her to serve as Mayor of Strathfield from 2000 to 2003, the first woman from the Australian Labor Party in this role.

==Political career==

On 23 March 2003 Judge was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales as the first woman to represent the NSW seat of Strathfield.

In May 2007, following the re-election of the Labor Government led by Morris Iemma, she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary Assisting the Minister for Education &amp; Training, Industrial Relations, and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance.

In September 2008, when Nathan Rees became Premier, she was appointed Minister Assisting the Premier on the Arts, Minister for Citizenship, and Minister for Fair Trading.

In the cabinet re-shuffle following Rees being replaced as Premier by Kristina Keneally, Judge retained the portfolio of Fair Trading, and became Minister for the Arts, the first woman to hold this portfolio in NSW. She held these portfolios until the ALP lost office at the 2011 election.

==Post political career==
In July 2011, Judge became head of strategic partnerships at the Children&#x27;s Medical Research Institute an independent medical research institute which commenced operations in 1958 as part of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in Camperdown, Sydney.

<doc id="1236538" wikidata="Q3866055" url="?curid=1236538" title="Moschia">
<text>Moschia (Meskheti, possibly related to Mushki) is a mountainous region of Georgia between Iberia, Armenia, and Colchis. The Moschian Mountains were the connecting chain between the Caucasus and Anti-Taurus Mountains. The people of that area were known as the Moschi. They may have been connected to the Mushki.

Wilhelm Gesenius suggested that the Moschi were descended from the Biblical Meshech tribe.

Strabo mentions the Moschian Mountains as joining the Caucasus (&quot;Geography&quot;, 11.2.1). He says that the Moschian country lay above the rivers Phasis, Glaucus, and Hippus (&quot;Geography&quot;, 11.2.17). In it &quot;lies the temple of Leucothea, founded by Phrixus, and the oracle of Phrixus, where a ram is never sacrificed; it was once rich, but it was robbed in our time by Pharnaces, and a little later by Mithridates of Pergamum.&quot; (ibid).

According to the renowned scholar of the Caucasian studies Cyril Toumanoff, the Moschians were the early proto-Georgian tribes which were integrated into the first early Georgian state of Iberia.

Mushki are mentioned in the cuneiform tablets of Tiglath-Pileser I of Assyria dating to 1115–1100 B.C. He led a campaign against them in the North of Commagene and mountains of Georgia and Armenia. According to Igor Diakonoff, the Mushki possibly were speakers of Proto-Armenian, who carried their language from the Balkans across Asia Minor, mixing with Hurrians (and Urartians) and Luwians along the way. However, the connection between the Mushki and Armenian languages is quite unclear and many modern scholars have rejected a direct linguistic relationship. Additionally, genetic research does not support significant admixture into the Armenian nation after 1200 BCE, making the Mushki, if they indeed migrated from a Balkan or western Anatolian homeland during or after the Bronze Age Collapse, unlikely candidates for the Proto-Armenians. However, as others have placed (at least the Eastern) Mushki or Meskhi homeland in South Caucasus region mostly speaking Georgian language as their native.

Medieval maps mention with Moschi region Armenian and Iberian parts.

<text>The PA-20 Pacer and PA-22 Tri-Pacer, Caribbean, and Colt are an American family of light strut-braced high-wing monoplane aircraft built by Piper Aircraft from 1949 to 1964.

The Pacer is essentially a four-place version of the two-place PA-17 Vagabond, with conventional landing gear, a steel tube fuselage and an aluminum frame wing covered with fabric, much like Piper&#x27;s famous Cub and Super Cub. The Tri-Pacer is a development of the Pacer with tricycle landing gear, while the Colt is a two-seat flight training version of the Tri-Pacer. Prized for their ruggedness, spacious cabins, and, for the time, impressive speed, many of these aircraft continue to fly today. 

Factory installed , , , , and engine options were available, and engine after-market conversions have been offered.

==Development==
The Pacer and the Tri-Pacer were the first post-World War II Piper designs with flaps and a control yoke instead of a center stick, and they belong to a sub-group of Piper aircraft popularly called &quot;short wing Pipers,&quot; reflecting their shorter wingspans compared to the earlier J-3 Cub and PA-18 Super Cub. The PA-20 Pacer is a tailwheel aircraft and thus has somewhat limited forward visibility on the ground and relatively demanding ground-handling characteristics. To help introduce more pilots to easier, safer flying, from February 1951, Piper introduced the PA-22 Tri-Pacer with a nosewheel instead of the tailwheel landing gear. Additionally, the Tri-Pacer offered higher-powered engine options in the form of and engines, whereas the largest engine available to the original Pacer had an output of . At the time the tricycle undercarriage became a popular preference and 1953 saw the PA-22 Tri-Pacer outsell the Pacer by a ratio of six to one. Due to the geometry of the nosewheel installation, the aircraft is sometimes called the &quot;Flying Milk Stool.&quot;

In 1959 and 1960 Piper offered a cheaper, less well-equipped version of the Tri-Pacer with a Lycoming O-320 designated the PA-22-150 Caribbean. Over 9400 Tri-Pacers were produced between 1950 and 1964 when production ended, with 3280 still registered with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in April 2018.

An unusual feature of the Tri-Pacer is bungees linking the ailerons and rudder to facilitate coordinated flight. The system can be easily overcome by the pilot as needed and allowed the installation of a simple Mitchell Industries transistorised autopilot marketed by Piper under the name &quot;Auto-control&quot;. It has roll and yaw data derived from a modified AN5735-1 Direction Indicator and AN5736-1 Gyro Horizon, boosted by a piggyback amplifier on the direction indicator driving a Globe Motors bi-directional motor/servo clamped to the top of the control column via the aileron control chains.

A trainer version of the PA-22 Tri-Pacer, the PA-22-108 Colt, was introduced to compete directly with other popular trainers such as the Cessna 150, and was powered by a Lycoming O-235. Quickly designed in late 1960, the two-seat Colt was offered at a substantially lower price than the Tri-Pacer, and omitted the four-seat aircraft&#x27;s flaps and second wing tank along with the rear side windows and door. The Colt otherwise closely resembles the Tri-Pacer, using the same front seats and door, landing gear, engine mounts, windshield, tail surfaces, struts and instrument panel. Over 2,000 Colts were manufactured and it was the last Pacer variant—and thus the last short wing Piper—to be dropped from production. 

The last batch of 12 PA-22-150s were built for the French Army in 1963 and the last of the family, a PA-22-108 Colt, was completed on 26 March 1964. The type was replaced on the Vero Beach production line by the PA-28 Cherokee 140.

Some PA-22s have been converted to a tailwheel configuration, resulting in an aircraft that is very similar to a PA-20 Pacer, but which retains the model refinements and features of the PA-22. These conversions are often referred to by owners as PA-22/20s and are often listed in classified aircraft ads as such, although officially such converted aircraft continue to be designated by the FAA as PA-22 Tri-Pacers. When this conversion is accomplished, disc brakes are usually installed in place of the original drum brakes, and the Lycoming O-360 180 HP engine is the preferred upgrade.
Some PA-22s have a Hartzell constant-speed controllable propeller or Koppers Aeromatic propeller. Each of these installations improves performance and economy at the sacrifice of payload. A few Colts have also been converted to tailwheel configuration, although this is not as popular as converting Tri-Pacers.

==Operational history==

===Cuba===
Between 1953 and 1955, the Cuban Army Air Force (Fuerza Aérea Ejército de Cuba, or FAEC) received 7 PA-20s, 4 PA-22-150s, and 3 PA-22-160s. During the Cuban Revolution, PA-22s had their rear-doors removed and a .30 caliber machine gun installed in its place for use against insurgents, along with hand-dropped grenades. A PA-22 providing ground support for the Cuban Army during the Battle of Guisa is believed to be the lone aircraft lost by the FAEC to enemy fire.

===Katanga===
During the Congo Crisis, Katangese separatists received five PA-22-150s from the South African Air Force for the &quot;Force aérienne katangaise&quot; which were deployed against ONUC forces between 1961 and 1963.

<doc id="1236542" wikidata="Q219448" url="?curid=1236542" title="Projective hierarchy">
<text>In the mathematical field of descriptive set theory, a subset formula_1 of a Polish space formula_2 is projective if it is formula_3 for some positive integer formula_4. Here formula_1 is
* formula_6 if formula_1 is analytic
* formula_8 if the complement of formula_1, formula_10, is formula_3
* formula_12 if there is a Polish space formula_13 and a formula_8 subset formula_15 such that formula_1 is the projection of formula_17 onto formula_2; that is, formula_19

The choice of the Polish space formula_13 in the third clause above is not very important; it could be replaced in the definition by a fixed uncountable Polish space, say Baire space or Cantor space or the real line.

== Relationship to the analytical hierarchy ==

There is a close relationship between the relativized analytical hierarchy on subsets of Baire space (denoted by lightface letters formula_21 and formula_22) and the projective hierarchy on subsets of Baire space (denoted by boldface letters formula_23 and formula_24). Not every formula_3 subset of Baire space is formula_26. It is true, however, that if a subset &quot;X&quot; of Baire space is formula_3 then there is a set of natural numbers &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;X&quot; is formula_28. A similar statement holds for formula_8 sets. Thus the sets classified by the projective hierarchy are exactly the sets classified by the relativized version of the analytical hierarchy. This relationship is important in effective descriptive set theory. Stated in terms of definability, a set of reals is projective iff it is definable in the language of second-order arithmetic from some real parameter.

A similar relationship between the projective hierarchy and the relativized analytical hierarchy holds for subsets of Cantor space and, more generally, subsets of any effective Polish space.

<text>WQXR-FM (105.9 FM) is an American non-commercial classical radio station, licensed to Newark, New Jersey, and serving the North Jersey and New York City area. It is owned by the nonprofit organization New York Public Radio (NYPR), which also operates WNYC (AM), WNYC-FM and the four-station New Jersey Public Radio group. WQXR-FM broadcasts from studios and offices located in the Hudson Square neighborhood in lower Manhattan and its transmitter is located at the Empire State Building. The station is the core audio service for NYPR&#x27;s WQXR brand.

The current WQXR-FM is its second FM incarnation in the New York City area. The first WQXR-FM in turn traced its history to an earlier New York City station, WQXR, which broadcast on the AM band. Both of these earlier stations were commercial operations, broadcasting classical music and known as &quot;the radio station of The New York Times&quot;. New York Public Radio acquired the WQXR-FM branding on July 14, 2009, as part of a three-way trade which also involved The New York Times Company—the previous owners of WQXR-FM—and Univision Radio. As a result of the deal, WQXR-FM became a non-commercial public radio station on a new FM frequency, now operated by New York Public Radio. Financial support includes three on-air pledge drives a year.

WQXR-FM&#x27;s main programming is also carried by translator station W279AJ, 103.7 FM in Highland, New York, simulcast on WNYC-FM&#x27;s 93.9 FM HD2 subchannel, and carried over Time Warner Cable television channel 590 in the Hudson Valley, New York. On July 29, 2013, programming began to be simulcast on the former WDFH, now WQXW, 90.3 FM in Ossining, New York, covering northern and central Westchester County. WQXR-FM&#x27;s standard programming is streamed on its webcast.

Additional programming includes New Sounds Radio, focusing on classical works by living composers, which is both streamed and broadcast over WQXR-FM&#x27;s HD2 subchannel. A streaming-only channel, Operavore, dedicated to opera music, was launched in 2012.

== History ==
===Original WQXR operations===

WQXR-FM is the outgrowth of a &quot;high-fidelity&quot; AM station, WQXR. This station was founded as experimental station W2XR by John V. L. Hogan and Elliott Sanger, and began operating in New York City on March 26, 1929, as a mechanical television station. In conjunction with the television transmissions, the station commonly broadcast classical music. In 1936 it was converted into a standard AM broadcast station at 1560 kHz, licensed to New York City with the call letters WQXR.

One of the listeners was the inventor of wide band FM, Edwin Howard Armstrong. When Armstrong put his experimental FM station, W2XMN, on the air, he arranged to rebroadcast some of WQXR&#x27;s programming. This ended in 1939, when Hogan and Sanger put their own experimental FM station on the air, W2XQR, just down the dial from Armstrong at 42.3 MHz. In 1941, the station began transmitting from the top of the Chanin Building, where it remained until 1965 when it moved to the top of the Empire State Building. Remnants of the original tower remain on the Chanin Building.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began licensing commercial FM stations in 1941, and W2XQR moved to 45.9 MHz, becoming W59NY. Effective November 1, 1943, the FCC modified its policy for FM call letters, and the station became WQXQ.

==== &quot;The radio station of the &quot;New York Times&quot;&quot; (1944–2009) ====
In 1944, Hogan and Sanger sold their holding company, Interstate Broadcasting Company, to the New York Times Company. When the FM broadcast band was moved from 42–50 MHz to its present frequency range of 88–108 MHz in 1945, WQXQ moved to 97.7 MHz. In early 1948 the call letters were changed to WQXR-FM, and its frequency, home of WQXR-FM for the next 64 years, to 96.3 MHz.

WQXR was the first AM station in New York to experiment with broadcasting in stereo, beginning in 1952. During some of its live concerts, it used two microphones positioned six feet (two meters) apart. The microphone on the right led to its AM feed, and the one on the left to its FM feed, so a listener could position two radios with the same separation, one tuned to 1560 and the other to 96.3, and listen in stereo.

During the 1950s, WQXR-FM&#x27;s programming was also heard on the Rural Radio Network on several stations in Upstate New York, including ones targeting Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany. This ended when the RRN stations were sold to Pat Robertson&#x27;s Christian Broadcasting Network. Both the AM and FM sides continued to simulcast each other until 1965, when the FCC began requiring commonly owned AM and FM stations in large markets to broadcast separate programming for at least part of the day. WQXR-FM concentrated on longer classical works, while WQXR (AM) aired lighter classical music and talk programs produced in conjunction with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. While this plan gave classical music fans two options, it also increased expenses for the stations.

In 1962, the QXR network was purchased by Novo Industrial Corporation but the WQXR stations remained under the New York Times Company ownership.

After briefly attempting to sell the WQXR stations in 1971, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was able to get a waiver of the simulcasting rules. The stations continued to duplicate each other until 1992, when the AM side changed its programming from classical to popular standards, becoming WQEW (now WFME). In 1998, the &quot;Times&quot; entered into a long-term lease for WQEW with ABC, a move which brought Radio Disney to New York City. The Times Company also included a purchase clause in the lease contract, and ABC exercised the option in 2007. This left WQXR-FM as the &quot;Times&quot; lone radio station and, following a sale of its group of television stations to Local TV LLC that same year, the Time&#x27;s sole broadcasting property.

===Operations on 105.9 MHz===
The facility on 105.9 MHz, taken over by New York Public Radio in 2009, has a history dating back to the early 1960s. On September 19, 1961, following competitive hearings, an Initial Decision was issued recommending approval of an application from the Cosmopolitan Broadcasting Company for a new station, located in Newark, New Jersey on 105.9 MHz. A Construction Permit for the station, which was initially assigned the call letters WCOM, was granted on November 8, 1961, and the station&#x27;s debut took place on July 15, 1962. On July 30, 1962, WCOM&#x27;s call sign was changed to WHBI, inheriting the call letters of a New York City station at 1280 AM, whose license had been voluntarily canceled twelve days earlier.

In 1972, WHBI&#x27;s 1969 application for license renewal was designated for an FCC hearing, to determine whether the owners were qualified to remain as licensees. A July 25, 1974, Initial Decision recommended against renewal. This recommendation was formally adopted on May 19, 1976, after finding that &quot;Cosmopolitan had operated its broadcast facility so as virtually to relinquish all interest and control over the station&#x27;s programming&quot;, and &quot;As a result of its abdication of licensee responsibility, numerous violations of Commission Rules occurred, including (but not limited to) the promotion of a lottery, false and misleading advertising, improper logging, failure to meet filing requirements, and inadequate record keeping&quot;.

The FCC conducted hearings in order to award an Interim Operation authorization to run the station until a new permanent licensee was chosen. In 1982 the Global Broadcasting Group was selected as the interim operator. On April 20, 1985, the station call letters were changed to WNWK.

Additional comparative hearings were held to determine the station&#x27;s new permanent licensee. This was awarded to Multicultural Radio Broadcasting, Inc., which assumed operations on August 20, 1992. On May 27, 1998, the station call letters were changed to WCAA. On February 13, 2007, the call sign became WQBU-FM, but was changed back to WCAA ten days later.

==== Frequency swap and sale to New York Public Radio (2009) ====


On July 14, 2009, the New York Times Company announced it was transferring the license for WQXR-FM on 96.3 FM to Univision Radio, in exchange for the license for Univision&#x27;s WCAA on 105.9 MHz, with the sale slated to close in the second half of 2009. This exchange included a third party, WNYC Radio, which would take over operations of 105.9 FM from the &quot;Times&quot;, now as a non-commercial station. Univision paid the New York Times Company $33.5 million for the license for 96.3 MHz, and WNYC Radio paid the New York Times Company $11.5 million for 105.9 FM&#x27;s license, equipment, and the WQXR call letters, music library and website.

The changes took place at 8:00 p.m. on October 8, 2009. Univision took over operation of the 96.3 FM facility, and changed its call letters from WQXR-FM to WCAA, which was then changed a week later to WXNY-FM. At the same time, the WQXR-FM call letters were moved to the former WCAA at 105.9 FM, with the station becoming a non-commercial radio station run by New York Public Radio. The last music played on 96.3 MHz was a live recording of &quot;&quot;West Side Story&quot; - Symphonic Dances: 4. Mambo&quot; of Leonard Bernstein. The first music played on 105.9 MHz was a live broadcast of &quot;Dumbarton Oaks&quot; of Igor Stravinsky performed by the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra at Carnegie Hall.

Although classical music under the WQXR-FM call letters continued to be broadcast for the greater New York City region after the transfer, the 105.9 FM facility has less range and population coverage than the previous operation on 96.3 FM. After the frequency swap, WQXR-FM transmissions continued to originate from the master antenna atop the Empire State Building. However, the former signal was 6,000 watts ERP (effective radiated power—the energy concentrated toward the horizon), with the new signal reduced to 610 watts. For comparison, the calculated signal strength on 105.9 FM at a distance of 30 miles (48 km, covering approximately 14.5 million people) is less than the 96.3 FM&#x27;s signal at 50 miles (80 km, covering approximately 17.1 million people). Further limiting coverage is Hartford&#x27;s WHCN, which also broadcasts on 105.9 MHz. Although WHCN has a directional antenna with a reduced signal toward WQXR&#x27;s transmitter, the two stations interfere with each other where their signals overlap.

A translator station on 96.7 FM in Asbury Park, New Jersey previously relayed WQXR&#x27;s programming, until the owner sold it and it was moved out of Asbury Park, meaning WQXR could no longer broadcast at that frequency.

<doc id="1236562" wikidata="Q7919608" url="?curid=1236562" title="Vendetta Online">
<text>Vendetta Online is a twitch-based, science fiction massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Guild Software for the operating systems Android, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, and Microsoft Windows. It uses the NAOS game engine, a fully real-time flight model and combat system, to offer first-person/third-person shooter-style player versus player and player versus environment battle action against the backdrop of a massively multiplayer universe. &quot;Vendetta Online&quot; shipped as a commercial MMORPG in November 2004 with a subscription-based business model, although it has been running continuously since April 2002. &quot;Vendetta Online&quot; is available to play across a wide array of platforms, including the Oculus Rift virtual reality display, allowing all users to directly interact in a single, contiguous galaxy. It is also notable for its twitch combat and fidelity to real physics.

==Gameplay==
The twitch gameplay in &quot;Vendetta Online&quot; revolves around lining up a correct shot against enemy ships, while avoiding incoming fire. The dynamics of this can be complex, as ships are moving through 3-D space, and the weapons fire itself has a specific velocity, modified by the ships&#x27; absolute velocity. The ships mostly obey the laws of Newtonian Mechanics although a few artificial limits are put in place to increase the playability of the game. The control scheme includes a full six degrees of freedom, allowing users to assign keys or control axes (via joystick, thumb-stick, throttle, accelerometer, or touch area) to yaw, pitch, roll, and thrust along three axes. Ships can also be controlled with the mouse and keyboard using &quot;mouselook&quot; mode, in which the direction of view is controlled by the mouse and the ship&#x27;s nose auto-corrects to catch up. Ships each have detailed specifications such as mass, thrust, torque, cargo capacity, top speed, turbo energy drain, armor, and weapon ports. There are also many variants of the main ship types, some holding certain advantages over others, with some advanced variants belonging to special factions. Depending on what equipment is being used, and what is carried in the cargo hold, the mass of the ship (and consequently maneuverability) will change greatly, affecting combat.

===Weaponry===

There are a wide variety of weapons in &quot;Vendetta Online&quot;, some requiring energy to fire, others relying on ammunition, proximity fuzes, target tracking, or some combination thereof. As most weapons have a cone of fire assisted by autoaim, effectively deploying weaponry relies less on careful aiming than it does on managing the ship&#x27;s momentum, energy, attitude and distance to target. Knowledge of combat proves an effective tool, as a veteran pilot flying mediocre equipment will often defeat a less experienced pilot using superior equipment, by virtue of tactics alone. However, certain weapons do require careful aiming, such as railguns. Weapons may cause the target ship to be displaced, or to spin through concussive force. Weapons may also hit a target that has not been selected, or hit an unintended target or friendly ship.

===Factions===
In &quot;Vendetta Online&quot;, there are three playable nations and many minor factions. The nations are the Itani Nation, the Serco Dominion, and the Union of Independent Territories (usually referred to as the UIT). The Itani are reputed for their science and maneuverable ships, the Serco for their warrior nature and armored ships, and the UIT for their trading abilities and neutrality. Choosing which nation to play affects initial faction standings, and which missions will later become available.

===Licenses and faction standing===
&quot;Vendetta Online&quot; uses a five-category license system in which players earn experience toward different licenses by participating in different avenues of gameplay. For example, to earn a better trade license a player may trade commodities between stations for profit or take missions from the local trade guild. As a player&#x27;s licenses improve, different ships and equipment may become available to purchase and various types of missions appear. The player&#x27;s standing in the current faction that controls the space around them also affects what opportunities may be afforded them. Faction standing can be gained or lost through missions or by destroying ships of various alignment.

===Long-term objectives===
As the player progresses in licenses and faction, certain large-scale goals become available. The player may take part in the war against the Hive, an ever-expanding race of NPC Robots, vying for control of areas of space containing asteroids rich in valuable minerals. By banding together with other players, they may take down powerful enemies such as the Hive Queen or Leviathan, affecting Hive activities across many systems. The player may also join the military and take part in large scale conflict between the Serco and the Itani.

*Conquerable Stations - Several conquerable stations are scattered across unclaimed systems on the outskirts of national territory (an area known as Greyspace). Controlling these stations allows players to manufacture unique items and weaponry. Conquering a station involves destroying all of the station&#x27;s defensive turrets within a timed window of opportunity. Once all turrets have been destroyed, a short timer is triggered at the end of which the first player to dock with the station is given an access key, which may then be provided to allies. Whenever a conquerable station comes under attack, any player with a key is sent a message, allowing them to organize a defense or a counter-attack.
*Capture the Cargo (CtC) - Serco and Itani convoys depart hourly from within Greyspace, bound for their respective national territories. These convoys carry a valuable good known as Purified Xithricite Ore, which cannot be found elsewhere in the game. Players can lie in wait along the convoy routes and ambush the ships, picking up the ore and redirecting it to their own nation. At the end of each week the ore is tallied, and players belonging to the winning nation are given access to a special weapon. The losing nation is able to keep 20% of the ore that was collected as a surplus, the winning nation begins with nothing. UIT players are able to help either side as they see fit.
*Race Tracks - There are a series of racetracks in Greyspace that record player top times. The racetracks are in the form of tubes, with certain segments transparent and certain segments opaque, presenting a visual hazard. Some tracks include branching tubes, allowing multiple courses through a single track. Players may take damage by colliding with the tube walls at high speed, challenging them to find the best line through each track while avoiding the tube walls. There are checkpoints along the way that allow the player to gauge his or her lap time. At the end of every month an achievement badge is awarded to any player holding a top time on any track.
*Deneb War - Players belonging to either the Itani or the Serco military are able to engage in battles along the border between the nations. Depending on the outcome of each battle, territory may be claimed for either nation. Battles range in size from small fighter skirmishes to large battles between fleets of opposing capital ships. War convoys are sent out daily to blockade the entrance to the losing nation from Greyspace. This affects convoys carrying Purified Xithricite Ore, as the convoy route lies along the area that is blockaded.

===Manufacturing===
In June 2009, the game acquired the ability for several players to serve as crew together on one ship. Two years later in June 2011, a guild of players finished construction of &quot;Vendetta Online&quot;&#x27;s first player-owned capital ship. Player-owned capships are constructed through a series of manufacturing missions, in which the player delivers a list of necessary materials to the station, and receives the resulting components. The components are assembled through a final mission at a hidden capital shipyard station.

Various weapons, addons, and fighter class ships may be assembled through manufacturing missions as well. Most manufactured items hold some benefit over regularly purchased items. Material elements used in manufacturing are often scarce, including rare ore and unique items dropped by Hive robots. Manufactured items, together with the rare ore and components used to create them, form a base leg of &quot;Vendetta Online&quot;&#x27;s emerging player economy.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
&quot;Vendetta Online&quot; has a long backstory, which details the fate of humanity from 2140 to 4432. It was written by the lead game developer, John Bergman. The backstory is written from a historical perspective, from the viewpoint of an Itani monk chronicling the events leading to the galaxy&#x27;s present state. It outlines drastic advances in the fields of medicine and biotechnology during political unrest and warfare on Earth, the discovery of a stable wormhole near Saturn leading to a solar system across the galaxy, and the subsequent exploration, colonization, and inadvertent exile humankind experiences as a result of the wormhole&#x27;s collapse. The three national factions are described in great detail, including their origins, personality, and notable historical figures. Subterfuge, misunderstanding, and betrayal are common themes throughout the backstory.

===Galactic Trade Standard===
Galactic Trade Standard (GTS) is a fictional language unique to &quot;Vendetta Online&quot;. Similar to real-world East Asian languages, it includes both phonetic and symbolic alphabets. The phonetic alphabet is simplified to include major human sounds with few letters. The symbolic alphabet includes pictographic representations of objects and ideas relating to trade within &quot;Vendetta&quot;. The language was constructed to allow traders from foreign nations to communicate with one another easily, as certain nations spent centuries in isolation from each other before regaining contact. GTS can be found throughout the galaxy on projected neon signs outside of space stations, most often advertising goods and services but also sometimes including cryptic messages or humorous phrases.

==Development==
Vendetta Online&#x27;s development team is relatively small compared to many other titles in the same genre, at its largest including four people. The four original developers are John Bergman, Ray Ratelis, Andy Sloane, and Waylon Brinck. John Bergman remains the managing director and has invested much of his own personal finances into the project. The game is based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and has been in development since 1998. In April 2002, the game opened with a public alpha test to prove the efficiency of the twitch style combat in the low bandwidth environment of that era. In November 2004, the game launched as a retail product, with the Linux mascot featured as part of the game box artwork. The retail-CD included Mac, Linux, and PC native versions of the game.

Since launch, the development team has maintained Mac, Linux, and PC support for the game, allowing users on all three platforms to play and interact in the same universe. In 2010, the developers announced that the game would be ported to Android devices, allowing mobile device users to play. In March 2011, the game became available on mobile devices with the Nvidia Tegra, making it the first true PC MMORPG to make the jump to mobile. In September 2011, &quot;Vendetta&quot; launched on the Xperia Play. By December 2011, the game was available on a number of Android phones, and in October 2012, it was launched for Windows mobile devices on Windows RT, becoming the first game to appear in both the Nvidia TegraZone market and the Windows Store. On April 17, 2013, &quot;Vendetta&quot; launched on iTunes for iOS devices including the iPad 2 and later. &quot;Vendetta&quot; was the only MMORPG available at launch on the Android-based Ouya console, and continues to be accessible from the Ouya store. On July 24, 2013, &quot;Vendetta&quot; officially launched support for the Oculus Rift family of devices, marking the first time a live MMORPG supported the virtual reality display. On October 20, 2016, &quot;Vendetta&quot; launched for Samsung Gear VR, UploadVR noting it as &quot;the most ambitious space shooter on Gear VR so far&quot;. On March 30, 2017, &quot;Vendetta&quot; launched for Google Daydream VR. On September 21, 2017, &quot;Vendetta&quot; officially launched for iPhone. On June 9, 2018, &quot;Vendetta&quot; launched for Oculus Go.

Users on all platforms are fed into the same, contiguous galaxy, where they can directly interact. The gameplay itself has been described as &quot;device agnostic&quot;, meaning that users are able to approach the game with an even level of parity across platforms, and are blind to what platform other players with whom they are interacting are using. In general, the development team has a good relationship with the Vendetta Online user-base, often stopping to play online along with subscribed users and responding to user comments, questions and suggestions.

===Player Contribution Corps===
The PCC (Player Contribution Corps) is a hand-picked group of players that creates content for the game (mainly missions). These players use an in-house developed browser-based mission editor and submit their content to a publicly accessible test server. There the mission can be tested by anyone, and commented on. The mission can then be resubmitted, based on new suggestions. Typically, this process requires several months or more for a mission tree to be brought up to standard and implemented.

The PCC is a separate group from the remainder of the player base as an additional emphasis on &quot;Trust, Maturity, Involvement and English&quot; is expected of them. This is in part to ensure that the PCC remains a productive and collaborative environment that continues to produce high-quality content. The PCC is also responsible for helping design Lua code for the game&#x27;s User Interface, and testing new equipment before it becomes widely available. The PCC remains an innovative development on the MMO scene, bridging the gap between &quot;sandbox&quot; style player-contributed content and traditional top-down corporate game design, generated in a method reminiscent of Lucas&#x27; &#x27;Expanded Universe&#x27;.

==Reception==
Upon initial release, &quot;Vendetta Online&quot; received mixed reviews. GameSpot&#x27;s 2005 review rated &quot;Vendetta&quot; as &quot;good&quot;, highlighting the novel twitch-based space combat, and a successful implementation of multiplayer space trading and combat gameplay. However, it was felt that the limited content did not justify the subscription value, and the ship designs were deemed to be uninspiring. A more recent review by Kotaku stated that &quot;Vendetta&quot; was &quot;a deep game with an intuitive interface&quot; taking note of the port to Android mobile devices. &quot;Macworld&quot; called &quot;Vendetta&quot; &quot;a brilliant online gaming experience, clearly influenced by classic space games Elite and Frontier&quot;. Joystiq praised &quot;Vendetta&quot;&#x27;s development saying &quot;For active developer participation, Vendetta Online definitely runs near the head of the pack and might even lead it&quot;. In January of 2013, Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch named &quot;Vendetta&quot; &quot;The Most Multiplatform MMO Game Ever&quot;.

<doc id="1236563" wikidata="Q6375866" url="?curid=1236563" title="Kate Wolf">
<text>Kate Wolf (born Kathryn Louise Allen; January 27, 1942 – December 10, 1986) was an American folk singer and songwriter. Though her career was relatively short, she had a significant impact on the folk music scene. Her best-known compositions include &quot;Here in California&quot;, &quot;Love Still Remains&quot;, &quot;Across the Great Divide&quot;, &quot;Unfinished Life&quot;, “Green Eyes” and &quot;Give Yourself to Love&quot;. She recorded six albums as a solo artist. She was elected to the NAIRD Independent Music Hall of Fame in 1987. Her songs have since been recorded by Nanci Griffith and Emmylou Harris (whose recording of &quot;Love Still Remains&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1999).

==Biography==
Wolf was born in San Francisco to John Fred Allen (*1915) and Ernestine Ruth Allen, née Endicott (1918−1996). She began studying piano at 4 but quit at 16 because of her shyness. During their senior year (1959–60) at Berkeley High School, Kathy Allen and her friend Marian Auerbach (now Shapiro) sang folk songs at the Berkeley High School Talent Shows (1957 and 1960). At age 19 she first met Saul Wolf, an architecture student at UC Berkeley; they married two years later. They had two children, born in 1964 and 1967.

In 1969 she became part of the Big Sur music community and developed rapidly as a guitarist and songwriter, influenced by such friends as Gil &quot;Jellyroll&quot; Turner and George Schroder. In 1971, she parted from Saul Wolf on good terms and moved to Sonoma County. There she formed her first band, The Wildwood Flower, with Don Coffin, whom she later married.

Her first album, &quot;Back Roads&quot;, released in 1976 on her own label, Owl Records, was recorded in a living room with the band Wildwood Flower, and was &quot;remarkably well done.&quot; An important mentor, friend and touring companion was Utah Phillips. In 1979, she separated from Don Coffin, and the Wildwood Flower folded, but guitarist and mandolin player Nina Gerber became her accompanist for the rest of her career.

She married again in 1982 to Terry Fowler until her death in 1986. She died in December 1986, at age 44, after a long struggle with leukemia. She is buried at a small church cemetery in Goodyears Bar, California. In 1987, the World Folk Music Association established the Kate Wolf Award to honor her memory.

A live performance by Kate Wolf in 1981, comprising seven songs on which she is accompanied by Nina Gerber and Ford James, is included in the 2024 album &quot;Bear&#x27;s Sonic Journals: Sing Out!&quot;.

Wolf, with fellow musician Don Coffin to whom she was married at the time, also appears on the 1973 album &quot;We Walked by the Water&quot; by folksinger Lionel Kilberg. This album was re-released in 1995 under the title &quot;Breezes&quot; and credited to Wolf alone on the front cover. Her family has stated that Wolf did not consider these songs as representative of her work.

Both Kilberg&#x27;s &quot;We Walked by the Water&quot; and Wolf&#x27;s own album &quot;Lines on the Paper&quot; are dedicated to Gil Turner, who Wolf and Coffin first met via Lionel Kilberg. Wolf subsequently recorded her own version of Turner&#x27;s much-covered folk anthem &quot;Carry It On&quot;.

A number of Wolf&#x27;s albums were done in collaboration with Bill Griffin.

==Legacy==
===Music festival===
Wolf&#x27;s music was celebrated each year toward the end of June at the Kate Wolf Memorial Music Festival held at Black Oak Ranch in Laytonville, California. Several thousand guests attended this outdoor festival, which was regularly headlined by popular folk musicians such as Nina Gerber and Greg Brown. The festival traditionally closed with Wolf&#x27;s song &quot;Give Yourself to Love&quot;.

The 25th annual Kate Wolf Music Festival was scheduled for June 2020, then postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It took place 2 years later, as a 4-day festival, rescheduled to June 23–26, 2022. According to the promoters, Back Road Productions, 2022 was the final Kate Wolf Music Festival.

<text>In topology, the Nagata–Smirnov metrization theorem characterizes when a topological space is metrizable. The theorem states that a topological space formula_1 is metrizable if and only if it is regular, Hausdorff and has a countably locally finite (that is, -locally finite) basis.

A topological space formula_1 is called a regular space if every non-empty closed subset formula_3 of formula_1 and a point p not contained in formula_3 admit non-overlapping open neighborhoods.
A collection in a space formula_1 is countably locally finite (or -locally finite) if it is the union of a countable family of locally finite collections of subsets of formula_7 

Unlike Urysohn&#x27;s metrization theorem, which provides only a sufficient condition for metrizability, this theorem provides both a necessary and sufficient condition for a topological space to be metrizable. The theorem is named after Junichi Nagata and Yuriĭ Mikhaĭlovich Smirnov, whose (independent) proofs were published in 1950 and 1951, respectively.

<text>Pakistan is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. Economists estimate that Pakistan has been part of the wealthiest region of the world throughout the first millennium CE having the largest economy by GDP. This advantage was lost in the 18th century as other regions edged forward such as China and Western Europe.

Pakistan is considered as a developing country and is one of the Next Eleven, the eleven countries that, along with the BRICs, have a high potential to become the world&#x27;s largest economies in the 21st century. However, after decades of social instability, , serious deficiencies in macromanagement and unbalanced macroeconomics in basic services such as train transportation and electrical energy generation had developed. The economy is considered to be semi-industrialized, with centres of growth along the Indus River. The diversified economies of Karachi and Punjab&#x27;s urban centres coexist with less developed areas in other parts of the country particularly in Balochistan. According to the Economic complexity index, Pakistan is the 67th largest export economy in the world and the 106th most complex economy. During the fiscal year 2015–16, Pakistan&#x27;s exports stood at US$20.81 billion and imports at US$44.76 billion, resulting in a negative trade balance of US$23.96 billion.

<text>Paula P-Orridge (born Paula Jean Brooking, 23 February 1963), also known as Alaura O&#x27;Dell, is an English musician, writer and entrepreneur.

==Career==
P-Orridge&#x27;s musical career began in 1979 when she met musician and artist Genesis P-Orridge while working at a Tesco supermarket in Hackney, East London.

Prior to meeting Genesis she had had some connection to the Industrial Records music scene and had performed onstage with band 23 Skidoo. Genesis was a member of seminal band Throbbing Gristle, an originator of industrial music and an influential figure in the development of post-punk and electronica. Prior to Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s last show, Paula married Genesis in Tijuana, Mexico; they had two daughters, Caresse and Genesse.

===1980s===
Paula joined Genesis&#x27; band Psychic TV in 1983, playing drums and creating sound collages. She ran the mail order section of Temple Records and sometimes acted as Psychic TV&#x27;s tour manager and record company liaison.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, Paula and Genesis left the United Kingdom to live in Nepal and the United States in a self-imposed exile, during which the couple divorced.

In 1995 while in the United States, Paula released a solo ambient music and spoken word album, &quot;Sacred Dreams&quot;, on the San Francisco-based record label, Silent Records. &quot;Sacred Dreams&quot; differed significantly from her previous work and she released the album under her new name of Alaura O&#x27;Dell.

The &quot;Sacred Dreams&quot; album was recorded in December 1994 in collaboration with Justin Beck, a Californian electronica artist. The album was also the debut of P-Orridge&#x27;s new interest in spirituality and new-age mysticism. &quot;Sacred Dreams&quot; has been re-released on Justin Beck&#x27;s label, Sanctioned Records as an mp3.

To complement her interest in New Age Goddess worship, in 1996 Paula P-Orridge/ Alaura O&#x27;Dell established an independent, niche travel company, S&quot;acred Journeys for Womyn&quot;. The company offers educational, experiential and healing tours exclusively to women, visiting sites of significance revered for a tradition of Goddess worship.

<doc id="1236578" wikidata="Q7016139" url="?curid=1236578" title="1954 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1954 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 31st term. It saw the governing National Party remain in office, but with a slightly reduced majority. It also saw the debut of the new Social Credit Party, which won more than eleven percent of the vote but failed to win a seat.

==Background==
The National Party had formed its first administration after the 1949 elections. It had then been re-elected by a large margin amid the industrial disputes of the 1951 election. The Prime Minister, Sidney Holland, was popular in many sectors of society for his strong line against striking dockworkers and coalminers, while Labour&#x27;s leader, Walter Nash, had been criticised for his failure to take a firm stand on the issue. Labour was troubled by internal disputes, with Nash subjected to an unsuccessful leadership challenge only a few months before the election. For the election, the National government adopted a &quot;steady as she goes&quot; approach, saying that the country was in good hands and did not need any major policy realignments.

Nash tried to make the election about the issue of cost-of-living with most of Labour&#x27;s campaign promises being financial policies. He frequently highlighted the fact that in 1949 National had promised to &quot;make the pound go further&quot; but five years on what cost £1 (20 shillings) now cost 28 shillings. Labour&#x27;s campaign promises included raising the child allowance to 15 shillings a week, housing loans with only 3% interest and the introduction of a PAYE income taxation system. After a slow start to his campaign, things improved for Nash towards the end of his campaign. This was evidenced by his audiences becoming more enthusiastic such as one meeting held at the Auckland Town Hall where a crowd of 10,000 impatiently telling the first speaker, trade union president Fintan Patrick Walsh, to sit down and a chant of &quot;we want Walter&quot; breaking out.

The Social Credit campaign meetings aroused far more public interest than those of the main parties. A common public perception was Labour and National were increasingly close to each other on policies compared to the substantial policy differences in the 1930s. In an attempt to counter the public enthusiasm to Social Credit, Labour promised mid-campaign to make the state the sole authority for the issue of credit and currency.

==The election==
The date for the main 1954 elections was 13 November. 1,209,670 people were registered to vote, and turnout was 91.4%. The number of seats being contested was 80, a number which had been fixed since 1902.

The following new (or reconstituted) electorates were introduced in 1954: Heretaunga, , Rotorua, Stratford, Waipa and Waitemata. Two candidates, both called John Stewart, came second; in for National and in for Labour.

===MPs retiring in 1954===
Ten MPs retired at the election, see cartoon.

Paddy Kearins also left parliament at the election. His electorate of was abolished and he failed to gain selection to stand for Labour in the replacement electorate of . Two Labour MPs had announced their intention to retire at the 1954 election (Harry Combs MP for Onslow and Arthur Osborne MP for Onehunga) but died before the end of the parliament.

==Results==
The 1954 election saw the governing National Party re-elected with a ten-seat margin, a drop from the twenty-seat margin it previously held. National won forty-five seats to the Labour Party&#x27;s thirty-five. The popular vote was much closer, however, with the two parties separated by only 0.2% (1,602 votes). On preliminary results Labour was leading in 37 seats and was actually ahead of National in the popular vote by 0.33%. No seats were won by minor party candidates or by independents, but the new Social Credit Party managed to win 11.2% of the vote, and it can be argued that Social Credit saved the National Government by providing an alternative to Labour and so minimising the two-party swing. Nash argued that Social Credit&#x27;s impact on the election was being a spoiler, claiming Labour was denied victory because of this.

<doc id="1236579" wikidata="Q4917468" url="?curid=1236579" title="Bishop (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, a bishop is the highest office of the Aaronic priesthood. It is almost always held by one who holds the office of high priest in the Melchizedek priesthood. The Latter Day Saint concept of the office differs significantly from the role of bishops in other Christian denominations, being in some respects more analogous to a pastor or parish priest. Each bishop serves with two counselors, who together form a bishopric.

The role of a bishop varies in the different Latter Day Saint denominations; however, they derive from a common history.

== History of the office ==
On February 4, 1831, Edward Partridge became the first man called to the office of bishop in the early Latter Day Saint church. The duties of the office were to oversee the temporal affairs and accounts of the church through the implementation of the law of consecration. Partridge was called to preside over the Missouri church in Joseph Smith&#x27;s absence. Soon thereafter, Partridge and his family emigrated to the church&#x27;s growing colony in Jackson County, Missouri, where he continued to act as bishop of the branch of the church. Newel K. Whitney was then called as a bishop to oversee the temporal affairs of the church in Kirtland, Ohio.

When the Latter Day Saints were headquartered in Nauvoo, Illinois, the membership was separated into three &quot;wards&quot; or geographical precincts (&quot;Upper&quot;, &quot;Middle&quot;, and &quot;Lower&quot;), and a bishop was called to oversee the temporal affairs of each ward. Partridge presided over the &quot;Upper Ward&quot;, Whitney presided over the &quot;Middle Ward&quot;, and Vinson Knight presided over the &quot;Lower Ward&quot;.

Over time in the church&#x27;s history, the position of Presiding Bishop was created. Partridge is considered the church&#x27;s &quot;First Presiding Bishop&quot;, although neither he nor his contemporaries saw him as a superior to other bishops of the church in that time period.

After the 1844 succession crisis, the roles of bishop and Presiding Bishop developed separately in the various resulting denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.

== Levitical bishops ==
According to Latter Day Saint scripture, a bishop in the church does not need to be a high priest, nor does he need counselors, if he is a Levite and a direct descendant of Aaron, the brother of Moses. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), apostle Joseph Fielding Smith taught that this provision applied only to the Presiding Bishop of the church and not to bishops of wards.

The Presiding Bishop of the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, W. Kevin Romer, is recognized as a “literal descendant of Aaron” and holds the title of Aaronic High Priest.

==Bishops in the LDS Church==

In the LDS Church, the largest Latter Day Saint denomination, bishops are called from among the members of a local congregation, known as a ward, and serve without pay for four to seven years though the length of service varies. A bishop must be a worthy Melchizedek priesthood holder and is usually married. The bishop serves as the presiding high priest of the ward. A bishop simultaneously serves as the president of the Aaronic priesthood and president of the priests quorum in the ward. In a branch, the branch president fulfills the same functions as a bishop; however, a branch president does not need to be a high priest.

The bishop is often called &quot;the father of the ward&quot; as he is the priesthood leader who is most intimately involved with individual church members. The bishop is not paid for the time he devotes to his position. All local positions in the LDS Church operate as a lay ministry; members donate their time to perform the duties assigned with each calling. Each bishop serves with two counselors, who together form a bishopric. The counselors to a bishop are generally high priests, but there are exceptions, such as in a singles ward, where the counselors may be elders.

The immediate priesthood leader of the bishop is the stake president, who provides direction, training and counsel to the bishops of the wards within his stake boundaries; the stake president is assisted in these duties by two counselors and a stake high council. New bishops are recommended by the stake president, but each bishop is formally approved by and called in writing by the church&#x27;s First Presidency. Prior to ordination, the proposed ordination of a bishop must also be accepted by common consent by the members of the ward.

===Duties===
The bishop holds the primary responsibility for everything in the ward, both spiritually and temporally. Although he can delegate specific assignments to his counselors, the ultimate responsibility falls to him. His duties include presiding over and conducting meetings and worship services; serving as president of the ward&#x27;s priests quorum; acting as a &quot;judge in Israel&quot; or &quot;common judge&quot;; providing temporary financial relief for ward members; serving as the presiding high priest of the ward; and organizing and managing the ward&#x27;s organizations. After being called, a bishop is ordained a high priest (if he does not already hold that priesthood office) and then ordained a bishop and set apart as the bishop and presiding high priest of the specific ward. He is also given the priesthood &quot;keys&quot; which authorize him to serve as a representative for the Lord in performing his duties. The ordinations, setting apart, and the conferral of keys is performed by the laying on of hands by the stake president. After a bishop is released from his responsibilities over the ward, he retains the priesthood office of bishop for life.

*Presiding over services – Each Sunday, the bishop is responsible for organizing the main worship service, called sacrament meeting. The bishop and his counselors select speakers from among the members of the ward, assigned high council speakers, and, on occasion, guest speakers. The bishop or his counselors may also speak in sacrament meeting. A member of the bishopric conducts the meeting, introduces the speakers, and occasionally concludes the meeting with a few remarks. Once each month, normally the first Sunday of the month, a &quot;fast and testimony meeting&quot; is held and no specific speakers are assigned. Instead, those attending the ward that day are invited to stand and bear testimony of Jesus and his work and influence.
*President of the priests quorum – The bishop is the president of the Aaronic priesthood and the priests quorum in the ward. He selects two priests to serve as first and second assistants to the bishop. The bishop assists (along with parents) in preparing each priest to worthily serve as a missionary and to prepare to receive the ordinances of the temple. He also provides guidance and encourages the spiritual and temporal learning of every young priesthood holder. He is responsible for new member baptisms and missionary work in the ward.
*Judge in Israel – Members are interviewed by their bishop in order to receive a temple recommend. The bishop signs the recommend to indicate that the member is following basic tenets of the church and is worthy to enter the temple. Additionally, members seek guidance from the bishop in overcoming personal challenges. Serious sins must be confessed to the bishop who helps members through the repentance process. In some cases, the bishop presides over a church membership council where the outcome can include formal or informal membership restrictions or withdrawal of membership, depending on the severity of the sin and the attitude of the member. Additionally, the bishop also has the authority and duty to counsel members on spiritual matters, and sits as a &quot;common judge&quot; in the event of disputes between ward members. Bishops typically withdraw from involvement in matters which have been taken to the law.
*Provide temporally for the members of the ward – The bishop also has the responsibility to oversee the payment of tithes and offerings in a ward, including the duty to accurately account for all money donated. The bishop also has the authority to authorize financial assistance, specifically the disbursement of fast offerings donated to help the poor, and other assistance to members, according to the church&#x27;s guidelines. Bishops can also provide &quot;in kind&quot; assistance in the form of food and household goods from the bishop&#x27;s storehouse (which is managed by the Presiding Bishop [see below]). The bishop disburses funds, authorizes distribution of food from the bishop&#x27;s storehouse, or provides other appropriate assistance after evaluating the needs of the family and the resources available in the ward.
*Serve as the presiding high priest for the ward – As the presiding high priest, the bishop leads meetings and has the priesthood authority to issue callings, approve the performance of ordinances, such as baptisms and the administration of the sacrament. The high priests that reside in several wards that form a stake are part of a quorum led by the stake president. In the ward, the bishop gives direction to and coordinates the efforts of the elders quorum president in performing their duties. (In each stake, the members of ward bishoprics, the stake high council, and any functioning patriarch form the stake high priest quorum, presided over by members of the stake presidency.)
*Organize and manage the other organizations in the ward – The bishop is responsible for calling and setting apart a local president for each of the church&#x27;s organizations. These organizations are the Sunday School, Relief Society, Young Men, Young Women, and Primary. He also calls and sets apart Aaronic priesthood quorum and Young Women class presidents. The bishopric then approves the recommendations made by each organizational or quorum president for two counselors, a secretary, instructors, and other callings. In doing this, the bishop strives to help manage the time donated by members of the ward.

=== Branch presidents ===
In small congregations that are not large enough to be a ward, a holder of the Melchizedek priesthood is usually called to be the branch president. In rare instances where no worthy Melchizedek priesthood holder is available, a priest in the Aaronic priesthood may instead be called as the branch president. The branch president generally has the same responsibilities as a bishop and is assisted by two counselors. A branch president and his counselors may or may not be a high priest, and a branch president is not ordained to the priesthood office of bishop.

=== Presiding Bishop ===

The LDS Church also has a Presiding Bishop who oversees the temporal affairs of the church (including its welfare services) and provides assistance and instruction to the various bishoprics worldwide.

=== Traveling bishops ===

The calling of &quot;traveling bishop&quot; was prominent during the early Utah period of church history from roughly the 1850s-1880s. Traveling bishops were not assigned to a specific congregation, but were tasked to visit various wards and branches to take care and supervise over temporal matters.

==Bishops in the Community of Christ==
In many ways bishops of the Community of Christ continue to resemble those found in the church prior to the death of Joseph Smith. They are not pastors or branch presidents, but financial officers and ministers of stewardship. While in theory a literal descendant of Aaron could hold this office, no such claim has ever been made, and therefore all bishops are members of the high priesthood, as a high priest can serve in any &quot;lesser office&quot;. All bishops are members of the Order of Bishops, with presidency vested in the Presiding Bishopric (consisting of the Presiding Bishop and two counselors).

While all bishops are attached to a congregation (in the sense that every member of the church has a home congregation), bishops are not congregational officers, but preside as financial officers over larger jurisdictions, or support those who do. For example, each mission center will have a bishop in charge of all the finances of that area, who may be assisted by other bishops. Likewise, some nations have a national bishop, and historically, stakes also had bishops. Consequently, this makes the office of bishop somewhat uncommon. In recent years, some mission centers have had multiple bishops in order to help promote the various ministries associated with good stewardship.

Other bishops have been appointed as &quot;field bishops&quot; who are assigned to assist one of the twelve apostles. The Presiding Bishopric is also regarded as the presidency of the entire Aaronic priesthood. Bishops in general are therefore sometimes seen as ideal resources to provide support and mentoring to local members of the Aaronic priesthood.

<doc id="1236581" wikidata="Q1360724" url="?curid=1236581" title="Gary Suter">
<text>Gary Lee Suter (born June 24, 1964) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman who played over 1,000 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) between 1985 and 2002. He was a ninth round selection of the Calgary Flames, 180th overall, at the 1984 NHL Entry Draft and played with Calgary for nine years. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top rookie in 1986, played in four All-Star Games and was a member of Calgary&#x27;s Stanley Cup championship team in 1989. He was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in 1994, then to the San Jose Sharks in 1998, with whom he finished his career.

Suter represented the United States internationally on numerous occasions. He appeared in two World Championships and two Canada Cup tournaments. He was a member of the American team that won the inaugural World Cup of Hockey in 1996 and was a two-time Olympian, winning a silver medal in 2002. Suter is an honored member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, inducted in 2011.

==Early life==
Suter was born on June 24, 1964, in Madison, Wisconsin. He is the youngest of five children, all of whom were heavily involved in sports. Gary followed his three elder brothers, John, Bob and Steve into hockey, while his sister was a figure skater. Their father Marlow was a senior player in the 1950s, and helped found and coach the Madison Capitols minor hockey system that all four boys played with in their youth. Gary idolized his brother Bob, who was a member of the American &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics.

After playing his junior and senior seasons of high school hockey with the Culver Military Academy, Suter joined the Dubuque Fighting Saints program in the United States Hockey League (USHL). He appeared in 18 games with the Fighting Saints in the 1981–82 season, scoring 3 goals and 7 points. He was eligible for the 1982 NHL Entry Draft, but listed at five feet, nine inches tall by the Central Scouting Bureau, was considered too small for the NHL and went undrafted. Suter established himself as one of the first star players in the USHL&#x27;s junior era, improving to 39 points in 41 games in 1982–83 and leading Dubuque to the Clark Cup championship. The team&#x27;s captain, he also led Dubuque to a national junior championship. He was again passed over by the NHL in the 1983 Draft, but accepted a full scholarship to play at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Suter was the third member of his family to play defense for the Wisconsin Badgers, following brothers John and Bob. He appeared in 34 games in 1983–84, scoring 22 points. Ian McKenzie, coordinator of scouting for the Calgary Flames, noticed Suter&#x27;s play at Wisconsin and that he had added over two inches of height, which Central Scouting had failed to update in its record on him. The Flames picked Suter with their ninth round selection, 180th overall, in the 1984 Draft. Suter, who had been working in a beer factory, was initially disappointed at his selection. He was in his last year of draft eligibility and was hoping to follow other college players who signed lucrative contracts as free agents after going unselected. Following his sophomore season of 1984–85, in which he recorded 51 points in 39 games for Wisconsin, Suter left Wisconsin to turn professional.

==Playing career==

===Calgary Flames===
The departure of Kari Eloranta prior to the 1985–86 NHL season created an opening on the Flames&#x27; defense. Suter excelled in training camp and not only earned a spot on the team, he was quickly recognized by head coach Bob Johnson as the team&#x27;s best overall defenseman. He scored his first two goals in his second NHL game, a 9–2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, and by mid-season was among the NHL&#x27;s rookie scoring leaders. He was one of two first-year players (along with Wendel Clark) to play in the 1986 All-Star Game, while his offensive production and ability to play in all situations made him a top contender for the Calder Memorial Trophy. Suter finished the season with 18 goals, and his 68 points tied Al MacInnis for the team lead for scoring among defensemen. He added ten points in ten playoff games, but was knocked out of the post-season in the Smythe Division Final against the Edmonton Oilers after suffering stretched knee ligaments following a hit by Mark Messier. Suter watched as the Flames reached, and ultimately lost, the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals to the Montreal Canadiens. Following the season, he was named to the All-Rookie Team on defense and was voted the winner of the Calder Trophy. Suter was the third American-born player to win the award, given to the NHL&#x27;s top rookie.

The knee injury hampered Suter throughout much of the 1986–87 season; he attempted to play through it, but ultimately missed 12 games. Nonetheless, he still scored 49 points in 68 games played. Healthy for 1987–88, Suter had the finest season of his career. His 70 assists and 91 points were the highest single season totals he would record in his career. He played in his second All-Star Game, was named a second team All-Star and was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top defenseman. Suter appeared in his third All-Star Game in 1988–89, but missed 16 games after undergoing an emergency appendectomy. He had 62 points in 63 games. As had happened in 1986, Suter was injured in the early stages of a deep post-season run by the Flames. He missed most of the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs after suffering a broken jaw in Calgary&#x27;s opening round series against the Vancouver Canucks. He watched as the team won the Stanley Cup in six games over Montreal.

Suter reached the 70-point mark in the next two seasons, finishing with 76 in 1989–90 and 70 in 1990–91. His latter campaign earned him his fourth All-Star Game appearance. Suter also played much of the season while awaiting trial after he was arrested following a June 1990 scuffle with police as they tried to arrest fellow NHL player Chris Chelios. The issue was resolved in February 1991 when he agreed to a plea bargain on reduced charges and paid an $8,250 fine. A knee injury caused Suter to miss ten games in 1991–92, but he reached two milestones during the season. He scored his 100th career goal on February 25, 1992, against the Buffalo Sabres, and played in his 500th game on March 12 against the Philadelphia Flyers.

A career-high 23 goals led Suter&#x27;s 81-point campaign in 1992–93, but he again struggled with a pair of knee injuries that caused him to miss three months of the 1993–94 season and limited him to 25 games for the Flames. His tenure with Calgary ended on March 10, 1994, when the team included him in a six-player trade. The Flames sent Suter (along with Paul Ranheim and Ted Drury) to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for James Patrick, Zarley Zalapski and Michael Nylander. The move surprised Suter: &quot;Calgary&#x27;s meant a great deal to me. You always hear how trades are part of the game and that you don&#x27;t have any control over them. When it happens, it&#x27;s a shock. It just blows me away.&quot;

===Chicago Blackhawks===
Suter&#x27;s tenure with the Whalers lasted only one day, as Hartford immediately traded him to the Chicago Blackhawks (along with Randy Cunneyworth and a draft pick) in exchange for František Kučera and Jocelyn Lemieux. Suter appeared in 16 regular season games with the Blackhawks, finishing the season with 41 games played and 18 points combined between Calgary and Chicago. He quickly established a place alongside Chris Chelios as the team&#x27;s top defensive pair. In his first full season in Chicago, Suter was looked upon to serve as a team leader and played a key role with the team&#x27;s power play. He appeared in all 48 games of the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, scoring 37 points, but missed several playoff games after suffering a broken hand against the Vancouver Canucks.

With 67 points in 1995–96, Suter was named to an All-Star team for the fifth time, but a knee injury prevented him from participating in the contest. The 1996–97 season was one of frustration for Suter, as he battled a season-long slump that saw him go 26 games without scoring goal at one point early in the season, then 21 games without a point late. He finished with 28 points, compared to an average of 69 in his previous nine campaigns.

In the final year of his contract with Chicago, Suter improved to 42 points in 1997–98. When attempts to negotiate a new deal during the season failed, the team publicly shopped his playing rights around the NHL late in the season but failed to complete a trade. Chicago&#x27;s best contract offer was a two-year proposal that would have paid Suter $1.85 million per season. Unable to reach terms following the season, the Blackhawks quietly traded his negotiating rights to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for a ninth-round pick a few days before he would have become an unrestricted free agent. He subsequently signed a three-year, $10 million contract with San Jose.

===San Jose Sharks===
Suter played only one game for the Sharks in the 1998–99 season, missing virtually the entire campaign after a microbe in his triceps caused an infection that required three surgeries to alleviate. During treatment, doctors also discovered a hole in his heart that required another surgery to correct. At age 35, Suter said he never contemplated retirement due to the ailments as he wanted to repay the Sharks for their support of him. He agreed to defer a portion of his salary that year to allow San Jose to sign a replacement player. Suter returned for the 1999–2000 season healthy and played over 20 minutes per game as San Jose&#x27;s most experienced defenseman.

Reaching a career milestone, Suter played in his 1,000th NHL game on October 25, 2000, scoring a goal in a 3–1 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. He said the achievement meant a lot to him given both the ailments he overcame and that he was dismissed by critics as unlikely to play in the NHL when he was drafted in 1984. Suter finished the regular season with 34 points, but missed nearly the entire playoffs after suffering a concussion in the Sharks&#x27; first playoff game.

Signing a new one-year contract, Suter returned to San Jose for a final season in 2001–02 in which he scored 33 points, including his 200th career goal, against the Philadelphia Flyers on January 2, 2002. He announced his retirement as a player following the season.

===International===
Suter made his international debut with the American national junior team at the 1984 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships where he recorded a goal and an assist in seven games. He was playing college hockey with Wisconsin when he made his debut with the senior team at the 1985 World Championship. One of his team&#x27;s top players in the tournament, he was named co-MVP of Team USA. Suter played in a second World Championship in 1992.

Suter&#x27;s international career was marred by three controversial incidents. The first came during the 1987 Canada Cup, when he was the target of international criticism following a violent confrontation with Andrei Lomakin in a game against the Soviet Union. Following a physical battle, Lomakin speared Suter in the neck, and Suter retaliated with a &quot;baseball swing&quot; that broke his stick across Lomakin&#x27;s face, causing a gash that required 20 stitches to close. Suter was given a six-game suspension from international competition by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), while the NHL assessed a four-game ban of its own.

Suter was again vilified during the 1991 Canada Cup, after he knocked Canada&#x27;s Wayne Gretzky out of the tournament with a check into the boards from behind in the first game of the best-of-three final. Gretzky forgave Suter for the hit, noting he was usually a clean player. In the second game, Suter was responsible for two turnovers that led to goals, including what proved to be the championship-winning marker in a 4–2 victory for Canada. However, Suter would avenge this loss five years later, as he was a member of the American team that defeated Canada to win the inaugural World Cup of Hockey in 1996.

The third incident occurred during an NHL game shortly before the 1998 Winter Olympics while Suter was a member of the Chicago Blackhawks. In a game against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, he cross-checked star Anaheim forward Paul Kariya in the head as Kariya celebrated a goal. The hit gave Kariya a concussion and prevented him from participating in the Olympic tournament, at which he had been expected to represent Canada. The NHL gave Suter a four-game suspension that carried through the Olympic tournament, but the IIHF allowed him to play, a decision that incensed Canadian officials and resulted in Suter receiving a death threat from an angry Canadian fan.

At age 38 and in the final season of his playing career, Suter appeared in his second Olympics, playing in the 2002 tournament in Salt Lake City. He recorded one assist in six games for the silver medal-winning American team. The medal came 22 years after his brother Bob&#x27;s gold in 1980. In recognition of his career and achievements, Suter was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Off the ice==
Suter returned to Wisconsin following his playing career, settling in the rural community of Minocqua where he and his wife Cathy raised their family. They have two sons, Jake and Jared, both of whom also play hockey. Jake was a defenseman for the UMass Lowell River Hawks. In addition to his sons, several of Suter&#x27;s nephews are also defensemen. Among them is Bob&#x27;s son Ryan, who also plays in the NHL and is an Olympian, and whom Gary considered unretiring to play with when the younger Suter was drafted by the Nashville Predators in 2003. Instead, he turned to coaching, working with the Madison Capitols program, as well as assisting with the Lakeland Union High School T-Birds in Minocqua. Gary is one of several members of the Suter family who operate a youth hockey camp in Madison that was held for the 17th year in 2012.

<doc id="1236583" wikidata="Q1650274" url="?curid=1236583" title="Piper PA-25 Pawnee">
<text>The PA-25 Pawnee is an agricultural aircraft produced by Piper Aircraft between 1959 and 1981. It remains a widely used aircraft in agricultural spraying and is also used as a tow plane, or tug, for launching gliders or for towing banners. In 1988, the design rights and support responsibility were sold to Latino Americana de Aviación of Argentina.

==Design and development==
Most agricultural aircraft before 1949 were converted military aircraft and it was in that year that Fred Weick, based at Texas A&amp;M University, designed a dedicated agricultural aircraft: the AG-1. The AG-1 first flew on 1 December 1950.

During 1953, Fred Weick was approached by Piper to become a consultant on the agricultural version of the PA-18, the PA-18A, in particular to design and test a distributor for dust and seeds. A few weeks later, Piper sponsored Texas A&amp;M University to design a dedicated agricultural aircraft based on the AG-1 but to use as many PA-18A and PA-22 components as possible. The resulting design, the AG-3, was smaller than the AG-1 and had a steel tube fuselage which was fabric covered. The AG-3 was a single-seat, low-wing monoplane with the wings braced to the fuselage with struts. It had a conventional landing gear with a tailwheel and was powered by a 135 hp engine. The single seat was placed high in the fuselage to give the best visibility and an 800 lb-capacity hopper was fitted in front of the cockpit.

The AG-3 made its maiden flight in November 1954. The aircraft&#x27;s flying tests were successful and, in 1957, Weick was invited to join Piper at Vero Beach, and the AG-3 was renamed the PA-25 Pawnee. The engine was upgraded to a 150 hp Lycoming O-320-A1A engine. Two pre-production aircraft were built at Vero Beach in 1957 and production started at Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, in May 1959.

In 1962, another prototype was built at Vero Beach with a 235 hp Lycoming O-540-B2B5 engine and production aircraft were produced at Lock Haven from 1962. In 1964, the Pawnee B was introduced with a larger hopper and improved dispersal gear. The Pawnee C of 1967 was fitted with oleo shock-absorbers and other improvements; also in 1967, a 260 hp variant was introduced.

Early models of the Pawnee had a single fuel tank located between the agricultural hopper and the engine. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended to Piper Aircraft that the early model PA-25&#x27;s with a fiberglass fuel tank be retrofitted with a rubber fuel cell to minimize the chance of catastrophic failure and fire resulting from a crash.

In 1974, the Pawnee D was introduced, with the fuel tanks moved from the fuselage to the wings; the 260 hp variant was also available with either a fixed pitch or constant-speed propeller. Although still the same design as the &quot;D&quot;, the 1980 and 1981 production aircraft were marketed as the Pawnee. The final production aircraft was completed at Lock Haven on 22 March 1981, the last of 5,167 Pawnees.

A useful design aspect was the ability to carry a mechanic on a jump seat fitted in the hopper to assist with operations at remote stations.

On April 15, 1988, Piper Aircraft, Inc. officially sold the PA-25 series aircraft to Latino Americana de Aviación S.A in Argentina. The sale included all drawings, engineering data, parts inventory, tools, catalogs, and manuals. All support of any nature became the responsibility of the new owners.

In 2019, Australia&#x27;s Civil Aviation Safety Authority formally approved the issuing to eTugs of Certificates of Airworthiness in the Limited category for the purpose of glider towing. An etug is a PA-25 where the Lycoming engine has been replaced with a General Motors LS automotive engine. The advantages for glider towing, compared to a Lycoming powered PA-25, include a greater rate of climb, reduced fuel consumption, the elimination of shock cooling (since the LS is water-cooled rather than air-cooled) and a less costly maintenance regime.

==Accidents and incidents==
*9 August 1974 a crop-spraying Pawnee was involved in a fatal mid-air collision in Norfolk, UK with a Royal Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4M Phantom FGR.2.
*3 September 2023 a PA-25 used in a gender reveal party had its left wing separated from its fuselage, and then crashed, killing the pilot.
*18 May 2014, the pilot of a Piper PA-25, registered VH-SSO, took off from Bacchus Marsh aeroplane landing area (ALA) with a glider in tow. During climb the pilot noticed a momentary engine power loss, following which the glider pilot released the tow rope. The pilot of the PA-25 immediately re-joined the circuit via the downwind leg. The engine responded normally to throttle inputs following the momentary power loss, but after the pilot turned onto the base leg of the circuit, the engine surged briefly then stopped. The pilot conducted a forced landing but the aircraft landed heavily and was substantially damaged. The pilot was uninjured. Subsequent inspection found that the aircraft fuel supply was exhausted.
* 20 March 2015, a pilot of a Piper PA 25-235/A9 Pawnee aircraft, registered VH-NLP, departed a private airstrip in Victoria, Australia near Derrinallum to conduct insect baiting operations on a property near Darlington, Victoria. Shortly after commencing that task, the aircraft collided with terrain and was destroyed by impact forces and a post-impact fire. The pilot, who was the sole occupant, was fatally injured.

<text>Schwandorf is a town in the Upper Palatinate in Bavaria, Germany, which is the seat of the Schwandorf district. It lies on the river Naab.

== Geography ==

=== Geographical location ===

Schwandorf is located at the intersection of four depressions in the Schwandorf Bay in the southern Upper Palatinate Forest. The Upper Palatinate Lake District borders the city area. The Naab River runs through the city area from north to south. Nature has created a broad plain in the Naab Valley, the edges of which are formed by iron sandstone hills. The Kreuzberg rises from the plain like a green island. This was once far outside the city gates, but today it is surrounded by the settlement.

The main rivers of the district are the Naab and the Regen

=== Climate ===
The climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot;. (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

== History ==

Schwandorf was first mentioned in writing in 1006 AD in a document from the monastery of Saint Emmeram as &quot;Suainicondorf&quot; on the river &quot;Naba&quot; ( Naab ) in the area of the diocese of Regensburg . Prehistoric finds, for example a fishing hook from the Bronze Age or urn graves from the Urnfield period (1200 to 800 BC) in the city area, as well as research into the origin of the city&#x27;s name, make it certain that the town was settled very early on. In 1234 AD, Schwandorf in the Upper Palatinate was the seat of a Wittelbach office, in 1286 it was the seat of a dean and, from an ecclesiastical point of view, one of the centers of the diocese of Regensburg in the Nordgau. On 5 January 1299, the market town received a municipal constitution, and from 1446 onwards it was granted full city rights.

During the Landshut War of Succession, Schwandorf was almost completely destroyed in 1504. From 1555 to 1617, Schwandorf was Evangelical Lutheran for three generations as a result of the Peace of Augsburg, which Ottheinrich von Wittelsbach, Count Palatine of Palatinate-Neuburg, had signed up to, and belonged to the Principality of Palatinate-Neuburg until Bavarian unification in 1777. Despite its political peripheral location (border town), Schwandorf remained an economic hub due to its location on an old trade and military route to Bohemia. Most of the town&#x27;s buildings that are still standing today were built in the 16th century. The town&#x27;s economic power increased after the Nuremberg–Schwandorf–Regensburg railway line was opened on December 12, 1859. Since 1863, with the opening of the railway line to Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Schwandorf became an important railway junction.

In 1907, 6,985 citizens lived in Schwandorf. Of these, 6,618 were Catholic, 333 Protestant, 19 Israelite, 1 Mennonite and 14 of unknown faith.

In 1933, 29 people of Jewish origin lived in Schwandorf. Louis Waldmann committed suicide in the Charlottenhof district in 1939, and nine other Schwandorf residents were deported and murdered. There are 17 stumbling blocks for them in Schwandorf.

At the end of the Second World War, on April 5, 1945, the train station was attacked for the second time by low-flying aircraft. On April 10, 1945, at 1:45 p.m., eight US low-flying planes fired on a train in Schwandorf. On April 17, 1945, between 3:52 a.m. and 4:07 a.m., Canadian and British Royal Air Force bombers with 167 Lancasters and eight Mosquitos bombed the train station in Schwandorf. The bombardment with 633.3 tons of bombs also devastated the city center as far as the Kreuzberg district. A total of 1,250 people, including refugees and displaced persons and 495 Schwandorf residents, died in this air raid. A total of 514 houses were damaged and 674 completely destroyed. Before the attack, Schwandorf had 1,361 buildings. The station district was particularly hard hit; countless passengers died on the trains that were hit. Because the railway line was largely destroyed, a train transport with around 1,000 prisoners from the Flossenbürg concentration camp stopped near Schwandorf on April 19. When an airplane appeared, panic ensued and some prisoners tried to escape. A total of 41 prisoners were killed, 111 managed to escape. Two groups of 417 and 389 prisoners had to march on south.  A few days later, on April 23, 1945, the first US units reached the town of Schwandorf. The town was then occupied by American troops of the 3rd Army as they advanced to a demarcation line in western and southern Bohemia agreed upon in the Potsdam Agreement. It came under the control of the American military government and reconstruction began. The reconstruction of Schwandorf continued for many years after this air raid.

The town of Schwandorf was a district-free town from 1920 to 1972. In the course of an administrative reform, it was incorporated into the newly founded large district on July 1, 1972, became the seat of the district administration and was given the designation of large district town .

On December 28, 1972, the name of the town of &quot;Schwandorf in Bavaria&quot; was officially changed to &quot;Schwandorf&quot; .

=== Founding ===
The Naab was probably the reason for the founding of the town. Here in the shallow Schwandorf Bay, the river divides into three branches and is so shallow that it is easy to ford through the water. Even in Roman times, the Naab was an important trade route from south to north. The intersection of the road and the river was ideal for a settlement. A landing stage was documented as early as 1158. Salt and iron were among the most important trade goods.
With the help of salt, the fish of the Naab became a commodity. Numerous natural and artificial ponds were also managed. The abundance of fish and its management led to the introduction of a fish master&#x27;s office in the Nordgau, the first evidence of which dates back to the 13th century.

Carp, bream, tench, zander, eels, catfish, barbel, nase, perch and pike can still be caught today. Crayfish were once so numerous that they could be caught by hand and taken to market in wheelbarrows.

Mills powered by the water power of the Naab were another source of livelihood.

Today, hydropower is only used to generate electricity in the city. Freight shipping has also long since stopped. Canoes and kayaks have taken their place. Pond farming is still an economic factor, while river fishing is carried out by sports and fishing clubs.

In the urban area, the following streams feed the Naab: Fensterbach, Els, Rotha, Haselbach with Irlbach, Göggelbach, Blauer Entengraben and Martelgraben.

<text>Anthony James &quot;Tony O&quot; Esposito (April 23, 1943 – August 10, 2021) was a Canadian-American professional ice hockey goaltender, who played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL), 15 of those for the Chicago Black Hawks. He was one of the pioneers of the now popular butterfly style. Tony was the younger brother of Phil Esposito, a centre. Both brothers had notable careers and are enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame. Esposito&#x27;s jersey number 35 was retired by the Blackhawks in 1988.

Esposito won the NHL&#x27;s Vezina Trophy, then awarded to the goaltender(s) of the team which allowed the fewest goals in the regular season, three times, most notably in 1970, when he recorded the modern (since 1942) NHL record of 15 shutouts in a season. He was also awarded the Calder Trophy as the best rookie in the league that season. He was named to the league&#x27;s First All-Star Team three times and to the Second All-Star Team two times, and served as one of Canada&#x27;s two goaltenders in the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union. In 2017 Esposito was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Hockey career==
===Early years===
Esposito grew up in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario with his brother, fellow future NHL star Phil Esposito. Phil described why Tony wound up playing goalie as a child: &quot;Tony and I would play by ourselves or we&#x27;d get two other guys and practice shooting. One guy would be the goaltender and the others would shoot and the guy with the fewest goals would take over in goal. Tony won&#x27;t like me saying this, but he always lost. I guess you could say that&#x27;s how he wound up as a goalie.&quot; He played college ice hockey for Michigan Tech.

A three-year hockey varsity letter winner, Esposito was a three-time first-team All-America selection. He was a driving force in helping the Michigan Tech Huskies to the 1964–65 NCAA Championship and was named a first-team NCAA All-Tournament Team choice in 1965. Esposito was also a three-time All-WCHA first-team selection. In 2021, Esposito was named to the WCHA All-Decade Team for the 1960s.

Esposito turned professional with the Vancouver Canucks in the Western Hockey League in 1967–68 and played with the Houston Apollos in the Central Hockey League in 1968–69.

He first played in the NHL for the Montreal Canadiens during the 1968–69 season at age 25. He was only the third American college player selected by an NHL team. Esposito made his NHL debut against the Oakland Seals, playing 26 minutes in relief of Rogie Vachon. His first NHL start was against the Boston Bruins, then led by his brother Phil. The game ended in a 2–2 tie, in which Phil scored both goals for Boston and Tony made 33 saves. Esposito played thirteen regular-season games, due to both Gump Worsley and Vachon being injured. However, Esposito returned to the minor leagues when they both returned from their injuries. Worsley was injured again during the playoffs, so Esposito was called again. He served as backup to Vachon, dressing for all four games in the Finals as Montreal won the Stanley Cup, with Esposito having his name engraved on there as a winning member. As the Canadiens club was deep in goaltenders at that time, with Worsley, Vachon, and other prospects in the system, Esposito was left unprotected by the Canadiens in 1969.

===Rise to fame===
For the 1969–70 season, the Chicago Black Hawks claimed him from Montreal on waivers, known at the time as the &quot;intra-league draft&quot;. Esposito had a spectacular season with Chicago, posting a 2.17 GAA and setting a modern-day NHL record with fifteen shutouts, for which he won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s best rookie. He also took the Vezina Trophy (then awarded to the goalies for the team which allowed the fewest goals during the regular seasons) and was named to the First All-Star team at season&#x27;s end. He also was runner-up for league MVP (Hart Memorial Trophy). It was during this record-setting season that he earned the nickname &quot;Tony O&quot; for his shutout abilities, with the big letter O looking like the big zero that he kept holding opponents to. In 1970–71, he again proved to be one of the league&#x27;s top goalies and helped Chicago finish first in the NHL&#x27;s West division. The Black Hawks made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, but lost in seven games to Montreal. The following season he posted the lowest GAA of his career (1.77) and shared the Vezina with backup Gary Smith. He was again selected to the NHL&#x27;s First All-Star team.

Esposito was named to Team Canada for the Summit Series of September 1972. He was the first goalie to earn a win against the Soviets, splitting Canada&#x27;s goaltending duties with Montreal&#x27;s Ken Dryden. Esposito posted both the lowest GAA and the highest save percentage of the three goalies (Esposito, Ken Dryden, and Vladislav Tretiak) who appeared in the series. Tony&#x27;s brother Phil had an exceptional series as well and was the inspirational leader of the team.

Despite the loss of Bobby Hull, Esposito and the Hawks led their division in 1972–73, but lost the Stanley Cup in six games to Montreal. Esposito was named to the NHL&#x27;s Second All-Star team that year. The next season, 1973–74, was another brilliant season with a sparkling 2.04 GAA and 10 shutouts. Esposito won his third Vezina, sharing it with the Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; Bernie Parent, and was again named a Second Team All-Star.

The Black Hawks declined over the next few seasons although Esposito remained among the top netminders in the NHL. In 1979–80, Esposito enjoyed a fine season with six shutouts and made the First All-Star team for the third time. In 1981, he became a naturalized American citizen and played for Team USA in the Canada Cup (he had previously represented Canada at the 1977 Ice Hockey World Championship tournament). He played a few more seasons in Chicago before retiring after the 1983–84 season.

===Goaltending style===
Esposito wrote:

==Distinctions==
Esposito is one of eight goalies to have won the Vezina catching the puck right-handed (that is, he was left-handed, using his dominant left hand for his stick and blocker). The other seven are fellow Black Hawks&#x27; legend Charlie Gardiner (in 1932 and 1934), the New York Rangers&#x27; Davey Kerr (1940), ambidextrous Montreal goalie Bill Durnan (1944–1947, 1949 and 1950), the New York Rangers&#x27; Gilles Villemure (1971), Tom Barrasso of the Buffalo Sabres (1984), Edmonton Oilers&#x27; Grant Fuhr (1988), and José Théodore of the Montreal Canadiens in 2002.

Esposito was the second NHL player to wear the number 35, a common number now worn by many goaltenders. Minnesota North Star goaltender Fern Rivard was the first to wear 35 during the 1968-69 NHL season. It was assigned to him during training camp prior to Chicago&#x27;s 1969–70 season because the standard goalie numbers 1 and 30 were already assigned. After posting a shutout in his first exhibition game for the team, he chose to keep wearing the number. His number 35 was retired by the Blackhawks on November 20, 1988.

Esposito was noted as being superstitious, becoming upset by crossed hockey sticks, and regularly lining up his hockey sticks in a particular way.
Esposito also has the record for most Consecutive Stanley Cup playoff losses at 16.

Esposito wore contact lenses throughout his career.

==Retirement==
He retired from professional play in 1984 and was named to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1988. His number 35 was retired by the Blackhawks on November 20, 1988.

Esposito later became General Manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins. During his tenure, Esposito selected Mark Recchi at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft and traded for goaltender Tom Barrasso. In 1991, when his brother helped found the Tampa Bay Lightning, Phil hired Tony as chief scout. Both Espositos were fired in 1998 after the team was sold.

In 1998, he was ranked number 79 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, 61 places behind his brother Phil, who ranked number 18.

In 2007, Tony was inducted, alongside his brother Phil, into the Sault Ste. Marie Walk of Fame.

On March 19, 2008, the Chicago Blackhawks honoured Esposito with &quot;Tony Esposito Night&quot;, where he was formally introduced as an Ambassador for the Blackhawks organization. Then-Blackhawk goaltenders Patrick Lalime and Nikolai Khabibulin both wore Esposito&#x27;s #35 on their jerseys in the pre-game warmups, and Khabibulin recorded a shutout in a Hawks 5–0 win over the Washington Capitals.

In 2024, Tony was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1236592" wikidata="Q4830557" url="?curid=1236592" title="Axiom of projective determinacy">
<text>In mathematical logic, projective determinacy is the special case of the axiom of determinacy applying only to projective sets.

The axiom of projective determinacy, abbreviated PD, states that for any two-player infinite game of perfect information of length ω in which the players play natural numbers, if the victory set (for either player, since the projective sets are closed under complementation) is projective, then one player or the other has a winning strategy.

The axiom is not a theorem of ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent), but unlike the full axiom of determinacy (AD), which contradicts the axiom of choice, it is not known to be inconsistent with ZFC. PD follows from certain large cardinal axioms, such as the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals.

==Consequences==
PD implies that all projective sets are Lebesgue measurable (in fact, universally measurable) and have the perfect set property and the property of Baire. It also implies that every projective binary relation may be uniformized by a projective set.

PD implies that for all positive integers formula_1, there is a largest countable formula_2 set.

<text>Nether Winchendon House is a manor house in Nether Winchendon, in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, England.

==History==
It was built on the site of an Augustinian priory that was a daughter house of Notley Abbey in Long Crendon. Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford bought and largely remodelled the priory in the 16th century.

In late 1771 the manor was bequeathed to Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet on the death of his cousin. He had served as governor of the provinces of New Jersey and Massachusetts Bay, where his uncompromising policies were instrumental in the events leading to the American Revolution. The house is still owned by the family.

The house and gardens are open to the public and the house is noted for its interior and is a grade I listed building.

==Filming location==
It was used as a filming location of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Ordeal by Innocence&quot; in 2007.
It was also one of the filming locations for Lenny Henry&#x27;s 1990&#x27;s BBC sitcom &quot;Chef!&quot;. The house was also featured in The Nest (2020 film).

Nether Winchendon House also hosts weddings.

<text>Tuomo Iisakki Ruutu (born 16 February 1983) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey forward and current assistant coach with the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League. Ruutu was drafted in the first round, ninth overall, at the 2001 NHL Entry Draft by the Chicago Blackhawks, the team he spent the first four seasons of his National Hockey League (NHL) career with, Ruutu has also played in the NHL for the Carolina Hurricanes and New Jersey Devils, before finishing his career with Davos of the Swiss National League (NL).

Ruutu is the younger brother of Jarkko Ruutu, a former ice hockey player, as well as Ottawa Senators European scout Mikko Ruutu.

==Playing career==
Ruutu started out playing for HIFK in the Finnish SM-liiga in the 1999–2000 season, and moved to Jokerit for the next two seasons. In 2002, he returned to HIFK for one more season. He was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, as their first-round pick, ninth overall. He then moved to North America in 2003, playing a full 82 games with the Blackhawks in the 2003–04 season.

Ruutu did not play during the 2004–05 NHL lockout, opting to take the time to recover from injuries, but provided commentary on Finnish television during the 2005 IIHF World Championship, along with fellow Finnish NHLer Ville Nieminen. Ruutu returned to the NHL after the lockout but his 2005–06 season was cut short, first by a back injury that kept him out of the game for most of the fall, then by an ankle injury sustained in January that required season-ending surgery.

After an unimpressive showing at the 2006 IIHF World Championship, Ruutu contemplated retirement from playing professionally. However, this notion was put to rest when Ruutu signed a two-year, $3.75 million contract extension with Chicago on 13 September.

During the 2007–08 season, on 26 February 2008, at the NHL trade deadline, the Blackhawks traded Ruutu to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Andrew Ladd. The Hurricanes promptly signed Ruutu to a one-year contract worth $2.25 million.

On 23 July 2009, the Hurricanes signed Ruutu to a three-year, $11.4 million contract extension, paying $3 million in 2009–10, $4 million in 2010–11 and $4.4 million in 2011–12.

On 22 February 2012, the Hurricanes signed Ruutu to a four-year contract extension worth $19 million. The deal paid Ruutu $4 million in 2012–13 and $5 million per year in the remaining years; it also included a no-trade clause for the first three years of the contract.

Just hours before the end of the NHL trade deadline on 5 March 2014, Ruutu was traded to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for centre Andrei Loktionov.

In the 2015–16 season, Ruutu could not stay healthy and tallied one assist in the final game of the season. Ruutu was not re-signed by the Devils once his contract expired, becoming an unrestricted free agent on 1 July 2016. After going through the summer unsigned, Ruutu agreed to a professional tryout with the Vancouver Canucks on 13 September.

On 11 October 2016, Canucks general manager Jim Benning announced Ruutu had been released from his PTO contract.

On 28 October 2016, Ruutu was signed by HC Davos for the remainder of the season as a replacement for the injured Daniel Rahimi. He made his NLA debut on 11 November 2016 and scored his first goal that same day in a 3–2 loss in Geneva against Genève-Servette HC.

==International play==






Ruutu represented Finland at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey and scored his first goal with the Finns in the final against Canada.

At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Ruutu won the bronze medal with Finland, and in 2011, he added a World Championship gold medal to his international resume. He has earned a medal in each of the 11 major international tournaments he has competed in.

Ruutu also played for Finland at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, as the Finns finished in third place, routing the United States 5–0 to claim bronze, with Ruutu recording an assist on Juuso Hietanen&#x27;s goal.

Ruutu played for Finland again at the 2015 World Championships, where the Finns were eliminated at the quarterfinal against the Czech Republic, marking just the second time Ruutu did not win a medal from an international tournament he took part in, the other being the 2004 World Cup where there&#x27;s nothing awarded to anyone other than the tournament winners.

<text>Jarkko Samuli Ruutu (); born 23 August 1975) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey forward who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Vancouver Canucks, Pittsburgh Penguins, Ottawa Senators and Anaheim Ducks. He is currently serving as a European development coach for the Columbus Blue Jackets.

== Playing career ==

Ruutu initially moved to North America to play college hockey with Michigan Tech of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). However, after his first year, he returned to Finland and turned professional with HIFK of the SM-liiga in 1996–97. In his draft year, he recorded 20 points in 37 games and was then drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in the third round, 68th overall, in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. He played one more season with HIFK before moving back to North America to play for the Canucks&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate at the time, the Syracuse Crunch.

Ruutu played his first full season with the Canucks in 2001–02 and earned himself a reputation as one of the NHL&#x27;s most effective &quot;pests&quot; or &quot;agitators&quot;. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he returned to play for HIFK and set a SM-liiga record for penalty minutes in a single season with 215 (since broken by Matt Nickerson).

Ruutu had his best NHL season to date statistically in the 2005–06 season, scoring 10 goals and 7 assists for 17 points in 82 games, while amassing 142 penalty minutes with the Canucks. In the off-season, Ruutu became a free agent on 1 July 2006, and signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins. He recorded his first three-point game in NHL during his second season with the Penguins on 27 March 2008, against the New York Islanders.

In July 2008, Ruutu signed with the Ottawa Senators to a three-year, $3.9 million contract. On 13 November 3, 2008, he was suspended two games for elbowing Maxim Lapierre in the head two days earlier in a game against the Montreal Canadiens.

In a game on 6 January 2009, Ruutu allegedly bit the gloved thumb of Buffalo Sabres&#x27; enforcer Andrew Peters during a first-period altercation, although he denied this in a post-game interview and claimed Peters had actually gouged his eye and stuck his fingers into Ruutu&#x27;s mouth. The next day, he was suspended for two games and fined $31,700 by the NHL for the incident.

On 17 February 2011, Ruutu was traded to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick in 2011. In his final season in the NHL, Ruutu played out remainder of his contract with the Ducks, appearing in 23 games for a goal and assist.

After his NHL career, Ruutu returned to the SM-Liiga to play for Jokerit on a three-year contract. His contract was not renewed after Jokerit left SM-Liiga to join the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in 2014. He completed his professional career playing four games with EHC Biel in the Swiss National League A (NLA) during the 2014–15 season before announcing his retirement as a player on 15 December 2014.

==International play==




Ruutu has appeared in six World Championships with Finland and has won silver medals in 1998, 2001 and 2007 and a bronze medal in 2006.

At the 2004 World Cup, Ruutu helped Finland to a second-place finish, losing the championship game to Canada.

Ruutu also won a silver medal with Finland at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He gained notoriety during the tournament when he checked Czech winger Jaromír Jágr to the boards while Jágr was crouching.

== Personal==
Ruutu is married to Sofia Ruutu (née Morelius), a Finnish model and blogger. The couple have two children and live in Töölö, Helsinki. His younger brother, Tuomo Ruutu, also played in the NHL, appearing in more than 700 games, and was mostly recently active with HC Davos in the Swiss NLA. His other brother, retired player Mikko Ruutu, is currently a scout for the Ottawa Senators. Jarkko Ruutu is also a second cousin of Hanno Möttölä, who became the first Finnish basketball player to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Ruutu&#x27;s cousin, Raul Ruutu, plays bass in Finnish pop rock band Sunrise Avenue.

<doc id="1236607" wikidata="Q1414859" url="?curid=1236607" title="Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche">
<text>The Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche is an American twin-engined cabin monoplane designed and built by Piper Aircraft. It was a twin-engined development of the PA-24 Comanche single-engined aircraft. A variant with counter-rotating propellers was designated the Piper PA-39 Twin Comanche C/R.

==Development==
The Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche was designed as a twin-engined variant of the Piper PA-24 Comanche. A complex light twin, with retractable landing gear, seating 4 (in original models) to 6 (in later models), and cruise speeds ranging from 160–210 mph on twin 160 horsepower engines, it competed with the more-powerful Cessna 310 and Beech Baron, and later with Piper&#x27;s other light twins.

The Twin Comanche was designed to replace the Piper Apache in the company&#x27;s lineup of products. The prototype was converted from the single-engined Comanche by Ed Swearingen who at the time operated a facility that specialized in the modification of production aircraft. A Comanche was modified with two 4-cylinder 160 hp (120 kW) Lycoming IO-320-B1A engines and first flew at San Antonio, Texas on 12 Apr 1961. The design was designated the PA-30 on March 17, 1962 and named the Twin Comanche. The prototype (registered N7000Y) was built at Lock Haven and first flew on November 7, 1962. FAA Type approval was awarded on February 5, 1963, the first production aircraft was completed on April 2, 1963 and the first delivery made on July 15, 1963.

The first Twin Commanche B was announced on September 2, 1965 with deliveries starting in November 1965. The aircraft had minor changes with two additional seats and an extra cabin window on each side. A turbocharged variant of the Twin Comanche B was available with 160 hp (120 kW) Lycoming IO-320-C1A engines.

In 1966, the PA-30-200 was developed with two 200 hp engines, the prototype first flew on January 16, 1967 but Piper decided not to put the variant into production. Following the cancellation of the PA-30-200, the company introduced the Twin Comanche C. It had a new interior, a different external paint scheme, and a higher cruise speed. First deliveries of the Twin Comanche C were made in November 1968. The last PA-30 was completed at Lock Haven on November 5, 1969 when it was replaced on the line by the PA-39.

During 1969, a number of developments to improve the flight characteristics of the PA-30 were tested which resulted in the Twin Comanche D with counter-rotating engines, the prototype first flying on September 23, 1969. For marketing reasons, the type was re-designated the PA-39 and received FAA Type Approval on November 28, 1969. The first production aircraft was completed on December 23, 1969.

The Twin Comanche was produced on the same Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, production line as its single-engined cousin; production ceased when the factory was flooded in 1972. Piper chose at that time to focus on its equally popular Cherokee 140/180/235/Arrow line, manufactured in Florida, and its highly popular twin-engined Seneca, which is essentially a Twin Cherokee Six. The Piper PA-40 Arapaho had been scheduled to replace the PA-39 in the 1973–74 timeframe. Three were manufactured, and the aircraft was already fully certified when the decision was made not to proceed with the manufacture.

==Design==
The Twin Comanche is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a retractable tricycle landing gear. With tip tanks, the aircraft holds 120 gallons (454 L) of fuel. Fuel burn at typical cruise settings is approximately 16 gal/h (58.7 L/h) with a cruise speed of 165 kn. It easily climbs to 18,000 feet (5,500 m) when desired (24,000 feet (7,300 m), if turbocharged). When compared with the Seminole, the Twin Comanche goes faster, carries more, burns less fuel, climbs more rapidly and ultimately higher, is quieter. When compared to the Seneca, which is really quite a different aircraft, the more noticeable differences are in handling. Another contemporary competitor to the Twin Comanche was the Beechcraft Travel Air. A similar airplane in form and function was the Gulfstream American GA-7 Cougar, which went into production after the Twin Comanche&#x27;s production run ended.

==Operational history==
The Twin Comanche suffered a number of VMC (Velocity Minimum Controllable) loss-of-control crashes in the 1960s and early 1970s. Initially, focus was placed on the aircraft design and the FAA reacted by issuing an airworthiness directive changing the VMC speed, though there was no change in the aerodynamics. At the time, well known aviation journalist, Richard L. Collins, was highly critical of the FAA&#x27;s multiengine training standards which encouraged unsafe VMC demonstrations at low altitude. Collins pointed out in another article that year that one FBO had suffered four fatal VMC roll-over spins. Two were in a Twin Comanche, One in a Beech Travel Air and one in a Beech Baron. It is not surprising that the Twin Comanche had a higher number of such crashes as it was used more often as a training aircraft. The FAA performed a series of flight tests on the Twin Comanche and NASA conducted wind tunnel tests and found no unusual tendency to spin beyond what would normally be expected given the airflow of the normally rotating propellers.

In the 1970s, the FAA changed its training standards and required flight instructors to obtain a separate rating to teach in multiengine aircraft. The VMC crashes dissipated dramatically. In 1997, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) Air Safety Institute published a safety review of the Comanche series aircraft and concluded that the Twin Comanche showed no greater tendency for VMC roll-over spins than comparable aircraft. Kristin Winter, a long time Twin Comanche instructor, operator, and trained accident investigator, reviewed the NTSB records for a ten-year period ending in 2014 and concluded that the Air Safety Institute&#x27;s report was correct in its conclusions. Of the six single engine loss of control crashes, most resulted from inexperienced pilots and substandard training.

Prince William of Gloucester bought a Twin Comanche and used it as his personal aircraft for several years in the 1960s. He flew it from the United Kingdom to Nigeria, where he held a diplomatic post; then later returned in it to the United Kingdom and flew it to Japan when he took up a diplomatic post in that country.

A Twin Comanche was flown in the 1992 and 1994 French Arc en Ciel air races. It is the only US aircraft to have raced twice around the world. In the pilot-skilled races, 1992 pilot and Pioneer Hall of Fame enshrinee and 100 Aviation Hero for the First Century of Flight, Marion P. Jayne and her daughter Nancy Palozola placed second. In 1994 Jayne and her daughter, Patricia Jayne (Pat) Keefer won the FAI Gold Medal in what, so far, is the longest race in history at over 21,000 miles flown May 1–24, 1994. With FAA approval the twin carried a total of 252 gallons in 11 tanks and at maximum power went over 2,100 miles nonstop between Marrakech, Morocco and Istanbul, Turkey in 11:19 hours.

All Twin Comanche engines have long times between overhaul (2000 hours for the B1A, 1800 for the IO-320-C1A) and have developed a reputation for reliability.

Following a string of crashes involving pilot loss-of-control in single-engine flight (due to engine failure, or in pilot training for engine-failure conditions), Piper sought to alter the plane&#x27;s single-engine behavior at low airspeeds (such as takeoff and landing). The resulting PA-39 Twin Comanche C/R was a modified version with counter-rotating engines (to eliminate the &quot;critical engine&quot; which, when failed, created the greatest risk of loss-of-control). The PA-39 replaced the PA-30 in the early 1970s. At least one comparative study of U.S. crash rates for the PA-30 and PA-39 indicated that crash rates for the counter-rotating PA-39 were only one-third of those for the conventional PA-30. Piper subsequently expanded the counter-rotating engine development to its other light twins.

As of November 3, 2019, 80 PA-39&#x27;s remain on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) registry.

==Variants==
Three versions of the PA-30 were produced: the original, a B model, and a C model. The B and C models can carry six passengers and can be identified by the additional side windows. Factory turbocharged engines became available with the B model. Turbo models can be identified by the presence of vents on the nacelle sides. These use Rajay turbochargers with manual wastegates operated by twin knobs under the throttle quadrant. They are properly termed &quot;turbonormalized&quot; since the compression ratio and maximum manifold pressure remained unchanged. Pilots are required to use care to avoid overboosting at low altitudes, since no overboost popoff valves are used. Since there is no accompanying power increase, the B/C models simply give owners a fuel vs. passenger tradeoff. The two rearmost seats, occupying the baggage compartment, are quite small.

<text>is a kaiju from Toho&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise who first appeared in the 1972 film, &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot;. Gigan is a giant extraterrestrial space monster, resembling a species of reptile, who was turned into a cyborg by the alien race known as the Nebulans. Gigan sports a huge buzzsaw in its frontal abdominal region, large metallic hooks for hands, and a birdlike beak. Gigan is considered one of Godzilla&#x27;s most brutal and violent opponents, and the first kaiju in the Toho sci-fi series to make him noticeably bleed. &quot;Complex&quot; listed the character as No. 2 on its &quot;The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time&quot; list.

==Overview==
Gigan debuts in the 1972 film &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot;, in which it and King Ghidorah are summoned to Earth by the M Space Hunter Nebula aliens, cockroach-like aliens whose planet had been ravaged by another race and wish to subjugate the Earth in order to create a utopia of &quot;perfect peace&quot;. However, the monsters are challenged and defeated by Godzilla and Anguirus. In the 1973 film, &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot;, Gigan is sent by the Nebulans to assist the people of Seatopia in their assault on humanity by aiding their god, Megalon, in a battle against Godzilla and Jet Jaguar. After having its arm broken by Jet Jaguar however, Gigan retreats into space, leaving Megalon to face Godzilla and Jet Jaguar alone. In the same year, Gigan also makes an appearance in Toho&#x27;s television series &quot;Zone Fighter&quot;. After his battle with Godzilla and Jet Jaguar, Gigan is captured by aliens called the Garogans and sent back to Earth to prevent Godzilla from rescuing Zone Fighter. It was temporarily defeated by the former, but revived once Godzilla left and faced Zone Fighter, who eventually killed Gigan.

After a 31-year absence, Gigan returned in the film &quot;&quot;. Millennia prior, it had fought Mothra for the fate of the Earth and was defeated. In the present, its mummified body is discovered in Hokkaido and revealed to be a weapon used by the alien Xiliens, who awaken Gigan to assist them in destroying Earth and destroy the flying battleship the &quot;Gotengo&quot; to stop its human occupants from awakening Godzilla. While the cyborg disables the battleship, the crew succeed. Gigan faces Godzilla in battle, but is defeated. The Xiliens recover and upgrade Gigan with new weapons to assist Monster X in fighting Godzilla and Mothra. Gigan faces Mothra once more and seemingly kills her, but inadvertently decapitates itself with its razor disks before a burning Mothra destroys it. 
Gigan returned in Gemstone&#x27;s &quot;GvG&quot; and &quot;Godzilla vs Gigan Rex&quot;, where Godzilla battles an army of soldiers known as Gigan Miles lead by the elite red-colored Gigan Rex.

===Development===
Created during the early 1970s, when the Godzilla films had undergone a comic book-like shift both in tone and special effects and were now purely science fiction fare, budgets were greatly reduced, so Gigan was designed as both a marketing ploy for children&#x27;s toys and as a completely alien creature whose design would not have necessitated the same attention to detail needed for Godzilla&#x27;s previously more earthly opponents.

The character was first conceived by Kaoru Mabuchi in his script &quot;Godzilla vs. the Space Monsters – Earth Defense Directive&quot;, which contained elements that would later be incorporated into &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot;, including having a mind-controlled Gigan teaming up with King Ghidorah, though the script also included Megalon and the mastermind behind the space monsters&#x27; actions was a living brain called Miko.

The first Gigan suit was designed by illustrator Takayoshi Mizuki, modeled by suitmaker Noboyuki Yasamaru, and was worn by Kenpachiro Satsuma, who had starred as Hedorah&#x27;s suit actor in &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; the year previously. The two initially did not get on well during filming, as Yasamaru focused more on the suit&#x27;s appearance than on its practicality, at one point making the character&#x27;s hand-hooks out of pure fiberglass, which made lifting them almost impossible. In portraying Gigan, Satsuma deliberately emphasized the character&#x27;s destructive personality. For Gigan&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Zone Fighter&quot;, Satsuma did not reprise the role. Special effects director Teruyoshi Nakano had initially wanted to give Gigan the ability to fire a laser beam from its forehead in homage to Buddhist art depicting the Buddha sporting a halo around his head, but the idea was scrapped, as Nakano felt that the character was already powerful enough. The beam was nevertheless included in some promotional stills, along with various Godzilla video games.

===Characteristics===
Gigan possesses an integrated jet pack to fly, a circular saw in his abdomen, and hooked blades in place of hands.

In &quot;Zone Fighter&quot;, the tips of the hooks were able to release an explosive charge on contact with an enemy.

The &quot;Godzilla: Final Wars&quot; version has grappling hooks in his arms, a plier at the end of his tail, and can shoot boomerang circular saw blades from his neck and a laser from his eyes. Later the Xiliens replaced his hooks with double-bladed chainsaws.

<text>The Piper PA-34 Seneca is a twin-engined light aircraft, produced in the United States by Piper Aircraft. It has been in non-continuous production since 1971. The Seneca is primarily used for personal and business flying as well as multi-engine class rating flight training.

==Development==
The Seneca was developed as a twin-engined version of the Piper Cherokee Six. The prototype was a Cherokee Six that had wing-mounted engines installed, retaining its nose engine. The prototype was flown as a tri-motor aircraft in the initial stages of the test-flying program.

===PA-34-180 Twin Six===
With the decision to abandon the three-engined design tested on the PA-32-3M, the PA-34 was developed as a twin-engined aircraft. The prototype PA-34-180 Twin Six, registered as &quot;N3401K&quot;, first flew on 25 April 1967. The prototype had two Lycoming O-360 engines, a fixed nosewheel landing gear and a Cherokee Six vertical tail. The second prototype flew on 30 August 1968, still with the Lycomings but had retractable landing gear and a taller vertical tail. During development flying the wingspan was increased by two feet. The third prototype was closer to the production standard and flew on 20 October 1969; it was fitted with Lycoming IO-360-A1A engines.

===PA-34-200 Seneca===
Certified on 7 May 1971 and introduced in late 1971 as a 1972 model, the PA-34-200 Seneca is powered by a pair of Lycoming IO-360-C1E6 engines. The righthand engine is a Lycoming LIO-360-C1E6 engine variant, the &quot;L&quot; in its designation indicating that the crankshaft turns in the opposite direction, giving the Seneca counter-rotating engines. The counter-rotating engines eliminate the critical engine limitations of other light twins and make the aircraft more controllable in the event of a shut down or failure of either engine. A total of 934 Seneca models were built, including one prototype.

The early Seneca models have a maximum gross weight of , while later serial numbers allowed a takeoff weight of .

===PA-34-200T Seneca II===

Responding to complaints about the aircraft&#x27;s handling qualities, Piper introduced the PA-34-200T Seneca II. The aircraft was certified on 18 July 1974 and introduced as a 1975 model.

The new model incorporated changes in the aircraft&#x27;s control surfaces, including enlarged and balanced ailerons, the addition of a rudder anti-servo tab, and a stabilator bobweight.

The &quot;T&quot; in the new model designation reflected a change to turbocharged, six-cylinder Continental TSIO-360E or EB engines for improved performance, particularly at higher altitudes. The Seneca II retained the counter-rotating engine arrangement of the earlier Seneca I.

The Seneca II also introduced optional &quot;club seating&quot; whereby the two center-row seats face rearwards and the two back seats face forward allowing more legroom in the passenger cabin. A total of 2,588 Seneca IIs were built.

Gross weights are for takeoff and for landing, with all weight in excess of required to be fuel.

===PA-34-220T Seneca III===

In 1981, the PA-34-220T Seneca III was introduced, having completed certification on 17 December 1980.

The change in model designation reflected an engine upgrade. Continental TSIO-360-KB engines were used which produced 220 horsepower (165 kW), although only rated as such for five minutes and then dropping to .

The horsepower increase, with the new engines limit of 2800 rpm (up from 2575 rpm), combined for much improved climb and cruise performance. The new aircraft also incorporated a one-piece windshield and a bare metal instrument panel instead of one covered with a removable plastic fascia. Because of the raised zero-fuel weight and the raised maximum take-off weight, the Seneca III has the highest useful load of all the PA-34 variants. Some later models have electrically-actuated flaps. More than 930 Seneca IIIs were built; the last 37 Seneca IIIs built had a 28-volt electrical system rather than the 14-volt system of previous aircraft.

The aircraft&#x27;s gross weight was increased to for takeoff and for landing. A typical Seneca III with air conditioning and deicing equipment has a useful load of .

===PA-34-220T Seneca IV===
In 1994, the &quot;New&quot; Piper Aircraft company introduced the Seneca IV, having achieved certification on 17 November 1993. This model was similar to the Seneca III offering minor improvements, such as a streamlined engine cowl for increased cruise performance. It continued to use the counter-rotating Continental TSIO-360-KB engines and gross weights remained unchanged. A total of 71 Seneca IVs were built.

===PA-34-220T Seneca V===

Certified on 11 December 1996, the Seneca V was put into production as a 1997 model year. Again the cowls were redesigned for increased performance, several cockpit switches were relocated from the panel to the headliner, and an improved engine variant, the Continental TSIO-360-RB, fitted with an intercooler, was used.

The Seneca V&#x27;s gross weights remain the same as the Seneca III and IV at for takeoff and for landing, therefore, with all of the added features, the useful load is reduced by about . The standard useful load for the 2014 model is but typically is when the aircraft is equipped with air conditioning, deicing equipment and co-pilot instruments.

===Embraer EMB-810 Seneca===
From 1975 the Seneca was built under licence in Brazil by Embraer as the EMB-810. The PA-34-200T was produced as the EMB-810C Seneca (452 built) and the PA-34-220T as the EMB-810D (228 built).

==Operators==
===Civil===
The aircraft is popular with air charter companies and small feeder airlines, and is operated by private individuals and companies. One notable civil operator is Eid Air Aviation, a flight school located in Bromont, Canada

<doc id="1236613" wikidata="Q1770690" url="?curid=1236613" title="Madri">
<text>Madri (, ) is a princess from the Madra Kingdom mentioned in the Hindu epic, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. She became the second wife of Pandu, the king of the Kuru Kingdom, and was the mother of the twins Nakula and Sahadeva, the youngest of the five Pandava brothers who play a central role in the epic. 

Madri was also the sister of Shalya, and her marriage to Pandu was arranged by Bhishma, the elder of the Kuru dynasty. Following a curse placed upon Pandu, which would lead to his death if he engaged in intimate relations, Madri accompanied him in his self-imposed exile, along with Pandu&#x27;s first wife, Kunti. With Pandu&#x27;s consent and Kunti&#x27;s divine assistance, Madri invoked the twin deities Nasatya and Darsa, collectively known as the Ashvins, receiving their blessing and subsequently giving birth to her sons, Nakula and Sahadeva.

Madri was renowned for her beauty and is described in the epic as being exceptionally attractive; as a result, Pandu one day succumbed to desire and attempted to make love to her, which led to his death due to the curse. Overcome with remorse and grief, Madri entrusted her sons, Nakula and Sahadeva, to Kunti’s care and chose to jump into Pandu&#x27;s funeral pyre, joining him in death.

==Literary background==
Madri is a character of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, one of the Sanskrit epics from the Indian subcontinent. The work is written in Classical Sanskrit and is a composite work of revisions, editing and interpolations over many centuries. The oldest parts in the surviving version of the text may date to near 400 BCE.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; manuscripts exist in numerous versions, wherein the specifics and details of major characters and episodes vary, often significantly. Except for the sections containing the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; which is remarkably consistent between the numerous manuscripts, the rest of the epic exists in many versions. The differences between the Northern and Southern recensions are particularly significant, with the Southern manuscripts more profuse and longer. Scholars have attempted to construct a critical edition, relying mostly on a study of the &quot;Bombay&quot; edition, the &quot;Poona&quot; edition, the &quot;Calcutta&quot; edition and the &quot;south Indian&quot; editions of the manuscripts. The most accepted version is one prepared by scholars led by Vishnu Sukthankar at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, preserved at Kyoto University, Cambridge University and various Indian universities.

Apart from the Mahabharata, Madri is briefly referenced in later Puranic texts, particularly in discussions about the genealogy of the Pandavas.

==Name and epithets==
Indologist Monier Monier-Williams explains that the Sanskrit feminine name &quot;Mādrī&quot; is derived from Madra (lit. &#x27;joy&#x27; or &#x27;happiness&#x27;), the name of her native kingdom in the northwestern Indian subcontinent. Therefore, Mādrī means &#x27;princess of Madra&#x27;. According to anthropologist Iravati Karve, the term is more of a title, granted to every princess of the kingdom.

Madri belonged to the Bahlika clan, which originated from Bactria in Central Asia. Thus, she is also referred to as Bahliki (&quot;Bāhlikī&quot;) in few instances in the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. When Madri is introduced in the epic, she is described as &quot;rūpeṇāsadṛśī&quot;, literally &#x27;unparalleled in beauty&#x27;.
==Biography==
Madri is mentioned as an incarnation of a minor goddess named Dhriti (&#x27;Endurance&#x27;). Madri is described being dark complexioned and exceedingly attractive. Her entire life, from her introduction to her death, is recounted in the &quot;Adi Parva&quot;, the opening book of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.
===Marriage and exile===
Madri was the daughter of the king of the Madra Kingdom and the sister of Shalya. Bhishma, a prominent statesman of the Kuru Kingdom and the grandsire of the royal family, traveled to Madra to secure Madri&#x27;s hand in marriage for Pandu, the king of the Kuru Kingdom. The Madra king consented, but in accordance with Madra family custom, Bhishma presented him with a dowry, consisting of wealth, gold, elephants, and horses. Bhishma then brought Madri to Hastinapura, the capital of Kuru, where she was married to Pandu.

Pandu had a first wife, Kunti, with whom Madri shared an amicable relationship, despite an underlying rivalry between the two. Shortly after his marriage, Pandu embarked on a series of military conquests to expand his kingdom’s influence. Following these successful campaigns, he went to &quot;tapovana&quot; (forest of austerities) south of Himalayas, accompanied by both his wives, Kunti and Madri. During the expedition in a forest, he observed a pair of deer in the act of coitus and desiring to hunt them, shot arrows at them. Upon approaching, he realized that the deer were, in fact, the sage Kindama and his wife, who had assumed the form of deer to enjoy privacy. As he lay dying, the sage pronounced a curse upon Pandu, decreeing that he would die instantly should he ever engage in sexual relations. Disturbed by the gravity of his actions and seeking repentance, Pandu chose to relinquish his royal duties and live an ascetic life in the forest. Both Kunti and Madri accompanied him in his self-imposed exile. After travelling to various pilgrim sites, they settled in the Shatashringa forests under the care of sages who lived there.

=== Birth of Nakula and Sahadeva ===

Kunti, the first wife of Pandu, possessed a &quot;mantra&quot; granted by the sage Durvasa prior to her marriage, which allowed her to summon any deity of her choice and bear a child by them. She had kept this boon a closely guarded secret. During his exile, Pandu, hindered in fulfilling his religious duties due to his lack of an heir, discussed the matter with Kunti, urging her to &quot;raise offspring in this time of distress.&quot; He cited six types of sons as recognised by religious doctrines, with an additional six types in a supplementary list. At this juncture, Kunti disclosed her boon, though she initially resisted using it. Only after Pandu’s fervent pleas did Kunti invoke her boon, resulting in the birth of her three sons—Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna—each fathered by a different god chosen by Pandu after an interval of one year each. When Pandu requested Kunti to bear more children, Kunti firmly refused, stating that doing so would diminish her dignity and reduce her to the status of a prostitude.

Madri, in a private moment with Pandu, expressed that she felt overshadowed by Kunti, as her position seemed secondary to Kunti’s in both Pandu’s affections and household dynamics, a feeling intensified by Madri’s awareness of her own superior birth. She conveyed her grief over being childless and requested that Pandu seek Kunti’s assistance to allow her to become a mother. However, Madri was hesitant to approach Kunti directly, referring to her as her &#x27;rival&#x27;. Upon Pandu&#x27;s request, Kunti generously shared the boon with Madri, who invoked the twin-gods, the Ashvins, to beget Nakula and Sahadeva at once. The &quot;Kaunteyas&quot; (lit. &#x27;sons of Kunti&#x27;) and &quot;Madreyas&quot; (lit. &#x27;sons of Madri&#x27;) are raised together in the hermitage, and they are collectively referred to as the &quot;Pandavas&quot;. 

After some time, Madri, through Pandu, asked Kunti for the assistance to bear more children. However, Kunti firmly refused the request, expressing her frustration by noting that Madri had &quot;deceived&quot; her by using a single mantra to gain two sons. She voiced her regret, fearing that Madri might end up with more children than herself, and admitted she would have also summoned the Ashvins to obtain twins had she known. Concluding her response, Kunti insisted that Pandu &quot;not come to [her] again&quot; with requests to give Madri the mantra.

=== Death ===

During spring—the season linked with erotism in Hindu tradition—in the forest of Shatashringa, Pandu was deeply influenced by the intensity of the atmosphere. One day, while walking alone with Madri in this setting, Pandu saw her in translucent clothes and succumbed to desire. Despite Madri’s repeated protests, Pandu made love to her, forgetting the curse placed upon him by the sage Kindama, which forbade him from intimate relations on penalty of death. The curse took immediate effect, and Pandu fell dead in Madri’s arms. Upon Pandu’s death, Madri cried out in sorrow, summoning Kunti but asking her to come alone, leaving the children behind. Kunti, seeing Pandu and Madri together, blamed Madri for the incident. Madri explained that despite her resistance, Pandu’s overwhelming desire fulfilled the curse&#x27;s terms. Kunti sorrowfully noted that Madri was &quot;fortunate&quot; to have seen Pandu&#x27;s face radiant in intimacy—a moment Kunti herself had never experienced Following this, Kunti, as the senior wife, claimed the religious duty to accompany Pandu in death, believing it her responsibility to follow him to the afterlife. She asked Madri to relinquish his body and take on the task of raising their children. In the Southern recension of the Mahabharata, Pandu&#x27;s death occurred on the day of Uttara Phalguni Nakshatra, coinciding with Arjuna&#x27;s birthday.

Madri, however, resisted Kunti’s request, stating that she felt bound to Pandu by an unfulfilled union, as he had approached her in desire at the time of his death. Madri expressed her wish to follow Pandu into the afterlife to fulfill his desire, also fearing she might not be able to raise Kunti’s children with equal dedication and affection. She appealed to Kunti to care for her own children, Nakula and Sahadeva, in her absence, trusting in Kunti’s ability to provide for them impartially. During Pandu&#x27;s funeral, Madri jumped into Pandu&#x27;s burning pyre, thus performing the act of sati. 

However, this account is contradicted by the very next stanza, which states that her dead body and that of her husband were handed over by sages to the Kaurava elders in Hastinapura for the funeral rites.

The &quot;Svargarohana Parva&quot; (the final book of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;) mentions that in the afterlife, Madri resides in the heavenly realm of the god Indra.

==Assessment==
Madri is traditionally portrayed as a &quot;pativrata&quot;, or &quot;devoted wife,&quot; who follows her husband&#x27;s death out of love. For her decision to commit sati (self-immolation) after Pandu’s death, Indologist Pradeep Bhattacharya positions Madri within a broader pattern of dependent female characters in the Mahabharata, such as Ambika, Ambalika, and Gandhari, who conform to social or marital expectations. This is in contrast to a different class of characters called the &quot;kanyas&quot;, like Kunti, Draupadi, and Satyavati, who are powerful independent figures with great influence in shaping the narrative of the epic. Iravati Karve views Madri as a tragic figure, whose life is indirectly ruined by Bhishma. However, she also notes that Madri attains liberation from the more arduous life, which is endured by Kunti, who survives and faces various hardships and plots, while caring for both of Madri’s children, even more than her own. Mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik further highlights the distinction between the two co-wives, noting that while Kunti’s sons—Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna—become central figures in the epic, Madri’s twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, play relatively minor roles.

Assessments emphasize Madri’s renowned beauty and high status as a princess of Madra, which are presented as surpassing that of Kunti. According to Indologist and &quot;Mahabharata&quot; scholar Pradip Bhattacharya, Madri’s charms and physical appeal allowed her to win Pandu’s favoritism, as seen when he grants her the freedom to choose her divine partner without the restrictions that were earlier imposed on Kunti. Other critics observe that Madri’s beauty, while notable, reduces her character in the epic to that of merely an &quot;beloved wife,&quot; overshadowing her individuality and eventually being blamed for Pandu&#x27;s demise. The authors also highlight Madri’s strategic thinking and cleverness—rather than directly asking Kunti, she convinces Pandu by making it about his legacy and also manages to gain two children in a single opportunity, the latter of which Kunti views as &quot;wicked&quot; and &quot;deceitful&quot;.

This tension between the two co-wives is a recurring theme in the Mahabharata, portraying a rivalry common in polygamous settings. While discussing her desire for children with Pandu, Madri affirms that Kunti is her rival and does not shy away from expressing her sensitivity in seeking Kunti&#x27;s favour. Bhattacharya points out that Kunti similarly expresses resentment over Madri’s ability to outmaneuver her, particularly at the moment of Pandu’s death when she finds Madri in his arms. This is further evident when Kunti, feeling betrayed by Madri&#x27;s use of her generosity to outdo her in the number of children, refuses to share her mantra again. According to Baisakhi Ghosh, a Sanskrit scholar and author, their rivalry stemmed from Kunti&#x27;s belief that Madri was favored by the king due to her beauty, while Madri felt that Kunti, as the chief queen, enjoyed a status she herself deserved, fueled her belief that she is equal to or even exceeds Kunti in some ways. However, Madri finally accepts Kunti&#x27;s nobility before her death, acknowledging her resilience and leadership. Bhattacharya sees Madri’s recognition of Kunti as an honest tribute to her own limitations, reflecting her lack of the “firmness of will” needed to rise above rivalry and ego.

=== Sati ===
Madri’s sati (the act of immolation of a widow on her husband&#x27;s funeral pyre) has been studied by scholars as a way to gain insights into the practice of sati during the ancient epic period. However, her case stands out as an exceptionally rare instance in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, where widows—aside from a few in later-added chapters—do not perform sati. Traditionally, it is believed that Madri committed sati by mounting Pandu’s funeral pyre, based on a specific verse (1.117.28) from the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. Yet a subsequent verse (1.117.30-31), found in all manuscript traditions, offers an alternative account. In this version, after Pandu’s death, sages bring both Pandu’s and Madri’s bodies to Hastinapura for proper funeral rites, contradicting the claim that Madri perished with Pandu on the pyre. Nilakantha, a prominent 17th-century commentator on the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, tried to reconcile these conflicting verses by suggesting that the word &quot;sarīra&quot; (typically meaning &quot;body&quot;) in the second verse actually refers to &quot;asthi&quot; (bones or remains). By this interpretation, Madri did indeed immolate herself with Pandu, and the “bodies” brought to Hastinapura were, in fact, their ashes or charred remains, not their intact corpses. This interpretation, while considered the most compelling explanation, has not gained widespread acceptance.

While the scene is included in the Critical Edition of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, V. S. Sukthankar, the General Editor of the Critical Edition, expressed his dissatisfaction with Nilakantha’s interpretation, drawing on the views of Edward Washburn Hopkins. Although Sukthankar did not explicitly argue that the verses were spurious, he acknowledged the internal contradictions and the challenge of reconciling the two accounts. Building on Sukthankar and Hopkins, scholar M. A. Mehendale contends that the conflicting accounts are due to textual conflation from an interpolation, where an external narrative was inserted into the text without consideration for internal consistency. He rejects Nilakantha’s explanation and, based on internal and external evidence, suggests that the verses regarding Madri’s self-immolation are likely spurious. Devdutt Pattanaik argues that such inconsistencies reflect later cultural and textual interpolations during the medieval period. Pattanaik points to further contradictions in &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; episodes, such as the account of Krishna’s death, where some of his wives perform sati while others choose asceticism, and other episodes in which widows, like those of the Kauravas or figures from the other epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; like Tara and Mandodari, do not immolate themselves. These discrepancies suggest that later writers may have modified the scenes to reflect medieval values that promoted widow immolation as a mark of honor and loyalty. Regarding the alternative account, Pattanaik suggests that if Madri’s body was indeed delivered to Hastinapur, it is likely she died immediately alongside Pandu due to the curse placed on him by Kindama, since Pandu&#x27;s arrows had killed both the sage and his wife.

<text>Thomas Battle Turley (April 5, 1845July 1, 1910) was a Tennessee attorney who served as a Democratic United States Senator from 1897 to 1901.

==Biography==
Turley was born in Memphis and attended public schools and was a private in the Confederate Army throughout the Civil War, spending part of that conflict as a prisoner of war. Upon its conclusion he attended the University of Virginia law school in Charlottesville, Virginia, completing his studies in 1867. In 1870 he was admitted to the Tennessee bar and began practicing in Memphis. A prominent attorney, upon the death in office of Senator Isham G. Harris, Turley was appointed by governor of Tennessee Robert L. Taylor to the vacancy. He was subsequently elected to the balance of the term by the Tennessee General Assembly.

Turley declined to stand for any further service in the Senate once the balance of the term to which Harris had initially been elected had expired, serving in the Senate from July 20, 1897, to March 3, 1901. He returned to his Memphis law practice until shortly before his death in 1910. He was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, the final resting place of many West Tennessee political figures.

<doc id="1236616" wikidata="Q2706041" url="?curid=1236616" title="Hedorah">
<text>, also known as the Smog Monster, is a fictional monster, or kaiju who first appeared in Toho&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot;. Hedorah was named for , the Japanese word for sludge, slime, vomit or chemical ooze.

==Overview==
===Development===
Whereas Godzilla was a symbol of Japanese concerns over nuclear weapons, Hedorah was envisioned as an embodiment of Yokkaichi asthma, caused by Japan&#x27;s widespread smog and urban pollution at the time. Director Yoshimitsu Banno stated in an interview that his intention in creating Hedorah was to give Godzilla an adversary who was more than just a &quot;giant lobster&quot; and which represented &quot;the most notorious thing in current society&quot;. He also stated that Hedorah&#x27;s vertically tilted eyes were based on vaginas, which he joked were &quot;scary&quot;. The monster was originally going to be named &quot;Hedoron&quot;, though this changed once the TV series &quot;Spectreman&quot; introduced a character with an identical name.

The monster was realized via various props and a large sponge rubber suit donned by future Godzilla performer Kenpachiro Satsuma in his first acting role for Toho. Satsuma had been selected on account of his physical fitness, though he stated later that he had been disappointed to receive the role, as he had grown tired of taking non-speaking roles. In performing as Hedorah, Satsuma tried to emphasize Hedorah&#x27;s otherworldly nature by making its movements seem more grotesque than animal-like. Several authors have noted that, unlike most Toho monsters, Hedorah&#x27;s violent acts are graphically shown to claim human victims, and the creature shows genuine amusement at Godzilla&#x27;s suffering. Banno wished to bring back Hedorah in a sequel set in Africa, but the project never materialized, as he was fired by producer and series co-creator Tomoyuki Tanaka, who allegedly accused him of ruining the &quot;Godzilla&quot; series. &quot;Complex&quot; listed the character as #8 on its &quot;The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time&quot; list.

Banno had hoped to revisit Hedorah in his unrealized project &quot;Godzilla 3-D&quot;, which would have had featured a similar monster named Deathla. Like its predecessor, Deathla would have been a shape-shifting extraterrestrial, though it would have fed on chlorophyll rather than gas emissions, and all of its forms would have incorporated a skull motif.

===Shōwa era (1971)===
In &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot;, Hedorah originates from the Dark Gas Nebula in the constellation of Orion. It journeys to Earth via a passing comet, and lands in Suruga Bay as a monstrous tadpole-like creature, increasing in size as it feeds on the pollutants contaminating the water. It proceeds to rampage throughout Japan, killing thousands and feeding on gas emissions and toxic waste, gradually gaining power as it advances from a water stage, to a land stage, and finally a bipedal Perfect Form that it can switch out for a smaller, flying form at any time. Godzilla confronts Hedorah at Mount Fuji, but his atomic breath has no effect on Hedorah&#x27;s amorphous, water-rich body. Hedorah rapidly overpowers Godzilla using a combination of its fearsome strength and incredible durability, and almost kills the King of the Monsters after hurling him into a pit and attempting to drown him under a deluge of chemical ooze. It is later discovered that Hedorah is vulnerable to temperatures high enough to dehydrate it, so the JSDF constructs a pair of gigantic electrodes on the battlefield to use against the alien. Hedorah and Godzilla continue to fight, and the former is subsequently killed when Godzilla uses his atomic breath to power the electrodes, which cripple Hedorah and allow Godzilla to fully dehydrate its body into dust.

===Millennium era (2004)===
Hedorah briefly reappears in &quot;&quot; as one of several monsters under the Xiliens&#x27; control before it is destroyed by Godzilla alongside Ebirah in Tokyo.

===Other===
Hedorah also appears in &quot;&quot;″s prequel novel &quot;Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse&quot;, in which it was originally a colony of sludge-like microorganisms that lived off dissolved chemicals inside a mine in Hebei, China. After the Chinese government discovered it in 1999, they studied and modified the microorganisms to operate as a giant, mist-like bioweapon with red and yellow eyes called Hedorah. In 2005, the Chinese military commenced &quot;Operation: Hedorah&quot; to kill Anguirus and Rodan with the bio-weapon. Hedorah successfully took down the two monsters, but it attained sentience afterwards and went on a rampage, consumed the pollutants in the surrounding area, then disappeared, leaving an estimated 8.2 million casualties in its wake.

A 2021 short film &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; created for the 50th Anniversary of the character would give the Final Wars incarnations of Hedorah and Godzilla a rematch amid an oil refinery in the daytime.

Hedorah also appears in &quot;Chibi Godzilla Raids Again&quot;.

<doc id="1236618" wikidata="Q1241759" url="?curid=1236618" title="Donna Jo Napoli">
<text>Donna Jo Napoli (born February 28, 1948) is an American writer of children&#x27;s and young adult fiction, as well as a linguist. She currently is a professor at Swarthmore College teaching Linguistics in all different forms (music, Theater (structure), dance, Comparative Literature Studies). She has also taught linguistics at Smith College, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Georgetown University, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and the University of Pennsylvania.

== Early life and personal life ==
Donna Jo Napoli was born the youngest of four children in Miami, February 28, 1948, to an Italian-American family. After correcting an eyesight problem left undiagnosed until the age of 10, Napoli became an avid reader. From then on she found solace in the escape provided by books, using reading as comfort during family troubles and instability stemming from her father&#x27;s gambling problem. 

Napoli has dual citizenship in the U.S. and Italy. She is married and has five children.

== Education and linguistics career ==
She was accepted to Harvard University for undergraduate education and received both her B.S. (Mathematics, 1970) and M.A./Ph.D. (Romance Languages, 1973). Her PhD dissertation was titled &quot;The Two Si&#x27;s of Italian: An Analysis of Reflexive, Inchoative, and Indefinite Subject Sentences in Modern Standard Italian&quot; and was published by the Indiana University Linguistics Club. A postdoctoral fellowship in linguistics at M.I.T. in 1974 led to her resulting career in the field.

Napoli began her linguistics career in generative syntax, with a focus on Italian and other Romance languages. Her subsequent work spanned many topics within generative syntax on Romance languages and English, including its interfaces with intonation, morphology, and other areas. She has worked in syntax, phonetics, phonology, morphology, historical and comparative linguistics, Romance studies, structure of American Sign Language, poetics, writing for ESL students, and mathematical and linguistic analysis of folk dance.

Her publications in linguistics include &quot;Syntactic argumentation&quot; (with Emily Rando). (Washington, DC: Georgetown Univ. Press, 1979), &quot;Syntax: Theory and Problems&quot; (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1993), &quot;Linguistics: An introduction &quot; (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1996), &quot;Humour in sign languages: The linguistic underpinnings&quot; (with Rachel Sutton-Spence) (Dublin: Trinity Press, 2009), and &quot;L&#x27;animale parlante&quot; (&quot;The speaking animal&quot;) (2004), written with Marina Nespor, along with dozens of articles in the scholarly journals.

In 2015, she was inducted as a Fellow of the Linguistic Society of America.

== Writing career ==
Although Napoli always had a love of writing, she decided not to pursue it as a career in early life. Her professional writing career began with the publication of her first book, &quot;The Hero of Barletta,&quot; in 1988. Napoli&#x27;s novels tackle real-world problems children of any age may face, including family hardships, anxiety, phobias, and illness. As explained in a 2012 TED Talk, Napoli finds it important that children read stories about real-life problems they may face, to help comfort those who are experiencing similar difficulties.

Her children&#x27;s books have been translated into many languages, including different sign languages. Many of her children&#x27;s books are retellings of fairy tales, including &quot;The Magic Circle&quot;, &quot;Crazy Jack&quot;, &quot;Spinners&quot;, &quot;Zel&quot;, &quot;Breath&quot;, &quot;Bound&quot;, &quot;Beast&quot;, and &quot;The Wager&quot; for older children, and &quot;The Prince of the Pond&quot;, &quot;Ugly&quot;, and &quot;Mogo the Third Warthog&quot; for younger children. Other children&#x27;s stories are historical fiction based in Italy, including &quot;Daughter of Venice&quot;, &quot;For the Love of Venice&quot;, and &quot;The Smile&quot;. Napoli has won numerous awards for her work, including the Golden Kite Award given by the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators (for &quot;Stones in Water&quot;, and honor book &quot;Breath&quot;), the Sydney Taylor Award given by the Association of Jewish Libraries (for &quot;Stones in Water&quot;, and, honor book, &quot;The King of Mulberry Street&quot; and the Parents&#x27; Choice Gold Award (for &quot;Alligator Bayou&quot; and Silver awards for &quot;North&quot; and &quot;The King of Mulberry Street&quot;).

== Work with Deaf communities ==
In the early 2000s, Donna Jo Napoli began a program of research on sign languages and developed connections within the Deaf community.

Napoli has contributed to linguistic research on sign languages, including the publication of the book &quot;Primary movement in sign languages&quot; in 2011.

Combining her interest in language and literature, Napoli has collaborated with others to create bimodal bilingual e-books for hearing parents to read to their deaf children. These are ebooks and videos that are both conveyed in oral language, and conveyed in sign language in a video. Languages represented in this project include American Sign Language, Brazilian Sign Language, Fijian Sign Language, Korean Sign Language, Irish Sign Language, Nepali Sign Language, Swedish Sign Language, and others. The books are translated into the oral language relevant for each signed language.

<text>Donald James Cowan (January 3, 1883 – January 14, 1964) was a Canadian lawyer and politician. He represented Port Arthur—Thunder Bay in the House of Commons of Canada.

Born in Drumbo, Blenheim Township, Oxford County, Ontario, Cowan was the son of James D. Cowan and Elizabeth Taylor. Educated in Galt, at the University of Toronto and Osgoode Law School, he established a law practice in Port Arthur, Ontario, in 1908. In 1912, Cowan married Edith Ruby Anderson. He served three years 1913–1915 as an alderman and two years as mayor 1916–1917. Subsequently, he was city solicitor from January 1919 to November 1934. Cowan was appointed Crown attorney for Thunder Bay District, Ontario, in November 1925. In 1928, he was named King&#x27;s Counsel. He was elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative in September 1926 and again in 1930. During his two terms in Parliament, he was a member of a select committee appointed to study possible amendments and changes to the British North America Act and promoted a Seaway treaty with the United States. In July 1935 he was rewarded by Prime Minister R. B. Bennett with the judgeship of Brant County, Ontario, only the third judge of that county since 1853. Cowan died in Brantford, Ontario, in 1964.

<text>The Piper PA-44 Seminole is an American twin-engined light aircraft manufactured by Piper Aircraft.

The PA-44 is a development of the Piper Cherokee single-engined aircraft and is primarily used for multi-engined flight training.

The Seminole has been built in three production runs; from 1979 to 1982, 1989 to 1990, and continuously since 1995.

==Design and development==
The first production Seminoles are equipped with two 180 hp (135 kW) Lycoming O-360-E1A6D engines. The right-hand engine is a Lycoming LO-360-E1A6D variant, which turns in the opposite direction to the left-hand engine. This feature eliminates the critical engine and makes the aircraft more controllable in the event that an engine needs to be shut down or fails.

The first prototype Seminole made its maiden flight in May 1976 and the type was publicly announced on February 21, 1978. The Seminole was first certified on March 10, 1978, and introduced as a 1979 model year in late 1978. Gross weight is 3800 lbs (1723 kg).

Later production Seminoles were built with Lycoming O-360-A1H6 engines.

The PA-44-180T Turbo Seminole version was certified on November 29, 1979. It features two turbocharged 180 hp (135 kW) Lycoming TO-360-E1A6D engines, which offer a significant improvement in performance at high density altitude. The Turbo Seminole had its takeoff gross weight raised to 3925 lb (1780 kg), while the landing weight remained at 3800 lbs (1723 kg).

The PA-44 features a high T-tail similar to the T-tailed Arrow IV. The Seminole is visually similar to the Beechcraft Duchess.

Production of both versions of the Seminole was stopped in 1982, after 361 Seminoles and 87 Turbo Seminoles had been built. Production of the normally aspirated PA-44-180 restarted in 1988. Changes were limited to modifications to the aircraft&#x27;s electrical systems and instrumentation. Production was stopped again in 1990 after 29 more aircraft had been delivered owing to Piper&#x27;s financial problems. Production restarted again in 1995.

==Variants==
:Normally aspirated version powered by two Lycoming O-360-E1A6D or two O-360-A1H6 engines.
;PA-44-180T Turbo Seminole
:Turbocharged version powered by two Lycoming TO-360-E1A6D engines.

<text>Quaudiophiliac (styled QuAUDIOPHILIAc) is a compilation album featuring music by Frank Zappa, released in DVD-Audio format by Barking Pumpkin Records in 2004. It compiles recordings he made while experimenting with quadraphonic, or four-channel, sound in the 1970s. Zappa prepared quadraphonic mixes of a number of his 1970s albums, with both &quot;Over-Nite Sensation&quot; (1973) and &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot; (1974) being released in discrete quadraphonic on Zappa&#x27;s DiscReet Records label.

Produced by Zappa, and completed by his son, Dweezil Zappa, &quot;Quaudiophiliac&quot; includes several previously unreleased works in this format. The recordings date from as early as 1970, with &quot;Chunga Basement&quot;, a version of the title track from &quot;Chunga&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1970). Also included are three tracks from the 1975 Royce Hall, UCLA concerts with the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Orchestra which would become &quot;Orchestral Favorites&quot; (1979); plus a quad remix of a segment of Zappa&#x27;s 1968 musique concrète masterpiece &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;.

<doc id="1236650" wikidata="Q2311640" url="?curid=1236650" title="Mechagodzilla">
<text>is a fictional mecha character, or monster, that first appeared in the 1974 film &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot;. In its debut appearance, Mechagodzilla is depicted as an extraterrestrial villain, a robot created by alien invaders to confront and destroy Godzilla. In subsequent iterations, Mechagodzilla is usually depicted as a man-made robotic weapon designed to defend Japan against Godzilla and other kaiju. In all incarnations, the character is portrayed as a robotic doppelgänger of Godzilla with a vast array of high-tech weaponry. Along with King Ghidorah, Mechagodzilla is commonly considered to be an archenemy of Godzilla.

==Overview==
===Development===
Mechagodzilla was conceived in 1974 as a more serious villain than its immediate two predecessors, Gigan and Megalon, whose films were considered creative disasters. According to Tomoyuki Tanaka, Mechagodzilla was inspired by both Mechani-Kong from the previous Toho film &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot; and the robot anime genre, which was popular at the time. Effects director Teruyoshi Nakano also felt that a mechanical monster was cheaper to construct than the mutated animals Godzilla had previously faced. As the resulting &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot; proved to be a greater critical success than previous 1970s &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, the character was revived in 1975&#x27;s &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot;. The film&#x27;s screenplay was based on the winning entry of a story-writing competition won by Yukiko Takayama, who continued the darker tone of the previous film by adding the subplot of Mechagodzilla being cybernetically connected to a young woman. Mechagodzilla&#x27;s design remained largely unchanged from its previous appearance, though it was made to look thinner and more angular, with a darker sheen and an MG2 insignia emblazoned on its upper arms. The film&#x27;s original draft was going to have Mechagodzilla destroy Tokyo utterly, though the destruction was cut down for budgetary reasons.
Mechagodzilla was brought back in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot;, as the success of &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot; and the popularity of its main antagonist Mothra spurred Toho into reintroducing familiar characters rather than inventing new ones. Originally, the new Mechagodzilla was to be named &quot;Berserk&quot;, and was envisioned as being a much more organic Godzilla-like creature which would later turn on its creators after becoming infected with a computer virus which makes it self-aware. Berserk would subsequently absorb more and more machinery, to the point of degenerating into a mass of metal and wires, though this concept was rejected early in pre-production. As Mechagodzilla was intended to be a military defense weapon rather than an alien construct, the character was redesigned as looking sleeker and smoother. It was portrayed by suit actor Wataru Fukuda, and consisted of multiple separate elements which were worn like plate armor. Special effects artist Koichi Kawakita originally envisioned Mechagodzilla being able to split into aerial and terrestrial units, though this idea was scrapped in favor of the character merging with the flying battleship Garuda. The film was promoted through the children&#x27;s program &quot;Adventure Godzilla-land&quot;, which portrayed Godzilla and Mechagodzilla as rival news anchors reporting on the events of the upcoming movie. Composer Akira Ifukube wrote a theme for Mechagodzilla incorporating a slow battle march with heavy percussion and pentatonic phrasing.

The decision to incorporate Mechagodzilla into the Millennium series was taken by producer Shōgo Tomiyama, who gave the general outline of what would become the story of &quot;Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla&quot; to &quot;Godzilla vs. Megaguirus&quot; director Masaaki Tezuka. Tezuka instructed his staff to research both cybernetics and DNA engineering in order to make the character scientifically plausible. Tezuka had initially wanted Mechagodzilla to be a much speedier robot than the one on film, envisioning it as becoming progressively more agile during its fight against Godzilla as the latter tore off its opponent&#x27;s armaments. This incarnation of Mechagodzilla was deliberately shown being airlifted by carriers rather than flying directly into battle as the previous two incarnations had done, as Tezuka felt that it made little sense for Mechagodzilla to drain its energy in such a manner. Upon being asked why the Mechagodzilla suit wasn&#x27;t painted with military camouflage colors, Tezuka answered that &quot;Mechagodzilla doesn&#x27;t need to hide.&quot; Tezuka had originally intended to have both Godzilla and Mechagodzilla die at the end of the film, but was forced to change this on the insistence of Toho managers, who felt that such an ending was too dark for a New Year movie release.

In the 2003 sequel &quot;&quot;, creature designer Shinichi Wakasa used the same mold to create a redesigned Mechagodzilla, which was meant to look more weathered than its predecessor. According to production designer Shinki Nishikawa, several other changes were made to the Mechagodzilla design&#x27;s head, chest and arms in order to make the character look less heroic and more machine-like. The robot&#x27;s back unit was reduced in size and flipped upside down, and the head was made smaller. As the previous design&#x27;s shoulder cannons were considered uneven and unsophisticated-looking because of their rectangular shape, special effects director Eiichi Asada made them more pentagonal. As the character was supposed to rely more on its forearm cannons than in the previous film, Nishikawa made them larger and more powerful looking.

For &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, Mechagodzilla&#x27;s design was inspired by the due to their &quot;simplicity.&quot; Director Adam Wingard attempted to avoid the &quot;complex&quot; designs from the Michael Bay &quot;Transformers&quot; films. Writer Max Borenstein had originally written Mechagodzilla into &quot;Godzilla: King of the Monsters&quot;. However, director Michael Dougherty scrapped the character during development.

===Arsenal===

The Showa Mechagodzilla stands in height and weighs 40,000 metric tons. It is built from &quot;space titanium&quot;, and is capable of launching missiles from its fingers, toes and knees, as well as firing Space Beams from its eyes and a Cross Attack Beam from its chest unit. It also possesses jets in its feet, allowing it to fly. Its head can spin 360°, and can form a force field capable of repelling and shocking opponents. The upgraded model featured in &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot; included revolving missiles, and was no longer vulnerable to decapitation, as its main computer was housed in an external power source. Once Mechagodzilla&#x27;s head was removed, the machine was able to continue to fight, possessing a Head Controller capable of firing a concentrated laser with the same strength as its regular beams.

The Heisei Mechagodzilla stands at in height, weighs 150,000 metric tons, and is powered by a nuclear reactor which derives its energy from heavy hydrogen and helium-3 in pellet form. Its frame is coated in an armor made of synthetic diamond codenamed T-1, allowing the robot to resist and repel Godzilla&#x27;s atomic breath, as well as absorb its power to energize its Plasma Grenade, an energy weapon housed in its abdomen. Additional armaments include Mega Buster ray fired from its mouth, Laser Cannons in its eyes, missiles fired from its shoulders and hips, jet propulsors on its back and behind its hips to fly and two harpoons known as the G-Crusher fired from its arms. The G-Crusher is capable of sending large amounts of electric current through the cables. The model is later combined with the flying battleship Garuda, thus allowing it to hover and adding two additional Maser Cannons to its arsenal.

Kiryu, the Millennium Mechagodzilla, stands at in height, weighs 40,000 metric tons, and is piloted remotely from a control craft. The mecha can be remotely recharged from the ground using microwaves that are relayed through a power system on one of the command aircraft, and then beamed back down to the robot. Its armaments include a Twin Maser Cannon in its mouth, railguns on its hands, a maser blade on its right hand, two reactors on its back to fly, a back unite with missiles and boosters and two rocket launchers on its shoulders. Its most powerful and most energetically costly weapon is the Absolute Zero Cannon housed in its chest, which fires a beam capable of flash freezing enemies. In &quot;&quot;, the Absolute Zero Cannon is replaced with a Triple Hyper Maser Cannon and instead of the maser blade he can assemble his right hand into a drill.

The Anime Trilogy Mechagodzilla stands 50 meters in height, weighs 30,000 metric tons, and is powered by artificial intelligence and made from nanometal. In the novel: &quot;Project Mechagodzilla&quot;, its arsenal includes a Blade Launcher, Convergent Neutron Cannon, Flight, Hyper Lance, Thermal Energy Buffer Layer, and Tail Blow. When it forms Mechagodzilla city, the defenses include gun cannons, EMP Harpoons, and a force field to protect itself when fired upon.

In &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, Mechagodzilla stands at in height, towering over Godzilla, weighs 100,000 metric tons, and is telepathically piloted through a cybernetic neural network developed from King Ghidorah&#x27;s only surviving brain. Its weaponry includes a Proton Scream fired from its mouth, missiles fired from its shoulders and chest, jet boosters on its back, plasmic hits, buzzsaws in its fingers and spinning spikes at the end of its tail.

==Film history==
===Shōwa period (1974–1975)===

In &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot;, Mechagodzilla is created by the Black Hole Planet 3 aliens, also known as the Simians, in order to conquer Earth before their homeworld gets destroyed by an expanding black hole. First appearing in a pseudo-flesh outer covering and masquerading as the real Godzilla, Mechagodzilla attacks Japan and overpowers Godzilla&#x27;s ally Anguirus. Godzilla appears and destroys the pseudo-flesh disguise, forcing Mechagodzilla to reveal itself in full. Their initial battle results in a tie, as Godzilla is severely wounded and Mechagodzilla is forced back into the Simian&#x27;s base for repair. Mechagodzilla is deployed again but is overpowered through the combined efforts of Godzilla and King Caesar. Godzilla ultimately defeats Mechagodzilla by decapitating it, and Mechagodzilla subsequently explodes upon the self-destruction of the Simians&#x27; base.

The Simians, now under the leadership of Mugal, return and rebuild Mechagodzilla in &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot;. This time, it is further modified with living human brain cells and has its control circuitry integrated into the body of the formerly human cyborg Katsura Mafune. Mechagodzilla is teamed up with the dinosaur Titanosaurus, who is controlled by Katsura&#x27;s crazed father. Although Mechagodzilla survives another decapitation during a battle against Godzilla, it is once more defeated after Katsura commits suicide, destroying the robot&#x27;s controls and freezing it long enough for Godzilla to use its atomic heat ray on Mechagodzilla&#x27;s headless body, causing it to explode.

===Heisei period (1993)===
In &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot;, Mechagodzilla is built as an anti-Godzilla weapon by the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center using 23rd-century technology reverse engineered from the remains of Mecha-King Ghidorah. Mechagodzilla overpowers Godzilla in Kyoto, but is rendered harmless by a voltage backsurge caused by Godzilla. Mechagodzilla is recovered and merged with the smaller airship Garuda to form . This combined mecha later fights both Fire Rodan and Godzilla. He proceeds to cripple Godzilla by destroying his secondary brain and mortally wounds Rodan. Rodan then sacrifices his energy to revive Godzilla, who then uses his new red spiral atomic breath to destroy the weakened Super-Mechagodzilla.

In &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot;, it is revealed that Mechagodzilla&#x27;s remains were salvaged and used to construct Moguera.

===Millennium period (2002–2003)===

The Millennium incarnation is featured in two films: &quot;Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla&quot; and &quot;&quot; and is referenced as , derived from Kikai Ryu (Japanese for &quot;machine dragon&quot;) or &quot;Kōryū&quot; (Japanese for steel dragon). When a second Godzilla appears in 1999, the Japanese military creates a Mechagodzilla built around the skeleton of the original Godzilla from 1954 and a DNA computing-based operating system. During its first battle with Godzilla four years later in 2003, Kiryu&#x27;s genetic memories of its 1954 incarnation are awakened, and it proceeds to attack Tokyo, free from the controls of its pilot until its power drains. During its second battle with Godzilla, Kiryu forces Godzilla to retreat after using its Absolute Zero Cannon.

In &quot;&quot;, taking place one year later in 2004, Mothra&#x27;s fairies warn Japan that Kiryu&#x27;s creation is a violation of the natural order and that Mothra would gladly take the cyborg&#x27;s place in protecting Japan, should Kiryu be dismantled. The ultimatum is declined, as Kiryu was built partially to defend against a second attack from Mothra herself. Godzilla eventually appears, prompting Mothra and Kiryu to cooperate. Kiryu momentarily is forced to fight Godzilla alone after Mothra is killed, but is later assisted by Mothra&#x27;s larvae, who encase Godzilla in a cocoon, and Kiryu is given orders to terminate him. However, Kiryu&#x27;s soul has awakened once again, and it instead grabs hold of Godzilla, flies out to sea, and submerges both Godzilla and itself in the depths of the ocean (though not before ejecting its human occupant to safety).

===Reiwa period (2017–2018)===
Mechagodzilla appears briefly in &quot;&quot;, the first film in the anime trilogy. The mecha is designed and constructed by humans and bilusaludo - the latter one of two alien races who made contact with humans in an attempt to rescue them - as a countermeasure against Godzilla. But the mech is never activated as Godzilla attacked the construction facility forcing them to abandon it. Though not seen again, the mech is referenced several other times throughout the film. In &quot;&quot;, the second film in the trilogy, the remnants of Mechagodzilla&#x27;s AI rebuild the facility it was created in by utilizing nanometal to help defeat Godzilla, aptly named &quot;Mechagodzilla City&quot;. It also creates three battlesuits with flight capabilities called &quot;Vultures&quot;.

Haruo and his forces use the city as a base of operations to destroy Godzilla. When Mechagodzilla City begins assimilating its surroundings and living beings with its nanometal under the command of the Bilusaludo, and is predicted to assimilate the entire planet prompting Haruo to destroy its command center, giving Godzilla the opening to destroy it. In &quot;&quot;, some nanometal survives within Yuko&#x27;s body which Professor Martin extracts and applies to the last &quot;Vulture&quot; intending to rebuild civilization. Realizing this will only repeat the mistakes that prompted Godzilla&#x27;s advent, endanger the Houtua and risk the return of Ghidorah, Harou takes Yuko and the last Vulture and flies all three towards Godzilla in a suicide charge to save the Houtua from mankind&#x27;s mistakes.

===MonsterVerse (2021)===
Mechagodzilla was featured in the 2021 film &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;. Secretly built by Apex Cybernetics as an anti-Titan weapon, it is designed to wipe out the Titans and replace Godzilla, remotely piloted by Ren Serizawa via a telepathic link originating from a skull of Ghidorah&#x27;s left head (acquired after it was torn off by Godzilla in &quot;&quot; prior), though conventional energy sources prove insufficient to power it to full capacity.

As Mechagodzilla is being built at a facility in Pensacola, Florida, Godzilla senses Ghidorah&#x27;s presence whenever the mecha activates, which causes him to search for and eventually attack the facility. Due to the secrecy of the project, the public misinterprets this as Godzilla having gone rogue, resulting in Monarch and Apex taking Kong to the Hollow Earth in search of an energy source to confront Godzilla with; simultaneously, Apex covertly plans to use it to power Mechagodzilla, now housed within Victoria Peak. Godzilla and Kong clash en route to the Hollow Earth in the Tasman Sea, but ultimately the team finds and retrieves the power source, in the form of &quot;Hollow Earth Energy&quot;.

After Godzilla and Kong fight a second time in Hong Kong, Serizawa charges the mechanized titan with the untested Hollow Earth&#x27;s energies, upon pressure from Apex Cybernetics&#x27; CEO Walter Simmons. However, the process unexpectedly allows Ghidorah&#x27;s mind to possess Mechagodzilla, who then kills both Simmons and Serizawa, goes on a rampage in the city, and faces Godzilla. Godzilla is easily overwhelmed, and is nearly killed before Kong joins the battle. Kong&#x27;s axe initially proves ineffective against Mechagodzilla, as its energy was depleted after battling Godzilla. As Mechagodzilla maintains the upper hand, Josh Valentine tampers with its control panel via alcohol spillage, stalling it long enough for Godzilla to supercharge Kong&#x27;s axe with his atomic breath. Kong then uses his fully powered axe to dismember Mechagodzilla&#x27;s limbs, and finishes it off by tearing off its head.

==In other media==
The various incarnations of Mechagodzilla have appeared in other media associated with the series, such as video games, television shows, and comics.

===In video games===
The Shōwa Mechagodzilla appears in the video games &quot;&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System, &quot;Godzilla&quot; for the Game Boy, &quot;Super Godzilla&quot; for the Super NES (American release; replaces the Heisei version from the Super Famicom release, since the Heisei incarnation&#x27;s film had yet to be released in America when the game was released), &quot;&quot; for TurboGrafx-16, &quot;Godzilla Generations&quot; for the Dreamcast (erroneously using his Heisei counterpart&#x27;s sound effects) and &quot;Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact&quot; for the Dreamcast and the Wii version of &quot;&quot;.

The Heisei Mechagodzilla appeared in the video games &quot;Super Godzilla&quot; (Japanese version, replaced by the Showa Mechagodzilla in the English release) and &quot;&quot;, both for the Super NES, &quot;&quot; for Game Boy Advance, &quot;&quot; for Xbox and PlayStation 2, &quot;&quot; for Xbox and GameCube, and Wii and PlayStation 2 versions of &quot;&quot;.

Kiryu first appeared in the Japanese version of &quot;&quot; on the GameCube. Since the Millennium Mechagodzilla duology would take a few years to reach US stores, it was dropped from the American version of the game, but did appear as an exclusive in the Xbox version. Kiryu was next playable in &quot;&quot; for the Xbox and the PlayStation 2 under the title &quot;Mechagodzilla 3&quot;; this would be Kiryu&#x27;s first PS2 appearance in the United States. Kiryu also appears in both versions of &quot;&quot;, for the first time under the name &quot;Kiryu&quot; as opposed to its names in the two previous games; &quot;Millennium Mechagodzilla&quot; and &quot;Mechagodzilla 3&quot;.

Like the other kaiju in the game, the backstories of all three Mechagodzilla incarnations are altered slightly, to fit the context of the game. The Heisei Mechagodzilla and Kiryu are man-made mecha created by the G.D.F. (Global Defense Force) faction to defend Earth from the Vortaak and their kaiju of the aliens&#x27; faction. The original Showa Mechagodzilla was salvaged and rebuilt by the Vortaak to be used in their kaiju force.

In the PlayStation 4 version of &quot;Godzilla&quot;, 4 incarnations of Mechagodzilla appear, the original Showa Mechagodzilla appears as both Mechagodzilla from &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot; and as Mechagodzilla 2 the rebuilt Mechagodzilla from &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot;. The Heisei Mechagodzilla appears in its Super Mechagodzilla form, while Kiryu appears in its rebuilt design from &quot;Tokyo S.O.S.&quot; In the PS4 version, all 4 Mechagodzilla are playable, the 2 versions of the Showa Mechagodzilla can be played in God of Destruction Mode via the Invade option (which allows the mode to be played using Kaiju other than the Heisei era Godzilla), while Super Mechagodzilla and Kiryu can be played via selecting Defend option (where the player defends humanity as friendly kaiju such as Mothra and various G-Force Mecha). In the PS3 version, only Mechagodzilla 1975, Super Mechagodzilla, and Kiryu appear as bosses and are not playable.

The thirteenth level of &quot;City Shrouded in Shadow&quot;, a game where players, as civilians, must escape and survive kaiju attacks, mostly mirrors the first encounter between Godzilla and Kiryu in &quot;Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla&quot;. The protagonists, tied up in the building by Yakuza thugs, witness Godzilla rampage through the game&#x27;s setting, the fictional Ichi City, and Kiryu is eventually deployed in response. After a short battle where both shoot at each other, Godzilla roars at Kiryu and reminds the spirit within of his past as a Godzilla, causing him to be possessed &amp; go berserk. As Godzilla leaves, Kiryu approaches and fires missiles at the building in which the player is inside. Once the player has reached safety or once 30 seconds have transpired, Kiryu marches through the building, cleaving it in half, heading off into the distance. The newspaper that displays the results after the level reveals that, after 30 minutes of rampaging, Kiryu has run out of power, allowing the government to retrieve the inactive mecha.

The Shōwa, Heisei, Anime Trilogy, MonsterVerse Mechagodzilla, and Kiryu appear as playable characters in &quot;Godzilla Battle Line&quot;.

Kiryu along with Godzilla, Gigan and Destoroyah become DLC guest stars in the indie game &quot;GigaBash&quot;.

The MonsterVerse Mechagodzilla appears as a playable skin in Epic Games&#x27; &quot;Fortnite&quot;, alongside Godzilla and Kong.

===Television===
While Mechagodzilla did not appear in &quot;&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998), the first Godzilla was reanimated as a cyborg called &quot;Cyber-Godzilla&quot; in the Monster Wars trilogy.

A Shōwa-inspired Mechagodzilla appears in the post-credits scene of the anime series &quot;Godzilla Singular Point&quot;, though the lab&#x27;s computer screens identify him as &quot;Robogodzilla&quot;.

===In film===
Mechagodzilla appears in the 2018 science fiction action film &quot;Ready Player One&quot; where he is seen battling the Iron Giant and the RX-78-2 Gundam. This time, Mechagodzilla is remodeled and resembles the 1974 Shōwa version, the 2002 Kiryū, and the 2014 Legendary MonsterVerse Godzilla design.

<text>The Beechcraft Model 76 Duchess is an American twin-engined monoplane built by Beechcraft intended partly as a low cost introduction to twin-engine aircraft.

==Development==
Developed as Model PD289 (Preliminary Design 289), the prototype was unveiled on November 4, 1974, although it had first flown in September 1974. The Model 76 was designed as an economical twin-engine trainer for the Beech Aero Centers and to compete with the similar Gulfstream Cougar as well as the Cessna 310.

The first production version flew on 24 May 1977, and the name &quot;Duchess&quot; was chosen through a company competition. Construction of the Duchess was set for a new factory built at the Liberal Division, with deliveries beginning early in 1978.

Production of the Duchess continued until 1983, with no significant changes. A single example was tested with turbocharged engines in 1979, but did not proceed to production.

==Design==
The Duchess is an all-metal low-wing monoplane with retractable tricycle landing gear and a T-tail. It seats four. The design used components and the bonded wing construction from Beechcraft&#x27;s single-engined Musketeer line. The basic fuselage and wing structure was adapted from the Model 24 Sierra, a Musketeer variant with retractable landing gear, but the Sierra wing spar was redesigned to support the added weight of the engines. Nose landing gear from the A36 Bonanza was used.

The Model 76 incorporates right and left &quot;handed&quot; Lycoming O-360 engines that rotate in opposing directions to eliminate the critical engine during single engine operation.

In 1979, a single example was converted to test the turbocharged versions of the engine. The cowlings were reshaped and the exhaust moved to accommodate the aft-mounted turbochargers.

The Duchess wing is of aluminum honeycomb construction fastened by bonding, rather than rivets, to reduce cost and produce a smoother aerodynamic surface.

===T-tail===
The use of a T-tail on the Model 76 met with mixed critical reception when the aircraft was introduced. &quot;Plane &amp; Pilot&quot; pronounced: &quot;Outstanding design characteristics of the new Duchess include an aerodynamically advantageous T-tail, which places the horizontal surfaces above the propeller slipstream for better stability and handling.&quot;, while Gerald Foster said: &quot;[Beechcraft&#x27;s] interest in T-tails was perhaps an affectation triggered by their wide use on jet airliners&quot;. &quot;AVweb&quot; wrote that Beechcraft adopted the T-tail after flight tests revealed that the initially used conventional horizontal stabilizer was too small and suffered from buffeting problems, increasing noise and vibration during flight; moving the horizontal stabilizer out of the propeller slipstream eliminated the buffeting and the need for enlargement while adding only of weight. Additionally, the T-tail design moved the stabilizer rearward, increasing its effectiveness and giving the aircraft a broader center of gravity range. The later Piper Seminole also adopted a T-tail.

==Variants==
;Model 76 Duchess
:Four-seat, twin-engine (Lycoming O-360), low-winged trainer with bonded aluminum construction.
;Model 76TC Duchess
:Unofficial designation for single test aircraft using turbocharged Lycoming O-360.

==Operators==
The aircraft remains popular with flight training schools.

* Beechcraft - Tested one Duchess to investigate its spin recovery characteristics in conjunction with NASA.
*National Test Pilot School - Operates one Duchess.
*Purdue University - Uses a Duchess modified with air sampling equipment as &quot;Airborne Laboratory Atmospheric Research (ALAR)&quot;.
*Scaled Composites - Uses one Duchess as a test aircraft.

<text>In mathematics, a pointed space or based space is a topological space with a distinguished point, the basepoint. The distinguished point is just simply one particular point, picked out from the space, and given a name, such as formula_1 that remains unchanged during subsequent discussion, and is kept track of during all operations.

Maps of pointed spaces (based maps) are continuous maps preserving basepoints, i.e., a map formula_2 between a pointed space formula_3 with basepoint formula_4 and a pointed space formula_5 with basepoint formula_6 is a based map if it is continuous with respect to the topologies of formula_3 and formula_5 and if formula_9 This is usually denoted
:formula_10
Pointed spaces are important in algebraic topology, particularly in homotopy theory, where many constructions, such as the fundamental group, depend on a choice of basepoint.

The pointed set concept is less important; it is anyway the case of a pointed discrete space.

Pointed spaces are often taken as a special case of the relative topology, where the subset is a single point. Thus, much of homotopy theory is usually developed on pointed spaces, and then moved to relative topologies in algebraic topology.

== Category of pointed spaces ==

The class of all pointed spaces forms a category Topformula_11 with basepoint preserving continuous maps as morphisms. Another way to think about this category is as the comma category, (formula_12 Top) where formula_13 is any one point space and Top is the category of topological spaces. (This is also called a coslice category denoted formula_14Top.) Objects in this category are continuous maps formula_15 Such maps can be thought of as picking out a basepoint in formula_16 Morphisms in (formula_12 Top) are morphisms in Top for which the following diagram commutes:

It is easy to see that commutativity of the diagram is equivalent to the condition that formula_2 preserves basepoints.

As a pointed space, formula_13 is a zero object in Topformula_13, while it is only a terminal object in Top.

There is a forgetful functor Topformula_13 formula_22 Top which &quot;forgets&quot; which point is the basepoint. This functor has a left adjoint which assigns to each topological space formula_3 the disjoint union of formula_3 and a one-point space formula_13 whose single element is taken to be the basepoint.

== Operations on pointed spaces ==

* A subspace of a pointed space formula_3 is a topological subspace formula_27 which shares its basepoint with formula_3 so that the inclusion map is basepoint preserving.
* One can form the quotient of a pointed space formula_3 under any equivalence relation. The basepoint of the quotient is the image of the basepoint in formula_3 under the quotient map.
* One can form the product of two pointed spaces formula_31 formula_32 as the topological product formula_33 with formula_34serving as the basepoint.
* The coproduct in the category of pointed spaces is the , which can be thought of as the &#x27;one-point union&#x27; of spaces.
* The smash product of two pointed spaces is essentially the quotient of the direct product and the wedge sum. We would like to say that the smash product turns the category of pointed spaces into a symmetric monoidal category with the pointed 0-sphere as the unit object, but this is false for general spaces: the associativity condition might fail. But it is true for some more restricted categories of spaces, such as compactly generated weak Hausdorff ones.
* The reduced suspension formula_35 of a pointed space formula_3 is (up to a homeomorphism) the smash product of formula_3 and the pointed circle formula_38
* The reduced suspension is a functor from the category of pointed spaces to itself. This functor is left adjoint to the functor formula_39 taking a pointed space formula_3 to its loop space formula_41.

<doc id="1236676" wikidata="Q177519" url="?curid=1236676" title="Empire (1965 film)">
<text>Empire is a 1965 American underground film by Andy Warhol. When projected according to Warhol&#x27;s specifications, it consists of eight hours and five minutes of slow motion black-and-white footage of an unchanging view of New York City&#x27;s Empire State Building. The silent film does not have conventional narrative or characters, and largely reduces the experience of cinema to the passing of time. Warhol stated that the purpose of the film was &quot;to see time go by.&quot;

A week after the film was shot, experimental filmmaker Jonas Mekas (who was cinematographer for &quot;Empire&quot;) speculated in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; that Warhol&#x27;s film would have a profound influence on avant-garde cinema. In 2004, &quot;Empire&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, who deemed it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Empire&quot; was filmed at 24 frames per second, and is meant to be seen in slow motion at 16 frames per second, extending its 6 and half hour runtime to 8 hours and 5 minutes. The film consists of a stationary view of the Empire State Building lasting the entirety of the running time. The film begins with a blank white screen, a result of the camera being calibrated for nighttime filming. As the sun sets almost imperceptibly, the figure of the building emerges and its details become clearer. As the sun sets further, the building is enveloped in darkness. The building&#x27;s floodlights are turned on, illuminating its upper levels and spire. Lights in the windows of other structures go on and off. In the background, a beacon atop the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower flashes at intervals corresponding to every 15 minutes in real time (it flashes a single time every 15 minutes and at hour it flashes the time of day). Eventually, the floodlights go dark and the image in the remainder of the film is nearly total darkness. At three points in the film, the reflections of the crew, including Warhol, are seen in the windows of the Rockefeller Foundation office, where the work was filmed, as the office lights were not shut off before the crew started shooting after changing the film magazines.

==Production==
The initial idea for &quot;Empire&quot; came from John Palmer, a young filmmaker affiliated with Jonas Mekas. Palmer had been sleeping occasionally on the roof of Mekas&#x27;s Film Maker&#x27;s Cooperative, which had an impressive view of the tower, only a few blocks away. He told Mekas that he thought an image of the floodlit building would make a good Warhol film, and Mekas passed the idea to Warhol. Around the time Warhol considered the idea, he had completed (in late 1963) his first extended-length film, the 5-hour &quot;Sleep&quot;, which shows multiple views of a man sleeping; &quot;Empire&quot; was his second long film.

In April 1964, the upper 30 floors of the Empire State Building were floodlighted for the first time in connection with the opening of the New York World&#x27;s Fair in Queens. As the only floodlit skyscraper in New York City, the impact of the lighting was dramatic, with one person calling the tower&#x27;s illuminated crown &quot;a chandelier suspended in the sky&quot;. The floodlights were essential to Warhol&#x27;s concept for the film, as there would be almost nothing to see without them.

For a shooting venue, Warhol made arrangements to use an office belonging to the Rockefeller Foundation on the 41st floor of the Time-Life Building at 51st Street and 6th Avenue. Cinematography took place overnight on July 24 and 25, 1964. Present for filming were Mekas, Warhol, Palmer, Gerard Malanga, Marie Desert (Mekas&#x27; girlfriend), and Henry Romney (of the Rockefeller Foundation). From the window at the northeast corner of 51st Street and 6th Avenue, the camera was pointed southeast toward the Empire State Building at 34th Street and 5th Avenue, taking in the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower with its blinking beacon at the corner of Madison Avenue and 24th Street, and the bulkier New York Life Insurance Company building at Madison Avenue and 26th Street.

In contrast to Warhol&#x27;s earlier films, which had been shot with a Bolex camera limited to three minutes of shooting time, &quot;Empire&quot; was filmed on an Auricon camera that allowed for takes of around 33 minutes. In the Rockefeller Foundation office, Mekas framed the shot for Warhol&#x27;s approval, and filming commenced at 8:06 pm, about ten minutes before sunset. Mekas&#x27; article about the shooting printed in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; the next week described a lighthearted night of filmmaking, with Warhol discoursing on the Empire State Building as the most prominent site in New York, visited by celebrities and tourists alike, and various people in the room imploring Warhol to pan the camera. Shooting wrapped at 2:42 a.m. the next day, with 654 feet of film exposed.

&quot;Empire&quot; was shot on ASA 400 Tri-X stock, push-processed to ASA 1000 to compensate for the dark conditions of filming. The push-processing gives the film a graininess that calls attention to the medium of the film stock itself during projection in a manner that Douglas Crimp compared to the way that ink in Warhol&#x27;s silkscreen paintings is present as both blobs of ink and as part of the image. Each reel contains a segment of film that was exposed to incidental light during processing, which may be evidence that the final work is unedited. The complete film consists of ten reels, each lasting approximately 48 minutes when projected in slow motion at 16 frames per second, as specified by Warhol.

After the film had been developed and printed, Warhol did not have funds to pay the processor, and Palmer arranged with his mother to make the payment. In recognition of his role in conceiving, assisting with and paying for the film, Warhol listed Palmer as co-director.

==Release==
&quot;Empire&quot; premiered on March 6, 1965, at the City Hall Cinema in Manhattan, then the site of Mekas&#x27; &quot;Film-Makers&#x27; Cinematheque&quot;. Reporting on the premiere in his &quot;Village Voice&quot; column, Mekas claimed that after the film had been running for ten minutes, 30 or 40 people surrounded him and another staff member demanding their money back, &quot;threatening to solve the question of the new vision and the new cinema by breaking chairs on our heads&quot;. According to Robert Fulford of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, 80 people paid $2 per seat, and when they discovered it was &quot;eight hours of film of the Empire State Building at night with no action except for the occasional light turning on or off,&quot; half demanded their money back, and one man called the police. When the cops came, they were disappointed because they suspected it was a &quot;dirty&quot; film. The angry individuals were refunded, but about ten people stayed for the entire film. &quot;They talked to each other, drank beer, slept, and agreed it was a fine movie.&quot;

Gregory Battcock, a critic who was part of Warhol&#x27;s circle and appears in several of his films, connected the film with other works by Warhol in terms of its focus on a subject that the viewer already generally knows. He argued this left space to emphasize other issues, particularly the physical medium of film, and the artistic use of long duration as a way of concentrating attention on these qualities. Battcock also observed that &quot;Empire&quot; had quickly become a classic of the avant-garde and promised to have great if unpredictable influence on the development of film.

In 1966, Warhol and his colleagues began producing events featuring rock band the Velvet Underground; these went by several names, ultimately becoming best known as the &quot;Exploding Plastic Inevitable.&quot; In addition to the Velvet Underground, the Exploding Plastic Inevitables featured simultaneous mixes of strobe lights, dancers, colored slides and film projections. Advertisements for the events held in the spring of 1966 in New York&#x27;s East Village mention &quot;Empire&quot; among other Warhol films to be screened.

==Legacy==
By 1972, Warhol withdrew most of his film catalog, including &quot;Empire&quot;, from circulation. Film historian Callie Angell observed that the inaccessibility of the film until some years after Warhol&#x27;s death in 1987, along with the assumption that a film such as &quot;Empire&quot; must be unwatchable, gave &quot;Empire&quot; a life mainly as an idea about a film that expressed Warhol&#x27;s outrageousness as an artist, with some accounts lengthening it to 10 or 24 hours. In 1988, the film began to be screened again as part of the cataloging and restoration of Warhol&#x27;s films undertaken by several institutions. In 1992, the original negative was rediscovered and used to make new prints of the film.

Mechanical projectors capable of showing the film at 16 frames per second have become rarer since the 1970s, with most current machines capable of a minimum speed of 18 frames per second; when projected at this rate, the film is about seven hours and 10 minutes long. &quot;Empire&quot; is distributed by the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s Circulating Film and Video Library.

<text>Ralph was Australian men&#x27;s magazine that was published monthly by ACP Magazines, a division of PBL Media between August 1997 and July 2010. The format and style of &quot;Ralph&quot; was similar to other men&#x27;s magazines, such as &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;Loaded&quot;.

==Content==
Similar to its rivals &quot;FHM&quot; and &quot;Zoo Weekly&quot;, &quot;Ralph&quot; published photos of scantily-clad models and female celebrities, without revealing their genitals or nipples. This allowed for the magazine to be sold in the lifestyle sections of newsagencies, and in other retailers such as department stores and supermarkets.

The magazine featured a number of recurring characters, such as Ralph Man, Frank Muddler and Gourmet Gav. Gourmet Gav, who would take on outrageous eating challenges, would earn celebrity beyond the pages of the magazine thanks to the development of Ralph TV.

&quot;Ralph&quot; featured photo shoots of Australian celebrities as well as international stars. The magazine was often cross-promoted on other ACP and PBL properties, such as promotional parties held in conjunction with Cosmopolitan, and as a sponsor of home viewer competitions during the Fox Network&#x27;s rugby league coverage.

It contained the same kinds of articles published in similar titles, and ran its own poll to find &quot;Australia&#x27;s sexiest woman&quot;. The results were published in an attachment to the regular magazine each year.

==Circulation==
&quot;Ralph&quot; had a circulation of over 100,000 in 2002, though sales began declined rapidly around 2007. In 2008 alone it lost 20 percent of its circulation, bringing it down to 66,233 copies. Its circulation was down to 63,155 at the end of 2009, with a readership of 267,000, significantly behind the market leader among men&#x27;s magazines, &quot;Zoo Weekly&quot;.

On 4 June 2010, the magazine&#x27;s publishing company ACP announced that &quot;Ralph&quot; would produce its final print edition at the end of the month, with the July cover date being the final monthly magazine, although the popular &quot;Girls of Ralph&quot; special issues would continue. ACP said that the &quot;Ralph&quot; website would remain, hosted on the ninemsn network and via its mobile platform. However, the Ralph website was eventually redirected to the &quot;Zoo Weekly&quot; website until that magazine also ceased publication in 2015.

The final issue of the magazine featured Clare Werbeloff in lingerie. Werbeloff became known as the Kings Cross Bogan following her eyewitness account of a shooting outside a Kings Cross nightclub, which turned out to be a hoax. The decision to feature Werbeloff was criticised by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, who speculated Ralph&#x27;s decision to feature a &quot;D-list wannabe celebrity&quot; was &quot;a real indication of how badly the mag was doing&quot;.

==Ralph TV==
Ralph TV was a weekly television series based on &quot;Ralph&quot; magazine which aired on the Nine Network. It was hosted by Craig &quot;Lowie&quot; Lowe and featured a trio known as &quot;the girls of Ralph TV&quot;, newcomers Brooke Sheehan, Candice Manning and Angela Tsun. The show aired footage of the various features and pictorials from the former monthly Ralph magazine. The premiere episode aired on 7 June 2007 and each episode was repeated on Fox8. The series was produced by Endemol Southern Star.

<text>In American politics, a Libertarian Republican is a politician or Republican Party member who has advocated libertarian policies while typically voting for and being involved with the Republican Party.

==Beliefs and size==

The Republican Party has historically been divided into factions. In 2012, the libertarian branch of the party was described as smaller than other branches, including Tea Party voters (the &quot;populist, Pro-limited government Tea Party wing&quot; of the party), pragmatic &quot;Main Street&quot; Republicans, and evangelical Christian conservatives.
According to a 2012 &quot;New York Times&quot; analysis, libertarian Republicans have a variety of motivating issues. On economic and domestic policy, they favor deregulation and tax cuts, repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and protecting gun rights. On social issues, they favor privacy and oppose the USA Patriot Act and oppose the War on Drugs. On foreign and defense policy, libertarian Republicans are non-interventionists. Some libertarians favor abortion rights, while other libertarian Republicans oppose abortion. Two-thirds of libertarian Republicans are males. 

In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey on political typology and polarization, 12% of Republicans described themselves as libertarian. In a 2023 New York Times poll of the Republican coalition, 14% of Republicans were considered Libertarian conservatives. As of August 2023, 38% support providing additional support to Ukraine, 34% support cutting corporate taxes over raising tariffs, 19% consider themselves very conservative, 45% believe abortion should be mostly or always legal, 51% are against comprehensive immigration reform, 73% say they favor the &quot;protection of individual freedom over traditional values&quot;, and 13% want a candidate who would &quot;fight corporations that promote woke left ideology.&quot; In the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries, 43% would vote for Donald Trump and 12% would vote for Ron DeSantis.

==Organizations==
The Republican Liberty Caucus, which describes itself as &quot;the oldest continuously operating organization in the Liberty Republican movement with state charters nationwide,&quot; was founded in 1991. In the 1990s the group&#x27;s chairs included Chuck Muth, Roger MacBride, and Congressman Ron Paul; in the 2000s, the group&#x27;s chairs included Dave Nalle. The group&#x27;s statement of principles affirms &quot;the principle that individual rights and liberties are unlimited&quot; and calls for free trade; the &quot;privatization of all government assets&quot;; the abolition of many federal agencies; the repeal of most current federal taxes in favor of a single flat income tax or national sales tax; and the phase-out of &quot;compulsory government retirement, disability, and health programs.&quot;

The House Liberty Caucus is a congressional caucus formed by Libertarian Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, at the time a Republican. In 2014, the group &quot;consisted of about 30 libertarian-inclined Republicans (and occasional Democratic visitors like Jared Polis).&quot; In February 2019, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that the House Liberty Caucus had eight members. The list of congressional member organizations (CMOs) for the 118th Congress indicates that Warren Davidson is the leader of the Congressional Liberty Caucus.

<text>John Louis Esposito (born May 19, 1940) is an American academic, professor of Middle Eastern and religious studies, and scholar of Islamic studies, who serves as Professor of Religion, International Affairs, and Islamic Studies at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He is also the founding director of the Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding at Georgetown.

==Biography==
For nearly twenty years after completing his Ph.D., Esposito had taught Religious studies (including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam) at the College of the Holy Cross, a Jesuit college in Massachusetts. At the College of the Holy Cross, Esposito held the Loyola Professor of Middle East Studies position, was the chair of the Department of Religious Studies, and director of the College of the Holy Cross&#x27; Center for International Studies. At Georgetown University, Esposito holds the position of University Professor and teaches as both Professor of Religion and International Affairs and Professor of Islamic Studies.

Esposito completed his doctoral studies under the supervision of the influential Islamic scholar Isma&#x27;il Raji al-Faruqi. He published &quot;Islam and Politics&quot; in 1984, and &quot;&quot; in 1988. Both books sold well, going through many editions. In addition to more than 35 books, he is editor-in-chief of a number of Oxford reference works including &quot;The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World&quot;, &quot;The Oxford History of Islam&quot;, &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Islam&quot;, &quot;The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World&quot; (six vols.), and &quot;Oxford Islamic Studies Online&quot;.

In 1988, he was elected president of the Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA). He has also served as president of the American Academy of Religion and president of the American Council for the Study of Islamic Societies. He served as Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of the Center for the Study of Islam &amp; Democracy from 1999 to 2004 he was a member of the World Economic Forum’s Council of 100 Leaders, the High Level Group of the U.N. Alliance of Civilizations and the E. C. European Network of Experts on De-Radicalisation. He was an advisor to the award-winning, PBS-broadcast documentary &quot;&quot; (2002), produced by Unity Productions Foundation. A recipient of the American Academy of Religion’s 2005 Martin E. Marty Award for the Public Understanding of Religion and of Pakistan’s Quaid-e-Azam Award for Outstanding Contributions in Islamic Studies, in 2003 he received the School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University Award for Outstanding Teaching.

Esposito founded the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University in 1993 and is its founding director. The center received a $20 million endowment from Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal &quot;to advance education in the fields of Islamic civilization and Muslim-Christian understanding and strengthen its presence as a world leader in facilitating cross-cultural and inter-religious dialogue.&quot;

Esposito is a Catholic.

<doc id="1236715" wikidata="Q2487800" url="?curid=1236715" title="Montauk Highway">
<text>Montauk Highway is an east–west road extending for across the southern shore of Long Island in Suffolk County, New York, in the United States. It extends from the Amityville/Copiague village/hamlet line in Amityville, where it continues as Merrick Road, to Montauk Point State Park at the very eastern end of Long Island in Montauk. The highway is known by several designations along its routing, primarily New York State Route 27A (NY 27A) from the county line to Great River and NY 27 east of Southampton. The portion of Montauk Highway between Great River and Southampton is mostly county-maintained as County Route 80 and County Route 85 (CR 80 and CR 85, respectively).

The highway was one of the original through highways of Long Island, initially extending from Jamaica in the New York City borough of Queens to Montauk Point. Within Queens, the road is now known as Merrick Boulevard, and for its entire run in Nassau County, the road is Merrick Road, with the Montauk Highway designation picking up in Amityville. The designations assigned to the road have also changed over time: Montauk Highway was the original route of NY 27 until most of it was superseded in purpose by Sunrise Highway, and for a brief time all of Montauk Highway west of Southampton was signed as NY 27A. It is still the southernmost through route on Long Island, although it has been realigned in several locations.

==Route description==
Montauk Highway begins at the Nassau–Suffolk county line, where it connects to Merrick Road. It heads east along the southern shore of Long Island, carrying NY 27A from Amityville to Great River. The highway generally narrows to two lanes in most places, especially through communities of which it forms the main street, such as Amityville, the village of Babylon, West Islip, Bay Shore, the hamlet of Islip, East Islip, Great River, Great River, Sayville, Patchogue, and Center Moriches. In these places, Montauk Highway is often called Main Street. In addition to being called Montauk Highway and Main Street in Suffolk County, it is also historically known as South Country Road, a name that is only used by former segments today.

NY 27A ends at NY 27 exit 46A in Great River, giving way to CR 85 along Montauk Highway. As CR 85, Montauk Highway runs through the hamlets of Great River, West Sayville, Sayville, Bayport, and Blue Point to the village of Patchogue, where the designation ends at CR 19. East of CR 19, Montauk Highway (known within the village as West and East Main streets) continues as a village-maintained street to the eastern village line, where it becomes CR 80, the designation that comprises most of Montauk Highway. Proceeding east from Patchogue, Montauk Highway runs through progressively less-densely populated communities. The segment east of Station Road in North Bellport and CR 36 in Brookhaven still contains old concrete pavement, a common practice of the mid-20th century. East of Speonk, the highway enters the Hamptons, the small-town, farming and summer resort communities especially popular with New York City summer vacationers.

Montauk Highway forms the main street of most of the communities in the Hamptons, such as Westhampton, Quogue, and Hampton Bays. CR 80 ends west of the village of Southampton at Knoll Road, at which point Montauk Highway becomes state-maintained again as NY 900W, an unsigned reference route. This ends at the Southampton village line, leaving Montauk Highway as a village-maintained street until it reconnects to NY 27 northeast of the village center. Now part of NY 27, Montauk Highway is the major, and occasionally the only through road in the area, passing through Bridgehampton, East Hampton, and Amagansett to reach Montauk. The highway and NY 27 end at a loop in the road at Montauk Point.

==History==

===Background===
Montauk Highway was planned as the southernmost all-weather road on Long Island. It began in Jamaica, the county seat of Queens County and an important railroad junction located in the east-central part of the county. Montauk Highway was routed in a southeasterly direction toward the Atlantic Ocean coastline of Long Island, turning in an east-northeasterly direction in current Nassau County to more or less parallel the shore through Suffolk County, ending at Montauk Point, the easternmost point of land on the South Fork of the island. As an all-weather road, Montauk Highway has rarely been breached by even serious storms; however, portions in the Hamptons were flooded out by the New England Hurricane of 1938.

The current road is no longer a single route-designated road. In Queens, it is a city street known as Merrick Boulevard. Through Nassau County, it is a two-to-four lane highway with traffic lights known as Merrick Road. This name is derived from the community of Merrick, through which the road passes. As such, the Montauk Highway name now applies to the section that lies within Suffolk County.

===Initial designations===
Montauk Highway and Merrick Road were designated as NY 27 from the New York City line to Amagansett in the mid-1920s. From East Patchogue to Brookhaven, NY 27 followed South Country Road instead, which was part of Montauk Highway at the time. The NY 27 designation was extended eastward along Montauk Highway to Montauk Point by 1930. On February 24, 1930, South Country Road was added to the Suffolk County highway system as CR 36. NY 27 and Montauk Highway were realigned to directly connect East Patchogue and Brookhaven via North Bellport.

NY 27 was realigned west of Great River to follow Sunrise Boulevard (the predecessor to Sunrise Highway), a new, parallel highway to Merrick Road and Montauk Highway between the New York City line and Massapequa and several local roads from Massapequa to Montauk Highway in Great River. The former routing of NY 27 on Montauk Highway from Massapequa to Great River became NY 27A, which connected to NY 27 in Massapequa by way of County Line Road. NY 27A was extended eastward along Montauk Highway to Patchogue in the early 1950s, after NY 27 was realigned to follow a new highway between Great River and Patchogue. A controlled-access extension of NY 27 to Shirley opened to traffic in the late 1950s, at which time NY 27A was extended eastward along NY 27&#x27;s former routing to meet NY 27 in Shirley.

Construction on a new alignment for NY 27 between NY 24 in Hampton Bays and Montauk Highway near Water Mill began by 1961 and was completed around 1962. The section of Montauk Highway between the two locations became part of NY 27A, even though it did not connect to any other part of the route. An extension of the Patchogue–Shirley limited-access highway to the vicinity of Eastport was completed as a realignment of NY 27 by 1964, allowing NY 27A to be extended once more along Montauk Highway. NY 27A was also extended east to Hampton Bays at this time, connecting to the segment of NY 27A between Hampton Bays and Water Mill and creating an overlap with NY 27.

===Maintenance transfers===
Ownership and maintenance of Montauk Highway between Great River and the town of Southampton was gradually transferred from the state of New York to Suffolk County during the 1960s and 1970s. The portion from the Patchogue village line east to NY 24 in Hampton Bays was turned over to the county on October 6, 1966, while the segment between NY 24 and Knoll Road was given to Suffolk County on February 15, 1968. This section of Montauk Highway became CR 80, a route in length. The CR 80 designation was previously used for the Nesconset–Port Jefferson Highway, a road acquired by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and designated NY 347 in 1966.

Although most of Montauk Highway between Patchogue and the village of Southampton was now maintained by the county, NY 27A continued to follow the road eastward to NY 27 northeast of Southampton. It was finally cut back to its current eastern terminus in Great River on March 29, 1972, after ownership and maintenance of Montauk Highway between Great River and CR 19 in Patchogue was transferred from the state to the county. The new county road was redesignated CR 85, a number used for the Smithtown Bypass until 1966, when that road was transferred to NYSDOT and designated NY 347. A section of Montauk Highway between Knoll Road to the west village line of Southampton at Tuckahoe Lane was retained by the state of New York and designated NY 900W, an unsigned reference route.

Between the east end of CR 98 and the vicinity of the west end of CR 71, the Suffolk County Department of Public Works had once planned to widen the road from two lanes to four lanes.

===Realignments===
Over the years, Montauk Highway has been realigned in several locations. The former segments are now known by another name or as Old Montauk Highway, notably at Theodore Roosevelt County Park east of Montauk, where new Montauk Highway heads northeast through Montauk Point State Park while Old Montauk Highway heads east as a narrow hilly road next to the shoreline. Other significant realignments include the aforementioned rerouting between East Patchogue and Brookhaven and another in the vicinity of Eastport, where CR 71 (Old Country Road) was part of Montauk Highway between the current road and Eastport–Manor Road (CR 55). From there, Montauk Highway turned south along CR 55 to reconnect to its modern routing. Another former section is located between Montauk Beach and Montauk, where the modern road was altered to bypass the former to the north. The old road breaks from the current highway inside Hither Hills State Park and heads through Montauk Beach before rejoining the highway between South Dearborn Place and Second House Road.

Many smaller sections also exist:
* Great River: a segment split in two broken as a result of the Oakdale Merge, both used to access fishing areas in Connetquot River State Park: Bubble Falls and Rattlesnake Brook
* Sayville: Amy Drive to Old Broadway Avenue
* Brookhaven: in front of a private residence near Yaphank Avenue
* South Haven: Old South Country Road
* Mastic: Old Montauk Highway from Washington Avenue to Mastic Road
* Moriches: from Barnes Road on the East Lake of the Forge River to an undetermined location
* Center Moriches: private road east of Old Neck Road leading to houses north of the LIRR Montauk Branch.
* East Moriches: Camp Paquatuck to Mill Pond Lane.
* Speonk: Old Montauk Highway in the vicinity of Mill Road
* Water Mill: Old Country Road
* Wainscott: Old Montauk Highway in the vicinity of Wainscott Stone Road

<text>The 1957 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 32nd term. It saw the governing National Party narrowly defeated by the Labour Party. The 1957 elections marked the beginning of the second Labour government, although this administration was to last only a single term.

==Background==
The National Party had formed its first administration after the 1949 elections, and had been re-elected in the 1951 elections and the 1954 elections. As its third term in office continued, however, the Prime Minister, Sidney Holland, became increasingly ill. Holland&#x27;s memory began to fail, and he is believed to have suffered a mild heart attack while working in his office during the Suez Crisis. In mid-1957 a group of senior cabinet ministers led by Keith Holyoake, Jack Marshall, Jack Watts and party president, Sir Alex McKenzie, persuaded Holland to resign citing his health deterioration. Holland, albeit reluctantly, announced his retirement from the leadership at the National&#x27;s annual party conference on 12 August 1957 held in Christchurch. Almost immediately after finishing his speech Holland collapsed backstage and was rushed to hospital in an ambulance. Although his retirement was announced in August, Holland&#x27;s continued presence prevented his successor, the deputy prime minister Holyoake, from establishing himself as a leader until late October, when at last he formed his own ministry which was still largely the same as his predecessor&#x27;s.

Leadership was to play a key issue in the election. After spending many years in Holland&#x27;s shadow, Holyoake, a reserved man lacking Holland&#x27;s rapport with crowds, was unable to achieve any clear popular image in his own right. Labour&#x27;s Walter Nash, by contrast, was one of the best-known people in the country, having been a party leader for many years and having been Finance Minister in the first Labour government before that.

Labour opened its campaign on 5 November with Nash broadcasting a speech from the Auckland Town Hall (despites some reservations of it coinciding with Guy Fawkes night). The speech, mainly regarding Labour&#x27;s economic policies, was regarded by listeners as excellent with Nash in fine speaking form. Nash would give over twenty other speeches at public meetings throughout the country where he attracted large and receptive crowds. One daytime meeting late in the campaign, Nash arrived behind schedule, and a crowd of employees forfeited an hour&#x27;s pay (having already taken their lunchbreak) so they could hear him speak. Holyoake, by contrast, attracted little interest in his meeting addresses (particularly in the South Island).

In terms of policy, the election campaign was dominated largely by financial issues, particularly regarding the introduction of the PAYE system of income tax. As a campaign promise, Labour announced that in the year that PAYE commenced, there would be a flat rebate of £100 on income tax. National, seeing the popularity of the policy, was forced into offering a similar policy. The Labour Party&#x27;s president, Mick Moohan, seeing this popularity came to the view that the election was akin to an auction. He published a newspaper advertisement which boldly asked: &#x27;DO YOU WANT £100 OR NOT?&#x27;. Nash found the ad distasteful thinking it could be interpreted as a bribe. National attacked the ad as misleading by implying that everyone would receive a £100 rebate, whether or not they actually paid as much as £100 in tax.

Labour also campaigned to abolish compulsory military training, opposing nuclear tests, 3% housing loans, increased pension payments, free textbooks for school children and industrialisation. National made no great changes to its existing policy platform.

===MPs retiring in 1957===
Six National MPs intended to retire at the end of the 31st Parliament. No Labour MPs retired.

Jack Massey also left parliament at the election. He intended to stand again in but was deselected as a candidate by the National Party.

==The election==
The date for the main 1957 election was 30 November. 1,252,329 people were registered to vote, and turnout was 92.9%. This turnout, although only average for the time, was not to be equalled or exceeded until the 1984 election. The number of seats being contested was 80, a number which had been fixed since 1902.

The Labour candidate for Clutha, Bruce Waters, died the day before the general election, and the election there was postponed to 18 January 1958. The unusual situation of an electorate vote being delayed due to the death of a candidate did not occur again until the 2023 election.

==Election results==

===Party standings===
The 1957 election saw the governing National Party defeated by a narrow two-seat margin. It had previously held a ten-seat majority. National won a total of thirty-nine seats, while the Labour Party won forty-one. In the popular vote, National won 44% to Labour&#x27;s 48%. The Social Credit Party won 7% of the vote, a drop from its previous result of 11%. It still won no seats.

==Post-election events==
A number of local by-elections were required due to the resignations of incumbent local body politicians following the general election:

* Hugh Watt resigned his seat on the Auckland Harbour Board on 17 December 1957 after his appointment to cabinet.
* There were two by-elections for the Christchurch City Council. Councillors Mabel Howard and John Mathison also resigned their seats following their election as cabinet ministers at the formation of the Second Labour government causing a by-election to replace them on the council. Likewise Robert Macfarlane resigned as Mayor of Christchurch upon his selection as Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives. Macfarlane was succeeded as mayor by councillor George Manning. McFarlane was elected for one of the vacant seats on the council, with the other seats being won by Bill Glue, Bill MacGibbon and Peter Skellerup.

<doc id="1236730" wikidata="Q1216998" url="?curid=1236730" title="Neoplasm">
<text>A neoplasm () is a type of abnormal and excessive growth of tissue. The process that occurs to form or produce a neoplasm is called neoplasia. The growth of a neoplasm is uncoordinated with that of the normal surrounding tissue, and persists in growing abnormally, even if the original trigger is removed. This abnormal growth usually forms a mass, which may be called a tumour or tumor.&quot;

ICD-10 classifies neoplasms into four main groups: benign neoplasms, in situ neoplasms, malignant neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior. Malignant neoplasms are also simply known as cancers and are the focus of oncology.

Prior to the abnormal growth of tissue, such as neoplasia, cells often undergo an abnormal pattern of growth, such as metaplasia or dysplasia. However, metaplasia or dysplasia does not always progress to neoplasia and can occur in other conditions as well. The word neoplasm is from Ancient Greek &#x27;new&#x27; and &#x27;formation, creation&#x27;.

==Types==

A neoplasm can be benign, potentially malignant, or malignant (cancer).
* Benign tumors include uterine fibroids, osteophytes, and melanocytic nevi (skin moles). They are circumscribed and localized and do not transform into cancer.
* Potentially-malignant neoplasms include carcinoma in situ. They are localised, and do not invade and destroy but in time, may transform into cancer.
* Malignant neoplasms are commonly called cancer. They invade and destroy the surrounding tissue, may form metastases and, if untreated or unresponsive to treatment, will generally prove fatal.
* Secondary neoplasm refers to any of a class of cancerous tumor that is either a metastatic offshoot of a primary tumor, or an apparently unrelated tumor that increases in frequency following certain cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
* Rarely there can be a metastatic neoplasm with no known site of the primary cancer and this is classed as a cancer of unknown primary origin.

===Clonality===
Neoplastic tumors are often heterogeneous and contain more than one type of cell, but their initiation and continued growth are usually dependent on a single population of neoplastic cells. These cells are presumed to be monoclonal – that is, they are derived from the same cell, and all carry the same genetic or epigenetic anomaly – evident of clonality. For lymphoid neoplasms, e.g. lymphoma and leukemia, clonality is proven by the amplification of a single rearrangement of their immunoglobulin gene (for B cell lesions) or T cell receptor gene (for T cell lesions). The demonstration of clonality is now considered to be necessary to identify a lymphoid cell proliferation as neoplastic.

===Neoplasm vs. tumor===
The word &quot;tumor&quot; or &quot;tumour&quot; comes from the Latin word for &quot;swelling&quot;, which is one of the cardinal signs of inflammation. The word originally referred to any form of swelling, neoplastic or not. In modern English, &quot;tumor (non-US spelling: tumour)&quot; is used as a synonym for a neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled cystic lesion that may or may not be formed by an abnormal growth of neoplastic cells) that appears enlarged in size. Some neoplasms do not form a tumor; these include leukemia and most forms of carcinoma in situ. &quot;Tumor&quot; is also not synonymous with &quot;cancer.&quot; While cancer is by definition malignant, a tumor can be benign, precancerous, or malignant.

The terms &quot;mass&quot; and &quot;nodule&quot; are often used synonymously with &quot;tumor&quot;. Generally speaking, however, the term &quot;tumor&quot; is used generically, without reference to the physical size of the lesion. More specifically, the term &quot;mass&quot; is often used when the lesion has a maximal diameter of at least 20 millimeters (mm) in the greatest direction, while the term &quot;nodule&quot; is usually used when the size of the lesion is less than 20 mm in its greatest dimension (25.4 mm = 1 inch).

== Causes ==
Tumors in humans occur as a result of accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations within single cells, which cause the cell to divide and expand uncontrollably. A neoplasm can be caused by an abnormal proliferation of tissues, which can be caused by genetic mutations. Not all types of neoplasms cause a tumorous overgrowth of tissue (such as leukemia or carcinoma in situ), however similarities between neoplasmic growths and regenerative processes, e.g., dedifferentiation and rapid cell proliferation, have been pointed out.

Tumor growth has been studied using mathematics and continuum mechanics. Vascular tumors such as hemangiomas and lymphangiomas (formed from blood or lymph vessels) are thus looked at as being amalgams of a solid skeleton formed by sticky cells and an organic liquid filling the spaces in which cells can grow. Under this type of model, mechanical stresses and strains can be dealt with and their influence on the growth of the tumor and the surrounding tissue and vasculature elucidated. Recent findings from experiments that use this model show that active growth of the tumor is restricted to the outer edges of the tumor and that stiffening of the underlying normal tissue inhibits tumor growth as well.

Benign conditions that are &quot;not&quot; associated with an abnormal proliferation of tissue (such as sebaceous cysts) can also present as tumors, however, but have no malignant potential. Breast cysts (as occur commonly during pregnancy and at other times) are another example, as are other encapsulated glandular swellings (thyroid, adrenal gland, pancreas).

Encapsulated hematomas, encapsulated necrotic tissue (from an insect bite, foreign body, or other noxious mechanism), keloids (discrete overgrowths of scar tissue) and granulomas may also present as tumors.

Discrete localized enlargements of normal structures (ureters, blood vessels, intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ducts, pulmonary inclusions, or gastrointestinal duplications) due to outflow obstructions or narrowings, or abnormal connections, may also present as a tumor. Examples are arteriovenous fistulae or aneurysms (with or without thrombosis), biliary fistulae or aneurysms, sclerosing cholangitis, cysticercosis or hydatid cysts, intestinal duplications, and pulmonary inclusions as seen with cystic fibrosis. It can be dangerous to biopsy a number of types of tumor in which the leakage of their contents would potentially be catastrophic. When such types of tumors are encountered, diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, angiograms, and nuclear medicine scans are employed prior to (or during) biopsy or surgical exploration/excision in an attempt to avoid such severe complications.

==Malignant neoplasms==

===DNA damage===

DNA damage is considered to be the primary underlying cause of malignant neoplasms known as cancers. Its central role in progression to cancer is illustrated in the figure in this section, in the box near the top. (The central features of DNA damage, epigenetic alterations and deficient DNA repair in progression to cancer are shown in red.) DNA damage is very common. Naturally occurring DNA damages (mostly due to cellular metabolism and the properties of DNA in water at body temperatures) occur at a rate of more than 10,000 new damages, on average, per human cell, per day. Additional DNA damages can arise from exposure to exogenous agents. Tobacco smoke causes increased exogenous DNA damage, and these DNA damages are the likely cause of lung cancer due to smoking. UV light from solar radiation causes DNA damage that is important in melanoma. &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection produces high levels of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA and contributes to gastric cancer. Bile acids, at high levels in the colons of humans eating a high fat diet, also cause DNA damage and contribute to colon cancer. Katsurano et al. indicated that macrophages and neutrophils in an inflamed colonic epithelium are the source of reactive oxygen species causing the DNA damages that initiate colonic tumorigenesis (creation of tumors in the colon). Some sources of DNA damage are indicated in the boxes at the top of the figure in this section.

Individuals with a germline mutation causing deficiency in any of 34 DNA repair genes (see article DNA repair-deficiency disorder) are at increased risk of cancer. Some germline mutations in DNA repair genes cause up to 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g., p53 mutations). These germline mutations are indicated in a box at the left of the figure with an arrow indicating their contribution to DNA repair deficiency.

About 70% of malignant (cancerous) neoplasms have no hereditary component and are called &quot;sporadic cancers&quot;. Only a minority of sporadic cancers have a deficiency in DNA repair due to mutation in a DNA repair gene. However, a majority of sporadic cancers have deficiency in DNA repair due to epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence DNA repair gene expression. For example, of 113 sequential colorectal cancers, only four had a missense mutation in the DNA repair gene MGMT, while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region (an epigenetic alteration). Five reports present evidence that between 40% and 90% of colorectal cancers have reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region.

Similarly, out of 119 cases of mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers that lacked DNA repair gene PMS2 expression, PMS2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene, while in 103 cases PMS2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner MLH1 was repressed due to promoter methylation (PMS2 protein is unstable in the absence of MLH1). In the other 10 cases, loss of PMS2 expression was likely due to epigenetic overexpression of the microRNA, miR-155, which down-regulates MLH1.

In further examples, epigenetic defects were found at frequencies of between 13%-100% for the DNA repair genes BRCA1, WRN, FANCB, FANCF, MGMT, MLH1, MSH2, MSH4, ERCC1, XPF, NEIL1 and ATM. These epigenetic defects occurred in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, colorectal, and head and neck cancers. Two or three deficiencies in expression of ERCC1, XPF or PMS2 occur simultaneously in the majority of the 49 colon cancers evaluated by Facista et al. Epigenetic alterations causing reduced expression of DNA repair genes is shown in a central box at the third level from the top of the figure in this section, and the consequent DNA repair deficiency is shown at the fourth level.

When expression of DNA repair genes is reduced, DNA damages accumulate in cells at a higher than normal level, and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation or epimutation. Mutation rates strongly increase in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair or in homologous recombinational repair (HRR).

During repair of DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damages, incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause epigenetic gene silencing. DNA repair deficiencies (level 4 in the figure) cause increased DNA damages (level 5 in the figure) which result in increased somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations (level 6 in the figure).

Field defects, normal-appearing tissue with multiple alterations (and discussed in the section below), are common precursors to development of the disordered and improperly proliferating clone of tissue in a malignant neoplasm. Such field defects (second level from bottom of figure) may have multiple mutations and epigenetic alterations.

Once a cancer is formed, it usually has genome instability. This instability is likely due to reduced DNA repair or excessive DNA damage. Because of such instability, the cancer continues to evolve and to produce sub clones. For example, a renal cancer, sampled in 9 areas, had 40 ubiquitous mutations, demonstrating tumor heterogeneity (i.e. present in all areas of the cancer), 59 mutations shared by some (but not all areas), and 29 &quot;private&quot; mutations only present in one of the areas of the cancer.

===Field defects===

Various other terms have been used to describe this phenomenon, including &quot;field effect&quot;, &quot;field cancerization&quot;, and &quot;field carcinogenesis&quot;. The term &quot;field cancerization&quot; was first used in 1953 to describe an area or &quot;field&quot; of epithelium that has been preconditioned by (at that time) largely unknown processes so as to predispose it towards development of cancer. Since then, the terms &quot;field cancerization&quot; and &quot;field defect&quot; have been used to describe pre-malignant tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise.

Field defects are important in progression to cancer. However, in most cancer research, as pointed out by Rubin &quot;The vast majority of studies in cancer research has been done on well-defined tumors in vivo, or on discrete neoplastic foci in vitro. Yet there is evidence that more than 80% of the somatic mutations found in mutator phenotype human colorectal tumors occur before the onset of terminal clonal expansion. Similarly, Vogelstein et al. point out that more than half of somatic mutations identified in tumors occurred in a pre-neoplastic phase (in a field defect), during growth of apparently normal cells. Likewise, epigenetic alterations present in tumors may have occurred in pre-neoplastic field defects.

An expanded view of field effect has been termed &quot;etiologic field effect&quot;, which encompasses not only molecular and pathologic changes in pre-neoplastic cells but also influences of exogenous environmental factors and molecular changes in the local microenvironment on neoplastic evolution from tumor initiation to patient death.

In the colon, a field defect probably arises by natural selection of a mutant or epigenetically altered cell among the stem cells at the base of one of the intestinal crypts on the inside surface of the colon. A mutant or epigenetically altered stem cell may replace the other nearby stem cells by natural selection. Thus, a patch of abnormal tissue may arise. The figure in this section includes a photo of a freshly resected and lengthwise-opened segment of the colon showing a colon cancer and four polyps. Below the photo, there is a schematic diagram of how a large patch of mutant or epigenetically altered cells may have formed, shown by the large area in yellow in the diagram. Within this first large patch in the diagram (a large clone of cells), a second such mutation or epigenetic alteration may occur so that a given stem cell acquires an advantage compared to other stem cells within the patch, and this altered stem cell may expand clonally forming a secondary patch, or sub-clone, within the original patch. This is indicated in the diagram by four smaller patches of different colors within the large yellow original area. Within these new patches (sub-clones), the process may be repeated multiple times, indicated by the still smaller patches within the four secondary patches (with still different colors in the diagram) which clonally expand, until stem cells arise that generate either small polyps or else a malignant neoplasm (cancer).

In the photo, an apparent field defect in this segment of a colon has generated four polyps (labeled with the size of the polyps, 6mm, 5mm, and two of 3mm, and a cancer about 3 cm across in its longest dimension). These neoplasms are also indicated, in the diagram below the photo, by 4 small tan circles (polyps) and a larger red area (cancer). The cancer in the photo occurred in the cecal area of the colon, where the colon joins the small intestine (labeled) and where the appendix occurs (labeled). The fat in the photo is external to the outer wall of the colon. In the segment of colon shown here, the colon was cut open lengthwise to expose the inner surface of the colon and to display the cancer and polyps occurring within the inner epithelial lining of the colon.

If the general process by which sporadic colon cancers arise is the formation of a pre-neoplastic clone that spreads by natural selection, followed by formation of internal sub-clones within the initial clone, and sub-sub-clones inside those, then colon cancers generally should be associated with, and be preceded by, fields of increasing abnormality reflecting the succession of premalignant events. The most extensive region of abnormality (the outermost yellow irregular area in the diagram) would reflect the earliest event in formation of a malignant neoplasm.

In experimental evaluation of specific DNA repair deficiencies in cancers, many specific DNA repair deficiencies were also shown to occur in the field defects surrounding those cancers. The Table, below, gives examples for which the DNA repair deficiency in a cancer was shown to be caused by an epigenetic alteration, and the somewhat lower frequencies with which the same epigenetically caused DNA repair deficiency was found in the surrounding field defect.
Some of the small polyps in the field defect shown in the photo of the opened colon segment may be relatively benign neoplasms. Of polyps less than 10mm in size, found during colonoscopy and followed with repeat colonoscopies for 3 years, 25% were unchanged in size, 35% regressed or shrank in size while 40% grew in size.

===Genome instability===
Cancers are known to exhibit genome instability or a mutator phenotype. The protein-coding DNA within the nucleus is about 1.5% of the total genomic DNA. Within this protein-coding DNA (called the exome), an average cancer of the breast or colon can have about 60 to 70 protein altering mutations, of which about 3 or 4 may be &quot;driver&quot; mutations, and the remaining ones may be &quot;passenger&quot; mutations. However, the average number of DNA sequence mutations in the entire genome (including non-protein-coding regions) within a breast cancer tissue sample is about 20,000. In an average melanoma tissue sample (where melanomas have a higher exome mutation frequency) the total number of DNA sequence mutations is about 80,000. This compares to the very low mutation frequency of about 70 new mutations in the entire genome between generations (parent to child) in humans.

The high frequencies of mutations in the total nucleotide sequences within cancers suggest that often an early alteration in the field defects giving rise to a cancer (e.g. yellow area in the diagram in this section) is a deficiency in DNA repair. The large field defects surrounding colon cancers (extending to at about 10 cm on each side of a cancer) were shown by Facista et al. to frequently have epigenetic defects in 2 or 3 DNA repair proteins (ERCC1, XPF or PMS2) in the entire area of the field defect. Deficiencies in DNA repair cause increased mutation rates. A deficiency in DNA repair, itself, can allow DNA damages to accumulate, and error-prone translesion synthesis past some of those damages may give rise to mutations. In addition, faulty repair of these accumulated DNA damages may give rise to epimutations. These new mutations or epimutations may provide a proliferative advantage, generating a field defect. Although the mutations/epimutations in DNA repair genes do not, themselves, confer a selective advantage, they may be carried along as passengers in cells when the cells acquire additional mutations/epimutations that do provide a proliferative advantage.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;neoplasm&quot; is a synonym of &quot;tumor&quot;. &quot;Neoplasia&quot; denotes the process of the formation of neoplasms/tumors, and the process is referred to as a &quot;neoplastic&quot; process. The word &quot;neoplastic&quot; itself comes from Greek &#x27;new&#x27; and &#x27;formed, molded&#x27;.

The term &quot;tumor&quot; derives from the Latin noun &#x27;a swelling&#x27;, ultimately from the verb &#x27;to swell&#x27;. In the British Commonwealth, the spelling &quot;tumour&quot; is commonly used, whereas in the U.S. the word is usually spelled &quot;tumor&quot;.

In its medical sense, &quot;tumor&quot; has traditionally meant an abnormal swelling of the flesh. The Roman medical encyclopedist Celsus ( 30 BC–38 AD) described the four cardinal signs of acute inflammation as , , , and (swelling, pain, increased heat, and redness). (His treatise, &quot;De Medicina&quot;, was the first medical book printed in 1478 following the invention of the movable-type printing press.)

In contemporary English, the word &quot;tumor&quot; is often used as a synonym for a cystic (liquid-filled) growth or solid neoplasm (cancerous or non-cancerous), with other forms of swelling often referred to as &quot;swellings&quot;.

Related terms occur commonly in the medical literature, where the nouns &quot;tumefaction&quot; and &quot;tumescence&quot; (derived from the adjective &quot;tumescent&quot;) are current medical terms for non-neoplastic swelling. This type of swelling is most often caused by inflammation caused by trauma, infection, and other factors.

Tumors may be caused by conditions other than an overgrowth of neoplastic cells, however. Cysts (such as sebaceous cysts) are also referred to as tumors, even though they have no neoplastic cells. This is standard in medical-billing terminology (especially when billing for a growth whose pathology has yet to be determined).

<text>Party City Holdco Inc. was an American chain of party stores founded in 1986 by Steve Mandell in East Hanover, New Jersey. Party City&#x27;s headquarters are in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. Party City is the largest retailer of party goods in Canada, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. Party City operates over 850 company-owned and franchise outlets in over 70 countries around the world under the Party City, Halloween City, Toy City, Factory Card and Party Outlet brands. In December 2024, Party City filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, laid off all administrative employees, and announced they would liquidate and close most remaining stores in the United States. Stores not operated by Party City Holdco, such as those in Canada, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii, are unaffected and will continue to operate.

==History==
Party City was founded by Steve Mandell in 1986. Mandell recognized that the market for party goods was highly fragmented, with many small mom-and-pop operations. He noticed that a large number of retailers carried limited supplies. Additionally, he saw that many big players were trying to dominate the party goods market. After scraping together $125,000, Mandell opened a store in East Hanover, New Jersey, naming it Party City. The operation was immediately successful, and within a year, Mandell began planning for a second location. He also began to hear from people asking to franchise the Party City concept, and as a result, Party City began its evolution into a national chain. After his first year in business, Mandell also decided to concentrate on Halloween. In 1987, over a quarter of his store was turned into a &quot;Halloween Costume Warehouse&quot;. The move proved highly successful and led to the company&#x27;s ongoing focus on the holiday, and the major impact that the month of October would have on Party City&#x27;s bottom line. Year-round, Party City stocked an inventory of Halloween costumes for no reason other than to make customers aware of the items for the next Halloween season. One quarter ($560 million) of Party City&#x27;s 2015 revenue came from Halloween; the company operates about 300 Halloween City pop-up stores. Party City started franchising stores in 1989, with the first franchise store located in Hazlet, New Jersey. By 1990, Mandell also owned four Party City stores. At this point, he incorporated the business as a franchising operation, with his stores forming the core of the chain. By the end of 1990, Party City outlets numbered 11; five more franchised stores were added in 1991, 16 in 1992, and another 26 in 1993, bringing the total to 58. Party City was now a nationwide chain with store locations ranging from Hawaii to Puerto Rico. Party City&#x27;s annual revenues in 1993 topped $2.4 million and net profits approached $235,000. During these first four years of operation, Mandell refined the Party City concept, including store design, product mix, choice of suppliers, and the implementation of systems. In late 1993, with a successful store model in hand, Mandell decided to de-emphasize franchising in favor of opening company-owned stores, which would generate greater returns for the corporation than it could receive on fees and royalties from franchised outlets, as well as allow Mandell to better control the destiny of Party City. While franchisees might maintain tighter inventory control, Mandell insisted that company-owned units would be amply stocked with a wide range of merchandise.

In 2005, Party City was sold to a subsidiary of AAH Holdings Corporation, owner of Amscan, a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of party goods in America. Amscan then went on to acquire the party retailers Party America in 2006 and Factory Card &amp; Party Outlet in 2007. Both retail chains began to operate under the Party City network, thereby making Party City the largest party supplies retailer in the United States. With Amscan&#x27;s 2011 acquisition of American Greetings&#x27; Designware party division, Party City added licensing agreements with Nickelodeon, Sesame Workshop, and Hasbro. In 2011, Amscan became a licensee for MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, and NCAA party products and balloons, with Party City carrying all teams in their respective markets and offering the entire assortment in larger stores and online. In 2011, Party City expanded outside the United States with the acquisition of the Canadian retailer Party Packagers, making Party City the largest party goods retailer in North America. In 2012, these stores began to re-brand as Party City. In 2013, Party City bought iParty. In December 2017, Party City acquired MG Novelty Corporation for about $5.5 million; that Party City operated seven retail stores under the name Party Galaxy in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. In 2017, Party City purchased its franchised locations in the Carolinas. In 2012, Advent International, Berkshire Partners LLC, and Weston Presidio sold a majority stake in Party City to Thomas H. Lee Partners. In 2015, Party City Holdco Inc. went public, with Thomas H. Lee Partners retaining 55% and Advent International owning 19 percent. In April 2017, a private equity firm approached Party City to acquire it. In response, Party City placed itself on the market.In June 2018, Party City announced that it would open around 50 Toy City pop-up stores beginning in September 2018, alongside its Halloween City stores. The stores operated through the conclusion of the holiday season and were meant to capitalize upon the closure of the U.S. locations of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us. Some of its locations used vacancies created by the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us shutdown. In May 2019, Party City announced that it would close 45 locations &quot;to help optimize our market-level performance, focus on the most profitable locations, and improve the overall health of our store portfolio&quot;. In August 2019, Party City&#x27;s Canadian operations were acquired by Canadian Tire for $174.4 million CAD.
On January 17, 2023, Party City Holdco Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, weighed down by a confluence of factors including the COVID-19 pandemic and changing consumer behaviors. The move was part of an attempt to restructure and reduce Party City&#x27;s debt. Party City secured $150 million in financing to keep its stores open and operations running. Party City said that the move would help it complete an &quot;expedited restructuring&quot; to reduce its debt, which should be done by the second quarter of 2023. On September 6, 2023, Party City officially announced they had completed their bankruptcy reorganization after a US judge approved their bankruptcy plans. Party City was able to eliminate over $1 billion of debt during the reorganization. Most of its stores were expected to stay open until 2025; however, a handful of its 800 stores had permanently shuttered by the end of 2023, notably underperforming and less productive locations, and stores in underdeveloped and obsolete areas. 

In December 2024, Party City warned that it would be preparing to file for bankruptcy for the second time in two years, as it was running out of cash to continue operating at several of its locations. Party City announced that it would close all of its corporate-owned US stores by February 28, 2025, as part of a winding-down procedure. Franchised locations not owned by Party City, as well as Canadian locations, will remain open, the latter of which is currently owned by Canadian Tire. 

On December 24, 2024, Party City reported that Mitch Modell, former CEO of Modell&#x27;s Sporting Goods, was looking to buy Party City in an effort to save thousands of jobs. Modell planned to release financing sheets by the end of that week, but nothing further has been announced as of January 2025.

Party City auctioned off leases for nearly 700 store locations across 45 states. By early 2025, these auctions had generated around $14.5 million. Among the top bidders for these store leases were Dollar Tree, which secured 150 leases, and Five Below, which acquired 40. Other participants in the bidding included Barnes &amp; Noble, La-Z-Boy, and Rack Room Shoes. In addition to the physical assets, the intellectual property and wholesale business operations of Party City were sold to an affiliate of Ad Populum for $20 million. Ad Populum, known for products like the Chia Pet and The Clapper, now holds the rights to continue Party City&#x27;s tradition in party goods manufacturing under the newly formed company New Amscan.

<doc id="1236739" wikidata="Q1272740" url="?curid=1236739" title="Dōtanuki">
<text>is a name of a Japanese school of swordsmiths from Higo province who produced swords in the &quot;Bizen&quot; tradition during the feudal period of Japan.

==Dotanuki School==
The Dotanuki school evolved in Higo Province with its ancestry going back to the famous &quot;Enju Kunimura&quot; (延寿 国村). Enju Kunimura founded the Higo Enju school in approximately 1305. Kunimura was born in Yamato province to the swordsmith Hiromura. He moved to Yamashiro province, became a student of Rai Kuniyuki, and later married Kuniyuki&#x27;s daughter. Kunimura then moved to Higo and founded the Enju school. There are only six blades by Kunimura known to exist.

The Dotanuki school emerged in the small Higo village of Dotanuki in the mid-16th century, following the decline of the Higo Enju school in the latter part of the Koto period. The Dotanuki school founder is said to be Dotanuki Masakuni, he was called Oyama Kozuke no Suke and his original signature was Nobuyoshi. The famous general Katō Kiyomasa honored Masakuni with one character of his name, and from that point onward Nobuyoshi was known as Masakuni. However, the majority of his works are only signed &quot;Dotanuki Kozuke no Suke&quot;.

Dotanuki swords quickly gained great popularity among the warrior class due to their superior cutting ability. The Dotanuki smiths cared little for aesthetics, but instead focused on strength, sharpness, and durability in the field. They were renowned for producing blades which would endure the harshest conditions, the most difficult battlefield situations and survive to return to battle day after day, year after year.

==Fictional references==
The dōtanuki has appeared in several entertainment outlets, featured as a blade wider and thicker than any normal build of katana. Ogami Ittō in the manga &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; had a dōtanuki (using the spelling 胴太貫 “torso–thick–penetrate”) as his principal weapon. The katana named &quot;Gassan&quot; in Soulcalibur II and Soulcalibur III is a dōtanuki. &quot;Gassan&quot; is wielded by Heishiro Mitsurugi in Soulcalibur II.

Many works of historical fiction write &quot;dōtanuki&quot; with different characters as 胴田貫 (roughly &quot;torso–paddy–penetrate&quot;), with a folk etymology claiming it is because when used to cut the torso of a cadaver lying down in a paddy, the sword would pierce right through it and into the field. This name and story apparently originated in fiction, as they are not found in any historical manuals or catalogues.

<text>Jayhawker and red leg are terms that came to prominence in Kansas Territory during the Bleeding Kansas period of the 1850s; they were adopted by militant bands affiliated with the free-state cause during the American Civil War. These gangs were guerrillas who often clashed with pro-slavery groups from Missouri, known at the time in Kansas Territory as &quot;Border Ruffians&quot; or &quot;Bushwhackers&quot;. After the Civil War, the word &quot;Jayhawker&quot; became synonymous with the people of Kansas, or anybody born in Kansas. Today a modified version of the term, Jayhawk, is used as a nickname for a native-born Kansan.

==Origin==

===Early usage===
The term did not appear in the first American edition of Burtlett&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Americanisms&quot; (1848), but was entered into the fourth improved and enlarged edition in 1877 as a cant name for a freebooting armed man in the western United States.

It was established that the term was adopted as a nickname by a group of emigrants from Illinois traveling to California in 1849, who got stuck in the Death Valley.

In 1858–59, the slang term &quot;Jayhawking&quot; became widely used as a synonym for stealing. Examples include:

O&#x27;ive been over till Eph. Kepley&#x27;s a-jayhawking.

Men are now at Fort Scott, working by the day for a living as loyal as Gen. Blunt himself, who have had every hoof confiscated, or jayhawked, which is about the same thing, for all the benefit it is to the Government.

=== Missouri–Kansas border lexicon===
The term became part of the lexicon of the Missouri–Kansas border in about 1858, during the Kansas territorial period. The term came to be used to describe militant bands nominally associated with the free-state cause. One early Kansas history contained this succinct characterization of the Jayhawkers: 

Farmer&#x27;s &quot;Americanisms, old and new&quot; (1889) linked the term with anti-slavery advocates of late 1850s in Kansas.

G. Murlin Welch, a historian of the territorial period, described the Jayhawkers as bands of men that were willing to fight, kill, and rob for a variety of motives that included defense against pro-slavery &quot;Border Ruffians&quot;, abolition, driving pro-slavery settlers from their claims of land, revenge, and/or plunder and personal profit.

While the &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; era is generally regarded as beginning in 1856, the earliest documented uses of the term &quot;jayhawker&quot; during the Kansas troubles were in the late 1850s, after the issue of slavery in Kansas had essentially been decided in favor of the Free State cause. The earliest dated mention of the name comes from the autobiography of August Bondi, who came to Kansas in 1855. Bondi said he observed General James Lane addressing his forces as Jayhawkers in December 1857.

Another early reference to the term (as applied to the Kansas troubles) emerging at that time is provided in the retrospective account of Kansas newspaperman John McReynolds. McReynolds reportedly picked up the term from Pat Devlin, a Free State partisan described as &quot;nothing more nor less than a dangerous bully.&quot; In mid-1858, McReynolds asked Devlin where he had acquired two fine horses that he had recently brought into the town of Osawatomie. Devlin replied that he &quot;got them as the Jayhawk gets its birds in Ireland&quot;, which he explained as follows: &quot;In Ireland a bird, which is called the Jayhawk, flies about after dark, seeking the roosts and nests of smaller birds, and not only robs nests of eggs, but frequently kills the birds.&quot; McReynolds understood Devlin had acquired his horses in the same manner the Jayhawk got its prey, and used the term in a Southern Kansas Herald newspaper column to describe a case of theft in the ongoing partisan violence. The term was quickly picked up by other newspapers, and &quot;Jayhawkers&quot; soon came to denote the militants and thieves affiliated with the Free State cause.

===Kansas Union troops===
The meaning of the jayhawker term evolved in the opening year of the American Civil War. When Charles Jennison, one of the territorial-era jayhawkers, was authorized to raise a regiment of cavalry to serve in the Union army, he characterized the unit as the &quot;Independent Kansas Jay-Hawkers&quot; on a recruiting poster. The regiment was officially termed the 7th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, but was popularly known as &quot;Jennison&#x27;s Jayhawkers&quot;. Thus, the term became associated with Union troops from Kansas. After the regiment was banished from the Missouri–Kansas border in the spring of 1862, it went on to participate in several battles including Union victories of the Battle of Iuka and the Second Battle of Corinth. Late in the war, the regiment returned to Kansas and contributed to Union victory in one of the last major battles in the Missouri–Kansas theater, the Battle of Mine Creek.

The Jayhawker term was applied not only to Jennison and his command, but to any Kansas troops engaged in punitive operations against the civilian population of western Missouri, in which the plundering and arson that characterized the territorial struggles were repeated, but on a much larger scale. For example, the term &quot;Jayhawkers&quot; also encompassed Senator Jim Lane and his Kansas Brigade, which sacked and burned Osceola, Missouri, in the opening months of the war after their defeat by Sterling Price&#x27;s Missouri State Guard in the Battle of Dry Wood Creek.

===Jayhawking in western Missouri===

Jayhawking was a prominent aspect of Union military operations in western Missouri during the first year of the war. In addition to Osceola, the smaller Missouri towns of Morristown, Papinsvile, Butler, Dayton, and Columbus and large numbers of rural homes were also pillaged by Kansas troops led by James Lane, Charles R. Jennison, Daniel Read Anthony, and James Montgomery, among others. Scores if not hundreds of Missouri families were burned out of their homes in the middle of the winter of 1862.

Union Major General Henry Halleck on January 18, 1862 in a letter to General Lorenzo Thomas described Jennison&#x27;s regiment as &quot;no better than a band of robbers; they cross the line, rob, steal, plunder, and burn whatever they can lay their hands upon. They disgrace the name and uniform of American soldiers and are driving good Union men into the ranks of the secession army.&quot; There were no charges against Lane, Jennison, or other officers under Lane&#x27;s command for their role in the jayhawking raids of 1861–1862, but Union General David H. Hunter succeeded in curtailing Lane&#x27;s military role, and units of Kansas troops such as the 7th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry were shuffled off to other theaters of the war.
Further compounding confusion over what the term Jayhawker meant along the Missouri–Kansas border was its use in describing outright criminals like Marshall Cleveland, a captain of Jennison&#x27;s Regiment, who resigned and turned to jayhawking. Cleveland operated under cover of supposed Unionism, but was outside the Union military command.

A newspaper reporter traveling through Kansas in 1863 provided definitions of jayhawker and associated terms: 

===Guerrilla fighting===
The depredations of the Jayhawkers contributed to the descent of the Missouri–Kansas border region into some of the most vicious guerrilla fighting of the Civil War. In the first year of the war, much of the movable wealth in western Missouri had been transferred to Kansas, and large swaths of western Missouri had been laid waste, by an assortment of Kansas Jayhawkers ranging from outlaws and independent military bands to rogue federal troops such as Lane&#x27;s Brigade and Jennison&#x27;s Jayhawkers. In February 1862, the Union command instituted martial law due to &quot;the crime of armed depredations or jay-hawking having reached a height dangerous to the peace and posterity to the whole State (Kansas) and seriously compromising the Union cause in the border counties of Missouri.&quot;

One expert on the Jayhawkers stated that the Border War would have been bad enough given the fighting between secessionist and unionist Missourians, &quot;but it was basically Kansas craving for revenge and Kansas craving for loot that set the tone of the war. Nowhere else, with the grim exception of the East Kentucky and East Tennessee mountains, did the Civil War degenerate so completely into a squalid, murderous, slugging match as it did in Kansas and Missouri.&quot; The most infamous event in this war of raids and reprisals was Confederate leader William Quantrill&#x27;s raid on Lawrence, Kansas, known as the Lawrence Massacre. In response to Quantrill&#x27;s raid, the Union command issued General Order No. 11 (1863), the forced depopulation of specified Missouri border counties.

Intended to eliminate sanctuary and sustenance for pro-Confederate guerrilla fighters, it was enforced by troops from Kansas, and provided an excuse for a final round of plundering, arson, and summary execution perpetrated against the civilian population of western Missouri. In the words of one observer, &quot;the Kansas–Missouri border was a disgrace even to barbarism.&quot;

===Different meanings===
As the war continued, the &quot;Jayhawker&quot; term came to be used by Confederates as a derogatory term for any troops from Kansas, but the term also had different meanings in different parts of the country. In Arkansas, the term was used by Confederate Arkansans as an epithet for any marauder, robber, or thief regardless of Union or Confederate affiliation. In Louisiana, the term was used to describe anti-Confederate guerrillas; in Texas, free-booting bands of draft dodgers and deserters.

Over time, proud of their state&#x27;s contributions to the end of slavery and the preservation of the Union, Kansans embraced the &quot;Jayhawker&quot; term. The term came to be applied to people or items related to Kansas.

==Relationship to the University of Kansas Jayhawk==

When the University of Kansas (KU) fielded its first football team in 1890, the team was called the Jayhawkers. Over time, the name was gradually supplanted by its shorter variant, and KU&#x27;s sports teams are now exclusively known as the Kansas Jayhawks.

Historic descriptions of the ornithological origin of the &quot;Jayhawker&quot; term have varied. Writing on the troubles in Kansas Territory in 1859, one journalist stated the jayhawk was a hawk that preys on the jay. One of the &quot;Jayhawkers of &#x27;49&quot; recalled that the name sprang from their observation of hawks gracefully sailing in the air until &quot;the audience of jays and other small but jealous and vicious birds sail in and jab him until he gets tired of show life and slides out of trouble in the lower earth.&quot; In the Pat Devlin stories, the jayhawk is described more in terms of its behavior (bullying, robbing, and killing) than the type of bird it is.

The link between the term &quot;Jayhawkers&quot; and any specific kind of bird, if such an association ever existed, had been lost or at least obscured by the time KU&#x27;s bird mascot was invented in 1912, which was meant to serve as a visual representation of the Jayhawker movement, an homage by the university to the state&#x27;s history. The originator of the bird mascot, Henry Maloy, struggled for over two years to create a pictorial symbol for the team, until hitting upon the bird idea. As explained by Maloy, &quot;the term &#x27;jayhawk&#x27; in the school yell was a verb and the term &#x27;Jayhawkers&#x27; was the noun.&quot;

In 2011, the city of Osceola, Missouri produced a declaration condemning what city leadership viewed as a connection between the Jayhawk mascot and the historical Jayhawkers who burned the town in 1861.

In 2017, the Kansas football team unveiled uniforms with an American flag on the helmet, blue jerseys, and red pants which featured the words &quot;Kansas Jay-Hawkers&quot; above a seal featuring a sword and a rifle. Kansas Athletics stated that the red pants was an homage to the term &quot;Redlegs,&quot; another name for Jayhawkers.

<text>The Blutfahne (), or Blood Flag, is or was a Nazi Party swastika flag that was carried during the attempted coup d&#x27;état Beer Hall Putsch in Munich, Germany on 9 November 1923, during which it became soaked in the blood of one of the SA men who died. It subsequently became one of the most revered objects of the Nazi Party. It was used in ceremonies in which new flags for party organisations were &quot;consecrated&quot; by the Blood Flag when touched by it.

==Beer Hall Putsch==

The flag was that of the 5th SA &quot;Sturm&quot;, which was carried in the march towards the &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot;. When the Munich police fired on the National Socialists (Nazis), the flagbearer Heinrich Trambauer was hit and dropped the flag. Andreas Bauriedl, an SA man marching alongside the flag, was killed and fell onto it, staining the flag with his blood.
There were two stories about what happened to the flag in the aftermath of the Putsch: one was that the wounded Trambauer took the flag to a friend where he removed it from its staff before leaving with it hidden inside his jacket and later giving it to a man named Karl Eggers for safekeeping. The other story was that the flag was confiscated by the Munich authorities and was later returned to the Nazis via Eggers. In the mid-1930s, after a myth emerged that Bauriedl had been carrying the flag, an investigation by Nazi archivists concluded that Trambauer was the standard-bearer and that the flag had been concealed by an SA man, not taken by the police, though they had confiscated other flags which they later returned. Regardless of which story was the correct one, after Adolf Hitler was released from Landsberg Prison (having served nine months of a five-year prison sentence for his part in the putsch), Eggers gave the flag to him.

==Sacred Nazi symbol==

After Hitler received the flag, he had it fitted to a new staff and finial; just below the finial was a silver dedication sleeve which bore the names of the 16 dead participants of the putsch. Bauriedl was one of the 16 honorees. In addition, the flag was no longer attached to the staff by its original sewn-in sleeve, but by a red-white-black intertwined cord which ran through the sleeve instead. In 1926, at the second Nazi Party congress at Weimar, Hitler ceremonially bestowed the flag on Joseph Berchtold, then head of the SS. The flag was thereafter treated as a sacred object by the Nazi Party and carried by SS–&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Jakob Grimminger at various Nazi Party ceremonies. One of the most visible uses of the flag was when Hitler, at the Party&#x27;s annual Nuremberg rallies, touched other Nazi banners with the &quot;Blutfahne&quot;, thereby &quot;sanctifying&quot; them. This was done in a special ceremony called the &quot;flag consecration&quot; (&quot;Fahnenweihe&quot;).

When not in use, the &quot;Blutfahne&quot; was kept at the headquarters of the Nazi Party, the Brown House in Munich with an SS guard of honour. The flag had a small tear in it, believed to have been caused during the Putsch, that went unrepaired for a number of years.

==Disappearance==
The &quot;Blutfahne&quot; was last seen in public at the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; induction ceremony on 18 October 1944 (&quot;not&quot;, as frequently reported, at &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Adolf Wagner&#x27;s funeral six months previously). This ceremony was conducted by Heinrich Himmler and attended by Wilhelm Keitel, Heinz Guderian, Hans Lammers, Martin Bormann, Karl Fiehler, Wilhelm Schepmann, and Erwin Kraus.

After this last public display, the &quot;Blutfahne&quot; vanished. Its current whereabouts are unknown, but it is generally assumed to have been destroyed amidst the Allied bombing of Munich in 1945.

<text>Edward Ward Carmack (November 5, 1858November 9, 1908) was an attorney, newspaperman, and political figure who served as a U.S. Senator from Tennessee from 1901 to 1907.

Following his political service, and after an unsuccessful run for Governor of Tennessee, he became editor of the one-year-old &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot;. He was fatally shot on November 9, 1908, over a feud precipitated by Duncan Brown Cooper for his editorial comments in the paper.

==Early life==
Carmack was born in Sumner County, Tennessee. He attended The Webb School, then at Culleoka, Tennessee. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1878 and began practicing in Columbia, Tennessee. He served as Columbia city attorney in 1881, and was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1884.

Carmack joined the staff of the &quot;Nashville Democrat&quot; in 1889, later becoming editor-in-chief of the &quot;Nashville American&quot; when the two papers merged. He later (1892) served as editor of the &quot;Memphis Commercial&quot;, now &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot;.

==Relationship with Ida B. Wells==
Throughout his career, Carmack was known to use his newspapers to attack rivals. During Carmack&#x27;s tenure with the &quot;Appeal&quot;, his editorials began an interesting dialogue with another famous Tennessee journalist, Ida B. Wells. Wells, known as the &quot;Mother of the Civil Rights Movement&quot;, was also not one to withhold her opinions and spoke out about the plight of African Americans in the post-Reconstruction era in the South. Memphis in the 1890s was a hotbed of racial tension, and lynching crimes were commonplace. Wells launched an anti-lynching campaign in her newspaper, &quot;Memphis Free Speech and Headlight&quot;.

The &quot;Free Speech and Headlight&quot; received national attention in 1892 for its coverage of the so-called Curve Riot in Memphis. The Curve Riot was not in fact a riot, it was an attack on the People&#x27;s Grocery Store by a group of undercover white police serving a warrant on the black-owned business. Will Barret, the store&#x27;s white competitor, had convinced a local court that the People&#x27;s Grocery was a nuisance. The court ordered the owners arrested. Fearing an attack, supporters of the People&#x27;s Grocery armed themselves to defend the store. In the ensuing melee, three deputies were wounded. Crying &quot;race riot,&quot; other armed whites joined the police and captured over thirty African Americans, including three of the store&#x27;s owners: Tom Moss, Calvin McDowell, and Will Stewart.

A mob later seized the three from the jail and lynched them. Wells wrote passionately of the atrocity and advised her readers to abandon Memphis and move to the western territories. Many followed her advice. Carmack demanded retaliation against &quot;the black wench&quot; for her denunciation of the lynchings. As a result, the offices of the &quot;Free Speech&quot; were demolished. Fortunately, Wells was out of town when the attack occurred. She did not return to the South for another thirty years.

==Political career==
Carmack was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1896, and served two terms in that body, March 4, 1897 – March 3, 1901. He was then elected to the U.S. Senate by the Tennessee General Assembly, serving one term in that body, March 4, 1901 – March 3, 1907. Carmack served on the Lodge Committee investigating war crimes in the Philippine–American War.

Carmack failed to secure reelection to a second Senate term, being succeeded by former governor of Tennessee Robert Love Taylor, and returned to the practice of law. He then contended for the 1908 Democratic nomination for governor, running against the incumbent, Malcolm Patterson. Carmack ran as a Prohibitionist, while Patterson had the support of the &quot;wet&quot; lobby. Narrowly defeated by Patterson, Carmack returned to journalism, becoming the editor of the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot;, then a prohibitionist daily.

==Death and legacy==

On November 9, 1908, Carmack attempted to shoot his publishing and political rival, Duncan Brown Cooper, attempting to act preemptively after Cooper threatened him over the content of anti-Cooper editorials Carmack had published. Carmack missed Cooper but wounded Cooper&#x27;s son Robin, who returned fire and killed Carmack.

Carmack&#x27;s remains were returned to Columbia, and he was buried in its Rose Hill Cemetery.

Perhaps in large measure because of the spectacular and violent nature of his death, Carmack was memorialized by the Tennessee state legislature. They commissioned a large bronze statue of Carmack, which was erected on the grounds of the Tennessee State Capitol building and stood there until May 2020. The bronze statue was designed by Nancy Cox-McCormack in 1924 (dedicated in 1927), and engraved with several quotes from Carmack on its surroundings and pedestal. 

Because of Carmack&#x27;s support for lynching, the statue has long caused tension in Nashville. A commission suggested replacing Carmack&#x27;s statue with one of Davy Crockett. The Carmack statue was torn down by George Floyd protesters on May 30, 2020.

For many years the public library on Hartsville Pike (Hwy 25E) in Gallatin, Tennessee, was named in his honor. When a new public library was opened in 2008 in downtown Gallatin, local authorities decided against naming it for him. There still remains a street in Columbia, Tennessee, named in his honor.

<doc id="1236777" wikidata="Q1788333" url="?curid=1236777" title="You Can't Hurry Love">
<text>&quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; is a song originally recorded by the Supremes on the Motown label. It was released on July 25, 1966 as the second single from their studio album &quot;The Supremes A&#x27; Go-Go&quot;.

Written and produced by Motown production team Holland–Dozier–Holland, the song topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, made the top five in the UK, and top 10 in Australia. It was released and peaked in late summer and early autumn in 1966. Sixteen years later, it became a number-one hit in the UK when Phil Collins re-recorded the song. It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks beginning in January 1983 and reached number 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 a month later.

&quot;Billboard&quot; named the song number 19 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time. The BBC ranked &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; at number 16 on &quot;The Top 100 Digital Motown Chart&quot;, which is based solely on all time UK downloads and streams of Motown releases.

== History ==

=== Overview ===
The song, a memory of a mother&#x27;s words of encouragement (&quot;My mama said &#x27;you can&#x27;t hurry love/No you just have to wait&#x27; &quot;) telling her daughter that with patience she will find that special someone one day, is an example of the strong influence of gospel music present in much of R&amp;B and soul music. &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; was inspired by and partially based upon &quot;(You Can&#x27;t Hurry God) He&#x27;s Right on Time&quot; (&quot;You can&#x27;t hurry God/you just have to wait/Trust and give him time/no matter how long it takes&quot;), a 1950s gospel song written by Dorothy Love Coates of the Original Gospel Harmonettes.

The recorded version of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; showcases the developing sound of the Supremes, who were progressing from their earlier teen-pop into more mature themes and musical arrangements. This song and &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; were finished together; when it came time to choose which single would be issued first, Motown&#x27;s Quality Control department chose &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love.&quot;

Written and produced by Motown&#x27;s main production team, Holland–Dozier–Holland, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; is one of the signature Supremes songs, and also one of Motown&#x27;s signature releases. &quot;Billboard&quot; described the single as &quot;the group&#x27;s most exciting side to date&quot; with &quot;top vocal&quot; and &quot;exceptional instrumental backing.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it is a &quot;pulsating pop-r&amp;b rhythmic ode which contends that romance is a slow-developing game of give-and-take.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called it &quot;a wonderful and happy sounding tune, chirped by the Supremes, with bells and banjos.&quot;

The single became the Supremes&#x27; seventh number-one hit, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart for two weeks, from September 4 to September 17, 1966, and reaching number one on the soul chart for two weeks. The group performed the song on the CBS variety program &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on Sunday, September 25, 1966.

&quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; was the second single from the Supremes&#x27; album &quot;The Supremes A&#x27; Go-Go&quot;. It reached the number one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart in the United States, and number three in the United Kingdom. The Supremes&#x27; version of the song is honored by inclusion in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s permanent collection of 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.

The Supremes also released a version sung in Italian: &quot;L&#x27;amore verrà&quot; (&quot;Love Will Come&quot;).

== Phil Collins version ==
The most notable cover of the song was released in October 1982 as a single by Phil Collins from his second solo album, &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot; Collins&#x27;s version reached number one on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in January 1983 (becoming his first number-one solo hit on the UK Singles Chart, and peaking two positions higher than the original song did in that country), and reached number 10 in the United States (his first top 10 single in the U.S.). The single was certified gold in the UK. The song spent a week at number 1 in Ireland in January 1983. The orchestral strings on this track were recorded in Studio 1 at CBS Recording Studios, London W1 by Recording Engineer Mike Ross-Trevor (assisted by Richard Hollywood) on the evening of Thursday, June 24, 1982. Collins&#x27;s cover was both virtuoso, and at the same time, the most popular Collins performance effort to date, and thus considerably his breakthrough work as a solo artist.

Collins said that &quot;The idea of doing &#x27;Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&#x27; was to see if Hugh Padgham and I could duplicate that Sixties sound. It&#x27;s very difficult today because most recording facilities are so much more sophisticated than they were back then. It&#x27;s therefore hard to make the drums sound as rough as they did on the original. That&#x27;s what we were going after, a remake, not an interpretation, but a remake.&quot;

In 1983, the music video was released on the home video &quot;Phil Collins&quot;, available on Video Home System (VHS) and LaserDisc (LD), which received a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form. The song itself was also the first track featured on the first release of the &quot;NOW That&#x27;s What I Call Music&quot; compilation series.

<doc id="1236785" wikidata="Q3218094" url="?curid=1236785" title="Larry Regan">
<text>Lawrence Emmett Regan (August 9, 1930 – March 9, 2009), was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and hockey executive. He played for the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs after a long senior-hockey career, winning the Allan Cup in 1948. He later managed and coached the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL and was president of the NHL Alumni Association.

==Playing career==
Regan moved to Ottawa as a youth. As a 16-year-old, he joined the Ottawa Jr. Senators organization in 1945–46. Regan then played for the Ottawa Senators in the Quebec Senior Hockey League. He moved to Toronto to play two seasons with the Toronto Marlboros organization, first as a junior, then at the senior level. He returned to the Senators in 1950, playing two seasons before joining the Shawinigan Cataracts. Regan then moved on to the Pembroke Lumber Kings of the Northern Ontario Hockey Association and the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Hockey League.

In 1956-57, Larry finally got his chance in the National Hockey League with the Boston Bruins as a 27-year-old. He scored 14 goals that season, which would be his career high, and he won the Calder Memorial Trophy, the oldest player to win it at that time (Sergei Makarov won it when he was 31 years old in 1988-89 with the Calgary Flames). He played two and a half seasons with the Bruins before being claimed on waivers, for $15,000 on January 7, 1959, by the Toronto Maple Leafs. He played two further seasons with the Leafs before being demoted to the Pittsburgh Hornets in the American Hockey League. In 1962, he moved to Innsbruck, Austria, coaching the Innsbrucker EV for two seasons before returning to the AHL with the Baltimore Clippers in 1965-66 for one final season.

==Hockey executive career==
While still playing, Regan became a playing-coach in 1961–62 with the Pittsburgh Hornets for part of the season. He was named to coach the Etobicoke Indians of the Ontario Hockey Association in 1966, but left the position to join Jack Kent Cooke, owner of the expansion Los Angeles Kings, as head scout, and later Regan was promoted to general manager. Regan was also the head coach for the 1970-71 and part of the 1971-72 seasons and he remained in the job until 1973.
&quot;I knew Jack from the years I played in Toronto. We became pretty good friends along the way and stayed in touch. When I heard about the NHL expanding, I put my oar in the water with Jack before anybody else and I was fortunate enough to be chosen.&quot;
As coach, Regan was once fined US$1,000 by NHL president Clarence Campbell for punching referee Bruce Hood in the face following a game in Oakland, California, California in 1968. He was upset after a late penalty cost the Kings a victory against the California Seals. Regan was quoted as saying &quot;Someone had to do something with officiating like that.&quot; More than 10,000 attended the next Kings&#x27; game.

After his time with the Los Angeles Kings, he moved to Montreal where he coached the Montreal Juniors in the 1974–75 season, quitting after the one season.

== NHL Alumni Association and Alan Eagleson inquiry ==
After leaving the Montreal Juniors, Regan became involved in the National Hockey League Alumni Association (NHLAA), an association of retired NHL ice hockey players, eventually becoming the head of the organization. In the 1980s, former NHL stars such as Gordie Howe and Bobby Orr noticed that they were not being paid to the full amount that they should have been paid for their pensions. An investigation by a Boston-area reporter named Russ Conway led to Alan Eagleson being indicted and convicted on fraud and was sentenced to prison. Regan was head of the NHLAA at the time and he participated in the investigation, contacting any player involved with Eagleson.

== Post NHL life ==
Regan retired soon after the Eagleson inquiry and he lived in Ottawa, Ontario with his wife Pauline until his death in 2009. He had Parkinson&#x27;s disease prior to his death.

==Awards and achievements==
*Calder Memorial Trophy winner in 1957.

<text>WBLK (93.7 FM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Depew that serves Western New York, the Buffalo metropolitan area and the Niagara Region of Ontario. WBLK is owned by Townsquare Media and has an urban contemporary radio format, featuring hip hop, R&amp;B and soul. The station carries the syndicated &quot;Steve Harvey Morning Show&quot;.

WBLK can be classified as a &quot;heritage&quot; station, holding the same format and call letters since its debut. It is the oldest urban FM radio station in the U.S. The station also regularly ranks in the top 5 radio stations in Buffalo&#x27;s Nielsen ratings. It has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 47,000 watts. The transmitter is atop the Rand Building in Downtown Buffalo and the studios are on a lower floor of the building.

==History==
===Early years===
The station signed on the air on . It has always been primarily aimed at Western New York&#x27;s African American population. WBLK was founded by legendary Buffalo disc jockey George &quot;Hound Dog&quot; Lorenz, who had earlier championed Rhythm and Blues music on local AM stations. Lorenz&#x27;s voice was heard on WBLK from its inception until his death in 1972. Some on air personalities include Ernie &quot;Mr. Blues&quot; Jones, Roosevelt Tucker, Bradley J. Cool, Chuckie T., James Burns, Mansfield Manns, Jerry Young, Gary Lanier, Ron Baskin, Don Allen Sr. and his son Don Allen Jr., David Stafford, Lee Pettigrew, Don Robinson, Freddie Patrick, Rodney &quot;Rockin&quot; Lee, with Doug Blakely, Jason Denis, and Debbie Sims.

WBLK went from a mono signal to FM stereo in 1974. With a playlist called the &quot;Funky Forty&quot;, at 3 p.m. on a July Monday, DJ Don Robinson flipped the switch and the stereo light flickered on. The first song heard in stereo was &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; by Marvin Gaye. WBLK went through several rebrandings over the years, including &quot;Rockin&#x27; BLK&quot;, &quot;FM Stereo 94&quot;, &quot;Soul Brother Radio&quot;, &quot;Soul Sister Radio&quot;, &quot;Soul Brother And Sister Radio&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Soul BLK&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Soul &#x27;N&#x27; Stereo&quot;, &quot;Soul &#x27;N&#x27; Stereo&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Soul 94 FM&quot;, &quot;WBLK Rockin&#x27; Soul&quot;, &quot;K94 FM&quot;, &quot;The BLK Style&quot;, &quot;Power 94&quot;, and simply &quot;93.7 WBLK&quot;. In July 2017, it incorporated its digital dial position, calling itself &quot;Power 93.7 WBLK&quot;.

Contrary to popular belief, WBLK&#x27;s call sign was not chosen to represent the words We&#x27;re BLacK. It is a tribute to Benjamin L. Kulick, who was a major financial backer of the station when it first went on the air.

===Ownership changes===
In August 1995, D&amp;R Radio, WBLK&#x27;s original owners and founders, sold the station to Boston-based American Radio Systems. In September 1997, Infinity Broadcasting purchased WBLK and all of ARS&#x27; stations for $2.6 billion. Infinity was merged into CBS Radio in December 2005. WBLK began streaming its programming on the Internet on November 13, 2006, and was sold by CBS Radio to Regent Communications (now Townsquare Media) in December 2006.

For all of its existence, WBLK&#x27;s playlist has been very diverse, as the station follows a full-service musical approach and incorporates many genres of urban music. This was partially due to the lack of direct competitors in the market. In 2017, long-time daytime-only station WUFO (1080 AM) launched a 24-hour FM translator, tweaked its format to Urban AC/classic hip hop, and rebranded as &quot;Power 96.5&quot;. This gave WBLK an FM competitor for the first time. Another station appealing to a similar audience is WWWS (1400 AM), which airs an Urban Oldies format and added an FM translator as well (the station is now branded as &quot;Classic R&amp;B 1400 &amp; 107.3”). Since the early 2000s, WBLK has &quot;day-parted&quot; its playlist. As of 2021, current Urban AC content can be heard from 2 a.m. (including the Steve Harvey Morning Show) through late afternoon. Current hip hop programming is heard in the late afternoon and evening hours, followed by &quot;The Quiet Storm&quot; (Monday-Thursdays) with a softer urban playlist after 11 p.m..

===Audience in Southern Ontario===
From its founding until the early 2000s, WBLK had a significant listenership among fans of urban music in Toronto, which did not have an urban-formatted radio station. Some commercials heard on WBLK during this time were geared towards listeners in Southern Ontario. The Southern Ontario audience&#x27;s reliance on an American station with no Canadian content requirements significantly impacted the commercial development of Canadian hip hop and R&amp;B.

In 1997, the station even began broadcasting live remote Fridays from the Industry nightclub in Toronto. Promoted as &#x27;Wreckshop Radio&#x27;, the club night featuring R&amp;B and hip-hop was heard on WBLK for several years.

With the February 2001 launch of Toronto-based rhythmic contemporary station CFXJ-FM on the adjacent 93.5 MHz frequency, WBLK became a bit harder to find on some radio receivers with weaker tuners, and thus lost much of its prominence in the Toronto market.

=== In popular culture ===
A clip of WBLK&#x27;s &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; block was highlighted in the song &quot;After Dark&quot; on Drake&#x27;s album &quot;Scorpion&quot;, released in 2018. Drake was born and grew up in Toronto and was likely a WBLK listener in his early years.

<text>Brook Mays Music Company, known generally as Brook Mays, is a Dallas, Texas-based retailer of musical instruments, sheet music, and supplies for individuals, bands and orchestras.

==History==
Brook Mays was founded by its namesake investor, Brook Mays, who saw the opportunity to open a piano dealership in Dallas, and opened the chain&#x27;s original store in August 1901. At the time, it dealt exclusively in pianos, and became the largest such dealership in its region. Brook Mays was the only major music company in the area to survive the Great Depression.

In the 1940s, the company expanded its wares to include organs, sheet music, and band instruments. Extensive remodeling following World War II until the early 1950s led to expansion in the downtown Dallas store, which fostered the development of its band instrument division. It became the largest supplier of band instruments to school groups in the southern United States. Brook Mays often had partnerships with school districts, and offered them bulk discounts.

The company grew rapidly with renewed interest in electrical instruments, and had over 50 stores, plus a mail-order and e-commerce division to serve international customers. Each store had access to extensive instrument repair facilities, as well as the largest instrument rental service in the southwest United States.

Brook Mays&#x27; slogan is &quot;Brook Mays means music&quot;.

In 2003 First Act Inc., a competitor that sells its instruments at mass market retailers sued Brook Mays and was awarded $16.7 million. According to First Act, Brook Mays discouraged patrons from buying First Act&#x27;s very inexpensive instruments. This claim was based on a flyer that Brook Mays sent out to band directors and consumers. In 2006, a judge awarded First Act the full amount of their claim. In July 2006, Brook Mays Music Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing poor back-to-school and holiday sales.

In August 2006, after 105 years of business, the liquidation of Brook Mays was ordered. Private investment company Oak Point Partners acquired the remnant assets, consisting of any known and unknown assets that weren&#x27;t previously administered, from the Brook Mays Music Company Bankruptcy Estate on December 1, 2010.

Effective December 1, 2006, a new entity began operating at least one of the old Brook Mays music stores, using the name Brook Mays. The entity now operates five retail stores (two in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex plus the company office and showroom, and three in the Greater Houston area). The store continues to rent band instruments to schools.

<doc id="1236817" wikidata="Q833981" url="?curid=1236817" title="Cavalli Islands">
<text>The Cavalli Islands are a small group of islands near Whangaroa on Northland&#x27;s East Coast in northern New Zealand. They lie to the east of Matauri Bay on the mainland.

The group consists of the island of Motukawanui (area ) and the smaller islets of Motutapere, Panaki, Nukutaunga, Haraweka, Motuharakeke, and Motukawaiti Islands. The main island is used as a nature reserve, and some of the smaller islands are privately owned.

The Cavallis were so named by Captain James Cook on 27 December 1769 during his first voyage of discovery. In his journal he recorded that some Māori &quot;sold us some fish--Cavallys as they are called--which occasioned my giving the Islands the same name&quot;. Cook probably meant trevally which is abundant near the islands, known to the Māori as araara.

On 2 December 1987, the hull of the bombed Greenpeace vessel &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; was scuttled between Matauri Bay and the Cavalli Islands, to serve as a dive wreck and fish sanctuary.

<doc id="1236821" wikidata="Q162969" url="?curid=1236821" title="John Sparks (Nevada politician)">
<text>John Sparks (August 30, 1843 – May 22, 1908), nicknamed Honest John, was an American politician who was the 10th Governor of Nevada. Like his predecessor, Reinhold Sadler, Sparks was a cattleman and his rise to political power was evidence of the decline of the mining industry and the rise of the ranching industry in Nevada. He was a member of the Silver – Democratic Party. In 1958, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sparks was born on August 30, 1843, in Winston County, Mississippi. His family was one of those known as &quot;new lands families&quot;, who specialized in developing land on the frontier and then selling out and moving on as settlement in the area increased. His family followed the frontier through Arkansas, moving on to Texas in 1857 by which point they were moderately wealthy. In Texas, they began ranching cattle, and John became a proficient cowboy.

===Cattleman career===
In 1861, Sparks joined the Texas Rangers, probably to avoid being drafted into the Confederate Army. His unit was tasked with protecting settlers from the Comanche, and he did not fight in the Civil War. After the war, Sparks drove cattle in the huge Longhorn drives of the era, at first working for John Meyers, and later in partnership with his brothers. In 1872, Sparks married Rachel Knight and they had two daughters, Maude and Rachel.

In 1873, Sparks bought a large herd of cattle in Texas then drove them to Wyoming and established a ranch in the Chugwater River valley near Cheyenne. He sold that ranch and its 2,100 head of cattle the next year to the Swan Brothers. After that, Sparks established a series of ranches along the North Platte River, each of which he quickly sold and invested the money in the next ranch. Sparks also invested in a bank in Georgetown, Texas (his wife&#x27;s hometown), where he also built a mansion. In 1879 his wife died, and in 1880 Sparks married her half-sister Nancy Elnora &quot;Nora&quot; Knight, they had three sons, Benton, Charles and Leland.

By that time there was no unclaimed rangeland left east of the Rockies, and Sparks cast his eye further west. Joining with fellow Texan John Tinnin, Sparks bought the H-D Ranch in the Thousand Springs Valley north of Elko, Nevada, in 1881. In 1883 Sparks-Tinnin purchased all of Jasper Harrell&#x27;s ranches for $900,000. At that time, the Harrell ranches consisted of approximately 30,000 head of cattle ranging over a vast area of Nevada and Idaho. Very little of that land was owned outright. Sparks-Tinnin would obtain small portions of land surrounding a water source, and then deny other operations use of that water. This allowed it to control vast areas of public land that it did not own. Sparks-Tinnin would have an employee file for a homestead on the land that it wished to own, and then sell that land back to the company, as an individual could only file for one homestead in a lifetime. At its peak, Sparks-Tinnin was said to control 6% of the land in Nevada.

In 1885, Sparks moved to his 1,640 acre (6.64 km2) Alamo Ranch, located in the Steamboat Springs area just south of Reno, Nevada. There he built a &quot;hobby&quot; herd of pure-blood Hereford cattle. Sparks became famous at western livestock auctions by paying ridiculous sums for pedigreed Hereford cattle. By purchasing stock from other breeders rather than breeding his own, Sparks&#x27; herd was soon unbeatable at livestock shows. Sparks&#x27; sale of lesser cattle from his herd helped establish the Hereford as the dominant breed in Nevada. Sparks also raised &quot;exotic&quot; animals such as bison and deer at the Alamo Ranch.

The Sparks-Tinnin operation continued to grow throughout the 1880s until it, like all other western cattle operations, suffered a severe setback in the harsh winter of 1889–1890. During that winter the temperature reached −42 degrees Fahrenheit (−41 degrees Celsius) in Elko, and the range was covered in deep snow from January through March. At that time most large cattle operations in Nevada kept their cattle on the open range year round, with no supplemental feed in the winter. Losses of cattle on the range were catastrophic. In the spring of 1890, it was reported that one could walk for a hundred miles along the Humboldt River on cow carcasses, and floating carcasses jammed against bridges in Elko, causing flooding. Sparks later stated that of his herd of about 45,000 head, only 15,000 survived. He also claimed that of the survivors, 90% had the &quot;white faces characteristic of Herefords&quot;. These were probably the descendants of Longhorn brood cows and Hereford bulls. As range cattle operations of the day typically ran one bull per twenty brood cows it was far cheaper to improve an existing herd by replacing the bulls than by creating a whole new herd. The survival rate of these Hereford/Longhorn crosses was ascribed to the superior qualities of the Hereford, however hybrid vigor may have played a role.

Following the winter of 1889–1890, Tinnin could no longer make his mortgage payments to Jasper Harrell, and Harrell took over his shares. Sparks-Tinnin was renamed Sparks-Harrell. Between his expenditures on the Alamo Ranch and losses in mining speculation, Sparks also ran into financial trouble and sold his half of Sparks-Harrell back to Jasper Harrell in 1901.

===Political career===
After an unsuccessful Senate run, Sparks was elected Governor of Nevada in 1902 and re-elected in 1906. During this administration a state railroad commission was formed; the Nevada State Police was organized; an eight-hour work day bill for miners was passed; and a state engineering office was created.

In 1904, the town of Harriman, Nevada in Washoe County was renamed Sparks after the governor.

Sparks died while still in his second term in office on May 22, 1908. At the time of his death, he was reportedly broke, and the Alamo Ranch was immediately sold to settle his debts.

===Memorium===
The Alamo Ranchhouse, a portion of Sparks&#x27; Alamo Ranch, survives and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

<text>People Are People is a compilation album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode, released in North America by Sire Records on 2 July 1984. Sire sensed it needed a new approach in its release policy since the band&#x27;s 1983 effort &quot;Construction Time Again&quot; had failed to chart in the US.

Aside from the latest single &quot;People Are People&quot;, it was also the first US release of the 7&quot; versions of &quot;Leave in Silence&quot; and &quot;See You&quot; b-side &quot;Now, This Is Fun&quot;. The album version of &quot;Love, in Itself&quot; was selected for this compilation, but with a &quot;clean&quot; ending, since on &quot;Construction Time Again&quot; the track fades into &quot;More Than a Party&quot;.

The album was released in July 1984 to relatively little notice. It re-entered the charts and sold better, when the title track became a summer hit in 1985. The album later was certified Gold by the RIAA for shipments of half a million copies.

The album, with photography by Brian Griffin, was originally released on LP and CD with the band name and album name missing from the album cover. These names were then added to the covers for later re-releases.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic were mixed in their reception to the album, rating the album two-and-a-half stars out of five.

<doc id="1236844" wikidata="Q708369" url="?curid=1236844" title="Early voting">
<text>Early voting, also called advance polling or pre-poll voting, is a convenience voting process by which voters in a public election can vote before a scheduled election day. Early voting can take place remotely, such as via postal voting, or in person, usually in designated early voting polling stations. The availability and time periods for early voting vary among jurisdictions and types of election. The goals of early voting are usually to increase voter participation, relieve congestion at polling stations on election day, and avoid possible discrimination against people with work and travel schedules that may effectively prohibit them from getting to the polls during the hours provided in a single election day.

In some countries, early in-person voting or postal voting (or both) are available to all voters. In other countries, only some voters (such as those who are expected to be out of the country or hospitalized on election day) are eligible to cast ballots via these methods.

In addition to convenience and increased participation, early voting has proven advantageous for the smooth functioning of elections. When most voters cast their ballot on a single day, any problem can have a more damaging effect. More options to vote before Election Day provides more opportunities to identify and counteract problems including machine breakdown, cyberattack, human errors, or disinformation. When voting is spread out over several days, election officials can detect issues earlier, mitigate challenges more easily, counter false claims, and offer a greater number of options to any voters who may be impacted.

== Australia and New Zealand==
===Australia===
In Australia, where voting is compulsory, early voting is usually known as &quot;pre-poll voting&quot;. Voters are able to cast a pre-poll vote for a number of reasons, including being away from the electorate, travelling, impending maternity, being unable to leave one&#x27;s workplace, having religious beliefs that prevent attendance at a polling place, or being more than 8 km from a polling place. There were over 600 early voting centres available in 2016.

At the 2019 Australian federal election, 6.1 million votes were cast early (including postal votes), equating to 40.7 percent of total votes cast. This represented an increase from 26.4 percent at the 2013 election and 13.7 percent at the 2007 election. Following the 2019 elections, members of the parliamentary standing committee on electoral matters expressed concern about the length of the pre-poll voting period, suggesting that it was imposing costs on both the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and political parties, and that electors voting too early may be unable to respond to developments in the final weeks of the election campaign.

Hospitals and remote areas are served by Travelling Voting Booths.

===New Zealand ===
Early voting, or advance voting, has been possible in New Zealand without a reason since 2008. Advance voting opens 12 days before the election day, with around 500 polling booths set up across the country. Voters attending an appropriate advance polling booth for their electorate (constituency) can cast an ordinary vote in the same way they would if voting on election day. If the voter is outside the electorate, enrolled after the cutoff date (31 days before election day), or is on the unpublished roll, they must cast a special vote.

In the 2011 election, 334,600 advance votes were cast, representing 14.7% of all votes cast. This grew to 48% in the 2017 election and to 66.7% in the 2020 election

==Europe==
A 2020 report by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) surveyed the use of voting arrangements in Europe, reporting on the prevalence of in-country postal voting, early voting, mobile voting, and proxy voting in various European countries.

The IDEA report defined &quot;early voting&quot;, for purposes of the IDEA dataset was defined as &quot;in-person opportunities for submitting one&#x27;s vote at a polling station before election day&quot;, excluding &quot;other early methods that are not in-person (such as postal or e-voting) or that do not take place in a polling station (such as mobile voting)&quot;. Applying this definition, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia offer early voting to all voters. Iceland, Portugal, Slovenia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Russia offer early voting to some voters.

The IDEA report defined &quot;in-country postal voting&quot;, for purposes of its dataset, as &quot;those measures that allow a voter to submit their ballot by physical post to the election administration&quot; and noted that &quot;While postal voting is in principle early voting, it differs in that the vote can be physically submitted remotely by the voter themselves.&quot; Iceland, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg offer in-country postal voting to all voters. The Republic of Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria, Slovenia, and Lithuania offer in-country postal voting to some voters.

===Finland ===
In Finland, eligible voters may cast ballots either on election day or by advance voting. Advancing voting begins on a Wednesday, eleven days before election day. The advance-voting period ends eight days before election day (for votes cast abroad at designated Finnish embassies) and five days before election day (for votes cast within Finland). Any qualified voter may cast a ballot at a &quot;general advance polling station&quot; (a Finland municipal office or certain post offices and Finnish embassies abroad). &quot;Special advance polling stations&quot; are set up at hospitals for patients and prisons for detainees. Additionally, Finnish voters who are unable to travel to advance polling stations due to mobility impairments or illness may cast advance ballots at home (election commissioners make house calls to receive votes from such person). Crews of traveling Finnish ships may also cast ballots via advance voting, beginning 18 days before election day.

===Germany===

Germany does not have in-person early voting, but allows all eligible voters to vote by mail. Voting by mail was adopted in West Germany beginning in 1957, but was originally a method mostly used for those with a particular reason preventing them from casting an in-person ballot. The proportion of German voters casting postal ballots has steadily increased since the 1990 reunification of Germany, and the excuse requirement was eliminated in 2008. In the 2005 German federal election, 19% of all voters voted early. In the 2017 German federal election, a then-record 28.6% of voters cast ballots by mail. In the 2021 German federal election, 47.3% of voters cast ballots by mail, setting a new record.

===Ireland ===

In the Republic of Ireland, it is traditional for voters on the remote coastal islands to vote on the day prior to the official date of the election. This aims to avoid the possibility that bad weather might impede the delivery of ballot boxes to the count center on the mainland. However, the practice is not universally popular.

===Norway ===
In Norway early voting is known as &quot;forhåndsstemming&quot;. By law, election day is set to a Monday in September in the year of the end of the current term. Early voting is usually opened 1 month before election day, and closes the Friday before. Up to and including the Friday, everyone can vote anywhere in the country. On election day, voting has to occur within the municipality the voter is a resident of by the end of June.

At the general election of 2009, 707,489 Norwegians voted in advance, 200 000 more than the previous record, in 2001.

The share that do early voting has steadily increased and in the national elections in 2021, 57.9% of votes cast were early votes. With 1.7 million early voters.

===Sweden ===

Sweden has traditionally had a high participation in elections and tries to make it as easy as possible to vote. No voter registration is needed, since everyone is generally registered with a home address, nor is there any requirement to tell the authorities that you intend to vote early. Normally, a voter is expected to vote on the election day at the specified voting station, but everyone can vote during the last week at any early voting station in the country, nowadays usually in municipality-owned places like libraries or schools. Although mainly intended for early voting, one early voting station in each municipality must also be open on the election day (always a Sunday in Sweden), to enable distance voting on that day as well. In hospitals and homes for the elderly, there are special voting opportunities. Swedes living abroad must register their address and can vote at embassies or through mail.

Early voting has been possible in Sweden since 1942, and the post offices were used for this until the 1994 Swedish general election. But that year the Swedish postal service was changed from being a government agency to a state-owned limited company that wasn&#x27;t directly government controlled, so the responsibility for providing early voting fell on the local municipalities, who have always been responsible for the regular voting stations.

The early votes are sent to the voter&#x27;s regular local voting station in double envelopes, with the voter&#x27;s name and personal identity number on the outer envelope. After the local voting station has closed on election day, officials first check if any of the voters in the stack of early voter envelopes are in the list of voters who have voted at the voting station that day. If that is the case, the early vote is destroyed, with the inner envelope unopened. Otherwise, the inner envelopes are added to a ballot box for counting. Early votes that do not reach the voting station in time are shipped to the County Administrative Board and counted if the voter has not already voted.

===Switzerland ===

Swiss federal law allows postal voting in all federal elections and referendums, and all cantons allow it for cantonal ballot issues. All voters receive their personal ballot by mail a few weeks before the election or referendum. They may cast it at a polling station on election day or mail it back at any prior time.

==Asia and elsewhere==

===Russia ===
In Russia, early voting, according to the decision of the election commission, can be organized in special poll stations formed in remote and hard-to-reach areas, on ships that will be sailing on election day and at polar stations. At the same time, early voting can be held no earlier than twenty days before the election day.

In 2020, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, a law was passed allowing early voting at all polling stations. For the first time, this system was used in the referendum on amendments to the constitution, which was held on 1 July 2020, but citizens had the opportunity to vote within a week before the main day. This was done for sanitary purposes, to reduce the number of people present at the same time at the polling stations. Later, the period of early voting was reduced to two days before the election day. Such a three-day voting was used for regional elections in September 2020. However, such a decision is not mandatory and can be made by the election commission within ten days after the election is scheduled. If the election Commission has not made such a decision, voting takes place only within one day.

===Thailand ===
In Thailand, early voting is known as &quot;เลือกตั้งล่วงหน้า&quot; (/lɯ̂ːak tâŋ lûːaŋ nâː/ advance voting). The Election Commission administers advancing voting. Early voting in the 2011 Thai general election was arranged on a Sunday (June 26, 2011) while prior elections were arranged on both Saturday and Sunday. Around 2.6 million people, including 1.07 million in Bangkok turned up to vote, however, many potential voters were unable to vote because of large crowds.

==North America==
===Canada===

In Canada, elections are administered by Elections Canada. Early in-person voting is called advance polls, which are held on the 10th, 9th, 8th and 7th days before election day at designated advance-poll stations. Canadian voters may locate the date, hours, and address of their advance-poll station at the Elections Canada website, on their voter information card, or by telephoning Elections Canada. About 4.9 million Canadians cast advance votes in the 2019 election, and almost 5.8 million Canadians cast ballots during the four advance-poll dates of the 2021 election, setting a record.

Canadians may also vote, upon application, at Elections Canada local offices (established during election seasons in every riding in Canada), or by mail. Ballots cast via these methods are termed &quot;special ballots.&quot; Historically, voting by mail has been fairly rare in Canada; of the 18.4 million total votes in the 2019 Canadian election, slightly under 50,000 voters cast ballots by mail, with most of these ballots coming from Canadians living abroad. Voting by mail in Canada increased during the 2021 election, with more than 1.1 million special ballots received (including from Canadian Forces servicemembers, Canadians living abroad, Canadians away from home on election day, and incarcerated Canadians); of this total, about 99,988 special ballots were not counted because they arrived after the receipt deadline (6 p.m. on election day), did not have a voter signature, or had some other problem.

===United States ===



The period since 2000 has seen a significant expansion in the number of U.S. states offering options to vote before Election Day, the percentage of the total population with those options, and the portion choosing to exercise those options. In the 2000 general election, 40% of all voting-age citizens lived in states with at least one early-voting option. A July 2024 study by the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research found that nearly 97% of all voting-age citizens will live in states offering at least one option to vote before the 2024 election.

In the 2000 election, 14% of ballots were cast before Election Day. For 16 years the percentage increased steadily—21% in 2004, 31% in 2008, 33% in 2012, and 40% in 2016—before jumping to 69% in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, then returning to the long-term trend with 50% in the 2022 midterm elections.

As of 2024, 47 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands offer in-person voting before Election Day. Of the 47 states that allow early in-person voting, eight have all-mail voting. In these states, each eligible, registered voter is sent a ballot, which can either be returned by mail, or dropped off at designated site during the early voting period.

The duration, start date, and end date of the early in-person voting period varies from state to state, from a low of five days to a high of 50 days; the average number of days of early in-person voting is 23. Some states give discretion to local election officials (sometimes county clerks) to add certain days of early voting.

Of states that permit early in-person voting (excluding the eight states that have &quot;all-mail&quot; elections), 23 states and D.C. allow some weekend early voting (on Saturdays, Sundays, or both). 
The National Conference of State Legislatures provides up-to-date information on each state&#x27;s laws with links to relevant election statutes.

As of 2024, only three states do not currently offer in-person early voting: Alabama, Mississippi, and New Hampshire.

In addition to (or in lieu of) in-person early voting, all states offer absentee ballots (also called mail-in ballots) to some or all voters, with significant differences among states. As of 2024, 36 states and D.C. offer either &quot;no-excuse absentee voting&quot; (in which any qualified voter may cast an absentee ballot without an excuse) or conduct all elections by mail; in the remaining states, an absentee ballot will only be provided to a voter with a valid excuse. Absentee ballots are often returned to election offices by mail (see postal voting in the United States) but some states offer &quot;in-person absentee voting&quot; (in which the voter requests, completes, signs, and submits the absentee ballot at a polling place). The voting experience for in-person absentee balloting is similar to the early-voting experience.

States adopted early voting at different times. For example, Florida officially began early voting in 2004, and voters in Maryland approved a constitutional amendment in November 2008 to allow early voting, starting with the primary elections in 2010. Early voting was first used in Massachusetts for the general election of November 2016. New York began early voting in 2019, as a result of a state law requiring eight days of early voting throughout the state.

In 2022, Connecticut was one of just four remaining states without early in-person voting. In November 2022, Connecticut voters approved a constitutional amendment authorizing the state legislature to enact early in-person voting. In May 2023, the Connecticut House and Senate passed H.B. 5004, which was signed into law by Governor Ned Lamont on June 7, 2023.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States led many states both to reduce the number of polling stations for the 2020 United States elections and to relax requirements for both mail-in and early voting, including mailing applications to all active registered voters and providing drop-boxes for ballots. In the November 2020 elections, about 26% of votes nationwide were cast by early in-person voting, as compared to 46% of votes cast by mail/absentee ballot and 28% of votes cast in Election Day in-person voting.

After the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, following false claims of widespread voter fraud in the election by Donald Trump, Republican lawmakers initiated a push to restrict early voting (see Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election).

In 2020, MTV founded the campaign for &quot;Vote Early Day&quot; as a civic holiday to celebrate the concept of early voting, directed primarily at young people. The MTV program partnered with businesses and nonprofits, and its advantage being that it isn’t ‘owned’ by any one entity.

<doc id="1236847" wikidata="Q2390385" url="?curid=1236847" title="Johannes Lupi">
<text>Jean Leleu, most commonly known by the latinized version of his name, Johannes Lupi (c. 1506 – December 20, 1539), was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance. A representative of the generation after Josquin, he was a minor but skilled composer of polyphony who was mainly active in Cambrai.

== Life ==
His birthplace is unknown, but he served in Cambrai as a choirboy. He lived in Cambrai most of his life, only leaving to attend the university in Leuven, where he was present from 1522 until 1526. In 1527 he became master of the choirboys at the Cambrai Cathedral, a position which typically included housing and boarding them in addition to teaching them music. Several times he was fired from his job, but always re-hired again, usually for failing to discipline his charges but also for poor bookkeeping.

Lupi had an unnamed chronic illness which plagued him increasingly in the 1530s—he had to leave his position because of it in 1535—and which caused his early death.

== Style and influence ==
All of his surviving music is &quot;a cappella&quot; vocal. Only two masses survive, but he wrote numerous motets and chansons; the motets were collected and printed in 1542 by Pierre Attaingnant. One noteworthy work is his setting of &quot;Ergone conticuit&quot;, the lament on the death of Johannes Ockeghem written by Erasmus.

Stylistically his music was related to that of Nicolas Gombert, and showed the typical tendencies of the generation after Josquin with its densely textured polyphony and rich imitation, but Lupi remained extraordinarily sensitive to text-setting, being able to present clearly understandable words even in eight-part counterpoint. His chansons are particularly notable for their wide range of subject matter, from the serious to the bawdy.

Lupi is sometimes confused with several other musicians of the 16th century. Johannes Lupi was the name of two other obscure figures, neither of whom was a composer. One was active at Nivelles, the other at Antwerp, both in the first half of the century. In addition, there was a composer named Lupus, often referred to by contemporary musicologists as the &quot;Italian Lupus&quot;, whose works survive in the Medici Codex; another composer named Lupus Hellinck, who may be the same as the &quot;Italian Lupus&quot;; and an entire family of musicians named Lupo. Of this family, only Ambrose Lupo, of Milan, was active in the early 16th century. Yet another Lupi, Didier Lupi Second, worked in Lyons around the middle of the century.

<text>&quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; is a song written and composed by Holland–Dozier–Holland. It was first recorded in 1966 by American Motown group the Supremes, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 

The song has since been interpreted by many performers. American rock band Vanilla Fudge released a cover version in June the following year, which reached number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Wilson Pickett recorded it in 1969. English singer Kim Wilde covered &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; in 1986, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June 1987. In 1996, a version recorded by American country singer Reba McEntire reached number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart.

In the first 32 years of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 rock era, &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; became one of the six songs to reach number one by two different musical acts, for the Supremes and Wilde versions. The BBC ranked the Supremes&#x27; original song at number 78 on &quot;The Top 100 Digital Motown Chart&quot;, which ranks Motown releases by their all-time UK downloads and streams.

==The Supremes original version==
===Background===
&quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; was originally recorded in 1966 by the Supremes for the Motown label. The single is rooted in proto-funk and rhythm and blues, compared to the Supremes&#x27; previous single, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot;, which uses the call and response elements akin to gospel. The song&#x27;s signature guitar part is said to have originated from a Morse code-like radio sound effect, typically used before a news announcement, heard by Lamont Dozier. Dozier collaborated with Brian and Eddie Holland to integrate the idea into a single.

Many elements of the recording, including the guitars, the drums, and Diana Ross&#x27;s vocals were multitracked, a production technique which was established and popularized concurrently by Holland–Dozier–Holland (H–D–H) and other premier producers of the 1960s such as Phil Spector (see &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;) and George Martin. H–D–H recorded the song in eight sessions with the Supremes and session band the Funk Brothers before settling on a version deemed suitable for the final release.

===Reception===
&quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; was the first single taken from the Supremes&#x27; 1967 album &quot;The Supremes Sing Holland–Dozier–Holland&quot;. The song became the group&#x27;s eighth number-one single when it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles chart for two weeks in the United States from November 19 to 26, 1966. It peaked at number eight in the UK Singles Chart. The Supremes original version was ranked number 339 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was voted number 43 on Detroit&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs, a &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; poll in 2016. &quot;Billboard&quot; described the song as a &quot;pulsating rocker with the trio in top form&quot; with an &quot;interesting, driving guitar figure throughout.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it is &quot;another in [the Supremes&#x27;] long-line of strong &#x27;Detroit&#x27; offerings&quot; that &quot;is bound to follow in footsteps of the group’s previous winners.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; described it as &quot;a driving nifty with distinctive sound.&quot;

The track is one of the most often covered songs in the Supremes canon. The group performed the song on the ABC variety program &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; on October 29, 1966.

In 1999, the 1966 original recording by the Supremes was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Vanilla Fudge version==
===Background===
Vanilla Fudge&#x27;s 1967 psychedelic rock remake titled &quot;You Keep Me Hanging On&quot; reached number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart a year after the release of the Supremes&#x27; recording. While the edited version released on the 45 RPM single was under three minutes long, the album version was 7:26 and features a markedly slower and more aggressive interpretation of the song. The recording, done in one take, was Vanilla Fudge&#x27;s first single.

Vanilla Fudge drummer Carmine Appice talked about the band&#x27;s decision to record the song in a 2014 interview:

The Vanilla Fudge version appears in the series finale of the television show &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (2007), at the conclusion of episode 1 of season 7 of the television series &quot;Mad Men&quot; (2015), the film &quot;War Dogs&quot; (2016), the video game &quot;Mafia III&quot; (2016), the film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (2019) and its soundtrack, and over the closing credits of the &quot;Intervention&quot; (2022) episode of &quot;That Damn Michael Che&quot;. It Also appears in the snowboarding film by Burton &quot;One World&quot; (2020).

==Kim Wilde version==
===Background===
&quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; was covered by English singer Kim Wilde in 1986. Wilde&#x27;s version was a total re-working of the original, completely transforming the Supremes&#x27; Motown Sound into a hi-NRG song.

===Reception===
It was released as the second single from Wilde&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Another Step&quot; (although &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; was the LP&#x27;s first worldwide single, as the first single had been released only in selected countries). The song reached number two in Wilde&#x27;s native United Kingdom, and number one in Australia. It also became Wilde&#x27;s second and last top-40 entry in the United States following &quot;Kids in America&quot; (1981), as well as her most successful song in that country to date, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for one week in June 1987. It later ranked as the 34th best-selling song of 1987 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 year-end chart that year. &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for UK sales in excess of 250,000 copies.

In 2006, Wilde performed a new version of the song with German singer Nena for her &quot;Never Say Never&quot; album.

===Music video===
Wilde filmed a music video to promote the song. Directed by Greg Masuak, the video shows Wilde in a dark room lying on a large bed. She then rises from the bed as she sings the song and finds herself being &quot;threatened&quot; by a strange man who is breaking down the walls around her.

==Reba McEntire version==
American country singer Reba McEntire covered &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; in 1995 for her twenty-second studio album, &quot;Starting Over&quot; (1996). Released as the album&#x27;s fourth single in 1996 on MCA Nashville Records, it was co-produced by Tony Brown and Michael Omartian. Although not released to country radio, McEntire&#x27;s rendition was her only dance hit, reaching number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart.

===Reception===
Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;A Reba McEntire dance record? On paper, such an idea seems frighteningly incongruous. But in the hands of British production team Love To Infinity, the concept works like gangbusters. Playfully digging into the Supremes&#x27; pop classic, McEntire has a saucy style that is well-suited to the track&#x27;s storm of bright pop/house percussion and sugary synths. Her country base may find this a tad hard to swallow, but it is so darn good that you&#x27;ll be wishing for another romp in the disco round ASAP.&quot; Dan Glaister from &quot;The Guardian&quot; said songs like &quot;You Keep Me Hanging On&quot; are &quot;safe, solid, and destined for a marketing megablitz. They&#x27;re huge, but hardly country.&quot;

==Other versions==
In 1969, Mary McCaslin released a cover version. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it &quot;transforms the tune from an urban teen-oriented lament into a mountain-flavored folk song of quiet, adult desperation.&quot;

R&amp;B singer Wilson Pickett recorded a version of the Vanilla Fudge cover which was released as a single in 1969 and included on his 1970 album &quot;Right On&quot;. Pickett&#x27;s version reached number 16 on the US R&amp;B chart and 92 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Dianna Agron as Quinn Fabray performed the song in the &quot;Glee&quot; episode &quot;Throwdown&quot;. Raymund Flandez for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; was critical of this cover, which he called &quot;thin and jarring&quot;, while in 2015 &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described it as &quot;one of the best numbers in &quot;Glee&quot; history&quot; and Mashable ranked it in the show&#x27;s top 50 songs. The version peaked at number 166 on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending February 27, 2010.

<doc id="1236854" wikidata="Q95366506" url="?curid=1236854" title="Jit">
<text>Jit (also known as jiti, jit-jive and the [[Harare]] beat) is a style of popular Zimbabwean dance music. It features a swift rhythm played on drums and accompanied by a guitar. Jit evolved out many diverse influences, including domestic chimurenga, Congolese rumba and Tanzanian guitar styles.

The genre was popularized in the 1980s by bands like Chazezesa Challengers, The Four Brothers, and Bhundu Boys. Jit is one of Zimbabwean fast beat, but there is a confusion between the more popular &quot;sungura&quot; which is said to be Jit which was popularised by Chazezesa Challengers and many others including Alick Macheso and Orchestra Mberikwazvo.

Gibbs calls his type of Jit &quot;Urban Jit&quot; due to its mellowness and soft tempo which comprises fused elements of calypso, country, and any other genre depending on the composition as a way to improve its appeal to the new generation as culture is always evolving.

Jit music is originally played by people singing in a circle and playing to or singing with one or two drums called &quot;Mutumba&quot; and these drums are played in rhythm with each other and in sync with the song&quot; vocals&quot;. One will be leading with the vocals and the rest will answer to the call and sometimes sing altogether in harmony, the lead vocalist may chant and the people answering will give the vocalist room to do all the adlibing before they answer.

In the early 1970s there was a very popular group called &quot;Dzumbunu Choir&quot;. This group used to play raw Jit with the basic instruments of drum or drums and &quot;hosho&quot; jingles. Dzumbunu Choir was resident at Goromonzi or Arcturus area about sixty kilometres out of Harare on the North eastern side. As people sing they may use jingles or &quot;hosho&quot; shakers as African music is generally percussive. Jit is in nowadays mostly used in its raw content by political parties as a campaign vehicle due to its flexibility in accommodating chants, singing, expressiveness and infectious tunes that are so catchy and easy to learn if a new song is introduced.

Jit is a highly danceable beat that commands the listener to dance and there are so many types of dances associated with it such as hwishu, tuwisti, kongonya, borodhero, honda, chipisi and many others. Bhorodhero is the most popular one due to it being popularised by Alick Macheso and System Tazvida&#x27;s Chazezesa Challengers in their repertoires. The name bhorodhero is a derivative from a race course&#x27;s name in Harare called Borrowdale Race Course as the dance resembles a galloping horse.

<text>Augusto Barcia y Trelles (5 March 1881 – 19 June 1961) was a Spanish politician, several times member of the Congress of Deputies, who served as acting Prime Minister of Spain from 10 May 1936 to 13 May 1936 due to former PM Manuel Azaña being elected as President of the Republic. He was also a lawyer and a Freemason.

== Biography ==
=== Youth and formation ===
Born in Vegadeo, province of Oviedo, on March 5, 1881. Doctor in Law and lawyer, he was the brother of Camilo Barcia Trelles, professor of International Law, who had Adolfo Miaja de la Muela as a disciple.

From an early age he stood out in the journalistic field. Founder of the magazine &quot;La Joven España&quot;, he would collaborate with newspapers such as &quot;El Correo&quot;, &quot;El Liberal&quot; or &quot;La Libertad&quot; and also served as correspondent of several foreign newspapers in Spain. Barcia, of firm Europeanist convictions and favorable to the Allies in the course of the World War I, would publish during the conflict a good number of articles and chronicles in &quot;El Liberal&quot;, newspaper of which he would also become director in 1914.

=== Beginnings in politics ===
In his youth Barcia was a member of the circle of friends of the politician Segismundo Moret, a prominent member of the Liberal Party. Under the influence of Moret and Gumersindo de Azcárate, he ended up militating in the Reformist Party of Melquíades Álvarez. As a member of the Spanish Cortes he was firmly against the Antiterrorist Act pushed in 1908 by then-PM Antonio Maura.

For the elections of 1914 he presented his candidacy for deputy in Cortes for the Almería district of Vera; he did so presenting himself under the initials of the Reformist Party and with the clear support of some notables of this formation in Almería However, he was not elected deputy. In the elections of 1916 he would obtain a deputy seat for the district of Vera, and later he would revalidate the seat in the elections of 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1923.

During his time in the Cortes he would stand out especially for his interventions on foreign policy. After the establishment of the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera he retired from active politics, devoting himself to his profession as a lawyer. The refusal of Melquíades Álvarez to criticize the dictatorship would lead Augusto Barcia to distance himself from his former political godfather.

=== Second Republic ===
In 1931, with the advent of the Second Republic, he returned to politics. In the elections to the Constituent Courts of that year he ran as a deputy for the Almería circumscription, but was not elected. Despite this failure, he played an important role at the national level during these years. In 1931 the government appointed him president of the Consejo Superior Bancario (&quot;Higher Banking Council&quot;) and a year later he was appointed representative of Spain to the League of Nations in Geneva.

After a period of approximation, in 1933 he joined Republican Action (AR), the party of Manuel Azaña. Thanks to Barcia&#x27;s influence, the &quot;Diario de Almería&quot; became the provincial organ of the Republican Action party.

With a view to the November 1933 elections, he forged an alliance between Republican Action and Lerroux&#x27;s Radical Party in the province of Almería, managing to obtain a seat. Barcia was one of the few deputies that Republican Action obtained, which suffered a general defeat in the elections. Faced with this situation, AR would join with the Galician Republicans and the independent radical-socialists to form a new party, Republican Left (IR), a formation in which Augusto Barcia would also join. Within the Almeria provincial organization of IR he became its main leader.

He would defend Lluís Companys and other members of the Generalitat of Catalonia for their participation in the proclamation of the Catalan State in October 1934.

In the elections of February 1936 he was part of the Popular Front candidates for Almería, being the most voted candidate -with 68,175 votes- and managing to revalidate his deputy&#x27;s seat. After the victory obtained by the Popular Front coalition, on February 19 he was appointed Minister of State in the cabinet presided over by Manuel Azaña. Between May 11 and 13 he would assume the post of President of the Council of Ministers, after the resignation of Azaña -who had been elected President of the Republic-. He would be succeeded at the head of the government by Santiago Casares Quiroga, maintaining, however, the post of Minister of State.

After the Civil War, in July 1936, he assumed the post of Minister of the Interior in the very brief government headed by Diego Martínez Barrio. He would again hold the portfolio of State in the cabinet presided over by José Giral, leaving in September 1936. He was appointed Spanish ambassador to Uruguay, although he would not assume the post due to the rupture of relations between the two countries. Although he remained in the background, he attended the meetings that the Republican Cortes held in October 1937 and August 1938. As the war progressed, he would serve as advisor to the Spanish Embassy in Paris and as Spanish ambassador to the Soviet Union.

=== Exile and last years ===
Seeing the war irretrievably lost, in 1939 he left Europe and moved to Latin America, settling in Buenos Aires.

His departure into exile was followed by repression on the part of Franco&#x27;s dictatorship. The Special Tribunal for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism sentenced him to thirty years imprisonment and absolute disqualification from practicing his profession, while the National Tribunal for Political Responsibilities imposed a fine of twenty-five million pesetas and the confiscation of all his assets. It was even proposed that he should lose his Spanish nationality.

Since 1941 he was president of the Patronato Hispano-Argentino de Cultura, developing a feverish activity as a writer and lecturer.21 In parallel, he would also collaborate actively with the Republican institutions in exile: he was part of the central board of Acción Republicana Española, at the same time he served as delegate in Argentina of the Junta Española de Liberación. After the Second World War, he attended in Mexico City the meeting of the Republican Courts in exile. In August 1945 he became Minister of Finance of the government-in-exile presided over by José Giral, a position he would hold until August 1947. 

He died in Buenos Aires on June 19, 1961.

== Private life ==
Throughout his life he was the author of several works of a juridical-political and historical nature. In addition to Spanish, he was also fluent in Italian, French, English and German.

He was a member of the Ateneo de Madrid from 1908, an institution in which he was very active and held positions of responsibility, such as general secretary and president (a position he held between December 1932 and June 1933). Between 1925 and 1926 he was president of the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation. He was also a member of the Madrid Press Association (from 1916) and of the Association of Friends of the Soviet Union, the latter of which was formed in 1933. 

== Masonic activity ==
Augusto Barcia was a distinguished Mason. Having been initiated in the Madrilenian lodge &quot;Ibérica&quot; in 1910, he developed an important work in the Masonic institution to the point that he was elected Grand Master of the Gran Oriente Español in 1921. After the death of Enrique Gras Morillo, on December 9, 1928. he was elected Sovereign Grand Commendator of the Supreme Council of the 33rd Degree for Spain of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, a position he held until 1933, year in which he resigned because he understood that Freemasonry should be separated from any political activity, arguing his resignation as follows:
