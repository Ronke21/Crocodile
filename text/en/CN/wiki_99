<text>Debra Susan &quot;Debbie&quot; Goad (February 13, 1954 – July 20, 2000) was an American journalist and assistant editor of the magazine &quot;Answer Me!&quot; Her husband, Jim Goad, was the magazine&#x27;s primary writer and editor. She also contributed to the zine &quot;Temp Slave!&quot;

Goad grew up in a Jewish family in the Sea Gate neighborhood of Coney Island in Brooklyn, meeting Jim Goad while he was living in New Jersey. In 1995, Goad and her husband Jim were charged with one felony count of promoting pornography because of offensive content in &quot;Answer Me!&quot; magazine, they faced a maximum sentence of five years in jail and a $10,000 fine. They were found not guilty.

Jim and Debbie Goad divorced in 1997, around the same time she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She died in July 2000, aged 46, from ovarian cancer in Multnomah County, Oregon. Her mother had reportedly also died from the same disease and Goad reportedly wished to be cremated, but her brother, Dr. Mitchell Rosalie, a physician from New York City, was reportedly unable to locate her will and she was interred next to their mother&#x27;s grave.

<text>The String Quartet No. 20 in D major, K. 499, was written in 1786 in Vienna by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It was published by – if not indeed written for – his friend Franz Anton Hoffmeister. Because of this, the quartet has acquired the nickname Hoffmeister. Hoffmeister had started issuing a series of chamber-music publications in 1785, including Mozart&#x27;s K. 499 as well as Joseph Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet No. 35, Op. 42.

==Structure==
There are four movements:

This work, sandwiched between the six Haydn Quartets (1782–85) and the following three Prussian Quartets (1789–90), is often polyphonic in a way uncharacteristic of the earlier part of the classical music era. The menuetto and its trio give good examples of this in brief, with the brief irregular near-canon between first violin and viola in the second half of the main portion of the minuet, and the double imitations in the trio between the violins, and between the viola and cello.

<text>Levice (; , : ; ) is a town in western Slovakia. The town lies on the left bank of the lower Hron river. The Old Slavic name of the town was &quot;Leva&quot;, which means &quot;the Left One&quot;.

The town is located in the north-eastern corner of the Danubian Lowland (&quot;Podunajská nížina&quot;), east of Bratislava, south-east of Nitra, south-west of Banská Štiavnica, south-west of Zvolen and from the border with Hungary.

It is the capital of the Levice District, which is the largest district in Slovakia at . The town&#x27;s heraldic animal is lion (in Slovak &quot;lev&quot;), and the town&#x27;s colours are green and yellow.

==History==

Levice is first mentioned as Leua, one of the villages belonging to the parish of St. Martin&#x27;s Church in Bratka () in 1156. It was part of the comitatus Tekov (&quot;Bars&quot;).

First attacked by the Turks in 1544, the town was set on fire while the castle was left unharmed. Between 1581 and 1589, the settlement was the seat of the Captaincy of Lower Hungary. The town was captured by the Turks in 1663 but recaptured only a year later by the Imperial Army led by General de Souches in the Battle of Levice, which took place beneath the town&#x27;s castle. 

During the anti-Habsburg revolution of 1709, the fort was blown up by kuruces.
After the break-up of Austria-Hungary, the town became part of Czechoslovakia according to demarcation lines drawn by Entente forces in late 1918, with Czechoslovak troops reaching the city in January 1919 and Hungary giving up claim over it in 1920 by signing the Trianon treaty. As part of the breakup of Czechoslovakia under the Munich Agreement in World War II, the town again belonged to Hungary from 1938 to 1945. At the end of the Second World War it was returned to the restored Czechoslovakia. In 1993 it became part of present-day Slovakia.

It was the hometown of Hungarian-American Eugene Fodor (1905–1991), the founder of Fodor&#x27;s travel book company.

<text>Leopoldo Ramón Pedro Calvo-Sotelo y Bustelo, 1st Marquess of Ría de Ribadeo (; 14 April 1926 – 3 May 2008), usually known as Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, was Prime Minister of Spain between 1981 and 1982.

==Early life and career==

Calvo-Sotelo was born into a prominent political family in Madrid on 14 April 1926 with his father, Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo, and his mother, Mercedes Bustelo Márquez. The assassination of his uncle, José Calvo Sotelo, who had been finance minister under Miguel Primo de Rivera, was a key event leading up to the Spanish Civil War. Calvo-Sotelo graduated as a civil engineer from the School of Civil Engineers of Madrid now part of the Technical University of Madrid, working in the area of applications of chemistry to the industry.

He was the president of Renfe (the Spanish national railroad network) between 1967 and 1968. Calvo-Sotelo was elected solicitor (Deputy) of Franco&#x27;s Cortes, representing industrialists in the Union of Chemical Industries, in 1971. A monarchist, Sotelo was one of the founders of an association of politicians, mostly of Rightists and Center Rightists, which disguised as the Fedisa publishing firm helped Spain&#x27;s peaceful transition into democracy.

==Political career==
Calvo-Sotelo was designated Minister of Commerce by Carlos Arias Navarro to be in the first government of the Monarchy (December 1975 – July 1976). He advocated a true transition to democracy instead of mere superficial changes that politicians like Navarro planned. Calvo-Sotelo was kept in the cabinet of Adolfo Suárez upon his succession to premiership in 1976 and directed several centre-right and centre-left political associations into one party, the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD). Calvo-Sotelo was part of the Tacito group in the cabinet along with Eduardo Carriles, Andrés Reguera, Landelino Lavilla, Enrique de la Mata, Marcelino Oreja and Alfonso Osorio. The UCD won in both the June 1977 and the March 1979 elections and Calvo-Sotelo was elected MP for Madrid.

==President of the Government of Spain==

Suárez decided to keep him in the Cabinet, first from 1978 to 1980 as Minister for Relations of the European Economic Community, then as Second Vicepresident in charge of economic affairs. After the resignation of Suárez on 29 January 1981, he was supposed to be appointed Prime Minister () on 23 February, and advocated Spain&#x27;s proposed entry into NATO as soon as possible. However, on that date a session of the Congress of Deputies was interrupted by the attempted coup of 23-F. After the failed coup, his appointment as Prime Minister was confirmed on 25 February by the vote of all the UCD members of the congress and 21 others as well, giving him a majority of 186 to 158. Unlike his predecessors, Sotelo was more inclined to reverse Spain&#x27;s historically hostile stance towards Israel. However, his foreign minister José Pedro Pérez-Llorca would prevent Sotelo&#x27;s government from recognizing Israel, citing fears of an Arab oil embargo.

Splits in the UCD group led to the formation of three rival parties, the Democratic Action Party (Partido de Acción Democrática/PAD), which soon merged with the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) and Democratic Popular Party (PDP), resulting in the UCD being unable to count on sufficient support in the legislature. Fresh elections were called, resulting in a heavy defeat for the UCD, which won only 12 seats at the 1982 election compared to 168 in 1979. He served as Prime Minister until 1 December 1982 and was succeeded by the socialist Felipe González.

==Later years==

In 2002, Calvo-Sotelo was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos of Spain and given the hereditary title of &quot;Marqués de la Ría de Ribadeo&quot; (&quot;Marquess of Ría de Ribadeo&quot;), together with the dignity &quot;Grande de España&quot; (English: Grandee of Spain), this in honour for his service.

Calvo-Sotelo was also a member of the Club of Madrid and of the Spanish Royal Academy of Engineering.

He wrote several political autobiographical books: &quot;Memoria viva de la transición&quot; (Living memory of the Spanish transition), &quot;Papeles de un cesante&quot; (Papers from an unemployed person), and &quot;Pláticas de familia (1878–2003)&quot; (Family talks (1878-2003)).

He died of natural causes at his home in Pozuelo de Alarcón, on 3 May 2008 aged 82.

==Personal life==

<text>The Parrott rifle was a type of muzzle-loading rifled artillery weapon used extensively in the American Civil War.

==Parrott rifle==
The gun was invented by Captain Robert Parker Parrott, a West Point graduate. He was an American soldier and inventor of military ordnance. He resigned from the service in 1836 and became the superintendent of the West Point Foundry in Cold Spring, New York. He created the first Parrott rifle (and corresponding projectile) in 1860 and patented it in 1861. Daniel Treadwell, who developed a method for making built-up guns in the early 1840s, tried to claim that his patent infringed on an earlier one, but in 1866 United States District Court court dismissed it, deciding that Treadwell&#x27;s claim was invalidated by a 1843 British patent to John Frith.

Parrotts were manufactured with a combination of cast and wrought iron. The cast iron made for an accurate gun, but was brittle enough to suffer fractures. Hence, a large wrought iron reinforcing band was overlaid on the breech to give it additional strength. There were earlier cannons designed this way, but the method of securing this band was the innovation that allowed the Parrott to overcome the deficiencies of these earlier models. It was applied to the gun red-hot and then the gun was turned while pouring water down the muzzle, allowing the band to attach uniformly. By the end of the Civil War, both sides were using this type of gun extensively.

Parrott rifles were manufactured in different sizes, from the 10-pounder up to the rare 300-pounder. The 20-pounder was the largest field gun used during the war, with the barrel alone weighing over . Both the 10- and 20-pounders were used by both armies. The smaller size was much more prevalent; it came in two bore sizes: and . Confederate forces used both bore sizes during the war, which added to the complication of supplying the appropriate ammunition to its batteries. Until 1864, Union batteries used only the . The M1863, with a bore, had firing characteristics similar to the earlier model; it can be recognized by its straight barrel, without muzzle-swell. Its range was up to with a trained crew.

On June 23-24, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln made an unannounced visit to West Point, where he consulted with retired Gen. Winfield Scott regarding the handling of the Civil War and the staffing of the War Department. Following this meeting, President Lincoln visited the West Point Foundry at which the 100- and 200-pounder Parrott cannons were successfully demonstrated in live firing.

Naval versions of the 20-, 30-, 60-, and 100-pounder Parrotts were also used by the Union navy. The 100-pound naval Parrott could achieve a range of 6,900 yards (6,300 meters) at an elevation of 25 degrees, or fire an shell 7,810 yards (7,140 m) at 30 degrees elevation.

Although accurate, as well as being cheaper and easier to make than most rifled artillery guns, the Parrott had a poor reputation for safety and they were shunned by many artillerists. 
At the end of 1862, Henry J. Hunt attempted to get the Parrott eliminated from the Army of the Potomac&#x27;s inventory, preferring the 3-inch ordnance rifle. When the Parrott gun burst in battle, gunners would chip out the jagged parts and continue firing. In 1889, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called on the Ordnance Bureau of the War Department to discontinue use of the Parrott gun altogether, following a series of mishaps at the West Point training grounds.

Several hundred Parrott gun tubes remain today, many adorning battlefield parks, county courthouses, and museums. The gun tubes made by Parrott&#x27;s foundry are identifiable by the letters WPF (West Point Foundry), along with a date stamp between 1860 and 1889, found on the front face of the gun tube. The first production Parrott gun tube (serial number 1) still exists, and is preserved on a reproduction gun carriage in the center square of Hanover, Pennsylvania, as part of a display commemorating the Battle of Hanover. A list of many of the surviving tubes can be found at the National Register of Surviving Civil War Artillery.

The larger sizes of Parrott rifles (100-pounder and up) were deployed in coast defense from 1863 to 1900, when they were replaced by Endicott period forts and weapons. Along with Rodman guns, some were deployed shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898 as a stopgap; it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US East Coast.

==The 300-pound solution==
By summer 1863, Union forces became frustrated by the heavily fortified Confederate position at Fort Sumter, and brought to bear the Parrott, along with several smaller cannons. In all, two 80-pounder Whitworths, nine 100-pounder Parrotts, six 200-pounder Parrotts, and a 300-pounder Parrott were deployed. It was widely believed in the north that a massive 10-inch Parrott would finally break the previously impenetrable walls of the fort, which had become the symbol of stalwart steadfastness for the Confederacy.

The &quot;Washington Republican&quot; described the technical accomplishments of the Parrott:
The shot, with a muzzle velocity of , strikes a target at with a velocity of about (this is almost beyond the range of the weapon). In contrast, the shot, with a muzzle velocity of , strikes the target at the same range still moving at , due to its much higher mass-to-drag ratio. The resulting huge difference in impact energy, for the shell, and over for the shell, means the penetrating energy of the larger shell is 20 times that of the smaller.

In terms of the ability to punch holes in fortifications, at that long range the light shell would be expected to only breach a brick wall. In contrast, the greater mass and retained velocity of the shell would enable it to penetrate of brick (given the quality of the material back then). The Union soldiers knew Fort Sumter&#x27;s brick walls averaged about thick, and thus recognized the potential for such a cannon to help them succeed in taking back their Fort.

==Swamp Angel==

A famous large Parrott cannon, called the Swamp Angel, was used by federal Brigadier General Quincy Adams Gillmore to bombard Charleston, South Carolina. It was manned by the 11th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment.

On August 21, 1863 Gillmore sent Confederate general P. G. T. Beauregard an ultimatum to abandon heavily fortified positions at Morris Island or the city of Charleston would be shelled. When the positions were not evacuated within a few hours, Gillmore ordered the Parrott rifle to fire on the city. Between August 22 and August 23, the Swamp Angel fired on the city 36 times (the gun burst on the 36th round), using many incendiary shells which caused little damage and few casualties. The battle was made more famous by Herman Melville&#x27;s poem &quot;The Swamp Angel&quot;.

After the war, a damaged Parrott rifle said to be the Swamp Angel was moved to Trenton, New Jersey, where it rests as a memorial today at Cadwalader Park.

==Parrott rifles by size==

(*) This time is an educated guess, the time is unknown.
Flight times appear to be extremely inaccurate. Example: 10-in (300-lb) projectile would have to average only to be in flight for 202 seconds to cover . A more accurate estimate will be in the range of 30 seconds.

<text>Film Roman, LLC, is an American animation studio currently based in Woodland Hills, California and formerly in Burbank. It was previously owned by Starz Inc., which is now a division of Lionsgate, and currently by Waterman Entertainment, the production company of producer Steve Waterman.

Founded by veteran animator and director Phil Roman on October 26, 1984, it is best known for providing animation for the &quot;Garfield&quot; primetime specials, based on Jim Davis&#x27; comic strip of the same name. The studio also produced the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Critic&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!&quot;, &quot;The Goode Family&quot;, and &quot;Dan Vs.&quot;.

== History ==
=== Background ===
Phil Roman, veteran alumnus of MGM Animation/Visual Arts and Bill Melendez Productions, founded Film Roman on October 26, 1984 as a means to continue the production of the &quot;Garfield&quot; television specials, since Melendez&#x27;s own studio was unable to work on both the &quot;Peanuts&quot; and &quot;Garfield&quot; specials. &quot;Peanuts&quot; executive producers Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez and their aforementioned studio had produced the first two &quot;Garfield&quot; specials, but due to both &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles M. Schulz&#x27; and &quot;Garfield&quot; creator Jim Davis&#x27; concerns about conflicting interests in allocating production priority at Melendez&#x27;s boutique studio, the production had to be moved. While he was leaving him and Melendez for his already-established studio, Roman was offered the opportunity to produce the next &quot;Garfield&quot; prime time special, &quot;Garfield in the Rough&quot; (1984), for CBS by Mendelson, which he accepted and went on to produce and direct all by himself, winning an Emmy in the process.

=== Formation ===
In 1985, CBS&#x27; head of children&#x27;s programming Judy Price had commissioned an animated television series based on the &quot;Garfield&quot; prime time special series, later ultimately titled &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, which took three years for Roman to decide developing and producing the program before it eventually aired on the network&#x27;s Saturday morning time slot, premiering on September 17, 1988. The aforementioned show was Film Roman&#x27;s first regular series. In 1986, in an effort to expand and diversify the studio, Roman hired Marvel Productions VP of Business Affairs and his own personal attorney, Michael Wahl, as President and Bill Schultz, Marvel&#x27;s Director of Development, to join in the company as the fledgling studio&#x27;s VP of Production and Development. &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; was expanded to an hour on CBS&#x27; number one rated Saturday Morning block and the studio grew to increase its capacity.

In 1988, the new management team developed, sold and produced a new series, &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot;, to the brand new Fox Kids Network, headed up by former Marvel Productions president Margaret Loesch. In 1992 to 2016, Film Roman took over the source production of 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons&quot; from Klasky-Csupo who had produced the one-minute teaser cartoon shorts on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; as well as the animation for the first three seasons and the first two episodes of the fourth season (in total 61 episodes). The studio went on to grow and produce many popular animated series now seen all around the world.

In 1999, Film Roman&#x27;s founder Phil Roman left and sold the company to form Phil Roman Entertainment, the studio that produced Christmas television specials including &quot;Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer&quot; (2000), but he remained a shareholder of the company and then subsequently rejoined in 2001 as a member of the company&#x27;s board of directors

At the same time, it attempted to get into the syndication market with the launch of Max Degree TV, which would have consisted of three shows, &quot;Mission Extreme&quot; from Steve Tisch, &quot;Skins from the Deep&quot; from SFX artist Steve Wang, and a new Wes Archer cartoon &quot;Victor&quot;, but it never got off the ground.

In April 2000, The Harvey Entertainment Company became Film Roman&#x27;s international sales representative and distributor in an effort for the former to branch out of its existing properties. Within the same year, India-based software firm Pentamedia Graphics attempted to acquire 51% stake in the studio for $15 million, but the deal later terminated in 2001.

===IDT Entertainment and Starz ownership===

In May 2003, the Digital Production Solutions division of IDT Corporation (formed in 2002) announced that it would acquire a 51% controlling interest and stake in Film Roman, which would temporarily renamed as DPS Film Roman, and the studio later became part of the newly-formed IDT Entertainment division in November that year.
In May 2006, IDT sold the IDT Entertainment division, which includes Film Roman, to Liberty Media for $186 million, the sale was completed on August 31, 2006, which resulted in IDT Entertainment becoming part of Starz Entertainment Group and renamed as Starz Media.

=== Waterman Entertainment ownership ===
In 2015, Film Roman was acquired from its parent company Starz Distribution by Waterman Entertainment, the production company of executive producer Steve Waterman. As such, it now does business with Starz, which owns the company&#x27;s catalogue.

On November 22, 2016, the company formed a joint venture based in Tijuana, called Film Roman Baja J.V. (also known as Film Roman Baja Productions), with Boxel Studios, a Baja California-based animation facility.

=== Location ===
The original studio was located on Riverside Drive in Toluca Lake, California, where Roman was also joined by Melendez producer Lee Mendelson. Years later, the studio moved to a new location on Chandler Blvd. in Studio City, before settling into another location at Starz Plaza on Hollywood Way in Burbank, which it shared with the former Hub Network and Hasbro Studios/Allspark, and finally settling into its present location in Woodland Hills.

<doc id="1264824" wikidata="Q3312149" url="?curid=1264824" title="Microcosm (CERN)">
<text>Microcosm or CERN Museum was an interactive exhibition presenting the work of the CERN particle physics laboratory and its flagship accelerator the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It first opened to the public in 1990 and closed permanently in September 2022, to be replaced by the &quot;Science Gateway&quot; in 2023. The final version of the exhibition opened in January 2016, developed by CERN in collaboration with Spanish design team Indissoluble.

== History ==
The project was approved by the CERN Directorate in February 1988. The initial construction, to a large extent completed in 1989, was financed through contributions from the Canton of Geneva, the Swiss Confederation, neighbouring France, banks, and industrial firms.

== Main exhibits ==
The exhibition displayed many real objects, taking visitors on a journey through CERN&#x27;s key installations, from the hydrogen bottle, source of the protons that are injected into the LHC, through the first step in the accelerator chain, the linac, on to a model of a section of the Large Hadron Collider including elements from the superconducting magnets. Visitors could interact with the displays to try their hand at the controls of a particle accelerator – simulating the acceleration of protons in the LHC and bringing them into collision inside the experiments.

The exhibition contained a 1:1 scale model of a complete slice through the CMS experiment at the LHC. The computing section displayed some of the Oracle data tapes used to store the 30-40 petabytes of data produced yearly by the experiments, made available for analysis using the LHC Computing GRID. The annex to the exhibition contained other historical artifacts such as the central tracker from the UA1 detector, which ran at the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN from 1981 to 1984, and helped discover the W and Z bosons.

== Special projects ==
A project began in 2013 to preserve the original hardware and software associated with the birth of the World Wide Web. Some of the original code resides on Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s NeXT Computer in the CERN museum and has not been recovered due to the computer&#x27;s status as a historical artifact. This effort coincided with the 20th anniversary of the research center giving the web to the world.

== Microcosm garden ==
The Microcosm garden is named Léon Van Hove Square in honour of CERN&#x27;s Research Director-General from 1976 to 1980. The garden features several large components of old CERN experiments.
== Location ==
Microcosm was located at CERN in the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland, near the town of Meyrin. Entrance was free, without reservation, open 6 days a week.

<text>Harmonice Mundi (Latin: &quot;The Harmony of the World&quot;, 1619) is a book by Johannes Kepler. In the work, written entirely in Latin, Kepler discusses harmony and in geometrical forms and physical phenomena. The final section of the work relates his discovery of the so-called third law of planetary motion.

The full title is Harmonices mundi libri V (&quot;The Five Books of The Harmony of the World&quot;), which is commonly but ungrammatically shortened to Harmonices mundi.

==Background and history==
Kepler began working on &quot;Harmonice Mundi&quot; around 1599, which was the year Kepler sent a letter to Michael Maestlin detailing the mathematical data and proofs that he intended to use for his upcoming text, which he originally planned to name &quot;De harmonia mundi&quot;. Kepler was aware that the content of &quot;Harmonice Mundi&quot; closely resembled that of the subject matter for Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Harmonica&quot;, but was not concerned. The new astronomy Kepler would use (most notably the adoption of elliptic orbits in the Copernican system) allowed him to explore new theorems. Another important development that allowed Kepler to establish his celestial-harmonic relationships was the abandonment of the Pythagorean tuning as the basis for musical consonance and the adoption of geometrically supported musical ratios; this would eventually be what allowed Kepler to relate musical consonance and the angular velocities of the planets. Thus, Kepler could reason that his relationships gave evidence for God acting as a grand geometer, rather than a Pythagorean numerologist.

The concept of musical harmonies intrinsically existing within the spacing of the planets existed in medieval philosophy prior to Kepler. &quot;Musica universalis&quot; was a traditional philosophical metaphor that was taught in the quadrivium, and was often called the &quot;music of the spheres.&quot; Kepler was intrigued by this idea while he sought explanation for a rational arrangement of the heavenly bodies. When Kepler uses the term &quot;harmony&quot; it is not strictly referring to the musical definition, but rather a broader definition encompassing congruence in Nature and the workings of both the celestial and terrestrial bodies. He notes musical harmony as being a product of man, derived from angles, in contrast to a harmony that he refers to as being a phenomenon that interacts with the human soul. In turn, this allowed Kepler to claim the Earth has a soul because it is subjected to astrological harmony.

While writing the book, Kepler had to defend his mother in court after she had been accused of witchcraft.

==Content==
Kepler divides &quot;The Harmony of the World&quot; into five long chapters: the first is on regular polygons; the second is on the congruence of figures; the third is on the origin of harmonic proportions in music; the fourth is on harmonic configurations in astrology; the fifth is on the harmony of the motions of the planets.

=== Chapter 1 and 2 ===
Chapters 1 and 2 of &quot;The Harmony of the World&quot; contain most of Kepler&#x27;s contributions concerning polyhedra. He is primarily interested with how polygons, which he defines as either regular or semiregular, can come to be fixed together around a central point on a plane to form congruence. His primary objective was to be able to rank polygons based on a measure of sociability, or rather, their ability to form partial congruence when combined with other polyhedra. He returns to this concept later in &quot;Harmonice Mundi&quot; with relation to astronomical explanations. In the second chapter is the earliest mathematical understanding of two types of regular star polyhedra, the small and great stellated dodecahedron; they would later be called Kepler&#x27;s solids or Kepler Polyhedra and, together with two regular polyhedra discovered by Louis Poinsot, as the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra. He describes polyhedra in terms of their faces, which is similar to the model used in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; to describe the formation of Platonic solids in terms of basic triangles. The book features illustrations of solids and tiling patterns, some of which are related to the golden ratio.

While medieval philosophers spoke metaphorically of the &quot;music of the spheres&quot;, Kepler discovered physical harmonies in planetary motion. He found that the difference between the maximum and minimum angular speeds of a planet in its orbit approximates a harmonic proportion. For instance, the maximum angular speed of the Earth as measured from the Sun varies by a semitone (a ratio of 16:15), from &quot;mi&quot; to &quot;fa&quot;, between aphelion and perihelion. Venus only varies by a tiny 25:24 interval (called a diesis in musical terms). Kepler explains the reason for the Earth&#x27;s small harmonic range:

The celestial choir Kepler formed was made up of a tenor (Mars), two bass (Saturn and Jupiter), a soprano (Mercury), and two altos (Venus and Earth). Mercury, with its large elliptical orbit, was determined to be able to produce the greatest number of notes, while Venus was found to be capable of only a single note because its orbit is nearly a circle. At very rare intervals all of the planets would sing together in &quot;perfect concord&quot;: Kepler proposed that this may have happened only once in history, perhaps at the time of creation. Kepler reminds us that harmonic order is only mimicked by man, but has origin in the alignment of the heavenly bodies:

Kepler discovers that all but one of the ratios of the maximum and minimum speeds of planets on neighboring orbits approximate musical harmonies within a margin of error of less than a diesis (a 25:24 interval). The orbits of Mars and Jupiter produce the one exception to this rule, creating the inharmonic ratio of 18:19.

=== Chapter 5 ===
Chapter 5 includes a long digression on astrology. This is immediately followed by Kepler&#x27;s third law of planetary motion, which shows a constant proportionality between the cube of the semi-major axis of a planet&#x27;s orbit and the square of the time of its orbital period. Kepler&#x27;s previous book, &quot;Astronomia nova&quot;, related the discovery of the first two principles now known as Kepler&#x27;s laws.

==Recent history==
A copy of the 1619 edition was stolen from the National Library of Sweden in the 1990s.

==Use in recent music==
A small number of recent compositions either make reference to or are based on the concepts of Harmonice Mundi or Harmony of the Spheres. The most notable of these are:
*Laurie Spiegel: &quot;Kepler&#x27;s Harmony of the Worlds&quot; (1977). An excerpt of the piece was selected by Carl Sagan for inclusion on the Voyager Golden Record, launched aboard the Voyager spacecraft.
* Mike Oldfield, (English musician and composer, born 1953), &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; (album released in 2008 by Mercury Records).
* Joep Franssens (Dutch composer, born 1955), &quot;Harmony of the Spheres&quot; (cycle in five movements for mixed choir and string orchestra), composed 2001.
* Philip Glass, American composer, &quot;Kepler&quot; opera (2009), homage to Johannes Kepler, commissioned by the city of Linz, where the astronomer lived.
* Tim Watts, (English composer, born 1979), &quot;Kepler&#x27;s Trial&quot; (2016–2017), premiered at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (2016); revised version performed at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 November 2017
* Paul Hindemith, German composer, &quot;Die Harmonie der Welt&quot; Symphony (originally entitled Symphonie „Die Harmonie der Welt“ in German), IPH 50, is a symphony composed in 1951, and which served as the basis for the 1957 opera &quot;Die Harmonie der Welt&quot;.
* Miriam Monaghan (British recorder player and composer) &quot;Kepler’s Planets&quot; (2019), written for Palisander Recorder Quartet. Extracts were premiered live on BBC Radio 3 In Tune (October 2019) with full concert premiere at London International Festival of Early Music (November 2019).
* Dave Soldier, American composer, wrote &quot;Motet: Harmony of the World&quot; (2022), closely hewing to Kepler&#x27;s instructions in the book for a future composer to write a motet, including the use of a specific six-voice choir (recorded by the microtonal choir Ekmeles), the particular just intonation intervals, and the harmonies allowed in Kepler&#x27;s diagrams. The text sets the Prayer to the Sun by Proclus in ancient Greek, a poet heavily quoted in Kepler&#x27;s text.

<doc id="1264848" wikidata="Q626368" url="?curid=1264848" title="NOW (manhwa)">
<text>NOW () is a manhwa by Park Sung-woo. It is published by Seoul Munhwasa and serialized in the weekly magazine &quot;IQ Jump Comics&quot;. It was printed in the United States by ComicsOne until it closed, and then distributed by Infinity Studios, who mainly published newer volumes digitally, until it was also defunct, leaving the series incomplete to English-speakers.

==Story==
The story of &quot;NOW&quot; is set in Goguryeo and stars Bi-Ryu, a martial artist, and Ah-Rin, a bubbly girl with a sword, as they go on various adventures. The series is currently finished with 25 volumes in South Korea and up to 6 volumes in United States. &quot;NOW&quot; is an action/fighting oriented comic targeted towards male fans.

==Characters==
===Sa-Shin-Mu disciples===
;Pa Goon-Sung&#x27;s disciples
* Bi-Ryu ()
:The main character of &quot;NOW&quot;. Practitioner of the &quot;Sashinmu&quot; (사신무) killing style. He has distinct silver colored hair. He was the adopted grandson of North Star, and holds himself responsible for North Star&#x27;s death. He seems to be developing a crush on Rin. Bi-Ryu is a rather simple young man, unable to catch up with the times on his own. This is shown when he and Ah-Rin prepare to embark on their quest. She asks if he is all packed, and if so, where are his things. He casts a finger to Cho-Ryung in response. He also had casually walked in on Yhun Ah-Rin and Cho Ryung in a bath, Bi Ryu asked directions and left as though she was not naked, Cho Ryung seems to have the same casualness. However, he is merciless in combat, referring to himself as a Sa-Shin, a death god. He has been shown to descend into a ferocious killing rage during battle, with Ah-Rin being the only one able to return him to normal.
* Yu Sae-Ha ()
: One of the male protagonists of &quot;NOW&quot;. A good person at first but is becomes twisted and evil by a traumatic incident in the first volume. Originally sent with his brothers to destroy Sashinmu&#x27;s secrets upon his swordmaster&#x27;s last wishes. He discovered his older brother had secretly been working for an opposing force, and was nearly killed by him. It was this brother&#x27;s sword that left the scar on his cheek. Together, the two plunge into a chasm, and he barely survived unlike his brother. He acquires the Sashinmu killing technique from reading the Sashinmu book with the purpose of changing the world so as to acknowledge his strength and, indirectly, his reason for existing. Yu Sae-Ha&#x27;s style of Sashinmu is unique, for it utilizes negative (ice / Yin) ki instead of positive (fire / Yang) ki, as a result of him having absorbed Yhun Ah-Ran&#x27;s ki. Originally starting out as a shy and timid character, Yu Sae-Ha grows obsessed with power as the story goes on, willing to do anything to become stronger. He harbors feelings for Yhun Ah-Ran.

;Yhun Oh-Rhang&#x27;s disciples
* Yhun Ah-Rin ()
:The 15-year-old female protagonist of &quot;NOW&quot;. Though powerful thanks to her father&#x27;s transferred Sashinmu energy, she is considered a bit of a . She seems to be developing a romantic interest upon Bi-Ryu, starting from when Bi Ryu saw her naked body, her mother and sister have told her she has to marry the first man to see her naked body. Her mother, the legendary Whur Ha-Rhang(Lunar Ice in English version) (월하랑), has trained both her and her sister in the heavenly mountain sword stance, which constantly circulates a type of internal ki to accentuate constant movement in battle. However, when Ah-Rin was younger, she accidentally ingested a poisonous herb. To save her life, her father transmitted some of his own Sashinmu energy to her, thus saving her life and at the same time preventing her from mastering the sword stance at her current level.
* Yhun Ah-Ran ()
: Elder sister of Yhun Ah-Rin. Ah-Rin is much more stoic than her sister. After a confrontation with Bi-Ryu, she is left injured and drained of energy. It is here that she is captured and taken to Mother Demon&#x27;s palace, where she is held captive until Yu-Sae Ha rescues her. It is discovered that she had killed Demon Mother&#x27;s younger brother in an earlier confrontation during her search for Rin. She is eventually paired up with Yu Sae-Ha in a secondary storyline. Unlike her sister, Ah-Ran seems to have nearly, if not completely, mastered the stance, as she has displayed advanced techniques. However, as Yu Sae-Ha has absorbed her ki, it is unknown whether or not she is still able to fight.

;Gi-Wang-Mu&#x27;s disciple traveling with Bi-Ryu
* Cho-Ryung ()
: A feral cat-like girl that is the traveling companion of Ah-Rin and Bi-Ryu. She is unable to talk and instead makes animal-like noises to communicate. It is speculated that she is the creation of Mother Demon. Bi-Ryu considers her a simple piece of property, to which she holds no objection to. She is very powerful, able to make off with Ah-Rin&#x27;s rather heavy sword at the beginning of the series holding it only by her teeth. Cho-Ryung, like most animals, despises water and only after being caught and forced will she bathe.

===Myung Wang Shin Gyo===
;Head
* The former head
:She was also a reincarnation of Parvati. She is the eldest sister of Shiva and Ganesha. During a war between the Shaolin and the Myeong Wang Shin Gyo, she sacrificed herself by throwing her own body into fire in order to save Shiva and the Myong Wang Shin Gyo children.
* Nirvana (니르바나)
: A little girl introduced in volume 4, Nirvana is not all she appears to be. She is Indian and is first seen as a child who Ah-Gi has taken to kill and make into food. Bi-Ryu and Ah-Rin show up just in time to save her, though she shows no fear towards the man. He believes her to be a mute, as she has not spoken since he abducted her. Later, after meeting Bi Ryu&#x27;s Party she speaks slowly with future predictions, accurately predicting Yhun Ah-Rin kicking Bi Ryu. It is also known that she apparently is wanted, as a group of assassins intrude upon Bi-Ryu&#x27;s party and attempt to kill them to take Nirvana. She seems to like Cho Ryung, as she hugs her like a stuffed animal a lot (She&#x27;s also the only one who can understand what Cho Ryung says). She carries the memory of the former heads of Myung Wong Shin Gyo, Parvati.

;Chief minister and left-right ministers
* Asura (아수라)
: The former chief minister of Myung Wong Shin Gyo, master of Shiva. He and Sho-Rhim&#x27;s head Cheon Jong were former friends, they planned to keep the peace between Chinese Martial World and Myung Gyo, but failed by the evil Sho-Rhim monk Cheon Seung, who only followed the way of power.
* Brahma Brothers
They were the ministers of Myung Wong Shin Gyo, in the generation of Shiva&#x27;s eldest sister.
: After the Cult&#x27;s House had been destroyed, they served Shiva as new chief minister. When they discovered that Shiva was using Yaksha&#x27;s seal to create Ananga, they attempted to stop him but were defeated. The elder lost his eyes and two arms, while the younger lost the lower body. They combined to form a body to protect together. They taught Yu Sae-Ha the secret skill of Gyu Yeom — grandmaster of Sa-Shin-Mu — Pa-Yeol-Jin (Destroying Quake).
* Shiva (시바)
: Chief minister of Myeong Wang Shin Gyo. He used Yaksha&#x27;s seal to create the Ananga to assist him in the way to destroy the Chinese Martial World.
* Lakshmi (라크슈미)
:Head of the security detail in Myeong Wang Shin Gyo. She and Ganesha make up the Ministers of the Right and Left respectively. Her primary duty is to provide security to the Chief Minister (Shiva). Her and Ganesha are apparently not on good terms. It is said that her powers are on par with Ganesha, but she is not the &quot;brute force&quot; type. Instead, she is known to make deals and use subversive methods to do her job. She often passes herself off as the &quot;lovely little lady&quot;. When Ganesha returns with Yu Sae-Ha and Yhun Ah-Rin, Shiva requests that she &quot;lightly spar&quot; with Yu Sae-Ha. She displays here her actual strength, seeming to teleport to and from. It also seems her physical strength is above average, as with one kick, she sends Yu Sae-Ha flying upwards into the air, despite his unintentional defense. She also cares much for Rakshasha, despite her attempts to deny it.
* Ganesha (가네샤)
:The head of security in the Myung Wong Shin Gyo. He seems to be a controlling man, telling Ran and Rin&#x27;s parents he had come to handle business with Mother Demon, but became captivated with their fighting skills. His apparently true purpose of coming was to obtain the secrets of Sashinmu. He seems to be powerful as well, escaping from the two skilled warriors with the only damage received the losing of the bottom portion of his mask. He entices Yu Sae-Ha to accompany him to Myeong Wang Shin Gyo along with Yhun Ah-Ran. It is later revealed that he is the twin (younger) brother of Shiva, and that he only takes off his mask when he is needed to &quot;stand in&quot; for Shiva in certain situations.

;Chil-Rhun-Sa (Seven-Wheels Children)
* Cheong Mo ()
:Il-Rhun (, Sun Wheel)
: A Westerner who, as a child, was brought into the East as a slave. He has the skill Dok-Shim-Sul (Mind-Reading Skill), as well as high-level Qing Gong. He tested Bi Ryu&#x27;s strength before revealing him the way to the Myeong Wang Shin Gyo.
* Unknown member - Whur-Rhun (, Moon Wheel)
:He is the assassin sent to kill Ah-Rin in Mo-Yong house. But he is killed by Ja Hye and Mo-Yong Bi. In the end, he puts a joke: &quot;I&#x27;m killed so fast that I can&#x27;t present my name!&quot;.
* Akni (아크니)
:Hwa-Rhun (, Fire Wheel)
* Baraha (바라하)
:To-Rhun (, Earth Wheel)
: Is his best status in the ground. Defeated by Bi-Ryu.
* Matshia (마트시아)
:Sue-Rhun (, Water Wheel)
: Is his best battle status in the deep water. Defeated by Ah-Rin.
* Hanuman (하누만)
:Mok-Rhun (, Wooden Wheel)
: Uses the poisonous insects to eliminate opponents. Defeated by Mo-Yong Rin and Hyun.
* Rakshasha (라크샤샤)
:Kim-Rhun (, Metal Wheel)
: Best in assassination. Defeated by Ah-Ran.

;Gwi-Wang-Mo&#x27;s faction (Lady Demon King Mother)
* Gwi-Wang-Mo ()
: An old lady with powerful strength. She raised Cho Ryung, So Goon, Shi Rang, and the Mae Ran Guk Juk. Her desire to become the strongest in the Wulin World went to smoke when she met Yhun Orang. Ultimately, she died by the hands of Lakshmi, but not before showing last bit of kindness to her pupil, So Gun.
* So Gun ()
: A beautiful cross-dressing boy. He used to envy &quot;Baek-Rhang-Gyeon&quot; (White Wolf-Dog), who actually is Cho-Ryung, because his master praised her very highly. After his master&#x27;s death, he sets out to seek revenge against Ma Yeom Cheol, who he mistakenly believed had killed his master.
* Shi Rang ()
: Another cross-dressing boy in Gi-Wang-Mu&#x27;s faction. After Cho-Ryung&#x27;s escape, the Demon Mother had Shi Rang wearing the hand-claws with hope equal to Cho-Ryung&#x27;s ability.
* The four sisters
: Mae, Ran, Guk, Juk () are the guardian quadruplets protecting their master. They are later &quot;freed&quot; after So Gun, who wished them to experience freedom, decided to undertake the revenge for his master by himself. Their names are flowers: Ochna, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, Phyllostachys

;Others
* Britra (브리트라)
: A powerful fighter of Myung Wong Shin Gyo. He provoked Sae-Ha and Ah-Ran when they first came there. Defeated and killed by Sae-Ha after his training with the Brahma brothers, two former ministers of Myung Wong Shin Gyo in Shiva&#x27;s eldest sister&#x27;s generation.
* Ah-Gi ()
: An evil monk who is also a cannibal. He wields a cooking knife attached to a chain, which emits loud clinking sounds meant to distract the opponent during battle and perhaps make up for a lack of physical strength. He flaunts himself as a master cook. As the story progresses, Ah-Gi becomes more of a comic relief character than an actual threat. He has his own pages, located at the end of the Manhwa, called &quot;Ask Ah-Gi,&quot; a short comical strip of few pages where he (supposedly) answers questions from the readers, often involving Ah-Rin and Ah-Ran, and ends up getting beaten up/stabbed/slashed/etc. by the two girls.
* Dharma (다르마)
: An antagonist introduced in volume 4, he is a large muscular man with dark skin. His weapon is a spear named Shin-Chang NAGA that absorbs all his negative ki thus giving him the ability to hide his ki in fights. He is defeated by Bi Ryu, after mortally wounding Yhun Ah Rin. This inspires Bi-Ryu to &quot;pass judgement&quot; and deliver the &quot;Seven Dark Star Attacks&quot; upon the man and finally kill him. His last sight is that of Nirvana, whom he states is the Founder of Myeong Wang Shin Gyo.
* Seop Poong (섭풍)
: An assassin from Gi-Ryung-Bae, an assassin faction. He is the younger brother of Seop Jung, who was killed by Whur Ha-Rhang in The Legend of the Sirius. Followed by the author, his name came from the name of the protagonist of the manhua Feng Yun, Nie Feng.
* Ma Yeom-Cheol ()
: Also known as Ryong-Ma-Do-Jae () (Longma Saber&#x27;s Emperor). His daughter is kept hostage by Myeong Wang Shin Gyo, so he must obey the cult&#x27;s orders. He was ordered to kill the Mother of the Demon King, but before he would do so, Lakshmi intervened and killed the Mother.

==Other Martial Artists==
===Yhun Oh-Rhang&#x27;s Family===

* Ja Hye ()
: She was a servant/assassin to Mo-Yong Bi in his younger days. &quot;NOW&quot;Ja Hye is Mo-Yong Bi&#x27;s wife. During the fight between Yhun Oh-Rhang, Ghyur Mah-Ro, and Mo-Yong Bi, Ja Hye has lost two of her younger sister who were also Mo-Yong Bi&#x27;s servant/assassin.

==Notes==
* &quot;NOW&quot;is a sequel to an earlier Sung-woo Park manhwa, &quot;Cheollang Yeoljeon&quot; (Legend of the Sirius), which featured Yhun Oh-Rhang and Whur Ha-Rhang, the parents of Yhun Ah-Rin and Ah-Ran. Thus the significance of some characters and story might be lost without reading the prequel.
* This manhwa was formerly distributed in the United States in English by ComicsOne. It was later acquired by Infinity Studios.
* The Sa-Shin-Mu Martial Art is divided to five ways: Cheong-Ryong, Baek-Ho, Hyeon-Mu, Ju-Jak and Hwang-Ryong. In these ways, the Hwang-Ryong is the most powerful. The five ways are based on the Ssu Ling Gods of Chinese mythology: Qing Long, Bai Hu, Xuan Wu, Zhu Que and Huang Long. A disciple only learns it when he can remove his killing aura. The ultimate skills are &quot;Pa-Yeol-Jin&quot; and &quot;Mu-Jin&quot;, &quot;Pa-Yeol-Jin&quot; is the most powerful skill of killing sashinmu, and &quot;Mu-Jin&quot; is the most powerful skill in the complete sashinmu.
* The faction &quot;Myung Wong Shin Gyo&quot; or shortcut to &quot;Myung Gyo&quot; is the cult &quot;Ming Jiao&quot; (明教), a Persian Cult which is called &quot;Mo Jiao&quot; (魔教, Demonic Cult) by the Chinese martial artists. The story of this faction is told in Jin Yong&#x27;s novel Yi Tian Tu Long Ji (the tale about Yitian-jian, the heavenly sword, and Tulong-dao, the dragon saber).
* If you read the manhwa carefully, you will notice the names of Myung Gyo&#x27;s members are based on the names in Hindu mythology. Examples are Shiva, Nirvana, Ganesha, Lakshmi, Rakshasha, Akni, Hanuman, Baraha, Asura, etc.

<text>Jacques Rouxel (26 February 1931 – 25 April 2004), born in Cherbourg, France, was a film animator. Rouxel is perhaps best known for his initially controversial animated French TV series &quot;Les Shadoks&quot;, which first appeared in 1968.

Rouxel graduated from the Lycée Français de New York in 1946 and obtained a business degree from the HEC Paris.

He worked on the prototype of a special machine, the &quot;Animographe&quot;, especially designed to accelerate the production of animated TV series.

<doc id="1264869" wikidata="Q411629" url="?curid=1264869" title="Albendazole">
<text>Albendazole is a broad-spectrum antihelmintic and antiprotozoal agent of the benzimidazole type. It is used for the treatment of a variety of intestinal parasite infections, including ascariasis, pinworm infection, hookworm infection, trichuriasis, strongyloidiasis, taeniasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, cutaneous larva migrans, giardiasis, and gnathostomiasis, among other diseases.
Common side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. Rare but potentially serious side effects include bone marrow suppression which usually improves on discontinuing the medication. Liver inflammation has been reported and those with prior liver problems are at greater risk. It is pregnancy category D in Australia, meaning it may cause harm if taken by pregnant women.
Albendazole was developed in 1975. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Albendazole is available in a fixed-dose combination with ivermectin.

==Medical uses==
Albendazole is an effective treatment for:
* Flatworms
** Clonorchiasis
** Fasciolosis
** Opisthorchiasis
** Cestodes (tapeworms), as an alternative to praziquantel or niclosamide for adult beef tapeworms and as an alternative to praziquantel for pork tapeworms. It is also given for infections by &quot;T. crassiceps&quot;. Though praziquantel is often better at treating tapeworm infections, albendazole is used more often in endemic countries due to being cheaper and having a broader spectrum.
*** Cysticercosis (especially neurocysticercosis), which is caused by the larval form of the pork tapeworm (i.e. albendazole is the drug of choice for larval pork tapeworms, but not adult pork tapeworms). Old cysts are not affected.
*** Echinococcosis of the liver, lung, and peritoneum (caused by the larval form of the dog tapeworm, or of the alveoli (caused by &quot;E. multilocularis&quot;) when surgical excision is not possible. Alveolar and cystic echinococcosis may require lifelong treatment with albendazole, which only prevents the parasites from growing and reproducing rather than killing them.
* Nematodes
** Anatrichosomiasis
** Angiostrongyliasis
** Anisakiasis
** Ascariasis, which can be cured with a single dose of albendazole.
** Baylisascariasis, caused by the raccoon roundworm. Albendazole can achieve good results (95–100% efficacy after a 10-day course of treatment) if treatment is initiated within 72 hours of ingestion of the egg-containing raccoon feces. Corticosteroids are sometimes added in cases of eye and CNS infections.
** Pinworm infection
** Filariasis; since albendazole&#x27;s disintegration of the microfilariae (&quot;pre-larva&quot;) can cause an allergic reaction, antihistamines or corticosteroids are sometimes added to treatment. In cases of lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) caused by &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot; or &quot;Brugia malayi&quot;, albendazole is sometimes given as an adjunct to ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine in order to suppress microfilaremia. It can also be given for &quot;Loa loa&quot; filariasis as an adjunct or replacement to diethylcarbamazine. Albendazole has an embryotoxic effect on &quot;Loa loa&quot; adults and thus slowly reduces microfilaremia.
** Gnathostomiasis when caused by &quot;Gnathostoma spinigerum.&quot; Albendazole has a similar effectiveness to ivermectin in these cases, though it needs to be given for 21 days rather than the 2 days needed for ivermectin.
** Gongylonemiasis
** Hepatic capillariasis caused by &quot;Capillaria hepatica&quot;
** Hookworm infections, including cutaneous larva migrans caused by hookworms of genus &quot;Ancylostoma&quot;. A single dose of albendazole is sufficient to treat intestinal infestations by &quot;A. duodenale&quot; or &quot;Necator americanus&quot;.
** Intestinal capillariasis, as an alternative to mebendazole
** Mansonelliasis when caused by &quot;Mansonella perstans&quot;. Albendazole is effective against adult worms but not against the immature microfilariae.
** Oesophagostomumiasis, when caused by &quot;Oesophagostomum bifurcum&quot;
** Strongyloidiasis, as an alternative to ivermectin or thiabendazole. Albendazole can be given with diethylcarbamazine to lower microfilaremia levels.
** Toxocariasis, also called &quot;visceral larva migrans&quot;, when caused by the dog roundworm &quot;Toxocara canis&quot; or cat roundworm &quot;T. catis&quot;. Corticosteroids can be added in severe cases, and surgery might be required to repair secondary damage.
** Trichinosis, when caused by &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot; or &quot;T. pseudospiralis&quot;. Albendazole has a similar efficacy to thiabendazole, but fewer side effects. It works best when given early, acting on the adult worms in the intestine before they generate larva that can penetrate the muscle and cause a more widespread infection. Corticosteroids are sometimes added on to prevent inflammation caused by dying larva.
** Trichostrongyliasis, as an alternative to pyrantel pamoate. A single dose is sufficient for treatment.
** Trichuriasis (whipworm infection), sometimes considered as an alternative to mebendazole and sometimes considered to be the drug of choice. Only a single dose of albendazole is needed. It can also be given with ivermectin.
* Giardiasis, as an alternative or adjunct to metronidazole, especially in children
* Microsporidiosis, including ocular microsporidiosis caused by &quot;Encephalitozoon hellem&quot; or &quot;E. cuniculi&quot;, when combined with topical fumagillin
* Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, when caused by the amoeba &quot;Balamuthia mandrillaris&quot;, in combination with miltefosine and fluconazole
* Arthropods
** Crusted scabies, when combined with topical crotamiton and salicylic acid
** Head lice infestation, though ivermectin is much better
** Intestinal myiasis

Though albendazole is effective in treating many diseases, it is only FDA-approved for treating hydatid disease caused by dog tapeworm larvae and neurocysticercosis caused by pork tapeworm larvae.

=== Ivermectin/albendazole ===
When co-administered, ivermectin and albendazole act in synergy. Ivermectin targets the parasite&#x27;s nervous and muscular systems, causing paralysis, while albendazole disrupts the parasite&#x27;s metabolism and energy production. This dual approach immobilizes and kills the parasite and improves the treatment&#x27;s effectiveness.

In January 2025, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive scientific opinion for ivermectin/albendazole for the treatment of infections caused by several types of worm parasites including lymphatic filariasis, a neglected tropical disease. Ivermectin/albendazole is indicated for use in people aged five years of age or older, for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminth infections, caused by different types of intestinal parasitic worms, which are spread through soil contaminated by human feces in areas with poor sanitation. Among the worms responsible for these diseases are hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus), roundworms (&quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;), whipworms (&quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot;) and a roundworm called &quot;Strongyloides stercoralis&quot;. Ivermectin/albendazole is also indicated for the treatment of microfilaraemia (the presence of worm larvae in the blood) in people with lymphatic filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease commonly known as elephantiasis, which impairs the lymphatic system and can lead to the abnormal enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability and social stigma. Ivermectin/albendazole is indicated for the treatment of cases of lymphatic filariasis caused by &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot;, a parasite which is responsible for 90% of cases worldwide.

==Contraindications==
Hypersensitivity to the benzimidazole class of compounds contraindicates its use.

==Side effects==

The most common side effects of albendazole are experienced by over 10% of people and include headache and abnormal liver function. Elevation of liver enzymes occurs in 16% of patients receiving treatment specifically for hydatid disease and goes away when treatment ends. Liver enzymes usually increase to two to four times the normal levels (a mild to moderate increase). An estimated 1–10% of people experience abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, dizziness or vertigo, increased intracranial pressure, meningeal signs, temporary hair loss, and fever. The headache, nausea, and vomiting are thought to be caused by the sudden destruction of cysticerci (tapeworm larvae), which causes acute inflammation. Fewer than 1% of people get hypersensitivity reactions such as rashes and hives, leukopenias (drop in white blood cell levels) such as agranulocytosis and granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia (reduced platelet count), pancytopenia (drop in white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets), hepatitis, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, irreversible bone marrow suppression, and aplastic anemia.

Side effects can be different when treating for hydatid disease versus neurocysticercosis: for example, those being treated for the former are more likely to experience elevated liver enzymes and abdominal pain, while those being treated for the latter are more likely to experience headache. Treating hydatid disease can also unmask undiagnosed neurocysticercosis. People receiving albendazole for the treatment of neurocysticercosis can have neurological side effects such as seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and focal signs caused by the inflammatory reaction that occurs when parasites in the brain are killed. Steroids and anticonvulsants are often given with albendazole when treating neurocysticercosis to avoid these effects. Those being treated for retinal neurocysticercosis can face retinal damage if they are not first checked for ocular cysticeri, since changes to existing lesions in the eye by albendazole can cause permanent blindness.

===Pregnancy===
Albendazole is a pregnancy class D drug in Australia. It is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy, and should be avoided up to one month before conception. While studies in pregnant rats and rabbits have shown albendazole to be teratogenic, albendazole has been found to be safe in humans during the second and third trimesters. It can, however, possibly cause infantile eczema when given during pregnancy.

In pregnant dogs, albendazole use has led to puppies with reduced weight and with cleft palates. Birds have lower rates of laying eggs and hatching when given albendazole.

Albendazole sulfoxide is secreted into breast milk at around 1.5% of the maternal dose, though oral absorption is poor enough that it is unlikely to affect nursing infants.

==Overdose==
Because of its low solubility, albendazole often cannot be absorbed in high enough quantities to be toxic. The oral LD50 of albendazole in rats was found to be 2,500 mg/kg. It takes 20 times the normal dose to kill a sheep, and 30 times the normal dose to kill cattle. Overdose affects the liver, testicles, and gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) the most. It can manifest with lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal cramps, dizziness, convulsions, and sleepiness. There is no specified antidote.

== Interactions ==

The antiepileptics carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital lower the plasma concentration and half-life of albendazole sulfoxide&#x27;s R(+) enantiomer.

The antacid cimetidine heightens serum albendazole concentrations, increases the half-life of albendazole, and doubles albendazole sulfoxide levels in bile. It was originally thought to work by increasing albendazole bioavailability directly; however, it is now known that cimetidine inhibits the breakdown of albendazole sulfoxide by interfering with CYP3A4. The half-life of albendazole sulfoxide thus increases from 7.4 hours to 19 hours. This might be a helpful interaction on more severe cases, because it boosts the potency of albendazole. Paradoxically, cimetidine also inhibits the absorption of albendazole by reducing gastric acidity.

Several other interactions exist. Corticosteroids increase the steady-state plasma concentration of albendazole sulfoxide; dexamethasone, for example, can increase the concentration by 56% by inhibiting the elimination of albendazole sulfoxide. The anti-parasitic praziquantel increases the maximum plasma concentration of albendazole sulfoxide by 50%, and the anti-parasitic levamisole increases the AUC (total drug exposure) by 75%. Grapefruit inhibits the metabolism of albendazole within the intestinal mucosa. Finally, long-term administration of the antiretroviral ritonavir, which works as a CYP3A4 inhibitor, decreases the maximum concentration of albendazole in the plasma as well as the AUC.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===

As a vermicide, albendazole causes degenerative alterations in the intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of β-tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules (it binds much better to the β-tubulin of parasites than that of mammals). Albendazole leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Albendazole also prevents the formation of spindle fibers needed for cell division, which in turn blocks egg production and development; existing eggs are prevented from hatching. Cell motility, maintenance of cell shape, and intracellular transport are also disrupted. At higher concentrations, it disrupts the helminths&#x27; metabolic pathways by inhibiting metabolic enzymes such as malate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, with inhibition of the latter leading to less energy produced by the Krebs cycle. Due to diminished ATP production, the parasite is immobilized and eventually dies.

Some parasites have evolved some resistance to albendazole by having a different set of amino acids constitute β-tubulin, decreasing the binding affinity of albendazole. Some parasites (especially filarial nematodes) live in symbiosis with &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, a type of intracellular parasite bacteria. In such cases the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; are necessary to the survival of the parasitic worms. Elimination of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; from these filarial nematodes generally results in either death or sterility of the host nematode.

===Pharmacokinetics===
To target intestinal parasites, which is the most common indication for prescription, albendazole is taken on an empty stomach to stay within the gut.

Oral absorption of albendazole varies among species, with 1–5% of the drug being successfully absorbed in humans, 20–30% in rats, and 50% in cattle.

The absorption also largely depends on gastric pH. People have varying levels of gastric pHs on empty stomachs, and thus absorption from one person to another can vary wildly when taken without food. Generally, the absorption in the GI tract is poor due to albendazole&#x27;s low solubility in water. It is, however, better absorbed than other benzimidazole carbamates. Food stimulates gastric acid secretion, lowering the pH and making albendazole more soluble and thus more easily absorbed. Oral absorption is especially increased with a fatty meal, as albendazole dissolves better in lipids, allowing it to cross the lipid barrier created by the mucus surface of the GI tract.

Absorption is also affected by how much of the albendazole is degraded within the small intestine by metabolic enzymes in the villi.

The pharmacokinetics of albendazole differ slightly between men and women: women have a lower oral clearance and volume of distribution, while men have a lower serum peak concentration.

Albendazole undergoes very fast first-pass metabolism in all species, such that the unchanged drug is undetectable in plasma. Most of it is oxidized into albendazole sulfoxide (also known as &quot;ricobendazole&quot; and &quot;albendazole oxide&quot;) in the liver by cytochrome P450 oxidases (CYPs) and a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), which was discovered later. In humans, the cytochrome P450 oxidases are thought to include CYP3A4 and CYP1A1, while those in the rats are thought to be CYP2C6 and CYP2A1.

Oxidation to albendazole sulfoxide by FMO produces R(+) enantiomers, while oxidation the cytochromes and by some enzymes in the gut epithelium produce S(−). Different species produce the R(+) and S(−) enantiomers in different quantities; humans, dogs, and most other species produce the R(+) enantiomer more (with the human AUC ratio being 80:20). Compared to the S(−) enantiomer, the R(+) has greater pharmacological activity, lasts longer in the bloodstream, is found in higher concentrations in the infected host tissues, and is found in higher concentrations within the parasites themselves. Some albendazole is also converted to hydroxyalbendazole, mainly by CYP2J2.

For systemic parasites, albendazole acts as a prodrug, while albendazole sulfoxide reaches systemic circulation and acts as the real antihelminthic. Albendazole sulfoxide is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the cerebrospinal fluid at 43% of plasma concentrations; its ability to enter the central nervous system allows it to treat neurocysticercosis.

Albendazole sulfoxide is converted to the inactive albendazole sulfone by cytochrome P450 oxidases, thought to include CYP3A4 or CYP2C. Other inactive metabolites include: 2-aminosulfone, ω-hydroxysulfone, and β-hydroxysulfone. The major final metabolites that are excreted by humans are:
* methyl [5-(propylsulfonyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)] carbamate,
* methyl [6-hydroxy 5-(n-propylsulfonyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)] carbamate,
* methyl [5-(n-propylsulfinyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)] carbamate,
* 5-(n-propylsulfonyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl amine, and
* 5-(n-propysulfinyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl amine.
There are also some minor hydroxylated sulfated or glucuronidated derivatives. No unchanged albendazole is excreted, as it is metabolized too quickly.

In humans, the metabolites are excreted mostly in bile, with only a small amount being excreted in urine (less than 1%) and feces. In ruminants, 60–70% of the metabolites are excreted in urine.

Like all benzimidazoles, albendazole has no residual effect, and thus protects poorly against reinfestations.

==History==
Albendazole, patented in 1975, was invented by Robert J. Gyurik and Vassilios J. Theodorides and assigned to SmithKline Corporation. It was introduced in 1977 as an antihelminthic for sheep in Australia, and was registered for human use in 1982.

==Society and culture==
===Economics===
The pharmaceutical company Amedra increased the price after purchasing the rights to the drug, instead of lowering it as generics are predicted to do, drawing criticism from patients&#x27; rights advocates.

In 2013, GlaxoSmithKline donated 763 million albendazole tablets for the treatment and prevention of parasitic infections in developing countries, bringing the total to over 4 billion tablets donated since 1998.

===Brand names===
Brand names include: Albenza, Alworm, Andazol, Eskazole, Noworm, Zentel, Alben-G, ABZ, Cidazole, Wormnil etc.

==Research==
Albendazole and related compounds or metabolites like albendazole sulfone (ALB-SO2) exhibit antibacterial effects via an unknown, possibly FtsZ-related, mechanism. It inhibits division of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; and &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, turning them into a long &quot;filament&quot; shape as they grow and fail to divide. Since &quot;Brugia malayi&quot; relies on symbiotic &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, this would mean that albendazole is targeting both the worm and its essential symbioant.

==Veterinary use==
Albendazole is mainly used in cattle and sheep, but has found some use in cats and dogs as well; it is also used in ratite birds for flagellate parasites and tapeworms. It is also used off-label to treat endoparasites in goats and pigs.

Albendazole has been used as an antihelminthic and for control of flukes in a variety of animal species, including cattle, sheep, goats, swine, camels, dogs, cats, elephants, poultry, and others. Side effects include anorexia in dogs and lethargy, depression, and anorexia in cats, with more than 10% of dogs and cats having anorexia. Of dogs and cats, 1–10% experience elevated liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Less than 1% experience neutropenia or aplastic anemia, though these require a use of at least 5 days. While it is also associated with bone marrow suppression and toxicity in cats and dogs at high doses, albendazole has a higher margin of safety in other species. Thus, it is usually only prescribed in cats and dogs when an infection is present that is resistant to the commonly prescribed metronidazole and fenbendazole.

It is extensively used for ruminant livestock in Latin America. It is marketed for this purpose by Zoetis (formerly Pfizer Animal Health) in numerous countries (including the United States and Canada) as Valbazen in oral suspension and paste formulations; by Interchemie in the Netherlands and elsewhere as Albenol-100; by Channelle Animal Health Ltd. in the United Kingdom as Albex; and by Ravensdown in New Zealand (as Albendazole). Although most formulations are administered orally, Ricomax (ricobendazole, or albendazole sulfoxide) is administered by subcutaneous injection.

Albendazole has greater bioavailability in ruminants: some albendazole sulfoxide, when released back into the rumen, is reduced to albendazole by the resident microbiota, with a preference of the (+) enantiomer being the substrate. Cats and dogs, having no rumen reservoir, sometimes need higher or more frequent doses as compared to ruminants. In dogs, albendazole sulfoxide is detectable in the plasma for less than 12 hours, but in sheep and goats, it remains at measurable levels for around three days.

===Meat===

The limitations in early pregnancy are due to a limited period during which teratogenic effects may occur. Summarized research data relating to the durations of these preslaughter and early pregnancy periods when albendazole should not be administered are found in US FDA NADA 110-048 (cattle) and 140-934 (sheep). Some data and inferences regarding goats are found in US FDA Supplemental NADA 110-048 (approved 24 January 2008).

Maximum residue limits (MRLs) for albendazole in food, adopted by the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius in 1993, are 5000, 5000, 100, and 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight (μg/kg) for kidney, liver, fat, and muscle, respectively, and 100 μg/L for milk. For analysis purposes, MRLs of various nations may pertain to concentration of a marker substance which has been correlated with concentrations of the administered substance and its metabolized products. For example, in Canada, the marker substance specified by Health Canada is albendazole-2-aminosulfone, for which the MRL in liver of cattle is 200&quot; &quot;μg/kg.

There is a 27-day cattle withdrawal time for meat.

<text>Grayson Hall (born Shirley Grossman; September 18, 1922 – August 7, 1985) was an American television, film and stage actress. She was widely regarded for her avant-garde theatrical performances from the 1960s to the 1980s. Hall was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and a Golden Globe Award for the John Huston film &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964).

Hall played multiple prominent roles on the gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (1966–71) and appeared on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1982–83). In 2006, a biography titled &quot;Grayson Hall: A Hard Act to Follow&quot; was released.

==Early life==
Hall was born Shirley Grossman in Philadelphia in 1922, the only child of Eleanor and Joseph Grossman. Her father was from Latvia and her mother, who had acted in the Yiddish theatre, was from South Africa. Both were from Jewish immigrant families.

When Hall was eight, her parents separated, but they never divorced. Hall became interested in acting as an escape from a painful childhood, and auditioned for plays in New York City while still attending Simon Gratz High School in North Philadelphia. She enrolled at Temple University but did not matriculate. She landed her first professional job with a summer stock company on Long Island in 1942.

In 1946, she married fellow actor Ted Brooks in Philadelphia. They separated in 1949 and she returned to New York. In 1952, she married writer Sam Hall. Their son Matthew was born in 1958. She had always used the stage name Shirley Grayson, but Sam Hall called her Grayson &quot;like an old Army buddy,&quot; as she said in an interview. She eventually adopted Grayson Hall as her professional name.

==Career==
Hall enjoyed an active stage career in New York City. Her theater credits include roles in off-Broadway productions of influential avant-garde plays including &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; by Luigi Pirandello (Phoenix Theatre, 1955). She also appeared as the madam Irma in the first New York production of &quot;The Balcony&quot; by Jean Genet for more than a year at the Circle in the Square Theatre Downtown in Greenwich Village.

Having guest-starred on various television programs during the mid-1950s, Hall made her film debut in 1961 in &quot;Run Across the River&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Satan in High Heels&quot; as a cabaret club owner, but she later disavowed the film.

In September 1963, Hall traveled to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico to play the role of Judith Fellowes in John Huston&#x27;s film version of &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot;, based on the original play by Tennessee Williams. She was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Supporting Actress for her performance.

Hall portrayed a kidnapped bank teller in Walt Disney Productions&#x27; &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; in 1965. She appeared on an episode of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; in 1967.

===&quot;Dark Shadows&quot;===
Hall&#x27;s best-known television role was as Dr. Julia Hoffman on &quot;Dark Shadows. S&quot;he portrayed the loyal confidant and friend of the vampire Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid). Other key roles that she played on the show were those of Countess Natalie Dupres; Magda Rakosi, a Gypsy; Hoffman, a Mrs. Danvers–type housekeeper; Julia Collins; and Constance Collins, sister of Brutus Collins. She also appeared in both &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; feature films: in &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; again as Dr. Julia Hoffman, and in &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; as a new character, housekeeper Carlotta Drake.

===Later career===
After &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; ended, Hall portrayed reporter Marge Grey on &quot;All My Children&quot; for a short period in 1973. She continued acting on stage in Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;The Screens&quot; (1971–72) and in &quot;Happy End&quot; (1977) with Meryl Streep and Christopher Lloyd.

In the 1970s, Hall appeared on several television films, including &quot;Gargoyles&quot; (ABC), filmed in New Mexico with Cornel Wilde, and the Dan Curtis television film &quot;The Great Ice Rip-Off&quot; (ABC) with Lee J. Cobb and Gig Young. She starred in the mystery film &quot;The Two Deaths of Sean Doolittle&quot; (ABC), which was written by her husband Sam Hall.

Hall appeared in the Broadway premiere of &quot;The Suicide&quot; (1980) with Derek Jacobi and appeared opposite Geraldine Page, Carrie Nye and Madeleine Sherwood in an off-Broadway revival of &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;.

Her last onscreen role was as Euphemia Ralston (Delila&#x27;s scheming mother) on the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from July 1982 until April 1983.

==Death==
After a six-month battle with lung cancer, Hall died at New York Hospital in Manhattan in 1985 at the age of 62, only six weeks before her 63rd birthday. A simple marker near her Rhinebeck, New York home reads &quot;Grayson Hall — August 7, 1985.&quot;

<text>Osler&#x27;s nodes are painful, red, raised lesions found typically on the hands and feet. They are associated with a number of conditions, including infective endocarditis, and are caused by immune complex deposition. Their presence is one definition of Osler&#x27;s sign.
==Causes==
Osler&#x27;s nodes result from the deposition of immune complexes. The resulting inflammatory response leads to swelling, redness, and pain that characterize these lesions.

The nodes are commonly indicative of subacute bacterial endocarditis. 10–25% of endocarditis patients will have Osler&#x27;s nodes. Other signs of endocarditis include Roth&#x27;s spots and Janeway lesions. The latter, which also occur on the palms and soles, can be differentiated from Osler&#x27;s nodes because they are non-tender.

Osler&#x27;s nodes can also be seen in
* Systemic lupus erythematosus
* Marantic endocarditis
* Disseminated gonococcal infection
* Distal to infected arterial catheter

==Etymology==
Osler&#x27;s nodes are named after Sir William Osler who described them in the early twentieth century. He described them as &quot;ephemeral spots of a painful nodular erythema, chiefly in the skin of the hands and feet.&quot;

<text>The Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS) was a reaction control system used in Earth orbit by the Project Gemini spacecraft. It provided both automatic and manual rotation and translation by means of 16 vernier thrusters using hypergolic propellants.

==Operations==
The OAMS had 16 small, fixed-position, fixed-thrust rocket engines which burned hypergolic propellants (monomethylhydrazine fuel using nitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer) fed under pressure from a pair of tanks located in the aft Equipment Module. 
Besides providing attitude control, the OAMS provided for linear up, down, sideways, forward or aft translation of the spacecraft. This gave the spacecraft the capability to change its orbit, required for space rendezvous and docking with another spacecraft, the Agena Target Vehicle.
The system was also used to push the spacecraft away from the spent second stage of the Titan II launch vehicle on first reaching orbit.

*The eight rotational control engines were mounted off the spacecraft&#x27;s center of mass around the aft section of the Equipment Module, pointed at 90 degree positions up, down, left and right. These were rated at thrust and fired in pairs, causing it to yaw, pitch, or roll to control attitude.
*Six of the translational control engines were mounted on the side of the Retrorocket Module, near the spacecraft&#x27;s center of mass. Four of these were rated at thrust, one each pointed up, down, left or right. The other two were pointed forward, at the three o&#x27;clock and nine o&#x27;clock positions, to provide aft thrust. These were rated at (reduced from the original spec of in July 1962).
*The two thrust forward translation control engines were mounted on the inside of the aft end of the equipment adapter, at the twelve o&#x27;clock and six o&#x27;clock positions.

Project Mercury astronauts could only adjust yaw, pitch, or roll, but Gemini crewmen had full manual control over their flight path. Walter Schirra said that on Gemini 6 &quot;I was amazed at my ability to maneuver. I did a fly-around inspection of Gemini 7, literally flying rings around it, and I could move to within inches of it in perfect confidence&quot;. Because there is no turbulence in space &quot;It was like the Blue Angels at 18,000 miles per hour, only it was easier&quot;.

==Events==
During Gemini 8, on March 16, 1966, OAMS engine number 8 became stuck on, resulting in uncontrollable spinning of the spacecraft. The entire OAMS had to be shut down and the mission was terminated prematurely. This resulted in modifications to OAMS to permit engine isolation.

<text>Antonio de la Torre García (born November 18, 1977,) is a Mexican-American former soccer defender, who recently played for the Atlanta Silverbacks of the USL First Division. De la Torre holds dual citizenship in Mexico and the United States.

Before joining MLS, de la Torre played most of his career in Mexico&#x27;s Primera A, the second division. He played for Atlante F.C. in the Primera Division.

He joined MLS for the 2004 season, signing with the Colorado Rapids, and immediately impressed with his offensive abilities. Unlike most American defenders, de la Torre was a danger going forward from his right back position, and finished the season with five assists in 28 starts. However, near the end of the season, coach Tim Hankinson grew tired of de la Torre&#x27;s defensive failures, and benched him for the playoffs.

Following the end of the season, de la Torre was exposed for the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft, where he was selected fifth overall by C.D. Chivas USA, but was cut before the season. He signed with Atlanta soon after.

De la Torre&#x27;s father, Antonio de la Torre Villalpando, played in Mexico during the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, and appeared for Mexico during the 1978 World Cup tournament. His uncle, &quot;Chepo&quot;, is the head coach of CD Guadalajara of the Primera División de México, actually he works as a construction worker in Atlanta and RETO

<doc id="1264936" wikidata="Q2916388" url="?curid=1264936" title="Jewish population by country">
<text>the world&#x27;s core Jewish population (those identifying as Jews above all else) was estimated at 15.7 million, which is approximately 0.2% of the 8 billion worldwide population. Israel hosts the largest core Jewry in the world with 7.2 million, followed by the United States with 6.3 million. Other countries with core Jewries above 100,000 include France (440,000), Canada (398,000), the United Kingdom (312,000), Argentina (171,000), Russia (132,000), Germany (125,000), and Australia (117,200). The number of Jews worldwide rises to 18 million with the addition of the &quot;connected&quot; Jewish population, including those who say they are partly Jewish or that have Jewish backgrounds from at least one Jewish parent, and rises again to 21 million with the addition of the &quot;enlarged&quot; Jewish population, including those who say they have Jewish backgrounds but no Jewish parents and all non-Jewish household members who live with Jews. Counting all those who are eligible for Israeli citizenship under Israel&#x27;s Law of Return, in addition to Israeli Jews, raised the total to 25.5 million.

Two countries account for 81% of those recognized as Jews or of sufficient Jewish ancestry to be eligible for citizenship in Israel under its Law of Return: the United States with 51% and Israel with 30%. An additional 16% is split between France (3%), Canada (3%), Russia (3%), UK (2%), Argentina (1%), Germany (1%), Ukraine (1%), Brazil (1%), Australia (1%), and Hungary (1%), while the remaining 3% are spread around approximately 98 other countries and territories with less than 0.5% each. With over 7 million Jews, Israel is the only Jewish-majority country and the only explicitly Judaic country.

In 1939, the core Jewish population reached its historical peak of 16.6 million. Almost half the Jewry of the World lived in the Americas and Poland. Due to the murder of approximately six million Jews during the Holocaust, this number was reduced to 11 million by 1945. The population grew to around 13 million by the 1970s and then recorded almost no growth until around 2005, due to low fertility rates and assimilation of Jews. From 2005 to 2018, the world&#x27;s Jewry grew 0.63% annually on average, while world&#x27;s population overall grew 1.1% annually in the same period. This increase primarily reflected the rapid growth of Haredi and some Orthodox sectors, who remain a growing proportion of Jews.

==Trends==
===Israel===
Recent Jewish population dynamics are characterized by continued steady increase in Israeli Jewry and flat or declining numbers in other countries (the diaspora). Aliyas to Palestine began in earnest following the 1839 Tanzimat reforms; between 1840 and 1880, Palestinian Jewry rose from 9,000 to 23,000. In the late 19th century, 99.7% of the world&#x27;s Jews lived outside the region, with Jews representing 2–5% of the Population of Palestine. Through the first five phases of Aliyah, the Jewish population rose to 630,000 by the rebirth of Israel in 1948. By 2014 this had risen to 6,135,000, while the population of the diaspora has dropped from 10.5 to 8.1 million over the same period. Current Demographics of Israel are characterized by a relatively high fertility rate of 3 children per woman and a stable age distribution. The overall growth rate of Jews in Israel is 1.7% annually. The diaspora countries, by contrast, have low Jewish birth rates, an increasingly elderly age composition, and a negative balance of people leaving Judaism versus converting to Judaism.
Immigration trends also favor Israel ahead of diaspora countries. The Jewish state has a positive immigration balance (called aliyah in Hebrew). Israel saw its Jewish numbers significantly buoyed by a million-strong wave of Aliyah from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s, and immigration growth has been steady (in the low tens of thousands) since then.

===Rest of the world===
In general, the modern English-speaking world has seen an increase in its share of the diaspora since the Holocaust and the foundation of Israel, while historic diaspora Jewish populations in Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East have significantly declined or disappeared.
France continues to be home to the world&#x27;s third largest Jewish community, at around 500,000, but has shown an increasingly negative trend. As a long-term trend, intermarriage has reduced its &quot;core&quot; Jewish population and increased its &quot;connected&quot; and &quot;enlarged&quot; Jewries. More recently, migration loss to Israel amongst French Jews reached the tens of thousands between 2014 and 2017, following a wave of anti-Semitic attacks.
According to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey, over the next four decades the number of Jews around the world is expected to increase from 14.2 million in 2015 to 16.4 million in 2060.

===Debate over American numbers===
The number of Jews in the United States has been much debated because of questions about counting methodology. In 2012, Sheskin and Dashefsky put forward a figure of 6.72 million based on a mixture of local surveys, informed local estimates, and US census data. They qualified their estimate with concern over double counting and suggested the real figure may lie between 6 and 6.4 million. Drawing on their work, the Steinhardt Social Research Institute released their estimate of 6.8 million Jews in the United States in 2013. These figures are in contrast to Israeli demographer Sergio Della Pergola&#x27;s number of 5,425,000, also in 2012. He has called high estimates “implausible” and “unreliable”. However, he revised the United States Jewish number to 5.7 million in subsequent years. This controversy followed a similar debate in 2001 when the National Jewish Population Survey released a United States Jewish estimate as low as 5.2 million only to have serious methodological errors suggested in their survey. In sum, a confidence interval of a million or more people is likely to persist in reporting the number of Jewish Americans.

In 2020, the Pew Research Center&#x27;s Jewish Americans 2020 study estimated there were 5.8 million adult Jews in the United States and 1.8 million children of at least one Jewish parent being raised as Jewish in some way, for a total of 7.5 million Jews, 2.5% of the national population. According to Sergio Della Pergola&#x27;s narrower definition, which count children and adult Jews without religious affiliation only if they have two Jewish parents, this corresponds to 4.8 million Jewish adults and 1.2 million Jewish children in 2020. The American Jewry Project at Brandeis University, which synthesizes survey data from the 50 states and DC, estimates there are 7.63 million American Jews, 6 million adults and 1.6 million children.

==By country==

=== Definition ===
Below is a list of Jewish populations in the world by country. All data below, except the last column, are from the Berman Jewish DataBank at Stanford University in the World Jewish Population (2020) report coordinated by Sergio DellaPergola at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The Jewish DataBank figures are primarily based on national censuses combined with trend analysis:
* &quot;Core Jewish population&quot; refers to those who consider themselves Jews to the exclusion of all else.
* &quot;Connected Jewish population&quot; includes the core Jewish population and additionally those who say they are partly Jewish or that have Jewish background from at least one Jewish parent. 
* &quot;Enlarged Jewish population&quot; includes the Jewish connected population and those who say they have Jewish background but not a Jewish parent, and all non-Jews living in households with Jews. 
* &quot;Eligible Jewish population&quot; includes all those eligible for immigration to Israel under its Law of Return. 
* &quot;National official population&quot; is the Jewish population reported by a national source. Note that the &quot;National&quot; results may not be entirely accurate, as other sources may have conflicting accounts of Jewish populations in some countries.
===Core, connected and enlarged population===

&lt;templatestyles src=&quot;Reflist/styles.css&quot;/&gt;

===Remnant and vanished populations===
The above table represents Jews that number at least a few dozen per country. Reports exist of Jewish communities remaining in other territories in the low single digits that are on the verge of disappearing, including in the Islamic&quot;/&quot;Muslim world, as their reaction to the birth of Israel in 1948 was the persecution of Jews in all Islamic&quot;/&quot;Muslim countries; these are often of historical interest as they represent the remnant of much larger Jewish populations. For example, Egypt had a Jewry of 80,000 in the early 20th century that numbered fewer than 40 as of 2014, mainly because of the forced expulsion movements to Israel and other countries at that time. Despite a 2,000-year history of Jewish presence, there are no longer any known Jews living in Afghanistan, as its last Jewish residents Zebulon Simintov and Tova Moradi, fled the country in September and October 2021, respectively.

In Syria, another ancient Jewish community saw mass exodus at the end of the 20th century and numbered fewer than 20 in the midst of the Syrian Civil War. The size of the Jewish community in Indonesia has been variously given as 65, 100, or 18 at most over the last 50 years. In Yemen due to the ongoing civil war, Yemen&#x27;s Jews have faced persecution by Houthis, who have demanded they convert to Islam or face mandatory expulsion from the country. The Israeli military has conducted operations evacuating the population and moving them to Israel. On 28 March 2021, 13 Jews were forced by the Houthis to leave Yemen, leaving the last four elder Jews in Yemen. According to one report there are six Jews left in Yemen: one woman, her brother, three others, and Levi Salem Marahbi (who had been imprisoned for helping smuggle a Torah scroll out of Yemen).

<doc id="1264949" wikidata="Q73518" url="?curid=1264949" title="Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis">
<text>Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is a form of endocarditis in which small sterile vegetations are deposited on the valve leaflets. Formerly known as marantic endocarditis, which comes from the Greek , meaning &quot;wasting away&quot;. The term &quot;marantic endocarditis&quot; is still sometimes used to emphasize the association with a wasting state such as cancer.

==Risk factors==
Marantic vegetations are often associated with previous rheumatic fever. Other risk factors include:
* hypercoagulable states
* malignant cancers, especially mucin-producing adenocarcinomas (most commonly associated with pancreatic adenocarcinomas)
* systemic lupus erythematosus: Referred to as Libman-Sacks endocarditis
* trauma (e.g., catheters)
* Antiphospholipid syndrome

===Valve predilection===
The disease affects the valves with following predilection: mitral valve &gt; aortic valve &gt; tricuspid valve &gt; pulmonary valve

==Histopathology==
Grossly, vegetations form along lines of valve closure and are generally symmetric with a smooth or verrucoid (warty) texture. Histologically, lesions are composed of fibrin (eosinophilic) and platelets but, unlike bacterial etiologies, contain little evidence of PMNs, microorganisms or inflammation.

==Diagnosis==
Due to the non-invasive nature of NBTE, clinical examination may or may not reveal a new murmur. An embolic stroke may be the first feature to suggest diagnosis of NBTE. An echocardiogram is essential for visualization of the mass.

<doc id="1264968" wikidata="Q356093" url="?curid=1264968" title="Adenosine deaminase">
<text>Adenosine deaminase (also known as adenosine aminohydrolase, or ADA) is an enzyme () involved in purine metabolism. It is needed for the breakdown of adenosine from food and for the turnover of nucleic acids in tissues.

Its primary function in humans is the development and maintenance of the immune system. However, the full physiological role of ADA is not yet completely understood.

== Structure ==

ADA exists in both small form (as a monomer) and large form (as a dimer-complex). In the monomer form, the enzyme is a polypeptide chain, folded into eight strands of parallel α/β barrels, which surround a central deep pocket that is the active site. In addition to the eight central β-barrels and eight peripheral α-helices, ADA also contains five additional helices: residues 19-76 fold into three helices, located between β1 and α1 folds; and two antiparallel carboxy-terminal helices are located across the amino-terminal of the β-barrel.

The ADA active site contains a zinc ion, which is located in the deepest recess of the active site and coordinated by five atoms from His15, His17, His214, Asp295, and the substrate. Zinc is the only cofactor necessary for activity.

The substrate, adenosine, is stabilized and bound to the active site by nine hydrogen bonds. The carboxyl group of Glu217, roughly coplanar with the substrate purine ring, is in position to form a hydrogen bond with N1 of the substrate. The carboxyl group of Asp296, also coplanar with the substrate purine ring, forms hydrogen bond with N7 of the substrate. The NH group of Gly184 is in position to form a hydrogen bond with N3 of the substrate. Asp296 forms bonds both with the Zn2+ ion as well as with 6-OH of the substrate. His238 also hydrogen bonds to substrate 6-OH. The 3&#x27;-OH of the substrate ribose forms a hydrogen bond with Asp19, while the 5&#x27;-OH forms a hydrogen bond with His17. Two further hydrogen bonds are formed to water molecules, at the opening of the active site, by the 2&#x27;-OH and 3&#x27;-OH of the substrate.

Due to the recessing of the active site inside the enzyme, the substrate, once bound, is almost completely sequestered from solvent. The surface exposure of the substrate to solvent when bound is 0.5% the surface exposure of the substrate in the free state.

== Reactions ==

ADA irreversibly deaminates adenosine, converting it to the related nucleoside inosine by the substitution of the amino group by a keto group.


Inosine can then be deribosylated (removed from ribose) by another enzyme called purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), converting it to hypoxanthine.

== Mechanism of catalysis ==

The proposed mechanism for ADA-catalyzed deamination is stereospecific addition-elimination via tetrahedral intermediate. By either mechanism, Zn2+ as a strong electrophile activates a water molecule, which is deprotonated by the basic Asp295 to form the attacking hydroxide. His238 orients the water molecule and stabilizes the charge of the attacking hydroxide. Glu217 is protonated to donate a proton to N1 of the substrate.

The reaction is stereospecific due to the location of the zinc, Asp295, and His238 residues, which all face the B-side of the purine ring of the substrate.

Competitive inhibition has been observed for ADA, where the product inosine acts at the competitive inhibitor to enzymatic activity.

== Function ==

ADA is considered one of the key enzymes of purine metabolism. The enzyme has been found in bacteria, plants, invertebrates, vertebrates, and mammals, with high conservation of amino acid sequence. The high degree of amino acid sequence conservation suggests the crucial nature of ADA in the purine salvage pathway.

Primarily, ADA in humans is involved in the development and maintenance of the immune system. However, ADA association has also been observed with epithelial cell differentiation, neurotransmission, and gestation maintenance. It has also been proposed that ADA, in addition to adenosine breakdown, stimulates release of excitatory amino acids and is necessary to the coupling of A1 adenosine receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins. Adenosine deaminase deficiency leads to pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that chronic exposure to high levels of adenosine can exacerbate inflammation responses rather than suppressing them. It has also been recognized that AMP deaminase protein and activity is upregulated in mouse hearts that overexpress HIF-1α, which in part explains the attenuated levels of adenosine in HIF-1α expressing hearts during ischemic stress.

In meiotic and post-meiotic male germ cells ADA2 regulates heterochromatin via translation of the MDC1 gene.

== Pathology ==

Some mutations in the gene for adenosine deaminase cause it not to be expressed. The resulting deficiency is one cause of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), particularly of autosomal recessive inheritance. Deficient levels of ADA have also been associated with pulmonary inflammation, thymic cell death, and defective T-cell receptor signaling.

Conversely, mutations causing this enzyme to be overexpressed are one cause of hemolytic anemia.

There is some evidence that a different allele (ADA2) may lead to autism.

Elevated levels of ADA has also been associated with AIDS.

== Isoforms ==

There are two isoforms of ADA: ADA1 and ADA2.

* ADA1 is found in most body cells, particularly lymphocytes and macrophages, where it is present not only in the cytosol and nucleus but also as the ecto- form on the cell membrane attached to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (aka, CD26). ADA1 is involved mostly in intracellular activity, and exists both in small form (monomer) and large form (dimer). The interconversion of small to large forms is regulated by a &#x27;conversion factor&#x27; in the lung.
* ADA2 was first identified in human spleen. It was subsequently found in other tissues including the macrophage where it co-exists with ADA1. The two isoforms regulate the ratio of adenosine to deoxyadenosine potentiating the killing of parasites. ADA2 is found predominantly in the human plasma and serum, and exists solely as a homodimer.

== Clinical significance ==

ADA2 is the predominant form present in human blood plasma and is increased in many diseases, particularly those associated with the immune system: for example rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and sarcoidosis. The plasma ADA2 isoform is also increased in most cancers. ADA2 is not ubiquitous but co-exists with ADA1 only in monocytes-macrophages.

Total plasma ADA can be measured using high performance liquid chromatography or enzymatic or colorimetric techniques. Perhaps the simplest system is the measurement of the ammonia released from adenosine when broken down to inosine. After incubation of plasma with a buffered solution of adenosine the ammonia is reacted with a Berthelot reagent to form a blue colour which is proportionate to the amount of enzyme activity. To measure ADA2, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA) is added prior to incubation so as to inhibit the enzymatic activity of ADA1. It is the absence of ADA1 that causes SCID.

ADA can also be used in the workup of lymphocytic pleural effusions or peritoneal ascites, in that such specimens with low ADA levels essentially excludes tuberculosis from consideration.

Tuberculosis pleural effusions can now be diagnosed accurately by increased levels of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase, above 40 U per liter.

Cladribine and Pentostatin are anti-neoplastic agents used in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia; their mechanism of action is inhibition of adenosine deaminase.

<text>James Franklin Hanly (April 4, 1863August 1, 1920) was an American politician who served as a congressman from Indiana from 1895 until 1897, and was the 26th governor of Indiana from 1905 to 1909. He was the founder of Hanly&#x27;s Flying Squadron, which advocated prohibition nationally and played an important role in arousing public support for prohibition.

During his term as governor he successfully advocated the passage of a local-option liquor law, which led the majority of Indiana&#x27;s counties to ban liquor sales. His other achievements included banning gambling, fighting political corruption, and adjusting state agencies to operate on a non-partisan basis. He left office and the Republican Party and became an active and vocal prohibitionist. He was an unsuccessful Prohibition Party candidate for President of the United States in the 1916 election.

==Early life==
Hanly was born in a log cabin near St. Joseph, Illinois on April 4, 1863, the youngest of the seven children of Elijah and Anna Calton Hanly. His mother taught him to read at home, even though she was blind. As a young man he lived for a while on a farm in the nearby village of Homer. In Homer he attended the Liberty rural school for one year where he became known as a formidable debater. At age sixteen he left home to attend the common schools and the Eastern Illinois Normal School at Charleston, Illinois, until 1879. He worked odd jobs to pay for his schooling, and often slept in barns. That year he graduated he moved to Warren County, Indiana where he taught in the state public schools from 1881 to 1889.

He met Eva Augusta Rachel Simmer and the couple married in 1881. Together, they had five children, but only one survived childhood. While teaching he became friends with a local judge, Joseph M. Rabb. Rabb encouraged Hanly to take an active part in politics and stump in behalf of Republicans. Hanly studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1889, joining Rabb&#x27;s law office in Williamsport, Indiana. Hanly practiced law with Ele Stansbury, a young lawyer who would later serve as Indiana Attorney General.

==Political career==

===Early campaigns===
He was elected as a member of the Indiana State Senate in an 1889 special election to fill and empty state senate seat, defeating George W. Cronk, and served there from 1890 until 1891. In the senate he gained a reputation for vigorous oration.

=== Congress ===
He ran as a Republican and won election to the Fifty-fourth Congress, serving from March 4, 1895 to March 3, 1897. During his term his district was realigned by the Democratic controlled Indiana General Assembly, who created a gerrymander of his district causing him to lose his re-election in 1896.

=== U.S. Senate campaign ===
He launched a campaign for Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in 1899, but was defeated in the Republican legislature vote by Albert J. Beveridge. The election caused a major division in the state party, and progressive anti-prohibition candidates supported Beveridge, while the prohibition and conservative wing of the party supported Hanly. After losing the nomination, he briefly retired from politics. The split worsened following the election, leading progressives to split from the Republican party. Hanly went on a speaking tour around the state to build up support for another run for office. His speeches were fiery and often quoted Abraham Lincoln.

===Governor===

Hanly reentered politics in 1904, and won the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana. Hanly was elected Governor of Indiana, defeating John W. Kern by 84,364 votes. The election was hard-fought by Hanly, who delivered excoriating speeches against the Democratic party which he referred to as &quot;unholy&quot;, and &quot;great only its ability to destroy.&quot; He called their election campaign &quot;selfish&quot; and said they ran it only so they could &quot;obtain the flesh pot of office.&quot; Hanly was considered a party maverick and he pushed his own agenda, rather than his party&#x27;s platform, once in office. He pushed for what he considered major state reforms, accomplishing many of them. He crusaded against liquor, horse-racing and political corruption, even prosecuting members of his own administration for embezzlement.

Using his popularity, he was able to have the Republican-controlled General Assembly pass legislation to ban gambling on horse races in the state and at the Indiana State Fair. He successfully reorganized most of the state government in an attempt to make the government bureaus non-partisan. He was able to successfully achieve his goal among the state&#x27;s law enforcement, correctional facilities, and state-run charities. He also brought considerable improvement to the state&#x27;s accounting methods. He required detailed expense reports to be created by all state employees seeking reimbursements, began regular audits of all spending, and with the support of the state treasurer, he began to establish new accounts by which the government could better monitor where funds were being spent, and by whom.

In 1907, he signed the Compulsory Sterilization Law, which mandated the sterilization of certain individuals in state custody, making Indiana the first state to adopt eugenics legislation. The legislation was part of the progressive agenda and received broad support at the time. Governor Thomas R. Marshall later ordered the practice stopped in 1909. In 1921, the Indiana Supreme Court found the law unconstitutional.

A major scandal broke shortly after he entered office, when it was found the public officials had been using their expense accounts to pay for gambling debts at the French Lick Springs Hotel, owned by the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Thomas Taggart. Hanly harangued Taggart for breaking the law by establishing a &quot;Monte Carlo.&quot; In July 1906 he ordered the state police to raid French Lick and West Baden, and seized several slot machines, roulette wheels, poker sets, playing cards, Klondike tables, gambling records, dice, and a whole host of other gambling implements. He brought suit against the corporations operating the French Lick Springs Hotel and the West Baden Springs Hotel seeking to seize their properties for profiting from illegal activities. John Kerns, who Hanly defeated for governor in 1904, represented the hotels. The case dragged on until after Hanly left office. In 1910 an Orange County jury ruled in favor of the hotels.

Hanly was most concerned about temperance and was known to support a ban on liquor. His stated reason for supporting prohibition was the effect that alcoholics had on their children. He championed a bill that would allow counties to ban the sale of alcohol. The General Assembly had failed to pass the bill during their two normal sessions during his terms, so he called a special session in 1908 to have the body take up debate of the propose bill, which they passed. Once enacted, 72 of Indiana&#x27;s 92 counties went dry, banning the sale of all liquors. The timing of the passage of the bill caused it to become a major election issue, and Hanly had robbed the Republicans of one of the primary plank of their platform and alienated progressives, costing Republicans the election.

===Prohibition party===

While still governor, Hanly began to make work with the Anti-Saloon League. Early on he discovered the divisions within the prohibitionist movement and was instrumental in unifying the groups and their goal. He was among the first to advocate a constitutional amendment to ban the sale of liquor, and the prohibitionists rallied to that goal.

Hanly was a prohibition lecturer throughout the United States from 1910 to 1920 and in France in 1919. He organized the Flying Squadron of America (sometimes called Hanly&#x27;s Flying Squadron), a temperance organization that staged a nationwide campaign to promote temperance. It consisted of three groups of revivalist-like speakers who toured cities across the country between September 30, 1914 and June 6, 1915.

Hanly left the Republican party to join the new Prohibition Party following his term as governor. In 1915 he was nominated to be the party&#x27;s candidate for governor, but he declined, and instead became the Progressive Party&#x27;s candidate. He was later nominated to be the Prohibition Party&#x27;s candidate for President of the United States in the 1916 election. Hanly was overwhelmingly defeated; the ticket of Hanly and Ira Landrith garnered 221,030 votes, or about 1.2% of the total.

In April 1920 Hanly argued the case of &quot;Hawke v. Smith&quot;, a challenge to the Eighteenth Amendment, before the United States Supreme Court. The case was based on the belief that the amendment had been invalidated when Ohio overturned their previous ratification of the amendment after a public referendum. Hanly won a unanimous decision issued on June 1, 1920, upholding prohibition and determining that Ohio could not change their vote after the tally had already been taken among the states.

==Death==

While on a trip to Ohio in 1920 to give anti-liquor lectures, he was involved in an automobile-train accident near Dennison, Ohio and died from his injuries. He is interred at Hillside Cemetery, near Williamsport, Indiana.

<text>The 40th New Zealand Parliament was a term of the Parliament of New Zealand. Its composition was determined by the 1981 election, and it sat until the 1984 election.

The 40th Parliament was the third and final term of the third National Party government. Robert Muldoon, who served as both Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, remained in power. The Labour Party, led by former Prime Minister Bill Rowling, had made significant gains (actually winning the largest portion of the popular vote), but remained in opposition. The Social Credit Party was the only other opposition party in the 40th Parliament, holding two seats.

The 40th Parliament consisted of ninety-two representatives, the same as in the previous election. All of these representatives were chosen by single-member geographical electorates, including four special Māori electorates.

<text>Henry Goode Blasdel (January 20, 1825 – July 26, 1900) was an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He was the first Governor of Nevada, serving during the American Civil War and the first years of the Reconstruction era.

==Biography==
Blasdel was born on January 20, 1825, in the pioneer settlement of Cambridge near Lawrenceburg, Indiana. He had a limited education in the common schools of his native state. He married Sarah Jane Cox and they had three children.

==Career==
Blasdel worked as a farmer, storekeeper and river boat captain before he came to Nevada in 1861, when he was appointed Recorder of Storey County. He served on the National Union League Committee which notified President Abraham Lincoln of his renomination. He was active in mining and milling.

Securing the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Blasdel was elected Governor in 1864, and re-elected in 1866. During his tenure, the state government was organized, additional land was ceded to the state, plans were made for the first state capitol building, and an Indian uprising was dealt with.

After his governorship, Blasdel retired from political life and in 1891 he moved his family to Oakland, California, where he continued to be active in mining and milling.

==Death==
Blasdel died in his home in Oakland, California on July 26, 1900. He is interred at Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland, Alameda County, California USA.

<doc id="1264982" wikidata="Q699634" url="?curid=1264982" title="Factor 5">
<text>Factor 5 GmbH was a German-American independent software and video game developer. The company was co-founded by five former Rainbow Arts employees in 1987 in Cologne, Germany, which served as the inspiration behind the studio&#x27;s name.

In order to have a stronger relationship with Factor 5&#x27;s North American partners like LucasArts, Factor 5, Inc. was established in the United States in May 1996 with legal support from LucasArts, and in late 1996 the core of the development team in Germany was relocated to the North American company headquarters in San Rafael, California. Julian Eggebrecht, one of the five initial co-founders, served as President of Factor 5&#x27;s U.S. branch.

The U.S. company closed in May 2009, following the closure of Brash Entertainment, with which the company had multiple contracts. The original German company, headed by CEO Achim Moller, remained active due to its unrelated business policy and operations with the North American company.

However, in January 2011, Moller liquidated Factor 5 GmbH, and all game licenses were transferred to &quot;Eggebrecht, Engel, Schmidt GbR&quot;.

On March 15, 2017, Factor 5 co-founder Julian Eggebrecht had announced that the company has returned and re-acquired the rights to the &quot;Turrican&quot; franchise.

==History==
The programming group which would eventually become Factor 5 had originally formed in the 1980s, in what cofounder Julian Eggebrecht described as a culture of hacking and multimedia programming on the local demo scene. Eggebrecht attended the Filmhochschule in Munich to become a movie director, and all the other members studied computer science.

While its founders were still university students, Factor 5 started out in game development as a part-time activity under partnership with Rainbow Arts for the Amiga computer. There, they had their earliest moderate success with &quot;Katakis&quot;, an &quot;R-Type&quot; clone of impressive technical performance. Due to the game&#x27;s obvious similarity to &quot;R-Type&quot;, rights holder Activision Europe delivered an ultimatum: either Factor 5 accept a contract to perform the official &quot;R-Type&quot; conversion for the Amiga home computer, or receive a lawsuit for rights infringement. According to Julian Eggebrecht, this was because &quot;Activision couldn&#x27;t find any programmers&quot; however the opportunity was &quot;a dream come true&quot;.

Their first important success, however, came with &quot;Turrican&quot;, a game designed by Rainbow Arts designer Manfred Trenz. Factor 5 handled the Amiga and Atari ST versions of the game; and together with the original Commodore 64 version and several others, &quot;Turrican&quot; was a major hit across Europe in 1990.

In 1991, faced with the prospect of corporate formalities imposed by the video game console industry, the company founders quit school in favor of full-time corporate careers. Eggebrecht explained, &quot;[t]he moment you go into console programming, you won&#x27;t get a development system from Nintendo unless you have a reputable company.&quot; After they finished work on &quot;Turrican II: The Final Fight&quot; for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991, Factor 5 built their own development kits and software environments for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, codenamed Pegasus SNES and Pegasus Mega Drive. Subsequently, they decided to focus their efforts towards console game development in 1992 with several projects for the SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis, including new &quot;Turrican&quot; games and other titles contracted by companies like LucasArts, Hudson Soft and Konami, the latter of which had also Game Boy development contracts with them. In 1993, Factor 5 produced their last Amiga effort, an Amiga conversion of &quot;Mega Turrican&quot; handled with programming support from fellow company Neon Studios. They would develop games for the SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, and Game Boy until 1996, when they switched their efforts to the PlayStation.

With the development of PlayStation games for LucasArts, the personnel located in Germany experienced communication difficulties in working with their North American partner due to the distance between both countries and the Internet speeds of that time being insufficient for the requirements of console development. This, together with legal assistance offered by LucasArts, resulted in a new Factor 5 branch in California. There, the core of the development team from Germany was established after they finished work on their PlayStation games in late 1996.

For a long time, the North American branch of Factor 5 was an exclusive, prominent development partner with both LucasArts and Nintendo, developing both game titles for the former and middleware tools for the latter. During that time, the studio gained considerable critical and commercial praise for its technical proficiency, producing what are often cited as some of the most visually advanced titles on the Nintendo 64 and GameCube, all based on LucasArts properties. Two high-profile middleware tools were also developed by the company for Nintendo: MusyX, a sound system produced in cooperation with Dolby Laboratories; and the DivX For Games SDK, integrating the functionality of the popular video codec into Nintendo&#x27;s development tools.

In late December 2008, several online media outlets reported that Brash Entertainment (Factor 5&#x27;s publisher of their current project) would close at the end of the month after encountering financial problems. This sudden interruption in funding left Factor 5 with their own funding difficulties, eventually causing its closure in May 2009.

Factor 5 had been involved in litigation with its former employees in the defunct North American Factor 5 company. The suit alleges that Factor 5 did not pay its employees for work during November and December, that employees were laid off without the required notice by law, that employees did not receive their vacation pay, and that the company misled the employees. The suit was filed in Marin Superior Court.

<text>The iNavsat consortium was a group of European companies that came together in 2004 to bid on a contract with Galileo Joint Undertaking (GJU) to run the Galileo positioning system. The group consisted of Thales, EADS and Inmarsat. In May 2005 iNavsat and its competitor Eurely consortium came up with a joint bid that eventually won the contract. After the GJU was replaced in 2006 by the European GNSS Supervisory Authority (GSA), some of the companies of INavsat and Eurely consortium regrouped into Galileo Industries, later called European Satellite Navigation Industries, to work for the Galileo project.

<text>Andreas Vollenweider (born 4 October 1953) is a Swiss harpist. He is generally categorised as a new-age musician and uses a modified electroacoustic harp of his own design. He has worked with Bobby McFerrin, Carly Simon, Luciano Pavarotti and in 1987 received a Grammy Award for the album &quot;Down to the Moon&quot;. Vollenweider&#x27;s style has been described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;swirling atmospheric music, which evokes nature, magic and fairy tales&quot;.

==Early life==
Vollenweider was born on 4 October 1953 in Zürich, Switzerland, and is the son of Hans Vollenweider (1918–1993), an organist and composer, while his mother was a painter. In 1971, he married Beata, a kindergarten teacher, with whom he has two sons (Jonathan and Sebastian) and a daughter, Noëmi. In 1975, Vollenweider discovered the harp and, finding its traditional versions too limited for his own musical ideas, developed his own style, tailoring the instrument according to his needs. He created the electro-acoustic harp. He formed the trio &quot;Poesie und Musik&quot; together with Rene Bardet (bass) and Orlando Valentini (guitar), recording interpretations of the poetry of François Villon and Heinrich Heine, but left in 1978. During this period, Vollenweider also wrote music for film, mainly nature documentaries.

==Career==
=== 1980s ===
In 1979, he released his solo debut, &quot;Eine Art Suite in XIII Teilen&quot; in Switzerland. He subsequently began forming his ensemble &quot;Andreas Vollenweider and Friends&quot;, which included Walter Keiser (drums), Pedro Haldemann (percussion), Bobby Reveron (percussion), and Jon Otis (percussion). This five-piece debuted on July 11, 1981, at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Vollenweider was discovered by the German record-producer and manager Vera Brandes, who oversaw the release of &quot;Behind the Gardens - Behind the Wall - Under the Tree...&quot;. through her VeraBra Records. The album was distributed through CBS Records International and reached 32 in the German album charts in March 1982. The follow-up &quot;Caverna Magica&quot; was recorded in the period May–November 1982 while Vollenweider and his band performed around Europe. Released in January 1983, the album managed to reach 11 in the German album chart. In 1983, he underlined his commitment to environmental issues with the EP &quot;Pace Verde&quot; in support for Greenpeace, which was accompanied by a video that Vollenweider directed and produced himself. In October of that year he was awarded a Dutch Edison Award in the &quot;Instrumental&quot; category for &quot;Caverna Magica&quot;.

In 1984, the album &quot;White Winds&quot; entered the American billboard chart. Released through CBS Masterworks in North America, his records remained on catalogue, clocking up to six-figure sales. Vollenweider embarked on his first American tour in November of that year, making his debut at the Beacon Theatre, New York. It was presented by Carly Simon who had come across his music a year earlier. She explained that &quot;I knew I had discovered something that was going to change me in a wonderful way, I became so obsessed with his music that anyone who came to my house was introduced to it within the first 10 or 15 minutes&quot;. Through CBS she got in contact with the artist and arranged for his American debut. As his instrumental tracks were generally deemed unsuitable for radio, he largely relied on word-of-mouth in gathering an international following.

Vollenweider spent much of 1985 on tour, promoting the &quot;White Winds&quot; album with his five-piece band. The shows were described as a new age experience that combined the use of lights and dry ice while Vollenweider appeared as a &quot;white-clad figure who&#x27;s poised to drive the audience wild with a harp&quot;. In 1987, &quot;Down To The Moon&quot;, which had been originally recorded and released in 1984, received a Grammy Award. This was followed by tours in Canada, the United States, thirteen European countries, Japan, and Australia. When he composed the music of, and recorded, the dynamic album &quot;Dancing With The Lion&quot; in 1988 and 1989, Vollenweider opened his project, for the first time in his career, to numerous guests from a wide range of musical genres. He directed and produced two award-winning videos, one of which was for the title selection; for both videos, he contributed to the storyline, the choreography, and set/costume designs. 

=== 1990s ===
Vollenweider&#x27;s double album &quot;The Trilogy&quot; (1990), consisted of a selection of the first three albums (&quot;Behind The Gardens&quot;, &quot;Caverna Magica&quot;, and &quot;White Winds&quot;) and previously unreleased material. In 1991, he followed up with &quot;Book of Roses&quot;, which included symphonic orchestral elements for the first time. In 1992, he participated in a benefit show for Chernobyl&#x27;s children on Moscow&#x27;s Red Square. The same year, he won the World Music Award in Monaco. In 1993-94, he produced his first album including vocals. The 1993–94 album &quot;Eolian Minstrel&quot; featured contributions from American singers Carly Simon and Eliza Gilkyson. The release was followed by worldwide tours. 

In 1994, he performed at the Pavarotti and Friends event in Modena, Italy, where he played duets with operatic lyric tenor Luciano Pavarotti (a native of Modena) and Canadian rock balladeer Bryan Adams. After conducting tours and open-air shows in Europe and the United States, in 1995 he played in Latin America for the first time. 1995–97 saw Vollenweider playing a series of shows in remarkable locations: a tour of Polish castles, a show with Italian singer/songwriter Zucchero at the 2500 m high location (at -8°C) of Brunico in the Southern Alps, and in a giant volcanic cave at Lanzarote&#x27;s Festival Musica Visual. 

In 1998, Vollenweider began the recording of &quot;Kryptos,&quot; a work for symphonic orchestras and guest virtuosos from all over the world. He initiated a symphonic live project which he called &quot;Wolkenstein&quot;. In 1999, he returned to free improvisation and intimate musical dialogues with his album &quot;COSMOPOLY&quot; He invited friends, including American vocal acrobat Bobby McFerrin, Brazilian cult poet and singer Milton Nascimento, South-African ethno-jazz pianist Abdullah Ibrahim, the 74-year-old Armenian duduk legend Djivan Gasparyan, Galician bag-pipe and whistle virtuoso Carlos Núñez Muñoz, the American singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and American blues-trombone master Ray Anderson, from all over the globe to create &quot;world music&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
Throughout 2000, he traveled with the &quot;COSMOPOLY&quot; project in Europe. Its changing configuration of musicians — almost daily — enabled Vollenweider to follow the open concept of the album. In New York City, he and his friends played two concerts for the United States release. Carly Simon joined the group, as did Mindy Jostyn, Carlos Núñez, Djivan Gasparyan, XiaoJing Wang and Walter Keiser. Concerts in Brazil — with Milton Nascimento and composer/pianist Wagner Tiso — followed. In 2001, Vollenweider performed in Bali (Indonesia) at the international conference &quot;song of convergence&quot; with Balinese musicians. He began writing the &quot;symphonic novel&quot; &quot;Tales of Kira Kutan&quot;, which premiered at the Warsaw Film Music Festival 2001, with the orchestra Sinfonia Varsowia (Yehudi Menuhin), conducted by co-orchestrator André Bellmont. Returning to his native Switzerland, Vollenweider premiered &quot;Carte blanche&quot; at the AVO Festival in Basel, where his guests, in addition to a mini orchestra, included Abdullah Ibrahim and David Lindley.

In 2002, he performed at the Budapest Spring Festival in Hungary. Performances of the symphonies &quot;Tales of Kira Kutan&quot; and &quot;Wolkenstein&quot; at the Festival &quot;Live at Sunset&quot; in Zürich, with Sinfonia Varsovia, followed, as did a European summer tour, with the newly formed AVAF-mini orchestra, that included a performance at the &quot;Big Chill Festival&quot; in England and continued that fall. It was around this time that he collaborated with German film composer Hans Zimmer, in Los Angeles, on the music score for the movie &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot; (starring Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci). In 2003, he continued his work with Zimmer. A performance followed, with his mini orchestra, in Johannesburg and at the &quot;North Sea Festival&quot; in Cape Town. 

In 2004 and 2005, AVAF continued to increase touring activities in Europe. At this time, Vollenweider&#x27;s entire catalogue was re-mastered and re-released on new record labels worldwide (USA/Canada: www.kinkoumusic.com; international: www.edel.com). A compilation, &quot;The Best of &quot;Magic Harp&quot;, was released in the United States and Canada, and &quot;The Storyteller&quot; was released in Europe. A four-hour DVD was also produced. He played for the Dalai Lama, when the latter paid a visit in Zürich. In 2005, he released the album &quot;VOX&quot;. 

In the first three months of 2006, following extensive touring in Europe, Vollenweider conducted his first tour of the US in over ten years, touring from coast to coast. At that time, he also released his first DVD, &quot;The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider&quot;, which contained almost four hours of live concerts, documentaries, interviews. During the summer of that year, he recorded a new album, titled &quot;Midnight Clear&quot;, in which he again collaborated with Carly Simon. (See above for his previous collaborations with her.) The last three months of 2006 saw Vollenweider touring in Europe, in addition to his release of &quot;Midnight Clear&quot; on a worldwide basis and that of the DVD &quot;The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider&quot; in the rest of the world. 2007 saw Vollenweider draw his third nomination for a Grammy Award for the soundtrack album of the current DVD release &quot;The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider&quot;. Concerts in Europe and the United States followed, as did, in September of that year, the release of the two-CD double album &quot;Andreas Vollenweider &amp; Friends - 25 Years Live&quot;, which covered the period from 1982 to 2007. 

In 2008, during his composition of the music for, and his recording of, the album &quot;A I R&quot;, Vollenweider was a guest performer at the celebration concert for the 80th birthday of Armenian duduk legend Jivan Gasparyan.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, Vollenweider gave concerts in Eastern and Western Europe. In June, he undertook a special concert project, which he titled &quot;The Watercourse Way,&quot; at the Shanghai Centre in Shanghai, China, as part of Expo 2010. A &quot;Dream Concert&quot; of the extended AVAF followed in August, as did the &quot;Dancing With The Lion Orchestra&quot; concert on the shore of Lake Zurich; it featured a gathering of Vollenweider&#x27;s musical friends from all corners of the world. In 2011, three decades after his first concert, he accepted the invitation of Montreux Jazz Festival founder Claude Nobs to perform an exclusive jubilee concert, on 7 July, at the 45th such Festival, titled &quot;30 Years Andreas Vollenweider &amp; Friends&quot;. It featured special guests Richard Bona and Raul Midon.

In 2012, he played at the farewell concert for Claude Nobs, who had died in January of that year. In the same year Vollenweider was granted the Swiss Music Award for &quot;Outstanding Achievement Award&quot; for his continuing life&#x27;s work. On Christmas Eve, Swiss Television broadcasts the first major documentary devoted to Vollenweider, in which filmmaker Cristina Karrer shows impressing and touching sequences recorded in October 2010 in South Africa. In May 2012 Andreas Vollenweider lends his name to a campaign by ROKPA, a charity he has been working with for decades. Children who had once lived on the streets in Kathmandu, Nepal, visit eight Swiss cities to tell their moving stories using theatre, dance and music, with a changing roster of Swiss musical guests and an equally celebrated line-up of TV moderators.

For a scientific study conducted between 2013 and 2016 by researchers at the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG) in Switzerland, Vollenweider wrote music that was specifically designed to improve the neural development of premature babies. The composer wrote three sound environments of eight minutes each, with punji, harp and bells pieces. The neural networks of premature babies who heard Vollenweider&#x27;s music were significantly improved, becoming more similar to those of full-term newborns, &quot;providing evidence for a beneficial effect of music on the preterm brain&quot;.

== Style ==
His style has been described as weaving &quot;elements of European classical and folk music, Third World vocal and percussive effects and natural sound effects into cyclical suites&quot;. Vollenweider is perceived as one of the pioneers of the New Age genre, although his earlier recordings appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; jazz chart. The composer found that &quot;what I am doing is really a very old thing, a very &#x27;old age&#x27; thing, because I&#x27;m doing what people have been doing for thousands of years&quot;.

==Activism==
In the 1980s, Vollenweider was described as someone whose &quot;politics run to the left, including support for Amnesty International and Greenpeace&quot;. He is an outspoken pacifist and follower of the principles of non-violent conflict management of Mahatma Gandhi.

<doc id="1264990" wikidata="Q3755462" url="?curid=1264990" title="Garryowen (air)">
<text>&quot;Garryowen&quot; is an Irish tune for a jig dance. It has become well known as a marching tune in Commonwealth and American military units, most famously George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s 7th Cavalry Regiment.

== History ==
Garryowen, meaning &quot;St John&#x27;s acre&quot; in Irish, is the name of a neighbourhood in Limerick. The song emerged during the late 18th century when it was a drinking song of young roisterers in the city. An alternate title is &quot;Let Bacchus&#x27;s Sons Be Not Dismayed.&quot;

Sung to the tune &quot;Auld Bessie&quot;, it obtained immediate popularity in the British Army through the 5th (or Royal Irish) Regiment of Dragoons.

It was published with additional lyrics in Thomas Moore&#x27;s 1808 &quot;Irish Melodies.&quot; Beethoven composed two arrangements of the song during 1809–1810 (published 1814–1816 in W.o.O. 152 and W.o.O. 154) with the title, &quot;From Garyone my Happy Home,&quot; with lyrics by T. Toms, on romantic themes. The arrangements were part of a large project by George Thomson to engage prominent composers of his time to write arrangements of the folk songs of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. The composer Mauro Giuliani arranged the tune in Arie Nazionali Irlandesi nr.1-6 Op.125 (Six Irish Airs). The Bohemian composer Ignaz Moscheles included the tune in his op. 89 &quot;Souvenirs de l&#x27;Irlande&quot;, &quot;Recollections of Ireland&quot; for solo piano and orchestra.

===British military units===
A very early reference to the tune appears in the publication &quot;The Life of the Duke of Wellington&quot; by Jocquim Hayward Stocqueler, published in 1853. He describes the defence of the town of Tarifa during the Peninsular War, late December 1811. General Hugh Gough, commanding officer of the 87th Regiment (later the Royal Irish Fusiliers), under attack by French grenadiers, drew his sword, tossed his scabbard and called on his men to stand with him until the enemy should walk over their bodies. The troops responded with the &quot;Garryowen.&quot;

It was used as a march by the 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) during the Peninsular War.

Garryowen was also a favourite during the Crimean War. The tune has been associated with a number of British and Commonwealth military units including the Liverpool Irish, the London Irish Rifles, the Ulster Defence Regiment, and the Irish Regiment of Canada.

===US military units===
In early 1851, Irish citizens of New York City formed a militia regiment known locally as the Second Regiment of Irish Volunteers. The group selected &quot;Garryowen&quot; as their official regimental marching song. On 12 October 1851, the regiment was accepted officially as part of the New York Militia and designated the 69th Infantry Regiment (the famed &quot;Fighting 69th&quot;). It is presently known officially as the 1st Battalion, 69th Infantry and is part of the 42nd Infantry Division. The song is heard several times throughout the Warner Bros. movie &quot;The Fighting 69th&quot; (1940), starring James Cagney, Pat O&#x27;Brien, and Alan Hale, Sr., which chronicles the World War I exploits of the regiment.

====7th Cavalry====
It later became the marching tune for the American 7th Cavalry Regiment during the late 19th century. The tune was brought to the 7th Cavalry by Brevet Colonel Myles Keogh and other officers with relations to the 5th Royal Irish Lancers and the Papal Guard. As the story goes, it was the last song played for Custer&#x27;s men as they left General Terry&#x27;s column at the Powder River. The song features in the 1941 biographical western &quot;They Died With Their Boots On&quot;, featuring Errol Flynn as Custer. It is also heard in John Ford westerns &quot;She Wore A Yellow Ribbon&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956), both starring John Wayne.

The 7th Cavalry became a part of the 1st Cavalry Division in 1921. The word &quot;Garryowen&quot; was used often during the Vietnam War by soldiers of the 1st Cavalry as a password to identify each other. It became the official tune of the division in 1981. The words &quot;Garry Owen&quot; now form part of the regimental crest.

The tune became the name for bases established by the cavalry in various conflicts. The most recent was Contingency Operating Site Garry Owen in the Maysan Province of Iraq. FOB Garryowen was established in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 8–10 in June 2008 by the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment. There was also a Camp Garry Owen north of Seoul, Korea, which housed part of the 4th Squadron of the 7th Cavalry.

Theodore Roosevelt considered it &quot;the greatest fighting tune in the world.&quot;

<text>Ronald Gordon &quot;Ron&quot; Stevens (September 17, 1949 – May 13, 2014) was a Canadian politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the constituency of Calgary-Glenmore as a Progressive Conservative until his resignation on May 15, 2009. He was subsequently appointed a Judge of the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Alberta on May 20, 2009, by the government of Canada.

==Early life==

Stevens was born September 17, 1949, in Empress, Alberta. He graduated from the University of Calgary in 1971 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and went on to obtain a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1975 from the University of Alberta. Before being elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, Stevens worked as a civil litigation lawyer and mediator with a major law firm in Calgary. In 1996, he was appointed Queen&#x27;s Council.

An active community member, Stevens served in the role of president of the Palliser Bayview Pumphill Community Association, director of the Community Mediation Calgary Society, director of the Federation of Calgary Communities, and director and vice chair of the Calgary Housing Authority.

== Political career ==

Stevens first sought public office in the 1997 provincial election in the constituency of Calgary-Glenmore. In that election, he received 58% of the vote. In the 2001 provincial election that followed, Stevens was re-elected with 68% of the popular vote. That same year, he was appointed by Premier Ralph Klein as Minister of Gaming and was responsible for the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission and the Alberta Lottery Fund. Following the 2004 provincial election, where he received 50% of the vote, Stevens was sworn in as Minister of Justice and Attorney General. On June 27, 2007, he was named Alberta&#x27;s Deputy Premier by newly elected Premier Ed Stelmach. In the 2008 provincial election, Stevens was elected for a fourth time receiving 51% of the vote. On March 12, 2008, he was sworn in as Minister of International and Intergovernmental Relations.

Stevens served in a variety of capacities on numerous boards and committees. He held the title of Deputy Government House Leader, the position of chair for the Legislative Review Committee, the Oil Sands Ministerial Strategy Committee (Radke Report), the Health Information Legislation Committee, the Standing Policy Committee on Learning, the Private Schools Funding Task Force, the Non-Profit Tax Exemption Review Committee, the position of vice chair of the Agenda and Priorities Committee and the Standing Policy Committee on Justice and Government Services, and the position of deputy chair of the Select Special Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act Review Committee.

Stevens also served as a member of the Treasury Board, the Agenda and Priorities Committee, and the Privileges and Elections, Standing Orders and Printing Committee.

As an MLA, Stevens successfully sponsored two governmental bills: the &quot;Holocaust Memorial Day and Genocide Remembrance Act&quot; and the &quot;Irrigation Districts Act&quot;. He also sponsored one private member&#x27;s bill during his first term in office: the &quot;Emblems of Alberta (Alberta Dress Tartan) Amendment Act, 2000&quot;.

=== Hawaiian Stopover Controversy ===

In October 2007, CBC News Calgary reported that Ron Stevens had used his government credit card to pay for drinks and meals for his wife and four other people while on a stopover in Hawaii in 2003. At the time, Stevens was serving as Alberta&#x27;s Gaming Minister. His three-day Hawaiian stopover occurred as he was returning from Australia where he had been studying that country&#x27;s gaming system. &quot;I don&#x27;t recall whether it was a three-day stop or not,&quot; Stevens told CBC when questioned about the trip. &quot;But I do recall that we did it in that fashion because it was less expensive than flying business class. In other words, it was the most [economical] way of doing it.&quot;

==Personal life==

Stevens was married to Phyllis. The couple had two children together. He died of natural causes on May 13, 2014, at the age of 64.

<text>A gigapixel image is a digital image bitmap composed of one billion (109) pixels (picture elements), 1000 times the information captured by a 1 megapixel digital camera. A square image of 31,623 pixels in width and height is one gigapixel. Current technology for creating such very high-resolution images usually involves either making digital image mosaics of many high-resolution digital photographs or using a film negative as large as 12&quot; × 9&quot; (30 cm × 23 cm) up to 18&quot; × 9&quot; (46 cm × 23 cm), which is then scanned with a high-end large-format film scanner with at least 3000 dpi resolution. Only a few cameras are capable of creating a gigapixel image in a single sweep of a scene, such as the Pan-STARRS PS1 and the Gigapxl Camera.

A gigamacro image is a gigapixel image which is a close-up or macro image.

==Terapixel== 
A terapixel image is an image composed of one trillion (1012) pixels. Though currently rare, there have been a few instances such as the Microsoft Research Terapixel project for use on the Fulldome projection system, a composite of medical images by Aperio, and Google Earth&#x27;s Landsat images viewable as a time-lapse are collectively considered over one terapixel.

In 2015 the &#x27;Terabite&#x27;, the world&#x27;s first terapixel macro image, was released by GIGAmacro.

<doc id="1265003" wikidata="Q688845" url="?curid=1265003" title="Armor for Sleep">
<text>Armor for Sleep is an American rock band from Teaneck, New Jersey. Their current lineup consists of lead vocalist, guitarist, and songwriter Ben Jorgensen, lead guitarist PJ DeCicco, bassist Anthony DiIonno and drummer Nash Breen. Currently the band consists of Jorgensen and Breen alongside guitarist Erik Rudic and bassist Chad Sabo, both members of the Cold Seas, in which Breen is also a member.

After initial demos had been distributed, New York–based independent label Equal Vision Records signed the band and went on to release the concept-based albums, &quot;Dream to Make Believe&quot; (2003) and &quot;What to Do When You Are Dead&quot; (2005). The following year, the band signed to Sire Records and Warner Bros. and released their last album &quot;Smile for Them&quot; (2007) before a yearslong hiatus. The band announced their disbandment in October 2009, only reuniting briefly for tours in 2012 and 2015. They officially reunited in 2020 and released a new album in September 2022, &quot;The Rain Museum&quot;, on Equal Vision Records and Rude Records.

During their recording career, the band has been known for their blend of alternative rock, atmospheric emo, and dream pop.

==History==
Armor For Sleep was founded by Ben Jorgensen in 2001 in Teaneck, New Jersey. Nash Breen and Peter James &quot;PJ&quot; DeCicco later joined the band after leaving fellow New Jersey band Prevent Falls. Jorgensen stated the name of the band comes from his early experiences of writing music and not being able to sleep. As he recalls, &quot;I guess when I started the band I was kind of, like, retreating in my room and I kind of couldn&#x27;t really fall asleep, so I started playing music. I just thought of the name Armor for Sleep, because it was really, the music was keeping me from passing out! Which was something I was procrastinating on.&quot;

Ben would go on to record a two-song demo containing the songs Dream to Make Believe and Slip Like Space, which would later be re-recorded and released on their first album &quot;Dream to Make Believe&quot;. Former guitarist Paul Abrahamian went on to form It&#x27;s Called the Ghost Town Symphony in November 2002. Later that month, Armor for Sleep recorded a three-song demo with producer Dan Coutant; Mark Kenask of Blind Society played drums on the demo.

Armor For Sleep originally signed to Equal Vision Records, where they released their first two albums, &quot;Dream to Make Believe&quot; in 2003 and &quot;What to Do When You Are Dead&quot; in 2005. The band signed to Warner Brothers/Sire Records in 2006, explaining it was &quot;time for a change&quot;.
A Machine Shop remix of their track &quot;Remember to Feel Real&quot; was featured on the &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot; soundtrack in August 2006. 

The next year, the band debuted a new track entitled &quot;End of the World&quot; on the for the 2007 film &quot;Transformers&quot;. This song would later appear on their next record, but with various changes, including the reduction in vocal effects and keyboards.

Armor For Sleep released their third full-length album &quot;Smile for Them&quot; on October 30, 2007.

On August 20, 2008, the band announced an extended play (EP), entitled &quot;The Way Out Is Broken&quot;.

===Disbandments and reunions===
On October 28, 2009, it was officially announced that the band would be parting ways. Frontman Ben Jorgensen released a statement informing fans of the inevitable, after the band had been inactive, not undertaking a tour for over a year.

The band regrouped to play the 2012 Bamboozle Festival in New Jersey, releasing the following statement:

&quot;We have no motivation for doing this other than to get up on stage and say goodbye properly to the people out there who never got the opportunity to see us one last time. Like Sam Beckett in &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; we will strive to &quot;put right what once went wrong&quot;...and then just like him we will poof out of existence. But for good this time- we promise.&quot;

On July 20, 2015, the band announced an eight city tour to celebrate the 10th anniversary of &quot;What To Do When You Are Dead&quot;.

===Post-disbandment projects===
In January 2009, Abrahamian formed the band 1984.

After the group parted ways, Ben Jorgensen briefly started an electronic project called God Loves a Challenge alongside Sierra Shardae and also embarked on a brief solo career, releasing the EP &quot;There Is Nowhere Left to Go&quot; in 2010.

===Return and fourth studio album===
On February 24, 2020, the band announced on Facebook that they would be reuniting for a summer tour including nineteen US cities to celebrate the 15th anniversary of &quot;What to Do When You Are Dead&quot;. The tour was later postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and on August 13, 2020, the band announced the new tour dates for 2021. In July 2022, the band announced a new album, &quot;The Rain Museum&quot;, which was released on September 9, 2022.

In the summer of 2022, Armor for Sleep performed on select dates of the Hello Gone Days tour, co-headlined by Dashboard Confessional and Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness.

In the spring of 2023, the band co-headlined the Pitch Black Forever tour with Hawthorne Heights.

In the fall of 2023, the band went on tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their debut album, &quot;Dream to Make Believe&quot;, with guests the Early November (who coincidentally were celebrating the 20th anniversary of their own debut album, &quot;The Room&#x27;s Too Cold&quot;) and the Spill Canvas.

In February 2024 the band performed on the 2024 Emo&#x27;s Not Dead Cruise, which was headlined by Yellowcard.

On July 18, 2024 the band released a new single, &quot;In Another Dream&quot;. Then on October 11, 2024 they released another new single, &quot;What a Beautiful World&quot;.

On November 12, 2024 the band announced a 20th anniversary tour for &quot;What to Do When You Are Dead&quot; which will begin in Boston on March 6, 2025 and feature supporting acts Boys Night Out and Hellogoodbye.

<doc id="1265006" wikidata="Q2544720" url="?curid=1265006" title="Aaron Aguilera">
<text>Aaron Aguilera (born February 28, 1977) is an American professional wrestler and actor best known as Jesús and Uno on World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), MTV&#x27;s Wrestling Society X, All Japan Pro Wrestling as Zodiac and Lucha Libre USA as Lujo Esquire.

==Career==

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2000, 2004–2005, 2007)===
Aguilera initially appeared in the World Wrestling Federation with Christopher Daniels as Uno, one half of Los Conquistadores during the time Edge &amp; Christian were masquerading as the team. He was rehired nearly 4 years later to perform under the gimmick of Jesús. As part of a kayfabe storyline, Jesús was accused of stabbing John Cena at a Boston, Massachusetts nightclub by order of Carlito Caribbean Cool. After Cena defeated Carlito for the WWE United States Championship, Jesús attacked Cena several times in the next couple of weeks, finally hitting him in the kidney with Cena&#x27;s own chain, temporarily sidelining him. In reality, Cena required a break from WWE while he was out of the country filming &quot;The Marine&quot;.

Aguilera faced John Cena in a Street Fight at Armageddon 2004 for the WWE United States Championship, but was defeated. Due to an injury sustained at a house show in Johnson City, Tennessee, he went into the match with a torn groin and two herniated discs in his back, and left to have surgery immediately afterwards. The surgery was successful. Aguilera was released from his WWE contract on April 12, 2005.

Aaron later returned to WWE on a one time deal, wrestling under his real name on the November 11, 2007 episode of &quot;WWE Heat&quot; in a losing effort against Ron Simmons.

===Independent circuit ===
As the Hardcore Kidd, Aguilera appeared in Ultimate Pro Wrestling, marking his first wrestling match since being released by WWE. On August 6, 2005, Aguilera started appearing in the Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) promotion, first losing to T. J. Perkins (aka Puma), and then on the August 19, 2005 teaming with Davey Richards to defeat Perkins and Alex Shelley. On September 30, 2005, Aguilera lost to his former tag team partner Christopher Daniels at Adrenaline Unleashed. On October 22, 2005, Aguilera appeared at AWS, teaming with Al Katrazz to defeat Davey Richards and Tony Kozina. Then, on November 19, 2005, with the PWG, Aguilera teamed with Petey Williams, losing to Frankie Kazarian and Chris Sabin. On November 26, 2005, Aguilera wrestled Babi Slymm to a no-contest. Then at the January 15, 2006 Pro Wrestling WAR show, Aguilera wrestled Charles Mercury to a no-contest. Then in the main event, Aguilera &amp; Keiji Sakoda wrestled Teddy Hart and Jack Evans to a double countout. Afterwards, Hart did a moonsault off a basketball hoop and injured his knee. Aguilera made an appearance at AWS at Frank and Sons on May 20, 2006, and picked up a win against Adam Pearce after hitting Pearce in the head with a boot that he took from Pearce&#x27;s manager, C. Edward Vander Pyle. Aguilera challenged Pearce and Vander Pyle to a tag team match on July 8, 2006, with his manager, El Jefe.

On February 4, 2006, Aguilera made his Florida wrestling debut with Nick Mayberry&#x27;s Hardkore Championship Wrestling, at the 2006 HCW Incredible 8 Tournament. He defeated former WCW enhancement talent Casey Thompson in the opening round, second-generation wrestler &quot;J-Dawg&quot; Jeff Brooks in the second round, and then &quot;The King of The Indies&quot; Reckless Youth in the final round of the tournament. He became the 4th person ever to win an Incredible 8 Tournament, behind Shark Boy, Reckless Youth, and Dagon Briggs.

In March 2007, Aguilera officially made a challenge for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and appeared in the Reclaiming the Glory tournament, falling to longtime rival Adam Pearce in the first round. He has also appeared briefly in the IWA in Puerto Rico.

Aaron &#x27;Jesus&#x27; Aguilera was part of the team Los Pochos Guapos with Kaos. The team main evented in the third episode of WSX, in a Tables, Ladders and Cervezas match ending their feud with Luke Hawx and Alkatrazz. Los Pochos Guapos, on a losing streak, got their first win over the team of Teddy Hart and Matt Cross, known as the Filth and the Fury. They then began a feud with The Cartel and participated in the Season Finale episode of WSX facing The Cartel in a Piranha Deathmatch.

In June 2011, Aaron Aguilera was announced as a team captain for the AWW pilot tapings, under the name Awesome Aaron Aguilera. At the pilot tapings on June 29, Aguilera, who was under the nickname &quot;The Human Cyclone&quot;, defeated Schwagg Dutt in a five-minute Iron Man match. Later on the same tapings, Aguilera lost to Dutt in an Ultimate X match, which also included RPM and Dubai.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (2007–2012) ===
On October 18, 2007, Aguilera debuted for All Japan Pro Wrestling under a mask as Zodiac, becoming a member of the heel stable Voodoo Murders. He teamed with Taru (stylized in all capital letters) in the 2007 World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League, but the team purposely picked up no victories due to being disqualified in every single one of their matches. On May 25, 2008, Zodiac lost a Hair vs. Mask match to Joe Doering and was forced to unmask. After refusing to cheat in a match, he went on to defeat Taru in a match. After that match, Satoshi Kojima offered Zodiac a spot in his F4 stable, which he accepted and turned face in the process.

His last match for All Japan took place on September 23, 2012, as he teamed with Joe Doering in a losing effort against the AJPW World Tag Team champions Manabu Soya &amp; Takao Omori.

<doc id="1265009" wikidata="Q1679948" url="?curid=1265009" title="MV Selendang Ayu">
<text>MV Selendang Ayu, , was a Malaysian-registered Panamax bulk cargo ship chartered by the IMC Group. It ran aground off Unalaska Island in western Alaska&#x27;s Aleutian Islands on 8 December 2004 after its engine failed. Six crew members died when a rescue helicopter was engulfed by a breaking wave; the ship broke in two, resulting in a large oil spill.

== Final voyage ==
On 28 November 2004, &quot;Selendang Ayu&quot; left Seattle, Washington, bound for Xiamen, China. On board was a cargo of of soybeans, along with of fuel oil. Arrival in China was scheduled for 17 December but the ship was running at reduced speed due to high winds and heavy seas.

After the ship had sailed through Unimak Pass, the ship&#x27;s engine malfunctioned and was shut down, at around noon on 6 December. At this point, the ship was north-west of Bogoslof Island and around from Dutch Harbor, the nearest port. The cause of the engine failure was found to be a cracked liner in the no. 3 cylinder and the ship&#x27;s engineers decided to isolate that cylinder, restart the engine using the five remaining cylinders and sail to Dutch Harbor, where the defective cylinder could be repaired. By 21:00, the no. 3 cylinder had been isolated but the engine could not be restarted. At this time, the wind was Beaufort force 8, from the north-west, and the ship was drifting towards land at about .

The following morning, it was discovered that four of the engine&#x27;s cylinders also had cracked piston rings. It was decided to replace the worst of these and make another attempt to restart the engine. By now, the sustained wind speed was around and the ship was drifting at in seas.

At 11:00, the US Coast Guard cutter arrived on scene and was standing by. The no. 6 cylinder head, weighing was removed and lashed to the deck but worsening weather and the ship&#x27;s roll prevented any more work on the engine for the next 18 hours. Fuel was transferred to inboard tanks to reduce the likelihood of a spill if the ship should run aground. During the afternoon, the ship drifted past Bogoslof Island at a distance of around . The ocean-going tug &quot;Sidney Foss&quot; arrived after sunset at 18:30 and a line was attached. However, with winds now at and waves of , the tug was only able to slow the vessel&#x27;s drift.

A second tug, &quot;James Dunlap&quot; was hired from Dutch Harbor, with the intention of attaching a towline from the tug to &quot;Selendang Ayu&quot;″s stern so the stricken freighter could be turned to face into the wind, allowing it to be towed away from Unalaska Island. However, soon after &quot;James Dunlap&quot; arrived, the tow-line from &quot;Sidney Foss&quot; parted at 07:30 on 8 December and the weather made it impossible to re-establish the tow. At 11:15, the ship passed into water shallow enough for its anchors to be used. One anchor was dropped and this halted the ship for around an hour, until the wind worsened and the ship began to drift towards the shore again. The starboard anchor could not be lowered as the port anchor had wrapped around the bow of the ship. &quot;Alex Haley&quot; tried to attach a towline to turn the ship and allow the second anchor to be dropped but this also failed.

== Rescue ==

Two HH-60J Jayhawk helicopters had been sent from Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak to Cold Bay to rescue &quot;Selendang Ayu&quot;″s crew, if necessary. At 14:00 on 8 December, the first of these helicopters began to winch nine of the ship&#x27;s crew from the deck and, 50 minutes later, began to lower them to the deck of &quot;Alex Haley&quot; while the second Jayhawk began to pick up nine more crew members and transferred them ashore.

This left seven senior officers and one deck cadet on board the ship, which had now managed to lower its starboard anchor. Work on the engine continued but the ship ran aground at 17:05. One of the Jayhawks returned to evacuate the remaining crew and, by 18:15, only the master and a Coast Guard rescue swimmer were still to be lifted off the ship. A rogue wave broke over the ship&#x27;s bow and the helicopter was engulfed in spray. Its engines flamed out from water ingestion and the helicopter crashed into the sea and sank. &quot;Alex Haley&quot;″s HH-65B Dolphin was airborne and was able to rescue the three members of the Jayhawk&#x27;s crew but only one of the seven members of the ship&#x27;s crew.
There was no sign of the remaining six men so the Dolphin took the rescued crew ashore. At 19:15, &quot;Selendang Ayu&quot; broke in two; the master and the Coast Guard swimmer were safely recovered at 20:35.

Two crewmembers of the Dolphin helicopter, CGNR 6513, were decorated for their actions in this rescue: AST3 Aaron Bean with the Meritorious Service Medal and AMT3 Gregory Gibbons with the Distinguished Flying Cross. The Coast Guard searched unsuccessfully for the remaining crew until their efforts were called off on 10 December.

== Impact ==

The ship had been carrying a significant amount of fuel, so there were fears that &quot;Selendang Ayu&quot; could create the worst Alaskan oil spill since &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot;. One tank containing of fuel ruptured when the ship broke apart. It is estimated that of heavy bunker C fuel oil and of diesel fuel was on board when she grounded. Ultimately, of bunker oil and diesel spilled, which is about 2.9% of the volume of crude oil spilled from &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot;. The crew had transferred the fuel to internal tanks when the ship foundered, and heaters were turned off so that the fuel would thicken in the cold waters. However, environmental officials estimate that up to 1.28 million liters of thick fuel oil () leaked from the freighter.

The carcasses of over 1,600 birds and 6 sea otters were recovered from beaches along the western shore of Unalaska Island after the spill.

<doc id="1265011" wikidata="Q1569072" url="?curid=1265011" title="Coat of arms of Queensland">
<text>The coat of arms of Queensland is one of the formal symbols of the Australian state of Queensland and represents the King&#x27;s constitutional authority throughout the state. It is the oldest of the state arms of Australia, having been granted in 1893 by Queen Victoria, through the simplest heraldic grants of only the shield of arms, motto, helmet, mantling and crest. In 1977, the red deer and the brolga were assigned as supporters by Queen Elizabeth II during her Silver Jubilee.

== History ==
The original coat of arms were designed by Sir Albert Woods, Garter King of Arms (head) of the Heralds College. He created four different designs (produced below) which were sent to the Chief Secretary and Premier of Queensland, Sir Samuel Griffith who selected the design that Woods favoured. In order to ensure secrecy, the choice of arms was communicated by telegraph to London using the respective code words, &quot;Halfpay&quot;, &quot;Halfprice&quot;, &quot;Iceblink&quot; and &quot;Icebound&quot;.

In 1963 the heraldic depiction of the British Imperial Crown was switched to a depiction of St Edward&#x27;s Crown.

The final and current addition to the coat of arms was created in 1977, the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, with the granting of the red deer and brolga as supporting animals. The deer represents the old world and it is a classic animal of heraldry while the brolga represents the native population and is also the state&#x27;s official bird.

== Heraldic description ==

The blazon of the coat of arms is:

Modernised, this means:

== Symbolism ==

=== Industrial influence ===
The symbols on the shield represent what Queensland&#x27;s largest industries at the time the arms were designed. The wheat industry&#x27;s origins belong with the first settlers in 1788, as the farms were worked by the convicts brought over from England, an idea of Governor Phillip. During the years till 1795, the wheat industry slowly gained popularity and by the late 19th century was a strong force in the agricultural industry of the state. The sugar industry became established by 1868 in Mackay which was a mere four years after the first commercial sugar mill was opened in Cleveland, south of Brisbane. Sugar and Coffee regulations were brought in by Parliament later that year as the industry spread rapidly and with the creation of the Mackay Central Sugar Mill Manufacturing Company ten years later in 1878, the sugar industry had reached its colonial peak.

The sheep industry had been in existence since the early 1820s within Australia and by the early 1880s the geographical expansion of this industry had hit Queensland in which major wool auctions were held throughout the state. The mining industry began with the discovery of copper on 20 May 1867 by Ernest Henry in Cloncurry and the industry climbed with the Gold Rush which occurred on 3 September 1873 when gold was discovered in Georgetown. The beef industry was quite prevalent by the late 1880s and by 1890, Queensland had exported Australia&#x27;s first major export overseas which consisted of 1500 tons and by the 20th century that number had exploded to 43,000 tons.

=== Supporting animals ===
The brolga is one of Australia&#x27;s two native crane species and the only one solely found in Australia. They stand 1 m tall with a wing-span of up to 2.4 m. They are generally grey and are known for their distinctive energetic mating dance as well as their loud trumpeting garooo call. They are mostly found along the coast from Rockhampton to the Gulf of Carpentaria. They became the official bird emblem of Queensland in January 1986.

The red deer is a traditional beast of heraldry and was introduced into Queensland from the royal herds near London. Despite their position on the coat of arms, deer are a declared feral pest in Queensland with it being illegal to distribute, trade, release into the environment, move or feed any deer under the &quot;Biosecurity Act 2014&quot;.

=== Maltese Cross ===
The Maltese cross has a stranger history than the rest of the elements upon the arms. The Maltese Cross with a superimposed crown was sourced from the state badge, however it is not known how this badge was designed. One popular theory is that Queensland sought to associate itself with the newly issued Victoria Cross (which contains a Maltese Cross with the royal arms and a lion superimposed), first bestowed to Crimean War soldiers by Queen Victoria in 1857, a few years before Queensland became a separate colony in 1859. Another theory is that there was a connection between the Maltese Cross and Lady Bowen, wife of the first governor Sir George Bowen. Given that the Maltese Cross was not adopted until 1876, many years after the governor and his wife left in 1868, the former theory appears stronger.

<text>The Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (often shortened to Alaska Maritime or AMNWR) is a United States National Wildlife Refuge comprising 2,400 islands, headlands, rocks, islets, spires and reefs in Alaska, with a total area of , of which is wilderness. The refuge stretches from Cape Lisburne on the Chukchi Sea to the tip of the Aleutian Islands in the west and Forrester Island in the southern Alaska Panhandle region in the east. The refuge has diverse landforms and terrains, including tundra, rainforest, cliffs, volcanoes, beaches, lakes, and streams.

Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge is well known for its abundance of seabirds. About 75 percent of Alaskan native marine birds, 15 to 30 million among 55 species, use the refuge. AMNWR also provides a nesting habitat for an estimated 40 million seabirds, representing 80 percent of all seabirds in North America. The birds congregate in &quot;bird cities&quot; (colonies) along the coast. Each species has a specialized nesting site (rock ledge, crevice, boulder rubble, pinnacle, or burrow). Other animals present in this refuge include caribou, sea lions, bears, coyotes, seals, Canada lynx, beavers, foxes, muskrats, wolf packs, moose, walrus, river otters, marten, whales, Dall sheep and sea otters.&lt;ref name=&quot;OPB 2020/11/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative headquarters and visitor center are located in Homer, Alaska. In 1968, Simeonof National Wildlife Refuge, part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

<doc id="1265018" wikidata="Q7572261" url="?curid=1265018" title="Space Brat">
<text>The Space Brat book series includes &quot;Space Brat&quot;, &quot;Space Brat 2: Blork&#x27;s Evil Twin&quot;, &quot;Space Brat 3: The Wrath of Squat&quot;, &quot;Space Brat 4: Planet of the Dips&quot;, and &quot;Space Brat 5: The Saber-toothed Poodnoobie&quot;.

== Writing ==
According to comments from the author, Bruce Coville, the first &quot;Space Brat&quot; story version was written in 1977. He intended to make it a picture book, and his wife (Katherine Coville) even drew a few sample illustrations. The editor disagreed with this idea, however, saying he &quot;didn&#x27;t think kids would be interested in reading about a noseless green humanoid from outer space.&quot; Ironically, this was a few years before Steven Spielberg&#x27;s movie &quot;E.T.&quot; was released.

== Plot ==
The series revolves around Blork, a young alien who lives on the planet Splat where children are hatched instead of born and remain quiet for three months until they eventually learn to get up and walk. In the case of Blork, a piece of his shell got stuck behind his ear resulting in him crying non-stop at the nursery where he was hatched. Because children on Splat are not expected to cry, one of the robots stuck a label on his forehead, categorizing him as a &quot;Brat.&quot; Eventually the eggshell fell away, but having cried for so long Blork never got the same amount of sleep as the other children and was slightly crankier. Because he was categorized as a brat early on, many inhabitants of Splat came to expect him to be one and would always blame him for things that weren&#x27;t necessarily his fault. Over time, the things he wasn&#x27;t responsible for resulted in Blork getting punished. Eventually, the constant blame causes Blork to throw a tantrum. At school, the principal calls for the Head Man--someone who handles such situations. The Head Man suggests that rather than punish Blork, people should be more sympathetic to him in order to improve his development as a youth. Paired with the previous punishments, as well as not being punished in the future Blork decides to take advantage of this by actually pulling pranks. As Blork got worse, his tantrums got better. However, on one occasion where he was given a D grade in class--Blork attempted to throw a tantrum, which ultimately doesn&#x27;t work.

The next day, Blork decides to take his pet poodnoobie Lunk to show and tell. When Blork was young, he had found Lunk by accident as he was an unhatched egg that took too long to hatch, resulting in Lunk&#x27;s mother abandoning him when her other children hatched. Blork had taken this remaining egg, thinking it was bad, and threw it against a rock, resulting in tiny baby poodnoobie rolling out. At the time, it was so small it fit inside the palm of Blork&#x27;s hand and feeling guilty, Blork decided to adopt it and name it Lunk. Poodnoobies resemble dogs, with the exception being that they have purple fur, three tongues and six legs. While poodnoobies are notorious for growing to giant proportions, the nursery rules allow Splatoon children to have one pet each as long as they care for it. Over time, Lunk grows into a giant pet. At school, Lunk gets distracted by a flying bug and ends up destroying the classroom by accident. This causes the teacher, Modra Ploogsik, to call the Big Pest Squad to take Lunk away where he will be vaporized like other troublesome animals. Feeling responsible for this, Blork decides to immediately run away during class and stowaway on the van carrying Lunk until they reach the Big Pest Squad compound. There, he steals a rocket car and manages to scoop up Lunk using the net function of the vehicle. Reunited, Blork decides to run away with Lunk to deep space. Due to not knowing his way, they end up landing in an unknown place that is inhabited by &quot;Things&quot; which resemble giant lizards.

Eventually, the two are brought before the leader of the Things, a short man calling himself Squat who decides to make both Blork and Lunk slaves. When Blork throws a tantrum, Squant is impressed and wants Blork to teach him how to throw one. Blork refuses, and both he and Lunk get imprisoned for some time. During the course of his imprisonment, Blork is subjected to various slave labor that include feeding creatures and cleaning the castle. At this time, he also slowly learns the language of the Things as well as their history of how Squat came to imprison their kind through the use of a vaporizing gun. Blork also learns how to control his emotions. Eventually, Blork is summoned to Squat again, who wants one of the Thing cooks to prepare Lunk as a meal. Blork is against this, and throws his biggest tantrum. Even more impressed than last time, Squat makes a deal with Blork that if he teaches him how to throw this tantrum he will allow both he and Lunk to go free. Blork agrees, and teaches Squat how to throw a big tantrum. Unfortunately, Squat reneges on the deal but that doesn&#x27;t keep Blork and Lunk from attempting to leave. This causes Squat to throw the same tantrum that Blork taught. Blork is reminded of all the times he threw a tantrum, and decides enough is enough. He takes advantage of this to steal the gun that Squat left on the throne and tosses it to one of the Things, who promptly destroys is. Now powerless, Squat is lifted by one of the things and tossed out the window where he lands in the water of the moat below. He survives, but leaves.

Blork, Lunk, and all the Things throw a celebration that night but Blork realizes that despite all this he is homesick. The Things eventually help him pack for his journey home (including half of Squat&#x27;s broken gun) and send him off on the rocket car that Blork had stolen earlier. On his way back, Blork realizes that they never left for deep space--they had actually went into the unexplored zone of the planet Splat. Upon arriving at his nursery, one of the Childkeeper robots is elated to see Blork return. Leaving Lunk home, both Blork and the Childkeeper pay a visit to Modra Ploogsik who is also glad to see Blork. Blork pleads his case with Modra Ploogsik to call off the Big Pest Squad, taking responsibility for his actions and volunteering to do a lot of work to make up for all the trouble he had caused. This unexpected apology causes Modra to faint and the Childkeeper to wonder if Blork is the same Blork that was in his care. Blork then proceeds to tell his story of what happened. Eventually, Blork does plead his case to the Big Pest Squad with a lot of apologies and patience with success, even returning the rocket car he had stolen. At the end of the story, Blork returns home and calls for Lunk--who excitedly races to him and licks his face with all three tongues.

Space Brat 2: Blork&#x27;s Evil Twin

Blork and his classmates take a trip to a museum that showcases various Splatoonian inventions. The class troublemaker, Appus Meeko, hooks Blork&#x27;s female crush to a machine that makes them large. Blork saves her, but cannot prove that Appus Meeko was responsible. While there, Blork accidentally finds his way into a forbidden room containing a seemingly harmless copying machine and decides to copy himself. While nothing happens, he returns home and discovers that he&#x27;s getting blamed for several instances. Blork realizes that the copy machine created a mischievous clone of himself named Krolb and also realizes that it extracted all the negative qualities of Blork&#x27;s personality and is running amok. In some cases, any action Blork does, Krolb does the opposite. Krolb also stole an experimental shrinking device and plans to use it on the entire city. Blork, aided by one of his classmates, Moomie Peevik--decide to go after Krolb and try to use reverse psychology to prevent Krolb from using the shrinking device. However, they are unsuccessful until Blork throws a tantrum, which ends up fusing him and Krolb back whole again. At Krolb&#x27;s lair, they also encounter a creature that gets shrunk with the shrinking device, and it becomes Moomie Peevik&#x27;s new pet. The story ends with the mayor of the city wanting to congratulate Blork by awarding him with a medal for saving the city. This also makes Appus Meeko jealous.

Space Brat 3: The Wrath of Squat

Before the ceremony to award Blork can happen, Squat returns in a large spaceship and abducts Blork, Lunk, Appus Meeko, along with Moomie Peevik and her pet and returns to a planet that he rules, in which the inhabitants are composed of nothing but angry people. When in captivity, they meet a strange scientist who works for Squat, but who also decides to help them escape. They manage to flee Squat&#x27;s spider henchmen, eventually finding themselves in a city. Squat tracks them down, but Blork throws a huge tantrum which still proves to be better than Squat&#x27;s and as a result the inhabitants want Blork to rule them instead. Blork declines, and instead decides to let Squat rule as his proxy. In the event that Squat is not doing his job, Blork says he will return--so the two agree that he will do his job without any issues. In exchange, Squat gives Blork his spaceship. Squat&#x27;s former scientist also tags along, feeling that he never really fit with the planet and its inhabitants. As they prepare to head home, the scientist decided to experiment with the ship by connecting two different wires, causing the spaceship to malfunction.

Space Brat 4: Planet of the Dips

As a result of the malfunction, Blork and his friends end up traveling to the planet of the dips due to the presence of a stowaway named Skippy. Thereis a parody character based on Obi-Wan Kenobi who helps Blork find a way back home. Blork&#x27;s pet Lunk, also gets confused with a ruler--and is not allowed to leave. This is due to a buried statue on the beach that resembles Lunk. Blork also participates in a contest to keep Lunk, involving throwing tomato-like fruits and trying to keep a sash clean. He loses, but is still permitted a request. He decides to use it to get all the inhabitants of the Dips to unearth the statue resembling Lunk and they discover it to be a Dip riding a Poodnoobie. One of the Dips happens to resemble one of the Dips, and they decide to make that Dip a ruler. With their ship repaired and ready to return home, they try to recreate the same steps they used and swap out Skippy&#x27;s position with Appus Meeko. At the last moment, Moomie Peevik&#x27;s pet ends up with Appus, causing the method to be disrupted.

Space Brat 5: The Saber-toothed Poodnoobie

Blork and his friends had attempted to return home using the same method that was used when Skippy was in the spaceship&#x27;s closet. While they are successful in getting back to the planet Splat, they realize that they had time-traveled millions of years to Splat in the past. This was because of Moomie Peevik&#x27;s pet, that had wandered into the closet. Appus Meeko was being used as a focal means to return home, and the pet interfered. Throughout the story, Blork meets a variety of prehistoric creatures and a Yoda-like character who advises him to not change the future by taking anything from the past with him. At the end of the book, Blork and his friends finally get back to Splat in their own time but find that they had missed the medal ceremony. When they return to their home, they find a statue that was created in their honor due to their prolonged absence. Two of their other acquaintances, remove the medal and rightfully place it around Blork. Blork decides instead to hang the medal inside their spaceship as a testament to everything he and his friends had gone through. At the end, they decide to go on another adventure. This time, everything goes right.

<text>A saved game (also called a game save, savegame, savefile, save point, or simply save) is a piece of digitally stored information about the progress of a player in a video game.

From the earliest games in the 1970s onward, game platform hardware and memory improved, which led to bigger and more complex computer games, which, in turn, tended to take more and more time to play them from start to finish. This naturally led to the need to store in some way the progress, and how to handle the case where the player received a &quot;game over&quot;. More modern games with a heavier emphasis on storytelling are designed to allow the player many choices that impact the story in a profound way later on, and some game designers do not want to allow more than one save game so that the experience will always be &quot;fresh&quot;.

Game designers allow players to prevent the loss of progress in the game (as might happen after a game over). Games designed this way encourage players to &#x27;try things out&#x27;, and on regretting a choice, continue from an earlier point on.

Although the feature of save games often allows for gameplay to resume after a game over, a notable exception is in games where save games are deleted when it is game over. Several names are used to describe this feature, including &quot;permadeath&quot;, &quot;iron man&quot;, and &quot;hardcore&quot;, and the feature has developed over the years from being the only kind of save system per game to the more modern &#x27;suspend game&#x27; feature among regular save points. For online games, the game&#x27;s progress is maintained on the remote server. In some games, upon resuming the game from a save game, the software locks or marks the save game. Early examples include &quot;Moria&quot; and &quot;Diablo II&quot; &quot;hardcore&quot; mode where the character save game is managed by the server. The use of saved games is very common in modern video games, particularly in role-playing video games, which are usually much too long to finish in a single session.

==Overview and history==
In early video games, there was no need for saving games, since these games usually had no actual plot to develop and were generally very short in length.

Classic arcade video games from the golden age of arcade video games did not save the player&#x27;s progress towards completing the game, but rather high scores, custom settings, and other features. The first game to save the player&#x27;s score was Taito&#x27;s seminal 1978 shoot &#x27;em up title &quot;Space Invaders&quot;.

The relative complexity and inconvenience of storing game state information on early home computers (and the fact that early video game consoles had no non-volatile data storage) meant that initially game saves were represented as &quot;passwords&quot; (often strings of characters that encoded the game state) that players could write down and later input into the game when resuming.

&quot;BYTE&quot; magazine stated in 1981, regarding the computer text adventure &quot;Zork I&quot;″s save-game feature, that &quot;while some cowards use it to retain their hard-earned position in the game before making some dangerous move&quot;, it was intended to let players play over many weeks. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; disagreed that year, stating that save games &quot;allow users to experiment with different approaches to the same situation&quot;. Home computers in the early 1980s had the advantage of using external media for saving, with compact cassettes and floppy disks, before finally using internal hard drives.

For later cartridge-based console games, such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, saved games were stored in battery-backed random-access memory on the game cartridge itself. &quot;Pop and Chips&quot; (1985) for the Super Cassette Vision was the first-ever game to allow saving game progress on a video game console, using an AA battery on the game cassette.

In modern consoles, which use disks for storing games, saved games are stored in other ways, such as by use of memory cards or internal hard drives on the game machine itself. The use of memory cards for saving game data dates back to SNK&#x27;s cartridge-based Neo Geo arcade system and home console in 1990.

Depending on the game, a player will have the ability to save the game either at any arbitrary point (usually when the game has been paused), after a specific task has been completed (such as at the end of a level), or at designated areas within the game known as save points.

The available ways to save a game affect gameplay, and can represent a practice of players or an explicit decision by designers to give the game a particular feel or alter its difficulty.

==Time and location of saving==

A video game may allow the user to save at any point of the game at any time. There are also modified versions of this. For example, in the GameCube game &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot;, the player can save at almost any time, but only if no enemies are in the room. To make gaming more engaging, some video games may impose a limit on the number of times a player saves the game. For instance, &quot;IGI 2&quot; allows only a handful of saves in each mission; &quot;Max Payne 2&quot; imposes this restriction on the highest level of difficulty.

Some video games only allow the game to be saved at predetermined points in the game, called save points. (Not to be confused with &quot;checkpoints&quot;.) Save points are employed either because the game is too complex to allow saving at any given point or to attempt to make the game more challenging by forcing the player to rely on their skills instead of on the ability to retry indefinitely. Save points are easier to program and thus attractive from a development standpoint.

Some games use a hybrid system where both save anywhere and save points are used. For example, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; permits saving anywhere when the player is traveling on the world map, but once the player enters a location (e.g. town, cavern or forest), saving is only possible at save points.

===Savescumming===

Overusing saved games may be seen as unfair and in such a context is referred to as &quot;savescumming&quot;. Savescumming makes losing a game impossible because whenever the player loses or is about to lose, a savegame is loaded, effectively turning back time to the situation before the loss. In a video game, this could for example be done when the player loses a battle/race, misses the best performance grading for a level (such as an S-rank) or runs into an unwinnable situation by losing anyone or anything needed to continue and win. For example, in a game that features a casino, the player could save the game and then bet all their in-game money on black at a roulette table. If the outcome is black, their money is doubled and the player saves the game again. If the outcome is red (or green), the player disregards this outcome by reloading their last savegame. This allows for an indefinite winning streak.

Game programmers may defend against savescumming by various means, such as checking timestamps. For example, on multiuser Unix systems, &quot;NetHack&quot; uses setgid to prevent users from copying save files into the necessary directory. Another technique is to use a deterministic, seeded pseudorandom number generator, so that undesired random outcomes cannot be avoided simply by saving and reloading. In this situation, when the player reloads a saved game, &#x27;random&#x27; events will occur identically every time – the only way to get a different outcome is to play differently.

==Types of saved games==
===Autosave===
Game saving does not need to be manual. Some video games save the game in progress automatically, such as after the pass of a fixed amount of time, at certain predetermined points in the game as an extension to the save point concept, or when the player exits.

Some games only permit &quot;suspend saves&quot; in which the game is automatically saved upon exiting and reloaded upon restarting. The aim of a suspend save is only to allow the gameplay to be temporarily interrupted; as such, suspend saves are erased when the player resumes the game. This concept was popularized by &quot;Rogue&quot; and the namesake genre, which are known for employing the mechanic such that if the player were to die in the game, their save file is deleted and the game must be restarted. The term &quot;perma-death&quot; would come to refer to the concept used for that purpose. It is possible to cheat the system by copying and reusing suspend save files in an act of what is considered to be a form of savescumming.

===Checkpoints===

&quot;Checkpoints&quot; are locations in a video game where a player character respawns after death. Characters generally respawn at the last checkpoint that they have reached. A respawn is most often due to the death of the in-game character, but it can also be caused by the failure to meet an objective required to advance in the game. Checkpoints might be temporary, as they stop working when the player loses their last life, completes or quits the level, especially in platform games. Most modern games, however, save the game to memory at these points, known as auto-saving.

Checkpoints might be visible or invisible to the player. Visible checkpoints might give a player a sense of security when activated, but in turn sacrifice some immersion, as checkpoints are intrinsically &quot;gamey&quot; and might even need an explanation of how they work unless they are diegetic. Invisible checkpoints do not break immersion but may make players unsure of where they will respawn, if the heads-up display does not give a visible indication that a checkpoint was reached.

===Quick-saving===
Quick-saving and quick-loading allow the player to save or load the game with a single keystroke. These terms are used to differentiate between the traditional saving mechanism where the player is required to invoke a menu or dialog box, issue save the order, specify a title for the game being saved and, if applicable, confirm whether an old saved game file with the same title should be overwritten. The term &quot;quick save&quot; may be used in video games that lack the traditional saving mechanism altogether.

The advantage of quick saving is its low burden: The player only has to press a button and, if applicable, wait a few seconds. The disadvantage is the automatic loss of the previous quick-saved game. Games that only offer quick saving may be impossible to play by two different players (or more) unless there is a mechanism to distinguish players, such as user accounts. Leaving the decision of when to save up to the player increases the likelihood that a save will be made during a less than favourable game state. A quicksave shortly before an event which kills the player creates what is known as a death loop.

===Password===
Passwords are a form of saved game not stored on non-volatile memory. Instead, everything needed to reconstruct the game state is encoded in and displayed on-screen as a string of text, usually comprising random alphanumeric characters, and the player can then record or memorize it. The player may later resume play from that point by entering the same password. Passwords were widely used by home console games before the advent of non-volatile memory and later internal and external storage.

===Save states===
A &quot;save state&quot; is a form of a saved game in emulators. A save state is generated when the emulator stores the contents of random-access memory of an emulated program to disk. Save states enable players to save their games even when the emulated game or system does not support the feature. For instance, save states may be used to circumvent saving restrictions or as a savescumming technique. An associated concept is save state hacking, the practice of which uses a hex editor to modify the save states to alter gameplay conditions, usually in favor of the player. Save states are comparable to snapshots of a computer system&#x27;s state or hibernation in computing, with save states being a limited form of snapshots.

Save states have started to receive mainstream usage in the early 2010s with Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console. Some Wii U and 3DS Virtual Console titles allow players to save a &quot;restore point,&quot; which is like a quick save but has no restrictions on reloading. Although likely derived from quick saves, restore points are functionally identical to save states, and can be used for many of the same purposes.

==Presentation==
Game designers often attempt to integrate the save points into the style of the game using skeuomorphism. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; represents save points with old fashioned typewriters (which require an ink ribbon item for each save), the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series used representations appropriate to the era of the setting: cassette tapes for the mid-1980s (&quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;), 3½-inch disks for the early-1990s (&quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;), and compact discs for the late-1990s (&quot;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories&quot;).

Although save points are typically seen as boons, some games have traps which use this tendency to fool the player. In &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, attempting to use a fake save point in Magus&#x27;s castle can actually bring the party into battle.

Some games employ limits to saving in order to prevent players from using them as a primary means of succeeding in the game. In the console versions of &quot;Tomb Raider (1996)&quot; &amp; &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot; save points are consumed upon use, &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; charges two banana coins to use a save point more than once, and in &quot;Resident Evil&quot; the player must find and expend an ink ribbon for each save.

In some games, save games or save points are part of the plot. In &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, save points are called Records of Fate, managed by an entity called FATE, an antagonist that uses the save points to control people. In &quot;Anonymous;Code&quot;, the protagonist Pollon Takaoka has a unique ability to save and load save games, which is central to the plot and the main game mechanic.

Another way saved games interact with each other is through passing along data to sequels. A famous example of this is the first three installments of the &quot;Wizardry&quot; series. To play the second and third installments, players needed to import the characters they&#x27;d used in the previous installment, which retained all experience and equipment gained in that installment. Later versions of the games made this feature optional, as do franchises such as the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;, &quot;Shenmue&quot; and &quot;.hack&quot; series. Video games may also take the saved games of other video games into account; for example, the character Rosalina becomes available on &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot; if there is a &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; save on the console. The save game of &quot;Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition&quot; can be imported to the Remix version of the game.

==Save sharing==

For many years, sharing game saves among friends has been very common. From trading passwords to swapping memory cards, gamers have always been able to help each other out to unlock features in a game. With the growing popularity of the Internet, many people upload their game saves to help out their online friends. However, with the inclusion of a progress meter or &quot;gamerscore&quot; that tracks player progress in games for the Xbox 360, many players are beginning to view those who load other people&#x27;s files onto their systems as &quot;cheaters&quot;. Some games such as &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; attempt to prevent the use of saved games made by other users. In contrast, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages&quot; actively encourages players that have completed the game to share their progress with others via a password swapping side quest that is available after finishing the main story.

==Arcade games==
Saved games have generally been rare at arcades, but have found some use, notably in the Konami e-Amusement system, Bandai Namco&#x27;s Bandai Namco Passport, or Banapassport system, or by the use of PlayStation cards, as in &quot;Dance Dance Revolution.&quot; These generally use either a magnetic card to store the data, a card that stores data through network (internet) connection or through a server, or some combination thereof. Similarly, passwords have generally been rare at arcades, with occasional exceptions, such as &quot;Gauntlet Legends.&quot;

<doc id="1265027" wikidata="Q2931058" url="?curid=1265027" title="CBVT-DT">
<text>CBVT-DT, virtual channel 11.1 (UHF digital channel 25), branded on-air as ICI Québec, is an Ici Radio-Canada Télé owned-and-operated station licensed to Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The station is owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (known in French as &quot;Société Radio-Canada&quot;). CBVT-DT&#x27;s studios are located on Rue Saint-Jean and Aut Dufferin Montmorency in the Quebec City borough of La Cité-Limoilou, and its transmitter is located on Avenue de la Montagne/Dumont Belair Ouest in Val-Bélair. On cable, the station is available on Vidéotron channel 2 and in high definition on digital channel 602. On satellite, it is carried on Bell Satellite TV channel 111 and in high definition on channel 1813.

==History==
The station, built and signed on by Radio-Canada itself, first aired on September 3, 1964. Quebec City&#x27;s previous Radio-Canada affiliate CFCM-TV became an independent station for a few years before becoming one of the co-founders of TVA in 1971.

The station moved into new studios in 2004, uniting all of CBC/Radio-Canada&#x27;s staff in Quebec City.

==Programming==
For the network, the station produces &quot;La semaine verte&quot;, an hour-long weekly newsmagazine about agriculture and rural life, and &quot;Second regard&quot;, a half-hour program exploring religion and spirituality.

For local programming, an evening newscast under the title &quot;Le Téléjournal/Québec&quot;, airs weekdays at 6:00 p.m.; a weekday noon newscast, &quot;Le Téléjournal midi/Québec et Est du Québec&quot;, is shared with Radio-Canada&#x27;s group of stations in Eastern Quebec.

==Digital television==
After the analogue-to-digital conversion which took place on August 31, 2011, CBVT-DT stayed at its pre-transition position on channel 12, allowing CBVE-TV, a repeater of CBMT-DT Montreal, to move from channel 5 to channel 11. Because of potential interference from CFCF-DT in Montreal (which moved its digital signal to channel 12 on the transition date) and reception problems, CBVT-DT moved to channel 25 in December 2011. Channel 25 was previously used by CIVQ-DT, a local digital repeater of Télé-Québec.

==Transmitters==

CBVT had seven analogue television rebroadcasters in the communities near Quebec City.

Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analogue transmitters on July 31, 2012. None of CBC or Radio-Canada&#x27;s television re-transmitters were converted to digital.

CBVT&#x27;s main transmitter site for Quebec City is located at Mount Bélair.

<text>The 2003 Bavarian state election was held on 21 September 2003 to elect the members to the 15th Landtag of Bavaria. The Christian Social Union (CSU) led by Minister-President Edmund Stoiber achieved the largest majority in German history, winning 69% of the seats in the Landtag. This election was the first and to date only time a single party won a two-thirds supermajority of seats in any German state parliament. The CSU also won its largest proportion of the popular vote since 1974, at 60.7%.

The election was marked by a major decline in turnout, falling by almost 13 points to 57%. As a result, despite achieving its best result in decades, the CSU won 230,000 votes fewer than it had in the 1998 election.

<text>PlatEAU is an electronic music project featuring cEvin Key and Phil Western. The project resembles a very loose approach to the Download project featuring the same members. The song names and album titles refer to the coffeeshop culture of Amsterdam in The Netherlands implying a &quot;trip&quot; through their musical voyages. The album art also reflects this concept with imagery on their first release on Hypnotic Records in 1997, &quot;Music for Grass Bars&quot;. This release had a special CD jewel case in order to create a holographic-motion effect with the cover art insert. The genre is most closely related to IDM, experimental, techno and trip hop.

<text>Zyndram z Maszkowic (&quot;Zyndram of Maszkowice&quot;, c. 1355 – c. 1414) was a Polish 14th and 15th century knight. His coat of arms was Słońce.

Zyndram was first mentioned in 1388 as a mayor of Jasło. He bought the post from a certain Jakusz Trzop for 100 grzywnas. He was also the Sword-bearer of the Crown. In February 1390, Zyndram took part in the military campaign against the Teutonic Order. The following year, he was yet again called to arms and took part in several battles against the Order in Lithuania and northern Poland.

Zyndram was ordered to organize the defense of a nodal castle of Kamieniec Litewski, east of the Białowieża Forest. Probably for successfully fulfilling this task, he was promoted to the starost of Jasło. In 1409, Zyndram was called to arms by king Władysław II Jagiełło to take part in his offensive against the Teutons. During the famous Battle of Grunwald of 1410, Zyndram was the Grand Camp Leader of the Crown and commander of the Banner of Kraków, composed of elite troops and holding the banner of the whole army. According to &quot;Historiæ Polonicæ&quot; by Ioannes Longinus, it was the unit commanded by Zyndram that killed the Teutonic commander, Ulrich von Jungingen. For many years, it was also believed that he was commander of all Polish troops in the battle, but recent research proved that this was but a wrong translation of Longinus&#x27; chronicle. His part in the battle was also described by Henryk Sienkiewicz in his novel &quot;The Teutonic Knights&quot;.

After the campaign, Zyndram returned to his domain. In 1413, he extended his domain by renting the village of Przesiecznica from the bishop of Przemyśl in exchange for the defense of the area against the Tartars and bandits from the Beskids. The exact date of his death is unknown, however on 5 June 1414 his wife, Anna, was mentioned as &quot;Widow of Zyndram&quot;.

<text>The 2001 Berlin state election was held on 21 October 2001 to elect the members of the 15th Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin. Prior to the election, Mayor Klaus Wowereit had led a minority government of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and The Greens since June, which had replaced a coalition between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and SPD which collapsed in June. The SPD–Green government made gains, but remained short of a majority. The SPD first sought to form a traffic light coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and Greens, but were unsuccessful. They subsequently agreed to a government with the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS).

==Parties==
The table below lists parties represented in the 14th Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin.
==Issues and campaign==
The 2001 election was an early election. In June 2001, the grand coalition under Mayor Eberhard Diepgen (CDU) broke down following a scandal involving CDU&#x27;s leader in the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin, . Landowsky, who served as the CEO of a public mortgage bank (later Landesbank Berlin Holding), had financed a risky deal between two men who were donors to the local CDU branch. The cost the city several billion euros. The SPD subsequently left the coalition, which had governed Berlin since 1990, and formed an interim minority government with the Greens supported by the PDS. Klaus Wowereit became Mayor after a constructive vote of no confidence against Diepgen on 15 June. The House of Deputies then voted to dissolve itself, triggering a new election.

The campaign was strongly influenced by the bad state of the public finances and the bank scandal. The CDU nominated 35-year-old Frank Steffel as their top candidate, and played on fears of potential PDS involvement in government. They also focused on security issues, especially after September 11 attacks.

The regional broadcaster Sender Freies Berlin accompanied the election campaign on its website with a &quot;Wahltest&quot; app, marking the first time in Germany that a Voting Advice Application was used.

<doc id="1265096" wikidata="Q1338993" url="?curid=1265096" title="George R. Lawrence">
<text>George Raymond Lawrence (February 24, 1868 – December 15, 1938) was an American commercial photographer of northern Illinois. After years of experience building kites and balloons for aerial panoramic photography, Lawrence turned to aviation design in 1910.

==Life==
The Lawrences are descended from John Philip Lorenz, who had emigrated from Germany in 1748. George was born in Ottawa, Illinois, on February 24, 1868. He was the eldest of six children of Margaret Othelia Tritley and Michael B. Lawrence. Michael was a LaSalle County farmer and a carpenter. Within a few years, the family moved sixty miles east to a Kankakee County farm. George went to school through the eighth-grade in the nearby town of Manteno, Illinois. He also attended St. Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Manteno.

Around 1890, he moved to Chicago and began working at the Abbott Buggy Co. factory in Auburn, Illinois. There, he invented a method of attaching iron rims on wooden wheels. In 1890, Lawrence married Alice Herenden and they had two children: Raymond W. Lawrence and George Lee Lawrence. In 1891, he opened The Lawrence Portrait Studio at the corner of Yale Avenue and 63rd Street, sharing the space and expenses with fellow photographer Irwin W. Powell.

In the mid-1890s, Lawrence perfected the use of &quot;flashlight photography&quot;, which was the norm until flashbulbs were invented years later. In 1900, he built the world&#x27;s largest camera to take a photograph of the Alton Limited Train, owned by the Chicago &amp; Alton Railway. The camera weighed 1400 pounds (640 kg) and used a 4.5′ × 8′ glass-plate negative. The photograph was taken for the 1900 Exposition Universelle (Paris Exposition of 1900) in Paris, France and won &quot;The Grand Prize of the World&quot;. He also made innovations in areas of aerial photography such as ballooning and camera–carrying kites.

==San Francisco photo==
One of Lawrence&#x27;s world-renowned photographs is of the ruins of San Francisco, California after the 1906 earthquake. It is a 160-degree panorama from a kite taken 2000 feet (600 m) in the air above the San Francisco Bay that showed the entire city on a single 17-by-48-inch contact print made from a single piece of film. Each print sold for $125 and Lawrence made at least $15,000 (US$ in 2025) in sales from this one photograph. The camera used in this photograph weighed 49 pounds (22 kg) and used a celluloid-film plate.

In 2006, Juneau-based photographer Ronald Klein built a working replica of Lawrence&#x27;s camera and used it to rephotograph San Francisco from about the same location (but from a helicopter, not a kite), 100 years after the earthquake. The rephotograph was actually taken by Mark Walsh, George R. Lawrence&#x27;s great grandson, who rode in the helicopter, held the camera, and clicked the shutter.

==Marriage, remarriage, and death==

In 1909, while he was away on an expensive and frustrating adventure attempting to take aerial photographs of wild animals in British East Africa, his wife found that he had been having an affair with one of his secretaries. Upon his return, he fled to California, taking his sons with him. He then turned from photography to aviation, building an aircraft at a factory in Chicago. He would be granted nearly a hundred patents for aviation-related devices.

He divorced his first wife, Alice Herendeen, in 1913 (with whom he had had two children, Raymond Welcome Lawrence and George Lee Lawrence), and married Adele Frances &quot;Della&quot; Page in 1916. She was born in St. Louis, Missouri and was the daughter of Henry J. Page, an architect. George Lawrence was 48 years old and Della was 22 years old when they married. They had four daughters: Clara Antoinette, Virginia Lee, Ruth Adele, and Martha &quot;Louise&quot; Lawrence.

Lawrence&#x27;s aircraft company folded in 1919. He died in 1938, aged 70, and funeral services were held at St. Gertrude&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Chicago. He was buried at St. Joseph&#x27;s Cemetery in Manteno, Illinois.

<text>Human security is a paradigm for understanding global vulnerabilities whose proponents challenge the traditional notion of national security through military security by arguing that the proper referent for security should be at the human rather than the national level. Human security reveals a people-centred and multi-disciplinary understanding of security which involves a number of research fields, including development studies, international relations, strategic studies, and human rights. The United Nations Development Programme&#x27;s 1994 Human Development Report is considered a milestone publication in the field of human security, with its argument that ensuring &quot;freedom from want&quot; and &quot;freedom from fear&quot; for all persons is the best path to tackle the problem of global insecurity.

Critics of the concept argue that its vagueness undermines its effectiveness, that it has become little more than a vehicle for activists wishing to promote certain causes, and that it does not help the research community understand what security means or help decision-makers to formulate good policies. Alternatively, other scholars have argued that the concept of human security should be broadened to encompass military security: &#x27;In other words, if this thing called &#x27;human security&#x27; has the concept of &#x27;the human&#x27; embedded at the heart of it, then let us address the question of the human condition directly. Thus understood, human security would no longer be the vague amorphous add-on to harder-edged areas of security such as military security or state security.&#x27;

In order for human security to challenge global inequalities, there has to be cooperation between a country&#x27;s foreign policy and its approach to global health. However, the interest of the state has continued to overshadow the interest of the people. For instance, Canada&#x27;s foreign policy, &quot;three Ds&quot;, has been criticized for emphasizing defense more than development.

==Origins==
The emergence of the human security discourse was the product of a convergence of factors at the end of the Cold War. These challenged the dominance of the neorealist paradigm&#x27;s focus on states, &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot; and military security and briefly enabled a broader concept of security to emerge. The increasingly rapid pace of globalization; the failure of liberal state-building through the instruments of the Washington Consensus; the reduced threat of nuclear war between the superpowers, and the exponential rise in the spread and consolidation of democratization and international human rights norms opened a space in which both &#x27;development&#x27; and concepts of &#x27;security&#x27; could be reconsidered.

At the same time, the increasing number of internal violent conflicts in Africa, Asia and Europe (Balkans) resulted in concepts of national and international security failing to reflect the challenges of the post Cold War security environment whilst the failure of neoliberal development models to generate growth, particularly in Africa, or to deal with the consequences of complex new threats (such as HIV and climate change) reinforced the sense that international institutions and states were not organized to address such problems in an integrated way.

The principal possible indicators of movement toward an individualized conception of security lie in the first place in the evolution of international society&#x27;s consideration of rights of individuals in the face of potential threats from states. The most obvious foci of analysis here are the UN Charter, the UN Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and its associated covenants (1966), and conventions related to particular crimes (e.g., genocide) and the rights of particular groups (e.g., women, racial groups, and refugees).

==Concept==

===UNDP&#x27;s 1994 definition===
Mahbub ul Haq first drew global attention to the concept of human security in the United Nations Development Programme&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Human Development Report&quot; and sought to influence the UN&#x27;s 1995 World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen. The UNDP&#x27;s 1994 Human Development Report&#x27;s definition of human security argues that the scope of global security should be expanded to include &quot;threats in seven areas&quot;:
*Economic security – Economic security requires an assured basic income for individuals, usually from productive and remunerative work or, as a last resort, from a publicly financed safety net. In this sense, only about a quarter of the world&#x27;s people are presently economically secure. While the economic security problem may be more serious in developing countries, concern also arises in developed countries as well. Unemployment problems constitute an important factor underlying political tensions and ethnic violence.
*Food security – Food security requires that all people at all times have both physical and economic access to basic food. According to the United Nations, the overall availability of food is not a problem, rather the problem often is the poor distribution of food and a lack of purchasing power. In the past, food security problems have been dealt with at both national and global levels. However, their impacts are limited. According to the UN, the key is to tackle the problems relating to access to assets, work and assured income (related to economic security).
*Health security – Health security aims to guarantee a minimum protection from diseases and unhealthy lifestyles. In developing countries, the major causes of death traditionally were infectious and parasitic diseases, whereas in industrialized countries, the major killers were diseases of the circulatory system. Today, lifestyle-related chronic diseases are leading killers worldwide, with 80 percent of deaths from chronic diseases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. According to the United Nations, in both developing and industrial countries, threats to health security are usually greater for poor people in rural areas, particularly children. This is due to malnutrition and insufficient access to health services, clean water and other basic necessities.
*Environmental security – Environmental security aims to protect people from the short- and long-term ravages of nature, man-made threats in nature, and deterioration of the natural environment. In developing countries, lack of access to clean water resources is one of the greatest environmental threats. In industrial countries, one of the major threats is air pollution. Global warming, caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, is another environmental security issue.
*Personal security – Personal security aims to protect people from physical violence, whether from the state or external states, from violent individuals and sub-state actors, from domestic abuse, or from predatory adults. For many people, the greatest source of anxiety is crime, particularly violent crime.
*Community security – Community security aims to protect people from the loss of traditional relationships and values and from sectarian and ethnic violence. Traditional communities, particularly minority ethnic groups are often threatened. About half of the world&#x27;s states have experienced some inter-ethnic strife. The United Nations declared 1993 the Year of Indigenous People to highlight the continuing vulnerability of the 300 million Aboriginal people in 70 countries as they face a widening spiral of violence.
*Political security – Political security is concerned with whether people live in a society that honors their basic human rights. According to a survey conducted by Amnesty International, political repression, systematic torture, ill-treatment, or disappearance was still practised in 110 countries. Human rights violations are most frequent during periods of political unrest. Along with repressing individuals and groups, governments may try to exercise control over ideas and information.

Since then, human security has been receiving more attention from key global development institutions, such as the World Bank. Tadjbakhsh, among others, traces the evolution of human security in international organizations, concluding that the concept has been manipulated and transformed considerably since 1994 to fit organizational interests.

===Freedom from Fear vs Freedom from Want and beyond===
In an ideal world, each of the UNDP&#x27;s seven categories of threats (and perhaps others as a broader discussion might prioritize) would receive adequate global attention and resources. Yet attempts to implement this human security agenda have led to the emergence of two major schools of thought on how to best practice human security – &#x27;&quot;Freedom from Fear&quot;&#x27; and &#x27;&quot;Freedom from Want&quot;&#x27;. While the UNDP 1994 report originally argued that human security requires attention to both &quot;freedom from fear&quot; and &quot;freedom from want,&quot; divisions have gradually emerged over the proper scope of that protection (e.g. over what individuals should be protected from) and over the appropriate mechanisms for responding to these threats.

*Freedom from Fear – This school seeks to limit the practice of Human Security to protecting individuals from violent conflicts while recognizing that these violent threats are strongly associated with poverty, lack of state capacity and other forms of inequities. This approach argues that limiting the focus to violence is a realistic and manageable approach towards Human Security. Emergency assistance, conflict prevention and resolution, and peace-building are the main concerns of this approach. Canada, for example, was a critical player in the efforts to ban landmines and has incorporated the &quot;Freedom from Fear&quot; agenda as a primary component in its own foreign policy. However, whether such a “narrow” approach can truly serve its purpose in guaranteeing more fruitful results remains to be an issue. For instance, the conflicts in Darfur are often used in questioning the effectiveness of the &quot;Responsibility to Protect”, a key component of the Freedom from Fear agenda.
*Freedom from Want – The school advocates a holistic approach in achieving human security and argues that the threat agenda should be broadened to include hunger, disease and natural disasters because they are inseparable concepts in addressing the root of human insecurity and they kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. Different from &quot;Freedom from Fear&quot;, it expands the focus beyond violence with emphasis on development and security goals.

Despite their differences, these two approaches to human security can be considered complementary rather than contradictory. Expressions to this effect include:

*Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s famous Four Freedoms speech of 1941, in which &quot;Freedom from Want&quot; is characterized as the third and &quot;Freedom from Fear&quot; is the fourth such fundamental, universal, freedom.
*The Government of Japan considers Freedom from Fear and Freedom from Want to be equal in developing Japan&#x27;s foreign policy. Moreover, the UNDP 1994 called for the world&#x27;s attention to both agendas.
*Surin Pitsuwan, the Secretary-General of ASEAN in 2008-2012 cites theorists such as Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Hume to conclude that &quot;human security is the primary purpose of organizing a state in the beginning.&quot;. He goes on to observe that the 1994 Human Development Report states that it is &quot;reviving this concept&quot; and suggests that the authors of the 1994 HDR may be alluding to Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Four Freedoms speech without literally citing that presentation.

Although &quot;freedom from fear&quot; and &quot;freedom from want&quot; are the most commonly referred to categories of human security practice, an increasing number of alternative ideas continue to emerge on how to best practice human security. Among them:
*Paul James. James asks two apparently simple questions: Firstly, why, if &#x27;the human’ as a category by definition encompasses all considerations of governance, the state and the military, does military security continue to be treated as prior, more significant, or even equal to human security. By contrast, &quot;when children play ‘category’ games&quot;, he says, &quot;they implicitly understand such issues of ordering&quot;. Secondly, why does human security get narrowly defined in terms of liberal notions of &#x27;freedom&#x27;: freedom from want and freedom from fear? In response to these two questions, he provides the following alternative definition, with human security encompassing military security:
::Human security can be defined as one of the foundational conditions of being human, including both (1) the sustainable protection and provision of the material conditions for meeting the embodied needs of people, and (2) the protection of the variable existential conditions for maintaining a dignified life. Within this definition, it then makes sense that the core focus of human-security endeavours should be on the most vulnerable. It makes sense that risk management should be most responsive to immediate events or processes that have both an extensive and intensive impact in producing material and existential vulnerabilities of people in general or a category of persons across a particular locale.
*G. King and C. Murray. King and Murray try to narrow down the human security definition to one&#x27;s &quot;expectation of years of life without experiencing the state of generalized poverty&quot;. In their definition, the &quot;generalized poverty&quot; means &quot;falling below critical thresholds in any domain of well-being&quot;; and it is in the same article, they give a brief review and categories of &quot;Domains of Well-being&quot;. This set of definitions is similar to &quot;freedom from want&quot; but more concretely focused on some value system.
*Caroline Thomas. She regards human security as describing &quot;a condition of existence&quot; which entails basic material needs, human dignity, including meaningful participation in the life of the community, and an active and substantive notion of democracy from the local to the global.
*Roland Paris. He argues that many ways to define &quot;human security&quot; are related to a certain set of values and lose the neutral position. So he suggests to take human security as a category of research. As such, he gives a 2*2 matrix to illustrate the security studies field.
*Sabina Alkire. Different with those approaches seek to narrow down and specify the objective of human security, Sabina Alkire pushes the idea a step further as &quot;to safeguard the vital core of all human lives from critical pervasive threats, without impeding long-term human fulfilment&quot;. In a concept as such, she suggests the &quot;vital core&quot; cover a minimal or basic or fundamental set of functions related to survival, livelihood and dignity; and all institutions should at least and necessarily protect the core from any intervention.
*Lyal S. Sunga. In 2009, Professor Sunga argued that a concept of human security that is fully informed by international human rights law, international humanitarian law, international criminal law and international refugee law, and which takes into account the relevant international legal norms prohibiting the use of force in international relations, will likely prove more valuable to international legal theory and practice over the longer term, than a concept of human security which does not meet these conditions because these fields of law represent the objectified political will of States rather than the more subjective biases of scholars.
The first university textbook of human security, edited by Alexander Lautensach and Sabina Lautensach, appeared in open access form in 2020. According to their Four Pillar Model, human security rests on the four pillars of sociopolitical security, economic security, environmental security and health security. Because of its focus on the long term as well as on immediate needs, the environmental pillar of human security assumes prime significance. It necessitates our attention to the utter dependence of human welfare on the integrity of ecological support structures.

===Relationship with traditional security===

Coined in the early 1990s, the term human security has been used by thinkers who have sought to shift the discourse on security away from its traditional state-centered orientation to the protection and advancement of individuals within societies. Human security emerged as a challenge to ideas of traditional security, but human and traditional or national security are not mutually exclusive concepts. It has been argued that, without human security, traditional state security cannot be attained and vice versa.
Traditional security is about a state&#x27;s ability to defend itself against external threats. Traditional security (often referred to as national security or state security) describes the philosophy of international security predominance since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 and the rise of the nation-states. While international relations theory includes many variants of traditional security, from realism to liberalism, the fundamental trait that these schools share is their focus on the primacy of the nation-state.

The following table contrasts four differences between the two perspectives:

===Relationship with development===

Human security also challenged and drew from the practice of international development.

Traditionally, embracing liberal market economics was considered to be the universal path for economic growth, and thus development for all humanity. Yet, continuing conflict and human rights abuses following the end of the Cold War and the fact that two-thirds of the global population seemed to have gained little from the economic gains of globalization, led to fundamental questions about the way development was practiced. Accordingly, human development has emerged in the 1990s to challenge the dominant paradigm of liberal economy in the development community. Human development proponents argue that economic growth is insufficient to expand people&#x27;s choices or capabilities, areas such as health, education, technology, the environment, and employment should not be neglected.

Human security could be said to further enlarge the scope for examining the causes and consequences of underdevelopment, by seeking to bridge the divide between development and security. Too often, militaries didn&#x27;t address or factor in the underlying causes of violence and insecurity while development workers often underplayed the vulnerability of development models to violent conflict. Human security springs from a growing consensus that these two fields need to be more fully integrated in order to enhance security for all.

The paper &quot;Development and Security&quot; by Frances Stewart argues that security and development are deeply interconnected.
*&quot;Human security forms an important part of people’s well-being, and is therefore an objective of development.&quot;&lt;br&gt; An objective of development is “the enlargement of human choices”. Insecurity cuts life short and thwarts the use of human potential, thereby affecting the reaching of this objective.
*&quot;Lack of human security has adverse consequences on economic growth, and therefore development.&quot;&lt;br&gt; Some development costs are obvious. For example, in wars, people who join the army or flee can no longer work productively. Also, destroying infrastructure reduces the productive capacity of the economy.
*&quot;Imbalanced development that involves horizontal inequalities is an important source of conflict.&quot;&lt;br&gt; Therefore, vicious cycles of lack of development which leads to conflict, then to lack of development, can readily emerge. Likewise, virtuous cycles are possible, with high levels of security leading to development, which further promotes security in return.

Further, it could also be said that the practice of human development and human security share three fundamental elements:

* First, human security and human development are both people-centered. They challenge the orthodox approach to security and development i.e. state security and liberal economic growth respectively. Both emphasize people are to be the ultimate ends but not means. Both treat humans as agents and should be empowered to participate in the course.
* Second, both perspectives are multidimensional. Both address people&#x27;s dignity as well as their material and physical concerns.
* Third, both schools of thought consider poverty and inequality as the root causes of individual vulnerability.

Despite these similarities, the relationship with development is one of the most contested areas of human security. &quot;Freedom from fear&quot; advocates, such as Andrew Mack, argue that human security should focus on the achievable goals of decreasing individual vulnerability to violent conflict, rather than broadly defined goals of economic and social development. Others, such as Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy, argue that human development and human security are inextricably linked since progress in one enhances the chances of progress in another while failure in one increases the risk of failure of another.

The following table is adopted from Tadjbakhsh to help clarify the relationship between these two concepts.
===Relationship with human rights===

Human security is indebted to the human rights tradition (the ideas of natural law and natural rights). The development of the human security model can be seen to have drawn upon ideas and concepts fundamental to the human rights tradition. Both approaches use the individual as the main referent and both argue that a wide range of issues (i.e. civil rights, cultural identity, access to education and healthcare) are fundamental to human dignity. A major difference between the two models is in their approach to addressing threats to human dignity and survival. Whilst the human rights framework takes a legalistic approach, the human security framework, by utilizing a diverse range of actors, adopts flexible and issue-specific approaches, which can operate at local, national or international levels.

The nature of the relationship between human security and human rights is contested among human security advocates. Some human security advocates argue that the goal of human security should be to build upon and strengthen the existing global human rights legal framework. However, other advocates view the human rights legal framework as part of the global insecurity problem and believe that a human security approach should propel us to move above and beyond this legalistic approach to get at the underlying sources of inequality and violence which are the root causes of insecurity in today&#x27;s world.

===Relationship with non-governmental organizations===
See also: Non-governmental organization

The term NGO (Non-Government Organisation) cannot be simply defined due to complexities surrounding its structure, environment and complex relations it shares with its internal factions; being its organisational mission, membership and sources of funding, and external factors such as the relationship it shares with actors; detailing the economic, political and societal constructs they may be bound by. A generic understanding of the term may refer to the actions taken in the interests of independent, voluntary contributors which exist independently from governments and corporations, designed to represent and provide a collective voice to individuals regarding issues. These issues cover contributions to the fields and industries of human development, health and nutrition, human rights and education, and environmental concerns; all of which influence and affect human security.

The traditional roles of NGOs may be classified into three components, in accordance with Lewis:

- Implementer: refers to the mobilisation of resources in order to aid the provision of goods and services, such as the act of service delivery.

- Catalyst: refers to the emotional and psychological aspect of the NGOs ability to inspire, facilitate or contribute to spur action or thinking.

- Partner: refers to the NGOs relationships shared with external actors such as governments, donors or the private sector players through joint activities, or projects with communities, with the purpose to strengthen the relationship between the NGOs and these partners in a mutually beneficial fashion.

The expansion of these roles have culminated in assisting the creation of a society where NGOs serve as important players in the global arena in regards to maintaining human security. Due to this increasing influence and the emergence of growing natural and man-made disasters, NGOs now are contracted by governments in order to adequately respond to crises, as well as assist individual or collectivised groups of citizens in lobbying their interests; thus culminating in the ability to enact, influence and change government agendas. However, NGOs are still largely dependent on certain levels of government funding, hence critics may argue that NGOs pose the ability to potentially damage issues of human security due to this financial dependence. Despite these critiques, the focus, expertise and infrastructure developed by NGOs through their activities linked with human development and human rights allow them to make unique contributions to human security provision.

===Relationship with the environment===
Comprehensive human security attempts to unify environmental security together with social (societal) security. A great number of intertwined environmental and social components together create the framework for comprehensive human security under the assumption that neither of those two categories is attainable in the long run without synergy between the two. That is to say that the trends in environmental, resource, and population stresses are intensifying and will increasingly determine the quality of human life on our planet and as such are a large determining factor of our social security.

Arthur H. Westing posits that the two interdependent branches of comprehensive human security can be broken down into a series of subcomponents to better achieve optimal environmental and social security. 
Environmental security is composed of two subcomponents: (a) Rational resource utilization, that is resource use that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” 
Social security can be simplified to components of (a) Established political safeguards, (b) Economic safeguards, (c) Personal safeguards, and (d) Military safeguards.

The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) states that a major goal of comprehensive human security is to “transmit practical recommendations to policy-makers on how to strengthen human security through better environmental management and more effective natural resource governance.” The overreaching goal being a pervasive global mindset that recognizes the interdependent natures of the natural environment and our collective social security.

===Gender and human security===
Human security focuses on the serious neglect of gender concerns under the traditional security model. Traditional security&#x27;s focus on external military threats to the state has meant that the majority of threats women face have been overlooked. It has recently been argued that these forms of violence are often overlooked because expressions of masculinity in contexts of war have become the norm. By focusing on the individual, the human security model aims to address the security concerns of both women and men equally. However, as of recent conflicts, it is believed that the majority of war casualties are civilians and that &quot;such a conclusion has sometimes led to the assumptions that women are victimized by war to a greater extent than men, because the majority of adult civilians are women, and when the populations of civilian women and children are added together, they outnumber male combatants. Furthermore, in the post-war context women survivors generally outnumber men and so it is often said that women as a group bear a greater burden for post-war recovery&quot;. Women are often victims of violence and conflict: they form the majority of civilian deaths; the majority of refugees; and, are often the victims of cruel and degrading practices, such as rape. Women&#x27;s security is also threatened by unequal access to resources, services and opportunities. The UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, as of 1995, suggested that the problem is not just a social one, but requires evaluation of the political institutions which uphold the unequal system of domination. Women&#x27;s rights are neglected especially in the Middle East and Southeast Asian regions where customary practices are still prevalent. Although there are different opinions on the issue of customary practices, it infringes upon human security&#x27;s notion that women and men are innated with equal human rights. Attempts to eradicate such violent customary practices require political and legal approaches where human security in relation to gender should be brought up as the main source of assertion. Such cruel customary practices as honor killing, burning brides and widows, child marriage are still in existence because of women&#x27;s vulnerability in economic independence and security. Human security in relationship to gender tries to overthrow such traditional practices that are incompatible to the rights of women. Also, human security seeks to empower women, through education, participation and access, as gender equality is seen as a necessary precondition for peace, security and a prosperous society.

During times of conflict, certain varieties of masculinity come to be celebrated by the State, and these varieties of behaviors can influence how a population&#x27;s combatants come to behave, or are expected to behave during crises. These behaviors range from acting aggressively and exemplifying hyper-masculine behaviors, to playing upon the rise of &quot;nationalist or ethnic consciousness&quot; to secure &quot;political support for the cause and to undermine &quot;the Other&quot;. Overtly militaristic societies have utilized rape and other sexually violent acts to further their gains within the context of war, but also by using such practices of violence as rewards to the (often male) combatants. This tactic undermines the enemy&#x27;s morale, as they are seen as &quot;unable to protect their women&quot;.

==== The category of human ====
Recent feminist critiques of Human Security often find difficulties with the concept and categorization of &quot;Human&quot;. This categorization is made under the influence of certain value systems which are inherently exclusive by their nature. For instance, the liberal definition of &quot;human&quot; is: someone that is independent and capable of making decisions for themselves. This definition is problematic because it excludes persons who are not independent, such as persons with disabilities, from human security rights. If Human Security was to be entirely inclusive it would need to challenge the current definition of &quot;human&quot; on which it operates and acknowledge that different abilities also require rights.

==== Eurocentrism ====
The concept of human security has developed out of the precepts put forth by the United Nations, wherein there has been a critique of Human Security&#x27;s focus on what is deemed acceptable behaviors. Human security perspectives view practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation as a threat to human (more specifically female) security and well-being in the Global North, while it is more common that these events occur predominately in the Global Southern states. Thus it is seen by states with a traditional human security outlook, to see it as their duty to intervene and perpetuate this eurocentric ideal of what human security looks like, and what is best to protect the familiar concept of women. This can be seen as an infringement on the traditional practices found within some sovereign states of the Global South, and a threat to ways of life and processes of development.
===Prevent, react, and rebuild===

Human security seeks to address underlying causes and long-term implications of conflicts instead of simply reacting to problems, as the traditional security approach is often accused of doing. &quot;The basic point of preventive efforts is, of course, to reduce, and hopefully eliminate, the need for intervention altogether,&quot; while an investment in rehabilitation or rebuilding seeks to ensure that former conflicts do not breed future violence. The concepts of prevention and rebuilding are clearly embraced as the “responsibility to prevent” and well elaborated in &quot;The Responsibility to protect report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty.&quot;

==Relationship with humanitarian action==

In several senses there is a natural fit between human security concepts and humanitarian principles. The concern with the protection of people or individuals is a core humanitarian value as well as of human security. In this sense it shares human security&#x27;s merging of development and security and the casting of the protection of life as the referent object.

Human security and humanitarian action also shared a similar process of evolution. The rise of the human security discourse in the 1990s paralleled an equally rapid expansion in humanitarian roles and a broadening in the objectives of humanitarianism that was labeled the ‘new humanitarianism’. Humanitarian assistance, once encompassing a narrow set of emergency-based life-saving interventions conducted by a small group of relatively independent actors, became ‘an organising principle for intervention in internal conflicts, a tool for peacebuilding and the starting point for addressing poverty, as well as a palliative in times of conflict and crisis.’ It also merged with development concerns such as the promotion of social justice and societal cohesion.

The human security discourse was also used as a tool to resist aid policies becoming hijacked by narrow security concerns. States, such as the Republic of Ireland, promoted the Human Security concept as a way to ensure a more balanced approach to security and development issues both nationally and within the EU.

Despite the sense of a natural fit between human security concepts and humanitarian principles, they have enjoyed a difficult relationship. Human security perspectives have the potential to interfere with the traditionally apolitical nature of humanitarianism in conflict situations, leading to a blurring of the boundaries between politico-military interventions and those designed primarily to reduce suffering. In another sense the emphasis on human security has legitimised the idea of armed international intervention as a &quot;moral duty&quot; if states are deemed incapable or unwilling to protect their citizens. Similarly, the adoption of &#x27;holistic&#x27; security and development strategies within UN Integrated peacekeeping missions is viewed by some as having the potential to compromise humanitarian principles.

Authors such as White and Cliffe drew attention to the way in which the &#x27;broadening of aid objectives from pure survival support towards rehabilitation, development and/ or peace-building&#x27; led to the &#x27;dilution of commitment to core humanitarian principles&#x27;. Furthermore, many humanitarian organisations have sought to develop rights-based approaches to assistance strategies which challenge the apolitical approach of traditional humanitarianism. Rights-based approaches view poverty and vulnerability as rooted in power relations – specifically, the denial of power, which is itself related to the denial of human rights. Hence rights-based approaches to humanitarian action relate the achievement of security for marginalized people to the realization of their human rights and often to broader social change. Multimandate humanitarian organisations that seek more inclusive and participatory forms of citizenship and governance and the achievement of broader social rights outcomes, therefore, risk enmeshing apolitical humanitarian responses in advocacy programmes that push for broader social changes.

==Practice==

While there are numerous examples of the human security approach in action, two notable global political events with direct ties to the human security agenda include the development of Responsibility to Protect (R3P) principles guiding humanitarian intervention and the passage of the Ottawa Treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.

===Humanitarian intervention===
The application of human security is highly relevant within the area of humanitarian intervention, as it focuses on addressing the deep-rooted and multi-factorial problems inherent in humanitarian crises, and offers more long-term resolutions. In general, the term humanitarian intervention generally applies to when a state uses force against another state in order to alleviate suffering in the latter state (See, humanitarian intervention).

Under the traditional security paradigm, humanitarian intervention is contentious. As discussed above, the traditional security paradigm places emphasis on the notion of states. Hence, the principles of state sovereignty and non-intervention that are paramount in the traditional security paradigm make it difficult to justify the intervention of other states in internal disputes. Through the development of clear principles based on the human security concept, there has been a step forward in the development of clear rules of when humanitarian intervention can occur and the obligations of states that intervene in the internal disputes of a state.

These principles on humanitarian intervention are the product of a debate pushed by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. He posed a challenge to the international community to find a new approach to humanitarian intervention that responded to its inherent problems. In 2001, the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) produced the &quot;Responsibility to protect&quot;, a comprehensive report detailing how the “right of humanitarian intervention” could be exercised. It was considered a triumph for the human security approach as it emphasized and gathered much needed attention to some of its main principles:

*The protection of individual welfare is more important than the state. If the security of individuals is threatened internally by the state or externally by other states, state authority can be overridden.
*Addressing the root causes of humanitarian crises (e.g. economic, political or social instability) is a more effective way to solve problems and protect the long-term security of individuals.
*Prevention is the best solution. A collective understanding of the deeper social issues along with a desire to work together is necessary to prevent humanitarian crises, thereby preventing a widespread absence of human security within a population (which may mean investing more in development projects).

The report illustrates the usefulness of the human security approach, particularly its ability to examine the cause of conflicts that explain and justify humanitarian intervention. In addition, it could also act as a paradigm for identifying, prioritizing and resolving large transnational problems, one of the fundamental factors that act as a stimulus for humanitarian intervention in the first place. However, human security still faces difficulties concerning the scope of its applicability, as large problems requiring humanitarian intervention usually are built up from an array of socio-political, cultural and economic problems that may be beyond the limitations of humanitarian projects. On the other hand, successful examples of the use of human security principles within interventions can be found.

The success of humanitarian intervention in international affairs is varied. As discussed above, humanitarian intervention is a contentious issue. Examples of humanitarian intervention illustrate, that in some cases intervention can lead to disastrous results, as in Srebrenica and Somalia. In other cases, a lack of clarity as to the rules of when intervention can occur has resulted in tragic inaction, as was witnessed during the Rwandan genocide. One example of a successful humanitarian intervention and also of humanitarian principles being applied is East Timor which, prior to its independence, was plagued with massive human rights abuses by pro-Indonesian militias and an insurgency war led by indigenous East Timorese against Indonesian forces. A peacekeeping mission was deployed to safeguard the move to independence and the UN established the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This not only dealt with traditional security priorities, but also helped in nation-building projects, coordinated humanitarian aid and civil rehabilitation, illustrating not only a successful humanitarian intervention but also an effective application of human security principles.

===Anti-personnel landmines===

In contrast to the traditional security discourse which sees security as focused on protecting state interests, human security proponents believe that Anti-personnel mines could not be viable weapons of war due to the massive collateral damage they cause, their indiscriminate nature and persistence after conflict. In particular, they argue that anti-personnel mines differ from most weapons, which have to be aimed and fired since they have the potential to kill and maim long after the warring parties have ceased fighting. The United Nations has reckoned that landmines are at least ten times more likely to kill or injure a civilian after a conflict than a combatant during hostilities. The effects are also long-lasting. The ICBL estimates that anti-personnel mines were the cause of 5,751 casualties in 2006. Whereas traditionally, states would justify these negative impacts of mines due to the advantage they give on the battlefield, under the human security lens, this is untenable as the wide-ranging post-conflict impact on the day-to-day experience of individuals outweighs the military advantage.

The Ottawa Convention, which led to the banning of anti-personnel landmines, is seen as a victory for the Human Security agenda. The Ottawa Convention has proved to be a huge step forward in the &#x27;Freedom from Fear&#x27; approach. In Ottawa, the negotiations were moved outside traditional disarmament forums, thus avoiding the entrenched logic of traditional arms control measures.
According to Don Hubert, an advocate of Human Security from the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, the main reason for its success was a multilateral focus. While INGO&#x27;s like the UN and the ICRC remain the key players along with middle power states like Norway and Canada, its actual power and push comes from the involvement of a host of civil society actors (NGOs) and the general public. Human Security proponents believe that this treaty has set new standards in humanitarian advocacy and has acted as a landmark in international lawmaking for a more secure world.

Critics of the treaty, however, caution against complacency on its success. Many states, they point out, have neither signed nor ratified this convention. They include China, Russia and the United States who are major contributors to the global weapons trade. Second, even though there were a diverse group of civil society actors, the real influence on the treaty came from the ones in the &#x27;global north&#x27;. Third, cynics may argue that the success of this campaign stems from the fact that these weapons were outdated and of limited military value and this treaty just helped to accelerate a process that would have happened anyway.

==Criticism==

In making an assessment of the pros and cons of the human security concept, Walter Dorn includes several additional criticisms. In particular, he asks whether it is in fact as radical a departure in foreign policy terms as is sometimes claimed. Dorn argues that the international community has been concerned with issues of human safety since at least the time of the establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the 1860s. Stuart Gordon argues that Canada, one of its principal adherents, has in many ways simply recast its traditional Pearsonian foreign policy in the language of human security. 
Dorn also questioned whether the concept was really necessary ‘since all the initiatives in the human security agenda were already advancing before the advent of the concept.’ Finally, he suggests ways that the concept may be counterproductive. In their effort to fortify against ‘virtually limitless UN interventionism’ governments may repress ‘their populations into servility.&quot; Still, he sees an important role for the concept.

Richard Jolly and Deepayan Basu Ray, in their UNDP report, suggest that the key criticisms of human security include: Human security does not have any definite boundaries, therefore anything and everything could be considered a risk to security. This makes the task of policy formulation nearly impossible; Human security, when broadened to include issues like climate change and health, complicates the international machinery for reaching decisions or taking action on the threats identified; Human security risks engaging the military in issues best tackled through non-military means; Human security under the UN risks raising hopes about the UN&#x27;s capacity, which it cannot fulfil.

Other authors, such as Roland Paris, argue that human security is not such a fundamental recasting of the security debate in terms of a central struggle ‘between Realist, traditional, state-based, interest-based, approaches and new, Liberal cosmopolitan, de-territorialised, values-based approaches, which focus on individual human needs. ‘ Rather, he suggests that the talk of two radically different ‘paradigms’ has been much exaggerated.

==Formulation of a Human Security Index and an environment for discussing same==

As if to answer the points above, a Human Security Index was prototyped and released in 2008. Project coordinator D. A. Hastings notes that &quot;if one were challenged to create an index on the condition of people-centric Human Security, such as the authors of the Human Development Index faced in 1990 and expanded qualitatively in 1994, one could now begin to do so – at least for the sake of discussion and resultant improvements.&quot; The release document and a United Nations Bangkok Working Paper publish and discuss the original approach, which is based partly on:
*The original Human Development Index of the United Nations Development Programme, made more geographically complete (to 230+ countries) as described in a report issued by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.
*The essay on Human Security in the 1994 Human Development Report.
*An Equitability/Inclusiveness Enhanced Human Development Index – in which each of the components of the HDI (education, health, and income) are modified by an indicator of equitability in an attempt to adjust, for example, for the gap between the indicator of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Per Capita (adjusted for purchasing power parity) and the desired measure of financial resources &quot;in the pocket&quot; of a typical person in a country. In that index some countries with relatively equitable ratings compared to their Human Development Index (such as Iceland, the Slovak Republic, and Estonia) do relatively well, whereas some countries with relatively inequitable ratings compared to their HDI (such as Ireland, Greece, and the USA) do less well.
*A Social Fabric Index which enumerates human security with respect to the environment, diversity, peacefulness, freedom from corruption, and info empowerment. This was blended with the Human Development Index to form the prototype Human Security Index.

A 2010 enhancement to the HSI recast the composite index around a trinity of Economic, Environmental, and Social Fabric Indices. The result is thus conceptually similar to the Triple Bottom Line of Corporate Social Responsibility as described by John Elkington, as well as to the stated goals of the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. The release note of HSI Version 2 also notes efforts to balance local and global context, individual and society concerns, left-right political issues, east-west and north-south cultural and social issues. Current Version 2 of the HSI ingests about 30 datasets and composite indicators, and covers 232 countries and dependencies. It is released at HumanSecurityIndex.org.

Considerable differences in national ratings and standings have been noted between the HSI and indicators such as GDP per capita or the Human Development Index. Several small island countries plus Bhutan, Botswana, and some central-eastern European countries do considerably better in the HSI than they do in GDP per capita or HDI. Conversely, Greece and some Eurozone peers such as Ireland and Spain, several countries in the Gulf, Israel, Equatorial Guinea, the US and Venezuela do worse in the HSI than in GDP per capita or HDI. Influential factors vary (as is viewed in the data and discussions on the HumanSecurityIndex.org Website), but include diversity and income equality, peacefulness, and governance.

<doc id="1265113" wikidata="Q235889" url="?curid=1265113" title="Tribulus terrestris">
<text>Tribulus terrestris is an annual plant in the caltrop family (Zygophyllaceae) widely distributed around the world. It is adapted to thrive in dry climate locations in which few other plants can survive. 

It is native to warm temperate and tropical regions in southern Eurasia and Africa. It has been unintentionally introduced to North America and Australia. An aggressive and hardy invasive species, &quot;T. terrestris&quot; is widely known as a noxious weed because of its small woody fruit – the bur – having long sharp and strong spines which easily penetrate surfaces, such as bare feet or thin shoes of crop workers and other pedestrians, the rubber of bicycle tires, and the mouths and skin of grazing animals.

==Names==
Like many weedy species, this plant has numerous common names according to the world region, including goathead, bull&#x27;s head, gopher-head, caltrop, cat-head, devil&#x27;s eyelashes, devil&#x27;s-thorn, devil&#x27;s-weed, puncturevine, and tackweed.

==Description==

&quot;Tribulus terrestris&quot; is a taprooted herbaceous plant that grows as a summer annual in temperate climates.

===Growth pattern===
The stems radiate from the crown to a diameter of about to over , often branching. They are usually prostrate, forming flat patches, though they may grow more upwards in shade or among taller plants.

===Leaves and stem===

Stems branch from the crown and are densely hairy. Leaves are opposite and pinnately compound. Densely hairy leaflets are opposite and up to long.

===Inflorescence===
The flowers are wide, with five lemon-yellow petals, five sepals, and ten stamens. In Southern California, it blooms from April through October, where it is highly invasive in waste places and disturbed sites.

===Fruit===

After the flower blooms, a fruit develops that easily falls apart into five burs. The burs are hard and bear two to four sharp spines, long and broad point-to-point. These burs strikingly resemble goats&#x27; or bulls&#x27; heads, characteristics which give the bur its common names in some regions. The &quot;horns&quot; are sharp enough to puncture bicycle tires and other air-filled tires. They can also cause painful injury to bare feet and can injure the mouths of livestock grazing on the plant.

Within each bur, seeds are stacked on top of each other, separated by a hard membrane. As an adaptation to dry climates, the largest seed germinates first, while the others may wait until more moisture is available before germinating. The bur spines point upward, where they stick into feet and fur of animals, serving the purpose of seed dispersal. This causes damage to domesticated livestock and degrades wool. 
==Range and habitat==
&quot;T. terrestris&quot; is now widespread throughout the world from latitudes 35°S to 47°N. It is distributed across warm temperate and tropical regions of southern Europe, southern Asia, throughout Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. It is also present across southern North America and in Central and South America. Over the 20th century, it appeared in California and became distributed northward, eventually appearing in British Columbia, Canada where it is classified as a noxious weed.

A network of fine rootlets arise from the taproot allow the plant to survive in arid conditions. It grows in almost any soil, but thrives in dry, loose, sandy soils, and even in sand or in deserts. It can prosper in heavier soils, especially if fertile or moist, and on compacted soils along roadsides.

==Etymology==
The Greek word, τρίβολος meaning &#x27;water-chestnut&#x27;, translated into Latin as &quot;tribulos&quot;. The Latin name &quot;tribulus&quot; originally meant the caltrop (a spiky weapon of similar shape), but in Classical times the word already meant this plant as well.

==Cultivation==
The plant is widely naturalized in the Americas and also in Australia south of its native range. In some states in the United States, it is considered a noxious weed and an invasive species. It is a &quot;declared plant&quot; (&quot;infestations&quot; described under &quot;caltrop&quot;) in South Australia.

==Uses==
The leaves and shoots are eaten in East Asia. The stems have been used as a thickener, added to diluted buttermilk to give it the appearance of undiluted buttermilk. There is some evidence that &quot;T. terrestris&quot; was used in traditional medicine.

===Dietary supplement===
Although its extract has been used as a dietary supplement since the 1980s in belief that it increases testosterone levels to aid body building or sexual enhancement in men, &quot;T. terrestris&quot; did not consistently affect testosterone levels in controlled studies, has not been proven to be safe, and may adversely interact with prescription drugs. High-quality research on &quot;T. terrestris&quot; extract has not been conducted, and no reviews indicate that it has strength-enhancing properties, or anabolic steroid effects for use as a bodybuilding supplement or sexual enhancement. The Australian Institute of Sport discourages athletes from using &quot;T. terrestris&quot; supplements.

===Phytochemistry===
Phytochemicals of &quot;T. terrestris&quot; include steroidal saponins.

==Eradication==
In areas where it is an invasive species, &quot;T. terrestris&quot; is often sought to be eradicated. However, &quot;T. terrestris&quot; is considered a hardy plant, and its seeds remain viable for up to three years, making complete eradication difficult. T. terrestris grows well in barren and disturbed soil, but does not thrive in soil that is already colonized by a vigorous ground-cover. Preventing a new outbreak of T. terrestris is the most effective strategy. In barren, compacted soil, cultivate the soil and plant ground-cover to exclude T. terrestris. Cover disturbed soil with a barrier that will keep seeds from being deposited. Where ground-cover is newly planted, diligently monitor to ensure no T. terrestris seeds have sprouted in the area. 

===Physical eradication===

&quot;T. terrestris&quot; can be cleared manually by using a multi-year removal and suppression strategy. Removing the plant should be done before or during flowering to prevent seed formation (late spring and early summer in many areas). Removal can be entire, by gripping the plant at the top of the taproot and pulling upward; or partial, by using a hoe to cut the plant off at the taproot. Partial removal will allow regrowth, but may be the only option in compacted soil; in this case, repeated cutting will exhaust the plant&#x27;s energy storage. This will greatly reduce the prevalence of the weed the following year. An effective multi-year strategy consists of continuing to pull or cut &quot;T. terrestris&quot; over the course of at least three years, preventing any new seeds from forming, and allowing the oldest viable seeds in the seed bank to sprout. To avoid recolonization, the area should be planted with a quality ground-covering plant that will block light and access to bare soil, and develop a root structure able to exclude or compete with &quot;T. terrestris&quot;. 

Aerating compacted sites and planting competitive desirable plants, including broad-leaved grasses such as St. Augustine, can reduce the effect of &quot;T. terrestris&quot; by reducing resources available to the weed.

In June 2014, the town of Irrigon, Oregon, announced it would pay a bounty of one dollar for each large trash bag of puncturevine.

===Chemical===
When working to eradicate large areas of T. terrestris, a mix of manual and chemical removal is most effective. Chemical control poses risks to other plants, soil chemistry and biology, water quality, and animals; it should only be utilized if manual control is insufficiently effective. Pre-emergent chemicals can be most effective in combination with manual control; it prevents the annual seeds of T. terrestris from sprouting to make new plants. This, in combination with removal of existing plants, can swiftly exhaust the seed-bank. Products containing oryzalin, benefin, or trifluralin will provide partial control of germinating seeds. These must be applied prior to germination (late winter to midspring).

After plants have emerged from the soil (postemergent), products containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), glyphosate, and dicamba are effective on &quot;T. terrestris&quot;. Like most postemergents, they are more effectively maintained when caught small and young. Dicamba and 2,4-D will cause harm to most broad-leaved plants, so the user should take care to avoid over-application. They can be applied to lawns without injuring the desired grass. Glyphosate will kill or injure most plants, so it should only be used as a spot treatment or on solid stands of the weed. A product from DuPont called Pastora is highly effective but expensive and not for lawn use.

===Biological===
Two weevils, &quot;Microlarinus lareynii&quot; and &quot;M. lypriformis&quot;, native to India, France, and Italy, were introduced into the United States as biocontrol agents in 1961. Both species of weevils are available for purchase from biological suppliers, but purchase and release is not often recommended because weevils collected from other areas may not survive at the purchaser&#x27;s location.

&quot;Microlarinus lareynii&quot; is a seed weevil that deposits its eggs in the young burr or flower bud. The larvae feed on and destroy the seeds before they pupate, emerge, disperse, and start the cycle over again. Its life cycle time is 19 to 24 days. &quot;Microlarinus lypriformis&quot; is a stem weevil that has a similar life cycle, excepting the location of the eggs, which includes the undersides of stems, branches, and the root crown. The larvae tunnel in the pith where they feed and pupate. Adults of both species overwinter in plant debris. Although the stem weevil is slightly more effective than the seed weevil when each is used alone, the weevils are most effective if used together and the &quot;T. terrestris&quot; plant is moisture-stressed.

==Toxicity==
Toxic compounds in the plant are known to cause liver damage when ingested at harmful dosages. When ingested, phylloerythrin accumulates in the blood as a byproduct of chlorophyll degradation; however, adverse reactions have not been confirmed in humans. In sheep, consumption of &quot;T. terrestris&quot; causes tribulosis, also known as &#x27;geeldikkop&#x27;, which is a type of photodermatitis. Two alkaloids that seem to cause limb paresis (staggers) in sheep that eat &quot;Tribulus terrestris&quot; are the beta-carboline alkaloids harman (harmane) and norharman (norharmane). The alkaloid content of dried foliage is about 44 mg/kg.

<doc id="1265119" wikidata="Q829366" url="?curid=1265119" title="2004 Brandenburg state election">
<text>The 2004 Brandenburg state election was held on 19 September 2004 to elect the members of the 4th Landtag of Brandenburg. The incumbent government of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Christian Democratic Union (CDU) led by Minister-President Matthias Platzeck was returned with a significantly reduced majority. The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) moved into second place, although polls prior to the election suggested it would become the largest party. The CDU fell to third place.

==Background==
The SPD had suffered losses in several state elections before Brandenburg. This was thought to be a consequence of the Agenda 2010 policy, a series of economic liberal economic reforms adopted by the federal SPD government led by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Many voters in eastern Germany turned to the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), while many in the west later turned to Labour and Social Justice, an SPD splinter party. In state elections, the SPD&#x27;s growing unpopularity had chiefly benefited the CDU.

In Brandenburg, both Minister-President Matthias Platzeck (SPD) and his partner Jörg Schönbohm (CDU) supported Schröder&#x27;s reforms. Both PDS and the German People&#x27;s Union (DVU), which had entered the Landtag in 1999, campaigned in opposition.

<text>Roads and expressways in Chicago summarizes the main thoroughfares and the numbering system used in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs.

==Street layout==
Chicago&#x27;s streets were laid out in a grid that grew from the city&#x27;s original townsite plan platted by James Thompson. Streets following the Public Land Survey System section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections. As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and 16 in the other direction. A scattering of diagonal streets, many of them originally Native American trails, also cross the city. Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the Plan of Chicago, but only the extension of Ogden Avenue was ever constructed. In the 1950s and 1960s, a network of superhighways was built radiating from the city center.

As the city grew and annexed adjacent towns, problems arose with duplicate street names and a confusing numbering system based on the Chicago River. On June 22, 1908, the city council adopted a system proposed by Edward P. Brennan; amended June 21, 1909. The changes were effective September 1, 1909 for most of the city.

Addresses in Chicago and some suburbs are numbered outward from baselines at State Street, which runs north and south, and Madison Street, which runs east and west.

A book was published in 1909 by The Chicago Directory Company indexing the old and new street numbers for most of Chicago. This volume is available online in PDF format indexed by initial letter, Plan of Re-Numbering, City of Chicago, August 1909. The opening text of the book says: &quot;EXPLANATORY&quot;
The downtown area did not conform to this system until April 1, 1911, per an amendment to the law on June 20, 1910. Downtown was defined as Lake Michigan on the east, Roosevelt Road (Twelfth Street) on the south, and the Chicago River on the north and west. The addition to cover downtown was published, and is also on line as a pdf indexed by downtown street name.

This additional paragraph explained the downtown changes:

Chicago house numbers are generally assigned at the rate of 800 to a mile. The only exceptions are from Madison to 31st Street, just south of downtown. Roosevelt Road (previously Twelfth St) is one mile south of Madison with 1200 addresses to the mile, Cermak Road (previously 22nd Street) is two miles south of Madison with 1000 addresses to the mile, and 31st Street (3100 S) is three miles south of Madison with 900 addresses to the mile. South of 31st Street, the pattern of 800 to the mile resumes, with 39th Street the next major street, 47th after that, and so on. Individual house numbers are normally assigned at the rate of one per 20 feet of frontage. Thus the last two digits of house numbers generally go only as high as 67 before the next block number is reached. Higher house numbers are found on diagonal streets and have sometimes been assigned by request.

The blocks are normally counted out by &quot;hundreds,&quot; so that Chicagoans routinely give directions by saying things such as &quot;about twelve hundred north on Western&quot; or &quot;around twenty-four hundred west on Division&quot; (which both describe the intersection of Western Avenue (2400 W) and Division Street (1200 N)).

South of Madison Street most of the east–west streets are simply numbered. The street numbering is aligned with the house numbering, so that 95th Street is exactly 9500 South. &quot;Half-block&quot; east–west thoroughfares in this area are numbered and called places; 95th Place would lie just south of and parallel to 95th Street, and just north of 96th Street.

Every four blocks (half-mile) is a major secondary street. For example, Division Street (1200 N) is less important than either Chicago Avenue (800 N) or North Avenue (1600 N), but is still a major thoroughfare. However, this is not always the case; for example, on the city&#x27;s Far North Side, Peterson Avenue (6000 N) is a more heavily trafficked street than Bryn Mawr Avenue (5600 N), which sits exactly at the 7-mile marker. U.S. Route 14 is routed along Peterson between Clark Street at 1600 W and Cicero Avenue at 4800 W, whereas Bryn Mawr is discontinuous, split into two segments in this part of the city by Rosehill Cemetery between Damen and Western Avenues.

Even-numbered addresses are found on the north and west sides of a street, and odd numbers are found on the south and east sides, irrespective of the streets&#x27; position relative to the corner of State and Madison.

Diagonals, even if they were to run exactly 45 degrees off of the cardinal directions, are numbered as if they were north–south or east–west streets. Examples are North Lincoln Avenue and Ogden Avenue, which bends at Madison and changes from North Ogden to West Ogden.

The northernmost street in Chicago is Juneway Terrace (7800 N), just north of Howard Street. The southern boundary is 138th Street. The eastern boundary of Chicago is Avenue A/State Line Road (4100 E) along and south of 106th Street, and the furthest west the city extends is in the portion of O&#x27;Hare International Airport that lies in DuPage County, just east of Elmhurst/York Road.

==Street names==
While all north–south streets within city limits are named, rather than numbered, smaller streets in some areas are named in groups all starting with the same letter; thus, when traveling westward on a Chicago street, starting just past Pulaski Road (4000 W), one will cross a mile-long stretch of streets which have names starting with the letter K (From east to west: Keystone (North Side)/Komensky (South Side), Karlov, Kedvale, Keeler, Kildare, Kolin, Kostner, Kenneth, Kilbourn, Kolmar, Kenton, Knox, Kilpatrick, Keating), giving rise to the expression &quot;K-town&quot;. These streets are found approximately in the 11th mile west of the Indiana state line, and so begin with the 11th letter of the alphabet. A mile later, just past Cicero (4800 W), the starting letter changes to L, and mile by mile the letters progress up to P. Additionally, for most of the first mile west of the Illinois/Indiana state line, streets are lettered from Avenue A (S State Line Road) at the state line (4100 E) to Avenue O (3430 E), forming the A group. The areas that might otherwise be the B through J groups are the older parts of the city where street names were already well established before this system was developed (although some small groups of streets seem to have been given names intended to conform to the system), and the Q group (8800 to 9600 W) would fall west of the city, as the only land in Chicago west of 8800 West is O&#x27;Hare International Airport, undeveloped forest preserve, and a small strip of land connecting O&#x27;Hare to the rest of the city and containing only Foster Avenue.

==Suburbs==
Some suburbs number their east–west streets in a continuation of the Chicago pattern, and even more number their houses according to the Chicago grid. A few suburbs also number their north–south avenues according to the Chicago grid, although such numbering vanished from Chicago itself long ago (the alphabetical naming scheme was devised to help eliminate it). For example, the 54th/Cermak terminus of the Pink Line is located near the intersection of 54th Avenue and Cermak Road (22nd Street) in Cicero. This is 54 blocks west of State Street in Chicago. A minor street blocks west of State Street would be called 54th Court (in reality, that is Lotus Avenue in Chicago).

This pattern continues as far west as Plainfield, which has a 252nd Avenue, as far north as Skokie at Central Street (10100 North), and as far south as the southern edge of Will County. Suburbs that follow the Chicago numbering system include Berwyn, Bridgeview, Brookfield, Burbank, Channahon, Chicago Heights, Cicero, Crystal Lake, Elwood, Evergreen Park, Franklin Park, Justice, Lincolnwood, Matteson, Monee, Morris, Morton Grove, Niles, North Chicago, Oak Forest, Oak Lawn, Orland Park, Oswego, River Grove, Rosemont, Skokie, Westchester, unincorporated parts of Des Plaines, Glenview, and other parts of Cook County, Will, DuPage, Kendall, and Grundy Counties. Other suburbs, including Evanston, Park Ridge, Oak Park, Glenview and Wilmette use their own numbering systems. The six &quot;collar&quot; counties (DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, and Will) use State and Madison as a base line. For example, 32W000 in DuPage County is 32 miles west of State Street, 38000 in Lake County would be 38 miles north of Madison Street, and is normally used without the direction letter. In these counties, unlike Chicago, numbering is 1,000 numbers to the mile, so in DuPage County miles west is 32W500.

Some Chicago suburbs in adjoining Northwest Indiana also use the Chicago numbering system. These include East Chicago, Whiting, and Hammond. There are even examples further south in Lake County in Dyer and Schererville such as 205th Place through 215th Street (these examples coordinate with the Chicago grid, not the Gary street system). Other municipalities, such as Highland, and Griffith are based on the Gary, Indiana numbering system, beginning with 5th Avenue in Gary and increasing numerically as one travels southward. Examples in Scheider in the far south of Lake County, Indiana go as far down as 244th Avenue.

The aforementioned pattern also occurs in Waukegan, Illinois, with Washington Street being the baseline between north and south. Nearby municipalities such as Gurnee, Park City, and North Chicago continue with the Waukegan numbering pattern, while rural areas in Lake County, Illinois follow the Chicago grid.

===Mile roads===
(No part of Golf Road, Dempster Street, Oakton Street, Wolf Road, LaGrange Road or 143rd Street to 311th Street actually lies within the boundaries of Chicago. These streets are included for reference, since they are a continuation of the Chicago mile street pattern into the suburbs.)

===Downtown===
The density of main streets in downtown Chicago is greater than in the rest of the city, with some at half-block spacing (just 50 address numbers or one-sixteenth mile from the next parallel street), or block spacing between main streets, unlike the rest of the city where the main streets are spaced at half-mile and mile intervals:

The half-mile numbered streets on the South Side are all secondary streets: 35th, 43rd, 51st, 59th, etc.; all are numbered aside from Marquette Road, running at 6700 S, west from King Drive (400 E) to the city&#x27;s western limit at Cicero Avenue (4800 W), near Midway International Airport. East of King to near Lake Michigan at 2400 E, it is called 67th Street, and Marquette is aligned one block to the north on what would be 66th Street.

(No part of Old Orchard Road, Church Street, or Main Street actually lies within the boundaries of Chicago. These streets are included for reference, since they are a continuation of the Chicago mile street pattern into the suburbs.)

A similar numbering system is also used in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

===Diagonal roads===
The following streets run diagonally through Chicago&#x27;s grid system on all or part of their courses. These streets tend to form major 5 or 6-way intersections. In many cases they were Indian trails, or were among the earliest streets established in the city. Diagonals are numbered as north–south or east–west streets. Examples are North Lincoln Avenue and Ogden Avenue, which bends at Madison and changes from North Ogden to West Ogden.

* N. Rogers Avenue
* N. Ridge Avenue/Boulevard
* N. Broadway
* N. Clark Street
* N. Rush Street
* N. Lincoln Avenue
* N. Sheridan Road
* N. Caldwell Avenue
* N. Lehigh Avenue

==Expressways==
The city of Chicago proper contains seven major Interstate highways.

==U.S. Routes==
==County roads==
Cook County has a modest amount of county roads after plans were made in 2009 to designate many roads on county ownership as a public service.

Only the designated streets in the townships of Lemont, Palos, Orland, Bremen, Lyons (south of the rivers) and Wheeling have the blue pentagon signs that are used to demarcate county roads.

<text>Heinrich Eberbach (24 November 1895 – 13 July 1992) was a German general during World War II who commanded the 5th Panzer Army during the Allied invasion of Normandy. He was a recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves of Nazi Germany.

==World War I and interwar years==
Heinrich Eberbach was born on 24 November 1895 in Stuttgart, in the German Empire. Eberbach graduated with his &quot;Abitur&quot; (university-preparatory high school diploma) on 30 June 1914. On 1 July 1914, Eberbach joined the Army of Württemberg. With the outbreak of World War I, Eberbach&#x27;s unit was deployed on the Western Front. On 16 October 1914, Eberbach was wounded in his thigh by artillery shrapnel. In September 1915, Eberbach was severely wounded, losing part of his nose, and was taken prisoner of war by French forces. During the 1920s Eberbach was a police officer; in 1935 he joined the Wehrmacht. In 1938 Eberbach became commander of a Panzer regiment, in the newly formed 4th Panzer Division under General Georg-Hans Reinhardt.

==World War II==
Eberbach participated in the German Invasion of Poland in September 1939 and then in 1940 in the Battle of France. His unit supported General Hasso von Manteuffel&#x27;s offensive across the Meuse River in May. Shortly after the start of Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, he was assigned as commander of the 5th Panzer Brigade in Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg&#x27;s XXIV Panzer Corps.

During the Battle of Moscow, Eberbach spearheaded Panzer Group 2&#x27;s offensive towards Moscow as the commander of a combined-arms &quot;kampfgruppe&quot; within the 4th Panzer Division. The attack began on September 30 and in only two days of fighting Kampfgruppe Eberbach had achieved a clean breakthrough, advanced over 120 kilometers, and put the entire Soviet Bryansk Front in a disastrous position while suffering negligible losses of its own. Eberbach demonstrated his flexibility as a troop leader by detaching two battalions to assist the 3rd Panzer Division&#x27;s efforts in the same area of operations near Bryansk, despite serving under a different division. Soviet air attacks and a fuel shortage early on 2 October failed to prevent the kampfgruppe&#x27;s aggressive combat leaders from advancing on the city of Orel, ending the Soviet industrial relocation efforts there and capturing a key communications hub of the Bryansk Front, on 3 October. Kampfgruppe Eberbach&#x27;s losses had been light: 6 tanks knocked out, 34 men killed and 121 wounded. This was a small price to pay for the complete rupturing of the Soviet lines and the capture of a city of such strategic value. 4th Panzer division had also captured 1,600 Soviet troops, mostly Kampfgruppe Eberbach&#x27;s work.
In March 1942 he was made commander of the 4th Panzer Division, in the German lines opposite the Russian town of Sukhinichi, roughly 120 miles west of Tula. In late November 1942 Eberbach was appointed commander of the XLVIII Panzer Corps that had just been overrun in the initial days of Operation Uranus, near the midpoint of the Battle of Stalingrad. Eberbach was soon wounded and evacuated, remaining hospitalized until February. He then became Inspector of the Armored Troops in the Home Army, was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross and promoted to lieutenant general.

In November 1943, Eberbach became commander of troops around Nikopol and fought in battles around Zhitomir in the Soviet Union. In early 1944 Eberbach was promoted to the rank of General der Panzertruppe. During the Allied invasion of Normandy, he fought against the British landings along the &#x27;Juno&#x27; and &#x27;Sword&#x27; beaches. On 4 July he took command of &quot;Panzer Group West&quot; (later, 5th Panzer Army) after Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg was relieved (two days before). On 9 August, this force was divided, with 5th Panzer Army retreating with the most damaged units; the effective units were reorganized as Panzergruppe Eberbach.

Eberbach was directed to lead this force in the counterattack through Mortain toward Avranches that was intended to cut off the Allied forces which had broken out of Normandy. According to Eberbach&#x27;s post-war memoirs, he had no confidence in the attack. When General Warlimont of OKW arrived at his HQ on 1 August to &quot;get a closer look at the situation&quot;, Eberbach told him that &quot;the only possible solution was an immediate retreat to the Seine-Yonne line.&quot; However, Warlimont denied Eberbach&#x27;s request to withdraw, and instead confirmed the order to attack.

The attack failed, and most of Panzergruppe Eberbach and 7th Army was surrounded and destroyed in the Falaise Pocket. Eberbach escaped and was given command of the remnants of 7th Army on 21 August. On 31 August Eberbach was surprised in his bed and captured by British troops at Amiens. He was later presented to Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks.

==Post World War II==

Eberbach was held in a prisoner-of-war camp until 1948. He participated in the work of the U.S. Army Historical Division, where, under the guidance of Franz Halder, German generals wrote World War II operational studies for the U.S. Army, first as POWs and then as employees. Eberbach was the father of the naval officer Heinz-Eugen Eberbach, commander of and during World War II.

<text>Cascavel is a city in the state of Paraná in Brazil. It is the fifth most populous city in the state with 348,051 inhabitants, according to IBGE 2022 Census. The distance to Curitiba, the state capital, is 491 kilometers by freeway.

Relatively new and with a privileged topography, Cascavel&#x27;s development was planned, which gives it wide streets and well distributed neighborhoods. With an area of 2,100,831 km2, it is considered a strategic hub of Mercosul. It is the main city in the Cascavel Metropolitan Area.

The city is on a plateau 781 meters above sea level. It is 504 km west of the state capital of Curitiba and 605 km west of the sea port of Paranaguá, 140 km from the three borders (Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil) at 24° 58&#x27; South, 53° 26&#x27; West.

== Toponymy ==
The name of the city means rattlesnake in Portuguese; it arises from a variation of the classical Latin &quot;cascabus&quot;, meaning &quot;bubbling water boiling&quot;. According to legend, a group of settlers camped one night in the region and they were woken by the sound of a rattle; later they realized they set up the camp next to a rattlesnake.

== History ==
=== Cycle of &quot;erva mate&quot; ===
The Caingangue natives inhabited western Paraná, which was occupied by the Spaniards in 1557, when they founded the Ciudad del Real Guayrá, in the current city of Terra Roxa.

A new occupation started in 1730 with troops (&quot;tropeirismo&quot; in Portuguese), but the settlement of the current city began in the late 1910s by settlers of mixed racial ethnicity (&quot;caboclos&quot; (people of indigenous and European descent)), and descendants of Slavic immigrants, at the peak of the cycle of &quot;erva mate&quot;.

The village began to form on March 28, 1928, when José Silverio de Oliveira, dubbed &quot;Nho Jeca&quot;, bought a glebe from the settler Jose Antonio Elias, in the historical area called Encruzilhada dos Gomes, and which is currently the Cascavel Velho neighborhood. It was at a junction of several trails open by &quot;ervateiros&quot; (cultivators of &quot;erva mate&quot;), drovers and military, where de Oliveira set up his warehouse. His entrepreneurial spirit was key to the arrival of new people, who brought ideas and investments.

From the 1930s and 1940s, thousands of southern settlers, mostly descendants of Poles, Germans, Italians, Ukrainians and caboclos migrating from coffee regions, began logging, farming and raising pigs in the village, which became a district in 1938.

Notably, the locality was already included in military maps from 1924, and the village was made official by the town hall of Foz do Iguaçu in 1936, with the name of Cascavel. The prelate of that city, Monsignor William Maria Thiletzek, renamed it &quot;Aparecida dos Portos&quot; (a Brazilian name for Mary, The Mother of Jesus), a name that did not prosper amongst the inhabitants.

=== Cycle of wood ===
In the 1930s, with the cycle of &quot;erva mate&quot; at a close, the surrounding area entered into the so-called &quot;cycle of wood&quot;, which attracted a large number of families from Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. In particular, there were many Polish, German and Italian settlers, who formed the basis of the municipal population.

As the native forests were depleted, the land became available to agriculture sector, which underpins the present-day economy.

In 1938, Cascavel became an administrative district.

=== Emancipation ===
The municipality of Cascavel was emancipated on November 14, 1951, by state law n° 790, separating it from Foz do Iguaçu. For decades there was a discussion about whether this would be the proper date, as the installation of the first municipal government occurred only on December 14, 1952. However, in 2010, with the law n° 5.689, the discussion was put to rest.

=== Development ===

As the cycle of timber closed in the late 1970s, industrialization began along with increased agricultural activity and a rising service industry. In less than six decades, Cascavel went from a rest stop for travelers and trappers, to the largest municipality in western Paraná and one of the largest economic centers in southern Brazil.

<text>Parks in Chicago include open spaces and facilities, developed and managed by the Chicago Park District. The City of Chicago devotes 8.5% of its total land acreage to parkland, which ranked it 13th among high-density population cities in the United States in 2012. Since the 1830s, the official motto of Chicago has been &quot;Urbs in horto&quot;, Latin for &quot;City in a garden&quot; for its commitment to parkland. In addition to serving residents, a number of these parks also double as tourist destinations, most notably Lincoln Park, Chicago&#x27;s largest park, visited by over 20 million people each year, is one of the most visited parks in the United States. Notable architects, artists and landscape architects have contributed to the 570 parks, including Daniel Burnham, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jens Jensen, Dwight Perkins, Frank Gehry, and Lorado Taft.

==History==
In 1836, a year before Chicago was incorporated, the Board of Canal Commissioners held public auctions for the city&#x27;s first lots. Foresighted citizens, who wanted the Lake Michigan lakefront kept as public open space, convinced the commissioners to designate two lots as public area. The land east of Michigan Avenue between Madison Street and Park Row (11th Street) was designated &quot;Public Ground—A Common to Remain Forever Open, Clear and Free of Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction, whatever.&quot; This lot was soon expanded to Randolph Street, and it was officially named Lake Park in 1847. It was renamed Grant Park in 1901. A second parcel, west of Michigan Avenue between Randolph and Washington Streets, was designated Dearborn Park.

As Chicago grew, demand increased for public spaces, but the Chicago Common Council did little to address these requests. Instead, real estate investors realized that small public squares could increase the value of their property. In 1842, Washington Square Park became the first of these ventures, developed by the American Land Company. Similar projects were completed with Goudy Square Park in 1847 and Union Park in 1853. Although the Cook County Court agreed to allocate a major park on the South Side in 1857, these plans were rescinded two years later, and public outcry continued.

Chicago&#x27;s second large-scale allocation of parkland came in 1860, when a large section of the City Cemetery was re-designated as a park. This was due to concerns led by John Henry Rauch about the possible public health impact of having a large cemetery on the lake. This new park was also named Lake Park; however, due to confusion over its name, it was renamed to Lincoln Park in 1865, in honor of the recently deceased President. Slowly, all of the graves were moved from the cemetery, greatly expanding the park.
Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris and New York&#x27;s &quot;Greensward Plan&quot; in the 1850s and 1860s turned new attention to the role that parks can play in urban development. William Butler Ogden, the first mayor of Chicago, advocated for a state bill to create a large park on the South Side. Although initially rejected when proposed in 1868, the Illinois legislature accepted this plan in 1869. The objective was to create a system of parks and boulevards that would form a circle around Chicago.

In 1891, J. Frank Foster became the superintendent of the south Chicago park system. He advocated the spreading out of parks into working-class neighborhoods. These generally smaller parks would nonetheless be filled with playing fields and other facilities particularly &#x27;field house&#x27; buildings. These facilities would provide all manner of recreation space and services to people of the surrounding neighborhoods. Olmstead&#x27;s sons, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and John Charles Olmsted, designed many of the early neighborhood parks, and these ideas for neighborhood parks influenced national ideas of park design and programming.

==Facilities==
The Chicago Park District manages 220 facilities in 570 parks covering more than of land throughout the city. This extensive network of parks also includes nine lakefront harbors over of lakefront, rendering the Chicago Park District the nation&#x27;s largest municipal harbor system, along with 31 beaches, 17 historic lagoons, 86 pools, 90 playgrounds, 90 gardens, 66 fitness centers, nine ice skating rinks, 10 museums, a zoological park, and two plant conservatories.

The Chicago Park District also maintains many special use facilities for activities such as golfing, boating, boxing, skating and baseball, as well as a number of specialty parks devoted entirely to dogs. In addition to maintaining its parks and facilities, the Chicago Park District holds thousands of community, holiday, nature, sports, music, arts, and cultural events and festivals for city residents every year, many featuring performances and workshops provided by nationally recognized &quot;Arts Partners&quot; such as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and &quot;Arts Partners in Residence&quot; such as the Citywide Symphony Orchestra, the Albany Park Theater Project, Beacon Street Gallery and Theater, Billy Goat Experimental Theatre Company, Chicago Dance Medium, Chicago Moving Company, Chicago Swordplay Guild, Free Street Programs, K-Theory, Kuumba Lynx, The Peace Museum, Pros Arts Studio, the Puerto Rican Arts Alliance, and the Zephyr Dance Company. The height of these events are during the summer months at the height of the tourist season while children are out of school for summer recess.

==Architecture==
The dominant theme in many of Chicago&#x27;s park fieldhouses are variants of either Georgian or Classical Revival architecture. Clarence Hatzfeld designed more of these fieldhouses than any other architect, as well as many of the homes in Chicago&#x27;s landmark Villa District.

Similar to other areas of Chicago&#x27;s built environment, a sizeable number of structures in Chicago&#x27;s Parks are of exceptional architectural value. Portage Park and Jefferson Park are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and some like Pulaski Park are official landmarks of the City of Chicago.

==Forest preserves==
The green-space afforded by Chicago&#x27;s parks is supplemented by the Cook County Forest Preserves, a separately administered network of open spaces containing forest, prairie, wetland, streams, and lakes, that are set aside as natural areas along the city&#x27;s periphery.

<doc id="1265165" wikidata="Q860582" url="?curid=1265165" title="Community areas in Chicago">
<text>The city of Chicago is divided into 77 community areas for statistical and planning purposes. Census data and other statistics are tied to the areas, which serve as the basis for a variety of urban planning initiatives on both the local and regional levels. The areas&#x27; boundaries do not generally change, allowing comparisons of statistics across time. The areas are distinct from but related to the more numerous neighborhoods of Chicago; an area often corresponds to a neighborhood or encompasses several neighborhoods, but the areas do not always correspond to popular conceptions of the neighborhoods due to a number of factors including historical evolution and choices made by the creators of the areas. , Near North Side is the most populous of the areas with over 105,000 residents, while Burnside is the least populous with just over 2,500. Other geographical divisions of Chicago exist, such as the &quot;sides&quot; with origin in the 3 branches of the Chicago River, the 50 wards of the Chicago City Council which undergo redistricting based in population movements, and the parishes of the Roman Catholic Church.

The Social Science Research Committee at the University of Chicago defined the community areas in the 1920s based on neighborhoods or groups of related neighborhoods within the city. In this effort it was led by sociologists Robert E. Park and Ernest Burgess, who believed that physical contingencies created areas that would inevitably form a common identity. Except for the addition of two areas (O&#x27;Hare from land annexed by the city in 1956 and Edgewater&#x27;s separation from Uptown in 1980) and peripheral expansions due to minor annexations, the areas&#x27; boundaries have never been revised to reflect change but instead have been kept stable. The areas have become a part of the culture of Chicago, contributing to its perception as a &quot;city of neighborhoods&quot; and breaking it down into smaller regions for easier analysis and local planning. Nevertheless, Park&#x27;s and Burgess&#x27;s ideas on the inevitability of physically related areas forming a common bond have been questioned, and the unchanging nature of the areas has at times been seen as analytically problematic with major subsequent changes in some of the areas&#x27; urban landscapes, such as the construction of expressways.

==History==
During the 19th century wards were used by the Census Bureau for data at the level below cities. This was problematic as wards were political subdivisions and thus changed after each census, limiting their utility for comparisons over time. Census tracts were first used in Chicago in the 1910 Census. However, by the 1920s the Social Science Research Committee at the University of Chicago wanted divisions that were more natural and manageable than the arbitrarily-designated and numerous census tracts. The sociologist Robert E. Park led this charge, considering physical barriers such as railroads and the Chicago River to form distinctive and consistent areas within the city, which he deemed &quot;natural&quot; areas that would eventually merge into a distinctive identity. Ernest Burgess, a colleague of Park&#x27;s who shared his thinking, was crucial in creating and naming the community areas. Initially able to identify 400 neighborhoods of the city, he considered that number excessive and trimmed it down to 80 and thereafter 75 by grouping related neighborhoods into a single community area. The Chicago Department of Public Health wished to present local differences in birth and death rates; it worked with the committee to produce the list of 75 community areas, which were divided into 935 census tracts.

After the community areas were introduced, the University of Chicago Press published data sorted by them from the 1920 and 1930 Censuses, as well as a citywide 1934 census to help collect data related to the Great Depression, in what was known as the &quot;Local Community Fact Book&quot;. With the exception of 1970 (whose data was published in 1980), it continued this publication for every subsequent census through 1990, expanding in the 1960s to also cover major suburbs of Chicago. The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning continues this work by periodically publishing &quot;Community Snapshots&quot; of the community areas and suburbs, the most recent being data from 2018 published .

Only two major changes have occurred in the boundaries of the community areas. O&#x27;Hare was created from land that was annexed by Chicago in 1956 to control O&#x27;Hare International Airport. Edgewater was separated from Uptown in 1980 as residents considered being joined to it a detriment to obtaining aid for local improvements. In addition to these two there have been minor changes due to further annexations and additions to the Lake Michigan shoreline.

==Use and reception==
The areas are used for statistical and planning purposes by such professions as assessors, charities, and reporters. Shortly after their development they were used for all kinds of statistics, including movie theater distribution and juvenile delinquency. Although developed by the University of Chicago, they have been used by other universities in the Chicago area, as well as by the city and regional planners. They have contributed to Chicago&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;city of neighborhoods&quot;, and are argued to break up an intimidating city into more manageable pieces. Chicago was an early adopter of such a system, and most cities in the United States still lacked analogous divisions.

The areas do not necessarily correspond to popular imagination of the neighborhoods. For example, the Pilsen and Back of the Yards neighborhoods are much better known than their respective community areas Lower West Side and New City. In the case of New City this was a deliberate choice; Burgess opted for the less common &quot;New City&quot; to name the area as &quot;Back of the Yards&quot; carried a stigma after the publication of Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle&quot; (1904), which made the area notorious for its poor living conditions. Some of these discrepancies are due to names that were common at the time of the adoption of community areas but have since been supplanted by others. The static nature of area boundaries is one of their benefits, but is also problematic at times such as when expressways were built in the mid-20th century and divided neighborhoods without area boundaries adapting. The concept of a &quot;natural area&quot; that underpinned Park&#x27;s and Burgess&#x27;s thinking has also been challenged.

==List of community areas==


==Other geographic divisions of Chicago==
Chicago is traditionally divided into the three &quot;sides&quot; of the North Side, West Side, and South Side by the Chicago River. These three sides are represented by the white stripes on the Flag of Chicago. The city is also divided into 50 wards for the purpose of electing one alderman each to the Chicago City Council. These wards have at times generated identities similar to neighborhoods. Unlike community areas, wards are adjusted decennially to account for population shifts. Another method of neighborhood nomenclature in heavily Catholic neighborhoods of Chicago has been to refer to communities in terms of parishes. For example, one might say, &quot;I live in St. Gertrude&#x27;s, but he is from Saint Ita&#x27;s.&quot;

<doc id="1265166" wikidata="Q7716690" url="?curid=1265166" title="The Best Christmas Pageant Ever">
<text>The Best Christmas Pageant Ever (titled &quot;The Worst Kids in the World&quot; in Australia, New Zealand and the UK) is a children&#x27;s novel written by Barbara Robinson in 1972. It tells the story of six misfit children who volunteer to star in their town&#x27;s Sunday school Christmas pageant, and end up teaching the town the true meaning of Christmas.

== Story ==
The book is narrated in first person perspective by Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Bradley, daughter of the pageant&#x27;s director.

The six Herdman children – Imogene, Ralph, Claude, Leroy, Ollie, and Gladys – are notorious for their rowdy misfit behavior, including cigar smoking, cussing, drinking jug wine, shoplifting, and committing arson. They have never been disciplined because their father hopped a train and never came back when Gladys was just a baby and their mother is always working multiple shifts to make ends meet. Despite their poor performance, the Herdmans steadily pass through elementary school (since holding any one of them back would mean having two or more of them in the same grade).

They go to Sunday school for the first time after being told that the church offers snacks. The narrator&#x27;s mother is flabbergasted when they all volunteer for the lead roles in the Christmas pageant: Mary (Imogene), Joseph (Ralph), the Three Wise Men (Claude, Ollie, and Leroy), and the Angel of the Lord (Gladys), the last of whom likens her role to a character from &quot;Amazing Comics&quot;. Since they have bullied all the usual cast members into remaining silent during the call for volunteers, the director has no choice but to cast them. Furthermore, an actual infant would be traditionally cast in the Christmas pageant as Jesus, but ever since the Herdmans took over the other major roles, all the local mothers with babies keep their children away out of fear, prompting Beth&#x27;s mother to use a doll instead.

Having never heard the Christmas story before, the Herdmans take an uncharacteristic interest, through which the narrator is surprised to find herself, and her parents, thinking more seriously about the story&#x27;s harsher aspects: e.g., that the innkeeper forced a pregnant woman and her baby to sleep in a barn, and the Holy Family were on the run from King Herod, who wanted the baby Jesus killed.

Everyone in town is expecting the Christmas pageant to be a disaster, but the Herdmans&#x27; unconventional performances actually make the whole show much more realistic and moving: instead of walking on and off stage like actors, the Herdmans are a little uncertain about where to go and what to do, as the real-life Holy Family and Wise Men must have been; instead of laying the doll representing Jesus in the manger, Imogene insists on holding it, as if it is really her child; the Wise Men choose to bring the baby Jesus a ham from the Herdmans&#x27; own gift basket instead of the &quot;crummy&quot; frankincense and myrrh from the story; the shepherds are sufficiently terrified of Gladys to look authentically awed by her announcement of Jesus&#x27; birth; and during the final scene, the narrator looks over from the choir and is dumbstruck to see Imogene weeping softly while hugging the &quot;baby&quot;. By common agreement, it &quot;is&quot; the best Christmas pageant the town has ever had.

== Publication and reception ==
Robinson first published the story in &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine before it was adapted into a book, which sold over 800,000 copies.

==Stage and screen adaptations==
The book was adapted by Robinson into a play which was first performed on December 4, 1981 in West Chester, PA, and was first professionally performed on November 26, 1982, by the Seattle Children&#x27;s Theatre. 

The book was adapted into a television movie on ABC in 1983, starring Loretta Swit and Fairuza Balk, then an unknown actress. Robinson also wrote the adaptation&#x27;s teleplay.

The Herdmans were featured in two of Barbara Robinson&#x27;s book sequels, &quot;The Best Halloween Ever&quot; and &quot;The Best School Year Ever.&quot;

Dallas Jenkins, creator and director of the TV series &quot;The Chosen&quot;, announced in late 2023 that he was signed to direct a feature-length film adaptation of the book. Lionsgate and Kingdom Story Company collaborated on the production and filming began in Canada in December 2023. The film was theatrically released on November 8, 2024.

<text>The 2004 Hamburg state election was held on 29 February 2004 to elect the members of the 18th Hamburg Parliament. The election was triggered by the collapse of the coalition government between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Party for a Rule of Law Offensive (PRO), and Free Democratic Party (FDP). The election saw a collapse in support for PRO which had split after its leader Ronald Schill left in 2003. The original party and Schill&#x27;s new party captured 3.5% of the vote between them, down from 19.4% in 2001. A huge amount of support flowed to the CDU, which won 63 of the 121 seats in Parliament, forming a majority government. First Mayor Ole von Beust continued in office.

==Parties==
The table below lists parties represented in the 17th Hamburg Parliament.
==Background==
In August 2003, Mayor von Beust made moves to dismiss an Interior official suspected of corruption. In response, Senator of the Interior Ronald Schill threatened to spread rumours of an affair between von Beust and the Senator of Justice. Schill was subsequently dismissed from the government. In December of the same year, Schill left his own party along with five of its members of Parliament, depriving the government of its majority. He subsequently joined Pro DM.

<doc id="1265171" wikidata="Q3072838" url="?curid=1265171" title="Firefall">
<text>Firefall is an American soft rock band that formed in Boulder, Colorado, in 1974. It was founded by Rick Roberts, former member of the Flying Burrito Brothers, and Jock Bartley, who had been Tommy Bolin&#x27;s replacement in Zephyr. Other members have included Mark Andes, Larry Burnett, David Muse, and Michael Clarke, the latter also formerly of the Flying Burrito Brothers and an original member of the Byrds.

The band&#x27;s biggest hit single, &quot;You Are the Woman&quot;, peaked at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1976. Other hits included &quot;Just Remember I Love You&quot; (#11 in 1977), &quot;Strange Way&quot; (#11 in 1978), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (#34 in 1977), &quot;Headed for a Fall&quot; (#35 in 1980), and &quot;Staying with It&quot; (#37 in 1981).

== History ==
In 1973 Rick Roberts and Jock Bartley met when Bartley was on tour with Gram Parsons as a member of his backing band, the Fallen Angels. Both the Fallen Angels and Roberts were performing in New York City at the same venue on consecutive nights. After the two were reunited in Boulder, Colorado, Roberts was impressed by Bartley&#x27;s guitar work, and the duo soon began practicing together. Encouraged to form a band, they contacted bassist Mark Andes (a former member of the California bands Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne) who had temporarily retired to the mountains outside Boulder, and singer/ guitarist/ composer Larry Burnett (whom Roberts had met in his travels earlier that year). After Andes and Burnett joined in 1974, the band was called Firefall.

Roberts got the name from the Yosemite Firefall at Yosemite National Park in California. The owners of a hotel threw burning logs off a mountain in a cascade as an annual event to entertain the guests.

Guitarist/keyboardist Mark Hallman was another musician considered for Firefall, but Hallman rejected the offer and remained with his band Navarro. The drummer was Michael Clarke, who had been a member of The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers.

=== Breakthrough and success ===
In 1975 Firefall recorded a demo tape consisting of three songs produced by Chris Hillman. Andes, Bartley and Roberts were then brought into Hillman&#x27;s band. Before scheduled performances at The Other End in New York City in June 1975, Hillman became ill and was unable to play all the shows. Burnett and Clarke were then flown in to complete the commitments as Firefall. A&amp;R representatives from Atlantic Records, who had already heard the band&#x27;s demo tape, saw the Other End shows and signed Firefall to a multi-album contract. During the summer, when the contract was signed, Roberts was playing as a member of Stephen Stills&#x27;s band, so work on the band&#x27;s first album was delayed until late 1975. Roberts&#x27; high school friend David Muse was brought in before recording at Criteria Studios in Miami. The producer was Jim Mason, who had worked with the band Poco.

The album &quot;Firefall&quot; was recorded in one month and released in April 1976. The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Livin&#x27; Ain&#x27;t Livin&#x27;&quot;, stopped short of the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. And during the following months, the band toured with Leon Russell, the Doobie Brothers, Tom Waits, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Roy Buchanan, Electric Light Orchestra and The Band, and were also on a bill that included Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Asleep at the Wheel.

The band&#x27;s next single, &quot;You Are the Woman&quot;, reached the Top 10, and the band toured with Fleetwood Mac, who were at the beginning of their commercial peak. Another single, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, was played extensively on FM radio but did not fare as well on AM, barely reaching the Top 40.

Firefall returned to Criteria Studios to record their second album, which was to be titled &quot;Tropical Nights&quot;. They were joined by the Memphis Horns and percussionist Joe Lala, a member of Manassas who had played on Firefall&#x27;s debut album. But after hearing the final mix, Atlantic Records decided that the album needed to be reworked. With Jim Mason producing again, Firefall worked on the album that was renamed &quot;Luna Sea&quot;, a pun on &quot;lunacy&quot;, and released in July 1977. The album peaked at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and was certified gold two months after its release. The single &quot;Just Remember I Love You&quot;, with backing vocals by Timothy B. Schmit, reached No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In a 2012 interview, Roberts recalled what was going on at this time: &quot;Our business managers at that time were Dottie Ross and Mick Schneider, who operated as D&amp;M Management. Although we didn&#x27;t know it, it would appear that Mick Schneider had his own designs on managing the band. I can&#x27;t really prove that, but he had been filling the gap as our de facto manager ever since we had parted company with our last official guy and he was getting pretty comfortable calling the shots. Mick Fleetwood got interested in taking over after we had been touring as an opening act for Fleetwood Mac on their &quot;Rumours&quot; tour. We entered into a spoken agreement with him and he went to work restructuring our recording contract with Atlantic Records. Things happened during that time that made it an unworkable arrangement. The first thing probably went a good way towards undermining any chance of a healthy working relationship with Mick. The band went to his house in Bel Air, California one day to try and hash out a written agreement. It was summertime, so we all went out and sat down around the pool. Present were all the members of the band as well as Mick, his road manager and confidant John Courage and his lawyer, Nick Shapiro. As we started to go through the proposed contract, the band started to function in their usual fashion; disputing every second word and generally being impossible to deal with. We had a very bad habit of that in almost all our business dealings. We also seemed to find a way to make the very worst possible decision at every opportunity. It took us about two hours of haggling to get through the first seven or so paragraphs. Mick&#x27;s lawyer was obviously getting frustrated by the nit picking and we were all getting a little short tempered. The second thing that happened was a lot more serious and probably dealt the killing blow. After Mick had gotten Atlantic to agree to restructure our contract with a sizable cash advance ($500,000 I think) and an increase in the percentage points, Mick Schneider rejected it as not being satisfactory! At that point, Mick (Fleetwood) decided that maybe managing Firefall was not in his best interests. As a result, we went for about another year and a half without an official manager and Mick Schneider stayed in nominal control. We were not the easiest band to work with at any time and considering the fatigue factor, we were probably raging jerks and for all the chart success we had achieved, we were hardly making a decent living. We were mostly serving as an opening act on a lot of &#x27;A&#x27; list tours, and as such, we weren&#x27;t being paid like a band with an unbroken string of gold and platinum albums and more than a half dozen straight top fifty singles. It was nice to be doing shows in sold-out arenas every night, but going home after the tour was over with hardly anything in your pocket dulled the thrill a little. That only increased the tension in the band.&quot;

In 1978 the band brought in Tom Dowd to produce their third album, &quot;Élan&quot;, recording at Criteria and at the Record Plant in Los Angeles. The band and Dowd got along well but they had conflicting musical visions. The differences were apparently noticeable enough that the band&#x27;s management, with help from their friend Mick Fleetwood, pressured the record label into letting them rework the album. It put the group in debt with the label, and within the year they parted ways with their management. The production team of Ron and Howard Albert were brought in to finish the record. &quot;Élan&quot;, released in October 1978, became their first album to reach platinum status. The hit single &quot;Strange Way&quot; continued the band&#x27;s commercial hot streak.

=== Decline ===
After two years of non-stop recording and touring, the band was burned out and their financial situation was unstable. During a tour of Japan in August 1979, Michael Clarke, because of his excessive drinking, missed gigs or showed up in no condition to play. The band resorted to hiring a German drummer, Dan Holsten, whose playing technique was similar to Clarke&#x27;s, to sub. Holsten, who even looked a lot like Clarke, had played in several other bands in the Colorado area and caught the eye of Jock and Larry one night at a Colorado Springs bar. He became known as a reliable back-up drummer for tours and some studio work.

Despite it all, Atlantic Records still expected a new album. The band recorded the album sporadically over a year. The Alberts were again brought in to produce the album. But the work once again required a second effort, which was produced by Kyle Lehning. The result, titled &quot;Undertow&quot;, was released in March 1980. Its would be the last album with the original lineup. Upon completion of the album, Clarke and Mark Andes both left the band. Thirteen years later, in December 1993, Clarke died of alcoholism at his home in Treasure Island, Florida.

Andes and Clarke were replaced by Kenny Loggins&#x27; former rhythm section, consisting of bassist George Hawkins and drummer Tris Imboden. With the two new players, the band recorded &quot;Clouds Across the Sun&quot;, which was released in December 1980, and spawned the early 1981 hit &quot;Staying with It&quot;, which was done as a duet with singer Lisa Nemzo. &quot;Clouds&quot; saw Jock emerging more as a writer and singer and had the band moving more away from their &quot;country rock&quot; direction.

Hawkins resigned from the group in late 1980 to join up with Mick Fleetwood&#x27;s &quot;The Visitor&quot;, a side project the Fleetwood Mac drummer was recording in Africa. After Andes returned to guest for the group&#x27;s February 1981 appearance on American Bandstand, Kim Stone came in to take over bass.

Larry Burnett suddenly disappeared from the group, after playing a show at Miami Baseball Stadium with Heart, Blue Öyster Cult, Motörhead and Freewheel on April 19, 1981, to return to his hometown of Washington, D.C. to enter rehab. (Burnett eventually kicked a serious drug habit and after working in radio in the late 80s/early 90s, began pursuing a solo career in 2004.) The group continued on to play their next show in Las Vegas without him. But after playing a concert with the band in Lahaina, Hawaii with Pure Prairie League in August, Rick Roberts announced that he also was leaving for a solo career. With the band lacking personnel and increasing in financial debt, Atlantic dropped Firefall from their roster in 1981 and released &quot;Best of Firefall&quot; at the close of the year.

Since his departure from Firefall, Roberts has continued to tour on occasion. In the fall of 1981, he played dates in tandem with fellow former Burrito Brother Chris Hillman. In 1985 he was in a Twentieth Anniversary Byrds Tribute band with former Byrds Gene Clark and Michael Clarke. In 1987–89, Roberts teamed up with ex-Eagle Randy Meisner in the short lived Roberts Meisner Band, and after a return spell in Firefall (1989–1992), he was sidelined for health reasons for a number of years before returning to the road as a solo act. In the summer and fall of 2019, he toured together with fellow Firefaller Larry Burnett.

=== Resumption and later work ===

Meanwhile, unhappy with the way things had turned out, Jock Bartley decided to put together a new Firefall lineup in the spring of 1982. At Ron Albert&#x27;s suggestion, Bartley got together with two Miami-based musicians, Johnne Sambataro (during the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, he adopted the conventional spelling of John for his first name) and Chuck Kirkpatrick. Sambataro was a singer/guitarist/keyboardist/bassist/songwriter who had sung on record with Stephen Stills, Eric Clapton, Dave Mason, McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman, the members of the Bee Gees and many others. Johnne and Jock had actually met back in 1978 when they both played on the Criteria sessions for Andy Gibb&#x27;s platinum album &quot;Shadow Dancing&quot;. Kirkpatrick was a singer–guitarist–keyboardist who had sung with Johnne on a number of the aforementioned sessions and had worked as an engineer at Criteria on such albums as Derek &amp; The Dominos&#x27; &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;.

Albert then brought in Alan Jacobi, a Miami entertainment lawyer who had a relationship with Atlantic, and Jacobi convinced the label to help resign the band.

So in the summer of 1982, Criteria sessions for the &quot;Break of Dawn&quot; LP began with Ron and brother Howard producing once again. Backing Bartley, Sambataro and Kirkpatrick were a number of Miami session players, with Stephen Stills and Rick Roberts making guest appearances. The album appeared in September 1982 and Bartley, Johnne and Chuck began auditioning additional players for a follow-up tour. Chuck&#x27;s brother Scott (a top-notch session drummer who, like Johnne, had also played on record and toured with McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman) and Colorado bassist Greg Overton were chosen and, at the last minute, David Muse decided to rejoin the band.

In the winter of 1983, Firefall set out across the U.S. to promote &quot;Break of Dawn&quot;. But the single from it, &quot;Always&quot;, failed to reach the Top 40 and quickly fell off the chart.

&quot;Mirror of the World&quot; followed in November 1983, the title track a comment on the effects of TV violence on children. The album had a much harder edge than its predecessors, with more of an emphasis on an &#x27;80s style synth/drum programmed production, which many of the group&#x27;s fans thought reflected too great a departure from the classic Firefall sound. Though the first single, the rocking &quot;Runaway Love&quot;, written by Bartley, Sambataro, and Paul Crosta, briefly appeared in a video on MTV and received limited radio airplay, this album too failed to attract sales and quickly disappeared.

The group, once again dropped by Atlantic, nevertheless continued to tour, headlining in smaller clubs and opening in larger venues for groups like the Beach Boys, Little River Band, and Bob Seger &amp; the Silver Bullet Band.

In 1983 Overton quit (he would return briefly to play a few shows with the group in Medford, Oregon in July 1986 as a fill-in) and Muse decided to retire from touring again. Steve Hadjoupolos (sax, flute, keyboards, backing vocals) and Bob Gaffney (bass, vocals) were brought in and the group continued. Sandy Ficca was brought in to take over from Scott Kirkpatrick on drums in October 1984 (Scott then returned to play some final shows with the band in June 1985 before moving on permanently) and is still with them to-date.

On the evening of August 4, 1986, Chuck Kirkpatrick was leaving from a local club gig in the area of Florida where he resided. After breaking down on the road home, he was shot and wounded in the arm in a drive-by shooting; the shooter then fled the scene. The wound was serious enough to almost require amputation of Kirkpatrick&#x27;s left arm, but doctors were able to save it and Chuck was able to play again after a difficult rehab period. Many Miami musicians, including Jon Secada and members of the Miami Sound Machine, came to Chuck&#x27;s aid, playing a series of shows to help defray the cost of his medical care and rehab. Firefall brought in Colorado musician Mark Oblinger to sit in for Chuck until he was able to return to the band in November 1986. But Kirkpatrick&#x27;s tenure in the band was coming to an end. In late 1987, Gaffney left and Eddie Gleason came on in the interim. Then Chuck left at the tail end of 1987 after differences with Jock Bartley. Oblinger (who had subbed for both Chuck and Gaffney in 1986) returned as Kirkpatrick&#x27;s permanent replacement in December 1987 and Bil Hopkins was the new bassist. Dan Clawson (ex-Pure Prairie League) came in as well to take the place of Hadjoupolos in early 1988.

In 1989, after seven years in Firefall, Sambataro decided it was also time to say goodbye. He moved on to join Dion DiMucci&#x27;s band. This paved the way for the return of Rick Roberts and in September 1992, Rhino Records responded to the demand to put out Firefall music on CD by releasing &quot;Firefall: The Greatest Hits&quot;, which featured all of the singles and AOR favorites and one new song, &quot;Run Run Away&quot;, about adult victims of earlier child abuse.

In the early/mid 1990s, the personnel shuffles continued. Roberts, who was suffering from health troubles, left again in the spring of 1992 to be replaced by Bruce Crichton, who turned it over to Steve Manshel in June 1993. Mark Oblinger departed as well and Steven Weinmeister came on board in May 1993. And after Dan Clawson left that same year, there were several people to occupy the woodwind–keyboards chair, including Bray Ghiglia (1993–1994), the returning David Muse (1994–1995; 2000–2003; 2011–2022), Jim Waddell (1993; 1995–96; 1998–2000; 2003; 2022–present), Bob Fisher (1996–1998; 2007) and Chris Ball (2003–2011).

While touring in 1993, Firefall encountered the Flood of 1993. One of their gigs was cancelled and a few had to be moved to higher ground. In response Jock wrote &quot;When The River Rises&quot;, a song with an upbeat message of finding strength in adversity. The band recorded the song in Colorado Springs at Startsong Recording Studio, with engineer–programmer Tom Gregor co-producing with Bartley. &quot;When The River Rises&quot; was then brought back to St. Louis and played on the radio for the first time. At that point, the flood waters had still not crested. Vowing to donate a large portion of the publishing to flood relief, the song was sent to other radio stations in the flooded areas. It received heavy regional airplay and was also used by CNN and other TV stations behind coverage of the disaster.

With the band&#x27;s profile raised, the search for a new record deal began. Some smaller companies showed interest. They decided to go with an independent Colorado based label, Redstone Records, who had had some successes in the smooth jazz genre. &quot;Messenger&quot; was recorded in Denver and Boulder and was released in September 1994. Bartley had been stockpiling songs for ten years for just this opportunity. Bil Hopkins&#x27;s song &quot;Say It&#x27;s Over&quot; (written with Mark Oblinger) and Steve Manshel&#x27;s &quot;Innocent Victim&quot; also appeared on the CD. Mark Andes and Richie Furay made guest appearances on the album and Jim Mason returned to the producer&#x27;s chair. &quot;Messenger&quot; was much more diverse than anything the band had released to date with the usual love songs and ballads, but there were also songs about child abuse, environmental catastrophe and even sexual abuse/rape in the chilling &quot;No Means No&quot;. The first single, &quot;Love Find A Way&quot;, received some minor play on some stations, but Redstone did not have the distribution clout to get the CD into all stores, so overall sales were disappointing.

Manshel, who had begun to take time off from the group to work on a solo album, left altogether in September 1999 to pursue his own career and the band reverted to a five-piece. Other than short-term fill-ins (Steve Jenks subbed for Hopkins in the spring and summer of 1998 and Gary Jones sat in for Weinmeister — who had a previous obligation to play a wedding in Belize — for a Firefall gig on November 12, 1999, opening for Journey at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco and one for Hopkins in June 2002), Bartley, Weinmeister, Hopkins, and Sandy Ficca continued on as Firefall from late 1999 until Hopkins left in 2014.

From 2005 on, Firefall would sometimes play a handful of shows annually as &quot;Acoustic Firefall&quot; in various combinations, with the most common being the trio of Jock, Steve, and Bil. And on April 9, 2008, at Boulder Theater in Boulder, Colorado, there was a Firefall reunion concert that featured the current lineup joined by Mark Andes, David Muse, Larry Burnett, and original Firefall studio percussionist Joe Lala. Rick Roberts attended the show as well but was unable to perform with the others because of health issues. As previously mentioned, Michael Clarke had died in 1993. The reunion appeared as the CD &quot;Firefall Reunion Live&quot; in February 2009. Since 2008, Jock&#x27;s son, Jamey Crow Bartley, sometimes guests with the band on drums and will fill in for Sandy Ficca on occasion. During the summer of 2011, David Muse, who just survived a bout with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, returned to play shows with Firefall once again, alternating with Chris Ball before rejoining permanently.

Apart from Firefall, in 2012 original and then current Firefall members Jock Bartley and David Muse reunited with Rick Roberts and studio percussionist Joe Lala in the supergroup Boulder County Conspiracy. Other members of this band included Bobby Caldwell (Captain Beyond, Johnny Winter, Rick Derringer), Max Combs, Allen Carman, and Billy Sandlin. They toured throughout 2012 performing songs by Firefall, Captain Beyond, The Marshall Tucker Band, and Spirit as well as other originals and covers. They disbanded at the end of 2012.

In February 2014 founding member and bassist Mark Andes rejoined the band. In June 2014, Jace Hill (guitar and vocals) joined the band for a short spell to sub for Steven Weinmeister, who was back by early July. In November 2014, the Colorado Music Hall of Fame announced that Firefall would be among the 2014 inductees at a January 2015 event at the Paramount Theater in Denver. In late 2014, Steven Weinmeister departed Firefall after almost twenty two years but did return in January 2015 for the Colorado Music Hall of Fame induction and to sub for an ill Bartley later that same year for dates on the east coast, in August. He was succeeded by singer/guitarist Gary Jones (who had previously subbed for Weinmeister for the one aforementioned gig back in November 1999 and for a few other shows in September 2014).

By late 2014, Firefall&#x27;s lineup was Jock Bartley, David Muse, Sandy Ficca, Mark Andes, and Gary Jones.

On January 9, 2015, Firefall was inducted into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame with Poco, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Stephen Stills, and Manassas, at the Paramount Theater in Denver.

Former Firefall bass player (in 1980) George Hawkins died on October 26, 2018, after a bout with cancer.

In August 2019 after Mark Andes was sidelined after a hip replacement. Lance Hoppen (of Orleans), John Trujillo (a bassist friend of Sandy Ficca&#x27;s) and former Firefall member Steven Weinmeister filled in for him.

The band released &quot;Comet&quot;, their first new album in nearly 20 years, and first with Sunset Blvd Records, on December 11, 2020. The album featured a lineup of Jock Bartley, Mark Andes, David Muse, Sandy Ficca and Gary Jones.

In 2021 Firefall again did some shows as a trio, this time with Bartley, Jones and a returning Steve Weinmeister on bass, who ended up returning to the group to replace Jones going forward.

In 2022 David Muse was sidelined from touring after having once again fallen ill with cancer, that this time took his life on August 6, 2022. Jim Waddell, who had first played with Firefall in 1993, returned to cover for Muse.

In July 2022 after Mark Andes retired from the road, current Babys singer/bassist John Bisaha joined the lineup.

In 2023 Firefall announced that their latest album, &quot;Friends &amp; Family&quot;, would feature classic songs from other 1970s bands, including the Doobie Brothers, Heart, Fleetwood Mac, Loggins and Messina, the Band, Marshall Tucker Band and more. It was released on September 22.

<text>The Warrego River is an intermittent river that is part of the Darling catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, which is located in South West Queensland and in the Orana region of New South Wales, Australia. The Warrego River is the northernmost tributary of the Darling River.

==Course and features==
The river rises from below Mount Ka Ka Mundi in the Carnarvon Range, near Tambo in Queensland, and flows generally south, reaching its confluence with the Darling River, downstream from Bourke. The river is joined by thirty-seven tributaries, including the Nive and Langlo rivers; descending over its course. The river flows through a series of reservoirs, including the Dillalah Waterhole, Ten Mile Waterhole, Lower Lila Dam, Six Mile Dam, Turtle Waterhole, and Boera Dam.

The towns of Augathella, Charleville, Wyandra and Cunnamulla are located on the banks of the river.

===Inflows===
Most of the basin of the Warrego is too dry for cropping and has a very erratic rainfall of between . It is covered with a natural vegetation of grassland on more fertile clay soils, and saltbush shrubland on less fertile red earths. The predominant land use is low-intensity grazing of sheep and cattle: the river&#x27;s flow is much too erratic to permit irrigated cropping. The Warrego is essentially an ephemeral stream: it is not unknown for years to pass without any flow in the basin and substantial amounts of water reach the Darling River only in wet years almost always associated with &quot;La Niña&quot; events.

===Outflows===
Below Wyandra the river forms a series of outflowing creeks and anabranches. During floods, the Widgeegoara, Kudnapper and Noorama Creeks allow water to channel into Nebine Creek, a tributary of the Culgoa River. Cuttaburra Creek connects the Warrego to the Paroo River via a distribution system that flows through channels, floodways and wetlands. The Irrara Creek anabranch flows into Kerribree Creek which continues into a number of wetlands before filling Utah Lake.

===Flooding===
When &quot;La Niña&quot; occurs, flooding is usual along the Warrego: major floods associated with &quot;La Niña&quot; events occurred in 1950, 1954 to 1956, 1971, 1973, 1998 and 2008. Oddly, the most destructive flood ever recorded on the river took place in the absence of &quot;La Niña&quot;. In April 1990, as a result of two extremely strong troughs in the easterlies, over of rain fell in Cunnamulla in two weeks, being more than the annual rainfall in over 60 percent of years. The river, along with most tributaries of the Darling, reached near-record levels and the towns of Augathella and Charleville were devastated. At Charleville a river height peak of was recorded.

==Fauna==
The Warrego River is one of a few rivers where silver perch breed naturally. Golden perch and murray cod are also found in the river.

Carnarvon Station, once a large cattle property at the rivers headwaters, was acquired by the Australian Bush Heritage Fund in 2001, with the property set aside for the protection of threatened species of birds and animals.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Warrego&quot; is an Australian Aboriginal word from the Bidyara language, believed to mean &quot;bad&quot;; and is also an Aboriginal term meaning &quot;river of sand&quot;.

Two warships of the Royal Australian Navy have been named after the river. The Warrego Highway draws its name from the river.

== Cultural Heritage ==
Bidjara (also known as Bidyara, Pitjara, Peechara) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Bidjara people. The Bidjara language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Murweh Shire Council, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall as well as the properties of Nive Downs and Mount Tabor.

Gunya (also known as Kunya, Kunja, Kurnja) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Gunya people. The Gunya language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Paroo Shire Council, taking in Cunnamulla and extending north towards Augathella, east towards Bollon and west towards Thargomindah.

<doc id="1265174" wikidata="Q5300102" url="?curid=1265174" title="Double the Fist">
<text>Double the Fist is an Australian satirical television show which airs on ABC. It follows the misadventures of four men and their pursuit of &quot;fist-worthiness&quot;: host Steve Foxx (Craig Anderson), and his three offsiders; Rod Foxx (Bryan Moses), Mephisto (Doug Bayne), and The Womp (Tony Walters).
The series has also been broadcast in the United Kingdom (Ftn), Canada (BBCK), Spain (Buzz), New Zealand (TV2) and Brazil.

==Synopsis==

The show parodies many things about popular culture, primarily being a spoof of shows such as &quot;Jackass&quot;; whereas they perform stunts designed to injure and/or humiliate an individual, the &quot;Fist&quot; team do things that would kill them. Such as jumping off cliffs, being hit by trucks, getting shot in the head, etc. These dangerous stunts and outlandish actions are usually achieved with the use of computer-generated imagery. One of the most innovative and noteworthy features of &quot;Double the Fist&quot; is its extensive and imaginative use of CGI, especially considering that the programme was produced for a very low budget, even by Australian standards ($250,000 for all 8 episodes).

==Characters==
* Steve Foxx (Craig Anderson) is the host of &quot;Double the Fist&quot;. He invented the concept of &quot;fistworthiness&quot; and &quot;betterment through extremities.&quot; An expert at crushing all that is weak, Steve is finally ready to begin his War on Weakness. However, lately, Steve has had trouble controlling his team: Rod feels underappreciated, Mephisto has become rebellious, Womp has been fired for incompetence and Panda has fallen for a mime. Steve&#x27;s brutal double-fisted rule seems to be slipping.
* Rod Foxx (Bryan Moses) (or &quot;the Hot Rod&quot; as he sometimes calls himself) is the younger brother of Steve Foxx. It is said he attends a sporting institute and lists his job as an &#x27;all-round athlete&#x27;. His main interests include physical activity and singing. Although he does have a reasonable amount of sporting talent and can be successful on the dating scene, his ego knows no limits and he seems to be delusional. He has &#x27;released&#x27; a single, entitled &quot;I C U (Picture Perfect)&quot;, which details a man&#x27;s (Rod&#x27;s) obsession with a (presumably) under-age school girl as he stalks her and takes pictures of her changing and at the pool without her knowledge. Has a severe addiction to sexual harassment, resulting in him being shot, slashed, and stabbed in that order.
* Mephisto (Doug Bayne) (aka James Wenham) may or may not have been a security guard at one time or another, but it is certain that he did take a three-week training course in security guarding, and has retained some of the knowledge from that course. According to the &quot;Double the Fist&quot; website, he is on the run from multiple taxation agencies. He was at one time temporarily possessed by an Aztec demigod, and at another time the leader of an army of medieval re-enactors. It would be safe to say that Mephisto is of questionable sanity. (By safe, it is meant &quot;probably true&quot;; questioning Mephisto&#x27;s sanity would likely land you in a position of danger if Mephisto found out).
* The Womp (Tony Walters) (aka Womp aka Christopher Bradley aka Olaf) used to have a day job performing backbreaking labour, and was also an amateur wrestler. However, a groin injury on the job forced him to give up his wrestling career. He was then offered, and accepted, a position on&quot; Double the Fist&quot;. The Womp is also mentally disabled, due to a brain injury when he was a child. Briefly grew antlers to indicate newfound responsibility, but lost them in the next episode. His catchphrase, whenever he was asked a question about how he feels was &quot;Ah, yeah...pretty good&quot;.
* Tara (Hollie Andrew) is a vending machine assassin introduced in episode 10. She joined the Fist team after Steve destroyed the local council and captured the jar of tokens that control her, but she was effectively killed when the tokens were destroyed in Episode 13. Rod revived her by hotwiring her in Episode 16, and she met her end in the Great Battle.
* Blue Womp is a clone of Womp, with identical physical features, although he is more self-centered and mean. He is so-called because he wears blue to avoid confusion with the other Womp (who always wears orange). Savagely beaten by Steve for stepping too far out of line in episode 5, he returns in episode 8, now a whimpering wreck, where Steve makes him shoot himself with a cannon to prove he is sorry.
* Tina T (Neridah Waters) is introduced in episode five, as a replacement for the missing-in-action Mephisto. She appears to be smarter than the rest of the team, but truthfully this is not saying much. She and Rod had a brief romance, which ended when Rod tried to grope her while he thought she was dead. After slicing Rod&#x27;s spine open in the next episode, Tina seems to be satisfied with her revenge and has not been seen or heard from since.
* Panda (Lawrence Carmichael) is just that - a person in a panda suit. The character is almost always referred to as female. She will often show up to provide opposition (such as in episodes three and five), but will sometimes help Steve out by moderating races or chasing down enemies. In series two, Panda falls in love with a mime, of which Steve disapproves. Panda is then accidentally killed in a trap set up by Steve in a botched attempt to force the mime (who was mute) to speak. It is revealed on the DVD&#x27;s &quot;How to Make Double the Fist&quot; featurette that Craig Anderson usually plays Panda.
* Phillip Nugent First introduced in episode 2; Extreme Makeover. He is the mayor of Kanangra council and stops the Fist team recording the show in Kanangra. Although this is the only episode he appears in, he is frequently mentioned and criticised in other episodes and also sends a letter complaining to ABC about the &quot;Double the Fist&quot; show. On the &quot;Double the Fist&quot; website it is revealed that he is the cousin of the host of Town and Country.

==Series one==

Steve will set the Fist team a task. Completing this task will result in the presentation of the &quot;Full Fist&quot;, which earns an individual respect amongst the &#x27;extreme community&#x27;. The team may have to compete with each other or may have to work together. Steve Foxx is the only person who can present a Full Fist. Characters die frequently, sometimes several times in an episode. Footage of the team attempting the task is interspersed with various recurring segments.

==Series two==

Series 2 differs from Series 1 in that it follows a single storyline, which is usually affected by continuity. Each episode contains a separate part of Steve&#x27;s plan, and a new award, the &#x27;Man of Fist&#x27;, is presented to the most fistworthy team member each week. In the eye of the public, it is often seen as disliked when compared to season one.

However, the second series featured an in-depth storyline (possibly added to increase the show&#x27;s praise), and vastly improved digital effects. Some minor aspects that were made in or changed in Season 2 included Rod&#x27;s appearance being made more memorable by a mullet adorned with lightning bolts shaved into the sides of his head. Steve is vastly less tolerant of any sign of weakness expressed by his team (possibly due to their failure in Episode 7), often physically abusing them for no reason at all, and losing his apparent ability to appear anywhere to commentate on the team&#x27;s progress. Kanangra is no longer a factor but is mentioned in Episode 2 to show Steve&#x27;s familiarity with councils. The characters were seen talking more, hence we learn that Womp is mostly disliked, and Rod and Mephisto have a minor friendship. We also learn that Steve is not the creator of Fistworthiness, having learned it from ancient monks. However, we also learn that Steve was displeased with the peaceful use of Fistworthiness and changed it into his violent version (which nonetheless proved to be less powerful).

==History==
The four men who play the central characters have a long history. Anderson, Moses, and Walters met at the University of Western Sydney - Anderson and Walters &#x27;performing absurdist theatre&#x27; and Moses making amateur films. The three teamed up to make a short film entitled &quot;Life in a Datsun&quot; which won the best comedy award at the 1999 Tropfest film festival. It was here they met Bayne, who caught their eye with his computer-generated effects and his 30-second film called &quot;God Saves the Titanic&quot;. The four men then made &quot;Video Dare&quot;, a spoof reality show for SBS, which received 100 complaints. From 2002 to 2003, the team, minus Anderson who was lecturing at the time, made &quot;Saturday Morning Fly&quot;, a kid&#x27;s music/comedy program for ABC. Their work on &quot;Video Dare&quot; and &quot;Saturday Morning Fly&quot; allowed the team to perfect their use of special effects and the pilot for &quot;Double the Fist&quot; was soon made. It was eventually picked up by the ABC&#x27;s head of arts and entertainment, Courtney Gibson, and an eight-part series was approved.

The ABC was divided over whether or not to produce a second series. In March 2006, after several attempts by the creators and support from fans via an online petition, the ABC commissioned a second series. Series 2 began on 14 August 2008.

==Awards==

In 2004, &quot;Double the Fist&quot; caused some controversy when it won an AFI award in the category of Best Television Comedy- Sit-com or Sketch. According to &quot;From Nobodies to Nobodies,&quot; a DVD documentary on Series One, Volume Two, which chronicles the history of the show and its creators up to that point, the main reaction from the general media and public regarding their achievement of the award, ranged from disappointment to downright disgust for some.

One of the main reasons for the outbursts was that amongst the nominees of the 2004 awards was the more prominent Australian comedy &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;. Compared to that series, &quot;Double the Fist&quot; was not as well known, and the comedy was deemed by the casual observer as something more akin to the American show &quot;Jackass&quot;. During a press conference after the ceremony, the boys from the show were asked only one question which was about how it felt to beat &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;. The following day, many newspaper columnists printed their disgust that such a puerile and juvenile show had been selected by the AFI over the more popular &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; with one describing it as &quot;the unfunniest joke of the night&quot;.

This is, however, a feat the &quot;Double the Fist&quot; team continues to relish - an extra on the Series One, Volume Two DVD contains instructions on how to make a &quot;Double the Fist&quot; Box Set using the inside cover of Volume Two and a &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; Box Set, where one of the instructions involved using a block splitter to destroy the contents of the &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; Box Set (namely the DVD and the DVD slips) and burning them so they could never be seen again.

Special guest, James Paley appeared in several specials for the series in late 2009 which won him several Logie Award nominations.

==Related media==

===Website===
Craig Anderson and Doug Bayne are currently working on a new interactive &quot;Double The Fist&quot; website, which will feature weekly content, tricks and games, and a Steve Foxx blog. The site is currently up and running, although some of the promised features have yet to be completed. The site is no longer available.

===Merchandise===
On 14 July 2004, the &quot;Double The Fist Volume 1&quot; DVD was released in Australia, which contains episodes 1-4 as well as special features including a documentary called &quot;How to Make Double the Fist&quot;, deleted scenes, and a &#x27;photo gallery&#x27;. A book was also released that year. On 8 June 2006, the &quot;Double The Fist Volume 2&quot; DVD was released, which contains episodes 5-8 and also contains more special features and a never-before-seen episode.

<text>Norma Daniela Candal Penedo (April 10, 1927 – February 5, 2006), was a Puerto Rican actress and comedian who was best known for her role as Petunia on &quot;La criada malcriada&quot;.

==Early years==
Norma Daniela Candal Penedo was born in 1927 in Fajardo, Puerto Rico to Eladio José Candal and María Isabel Penedo. She lived with her family on the Fajardo Sugar Company&#x27;s sugar plantation, where her father was an accountant. She attended the Colegio del Sagrado Corazon (Sacred Heart School) in her hometown, where she obtained her primary and secondary education. When she was 9 years old, she participated in her first Christmas school play.

Candal enrolled in the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón, where she earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Humanities. She was planning on a political career and was going to study political sciences, however after she was granted a scholarship to The Catholic University of America (CUA) in Washington, D.C., she changed her goals and went on to earn her Master&#x27;s Degree in Theater. Candal returned to Puerto Rico upon her graduation.

Candal was also a literature and acting teacher.

==&quot;Petunia&quot;==
In 1965, she was hired by Rafael Perez Perry as the host of the television show &quot;En Alas de la Imaginacion&quot; (On the Wings of the Imagination) which aired on WKVM TV Channel 11. Shortly thereafter, she joined Tommy Muñiz Productions in Channel 4 WAPA TV.

It was during this period of time that Candal garnered fame in Puerto Rico. She worked in the shows &quot;Aquí con Norma&quot; (&quot;Here with Norma&quot;); &quot;El Show del Mediodía&quot; (&quot;The Midday Show&quot;), and &quot;La Criada Malcriada&quot; (&quot;The Rude Maid&quot;), in which she played the comical role of Petunia, a simple-minded maid. This is the role which garnered her the most fame of her career. She also hosted or co-hosted talk shows.

In 1970, there was a strike against Tommy Muñiz Productions, which forced Candal to leave the show and join ASTRA Productions, for which she did a couple of shows. Candal stopped working in television for several years after undergoing open heart surgery in which she had a valve replacement.

In 1980, Candal went to work for Cardinal Luis Aponte Martínez at the Cathedral of San Juan. In 1985, she returned to television and starred as Doña Tere in &quot;La Pensión de Doña Tere&quot; (Mrs. Tere&#x27;s Boarding House). She participated in the Spanish-language version of the play &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;; &quot;The Letters of Mozart&quot;; &quot;The Old Maids of San Sebastian Street&quot;, and &quot;Kisses on the Forehead&quot;.

==Later years==
She played different roles in the films &quot;Díos los Cría 1&quot; and its sequel, (&quot;God Creates Them, parts 1 &amp; 2&quot;). The first part was filmed and released in 1979, the second in 2004. In between she also appeared in &quot;La Guagua Aérea&quot; (&quot;Flight of Dreams&quot;) in 1993.

==Death==
On Friday, February 3, 2006, Candal suffered a fall in her home in Trujillo Alto, hitting her head on the floor. She was hospitalized at the Pavia Hospital in San Juan where she suffered additional complications from the loss of blood. Candal died on Sunday, February 5, 2006, aged 78. She was buried alongside her mother at Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Candal was survived by her two children, Norma and Andres Jr.

<doc id="1265182" wikidata="Q559866" url="?curid=1265182" title="Alciphron">
<text>Alciphron () was an ancient Greek sophist, and the most eminent among the Greek epistolographers. Regarding his life or the age in which he lived we possess no direct information whatsoever.

==Works==
We possess under the name of Alciphron 116 fictional letters, in 3 books, the object of which is to delineate the characters of certain classes of men by introducing them as expressing their peculiar sentiments and opinions upon subjects with which they were familiar. The classes of persons which Alciphron chose for this purpose are fishermen, country people, parasites, and &quot;hetaerae&quot; or Athenian courtesans. All are made to express their sentiments in the most graceful and elegant language, even where the subjects are of a low or obscene kind. The characters are thus somewhat raised above their common standard, without any great violation of the truth of reality.

The form of these letters is exquisitely beautiful, and the language is the pure Attic dialect, such as it was spoken in the best times in familiar but refined conversation at Athens, even though the imaginary writers are country people, fishermen, parasites and courtesans. The city from which the letters are dated is, with a few exceptions, Athens and its vicinity; and the time, wherever it is discernible, is the period after the reign of Alexander the Great. The Attic New Comedy was the principal source from which the author derived his information respecting the characters and manners which he describes, and for this reason these letters contain much valuable information about the private life of the Athenians of that time.

It has been said that Alciphron was an imitator of Lucian; but besides the style, and, in a few instances, the subject matter, there is no resemblance between the two writers: the spirit in which the two treat their subjects is totally different. Both derived their materials from the same sources, and in style both aimed at the greatest perfection of the genuine Attic Greek. Classical scholar Stephan Bergler has remarked that Alciphron stands in the same relation to Menander as Lucian to Aristophanes.

==Date==
Some earlier critics placed him, without any plausible reason, in the 5th century BC. The classical scholar Stephan Bergler, and others who followed him, placed Alciphron in the period between Lucian and Aristaenetus, that is, between 170 and 350 AD, while others again assign to him a date even earlier than the time of Lucian. Among the letters of Aristaenetus there are two between Lucian and Alciphron; and it has been inferred that Alciphron was a contemporary of Lucian.

==Editions==
The first edition of Alciphron&#x27;s letters is that of Italian printer Aldus Manutius, in his collection of the &quot;Greek Epistolographers&quot;, Venice, 1499, 4to. This edition, however, contains only those letters which, in more modern editions, form the first two books. Seventy-two new letters were added from a Vienna and a Vatican manuscript by Stephan Bergler, in his edition (Leipzig, 1715, 8vo.) with notes and a Latin translation. These seventy-two epistles form the third book in Bergler&#x27;s edition. J. A. Wagner, in his edition (Leipzig, 1798, 2 vols, 8vo.), with the notes of Bergler), added two new letters entire, and fragments of five others. One long letter, which as of the 19th century had not been published entire in English, exists in several Paris manuscripts.

<doc id="1265191" wikidata="Q931780" url="?curid=1265191" title="Alzira, Spain">
<text>Alzira (; ) is a city and municipality of 47,335 inhabitants (62,094 floating population) in Valencia, eastern Spain. It is the capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Ribera Alta in the province of Valencia. The city is the heart of the second largest urban agglomeration in the province, with a population of over 100,000.

==Geographic situation==

Alzira is located in the province of Valencia, on the left bank of the Xúquer river, and on the Valencia–Alicante railway.

Alzira&#x27;s climate is typically Mediterranean: warm with no extremes of temperature either in summer or winter. Rainfall is scarce and irregular. Torrential rains usually follow periods of relative drought.

The town is situated on the shores of the Xúquer river and contains the Murta and Casella valleys. Alzira&#x27;s borough extends over 111 square kilometres.

==History==
Alzira was founded by Andalusis under the name &quot;Jazīrah Shukr&quot; () Arabic for &quot;island along the Xúquer&quot;, shortened to &quot;al-Jazìra&quot; in late Andalusi Arabic and early Valencian Romance, from which it was taken into Spanish.

It was a prosperous trading station during Andalusis&#x27; time, which lasted over five hundred years. During that time the city had a local administrative government and was considered as a cultural hub for writers, philosophers, and law experts.

The city was conquered by James I of Aragon on 30 December 1242.

Alzira, located right on the bank of the Xúquer, has suffered devastating floods throughout its history - in particular in 1472, 1590, 1864, 1916, 1957, 1982, 1987, 2006 and 2024

Alzira has historically been a walled town, surrounded by palm, orange and mulberry groves, and by low-lying rice-swamps, which rendered its neighborhood somewhat unhealthy. It is sometimes identified with the Roman &quot;Saetabicula&quot; or with the pre-Roman &quot;Sucro&quot;. The mutiny at Sucro of 206 BC, suppressed by Scipio Africanus, was possibly at or near present-day Alzira.

==Economy==

Agriculture was the prime economic driving force in Alzira up to the mid-20th century. The most important produce are oranges and they are distributed by important local co-operatives.

During the 20th century, Alzira changed from an agricultural economy to a diverse industry-orientated city with an important commercial infrastructure and associated services. Many companies have their head-office in the city: building and publishing companies, diverse manufacturers, textile and ice cream factories, etc. Alzira has become a very important commercial city due to its influence area, which is estimated about 300,000 inhabitants.

==Healthcare==
Alzira has a 250-bed Community Hospital, the Hospital de la Ribera, which was built in 1999 by UTE-Ribera, under a Private Finance Initiative scheme. This capitation based system with integration between primary and secondary care providers and a unified IT system across all services has become known as the Alzira model and received a great deal of attention. The quality of services appears to be considerably higher than other health care systems.
== Main sights ==

* Monastery of la Murta: It is constituted of buildings rising in the following three periods: 11th to 15th century, 16th century, and 17th century. In the 19th century, after the expropriation, his new owner raised a manor over the hospice of the monastery. The Monastery also has a partition battlemented wall. Nowadays, In the garden. There are still remainders gathering in the walls. In that way, it has prepared to increase the defensive function.

Foster chapel of &quot;La Verge de la Murta&quot;, after it was a sacristy.
* Alzira walled circuit: The walls of Alzira were built around a possible river island, from which derives its name in Arabic (Al-Jazira: The Island) had a dual purpose, first the defense, and second the flood protection of Xúquer river. The walls were buried by the river, which floods the city from three to four times a year. The walled circuit was formed by a double wall which today contains the historical center of &quot;la Vila&quot;, dated in the Islamic period where some of the mosques and baths were settled. Nowadays, the remains are located in two areas of the city, &quot;el parc de les muralles&quot; and &quot;les muralles del Mercat Antic&quot;.
* Town council hall of Alzira: This building has a civil Gothic style of the Crown of Aragon. Its oldest part dates from the 16th century and, although we can say that the construction of its plant obeys to medieval patterns alternating the Ghotic style and the Baroque.

It is inserted into the so-called &quot;Reconquista&quot; churches with a single ground covered with a cannon vault open with lunettes and open chapels between buttresses, covered with a mid-cannon vault. Over the transept, a drum covered by a dome over scallops sets up. This was replaced by a new double-sloped roof that covers the entire temple 
* Mare de Déu del Lluch Sanctuary of Alzira: Construction built in a neo-Romanesque style. The temple of three naves is covered with groin vault, while the major chapel is fixed with another kind of vault.

To the left, the bell tower rises separated into three sections and covered with pyramidal spire. In the central part of the second section, there are two windows which placed one above the other emphasizes the verticality of the entire monument. The third section separated from the previous one by a decorated wide strip includes the group of bells.

<text>The Russian National Orchestra () was founded in Moscow in 1990 by pianist and conductor Mikhail Pletnev. It was the first Russian orchestra to perform at the Apostolic Palace, Vatican City and in Israel.

== History ==
The RNO&#x27;s first recording (1991) was Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 6, &quot;Pathétique,&quot; released on Virgin Classics. Since then, the orchestra has made over 80 recordings for Deutsche Grammophon, Pentatone, Ondine, Warner Classics and other labels, and with conductors that include RNO Founder and Artistic Director Mikhail Pletnev, Vladimir Jurowski, Paavo Järvi, Kent Nagano, Carlo Ponti, José Serebrier and Vasily Petrenko. Notable releases include the complete Beethoven symphonies and piano concertos on Deutsche Grammophon, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s six symphonies for Pentatone, and the RNO Shostakovich project, also on Pentatone.

The RNO&#x27;s recording of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; and Beintus&#x27;s &quot;Wolf Tracks&quot;, conducted by Kent Nagano and narrated by Sophia Loren, Bill Clinton and Mikhail Gorbachev, was the winner of a 2004 Grammy Award, making the RNO the first Russian orchestra ever to win this honor. A Spanish-language version narrated by Antonio Banderas was released in 2007, following a Russian version narrated by actors Oleg Tabakov and Sergei Bezrukov, with a Mandarin edition following in 2011. Narrators in concert versions of these works have included actors Danny Glover, Diana Douglas, Sean Dill and Debbie Allen, model Tatiana Sorokko, Singaporean violinist Min Lee, and BBC anchor Seva Novgorodsev.

Touring annually, the RNO appears in the music capitals of Europe, Asia and the Americas, and is a frequent guest at festivals such as Edinburgh, the BBC Proms, Festival Napa Valley, and Festival of the Arts BOCA. In 2009 the RNO launched its own annual festival, the RNO Grand Festival, held each September to open the Moscow season. The tenth anniversary festival was held from September 10 to October 4, 2018.

RNO concerts are often aired on National Public Radio, the European Broadcasting Union, and Russia&#x27;s Kultura channel.

In 2008, a panel of international critics assembled by Gramophone named the Russian National Orchestra as one of the world&#x27;s top orchestras.

The RNO maintains two outreach programs in the US and Russia: Cultural Allies, encompassing exchanges between artists in Russia and the West and the commissioning of new works; and the Magic of Music, bringing RNO musicians to play for children in Moscow&#x27;s orphanages, special facilities for the mentally and physically disabled, and bringing school children to concert halls in Moscow for RNO children&#x27;s concerts. In the two decades since the Magic of Music program was created, it has expanded to the US with Russian National Orchestra musicians performing for school children while on tour. 

The Russian National Orchestra is a private institution supported by individuals, corporations and foundations in Russia and throughout the world. Organizations that support the RNO include the Russian Arts Foundation, Prince Michael of Kent Foundation, Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation, Mikhail Prokhorov Foundation, and the Trust for Mutual Understanding.

<text>Barbara Robinson (October 24, 1927 – July 9, 2013) was an American author and writer of the children&#x27;s books &quot;The Best Christmas Pageant Ever&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Best School Year Ever&quot; (1994).

==Biography==
Barbara Robinson was born and raised in Portsmouth, Ohio, and had no brothers or sisters. Her father died when she was three. Robinson&#x27;s mother, a schoolteacher in Portsmouth for forty-nine years, got her interested in books, and she began writing very early. Robinson attended Allegheny College, where she received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theater.

In addition to her children&#x27;s books, Robinson wrote many short stories in publications such as &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot; and &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;, and has some books of poetry.

Robinson lived in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. She died July 9, 2013, at her home in Berwyn. She was 85 and had cancer. Robinson had two daughters with her husband John F. Robinson: Carolyn and Marjorie; three grandchildren: Tomas, Marcos, and Lucas.

<text>In soil science, podzols, also known as podosols, spodosols, or espodossolos, are the typical soils of coniferous or boreal forests and also the typical soils of eucalypt forests and heathlands in southern Australia. In Western Europe, podzols develop on heathland, which is often a construct of human interference through grazing and burning. In some British moorlands with podzolic soils, cambisols are preserved under Bronze Age barrows.

== Term ==
Podzol means &quot;under-ash&quot; and is derived from the Russian () + (&#x27;); the full form is (&#x27;), meaning &quot;under-ashed soil&quot;. The term was first given in mid-1875 by Vasily Dokuchaev. It refers to the common experience of Russian peasants of plowing up an apparent under-layer of ash (leached or E horizon) during first plowing of a virgin soil of that type.

== Characteristics ==
Podzols can occur on almost any parent material but generally derive from either quartz-rich sands and sandstone or sedimentary debris from magmatic rocks, provided there is high precipitation. Most Podzols are poor soils for agriculture due to the sandy portion, resulting in a low level of moisture and nutrients. Some are sandy and excessively drained. Others have shallow rooting zones and poor drainage due to subsoil cementation. A low pH further compounds issues, along with phosphate deficiencies and aluminum toxicity. The best agricultural use of Podzols is for grazing, although well-drained loamy types can be very productive for crops if lime and fertilizer are used.

The E horizon (or Ae in Canadian soil classification system), which is usually thick, is low in Fe and Al oxides and humus. It is formed under moist, cool and acidic conditions, especially where the parent material, such as granite or sandstone, is rich in quartz. It is found under a layer of organic material in the process of decomposition, which is usually thick. In the middle, there is often a thin horizon of . The bleached soil horizon, which always has a higher value than the horizons above and below it, goes over into a red or red-brown horizon (so-called Podzolic B). The colour is strongest in the upper part, and change at a depth of progressively to the part of the soil that is mainly not affected by processes; that is the parent material. The soil profiles are designated by the letters A (topsoil), E ( soil), B (subsoil) and C (parent material).

In some Podzols, the E horizon is absent—either masked by biological activity or obliterated by disturbance. Podzols with little or no E horizon development are often classified as brown Podzolic soils, also called Umbrisols or Umbrepts.

==Geographic distribution==


Podzols cover about worldwide and are usually found under sclerophyllous woody vegetation. By extent Podzols are most common in temperate and boreal zones of the Northern Hemisphere but they can also be found in other settings including both temperate rainforests and tropical areas.

In South America Podzols occur beneath &quot;Nothofagus betuloides&quot; forests in Tierra del Fuego.

== Podzolization ==

Podzolization (or Podsolization) is a complex soil formation process by which dissolved organic matter and ions of iron and aluminium, released through weathering of various minerals, form organo-mineral complexes (chelates) and are moved from the upper parts of the soil profile and deposit in the deeper parts of soil. Through this process, the eluvial horizon becomes bleached and of ash-grey colour. The complexes move with percolating water further down to illuviated horizons which are commonly coloured brown, red or black as they accumulate and consist of cemented sesquioxides and/or organic compounds. The podzolization is a typical soil formation process in Podzols.

=== Preconditions ===
Podzolization usually occurs under forest or heath vegetation and is common in cool and humid climates as these climates inhibit the activity of soil microbes in the topsoil. Overall, podzolization happens where the decomposition of organic matter is inhibited and as a result, acidic organic surface (mor) layers build up. Under these typically acidic conditions, nutrient deficiency further hampers the microbial degradation of organic complexing agents. Medium to coarse textured soils with base-poor parent material (usually rich in quartz) also promote podzolization, as they encourage percolating water flow.

=== Key steps ===
The soil-forming process of podzolization can be broken down into two main steps:

# Mobilization and translocation of organic matter, Fe and Al from the surface horizon, and
# Immobilization and stabilization of organic matter, Fe and Al into the subsoil.

In the topsoil of acidic soils, organic matter (mostly from plant litter, the humus layer and root exudates) together with Al- and Fe-ions, form organo-mineral complexes. These soluble chelates then relocate with percolating water from the A (or E horizon) to the B horizon. As a result of this, the E horizon (or Ae horizon in the Canadian system of soil classification) is left bleached and ash-grey in colour, while the B horizon becomes enriched with relocated organo-mineral complexes. The colour of B horizon is consequently red, brown or black, depending on the dominance of metal ions or organic matter. Usually, the boundary between the B and eluvial Ae (or E) horizon is very distinct, and sometimes a hardpan (or Ortstein) can form, as the relocated Fe and Al and organic matter increase mineral particles, cementing them into this compacted layer.

There are several reasons why these organo-mineral complexes immobilize in the B horizon: If during the eluviation process more Al- or Fe-ions bind to the organic compounds, the complex can flocculate as the solubility of it decreases with increasing metal to carbon ratio. Apart from that, a higher pH (or higher Ca content) in the lower soil horizons can result in the breakdown of metal-humus complexes. In the lower soil layers, the organic complexing agents can be degraded by functioning microorganisms. Already established complexes in the B horizon can act as a filter, as they adsorb the traveling complexes from the upper soil horizons. A decreased water conductivity due to higher clay content can also result in the early flocculation of organo-mineral complexes.

The relocated substances can sometimes separate in the illuvial horizons. Then, organic substances are mostly enriched in the uppermost part of the illuvial horizon, whereas Fe- and Al-oxides are mostly found in the lower parts of the illuvial horizon.

Podzolization also promotes the relocation of some nutrients (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and P) that sometimes brings them closer to plant roots.

== In different soil classification systems ==
The definitions in different soil classification systems are quite different. Especially soils that show pronounced other soil-forming processes in addition to podzolization are handled in different ways. The following correlations refer to soils, which have undergone advanced podzolization but lack prominent other soil-forming processes.

The term Podzols is used in the &quot;World Reference Base for Soil Resources&quot; (WRB) and in many national soil classification systems (in some of them, spelled Podsols).

* The &quot;USDA soil taxonomy&quot; and the &quot;Chinese soil taxonomy&quot; call these soils Spodosols.
* The &quot;Canadian system of soil classification&quot; matches Podzols with soils under the Podzolic order (e.g. Humo-Ferric Podzol).
* The &quot;Australian Soil Classification&quot; uses the term Podosols.
* The &quot;Brazilian Soil Classification System&quot; calls them Espodossolos.

<text>Yohkoh (, &#x27;Sunbeam&#x27;), known before launch as Solar-A, was a Solar observatory spacecraft of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (Japan), in collaboration with space agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom. It was launched into Earth orbit on August 30, 1991 by the M-3SII rocket from Kagoshima Space Center. It took its first soft X-ray image on 13 September 1991, 21:53:40, and movie representations of the X-ray corona over 1991-2001 are available at the Yohkoh Legacy site.

==Description==
The satellite was three-axis stabilized and in a near-circular orbit. It carried four instruments: a Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT), a Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT), a Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS), and a Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS). About 50 MB were generated each day and stored on board by a 10.5 MB bubble memory recorder.

Because SXT utilized a charge-coupled device (CCD) as its readout device, perhaps being the first X-ray astronomical telescope to do so, its &quot;data cube&quot; of images was both extensive and convenient, and it revealed much interesting detail about the behavior of the solar corona. 
Previous solar soft X-ray observations, such as those of Skylab, had been restricted to film as a readout device. 
Yohkoh therefore returned many novel scientific results, especially regarding solar flares and other forms of magnetic activity.

The mission ended after more than ten years of successful observation when it went into its &quot;safehold&quot; mode during an annular eclipse on 14 December 2001, 20:58:33 and the spacecraft lost lock on the Sun. Operational mistakes and other flaws combined in such a way that its solar panels could no longer charge the batteries, which drained irreversibly; several other solar eclipses had successfully been observed.

On 12 September 2005, the spacecraft burned up during reentry over South Asia. The time of reentry, as provided by the U.S. Space Surveillance Network, was 6:16 pm Japan Standard Time (JST).

==Instruments==
&quot;Yohkoh&quot; carried four instruments :
* The Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) was an X-ray telescope with glancing incidence X-ray mirror and a CCD sensor. There was also a co-aligned optical telescope using the same CCD, but after the failure of the entrance filter in November 1992 it became unusable.

The CCD was 1024×1024 pixels with pixel angular size of 2.45″×2.45″, a point-spread function (core width FWHM) of about 1.5 pixels (i.e. 3.7″), a field of view of 42′×42′, which was a little larger than the whole solar disk. Typical time resolution was 2 s in flare mode and 8 s in quiet (no flare) mode, the maximum time resolution in 0.5 s.

For spectral discrimination, SXT employed wide-band filters installed on a filter wheel. There were five usable filter positions: 1265 Å-thick Al filter (2.5 Å–36 Å pass band), Al/Mg/Mn filter (2.4 Å–32 Å), 2.52 μm Mg filter (2.4 Å–23 Å), 11.6 μm Al filter (2.4 Å–13 Å), 119 μm Be filter (2.3 Å–10 Å). Before the entrance filter failure in November 1992 three more filter positions were available: no analysis filter (2.5 Å–46 Å), Wide band optical filter (4600 Å–4800 Å), Narrow band optical filter (4290 Å–4320 Å).
* The Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT) was a Fourier-synthesis X-ray imager with 64 bigrid collimators sparsely sampling the (u,v) plane and feeding individual scintillation-counter detectors. HXT was sensitive to photons with energies from 14 keV to 93 keV, this range was divided into four energy bands (called L, M1, M2, H). The angular resolution was about 5″, image synthesis field of view is 2′×2′, maximum time resolution was 0.5 s.
* Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS) was two bent crystal spectrometers sensitive in four spectral lines: the line of ion Fe XXVI (1.76 Å–1.81 Å), ion Fe XXV (1.83 Å–1.90 Å), ion Ca XIX (3.16 Å–3.19 Å), and ion S XV (5.02 Å–5.11 Å). Spectral resolution varied in the range of λ/Δλ=3000–8000, typical time resolution in flare mode was 8 s, maximum is 0.125 s. BCS integrates radiation over the whole solar disc.
* Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS) had spectroscopic capabilities in a wide energy band from 3 keV to 100 MeV. WBS was a set of four subinstruments, eаch of them outputs Pulse Count (PC) corresponding to intensity integrated over a band, and Pulse Height (PH) profile which corresponded to spectrum. Time resolution for PC (0.125 s–4 s for different subinstruments and modes) was 8–16 times better than for PH (1 s–32 s). WBS integrated radiation over the whole Sun and did not resolve source position.
** Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) consisted of two proportional gas counters with nominal energy band 5 keV–40 keV, which was divided into two PC channels and 128 PH channels. It was found after the launch that PH to energy relationship was distorted. No energy calibration for WBS PH data was available in 1999.
** Hard X-ray Spectrometer (HXS) was a NaI(Tl) scintillator. The energy band after June 1992 was 24 keV–830 keV. It was divided into 2 PC channels and 32 PH channels.
** Gamma-ray Spectrometer (GRS) consisted of two identical bismuth germanate oxide scintillators. It covered energy range 0.3 MeV–100 MeV, which was divided into 6 PC channels and 128+16 PH channels.
** Radiation Belt Monitor (RBM) unlike the other three was not aimed at solar flare observations and served to sound the alarm for radiation belt passage.

<doc id="1265234" wikidata="Q3001120" url="?curid=1265234" title="Supreme Court of New Jersey">
<text>The Supreme Court of New Jersey is the highest court in the U.S. state of New Jersey. In its current form, the Supreme Court of New Jersey is the final judicial authority on all cases in the state court system, including cases challenging the validity of state laws under the state constitution. It has the sole authority to prescribe and amend court rules and regulate the practice of law, and it is the arbiter and overseer of the decennial legislative redistricting. One of its former members, William J. Brennan Jr., became an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

It has existed in three different forms under the three different state constitutions since the independence of the state in 1776. As currently constituted, the court replaced the prior New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals, which had been the highest court created under the Constitution of 1844. Now, the Supreme Court hears appeals from the Appellate Division and, on rare occasions, other cases from within the judicial and administrative system directly, by order of the Court.

==Previous compositions==
Until the Constitution of 1947, the Supreme Court was an intermediate court. Under the two previous New Jersey state constitutions (1776 and 1844), the phrase &quot;Supreme Court&quot; referred to a lower court, similar to the New York Supreme Court. Both the &quot;supreme court&quot; and the actual highest court were composed in a radically different manner from that of the current supreme court or its inferior courts.

===Under the 1776 constitution===
Under the colonial constitution of 1776, the upper house of the legislature (which was styled the Legislative Council) along with the governor was to be &quot;the Court of Appeals&quot;, defined as the court of last resort, similar to the Law Lords of Great Britain. A separate &quot;Supreme Court&quot; was also mentioned, but no indication of its duties was given, only term limits of its judges (seven years). As time progressed and political philosophies changed, people took issue with numerous parts of the original constitution: It was hastily thrown together, used property qualifications for enfranchisement, contained scant guarantees of freedoms, was unamendable, and freely intermingled the three branches of government.

==Jurisdiction==

Under the current (1947 and amended) constitution, the highest court in the state is the Supreme Court. It does not have original jurisdiction; instead, it hears appeals, oversees the state&#x27;s court system, and regulates the legal profession within the state.

Normally, an appeal from one of the trial divisions of the New Jersey Superior Court goes to the Appellate Division of that court. Thereafter, it may be brought before the Supreme Court if a statute provides that the case may go to that court, or if it meets one or more of the following five requirements:
*as of right if the case involves a question of constitutionality;
*as of right if an Appellate Division judge dissented from that court&#x27;s ruling;
*formerly, as of right if the case involved capital punishment (now abolished in New Jersey);
*at the Supreme Court&#x27;s discretion, when the Supreme Court grants certification; or 
*by operation of law if the case involves the drawing of political boundaries (see below).

===Political functions===
The court serves as a de facto tie-breaker in case the twelve-member New Jersey Redistricting Commission fails to come to an agreement on who the 13th independent tie-breaking member will be, following the decennial United States Census. If the commission reports (&quot;certifies&quot;) to the court that it is evenly divided, the commission may nominate two people to become an independent 13th member. The court appoints the one deemed &quot;more qualified,&quot; who will then break the tie.

If the Commission still cannot reach a 7–6 majority in favor of a final redistricting configuration, the two district plans receiving the greatest number of votes, but not fewer than five votes, are submitted to the Supreme Court, which selects and certifies whichever of the two plans so submitted conforms most closely to the requirements of the Constitution and laws of the United States.

In the case of the Apportionment Commission for state legislative districts, the Chief Justice alone gets to pick the final 11th member of the commission. The court also acts as final arbiter of the inability or absence of the Governor or Lieutenant Governor, following a declaration by the Legislature. As in federal impeachment trials, in case of impeachment of the Governor, the Chief Justice presides.

== Membership ==
===Appointment, composition, and life on the bench===
The Governor nominates all justices to the Court but may choose only from among those lawyers admitted to the New Jersey bar for at least ten years. Following seven days of public notice, nominees are put before the Senate for &quot;advice and consent&quot;. Once appointed after State Senate confirmation, justices (and all state judges in New Jersey) serve for an initial term of seven years. After their initial term, the Governor may choose to nominate them for tenure, sending the nomination for tenure to the State Senate, which must again decide whether or not to grant advice and consent. Judges confirmed to a tenured position on the Court serve until they die, resign, retire or are retired, are impeached and removed, or reach the age of 70, at which point they are automatically retired. The Court consists of seven justices, one of whom serves as the chief justice. The chief justice may select judges from the Superior Court, senior in service, to serve temporarily on the Supreme Court when he determines it necessary to fill a vacancy.

The salary of the chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court is $192,795, while the salary of each associate justice is $185,482. Once in office, the salary of judges may not be decreased. While sitting on the bench, judges are not permitted to practice law or earn money from any other source.

A majority of the General Assembly may pass articles of impeachment against a justice, which the Senate will then try. Only a two-thirds majority will convict, and the Senate may punish a convicted justice with only removal from office and prohibition on holding future office. After a justice has been impeached by the General Assembly—but before the Senate renders a verdict on the charges—the justice may not exercise any official function. By virtue of accepting a position in the Executive or Legislative branches of government or becoming a candidate for political office, a justice is considered as resigned from the bench.

Should a justice or judge become &quot;incapacitated&quot; to the point at which they can no longer continue in office, the Court as a whole may notify the governor. The governor then appoints a three-member commission and, depending on their decision, may force them to retire.

===Current membership===


==Important cases==

===Constitutional law===

The principle of judicial review in New Jersey was the result of then Chief Justice David Brearley&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Holmes v. Walton&quot; (argued 1779, decided 1780). While the case was decided against the plaintiff, the court&#x27;s consideration of the matter asserted its ability to determine constitutionality. This was followed by the federal Supreme Court&#x27;s case of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;.

In &quot;State v. Post&quot; and &quot;State v. Van Beuren&quot; 20 N.J.L. 368, decided together, the constitutionality of slavery in the state was challenged on the grounds that the first article of the first section of the newly passed (1844) state constitution (&quot;All men are by nature free and independent...&quot;) precluded it. The court by two to one (with one absence), rejected this stating that &quot;the constitution has not ... abolished slavery.&quot; Slavery was abolished nationwide by the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.

===Individual rights===
The Court has delivered many cases concerning the rights of individuals, in many cases reading them expansively:

In its 1966 decision in &quot;Clover Hill Swimming Club, Inc. v. Robert F. Goldsboro and Division on Civil Rights&quot; (47 N.J. 25; 219 A.2d 161; 1966 N.J. LEXIS 180), the court ruled against the club, which had denied membership to an African-American. The club claimed that as a private organization it could choose its own membership although it had placed advertisements in local newspapers and magazines.

In &quot;State ex rel. T. L. O.&quot;, 463 A. 2d 934 (1983) the court decided, against two lower courts, that a search of a student&#x27;s purse without a warrant was unreasonable. This was appealed as &quot;New Jersey v. T. L. O.&quot; 469 U.S. 325 (1985), wherein the United States Supreme Court ruled that students and minors have a lower expectation of privacy, saying in its noted ruling that &quot;school officials need not obtain a warrant before searching a student who is under their authority.&quot;

&quot;In re Quinlan&quot; 355 A.2d 647 concerned the right to die of Karen Ann Quinlan, who was in a persistent vegetative state following prolonged respiratory failure. Her parents (and legal guardians) requested to have her ventilator removed, which the officials at the hospital refused to do. The court ultimately ruled in her parents&#x27; favor. She continued to live without artificial respiration for several years afterwards.

In 1988, the Court ruled in &quot;In re Baby M&quot; (537 A.2d 1227, 109 N.J. 396) that the surrogate mother of Baby M, despite previous rulings denying her custody, was entitled to visitation rights.

In &quot;Desilets v. Clearview Regional Board of Education&quot; (647 A.2d. 150, 137 N.J. 585 (1994)), the Court ruled that Clearview did not violate students&#x27; free speech rights under the First Amendment or the New Jersey State Constitution.

&quot;Dale v. Boy Scouts of America&quot; (&quot;160 N.J. 562&quot; (1999)) concerned the right of the Boy Scouts of America organization to expel a member for declaring himself to be homosexual. James Dale, the plaintiff, was a member of the organization for some years before he made his orientation public. Upon discovering this, the district BSA council revoked his membership. Dale sued for violating the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, which the court unanimously agreed applied to the BSA. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed in &quot;Boy Scouts of America v. Dale&quot;, 530 U.S. 640 (2000), a 5–4 decision. &quot;Apprendi v. New Jersey&quot;, a later ruling, was also overruled.

In a 4–2 vote in 2000, the court struck down a law signed by Governor Christine Whitman requiring parental notification when abortions were performed on minor children. The court held that the privacy rights of the minors were paramount and were guaranteed by New Jersey&#x27;s state constitution.

The court&#x27;s 2006 decision in &quot;Caballero v. Martinez&quot; concerned an illegal immigrant, Victor Manuel Caballero, who was injured during an accident while riding in an uninsured vehicle driven by an unlicensed person. The Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund, set up to cover injuries by uninsured drivers, refused to compensate him as he was not a legal resident. The Court on hearing his case overruled two lower courts and declared Caballero to be entitled to compensation from the fund, stating that &quot;a person may be a &#x27;resident&#x27; even if the intent to remain ultimately is not realized&quot;. Previously an individual who had lived five months with relatives was not a resident with respect to the Fund.

In 2006, the Court decided in &quot;Lewis v. Harris&quot; that the legislature must change state law, within 180 days, to afford equal protection to same-sex couples, via marriage, or an identical substitute, such as civil unions. The New Jersey Legislature responded by enacting civil unions. This case was the basis for a New Jersey Superior Court ruling that led to the legalization of same-sex marriage in New Jersey in &quot;Garden State Equality v. Dow&quot;.

In 2020, the Court decided in &quot;State of New Jersey v. Andrews&quot;, by a 4–3 vote, that a court order compelling a defendant to provide the passwords to his cell phones to the police did not violate either federal or state protections against compelled disclosure of potentially self-incriminating information. This ruling contributed to a growing split in how federal and state courts have addressed the issue of compelled decryption, with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reaching similar decisions and state supreme courts in Indiana and Pennsylvania deciding the opposite.

===Social and political cases===
In &quot;State v. Driver&quot; (1962), the Court held that a sound recording of an interrogation of a defendant can only be admitted into evidence if it is competent and relevant. The Court introduced a five-factor test to assess whether a recorded interrogation is admissible.

In &quot;Abbott v. Burke&quot; (1981), or &quot;Abbott I&quot;, which was filed on behalf of students of the most depressed school districts, the Court decided that a single test must be applied statewide to determine if students were getting the constitutionally mandated education. Also, the &quot;Abbott&quot; districts are given state aid to match the operating budget of the richer districts. Since then there have been seven &quot;&quot;Abbott&quot; cases&quot;, many of which ended with the court finding the New Jersey Legislature&#x27;s latest educational acts unconstitutional.

In 1975 and 1983, two cases, both named &quot;Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Township&quot;, were decided by the Court. The Constitution was interpreted to require that zoning authorities institute inclusionary zoning of their land to create affordable housing, that the districts had to equally take on the required load of housing, and that &quot;ex&quot;clusionary zoning was illegal. These requirements are now commonly referred to as the &quot;Mount Laurel&quot; Doctrine.

&quot;State v. Kelly&quot;, 91 N.J. 178 (1984), is a Supreme Court case where the defendant, Gladys Kelly, was on trial for allegedly murdering her husband, Ernest Kelly, with a pair of scissors. The Supreme Court reversed the case for further trial after finding that expert testimony regarding the defense&#x27;s submission that Kelly suffered from battered woman syndrome was incorrectly excluded, as the syndrome was a proper subject for expert evidence despite being a new field.

In &quot;Democratic Party v. Samson,&quot; 814 A.2d 1028 (2002), the Court allowed the state Democratic Party to change their candidate for the upcoming federal Senate race from Robert Torricelli to Frank Lautenberg despite the deadline having passed. In its opinion it cited previous cases before the Court, including one stating &quot;Election laws are to be liberally construed&quot;, to decide that the change was in the interest of the electorate.

<text>Nicholas Perricone is an American dermatologist and author. His self-help books about weight loss and maintaining the appearance of youth have been criticized for making controversial and unsupported claims. 

Perricone earned his medical degree from Michigan State University College of Human Medicine. He opposes the use of Botox. He argues that exercise, an anti-inflammatory diet plus dietary supplements, superfoods, and topical products can help fight aging and its effects on appearance. His company, N.V. Perricone, M.D. Ltd., sells branded products described in his books.

== Criticisms ==
According to PEERtrainer, his critics &quot;accuse him of making crazy promises in order to sell product. His claims, it is argued, are backed by very little scientific research, and any research he has done himself has never been published in medical journals, where it would be subject to scrupulous review.&quot;

Harriet Hall and Stephen Barrett have written that Perricone&#x27;s writings &quot;contain many claims that are questionable, controversial, fanciful, unsupported by published evidence, or just plain wrong.&quot;

<doc id="1265240" wikidata="Q825582" url="?curid=1265240" title="2003 Lower Saxony state election">
<text>The 2003 Lower Saxony state election was held on 2 February 2003 to elect the members of the 15th Landtag of Lower Saxony. The incumbent Social Democratic Party (SPD) majority government led by Minister-President Sigmar Gabriel was defeated. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) came up one seat short of a majority, and formed a coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FDP). CDU leader Christian Wulff was subsequently elected minister-president.

==Background==
The election in Lower Saxony had larger significance than just in the state itself. Defeat for the Social Democrats in the election would mean they lost their slim majority in the upper house of the German parliament, the Bundesrat. It was thought this might cause the collapse of Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s national coalition government between the Social Democrats and the Green Party.

==Campaign and issues==
The economy was seen as the most important issue in the election, with the Social Democrats suffering as a result.

Opinion polls in December 2002 showed the Christian Democrats in the lead with 43% as against 34% for the Social Democrats.

==Parties==
The table below lists parties represented in the 14th Landtag of Lower Saxony.

He transferred to Hamburger SV in August 1992, where he became a regular in the first team and scored his first league goal in Germany&#x27;s top flight. Returning to Bayern Munich in 1994, Babbel made 167 starts and caught the attention of Manchester United following UEFA Euro 1996. Although a £5 million deal was arranged for the German full-back, it ultimately fell through. In June 2000, Liverpool F.C. manager Gérard Houllier signed Babbel on a Bosman transfer. He became a key member of Liverpool&#x27;s back four during their triumphant 2000–01 season.

====Liverpool====
Babbel was a key figure in Liverpool&#x27;s lineup, known for his trademark surging runs down the right flank, which contributed to several goals, including one in the UEFA Cup final. However, his Liverpool career came to an abrupt halt when he was diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome, sidelining him for an entire year.

====Blackburn Rovers====
He joined Blackburn Rovers on loan in August 2003 after recovering from Guillain–Barré syndrome, making regular first-team appearances in the league and scoring three goals.

====VfB Stuttgart====

Babbel&#x27;s final club was VfB Stuttgart, which he joined on a free transfer in July 2004.
In January 2007, Babbel announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2006–07 season.

==== Germany National Team ====
He was capped 51 times and scored one goal for the Germany and was part of the Euro 96 winning team. Babbel also represented his country at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2000.

==Coaching career==
===2007–12: Early career===

Following his retirement from football, Babbel remained with his last club, VfB Stuttgart, as an assistant manager.

On 24 November 2008, Babbel became head coach of VfB Stuttgart. At the time of Babbel&#x27;s appointment, VfB Stuttgart were 11th in the table after 14 games. Babbel&#x27;s first match was a 1–1 draw against Sampdoria on 27 November 2008. Under his leadership, the team finished the season in third place, five points behind league winners VfL Wolfsburg, and qualified for the Champions League. On 6 May 2009, Babbel signed a contract extension with VfB Stuttgart until the summer of 2011. However, on 6 December 2009, VfB Stuttgart and Babbel parted ways. His final match was a 1–1 draw against VfL Bochum on 5 December 2009. At the time of his dismissal, VfB Stuttgart were in 16th place after 15 games played. Babbel&#x27;s record at Stuttgart stood at 21 wins, 15 draws, and 14 losses. Under Babbel, VfB Stuttgart finished second in their Champions League group and qualified for the round of 16.

Babbel took over as head coach of Hertha BSC in July 2010, guiding the team in the 2nd division. His first match was a 2–0 win in the German Cup. Babbel successfully led Hertha BSC to promotion back to the Bundesliga by winning the 2. Bundesliga during the 2010–11 season. However, on 18 December 2011, Babbel was dismissed as coach of Hertha BSC. Prior to his dismissal, Babbel had expressed his intention to leave the club at the end of the season. His last match was a 1–1 draw against TSG Hoffenheim on 17 December 2011. At the time of his departure, Hertha BSC were in 11th place in the league. Babbel&#x27;s tenure at Hertha BSC concluded with a record of 30 wins, 13 draws, and 12 losses.

On 10 February 2012, Babbel was appointed manager of TSG Hoffenheim. At the time, 1899 Hoffenheim was in eighth place. His first match ended in a 1–1 draw against Werder Bremen. 1899 Hoffenheim completed the season in 11th place. On 3 December 2012, Babbel was dismissed due to poor results, with the team in 16th place in the Bundesliga. Babbel&#x27;s final match was a 4–1 loss to Werder Bremen. His tenure concluded with a record of seven wins, eight draws, and 15 losses.

===2014–2018: FC Luzern===
Babbel became the new head coach of Luzern on 12 October 2014, following the dismissal of Carlos Bernegger who had failed to win a single league game during the 2014–15 season. Babbel&#x27;s first match was a 0–0 draw against Vaduz on 19 October 2014. Luzern finished the 2014–15 season in fifth place.

The 2015–16 season began with a 2–2 draw against Sion on 18 July 2015. During the 2015–16 season, Luzern reached the semi-final of the Swiss Cup and finished third in the league.

The 2016–17 season began with six matches between 23 July 2016 and 7 August 2016. Luzern won the opening match of the season 2–1 against Lugano on 23 July 2016.

===2018: Western Sydney Wanderers===
On 19 May 2018, Babbel was appointed manager of Western Sydney Wanderers FC in the A-League. The 2018–19 A-League season saw the Wanderers finish eighth out of ten teams, winning only six games, drawing six, and losing 15. In the 2019–20 season, after a promising start that included a 1–0 victory over Sydney FC in the first Sydney Derby at the new Western Sydney Stadium, the team experienced a dramatic collapse, securing only 1 win and 2 draws in the next 11 matches, dropping from first place after 3 rounds to 9th place (out of 11) after 14 games. Babbel was dismissed by the Wanderers on Monday, 20 January 2020, with his assistant coach appointed as interim replacement.

<doc id="1265251" wikidata="Q1804139" url="?curid=1265251" title="2000 North Rhine-Westphalia state election">
<text>The 2000 North Rhine-Westphalia state election was held on 14 May 2000 to elect the 13th Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia. The outgoing government was a coalition of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and The Greens led by Minister-President Wolfgang Clement.

The SPD remained the largest party but declined to 42.8%, its worst result since 1958. However, the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU) failed to capitalise, falling slightly to 37%. The Free Democratic Party (FDP) returned to the Landtag in third place with 10%, while the Greens took losses and recorded 7%. Overall, the incumbent government retained a reduced majority. Minister-President Clement met with FDP lead candidate Jürgen Möllemann post-election, but the SPD settled on renewing the coalition with the Greens. Clement was re-elected by the Landtag on 21 June.

==Electoral system==
The Landtag was elected via mixed-member proportional representation. 151 members were elected in single-member constituencies via first-past-the-post voting, and fifty then allocated using compensatory proportional representation. A single ballot was used for both. The minimum size of the Landtag was 201 members, but if overhang seats were present, proportional leveling seats were added to ensure proportionality. An electoral threshold of 5% of valid votes is applied to the Landtag; parties that fall below this threshold are ineligible to receive seats.

==Background==

In the previous election held on 14 May 1995, the SPD lost their Landtag majority for the first time since 1980. The CDU recorded another poor performance with under 38% of the vote, while the FDP fell to 4% and lost their seats. The Greens achieved a significant victory with 10% and held balance of power in the Landtag, subsequently forming a coalition government with the SPD.

In May 1998, long-serving Minister-President Johannes Rau resigned. He was succeeded by state economics minister Wolfgang Clement, who continued the coalition with the Greens.

==Parties==
The table below lists parties represented in the 12th Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia.
==Campaign==
Minister-President Clement stated he hoped for the SPD to regain its parliamentary majority, but that he could also accept a coalition with either the Greens or the FDP. The CDU under lead candidate Jürgen Rüttgers aimed to win government, in coalition with the FDP if necessary. The Greens campaigned for a continuation of the outgoing coalition, and capitalised on the SPD&#x27;s ambivalence toward coalition partners with the slogan: &quot;If you want red-green, you have to vote Green.&quot; The FDP ran with former Vice-Chancellor Jürgen Möllemann as their lead candidate, and sought to re-enter the Landtag and surpass the Greens for third place.

The CDU were dragged down by the ongoing donations scandal which began at the end of the previous year; their popularity in state polling fell from a high of 46% in December to just 32% in March.

<doc id="1265253" wikidata="Q6384761" url="?curid=1265253" title="Keith Miles">
<text>Keith Miles (born 1940) is a Welsh writer of historical fiction and mystery novels. He has also written children&#x27;s books, radio and television dramas and stage plays. He is best known under the pseudonym Edward Marston, and has also written as Martin Inigo and Conrad Allen.

==Career==
Miles was born and educated in South Wales. He gained a degree in Modern History from Oxford University and spent three years as a lecturer, before becoming a full-time writer. Miles&#x27;s early work was as a scriptwriter for television and radio, including series such as &quot;Crossroads&quot;, &quot;Z-Cars&quot; and &quot;The Archers&quot;. Miles was chairman of the Crime Writers&#x27; Association for 1997–98. He was previously married to Rosalind Miles and is now married to another mystery writer, Judith Cutler.

===Mystery fiction written as Keith Miles===
Beginning in the mid-1980s, Miles turned to writing mystery fiction. His first series, written under his own name, featured Alan Saxon, a professional golfer-turned-amateur detective. After four books, Miles&#x27;s publisher did not wish to continue the series, which only resumed after a hiatus of more than a decade. He has written two mysteries set in the United States which feature a Welsh architect, Merlin Richards.

The Action Scene series included five books, from &quot;Skydive&quot; to &quot;Frontier&quot;; as Miles, he also wrote &quot;Not for Glory, Not for Gold&quot;, a novel about athletics.

The City Hospital series included ten books, starting with &quot;New Blood&quot; (1995) and ending with &quot;Heart Rate&quot; (1996). In 2019, Amazon in the U.S. was giving away the individual e-books of this series at no charge to Kindle Unlimited members.

===Edward Marston===
In 1988, Miles began a series set in the theatrical world of Elizabethan London. For this series, and for most of his subsequent writing, he adopted the pseudonym Edward Marston, the name reflecting that of a real Elizabethan playwright, John Marston. The series features a fictional theatrical company, Westfield&#x27;s Men, and, in particular, Nicholas Bracewell, its book-holder, a position similar to that of the modern stage manager. His next series as Marston was set during the reign of William the Conqueror; its two main characters, surveyors for Domesday Book, are Ralph Delchard, a Norman soldier, and Gervase Bret, a former novice turned lawyer, who is half Saxon and half Breton.

Marston began his Restoration series in 1999 featuring architect/detective Christopher Redmayne and the puritan Constable Jonathan Bale. Six books were written in this series, with the last one, &quot;The Painted Lady&quot;, released in 2007. In the &quot;Captain Rawson&quot; series, Marston has written about a soldier and spy operating during the military campaigns of the Duke of Marlborough.

In recent years, he began the &quot;Home Front Detective Series&quot;, set in London during the First World War; seven had been published as of 2019. His &quot;Bow Street Rivals&quot; series, set in London during the Napoleonic Wars, includes five books as of 2020.

Marston has been most prolific in his &quot;Railway Detective&quot; series, published by Allison &amp; Busby. This is set in the middle of the 19th century against the background of the &quot;Railway Age&quot;. It concerns two Scotland Yard detectives, Inspector Robert Colbeck and Sergeant Victor Leeming, whose cases are invariably linked to the railways. Colbeck is a former barrister who is enthralled by the railways and marries a railwayman&#x27;s daughter. Leeming, in contrast, detests travelling by train and yearns for the days of horse-drawn transport. Beginning with &quot;The Railway Detective&quot; itself in 2004, there were 20 titles in this series to the end of 2021.

<doc id="1265261" wikidata="Q1317609" url="?curid=1265261" title="Ice hotel">
<text>An ice hotel is a temporary hotel made up of snow and sculpted blocks of ice. Ice hotels, dependent on sub-freezing temperatures, are constructed from ice and snow and typically have to be rebuilt every year. Ice hotels exist in several countries, and they have varying construction styles, services and amenities, the latter of which may include ice bars, restaurants, chapels, saunas and hot tubs.

==Overview==
Ice hotels are promoted for adventurous travelers who are interested in novelties and unusual environments and are comfortable with the outdoors. Customers have to be prepared to sleep in beds made of snow or ice, but in the warmth of furs, blankets and sleeping bags designed to withstand extremely cold temperatures. Temperature in the rooms is below zero Celsius, but much warmer than outside. Staying at an ice hotel is expensive as prices for a night range from around US$300 to $3,000. Some ice hotels may be destination hotels.

Lobbies are often filled with ice sculptures, and food and drinks are specially chosen for the circumstances. For instance, glasses in an ice bar can be made of ice and people sit on benches made of ice. An ice bar, sometimes associated with an ice hotel, is a drinking establishment primarily made of ice.

==Construction==
Ice hotels are dependent upon sub-freezing temperatures (colder than 0 °C or 32 °F) during construction and operation. This imposes time constraints on construction and makes the hotel&#x27;s season short. Construction typically begins between November and March when snow can be compacted and thick levels of ice form. Although constructing an ice hotel is more labor-intensive than a regular building, building materials are cheaper. Ice hotels have to be reconstructed every year. This is not entirely detrimental to the operators; if an ice hotel does not meet its financial goals, the owner can simply let the building melt in the spring and is left with no building to permanently upkeep.

The walls, fixtures, and fittings are made entirely of ice or compacted snow, and are held together using a substance known as snice, which takes the place of mortar in a traditional brick-built hotel. Sometimes steel framing is used in their construction.

==By country==
===Canada===
====Ice Hotel====
The Hôtel de Glace () first opened in January 2001. 85 rooms are furnished with ice beds covered with deer furs and mattresses and equipped with arctic sleeping bags. It was originally located on the shores of Lac-Saint-Joseph, Quebec, 31 minutes north of Quebec City, but has since moved closer to the city, 10 minutes away from Old Town Quebec. It operates from the first week in January to the last week in March. It has the adjacent Le Quatre Temps restaurant, an ice bar named Absolut Ice Bar, which serves Absolut Vodka and other beverages, sauna and outdoor hot tub. Construction involves the use of blocks of ice and snow. In 2005, construction involved &quot;400 tons of clear ice blocks, trucked in from Montreal, and 12,000 tons of snow produced on site.&quot; Beds are constructed of ice, which are topped with &quot;a wooden boxspring and mattress&quot;, and mummy-style sleeping bags are provided. The hotel offers paid tours, the participants of which are allowed to use the ice bar until midnight. Ice Hotel was previously the only ice hotel in North America.

====Snow Village====
Snow Village is a half-hectare village and 30-room ice hotel located in Parc Jean-Drapeau, east of Montreal, in Quebec, Canada that first opened in 2012. It has suites, standard rooms and igloos, an ice restaurant, ice bar and patio, ice chapel and outdoor hot tubs. It is constructed from man-made snow created by snowmaking machines, which is blown onto frames that are removed when construction is complete. This is performed because the density of the artificial snow is greater than that of natural snow. The hotel is equipped with fire alarms that are built into snow walls, as required by the city of Montreal. Initial construction cost $2.1 million, and the Quebec government provided some financial support for its construction.

===Finland===
====SnowCastle of Kemi====
The SnowCastle of Kemi in Kemi, Finland is the largest snow fort in the world, is rebuilt every winter and has a snow hotel with double rooms and a honeymoon suite. The facility also has a restaurant, chapel, and ice sculptures. It is near the Gulf of Bothnia. The style of the facility, including the theme, shape, size and decorations, changes annually.

====Lainio Snow Village====
The Lainio Snow Village is located 150 km north of the Arctic Circle in Lapland. This snow hotel is built in the winter atop a wood building. In 2007, construction began in November, and in December, it began providing lodging. The hotel has restrooms and a sauna, and the village has a restaurant. Rooms are decorated with artwork created from snow. In 2007, art students contributed to the art with professional artists. In the summer, the village provides log cabin lodging.

===Japan===
The Alpha Resort Tomamu in the Shimukappu village of Hokkaido Island in Japan builds and opens an ice hotel every year. It may be Japan&#x27;s first ice hotel, and everything in it is constructed from ice. The hotel interiors are typically −3 to −5 °C. Guests dine on ice tables and sit on ice chairs covered with sheepskin. The hotel provides sheepskin apparel for guests to stay warm.

===Norway===
====Ice Bar====
Ice Bar, run by Ice Hotel, is a bar located in downtown Oslo, Norway which serves drinks all year long in an artificially frozen environment.

====Ice Lodge====
The Ice Lodge in Norway is part of the Bjorligard Hotel. It is the largest ice hotel in Norway, and its season is longer than other ice hotels due to its elevation at above sea level.

====Kirkenes Snow Hotel====
The Kirkenes Snow Hotel is located in Finnmark, Norway, the easternmost and northernmost county in Norway. The hotel is 15 km from the Norwegian-Russian border and first opened in 2006. It had 20 rooms and the largest snow dome in Norway (8 metres high and 12 metres in diameter). All the rooms were individually decorated by ice artists from Finland and Japan. The west Snow Hall was decorated by local sculptor Arild Wara. A night in the snow hotel is combined with a special dinner prepared on an open fire. Visitors can get a sauna before or after staying at the hotel. The hotel has an ice bar, a reindeer park, and a husky farm.

====Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel====
Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel is located in rural Alta Municipality, about south of the town of Alta. The igloo hotel has been rebuilt yearly since 1999. It is Europe’s northernmost ice hotel, as it is in the Finnmark region and is approximately from the North Cape. The hotel has 30 rooms, including two suites. It is decorated with ice sculptures and ice furnishings, including lighting systems which enhance the different types of crystalline formations. Besides the bedrooms the hotel contains an ice chapel, ice gallery and ice bar where drinks are served in glasses made of ice. Additional facilities include a sauna and outdoor bathtubs with hot water. The ice sculptures at the hotel change yearly. The Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel in Alta has a changing theme every year. In 2004, it was a Viking theme, in 2005, Norwegian fairytales, and in 2006, the theme was wild animals of the region. To stay warm when sleeping, guests use sleeping bags that sit on top of reindeer hides.

===Romania===
Bâlea Lake Ice Hotel, the first ice hotel in Eastern Europe was built in 2006 in Romania, deep in the Făgăraș Mountains, at an elevation of 2034 meters above sea level. In winter, it is only accessible by cable car, since the national road DN7, the Transfăgărășan, is closed in the winter.

This picturesque setting is next to Bâlea Lake, where each year local craftsmen wait for the lake to freeze, before using the ice to build the small 12-room Ice Hotel and its adjacent Ice Church, Ice Restaurant and Ice Bar. Local artists imitate sculptures by Romanian modernist sculptor, Constantin Brâncuși. Typically the hotel is completed in December and is open until it melts in late March or April.

Bedding, furs, specialist sleeping bags are all provided, with bathroom facilities nearby. There are two chalets within walking distance, which also provide accommodation. Activities such as skiing, sledging or riding a snow bike are on offer. Those who are more organised and adventurous can arrange heliskiing.

The Bâlea Lake Ice Hotel is Romanian owned, but has a relationship with a travel company Untravelled Paths Limited, based in the United Kingdom.

===Sweden===
====Icehotel Jukkasjärvi====
Each year between December and April, the Icehotel in the village of Jukkasjärvi is open. It is about 17 km from Kiruna, Sweden, and it was the world&#x27;s first ice hotel. 80 rooms and suites are available. In addition to the entrance hall, the hotel has a chapel and an ice bar named Absolut Icebar. In 1989, Japanese ice artists visited the area and created an exhibition of ice art. In spring 1990, French artist Jannot Derid held an exhibition in a cylinder-shaped igloo in the area. One night there were no rooms available in the town, so some of the visitors asked for permission to spend the night in the exhibition hall. They slept in sleeping bags on top of reindeer skin.

The entire hotel is made out of snow and ice blocks taken from the Torne River; even the glasses in the bar are made of ice. Each spring, around March, Icehotel harvests ice from the frozen river and stores it in a nearby production hall with room for over 100,000 tons of ice and 30,000 tons of snow. Some of the blocks of ice weigh two tons, and cranes are used to place them. The ice is used for creating Icebar designs and ice glasses, for ice sculpting classes, events and product launches all over the world while the snow is used for building a strong structure for the building. About 1,000 tons of what is left is used in the construction of the next Icehotel.

Each year, for the past 24 years now, the ice hotel has accepted applications from artists around the world to design the world-famous hotel&#x27;s art suites. In 2013 there were more than 200 applications submitted from a wide range of artists to design and build an Art Suite. These included artists from a variety of creative backgrounds – including theatre and photography, to interior design and architecture. Around 15 applications are accepted with their designs and head there in November to build the suites.

====IGLOOTEL Lapland====

IGLOOTEL Lapland is located in Piteå, Sweden approx. 100 km south of the Arctic Circle. Every winter IGLOOTEL is being built and designed from scratch in cooperation with engineers and designers. IGLOOTEL consists of different IGLOOs, for example Sleeping-IGLOOs, Event-IGLOOs, an Ice-Bar and an Aurora Spa Area with a wood fired Outdoor Sauna and Hot Tubs. The IGLOOs are connected through hallways, which are also made of snow and ice. IGLOOTEL has an inner surface area of approx. 900 – 1.000 m2.

Engravings in the snow and ice walls, illuminations and other art varies and creates a new, individual theme each year. Design students from an Art Academy develop the theme and create unique art work in each of the IGLOOs. Natural materials, for example local woods and reindeer skins are used to establish a comfortable atmosphere. The temperature inside IGLOOTEL is constantly between 0 °C (32 °F) and -4 °C (25 °F). The beds in IGLOOTEL Lapland are built on wooden platforms with mattresses and reindeer skins. Guests sleep in polar sleeping bags.

===Switzerland===
The ski resort in the village of Gstaad, Switzerland in the Swiss Alps has an igloo village where guests can rent igloos for overnight lodging. In the igloos, sleeping areas are raised, and are &quot;layered with foam, carpet and sheep skins&quot;, atop which sleeping bags are provided. Lighting is provided by candles.

<doc id="1265269" wikidata="Q3545894" url="?curid=1265269" title="Xenobiology">
<text>Xenobiology (XB) is a subfield of synthetic biology, the study of synthesizing and manipulating biological devices and systems. The name &quot;xenobiology&quot; derives from the Greek word &quot;xenos&quot;, which means &quot;stranger, alien&quot;. Xenobiology is a form of biology that is not (yet) familiar to science and is not found in nature. In practice, it describes novel biological systems and biochemistries that differ from the canonical DNA–RNA-20 amino acid system (see central dogma of molecular biology). For example, instead of DNA or RNA, XB explores nucleic acid analogues, termed xeno nucleic acid (XNA) as information carriers. It also focuses on an expanded genetic code and the incorporation of non-proteinogenic amino acids, or “xeno amino acids” into proteins.

==Difference between xeno-, exo-, and astro-biology==
&quot;Astro&quot; means &quot;star&quot; and &quot;exo&quot; means &quot;outside&quot;. Both exo- and astrobiology deal with the search for naturally evolved life in the Universe, mostly on other planets in the circumstellar habitable zone. (These are also occasionally referred to as xenobiology.) Whereas astrobiologists are concerned with the detection and analysis of life elsewhere in the Universe, xenobiology attempts to design forms of life with a different biochemistry or different genetic code than on planet Earth.

==Aims ==
* Xenobiology has the potential to reveal fundamental knowledge about biology and the origin of life. In order to better understand the origin of life, it is necessary to know why life evolved seemingly via an early RNA world to the DNA-RNA-protein system and its nearly universal genetic code. Was it an evolutionary &quot;accident&quot; or were there constraints that ruled out other types of chemistries? By testing alternative biochemical &quot;primordial soups&quot;, it is expected to better understand the principles that gave rise to life as we know it.
* Xenobiology is an approach to develop industrial production systems with novel capabilities by means of biopolymer engineering and pathogen resistance. The genetic code encodes in all organisms 20 canonical amino acids that are used for protein biosynthesis. In rare cases, special amino acids such as selenocysteine or pyrrolysine can be incorporated by the translational apparatus in to proteins of some organisms. Together, these 20+2 Amino Acids are known as the 22 Proteinogenic Amino Acids. By using additional amino acids from among the over 700 known to biochemistry, the capabilities of proteins may be altered to give rise to more efficient catalytical or material functions. The EC-funded project Metacode, for example, aims to incorporate metathesis (a useful catalytical function so far not known in living organisms) into bacterial cells. Another reason why XB could improve production processes lies in the possibility to reduce the risk of virus or bacteriophage contamination in cultivations since XB cells would no longer provide suitable host cells, rendering them more resistant (an approach called semantic containment)
* Xenobiology offers the option to design a &quot;genetic firewall&quot;, a novel biocontainment system, which may help to strengthen and diversify current bio-containment approaches. One concern with traditional genetic engineering and biotechnology is horizontal gene transfer to the environment and possible risks to human health. One major idea in XB is to design alternative genetic codes and biochemistries so that horizontal gene transfer is no longer possible. Additionally alternative biochemistry also allows for new synthetic auxotrophies. The idea is to create an orthogonal biological system that would be incompatible with natural genetic systems.

==Scientific approach==
In xenobiology, the aim is to design and construct biological systems that differ from their natural counterparts on one or more fundamental levels. Ideally these new-to-nature organisms would be different in every possible biochemical aspect exhibiting a very different genetic code. The long-term goal is to construct a cell that would store its genetic information not in DNA but in an alternative informational polymer consisting of xeno nucleic acids (XNA), different base pairs, using non-canonical amino acids and an altered genetic code. So far cells have been constructed that incorporate only one or two of these features.

===Xeno nucleic acids (XNA)===

Originally this research on alternative forms of DNA was driven by the question of how life evolved on earth and why RNA and DNA were selected by (chemical) evolution over other possible nucleic acid structures. Two hypotheses for the selection of RNA and DNA as life&#x27;s backbone are either they are favored under life on Earth&#x27;s conditions, or they were coincidentally present in pre-life chemistry and continue to be used now. Systematic experimental studies aiming at the diversification of the chemical structure of nucleic acids have resulted in completely novel informational biopolymers. So far a number of XNAs with new chemical backbones or leaving group of the DNA have been synthesized, e.g.: hexose nucleic acid (HNA); threose nucleic acid (TNA), glycol nucleic acid (GNA) cyclohexenyl nucleic acid (CeNA). The incorporation of XNA in a plasmid, involving 3 HNA codons, has been accomplished already in 2003. This XNA is used in vivo (E coli) as template for DNA synthesis. This study, using a binary (G/T) genetic cassette and two non-DNA bases (Hx/U), was extended to CeNA, while GNA seems to be too alien at this moment for the natural biological system to be used as template for DNA synthesis. Extended bases using a natural DNA backbone could, likewise, be transliterated into natural DNA, although to a more limited extent.

Aside being used as extensions to template DNA strands, XNA activity has been tested for use as genetic catalysts. Although proteins are the most common components of cellular enzymatic activity, nucleic acids are also used in the cell to catalyze reactions. A 2015 study found several different kinds of XNA, most notably FANA (2&#x27;-fluoroarabino nucleic acids), as well as HNA, CeNA and ANA (arabino nucleic acids) could be used to cleave RNA during post-transcriptional RNA processing acting as XNA enzymes, hence the name XNAzymes. FANA XNAzymes also showed the ability to ligate DNA, RNA and XNA substrates. Although XNAzyme studies are still preliminary, this study was a step in the direction of searching for synthetic circuit components that are more efficient than those containing DNA and RNA counterparts that can regulate DNA, RNA, and their own, XNA, substrates.

===Expanding the genetic alphabet===

While XNAs have modified backbones, other experiments target the replacement or enlargement of the genetic alphabet of DNA with unnatural base pairs. For example, DNA has been designed that has – instead of the four standard bases A, T, G, and C – six bases A, T, G, C, and the two new ones P and Z (where Z stands for 6-Amino-5-nitro3-(l&#x27;-p-D-2&#x27;-deoxyribofuranosyl)-2(1H)-pyridone, and P stands for 2-Amino-8-(1-beta-D-2&#x27;-deoxyribofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-4 (8H)). In a systematic study, Leconte et al. tested the viability of 60 candidate bases (yielding potentially 3600 base pairs) for possible incorporation in the DNA.

In 2002, Hirao et al. developed an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions &quot;in vitro&quot; in transcription and translation toward a genetic code for protein synthesis containing a non-standard amino acid. In 2006, they created 7-(2-thienyl)imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (Ds) and pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde (Pa) as a third base pair for replication and transcription, and afterward, Ds and 4-[3-(6-aminohexanamido)-1-propynyl]-2-nitropyrrole (Px) was discovered as a high fidelity pair in PCR amplification. In 2013, they applied the Ds-Px pair to DNA aptamer generation by &quot;in vitro&quot; selection (SELEX) and demonstrated the genetic alphabet expansion significantly augment DNA aptamer affinities to target proteins.

In May 2014, researchers announced that they had successfully introduced two new artificial nucleotides into bacterial DNA, alongside the four naturally occurring nucleotides, and by including individual artificial nucleotides in the culture media, were able to passage the bacteria 24 times; they did not create mRNA or proteins able to use the artificial nucleotides.

===Novel polymerases===
Neither the XNA nor the unnatural bases are recognized by natural polymerases. One of the major challenges is to find or create novel types of polymerases that will be able to replicate these new-to-nature constructs. In one case a modified variant of the HIV-reverse transcriptase was found to be able to PCR-amplify an oligonucleotide containing a third type base pair.
Pinheiro et al. (2012) demonstrated that the method of polymerase evolution and design successfully led to the storage and recovery of genetic information (of less than 100bp length) from six alternative genetic polymers based on simple nucleic acid architectures not found in nature, xeno nucleic acids.

===Genetic code engineering===
One of the goals of xenobiology is to rewrite the genetic code. The most promising approach to change the code is the reassignment of seldom used or even unused codons.
In an ideal scenario, the genetic code is expanded by one codon, thus having been liberated from its old function and fully reassigned to a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) (&quot;code expansion&quot;). As these methods are laborious to implement, and some short cuts can be applied (&quot;code engineering&quot;), for example in bacteria that are auxotrophic for specific amino acids and at some point in the experiment are fed isostructural analogues instead of the canonical amino acids for which they are auxotrophic. In that situation, the canonical amino acid residues in native proteins are substituted with the ncAAs. Even the insertion of multiple different ncAAs into the same protein is possible. Finally, the repertoire of 20 canonical amino acids can not only be expanded, but also reduced to 19.
By reassigning transfer RNA (tRNA)/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs the codon specificity can be changed. Cells endowed with such aminoacyl-[tRNA synthetases] are thus able to read [mRNA] sequences that make no sense to the existing gene expression machinery. Altering the codon: tRNA synthetases pairs may lead to the in vivo incorporation of the non-canonical amino acids into proteins.
In the past reassigning codons was mainly done on a limited scale. In 2013, however, Farren Isaacs and George Church at Harvard University reported the replacement of all 321 TAG stop codons present in the genome of &quot;E. coli&quot; with synonymous TAA codons, thereby demonstrating that massive substitutions can be combined into higher-order strains without lethal effects. Following the success of this genome wide codon replacement, the authors continued and achieved the reprogramming of 13 codons throughout the genome, directly affecting 42 essential genes.

An even more radical change in the genetic code is the change of a triplet codon to a quadruplet and even quintuplet codon pioneered by Sisido in cell-free systems and by Schultz in bacteria. Finally, non-natural base pairs can be used to introduce novel amino acid in proteins.

===Directed evolution===
The goal of substituting DNA by XNA may also be reached by another route, namely by engineering the environment instead of the genetic modules. This approach has been successfully demonstrated by Marlière and Mutzel with the production of an &quot;E. coli&quot; strain whose DNA is composed of standard A, C and G nucleotides but has the synthetic thymine analogue 5-chlorouracil instead of thymine (T) in the corresponding positions of the sequence. These cells are then dependent on externally supplied 5-chlorouracil for growth, but otherwise they look and behave as normal &quot;E. coli&quot;. These cells, however, are currently not yet fully auxotrophic for the Xeno-base since they are still growing on thymine when this is supplied to the medium.

==Biosafety==
Xenobiological systems are designed to convey orthogonality to natural biological systems. A (still hypothetical) organism that uses XNA, different base pairs and polymerases and has an altered genetic code will hardly be able to interact with natural forms of life on the genetic level. Thus, these xenobiological organisms represent a genetic enclave that cannot exchange information with natural cells. Altering the genetic machinery of the cell leads to semantic containment. In analogy to information processing in IT, this safety concept is termed a “genetic firewall”. The concept of the genetic firewall seems to overcome a number of limitations of previous safety systems. A first experimental evidence of the theoretical concept of the genetic firewall was achieved in 2013 with the construction of a genomically recoded organism (GRO). In this GRO all known UAG stop codons in E.coli were replaced by UAA codons, which allowed for the deletion of release factor 1 and reassignment of UAG translation function. The GRO exhibited increased resistance to T7 bacteriophage, thus showing that alternative genetic codes do reduce genetic compatibility. This GRO, however, is still very similar to its natural “parent” and cannot be regarded to have a genetic firewall. The possibility of reassigning the function of large number of triplets opens the perspective to have strains that combine XNA, novel base pairs, new genetic codes, etc. that cannot exchange any information with the natural biological world.
Regardless of changes leading to a semantic containment mechanism in new organisms, any novel biochemical systems still has to undergo a toxicological screening. XNA, novel proteins, etc. might represent novel toxins, or have an allergic potential that needs to be assessed.

==Governance and regulatory issues==
Xenobiology might challenge the regulatory framework, as currently laws and directives deal with genetically modified organisms and do not directly mention chemically or genomically modified organisms. Taking into account that real xenobiology organisms are not expected in the next few years, policy makers do have some time at hand to prepare themselves for an upcoming governance challenge. Since 2012, the following groups have picked up the topic as a developing governance issue: policy advisers in the US, four National Biosafety Boards in Europe, the European Molecular Biology Organisation, and the European Commission&#x27;s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) in three opinions (Definition, risk assessment methodologies and safety aspects, and risks to the environment and biodiversity related to synthetic biology and research priorities in the field of synthetic biology.).

<text>Thomas Wyon the Younger (179222/23 September 1817) was an English medallist and chief engraver at the Royal Mint.

==Life==
Wyon was born in Birmingham. He was apprenticed to his father, Thomas Wyon (1767–1830), the chief engraver of the King&#x27;s seals, who taught him the art of engraving on steel; subsequently he studied at the sculpture school of the Royal Academy in London, where he earned silver medals in both the antique and the life class. In 1809, he struck his first medal, presented to Lieutenant Pearce, R.N. In 1810, he won the gold medal of the Society of Arts for medal engraving; the die, representing a head of Isis, was purchased by the society and used for striking its prize medals. From this period he produced many medals for schools, societies, Pitt clubs, and other institutions.
On 20 November 1811, Wyon was appointed probationary engraver to the Royal Mint, and was employed in making the bank tokens for England and Ireland, and coins for the British colonies and for Hanover. He also engraved his medal commemorative of the peace and his Manchester Pitt medal. On 13 Oct. 1815 he was appointed chief engraver to the mint, being then only twenty-three. The next year he brought out the new silver coinage for the United Kingdom (half-crown, shilling, and sixpence), designing the reverses himself. In 1817 he struck the maundy money, and began to make his pattern crown-piece in rivalry of Thomas Simon.

Signs of consumption now began to appear, and Wyon—a modest and talented artist—died on 23 (or 22) September 1817 at the Priory Farmhouse, near Hastings. He was buried in the graveyard attached to Christ Church, Southwark.

His younger brother, Benjamin Wyon (1802–1858), his nephews, Joseph Shepherd Wyon (1836–1873) and Alfred Benjamin Wyon (1837–1884), and his cousin, William Wyon (1795–1851) were also distinguished medallists.

==Work==
Among Wyon&#x27;s medals may be mentioned: 1809, Pearce medal; 1810, Isis medal (re-engraved in 1813); medal of Wellington; 1812, Wooldridge medal; medal for Royal Naval College, Portsmouth; 1813, Manchester Pitt Club medal; &quot;Upper Canada preserved&quot;; 1814, medals presented to the North American Indians; medal of the tsar of Russia struck during the visit of the Grand Duchess of Oldenburg to the English mint; treaty of Paris (published by Rundell &amp; Co. from his &quot;Peace checking the Fury of War,&quot; a design which had gained the gold medal of the Society of Arts); centenary of accession of house of Brunswick (for the corporation of Cork), and Liverpool Pitt club medal; 1815, Waterloo medal, with reverse, Victory, adapted from a Greek coin of Elis (Mayo, Medals, plate 22); and 1817, opening of Waterloo Bridge. Wyon also engraved (1813) seals for the Newcastle Antiquarian Society, the Chester Canal Company, and (c. 1815) the Limerick chamber of commerce.

Wyon&#x27;s engraving of Queen Victoria for the City of London medal was used as the basis for the design of the Penny Black, the world&#x27;s first postage stamp. Examples of the medal, in silver and bronze, are held in the R M Phillips Collection by the British Postal Museum &amp; Archive.

<doc id="1265288" wikidata="Q7529839" url="?curid=1265288" title="Sir William Yonge, 4th Baronet">
<text>Sir William Yonge, 4th Baronet, (c. 169310 August 1755) of Escot House in the parish of Talaton in Devon, was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons for 39 years from 1715 to 1754.

==Origins==
Yonge was the son and heir of Sir Walter Yonge, 3rd Baronet, and his second wife Gwen Williams, daughter of Sir Robert Williams, 2nd Baronet of Penryn, Cornwall. He was a great-great-grandson of Walter Yonge (1579–1649), a lawyer, merchant and notable diarist, whose diaries (1604–45) are valuable material for the contemporaneous history of Great Britain.

==Career==
In 1715 Yonge was returned as Member of Parliament for his family&#x27;s Rotten Borough of Honiton, in Devon and held the seat until 1754. He was also returned for Tiverton at the general elections of 1727, 1747 and 1754 but only took the seat in 1754. In the House of Commons he attached himself to the Whigs, and making himself useful to Sir Robert Walpole, was rewarded with a commissionership of the Treasury in 1724. King George II, who conceived a strong antipathy to Sir William, spoke of him as &quot;Stinking Yonge&quot;; but Yonge obtained a commissionership of the Admiralty in 1728, was restored to the Treasury in 1730, and in 1735 became Secretary at War. He distinguished himself especially in his defence of the Government against a hostile motion by Pulteney in 1742. He was created KB in 1725.
Making friends with the Pelhams, he was appointed Vice-Treasurer of Ireland for life in 1746. Acting on the committee of management for the impeachment of Lord Lovat in 1747, he won the applause of Horace Walpole by moving that prisoners impeached for high treason should be allowed the assistance of counsel. In 1748 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was a founding Governor of the Foundling Hospital, which worked to alleviate the scourge of child abandonment.

He succeeded his father, the 3rd Baronet, in 1731, taking possession of Escot House near Ottery St Mary, Devon, which had been built by his father.

==Literary career==
Yonge enjoyed some reputation as a versifier, some of his lines being even mistaken for the work of Pope, greatly to the disgust of the latter. He wrote the lyrics incorporated in a comic opera, adapted from Richard Brome&#x27;s &quot;The Jovial Crew&quot;, which was produced at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1730 and had considerable success.

==Marriages and children==
Yonge married in 1716, Mary, the daughter of Samuel Heathcote of Hackney, from whom he was divorced in 1724. At this point they had lived for some time apart and Yonge had a number of extramarital affairs. But when he found out his wife had a lover, too, he took the opportunity to sue his wife&#x27;s lover for damages, and then as the result of the divorce proceedings he got his wife&#x27;s dowry and a greater part of her fortune. The case was the inspiration for Lady Mary Montagu to write a poem &quot;Epistle from Mrs Yonge to Her Husband&quot;, protesting against the sexual double standard of her era.

By his second wife, Anne Howard, a daughter and coheiress of Thomas Howard, 6th Baron Howard of Effingham, he had two sons and six daughters.

==Death==
Yonge died at his seat of Escot, near Honiton, on 10 August 1755. He was succeeded in his title and estates by his eldest son Sir George Yonge, 5th Baronet.

<doc id="1265330" wikidata="Q158560" url="?curid=1265330" title="(Just Like) Starting Over">
<text>&quot;(Just Like) Starting Over&quot; is a song written and performed by John Lennon from the 1980 album, &quot;Double Fantasy&quot;. It was released as a single on 24 October 1980 in the United Kingdom, with Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Kiss Kiss&quot; as the B-side. It reached number one in both the US and UK after Lennon was murdered on 8 December 1980. It was Lennon&#x27;s final single released in his lifetime.

==Background==
&quot;(Just Like) Starting Over&quot; was the first single released from &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; and the first new recording Lennon had released since he left the music industry in 1975. It was chosen by Lennon not because he felt it was the best track on the album, but because it was the most appropriate following his five-year absence from the recording industry. He referred to it during production as the &quot;Elvis/Orbison&quot; track, as he &quot;tongue in cheek&quot; impersonated their vocal styles. Lennon explained, &quot;All through the taping of &#x27;Starting Over,&#x27; I was calling what I was doing &#x27;Elvis Orbison&#x27;: &#x27;I want you I need only the lonely.&#x27; I&#x27;m a born-again rocker, I feel that refreshed, and I&#x27;m going right back to my roots.&quot; At the start of the 2010 &quot;Stripped Down&quot; version of the song, Lennon says &quot;this one&#x27;s for Gene, and Eddie, and Elvis... and Buddy.&quot;

==Composition==
Although its origins were in unfinished demo compositions like &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Crazy&quot; and &quot;My Life&quot;, it was one of the last songs to be completed in time for the &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; sessions. &quot;We didn&#x27;t hear it until the last day of rehearsal,&quot; producer Jack Douglas said in 2005. Lennon finished the song while on holiday in Bermuda, and recorded it at The Hit Factory in New York City just weeks later. The song was originally titled &quot;Starting Over&quot;; however, &quot;(Just Like)&quot; was added prior to its release because of its similarity to Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Starting Over Again&quot; which had topped the US Country Charts earlier in the year. The chiming bell that opens the song was a deliberate allusion to the heavy tolling church bell that opens Lennon&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;Mother&quot;, illustrating how far Lennon had come in ten years.

While commercial releases of the song (original 45rpm singles, LPs and Compact Discs) run a length of three minutes and 54 seconds, a promotional 12&quot; vinyl single originally issued to radio stations features a longer fadeout, officially running at four minutes 17 seconds.

Musicologist Walter Everett noted melodic similarities between a portion of the song and the Beach Boys&#x27; 1964 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot;.

==Recording==
Lennon recorded &quot;(Just Like) Starting Over&quot; on 9 August 1980 at The Hit Factory. The track was mixed at the Record Plant on 25–26 September 1980.

==Release and reception==
The song is Lennon&#x27;s biggest solo hit in the US, staying at number 1 for five weeks. Before Lennon was murdered in New York City on 8 December 1980, the single had reached number 3 on the US charts. It reached number 1 for the week ending 27 December. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it at the No. 4 song for 1981. The song also reached number 1 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100.

In the UK, it had peaked at number 8 in the charts and had fallen to position number 21 before Lennon&#x27;s death propelled it to number 1. It was overtaken to the Christmas Number One Single rank by the St Winifred&#x27;s School Choir&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s No One Quite Like Grandma,&quot; finishing at number 2 on that list. By 6 January 1981, there were three Lennon songs in the UK top 5, a feat that remained unequalled for 35 years when Justin Bieber managed to accomplish this in January 2016.

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine considered &quot;(Just Like) Starting Over&quot; to be an &quot;uptempo, fresh sounding rocker,&quot; praising the &quot;irresistible melody and lyric line,&quot; the &quot;exceptional rhythm unit&quot; as well as Lennon&#x27;s vocal performance. &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;John steps briskly into the mainstream with this glorious pop-rocker.&quot;

In 2013, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the 62nd biggest hit of all time on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

&quot;Stereogum&quot; contributors Timothy and Elizabeth Bracy rated it as Lennon&#x27;s seventh best solo song, saying that it &quot;finds him in throwback mode, delightfully evoking the doo-wop of his childhood on an uncharacteristically winsome ode to rejuvenated love.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Stephen Lewis rated it as Lennon&#x27;s seventh greatest solo love song, saying that &quot;The undeniably catchy rock and roll song – a tribute to past rock and rollers – appeals to ears and hearts, with a solid groove and an optimistic and wistful lyric that is honest, without becoming maudlin.&quot;

On 8 October 2010, in honor of what would have been his 70th birthday the following day, iTunes released remastered albums, iTunes LPs, and a free track, the 2010 remix of &quot;(Just Like) Starting Over&quot;.

<text>Mokichi Okada (岡田茂吉 &quot;Okada Mokichi&quot;; 23 December 1882 – 10 February 1955) was the founder of the World Church of Messiah, that later became the Church of World Меssianity. He also acted as the spiritual leader of Shumei and the Johrei Fellowship. He is known by his followers by the honorific title or . He is the founder of Johrei, an energy healing ritual that uses &quot;divine light&quot; to dissolve the spiritual impurities that are understood to be the source of all physical, emotional, and personal problems.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
According to his official biography, Okada was born to a poor Buddhist family in Asakusa, Tokyo and, after many trials and tribulations, eventually made his fortune in the jewellery business. His success was short-lived however. After losing his wife, children and then business following an economic downturn and the Great Kanto Earthquake, he started to question the pursuit of material success. He remarried and went on to have further children but spurred on to find the answers he sought, he turned to religion to explore and express the spiritual aspect of life. 

=== Spiritual awakening ===
He was initially a follower of the Shinto offshoot Oomoto, a new religion that taught that the much anticipated Age of Light was approaching, where he became popular as a spiritual healer. In 1926 at the age of 45, Okada told his followers that he had received enlightenment and with it, a special revelation from God about the dawn of the Age of Light and his mission as a saviour of the people who were suffering. This later led him to found a further new religion to spread the teachings he received on establishing paradise on earth and creating a new civilisation. 

=== Teachings ===
Okada talked and wrote extensively about Paradise on Earth and God&#x27;s Will for humanity – health, wealth and happiness – that we may live in peace and harmony with nature, each other and ourselves. He summarised his teachings in three Pillars – the Art of Healing, The Art of Beauty and the Art of Nature.

In terms of healing, the main teaching that he shared was that of Johrei – channelling God&#x27;s Divine Light of Purification to clear the spirit of a person or place to establish a paradise-like state of health, abundance and happiness. He taught the importance of the spiritual world and that what happens in the spiritual world precedes events and outcomes in the physical domain. His premise of healing with light is that clouds developed in the spiritual realm when suffering occurred which when purified caused physical disease or accidents. If these &quot;clouds&quot; are cleared by Divine Light, then there would be no opportunity for the harm to occur. 

Okada valued art as a way to keep the spirits lifted and clear the viewer&#x27;s spirit through appreciation of beauty. He also taught natural farming methods to keep food pure and as nature intended to ensure that the body didn&#x27;t have to deal with chemicals which could cause a build up of toxins in the body, which were another cause of purifications. He also taught the need to study nature to understand the natural laws and how to live in harmony with them more peacefully.

Okada wrote and spoke extensively about his relationship with God and encouraged his followers to deepen their faith and dedication and develop their characters with truth, virtue and beauty.

He wrote many poems, prayers, books and articles and only a small selection of them have been translated out of Japanese.

=== Initial organizations ===
In 1935 he established the Japan Kannon Society, a religious organization that allowed him to talk a little about God, prayer, spiritual matters and continue to share his approach to spiritual healing with his followers within the parameters of traditional Japanese religious beliefs. But due to political restrictions on religious organizations at the time, Okada opted to develop a parallel medical route to expound his discoveries. In 1936 he established the &quot;Japan Health Association” in Koujimachi, Tokyo and he soon expanded to open a rehabilitation center focusing on the healing powers of light combined with Japanese massage and traditional hands on healing therapies, similar to what he had experienced in Oomoto. But in the same year it was shut down as a violation of the Medical Practitioners&#x27; Law (医師法違反). 

=== Sacred Grounds and Art Museum ===
In 1944 he moved to Gora, Hakone, and the following year he there started construction of , the sacred grounds, as a prototype of paradise on Earth. In 1945 he also started the construction of a second sacred ground, Zuiunkyō (瑞雲郷), in Atami. He also initiated the construction of the third and final of his sacred grounds, Heiankyô in Kyoto. 

While in Hakone, he started collecting national treasures of art and culture that he displayed there to the public in the that was completed in 1952.

=== World Church of Messiah ===
After WWII, the restrictions on religious freedom were dropped and in 1950, he established Sekai Meshiya Kyô, the World Church of Messiah. The purpose of this, was to bring the presence of the spirit of Messiah to all humanity. His intention, he said, was always to establish such an organization and explained that he had only followed a medical route early on because there was little freedom at the time for him to practice a new religion. 

He was a great proponent of culture, religion and art from around the world and read Bible and Quran. He went on to develop links to Christianity within his religious community, teaching his choir to sing Handel&#x27;s Messiah&#x27;s Halleluiah chorus and saying that his organization would work &quot;in concert with Christianity&quot;. This Western influence proved unpopular with his original followers and after his death was dropped from the teachings shared amongst the community which later was renamed as the Church of World Messianity, 世界救世教 &quot;Sekai Kyūsei Kyō,&quot; in 1957.

In 1954 he completed the sacred grounds at Atami but the same year he experienced a brain hemorrhage and almost died. As he started to recover, he told his close followers that he had received a miraculous blessing from God and had been born again as a Messiah, born again of the spirit by God in Heaven, and reported that as a consequence, his skin was like that of a new born baby and even his hair dresser had said his hair was soft like that of a newborn, and that it had regained its colour. Due to the controversial nature of these statements they were largely hidden from the public. 

=== Death ===
In 1955 he died, and left the church in the care of his wife. His followers honoured his death as his ascension into heaven.

== Family ==
Okada&#x27;s second wife Yoshi Okada became Nidai-Sama (second spiritual leader) upon his death, as she inherited the seat of Kyoshu, spiritual leader of the church. With the death of Nidai-Sama, the title of Kyoshu passed to the couple&#x27;s daughter, Itsuki Okada, who came to be called Sandai Kyoshu-Sama (Third Spiritual Leader) by the faithful until her abdication and replacement on the seat by her nephew, Yoichi Okada, now Yondai Kyoshu-Sama (Fourth Spiritual Leader). Sandai-Sama was responsible for establishing the Sanguetsu Academy, which works to improve the Japanese flower arranging technique of ikebana for the Messianic Church. Yoichi is Okada&#x27;s grandson, and he has a son, Masaaki, who is also active in the church leadership.

Okada’s second daughter, Miya Yoshioka (Miya-sama) was born in 1925 as officially became a member of the Okada Official Spiritual Lineage in 1975. Also demonstrating exceptional ability in the ceramic arts and &quot;ikebana&quot; (art of flower arrangement), she held a love for the arts throughout her life until she died in 2017 at the age of 91.

Okasa’s fourth son, Kunihiro Okada was born in 1932 and assumed his position in Okada’s Official Spiritual Lineage in 1975. Inheriting Okada’s ability in the arts, he demonstrated outstanding sensibility in fields such as metal craft and ceramics.

== Legacy ==
Okada&#x27;s work was very influential in the areas of Nature Farming, Japanese flower arranging, and art collecting in Japan, while his spiritual influence lives on through various religious organisations. A two-volume biography about him called (&quot;Light from the East&quot;) was published in 1994.

=== Sangetsu ===
The &quot;Sangetsu&quot; (山月) school of ikebana, inspired by Mokichi Okada, was founded in June 1972. The Mokichi Okada Association (MOA) was established in 1980 to continue his work &quot;toward the creation of a new civilization to be undertaken without confining Okada&#x27;s principles and their implementation within a religious framework&quot; (MOA acquired the status of a legal entity as a limited liability intermediary corporation in 2005, then transferred to one of general corporation in 2009, officially called MOA International Corporation). Much of Okada&#x27;s extensive art collection is now housed in the MOA Museum of Art in Atami, Japan.

=== Nature Farming ===

In 1936, Okada established an agricultural system originally called &quot;no fertilizer farming&quot; or &quot;Nature Farming&quot;. Offshoots such as the Sekai Kyusei Kyo, promoting &quot;Kyusei nature farming&quot;, and the Mokichi Okada Association formed after his death to continue promoting the work in Japan and South-East Asia.

According to the International Nature Farming Research Center in Nagano, Japan, it is based on the theories that:
* Fertilizers pollute the soil and weaken its power of production.
* Pests would break out from the excessive use of fertilizers
* The difference in disease incidence between resistant and susceptible plants is attributed to nutrition conditions inside the body.
* Vegetables and fruits produced by nature farming taste better than those by chemical farming.

<text>John Derbyshire (born 3 June 1945) is a British-born American computer programmer, journalist, and political commentator. He was noted for being one of the last paleoconservatives at the &quot;National Review&quot;, until he was fired in 2012 for writing an article for &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot; that was widely viewed as racist. Since 2012 he has written for white nationalist website VDARE.

In the article that caused his firing, Derbyshire suggested that white and East Asian parents should talk to their children about the threats posed to their safety by black people. He also recommended that parents tell their children not to live in predominantly black communities. He included the line &quot;If planning a trip to a beach or amusement park at some date, find out whether it is likely to be swamped with blacks on that date.&quot;

He has also written for the &quot;New English Review&quot;. His columns cover political-cultural topics, including immigration, China, history, mathematics, and race. Derbyshire&#x27;s 1996 novel about Chinese American immigrants, &quot;Seeing Calvin Coolidge in a Dream&quot;, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; &quot;Notable Book of the Year&quot;. His 2004 non-fiction book &quot;Prime Obsession&quot; won the Mathematical Association of America&#x27;s inaugural Euler Book Prize. A political book, &quot;We Are Doomed: Reclaiming Conservative Pessimism&quot;, was released in September 2009.

== Early life ==
Derbyshire attended the Northampton School for Boys and graduated from University College London, of the University of London, where he studied mathematics. Before turning to writing full-time, he worked on Wall Street as a computer programmer.

==Career==
===&quot;National Review&quot;===
Derbyshire worked as a writer at &quot;National Review&quot; until he was terminated in 2012 because of an article published in &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot; that was widely perceived as racist.

Derbyshire began writing for the far-right website VDARE in May 2012. In his first column for the website, Derbyshire wrote &quot;White supremacy, in the sense of a society in which key decisions are made by white Europeans, is one of the better arrangements History has come up with.&quot;

===Mathematics===
Derbyshire&#x27;s book &quot;Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics&quot; was first published in hardcover in 2003 and then paperback in 2004. It focuses on the Riemann hypothesis, one of the Millennium Problems. The book is aimed, as Derbyshire puts it in his prologue, &quot;at the intelligent and curious but nonmathematical reader ...&quot;

&quot;Prime Obsession&quot; explores such topics as complex numbers, field theory, the prime number theorem, the zeta function, the harmonic series, and others. The biographical sections give relevant information about the lives of mathematicians who worked in these areas, including Euler, Gauss, Lejeune Dirichlet, Lobachevsky, Chebyshev, Vallée-Poussin, Hadamard, as well as Riemann himself.

In 2006, Joseph Henry Press published another Derbyshire book of popular mathematics: &quot;Unknown Quantity: A Real And Imaginary History of Algebra&quot;.

===Role in &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot;===
Derbyshire had an uncredited role in &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot; (released in the United States as &quot;Return of the Dragon&quot;), a 1972 martial arts film directed by and starring, actor and martial artist Bruce Lee. Of landing the part, Derbyshire said: &quot;The casting director had obviously just trawled around the low-class guesthouses for unemployed foreigners of a sufficiently thuggish appearance.&quot;

== Views ==
Derbyshire writes in general from a small government conservative perspective. He notably ridiculed George W. Bush&#x27;s &quot;itty-bitty tax cut, paid for by dumping a slew of federal debt on your children and grandchildren,&quot; derided Bush as too sure of his religious convictions and for his &quot;rich-kid-ness&quot;. He has noted that small-government conservatism is unlikely to ever take hold in the United States (although he is personally sympathetic to it), called for immediate U.S. withdrawal from Iraq (but favoured the invasion), opposed market reforms or any other changes in Social Security, supported legal access to abortion, supported euthanasia in a fairly wide range of circumstances, and suggested that he might (in a time of international crisis) vote for Hillary Clinton as president. Derbyshire wrote about American schooling in his book &quot;We Are Doomed&quot;, &quot;Education is a vast sea of lies, waste, corruption, crackpot theorizing, and careerist log-rolling.&quot; He further argued that people &quot;had better brace ourselves for the catastrophe&quot; coming as a result.

Derbyshire once argued that America would be better off if women did not have the right to vote. In 2005, in a monthly column containing a series of miscellaneous musings, he controversially stated that women&#x27;s physical attractiveness peaks between the ages of 15 and 20.

Derbyshire was one of the inaugural speakers at the H.L. Mencken Club, a far-right club formed by Paul Gottfried and Richard B. Spencer, and has spoken at the group several additional times. The H.L. Mencken Club has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist organization.

=== Conflicts with &quot;National Review&quot; ===
Derbyshire differed from other writers at &quot;National Review&quot; magazine on many subjects. For example, Derbyshire supported Michael Schiavo&#x27;s position in the Terri Schiavo case. Derbyshire&#x27;s views on the Schiavo case attracted criticism from colleagues such as Ramesh Ponnuru. The Derbyshire–Ponnuru dispute arose again over Ponnuru&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;The Party of Death&quot;. Derbyshire reviewed the book harshly in the &quot;New English Review&quot;, and Ponnuru replied on &quot;National Review Online&quot;.

Though Derbyshire broadly agreed with other writers at &quot;National Review Online&quot; on immigration, he encountered strong opposition from former &quot;National Review Online&quot; blogger John Podhoretz, who described Derbyshire&#x27;s comments on restricting immigration to maintain &quot;ethnic balance&quot; in severe terms: &quot;But maintaining &#x27;ethnic balance&#x27; is not fine. It is chillingly, horrifyingly not fine.&quot;

==Personal life==
Derbyshire&#x27;s has been married to Lynette Rose Derbyshire, a Chinese immigrant, since 1986. The couple were married in the city of Jilin, in Jilin Province, northeast China, and have a daughter and a son. He has lived in Long Island, New York since 1992. In early 2012, he underwent treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

He has also written numerous articles for various publications, including &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;The New Criterion&quot;, &quot;The American Conservative&quot; and &quot;The Washington Times&quot;.

Derbyshire records a weekly podcast called &quot;Radio Derb,&quot; in which he comments on current events. The podcast was hosted on the &quot;National Review&quot; website before being moved to &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It is now hosted on VDARE.
