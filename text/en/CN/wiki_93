<text>Theodore Racing () was a Formula One constructor from Hong Kong founded by real estate magnate and millionaire Teddy Yip. They participated in 51 Grands Prix, entering a total of 64 cars.

In the present day Theodore Racing is an international motor racing team owned by Teddy Yip Jr. competing in the Macau Grand Prix.

Following its last race in 1992, the team made a successful return to racing at the Macau Grand Prix in 2013 under Teddy Yip Jr., owner of GP3 team Status Grand Prix.

Theodore Racing has won a record eight Macau Grands Prix – two as an independent team with Vern Schuppan and Geoff Lees, and six as a technical support team with the likes of Alex Lynn and Felix Rosenqvist.

==History==
In the early 1970s, amateur racer Yip met Sid Taylor and agreed to sponsor Vern Schuppan in Formula 5000. This led to Yip backing Schuppan in Formula One with Ensign in 1974. There followed further involvement in America with Schuppan and then support of Alan Jones in the US F5000 series in 1976. In Australia, Schuppan won the Rothmans International Series for Yip driving a Lola T332-Chevrolet in 1976. That year Yip established Theodore Racing. It was run by Taylor and entered an Ensign for Patrick Tambay in F1. After a moderately successful half season in 1977, with driver Patrick Tambay scoring four points and finishing 17th overall, Yip commissioned Ron Tauranac to build him an F1 car. The car, called the Theodore TR1, was difficult and Eddie Cheever failed to qualify in both Brazil and Argentina but then Keke Rosberg took over and won the International Trophy at Silverstone in the wet. However, Keke only qualified for a single GP, in South Africa. The car was abandoned in the mid-season. In the US, Yip supported Dan Gurney&#x27;s Eagle team.

In 1979, Yip helped to fund Ensign but the car was not a success. The car was driven by Derek Daly, Patrick Gaillard, and Marc Surer but there were no points scored. At the end of the year Teddy also funded a British F1 programme with a Wolf WR6 for David Kennedy and helped Desiré Wilson to become the first woman to win a Formula 1 race – albeit a national event.

Yip bought the Shadow team at the beginning of 1980, and Kennedy also moved to it, but the results were poor, the team was by then on its last legs, and in the mid-summer, Yip decided to retire the team and to rethink his involvement in racing and ended most of his other activities to concentrate on F1.

With Sid Taylor and Julian Randles he established Theodore Racing Ltd. and recruited Tony Southgate and team manager Jo Ramírez. The new car was dubbed the TY01 and was driven by Patrick Tambay at the start of 1981. In mid-season Tambay moved to Ligier and Yip gave the drive to Marc Surer. The same car was developed in 1982 and it became obvious that small teams could not easily survive in the turbo era. Yip merged Theodore with Ensign and used the Nigel Bennett-designed Ensign N183 design as a Theodore. The team hired Johnny Cecotto and Roberto Guerrero but at the end of that season the team shut down and Mo Nunn moved to America, where he enjoyed great success as a race engineer through the 1980s and into the 1990s and eventually set up a successful team of his own in CART. 1983 also saw a guest drive in a Theodore by former Grand Prix driver Brian Henton at the non-championship 1983 Race of Champions where he finished fourth, the highest a Theodore finished all season.

===Macau Grand Prix===
Yip ran a team each year at the Macau GP until the late 1980s and in 1983 was behind the switch from Formula Atlantic rules to Formula 3. The result was a huge success and Theodore Racing has won the event a record seven times, notably with Ayrton Senna in the first year of F3.

In October 2013, it was announced that the name Theodore Racing would be revived by Teddy Yip&#x27;s son, Teddy Yip Jr., for the 2013 Macau Grand Prix to mark the 30th anniversary of Senna&#x27;s victory in the event. After Briton Alex Lynn won the race, Teddy Yip Jr. said, &quot;This was a fairytale way for the Theodore name to return to the great Macau Grand Prix in its anniversary year. To be with SJM to witness Alex&#x27;s victory is an emotional day, and a fitting tribute to my father&#x27;s contribution to this great Macau event.&quot;

Teddy Yip Jr. joined forces with Formula Three Champions, Prema Powerteam for a second consecutive year in 2014, entering a three car Macau Grand Prix team with drivers Nicholas Latifi, Esteban Ocon and Antonio Fuoco. Latifi finished fifth with Ocon crashing out during a battle for the lead and Fuoco failing to finish the race.

The trio of SJM Theodore Racing by Prema entries for the 2015 event, which utilise Mercedes-Benz powered Dallara Formula 3 cars, will be driven by Sweden&#x27;s Felix Rosenqvist, Jake Dennis of Great Britain and Canada&#x27;s Lance Stroll.
The 2017 Macau GP and FIA F3 World Cup event saw SJM Theodore field Callum Ilott alongside Mick Schumacher, Maximilan Gunther and Guanyu Zhou in their line up of four Mercedes-Benz Formula 3 cars. Ilott headed their qualifying score sheet with a P3, newly signed as a Ferrari Junior that month. Gunther qualified P4, Schumacher in P7 and Guanyu Zhou in P10. Ilott went on to win the Macau Qualifying Race for SJM Theodore by Prema with a lead of 7.957s ahead of the rest of the field. The other SJM Theodore cars came in with P4 (Gunther), P10 (Zhou) and P20 (Schumacher). The Sunday Macau GP was marred for SJM Theodore by a first lap racing incident between Ilott and Joel Erikkson, as Ilott retook the lead, taking them out of the lead of the race, which was won by Dan Ticktum. Gunther, Guanyu Zhou and Schumacher finished 5th, 8th, and 16th respectively.

===Indy cars===

Theodore began participating in Indy cars in 1977 as a sponsor for the Simpson Sport team in the USAC National Championship starting off the season with a pair of McLaren M16C-Offenhausers for Simpson to drive as No. 38 and for Steve Krisiloff to drive as No. 39.

At the season-opening Datsun Twin 200 at Ontario Motor Speedway with Simpson finishing in ninth and Krisiloff retiring due to clutch issues. Krisiloff would then leave the team. At the Indianapolis 500 Simpson retired from driving and Formula One driver Clay Regazzoni would first drive the No. 38. The car was then destroyed in a practice crash by Regazzoni. Regazzoni qualified the No. 39 in 29th place but retired from the race with a fuel leak after 25 laps, finishing in 30th place. 
After Indianapolis, Rick Mears would drive the car starting at the Schafer&#x27;s 500 at Pocono International Raceway. Mears would get a best finish of fifth place at the Tony Bettenhausen 200 at Wisconsin State Fairgrounds Park Speedway. Mears would finish 20th in the final point standings.

Theodore would return in 1979 to sponsor All American Racers in the SCCA/CART PPG World Series for # Eagle 79-Cosworth DFX driven by Mike Mosley. Mosley would get a best finish of third place at the Indianapolis 500, where he would also set the fastest lap of the race. Mosley finished 10th in the championship.

In 1980, Theodore returned with AAR and Mosley. They originally fielded the No. 48 Eagle 80-Cosworth DFX at the Datsun Twin 200 at Ontario Motor Speedway. In the race, Mosley retired in 19th place due to a broken cylinder. Starting at the Indianapolis 500 the team replaced the Cosworth engine with a Chevrolet V8. Mosley qualified in 26th place and retired after five laps due to a broken gasket, finishing in 32nd place. the Theodore/AAR team appeared again at the True Value 500 at Pocono International Raceway before parting ways. In the race, Mosley qualified in fourth place and finished in 23rd place after retiring due to a burnt piston. Mosley finished 41st in the championship.

In 1981, Theodore fielded their own car. They first appeared at the Indianapolis 500 (part of the USAC Gold Crown Series) with the No. 33 Red Roof Inns McLaren M24-Cosworth DFX with Vern Schuppan driving. The car qualified in 18th place and finish in third place. The team also raced at the Van Scoy Diamond Mines 500 at Pocono International Raceway. The car started in fifth place and retired in 17th place due to a loss of oil pressure. Schuppan went on the finish 10th in the USAC standings. The team also competed in the CART/PPG World Series, with Schuppan driving. The team first appeared at the Norton Michigan 500 at Michigan International Speedway finishing in 24th place due to a blown engine. The team then went into partnership with Thomas W. Barrett III for the AirCal 500K at Riverside International Raceway, the II Copa Mexico 150 at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez and the Miller High Life 150 at Phoenix International Raceway. The team replaced the McLaren M24 with a March 81C for Riverside. Schuppan achieved a best finish of 15th place at Phoenix and finished 36th in points.

At the 1982 Indianapolis 500 (counted toward the 1981–82 USAC Gold Crown Series) Theodore would field with Bob Fletcher Racing a car for Desire Wilson, the No. 33 Eagle 81-Cosworth DFX. Wilson failed to qualify. Teddy Yip Sr. was attending the race while Teddy Yip Jr. was born.

In 1983, Theodore supplied factory-backed chassis for Tom Sneva and Kevin Cogan, fielded by Bignotti-Carter Racing. The chassis was practised by both drivers at the Indianapolis 500. Both would use a March 83C in the race, which Sneva won and Cogan finished in fifth place. Later in the season, Cogan used the chassis with a Cosworth DFX at the Provimi Veal 200 at Road America and the Escort Radar Warning 200 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. Cogan retired from Road America in 19th place due to an electrical problem and finished sixth at Mid Ohio and in 15th place in the final standings (most of the points were scored using a March chassis). The chassis was then used by Ed Wachs Motor Sports for Jim Crawford.

Crawford achieved a fourth-place finish at the 1984 season-opening Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach at the Streets of Long Beach. Crawford failed to qualify at the Indianapolis 500 and started one other race, the Meadowlands Grand Prix at the Meadowlands Sports Complex, retiring in 21st place due to broken suspension. Crawford would finish in 27th place in the final standings.

In 2016, Theodore Racing returned to the IndyCar Series to contest three rounds of the 2016 season; Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach; Angie&#x27;s List Grand Prix of Indianapolis and the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500, where Graham Rahal’s No. 15 Honda will be entered under &#x27;Rahal Letterman Lanigan with Theodore Racing&#x27;.

<text>Leonard Francis Shackleton (3 May 1922 – 28 November 2000) was an English footballer. Known as the &quot;Clown Prince of Football&quot;, he is generally regarded as one of English football&#x27;s finest ever entertainers. He also played cricket in the Minor Counties for Northumberland.

Able to play at inside forward or outside forward, he scored 134 goals in 427 league and cup appearances in just over 11 seasons in the Football League, and before that scored 171 goals in 209 league and cup appearances during wartime football. His ball control skills made him one of the most talented players in the country, but his individualism and outspoken nature limited him to only five England caps in a six-year international career. He also never won a trophy or league title.

Born in Bradford, he spent his teenage years before World War II with Bradford Park Avenue, Kippax United, Arsenal, Enfield, and London Paper Mills, before he turned professional at Bradford Park Avenue in 1940. He spent the war assembling aircraft radios and playing for Bradford PA, and was sold on to Second Division rivals Newcastle United for a £13,000 fee in October 1946. He scored six goals on his Newcastle debut, but fell out with the club&#x27;s directors, and was sold on to Sunderland for a British transfer record fee of £20,050 in February 1948. He scored 97 goals in 320 First Division matches for the club, with the closest he came to a trophy being the 1949–50 season when Sunderland finished third in the league, and when they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1955 and in 1956. He retired due to an ankle injury in 1957, and became a sports journalist.

==Club career==
Leonard Francis Shackleton was born in Bradford, England on 3 May 1922 to Leonard and Irene Shackleton; his father was a self-employed painter and decorator and his mother was a housewife. He was the elder brother to Irene and John; John went on to sign for Sunderland, though never played a first team game and quit the game to become a chiropodist and tennis coach. Shackleton attended Carlton High Grammar school, and became the first Bradford schoolboy to represent England schoolboys when he scored two goals in a 6–2 victory over Wales schoolboys; also in the team that day was future Sunderland teammate Dickie Davis.

===Early career===
Despite his family being keen Bradford City supporters, Shackleton signed amateur forms with Bradford Park Avenue after being signed by manager Billy Hardy. Bradford PA permitted him to play for Kippax United in the Leeds League. Arsenal&#x27;s secretary-manager George Allison heard of Shackleton&#x27;s talents, and drove to Bradford to sign him to amateur forms in 1938. Arsenal permitted him to play for Enfield in the Athenian League, and he in fact only represented Arsenal twice in reserve team fixtures in the Southern League. He was released by Arsenal in May 1939 and told by Allison that he was too small to succeed as a footballer, and should find other employment. Following this disappointment he took a job at London Paper Mills in Dartford, and turned out for the factory&#x27;s works team in the Kent League.

===Bradford Park Avenue===
Shackleton returned to his hometown upon hearing of the outbreak of World War II and took up employment assembling aircraft radios for GEC, at which point he rejoined Bradford Park Avenue as an amateur after being invited to the Park Avenue Stadium by manager David Steele. He turned professional at the club shortly before Christmas 1940 and received a £10 signing-on fee, which the cash-strapped club had to pay in instalments. On Christmas morning he played for Bradford PA, then guested for Huddersfield Town in the afternoon, and scored in both matches. In the wartime leagues he scored a total of 171 goals in league and cup 209 appearances for Bradford PA. He became a Bevin Boy in order to avoid his call-up for national service in 1945 as he did not want to miss the resumption of the Football League, but found the experience of coal mining terrifying and gruelling. He began to avoid his shifts in the pits, and so was called into the Royal Air Force, where he served the remainder of his national service. He scored four goals in seven Second Division matches at the start of the 1946–47 season, but left the club in October 1946 after growing tired of heckling from his own supporters who did not appreciate his individualist style.

===Newcastle United===
In October 1946, Shackleton was sold to Second Division side Newcastle United for a £13,000 fee. He was sold as a direct replacement for Albert Stubbins, who had been sold from Newcastle to Liverpool for the same fee. He scored six goals on his debut in Newcastle&#x27;s 13–0 defeat of Newport County at St James&#x27; Park on 5 October, with three of his goals coming within the space of just 155 seconds. However his return to Park Avenue in his fourth game for Newcastle was not a happy one, as he had a penalty saved by former teammate Chick Farr in a 2–1 defeat to Bradford PA. The &quot;Magpies&quot; boasted a devastating forward line of Jackie Milburn, Roy Bentley, Charlie Wayman, Shackleton, and Tommy Pearson, and totalled 95 league goals in the 1946–47 season, though their tally of 62 goals conceded and 13 defeats left the club having to settle for fifth place. They did though reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten 4–0 by Charlton Athletic. After the semi-final game he and club captain Joe Harvey went on strike over housing issues; the club&#x27;s board eventually relented and granted Shackleton the house they had initially promised him, though to save face told the press that Harvey and Shackleton had been in the wrong and had apologised. He further came into conflict with the club at Christmas 1947, when he and goalkeeper Jack Fairbrother refused to join the squad on a scouting party on opponents Charlton Athletic, who they faced later that season in the third round of the FA Cup. Unhappy with the club, he handed in a transfer request, which was granted.

===Sunderland===
In February 1948, Shackleton was sold to Newcastle&#x27;s rivals Sunderland for a British transfer fee record of £20,050. He was one of a number of a squad full of big name players signed by the club for a total outlay of around £250,000 during the post-war era, which earned Sunderland the nickname of the &#x27;Bank of England&#x27; club. However Shackleton made his debut in a 5–1 defeat to Derby County at the Baseball Ground, and Sunderland finished just four points above the relegation zone – at that time the club had never been relegated out of the First Division. He later admitted that the players were more a collection of talented individuals than a true team, and that &quot;it takes time to harness and control a team of thoroughbreds. It took time to achieve the blend at Roker Park&quot;. Shackleton and centre-forward Trevor Ford would never build any kind of relationship on or off the pitch however, and Ford once threatened to never play in the same Sunderland team as Shackleton until he was forced to back down by manager Bill Murray. Ford was sold on to Cardiff City in November 1953.

Shackleton never won any honours with Sunderland, the closest he came to doing so being a third-place finish in 1949–50, when they finished one point behind champions Portsmouth. Shackleton felt that a surprise home defeat to Manchester City on 15 April was both decisive and galling, as teammate Jack Stelling twice missed a penalty in a 2–1 loss. Sunderland lost fewer games than any other team in the 1954–55 season, but still ended up four points behind champions Chelsea. They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1955 and in 1956, losing 1–0 to Manchester City at Villa Park and then 3–0 to Birmingham City at Hillsborough. He injured his ankle on the opening day of the 1957–58 season, and announced his retirement shortly afterwards. This meant he played only 45 minutes for new manager Alan Brown, who had a reputation as a tough taskmaster. The club were reluctant to grant him a benefit match, but relented after Shackleton threatened to tell the FA about illegal payments the club had made.

==International career==
Shackleton won his first full cap for England in a 0–0 draw with Denmark on 26 September 1948. He was dropped and replaced by Stan Pearson for England&#x27;s next game, before making a surprise return in a 1–0 win over Wales at Villa Park on 10 November 1948. His third cap came again against Wales, in a 4–1 victory in Cardiff on 15 October 1949. He then had to wait five years for his fourth cap, in which time the England selectors had tried 17 different players at inside-forward, with limited success. Selectors had always viewed the rebellious Shackleton with distrust, and one selector who was challenged over Shackleton&#x27;s continued absence in the England team told a journalist that &quot;we play at Wembley, not the London Palladium.&quot; He made his return again against Wales, in a 3–2 victory at Wembley Stadium. He put in his finest performance however in his final England appearance, scoring with a chipped goal in a 3–1 win over the then World Champions West Germany on 1 December 1954. He later wrote that the goal was &quot;my most memorable scoring effort in a lifetime of soccer... I felt a keen sense of satisfaction – not because the goal made our victory over Germany certain, but because I had decided exactly how to go about scoring it long before the chance presented itself. Anticipation and fulfilment.&quot;

==Style of play==
Journalist Malcolm Hartley, wrote of Shackleton: &quot;Apart from the adhesive ball control and breathtaking body swerve, Shack could hit a ball. His slender legs could crack the ball like a Bofors gun.&quot; One of his contemporaries remarked: &quot;Once in possession, and few can match his dexterity at bringing the ball under control, the ball becomes his slave. All the skills of inside forward play – dribbling, feinting, correct positioning and accurate passing are his to command.&quot;

A showman who liked to entertain the crowd, he was able to cut the ball with sufficient spin that it would roll towards an opponent only to stop and then return to him as though on a string. He was also adept at back heeling penalty kicks into the goal. He would rarely track back and defend however, and antics were sometimes criticised as &quot;unsportsman-like&quot;. On one occasion, 2–1 up against Arsenal with 5 minutes to go, he dribbled the ball into The Gunners&#x27; penalty area before putting his foot on it, pretending to comb his hair while looking at his watch. Other examples include mocking opposition full-backs by playing one-twos with the corner flag, literally sitting on the ball to torment defenders who could not dispossess him, and teasing a beaten goalkeeper by putting his foot on the ball on the goal line. Sunderland teammate Trevor Ford wrote in his autobiography that: &quot;where did it [Shackleton&#x27;s antics] get us? Precisely nowhere. The result was that when he did make a move, the opposing defence was in position and the attack broke down. Time and again when I thought Shack was going to slip a goalscoring pass to me he would veer off&quot;. However Billy Bingham defended Shackleton by noting that Ford had poor positional skills.

==Cricket career==
While playing for Sunderland, Shackleton played cricket for Wearmouth Colliery and for Northumberland in the 1948 Minor Counties Championship. His genius and humour was also evident on the cricket field. At Wearmouth, he would entertain the crowd by pretending to miss slip catches, then looking behind him as if the ball had gone to the boundary, before producing the ball from his pocket. While at Sunderland he played for Wearmouth Colliery in the Durham Senior League. He also played cricket for Lidget Green in the Bradford League, and for Northumberland in the Minor Counties League.

==Journalism career and later life==
Shackleton became a sports journalist after retiring as a footballer. He had been an outspoken critic of the football establishment during his playing career, particularly so of the maximum wage rule. He used his nickname, &quot;The Clown Prince of Soccer&quot;, for his 1956 autobiography. One chapter of that book was &quot;The Average Director&#x27;s Knowledge of Football&quot;. It consisted of a single blank page. The book proved to be immensely popular, and ran into five editions within three months.

Shackleton, who had also been a barber during his playing career, had three sons with his wife Marjorie. He moved to Grange-over-Sands in Cumbria on retirement and wrote &quot;Return of the Clown Prince&quot; with his son Roger. He had a heart attack in August 2000 and died on 28 November that year, aged 78.

Only after his death he became known to many and younger people, esp. to foreigners, because his fame was spread around Europe by the legendary &quot;anarcho-folk-punk-band&quot; Chumbawamba in their &quot;Song To Len Shackleton&quot; (released 2002 on their &quot;Readymades&quot; CD)

<text>Token Racing was a short-lived Formula One team and constructor from the United Kingdom, participating in four Grands Prix of the 1974 Formula One season.

Token&#x27;s history effectively began in 1971. Ron Dennis was trying to find sponsorship for his Rondel Racing team. Through Ron&#x27;s then-girlfriend, who was the daughter of John Phelps, director of Phelps Antique Furniture in Twickenham, one of its regular customers, Tony Vlassopulos, a barrister son of a Greek shipowner, was asked to sponsor Rondel.

Vlassopulos asked his friend, Ken Grob, chairman of Alexander Howden, insurance brokers in London, if he was interested in joining in. Grob said yes, on the proviso that his young son Ian Grob could be part of the team, which was agreed upon. From that moment forward, Tony Vlassopulos became Dennis&#x27;s first sponsor.

In late 1973 Rondel Racing, by now a successful Formula Two team founded by Ron Dennis and Neil Trundle, decided to enter F1. Dennis asked Ray Jessop to design the car, while backing was to come from the French oil company Motul, which had sponsored the team for the previous two years, in addition to Vlassopulos and Grob. For 1974, a Ray Jessop-designed F1 car was planned, but the energy crisis affected Motul&#x27;s support. However, the funds were, in fact, not available to support a F1 leap, even with Motul involved. Trundle continued with the already-designed car from Jessop; Vlassopulos and Grob took over the ownership, with the car becoming the Token, the &quot;To&quot; and the &quot;Ken&quot; coming from the backers&#x27; first names and the RJ02 in honour of Jessop.
The team made its F1 debut in April 1974 at the non-Championship International Trophy race at Silverstone, with Welshman Tom Pryce at the wheel. Its first Championship race came the following month, at the Belgian Grand Prix, where Pryce qualified 20th but retired at three-quarter distance following a collision with Jody Scheckter&#x27;s Tyrrell. The team entered the next race at Monaco but was forbidden from taking part on the basis of Pryce&#x27;s supposed inexperience, prompting the Welshman to move to the Shadow team. However, upset by this, Vlassopulos took out his Formula 3 racer, Buzz Buzaglo, and then put in Pryce, who then competed in the Formula 3 race for Ippokampos Racing, Vlassopulos&#x27; Formula 3 concern, and subsequently won the race.

After sitting out the next three races, Token reappeared at the British Grand Prix with David Purley in place of Pryce. But after failing to qualify, Purley left and was replaced by fellow Englishman Ian Ashley. At the Nürburgring for the next race in Germany, Ashley qualified 26th and last, and ran as high as 8th before a tyre problem dropped him to 14th at the end. Then in Austria, Ashley qualified 24th, but finished unclassified after more wheel problems.

By this stage, however, the team had run out of money, and Vlassopulos and Grob closed it down. The RJ02 subsequently passed into the hands of the Safir Engineering company.

<text>Toleman Motorsport was a Formula One constructor based in the UK. It participated in Formula One between 1981 and 1985, competing in 70 Grands Prix. Today, it is best known for giving Ayrton Senna his Formula One debut.

The team was generally uncompetitive during its short lifetime, prompting Senna to leave after just one year. However, several of its engineers, including Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds, stayed with the team after its sale to the Benetton Group and eventually built the organisation into the title-winning Benetton Formula. As such, Toleman is the progenitor of the racing lineage informally known as &quot;Team Enstone.&quot;

==Origins==
In 1926, Edward Toleman established a company to deliver Ford cars from the Ford factory to dealers across the country. Edward&#x27;s son Albert took over the company in the 1950s, and Albert&#x27;s sons Ted and Bob succeeded him in 1966. The Toleman brothers recruited Alex Hawkridge to expand their transportation business into Europe. 

The Toleman family were enthusiastic gentleman drivers. Albert Toleman won several club-level rally championships. Ted Toleman participated in Formula Two, the Dakar Rally, and the 1976 24 Hours of Le Mans. Unfortunately, Bob Toleman died in a racing accident in 1976.

Hawkridge encouraged the company to enter auto racing by sponsoring competitors. In 1976, Toleman began sponsoring Rad Dougall in the British Formula Ford Championship, although Dougall broke his legs in a crash the same day Toleman agreed to fund him. Toleman continued sponsoring Dougall for 1977, and he won the Formula Ford 2000 title that year. Impressed with the results, Ted Toleman agreed to start his own Formula Two team.

== Formula Two ==
From 1978 to 1980, Toleman spent three seasons in the European Formula Two Championship under the leadership of Alex Hawkridge and Roger Silman. To prepare for the higher level of competition, the team hired Royale Racing designer Rory Byrne, with an eye towards eventually building his own cars. The team steadily improved from year to year.

In 1978, Toleman ran one car, a customer March-BMW. Rad Dougall made the podium in the very first race, but scored only one more point that season. Byrne accused March&#x27;s Robin Herd of undermining Toleman to benefit March&#x27;s works team. He concluded that &quot;it’s no use having a customer car, you’re always one step behind.&quot;

In 1979, Toleman fielded a second car (piloted by Brian Henton), a customer Ralt-Hart. The team still used the previous year&#x27;s March chassis when the Ralt was unavailable but otherwise preferred the Ralt. The Hart engines were less powerful than the BMWs but much lighter, with outstanding reliability. Henton finished 2nd in the championship standings, losing the title to Marc Surer by two points. He would have won the title but for the events of the 1979 Mediterranean Grand Prix, where he finished first on track but was subsequently disqualified.

In 1980, the F2 regulations were revised to limit ground effect. Derek Warwick arrived to replace Dougall, bringing with him financial support from sponsor BP. Byrne unveiled his first team-built chassis, the Toleman TG280, which exploited a loophole that allowed the team to continue running a ground effect car. In addition, the team switched from Goodyear to Pirelli tyres, as Byrne felt that Goodyear&#x27;s tyres were optimised for qualifying and not a full race distance. Toleman-Hart dominated the F2 season. Henton and Warwick finished 1-2 atop the standings, with a lead so large they skipped the final race of the season. The car was so strong that when Toleman customer drivers were included, the team accounted for three of the top four and four of the top seven drivers in the standings. Toleman cars also won six of the twelve races.

==Formula One==
Toleman entered Formula One for the season. Although Hawkridge admitted that the team was not ready to compete that year, he explained that the team had a short window of opportunity to enter the top level, because the FISA side of the FISA–FOCA war wanted to add teams to improve its political position against the established FOCA teams like Brabham, McLaren, and Williams. Toleman would later refuse to join FOCA&#x27;s boycott of the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix.

The team continued to recruited talented engineers, signing Byrne&#x27;s former Royale lieutenant Pat Symonds for 1981 by promising to double his salary. The team innovated by sourcing the first fibre-optic engine management system, which (according to Hawkridge) improved reliability.

Most importantly, Toleman sought to distinguish itself from other small teams by commissioning its successful F2 engine supplier, Hart, to produce turbocharger engines for the team. By that time, Formula One was beginning to be dominated by turbo-powered cars, which outpaced the naturally aspirated engines previously dominant in the sport. Looking back, Symonds remarked that &quot;if Alex and Ted Toleman had said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s go F1 racing, let&#x27;s buy a [naturally aspirated Cosworth] DFV,&#x27; we&#x27;d have been a hell of a lot more successful in 1981 – but we wouldn’t have been around by 1990. We&#x27;d have been just another team.&quot;

=== 1981–1982: Difficult early years ===
Toleman suffered greatly in the short run, due to growing pains associated with the innovative turbo technology and other issues. During this period, Toleman&#x27;s cars were mocked in the racing press as &quot;The Pig&quot; (for their poor handling) and &quot;The Belgrano&quot; (for their oil leaks).

In 1981, the team retained Brian Henton and Derek Warwick from 1980&#x27;s dominant F2 campaign, but the Toleman TG181 was exceptionally poor, qualifying for just two races all season. Warwick remarked that the car was &quot;impossible to drive&quot; and that &quot;we weren&#x27;t just slow: we were seven seconds a lap off the back row.&quot; The team failed to qualify for a race until September, when Henton made the cut for the Italian Grand Prix. Warwick qualified for the final race of the season, winning a £25,000 bet for doing so.In , Henton left and was replaced by Teo Fabi. Nonetheless, the team managed to start qualifying consistently for races, but finished only two races all season, due in large part to engine reliability issues. The team used upgraded TG181Cs until the carbon-composite Toleman TG183 (the team skipped the number TG182) was ready in late August. The TG183 was used in only two Grands Prix (Italy and Las Vegas) that year, but Warwick did record the team&#x27;s first fastest lap in the .

With sponsor Candy threatening to pull funding for 1983, the team resorted to a gimmick strategy to reach second place at the , however briefly. The team started Warwick on a half-tank of petrol, giving him a speed advantage over the other drivers&#x27; fully-loaded cars. Warwick knew going in that he would not finish the race, and ran out of fuel after 40 laps. The team lied to the press that Warwick had suffered a mechanical failure. Satisfied with the positive exposure, Candy agreed to stay with the team.

=== 1983: Emergence as a serious team ===
In , the TG183B showed improved form thanks to a major update. Derek Warwick was retained, while Teo Fabi was replaced by Bruno Giacomelli. The budget increased as Candy&#x27;s sponsorship was joined by Iveco brand Magirus and BP.

The Hart turbos finally began showing true pace, with Warwick qualifying fifth and sixth in the first two races. The team peaked at the end of the season: Warwick scored the team&#x27;s first points with a fourth-place finish at the Dutch Grand Prix, kicking off a run of four consecutive scoring finishes to close out the year. Toleman finished 9th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with ten points, putting itself a cut above the other backmarkers like Arrows, Theodore, Ligier, Spirit, ATS, Osella, and RAM, none of which scored more than four points.

=== 1984: Peaking with Ayrton Senna ===
In , Warwick departed for the factory Renault team, while Giacomelli left F1 for CART. In response, the team scored a coup by signing highly touted rookie Ayrton Senna, who had just won the 1983 British Formula Three Championship. Senna tested for Toleman and immediately developed a rapport with Byrne, who begged Hawkridge to sign him. However, Senna knew that he had the talent to race for a top team – Bernie Ecclestone had considered signing him for Brabham to partner reigning Drivers&#x27; Champion Nelson Piquet, but Piquet vetoed the idea – and negotiated a relatively low £100,000 release clause from Toleman. Senna was paired with Venezuelan F2 driver and former dual Grand Prix Motorcycle World Champion Johnny Cecotto. However, Cecotto&#x27;s F1 career ended mid-season when he broke both legs during practice for the British Grand Prix, and Stefan Johansson was eventually signed to finish out the season.

Toleman got off to a poor start, as the team was still using the 1983 cars for the first four races of 1984. Senna made his F1 debut at the , at Jacarepaguá. He qualified an unimpressive 17th (Cecotto qualified 18th), and both drivers retired with engine failures. However, Senna rallied to score his first F1 point at round 2 in Kyalami, despite suffering major front wing damage on the opening lap. He also scored at the following race at Spa-Francorchamps, but only after Tyrrell&#x27;s Stefan Bellof was disqualified from the entire season due to technical infringements. 

The demanding Senna quickly grew disillusioned with the team&#x27;s Pirelli tyres; no Pirelli driver scored points through round 5 of the season, except Senna. At Imola, the team sat out the first day of qualifying due to disputes with Pirelli, which along with a fuel pressure problem on the second day, contributed to Senna&#x27;s failure to qualify for the race (the only time he failed to qualify in his entire career). Following the race, Senna successfully induced Toleman to break its Pirelli contract and sign with Michelin. Ironically, this decision eventually led to Toleman&#x27;s demise and absorption by the Benetton Group in 1985 (see below).The TG184 and the new Michelin tyres were ready for the . Although both drivers retired, Senna was delighted with the immediate improvement in performance. The very next race, Senna announced himself to the world with a dazzling second-place finish at the torrentially rain-soaked Monaco Grand Prix. When Jacky Ickx controversially called off the race after lap 31 of 77, Senna was closing in on leader Alain Prost, whose brakes were repeatedly locking up due to a deteriorating brake balance. (That said, Senna&#x27;s suspension was already on the verge of failure, and Bellof&#x27;s (later-disqualified) Tyrell was actually faster than Senna at the end of the race.) In the following years, a conspiracy theory developed that Ickx, a Porsche sportscar driver, called off the race to ensure that Prost&#x27;s Porsche-powered McLaren would win.

The team&#x27;s performance fell off in mid-season, with Senna finishing only one out of six races at one point due to mechanical failures. In addition, Cecotto finished only two out of nine races that season. The lone bright spot, of sorts, was the . The weekend was marred by Cecotto&#x27;s injury, but Senna qualified fourth and scored his second Formula One podium. Fighting for third, he &quot;hound[ed] [Elio] de Angelis unmercifully&quot; and picked up the position with two laps to go once de Angelis&#x27; engine faltered. Following the race, he received a large ovation from the Brands Hatch crowd.

Towards the end of the season, Senna announced his departure, having triggered his release clause to sign with Team Lotus. In response, Hawkridge suspended Senna for the ; release clause or not, the Brazilian was still contractually obligated to inform Toleman before negotiating with other teams. Pierluigi Martini filled in for Senna at Monza. Cecotto&#x27;s belated replacement Stefan Johansson made his way from 17th place to 4th in his Toleman debut, while Martini failed to qualify. Senna returned to the team for the final two races and finished off the year in style with a third podium at the .

Toleman finished a career-best 7th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, scoring 16 points, 13 courtesy of Senna. Senna also recorded the only three podiums in the team&#x27;s history.

=== 1985: Near-collapse and sale to Benetton ===
Following Senna&#x27;s departure, the Toleman team sought to maintain its momentum by retaining Johansson and signing John Watson for the season. In addition, that year&#x27;s TG185 was the first carbon monocoque to be fabricated in-house at the Witney factory.

However, the team nearly collapsed. Michelin withdrew from F1 at the end of 1984, forcing the team to confront the fact that it had alienated every remaining tyre supplier in Formula One. Pirelli was unwilling to supply Toleman again after the events of 1984, and Goodyear was also upset at Hawkridge due to the manner in which Toleman switched from Goodyear to Pirelli in Formula Two. Without F1-quality tyres, Toleman was forced to sit out the first three races of the 1985 season. The team parted ways with both drivers: Johansson quit the team to join Tyrell and later Ferrari, and Watson unsuccessfully asked to be paid for the races Toleman was unable to enter for tyre reasons.

Toleman returned in round 4 at Monaco, after Italian fashion label United Colors of Benetton bought the team in mid-season and acquired a Pirelli supply contract from the defunct Spirit team. Benetton kept the Toleman name until season&#x27;s-end. The team initially lacked the funds to run multiple cars, so Teo Fabi was Toleman&#x27;s sole driver for the first six races. Piercarlo Ghinzani joined Fabi for the final seven races. Toleman&#x27;s final year in F1 was as unsuccessful as its early years, as the team finished only two races and scored no points. The team&#x27;s last hurrah was Fabi&#x27;s pole position at the .

== Legacy ==
When Ted Toleman sold the team to Benetton, the Italians promised to keep the staff together. Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds, in particular, remained with the newly rebranded Benetton Formula, which proceeded to hire a new crop of talent, including Flavio Briatore and Ross Brawn. Led by Michael Schumacher, the Benetton team won two Drivers&#x27; Championships and one Constructors&#x27; Championship in the 1990s. Schumacher took Byrne and Brawn with him to Ferrari, and the two helped lead the turn-of-the-century Ferrari dynasty. Symonds and Briatore stayed with Benetton, which was later renamed to Renault (colloquially, &quot;Team Enstone&quot; after Benetton opened a new factory in Enstone, Oxfordshire). With new star Fernando Alonso, Renault won two Drivers&#x27; Championships and two Constructors&#x27; Championships in the 2000s.

The original Toleman leadership (Toleman and Hawkridge) did not compete in Formula One again. Ted Toleman left England in 1993, but intermittently remained involved in motor racing, managing the Australian Mini Challenge one make series. Alex Hawkridge eventually chaired a company that used racing simulators to coach aspiring drivers.

<doc id="1262642" wikidata="Q1078831" url="?curid=1262642" title="Trojan–Tauranac Racing">
<text>Trojan was an automobile manufacturer and a Formula One constructor, in conjunction with Australian Ron Tauranac, from the United Kingdom.

The car producer Trojan Limited was founded by Leslie Hounsfield in 1914 in Clapham, South London, and later in Purley Way, Croydon, Surrey. It produced cars and especially delivery vans until 1964.

Around 1960, the Trojan business was sold to Peter Agg who imported Lambretta scooters for the British market. In 1962, the rights to manufacture the Heinkel microcar were acquired and the production line was moved from Dundalk, Ireland to Croydon. Production then commenced, renaming the bubble car as &quot;Trojan Cabin Cruiser&quot;. Production continued until 1965, when some 6,000 cars had been produced. Speaking to &quot;Motor Cycle&quot; magazine in 1965 after cessation of production, Peter Agg confirmed that a 1962 British government reduction in purchase tax from 50% to 25% aligning car taxation with three-wheelers and motorbikes, had given a big boost to the cheaper end of the car market, adversely affecting sales of the economy-sector three-wheeler, making continued production uneconomical.

Also in 1962, Trojan acquired the Elva sports car business and started to make the Mk IV Elva Courier. This in turn led to the manufacturing of McLaren racing cars until vehicle production finally ceased in the early 1970s. Trojan Limited still exists as an independent company though the factory was sold in the 1970s.

The Trojan T101 Formula 5000 model met with success when Jody Scheckter won the 1973 SCCA L&amp;M Championship driving a T101 and a Lola T330.

They participated in eight grands prix, entering a total of eight cars. In 1974, David Purley won the Brighton Speed Trials driving a Trojan-Chevrolet T101. While Formula One remained the major series, sports cars were also fashionable on either side of the Atlantic. The McLaren M1 was put into production by Peter Agg&#x27;s Lambretta Trojan Group in Rye, Sussex. They would make 200 McLarens during ten years.

<doc id="1262645" wikidata="Q7207464" url="?curid=1262645" title="Poetic diction">
<text>Poetic diction is the term used to refer to the linguistic style, the vocabulary, and the metaphors used in the writing of poetry. In the Western tradition, all these elements were thought of as properly different in poetry and prose up to the time of the Romantic revolution, when William Wordsworth challenged the distinction in his Romantic manifesto, the Preface to the second (1800) edition of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; (1798). Wordsworth proposed that a &quot;language near to the language of men&quot; was as appropriate for poetry as it was for prose. This idea was very influential, though more in theory than practice: a special &quot;poetic&quot; vocabulary and mode of metaphor persisted in 19th century poetry. It was deplored by the Modernist poets of the 20th century, who again proposed that there is no such thing as a &quot;prosaic&quot; word unsuitable for poetry.

==Greece and Rome==
 In some languages, &quot;poetic diction&quot; is quite a literal dialect use. In Classical Greek literature, for example, certain linguistic dialects were seen as appropriate for certain types of poetry. Thus, tragedy and history would employ different Greek dialects. In Latin, poetic diction involved not only a vocabulary somewhat uncommon in everyday speech, but syntax and inflections rarely seen elsewhere. Thus, the diction employed by Horace and Ovid will differ from that used by Julius Caesar, both in terms of word choice and in terms of word form.

The first writer to discuss poetic diction in the Western tradition was Aristotle (384 BC—322 BC). In his &quot;Poetics&quot;, he stated that the perfect style for writing poetry was one that was clear without meanness. He went on to define meanness of style as the deliberate avoidance of unusual words. He also warned against over-reliance on strange words:

==Germanic languages==
Germanic languages developed their own form of poetic diction. In Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse, poetry often involved exceptionally compressed metaphors called &quot;kennings&quot;, such as &quot;whale-road&quot; for &quot;the sea&quot;, or &quot;sword-weather&quot; for &quot;battle&quot;. Also, poetry often contained riddles (e.g. the &quot;Gnomic Verses&quot; in Anglo-Saxon). Therefore, the order of words for poetry as well as the choice of words reflected a greater tendency to combine words to form metaphor.

In Iceland, Snorri Sturluson wrote the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, a.k.a. the &quot;Younger Edda&quot; around 1200 A.D., partially to explain the older &quot;Edda&quot; and poetic diction. Half of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, the Skáldskaparmál (&quot;language of poetry creation&quot; or &quot;creative language of poets&quot;), is a manual of traditional Icelandic poetic diction, containing a list of kennings. The list is systematized so as to function as a practical thesaurus for the use of poets wishing to write in the genuine old manner, and structured as an FAQ. Snorri gives traditional examples and also opens the way for creating correct new kennings:

In Britain the distinctively Germanic spirit of Anglo Saxon prosody placed particular emphasis on elaborate, decorative and controlled use of strongly ornate language, such as in consistent and sustained alliteration, as exemplified by the anonymous Pearl Poet of North-West England. In Scotland this spirit continued through to the renaissance so that in Middle Scots diction the 15th and 16th century Makars achieved a rich and varied blend of characteristically Germanic Anglic features with newer Latinate and aureate language and principles.

==Asia==
In Japanese poetry, the rules for writing traditional haiku require that each poem include a reference to a specific season. For the renga linked-verse form from which haiku derived, the rules specify that certain stanzas should have seasonal references. In both cases, such references are achieved by inclusion of a kigo (season word). Japanese poets regularly use a &quot;Saijiki&quot;, a kigo dictionary that contains lists of season words, organized by season, together with examples of haiku using those kigo.

==In English==
In English, poetic diction has taken multiple forms, but it generally mirrors the habits of Classical literature. Highly metaphoric adjective use, for example, can, through catachresis, become a common &quot;poetic&quot; word (e.g. the &quot;rosy-fingered dawn&quot; found in Homer, when translated into English, allows the &quot;rose fingered&quot; to be taken from its Homeric context and used generally to refer not to fingers, but to a person as being dawn-like). In the 16th century, Edmund Spenser (and, later, others) sought to find an appropriate language for the Epic in English, a language that would be as separate from commonplace English as Homeric Greek was from koine. Spenser found it in the intentional use of archaisms. (This approach was rejected by John Milton, who sought to make his epic out of blank verse, feeling that common language in blank verse was more majestic than difficult words in complex rhymes.) William Wordsworth also believed in using the language of the common man to portray a certain image and display his message. In the Preface to the Lyrical Ballads, Wordsworth says &quot;I have proposed to myself to imitate, and as far as possible, to adopt, the very language of men.&quot;

In the 18th century, pastoral and lyric poetry both developed a somewhat specialized vocabulary and poetic diction. The common elision within words (&quot;howe&#x27;er&quot; and &quot;howsome,&quot; e.g.) were not merely graphical. As Paul Fussell and others have pointed out, these elisions were intended to be read aloud exactly as printed. Therefore, these elisions effectively created words that existed only in poetry. Further, the 18th century saw a renewed interest in Classical poetry, and thus poets began to test language for &quot;decorum.&quot; A word in a poem needed to be not merely accurate, but also fitting for the given poetic form. Pastoral, lyric, and philosophical poetry was scrutinized for the right type of vocabulary as well as the most meaningful. Joseph Addison and Richard Steele discussed poetic diction in &quot;The Spectator,&quot; and Alexander Pope satirized inappropriate poetic diction in his 1727 &quot;Peri Bathos.&quot;

 The Romantics explicitly rejected the use of poetic diction, a term which William Wordsworth uses pejoratively in the 1802 &quot;Preface to Lyrical Ballads&quot;:
In an appendix, &quot;By what is usually called poetic diction&quot;, Wordsworth goes on to define the poetic diction he rejects as above all characterized by heightened and unusual words and especially by &quot;a mechanical adoption of... figures of speech, ... sometimes with propriety, but much more frequently applied... to feelings and ideas with which they had no natural connection whatsoever&quot;. The reason that a special poetic diction remote from prose usage gives pleasure to readers, suggests Wordsworth, is &quot;its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the Poet&#x27;s character, and in flattering the Reader&#x27;s self-love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character.&quot; As an extreme example of the mechanical use of conventionally &quot;poetic&quot; metaphors, Wordsworth quotes an 18th-century metrical paraphrase of a passage from the Old Testament:

&quot;From this hubbub of words&quot;, comments Wordsworth, &quot;pass to the original... &#x27;How long wilt thou sleep, O Sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep. So shall thy poverty come as one that travaileth, and thy want as an armed man.&#x27;&quot; (Proverbs, vii, 6)

At the same time, Wordsworth with Coleridge had an interest in the archaisms found in the border regions of England and introduced dialect into their poetry. While such language was &quot;unnatural&quot; to the London readership, Wordsworth was careful to point out that he was using it not for an exotic or elevated effect, but as a sample of the contemporary &quot;language of men&quot;, specifically the language of poor, uneducated country folk. On the other hand, the later Romantic poet John Keats had a new interest in the poetry of Spenser and in the &quot;ancient English&quot; bards, and so his language was often quite elevated and archaic.

Modernism, on the other hand, rejected specialized poetic diction altogether and without reservation. Ezra Pound, in his Imagist essay/manifesto &quot;A Few Don&#x27;ts&quot; (1913) warned against using superfluous words, especially adjectives (compare the use of adjectives in the 18th-century poem quoted above) and also advised the avoidance of abstractions, stating his belief that &#x27;the natural object is always the &quot;adequate&quot; symbol&#x27;. Since the Modernists, poetry has approached all words as inherently interesting, and some schools of poetry after the Modernists (Minimalism and Plain language, in particular) have insisted on making diction itself the subject of poetry.

<text>Scarab was an American sports car and open-wheel race car constructor from the United States featuring cars designed and built by Tom Barnes and Dick Troutman for Reventlow Automobiles Inc, owned by Lance Reventlow. The Chevrolet 283 CI V-8 engines were built by Traco Engineering (Jim Travers and Frank Coon, nicknamed &quot;The Whiz Kids&quot;).
==History==
Troutman and Barnes built sports cars for amateur road racing in the USA in the 1950s. Chuck Daigh drove the Scarab sports car to victory in the 1958 Riverside International Grand Prix, beating a field of international factory teams including famous race car driver Phil Hill and the Ferrari Team. The Scarabs won the SCCA National Championship in 1958 and two of the cars were sold in 1959 while Reventlow&#x27;s race car (the only left hand drive car) was converted for his personal use on the street. Carroll Shelby drove one of the Scarab sports cars to victory at Continental Divide Raceways in Castle Rock, Colorado, setting a new course record.
Scarab made an ill-fated entry into Formula One during the 1960 season with front-engined cars which by then were nearly obsolete. The engines in these front-engined cars were 4-cylinder units similar in layout to the Offenhauser, but entirely of Scarab&#x27;s own design penned by Leo Goossen of Offenhauser, and later Meyer-Drake fame. They featured desmodromic valve gear similar in design to that found on the Mercedes F1 engine of the 1950s and were built and maintained by Travers and Coon. The engines were the shortcoming of the team as the desmodromic gear could not cope with the large amount of movement in the engine block and would consistently pull the valves too far closed resulting in valve failure. Scarab participated in five Grands Prix, entering a total of nine cars. Reventlow and his chief mechanic Chuck Daigh drove the blue and white liveried cars. Both Scarabs were entered in the Grands Prix of Monaco (where they suffered hydraulic brake fluid aeration problems and did not qualify for the race), Holland, Belgium, and France (where both Daigh and Ginther experienced oil starvation issues resulting in burnt bearings), while only Daigh&#x27;s car was entered in the final race of the 1960 F1 season, the American Grand Prix at Riverside, California (the Scarabs&#x27; home track). Daigh finished because he had to keep the engine RPM under 6000 to prevent fuel delivery problems (vapor lock) on the hot southern California day and, in doing so, did not encounter the mysterious oil starvation issue that occurred closer to 7000 RPM that had plagued the Scarabs previously. Daigh, while entered in the Dutch Grand Prix, did not race due to qualification/appearance payment issues.

==International Formula Racing==

The following year Chuck Daigh went on to pilot one of the Scarabs in International Formula racing in Europe powered by the Offenhauser, Indy style, engine where he finished eighth, at Goodwood vying for the Lavant Cup, and finished seventh in a bid for the International Trophy. This was a third front engine car, originally built for the F1 effort. Before the season was out Daigh crashed badly at a race in England where the car was destroyed and left in Europe.

Scarab built one rear engine car for the 1962 season, powered by a Buick aluminum V-8 with Phil Remington fabricated intake and exhaust manifolds. However, the final FIA engine rules made the necessary engine modifications illegal and the car was never raced in Europe. Daigh raced this car only once, in the 1962 Sandown International Cup, a Formula Libre race at Sandown Park in Australia. He finished fourth after an epic battle with Stirling Moss where the Buick-engined Scarab was faster on the straights and Moss&#x27;s car would overtake in the corners. The Buick engine was sold by the team (Warren Olsen team manager) before returning to the USA.

==The last Scarab car==
Finally, a mid-engined two-seat sports car was built. They put another Buick V8 engine in this car and Reventlow wanted to test it on the streets of Los Angeles. So, he went to the California Department of Motor Vehicles and (after installing a muffler) managed to get license plates for this all-out racing car. He personally raced the car (without muffler) three times and his best finish was second at Santa Barbara.

Reventlow was planning on closing down the Scarab operation so he sold this little sports racing car to John Mecom Jr. of Houston, Texas. Mecom installed a Traco-built 327 Chevy engine and put A.J. Foyt in the car. Foyt&#x27;s best result was winning a pair of races at Nassau, Bahamas during 1963. Walt Hansgen won the 1964 Bridgehampton 500 in the car while it was Chevrolet powered. Augie Pabst purchased the car and was still the owner as of 2013.

<doc id="1262658" wikidata="Q173485" url="?curid=1262658" title="Aston Butterworth">
<text>Aston Butterworth was a Formula Two constructor from the United Kingdom, which competed in the seasons and when the World Drivers&#x27; Championship was run to Formula Two regulations. The team participated in four World Championship Grands Prix.

The project was instigated by Bill Aston, who decided to build a car for Formula Two. The chassis was a copy of a Formula Two Cooper, fitted with a flat-four engine devised by Archie Butterworth. The car made its debut in April 1952 in the Lavant Cup at Goodwood, finishing eighth with Aston at the wheel. In May, a second car was added, driven by Robin Montgomerie-Charrington, who achieved the team&#x27;s best finish, a third place at Chimay in June. This car was designated &quot;NB42&quot; and as of May 2015 was in its original specification.

Aston entered the car, fitted with Allard-Steyr cylinder heads and a new carburettor, in the 1952 German Grand Prix. He withdrew on lap two after losing oil pressure. Aston continued to appear in races throughout the 1953 season, but there was never enough money to develop the program properly. A major problem was the supply of fuel - the Aston Butterworth sometimes had fuel starvation, and sometimes caught on fire. When the new F1 regulations came in , Aston-Butterworth ceased participating.

<doc id="1262673" wikidata="Q193724" url="?curid=1262673" title="Slavkov u Brna">
<text>Slavkov u Brna (; ) is a town in Vyškov District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 7,200 inhabitants. The town gave its name to the Battle of Austerlitz, which took place several kilometres west of the town. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Etymology==
The German name (and the former Czech name ) is derived from Latin (&#x27;new settlement&#x27;), which has gradually evolved over history through the names (1237), (1322), (1343), (1460) and (1611). The current Czech name is derived from the name Slávek (a colloquial name for Bohuslav), who probably owned a manor house here. This name was first documented in 1361. In 1918, Slavkov was renamed Slavkov u Brna (&#x27;Slavkov near Brno&#x27;) to distinguish from other places with the same name.

==Geography==
Slavkov u Brna is located about east of Brno. It is situated on the border of three geomorphological regions: the northeastern part of the municipal territory lies in the Litenčice Hills, the northwestern part lies in the Dyje–Svratka Valley and the southern part extends into the Ždánice Forest. The highest point is the hill Urban at above sea level. The Litava River flows through the town.

==History==

At the end of the 12th century, Margrave Vladislaus III gave the area to the Teutonic Order. The first written mention of Slavkov is from 1237 in a deed of Wenceslaus I. It was originally a market village with a fortified stronghold and a church, located at the crossroads of trade routes. The Teutonic Order founded a commandery here.

From 1396 to 1407, Slavkov was held by Jobst of Moravia. In 1407, it was returned to the Teutonic Order, but after the defeat of the Order in the Battle of Grunwald, Slavkov was confiscated from them in 1411.

In the 14th century, a Jewish ghetto was established near the commandery. The merger of the Christian and Jewish communities created a strong economic agglomeration, which was promoted to a town by King Wenceslaus IV in 1416. The town was strongly fortified and had four gates.

The town often changed owners until 1509, when the noble family of Kaunitz assumed control for more than 400 years. They made it the main seat of the family.

On 2 December 1805, Napoleonic France fought against the Austrian and Russian forces near the town through the Battle of Austerlitz, the &quot;Grandee Armée&quot; gained victory in the battle, dissoluting the Holy Roman Empire.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
The I/50 road (part of the European route E50), which connects the D1 motorway near Brno with Uherské Hradiště and the Czech–Slovak border, passes through the town.

Slavkov u Brna is located on the railway line Brno–Uherské Hradiště.

==Sights==
On the site of the old fortress was built a Renaissance residence at the end of the 16th century. The Slavkov Castle was rebuilt to the current Baroque form by Italian architect Domenico Martinelli in the 1680s. It belongs to the oldest preserved noble residences in Moravia. In its historic salon, an armistice was signed between Austria and France after the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805. There is a small museum and a multimedia presentation about the battle. The castle includes a French formal garden, part of which was simplified into an English park.

The landmarks of the town square are the late Renaissance town hall from 1592 and a mansion. Remains of the town walls from the 14th and 15th centuries have been preserved to this day. They are about high.

The Church of the Resurrection of the Lord is a late Baroque and Neoclassical building, built in 1786–1789. It has three pulpits. The church was designed by Johann Ferdinand Hetzendorf of Hohenberg.

The Chapel of Saint John the Baptist is a cemetery chapel, located on the site of a hospital from the 13th century. Its current appearance is from 1743. Beneath the chapel is a vault with the Kaunitz family tomb.

Chapel of Saint Urban on the Urban Hill was built by design of Domenico Martinelli in 1712. It was badly damaged during the Battle of Austerlitz and had to be rebuilt in 1858–1861.

Only the synagogue built in 1858 remains from the Jewish ghetto. There is also a Jewish cemetery.

==Legacy==
Much in the same way that in London, the English have named Waterloo Station to commemorate their victory at Waterloo, the French gave the name of Austerlitz to one of the major Parisian train stations, the Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz, the neighbouring bridge Pont d&#x27;Austerlitz, and the waterfront Quai d&#x27;Austerlitz. In the Netherlands, a village named Austerlitz was founded in commemoration of the battle, as was a small town of Austerlitz, New York.

==Notable people==
*Abraham Aberle (1811–1841), poet and translator
*František Koláček (1851–1913), physicist
*Peregrin Obdržálek (1825–1891), Catholic priest, writer and humorist
*Lubomír Tesáček (1957–2011), athlete

Austerlitz is a Jewish family name, of which the bearers are nowadays spread worldwide but which indicate and ultimate family origin in the town. The dancer Fred Astaire was born &quot;Fred Austerlitz&quot;, and thus it could be assumed that his ancestors lived in this town.

<text>Adam Kuhn (28 November 1741 – 5 July 1817) was an American physician and naturalist, and one of the earliest professors of medicine in a North American university. 

==Formative years==
Kuhn was born in Germantown, Province of Pennsylvania, a son of German immigrant parents. He studied medicine under his father, Dr. Adam Simon Kuhn. Then he went to Sweden and studied medicine and natural history 1761–1764 at Uppsala University, where he studied with Carl Linnaeus. Linnaeus named a flower in Kuhn&#x27;s honor: &quot;Kuhnia eupatoriodes&quot;. He continued his studies at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated as M.D. in June 1767, and published his thesis, &quot;De Lavatione frigida&quot; (&#x27;About cold baths&#x27;).

==Medical career==
Returning to America, he practiced as a physician in Philadelphia and was 1768–1789 professor of Materia medica and 1789–1797 of the Theory and Practice of Medicine at the Medical School of the College of Philadelphia (later the University of Pennsylvania), founded in 1765 as the first faculty of Medicine in the thirteen colonies. Concurrently, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1768 where he served as its curator from 1769-1770 and 1771-1772.

Kuhn was a physician of the Pennsylvania Hospital from May 1775, until January 1798. He was one of the founders of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia in 1787, and was its president from July 1808 until his death. His students included Valentine Seaman, who mapped yellow fever mortality patterns in New York and introduced the smallpox vaccine to the United States in 1799.

Benjamin Rush wrote in his autobiography that Kuhn, after the death of Dr John Jones in June 1791, was considered the leading physician in Philadelphia and the one favored by &quot;the principal officers of the general government&quot;. He treated &quot;Washington Custes&quot; (George Washington Custis, the son of Washington&#x27;s stepson, see Martha Washington) and functioned as the family physician of George Washington. There is, however, no evidence that he actually treated the President.

<text>The Paris Marathon () is an annual marathon hosted by the city of Paris, France. It is the largest running event in France in terms of finishers and is typically among the five largest marathons in the world.

The marathon begins along the Champs-Élysées, runs southeast through the city to the Bois de Vincennes, heads back through the city along the River Seine, and finishes on Avenue Foch.

== History ==

=== Tour de Paris era ===
The first Paris Marathon, the Tour de Paris Marathon, took place in 1896. A big crowd gathered to watch 191 participants. It was run over a course of from Paris to Conflans-Sainte-Honorine via Versailles, and the organisers decided to award a commemorative medal to all runners who finished the race in less than 4 hours.

The distance of 40 km was chosen as it was the distance separating Marathon from Athens. The current distance of the race is 42.195 km, which the IAAF established in 1921 as the standard length of a marathon, following the 1908 Olympic race in London.

This first race was won by Len Hurst from England who crossed the finishing line in 2 hours, 31 minutes and 30 seconds. His prize money was 200 francs.

Some sources, including the Association of Road Racing Statisticians, consider Frenchwoman Marie-Louise Ledru as the first female to race the now-defined marathon distance of 42.195 km, as she set a time of 5 hours and 40 minutes during the 1918 edition of the Tour de Paris, while other sources, including the International Association of Athletics Federations, credits Violet Piercy as the first to do so.

=== Current era ===

The present Paris Marathon dates from 1976. It is normally held on a Sunday in April and is limited to 50,000 runners. It is organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation. It is notable for the attractive route through the heart of the city of Paris.

Unlike most other marathons, but like all races in France, the Paris Marathon requires a doctor&#x27;s note no more than a year old, stating that there is &quot;no contraindication to competitive running&quot;.

In 2024, the Paris Marathon had 53,899 finishers. This set a new world record for the largest marathon in the world - exceeding the previous record at the 2019 New York City Marathon. The record was short-lived, though, as the 2024 Berlin Marathon exceeded that number with 54,154 finishers six months later in September.

== Course ==

The race starts on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées going downhill to circle round the Place de la Concorde before turning right onto Rue de Rivoli. The route passes the Louvre, then goes round the Place de la Bastille, and down Boulevard Soult to the Bois de Vincennes. A long loop of the Bois de Vincennes returns the route into the heart of Paris. The halfway point is reached at Rue de Charenton. The route now follows the course of the Seine, passing Île de la Cité and going under the Pont Neuf, then a series of tunnels. There is a large drinks station and foot massage site at Trocadéro, opposite the Eiffel Tower. The route continues along the Seine, before branching off east to eventually pass through Bois de Boulogne, emerging for the final 200 metres and the finish on the Avenue Foch.

Corcoran was born on December 27, 1798, in Georgetown in Washington, D.C., one of 12 children (six boys and six girls), six of whom survived to maturity. His father was Thomas Corcoran, a well-to-do merchant twice elected as mayor of Georgetown, and his mother was Hannah Lemmon. Thomas was born in Ireland, settled in Georgetown in 1788, and established a leather business.

William Corcoran was raised in Georgetown, where he studied classics and mathematics at local private schools run by Alexander Kirk and the Reverend Addison Belt. He attended classes for a year at Georgetown College, and then joined the family business.

==Career==
Corcoran entered business at age 17, working in dry goods store owned by two brothers and opened his own branch store two years later. The Corcoran brothers established a wholesale auction and commission business, but their ventures failed after the Panic of 1819. 

He worked in another family business, and in 1828, he took control of a large amount of real estate from his father.

Corcoran was employed as a clerk at the Bank of Columbia at Georgetown branch, and then as a real estate and loan manager at the Second Bank of the United States in Washington.

In 1837, Corcoran established a brokerage firm on Pennsylvania Avenue at 15th Street. He was successful and in 1840 entered into a partnership with George Washington Riggs, a son of Elisha Riggs. The Corcoran and Riggs private banking firm enjoyed the patronage of Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury and prospered after it re-sold to investors $5 million (~$ in ) of US Treasury notes in 1843. In 1845, it purchased the former Second Bank of the United States building located on 15th Street at New York Avenue.

In Spring 1847, Corcoran and Riggs sold to investors at home and abroad the bulk of two issues of the US Treasury Mexican War bonds; Corcoran&#x27;s earnings were $1 million. In 1854, Corcoran retired from Corcoran and Riggs to focus on his investments in real estate, land grants, armaments, railroads, as well as pursue pleasure and philanthropic endeavors.

===Art===

In contrast to many contemporary art patrons, Corcoran was not exclusively interested in European works, and he assembled one of the first important collections of American art.

In 1851 Corcoran purchased the second marble version of American sculptor Hiram Powers scandalous statue &quot;The Greek Slave&quot; and considered it his most prized acquisition. By the mid-1850s his pictures and sculpture were overflowing his mansion on Lafayette Square and in 1859 he hired the foremost architect of the day, James Renwick, to build a picture gallery in the Second Empire style on Pennsylvania Avenue.

Before the gallery was ready, however, the Civil War began, and Corcoran, a Southern sympathizer, left Washington for Paris, where his son-in-law, George Eustis Jr., was a representative of the Confederacy. The half-finished building designed by Renwick was taken over by the US government and used as a supply depot. 

When the war was over, Corcoran returned to Washington. The building was finished in 1869. The Corcoran Gallery of Art opened in 1874, but the structure was soon outgrown. A new building for the Corcoran Gallery of Art and its nascent school of art (now the Corcoran College of Art + Design) was designed by American architect Ernest Flagg in the Beaux-Arts style and completed in 1897, nine years after Corcoran&#x27;s death. The façade of the building reflects the &quot;Neo-Grec,&quot; an offshoot of Beaux-Arts that attempted to reflect the functions of the building by revealing detailed and decorative accents on the exterior. The Corcoran Gallery&#x27;s first home is now the Renwick Gallery, a Smithsonian museum.

===Philanthropy===
In 1854, after his retirement, he devoted himself and his substantial fortune to art and philanthropy. In 1848, Corcoran had purchased 15 acres (6 ha) of land for Oak Hill Cemetery, which overlooks Rock Creek Park. He organized the Oak Hill Cemetery Company to oversee the cemetery, which was formally incorporated by Act of Congress on March 3, 1849. Corcoran paid for the construction of a Gothic Revival chapel in Oak Hill Cemetery, commonly known as the Renwick Chapel. It is the only building designed by Renwick in Washington other than Corcoran&#x27;s original museum (see below), the first (&quot;Castle&quot;) building on the Washington Mall of the Smithsonian Institution, and St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Foggy Bottom (see below). 

Corcoran also established a $10,000 fund, administered by the Benevolent Society, to purchase firewood for the poor in Georgetown. Corcoran also gave many gifts to several universities, including The George Washington University, the Maryland Agricultural College, the College of William and Mary, and Washington and Lee University. Corcoran also contributed to a fund to purchase George Washington&#x27;s Mount Vernon estate, after his family could no longer keep it up, and the federal government refused to purchase it. One of William Wilson Corcoran&#x27;s longtime business associate and friend was the renowned George Peabody.

Corcoran made many other important bequests to the people of Washington, including several departments of the Columbian University (now the George Washington University), and the land and half the construction costs for what is now the Church of the Ascension and Saint Agnes. Corcoran was also the President of the Corporation of Columbian (George Washington) University. Early in 1883, Corcoran arranged to have the body of John Howard Payne returned to the United States, an expense he personally bore. Payne, actor, poet, and author of &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot; had been the United States Consul to the Bey of Tunis in 1852 and had died there. Payne had been good friends of Corcoran and his business partner, George W. Riggs, in 1850, prior to Payne&#x27;s second appointment as Consul to Tunis.

Corcoran also established in 1869 the Louise Home for Women—named in memory of his deceased wife—to help support and maintain impoverished women. The home opened in 1871 on Massachusetts Ave. NW, between 15th and 16th Streets, in Washington, D.C., where it operated until 1947; the original building was razed in 1949. The Louise Home moved to the Codman House at Decatur Place and 22nd Street NW and in 1976 merged operations with the Abraham and Laura Lisner Home for Aged Women. the Louise Home continues to operate as part of the Lisner-Louise-Dickson-Hurt Home.

===Slavery===
Corcoran held at least one person, Mary, as a slave. In the 1930s, George Peabody referred to Corcoran as being involved in the slave trade. However, in at least one letter to his wife, Corcoran expressed sympathy for abolitionists, and in 1845 he manumated Mary and her four young children. In 1851, Corcoran provided funds to help buy the freedom of an enslaved person who had been recaptured eight years after first escaping slavery.

==Personal life==
At the age of 35, he fell in love with Louise Morris, who was the daughter of Commodore Charles Morris (1784–1856) and the older sister of Robert Murray Morris (1824–1896), then &quot;barely in her teens&quot;. In 1835, Corcoran eloped and married Louise, born in 1818. Before his wife&#x27;s early death from tuberculosis on November 21, 1840, they had three children, however, only one survived into adulthood:
* Harriet Louise Corcoran (1836–1837), who died in infancy.
* Louise Morris Corcoran (1838–1867), who married George Eustis, Jr. (1828–1872) in 1859.
* Charles Morris Corcoran (1840–1841), who also died in infancy.

Corcoran joined the Potomac Lodge No. 5 of Free and Accepted Masons in Georgetown and was raised as a Master Mason on July 26, 1827.

==Death==

After his wife died in 1840, Corcoran chose not to marry again. He died on February 24, 1888, in Washington, D.C., and is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery.

===Descendants===
Through his surviving daughter Louise, he was the grandfather of William Corcoran Eustis (1862–1921) and Louise Marie Eustis Hitchcock (1867–1934), who married Thomas Hitchcock (1860–1941), in 1891.

Corcoran&#x27;s niece, Mrs. S. Charles Hill, founded the Washington Home for Incurables.

===Legacy===
The bank Corcoran co-founded in 1840 existed as Riggs Bank up until 2005, when it was taken over by PNC Bank. The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. was one of the oldest American private museums focusing on American art until it was dissolved in 2014 with its art collections given to the National Gallery of Art and the building (including art school) transferred to George Washington University in Washington, DC. Corcoran has a street named after him in the Dupont Circle neighborhood in the District of Columbia between Q street and R street NW, one block away from Riggs Street. Furthermore, he has a street in northeast Washington, DC in the Ivy City neighborhood. As well, the Corcoran neighborhood in Minneapolis, Minnesota which is bounded by East Lake Street to the north, East 36th Street to the south, Hiawatha Avenue to the east, and Cedar Avenue to the west, is named for William Corcoran. Mount Corcoran in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California is named in his honor.

<doc id="1262707" wikidata="Q2294133" url="?curid=1262707" title="Emblems of the Soviet Republics">
<text>The [[emblem]]s of the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republics]] of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] all featured predominantly the hammer and sickle and the red star that symbolized communism, as well as a rising sun (although in the case of the Latvian SSR, since the Baltic Sea is west of Latvia, it could be interpreted as a setting sun), surrounded by a wreath of wheat (except the Karelo-Finnish SSR with a wreath of rye). The USSR State motto, &quot;Workers of the world, unite!&quot;, in both the republic&#x27;s language and Russian was also placed on each one of them. In addition to those repetitive motifs, emblems of many Soviet republics also included features that were characteristic of their local landscapes, economies or cultures. 

The emblems are often called coats of arms, but since they (deliberately) did not follow the rules of heraldry, most of them cannot be considered coats of arms. However, they all did follow the same basic pattern, a pattern which sometimes has led to the use of the term &quot;socialist heraldry&quot;. 

The table below presents final versions of the renderings of the Soviet republics&#x27; emblems prior to the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, as well as the arms of two republics that ceased to exist before that time. For comparison, national arms of present-day successor states of the Soviet republics are also shown. As can be seen, most Asian post-Soviet republics use arms based on or reminiscent of the Soviet-era emblems, with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have present-day arms nearly identical to the Soviet one. Most European republics, on the other hand, reverted to their traditional pre-Soviet heraldic arms. Belarus used the traditional Pahonia as its coat of arms from 1991 to 1995 when it was replaced by a new emblem closely resembling the Soviet-era design. Additionally, the secessionist Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria), internationally recognised as part of Moldova, uses an emblem based on the emblem of the Moldavian SSR (see Coat of arms of Transnistria) and the self-proclaimed Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic, controlling part of the Luhansk Oblast in Ukraine, created the similar emblem.

<text>Sekula Drljević (; 7 September 1884 – 10 November 1945) was a Montenegrin nationalist, Yugoslav jurist, politician, orator, and theoretician. During World War II, he became a collaborator with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and cooperated with the Ustaše in the German puppet state of Croatia.

Born in the town of Kolašin, he earned a doctorate degree in law and became the Minister of Justice and Finance in the Kingdom of Montenegro before the outbreak of World War I. During the interwar period, he was a leading member of the &quot;Greens&quot;, a Montenegrin nationalist and separatist movement. A proponent of the theory that Montenegrins were an ethnic group distinct from Serbs, he also founded and became the leader of the Montenegrin Federalist Party.

Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Drljević began cooperating with the Italian authorities occupying Montenegro. In July, he proclaimed the reestablishment of the Kingdom of Montenegro, but his attempt to establish an Axis-aligned puppet state triggered an immediate uprising. That September, Italian authorities sent him to an internment camp in Italy after the outbreak of an anti-fascist revolt. Drljević escaped the camp several months later and made his way into the German-held half of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). In the summer of 1944, he created the Montenegrin State Council in Zagreb.

Drljević moved back to Montenegro in 1945 and agreed to the formation of the Montenegrin National Army with Chetnik commander Pavle Đurišić. Đurišić and several other Chetnik commanders were later ambushed and killed on behalf of Drljević and the NDH. Đurišić&#x27;s men later joined Drljević&#x27;s Montenegrin National Army and withdrew with him towards the Austrian border. In mid-1945, Drljević crossed over into Austria with his wife, and the two ended up in a camp for displaced persons in Judenburg, where they were killed by Chetnik agents seeking to avenge Đurišić&#x27;s death.

==Early life and political career==
Sekula Drljević was born on 7 September 1884 in the village of Ravno, near the town of Kolašin. Having finished law school in Zagreb and earned a doctorate degree, he became the Minister of Justice and Finance in the Kingdom of Montenegro in 1910. His brother Janko Drljević was at that time an MP from the loyalist True People&#x27;s Party. Drljević also became an MP, and also served as a minister in King Nikola&#x27;s cabinet during the Balkan Wars (1912–13), and was renowned for his rhetorical skills.

During World War I, he was captured by Austro-Hungarian forces and interned at the Boldagason internment camp in Hungary, where he grew strongly opposed to King Nikola. He was released after the war and moved to Zemun and worked as a lawyer there. He became a leading member of the &quot;Greens&quot; (&quot;zelenaši&quot;), a Montenegrin separatist movement which sided with the Yugoslav Federalist Party. During this time, he cooperated frequently with Croatian politicians such as Stjepan Radić, Vlatko Maček, and Ante Pavelić, with whom he became good friends. In the mid-1920s, Drljević founded the Montenegrin Federalist Party. He quickly became the party&#x27;s sole leader and foremost theoretician.

He expressed support for the unity of Yugoslavia and stressed Montenegro&#x27;s loyalty to Serbian nationhood, but argued that a nation did not necessarily need to be part of a single state and hinted that he would support the restoration of Montenegro&#x27;s independence. Consequently, the &quot;Greens&quot; demanded that Yugoslavia&#x27;s internal boundaries be organized to match the borders of the Balkan states as they were prior to 1918.

Drljević and Mihailo Ivanović had first attempted to found the Montenegrin Party for the 1920 election of a Constitutional Assembly, but were unable to do so due to a lack of time and resistance by the authorities. Drljević ran unsuccessfully for the Montenegrin Federalist Party in the 1923 elections in both the counties of Nikšić and Kolašin. He ran again in Kolašin in 1925 and was elected to the National Assembly. In 1927, Drljević was elected representative of the Zemun District on the electoral list of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS). Afterwards, he helped solve a political rift between Radić and Serb politician Svetozar Pribićević, resulting in the formation of an HSS–Democratic Party coalition. The following year, Drljević unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade Radić from attending the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes prior to his assassination by Serb politician Puniša Račić.

==World War II==

===Montenegrin leader===
On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia. Montenegro was invaded by the forces of Germany and Italy, with the Germans attacking from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Italians from Albania. The Germans later withdrew, leaving the Italians to occupy the area. In the western portion of Yugoslavia, Pavelić, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, was appointed &quot;Poglavnik&quot; (leader) of an Ustaše-led Croatian state – the Independent State of Croatia (, &quot;NDH&quot;). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an &quot;Italian-German quasi-protectorate&quot;. NDH authorities, led by the Ustaše Militia, subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Romani population living within the borders of the new state.

The creation of an Axis puppet-state known as the Kingdom of Montenegro was proclaimed on 12 July 1941. The state was to be headed by an Italian regent and led by Drljević and his supporters. By 13 July, this proclamation prompted the outbreak of an anti-Italian uprising in Montenegro led by local communists (Partisans) and Serb nationalists (Chetniks). Having assumed power the previous day, Drljević established the Provisional Administrative Committee of Montenegro, a collaborationist entity which was a territorial component of the Italian Empire. He also organized his followers to fight against Montenegrin Chetniks and the Yugoslav Partisans. In September, he was dismissed from office by the Italians.

Believing his life was endangered by the revolt, they sent him to an internment camp in Italy. The idea of an independent Montenegro was abandoned, and the Italians opted for a military governorate. Several months later, Drljević escaped and smuggled himself into the German-controlled area of the NDH. With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, he moved back to Zemun. In the summer of 1944 Drljević relocated to Zagreb, where he created a Montenegrin State Council in the NDH with the assistance of the Germans and Croats. He also published a pamphlet in Zagreb titled &quot;Who are the Serbs?&quot; (). In it, he blamed supposedly &quot;aggressive&quot; Serb policies for all past and modern problems in the Balkans, presented ethnic Serbs as a &quot;degenerate race&quot; and pointed out their similarities with Jews.

Following the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, Drljević had become a proponent of the theory that Montenegrins were an ethnic group distinct from Serbs. As early as 1921, he had stated that Serbian and Montenegrin &quot;mentalities&quot; were diametrically opposed. He stated: &quot;The mentalities of Serbians and Montenegrins are irreconcilable. The visage of the former was speckled with [Ottoman] slavery; liberty gave the latter a new visage.&quot; It was not until 1941 that Drljević advanced the notion that Montenegrins were not Slavs at all, but Dinaric people descended from the ancient Illyrians. He wrote:Races are communities of blood, whereas people are creatures of history. With their language, the Montenegrin people belong to the Slavic linguistic community. By their blood, however, they belong [to the Dinaric peoples]. According to the contemporary science of European races, [Dinaric] peoples are descended from the Illyrians. Hence, not just the kinship, but the identity of certain cultural forms among the Dinaric peoples, all the way from Albanians to South Tyroleans, who are Germanized Illyrians.

===Retreat and death===
In the spring of 1945, Drljević visited parts of Montenegro held by the Chetniks of Pavle Đurišić. It was here that Đurišić made a safe-conduct agreement with Drljević and with elements of the Armed Forces of the NDH. Although the details of the agreement are unknown, it appears to have been agreed that Đurišić and his men were to move into the NDH and cross the Sava River into Slavonia where they would be aligned with Drljević as the Montenegrin National Army, with Đurišić retaining operational command. Suspicious of Drljević&#x27;s intentions, Đurišić tried to outwit him and his forces by sending only his sick and wounded across the Sava, keeping his fit troops south of the river. Following his defeat at the Battle of Lijevče Field, north of Banja Luka, and the defection of one of his sub-units to Drljević, Đurišić was forced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his units towards Slovenia. This appears to have been a trap, as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting. On 17 April 1945, after he returned to Zagreb, Drljević issued a proclamation with his political program and invited his &quot;army&quot; to fight both new Yugoslavia and Chetniks of Draža Mihailović. On 20 April, Đurišić, Petar Baćović, Dragiša Vasić and Zaharije Ostojić were taken to the Stara Gradiška prison, near Jasenovac.

The Ustaše gathered them in a field alongside 5,000 other Chetnik prisoners and arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non-combatant intellectuals for execution. Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected. They and the others were loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River, where they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself or in a nearby marsh. Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić. Drljević was opposed to Đurišić&#x27;s support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljević&#x27;s separatism. Left without a leader, the majority of Đurišić&#x27;s men were integrated into Drljević&#x27;s Montenegrin National Army and withdrew with him towards the Austrian border.

In the second half of May, the troops of the Montenegrin National Army surrendered to the British and were quickly turned back into Yugoslavia and into the hands of the communists. Drljević managed to evade capture, and he and his wife sought refuge at a camp for displaced persons in the Austrian town of Judenburg. On 10 November 1945, three of Đurišić&#x27;s followers discovered them there and murdered them by slitting their throats.

==Legacy==
In 1944, Drljević rearranged the lyrics of the Montenegrin patriotic song &quot;Oj, svijetla majska zoro&quot; to celebrate the creation of the Montenegrin puppet regime that had been established in July 1941. He was declared a war criminal at the Nuremberg Trials in 1946. When &quot;Oj, svijetla majska zoro&quot; was chosen as the national anthem of Montenegro in 2006 with Drljević&#x27;s additions intact, many Montenegrin antifascists protested the selection due to its fascist connotations.

<text>Candy is a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand from a screenplay by Buck Henry, based on the 1958 novel of the same name by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg, itself based on Voltaire&#x27;s 1759 novel &quot;Candide&quot;. The film satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It stars Charles Aznavour, Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, James Coburn, John Huston, Walter Matthau and Ringo Starr. Popular figures, such as Sugar Ray Robinson, Anita Pallenberg, Florinda Bolkan, Marilù Tolo, Nicoletta Machiavelli, Umberto Orsini and Enrico Maria Salerno also appear in cameo roles.

==Plot==
While in her father&#x27;s social sciences class, high school student Candy Christian awakens from a daydream in which she seemingly descends to Earth from space. Following a poetry recital at Candy&#x27;s school, eccentric Welsh poet MacPhisto offers her a ride home in his limousine. En route, MacPhisto forces himself on her but is unable to proceed after becoming too inebriated. With the help of her Mexican gardener Emmanuel, Candy takes MacPhisto inside to help him out of his liquor-soaked clothes. In the basement, MacPhisto drunkenly recites poetry while humping a mannequin, inciting Emmanuel to sexually assault Candy. Scandalized on walking in on the scene, Candy&#x27;s uptight father decides to send her to live with his twin brother Jack and his wife Livia in New York City.

At the airport, the family is accosted by Emmanuel&#x27;s three vengeful sisters, who accuse Candy of corrupting their brother. During the scuffle, Candy&#x27;s father is rendered unconscious due to a head injury. The Christians escape by boarding a military plane commanded by General Smight. In exchange for a blood transfusion for her father, General Smight orders Candy to undress, intending to impregnate her. Meanwhile, he accidentally pushes the button that signals his paratroopers to leap from the plane. Realizing this, General Smight jumps as well, but slips out of his parachute harness.

After landing in New York, Dr. Krankheit meticulously performs surgery on Candy&#x27;s father in front of an audience. When Uncle Jack attempts to seduce Candy during a post-operative cocktail party, the hospital&#x27;s executive director, Dr. Dunlap, berates her for her perceived lewd behavior, causing her to faint. Dr. Krankheit takes Candy to another room and tricks her into sex by pretending to examine her. While searching for her father, Candy wanders back into the operating room to find that Dr. Krankeit has branded all the nurses with his initials as he prepares to do the same to Livia. When he attempts to have Candy captured so that she is next, she flees the hospital.

Roaming the streets of Manhattan, Candy ends up in a Sicilian bar in Greenwich Village, where she is beset by a group of mobsters. An offbeat underground filmmaker, Jonathan J. John, takes her into the men&#x27;s room and records her for a film. As the room floods due to broken pipes, two policemen arrive and assault Jonathan, whereupon a drenched Candy escapes.

In Central Park, Candy meets a hunchback who takes her into a deserted mansion that night. A gang of thieves walk in and ransack the place, while the hunchback rapes Candy atop a grand piano. After arresting Candy, the two policemen maliciously plan to frisk her. However, they lose control of their squad car and crash into a club full of drag queens. As mayhem ensues, Candy escapes again.

The next morning, Candy hitches a ride in the back of a semi-trailer truck, which turns out to be the sanctum of Grindl, a sham guru. He teaches her the &quot;seven stages of enlightenment&quot; as a pretext to have sex with her. After several days on the road, Grindl informs Candy that a different guru will guide her through the rest of her journey. On arrival in California, Candy is chased through the desert by the New York police officers, but she manages to outwit them.

Shortly thereafter, Candy finds her new guru: a robed figure with a toucan on his shoulder, his face covered with white clay. She follows him into an underground Hindu temple, which partially collapses due to a cataclysm. As the two proceed to have sex, the guru&#x27;s face is washed clean, and Candy is shocked to discover that he is actually her brain-damaged father.

As Candy wanders across a field—surrounded by flapping banners and hippies playing music—she revisits many of the characters whom she met throughout the film before finally returning to outer space.

==Production==
The novel was a best seller. According to Terry Southern, the original plan was for David Picker to produce and Frank Perry to direct with Hayley Mills to play Candy. However, Mills&#x27; father, John Mills refused to give permission. Then film rights came into the hands of actor Christian Macquand. Macquand managed to persuade his friend Marlon Brando to play a role (Macquand had recently helped Brando purchase an island in Tahiti). This attracted Richard Burton and other stars, which enabled Macquand to raise finance through ABC Films.

Southern said Macquand &quot;disappointed me by casting a Swedish girl [Ewa Aulin] for the lead role, which was uniquely American and midwestern. He thought this would make Candy&#x27;s appeal more universal. That&#x27;s when I withdrew from the film.&quot; Marquand arranged for Buck Henry to write the script.

The stars were paid $50,000 a week with Burton, Brando, Starr and James Coburn getting a percentage of the profits. Coburn said, &quot;That film could have been a lot more funny. Unfortunately, the director&#x27;s timing was of a European nature. The jokes were always a beat behind. They were often a beat off. When you do comedy, you&#x27;ve got to be fast. I think [star] Ewa Aulin only did two films after &quot;Candy&quot;. Then she married an Italian count or baron. That was also the only film that I made any money on. I had a percentage of the profits. Marlon Brando and Richard Burton had the same deal. It&#x27;s very unusual for an actor to see anything extra. Of course, that was before the studios set up their Chinese bookkeeping system (laughs).&quot;

Regarding the scene where Grindl attempts to seduce Candy, production manager Gray Frederickson said that Brando actually tried to have actual sex with Aulin on camera.

Southern later observed, &quot;The film version of &quot;Candy&quot; is proof positive of everything rotten you ever heard about major studio production. They are absolutely compelled to botch everything original to the extent that it is no longer even vaguely recognizable.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Candy&quot; was one of many psychedelic films that emerged as the 1960s ended, along with others, such as &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, &quot;The Trip&quot;, &quot;Psych-Out&quot; and &quot;Head&quot;. The film opened to moderate box-office success, but later became a cult classic from the psychedelic years.

It was the 18th highest-grossing film of 1968. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film earned North American rentals of $7.3 million, but because of costs (including over $1 million paid out in participation fees), recorded an overall loss of $25,000. It was the 12th most popular film at the UK box office in 1969.

===Critical response===
Reviews were generally positive with a few misgivings. In a review representative of most professional reviewers at the time, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; found it &quot;a lot better than you might expect&quot;, but missed the &quot;anarchy, the abandon, of Terry Southern&#x27;s novel&quot;.

Renata Adler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; decried &quot;its relentless, crawling, bloody lack of talent&quot;.

John Simon of &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;If you know someone you want to start the new year as nauseated as possible, send him to see &quot;Candy&quot;.&quot;

Pauline Kael wrote that the film, &quot;keeps getting worse than seems possible... a shambles of a sex spoof, and though it sticks fairly closely to the book, which was an erotic satire, it isn’t erotic.&quot;

&quot;Filmink&quot; called Coburn &quot;one of the best things about the movie.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40%, based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10.

===Accolades===
In 1969, the film earned Aulin a nomination for New Star of the Year – Actress at the 26th Golden Globe Awards.

==Home media==
&quot;Candy&quot; was released by Anchor Bay on April 10, 2001, as a region 1 widescreen DVD, and was released on Blu-ray by Kino Lorber on May 17, 2016, as a region A widescreen.

<doc id="1262727" wikidata="Q652294" url="?curid=1262727" title="Golden Gate Quartet">
<text>The Golden Gate Quartet (a.k.a. The Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet) is an American vocal group. It was formed in 1934 and, with changes in membership, remains active.

==Origins and early career==
The group was founded as the Golden Gate Jubilee Singers in 1934, by four students at Booker T. Washington High School in Norfolk, Virginia. According to the group&#x27;s website, the original members were Willie Johnson (baritone; d. 1980), William Langford (tenor; d. 1970), Henry Owens (second tenor; d. 1970) and Orlandus Wilson (bass; 1917–1998); other sources state that Langford and Wilson replaced earlier members Robert &quot;Peg&quot; Ford and A.C. &quot;Eddie&quot; Griffin in 1935.

From 1935, the group sang in churches and on local radio, gaining a regular spot on radio station WIS in Columbia, South Carolina in 1936. They began as a traditional jubilee quartet, combining the clever arrangements associated with barbershop quartets with rhythms borrowed from the blues and jazz like scat singing. They developed a broad repertoire of styles – from Owens&#x27; mournful, understated approach in songs such as &quot;Anyhow&quot; or &quot;Hush, Somebody&#x27;s Calling My Name&quot;, to the group&#x27;s highly syncopated arrangements in &quot;Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego&quot;. Like The Mills Brothers in popular music, they would often include vocal special effects in their songs, imitating train sounds in songs such as &quot;Golden Gate Gospel Train&quot;. Langford often sang lead, using his ability to range from baritone to falsetto, while Johnson narrated in a hip syncopated style that became the hallmark for the group. Wilson&#x27;s bass served as the anchor for the group and Owens harmonized with Langford and Johnson.

In 1937, they moved to station WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina, and soon afterwards won a contract with Bluebird Records. After their first recording session on August 14, 1937, in which they recorded 14 songs in two hours, they were contracted to record 12 tracks per year. In 1938, they were recruited by John Hammond to appear at the first &quot;From Spirituals To Swing&quot; concert held at Carnegie Hall in New York City, after which their popularity grew. An example of their output during this popular period includes a 1938 recording of &#x27;John the Revelator&#x27; being inducted into the National Recording Registry in 2005. They stayed in New York and were signed up for a residency at the Cafe Society nightclub. As well as performing and recording gospel songs they also recorded some secular songs for RCA Records, who were intending to bill them as &quot;The Four Chocolate Bars&quot;, but the recordings were not released. In 1939, William Langford left the group to form a new group, the Southern Sons; he was replaced by Clyde Riddick (1913–1999).

==The 1940s and 1950s==
In 1940, the group signed a new contract with Columbia Records&#x27; subsidiary Okeh label, and shortened their name to the Golden Gate Quartet. They soon had a nationwide radio program and the opportunity to sing at Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s inauguration in 1941, becoming the first black musical group to sing at Constitution Hall and later performing several times at the White House. They continued to be popular during World War Two, making several appearances in Hollywood films and singing secular music, including some unique popular front songs such as &quot;Stalin Wasn&#x27;t Stallin&#x27;&quot; that mixed humor with political commentary. The Quartet appeared in films such as &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot; (1942), &quot;Hit Parade of 1943&quot; (1943), &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944), and the Danny Kaye film &quot;A Song Is Born&quot; (1948). In the latter film, they performed the songs &quot;Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho&quot; and part of &quot;A Song Is Born&quot; with Louis Armstrong and Virginia Mayo.

Johnson was called into the US Navy in 1943, followed by Wilson in 1944; they were temporarily replaced by Cliff Givens – who later left to join firstly The Ink Spots and then Billy Ward and His Dominoes – and Alton Bradley. The group moved first to the main Columbia record label and then, in 1948, to Mercury Records. Johnson left in 1948 to join The Jubalaires, and was replaced by Orville Brooks (1919–1997).

The quartet lost their pre-eminent position in gospel music after the war, when they faced competition from the newer hard gospel quartets. They continued in their old style, offering sharper political commentary in songs such as &quot;God&#x27;s Gonna Cut You Down&quot;, but losing much of their audience to quartets such as the Dixie Hummingbirds and the Soul Stirrers. Henry Owens left in 1950 to become a preacher and solo artist. Alton Bradley returned to replace him, but then left in 1952 when he was replaced by Eugene Mumford (1925–1977), previously of The Larks.

The Golden Gates revived their career in 1955, however, when they toured Europe for the first time, where they became widely popular. The group moved to Paris in 1959 and has continued touring, primarily in Europe, since then. During his stint in the US Army, in Germany, Elvis Presley, who was a huge admirer of their work since his early childhood, visited them backstage at Le Casino in Paris, and stayed to watch their entire show, staying also with them at the hotel Prince de Galles. Presley recorded a version of their popular &quot;Swing Down Chariot&quot; that appeared on his &quot;His Hand in Mine&quot; gospel album. During this time, there were further personnel changes: Orville Brooks left and was replaced by Franck Todd and later in turn by Caleb Ginyard (1910–1978), and Eugene Mumford was replaced by Clyde Wright (born May 1, 1928, Charlotte, North Carolina).

Since the 1950s, the group has been primarily based in Europe. They toured widely in the late 1950s, including US State Department-sponsored tours around the world. In 1959, the group started a two-year residency at the Casino de Paris.

==Later activities==
The group made their first tour of Africa in 1962, and during the early 1960s gradually expanded their accompanying band to incorporate guitar, piano, bass and drums. Through the 1960s they toured widely in Europe, with a long-established line-up of Orlandus Wilson, Clyde Riddick, Caleb Ginyard, and Clyde Wright. In 1971, Ginyard and Wright left, and were replaced by Paul Brembly (the great-nephew of Orlandus Wilson) and Calvin Williams. Wright returned to the group in 1985 to replace Williams, who returned to the US.

Bill &quot;Willie&quot; Johnson worked with Eugene Mumford and Cliff Givens in his own version of The Golden Gate Quartet in the late &#x27;70s out of the Los Angeles area, most notably appearing on Ry Cooder&#x27;s &quot;Jazz&quot; album, and appearing with Cooder in his 1978 &quot;Soundstage&quot; performance, with Givens, Pico Payne, and Jimmy Adams (though Johnson didn&#x27;t use the group name in these particular appearances).

The group undertook a 60th anniversary world tour in 1994. Riddick remained with the group until his retirement in 1995, and Wilson, the last surviving member of the original group, until his death in 1998. Riddick was replaced by Frank Davis. Wright was replaced by Charles West (Nephew to Wilson) of Portsmouth, VA. The position of bass singer has in recent years been filled by Thierry Fred François, Richard Phillips, and, since 2005, by Anthony Gordon.

==Recognition==
In his 1978 album &quot;&quot;, musician Michel Jonasz used excerpts from their recording of &quot;Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho&quot; to mix into the song &quot;Golden Gate&quot;.

The Golden Gate Quartet was inducted into The Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998.

A sample of the group&#x27;s recording of &quot;Jezebel&quot; would serve as the basis for the Recoil song of the same name, appearing on their 2000 album &quot;Liquid&quot;.

In his 2011 album &quot;So Beautiful or So What&quot;, musician Paul Simon used excerpts from their 1938 recording of &quot;Golden Gate Gospel Train&quot; to mix into the song &quot;Love &amp; Blessings&quot;. In addition, the group&#x27;s music was also featured in the video game &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Barrow Raiders are a semi-professional rugby league team in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England. The club play home games at Craven Park and compete in the Championship, the second tier of British rugby league.

Barrow have never won the League Championship, their only major honour being winning the Challenge Cup in 1955.

Traditionally the club&#x27;s home colours are blue and white and main rivals are fellow semi-professional Cumbrian teams Whitehaven and Workington Town.

==History==
===Early years===

Barrow Football Club was formed in 1875 and played its first home game on 4 December of that year against the Royal Grammar School, Lancaster, at Cavendish Park on Barrow Island, then home to the town&#x27;s cricket club. It is thought that Tom H. Baynes, a shipping clerk, was the driving force behind the club&#x27;s foundation. As well as being a player, he was probably also the first Barrow team coach. Early practice matches games were played in &quot;a field loaned by a local farmer&quot; as well as the Parade Ground and the aforementioned Cavendish Park.

At the 1883 annual general meeting, Cavendish Park got the vote over the Parade Ground as a permanent home on account of its better playing surface. The first grandstand there was erected in 1893, and another one in 1893.

In April 1897, the team switched from rugby union to rugby league following a unanimous vote at the club. Barrow joined the Second Division of the Lancashire Senior Competition and became champions in their first season. They lost a test match against Morecambe, the bottom club in the First Division, however, and failed to gain promotion. They were eventually promoted at the end of the 1899–1900 season, by defeating Tyldesley in the test match.

In 1908, the club nearly doubled their attendance record to 12,000 in a third round Challenge Cup match against Hunslet.

In 1914, Cavendish Park was requisitioned by the authorities for the war effort. Barrow moved to Little Park, Roose, three miles from the centre of town. The first match there was a 31–2 victory over Bramley. The league at this time was suspended and clubs were forced to arrange their own fixtures in an unofficial war league. Boosted by an influx of players and spectators into the local shipyards for war production, Barrow became one of the dominant teams of the war period, winning the unofficial championship title in 1917–18 losing just twice in 22 matches.

=== Interwar Period and move to Craven Park ===

After World War I, Barrow had mixed fortunes and when the league resumed in 1919–20, they managed to finish fifth. However, over the next decade, despite having several county and national players, Barrow&#x27;s form suffered and its league position was poor.

In 1929, it had been realised that rugby league in Barrow was approaching a precarious period, as the attendances at Little Park were gradually decreasing. This was in part due to industrial depression but also Little Park&#x27;s location. The directors made an appeal to the town, and approached the mayor, Alderman John Whinnerah who was to be an ardent supporter. Commander G. W. Craven, a local war hero, started an appeal fund with a donation of £500. In a short time the club bought a central site, where the Jute Works stood for £2,500. Craven Park was built in 1931, largely as a result of the efforts of supporters, 500 of whom volunteered to construct the ground. The total cost of the building project came to £7,500 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £1,251,000 in 2013).

1937–38 saw Barrow reach the finals of the Lancashire County Cup for the first time, losing narrowly 4–8 to Warrington. That season was a time of great opportunity for the Barrow team but was to end in disappointment. After playing seven matches in just ten days, they lost 7–4 to Salford in the final of the Challenge Cup at Wembley; they also lost in the Championship play-off semi-final 13–7 against Hunslet. A new attendance record was set in that season – 21,651 in the Good Friday game against Salford. The Club had traditionally worn black and red, but for much of the 1937–38 cup campaigns they wore an alternative kit of blue and white which subsequently become the home colours of the club.

===Post Second World War===
Barrow dropped out of the wartime Lancashire league in 1940–41, they did not return to league competition until 1945–46. As many of the pre-war players had retired, this was an era of rebuilding and recruiting.

The 1950s were the club&#x27;s heyday. The team was captained by Willie Horne and Barrow appeared no less than three times at Wembley. On 5 May 1951, Barrow made their second appearance at Wembley and were beaten 10–0 by Wigan. On Saturday 27 October 1951 13,319 spectators were at Barrow to watch the home side beat New Zealand 9–5. On 30 April 1955, Barrow made their third appearance at Wembley. This time, they won the Challenge Cup 21–12 against Workington Town, later that year they added the Lancashire Cup after a 12–2 win over Oldham.

On 11 May 1957, Barrow played again in the Challenge Cup final at Wembley against Leeds and were narrowly beaten 9–7. 1957 signalled the end of the golden era of the club and most of the star players retired after this time.

The league split into two divisions in 1961–62 and because of a poor finish in the previous season, Barrow was forced to play in the second division.

In 1963, Jim Challinor moved to Barrow and became their player-coach.

Their last appearance at Wembley Stadium was in 1967, where they were strongly tipped to win the Challenge Cup final again, but were beaten by Featherstone Rovers 17–12. A crowd of 77,000 paid a then record £54,435 to watch the game (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £1,625,000 in 2013).

1973 saw Barrow appoint former player, Frank Foster, as coach. He built a side which won the Second Division championship in 1975–76 and reached a John Player Trophy final in 1981 only to lose 5–12 to Warrington. Phil Hogan was transferred to Hull Kingston Rovers in 1978 for a then world record fee of £33,000 (based on increases in average increases, this would be approximately £249,700 in 2013).

Barrow fluctuated between divisions but had three consecutive years in the top flight between 1980 and 1983. Frank Foster was eventually replaced by Tommy Dawes in 1983.

The season 1983–84 saw Barrow win the Second Division title and the Lancashire Cup against favourites Widnes 12–8. The entire Barrow team was inducted into the Barrow Hall of Fame in 2003. Tommy Dawes, despite his initial success, was sacked in 1985.

In 1988–89, Australian Rod Reddy took on a player-coach role at Barrow in 1987. Barrow earned promotion to Division One but that campaign saw Barrow manage only one league win and suffer a club record 90–0 defeat at Leeds. Reddy was sacked and Denis Jackson took over as a caretaker coach for the rest of 1989–90.

After relegation in 1990, Barrow appointed a new coach in Steve Norton but finished 17th out of 21 in Division Two.

===Summer era===
In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season. When the Super League competition had been proposed, part of the deal was that some traditional clubs would merge. Barrow were down to merge with Whitehaven, Workington Town and Carlisle to form a new club called Cumbria based in Workington which would compete in the Super League but ultimately this did not happen and Barrow were not part of the new competition.

Until 1995 the team was simply titled Barrow RLFC, but they adopted the nickname Barrow Braves to coincide with rugby league&#x27;s switch to a summer season. Peter Roe was head coach for a 15-month period, ending in January 1996.

=== Barrow Border Raiders (1997–2002) ===
In 1997 they merged with Cumbrian rivals Carlisle to form Barrow Border Raiders. Carlisle&#x27;s Paul Charlton became coach of the new team. The new team played all its matches in Barrow; the merger was essentially a financial arrangement only. Barrow enjoyed mixed fortunes under Paul Charlton with two top-ten finishes in the Northern Ford Premiership in 1999 and 2000, before the club&#x27;s fortunes took a turn for the worse in the 2001 season, which resulted in Paul Charlton not being offered a new contract.Eskdale &amp; Liddesdale Advertiser | Charlo bids for Barrow return In 2002, the Border part of the name, which was never particularly relevant to South Cumbria-based Barrow, was dropped.

=== Barrow Raiders (2002–2010) ===
Under Peter Roe&#x27;s second spell at Craven Park, they were National League Two champions in 2004, their first trophy for 20 years. They were promoted to National League One. However, they were relegated back to National League Two at the end of the 2005 season after winning just one of their 18 matches. The financial situation at the club forced a review of the coaching structure and the position of head coach was made part-time and the club parted company with Peter Roe. In October 2005, local ex-player Paul Crarey was appointed as head coach. In his first season as coach of the Raiders he guided them to the National League Two play-offs on a very limited budget. After the end of the 2007 season, Paul Crarey controversially resigned from Barrow Raiders, after guiding them to a second successive play-off position.

Barrow had initially lined up former Widnes coach Steve McCormack to take over until he received an offer of a position with Super League club Hull KR. On Thursday 2 November 2007 Barrow Raiders announced that former player Welsh-born Aussie Dave Clarke would take over, with Dean Marwood as his assistant. On 23 August 2008, Raiders gained automatic promotion from National League Two by beating Swinton 12–32 to clinch second place in National League Two.

On 5 April 2009, a crowd of 6275 watched Barrow play Super League club Wigan in the best attended match in recent years. Barrow held out but were eventually defeated 32–20. On 21 July Despite the club being 2nd in the league and having made the Northern Rail Cup Final coach Dave Clarke stepped down and became assistant to new head coach Steve Deakin.

On 31 August 2009, after just 6 weeks in charge, Steve Deakin left the club and Dave Clarke reclaimed the head coach role, leading the club to the 2009 Co-Op Championship league leaders trophy and a grand final appearance versus Halifax. In the 2009 Co-Op Championship Grand Final, a 77th minute try settled the game and Barrow beat Halifax 26–18 to claim the Championship title..

Barrow finished fourth in 2010 with coach Steve McCormack leaving the club to take up a teaching post. After a lengthy search for a new coach, Barrow appointed Garry Schofield.

=== 2011 season and relegation to Championship 1 ===
Barrow&#x27;s application to join the then franchised Super League, after their Championship Grand Final win in 2009, was rejected early in the 2011 season as it was deemed the club did not the meet minimum requirements.

Head Coach Schofield was sacked as coach after only five games in 2011 and his assistant Nigel Wright was appointed in his place. With 6 games to go in July Barrow sacked Nigel Wright and appointed former player Dave Clarke as their manager for the rest of the season.

==== Rule breaches and RFL charges ====
The on-field problems were matched by off-field difficulties, with the club accused of breaking salary cap rules. A 6-point deduction due to salary cap breaches in the 2010 season, ended any play off hope. At a tribunal in October 2011, claims that the club &quot;systematically breached&quot; the following three rules were upheld.

* Rule C.1.1.7 – failing to record in player contracts all financial benefits or benefits in kind that a player is receiving;
* Rule C.1.1.11 – no club or club official shall loan money or goods or make payment or provide any benefit in kind to a player unless they are recorded in the player&#x27;s contract;
* Rule D1.8 (f) – misconduct by committing a breach of Championship Salary Cap Regulations.

Their chairman, Des Johnston was banned from any involvement with Rugby League for 8 years and 29 points were deducted for the 2011 season, relegating them to the Co-operative Championship 1.

=== 2012–2017 ===
Success in Championship 1 during 2012 meant that Barrow were promoted directly back up to the Championship the following year. Unable to compete, and after narrowly avoiding relegation in 2013, they were once again relegated at the end of the 2014 season.

At the end of the 2014 season Paul Crarey was re-appointed head coach, replacing Bobbie Goulding. The former player had previously coached the team between 2005 and 2007.

The team strengthened on the field during three consecutive seasons in, the now renamed League 1 with improving table finishes (2015: 7th) (2016: 5th) (2017: 3rd)

On 27 May 2017, Barrow won the League 1 Cup after defeating North Wales Crusaders 38–32 at Bloomfield Road as an opener to the Summer Bash weekend. At the end of the 2017 season, Barrow secured promotion back to the Championship with a 10–6 play-off win against 2nd place Cumbrian rivals Whitehaven.

=== Return to the Championship (2018–2019) ===
Barrow achieved a better than expected start to the 2018 season with strong results on the field including holding League favourites Toronto to a draw. However, the club faced significant financial issues. For the second time in just over 5 years, chairman David Sharpe announced significant short term cash flow issues. Steve Neale replaced Sharpe as chairman stating that there was a &quot;bright future for the club&quot; after raising short term funds. Barrow finished their inaugural Championship season in 10th place avoiding risk of relegation.

The following season, Barrow were once again relegated to the RFL League 1 after a 68–2 defeat against Toronto Wolfpack on 1 September 2019.

=== Back in League 1 (2020–2021) ===

After relegation from the Championship in 2019, Barrow started their return to life in League 1 with a 32–22 victory over Doncaster on 1 March 2020.

On 16 March the structure and timing of the competition was placed in doubt as all rugby league games were suspended until 3 April at least as part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The suspension of the season was extended to indefinite.

A discussion between the RFL and club officials in May saw seven of the 11 clubs reject a suggestion that the season could recommence with games being played behind closed doors. The RFL board met on 20 July and having consulted with the League 1 clubs decided to abandon the 2020 season as the majority of clubs did not support playing behind closed doors. At the date of suspension only two rounds of matches had been played and the season was declared &quot;null and void&quot;.

=== Championship return (2021–) ===
In the 2021 RFL League 1 season, Barrow finished top of the table and were promoted back to the Championship. On the final game of the season, against West Wales Raiders, Barrow won 76–0 after West Wales fielded a team which included several debutant players rather than forfeit the match for a 24–0 loss, though either result would have been enough to secure automatic promotion.

In the 2022 RFL Championship season, Barrow surprised many by finishing 4th on the table and qualifying for the playoffs. The club were eliminated in the first week of the playoffs by Batley.

== Grounds ==

=== Previous grounds (1875–1931) ===
Barrow played their first match in 1875 at Cavendish Park on Barrow Island, the then home of Barrow Cricket Club. The park had two suitable playing areas and until 1883 the new club used the Parade Ground, but then moved to the Athletic Ground as it had a better playing surface for rugby. A first grandstand was built in 1887 for the princely sum of less than £50 to the landlords, The Furness Railway Company. Another grandstand on the opposite side was finished in 1893. On 28 March 1908 a crowd of 12,000 crammed into the ground for a Challenge Cup tie against Hunslet. In 1914 the club decided to move away to Little Park in nearby Roose. In 1920, the club bought Little Park from Lord Richard Cavendish for £3,000 and in the following years put up two grandstands in 1921 and 1924. A record crowd of 12,214 was recorded against Oldham RLFC in a Challenge Cup game on 17 March 1923. Cavendish Park and the Parade Ground is now home to a fire station while the Athletic Ground is still used as community playing fields. Little Park was developed for housing.

=== Craven Park (1931–present day) ===

In 1928, the club&#x27;s committee started to look for a site nearer to the town and found an area on Craven Park. After tipping more than 40,000 tons of fill onto the site previously a derelict Jute Works, reservoirs, railway tracks and mission hall the club moved their main stand from Little Park and built a new stand on Clive Street and officially moved in, in August 1931.

On 15 April 1938, the club&#x27;s record attendance was established when 21,651 saw them play Salford. In February 1949, storms ripped the entire roof off the main stand and in the early 1950s concrete terracing replaced the old wooden railway sleepers. Floodlights were turned on in November 1966. The ground was renovated in 1991.

In 2015, the roof was removed from the terrace adjacent to Willie Horne Way. This was followed in 2021 with the removal of the condemned Hindpool Road end roof, leaving only two areas of cover in the ground. Plans were also unveiled for a marquee on the terrace next to the main stand.

<text>Cidade Negra () is a Brazilian reggae band formed in 1986 in Rio de Janeiro. Their style is influenced by soul and rock music. Common themes of Cidade Negra songs include love and social issues.

== History ==
The band reached success in 1991, with the album &quot;Lute pra Viver&quot; (Fight to Live), including the radio hit &quot;Falar a Verdade&quot;. Ras Bernardo was the first vocalist.

Garrido at the time was the vocalist of Banda Bel. He entered in Cidade Negra after their second album, in 1993.

Formed in Baixada Fluminense, the band has placed hits in soap operas, like the frustrated remake of &quot;Irmãos Coragem&quot;, broadcast in Rede Globo in 1995.

In 2002, Cidade Negra recorded their first acoustic record, on MTV Brasil. &quot;Acústico MTV: Cidade Negra&quot; contained another radio hit, &quot;Girassol&quot;. In this year, Garrido was presenter of two editions of Globo-Endemol&#x27;s reality show &quot;Fama&quot; with Angélica.

In 2005, the group was nominated for Brazilian VMAs (VMB), for best video by viewers choice (&quot;Perto de Deus&quot;). They lost it to CPM 22&#x27;s &quot;Um Minuto para o Fim do Mundo&quot;. In 2006, celebrating twenty years of career, the group released the DVD &quot;Direto&quot;.

In 2007 Sony BMG did not renew their contract with the band, who soon found EMI Music to launch its newest project then the CD and DVD: &quot;Diversão&quot;, recorded at the Teatro Popular - Niterói, on August 16, 2007, released by the band. In April 2008, Toni Garrido announced his exit from the Cidade Negra, after fourteen years on the road.

In June 2008, Garrido undertook his last concert in the Festa Estadual do Leite Presidente Getúlio, Santa Catarina, on May 31. On June 13, Cidade Negra announced the new singer: Alexandre Massau, from Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, ex-singer of Berimbrown and Preto Massa. On July 29, the group made its debut in the Festival de Inverno of Santos Dumont/MG.

Tony Garrido returned to the band on 24 January 2011.

Cidade Negra is currently recording a new CD.

<text>Halfdan Cleve born Halfdan Klewe (5 October 1879 – 6 April 1951) was a Norwegian composer, and father of the pianist and composer Cissi Cleve.

== Biography ==
Cleve was born and raised in Kongsberg, Norway. He lived some time in Germany. Some examples on his output as a composer are piano concertos, other piano works, and some chamber music. He was described as a child prodigy. He married pianist (10 February 1878 – 23 September 1964) and they had four children.

Throughout his early childhood he was tutored with a firm hand by his father, the organist Andreas Johan Julius Klewe (1832–1903). A child prodigy, he made his first appearances on the concert stage at the age of five. The strictness of his training is exemplified by the fact that he was not allowed to play anything other than the works of Johann Sebastian Bach until he was sixteen. For the next three years his musical training was undertaken by Otto Winter-Hjelm, after which he studied in Berlin under and the brothers Xaver and Philipp Scharwenka. In 1902, Cleve debuted his First Piano Concerto in Berlin. That same year, he married Berit Winderen, a student of Teresa Carreño, and made numerous concert appearances together, both in Norway and abroad. Cleve composed five piano concertos, a violin sonata, a piano quintet, songs with orchestral accompaniment and over one hundred piano pieces. In the last period of his life (1926–50), he worked as piano teacher at Music Conservatory in Oslo and died 1951 in Oslo.

<text>West Acton is a London Underground station. It is on the Ealing Broadway branch of the Central line between Ealing Broadway and North Acton stations, and is its only intermediate station in the branch. The station is a Grade II listed building. It is located in West Acton in Travelcard Zone 3. The station is close to North Ealing station on the Piccadilly line, 550 metres away at the western end of Queens Drive.

==History==

As Transport for London explains:

The Great Western Railway (GWR) built the Ealing Broadway branch (the western part of the former Ealing &amp; Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Railway) and opened it for freight trains in April 1917, and the Central London Railway trains used the line from 3 August 1920. West Acton and were built and owned by the GWR, and both opened on 5 November 1923.

GWR steam freight trains also ran through West Acton until 1938, when the London Underground tracks were segregated further east, through East Acton station, and to the west of North Acton station.

The current station, replacing the original building, was designed by the Great Western Railway, on behalf of London Transport, as part of the LPTB&#x27;s 1935-40 New Works Programme improvements and extensions to the Central line. The design was by the GWR&#x27;s architect Brian Lewis and it was completed by November 1940.

==Connections==
London Buses route 218 serves the station.

<doc id="1262755" wikidata="Q4455273" url="?curid=1262755" title="CIÉ 121 Class">
<text>The Córas Iompair Éireann 121 Class was a railway locomotive which was manufactured by General Motors Electro-Motive Division. These locomotives were in regular service on the Irish railway network until 2002, with the last two remaining in service until early 2008.

==History==
The poor availability of the A and C class locomotives in the late 1950s together with the split of the cross-border Great Northern Railway in 1958 and the target to eliminate Steam Locomotives led CIÉ to urgently seek more diesel locomotives, turning to an American-style single cab road switcher design from General Motors. The 121 Class were manufactured from December 1960 to January 1961 and numbered B121 to B135 inclusive. The locomotives proved an immediate success, with low maintenance and high availability, and led to further orders from the same supplier starting with the 141 class.

From the early 1970s onwards several locomotives of this class dropped the &quot;B&quot; prefix from their fleet number when re-liveried. The last two locomotives that survived in traffic (124 and B134) were both withdrawn from service on 3 May 2008. Prior to 1961, almost all Irish diesel locomotives were built in Great Britain, but from the 1960s onwards, GM became the sole supplier of locomotives to CIÉ, which eventually also extended to Northern Ireland Railways locomotives at a later stage. These were EMD&#x27;s first ever fully American-built locomotives delivered to Europe. The layout of the cab was quite different from the other conventional CIÉ diesel models of the time, with the controls to the side of the driver, rather than the front. Due to apparent driver complaints of reduced visibility when operating with cab trailing, it was ultimately decided that these locomotives should only operate in a cab-leading formation. Later conversion for multiple-unit working allowed two 121 class locomotives to be coupled hood-end to hood-end, removing the need to turn them around for their return journey.

Although originally fitted with an EMD 8-567CR engine of , all were later fitted with 645 type &quot;power packs&quot; (piston &amp; liner assemblies) for parts standardisation, while at the same time keeping their original power output for reliability reasons. They weighed and had a maximum speed of . Numbers B126-B129 were later rebuilt with an EMD 8-645E engine of ; as used in the 181 Class locomotives. The engine blocks were originally recycled from withdrawn rebuilt class B201s, but in their later years much swapping of engines occurred between classes 121, 141 and 181.

All but three (B121, B125, and B135) were fitted with Train Door Control equipment for operation with the Inchicore-built, British Rail Mark 3 based, push-pull train units. The push-pull equipment of locomotive B132 was subsequently decommissioned. Entering service in 1989, these trains, consisting of a single 121 Class and up to six carriages, were mainly used on the Dublin northern suburban passenger railway service. These were to be the last regular passenger duties for the 121s within Greater Dublin. The Limerick shuttle continued to be worked by 121s for several years after this date. In 1994, a railcar revolution had begun, and the push pull carriages were later re-deployed to inter-city duties with the 201 Class locomotives.

==Withdrawal==
The first member of the class to be withdrawn was 125 in March 1986 following an electrical fire, though it had been extensively damaged in an accident twelve years previously. However it was not scrapped until 2002.

By 1995, the 201 class had replaced the 121 class on most passenger routes. Throughout the late 1990s the fleet dwindled, and by 2005 only numbers 124 and B134 remained in service, with number 123 in storage for five years until eventually being scrapped in 2008. The rest of the fleet was also scrapped, due to the decline in freight traffic that they were also used for.

Their last official scheduled mainline passenger working was on 9 July 2005 on the Sligo line. The last known passenger working of this class was the 13:15 Waterford-Heuston service on 18 January 2007. Previously, these locomotives had filled in on the Manulla-Ballina service or the occasional service from Limerick.

The last use of them in public service was in the early months of 2008 on maintenance trains. By this stage 124 and 134 were the only survivors. Both were retired by degrees and officially withdrawn in July 2008, though at this stage neither had done much for many weeks.

==Preservation==

The Irish Traction Group has preserved locomotive 124. It is located at Moyasta Junction on the preserved West Clare Railway.

The other surviving member of the class, locomotive B134, is owned by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland (RPSI), and is undergoing restoration. On 19 July 2016 it was hauled by 071 Class locomotive 071 from Inchicore to the RPSI&#x27;s locomotive shed at Dublin Connolly. Later that year it was returned to Inchicore. In 2021 it was given a protective top-coat in older IE grey (per 071 class) with plans for final fitments. On the 7th of May 2022, 134 was displayed at the Inchicore Works during the opening day&#x27;s 175th anniversary - a commemorative plaque was unveiled upon the locomotive, much like 141 Class number 150 during 1996.

The cab of locomotive 133 is preserved at the Cavan &amp; Leitrim Railway in Dromod, County Leitrim.

==Livery==
On delivery, the locomotives were painted in a yellow and grey livery. This was replaced within a year by a black / tan (“golden brown”) colour scheme with a thick white band similar to the Cravens coaching stock, delivered in 1963. With time, the colour scheme changed to tan with a black band. Soon after CIÉ Rail services became known as Irish Rail, the colour scheme was enhanced when two white bands (approx. 25 mm / 1&quot;) separating the colours were added. At the same time, as a safety aspect, self-adhesive high-visibility panels were added to the front of the Locomotives.

==Model==
The 121 Class has been made as a 00 gauge Whitemetal kit by Model Irish Railways.

3D printed bodyshells are available through Shapeways. The 2mm and 3mm versions are by Valve Design, the 4mm one by Rail 3D Prints.

Murphy Models released an &#x27;00&#x27; gauge ready to run model of the 121 class in the 4th quarter of 2020. There are 13 variants covering the periods of CIE, IR and IE plus the RPSI model.

<text>Hinduism is practiced and preached by many Hindu organisations, each of which follows the variants and perspectives of all or particular philosophy propagated and transferred through generations by saints. It is a peaceful religion. Hinduism may be more of a custom or tradition of that part of the world which the great epics of Hinduism are supposed to depict. Hinduism is based on the Vedas, some of which are humanity&#x27;s oldest inscriptions on life and spirituality. They differ on how to achieve life&#x27;s ultimate goal – &quot;Atma Jnana&quot; or self-realization. Devotees can choose any path depending on their individual natures.

<text>Craven Park (also referred to as the Northern Competitions Stadium for sponsorship reasons) is a rugby league stadium in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England. It is the home of Barrow Raiders rugby league team.

==Rugby league==
Craven Park was built in 1931, largely as a result of the efforts of supporters of Barrow RLFC, 500 of whom volunteered to construct the ground. The total cost of the building project came to £7,500; which was a substantial sum in those days.

The stadium was named after Commander G. W. Craven, a local war hero, who had started the appeal fund with a donation of £500.

It should not be confused with Craven Park, or Old Craven Park in Hull, other rugby league venues.
Craven Park was a venue for the 2000 Rugby League World Cup.

As of 2022, the capacity of Craven Park stands at 6,000.

Matches of either Barrow or Cumbria against touring international rugby league sides included:

==Greyhound racing==
Independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) greyhound racing took place around Craven Park from 1932–1933.

<text>Samuel Wright Bodman III (born November 26, 1938 – September 7, 2018) was an American businessman, engineer, and politician who served as the 11th United States Secretary of Energy during the George W. Bush administration, from 2005 to 2009. He was also, at different times, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and the Deputy Secretary of Commerce.

In December 2004, Bodman was nominated to replace Spencer Abraham as the Energy Secretary and was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on January 31, 2005. During his tenure, he oversaw the security problems at Los Alamos National Laboratory and a budget in excess of $23 billion and over 100,000 federal and contractor employees.

==Early life and education==
Bodman was born on November 26, 1938, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Lina (Lindsay) and Samuel Wright Bodman. Bodman spent his early years in the Chicago suburbs before he graduated in 1961 with a Bachelor of Chemical Engineering from Cornell University. He was a member of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity and the Sphinx Head Society.

In 1965, he completed his Doctor of Science in chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

==Career==
Bodman served as an Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and began his work in the financial sector as Technical Director of the American Research and Development Corporation, a venture capital firm.

From there, Bodman went to Fidelity Venture Associates, a division of the Fidelity Investments. In 1983 he was named President and Chief Operating Officer of Fidelity Investments and a Director of the Fidelity Group of Mutual Funds. In 1987, he joined Cabot Corporation, a Boston-based Fortune 300 company with global business activities in specialty chemicals and materials, where he served as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and a Director.

Bodman was a past director of M.I.T.&#x27;s School of Engineering Practice and a onetime member of the M.I.T. Commission on Education. He also was as a member of the Executive and Investment Committees at M.I.T., a member of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences, and a Trustee of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the New England Aquarium.

He was also a past director of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company.

==Bush Administration==

Bodman served as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in the George W. Bush Administration beginning in February 2004. He also served the Bush Administration as the Deputy Secretary of Commerce beginning in 2001.

On December 10, 2004, Bodman was nominated to replace Spencer Abraham as the United States Secretary of Energy and was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on January 31, 2005, taking office the next day. He led the Department of Energy with a budget in excess of $23 billion and over 100,000 federal and contractor employees.

In February 2007, Bodman testified before the United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces about security problems at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He stated that &quot;The heart of the problem is a cultural issue at Los Alamos&quot;. He asserted that the impediment to improved security was &quot;Arrogance. Arrogance of the chemists and physicists and engineers who work at Los Alamos and think they’re above it all&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bodman married M. Diane (Petrella) Barber in 1997. He had three children, two stepchildren, and eight grandchildren.

Bodman died in El Paso on September 7, 2018, at the age of 79. The cause of death was reported to be complications from primary progressive aphasia. His death was announced by former President George W. Bush on the same day.

<text>Andy Hui Chi On (born 12 August 1967) is a Hong Kong singer and actor. Hui is considered one of the most successful Hong Kong singers, with an extensive list of Cantonese and Mandarin hits to his credit.

==Early life==
Hui&#x27;s mother is Vietnamese. He was transferred to Confucian Tai Shing Primary School because his previous school forced him to perform tasks right-handed when he was born left-handed.

==Career==
Hui was the first runner-up in the fifth Annual New Talent Singing Awards in 1986. Hui has appeared in more than 25 films.

His first music contract came in 1986, and his singing career reached stellar status in 2001 as he won awards of the most favourite male singer.

In 2004, Hui was named by Alan Tam as one of the &#x27;New Four Heavenly Kings&#x27; along with Hacken Lee, Leo Ku, and Edmond Leung which would be replacing the once lustrous title awarded to Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, and Leon Lai.

In October 2005, Andy was declared one of Ten Outstanding Young Persons where his hard work on his music and film career, and his excellence in commitment to the community was recognized.

==Personal life==
Hui married singer-actress Sammi Cheng in 2013. Sammi admitted in 2018 that they have never legally registered to marry. They merely attended a friend&#x27;s wedding back in 2013.

On April 16, 2019, a video of Hui being intimate with former HK Pageant contestant and TVB actress Jacqueline Wong during a taxi ride was released. The incident was recorded by the taxi&#x27;s in-vehicle camera. Hui made a public apology to his wife and loved ones, citing he was drunk that night but admitted his intoxication was no excuse for his behaviour. Wong&#x27;s image and career was adversely affected but Hui was able to restart his career and saved his marriage after the scandal.

<text>The CIE 141 Class locomotives were built in 1962 by General Motors Electro Motive Division (EMD) in the United States. Numbered B141 to B177, they were an updated version of the 121 Class locomotives, mechanically very similar but with cabs at each end.

They are EMD model JL8 (J = Double Ended Cabs, L = Lightweight Frame, 8= 8-cylinder 567 engine) and although originally fitted with an EMD 8-567CR engine of , all were later fitted with 645 type &quot;power packs&quot; (piston &amp; liner assemblies) for parts standardisation. The original power output was kept for reliability reasons. They weighed 67 tonnes and had a maximum speed of .

Many of these locomotives were later rebuilt with a GM 8-645E engine of (as used in the re-engined Class C locomotives), though some have since had the original engine refitted. The locomotives were delivered in the CIE livery of brown/black/white.

==Service==
Following crew training trials between Inchicore and Monasterevin (passenger trains), Kildare (goods trains), and Hazelhatch (light engines), the class appeared on main line trials from Amiens Street (Connolly) to Drogheda, and Westland Row (Pearse) to Arklow on Tuesday 4 December 1962, entering traffic on the Dublin to Cork main line four days later. The locomotives were fitted for multiple working and double-headed the 10:40 Dublin to Cork train and the return Cork to Dublin at 15:30. These were the heaviest trains at that time. From Monday 10 December 1962 one locomotive was allocated to the Dublin–Belfast &quot;Enterprise&quot; service.

In later years, regular passenger duties included trains on the Rosslare to Waterford/Limerick lines, until they were superseded by railcars on these duties.

The remaining locomotives, nos. B141, B142, 144, 146, 147, 152, 162, 171, 175 and 177, were withdrawn in February 2010. However, 171 was reinstated for a short time, and was confined to pilot duties in the Dublin area.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On Tuesday 13 August 1974, locomotive B176 was hauling a passenger train when it was involved in a head-on collision with locomotive B192, which was also hauling a passenger train, at . Fifteen people were injured.
*On Friday 5 May 1995, locomotive 165 left Cork Kent railway station at roughly 06:30, ferrying an empty train into Cobh. The train failed to stop and continued through the wall of the adjacent Cobh Heritage Centre. There were no injuries incurred by any of the four personnel on board, the driver narrowly escaping injury as a roof beam penetrated the right side cab window. The carriages were later removed and services resumed from the station that day.

==Preservation==
===Railway Preservation Society of Ireland===
The first of the 141 class locomotives to enter preservation was class leader 141, which was purchased by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland with sponsorship from Murphy Models in February 2010. The sale of the locomotive was assisted by Phil Verster, the CME of Iarnród Éireann. As part of the sale, the locomotive received a repaint into its original Black &amp; Tan livery as B141 at Inchicore workshops, where it was held in store.

Later in February 2010, locomotive 142 was purchased privately by a member of the RPSI and given to the Society. This locomotive was also repainted into its original Black &amp; Tan livery as B142 at Inchicore, and ran an enthusiasts&#x27; special on Wednesday 24 February 2010 with B141. Following this the locomotive was moved to the RPSI&#x27;s site at Whitehead, where it saw regular service as a yard shunter. Bodywork repairs, including cab floors and sides were completed in 2020/21, a full engine rebuild during 2021/22 after failure due to cylinder liner o-ring failure, and full repaint to original livery in 2023.

In January 2011, the RPSI newsletter &quot;Five Foot Three&quot; announced that the RPSI had approached IÉ with the intentions of purchasing a third 141 class locomotive. At the time IÉ had three locomotives - numbers 162, 171, and 175 - still in service and agreed to make the best of the three locomotives available for preservation. Accordingly, locomotive 175 was selected for future preservation. In 2014 the locomotive was bought by the RPSI.

In July 2016, the two stored GM 141 locomotives owned by RPSI (B141 &amp; 175) were brought out of the sidings in Inchicore, and moved to RPSI&#x27;s shed at Connolly station for storage. The move happened on Tuesday 19 July, hauled by 071. Assessment of their condition took place afterwards and restoration to mainline running is planned. 175 was originally earmarked as a source of spares for B141, B142 and 121-class B134, but it may also be refurbished. 

===Irish Traction Group===
The Irish Traction Group (ITG) purchased locomotive 146 in May 2010. This locomotive, withdrawn in March 2010, remained in storage at Inchicore until November of that year, when it was transported by Allelys to the Downpatrick and County Down Railway. The locomotive is in active service and is a useful member of the D&amp;CDR fleet. Later in November 2010, the ITG purchased locomotive 152. This locomotive had been employed on work trains in the Mayo area until withdrawn in February 2010 following a brake failure at Ballyhaunis. Although repairs were started by IÉ, work was stopped after some preliminary dismantling work had been carried out in both cabs. It was sold as a source of spare parts for 124, 146, and 190. It is currently in storage at Moyasta Junction on the West Clare Railway. It is currently covered by a tarpaulin with the intention it will be moved to a new heritage railway when one becomes available.

===Preservation Status===
645 Engine Fitted: B141, B142, 145, 148, 149, 151, 163, 164, 166, 170 and 173.

567 Engine Refitted: 146, 152, 167 and 175.

==In fiction==

*Class members 164 and 172 appear in the 1992 Irish fantasy family adventure &quot;Into the West&quot;.
*Class member 151 appears in the Walt Disney Productions film &quot;The Secret of Boyne Castle&quot;

==Model==
* Murphy Models have produced via Bachmann a comprehensive range of &#x27;00&#x27; gauge 141 Class models. All liveries are covered (Black &amp; Tan, CIE Golden Brown, Irish Rail and Iarnród Éireann) and with correct detailing for each era (e.g. LED pilot lights on the later versions). These models were first released in early 2008.
* A Rapid Prototyped 141 N Scale body is available from Valve Design.
* The 141 class along with many other locomotives and rolling stock has been made into a drivable locomotive for the game openbve by Celtic trainsim.

<doc id="1262777" wikidata="Q734274" url="?curid=1262777" title="Manuel da Nóbrega">
<text>Manuel da Nóbrega, SJ (old spelling &quot;Manoel da Nóbrega&quot;) (18 October 1517 – 18 October 1570) was a Portuguese Jesuit priest and first Provincial of the Society of Jesus in colonial Brazil. Together with José de Anchieta, he was very influential in the early history of Brazil and participated in the founding of several cities, such as Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo, as well as many Jesuit colleges and seminaries.

==Early life==
Nóbrega was born on October 18, 1517, in Sanfins do Douro, Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Portugal, to an important family; his father was Baltasar da Nóbrega, a prominent judge of justice. Manuel da Nobrega studied humanities at Porto and Salamanca, Spain and at the University of Coimbra, where he obtained his baccalaureate in canon law and philosophy in 1541. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1544 and, after being ordained, carried out pastoral work in the regions of Entre-Douro-e-Minho and Beira.

==Missionary in Brazil==
In 1549, he joined the naval fleet of the first Portuguese Governor-General Tomé de Sousa (1502–1579) following a request by King John III of Portugal to the Society of Jesus to start the missionary work of converting the Amerindians, who were in the eyes of the Catholic Church, of building churches and religious seminars, and of educating the colonists.

Nóbrega arrived in the captaincy of Bahia on March 29, 1549, accompanied by five other Jesuits. The Governor-General&#x27;s first actions were to found the colonial capital city of Salvador (&quot;The Savior&quot;, in Portuguese) and to celebrate its first Mass in 1549.

Nóbrega and his colleagues tried to fulfill their mission but faced many difficulties because the colonists mistreated and tried to enslave the Indians. He soon was fiercely engaged in the defense of the Indians, which led to serious clashes with inhabitants and authorities of the new colony, alike, including the first Governor-General and the one who succeeded him, Duarte da Costa.

To gain authority in his fight against the colonists, Nóbrega asked the King to establish an episcopacy in Brazil, which was granted on February 25, 1551. The first Bishop of Brazil, Dom Pero Fernandes Sardinha took office on June 22, 1552. By then, Nóbrega had already created the Jesuit College of Salvador. Nóbrega was then nominated the first Provincial of the Society of Jesus in the New World, a post that he held until 1559. However, Dom Sardinha was killed and eaten by hostile Indians after a shipwreck, changing Nóbrega&#x27;s mind about the Indian mission.

Sensing the difficulties of converting adult Indians to Christianity, Nóbrega determined that the Jesuits&#x27; efforts should concentrate on the teaching of children, who were more pliable. The Jesuits started to create elementary schools for teaching Portuguese and Latin, basic literacy, and religion. The Jesuits discovered that singing was a very effective way of winning the attention of the students, and Nóbrega was one of the pioneers in using music in education in Brazil. To help the evangelization of children, Nóbrega had the idea of bringing in seven orphan children to Brazil and making them learn Tupi, the language of the Indians, so that they would be bilingual and act as translators. The children would often go with the Jesuits on foot to faraway places and were protected and cherished by the Indians. Several of the children became Jesuit priests, too.

In 1552, Nóbrega again accompanied Tomé de Sousa to the captaincy of São Vicente, in the present-day southern state of São Paulo. There in 1553 he was joined by another group of Jesuits, who had arrived with José de Anchieta, then a young novice, who travelled with Duarte da Costa, the second Governor-General sent by the Crown. Nóbrega determined as the new mission of the small band of missionaries to found villages (&quot;aldeamentos&quot;) on the high plateau just above the coastline to better pursue their work of catechesis and education of the Indians. Thus, on January 25, 1554, Nóbrega and Anchieta celebrated the first mass in the new and modest Jesuit College of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, in honor of Saint Paul&#x27;s day of conversion to Christianity. The tiny settlement around this Jesuit school was to become one of the largest metropoles of the world, São Paulo.

==Missionary practice==

Nóbrega and his men began catechizing and baptizing the natives upon their arrival in Brazil. One of the early encounters with members of indigenous groups was when Nóbrega and his men tried to stop preparations for a cannibal feast and the natives rose against the Christians. The Governor&#x27;s militia helped to defend the missionaries against the native uprising.

Busy building chapels and schools, the missionaries boasted of the high rate of conversion of the natives. The Jesuits had begun teaching prayers to the natives as well as teaching them how to write and sing. According to a report written by Nóbrega, 500 natives had been baptized within the first five months of the arrival of the Jesuits, and many more were catechumens.

Portuguese colonies in Brazil, like many other colonies in the Americas, had problems of slavery and concubinage being common among the new settlers. Nóbrega was concerned that the Portuguese settlers were not good examples. Nóbrega was unable to limit slavery among the Portuguese, so he chose separation instead. He moved toward the physical separation of the natives and the Portuguese to limit their contact with corrupt surroundings and focused on reducing the Jesuits’ reliance on support from the Portuguese crown.

Nóbrega was encouraged that many natives had converted to Christianity despite being mistreated by the Europeans. The Brazilian sugar plantation colony, for example, was founded on the extensive use of Indian labor. Although this stage in the development of the Brazilian economy was temporary, the Portuguese eventually began using African slave labor, it had long-lasting effects on the morale of the native people. The Portuguese had created a society in which the natives had to live by Portuguese rules and conform to new modes of behavior, defined by European social and racial categories.

==Descriptions of natives==

Nobrega’s &quot;Diálogo sobre a Conversão do Gentio&quot; uses the point of view of two Portuguese settlers to describe the native people of Brazil. The dialogue between the men provides insight into some of the characterizations of the native population.

Gonçalo Álvares, a lay person preaching to the natives, describes them in the opening lines as &quot;those beasts.&quot; He dehumanizes the natives and, at the same time, questions their capacity to understand and accept Christianity. Mateus Nogueira, his companion, agrees and upholds that characterization by stating that those natives are worse than all others in the sense that they do not grasp Christianity. That description is a reflection of Nóbrega’s frustration with the native population.

Later, the two characters discuss the role of a Christian among a native population. Gonçalo questions their goal, and Nogueira clearly states that it is charity and love of God and of neighbor. That last statement places the native peoples, as human beings, among the neighbors whom Christians, including the Portuguese settlers, must love.

Nóbrega questions the importance of converting the natives. On one hand, he is unsure whether they are capable of fully grasping the concept of Christianity, especially with the language barrier. On the other hand, as a Christian and as a Jesuit, he understands his stance must be that of a kind, understanding teacher.

==War and expansion==
The exploitation and massacres of Indian villages by the Portuguese colonists continued, despite the pacification efforts of Nóbrega. The Tamoio and Tupiniquim tribes, who lived along the Brazilian coast from the present-day states of Espírito Santo to Paraná, were most affected. Rebelling, they formed a warring tribal alliance, which became the Tamoio Confederation (&quot;Confederação dos Tamoios&quot;, in Portuguese), and started attacks on the villages founded by the colonists. São Paulo was attacked several times, but the Portuguese resisted.

Hard pressed, Nóbrega tried to make a peace treaty with the Confederation, sensing that all their efforts and the Portuguese colonization were in great danger. Under considerable duress and several threats of being killed and eaten by the Indians, Nóbrega and Anchieta stayed for a time in Iperoig (present-day Ubatuba in the northern coast of São Paulo), in conference with the tribal chieftains, until Nóbrega was able to achieve a temporary peace. Anchieta&#x27;s command of Tupi, the language spoken by most of the Indians (of which he had compiled a vocabulary and a grammar), was extremely useful to Nóbrega, who had no such ability.

The arrival of a French invasion force in 1555, in the Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro (the so-called &quot;France Antarctique&quot; episode), however, tipped the balance again since the Indians saw an opportunity to rally the Frenchmen&#x27;s help to vanquish the Portuguese. Thus, Nóbrega had no alternative other than bless and support the punitive expeditions sent by the third Governor-General from Portugal, Mem de Sá, in 1560 and by his nephew, Estácio de Sá, in 1565. The French colonists were defeated and expelled, and their Indian allies were reduced to submission.

After the expulsion of the French invaders, Nóbrega founded a new Jesuit College in Rio, the College of Saint Vincent, and was nominated its rector (dean). In 1570 he was again nominated Brazilian Provincial of the Jesuit Order, but he died before taking office, on October 18, 1570, his 53rd birthday. Seven years later, the Jesuit Provincialship of Brazil was accepted by Anchieta, his great pupil and friend.

<doc id="1262803" wikidata="Q3041248" url="?curid=1262803" title="Duncan Mackenzie">
<text>Duncan Mackenzie (17 May 1861 – 25 August 1934) was a Scottish archaeologist who assisted Arthur Evans in his excavations of the Minoan palace at Knossos.

==Early biography==

Duncan MacKenzie was born on 17 May 1861 in the small Gaelic-speaking village of Aultgowrie, just outside Muir of Ord, near to Inverness. He was the fourth of nine children born to Margaret Kennedy MacKenzie and Alexander MacKenzie, who worked as gamekeeper of the Fairburn Estate. The family spoke Gaelic at home, but the children were required to learn English when they went to school. 

Mackenzie studied philosophy at the University of Edinburgh and received his PhD from Vienna in classical archaeology.

==Professional career==
Appointed field supervisor of the excavation of Phylakopi by the British School at Athens, he worked closely with a team of professional archaeologists including Arthur Evans and David George Hogarth. They were investigating the provenance of Mycenaean pottery as defined by Heinrich Schliemann. After a few years they realised that Phylakopi was not going to yield that information. The evidence pointed toward Crete. Evans and Hogarth left Phylakopi, while MacKenzie stayed on to wind the excavation down.

Within a few years the secession of Crete from the Ottoman Empire opened opportunities to excavate there. Hogarth was the first to discover it. He sent for Evans immediately, as the Phylakopi crew had been a very close-knit team. Purchasing the land at Knossos, Evans began excavation, sending for the third member of the team, MacKenzie, who took up his old position as supervisor of excavation. In her book on the Evans family (of which she was the latest member, being Arthur&#x27;s half-sister), &quot;Time and Chance&quot;, Joan Evans gives this verbal portrait of MacKenzie in his prime:
Hogarth left for other excavations and then other careers, but Evans and MacKenzie collaborated so closely on the excavation of Knossos and theorisation about it that the ideas of the two men are not distinguishable from each other. MacKenzie kept the day book, or log of daily discoveries and served as a middle man between Evans and the inhabitants of Crete. MacKenzie also wrote contributions of his own. The British connotation of &quot;assistant&quot; does not convey the true relationship. A PhD and professional archaeologist in his own right, MacKenzie was every bit the peer of Evans, His position as second-in-command was only a social convention. The two would work together for the next thirty years, long after the excavation was complete (1905). MacKenzie remained as curator of the site, taking up residence in the new Villa Ariadne constructed as headquarters in 1906 on the hill above the site. Prior to then the archaeologists resided and worked in a Turkish house below the site, which leaked apparently irreparably and provided difficult access to the site.

==Later life==
According to Evans, Mackenzie came to suffer from severe alcoholism and could not only no longer function as curator, but was fast declining into a demented state. Evans placed him in an institution, where he died not long after. Joan Evans reports that Mackenzie had become very difficult to work with during the latter years of his curatorship because of &quot;the gradual onset of his illness.&quot; It has also been said that Evans found Mackenzie one night passed out on a table and fired him the next day. Friends of Mackenzie disputed this, saying he did not drink. Whether the problem was alcoholism, denied for some reason by his family, or one of the brain disorders often inflicting the elderly, which Duncan then was, or some combination, Joan adds that he died in a state of &quot;mental aberration.&quot;

Mackenzie died in Pesaro, Italy on 25 August 1934.

<text>The Córas Iompair Éireann 181 Class locomotives were built in 1966 by General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) and numbered B181 to B192.

==Overview==

These locomotives were virtually identical to the earlier 141 Class locomotives, but fitted with the more powerful 645 engine and thermostatically controlled engine cooling fan and inlet shutters. Delivery took place in 1966, with introduction into service happening a short time later.

They were fitted with an EMD 8-645E engine of 1100 hp, weighed , and had a maximum design speed of which was restricted to in service. Number 186 was later fitted with an EMD 8-567CR engine of , as used in the 141 Class locomotives.

==Withdraw and preservation==
All of the 181 class have been withdrawn, the first being 191 in 1991 after a runaway incident at Clonsilla; it was later scrapped in 1998. The last was 190 in November 2009 and has been preserved by the Irish Traction Group based at the West Clare Railway. In their final days they were only used on permanent way trains or as pilots.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On Tuesday 13 August 1974, locomotive B192 was hauling a passenger train when it was involved in a head-on collision with locomotive B176, which was also hauling a passenger train, at . Fifteen people were injured.

==Model==
Murphy Models of Dublin commissioned Bachmann to produce an OO gauge model of these locomotives. This model first was released in December 2007. It has been supplied in all four main liveries worn by the class.

<doc id="1262820" wikidata="Q1206935" url="?curid=1262820" title="Foreign exchange option">
<text>In finance, a foreign exchange option (commonly shortened to just FX option or currency option) is a derivative financial instrument that gives the right but not the obligation to exchange money denominated in one currency into another currency at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date. See Foreign exchange derivative.

The foreign exchange options market is the deepest, largest and most liquid market for options of any kind. Most trading is over the counter (OTC) and is lightly regulated, but a fraction is traded on exchanges like the International Securities Exchange, Philadelphia Stock Exchange, or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for options on futures contracts. The global market for exchange-traded currency options was notionally valued by the Bank for International Settlements at $158.3 trillion in 2005.

==Example==
For example, a GBPUSD
contract could give the owner the right to sell £1,000,000 and buy $2,000,000 on December 31. In this case the pre-agreed exchange rate, or strike price, is 2.0000 USD per GBP (or GBP/USD 2.00 as it is typically quoted) and the notional amounts (notionals) are £1,000,000 and $2,000,000.

This type of contract is both a call on dollars and a put on sterling, and is typically called a &quot;GBPUSD put&quot;, as it is a put on the &quot;exchange rate&quot;; although it could equally be called a &quot;USDGBP call&quot;.

If the rate is lower than 2.0000 on December 31 (say 1.9000), meaning that the dollar is stronger and the pound is weaker, then the option is exercised, allowing the owner to sell GBP at 2.0000 and immediately buy it back in the spot market at 1.9000, making a profit of (2.0000 GBPUSD − 1.9000 GBPUSD) × 1,000,000 GBP = 100,000 USD in the process. If instead they take the profit in GBP (by selling the USD on the spot market) this amounts to 100,000 / 1.9000 = 52,632 GBP.

==Terms==
* Call option – the right to buy an asset at a fixed date and price.
* Put option – the right to sell an asset at a fixed date and price.
* Foreign exchange option – the right to sell money in one currency and buy money in another currency at a fixed date and rate.
* Strike price – the asset price at which the investor can exercise an option.
* Spot price – the price of the asset at the time of the trade.
* Forward price – the price of the asset for delivery at a future time.
* Notional – the amount of each currency that the option allows the investor to sell or buy.
* Ratio of notionals – the &quot;strike&quot;, not the current &quot;spot&quot; or &quot;forward&quot;.
* Numéraire – the currency in which an asset is valued.
* Non-linear payoff – the payoff for a straightforward FX option is linear in the underlying currency, denominating the payout in a given numéraire.
* Change of numéraire – the implied volatility of an FX option depends on the numéraire of the purchaser, again because of the non-linearity of formula_1.
* In the money – for a put option, this is when the current price is less than the strike price, and would thus generate a profit were it exercised; for a call option the situation is inverted.

==Trading==
The difference between FX options and traditional options is that in the latter case, the trade involves giving an amount of money in exchange for the right to buy or sell a commodity, stock, or other non-monetary asset. In FX options, the asset in question is also money, denominated in another currency.

For example, a call option on oil allows the investor to buy oil at a given price and date. The investor on the other side of the trade is, in effect, selling a put option on the currency.

To eliminate residual risk, traders match the &quot;foreign&quot; currency notionals, not the local currency notionals, to ensure that the foreign currencies received and delivered offset each other.

Understanding forex market hours is crucial for mitigating risks and optimizing trading strategies. Reliable resources, such as FXClock, provide tools and insights into market activity across global time zones.

In the case of an FX option on a &quot;rate&quot;, as in the above example, an option on GBPUSD provides a USD value that is linear in GBPUSD, using USD as the numéraire (a move from 2.0000 to 1.9000 yields a profit). However, it has a non-linear GBP value. Conversely, the GBP value is linear in the USDGBP rate, while the USD value is non-linear. This is because inverting a rate has the effect of formula_1, which is non-linear.

==Hedging==
Corporations primarily use FX options to hedge &quot;uncertain&quot; future cash flows in a foreign currency. The general rule is to hedge &quot;certain&quot; foreign currency cash flows with &quot;forwards&quot;, and &quot;uncertain&quot; foreign cash flows with &quot;options&quot;.

Suppose a United Kingdom manufacturing firm expects to be paid for a piece of engineering equipment to be delivered in 90 days. If the GBP strengthens against the over the next 90 days the UK firm loses money, as it will receive less GBP after converting the into GBP. However, if the GBP weakens against the , then the UK firm receives more GBP. This uncertainty exposes the firm to FX risk. Assuming that the cash flow is certain, the firm can enter into a forward contract to deliver the in 90 days time, in exchange for GBP at the current forward exchange rate. This forward contract is free, and, presuming the expected cash arrives, exactly matches the firm&#x27;s exposure, perfectly hedging their FX risk.

If the cash flow is uncertain, a forward FX contract exposes the firm to FX risk in the &quot;opposite&quot; direction, in the case that the expected USD cash is &quot;not&quot; received, typically making an option a better choice.

Using options, the UK firm can purchase a GBP call/USD put option (the right to sell part or all of their expected income for pounds sterling at a predetermined rate), which:
* protects the GBP value that the firm expects in 90 days&#x27; time (presuming the cash is received)
* costs at most the option premium (unlike a forward, which can have unlimited losses)
* yields a profit if the expected cash is not received but FX rates move in its favor

==Valuation: the Garman–Kohlhagen model ==
As in the Black–Scholes model for stock options and the Black model for certain interest rate options, the value of a European option on an FX rate is typically calculated by assuming that the rate follows a log-normal process.

The earliest currency options pricing model was published by Biger and Hull, (Financial Management, spring 1983). The model preceded the Garman and Kolhagen&#x27;s Model. In 1983 Garman and Kohlhagen extended the Black–Scholes model to cope with the presence of two interest rates (one for each currency). Suppose that formula_3 is the risk-free interest rate to expiry of the domestic currency and formula_4 is the foreign currency risk-free interest rate (where domestic currency is the currency in which we obtain the value of the option; the formula also requires that FX rates – both strike and current spot be quoted in terms of &quot;units of domestic currency per unit of foreign currency&quot;). The results are also in the same units and to be meaningful need to be converted into one of the currencies.

Then the domestic currency value of a call option into the foreign currency is

:formula_5

The value of a put option has value
:formula_6

where :
:formula_7
:formula_8

:formula_9 is the current spot rate
:formula_10 is the strike price
:formula_11 is the cumulative normal distribution function
:formula_3 is domestic risk free simple interest rate
:formula_4 is foreign risk free simple interest rate
:formula_14 is the time to maturity (calculated according to the appropriate day count convention)
:and formula_15 is the volatility of the FX rate.

==Risk management==
An earlier pricing model was published by Biger and Hull, Financial Management, spring 1983. The model preceded Garman and Kolhagen Model. 
A wide range of techniques are in use for calculating the options risk exposure, or Greeks (as for example the Vanna-Volga method). Although the option prices produced by every model agree (with Garman–Kohlhagen), risk numbers can vary significantly depending on the assumptions used for the properties of spot price movements, volatility surface and interest rate curves.

After Garman–Kohlhagen, the most common models are SABR and local volatility, although when agreeing risk numbers with a counterparty (e.g. for exchanging delta, or calculating the strike on a 25 delta option) Garman–Kohlhagen is always used.

<text>Zeki Velidi Togan (, , ; 1890 – 1970 in Istanbul), was a Turkish-Bashkir historian, Turkologist, and leader of the Bashkir revolutionary and liberation movement, doctor of philosophy (1935), professor, honorary doctor of the University of Manchester (1967).

==Biography==
He was born in Kuzyanovo (Bashkir: Көҙән) village of Sterlitamaksky Uyezd, Ufa Governorate (in present-day Ishimbaysky District, Bashkortostan).

From 1912 to 1915 Velidi taught in the madrasa in Kazan (Qasimiyä), and from 1915 to 1917, he was a member of bureau, supporting Muslim deputies at the State Duma. In 1917, he was elected to the Millət Məjlisi, and with Şərif Manatov, he organized the Bashkir Shuro (Council). During the Bashkir Congress in Orenburg from December 1917, he declared autonomous Bashkiria. However, he was arrested 3 February 1918 by the Soviet forces. In April 1918 he managed to escape and joined the forces confronting the Bolsheviks. 

In 1918 and 1919 Velidi&#x27;s Bashkir troops first fought under Ataman Alexander Dutov, then under Admiral Kolchak against Bolshevik forces. After the RSFSR promised autonomy to Bashkirs, Velidi switched allegiance, fighting with the Bolsheviks.

From February 1919 to June 1920, he was chairman of the &quot;Bashrevkom&quot; (Bashkir Revolutionary Committee). He attended the Congress of the Peoples of the East held in Baku in September 1920, where he became involved in drawing up the statutes of ERK, a Muslim Socialist organisation. However, feeling the Bolsheviks had broken their promises, he became more critical of them when he moved to Central Asia.

In Turkistan, Velidi became a leader of the Basmachi Movement. From 1920 to 1923, he was chairman of the &quot;National Union of Turkistan&quot;. In April 1923, he was part of a delegation to the British embassy in Mashhad requesting support for the Basmachi, which was met with skepticism by British officials.

In 1923 Velidi emigrated, after discovering original manuscripts of Ahmad ibn Fadlan in Iran.

From 1925 Velidi lived in Turkey and was appointed Chair of Turkish History at the Istanbul University in 1927. However, his controversial views criticizing the Turkish History Thesis at the First Turkish Language Congress in 1932, forced him to seek refuge in Vienna, where he gained a doctor of philosophy at the University of Vienna in 1935. Following he became a professor at Bonn University (1935–1937) and Göttingen University (1938–1939). On the 3 May 1944 protests in support of Nihal Atsız occurred, who was on trial and on the 9 May he was detained together with other Pan-Turkists like Alparslan Türkeş, Nihal Atsız and Reha Oğuz Türkkan. In March 1945 he was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor. During trial he was accused of having been the chair of Gürem, an organization aimed at forming a military alliance with Nazi Germany in order to liberate the Turkic people living in the Soviet Union. In 1947 a retrial ended with the release of all defendants. In 1953 he became organizer of the &quot;İslam Tetkikleri Enstitüsü&quot; (Institute for Islamic Studies) at Istanbul University. In 1967, he was given an honorary doctorate from the University of Manchester. At the same time he contributed to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Turkic Peoples&quot;. His articles about culture, language and history of Turkic peoples have been translated into many languages.

== Views ==
Velidi was a Turkist and advocate for the removal of Persian cultural influence in the Turkic World, becoming influential in promoting this within the Jadidist movement. In his view, the Turkic peoples had become &quot;imprisoned in the civilization of the Iranians,&quot; criticising the speech and literature of the people of the cities of Bukhara, Fergana and Khiva for being intermixed with Persian vocabulary. He believed that the Persian influence needed to be removed for Turkic peoples to find their own &quot;national spiritual wealth.&quot;

<doc id="1262823" wikidata="Q7554047" url="?curid=1262823" title="Soft tissue injury">
<text>A soft tissue injury is the damage of muscles, ligaments and tendons throughout the body. Common soft tissue injuries usually occur from a sprain, strain, a one-off blow resulting in a contusion or overuse of a particular part of the body. Soft tissue injuries can result in pain, swelling, bruising and loss of function.

== Signs and symptoms ==
=== Sprains ===

A sprain is a type of acute injury which results from the stretching or tearing of a ligament. Depending on the severity of the sprain, the movement on the joint can be compromised since ligaments aid in the stability and support of joints. Sprains are commonly seen in vulnerable areas such as the wrists, knees and ankles. They can occur from movements such as falling on an outstretched hand or a twisting of the ankle or foot.

The severity of a sprain can be classified:
* Grade 1: Only some of the fibers in the ligament are torn, and the injured site is moderately painful and swollen. Function in the joint will be unaffected for the most part.
* Grade 2: Many of the ligament fibers are torn, and pain and swelling is moderate. The functionality of the joint is compromised.
* Grade 3: The soft tissue is completely torn, and functionality and strength on the joint is completely compromised. In most cases, surgery is needed to repair the damage.

=== Strains ===

A strain is a type of acute injury that occurs to the muscle or tendon. Similar to sprains, it can vary in severity, from a stretching of the muscle or tendon to a complete tear of the tendon from the muscle. Some of the most common places that strains occur are in the foot, back of the leg (hamstring), or back.

=== Bruising (contusion) ===

A contusion is the discoloration of the skin, which results from underlying muscle fibers and connective tissue being crushed. This can happen in a variety of ways such as a direct blow to the skin, or a fall taken against a hard surface. The discoloration in the skin is present when blood begins to pool around the injury.

=== Tendinitis ===

Tendinitis is a type of overuse injury to the tendons, which demonstrates signs of inflammation of tendons around a joint. Tendinitis is the most common cause of shoulder pain and also leg pain . Tendinitis occurs when there is repetitive stress on the subacromial bursa, which causes the bones to make contact with the tendons and irritate them.

==Diagnosis==
=== Classifications ===
==== Acute injuries ====

Any type of injury that occurs to the body through sudden trauma, such as a fall, twist or blow to the body. A few examples of this type of injury would be sprains, strains and contusions.

==== Overuse injuries ====
An overuse injury occurs when a certain activity is repeated frequently and the body does not have enough time to recover between occurrences. Examples include bursitis and tendinitis.

===Commonly injured tissues===
&quot;With examples of each. Parentheses indicate location in body&quot; 
* Ligaments
:Anterior cruciate ligament (knee), medial collateral ligament (knee), ulnar collateral ligaments (wrist/hand), interspinous ligaments (vertebrae)
* Muscles
:Biceps brachii (upper arm), rectus femoris (thigh), transverse abdominis (abdominals)
* Tendons
:Patellar tendon (knee), calcaneal/Achilles tendon (foot/lower leg), biceps tendon (shoulder/elbow)
* Nerves
:Brachial plexus (shoulder), ulnar nerve (elbow/hand), peroneal nerve (ankle/foot), cranial nerves I-XII(head)
* Bones
:Femur (leg), humerus (arm), ribs (torso), metatarsals I-VI (foot), metacarpals I-VI (hand)
* Cartilage
:Menisci (knee), intervertebral discs (spine), acetabulum (hip)

==Management==
=== RICE method ===
The RICE method is an effective procedure used in the initial treatment of a soft tissue injury.

; Rest
: It is suggested that the patient take a break from the activity that caused the injury in order to give the injury time to heal.
; Ice
: The injury should be iced on and off in 20 minute intervals, avoiding direct contact of the ice with the skin.
; Compression
: Bandaging the injury will compress it, and prevent any further bleeding or swelling from occurring.
; Elevation
: Elevating the injury above the heart while resting will aid in the reduction of swelling.

=== No HARM protocol ===
This mnemonic indicates what to do within the first 48–72 hours after the injury in order to speed up the recovery process.

; Heat
: Applying heat to the injured area can cause blood flow and swelling to increase.
; Alcohol
: Alcohol can inhibit the ability to feel if the injury is becoming more aggravated, as well as increasing blood flow and swelling.
; Re-injury
: Avoid any activities that could aggravate the injury and cause further damage.
; Massage
: Massaging an injured area can promote blood flow and swelling, and potentially cause more damage if done too early.

===Treatment===
If severe pain persists after the first 24hours it is recommended that an individual consult with a professional who can make a diagnosis and implement a treatment plan so the patient can return to everyday activities. To make a full diagnosis, a professional may use nerve conduction studies to localize nerve dysfunction (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome), assess severity, and help with prognosis. Electrodiagnosis also helps differentiate between myopathy and neuropathy. Using the RICE method can somewhat be controversial as the science behind using ice is not necessarily very clear. On one hand, ice diminishes pain, metabolism, and muscle spasms.  It also minimizes the inflammatory process and edema, which helps one recover from a soft-tissue injury. However, creatine kinase-MB isoform and myoglobin levels circulating in the blood increased after exercising. Ice impedes the recovery process by keeping the Creatine kinase-MB isoform and myoglobin levels increased 2–3 days post exercise. It is therefore important to weigh the pros and cons before applying any treatment, including the use of ice.

Ultimately, the best method of imaging soft tissue is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), though it is cost-prohibitive and carries a high false positive rate.

<text>William Foote Whyte (June 27, 1914 – July 16, 2000) was an American sociologist chiefly known for his ethnographic study in urban sociology, &quot;Street Corner Society&quot;. A proponent of participant observation, he lived for four years in an Italian community in Boston while a Junior Fellow at Harvard researching social relations of street gangs in Boston&#x27;s North End.

==Early life==
Whyte, from an upper-middle-class background, showed an early interest in writing, economics and social reform. After graduating from Swarthmore College, he was selected for the Junior Fellows program, where his landmark research was done. After his research in Boston, he entered the sociology doctoral program at the University of Chicago. &quot;Street Corner Society&quot; was published by the University of Chicago Press in 1943. He spent a year teaching at the University of Oklahoma, but developed polio in 1943 and spent two years in physical therapy at the Warm Springs Foundation. Rehabilitation was only partially successful; Whyte walked with a cane for the rest of his life, and used two arm crutches in his later years.

==Professional career==
He briefly returned to the University of Chicago in 1944, then joined the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University in 1948, remaining at Cornell for the remainder of his career. At Cornell he supervised Chris Argyris with his doctorate. He worked for social reform and social change, directing his efforts toward &quot;empowering the disenfranchized and narrowing the gap between rich and poor.&quot; He studied industrial and agricultural workers and workers&#x27; cooperatives in Venezuela, Peru, Guatemala and in the Basque region of Spain, as well as in the United States. He authored hundreds of articles and 20 books including an autobiography. He is considered a pioneer in industrial sociology.

==Family==
At his death William F. Whyte was survived by his wife, Kathleen (King) Whyte, his sons Martin King Whyte and John Whyte, and his daughters Joyce Wiza and Lucy Whyte Ferguson.

==Education==
Professor Whyte received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from Swarthmore College in 1936, and was selected for the Junior Fellows program at Harvard University, where his landmark research was done. After his research in Boston, he entered the sociology doctoral program at the University of Chicago.

==Association==
Whyte served as the president of the American Sociological Association in 1981 and also of the Society for Applied Anthropology in 1964.

<text>Rayleigh is a lunar impact crater, approximately 114 kilometers in diameter, that lies along the northeast limb of the Moon. This feature is seen edge-on from Earth, making it difficult to see much detail. In addition, libration effects can completely hide this crater from view. It lies just to the north of Lyapunov, and to the northwest of the large Joliot. Attached to its southwest rim is the smaller Urey.

== Description ==

This is an eroded formation with a rim that has been worn and reshaped by impacts. This is particularly so in the south where the rim has been modified and supplemented by adjacent crater formations and several small craters that lie along the rim.

The interior floor is relatively level in places, but, partly due to overlapping ejecta, is somewhat rough and irregular in others, particularly in the southern half. A pair of small but prominent craters lies on the interior surface, with Rayleigh D just to the south of the crater midpoint and the smaller Rayleigh B situated in the western half.

Rayleigh was named for John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Rayleigh.
The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Rayleigh A — &quot;see&quot; Urey (crater).

<text>Ansan College of Technology (also called Ansan Technical College) is a private technical college in Ansan City, which lies south of Seoul in Gyeonggi province. It offers degree programs in social science (including English), tourism, physical education, industrial design, engineering, and computers. All programs place a strong emphasis on vocational outcomes. The campus stands in Danwon-gu, not far from the massive industrial complex in Sihwa, which facilitates partnerships with local industry. The college enrolls about 3,000 students, and employs about 55 instructors.

==History==

As is often the case with private institutions of higher education in South Korea, the foundation to establish the school had begun its activities a long time before the actual establishment: the Ansan College Foundation was begun in 1979. The school was finally opened in April 1994 as Ansan Industrial Technical College, and changed to its current name in 1998. The first president after the founding of the college was Young Yup Cho.

<text>Kingston Wall was a psychedelic/progressive rock group from Helsinki, Finland, originally formed in 1987. Influenced by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, the group combined eastern themes, mysticism and vivid psychedelia with acid rock.
The band consisted of Petri Walli (guitars, lead vocals), Jukka Jylli (bass, backing vocals) and Sami Kuoppamäki (drums, percussion). Walli took the most active role in the band. He formed the group, composed most of the songs and wrote all the lyrics. He was also Kingston Wall&#x27;s producer and manager and ran the band&#x27;s own Trinity record label.

==History==
===Early days===
Kingston Wall was formed in 1987, when Petri Walli asked Jukka Jylli to join his band. Petteri Ståhl and Jukka Häikiö later joined the band as drummer and lead singer, respectively. The band was named Moonshine Makers and they played their first shows in 1988. Häikiö soon quit the band after getting tired of waiting for Walli to finish his long guitar solos. The band became a trio, with Walli taking the role of lead singer despite doubting his skills. The band was renamed Kingston Wall, which was derived from Walli&#x27;s last name and the supposed name of a mental hospital in England, although Walli later gave varying explanations for the name. The capital of Jamaica, Kingston, allegedly had nothing to do with the name.

The band&#x27;s first performance as Kingston Wall and as a trio, was in September 1988. This successful show spawned many others. During these early gigs, the band played their own songs, but also covers from bands such as the Beatles, Frank Zappa, the Who and Jimi Hendrix. They recorded a demo tape in early 1989, which included the song “I’m Not the One”, which would appear on their first full-length album. After touring extensively and gaining some followers in the Helsinki rock-scene, Walli was eager to take his music to another level. However, drummer Ståhl was not as talented a musician as Walli and Jylli, which held the band back. In Autumn 1989, Ståhl was asked to leave and he was replaced by the more technically capable Timo Joutsimäki. The new line-up recorded another demo, which included the songs “Used to Feel Before”, “Waste of Time” and “I Wish I Had Seen You”.

===Kingston Wall I===
After deciding the time was ready for the band to record and release a full-length studio album, they sent their demos to labels that published music sung in English in Finland. Initially, no label was interested in signing the band, but after tireless persuasion, the label One Inch Rock signed Kingston Wall in 1990. Walli was given full control over the production of the album and he used his power to control every aspect of the recording, which led to confrontations between him and Joutsimäki. While recording the album, the band continued playing live. Ralf Örn, who was responsible for signing Kingston Wall to One Inch Rock, became interested in managing the band. His connections helped the band secure their first and only gig outside Finland in May 1990 in Tallinn, Estonia.

The confrontations between Walli and Joutsimäki continued, and Joutsimäki began arriving to practise and gigs drunk and late. Eventually, the drummer stopped appearing to practise all together and reportedly sold his drums as redundant. Walli started looking for a new drummer, and after a month of searching, heard of a promising young talent, Sami Kuoppamäki, who was studying in Los Angeles Musicians Institute. Walli sent him their demo tapes, and, impressed by their sound, Kuoppamäki decided to join. The band began hosting their own club night which they dubbed Freakout. During Freakout nights, Kingston Wall performed with various other local bands, often playing cover songs, alternative versions of their own songs and with various line-ups. Kuoppamäki now being a stable member of the band, the recording of the first album was restarted from scratch. The recording was finished, but One Inch Rock decided that they did not want to release the album after all, instead opting to give the distribution rights to EMI Finland. To produce the album, Walli founded Pedro Cucaracha Productions and the record label Trinity. Kingston Wall released their first, &quot;self-titled&quot; album, (later referenced and re-released as &quot;I&quot;) in January 1992. The official release gig for the new album was 31 January 1992 at Tavastia Club. This was followed by a number of gigs throughout Finnish clubs and festivals. Their debut album consisted mainly of psychedelic hard rock along with a cover of Jimi Hendrix&#x27; song &quot;Fire&quot;, which gained the group some popularity among the Finnish radio stations. The album culminated in the heavily progressive, 21-minute track, &quot;Mushrooms&quot;.

===Kingston Wall II===
In the summer of 1992, Walli got interested in techno music and started going to techno raves, where LSD and magic mushrooms were commonplace. Walli brought his newfound love for techno into the music of Kingston Wall, by covering &quot;I Feel Love&quot; by Donna Summer. The following autumn, the band entered the studio to record their next studio album, II. Similar to the previous album, II was produced by Pedro Cucaracha Productions and distributed by EMI Finland. The recordings went smoothly and were finished in a few weeks and the release gig was held 29 January 1993 at Tavastia, followed by a 13 date Finnish tour. After playing at many major music festivals in Finland in the summer of 1993, Walli was desperate for the band to gain international success. However, large international record labels were not interested in signing the band. The band continued hosting their Freakout club nights, during which they now implemented more techno and house elements by having a DJ play with the band.

The album evolved the sound of the band by introducing more acoustic and folk elements to their songs, like acoustic guitars and violins in &quot;Istwan&quot; (violin played by Ufo Mustonen) and saxophones in &quot;Shine On Me&quot; (saxophone played by Sakari Kukko). They also included a cross-genre cover version of the Donna Summer disco classic &quot;I Feel Love&quot;.

===III - Tri-Logy and Walli&#x27;s death===
In January 1994, Walli went on holiday to India, where he met Ior Bock, a Finnish mystic, who, during hashish fuelled nights, told listeners of the Bock saga, an eccentric explanation about the origins of the alphabets, words, and the whole human history. Inspired by the Bock saga, Walli wrote and rewrote new songs for their upcoming album, which was to be called III – Tri-Logy. The music and lyrics were riddled with references to previous Kingston Wall releases and the Bock saga. Compared to the two weeks it took to record the previous album, this time the band had booked 13 weeks of studio time. Unlike on previous albums, each band member recorded their parts separately, and some of the songs the band had never practised before entering the studio. The album ended up being the most expensive self-published album in Finland at that time. The album was different in style and tone compared to their two previous releases as it included more hard rock sounds, at times combined with dub reggae, techno, and synthesizers arranged by Kimmo Kajasto (from Koneveljet and Rinneradio). The last song on the album, &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, runs for 18 minutes and again features Sakari Kukko on saxophone, along with ambient synthesizer pads played by Kimmo Kajasto.

After an eight-month break from playing live, the band returned to the stage in August 1994, playing their first gig under the alias &quot;Spirits of Istwan&quot;. The official release gig was held 1 October 1994, once again at Tavastia and was followed by a Finnish tour. Meanwhile, Walli&#x27;s erratic behaviour and obsession with the Bock saga had grown to a level where people started avoiding him. Growing tensions and the harshness of life on tour took their toll on the morale of both the band and crew, and the band voted the stop the tour short, cancelling the final show of the tour.

In December, Kingston Wall played three more gigs. They played their last public show in Lepakko, Helsinki in December 1994 and their last show ever was some days later in Sörnäinen prison in Helsinki. After this, the band called it quits in a local cafeteria and each of the members went on their separate ways. Walli left for India and shortly after his return to Finland, on 28 June 1995, jumped to his death from the tower of Töölö Church in central Helsinki.

The suicide was apparently caused by several factors. Walli had lost his faith in Ior Bock&#x27;s mythologies and felt ashamed for basing the band&#x27;s third album on what he now perceived as deceptions. He had also broken up with his girlfriend some months earlier. Walli was later buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery, about one kilometer away from his place of death.

===Legacy and tribute concerts===
During their active time, Kingston Wall never achieved mainstream popularity. All their albums were printed in limited numbers and released on Walli&#x27;s own independent label, Trinity. It was only after the group had disbanded that their popularity slowly grew through word-of-mouth.

Although Kingston Wall never played outside Finland apart from one gig in Estonia, the group is considered even by many Finns as one of the country&#x27;s best hard rock groups. Their albums have appeared on the Finnish Top 40 album charts. The cult following status of Kingston Wall has also gained them a steadily growing fan base around the world, mostly thanks to the Internet.

Kingston Wall has influenced many Finnish rock groups and received cover tributes from artists such as The Rasmus (&quot;Used to Feel Before&quot; on their single &quot;Madness&quot;) and Amorphis (&quot;And I Hear You Call&quot; on &quot;My Kantele&quot; EP).

Jukka Jylli and Sami Kuoppamäki currently play in the Finnish rock outfit Zook.

In October 2018, the band announced on their Facebook page that they would be playing a gig at Tavastia Club in Helsinki to celebrate the 50th birthday of Petri Walli. Performing under the name Kingston Wall by JJylli, Kuoppis and Brothers von Hertzen, the outfit included Jylli on bass, Kuoppamäki on drums and the Von Hertzen Brothers on guitars, lead vocals and percussion. The Tavastia show was sold out in minutes, which prompted the band to embark on a full-fledged tour.

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band&#x27;s final public concert, Jylli and Kuoppamäki will play a tribute concert in Helsinki Ice Hall on 5 December 2024. The duo will be joined onstage by Jesper Anastasiadis, Juhani Grönroos, Esa Holopainen and Mikko Von Hertzen. The anniversary concert will be preceded by smaller concerts at Finnish festivals during the summer of 2024.

===Re-issues, remixes and books===

All the original Kingston Wall albums and singles under the Trinity label have been since sold out and are regarded collector&#x27;s items. The &quot;III - Tri-Logy&quot; was re-issued by the Finnish record label Zen Garden in 1998. A limited amount of 1000 copies included a bonus CD along with each of the three original remastered albums. The limited re-issues sold out quickly. The bonus CDs contained single B-sides and previously unreleased live recordings. In 2000, a remix album titled &quot;Freakout Remixes&quot; was released. This tribute album included techno and psychedelic trance remixes of the original Kingston Wall songs, made by such Finnish artists as Accu, Squaremeat and Texas Faggott.

A live CD box set Real Live Thing was released in 2005. The box set features three CDs recorded at various gigs during the band&#x27;s existence. The tracks were selected for this album by bass player Jukka Jylli.

In 2023, remixes of all three Kingston Wall studio albums were released. The albums were remixed by Robert Palomäki, who also mixed the band live and participated in the recording sessions of II and Tri-Logy.

In February 2014, Finnish rock journalist Viljami Puustinen published the book (&#x27;Kingston Wall: The Saga of Petri Walli&#x27;), a 325-page in-depth biography of Petri Walli that also explores the band&#x27;s history in detail.

Another book about the band, titled (&#x27;The Legacy of Kingston Wall&#x27;) was released in 2023. In this book, Kimmo Aroluoma, inspired by the tribute concert tour in 2019, aims to uncover the magic of the band by tracing the guitars played by Petri walli around Finland.

<text>The Plan de Sánchez massacre took place in the Guatemalan village of Plan de Sánchez, Baja Verapaz department, on 18 July 1982. Over 250 people (mostly women and children, and almost exclusively ethnic Achi Maya) were abused and murdered by members of the armed forces and their paramilitary allies.

The killings took place during one of the most violent phases of Guatemala&#x27;s Civil War, which pitted various groups of left-wing insurgents against the government and the armed forces. After assuming power in March 1982, de facto President Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt embarked on a military campaign that largely succeeded in breaking the insurgency, but at a terrible cost in human lives and human rights violations. The massacre in Plan de Sánchez was an element in the government&#x27;s scorched earth strategy, and the village was targeted because of the authorities&#x27; suspicions that the inhabitants were harbouring or otherwise supporting guerrilla groups.

After the massacre, the village was practically abandoned for a number of years, and the survivors were told that reprisals would follow if they spoke about the incident or revealed the location of the numerous mass graves they had helped to dig. With the gradual return to democracy that began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some of the survivors felt they could start to talk about the killings without fearing for their lives. Accusations were filed with the authorities in 1992 and, in 1993, a criminal investigation was launched. However, faced with delays and other irregularities in the proceedings, and stonewalled by a National Reconciliation Law that granted amnesties to the suspected perpetrators, the survivors saw that Guatemala&#x27;s domestic legal remedies were ineffective in this case. They consequently decided to lodge a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the supranational human rights arm of the Organisation of American States, in 1996.

The IACHR began processing the complaint, received a partial recognition of the state&#x27;s institutional responsibility from the democratically elected president Alfonso Portillo in the first year of his term, and finally referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights for judgement and settlement. In 2004, the Inter-American Court issued two judgements, in which it established Guatemala&#x27;s liability in the case and ordered an extensive package of monetary, non-monetary and symbolic forms of compensation for the survivors and the next-of-kin of the deceased.

==National context==

1982 was one of the bloodiest years in Guatemala&#x27;s 36-year-long history of internal conflict (1960–1996).

On 23 March 1982, army troops commanded by junior officers staged a coup d&#x27;état to prevent the assumption of power by Gen. Ángel Aníbal Guevara, the hand-picked successor of outgoing president Gen. Romeo Lucas García who had won a disputed election two weeks earlier. The coup leaders asked retired Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt to negotiate the departure of both Lucas and Guevara.

Ríos Montt, who had been the candidate of the Christian Democracy Party in the 1974 presidential election and was widely regarded as having been denied his victory through fraud, accepted the appointment.
He formed a three-member military junta that annulled the 1965 constitution dissolved Congress, and suspended all political parties. After a few months, he dismissed his junta colleagues and assumed the &quot;de facto&quot; title of President of the Republic; in his inaugural address, Ríos Montt – a lay pastor in the evangelical Protestant Church of the Word – stated that his presidency resulted from the will of God.

The country&#x27;s guerrilla forces and their leftist allies denounced Ríos Montt, who sought to defeat the guerrilla insurgency with a combination of military action and economic reforms; in his words, &quot;beans and rifles&quot; &quot;(frijoles y fusiles)&quot;.
An army officer was quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of 18 July 1982 (the exact day of the Plan de Sánchez killings) as telling an audience of indigenous people in Cunén, in the department of El Quiché, that: &quot;If you are with us, we&#x27;ll feed you; if not, we&#x27;ll kill you.&quot;

The government began to form local &quot;civilian self-defence patrols&quot; (the paramilitary forces known as &quot;patrullas de autodefensa civil&quot; or PACs). Participation was, in theory, voluntary, but in practice, many &quot;campesinos,&quot; especially in the north-west, had no choice but to join either the PACs or the guerrillas. The country&#x27;s conscript army, supported by the PACs, recaptured practically all the guerrilla-held territory – guerrilla activity lessened and was mostly limited to hit-and-run operations. However, this partial victory was won at an enormous cost in civilian deaths.

Ríos Montt&#x27;s brief presidency was probably the most violent period of the 36-year internal conflict, which resulted in about 200,000 deaths of mostly unarmed, mostly indigenous civilians.
Although leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads also engaged in summary executions, forced disappearances, and torture of non-combatants, the vast majority of human rights violations were carried out by the military and the PACs they controlled. The internal conflict is described in great detail in the report of the Historical Clarification Commission &quot;(Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico,&quot; or CEH), which estimates that government forces and their paramilitary confederates were responsible for 93% of the violations.

On 8 August 1983, Ríos Montt was deposed by his own Minister of Defence, Gen. Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores, who succeeded him as &quot;de facto&quot; president of Guatemala. Victims of the period, organised in the &quot;Asociación para Justicia y Reconciliación&quot; (AJR) and their legal representatives the &quot;Centro para Acción Legal en Derechos Humanos&quot; (CALDH) brought a criminal case against Ríos Montt in 2001. He was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in a national court in May 2013. The status of the conviction is unclear following intervention by the Constitutional Court.

==Local context==
The central Guatemalan department of Baja Verapaz comprises eight municipalities, one of which is Rabinal (), some 70 km to the north of Guatemala City. In 1982, the municipality was made up of the municipal seat of Rabinal town, along with another 14 villages and 60 hamlets. Among the villages was Plan de Sánchez, located in a hilly woodland area some 9 km from the town of Rabinal. The local inhabitants were overwhelmingly Achi Maya Native Americans. Achi is one of the 21 varieties of the Maya language recognised in Guatemala; according to a 2002 government census, it was spoken by some 105,000 people in the Baja Verapaz highlands.

==The events of July 1982==

Since early 1982, the inhabitants of the area had been facing increasing pressure from the 
authorities. Many of the local men had refused to participate in the self-defence patrols and, as a result, the military kept a strong presence in the area. Many men fled their homes for the mountains, leaving the womenfolk and children behind. Others had already, before the massacre, filed formal complaints – reporting the armed forces&#x27; constant threatening behaviour and harassment – with the justice of the peace in Rabinal, but these allegations were never investigated; on the contrary, the men who lodged the complaints were fined.

In early July 1982, a military aircraft flew over the village and dropped a number of bombs on areas close to several homes. On 15 July, an army detachment set up camp in the village and began house-to-house inspections, asking after the menfolk and threatening the villagers.

Sunday, 18 July, was market-day in Rabinal. The pathways and roads of the municipality were, from an early hour, crowded with people from local villages and farms taking their goods to market. The village of Plan de Sánchez was one of several settlements crisscrossed by the network of routes leading to the municipal seat.

At around 08:00 that Sunday morning, soldiers at the military detachment fired two 105-mm mortar shells at the village. One of these landed to the east of the main group of houses; the other to the west. Later that same day, between 14:00 and 15:00, a military detachment arrived in Plan de Sánchez.
This force of some 60 men – comprising regular army (led by a captain and a lieutenant), PAC patrolmen, police, and civilians dressed in military fatigues and armed with assault rifles – 
took up stations at the village&#x27;s points of entry and exit, heading off people from other settlements returning from market. Others went from house to house, gathering the inhabitants together. At this point, some of the men succeeded in fleeing the round-up and took to the surrounding woods and hills.

The younger women were sent to one house, with the men, children, and older women directed to another. A group of around twenty of the younger women (aged between 12 and 20) were separated from the main group and taken to another building; there, they were humiliated, accused of supporting the guerrillas, beaten, and raped. A handful of these women managed to escape and take refuge in the surrounding countryside, while the remainder were killed.

The children were separated from the main group and beaten and kicked to death. Then, at around 
17:00, the soldiers threw two hand grenades into the house where the adults were being held and began spraying the walls with automatic gunfire. Residents of nearby villages and those from Plan de Sánchez who was observing the massacre from vantage points in the surrounding hills report that intense gunfire continued until about 20:00 when the army set fire to the buildings. The armed forces finally left the village at around 23:00.

The next morning, some of those who had fled returned to the smoking ruins of their village. None of the bodies in the houses could be identified; many of the others who had fallen in the yards adjacent to the houses had bullet holes in their heads, chests, and backs, but identification of these victims was made difficult because dogs and other animals had partially devoured many of the charred corpses.

At around 15:00 on that Monday, two military commissioners and a squad of PAC patrolmen arrived in Plan de Sánchez and ordered the survivors to dig graves and bury the victims&#x27; remains, threatening them that the air force would bombard the village if they failed to comply. More than 20 clandestine communal graves were dug and filled. Meanwhile, the patrolmen ransacked the houses that had not been burned down, stealing personal property and livestock and destroying identification papers.

===Witness testimony===



==Aftermath==
Over the ensuing months, because of regular visits by the army during which they were threatened, harassed, and intimidated, most of the survivors abandoned the village for the mountains, other towns and villages, or Guatemala City. In 1985, they began to trickle back and were allowed to resettle in Plan de Sánchez and work their land, provided that they served in the PACs and remained subject at all times to military oversight. By 1987, some 20 families were again living in the village, albeit under strict orders from the military not to discuss the massacre. The harassment and threats from the military and paramilitaries continued, and the requirement that they patrol with the PACs was enforced until the peace accords were signed and the civilian self-defence patrols were dissolved in 1996.

===Witness testimony===
:The militarisation of Plan de Sánchez prevented them from continuing their ancestral traditions. Before the massacre, they performed individual and private ceremonies, called &quot;devotions&quot;. Several of the older men were responsible for officiating these acts, but many of them died in the massacre and their knowledge could not be transmitted to the new generations… Owing to the repression exercised by the Army and the obligation for the young men to do military service, the latter lost their faith, their devotion for the traditions and knowledge of their ancestors, and did not want to continue the traditions… They performed a few Mayan ceremonies very infrequently because the military agents did not allow these rites, alleging that they were practicing witchcraft against their enemies.&quot;
:: – Benjamín Manuel Jerónimo, Inter-American Court&#x27;s reparations judgement.

:The witness was obliged to enlist in the Army for 30 months. On 31 October 1987, he left the military barracks to return to Plan de Sánchez… [and] was obliged to join the patrol again. The men who survived found second wives among women from other communities, because very few women were left in Plan de Sánchez after the massacre.&quot;
:: – Buenaventura Manuel Jerónimo, Inter-American Court&#x27;s reparations judgement.

:The older people who were responsible for officiating the Mayan ceremonies died in the massacre and the traditions died with them, because the young people did not have anyone to teach them… Military agents and the patrols monitored every meeting, so that they were afraid to hold their religious ceremonies. No one could speak freely or discuss the situation of repression and violence in which the community lived.&quot;
:: – Eulalio Grave Ramírez, Inter-American Court&#x27;s reparations judgement.

==Death toll==
Years later, the petition lodged with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights by the survivors and next-of-kin set the death toll of the massacre at 268,
and the Guatemalan state, in the later supranational proceedings, admitted its responsibility in that number of killings.
However, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights published a list of named victims that numbered only 170,
and various other reports on the incident quote figures of between 150 and 200. Forensic anthropologists working on the massacre site have exhumed fewer than 100 sets of remains.

The discrepancies in the various figures can be attributed to several factors: first of all, entire families were killed, and many of the survivors were subsequently scattered across the country. The absence of relatives made tallying the dead more difficult, as did the severe warnings the villagers received in the immediately ensuing years about what would happen if they discussed the massacre. The fact that many of the victims were burnt alive in a single, small enclosure complicated the identification of remains and, to date, it is not certain that all the clandestine graves in the vicinity of Plan de Sánchez have been found.

==Domestic legal proceedings==
On 10 December 1992, a group of villagers reported the existence of a clandestine grave in Plan de Sánchez and, on 7 May 1993, Ramiro de León Carpio, the country&#x27;s human rights ombudsman &quot;(Procurador de los Derechos Humanos),&quot; lodged an official accusation with the public prosecution service, reporting the massacre that had taken place 11 years earlier.

A criminal investigation was begun by an investigating magistrate in Salamá, Baja Verapaz, and, on 8 June 1994, the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Team (EAFG) began examining the clandestine graves in the community. Two months later, the forensic anthropologists had exhumed a total of 84 corpses from 21 graves. An additional grave site was identified during the field work and, once the legal formalities had been met, the EAFG was able to examine it, and exhume four sets of human remains, in August 1996.

On 2 September 1996, Ombudsman Jorge Mario García Laguardia issued a historic resolution in which he denounced the massacre of Plan de Sánchez (and two others that took place in Rabinal the same year: Chichupac and Río Negro) as crimes against humanity, laid the blame for them firmly at the feet of the government and the military, and said that they had been carried out as part of a premeditated state policy.

In May 1997, the villagers named as plaintiffs in the criminal investigation gave the authorities a list of names of soldiers and patrolmen who had been involved in the massacre.
In June 1997, their legal representatives the &quot;Centro para Acción Legal en Derechos Humanos&quot; (CALDH) requested ballistic tests on the spent cartridges found in the graves; the ballistic material was reported as &quot;lost&quot; by the prosecution service and did not resurface until February 2000.

Following sustained efforts by victims and CALDH, and the appointment of a new Attorney General in Guatemala, five direct perpetrators were convicted in domestic criminal proceedings and in October 2012 their conviction was upheld on appeal.

==Supranational legal proceedings==

In October 1996, faced with constant delays and other irregularities in the domestic proceedings, the survivors instructed their legal representatives in both national and supranational proceedings, the Centro para Acción Legal en Derechos Humanos (CALDH), to lodge a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). The IACHR is the agency of the Organisation of American States charged with overseeing the American Convention on Human Rights, a continental human rights instrument that Guatemala ratified in 1978, and responsible for ensuring justice for victims of human rights abuses when domestic legal systems fail.

In their filing, they accused the Guatemalan state of violating the victims&#x27; human rights by allowing its agents to kill civilian men, women, and children and by failing to respond to that situation with measures of judicial protection and guarantees. Guatemala replied to the petition by stating that during the armed conflict both parties committed abuses, and that events such as those in Plan de Sánchez stand as testimony to that fact. It went on to say, however, that the villagers&#x27; petition was inadmissible since it had been presented extemporaneously and because the jurisdictional remedies offered by the domestic courts had not yet been exhausted. The petitioners countered that they had attempted to exhaust the domestic remedies, but had been prevented from so doing by excessive procedural delays on the part of the state&#x27;s judicial officers. Finding for the petitioners, the Commission declared the case admissible on 11 March 1999.

On 9 August 2000, during (failed) negotiations between the state, the petitioners, and the commission with a view to reaching a friendly settlement of this case and others, President Alfonso Portillo admitted the state&#x27;s &quot;institutional responsibility&quot; for the massacre. 
On 28 February 2002, the IACHR issued a resolution recommending that the Guatemalan government:
# Conduct a serious investigation to prosecute and punish those who perpetrated and masterminded the massacre.
# Make reparations (including but not limited to financial compensation) to the survivors of the massacre, to the next-of-kin of the dead, and to the village as a community.
# Take steps to ensure that similar incidents did not occur in the future.
Two months later, after consulting with the petitioners, the Inter-American Commission referred the case to the contentious jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.

Guatemala first lodged three exceptions with the Court, arguing, &quot;inter alia,&quot; that the case was not admissible because the available domestic remedies had not been exhausted and that the scope of President Portillo&#x27;s admission of responsibility had been misconstrued. At the Court&#x27;s public hearing on 23 April 2004, however, the state withdrew those exceptions. It then repeated the admission of responsibility extended by Alfonso Portillo in August 2000 and admitted that it had violated the human rights enshrined in Articles 1, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 21, 21, 24, and 25 of the American Convention on Human Rights. It asked the victims for their forgiveness and expressed its willingness to make full amends. Guatemala did not, however, address the charges of genocide levelled at it by the Commission in its application to the Court, since that particular crime against humanity was not covered by the convention. The Court accepted the state&#x27;s admission of guilt, issued a judgement to that effect on 29 April 2004,
and proceeded with the reparations phase.

On 19 November 2004, the Inter-American Court issued its reparations judgement.
In order to make full redress to the survivors of the massacre and to the next-of-kin of those who were killed, Guatemala was ordered to make compensatory payments to those individuals totalling US$7,996,836 – the highest award ever given by the Court.

In addition to the monetary redress, the Court ordered the state to fulfill its legal duties, undertake various infrastructure projects in the locality, and realise various symbolic acts of reparation and reconciliation:

* Conduct a proper investigation of the massacre, and identify and punish the guilty.
* Organise a ceremony in Plan de Sánchez at which high-ranking government officials would recognise the state&#x27;s responsibility and honour the memory of the dead, to be covered by the media and conducted in both Spanish and Achi Maya.
* Translate the American Convention on Human Rights and the Court&#x27;s two judgements into Achi Maya.
* Publish key sections of those judgements in its official gazette and in a major national newspaper (in both languages).
* Pay USD $25,000 for the upkeep of the village&#x27;s memorial chapel to the massacre victims.
* Build houses in the village.
* Provide the survivors with any medical and psychological care they might require – free of charge, including medicines and supplies.
* In addition to regular budgeted government spending:
** Promote the study and awareness of the Achi Maya language and culture in the affected communities.
** Improve the municipality&#x27;s road network, drinking water supply, and sewerage systems.
** Provide the communities with qualified, bilingual schoolteachers.
** Set up a health clinic in Plan de Sánchez and a health centre in the town of Rabinal.
All these items were to be completed within five years of the Court&#x27;s judgement, with the state submitting annual progress reports until completion.
Guatemala was also ordered to pay US$55,000 in costs.

The public ceremony required by the judgement was held in Plan de Sánchez on 18 July 2005, the 23rd anniversary of the massacre. It was attended by representatives of the government, led by Vice President Eduardo Stein, delegations from the IACHR and the International Centre for Human Rights Research (CIIDH), as well as survivors and relatives of the victims. During the ceremony, Stein apologised for the actions of the army, which had &quot;unleashed bloodshed and fire to wipe out an entire community&quot;.

==Prosecution of soldiers and paramilitary members==

Courts in Guatemala convicted five members of a paramilitary organization, Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil, of murder in the 1982 massacre. Each of the five were sentenced to 7710 years in prison on 21 March 2012.

<text>Kramarov is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It lies just beyond the western limb, at the far edge of the region that is brought into view during favorable librations. The crater is situated in the northern part of the Montes Cordillera, the outer ring of the mountains that surround Mare Orientale.

In the past this crater was designated Lents K, a satellite of Lents which lies to the northwest, before being named by the IAU. Just to the southeast is another satellite crater, Lents J. Kramarov is a circular, bowl-shaped crater that lies amidst a region of rugged terrain. The inner walls slope down to a wide interior floor that occupies about two-thirds the total diameter of the crater. It is otherwise an undistinguished formation that has suffered little erosion and has no features of particular interest.

<text>Vatolaivy is a small village that belongs to the municipality of Arivonimamo II, 70 km west of Antananarivo, Madagascar.

There are catholic and Protestant churches, a primary school, shops, a market place, a hostel and restaurant, and a sport area.

Around this little village there are plots of the natural forest of typical endemic species Uapaca bojeri, commonly known as &quot;Tapia&quot; forests. 
These forests supplies the village with fruits, champignons and wild silk.

These plots of forests are now under transferred management to local communities. This process called GELOSE is set to help for their conservation. these &quot;native trees&quot; are used to feed silkworm and thus to produce raw material for weavers and handcraft maker. The end products provides external incomes for these communities.

<text>The Football Federation Islamic Republic of Iran (FFIRI; , &quot;Fadrasion fotbal Jamehori Eslami Iran&quot;) is the governing body for football in Iran. It was founded in 1920. The federation has been a member of FIFA since 1948 and a member of the Asian Football Confederation since 1958.

==History==
In 2001, Iran were founding members of the West Asian Football Federation, along with Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria.

==Controversies==
On 23 November 2006, the federation was suspended by FIFA, due to government interference in football matters. FIFA rules decree that a national football federation should remain autonomous from the national government. However, on 17 December 2006, the ban was lifted and a new Transitory Board was composed.

During the 2009 Iranian election protests, seven members of the Iran national football team were initially reported to have been banned for life by the federation for wearing green armbands in support of the Iranian Green Movement.

Iran women&#x27;s national football team was briefly suspended by FIFA from international competition in 2011 for being required by the federation to wear headscarves.

In 2014, Iran joined the Central Asian Football Association.

In 2015, the federation banned players from the men&#x27;s national team due to conscription problems.

In August 2017, the federation banned Masoud Shojaei and Ehsan Hajsafi from the national team after they played against the Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in the UEFA Europa League.

On 9 November 2018 Fatma Samoura, Secretary General of International Federation of Football Association FIFA said she would ask Iranian government to end ban on women&#x27;s entry to sport stadiums. On 7 August 2019, Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, prosecutor general of Iran, supporting the ban, said that it should not concern FIFA, if women in Iran can enter sports stadiums or not. However, after continuous pressure from FIFA, IRNA deputy Sports Minister Jamshid Taghizadeh said, women would be allowed to enter Azadi Stadium to watch the men&#x27;s World Cup 2022 qualifier match between Iran and Cambodia in October. However, in March 2022, Iranian women were again banned from entering the stadium for a World Cup qualifier.

During the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, the Iranian government and federation reportedly sent paid members of the Basij and IRGC to cheer for the team in the stands and to counter protesters.

In April 2024, goalkeeper Hossein Hosseini was summoned, suspended, and fined by the Iranian federation for hugging a female fan. In October 2024, Zahra Ghanbari was suspended and forced to apologize by the Iranian federation for &quot;improper hijab&quot; during a goal celebration at the 2024–25 AFC Women&#x27;s Champions League. In December 2024, defender Ramin Rezaeian was summoned by the federation as well after hugging a female fan.

<doc id="1262868" wikidata="Q964322" url="?curid=1262868" title="Antony Hopkins">
<text>Antony Hopkins (born Ernest William Antony Reynolds; 21 March 1921 – 6 May 2014) was a composer, pianist, and conductor, as well as a writer and radio broadcaster. He was widely known for his books of musical analysis and for his radio programmes &quot;Talking About Music&quot;, broadcast by the BBC from 1954 for approaching 40 years, first on the Third Programme, later Radio 3, and then on Radio 4.

==Life and career==
Hopkins was born Ernest William Antony Reynolds in London. Following the death of Antony&#x27;s father in 1925, the headmaster at Berkhamsted School, Major Thomas Hopkins, and his wife volunteered to take the five-year-old Antony under a joint guardianship agreement; seven years later they officially adopted him, and his surname was changed to Hopkins. In 1937 he went to a summer school for pianists in Schwaz on the Innthal in Austria, where, hearing a performance of Schubert&#x27;s Op. 90 Impromptus, D. 899, he was inspired with the desire to become a musician.

Hopkins entered the Royal College of Music (RCM) in 1939, where he studied harmony with Harold Darke and composition with Gordon Jacob. After an unsatisfactory start in his piano studies, he left his teacher to study under Cyril Smith. He also studied organ (though he described himself as &quot;the world&#x27;s worst organist&quot;). He won several scholarships as well as the Chappell Gold Medal for piano and the Cobbett Competition for chamber music composition. While still studying at the RCM, he became involved with the choir at Morley College, conducted by Michael Tippett who also gave Hopkins informal lessons in composition. In 1944 Tippett passed to Hopkins the job of composing incidental music for a production of &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; at the Liverpool Playhouse; following its success, Louis MacNeice asked Hopkins to write incidental music for a radio play. For the next 15 years, Hopkins earned his living mostly from composing.

Hopkins&#x27;s first opera, &quot;Lady Rohesia&quot; (1947), based on the Ingoldsby Legends supposedly of sixteenth-century England, was staged at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in 1948. His other operas include &quot;The Man from Tuscany&quot;, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; (1953), and &quot;Hands Across the Sky&quot;. Other works include the ballet &quot;Café des Sports&quot;; and &quot;Scena&quot; for soprano and strings (which was later arranged for three solo voices and full orchestra). Hopkins also wrote extensively for films, including &quot;Here Come the Huggetts&quot; (1948), &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1952), &quot;Johnny on the Run&quot; (1953), &quot;The Angel Who Pawned Her Harp&quot; (1954), &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; (1954), &quot;Cast a Dark Shadow&quot; (1955), &quot;The Blue Peter&quot; (1955), &quot;Seven Thunders&quot; (1957), and &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (1962).

In November 1953, Hopkins gave a BBC radio talk in which he explained, using musical examples, the intricacies of a Bach fugue. Martin Armstrong in &quot;The Listener&quot; magazine described Hopkins&#x27;s programme as &quot;a pyrotechnic display, by which I mean not flashy but brilliant – it did not seem to promise amusing entertainment, yet this was what Mr Hopkins&#x27;s half-hour analysis was&quot;. A producer of the BBC Third Programme, Roger Fiske, subsequently offered Hopkins carte blanche to do whatever he wanted on the radio: Hopkins suggested a half-hour programme on talking about works to be broadcast in the coming week. The resulting series, &quot;Talking About Music&quot;, ran from 1954 to 1992, and was syndicated to 44 countries.

In the 1970s, he revived the long forgotten oratorio &quot;Ruth&quot; (infamous as &quot;the Worst Oratorio in the World&quot;) by the English composer George Tolhurst; this was heard again in 2009 on the BBC Radio 3 programme &quot;The Choir&quot;. From 1952 he was Artistic Director of the Intimate Opera Company, being replaced by Stephen Manton in 1963 though remaining a director and as music adviser of the company. From 1959 until his death he was President of Luton Music Club, and also from 1994 President of Radlett Music Club.

==Personal life==
Hopkins was appointed a CBE in 1976 for his services to music. He died on 6 May 2014, in Ashridge, Hertfordshire in England. He was survived by his second wife, Beatrix née Taylor. His first wife, Alison Purves, whom he married in 1947, died in 1991.

<doc id="1262884" wikidata="Q1475695" url="?curid=1262884" title="Sōhei">
<text>were Buddhist warrior monks of both classical and feudal Japan. At certain points in history, they held considerable power, obliging the imperial and military governments to collaborate.

The prominence of the &quot;sōhei&quot; rose in parallel with the ascendancy of the Tendai school&#x27;s influence between the 10th and 17th centuries. The warriors protected land and intimidated rival schools of Buddhism, becoming a significant factor in the spread of Buddhism and the development of different schools during the Kamakura period.

The &quot;sōhei&quot; shared many similarities with the European lay brothers, members of a monastic order who might not have been ordained. Much like the Teutonic Order, the warrior monks of the Holy Roman Empire, and the crusading orders, &quot;sōhei&quot; did not operate as individuals, or even as members of small, individual temples, but rather as warriors in a large extended brotherhood or monastic order. The home temple of a &quot;sōhei&quot; monastic order might have had several, if not dozens or a hundred, smaller monasteries, training halls, and subordinate temples connected to it. A famous &quot;sōhei&quot; monastery is Enryaku-ji on Mount Hiei, just outside Kyoto, while Kōfuku-ji in Nara also fielded a large &quot;sōhei&quot; army.

Warrior monks first appeared during the Heian period, when bitter political feuds began between different temples, different subsects of Buddhism, over imperial appointments to the top temple positions in the sōkan system (&quot;zasu&quot; or Buddhist abbot). Much of the fighting over the next four centuries was over these sorts of political feuds, and centered around the temples of Kyoto, Nara, and Ōmi, namely the Tōdai-ji, Kōfuku-ji, Enryaku-ji, and Mii-dera, the four largest temples in the country.

The first armed conflict broke out in 949, when 56 monks from Tōdai-ji staged a protest at the residence of a Kyoto official, over an appointment that displeased them. Protests of this sort continued through the 10th century, often breaking out into brawls in which some participants would be killed. In 970, following a dispute between Enryaku-ji and the Yasaka Shrine of Kyoto, the former established the first standing army of warrior monks. It is not entirely clear whether this standing army consisted of monks from Enryaku-ji or was more like a mercenary army, since Ryōgen, the abbot who established this army, also established a code of monastic conduct that prevented monks from leaving Mount Hiei during their twelve-year training, from covering their faces, and from carrying weapons.

Beginning in 981, there were a number of armed conflicts between Enryaku-ji and Mii-dera, each the head temple of a different sub-sect of Tendai. These disputes were, as before, over political appointments and dishonorable etiquette. More often than not, these were cases of members of one faction being chosen as the abbot of the other faction&#x27;s temple, and the monks would protest. This continued, on and off, once stopping for as long as 40 years, through the 11th and into the 12th century. The armies became larger and the violence increased, until in 1121 and 1141 Mii-dera was burned to the ground by monks from Enryaku-ji. Other temples became embroiled in the conflicts as well, and Enryaku-ji and Mii-dera united against Kōfuku-ji, and, another time, against Kiyomizu-dera.

===Genpei War===

At the end of the 12th century, Japan was plunged into the Genpei War and, while the feuds between the temples did not end, they became subsumed by larger events. The warring Minamoto and Taira clans both tried to obtain the aid of the warrior monks of Nara and Kyoto, adding the temples&#x27; forces to the clans&#x27; already mighty armies of samurai.

Taira no Kiyomori sent generous gifts of rice and silk to Enryaku-ji, ensuring they would not help his enemies, the Minamoto, who had allied themselves with the monks of Mii-dera. In the Battle of Uji in 1180, one of the more famous battles in which &quot;sōhei&quot; participated, the monks of Mii-dera, along with a force of Minamoto samurai, tried to defend the bridge over the Uji River, and the Byōdō-in, a temple behind it, from an attacking Taira force. The monks pulled up the planks of the bridge to impair the ability of the horse mounted samurai to cross. The warrior monks stood their ground with bow and arrow, &quot;naginata,&quot; sword and dagger, but were ultimately defeated. Following his victory, Taira no Kiyomori ordered that revenge be taken upon the monks that opposed him. Mii-dera was burned to the ground once again, as were many of the temples of Nara. Only the Enryaku-ji escaped unscathed.

Three years later, when Minamoto no Yoshinaka betrayed his clan by storming into Kyoto, setting the Hōjōji Palace aflame and kidnapping Emperor Go-Shirakawa, he was opposed by many of the monks of Kyoto, including those from Mount Hiei.

===13th–14th centuries and the rise of Zen===

Following the Genpei War, the monasteries, to a large extent, turned their attention to rebuilding, first physically, and then politically. Their political influence grew stronger through peaceful means, and the warrior monks played only very minor roles in the wars of the 13th and 14th centuries. Violent conflict between the temples still occurred on occasion, once again over political and spiritual appointments, and related matters.

During the wars of the Nanboku-chō period, Mount Hiei took in the rebel Emperor Go-Daigo, and offered him sanctuary. Emperor Go-Daigo, along with his son, and the help of the &quot;sōhei&quot; of Mount Hiei, launched a brief rebellion against the Kamakura shogunate. The Ashikaga shogunate took power shortly afterwards, and supported Zen over the other Buddhist sects, drawing the ire of the warrior monks. Over the course of the 1340s–1360s a number of conflicts erupted between the Tendai sect temples, and those of Zen, especially Nanzen-ji.

===Sengoku-jidai and the rise of the Ikkō-Ikki===

The Ōnin War, starting in 1467, was the prelude to over a century of civil war in Japan, and the stimulus for a reorganization of the warrior monks. Unlike the Jōkyū War and Mongol invasions of the 13th century, the Ōnin War was fought primarily in Kyoto, and thus the warrior monks could no longer remain non-violent and neutral.

In addition, a new breed of warrior monks was forming in the countryside. Where the monks of Mount Hiei had subscribed to the teachings of the Tendai sect, these new groups, calling themselves Ikkō-ikki, followed the dictates of the Jōdo Shinshū sect of beliefs. They were essentially coalitions of religious fundamentalist priests, farmers, and families, who were willing to literally fight for their beliefs. &quot;Ikkō-ikki&quot; translates to something like &quot;devoted league&quot;, but also had the connotation of &quot;single-minded riots&quot;. In 1488, their leader Rennyo, incited an uprising against samurai rule, and secured Kaga Province for the Ikkō-ikki. From there they spread, establishing themselves in Nagashima, Ishiyama Hongan-ji, and Mikawa Province. Their growing power base was eventually to attract the attention of warlords like Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, who recognized their opposition to samurai rule, their determination, their strength, and their numbers.

Tokugawa Ieyasu attacked the Ikkō-ikki of Mikawa in 1564, in the Battle of Azukizaka, and failed to defeat the Ikkō-ikki, but returned shortly afterwards with a contingent of warrior monks from his own religious sect, Jōdo-shū, and, after defeating the Ikkō adherents in battle, burned all their temples to the ground. As Oda Nobunaga rose to power at the end of the 1560s, the monks of Enryaku-ji regained their military might, and fought a number of skirmishes in the streets of Kyoto against a new rival sect, Nichiren Buddhism. They eventually burned all of Kyoto&#x27;s Nichiren temples to the ground, and then sought allies among the local lords (&quot;daimyō&quot;). Unfortunately for them, the Azai and Asakura clans they allied with were enemies of Oda Nobunaga. Beginning on September 29, 1571, Nobunaga&#x27;s army of 30,000 led the Siege of Mount Hiei, destroying Enryaku-ji and massacring thousands. Though it was rebuilt, the standing army of warrior monks would never be reconstituted after this devastation.

Nobunaga then moved on to fighting the Ikkō-ikki in their fortresses of Nagashima and Ishiyama Hongan-ji (see Sieges of Nagashima, Ishiyama Hongan-ji War). In the summer of 1574, with the help of former pirate Kuki Yoshitaka, Nobunaga essentially blockaded the Ikkō fortresses and starved them into submission. The 20,000 inhabitants of the fortress went up in flames along with their home. Two years later, Nobunaga returned to the Ishiyama Hongan-ji, which he had failed to take earlier. At the two Battles of Kizugawaguchi, Nobunaga defeated his enemies, the Mōri clan, who had naval control over the area. The Ikkō were finally forced to surrender in 1580.

In the 1580s and 1590s, various factions of warrior monks sided with either Tokugawa Ieyasu or his rival Toyotomi Hideyoshi, fighting in a number of battles and skirmishes. When Tokugawa Ieyasu finally defeated the last of his enemies and took control of the country in 1603, the time of the warrior monks finally came to an end.

==Weapons and dress==
&quot;Sōhei&quot; were quite varied in their armament. The &quot;naginata&quot; is the weapon most often associated with them, though in legend as well as history many warrior monks are known to have been proficient with everything from &quot;yari&quot;, &quot;yumi&quot;, &quot;tachi&quot;, and &quot;tantō&quot;. Many fought on horseback, and many with the &quot;ō-yoroi&quot; armor of the samurai.

Warrior monks, like most other Buddhist monks of related sects, wore a series of kimono-like robes in layers, one over the other, usually white underneath, and tan or saffron yellow on top; this style has changed very little since the introduction of Buddhism to Japan in the 7th century. Footwear traditionally consisted of &quot;tabi&quot; socks and &quot;geta&quot; (wooden clogs), or &quot;waraji&quot; (straw sandals). Warrior monks would often fold and tie the white headcowl to cover more of their head, or would substitute a &quot;hachimaki&quot; headband. Finally, many warrior monks would wear some form of samurai armor.

The &quot;sōhei&quot; employed a variety of weapons. The &quot;obi&quot;, or belt, of the kimono would often be supplemented with a heavier sash, so a sword could be slung from it. The long &quot;tachi&quot; was probably the most common sword, though many monks may have carried &quot;tantō&quot; as well. Many monks were also accomplished archers, and used bamboo-and-rattan bows, called &quot;daikyū,&quot; with bamboo arrows. The most traditional weapon of the monk, however, was the &quot;naginata&quot;, a weapon much like the Chinese guandao or podao, European glaive or the Russian sovnya. The &quot;sōhei&quot; were also trained to use the heavy kanabō, large clubs of studded wood or iron.

The Ikkō-ikki monks of the 16th century, due largely to their origins as countryside mobs, were far more varied in their armor and armament. Many wore the more traditional monk robes, with varying degrees and types of armor. Many wore various sorts of helmets, while many others opted for the straw hat and cloak of a peasant. &quot;Naginata&quot; remained very common, along with a variety of swords and daggers, and a limited number of arquebuses (with the Saika Ikki being a notable exception, as they are mainly composed of musketeers and gunsmiths as per Suzuki Magoichi&#x27;s standard of having an all-musketeer army). Finally, while not truly armor nor armament, a very common item wielded by the mobs of Ikkō-ikki monk warriors was a banner with a Buddhist slogan written upon it. One of the more common slogans was the nenbutsu, &quot;Hail Amitābha!&quot; (&quot;Namu Amida Butsu&quot;).

<doc id="1262897" wikidata="Q745437" url="?curid=1262897" title="Maclaurin (crater)">
<text>Maclaurin is a lunar impact crater that is located in the eastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It lies just to the southeast of the small Mare Spumans, and to the northeast of the prominent crater Langrenus. To the east-southeast is Gilbert.

The rim of this crater is perhaps unusual for the number of lesser craters attached to the exterior. Along the northern rim are the lava-flooded Maclaurin O and Maclaurin K. There are also satellite craters along the northeastern, eastern, and southern walls. The only open stretches of rim are along the western side, and a brief stretch to the southeast. The three craters along the southern rim, which include Maclaurin A and Maclaurin N, have intruded into the formation sufficiently to compress and slightly flatten that end of the crater. But overall it retains a generally circular form.

The inner walls cut down to a gently descending slope that extends toward the flattened midsection. The middle portion of the interior floor has been resurfaced, possibly by basaltic lava, leaving a lower albedo patch with a slightly darkened hue. At the midpoint of the crater interior is a low central ridge.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Maclaurin.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Maclaurin F — &quot;See&quot; Von Behring
* Maclaurin R — &quot;See&quot; Morley

<text>The David Suzuki Foundation is a science-based non-profit environmental organization headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with offices in Montreal and Toronto. It was established as a federally registered Canadian charity on January 1, 1991. By 2007, it had 40,000 donors. Its mission is to protect nature while balancing human needs. It is supported entirely by Foundation grants and donations and by 2012, 90% of its donors were Canadian. By 2007, the Foundation employed about seventy-five staff members.

==Overview==
In 1989, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired a radio series by David Suzuki , entitled &quot;It&#x27;s a Matter of Survival&quot; which was published in a co-authored 1990 book by the same name. In the series and the book, described how the &quot;first global scientific consensus&quot; that the world was &quot;entering an era of unprecedented climate change&quot; had emerged in the June 1988 international Toronto Conference on the Changing Atmosphere chaired by Stephen Lewis, and with 300 scientists from around the world in attendance. The foundation was formed in response to a 1989 meeting organized by David Suzuki and Tara Cullis with about a dozen invited guests who wanted to work towards reversing global climate change. The Foundation was incorporated on September 14, 1990. Suzuki stepped down from the Board of Directors of the Foundation in April 2012—his wife, Tara Cullis, serves as president of the Board.

According to the Foundation&#x27;s website its goal is to investigate, communicate and support work that balances &quot;human needs&quot; with the planet&#x27;s capacity to &quot;sustain all life&quot;. 
While concerned with Canada and Canadians, its focus is on four regions—Ontario and Northern Region, Quebec/Francophone, B.C. and the Western Region. The main areas of concern include the protection of the climate, transformation of the economy, encouraging a reconnection with nature, and community-building.

The Foundation publishes information related to their advocacy work through newsletters, scientific studies, research reports, books, information kits, brochures, and news releases. Some of their major projects included the Trottier Energy Futures Project, Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Seafood which provided a ranking of seafood options published on SeaChoice.org, The Saint Lawrence: Our Living River, the Natural Capital Evaluation, Habitat Protection and Endangered Species, Connecting Youth with Nature, and Living Green (formerly “Queen of Green”).

=== Funding===
The Foundation was established on January 1, 1991, as a federally registered Canadian charity and is supported entirely by Foundation grants and donations. It does not accept any government funding, except from the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. It is also not a funding body for other organizations.

All financial and donor information is publicly available on their official website and through the publication of their annual reports. In their 2006 report they said that about 75% of their 40,000 supporters, donated less than $500. In the FY 2012, they reported that 59% of their funding came from individual donors. Foundations and businesses provided another 25% and 13% respectively and that more than 95% of the donors were Canadian.

According to their 2005-2006 annual report, there were 40,000 donors to the Suzuki Foundation including 52 corporations—Bell Canada, Toyota, IBM, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Scotia Capital, Warner Bros., Canon and the Bank of Montreal.

After the Foundation implemented its Ethical Gift Acceptance Policy, it no longer accepted donations from fossil fuel industry corporate donors as it had in the past. Prior to the Ethical Gift Acceptance Policy, the Foundation had received funding from the EnCana Corporation, a world leader in natural gas production and oil sands development, and ATCO Gas, Alberta&#x27;s principal distributor of natural gas, and OPG which is one of the largest suppliers of electricity in the world operating five fossil fuel-burning generation plants and three nuclear plants.

It is also a partnership of the Taylor Mitchell Legacy Trust, which was started after Taylor Mitchell&#x27;s death from a coyote attack in 2009.

== Activities==

===Nutreco Aquaculture===

The David Suzuki Foundation undertook a &quot;Farmed and Dangerous&quot; campaign about environmental concerns related to the farmed fish industry, with a focus on Nutreco Aquaculture, the largest farmed salmon producer in the world. Vivian Krause, who was hired by Nutreco Aquaculture in 2002 as their North American corporate development manager, actively pursued a public relations campaign to counter criticisms levelled against Nutreco, that had been raised by The David Suzuki Foundation and other environmentalists. Krause accessed publicly available online information related to tax revenue to create spreadsheets on names of donors who funded environmental organizations in Canada, and to publish her findings on her Fair Questions blog. This included the information that the David Suzuki Foundation, had received $44 million from tax receipted donations between 2000 and 2010.

In February 2004, Suzuki met with the Prime Minister of Canada, Paul Martin, to present the Foundation&#x27;s report on how sustainability could be achieved within a generation.&quot;Canada vs the OECD: An Environmental Comparison&quot;, a 2001 report published by University of Victoria Eco-Research Chair of Environmental Law and Policy Staff and authored by David R. Boyd, environmental lawyer and coauthor of the forthcoming book &quot;David Suzuki&#x27;s Guide to Helping the Planet&quot;, examined 25 environmental indicators, ranks Canada 28th out of the 29 OECD nations. The foundation and Boyd created a separate report, &quot;Sustainability within a Generation&quot;, that addresses Canada&#x27;s capacities to improve sustainability and environmental conservation. The foundation believes this can be best accomplished by improving efficiency, eliminating waste and pollution, and building sustainable cities.

The 2000s Nature Challenge, which was established in consultation with the Union of Concerned Scientists encouraged Canadians to reduce home energy use, using energy-efficient appliances and vehicles, drive personal vehicles less by using public transit, biking or walking and by living closer to work or school, buying locally grown food, eat more vegetarian meals, avoid use of pesticides. over 500 000 individuals had taken David Suzuki&#x27;s Nature Challenge. Many famous Canadians have taken David Suzuki&#x27;s Nature Challenge, including Nelly Furtado, Sam Roberts, Margaret Atwood, Robert Munsch, Larry Campbell, and David Miller.

=== &quot;La Rose et al. v. Her Majesty the Queen&quot; ===

On October 25, 2019, The David Suzuki Foundation along with the Our Children&#x27;s Trust and 15 youth activists including Cecilia La Rose, Sierra Robinson and Sáj Gray-Starcevich, launched a federal lawsuit against the Canadian government claiming that the government has violated the youth&#x27;s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The lawsuit asks the Canadian Government to immediately begin reducing Canada&#x27;s green house gas emissions to mitigate the effects of climate change.

== Criticism ==

=== Genetically modified food ===
By the early 2010s, there was a scientific consensus
 that at that time, genetically modified food was as safe as conventional food. WHO clarified that each new GM food introduced needed to be tested on a case-by-case basis.

In 2012, the Foundation&#x27;s 2012 website still allegedly had a page entitled an &quot;Understanding GMO&quot; page which said that at that time, &quot;the safety of GMO foods&quot; was &quot;unproven&quot; and that and a growing body of research&quot; had connected &quot;these foods with health concerns&quot;. This page is no longer hosted on their website.

==Tax emptions status and political activities==
Since at least 2007, concerns have been raised about how much—if any political activity—can charities with tax exemptions undertake. Columnist Licia Corbella, formerly of &quot;The Calgary Sun&quot; is a long-standing critic of the David Suzuki Foundation and is known for denying the existence of human-caused climate change. Writing about Suzuki meeting with Calgary elementary school students, states that the speech &quot;was essentially urging those listening not to vote Conservative. That makes his message partisan and should exempt the David Suzuki Foundation from receiving tax deductible status.&quot; In 2007, Suzuki distinguished between what he says as an individual and what the foundation formally states. His personal opinions have been published, including the statement that Ottawa&#x27;s plan to fight global warming was a &quot;national embarrassment&quot; and the federal government&#x27;s energy policy was &quot;not a strategy&quot; but a &quot;shame.&quot; According to a 2007 article in &quot;Treehugger,&quot; in Canadian law, charities &quot;are&quot; permitted to comment on politics, &quot;Charities have wide latitude to comment on politics, provided they don&#x27;t endorse parties or candidates and can devote up to 10 per cent of their resources for non-partisan political activities&quot;. Charitable organizations can spend funds &quot;to influence law, policy, and public opinion on matters related to its charitable purposes.&quot; This includes meeting with elected officials, holding &quot;conferences, workshops, lectures and rallies&quot;, and mounting &quot;letter-writing campaigns about issues&quot;.

In 2012, when then Prime Minister Stephen Harper was engaged in &quot;scorching attacks on environmental activists and charities.&quot; the federal 2012 budget earmarked $8 million to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to audit selected charities—including seven environmental groups were soon targeted. The CRA budget for these political-activity audits was subsequently increased to $13 million a year which allowed the CRA to audit anti-poverty, foreign aid and human rights groups charities, such as Amnesty International, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, and the United Church of Canada. An investigation by the Canadian Press reported in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in 2014, said that the majority of the ten 2012-2013 political-activity audits were &quot;conducted on charities in one narrow category—environmental groups, all of whom opposed&quot; the Harper administration&#x27;s energy policies.&quot; which included the David Suzuki Foundation. In 2015, an investigation undertaken by the journalist, Mike De Souza, published in the &quot;Narwhal&quot;, showed that a senator who was keenly interested in Krause&#x27;s research on environmental groups, had &quot;worked to advance Krause&#x27;s public persona, introducing her to key figures in the Canadian political and energy landscape&quot;.

<doc id="1262909" wikidata="Q107422" url="?curid=1262909" title="Herbert A. Hauptman">
<text>Herbert Aaron Hauptman (February 14, 1917 – October 23, 2011) was an American mathematician and Nobel laureate. He pioneered and developed a mathematical method that has changed the whole field of chemistry and opened a new era in research in determination of molecular structures of crystallized materials. Today, Hauptman&#x27;s direct methods, which he continued to improve and refine, are routinely used to solve complicated structures. It was the application of this mathematical method to a wide variety of chemical structures that led the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to name Hauptman and Jerome Karle recipients of the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

==Life==
He was born to a Jewish family in New York City, the oldest child of Leah (Rosenfeld) and Israel Hauptman. He was married to Edith Citrynell since November 10, 1940, with two daughters, Barbara (1947) and Carol (1950).

He was interested in science and mathematics from an early age which he pursued at Townsend Harris High School, graduated from the City College of New York (1937) and obtained an M.A. degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1939.

After the war he started a collaboration with Jerome Karle at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., and at the same time enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Maryland, College Park. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland in 1955 in physics, which is part of the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences. This combination of mathematics and physical chemistry expertise enabled them to tackle head-on the phase problem of X-ray crystallography. His work on this problem was criticized because, at the time, the problem was believed unsolvable.
By 1955 he had received his Ph.D. in mathematics, and they had laid the foundations of the direct methods in X-ray crystallography. Their 1953 monograph, &quot;Solution of the Phase Problem I. The Centrosymmetric Crystal&quot;, contained the main ideas, the most important of which was the introduction of probabilistic methods through a development of the Sayre equation.

In 1970 he joined the crystallographic group of the Medical Foundation of Buffalo of which he was research director in 1972. During the early years of this period he formulated the neighborhood principle and extension concept. These theories were further developed during the following decades.

In 2003, as an atheist and secular humanist, he was one of 22 Nobel laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.

==Works==
Hauptman has authored over 170 publications, including journal articles, research papers, chapters and books. In 1970, Hauptman joined the crystallographic group of the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute (formerly the Medical Foundation of Buffalo) of which he became research director in 1972. Until his death, he served as president of the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute as well as research professor in the department of biophysical sciences and adjunct professor in the department of computer science at the University at Buffalo. Prior to coming to Buffalo, he worked as a mathematician and supervisor in various departments at the Naval Research Laboratory from 1947. He received his B.S. from City College of New York, M.A. from Columbia University and Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, College Park.

<doc id="1262910" wikidata="Q1399086" url="?curid=1262910" title="Ur (rune)">
<text>Ur is the recorded name for the rune  in both Old English and Old Norse, found as the second rune in all futharks (runic alphabets starting with F, U, Þ, Ą, R, K), i.e. the Germanic Elder Futhark, the Anglo-Frisian Futhark and the Norse Younger Futhark, with continued use in the later medieval runes, early modern runes and Dalecarlian runes.

It corresponds to the letter u in the Latin alphabet, but also carries other sound values, especially in Younger Futhark, were its sound values correspond to the vowels: , , and etc., and the consonants: and etc., in the Latin alphabet.

== Character ==

The character ᚢ may have been derived from the Old Italic scripts, as such features various characters corresponding to elder runes, including both upside and downside characters for Upsilon (/u, y/): , , specifically the East Rhaetic alphabet from the Magrè-region of north-east Italy, which primarily used the downside Old Italic Upsilon.

The character was later reused as the 16th letter in the Gothic alphabet (𐌿), the corresponding name being &quot;urus&quot;.

== Proto-Germanic name ==
The rune is recorded in all three rune poems (Old English, Norwegian, Icelandic), and it is called Ur in all, however with different meanings in each.

Because of this, it is difficult to reconstruct a Proto-Germanic name for the Elder Futhark rune. It may have been &quot;*ūruz&quot; &quot;aurochs&quot; (see also Bull worship), based on the Old English rune poem, the oldest recorded of the three, supported by the corresponding Gothic name &quot;uraz&quot;, recorded by Alcuin of York in the 8th century, or &quot;*ūrą&quot; &quot;water&quot;, based on the Icelandic rune poems (and to some extent the Norwegian rune poem), with both Proto-Germanic words, however, possibly stemming from the same root.

The aurochs name is preferred by authors of modern runic divination systems, but both seem possible, compared to the names of the other runes: &quot;water&quot; would be comparable to &quot;hail&quot; and &quot;lake&quot;, and &quot;aurochs&quot; to &quot;horse&quot; or &quot;elk&quot; (although the latter name is itself uncertain). The Gothic alphabet seems to support &quot;aurochs&quot; as the prior name, though: as the name of the letter 𐌿 &quot;u&quot; is &quot;urus&quot;.

== Anglo-Saxon name ==
In the Old English rune poem, recorded in the 8th or 9th century, the rune is named &quot;Ūr&quot;, Old English for “aurochs” (compare with ), stemming from a Proto-Germanic word: &quot;*ūruz&quot;. 

;Old English rune poem
== Old Norse name ==
The Old Norse name is variously recorded as &quot;Ur&quot;, meaning some type of cold damp and windy precipitation weather, but the definition warries slightly between the Nordic languages.

In Old Icelandic, the word &quot;úr&quot; is recorded as meaning &quot;drizzle&quot;, &quot;light rain&quot; and thereof, in the sense of &quot;cold and damp weather&quot;. In Old and Contemporary Swedish, the word (&quot;ur&quot;) essentially means &quot;blustery and profuse snowfall, sleet or rain&quot; etc, if not outright &quot;bad weather&quot;. The Gotlandic variation &quot;starur&quot; (&quot;starling-ur&quot;) specifically refers to the last snowfall of the season. In Danish and Norwegian, the word (&quot;ur&quot;) is said to mean &quot;northern rainclouds&quot;, or just &quot;rainclouds&quot;, but also &quot;cold, biting draft&quot; and thereof etc.

There is also a variant, &quot;ýr&quot; (&quot;yr&quot;), in all Nordic languages, meaning &quot;drizzle&quot; in Old Icelandic, including &quot;fine dense snowfall&quot; and &quot;snowstorm&quot; in Norwegian and Swedish. A derivative, &quot;yra&quot;, a verb, also exist, meaning &quot;to drizzle&quot; and thereof in Old Icelandic, and &quot;swirl, whirl, drift&quot;, in the sense of snow, sand, dust affected by the wind, in Swedish, etc.

Úr is related to , &quot;wave, sea&quot;, potentially also &quot;urine&quot;. It stems from a Proto-Germanic word: &quot;*ūrą&quot;, possibly begun by a w-, as found in related words (, &quot;pus&quot;, Old English: &quot;wær&quot;, &quot;sea&quot;) and historical variants of &quot;úr&quot; (Old Swedish: &quot;vur&quot;), as Proto-Germanic words starting with a &quot;w&quot;, followed by &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot;, generally lost the &quot;w&quot;-sound when evolving from Proto-Norse into Old Norse (compare , &quot;wolf&quot;, ).

=== Norwegian rune poem ===
The Norwegian rune poem is the earliest recorded Norse rune poem, recorded in the 13th century. It records the name as &quot;úr&quot;, but with a unique sense not recorded elsewhere, with the Old Norwegian meaning of &quot;dross, slag&quot;. This sense is obscure, but may be an Iron Age technical term derived from the word for water (compare the Kalevala, where iron is compared to milk).

=== Icelandic rune poems ===
In the Icelandic rune poems, recorded in the 16th century, the rune is named &quot;úr&quot;, describing some type of cold damp and windy precipitation weather.

There are several Icelandic manuscripts with rune poems, all varying to some degree. The oldest manustript, catalogued as &quot;AM 687 d 4°&quot;, is from around 1500. The second oldest, catalogued as &quot;AM 461 12° &quot;, is from around 1550. These have been noted to be hard to read, thus the transliterations might be incorrect.

==== Icelandic Manuscript AM 687 d 4° ====
AM687d, written around 1500, has lost a lot of readability due to the pergament being folded and damaged over the years, but copies have been made since the 18th century. The original scribe used diacritic abbreviation symbols to save space, which are hard to make out at a first glance. These symbols are based on period Arabic numerals, but are hard to identify, yet appear to be the following, or thereof: -r⁰, -ar¹, -ur², -er³, -re⁴/-ræ⁴, -ra⁵. The poem ends with a Latin phrase of unknown meaning. 

Below, an attempt at recreating the original text with available Unicode-characters is shown, as to convey how hard the original text is to read. Letter sequences that cannot now be identified are inserted, for convenience of reading, within square brackets [ ], on the evidence either of the available space or of related texts.

==== Icelandic Manuscript AM 461 12° ====
AM461 is slightly younger than AM687d, written around 1550, and less complete, lacking ᛦ [Ýr] for example. It has been noted by American Old Norse scholar Jackson Crawford to be very difficult to make out.

== Variants ==
=== (Ȳr) – Anglo-Frisian Futhorc ===
The Anglo-Frisian Futhark has a modified Ūr , fitted with a detached vertical line in the cavity , which was given the sound value . It was named &quot;Ȳr&quot; and corresponded to the letter y in the Latin alphabet.

Its position in the Anglo-Frisian rune-row differs between sources and was probably never standardised, but today it is generally placed at position 27.

=== (stung Úr) – Norse Younger Futhark ===
In the 11th century, a new writing rule was introduced to the Younger Futhark, in the form of &quot;stung runes&quot; (also called &quot;dotted runes&quot;), in which &quot;stings&quot;, i.e. dots, could be added to a rune to indicate a secondary sound value.

The &quot;stung Úr&quot; primarily carried the sound value and corresponds to the letter y in the Latin alphabet (unicode name: &quot;Runic Letter Y&quot;), but it also carries the sound value and seldom even , the latter of which was also carried by the &quot;stung Fé&quot; (unicode name: &quot;Runic Letter V&quot;). During this late Younger Futhark period, the sound value [y] was synonymously carried by the rune Yr , as its previous sound value, , was given to the rune Reið . In the following medieval runic alphabet, the sound value was covered by its own rune, a reversed &quot;Óss&quot; (unicode: &quot;Runic Letter Oe&quot;).

Stung runes are not separate runes from their base form in the Futhark order and thus has the same positions as their main counterpart. In the medieval runic alphabet they instead has the position of their corresponding Latin character.

<doc id="1262917" wikidata="Q49976" url="?curid=1262917" title="Koichi Kato (politician, born 1939)">
<text>was a Japanese politician of the Liberal Democratic Party who held a seat in the House of Representatives in the National Diet for 13 terms between 1972 and 2012. Kato was elected to several districts in Yamagata Prefecture and served as the Director-General of the Japan Defense Agency from 1984 to 1986 and Chief Cabinet Secretary from 1991 to 1992. Kato was a leading member of the Kōchikai faction of the LDP aligned with Prime Ministers Masayoshi Ōhira, Zenkō Suzuki, and Kiichi Miyazawa. Kato lost his seat at the December 2012 general election, and his daughter Ayuko Kato was elected to the seat at the 2014 general election.

== Early life ==
Kato was born on 17 June 1939 in Higashi Ward, Nagoya, and raised in Tsuruoka, Yamagata Prefecture. His father, , was a politician who served as mayor of Tsuruoka from 1946 before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1952, serving for five terms until 1965. After graduating from the University of Tokyo, Kato joined the Foreign Ministry in 1963, which led to stints at the Japanese embassies in Taipei and Washington, D.C. In 1967 he completed a Master&#x27;s degree at Harvard University. After continuing his foreign service career in Hong Kong he returned to Japan as an aide in the China Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Ministry. His experience in foreign affairs resulted in fluent English and Chinese, and he remained deeply interested in relations with China.

== Political career ==
Kato was first elected to the National Diet in 1972 as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), representing his native Yamagata and represented that area continuously until 2012, except for a 19-month period following his resignation due to a scandal in April 2002. Kato was aligned with the Kōchikai (then called Ōhira) faction of the LDP, which produced three Japanese Prime Ministers; Masayoshi Ōhira, Zenkō Suzuki, and Kiichi Miyazawa. The power of this faction provided Kato ample opportunity for promotion, and he served in several Cabinet Positions through the 1980s and early 1990s. From 1984 to 1986, he was Director General of the Japan Defense Agency. In 1992, he was elected Secretary-General of the LDP, a time when the traditional dominance of the party was being challenged.

=== YKK and the 2000 leadership challenge ===
Always seen as something of a maverick, Kato formed a relationship with two other young LDP reformers, Taku Yamasaki and Junichiro Koizumi, during the Kaifu administration. The three together became known as &quot;YKK&quot; after the initials of their last names. Originally the trio had agreed to sway their factions towards the new generation of LDP leaders, and marginalize the old guard within the Diet. With the election of Miyazawa (then leader of Kato&#x27;s own faction) in 1991, YKK gained greater prestige and power within the party. From the Miyazawa era onwards, YKK represented the power base of the anti-mainstream faction in the LDP. All three leaders made repeated tilts at the party leadership in the 1990s, but were unsuccessful. In 1998, Kato assumed leadership of the Kochikai faction, taking over from Miyazawa.

In May 2000, upon the sudden illness and death of Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi, Kato did not make a challenge for leadership of the LDP, believing that internal strife would not be healthy for a party in mourning. By November, however, displeased with the slow pace of reform and poor public image of the Mori administration, Kato made his move. After consulting with the opposition parties, Kato realized that with support of his and Yamasaki&#x27;s factions, a vote of no-confidence against Mori would pass in the Diet. Initial public reaction to Kato&#x27;s announcement of this vote was good, with Mori&#x27;s approval ratings diving to 30%. Unfortunately for Kato, the LDP Secretary-General at this time, Hiromu Nonaka, was a strong supporter of Mori. Nonaka launched a harsh round of party discipline, threatening to expel any LDP members that voted against Mori, and his threats had the desired effect: Kato&#x27;s support dried up even within his own faction. Kato and his remaining supporters abstained from the no-confidence vote as a face-saving measure, knowing that he could not win. However, the damage had been done with Kato and Yamasaki left to bear the full brunt of public humiliation. The aftermath of Kato&#x27;s rebellion was disastrous as a large segment of his faction split off, weakening his influence in the Diet. Public opinion that had initially supported ousting Mori now blamed Kato for his failure. The opposition parties were frustrated with his unwillingness to break from the LDP. Both Kato and Yamasaki had been considered candidates for Prime Minister, but with the loss of prestige resulting from the Mori affair, they had lost their chance. With Nonaka&#x27;s resignation shortly after Kato&#x27;s rebellion, the path was clear for someone to replace Mori. Junichiro Koizumi, the only member of YKK undamaged by the events of November 2001, finally gained control of the LDP. While Kato and Yamasaki had failed, the reformist, anti-mainstream ideals of YKK had finally moved to the forefront of Japanese politics, providing validation for Kato and his views.

=== Kato and Ichirō Ozawa ===
Kato had a sometimes difficult relationship with fellow LDP reformer Ichirō Ozawa, a strong advocate for reform within the mainstream Tanaka/Takeshita faction. In 1993, Ozawa chose to split from the party and form the Japan Renewal Party, rather than continue within the LDP. This was seen as a serious betrayal by many, including Kato. When Kato was in a similar position in 2000, he chose party loyalty, despite his chances of considerable influence in the opposition had he crossed over. When the LDP was considering a merger with Ozawa&#x27;s Liberal Party in the late 90s, Kato was strongly opposed to bringing Ozawa back to the LDP fold. Kato and Ozawa are often portrayed as archenemies, despite their very similar views on economic and political reform (in foreign policy Kato is somewhat less hawkish than Ozawa, advocating a more cautious international role for Japan).

=== Scandals ===
Kato was involved in several scandals in Japanese politics during his political career. He was implicated in the Recruit scandal in the late 1980s, tarnishing his reputation for several years. In 2002, he was the centre of a major scandal involving tax evasion, bribery and misuse of political funds. His secretary Saburo Sato had been charging a &quot;Kato Consumption Tax&quot; to companies wanting access to Kato while seeking public contracts. Sato had also failed to declare ¥100 million in taxes. While Kato denied any knowledge of the affair, few believed that such widespread corruption could have occurred in his office without his approval. It was later revealed that he had been using funds earmarked for political use to pay the rent on his Tokyo apartment. Faced with this evidence, he soon acquiesced to demands for his resignation. In November 2003, Kato made his return to the Diet as an independent, having retreated from politics long enough for the scandal to die down, and rejoined the LDP as a high-ranking member.

=== House fire ===
On 15 August 2006, Kato&#x27;s adjoining house and office in Tsuruoka burned to the ground on the 61st anniversary of the surrender of Japan in World War II. The attack was confirmed as arson and the lead suspect was expected to be charged some time in September 2006 . Reportedly the suspect was affiliated with a far-right organization and set fire to Kato&#x27;s house for making remarks critical of then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visiting the Yasukuni Shrine.

=== Retirement ===
Kato retired from political office after losing his seat for Yamagata 3rd district at the December 2012 general election to Juichi Abe, an independent and mayor of Sakata.

== Death ==
Kato died from pneumonia at a hospital in Tokyo on 9 September 2016.

<doc id="1262930" wikidata="Q5476144" url="?curid=1262930" title="National Government (1937–1939)">
<text>The National Government of 1937–1939 was formed by Neville Chamberlain on his appointment as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom by King George VI. He succeeded Stanley Baldwin, who announced his resignation following the coronation of the King and Queen in May 1937.

As a National Government it contained members of the Conservative Party, Liberal Nationals and National Labour, as well as a number of individuals who belonged to no political party. In September 1939, Chamberlain requested the formal resignations of all his colleagues, reconstructing the government in order to better confront Nazi Germany in the Second World War.

==Policies==
===Foreign policy===
Chamberlain is best known for his appeasement policy, and in particular for his signing of the Munich Agreement in 1938, conceding the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia to the Nazi regime. He said it brought &quot;peace in our time&quot; and was widely applauded. He also stepped up Britain&#x27;s rearmament program, and worked closely with France. When in 1939 Hitler continued his aggression, taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939 and threatening Poland, Chamberlain pledged to defend Poland&#x27;s independence if the latter were attacked. Britain and France declared war two days after the Nazi regime had begun to invade Poland on 1 September 1939.

===Domestic policies===
Chamberlain wanted to focus on domestic issues. He obtained passage of the Factories Act 1937, designed to better working conditions in factories, and placed limits on the working hours of women and children. The Coal Act 1938 allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits. Another major piece of legislation passed that year was the Holidays with Pay Act 1938. The Housing Act 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging slum clearance, and maintained rent control. Chamberlain&#x27;s plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in 1939. Likewise, the proposal to raise the school-leaving age to 15, scheduled for implementation on 1 September 1939, could not go into effect.

<text>Thomas Patrick McKenna (7 September 1929 – 13 February 2011) was an Irish actor. He had an extensive stage and screen career.

==Career==
===Early years===
Thomas Patrick McKenna was born at Mullagh, County Cavan, Ireland, in 1929 and educated at Mullagh School and St Patrick&#x27;s College, Cavan. Known from the cradle as &#x27;T.P.&#x27; and named for an uncle and his grandfather before him, he was the eldest of the ten surviving children of Raphael McKenna, an auctioneer and merchant, and his wife May. It was an American step-grandmother that would first sprinkle startdust in his eyes and then at boarding school he would became a protégé of Fr. Vincent Kennedy, who featured him in the annual productions of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operas. He was a noted treble and sang in Cavan Cathedral, but later would also become a keen member of the school&#x27;s Gaelic Football squad, representing St Patrick&#x27;s in the final of the All Ireland colleges competition in 1948.

Despite realising he wished to pursue a life on the stage from the age of fifteen, circumstances dictated that on leaving school in 1948, McKenna joined the Ulster Bank in Granard, Co Longford, working as a &#x27;bank official&#x27; for the next six years. Still, he remained set on becoming an actor and on being posted to Dublin, he soon made a mark on the city&#x27;s amateur scene appearing with the Rathmines and Rathgar Musical Society, and the Dublin Shakespeare Society. His employers were not impressed by his extracurricular activities, and in 1954 he was posted to the remote town of Killeshandra in County Cavan. McKenna refused to go and resigned his position.

===Stage===

McKenna made his stage debut at the Pike Theatre in Dublin in 1953 as John Buchanan in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;. He played a season at the Gaiety Theatre with Anew McMaster&#x27;s Shakespearean company, and was a member of The Gas Theatre Company directed by Godfrey Quigley.

Through family contacts, McKenna sought an interview with the managing director of the Abbey Theatre, Ernest Blythe. Despite Blythe&#x27;s concerns that &quot;his nose was too long, and he would grow fat&quot;, he eventually became a permanent member of the company in 1954 and would remain there for the next eight years, performing over seventy roles.

In 1963, McKenna secured a short leave of absence to go to London (St. Martin&#x27;s Theatre) with the Gate Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Stephen D&quot;, an adaptation of Joyce&#x27;s &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; by Hugh Leonard which had been a hit of the 1962 Dublin Theatre Festival. The play was well received by the London critics, leading to offers of further other stage work there including &quot;O&#x27;Keefe&quot; in J. P. Donleavy&#x27;s &quot;The Ginger Man&quot; (Ashcroft, Croydon), Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s revival of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1964) for the English Stage Company and 1965 as the Burglar (Aubrey &quot;Popsy&quot; Bagot) in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Too True to be Good&quot; (Garrick) opposite Alistair Sim and George Cole.

McKenna had not left the Irish stage behind entirely and would make regular appearances at the Dublin Theatre Festival in &quot;A Little Winter Love&quot;, &quot;Pull Down A Horseman&quot;, &quot;King of the Castle&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;.

McKenna joined Stuart Burge&#x27;s company at the Nottingham Playhouse in 1968 playing Trigorin in &quot;The Seagull&quot; and Sir Joseph Surface in Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The School For Scandal&quot;, both directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1969, he created the role of Fitzpatrick in David Storey&#x27;s &quot;The Contractor&quot; directed by Lindsay Anderson at the Royal Court Theatre, London. The production later transferred to the Fortune Theatre and ran for over a year. In 1973, he took on the role of Andrew Wyke opposite his friend Donal Donnelly in the Irish premiere of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Sleuth&quot;. The production played to acclaim at the Opera House, Cork, and at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin where it broke box office records.

Later that year McKenna joined the Royal Shakespeare Company and took over the role of Robert Hand in James Joyce&#x27;s only play, &quot;Exiles&quot; directed by Harold Pinter. In the same season he also appeared in a rare staging of Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;The Balcony&quot; directed by Terry Hands.

McKenna returned to the RSC in 1976 for Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;, directed by Jack Gold in a production to mark the American bicentennial celebrations, as the revolutionary pastor Reverend Anthony Anderson.

In the late 1980s and 1990s, McKenna returned to the Dublin stage when he was invited by director Michael Colgan to join the Gate Theatre on a number of occasions, including admired productions of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. It was there he created the role of Dr Rice in Brian Friel&#x27;s drama, &quot;Molly Sweeney&quot; (1994), and again at London&#x27;s Almeida Theatre. Other Friel productions he appeared in were &quot;The Communication Cord&quot; (Hampstead Theatre, 1984) and &quot;Aristocrats&quot; (2004) at the RNT in his final stage appearance.

McKenna directed on occasion, and had to his name productions of John Millington Synge&#x27;s &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; (Nottingham Playhouse, 1968), Thomas Kilroy&#x27;s &quot;The Death and Resurrection of Mr Roche&quot; (Abbey Theatre, 1973) and Seán O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s &quot;The Shadow of A Gunman&quot; (Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, 1980).

===Film and television===
During the 1960s and 1970s, McKenna appeared regularly in popular television dramas, including &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1964, 1965, 1968), &quot;Danger Man&quot; (1965), &quot;The Saint&quot; (1966, 1968), &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot; (1967), &quot;Jason King&quot; (1972), two episodes of &quot;Thriller&quot; (1973 and 1976), &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (1975), &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; (1978), &quot;Minder&quot; (1984) and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (the serial &quot;The Greatest Show in the Galaxy&quot; (1988–89)).

McKenna played Richmond in the Thames Television series &quot;Callan&quot; (1972) and made ten appearances in &quot;Crown Court&quot; (1974–1982), mainly as barrister Patrick Canty, while also appearing in the popular ATV anthology drama series &quot;Love Story&quot; (1965–1968). He also featured prominently in other television dramas including &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; (1972), &quot;Napoleon and Love&quot; (1974), &quot;The Changeling&quot; (1974), &quot;Fathers and Families (1977)&quot;, &quot;Holocaust&quot; (1978), the &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; episode &quot;Bounty&quot; (1978), &quot;The Manions of America&quot; (1981), &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; (1983), &quot;The Scarlet and the Black&quot; (1983), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1985), &quot;Strong Medicine&quot; (1986), &quot;The Play on One: Unreported Incident&quot; (1988), &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; (1988), &quot;Shoot to Kill&quot; (1990), TV series &quot;Lovejoy - Irish Stew&quot; (1993), and the final episode of &quot;Inspector Morse - The Remorseful Day&quot; (2000).

McKenna had prominent film roles in &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1967), and &quot;A Portrait of the Artist As A Young Man&quot; (1977). Other film credits include &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968), &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969), &quot;Perfect Friday&quot; (1970), &quot;Villain&quot; (1971), &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (1971), &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; (1975), &quot;Memed, My Hawk&quot; (1984), &quot;Pascali&#x27;s Island&quot; (1988), &quot;A Caribbean Mystery&quot; (1989), &quot;Monarch&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Libertine&quot; (2004).

==Death==
McKenna died on 13 February 2011 at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London, at the age of 81 following a long period of illness. He was buried alongside his wife at Cemetery in his native County Cavan.

Following McKenna&#x27;s death, tributes were paid by President of Ireland Mary McAleese, Prince Charles, and Ireland&#x27;s Culture Minister Mary Hanafin, who said that McKenna was &quot;one of a great generation whose talents on the screen and stage both at home and abroad gave us all great pride in his accomplishments&quot;. In County Cavan, he is commemorated by the T. P. McKenna Drama Scholarships (VEC) and the T. P. McKenna Perpetual Trophy presented as part of the Millrace Annual Drama Festival.

<text>Sociological abstraction refers to the varying levels at which theoretical concepts can be understood. It is a tool for objectifying and simplifying sociological concepts. This idea is very similar to the philosophical understanding of abstraction. There are two basic levels of sociological abstraction: sociological concepts and operationalized sociological concepts.

A sociological concept is a mental construct that represents some part of the world in a simplified form. An example of a mental construct is the idea of class, or the distinguishing of two groups based on their income, culture, power, or some other defining characteristic(s). An operational definition specifies concrete, replicable procedures that reliably produce a differentiated, measurable outcome. Similarly, concepts can remain abstract or can be operationalized. Operationalizing a sociological concept takes it to the concrete level by defining how one is going to measure it. Thus, with the concept of social class one could operationalize it by actually measuring people&#x27;s income. Once operationalized, you have a concrete representation of a sociological concept.

== Levels of analysis ==
In addition to the basic levels of sociological abstraction, sociological concepts are often understood at multiple levels as a result of sociological theorizing. Sociological theories postulate relationships between sociological concepts. It is generally understood that there are three levels of sociological theorizing, also known as levels of analysis:

=== Micro level ===
The smallest level of analysis is the micro level of analysis, also referred to as Microsociology. It concerns the nature of everyday human social interactions and agency on a small scale: face to face. Microsociology is based on interpretative analysis rather than statistical or empirical observation, and shares close association with the philosophy of phenomenology. Methods include symbolic interactionism and ethnomethodology; ethnomethodology in particular has led to many academic sub-divisions and studies such as micro-linguistical research and other related aspects of human social behaviour. Examples of micro levels of analysis include, but are not limited to, the following individual analysis type approach:
* Alien, stateless person, asylum seeker, refugee
* Person
* Citizen
* Partnership, marriage
* Families
* Household
* Neighborhood

=== Meso level ===
In general, a meso-level analysis indicates a population size that falls between the micro and macro levels, such as a community or an organization. However, meso level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro and macro levels. It is sometimes referred to as mid range, especially in sociology. Examples of meso-level units of analysis include the following:
* Clan
* Tribe
* Community
* Village, town, city
* Formal organization
* State

=== Macro level ===
Macrosociology involves a large-scale approach to sociology, emphasizing the analysis of social systems and populations at the structural level, often at a necessarily high level of theoretical abstraction. Though macrosociology &quot;does&quot; concern itself with individuals, families, and other constituent aspects of a society, it does so in relation to larger social system of which such elements are a part. The approach is also able to analyze generalized collectivities (e.g. &quot;&quot;the&quot; city&quot;, &quot;&quot;the&quot; church&quot;). Examples of macro-level units of analysis include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Nation
* Society
* Civilization
* International
* Global

== Origins ==
The issue with associating a concrete definition to the term sociological abstraction, is that there is no universally accepted definition. Although the earliest form of abstraction in sociology was discussed by sociologist Talcott Parsons in the 1950s, his work in &quot;The Social System (1951)&quot; failed to identify an exact definition. Rather, he emphasized the abstract element of sociological theory and made the distinction between what constitutes a theory, on one hand, and the object it refers to, on the other. He also argued that something becomes a fact first when it has been incorporated into an abstract conceptual scheme. In the following years, the topic was discussed by Robert K. Merton, C. Wright Mills, Paul Lazarsfeld, along with other theorist, who criticized parson work on abstraction in a variety of ways. During its peak of discussion in the 1950s, the debate over the concept became so intricate, it risked being disembedded and artificial type of analysis along the lines of Parsons.

== Contemporary abstracting ==
While previous studies emphasize the importance of organization, little is said about organization itself. Sociologists today focus on how organization is discerned, represented, and explained. Organization is a matter of interactions between casually differentiated parts within a complex system. The article &quot;Abstraction and the Organization of Mechanisms,&quot; goes into detail with a variety of models which represent the organization of abstraction. They visually represent the interaction between different factors and highlight casual connectivity between mechanisms. As an example, the FFL model clarifies an important aspect of abstraction. Omitting detail permits one to distinguish those underlying factors that matter from those that do not. In other words, it is easier to capture the relevant aspects and connections of the abstracted concept, when other less relevant details, are absent from the model.

<doc id="1262944" wikidata="Q2658850" url="?curid=1262944" title="Chamberlain war ministry">
<text>Neville Chamberlain formed the Chamberlain war ministry in 1939 after declaring war on Germany. Chamberlain led the country for the first eight months of the Second World War, until the Norway Debate in Parliament led Chamberlain to resign and Winston Churchill to form a new ministry.

==History==

On 3 September 1939, Neville Chamberlain, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, reconstructed his existing government so as to be suited for the Second World War. The most dramatic change to the ministerial line-up saw the return of Winston Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty. Other changes included Lord Caldecote replacing Lord Maugham as Lord Chancellor, Sir John Anderson replacing Sir Samuel Hoare as Home Secretary (Hoare became Lord Privy Seal with a wide-ranging brief) and the return of Anthony Eden to the government as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. However, the administration was not a true national unity government as it was made up primarily of Conservatives with support from some National Labour and National Liberal members. There were no representatives from the Labour Party or Liberal Party

The government was notable for having a small war cabinet consisting of only the principal and service ministers, with most other government positions serving outside the Cabinet. The War Cabinet included Chamberlain, Hoare, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, Churchill, Secretary of State for Air Sir Kingsley Wood, Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield, Lord Hankey (as Minister without Portfolio), and Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha. Oliver Stanley replaced Hore-Belisha in January 1940 while Chatfield left the war cabinet in April 1940.

The government ended on 10 May 1940 when Chamberlain resigned and was succeeded by Churchill who formed the War Coalition.

<doc id="1262950" wikidata="Q1425700" url="?curid=1262950" title="Soil (American band)">
<text>Soil (often stylized as SOiL) is an American alternative metal band that was formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1997. After some independent releases, the band was the first rock group signed to J Records and achieved mainstream success with their major label debut, &quot;Scars&quot;, in 2001. The J Records second album, &quot;Redefine&quot;, was released in 2004 and the band embarked upon a worldwide tour to follow. In late 2004, frontman Ryan McCombs left the group. He would go on to become the new vocalist of Drowning Pool the following year.

The band recruited ex-Diesel Machine vocalist A.J. Cavalier as its new singer and released two more studio albums (&quot;True Self&quot; and &quot;Picture Perfect&quot;) through independent labels in 2006 and 2009 respectively. Soil continued to tour worldwide and achieved strong independent success. The band had brief line-up changes until fall 2011. 

Soil reunited with Ryan McCombs on a tour commemorating the tenth anniversary of their landmark album, &quot;Scars&quot;. The line-up is currently completed with fellow original members Tim King (bass) and Adam Zadel (guitar), who are the only two members to have stayed with the band from its inception until present. The band released their sixth studio album, &quot;Whole&quot;, in 2013. They released a greatest hits album titled &quot;Scream: The Essentials&quot; in 2017.

==History==
=== Beginnings and early releases (1997–2000) ===
Soil was originally formed in 1997 by three of four members of death metal act Oppressor, joined by guitarist of another death metal act Broken Hope – as a side project to their other bands. Ryan McCombs was later recruited for vocal duties.

The original line-up of the band was Ryan McCombs (vocals), Shaun Glass (Broken Hope), Tom Schofield, Tim King, and Adam Zadel (all three ex-Oppressor). The band got its name from the Entombed song &quot;Rotten Soil&quot; by opting to simply drop the &quot;Rotten&quot; part and stick with &quot;Soil&quot;.

Soil released two independent EPs, &quot;Soil&quot; (on Olympic Records) and &quot;El Chupacabra&quot; ( on M.I.A.). In 1999, Soil released their debut album &quot;Throttle Junkies&quot;, however, M.I.A closed down two months after its release. It was around this time that all the members of Soil left their other bands to focus on Soil as their main project.

=== Rise to popularity and McCombs&#x27; departure (2001–2005) ===
With the song &quot;Halo&quot; gaining major radio attention, labels began a bidding war for a deal with Soil. The band would ultimately be signed to J Records by music industry legend Clive Davis, responsible for signing such acts as Pink Floyd and Bruce Springsteen, who stated that &quot;you&#x27;re gonna be my only rock band for now. You&#x27;re going to be a priority, and I want to break this band.&quot; Soil finally experienced mainstream success with the major label debut, &quot;Scars&quot;, released September 11, 2001. This achievement was aided by the popular singles &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Unreal&quot; which gained the band exposure on MTV. The success resulted in the band winning Metal Edge magazine&#x27;s 2001 Readers&#x27; Choice Award for &quot;Next Big Thing&quot;.

Soil worked on their third album all throughout 2003. In 2004, the band released their second major label album, &quot;Redefine&quot;. The group toured for a year in support of the album and returned home to begin writing follow up material and finish various live dates. Shortly after, vocalist Ryan McCombs announced his departure from the group to be with his family, forcing the band to cancel scheduled shows. New York–based vocalist A.J. Cavalier, previously of World In Pain and Diesel Machine, was introduced on November 15, 2004, as McCombs&#x27; replacement. On July 20, 2005, McCombs was confirmed to be the new singer for Drowning Pool.

=== Cavalier era (2005–2010) ===
On September 21, 2005, Soil signed with New York–based independent label DRT Entertainment. Their album &quot;True Self&quot; was released on May 2, 2006. The album leaked onto P2P and BitTorrent sites on March 4, almost two months before its official release. Soil embarked upon a very heavy worldwide touring schedule to promote the release. In November 2007, Shaun Glass parted ways with the band, citing personal and musical differences.

On October 20, 2009, the album &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; was released via Bieler Bros Records worldwide, except in Europe, where it was released by AFM Records. &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; was produced by Johnny K (Disturbed, Staind), Ulrich Wild (Deftones, Incubus) and Soil, with Dave Fortman (Mudvayne, Evanescence) handling mixing duties. It was promoted with the lead single &quot;Like It Is&quot;. In January 2010, &quot;The Lesser Man&quot; was announced as a second single.

On July 23, 2010, vocalist A.J. Cavalier, and drummer Tom Schofield announced their departure from the band. Vocalist Jordan Lee and drummer Mike Tignino were announced as fill-ins for scheduled live dates.

=== McCombs&#x27; return (2011–present) ===
The band reunited with original vocalist Ryan McCombs for a 12-date co-headlining UK tour with Puddle of Mudd in October 2011 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of &quot;Scars&quot;. 

Soil added several US tour dates throughout 2012. The trek was the band&#x27;s first in the US since original frontman Ryan McCombs rejoined the group.

Soil&#x27;s first ever DVD, &quot;Re-LIVE-ing the Scars&quot;, was released May 8, 2012. The DVD/CD combo was recorded live in London during the band&#x27;s 2011 UK tour and features the first live show with vocalist Ryan McCombs in seven years.

Soil&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Whole&quot;, was released on August 16, 2013 (worldwide) and August 20, 2013 (North America). The album was funded through Kickstarter. The band released a music video and single for &quot;Shine On&quot; on June 25, 2013.

The band released the compilation album &quot;Scream: The Essentials&quot; on September 15, 2017, via Pavement/AFM Records. It features the band&#x27;s hits along with alternate versions and unreleased material, and includes a cover of &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;&quot; by The Spencer Davis Group.

As of 2021, Soil has been working on new material for the follow-up to &quot;Whole&quot;. In July 2022, the band announced they would be releasing their new album, &quot;Play It Forward&quot;, on August 26. The album consists of cover songs that inspired the band members throughout the years. On June 28, 2023, the band announced their new album &quot;Restoration&quot;, which would release July 21. The album features re-recordings some of their biggest songs.

<text>Easley McCain Recording is an American recording studio, based in Memphis, Tennessee, notable for recording musicians such as Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns, Oblivians, Grifters, Pavement, Sonic Youth, Come, White Stripes, Townes Van Zandt, Pezz, Jeff Buckley, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Guided by Voices, Lydia Lunch, Box Tops, Rufus Thomas, Wilco, Cat Power, Modest Mouse, The Amps, The Cooters, The Walkmen, and The Cuts.

==History==
Easley McCain Recording began in the late 1970s as Doug Easley&#x27;s rudimentary, four-track recording studio in the woods near the Wolf River bottoms in Memphis, recording blues musicians like Mose Vinson, as well as local rock bands. In the early 1980s Easley operated &quot;Easley Recording&quot; out of a hand-built garage studio behind his home near University of Memphis. During this period, bands such as Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns came in to record; Alex Chilton produced an album for a Detroit group called The Gories the last year the studio was located in Easley&#x27;s garage.

By 1990, Easley, with new partner Davis McCain, had found a larger midtown Memphis facility for the recording studio and moved into it by the next year. McCain had been the sound man at a 1980s local alternative music nightspot called The Antenna Club. The new Easley studio site was originally built in 1967 as &quot;the Onyx&quot; for Don Crews, who had been a business partner at American Sound Studios with producer Chips Moman. Moman and Crews parted in 1972, with Crews establishing his own recording studio at the Onyx location.

Easley McCain Recording&#x27;s business began to attract more clients from outside Memphis in the early 1990s, after local Memphis group the Grifters grew in popularity and advertised the studio&#x27;s phone number in their liner notes. Indie rock bands from around the country including Pavement, Sonic Youth, Come began recording there. By 2001 the White Stripes had become a client, which led in turn to a Jack White-produced album by Loretta Lynn to be mixed there by Stuart Sikes.

Others recording at this indie-oriented studio have included Townes Van Zandt, Pezz, Jeff Buckley, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Guided by Voices, Lydia Lunch, , Box Tops, Rufus Thomas, Wilco, Cat Power, Modest Mouse, Kim Deal with her band The Amps, The Bamboozlers (precursors to Ingram Hill), Custard, Grifters (band), and many more.

On March 2, 2005, the studio&#x27;s lobby and control room sustained serious damage in a fire.

In 2009, after four years of inactivity, Easley McCain Recording reopened at a brand new location in Memphis. Most of their vintage analog recording equipment survived the fire, and Doug Easley is back engineering, mixing, producing and mastering full-time. His recent clients were The Shakedown, Ben Nichols (Lucero), Harlan T Bobo, Bosco Delrey, Viva L&#x27;American Death Ray, the Magic Kids as well as a number of film score/soundtrack projects.

<text>Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) is a Department of Defense program, managed by the Defense Information Systems Agency, to develop information technology infrastructure services for future systems used by the United States military.

Technically, the program is based on the concept of &#x27;enterprise integration&#x27; from the sub discipline enterprise engineering of systems engineering, which enables the transmission of right information at the right place and at the right time and thereby enable communication between people, machines and computers and their efficient co-operation and co-ordination.

There are nine core enterprise services defined in the Network Centric Operations and Warfare - Reference Model (NCOW-RM):
# storage
# mediation
# user assist
# IA (Information Assurance)
# ESM (Enterprise Service Management)
# messaging
# discovery &amp; delivery
# application
# collaboration

NCES maps these nine services to four product areas:
# Enterprise service-oriented architecture (SOA) foundation
# Content discovery and delivery
# Enterprise collaboration
# Defense on-line portal

<doc id="1262973" wikidata="Q2116658" url="?curid=1262973" title="Battle of Ichi-no-Tani">
<text>The  was fought between the offensive Minamoto clan and the defensive Taira clan at Suma, to the west of present-day Kobe, Japan, on 20 March 1184. It sat on a very narrow strip of shore, between mountains on the north, and the sea to the south. This made it quite defensible, but also made it difficult to maneuver troops inside the fortress. The Taira suffered a crucial defeat to the forces of Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Minamoto no Noriyori.

==Battle==
Minamoto no Yoshitsune split his forces in two. Minamoto no Noriyori&#x27;s forces attacked the Taira clan at Ikuta Shrine, in the woods a short distance to the east. A second detachment, no more than a hundred horsemen under Yoshitsune himself, attacked the Taira at Ichi-no-Tani from the mountain ridge to the north. At the chosen hour, the Minamoto forces attacked causing confusion among the Taira who neither deployed nor retreated. Only about 3,000 Taira escaped to Yashima, while Tadanori was killed and Shigehira captured. Also killed from the Taira clan were Lord Michimori, Tsunemasa, Atsumori, Moromori, Tomoakira, Tsunetoshi, and Moritoshi.

Ichi-no-Tani is one of the most famous battles of the Genpei War, in large part due to the individual combats that occurred here. Benkei, probably the most famous of all warrior monks, fought alongside his lord Minamoto no Yoshitsune here, and many of the Taira&#x27;s most important and powerful warriors were present as well.

Ichi-no-Tani is the last recorded instance in which crossbows were used in a Japanese siege.

==Legacy==
The death of Taira no Atsumori at the hand of Kumagai no Naozane during the battle is a particularly famous passage in the &quot;Heike Monogatari&quot;. It has been dramatized in noh and kabuki, and in popular fiction, Oda Nobunaga is often portrayed as performing the noh at his own death (&quot;ningen goju nen geten no uchi wo kurabureba, yumemaboroshi no gotoku nari&quot;) in Honnō-ji Incident. The death of Atsumori is arguably among the most celebrated acts of single combat in all of Japanese history.

<text>Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), is a collegiate public state university in Belagavi, Karnataka established by the Government of Karnataka. It is one of the largest Technological Universities in India with 26 years of Tradition of excellence in Engineering &amp; Technical Education, Research and Innovations. It came into existence in the year 1998 to cater the needs of Indian industries for trained technical manpower with practical experience and sound theoretical knowledge. The university is named after Sir M. Visvesvaraya, an Indian civil engineer, statesman and the 19th Diwan of Mysore.

==History==

Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) was established by the Government of Karnataka on 1 April 1998 with its headquarters at Belagavi, as per the provisions of the Visvesvaraya Technological University Act, 1994, an Act to establish and incorporate a university in the State of Karnataka for the development of engineering, technology and allied sciences. For effective administration, four regional offices at the four revenue divisional headquarters, namely, Belagavi, Bangalore, Mysore and Gulbarga were established. VTU was established by the Government in order to promote planned and sustainable development of technical education consistent with state and national policies and bringing various colleges affiliated earlier to different universities, with different syllabi, different procedures and different traditions under one umbrella.

==Campus==
According to the stipulations outlined in the VTU Act of 1994, the university is situated in Belagavi, Karnataka, with its main administrative center known as &quot;Jnana Sangama,&quot; meaning &quot;The Confluence Of Knowledge&quot;.

The campus infrastructure includes well-equipped laboratories, research facilities, and classrooms designed to support academic pursuits. The university provides accommodation through student hostels and offers recreational spaces and sports facilities for a balanced student experience. Emphasizing a commitment to engineering education, VTU&#x27;s campus serves as a practical environment for learning and research, fostering a diverse community of students focused on academic and technological advancements.

The university offers postgraduate programs that lead to Master of Technology (MTech), Master of Architecture (MArch) Master of Science (MSc) by research, Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Computer Applications (MCA) and doctorate (PhD). The MSc and PhD are research degrees while the rest are taught degrees.

====Undergraduate courses====

The university has 12 undergraduate boards which offer Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) programs and one undergraduate board which offers Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) course:

‡ The Architecture board offers the BArch course.

====Postgraduate courses====

The university has 11 postgraduate boards which offer Master of Technology (M.Tech.) programs:

=== Admissions ===
The university offers admissions at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Admissions for B.Tech. programmes, candidates must qualify KCET examination, COMEDK or JEE Main. The candidates seeking B.Arch. admissions must qualify for the NATA or any aptitude test in Architecture conducted by the Competent Authority of the Central / State Government or JEE Paper-II examination. The Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belagavi admissions to M.Tech. and M.Arch programmes are through GATE/PGCET. The college accepts KMAT/PGCET scores for M.B.A. and M.C.A. admissions.

===Scheme and syllabus===

Visvesvaraya Technological University accomplished its primary task of setting a common syllabus across the state in 1998. The university regularly revises the syllabus keeping in view technology upgrades around the world. The syllabus has been updated in 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2021. VTU adopted a Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) for students admitted to the university from the academic year 2015–2016. The CBCS provides a choice for students to select from the prescribed courses (i.e. core, elective, foundation and mandatory non-credit courses). As part of the new CBCS scheme, VTU also moved to a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) grading system from the previous system of awarding percentage and class to students. 
VTU has also made an internship of eight weeks mandatory for undergraduate and postgraduate engineering students in affiliated colleges.

===Grading===

For students matriculating since the academic year 2015–2016, VTU adopts an absolute grading system wherein the marks are converted to grades, and every semester results are declared with a semester grade point average (SGPA) and a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). To obtain a degree, in addition to clearing all the subjects, a student must also obtain a minimum CGPA of five (5.0).

Prior to the introduction of the Choice Based Credit System, students were awarded a percentage and a class, as defined:
*First class with distinction (FCD): Not less than 70% of the aggregate marks in first attempt
*First class (FC): Less than 70% but not less than 60% of the aggregate marks in first attempt
*Second class (SC): Less than 60% of the aggregate marks in first attempt

===Collaborations===
The university has signed MoUs with multinational corporations like IBM, Intel Asia Electronics Inc., Ingersoll-Rand (India) Ltd., Bangalore, Nokia, Bosch Rexroth and Microsoft to improve the industry interactions for students and teachers.

<doc id="1262978" wikidata="Q752305" url="?curid=1262978" title="IPCC Third Assessment Report">
<text>The IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR), &quot;Climate Change 2001&quot;, is an assessment of available scientific and socio-economic information on climate change by the IPCC. Statements of the IPCC or information from the TAR were often used as a reference showing a scientific consensus on the subject of global warming. The Third Assessment Report (TAR) was completed in 2001 and consists of four reports, three of them from its Working Groups: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis; Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability; Working Group III: Mitigation; Synthesis Report. A number of the TAR&#x27;s conclusions are given quantitative estimates of how probable it is that they are correct, e.g., greater than 66% probability of being correct. These are &quot;Bayesian&quot; probabilities, which are based on an expert assessment of all the available evidence.

==Working groups==

The IPCC was established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN&#x27;s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) &quot;... to assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant for the understanding of climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.&quot; The IPCC is organized as three working groups (WG) and a task force :

* WGI: Scientific aspects of climate (see ).
* WGII: Vulnerability, consequences, and options (see ).
* WGIII: Limitation and mitigation options (see ).
* Task Force: National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme 

WG I covers the same areas as the &quot;Second Assessment Report&quot; (SAR) of 1995, but WG II &amp; III cover slightly different areas in the TAR.

==Conclusions==
===Working Group I===

The key conclusions of Working Group I were:

#An increasing body of observations gives a collective picture of a warming world and other changes in the climate system (The global average surface temperature has increased over the 20th century by about 0.6 °C; Temperatures have risen during the past four decades in the lowest 8 kilometres of the atmosphere; Snow cover and ice extent have decreased)
#Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human activities continue to alter the atmosphere in ways that are expected to affect the climate (Anthropogenic aerosols (i.e., human emitted aerosols) are short-lived and mostly produce negative radiative forcing; Natural factors have made small contributions to radiative forcing over the past century)
#Confidence in the ability of models to project future climate has increased (Complex physically based climate models are required to provide detailed estimates of feedbacks and of regional features. Such models cannot yet simulate all aspects of climate (e.g., they still cannot account fully for the observed trend in the surface-troposphere temperature difference since 1979) and there are particular uncertainties associated with clouds and their interaction with radiation and aerosols. Nevertheless, confidence in the ability of these models to provide useful projections of future climate has improved due to their demonstrated performance on a range of space and time-scales .)
#There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities
#Human influences will continue to change atmospheric composition throughout the 21st century
#Global average temperature and sea level are projected to rise under all IPCC SRES scenarios.

The TAR estimate for the climate sensitivity is 1.5 to 4.5 °C; and the average surface temperature is projected to increase by 1.4 to 5.8 Celsius degrees over the period 1990 to 2100, and the sea level is projected to rise by 0.1 to 0.9 metres over the same period. The wide range in projections is based upon several different scenarios that assume different levels of future CO2 emissions (see the section below on Projections in the TAR).

===Synthesis Report===

The TAR Synthesis Report includes a summary of the TAR&#x27;s main findings and uncertainties. &quot;Robust findings&quot; of the TAR include:
*Observed warming of the Earth&#x27;s surface, attribution of observed warming to human activities, projected increases in future global mean temperature, rising sea levels, and increased frequency of heat waves.
*Future warming will have both beneficial and adverse effects, but for higher levels of warming, adverse effects will predominate.
*Developing countries and poor persons are most vulnerable to climate change.
&quot;Key uncertainties&quot; in the TAR include:
*Estimated climate forcings of natural climatic factors and anthropogenic aerosols (e.g., sulfate, which is produced when sulfur-rich coal is burnt), future changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the role of climate feedbacks, which may amplify or reduce the magnitude of future climate change;
*Assigning probabilities to projections of changes in sea level and temperature, as well as uncertainties related to regional projections of climate change.

==Projections==
Projections are used in the TAR as a guide to the possible future effects of climate change, e.g., changes in global mean temperature and sea level. In the TAR, the word &quot;projection&quot; is favoured over &quot;prediction&quot;. This is because many future changes related to climate are highly uncertain. For example, climate change projections are affected by highly uncertain changes in future GHG emissions.

The TAR projects impacts according to possible future changes in global mean temperature. Other projections are based on scenarios that the IPCC has developed. In 2000, the IPCC published 40 different scenarios (the &quot;SRES&quot; scenarios) which contain estimates of future changes in anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. The SRES scenarios project a wide range of possible changes in future social and economic development, and projected climate change impacts vary according to the scenario considered. The IPCC has not assigned probabilities to the 40 SRES scenarios. Some authors have argued that some SRES scenarios are more likely to occur than others.

==Scientific opinion==
The IPCC is backed by the scientific community. For example, a joint statement of support was issued in May 2001 by the science academies of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Caribbean, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Sweden and the UK. It states: &quot;We recognise the IPCC as the world&#x27;s most reliable source of information on climate change and its causes, and we endorse its method of achieving consensus.&quot;

In 2001, the executive branch of the US federal government asked the US National Research Council (US NRC, 2001) to produce an assessment of climate change science. Part of the assessment by US NRC (2001) looks at the report produced by Working Group I (WG I) in the TAR. Working Group I&#x27;s contribution to the TAR assesses the physical scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change. US NRC (2001) generally agrees with findings of the WG I report, for example, US NRC (2001) state that &quot;[the] IPCC&#x27;s conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue.&quot;

US NRC (2001) emphasise the need for governments to have a good understanding of uncertainties in climate change science. The example cited by US NRC (2001) is the uncertainty over future changes in GHG emissions, which may be less or more than that projected by the TAR. US NRC (2001) also state:
The most valuable contribution U.S. scientists can make is to continually question basic assumptions and conclusions, promote clear and careful appraisal and presentation of the uncertainties about climate change as well as those areas in which science is leading to robust conclusions, and work toward a significant improvement in the ability to project the future.

==Reception==
===Endorsements===
In 2001, 16 national science academies issued a joint statement on climate change.

The joint statement was made by the Australian Academy of Science, the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts, the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of Canada, the Caribbean Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the French Academy of Sciences, the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina, the Indian National Science Academy, the Indonesian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Irish Academy, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (Italy), the Academy of Sciences Malaysia, the Academy Council of the Royal Society of New Zealand, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Society (UK).
The statement, also published as an editorial in the journal &quot;Science&quot;, stated &quot;we support the [TAR&#x27;s] conclusion that it is at least 90% certain that temperatures will continue to rise, with average global surface temperature projected to increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 °C above 1990 levels by 2100&quot;.

The TAR has also been endorsed by the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences, Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society, and European Geosciences Union (refer to &quot;Endorsements of the IPCC&quot;).

In 2001, the US National Research Council (US NRC) produced a report that assessed Working Group I&#x27;s (WGI) contribution to the TAR. US NRC (2001) &quot;generally agrees&quot; with the WGI assessment, and describes the full WGI report as an &quot;admirable summary of research activities in climate science&quot;.

IPCC author Richard Lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the TAR. Among his criticisms, Lindzen has stated that the WGI Summary for Policymakers (SPM) does not faithfully summarize the full WGI report. For example, Lindzen states that the SPM understates the uncertainty associated with climate models. John Houghton, who was a co-chair of TAR WGI, has responded to Lindzen&#x27;s criticisms of the SPM. Houghton has stressed that the SPM is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world&#x27;s governments, and that any changes to the SPM must be supported by scientific evidence.

IPCC author Kevin Trenberth has also commented on the WGI SPM. Trenberth has stated that during the drafting of the WGI SPM, some government delegations attempted to &quot;blunt, and perhaps obfuscate, the messages in the report&quot;. However, Trenberth concludes that the SPM is a &quot;reasonably balanced summary&quot;.

US NRC (2001) concluded that the WGI SPM and Technical Summary are &quot;consistent&quot; with the full WGI report. US NRC (2001) stated:
... the full [WGI] report is adequately summarized in the Technical Summary. The full WGI report and its Technical Summary are not specifically directed at policy. The Summary for Policymakers reflects less emphasis on communicating the basis for uncertainty and a stronger emphasis on areas of major concern associated with human-induced climate change. This change in emphasis appears to be the result of a summary process in which scientists work with policy makers on the document. Written responses from U.S. coordinating and lead scientific authors to the committee indicate, however, that (a) no changes were made without the consent of the convening lead authors (this group represents a fraction of the lead and contributing authors) and (b) most changes that did occur lacked significant impact.

===IPCC process===
There are a small number of climate scientists who disagree with aspects of the IPCC&#x27;s work. Perhaps the best known is Richard Lindzen, professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

A report by the UK Parliament&#x27;s House of Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee (EAC, 2005) contains criticisms of the IPCC&#x27;s work, including the &quot;SRES&quot; greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, which are used in the TAR. The Economic Affairs Select Committee is made up of members of the House of Lords, which scrutinizes and votes on government legislation. One of the criticisms made by the EAC (2005) is an apparent inconsistency between the Working Group II Summary for Policymakers and a statement made in the full WGII report: &quot;The IPCC Summary for policy makers says that economic studies underestimate damage, whereas the chapter says the direction of the bias is not known.&quot;

The UK Government issued a response to the report by EAC (2005). The UK Government acknowledged the discrepancy between the WGII SPM and full WGII report which was referred to by the EAC (2005), but remained generally supportive of the IPCC&#x27;s procedures. The UK Government rebutted a number of other criticisms of the TAR which were made by the EAC (2005).

===Discussion of the &quot;hockey stick&quot; graph===


The third assessment report (TAR) prominently featured a graph labeled &quot;Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction&quot; based on a 1999 paper by Michael E. Mann, Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes (MBH99), which has been referred to as the &quot;hockey stick graph&quot;. This graph extended the similar graph in Figure 3.20 from the IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1995, and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units, but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years, and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period than the mid 20th century. The schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of medieval vineyards in England. Even with this increase, the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007. The MBH99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by , , and , using differing data and methods. The Jones et al. and Briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the MBH99 reconstruction in Figure 2.21 of the IPCC report.

These studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900, and the MBH99 based graph featured in publicity. Even at the draft stage, this finding was disputed by contrarians: in May 2000 Fred Singer&#x27;s Science and Environmental Policy Project held a press event on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C., featuring comments on the graph Wibjörn Karlén and Singer argued against the graph at a United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing on 18 July 2000. Denialist John Lawrence Daly featured a modified version of the IPCC 1990 schematic, which he mis-identified as appearing in the IPCC 1995 report, and asserted that &quot;Overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report, the IPCC presented the &#x27;Hockey Stick&#x27; as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt U-turn since its 1995 report&quot;. Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper, which was quickly discredited in the Soon and Baliunas controversy, was picked up by the Bush administration, and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that &quot;manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people&quot;. The data and methodology used to produce the &quot;hockey stick graph&quot; was criticized in papers by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by , which showed errors in the methods used by McIntyre and McKitrick.

On 23 June 2005, Rep. Joe Barton, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, wrote joint letters with Ed Whitfield, chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, demanding full records on climate research, as well as personal information about their finances and careers, from Mann, Bradley and Hughes. Sherwood Boehlert, chairman of the House Science Committee, said this was a &quot;misguided and illegitimate investigation&quot; apparently aimed at intimidating scientists, and at his request the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arranged for its National Research Council to set up a special investigation. The National Research Council&#x27;s report agreed that there were some statistical failings, but these had little effect on the graph, which was generally correct. In a 2006 letter to &quot;Nature&quot;, Mann, Bradley, and Hughes pointed out that their original article had said that &quot;more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached&quot; and that the uncertainties were &quot;the point of the article&quot;.

===Sea level rise predictions===
An example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the IPCC, far from overstating dangers and risks, have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels. When the researchers&#x27; analysis was &quot;applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.5–1.4 m [50–140 cm] above 1990 levels. These values are much greater than the 9–88 cm as projected by the IPCC itself in its Third Assessment Report, published in 2001&quot;. This may have been due, in part, to the expanding human understanding of climate. Greg Holland from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who reviewed a multi-meter sea level rise study by Jim Hansen, noted &quot;There is no doubt that the sea level rise, within the IPCC, is a very conservative number, so the truth lies somewhere between IPCC and Jim.&quot;

<doc id="1262979" wikidata="Q898603" url="?curid=1262979" title="Nirvana fallacy">
<text>The nirvana fallacy is the informal fallacy of comparing actual things with unrealistic, idealized alternatives. It can also refer to the tendency to assume there is a perfect solution to a particular problem. A closely related concept is the &quot;perfect solution fallacy&quot;.

By creating a false dichotomy that presents one option which is obviously advantageous—while at the same time being completely unrealistic—a person using the nirvana fallacy can attack any opposing idea because it is imperfect. Under this fallacy, the choice is not between real world solutions; it is, rather, a choice between one realistic achievable possibility and another unrealistic solution that could in some way be &quot;better&quot;. 

It is also related to the appeal to purity fallacy where the person rejects all criticism on basis of it being applied to a non ideal case.

==History==
In &quot;&quot; (1772), Voltaire wrote &quot;Le mieux est l&#x27;ennemi du bien&quot;, which is often translated as &quot;The perfect is the enemy of the good&quot; (literally: &quot;The best is the enemy of the good&quot;).

The nirvana fallacy was given its name by economist Harold Demsetz in 1969, who said:&lt;br&gt;
== Perfect solution fallacy ==

The perfect solution fallacy is a related informal fallacy that occurs when an argument assumes that a perfect solution exists or that a solution should be rejected because some part of the problem would still exist after it were implemented. This is an example of black and white thinking, in which a person fails to see the complex interplay between multiple component elements of a situation or problem, and, as a result, reduces complex problems to a pair of binary extremes.

It is common for arguments which commit this fallacy to omit any specifics about exactly how, or how badly, a proposed solution is claimed to fall short of acceptability, expressing the rejection only in vague terms. Alternatively, it may be combined with the fallacy of misleading vividness, when a specific example of a solution&#x27;s failure is described in emotionally powerful detail but base rates are ignored (see availability heuristic).

The fallacy is a type of false dilemma.

=== Examples ===
;Posit (fallacious)
: These anti-drunk driving ad campaigns are not going to work. People are still going to drink and drive no matter what.
:;Rebuttal
:: Complete eradication of drunk driving is not the expected outcome. The goal is reduction.

;Posit (fallacious)
:Seat belts are a bad idea. People are still going to die in car crashes.
:;Rebuttal
::While seat belts cannot make driving 100% safe, they do reduce one&#x27;s likelihood of dying in a car crash.

;Posit (fallacious)
:Medical testing on animals is useless. The drug thalidomide passed animal tests but resulted in horrific birth defects when used by pregnant women.
:;Rebuttal
::This popular argument ignores all the thousands of drugs that failed animal testing, any number of which could have harmed humans. In the case of thalidomide, no testing was performed on pregnant animals; had this not been the case, the effect on pregnant women could have been foreseen.

<text>The Djibouti national football team, nicknamed the &quot;Riverains de la Mer Rouge&quot; (), is the national football team of Djibouti. It is controlled by the Djiboutian Football Federation and is a member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA). The Djibouti national football team&#x27;s first win in a full FIFA-sanctioned international match was a 1–0 win vs. Somalia in the first round of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.

==History==

=== French Somaliland (1947–1960) ===

Djibouti played its first international match under the name &quot;French Somaliland&quot;, at home against neighbouring Ethiopia on 5 December 1947 and lost 5–0. This was also Ethiopia&#x27;s debut. The two played again in Djibouti on 1 June 1948 and Ethiopia won 2–1. On 1 May 1949, the fixture was played for the &quot;Emperor Cup&quot; in Ethiopia, and the host won 6–0. In 1954, Djibouti played Ethiopia three times: a 10–2 away loss on 1 May, a 2–0 home loss on 1 June and a 2–1 home loss the day after. Djibouti did not play a match again until 1960, when it entered a tournament for French-speaking countries held in Madagascar. The team lost 9–2 in the first round to Cameroon on 13 April. This was the squad&#x27;s last game as French Somaliland.

=== Djibouti (1977–present) ===
After gaining independence in 1977, the team played under the name Djibouti for the first time against Ethiopia in an away match on 27 March 1983 and lost 8–1. The two played again two days later with Ethiopia again victorious, by 4–2. After a third friendly against Ethiopia, a 2–0 home defeat on 23 March 1984, Djibouti entered a tournament in Ethiopia against the host and Zimbabwe. They lost 2–0 to Ethiopia on 3 June and then 3–1 to Zimbabwe on 7 June.

Djibouti&#x27;s first appearance at the CECAFA Cup, a local competition for nations in East and Central Africa, was in Kenya in 1994. These were its first matches since defeating South Yemen in 1988. The Djibouti squad lost 4–1 to the hosts on 28 November, 2–1 to Somalia on 1 December, and 3–0 to Tanzania on 3 December. Djibouti did not advance to the next round.

After the 1994 CECAFA Cup, Djibouti did not play a match until the qualification campaign for the 1998 African Cup of Nations in Burkina Faso. They were drawn in a two-legged qualifier against Kenya, and lost the first leg 3–0 away on 31 July 1998. The second leg at home was lost 9–1 on 15 August and Kenya went through 12–1 on aggregate.

In 1998, Djibouti became a member of the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA). The football squad has since participated in the Arab Games, a regional multi-sport event held between nations from the Arab World.

Djibouti entered its first ever World Cup qualification in an attempt to reach the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan. In Pool D of the first round of African qualification, it was drawn against the DR Congo in a two-legged qualifying preliminary. Djibouti hosted the first leg at Stade du Ville in Djibouti on 7 April 2000, drawing the match 1–1 before a crowd of 2,700 fans. The squad lost the second leg 9–1 away at the Stade des Martyrs in Kinshasa and the DR Congo advanced 10–2 on aggregate.

Djibouti has never played in the African Cup of Nations, with the team regularly withdrawing or not entering for financial reasons.

Prior to their four preliminary qualifiers in late 2019, Djibouti had 2 wins, 3 draws and 55 defeats from 60 competitive matches. However, a number of new players were called up and results finally improved. First, in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification, Djibouti beat Eswatini 2–1 at home and drew 0–0 in Manzini to advance to the second round for the first time since the 2010 qualifying when they beat Somalia 1-0 (2–1 on aggregate). This was a massive improvement from the previous edition when Djibouti had also played Eswatini and lost 8–1 on aggregate. One month later, Djibouti played two 1–1 draws against Gambia in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification preliminary round, only losing the tie on penalties.

<doc id="1262985" wikidata="Q466250" url="?curid=1262985" title="Alma Cogan">
<text>Alma Angela Cohen Cogan (19 May 1932 – 26 October 1966) was an English singer of traditional pop in the 1950s and early 1960s. Dubbed the &quot;Girl with the Giggle in Her Voice&quot;, she was the highest paid British female entertainer of her era.

==Childhood and early musical career==
Cogan was born on 19 May 1932 in Whitechapel, London. She was of Russian-Romanian Jewish descent. Her father&#x27;s family, the Kogins, arrived in Britain from Russia, while her mother&#x27;s family were refugees from Romania. Cogan&#x27;s parents, Mark and Fay Cogan, had another daughter, the actress Sandra Caron, who went on to play Mumsey in &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot;, and one son, Ivor Cogan. Mark&#x27;s work as a haberdasher entailed frequent moves. One of Cogan&#x27;s early homes was over his shop in Worthing, Sussex.

Although Jewish, she attended St Joseph&#x27;s Convent School in Reading. Her father was a singer, but it was Cogan&#x27;s mother who had showbusiness aspirations for both her daughters: she had named Cogan after silent-screen star Alma Taylor. Cogan first performed in public at a charity show at the Palace Theatre in Reading and at the age of eleven competed in the Sussex Queen of Song contest held at a Brighton hotel, winning a prize of £5.

Aged 14, she was recommended by Vera Lynn for a variety show at the Grand Theatre in Brighton and in July 1947 she appeared there for a week with Max Miller. In November 1947 she appeared in the show Dick Turpin&#x27;s Ride to York at the Grand, Brighton. At 16, she was told by bandleader Ted Heath, &quot;You&#x27;ve got a good voice, but you&#x27;re far too young for this business. Come back in five years&#x27; time.&quot; Heath would later say: &quot;Letting her go was one of the biggest mistakes of my life.&quot; She also found work singing at tea dances while also studying dress design at Worthing Art College and was soon appearing as a chorus girl in the musical &quot;High Button Shoes&quot; at the London Hippodrome in November 1948 and in a revue called &quot;Sauce Tartare&quot; at the Cambridge Theatre in London in May 1949. She became resident singer at the Cumberland Hotel in London in 1949, where she was spotted by EMI producer Walter Ridley, who became her coach and signed her to His Master&#x27;s Voice.

==&quot;Girl with the giggle&quot;==
Cogan&#x27;s first release was &quot;To Be Worthy of You&quot; / &quot;Would You&quot;, recorded on her 20th birthday. This led to her appearing regularly on comedian Dick Bentley&#x27;s BBC&#x27;s radio show &quot;Gently Bentley&quot; and then becoming the vocalist for the BBC Radio comedy programme &quot;Take It From Here&quot;, replacing Joy Nichols, from 1953 to the end of its run in 1960.

In 1953, while in the middle of recording &quot;If I Had a Golden Umbrella&quot;, she broke into a giggle; she then played up the effect on later recordings. Soon enough she was dubbed the &quot;Girl with the giggle in her voice&quot;. (&quot;Giggle&quot; has sometimes been quoted as &quot;chuckle&quot;.)

Many of her recordings were covers of US hits, especially those recorded by Rosemary Clooney, Teresa Brewer, Georgia Gibbs, Joni James and Dinah Shore. Her voice was often compared with Doris Day&#x27;s. One of these covers, &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot;, became her first hit, reaching no. 4 on 3 April 1954. Cogan would appear in the UK Singles Chart eighteen times in the 1950s, with &quot;Dreamboat&quot; reaching no. 1. Other hits from this period include &quot;I Can&#x27;t Tell a Waltz from a Tango&quot;, &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;, &quot;Sugartime&quot; and &quot;The Story of My Life&quot;. Cogan&#x27;s first album, &quot;I Love to Sing&quot;, was released in 1958.

Cogan was one of the first UK recording artists to appear frequently on television, where her powerful voice could be showcased along with her bubbly personality and dramatic costumes. Her hooped skirts with sequins and figure-hugging tops were reputedly designed by her, made by her mother and never worn twice. Cliff Richard recalls: &quot;My first impression of her was definitely frocks – I kept thinking, how many can this woman have? Almost every song had a different costume. The skirts seemed to be so wide – I don&#x27;t know where they hung them up!&quot; Cogan topped the annual &quot;NME&quot; reader&#x27;s poll as &quot;Outstanding British Female Singer&quot; four times between 1956 and 1960.

==Too square for the 1960s==

The UK musical revolution of the 1960s, symbolised by the rise of the Beatles, suddenly made Cogan unfashionable; in the 1991 BBC documentary &quot;Alma Cogan: The Girl with the Giggle in Her Voice&quot;, Lionel Blair said she was perceived as &quot;square&quot;. Her highest 1960s chart ranking in the UK was no. 26 with &quot;We Got Love&quot;, and most of her successes at this time were outside the UK, notably in Sweden and Japan. She was especially disappointed that her 1963 cover of the Exciters&#x27; US hit &quot;Tell Him&quot; did not return her to the UK charts, according to singer Eddie Grassham. &quot;Tell Him&quot; was a hit in Sweden: it spent seven weeks in the best selling record chart &quot;Kvällstoppen&quot; and peaked at #10. In 1964, Cogan recorded &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; in a rock-and-roll ballad style; this version was no. 1 in Sweden for five weeks in the best selling chart &quot;Kvällstoppen&quot; and number 1 for no fewer than 8 weeks in the Swedish Voting Chart &quot;Tio i Topp&quot;. &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; also reached the top 20 in Denmark, while a German language rendering reached no. 10 in Germany. She had another number one hit in Sweden in 1965, &quot;The Birds and the Bees&quot;. When she toured around Sweden in the mid 1960s with popular local pop bands, whose members were some ten years younger than her, she got the playful nickname &quot;popmormor&quot; (pop-grandmother).
Cogan also wrote some of her own songs. She co-wrote her 1963 record &quot;Just Once More&quot; (under the pseudonym of &quot;Al Western&quot;) with her long-time pianist, Stan Foster. &quot;Just Once More&quot; peaked at no. 10 in the Swedish Voting Chart &quot;Tio i Topp&quot; in October 1963. Her 1964 single &quot;It&#x27;s You&quot; was also a Cogan-Foster collaboration, although this time she was credited under her own name. Its B side, &quot;I Knew Right Away&quot;, was also recorded by Little Pattie in 1967.

Paul McCartney played tambourine on &quot;It&#x27;s You&quot;. Cogan recalled in 1964 that The Beatles had been recording in the adjoining studio when she was working on the song:

There have also been suggestions that Ringo Starr performed on &quot;It&#x27;s You&quot;, but Cogan did not mention this in the 1964 quote above. However she did suggest that all the basic tracks were completed when The Beatles heard the song.

She continued to be a popular figure on the UK showbusiness scene, being offered the part of Nancy in &quot;Oliver!&quot;, appearing on the teenage hit-show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and headlining at the Talk of the Town.

Cogan tried to update her image by recording some Beatles numbers and a spin-off from &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (&quot;Love Ya Illya&quot;). But by 1965 record producers were becoming dissatisfied with Cogan&#x27;s work, and it was also clear that her health was failing. Her friend and colleague Anne Shelton attributed this decline to some &quot;highly experimental&quot; injections she took to lose weight, claiming that Cogan was never well again after that.

==Personal life==
Cogan lived with her widowed mother in Kensington High Street (at 44 Stafford Court) in a lavishly decorated ground-floor flat where she frequently entertained other celebrities. She was close with the Beatles&#x27; manager, Brian Epstein. Regular visitors included Princess Margaret, Noël Coward, Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Caine, Frankie Vaughan, Bruce Forsyth and Roger Moore.

John Lennon once recalled that, when he was a teenager, he used to mimic her savagely during his time at the Liverpool College of Art. Lennon&#x27;s wife Cynthia also recalled, &quot;John and I had thought of Alma [as] out of date and unhip.&quot; But after Lennon met Cogan on the TV pop show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; in 1964, they became close friends.

Cogan was close to the other Beatles as well, especially Paul McCartney, who played the melody of &quot;Yesterday&quot; on her piano. It was there that he added the words &quot;scrambled eggs&quot; to the nameless melody. The 1987 compilation album &quot;A Celebration&quot; includes a testimonial from McCartney:

==Illness and death==
Cogan embarked on a series of club dates in England in early 1966, but collapsed after two performances and had to be treated for stomach cancer. She made her final TV appearance in August, in a guest spot on &quot;International Cabaret&quot;. The following month she collapsed while touring Sweden to promote &quot;Hello Baby&quot;, recorded exclusively for the Swedish market. She died of ovarian cancer at London&#x27;s Middlesex Hospital on 26 October, at the age of 34.

In deference to family custom, her death was observed with traditional Jewish rites, with burial at the Jewish Cemetery in Bushey, Hertfordshire.

==Legacy==
The novel &quot;Alma Cogan&quot; by Gordon Burn presents an imaginary middle-aged Cogan still alive in the 1980s and looking back on her life and fame. Based on true events and real people, aside from the device of denying her early death, it won the Whitbread Book Award in 1991. The BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Stage Mother, Sequinned Daughter&quot; (2002) by Annie Caulfield was partly adapted from this novel. Cogan&#x27;s sister, Sandra, felt that it misrepresented both Cogan and her mother and tried unsuccessfully to get it banned. Eventually the Broadcasting Standards Commission ruled that the BBC apologise to Sandra for failing to respect the feelings of surviving family members.

The romantic comedy &quot;In Love with Alma Cogan&quot; is a film starring Roger Lloyd-Pack. He is an aging manager of an old-fashioned Pier Theatre. It leads to a flashback to his encounter with Alma Cogan, who performed at the theatre in his youth.

A blue plaque commemorating Cogan was installed at the entrance of 44 Stafford Court, her long-time residence, on 4 November 2001.
A second blue plaque was unveiled at Cogan&#x27;s old home 29 Lansdowne Road, Worthing, in September 2017 by the entertainer Lionel Blair, who had been a close friend of Cogan&#x27;s. The plaque was organised by Cogan&#x27;s fans together with the Worthing Society.

<text>Château Pédesclaux is a winery in the Pauillac appellation of the Bordeaux region of France. The wine produced here was classified as one of eighteen &quot;Cinquièmes Crus&quot; (Fifth Growths) in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855.

==History==
The Château was founded in 1810 by wine broker Pierre Urbain Pédesclaux, who passed it to his son Pierre-Edmond in 1849. After death of the latter his widow continued to run the Château until 1891, when the estate was sold to the Count de Gastebois. In 1930, Lucien Jugla became tenant, and eventually purchased the Château in 1950. In 1960, Lucien Jugla added Château Belle-Rose, a 13.7-hectare estate which he had been farming since 1943, to Pédesclaux. Belle-Rose’s bourgeois building became the home of the classified growth and appeared on the new labels. In 2009, the estate was purchased by Jacky Lorenzetti, who also owns Chateau Lilian Ladouys in Saint-Estèphe and 50% of Château d&#x27;Issan in Margaux. Lorenzetti enlarged the vineyards with the purchase of 12 hectares of Medoc vines that are situated next to parcels owned by Chateau Lafite Rothschild and Chateau Mouton Rothschild.

==Vineyards and wines==
The vineyard covers an area of 46 hectares and produces about 8,000 cases of wine every year. The Château has 44 hectares in Pauillac, but also two hectares in the Haut-Médoc area. Wines from Pédesclaux are composed of roughly 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 48% Merlot, 3% Petit Verdot and 2% Cabernet franc. The estate produces three wines: the first wine, Château Pédesclaux, the second wine, Fleur de Pédesclaux and finally a third wine, Le Haut-Médoc de Pédesclaux, sold under the Haut-Médoc appellation.

<doc id="1262990" wikidata="Q397840" url="?curid=1262990" title="Convertibility">
<text>Convertibility is the quality that allows money or other financial instruments to be converted into other liquid stores of value. Convertibility is an important factor in international trade, where instruments valued in different currencies must be exchanged.

==Currency trading==
Freely convertible currencies have immediate value on the different international markets, and few restrictions on the manner and amount that can be traded for another currency. Free convertibility is a major feature of a hard currency.

Some countries pass laws restricting the legal exchange rates of their currencies or requiring permits to exchange more than a certain amount. Some currencies, such as the North Korean won, the Transnistrian ruble, and the Cuban national peso, are officially nonconvertible and can only be exchanged on the black market. If an official exchange rate is set, its value on the black market is often lower.

Convertibility controls may be introduced as part of an overall monetary policy. For example, restrictions on the Argentine peso were introduced during an economic crisis in the 1990s and scrapped in 2002 during a subsequent crisis.

==Commodity money==

Convertibility first became an issue of significance during the time banknotes began to replace commodity money in the money supply. Under the gold and silver standards, notes were redeemable for coin at face value, though often failing banks and governments would overextend their reserves.

Historically, the banknote has followed a common or very similar pattern in the western nations. Originally decentralized and issued from various independent banks, it was gradually brought under state control and became a monopoly privilege of the central banks. In the process, the principle that the banknote was merely a substitute for the real commodity money (gold and silver) was gradually abandoned.

Under the gold exchange standard, for example the Bretton Woods Institutions, banks of issue were obliged to redeem their currencies in gold bullion, or in United States dollars, which in turn were redeemable in gold bullion at an official rate of $35 per troy ounce. Due to limited growth in the supply of gold reserves, during a time of great inflation of the dollar supply, the United States eventually abandoned the gold exchange standard and thus bullion convertibility in 1974.

Under the contemporary international currency regimes, currencies are issued on the fiat of the issuer (a government or central bank), and carry no guarantee of convertibility to a tangible asset.
