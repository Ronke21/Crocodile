<text>Bartholomew Henry &quot;Barry&quot; Allen is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He is the second character known as [[the Flash]], following Jay Garrick. The character first appeared in &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 (October 1956), created by writer Robert Kanigher and penciler Carmine Infantino.

A forensic chemist, Barry accidentally gains superpowers following a lightning strike in his laboratory. Like other heroes who go by the Flash, Barry is a &quot;speedster&quot;, with powers that derive mainly from his superhuman speed. He wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind, traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring. Created as a reimagining of the popular 1940s superhero The Flash (Jay Garrick), the success of Barry Allen&#x27;s &quot;Flash&quot; comic book helped to bring about the Silver Age of Comic Books and contributed to a large growth in DC Comics&#x27; stable of science fiction comics and characters. During popular early volumes as the Flash, Barry established his own Rogues Gallery of colorful villains and sci-fi concepts like Gorilla City. Through crossovers with popular characters like Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman, Barry Allen&#x27;s Flash also helped establish DC&#x27;s flagship Justice League title, whose success would define its publishing strategy for decades to come.

Barry Allen&#x27;s classic stories also introduced the concept of the Multiverse to DC Comics, which has played a large part in DC&#x27;s many continuity reboots over the years. As a result, the Flash has traditionally always had a significant role in DC&#x27;s major company-wide crossover stories, and in the crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #8 (November 1985), Barry Allen died saving the Multiverse and would not appear again for 23 years. His return to regular comics is foreshadowed during Grant Morrison&#x27;s crossover story &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #2 (June 2008), preceding his full return in Geoff Johns&#x27; accompanying &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot; (June 2009) limited series. He has since played a pivotal role in the crossover stories like &quot;Blackest Night&quot; (2009), &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (2011), &quot;Convergence&quot; (2015), &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; (2016), &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; (2017–2019), &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; (2021), and &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (2024).

Barry Allen is an established pop culture icon and has been featured in several media, first appearing in animated form in the 1967 &quot;The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure&quot; and then in the related &quot;Super Friends&quot; program. Since then he has appeared in several DC Universe Animated Original Movies. Actor John Wesley Shipp portrayed the character in the live-action 1990s television show &quot;The Flash&quot; and the Arrowverse. The character was portrayed by Grant Gustin in the Arrowverse shows in a main capacity, especially the 2014 television series &quot;The Flash&quot;, while Ezra Miller portrayed the character in the DC Extended Universe films &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, &quot;Justice League&quot;, the director&#x27;s cut &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;, the Arrowverse event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the HBO Max series &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, and the 2023 film &quot;The Flash&quot;.

While the fictional &quot;in world&quot; history of the character known as &quot;The Flash&quot; has been written and rewritten many times as DC Comics rebooted their fictional worlds again and again, the publication history of the character has followed a different path, not (quite) so prone to rewriting.

The Flash, Barry Allen, (the name &quot;Bartholomew&quot; was not used until much later) first appeared in print in &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 (October 1956). The creative team on Showcase #4 was Julie Schwartz, editor; Robert Kanigher, writer, Carmine Infantino, penciler (illustrator); Joe Kubert, inker (assistant illustrator). Robert Kanigher is on record as saying he still considers Gardner Fox as &quot;the creator of The Flash&quot; and his creation of Barry Allen is a reworking of that original work. As a result, no one name is easily identifiable as the character&#x27;s creator.

Fox&#x27;s superhero, &quot;The Flash&quot; first appeared in Flash Comics #1 in 1940. In this story the man in the costume (he wore no mask) was named Jay Garrick. He rose in popularity and appeared in three comic book titles.

After World War II, superheroes declined in popularity, causing many of the Flash&#x27;s comic book series to be canceled. All-Flash was canceled in 1948 after 32 issues. Flash Comics was canceled in 1949 after 104 issues. All-Star Comics was canceled in 1951 after 57 issues, marking Garrick&#x27;s last Golden Age appearance.

The popularity and circulation of comic books about superheroes had declined following World War II, and comic books about horror, crime and romance took larger shares of the market. However, controversy arose over alleged links between comic books and juvenile delinquency, focusing in particular on crime, horror, and certain elements of superheroes. In 1954, publishers implemented the Comics Code Authority to regulate comic content.

In the wake of these changes, publishers began introducing superhero stories again (as preferable to crime and horror), a change that began with the introduction of a new version of DC Comics&#x27; The Flash in Showcase #4 (October 1956).

In 1956, DC Comics reinvented the Flash character, giving him a new costume, name, and background. Carmine Infantino alleged the character design was from a Captain Marvel homage he created earlier dubbed Captain Whiz. This new Flash, named Barry Allen, was completely unrelated to Jay Garrick. In fact, Garrick had never existed, as far as the new books were concerned. Barry Allen&#x27;s first appearance shows him reading a copy of Flash Comics, lamenting that Garrick was &quot;just a character some writer dreamed up&quot;. Readers welcomed the new Flash, but still had an interest in the old one. 1956&#x27;s Showcase #4 featured two Flash stories, &quot;Mystery of the Human Thunderbolt!&quot;, and &quot;The Man Who Broke the Time Barrier!&quot;. During an era marked by rapid scientific advancements and Cold War anxieties, the stories in &quot;Showcase #4&quot; reflect contemporary themes of technological triumph and societal stability. &quot;Mystery of the Human Thunderbolt!&quot; introduces Barry Allen, a police scientist who gains super-speed powers, symbolizing the era&#x27;s optimism about scientific progress and the need for heroes who embody justice. The inclusion of a bank robber as a villain resonated with readers due to prevalent fears about financial security and crime. &quot;The Man Who Broke the Time Barrier!&quot; parallels the groundbreaking achievement of breaking the sound barrier, exploring the potential of time travel influenced by Einstein&#x27;s theories, and highlighting the fascination with overcoming natural limits through science.

Also introduced at this time was Iris West, Barry Allen&#x27;s then love interest (and later wife), and &quot;Lois Lane&quot; to his &quot;Clark Kent&quot;. Like Lois Lane, Iris West was a reporter, in this case for Picture News.

Wally West, the nephew of Iris West Allen, first appeared in Flash #110 (1959), which depicted his transformation into Kid Flash, the &quot;Robin&quot; to the Flash&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;. Wally West would later go on to become the new Flash many years later.

Jay Garrick made a guest appearance in 1961 in Flash #123 &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot;. In this issue, Garrick was treated as residing in a parallel universe (Earth-Two), which allowed the character to exist without any continuity conflicts with Barry Allen (who existed on Earth-One), yet allowed him to make guest appearances in Silver Age books.

Barry Allen and Iris West were shown to get married in 1966 in &quot;Flash&quot; #165 &quot;One Bridegroom Too Many!&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
Barry Allen is a forensic chemist with a reputation for being very slow, and frequently late, which frustrates his fiancée, Iris West. One night, as he is working late on a new case, a lightning bolt strikes and shatters a case full of unspecified chemicals, drenching Barry, and temporarily knocking him out. As a result, Allen later finds that he can run at super-human speeds and possesses equally enhanced reflexes, senses, and healing. He later dons a red bodysuit, sporting a lightning bolt in the chest (reminiscent of the original Fawcett Comics Captain Marvel), dubs himself the Flash (after his childhood comic book hero, Jay Garrick), and becomes Central City&#x27;s resident costumed crime fighter and protector.

Central City University professor Ira West (Iris&#x27;s adoptive father) designed Allen&#x27;s costume and the ring which stores it while Allen is in his civilian identity. The ring can eject the compressed clothing when Allen needs it and suck it back in with the aid of a special gas that shrinks the suit. In addition, Allen invents the cosmic treadmill, a device that allows for precise time travel. Allen is warmly received by his superhero colleagues, so much so, that nearly all speedsters that come after him are often compared to him. Batman eventually says &quot;Barry is the kind of man that I would&#x27;ve hoped to become if my parents had not been murdered.&quot;

===Justice League===
As presented in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #9, when the Earth is infiltrated by alien warriors sent to conquer the planet, some of the world&#x27;s greatest heroes join forces, Allen among them. While the superheroes individually defeat most of the invaders, they fall prey to a single alien and only by working together are able to defeat the warrior. Afterwards, they decide to establish the Justice League.

During the years, Barry is depicted as feeling slightly attracted to Black Canary and Zatanna but never pursues a relationship because he feels his real love is Iris West, whom he ultimately marries. Allen also becomes a good friend of Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), which would later be the subject of the limited series &quot;Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold&quot;.

In &quot;The Flash&quot; #123—&quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot;—Allen is transported to Earth-Two where he meets Jay Garrick, the original Flash in DC Continuity; it is revealed that Jay Garrick&#x27;s adventures were captured in comic book form on Earth-One. This storyline initiates DC&#x27;s multiverse and is continued in issues of &quot;Flash&quot; and in team-ups between the Justice League of America of Earth-One and the Justice Society of America of Earth-Two. In the story from &quot;Flash&quot; #179—&quot;The Flash – Fact or Fiction?&quot;—Allen is thrown into the universe eventually called Earth Prime, a representation of &quot;our&quot; universe, where he seeks the aid of the &quot;Flash&quot; comic book&#x27;s editor Julius Schwartz to build a cosmic treadmill so that he can return home. He also gains a sidekick and protégé in Iris&#x27; nephew, Wally West, who gains super-speed in an accident similar to that which gave Allen his powers.

===Tragedy===
In time, Barry marries his girlfriend Iris West, who learns of his double identity because Allen talks in his sleep. She keeps this secret, and he eventually reveals his identity to her of his own free will with Moreno&#x27;s persuasion. Iris is eventually revealed to have been sent as a child from the 30th century and adopted.

In the 1980s, Flash&#x27;s life begins to collapse. Iris is murdered by Zoom (a supervillain from the 25th century who had long loved her and been jealous of Allen), and when Allen prepares to marry another woman, Zoom tries the same trick again. Allen stops him, killing Zoom in the process by breaking his neck. Unfortunately, when Barry is unable to make an appearance at his own wedding, his fiancée eventually descends into madness.

Placed on trial for murder in connection with Zoom&#x27;s death, Allen is found guilty by the jury. When he is told by a juror Nathan Newbury, who is being possessed by a mind from the future, that Reverse-Flash (whom Allen knows to be dead) brainwashed the jury into this verdict, Flash flees his trial. The Flash is then attacked by Reverse-Flash, and realizes that the answers to this mystery, and restoring his good name, lie in the future, so Newbury uses a time device to send them forward. They discover that Abra Kadabra was disguised as Reverse-Flash to ruin the Flash&#x27;s good name. Defeating Kadabra, he retreats to the future to be reunited with Iris, having learned that Iris&#x27; spirit was in fact drawn to the 30th century, and given a new body (and was in fact the mind inhabiting Newbury). The final issue of &quot;The Flash&quot; ends with Flash and Iris kissing passionately and the caption &quot;And they lived happily ever after... for a while&quot;. There are a few references in the final issue (&quot;The Flash&quot; #350) to the upcoming events, and Flash&#x27;s impending death.

In the controversial storyline &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; (sets within the post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; continuity), it is revealed that six months after Iris&#x27; death, Barry and four other members of the Justice League voted to allow Zatanna to edit Doctor Light&#x27;s mind, essentially lobotomizing him. When Batman discovers what the League was doing, the League has his memories edited as well despite the objection of Green Arrow. Both Doctor Light and Batman eventually recover from their respective mindwipes; Doctor Light vows to get his revenge against the heroes while Batman loses trust and faith in his allies.

===&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;===

Following the trial, Allen retires and joins Iris in the 30th century. After only a few weeks of happiness, the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; intervenes, and Allen is captured by the Anti-Monitor and brought to 1985; according to the Anti-Monitor, the Flash is the only being capable of traveling to other universes at will, so the Anti-Monitor could not allow him to stay free. Allen escapes and foils the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s plan to destroy the Earth with an anti-matter cannon, creating a speed vortex to draw the power in, but dies in the process as the power becomes too much for his body. It has been said that Allen travels back through time and becomes the very same lightning bolt that gives him his powers, but later it is also strongly implied that the soul of Barry resides in the Speed Force, the mystical source and Valhalla open to all dead speedsters, and from which the living ones draw their powers. After Allen&#x27;s death, Kid Flash Wally West, his nephew and sidekick, takes up the mantle of the Flash.

====After death====
Marv Wolfman, scribe for the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, has repeatedly stated he left a loophole in the script allowing Barry Allen to be reintroduced, without a retcon, into DC Universe continuity. Wolfman first hinted at the loophole in his introduction to the original &quot;Crisis&quot; collected edition hardcover, and later then fully explained on his website. This loophole would allow a writer to pull Barry out of his desperate run to annihilate the anti-matter cannon. However, Barry would know he must someday finish his death run, and would become more determined to use his speed to help others.

In &quot;Deadman: Dead Again&quot;, Barry is one of the heroes whose spirit Deadman helps to enter Heaven, and the &quot;Green Arrow&quot; storyline &quot;Quiver&quot; depicts Barry Allen in Heaven. His spirit seems to still be alive within the Speed Force, along with Max Mercury and other speedsters.

In &quot;Quasar&quot; by Marvel Comics, released between December 1990 and May 1994, an amnesiac Barry Allen, misremembering his name as &quot;Buried Alien&quot; and the Speed Force as the &quot;Hyperforce&quot;, and surprised to have &quot;form&quot; again, enters the Marvel Universe in the middle of the great race to be the &quot;Fastest Man Alive&quot; after the players had passed the first warp junction, where he is discovered by the Runner co-ordinating it and invited to participate in his race. Beating several other speedsters (Quicksilver, Quasar, The Whizzer, Captain Marvel, Speed Demon, Black Racer, Super Sabre, and Makkari), he is declared to be the &quot;fastest man alive&quot;, a title he believes feels &quot;right&quot;, though he never recovers his memory during his time in the universe. He later adopts the alias &quot;FastForward&quot;, before being returned to his original universe with Makkari&#x27;s assistance.

===Legacy===
Iris is pregnant and has two children who have super-speed powers, the Tornado Twins, who later meet the Legion of Super-Heroes. In the multiversal variant known as Earth-247, each of her children themselves have children with speed-based abilities. One, Jenni Ognats, grows up to become the Legionnaire XS, while the other, Bart Allen, is born with an accelerated metabolism that rapidly ages him, and is sent back to the 20th century where he is cured by Wally West. He remains there as the superhero Impulse under the tutelage of Max Mercury, and later becomes the second Kid Flash as a member of the Teen Titans. One year after the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Bart becomes the fourth Flash until he is abruptly killed by his clone Inertia and the Rogues. Wally then retakes the identity of the Flash. Bart is later resurrected as Kid Flash by the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st century to combat Superboy-Prime.

===&quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;===
Barry Allen appears in issue 3 as the Flash in the JLA when the two realities start changing, along with Hal Jordan. When the two teams see their real futures, Barry witnesses his death during Crisis on Infinite Earths as the Grandmaster shows the heroes how reality should be but nevertheless resolves to help restore the timeline as it is not his place to play God. He talks with Hal Jordan over the similarity of their situation, stating that dying could not be so bad so long as they have left a legacy for others (Wally West and Kyle Rayner, in their cases) to fight for what they believe. He helps the team get into Krona&#x27;s base by using his running on a treadmill to pass the ship through the dimensional barrier. With the Wasp, he is ordered by Captain America to find ways through Krona&#x27;s defences, and alerts the group to a probably lethal force field. During the final battle, Barry saves Hawkeye from being killed when the Absorbing Man breaks the ground beneath him, but both of them are blasted and apparently killed by Dreamslayer. At the end, it is revealed that Barry got the two of them out alive and at Captain America&#x27;s suggestion they laid low. Because of this, Hawkeye is able to destroy Krona&#x27;s machine with a TNT arrow while Barry distracts him and takes the twelve items of power. As a result, reality is restored, Barry disappears and Wally returns.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearances===
Wally West, wrecked by grief for the loss of his unborn twins at the hands of Zoom, regrets the public knowledge of his identity. Barry appears from somewhere in time—stating that he is from a period shortly before his death—counseling his nephew, and talking the Spectre into granting his wish, erasing all public knowledge of Wally and Barry&#x27;s identities as the Flash (Although Wally himself also loses his memory of his identity for a time). Barry then disappears, telling his nephew that he will come to his aid three times, on the three most difficult days of his life of which this is the first. In fact, when Zoom enlists the aid of the original Professor Zoom to make Wally relive the loss of his beloved twins, Barry is already there, trying to stop his &quot;own&quot; Reverse-Flash; Zoom apparently retrieved Eobard Thawne from the day that he attempted to kill Fiona Webb, with Barry following his nemesis. For the second time, he helps Wally undo the damage dealt by Zoom, also allowing Wally to save his twins, and returns to his proper time, dragging his Zoom with him and later breaking his enemy&#x27;s neck.

====&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;====

In the fourth issue of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Barry Allen comes out from the Speed Force, along with Johnny Quick and Max Mercury, to help his grandson Bart deal with Superboy-Prime, taking the villainous teen with him in the Speed Force. Bart Allen appears wearing Barry Allen&#x27;s costume in Tokyo near the end of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #5 to tell the heroes that Superboy-Prime has escaped the Speed Force. Bart again reappears in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #7 in Barry Allen&#x27;s costume to combat Superboy-Prime once more.

In &quot;Flash: The Fastest Man Alive&quot; #6 (2006) (with a portion taking place shortly before &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #5) it is told how Barry spent four years in an alternate Keystone City along with Max Mercury, Johnny Quick, and an alternate Jay Garrick, until he met Bart and Wally West, joining him after the battle against Superboy-Prime. After Superboy escapes, Barry suggests that someone has to absorb the whole Speed Force and cross the dimensional bridge back to Post-Crisis Earth. As Bart volunteers, Barry gives him his suit as a last gift, to keep the Force contained, and stays behind. Wally West did not go because of his wife and kids. Bart says he knows Barry would go if he could, but why Barry Allen could not make the journey himself is not stated.

===Flash&#x27;s return===

Twenty three years after his death in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #8, Barry Allen&#x27;s essence makes a return to the present DC Universe proper in &quot;DC Universe&quot; #0, preceding his full-time return in the pages of &quot;Final Crisis&quot;.

&quot;DC Universe&quot; #0 features an unnamed narrator who initially associates himself with &quot;everything&quot;. He begins to recall his past and association with Justice League members, particularly Hal Jordan and Superman. The lettering in which he speaks to the reader is yellow on backgrounds that are initially black. As the story moves forward, the background slowly begins turning red. In the final pages, the narration boxes feature a yellow lightning bolt. Over time, as he recalls friendships and connections with other people, his mind begins to narrow, remarking &quot;I...know him. I am no longer everything. I am a shaft of light split through a prism&quot;. Yet he is still the only one able to see &quot;the shadow falling over everything&quot;, in the form of Darkseid. On the final page, the moon appears in front of a red sky, as a yellow lightning bolt strikes in front of it creating the logo of the Flash, as he remarks &quot;and now I remember&quot;.

A &quot;Daily News&quot; story released on the same day proclaims that Barry Allen has returned to life, with issue co-writer Geoff Johns stating, &quot;When the greatest evil comes back to the DC Universe, the greatest hero needed to return.&quot;

====&quot;Final Crisis&quot;====

Barry makes his return in &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #2. On the second to last page, Jay Garrick and Wally West feel vibrations to which Jay remarks, &quot;but, don&#x27;t you recognize those vibrations? It can&#x27;t be... Not after all these years... Not after all this time.&quot; On the final page, Barry Allen is seen in hot pursuit of the bullet which kills Orion, outrunning the Black Racer and shouting to Jay and Wally to &quot;Run!&quot;

During &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #3, Jay Garrick speaks to Barry&#x27;s wife, Iris, and tells her that her husband is alive. Meanwhile, Wally and Barry run a few weeks into the future. When they come to rest, Wally asks Barry if it is really him. Lamenting on Orion&#x27;s death, which he was unable to stop, Barry wonders why he is now alive after being dead for so long. It is then that Barry and Wally are confronted by Wonder Woman, Batwoman, Catwoman, and Giganta, who have all been transformed into the new Female Furies following the release of the Anti-Life Equation.

Despite the fact that this new version of the Female Furies is equipped with the ability to track down speedsters, perceived by Libra and Darkseid as the only obstacle left between them and world domination, Barry&#x27;s expertise allows him to overcome their foes and run through the ruined Earth.

Barry stops to see his wife Iris and save her from the slavery of the Anti-Life Equation. Seeing his wife again for the first time in years, Barry is overcome with emotion and gives his brainwashed wife a deep kiss. While kissing her, the Speed Force sparkles out of his body, enveloping Iris and freeing her from the Equation. The Allens and Wally West are left to fend in a conquered world. In the seventh and final issue of &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Barry and Wally lead the Black Racer to Darkseid, dealing the cosmic tyrant a blow that, coupled with Batman shooting him in the shoulder with the god-bullet, would facilitate his ultimate defeat.

====&quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot;====

In 2009, writer Geoff Johns and artist Ethan Van Sciver created &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot;, a 6-issue miniseries bringing Barry Allen back to a leading role in the DC Universe as the Flash, much in the same vein as &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot;. When asked what Flashes would appear in the series, Johns and Van Sciver said, &quot;All of them.&quot;

The series begins with the cities of Central and Keystone celebrating the return of, &quot;Central City&#x27;s Flash&quot;, Wonder Woman having used her government contacts to create the story that Barry was in witness protection to account for his resurrection. Avoiding the parades, parties, and other celebrations of his return, Barry instead contemplates why he is alive again. A visit to the Flash Museum and from his friend Hal Jordan is not enough to put his mind at ease as he runs off as the Flash. &quot;I can&#x27;t be late,&quot; he says. When asked by Hal late for what, Flash replies, &quot;For whatever the rest of the world needs me for.&quot;

It is then revealed that Flash&#x27;s mother was murdered when he was a child, and his father was arrested for the crime (this is pointedly contrary to previous Flash stories, in which both his parents appear alive). Flash describes this as &quot;the only one open case I left behind.&quot; Before he can contemplate this any further, the speedster villain Savitar escapes the Speed Force through Flash. When Flash manages to put his hand on Savitar&#x27;s shoulder, the villain screams in agony and crumbles into dust, not before telling Flash, &quot;...You were the beginning, Allen...and you&#x27;re the end.&quot; At that moment, Wally West, West&#x27;s children Iris and Jai, Liberty Belle, Jay Garrick, and Kid Flash all experience painful convulsions and are engulfed in lightning.

Barry&#x27;s conflict with the speed cult culminates in the death of their new leader who was attempting to avenge Savitar&#x27;s death. It causes pain once again to all the speedsters, though Wally West manages to catch a glimpse of Allen directly afterwards, and sees him as the new Black Flash. When he realizes that his presence could damage or kill other innocents, Barry flees back into the Speed Force, where he encounters old friends Johnny Quick and Max Mercury. Max attempts to tell Allen that his becoming the Black Flash is not his fault. When Max and Barry are pulled into another pocket of the Speed Force, the real culprit reveals himself: Professor Zoom.

Zoom reveals his plan: after Barry briefly aided Kid Flash against Superboy-Prime during the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Thawne was able to send a subliminal pulse into the Speed Force to draw back what was left of Barry&#x27;s self-awareness. This led to the hero&#x27;s reappearance during the &quot;Final Crisis&quot;. Afterward, Zoom transformed himself into &quot;a new kind of speedster&quot; and created his negative Speed Force to contaminate Barry and the other heroic speedsters. Before Barry can fight any further, Zoom fades away. Wally enters the Speed Force to retrieve his uncle, and after venturing deeper into the Speed Force, Max reveals to Barry that it was Allen himself who created the Speed Force. Meanwhile, Wally manages to reach Barry and Max, and the three begin their escape. As the heroic speedsters are recharged with energy, Barry, Wally, Jay, Max, and Bart charge towards Zoom.

The seven speedsters (the 5 men plus Jesse Chambers and Iris West-Park) battle against Zoom, and despite being outnumbered, Zoom pulls Barry away. He reveals that everything horrible that happened to Barry, including the murder of Barry&#x27;s mother, was caused by Zoom. Zoom then decides to destroy everything by killing Barry&#x27;s wife, Iris, before they met.

Barry chases after Zoom, and is joined by Wally, who tells Barry to push as hard as he can to break the time barrier. They reach Thawne, and their lightnings turn Barry&#x27;s past self into the Flash in the altered timeline (preserving Barry&#x27;s destiny) as they are able to stop Zoom from killing Iris. As the two Flashes push Zoom back through time to the present, they see that the Justice League, the Justice Society, and the Outsiders have built a device specifically for Thawne. Barry tosses him in and activates the device, severing his connection to the negative Speed Force. The Flashes tie Zoom up to stop him from running. With the threat ended, everyone celebrates by welcoming Barry back and the speedsters in general. Later, Barry closes the case on his mother&#x27;s death and opts to take all the other cold cases they had after his death. Barry spends some time with Iris before racing to Washington to celebrate his return with the Justice League, apologizing for being late.

====&quot;Blackest Night&quot;====
Barry Allen is one of the main characters in Blackest Night alongside Hal Jordan. Allen appears alongside Jordan in the Free Comic Book Day issue &quot;Blackest Night&quot; #0 which acts as a prologue to the July company crossover.

At the grave of Bruce Wayne in Gotham City, Hal and Barry reflect on Batman&#x27;s death and how the hero community is avoiding linking Wayne and Batman.

This reflection turns to the pair looking at their deaths, comparing the sadness Barry&#x27;s death engendered in others while Hal&#x27;s death produced anger. Hal sums it up by telling Barry, &quot;I died a sinner. You died a saint.&quot; (though he admits he is not and reflects on his past sins.) The conversation moves on to the world becoming &quot;more dangerous&quot; after Barry&#x27;s death and observing that the deaths of Arthur Curry and Martian Manhunter cost the Justice League its &quot;heart and soul.&quot; As they leave the cemetery, Barry expresses hope that their dead comrades will be returned to them. He specifically cites Batman noting, &quot;If there&#x27;s an escape, you can bet Batman&#x27;s already planning it.&quot;

Barry also appears alongside Hal in the July issues of &quot;Green Lantern&quot; tying into the event. Recently, in a fight with Black Lantern J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz, he found a mysterious black residue at Bruce Wayne&#x27;s grave—a black form coagulating much like blood that started corrupting him by partly decaying his skin and muscle during the fight against his former friend, who is intent on killing both Hal and Barry, seeing how they both died and in the eyes of the Black Lanterns, must return to that state to keep the universe in balance.

After fighting off the undead Martian and the subsequent Black Lanterns with Hal and the arriving Atom, Mera, Firestorm, and two of the Indigo Tribe members, Barry, along with Wally and Bart, races across the globe to warn every superhero community across the planet. His message also inadvertently warns the Rogues. They all realize that their deceased members would come after them and decide to strike first at Iron Heights Penitentiary, unaware that the undead Rogues are ready for them. While doing so, Barry meets a Black Lantern version of Professor Zoom for a brief battle. Barry decides to go to Gorilla City to seek aid from its ruler Solovar, unaware the gorilla leader had been killed years before. Finding the city attacked, Barry assumed Grodd had struck only to be horrified to learn Solovar was now a Black Lantern. Their fight was shortened by Barry racing to Coast City.

He stops at the city&#x27;s memorial, where he witnesses the arrival of the Black Lanterns&#x27; demonic lord, Nekron, and his disciples Scar and Black Hand. The Justice League, the Titans, Wally, and Bart arrive to aid Barry to take a stand against Nekron. Nekron reveals that all the resurrected heroes are tied to him because he allowed them to rise again. As such they belong to him. Nekron then used a series of black rings to turn Superman, Wonder Woman, Troia, Green Arrow, Bart, and several other resurrected heroes into Black Lanterns. Barry and Hal find themselves being targeted by black rings and are forced to flee or risk joining the others as Black Lanterns.
Barry saves himself and Hal through time travel two seconds forward, leaving the rings with no present targets. As Barry and Hal rejoin the heroes against Nekron and his army, Ganthet, one of the Guardians of the Universe and a leader of the Blue Lantern Corps, summons a blue power ring and Barry is chosen as a Blue Lantern so he would be more effective during the battle.

After being chosen as a Blue Lantern, Barry joins forces with the veteran Blue Corps member Saint Walker to continue battling the Black Lanterns alongside the understanding of the potentials and limitations of his new power ring. During the battle, Barry is forced to fight his own grandson, who his ring detects is still alive but would eventually die if not free from the black ring soon. Barry is shown to be skilled with his ring in creating energy constructs based on his imagination and the ability to fly (possibly because of the understanding with Hal&#x27;s ring), as he can create images of Bart as Impulse and Kid Flash against him to make him feel again. Barry&#x27;s plan almost works as Bart reacts to the images of his past, and the constructs attempt to take the black ring from him, but later is interrupted by the Black Lantern Professor Zoom and Solovar. Wally and Walker later join Barry to fight against them. Barry and Bart temporarily joined the White Lantern Corps during the final events of Blackest Night.

===&quot;The Flash&quot; Volume 3===

The new &quot;Flash&quot; series begins after the completion of &quot;Blackest Night&quot; and the beginning of &quot;Brightest Day&quot;. After the events of &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot;, Barry Allen is reintegrating himself into life in Central City. Under the cover of having been in witness protection, Allen returns to the Central City Police Department&#x27;s crime lab and returns to the streets as the Flash. While readjusting to life as the Flash, a man appears out of thin air in the costume of Flash rogue the Mirror Master, and promptly dies on the street.

When Barry arrives on the scene to investigate, he sees the man is neither original Mirror Master Sam Scudder, or the current Rogue, Evan McCulloch. Hearing of another portal appearing, Barry transforms into the Flash and runs to investigate. When he arrives, a group of people in costumes similar to the Rogues, called &quot;The Renegades&quot; appear and tell Barry that they are from the 25th century, and that he is under arrest for murdering the &quot;Mirror Monarch&quot;. Barry tells the crew that he has not killed anyone, to which their leader, &quot;Commander Cold&quot;, tells him, &quot;Not yet. But you will.&quot;

After a brief struggle, where Weather Warlock&#x27;s time disc was damaged, the Renegades were forced back to the 25th century, which also caused the destruction of an apartment building due to their uncontrolled jump back. Barry saves everyone in the building, even rebuilding the building in minutes, and goes on to search for the true killer of Mirror Monarch. He is attacked again by the Renegades, but only before Captain Boomerang shows up, now wielding explosive energy boomerangs. Boomerang fights both the Flash and the Renegades, and a confused Top (one of the Renegades from the 25th century) questions his teammates on whether or not Barry Allen is the man they are looking for, pointing out that in their timeline, Boomerang never showed up.

The Renegades finally corner Captain Boomerang when the Rogues arrive with a giant mirror left by the previous Mirror Master that says &quot;In Case The Flash Returns Break Glass&quot;. An all out brawl ensues as the Rogues battle the Renegades. Meanwhile, Flash is confronted by Top who warns him that the reason he will eventually kill Mirror Monarch is because of Iris&#x27;s death, which he claims will be caused when the giant mirror breaks, releasing the Mirror Lords. Top tells Barry that one of the Mirror Lords will possess Iris and take her away from him. Barry races to stop the mirror from breaking, with Top at his side. However, when the White Lantern entity reaches out to Captain Boomerang, telling him to &quot;Throw the Boomerang&quot;, Boomerang responds by throwing dozens of boomerangs in every direction. One of them hits the glass and it begins to break. Top tells Flash to stop the Mirror Lords, while he goes and protects Iris. Flash questions does not make sense, but Top throws him into the mirror and flees.

In the mirror, Flash is exposed to strange visions of his mother. Outside, the Rogue Mirror Master tells the others that the mirror is actually a slow acting poison and they flee. Barry escapes the mirror confused and asks, &quot;Where are the Mirror Lords?&quot; He is then arrested by the Renegades, who realize that this was all a setup by Top to frame the Flash for his own personal gains. Barry is transported to a 25th-century court, while Top confronts Iris.

The story concludes with Barry escaping the 25th century court and going after Top. Top reveals that the reason for all of his crimes is because Barry reopened a previously closed case. Barry felt that the person convicted was actually innocent. The person who is actually guilty of the crime is one of Top&#x27;s ancestors. Top reveals that they do not allow anyone in the Renegades who has any ancestors with a criminal record. The Flash is able to beat Top, and convict the right man for murder, letting go the innocent man who was sent to prison. Afterward, the 25th century court and the Renegades go over the facts, realizing that the Flash was right and that their entire record of history is wrong. This alludes to the upcoming Flash event, &quot;&quot;. Meanwhile, a man on a Speed Force-powered motorcycle (later revealed to be a Speed Force police officer under the name of Hot Pursuit) moves through the desert and says that if Barry does not find the flashpoint, it will destroy the world. As he continues through the desert, Speed Force lightning strikes in the distance.

In a &quot;Green Lantern&quot; storyline, Barry becomes the latest host for the embodiment of fear, Parallax, after he joins Hal Jordan&#x27;s quest of locating all of the entities who each represent aspects of the power of the emotional spectrum. Barry was susceptible to the entity&#x27;s attacks due to his fear for Jordan&#x27;s safety. Barry is eventually freed after the embodiment of compassion, Proselyte, helps him remember his capability for benevolence over his fear.

DC has also announced via the Flashpoint Friday Blog that &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 3) #12 will be the last in the series despite a thirteenth issue originally having been announced for sale on May 25, 2011, but which has since been withdrawn.

====&quot;Flashpoint&quot;====

As the story begins, Barry Allen wakes up in his office and discovers that his mother is alive, there is no trace of Superman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman leading their respective nations in a war, his wife Iris West is unmarried, and himself currently powerless. Barry seeks the aid of Batman, driving to Gotham City and entering a run-down Wayne Manor. He explores what turns out to be a small Batcave until he is attacked by Batman. Barry tries to explain who he is by saying he knows Batman is Bruce Wayne, only to find that in this reality, Batman is Thomas Wayne. While Barry is being beat up by Batman, he explains about his secret identity as the Flash and his relation to Bruce Wayne. Barry&#x27;s memories spontaneously change and he realizes that the world of Flashpoint is not an alternate dimension, but his own. Barry uses his ring, which he uses to contain his Flash outfit, but the ring instead ejects Professor Zoom&#x27;s costume. Barry tells Batman that Zoom is taunting him with it. Barry explains that both he and Zoom have the ability to alter time, leading Batman to ask him about how Bruce was to have lived in his place and if he can really change the world. Barry states that he needs his speed first. Later, Barry and Batman create an electric chair-like device to try and recreate the accident that gave him his speed; however, the first attempt meets with failure, leaving Barry severely burned.

Barry awakes on an operating table in the Batcave and is covered in bandages and third degree burns. Despite Thomas&#x27; advice, Barry sits back down in the electric chair device. When lightning strikes a second time, Barry&#x27;s super-speed returns, and he then saves the Batman from being impaled on a fence. Barry&#x27;s injuries are healing rapidly due to his speed-enhanced regeneration. He also makes a new copy of his Flash costume. The Flash researches the incarnations of heroes of the DC timeline, believing that Zoom deliberately changed their lives to prevent the Flash from creating a Justice League, and learns of a rocket that crashed into Metropolis which carried the infant Superman, who instead of being raised in Kansas was taken in by the government. They then contact Cyborg for his help in sneaking into the government bunker of &quot;Project: Superman&quot; that is &#x27;raising&#x27; Superman after his rocket destroyed Metropolis upon its arrival, only to be disappointed at Superman&#x27;s frail appearance. They head towards Project: Superman&#x27;s underground base via the sewer. The group comes across a giant vault door bearing the Superman logo. After they open the door, the three see a pale, weakened Kal-El. Despite his appearance, Barry says that no matter what, Superman will always be a good person. When the arrival of guards forces them to escape, Superman&#x27;s powers begin to manifest and he flies off leaving them at the hands of the guards.

While they fend off the guards, they are rescued by Element Woman. Barry&#x27;s memories begin to change much more drastically, altering his past. He states that he is running out of time and soon he will not be able to restore the timeline to normal. After Barry is recovering, he asks the heroes to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war from creating more casualties, although the heroes are not willing to unless Batman wants to join them. Cyborg explains to him that they believe Batman was invincible. However, Barry convinces him that no one is invincible; the Marvel Family and Batman agree to join him. The heroes arrive at New Themyscira to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war, and appear to be winning until Enchantress reveals herself as the Amazon spy and uses her magic to separate the Marvel Family and restore them to their mortal forms. Penthesilea kills Billy Batson just as Professor Zoom reveals himself to Barry. Professor Zoom reveals to him that the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; timeline was actually created by Barry himself, after he traveled back in time to stop Zoom from killing his mother, but the timeline diverted into the near-apocalyptic world they find themselves in. He continues to taunt Barry with this knowledge, but is suddenly stabbed in the back by Batman wielding an Amazonian sword. Before Barry returns the timeline to normal, Batman thanks him for all he has done and gives him a letter addressed to his son. After this, Barry bids a farewell to his mother, knowing he must travel back in time to stop his younger self from altering time. Through the fusions of the time stream, Barry seemingly hears a voice explaining that the three timelines and worlds, need to become one again and would need his help to do this. After the ordeals, he visits the real Bruce Wayne and gives him the letter from his alternate father. Bruce is grateful to Barry of informing him of the events of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; before the timeline was apparently returned to normal.

===The New 52===
DC Comics relaunched &quot;The Flash&quot; with issue #1 in September 2011, with writing and art chores handled by Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato as part of DC&#x27;s company-wide title relaunch, &quot;The New 52&quot;. As with all of the books associated with the DC relaunch, Barry Allen appears to be about five years younger than the previous incarnation of the character. He gains his powers after getting frustrated and throwing a small machine at the window of his lab. The machine breaks through the window, leaving a hole big enough for a bolt of lightning to charge through the hole and strike him.

In the second issue of the new &quot;Justice League&quot; title (the first released comic series of the New 52 initiative and &quot;opening shot&quot; of the new DC Universe), Flash is called to assist Green Lantern and Batman in wrangling an out-of-control Superman, and later assists with the pursuit of an alien, revealed to be an agent of Darkseid. In this new continuity, Barry&#x27;s marriage to Iris West never took place, and he is instead in a relationship with longtime co-worker Patty Spivot. In this new series, the Flash draws deeper into the Speed Force, enhancing his mental abilities while still trying to fully grasp his powers, which he does not yet exert total control over.

As revealed in issue #0 of the current series, Barry Allen&#x27;s father was placed in prison for the murder of his mother. The murder occurred shortly after Barry returned victorious from a school spelling bee, and Barry placed the trophy he won on his mother&#x27;s grave in her memory. While the evidence seems to indicate his father&#x27;s guilt, Barry prioritizes proving his father&#x27;s innocence.

Barry is also part of the main cast of the relaunched &quot;Justice League&quot; series, making his debut in the series&#x27; second issue. Following Convergence, Barry has a new suit in issue #41, which has a darker shade and features more streaks.

===DC Rebirth===

During &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Barry is no longer the only Flash. It is revealed that Wally West has been lost in the Speed Force for ten years, realizing during this time that Barry is not responsible for changing the timeline after the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; crisis, the unknown entity used Barry&#x27;s time traveling as an opportunity to fundamentally alter reality. The fallout of the recent Darkseid War allowed Wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth, but each attempt caused him to fall further into the Speed Force. After realizing not even Linda (his traditional &quot;lightning rod&quot;) could remember him, Wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before Barry one last time to thank him for the life he had given him. Just before Wally disappeared, Barry remembered him and dragged him free of the Speed Force. Following a tearful reunion, Wally gave Barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come. Because of Wally, Barry is now aware that the timeline is not reset correctly after Flashpoint and thus another alternate timeline. However, he still cannot remember his pre-Flashpoint life, such as people like Jay Garrick, his long-last marriage with Iris, and the details of his feuds with the Reverse-Flash / Eobard Thawne (who now remembers their pre-Flashpoint history), and remembers Wally from their new DC Rebirth timeline history. Despite being informed by Wally that another party is responsible, Barry remains in guilt over his mistakes, and seeks to find and stop them in hopes of making amends. Although the two decide to keep Wally&#x27;s return secret from Iris based on Wally&#x27;s own experience with Linda, Barry encourages him to return to the Titans, but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the Flash rather than &#x27;Kid Flash&#x27;. While Wally considers his options, Barry visits Batman to discuss the new evidence of some outside force attacking them, musing on how personal this assault appears, but despite the potential danger, Batman and Barry agree to keep their investigation to themselves until they know what they are up against. Later, when Eobard Thawne attacks Iris and Wallace, Iris has glimpses of her pre-Flashpoint life with Barry and learns his secrets as the Flash in the process. Barry then learned of their marriage in the other timeline as well. Knowing from Thawne that her entire life has been drastically altered and that Barry is indirectly responsible for it as the result of his time-traveling actions, Iris now distrusts Barry. To make matters worse for Barry, while he is entering the Negative Speed Force, he becomes the Negative Flash which is more lethal than the original, and mostly dangerous to control.

After getting rid of the Negative Speed Force, he investigates the death of Turbine, but thanks to Godspeed&#x27;s help, he discovers that Captain Cold was the one who killed him because he seeks redemption. He visits Wally after defeating the Top, and he discusses him telling Iris that he is alive. While he is rekindling his relationship with Iris, the city is being attacked by Gorilla Grodd and his organization the Black Hole where Grodd mind-controlled Meena Dhawan to be the group&#x27;s Negative Flash.

After defeating Grodd and getting Wally to meet Iris for the first time, they encounter the Renegades. The Renegades take the Flashes and Iris back to the 25th century to get answers about why Iris killed Eobard Thawne, only to discover that Hunter Zolomon has been manipulating everyone in a plot to bring conflict between Barry and Wally for the fate of the Speed Force. After Wally defeated Hunter, Barry places him under watch at the Sanctuary while he is moving in with his girlfriend Iris at her place after Wallace angrily left them. Barry begins searching for the other forces. Hunter Zolomon arrives, powered with the Sage and Strength Force, claiming to be the &quot;one true Flash&quot;. He defeats Barry and takes Steadfast away to claim the Still Force for himself. Black Flash also arrives and warns the defeated Barry not to interfere in his mission. Zolomon tortures Steadfast to give him the Still Force, but Steadfast resists. Finally, a revived Barry tracks down Zolomon and tries to rescue Steadfast, but Zolomon&#x27;s power over other forces proves too much for him. Steadfast tries to use the Still Force to stop both the speedsters, but the plan backfires as Zolomon approaches and takes the Still Force. With the control of all four forces, Zolomon enters the Forever Force taking Barrrces such as Sage Force and Strength Force after the Force Barrier&#x27;s broken; he ends up discovering about the four forces conflicting for the control of the Forever Force. He manages to track down the Still Force user Steadfast and the Strength Force user Fuerza to bring them to his team after the Black Flash starts hunting the other force users to prevent them from using their powers as the other forces weaken and deplete the Speed Force. However, the Sage Force user Psych refuses to join Barry&#x27;s team only to be later tracked down and killed by the Black Flash. To safeguard the other force users Barry sends Fuerza and Commander Cold to the Strength Force and stays behind with Steadfast.

Barry meets Hunter Zolomon again, and watches as Hunter sacrifices himself to heal the Force Barriers. Barry Allen is forced to recruit Eobard Thawne and Godspeed in his help against a villain name Paradox by traveling back in time to the place where Eobard murdered his mother. Eobard and Godspeed help Barry defeat Paradox, but Eobard kills Godspeed and escapes. Eobard Thawne takes over Barry&#x27;s body, but Barry manages to free himself with the help of Jesse Chambers and Max Mercury while meeting Inertia (the cloned grandson of Bart Allen) in the Speed Force for the first time.

During the climatic battle, Barry is enraged that Eobard Thawne subliminally caused Wally West to murder people in the Sanctuary. In order to stop Eobard Thawne, Barry decides to forgive him in order to untether Eobard from the timeline. When Eobard rushes at him, Barry vibrates through the attack, and transfers some of his Speed Force into Eobard Thawne, effectively reverting Eobard back to normal. After the battle, Barry cleans up the neighborhood and meets one of Eobard&#x27;s ancestors Macy, but decides to do nothing and tells Iris he will try to find Wally. In Dark Nights: Death Metal event, Barry and Wally reconcile with each other while fighting off Batman Who Laughs army to reach Metron&#x27;s chair.

=== Infinite Frontier ===
During Infinite Frontier, Barry leaves Earth and Justice League to be a representative for the multiversal Justice League, and goes to different worlds to stabilize them. Barry is captured by Darkseid and is forced on a treadmill to allow Darkseid more power to control the Multiverse. Calvin Ellis frees Barry from the cosmic treadmill, but it causes him to be transported to Multiverse-2, the ruined Multiverse after the first crisis. He meets Pariah who imprisons him in a dream world. Wally West and Linda Park free Barry from his prison, and the rest of the speedsters return to Earth while Barry tries to find the Justice League. Barry saves Hal Jordan when he is imprisoned by Pariah, and they eventually regroup the Justice League. Barry and Hal create a plan to go back to Earth to help the heroes fight against The Great Darkness, and help the heroes clean up the wreckage.

=== Dawn of DC ===
Barry had planned to propose to Iris, but an attack from an alien species kills her. He helps Wally and the fellow speedsters defeat the alien army and undo Iris&#x27; death, and she accepts his proposal. In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Flash was among those who attended a party held by the Flash family. In &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, Barry is the only member of the Flash family to still have a connection to the Speed Force after the connections of the other speedsters are severed by Amanda Waller. After Waller&#x27;s Amazo task force is defeated, Barry&#x27;s powers are taken and the rest of the speedsters lose access to the Multiverse.

==Powers and abilities==
As with all Speed Force users/conduits Barry&#x27;s main power is superhuman speed. Barry is generally considered to be the second fastest non-omnipotent character in the DC Universe after his successor and nephew Wally West. Barry is capable of running many magnitudes faster than light speed. Barry has been calculated as going as fast as 13 million times the speed of light and has feats that are faster. He has outrun numerous incredibly fast characters including Reverse Flash, Superman, Supergirl, and the Black Racer, the &quot;Grim Reaper&quot; of speedsters.

Barry&#x27;s speed has numerous secondary applications. He can use it to generate cyclones by spinning his arms quickly. By vibrating the molecules in his body at hypersonic frequencies, Barry can turn invisible or phase through solid matter. Barry can also manipulate the electrical Speed Force energy he generates. He can channel the energy into arcs of lightning, as well as use the electricity to manipulate magnetism on a minor level. He has also used the lightning to create blinding amounts of light. By interlocking his lightning with that of another speedster, Barry can short circuit their connection to the Speed Force. Barry is also immune to telepathic attacks and control as he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought via the Speed Force. Through &quot;speed-reading&quot;, he can absorb large amounts of information into his short-term memory, which remain in his mind just long enough for him to make use of it. Using this technique, Barry was able to learn enough about building work to rebuild a destroyed apartment building. The Speed Force also supplies Barry with a protective aura that shields him and people he carries from friction and kinetic impacts, as well as grants him superhuman durability. Other aspects of Barry&#x27;s powers include an enhanced metabolism, which grants him a regenerative healing factor. In the New 52, Barry learned that his body is using the Speed Force to its full extent but his brain was not. With the help of Dr. Elias he was able to learn how to use the Speed Force to process more information, and make even quicker decisions, to the point where he feels like he can see everything before it happens. Barry also developed the ability to speed up the flow of time around him, which he used to negate the powers of Zoom, who was able to slow down time. In terms of DC&#x27;s internal lexicon, Barry is classified as a meta-human: A human being who possesses extranormal abilities either through birth or as the result of some external event.

As of 2024, Barry no longer has any powers due to the events of &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, where he sacrificed his connection to the Speed Force.

==Rogues gallery==

Some of the Flash&#x27;s enemies formed a loose association and referred to themselves as the Rogues, disdaining the use of the term &quot;supervillain&quot; or &quot;super-criminal&quot;. These criminals typically have unusually modest goals for their power level (robbery or other petty crimes), and each have adopted a specific theme in their equipment and methods.

<text>Jason Peter &quot;Jay&quot; Garrick is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He is the first character known as [[the Flash]]. The character first appeared in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 (January 1940), created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert.

In the original Golden Age comics, Jay Garrick gained his speed-enhancing abilities by inhaling hard water vapor during a lab experiment. This accident granted him superhuman speed and agility, allowing him to become the Flash and fight crime.

Jay Garrick has made numerous appearances in other media. For television series on The CW, John Wesley Shipp portrayed the character as a recurring character in &quot;The Flash&quot; and in a guest capacity in &quot;Stargirl&quot;. Additionally, Billy Mitchell played the character&#x27;s live-action debut as a cameo in &quot;Smallville&quot;, with a cameo appearance in &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023) portrayed via CGI and modeled after editor Jason Ballantine.

==Creation==
The character of Jay Garrick was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert. In an interview, co-creator Harry Lampert commented on the character&#x27;s creation. &quot;The idea of the Flash was Gardner Fox&#x27;s idea...it was supposed to be based upon the god Mercury… I went into the dictionary and there&#x27;s the most beautiful rendition of Mercury and then I took my Flash and superimposed [them together] and they were almost identical, the pose is the same except a few doodads, and as I did it, I kept it as close as possible to that graceful attitude.&quot;

==Publication history==

Jay Garrick first appeared in &quot;Flash Comics #&quot;1, the pilot issue of &quot;Flash Comics,&quot; which was published in 1940 by All-American Publications. He was soon featured in &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; as part of the Justice Society of America. In 1941, he received a solo comic book series, &quot;All-Flash&quot;.

After World War II, superheroes declined in popularity, causing many of the Flash&#x27;s comic book series to be canceled. &quot;All-Flash&quot; was canceled in 1948 after 32 issues. &quot;Flash Comics&quot; was canceled in 1949 after 104 issues. &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; was canceled in 1951 after 57 issues, marking Garrick&#x27;s last Golden Age appearance. The character did not appear again for ten years and would not have another solo series until the 2023 series &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;.

In 1956, DC Comics reinvented the Flash character, giving him a new costume, name, and background. This new Flash, named Barry Allen, was completely unrelated to Jay Garrick, with the latter becoming a fictional character in-universe.

Jay Garrick made a guest appearance in &quot;Flash&quot; #123. In this issue, Garrick was treated as residing in a parallel universe (Earth-Two), which allowed the character to exist without any continuity conflicts with Barry Allen (who existed on Earth-One), yet allowed him to make guest appearances in Silver Age books. For most of the 60s and 70s, Garrick made guest appearances. However, starting in 1976, Garrick became a regular character in the revived &quot;All-Star Comics&quot;, partaking in adventures with the Justice Society in stories set in modern times. In 1981, he and the Justice Society appeared in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; in stories set during World War II.

In 1985, DC Comics merged all of its fictional characters into a single shared universe. Jay Garrick now shares the same world as the New Flash. DC wrote the character out of continuity in the one-shot &quot;Last Days of the Justice Society&quot; but brought the character back in the 1990s due to fan interest. Unlike characters such as Batman or Superman, DC decided not to update Jay as a young hero but portrayed him as a veteran of World War II with a magically prolonged lifespan. Jay Garrick became a regular character in the &quot;JSA&quot; and &quot;Justice Society of America&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===

Jason Peter Garrick is a college student. Prior to 1940 (later retconned to 1938) while working for his academic advisor Professor Hughes, Jay accidentally inhaled hard water vapors after taking a smoke break in his laboratory where he had been working (later stories would change this to heavy water vapors). As a result, he finds that he can run at superhuman speed and has similarly fast reflexes. Retcons imply that the inhalation simply activated a latent metagene.

After a brief career as a college football star, he dons a red shirt with a lightning bolt and a stylized metal helmet with wings (based on images of the Roman god Mercury). He then begins to fight crime as the Flash. The helmet belonged to his father Joseph who fought during World War I. He sometimes uses the helmet as a weapon or a type of shield, as seen in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. He has also used it to direct a beam of light at Eclipso. In &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot; (2010), he used it to destabilize the Reverse Flash.

In the early stories, Jay&#x27;s identity appears to be public knowledge. Later stories would show him as having his identity secret, and that he maintains it without the use of a mask by constantly &quot;vibrating&quot; his face, making him difficult to recognize or clearly photograph. Garrick ultimately revealed his identity as the Flash to the world.

During his career, he would often find himself embroiled in semi-comic situations inadvertently initiated by Winky, Blinky, and Noddy, a trio of tramps known as the Three Dimwits, who tried their hand at one job after another, never successfully.

His first case involves battling the Faultless Four, a group of blackmailers (Sieur Satan, Serge Orloff, Duriel, and Smythe), who plot to steal an atomic bombarder and sell it. It is later revealed that a professor named Edward Clariss found the last container of heavy water vapor and used it to gain super-speed, becoming the Rival. He briefly takes away Jay&#x27;s speed after capturing him, making him super slow, but Jay uses the gases again, allowing him to regain his super speed and defeat the Rival.

Like the Flashes who followed him, Garrick became a close friend of Green Lantern Alan Scott, whom he met through the Justice Society of America.

===Justice Society of America===
The Flash soon became one of the best-known of the Golden Age of superheroes. He was a founding member of the Justice Society of America and served as its first chairman. He was originally based in New York City, but this was later retconned to be in the fictional Keystone City. He left the JSA after issue #6 but returned several years later (issue #24, spring 1945). He had a distinguished career as a crime-fighter during the 1940s.

Garrick&#x27;s early history was largely the subject of retcons. A story explaining the retirement of the JSA members, including the Flash, explained that, in 1951, the JSA was investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee for possible Communist sympathies and asked to reveal their identities. This was later revealed to be partly caused by Per Degaton. The JSA declined, and Garrick, who recently married his longtime girlfriend, Joan, retired from superhero life. As a trained scientist, he ran an experimental laboratory for several decades.

&quot;The All-Star Squadron&quot; Annual #3 issue states that the JSA fought a being named Ian Karkull, who imbued them with energy that slowed their aging, allowing Garrick and many others – as well as their girlfriends and sidekicks – to remain active into the late 20th century without infirmity. The 1990s &quot;Starman&quot; series notes that the Shade prompted Garrick to come out of retirement in the 1950s, but the details of his activities during this time are hazy at best.

===Earth-Two===
Garrick emerged from retirement in 1961 to meet the Silver Age Flash, Barry Allen, from a parallel world. The rest of the JSA soon joined the Flash, although their activities during the 1960s (other than their annual meeting with Earth-One&#x27;s Justice League of America) were unrecorded, although it is clear that Garrick and Green Lantern (Alan Scott) were good friends. It is also established that Garrick has become a respected scientist on his Earth.

Garrick was a key member of the JSA&#x27;s 1970s adventures (as chronicled in &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; and &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;). Garrick also helped to launch the careers of Infinity Inc. Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, all the parallel worlds are merged into one, and Keystone City becomes the twin city of Allen&#x27;s Central City, with the two separated by a river. An updated story suggests that Keystone in this new continuity was rendered invisible and wiped from the memories of the world for many years through the actions of several supervillains.

===21st Century===
In the early 21st century, many of Garrick&#x27;s JSA cohorts have retired or died, but Garrick remains active with the latest incarnation of the group. He is physically about 50 years old, thanks to the effects of several accidental anti-aging treatments, but his chronological age is closer to 105. He is one of the few surviving members of the Justice Society of America after &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;. Of the three original JSA members still on the team (along with Alan Scott and Wildcat), Jay takes a fatherly approach toward his teammates and the DC superhero community in general.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;One Year Later&quot;===
Garrick and his wife, Joan, had guardianship of Bart Allen after Max Mercury&#x27;s disappearance. During the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Garrick states that the Speed Force is gone after a battle in which many speedsters, living and dead, wrestle Superboy-Prime into the Speed Force and disappear. Garrick is left behind on Earth by the other speedsters when he reaches his speed limit and cannot follow. Bart Allen returns, aged several years, having absorbed the entire Speed Force during his pursuit of the escaped Superboy-Prime. Garrick claims that without the Speed Force, his own power is less than before: like Wally West in the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; aftermath, he can only run close to the speed of sound. He also states that, as the Speed Force is no longer slowing his aging, his speed is diminishing with time. After Bart leaves Keystone City for Los Angeles, Garrick, once again, is the city&#x27;s sole guardian. After hearing news of Bart&#x27;s demise, Garrick collapses with grief, consoled by Jesse Chambers.

Garrick continues his work as a member of the reformed Justice Society of America, under the leadership of Power Girl. After the death of Bart Allen, Garrick&#x27;s full speed returns. Garrick is currently the mayor of Monument Point, where the JSA is now based. He faces problems due to the JSA being based in the Town, but after talking to another official, who says that, as Garrick is not a politician, he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about being re-elected, Garrick gains confidence. Soon after this, he holds a funeral for Alan Scott, who is killed defeating the villain D&#x27;arken, and tells the Justice Society that they must endure.

====Velocity====
In the &quot;Outsiders: One Year Later&quot; story arc, a clone of the character called Velocity appears as an antagonist, created by the Brotherhood of Evil. He appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s and is brainwashed into working for the Malinese dictator Ratu Bennin. Velocity is defeated by the combined efforts of the Outsiders. He possesses Jay Garrick&#x27;s super-speed, but none of his memories or expertise. His unconscious body is placed in the custody of Alan Scott, Checkmate&#x27;s White King, who states that the Outsiders could not be trusted.

Because of lingering issues in the cloning process, made more unpredictable by the metagene itself, the clone is infected by a fast-acting version of the &quot;clone plague&quot; deteriorating and shortening the lifespan of clones in the DC Universe. This makes it difficult for Checkmate to find a way to wake him and undo his brainwash, because, even with his special suit, tailored to stave the degenerating process, he would be doomed to a slow death whenever he awakens from his suspended animation.

===&quot;Brightest Day&quot;===
In Brightest Day, Garrick and the rest of the JSA help Alan Scott and his children overcome the power of the Starheart, and, in turn, help save the planet from the Dark Avatar. After the events of the &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Garrick and the rest of the JSA travel to the city of Monument Point, which has been attacked by a superpowered terrorist named Scythe. Just before being defeated, Scythe snaps Jay&#x27;s long standing friend Alan Scott&#x27;s neck. In the following story, it is revealed that Scythe is the product of Nazi genetic engineering, and that Scott and Garrick had been tasked by the president with killing him back when he was in infancy during World War II. The two heroes could not agree on a course of action, and, as a result, Scythe was allowed to live. Doctor Mid-Nite discovers that the injuries Scott sustained have paralyzed Scott, and that any attempt to heal himself could break his constant concentration, which could result in the Starheart once again regaining control of his body.

Jade visits her bedridden father in the Emerald City, and offers to use her abilities to help him walk again. Scott declines his daughter&#x27;s offer, reasoning that if the Starheart were to once again take over his body, it could kill everyone in the city. Eclipso attacks the city, which results in Jesse Quick having to get Scott to safety.

Later, the JSA tries to take down the villain D&#x27;arken, who has escaped from Monument Point and absorbed the powers of JSA members, but D&#x27;arken is too powerful for the JSA to take him down. Due to the entity&#x27;s ability to absorb powers from superhumans in its vicinity, only non-superpowered and magical members fight D&#x27;arken. The JSA tells Alan Scott that unleashing the Starheart is the only way to destroy D&#x27;arken. However, Scott&#x27;s body incinerates itself and he is presumed dead.

===DC Rebirth===
Jay Garrick is not present following &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot. &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; reveals this to be the result of Doctor Manhattan altering the timeline and erasing the Justice Society from existence. However, he is restored when Superman convinces Manhattan to restore the timeline. &quot;The New Golden Age&quot; storyline reveals that Jay and Joan had a daughter named Judy who was the former&#x27;s sidekick before being kidnapped by the Time Masters. In the resulting &quot;Jay Garrick: The Flash&quot; series, it is revealed that Jay&#x27;s college professor Dr Hughes from &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 (1940) was in fact the supervillain Doctor Elemental, who engineered the lab accident that made Jay into the Flash; Jay was the only survivor. Elemental was the archenemy of Flash and Boom in forgotten 1960s adventures. After Boom is rescued by Stargirl in the present day, she returns home to her parents, whose memories are restored.

==Powers and abilities==
As the Flash, Garrick can run at superhuman speeds and has superhumanly-fast reflexes, tapping into the Speed Force. The limits of his speed have fluctuated over the years, though he has usually been second to DC&#x27;s &quot;flagship&quot; Flash, Barry Allen and his successor, Wally West.

In his earliest appearances, Garrick&#x27;s speed was derived from a metagene that activated after he inhaled hard water vapors. By his own account, he initially could run just shy of the speed of sound. He could carry people away with him at super-speed without causing injury due to extreme acceleration. He could make himself invisible by vibrating his body at high frequencies and disguise his features by vibrating his molecules. Once he met Barry Allen, he surpassed his limitations, citing running at &#x27;twenty times the speed of sound&#x27;,{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} seemingly able to tap into the Speed Force. He has since displayed speed absorption, time travel and interdimensional shifting abilities.

When Barry Allen absorbed the Speed Force during &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Jay&#x27;s speed was diminished to the same level as his early adventures. He struggled to surpass the speed of sound and lost many of his higher powers. Once the Speed Force returned, Jay&#x27;s powers were fully restored.

<doc id="1257813" wikidata="Q1773638" url="?curid=1257813" title="Olu Falae">
<text>Chief Samuel Oluyemisi Falae (born 21 September 1938), is a Nigerian banker, administrator and politician who was secretary to the military government of Ibrahim Babangida from January 1986 to December 1990, and briefly the Finance Minister in 1990. He ran for president in Nigeria&#x27;s Third and Fourth Republics but lost.

== Early life and education ==
Falae was born to the family of Chief Joshua Alekete Falae and Abigail Aina Falae on September 21, 1938, in Ilu-Abo, Akure. Joshua Falae was originally from Akure but due to opportunities in cocoa farming, Falae&#x27;s family and a few other Akure natives moved to a nearby location called Ago-Abo – also known as Ilu Abo – where they settled as pioneers. Falae&#x27;s father was later made the chief of Ago-Abo village. Falae&#x27;s mother was born and raised in the village of Igbara-Oke and died during childbirth in 1946 when Falae was only 8. He was then raised by his father and his paternal grandmother, Chief Osanyintuke Falae (née Adedipe), who was a maternal granddaughter of Deji Osupa of Akure and a daughter of the Elemo of Akure, Chief Adedipe Oporua Atoosin (himself a great-grandson of Deji Arakale of Akure, Osupa&#x27;s father). Falae attended an Anglican primary school in Akure where he met his future wife, Rachael Olatubosun Fashoranti, younger sister of Afenifere leader Reuben Fashoranti. After primary education, he sat for the entrance exam into Igbobi College and was accepted in 1953. upon graduation from Igbobi, he went on to complete his Higher School Certificate at Government College, Ibadan in 1958 and later became a tutor at Oyemekun Grammar School, Akure. He attended the University of Ibadan for his undergraduate studies earning a degree in economics, thereafter, he obtained a graduate degree at Yale University in the United States. At the University of Ibadan, he represented his hall of residence in the Students Representative Council and was editorial board member of the student run campus magazine.

== Civil service and government career ==
After completing his bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics, Falae joined the civil service as the assistant secretary of the National Manpower Board. He later became a principal assistant secretary of the board. In 1971, he was transferred to the Central Planning office and by 1975, he was a director at the planning office. During his stint at the planning office, the department was actively involved producing the third national development plan for the country and conducting a revision exercise after a change in government. In 1977, Falae was appointed permanent secretary (Economic dept), Cabinet office.

In 1981, he became the managing director of Nigerian Merchant Bank (NMB), formerly United Dominion Trust. In Falae&#x27;s tenure at the bank, the firm increased its authorized and lending capital.

Falae returned to public service in 1986 when he was appointed Secretary to the Government. By then, he believed Nigeria needed economic re-structuring. In 1985, prior to his appointment, the military sought the public opinion of an IMF economic structuring proposal as a condition for external credit from the fund. The popular opinion was to reject the proposal. The administration then came up with Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). SAP was a proposal to diversify export from a crude oil dependent regime, ensure fiscal and balance of payments equilibrium and non-inflationary growth. The mechanisms to be implemented in order to achieve these objectives were the devaluation of the naira, reduction of petroleum products subsidies and trade liberalization. During his time in office, Falae became a vocal defender of SAP even when it was becoming unpopular with the masses, earning him the moniker &quot;Mr. SAP&quot; amongst ordinary Nigerians.

He left the post of Secretary to the Government and served as the Federal Minister of Finance in 1990 in the military regime of Ibrahim Babangida. He was relieved from office in August 1990. Thereafter, he joined the democratic transition programme.

== Political career ==
Falae&#x27;s foray into politics started during the Third Republic. Babangida had banned &#x27;old breed&#x27; politicians, who were mostly people who had held elective office in the past such as Bola Ige and Lateef Jakande. Falae soon became the candidate of choice for followers of Awolowo and some progressives within the Social Democratic Party. He contested for the post but lost to Shehu Musa Yar&#x27;Adua before the elections were cancelled. He later threw his support and organization towards actualizing the presidential ambition of MKO Abiola.

In the mid-1990s, following the cancellation of the June 12, 1993 and the coming to power of a new military government, Falae became a prominent member of the National Democratic Coalition during the quest for the restoration of democracy in Nigeria. Falae was jailed by the military government of Sani Abacha, but was released in June 1998 after Abacha&#x27;s death. He unsuccessfully contested the 1999 Nigerian presidential elections on the joint platform of the Alliance for Democracy and the All People&#x27;s Party against Olusegun Obasanjo, the presidential candidate for the People&#x27;s Democratic Party. He &quot;swept&quot; the southwestern votes but was unable to attract significant support elsewhere. Since then, Falae has lived in semi-retirement as a large scale farmer in Ago Abo, Akure. He was awarded the national honour of Commander of the Federal Republic in 2008.
, Falae is the &quot;pro tem&quot; Chairman of the Democratic Peoples Alliance, a progressive party allied with the All Progressives Grand Alliance.

On the 21st of September, 2015, Falae was kidnapped on his farm on his 77th birthday, with the kidnappers demanding 100 million Naira ($500,000) as a ransom. He was ultimately released on the 24th of September, 2015, after the payment of the ransom and returned to his home in Akure. The kidnappers were later arrested and in 2017, were sentenced to life imprisonment.

== Chieftaincy titles ==
A direct descendant of Oba Osupa I of Akure (who was his great-great-grandfather), Chief Falae currently holds the chieftaincy titles of the &quot;Baale Oluabo&quot; of Ilu Abo and the Gbobaniyi of Akure.

<text>Grethe Ingmann (born Clemmensen; 17 June 1938 – 18 August 1990) was a Danish singer.

She started her career at 17, when she temporarily performed as a singer of the Malihini Hawaiians pop quartet. Soon after she sang with the Danish guitarist Jørn Grauengaard and his trio.

In 1955 she met her future husband, guitarist Jørgen Ingmann. The couple married in 1956 and performed as the duet Grethe og Jørgen Ingmann. Together they won the Eurovision Song Contest 1963 representing Denmark with the jazz waltz &quot;Dansevise&quot; (Dancing tune) with music by Otto Francker and lyrics by Sejr Volmer-Sørensen. It was the first entry performed by a duo to win the Contest and also the first Scandinavian winner.

In 1965 she entered the German Schlager Contest with the song &quot;Sommerwind&quot;. She dropped out in the preliminaries, but the song&#x27;s English version, written by Johnny Mercer in 1966 and sung by Frank Sinatra, became an international hit.

Grethe and Jørgen Ingmann continued their musical career until they divorced in 1975. As a solo singer, Grethe participated in several Danish pre-selections for the Eurovision Song Contest, unsuccessfully. Notably, in 1979 she entered the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix with Bjarne Liller and the song &quot;Alt er skønt&quot;, which tied for equal first at the end of the voting but placed second after a re-vote.

The couple remarried in the 1980s. Grethe died of liver cancer on 18 August 1990, aged 52, becoming the first Eurovision winner to die.

<doc id="1257824" wikidata="Q6979961" url="?curid=1257824" title="Native American hip-hop">
<text>Native American Hip Hop is hip hop culture practiced by people of (often urban) Native American heritage, including Canadian First Nation hip hop artists. It is not a specific form of hip hop but varies in style along the lines of hip hop in general. Native Americans have been present in hip hop culture since its inception as breakdancers, DJs, rappers, and graffiti artists. The Native American contribution to hip hop can occasionally be veiled by the ethnic umbrella term of Hispanic or Latino, terms that may refer to Native Americans in certain contexts.

Hip hop has grown in popularity not only in urban settings but also in reservations since it has become ubiquitous on television and radio. Political activism and its expression in art have been of great influence due to many social issues present in indigenous communities. Artists such as John Trudell (with his spoken word poetry) and Russell Means (with what he calls his rap-ajo music) have been some of influences with their artistic endeavors.

==Notable artists==
Melle Mel, the first rapper to ever use the epithet &quot;MC&quot;, is Cherokee and Ernie Paniccioli, a photographer of hip hop culture who grew up in Brooklyn, is Cree. Funkdoobiest, Solé, and Litefoot (winner of the Native American Music Award), are also well-known Native American hip hop artists. Wu-Tang affiliate King Just is also Native American and the Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard also claimed to be of Native American descent. Flavor Unit member Apache has also been assumed to be Native American, though a reliable source has yet to be found. In the past, the majority of Native American hip hop was to be found in the underground scene, rarely gaining exposure beyond regional hits. However, artists such as Drezus, Frank Waln, Lil&#x27; Cory, Supaman, DJ oTTo and Red Eagle are just a few newer artists that have gained substantial popularity in recent years.
Some Indigenous artists worry that their blend of traditional music with their own may be seen as disrespectful to their ancestors. However, many elders and hip hop listeners are able to appreciate the mixture, as it can bring multiple generations together through music.

&quot;Hatchet Warrior&quot;, the second album by Native American hip hop artist Anybody Killa, was released in 2003, and peaked at #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Independent Albums chart, #42 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #98 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The organization &quot;Beat Nation&quot; is a Canadian not-for-profit Indigenous hip hop collective with the goal of giving public space to Indigenous artists and their listeners. It is run through a website and exhibits which aim to share &quot;Beat Nation&#x27;s&quot; work and music, as well as give space for Indigenous hip hop culture to operate.

Rapper Young Kidd from Winnipeg, Manitoba is of Jamaican and Aboriginal heritage, and two of the trio group, Winnipeg&#x27;s Most, are Aboriginal - &quot;Jon C&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn&quot;. Winnipeg&#x27;s Most have won several Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards. Both &quot;Young Kidd&quot; and &quot;Winnipeg&#x27;s Most&quot; have achieved high levels of local success in Winnipeg.

Florida rapper Denzel Curry, a pioneer of the Cloud Rap and Soundcloud Rap scene, is of Bahamian and Native American heritage.

==Early Internet pioneering==

The first URL dedicated to Native hip hop in the north was Redhiphop.com, which was started in December of 1999. It was unlike other existing online databases in that it was a standalone site with its own domain name. The site had individual artist sections and playable and downloadable MP3s. Unlike the Native Hip Hop Geocities page, this site had working contracts with artists involved - it was started by Manik out of the Redwire Magazine office. At that time there was already a Geocities page which served as the first online database. After Redhiphop.com, the Geocities page followed suit and bought its own URL - NativeHiphop.net.

Stretching back as early as October 17, 2000, one of the main websites promoting Native hip hop performers has been NativeHipHop.net, a collective effort with submissions from various artists and members of the public.

Offering a wealth of website links, artist reviews and MP3 downloads – NativeHipHop.net was, in the early days, instrumental and invaluable in networking with Indigenous North American hip hop artists and groups such as Shadowyze, Atzlan Underground, Anishinaabe Posse, Gary Davis, Manik, Natay, 7th Generation, Red Power Squad, Quese The Emcee, Night Shield, Reddnation, Rollin Fox, Supaman, King Blizz and War Party, giving them a voice online.

In the five years after 2000, the website grew in popularity and acted as a &#x27;spring-board&#x27; for many of the Native hip hop artists around today.

<text>Sebastián Ignacio González Valdés (; born 14 December 1978), also known as Chamagol, is a Chilean former footballer who played as striker.

==Club career==

He began his football career at Colo-Colo of the first tier of his country, in which he scored 27 goals in 77 appearances during four seasons. In June 2002, he was sold for an undisclosed fee (believed to be a high sum) to Mexican Primera División club Atlante. In his first season with that club, the Apertura Tournament of the same year, González scored 13 goals in 19 appearances and in the following, the 2003 Clausura Tournament, he netted 16 goals in the same number of games, becoming the league&#x27;s top scorer.

There were rumors saying that González was asking for more money from Atlante and that he was not happy to be there. They did give him a raise but that still did not help him want to stay on the team. He was sold to Tigres for about 3.5 million if not 4 million dollars. In the press conference he claimed that his goal was to score over 20 goals in the season. When asked by a reporter why he had chosen such a high number of goals, he responded by saying, &quot;last season I set a number of goals as my goal, and I beat that number. So I want to beat my goal of 20 goals this season.&quot;

After a successful pass at the club of Cancún, which back then played at Estadio Azteca as well as Neza 86 Stadiums, both at Mexico City, González was sold in January 2006 to UANL Tigres of the same league and country. In the next season, was loaned to Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz and the Argentine Primera División club in that moment, Olimpo de Bahía Blanca. In 2008, he signed for Liga de Ascenso of Mexican side León, in where was received by several fans in his first training of the club. In January of the next year, he returned to Colo-Colo on loan, being presented in European style by the team&#x27;s captain Arturo Sanhueza. In his third game for the club, González scored a goal in an historic 3–1 away win over Palmeiras at Parque Antártica.

He joined Cypriot First Division side APOP Kinyras FC, after an unsuccessful season in Colo-Colo, returning in mid-year to Mexico for play in Atlante&#x27;s filial team Potros Neza, scoring eight goals in 27 games for the Liga de Ascenso tournament. Despite his performance and the will of the Chilean to play again for the first team and stay at Mexico, Atlante did not consider González for the first squad due to his lack of form according to that club&#x27;s coach, and he signed for the Bolivian giants The Strongest. He is currently signed to Venezuelan club Caracas FC after a successful stint in Bolivia. After just playing nine matches without scoring for the Venezuelan giants despite belong considered one of the most promising signings of the club, González returned to Chile to play for Palestino in the Chilean Primera División; he argued his decision to end his career scoring seven goals which would leave him at 200 goals in his career. Despite his desire to either retire at Atlante or Colo-Colo, where he is considered historic, González said that he was thankful to be received by Palestino as he was willing to return to Chile. He is currently training to be a coach as well.

==International career==
González played internationally with the Chile national football team at the 2000 Summer Olympics at Sydney, winning the bronze medal also, and in the 2004 Copa América celebrated in Peru. He has scored six goals for his national team in 17 appearances between 2001 and 2005, being two of those officials against Paraguay and Peru.

===International goals===

==Personal life==
González is the nephew of the Chilean former international footballer Francisco &quot;Chamaco&quot; Valdés, a historical player of Colo-Colo. Due to the nickname of his uncle, he is known as &quot;Chamagol&quot;.

==Post retirement==

<doc id="1257834" wikidata="Q56266198" url="?curid=1257834" title="Collegiate Gothic">
<text>Collegiate Gothic is an architectural style subgenre of Gothic Revival architecture, popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries for college and high school buildings in the United States and Canada, and to a certain extent Europe. A form of historicist architecture, it took its inspiration from English Tudor and Gothic buildings. It has returned in the 21st century in the form of prominent new buildings at schools and universities including Cornell, Princeton, Vanderbilt, Washington University, and Yale.

Ralph Adams Cram, arguably the leading Gothic Revival architect and theoretician in the early 20th century, wrote about the appeal of the Gothic for educational facilities in his book &quot;The Gothic Quest:&quot; &quot;Through architecture and its allied arts we have the power to bend men and sway them as few have who depended on the spoken word. It is for us, as part of our duty as our highest privilege to act...for spreading what is true.&quot;

==History==
===Beginnings===
Gothic Revival architecture was used for American college buildings as early as 1829, when &quot;Old Kenyon&quot; was completed on the campus of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. Another early example was Alexander Jackson Davis&#x27;s University Hall (1833–37, demolished 1890), on New York University&#x27;s Washington Square campus. Richard Bond&#x27;s church-like library for Harvard College, Gore Hall (1837–41, demolished 1913), became the model for other library buildings. James Renwick Jr.&#x27;s Free Academy Building (1847–49, demolished 1928), for what is today City College of New York, continued in the style. Inspired by London&#x27;s Hampton Court Palace, Swedish-born Charles Ulricson designed Old Main (1856–57) at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois.

Following the Civil War, many High Victorian Gothic buildings were added to the campuses of American colleges. Examples include Worcester Polytechnic Institute (Boynton Hall, 1868, by Stephen C. Earle); Yale College (Farnam Hall, 1869–70, by Russell Sturgis); the University of Pennsylvania (College Hall, 1870–72, Thomas W. Richards); Harvard College (Memorial Hall, 1870–77, William Robert Ware and Henry Van Brunt); and Cornell University (Sage Hall (1871–75, Charles Babcock). In 1871, English architect William Burges designed a row of vigorous French Gothic-inspired buildings for Trinity College – Seabury Hall, Northam Tower, Jarvis Hall (all completed 1878) – in Hartford, Connecticut.

Tastes became more conservative in the 1880s, and &quot;collegiate architecture soon after came to prefer a more scholarly and less restless Gothic.&quot;

===Movement===
Beginning in the late-1880s, Philadelphia architects Walter Cope and John Stewardson expanded the campus of Bryn Mawr College in an understated English Gothic style that was highly sensitive to site and materials. Inspired by the architecture of Oxford and Cambridge universities, and historicists but not literal copyists, Cope &amp; Stewardson were highly influential in establishing the Collegiate Gothic style. Commissions followed for collections of buildings at the University of Pennsylvania (1895–1911), Princeton University (1896–1902), and Washington University in St. Louis (1899–1909), marking the nascent beginnings of a movement that transformed many college campuses across the country.

In 1901, the firm of Shepley, Rutan &amp; Coolidge created a master plan for a Collegiate Gothic campus for the fledgling University of Chicago, then spent the next 15 years completing it. Some of their works, such as the Mitchell Tower (1901–1908), were near-literal copies of historic buildings.

George Browne Post designed the City College of New York&#x27;s new campus (1903–1907) at Hamilton Heights, Manhattan, in the style.

The style was experienced up-close by a wide audience at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. The World&#x27;s Fair and 1904 Olympic Games were held on the newly completed campus of Washington University, which delayed occupying its buildings until 1905.

The movement gained further momentum when Charles Donagh Maginnis designed Gasson Hall at Boston College in 1908. Maginnis &amp; Walsh went on to design Collegiate Gothic buildings at some twenty-five other campuses, including the main buildings at Emmanuel College (Massachusetts), and the law school at the University of Notre Dame.

Ralph Adams Cram designed a series of Collegiate Gothic buildings for the Princeton University Graduate College (1911–1917).

James Gamble Rogers did extensive work at Yale University, beginning in 1917. Some critics claim he took historicist fantasy to an extreme, while others choose to focus on what is widely considered to be the resulting beautiful and sophisticated Yale campus. Rogers was criticized by the growing Modernist movement. His cathedral-like Sterling Memorial Library (1927–1930), with its ecclesiastical imagery and lavish use of ornament, came under vocal attack from one of Yale&#x27;s own undergraduates:

A modern building constructed for purely modern needs has no excuse for going off in an orgy of meretricious medievalism and stale iconography.

Other architects, notably John Russell Pope and Bertram Goodhue (who just before his death sketched the original version of Yale&#x27;s Sterling Library from which Rogers worked), advocated for and contributed to Yale&#x27;s particular version of Collegiate Gothic.

When McMaster University moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canadian architect William Lyon Somerville designed its new campus (1928–1930) in the style.

===Origins of the term===

American architect Alexander Jackson Davis is &quot;generally credited with coining the term&quot; documented in a handwritten description of his own &quot;English Collegiate Gothic Mansion&quot; of 1853 for the Harrals of Bridgeport, Connecticut. By the 1890s, the movement was known as &quot;Collegiate Gothic&quot;.

===1904 commentary===
In his praise for Cope &amp; Stewardson&#x27;s Quadrangle Dormitories at the University of Pennsylvania, architect Ralph Adams Cram revealed some of the racial and cultural implications underlying the Collegiate Gothic:

===Culmination===

Collegiate Gothic complexes were most often horizontal compositions, save for a single tower or towers serving as an exclamation.

At the University of Pittsburgh, Charles Klauder was commissioned by University of Pittsburgh chancellor John Gabbert Bowman to design a tall building in the form of a Gothic tower. What he produced, the Cathedral of Learning (1926–37), has been described as the literal culmination of late Gothic Revival architecture. A combination of Gothic spire and modern skyscraper, the steel-frame, limestone-clad, 42-story structure is both the world&#x27;s second tallest university building and Gothic-styled edifice. The tower contain a half-acre Gothic hall supported only by its 52-foot (16 m) tall arches. It is accompanied by the campus&#x27;s other Gothic Revival structures by Klauder, including the Stephen Foster Memorial (1935–1937) and the French Gothic Heinz Memorial Chapel (1933–1938).

===21st-century revival===
A number of colleges and universities have commissioned major new buildings in the Collegiate Gothic style in recent years. These include Princeton University&#x27;s Whitman College, designed by Porphyrios Associates, and Benjamin Franklin College and Pauli Murray College, both designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects, at Yale University. The University of Southern California&#x27;s USC Village was created as an inexpensive post-modern nod to collegiate revival. (Harley Ellis Devereaux, 2017).

<text>Humour is an integral part of the Canadian identity. There are several traditions in Canadian humour in both English and French. While these traditions are distinct and at times very different, there are common themes that relate to Canadians&#x27; shared history and geopolitical situation in North America and the world. Though neither universally kind nor moderate, humorous Canadian literature has often been branded by author Dick Bourgeois-Doyle as &quot;gentle satire,&quot; evoking the notion embedded in humorist Stephen Leacock&#x27;s definition of humour as &quot;the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life and the artistic expression thereof.&quot;

The primary characteristics of Canadian humour are irony, parody, and satire. Various trends can be noted in Canadian comedy. One thread is the portrayal of a &quot;typical&quot; Canadian family in an ongoing radio or television series. Examples include &quot;La famille Plouffe&quot;, with its mix of drama, humour, politics and religion and sitcoms such as &quot;King of Kensington&quot; and &quot;La Petite Vie&quot;. Another major thread tends to be political and cultural satire: television shows such as &quot;CODCO,&quot; &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;, &quot;La Fin du monde est à 7 heures&quot; and &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes,&quot; monologuists such as Yvon Deschamps and Rick Mercer and writers, including Michel Tremblay, Will Ferguson and Eric Nicol draw their material from Canadian and Québécois society and politics. Other comedians portray absurdity; these include the television series &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; and &quot;The Frantics,&quot; and musician-comedians such as The Arrogant Worms, Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie and Bowser and Blue. Elements of satire are to be found throughout Canadian humour, evident in each of these threads, and uniting various genres and regional cultural differences.

As with other countries, humour at the expense of regional and ethnic stereotypes can be found in Canada. Examples are &#x27;Newfie&#x27; jokes (with &#x27;Newfie&#x27; being a colloquial term for a person from the island of Newfoundland) and jokes revolving around English-speaking Canadians&#x27; stereotype of French Canadians, and vice versa.

Humber College in Toronto and the École nationale de l&#x27;humour in Montreal offer post-secondary programs in comedy writing and performance. Montreal is also home to the bilingual (English and French) Just for Laughs festival and to the Just for Laughs museum, a bilingual, international museum of comedy.

==Literature==

According to author Stephen Scobie, Canadian humorous writing has tended more towards prose than poetry. An early work of Canadian humour, Thomas McCulloch&#x27;s &quot;Letters of Mephibosheth Stepsure&quot; (1821–23) appeared in the Halifax weekly &quot;Acadian Recorder&quot;. Northrop Frye described McCulloch&#x27;s satirical letters as &quot;quiet, observant, deeply conservative in a human sense&quot;; he asserted that McCulloch&#x27;s persona, the &quot;conventional, old-fashioned, homespun&quot; farmer, was an extension of a centuries-old satiric tradition, and that the letters set the tone for later comedic writing in Canada.

Compared to McCulloch&#x27;s dry and understated style, Thomas Chandler Haliburton showed the same conservative social values in the brash, overstated character of Sam Slick, the Yankee Clockmaker. Haliburton&#x27;s Sam Slick persona in &quot;The Clockmaker&quot; (1836), as Arthur Scobie notes in &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;proved immensely popular and, ironically, has influenced American humour as much as Canadian.&quot;

Authors responded with folk humour and satire to the domination of 19th-century French Canadian culture by the Catholic Church. Napoléon Aubin satirized Quebec public life in his journals &quot;Le Fantasque&quot; (1837–45) and &quot;Le Castor&quot; (1843), and through his theatre troupe, &quot;Les Amateurs typographiques, &quot; established in 1839. He was imprisoned during that same year for his views. This cosmopolitan tradition is also seen in the journalism of Arthur Buies, editor of &quot;La Lanterne canadienne&quot; (1868–69), a highly satirical journal of that era.

Light comedy that mocked local customs was typical of 19th-century theatre in Quebec. Examples include Joseph Quesnel&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Anglomanie, ou le dîner à l&#x27;angloise&quot; (1803), which criticized the imitation of English customs, and Pierre Petitclair&#x27;s &quot;Une partie de campagne&quot; (1865). More serious dramas attacked specific targets: the anonymous &quot;Les Comédies du status quo&quot; (1834) ridiculed local politics, and &quot;Le Défricheteur de langue&quot; (1859) by Isodore Mesplats, (pseudonym of Joseph LaRue and Joseph-Charles Taché), mocked Parisian manners. Other examples of theatrical satire were Félix-Gabriel Marchand&#x27;s comedy, &quot;Les faux brillants&quot; (1885) and Louvigny de Montigny&#x27;s &quot;Les Boules de neige&quot; (1903), which took aim at Montreal&#x27;s bourgeoisie. Humorous magazines in French included &quot;La Guêpe&quot;, &quot;journal qui pique&quot;, published in Montreal 1857–1861.

By the early 20th century, the satirical tradition was well developed in English Canada as exemplified in the writing of Stephen Leacock. In &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot; (1912), Leacock, already known for his satirical wit, used tragic irony and astute insight in examining day-to-day, small-town life. The book remains a classic of Canadian literature, and was followed by &quot;Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich&quot; in 1914. An annual Canadian literary award, the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour, is named in his memory. The award is presented to the year&#x27;s best work of humorous literature by a Canadian. Donald Jack, three-time winner of the Leacock Medal, wrote a number of comedies for the stage, radio, and television, but is best known for his nine-part series of novels about aviator Bartholomew Bandy.

Following the &quot;Révolution tranquille&quot; in Quebec, theatrical satire reappeared in 1968 with Michel Tremblay&#x27;s play &quot;Les Belles sœurs,&quot; written in Québécois joual. The controversial play picked apart the myth of a stable bourgeois Quebec society with a mix of realistic comedy and allegorical satire. Following Tremblay&#x27;s lead, Jean Barbeau exposed Quebec popular culture in &quot;La Coupe stainless&quot; (1974). Tremblay and Barbeau set the stage for reviews such as &quot;Broue&quot; (1979), a collective production, which toured English-speaking Canada as &quot;Brew&quot; (1982).

Humorous fiction in French Canada draws from the oral tradition of folk songs and folktales which were the common coin of humour in the 19th century. Only a few of these folk tales surfaced in writing prior to the 20th century. However, contemporary writers such as Jacques Ferron (&quot;Contes du pays incertain,&quot; 1962) in Quebec and Antonine Maillet in Acadian New Brunswick (&quot;La Sagouine,&quot; 1974, and &quot;Pélagie-la-Charrette,&quot; 1979), rely extensively on folk humour and popular culture. Other Quebec writers noted for their humour include Roger Lemelin, Gérard Bessette, Jacques Godbout, Roch Carrier and Yves Beauchemin. Beauchemin&#x27;s picaresque novel &quot;Le Matou&quot; (1981) is the all-time best-selling novel in Quebec literature.

The plain talking alter-ego as an instrument of satire continued with Robertson Davies&#x27; series of Samuel Marchbanks books (1947–67) and John Metcalf&#x27;s James Wells in &quot;General Ludd&quot; (1980). Davies is one of many Canadian writers of &quot;serious&quot; literature who were also known for humour in their work. Margaret Atwood, Farley Mowat, Paul Quarrington, Mordecai Richler, Raymond Fraser, Carol Shields, W. O. Mitchell, Ray Guy, Pierre Berton, M.A.C. Farrant and Miriam Toews are all well-known writers of mainstream literature who have also been acknowledged for using humour and wit in their writing. Many other writers of Canadian humour have been published as newspaper or magazine commentators, including Gary Lautens, Richard J. Needham, Eric Nicol, Joey Slinger, Will Ferguson, Marsha Boulton and Linwood Barclay.

Humour is also central to the work of Canadian children&#x27;s writers such as Gordon Korman, Dennis Lee and Robert Munsch.

==Music==

Particularly in recent years, Canada has produced a number of musical groups who have been described as &quot;comedy rock&quot;. Bands such as Barenaked Ladies, Odds, Crash Test Dummies, The Awkward Stage and Rheostatics are sometimes misunderstood as being strictly novelty bands, but in fact many of their songs use humour to illuminate more serious themes. A number of other acts, such as Corky and the Juice Pigs, Arrogant Worms, Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie and Bowser and Blue write specifically comedic songs.

Nancy White is a noted Canadian musical satirist, whose comedic folk songs about Canadian culture and politics have regularly appeared on CBC Radio programs.

In addition to more serious material on his primary albums, folk musician Geoff Berner — who has also run for political office as a candidate of the Rhinoceros Party — frequently releases pointedly satirical songs, such as &quot;Official Theme Song for the 2010 Vancouver / Whistler Olympic Games (The Dead Children Were Worth It!)&quot;, as free downloads from his website.

Don Ast, a stand-up comedian who performed in character as befuddled Ukrainian immigrant Nestor Pistor, had his greatest popular success with an album in which he sang country songs in character as Pistor. His single &quot;Winestoned Plowboy&quot;, a parody of Glen Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot;, was a hit on Canada&#x27;s country music charts in 1977; Pistor returned to more conventional standup comedy thereafter, but received three Juno Award nominations for Comedy Album of the Year in the next three years.

Jann Arden, a singer-songwriter renowned for writing sad love songs, is also paradoxically known as one of Canada&#x27;s funniest live performers, whose witty, unpretentious stage patter about herself and her family is as much a part of her relationship with her audience as her music is. She portrayed a fictionalized version of herself in the CTV sitcom &quot;Jann&quot;. Rapper Shad tackles weighty topics with his lyrics but is also known for using humour; for one of his most successful singles to date, &quot;The Old Prince Still Lives at Home&quot;, he filmed a video that essentially parodied of the opening credits to &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel Air&quot;.

Another noted Canadian musical comedian is Mary Lou Fallis, an opera singer who performs both in classical opera roles and as the comedic character &quot;Primadonna&quot;, a touring stage show in which she parodies popular stereotypes of opera divas.

Canadian heavy metal frontman Devin Townsend is known for using humour in his music. Projects such as Punky Bruster and Ziltoid the Omniscient are heavily comedy driven, and Devin&#x27;s heavy metal band, Strapping Young Lad, use satire and sarcastic tongue in cheek lyrics as well.

==Radio==

Many of Canada&#x27;s comedy acts and performers have started out on radio, primarily on the national Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) network.

While individual comedy show and segments have been around almost as long as the network, the focus has tended be more on specific shows featuring particular groups of comedians. The real beginnings of Canadian radio comedy began in the late 1930s with the debut of &quot;The Happy Gang&quot;, a long-running weekly variety show that was regularly sprinkled with corny jokes in between tunes. It debuted in 1938 and ran until 1959. The &quot;Wayne &amp; Shuster&quot; show debuted on CBC radio in 1946, their more literate and classy humour regularly appearing on the airwaves well into the early 1960s.
Max Ferguson&#x27;s long-running shows &quot;After Breakfast Breakdown&quot; and &quot;the Max Ferguson Show&quot; featured short satirical skits based on current events, with a variety of characters voiced by Ferguson.

The &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; started as a radio show debuting in 1973 featuring mainly political and some character-based comedy sketches. It ran for 24 years before making a permanent transition to television. It started a tradition of topical and politically satirical radio shows that inspired such programs as &quot;Double Exposure&quot;, &quot;The Muckraker&quot; and &quot;What a Week&quot;.

A zanier, more surreal brand of radio comedy was unveiled in the early 1980s with the debut of The Frantics&#x27; &quot;Frantic Times&quot; radio show, which ran from 1981 to 1986. Its smart and surreal style fostered a new take on Canadian radio comedy that was followed by the likes of successor shows as &quot;The Norm&quot;, &quot;Radio Free Vestibule&quot; and &quot;The Irrelevant Show&quot;.

Another enduring radio comedy program is &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot;, hosted by Stuart McLean. The show is centred around McLean&#x27;s Dave and Morley stories, a series of narrated short stories about a Toronto family and their friends and neighbours; many of the stories have been compiled in book form, and the books have often won or been nominated for the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour.

Satirical and zany elements merged in two of the more notable CBC radio comedy shows of the 1990s: &quot;The Dead Dog Cafe Comedy Hour&quot; offered bitingly satirical pieces from a First Nations perspective mixed in with general silliness, and &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, was set in a fictitious Newfoundland &quot;national&quot; radio station featuring improbable news stories, fictitious archival recordings, and unlikely archeological findings played straight.

CBC Radio continues to play an important part in developing comedy performers on radio. &quot;Madly Off In All Directions&quot; became a weekly national forum for regional sketch and stand-up comics, a practice that continues in the more recent series &quot;The Debaters&quot; and &quot;Laugh Out Loud&quot;.

Just for Laughs Radio, a channel programmed and broadcast by SiriusXM Satellite Radio to Canada and the United States, features predominantly Canadian comedy.

==Television==
CBC Television&#x27;s first Canadian-produced television series was &quot;Sunshine Sketches&quot;, an adaptation of Stephen Leacock&#x27;s iconic humour book &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot;.

Original Canadian television comedy begins with Wayne and Shuster, a sketch comedy duo who performed as a comedy team during the Second World War, and moved their act to radio in 1946 before moving on to television. They became one of Canada&#x27;s most enduring comedy teams on Canadian television and in the United States as well: they appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; 67 times, a record for any performer. Their Julius Caesar sketch, &quot;Rinse the Blood off My Toga&quot;, with its legendary catchphrase, &quot;I told him, Julie, don&#x27;t go!&quot;, was particularly noted.

Wayne and Shuster continued to appear on CBC Television until the late 1980s, with specials that mixed new sketches with their classic material.

&quot;La famille Plouffe&quot;, the first regularly scheduled television drama in Canada, was produced in 1953 by Radio-Canada, in French. The program was broadcast on both English and French networks of CBC TV from 1954 to 1959, (in English as &quot;The Plouffe Family&quot;). It was a mix of drama, humour and social commentary about a working-class Quebec family in the post-World War II era. Another of the CBC&#x27;s earliest productions was &quot;Sunshine Sketches&quot;, a television adaptation of one of the enduring classics of Canadian humour writing, Stephen Leacock&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot;.

Another pioneer in Canadian television comedy was, oddly, a news series. &quot;This Hour Has Seven Days,&quot; which debuted in 1964, was primarily meant as a newsmagazine, but its segments included political satire as well as serious news reports. Later series such as &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;, &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; and &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot; have all drawn on the tradition of political satire established by &quot;Seven Days&quot;, and have been among Canadian television&#x27;s most popular comedy series in recent years.

Canadian born Lorne Michaels, who had moved from Toronto to Los Angeles in 1968 to work on Rowan and Martin&#x27;s &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, launched the NBC comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1975. Over the years, several Canadians were part of the SNL cast, including Dan Aykroyd, Martin Short, and Mike Myers. Michaels also produced &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; for Canadian TV in the 1980s.

Many Canadian comedy shows, while not directly about politics per se, have made profound political statements by satirizing society and pop culture. This includes shows such as &quot;SCTV&quot;, &quot;Buzz&quot; and &quot;CODCO&quot;. &quot;CODCO&quot;, in particular, was intensely controversial at times for its use of comedy in tackling sensitive subjects; founding member Andy Jones quit CODCO in protest after the CBC refused to air a sketch that made a very explicit political statement about the Mount Cashel Orphanage child abuse scandal. The series &quot;History Bites&quot; was ostensibly a show presenting history in a sketch comedy, but frequently used the historic setting to satirize current political events and social trends.

Other shows, such as &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, &quot;4 on the Floor&quot;, &quot;Bizarre&quot; and &quot;Puppets Who Kill&quot;, revelled in absurdist humour, making household names out of characters such as Chicken Lady, Mr. Canoehead and Super Dave Osborne.

Other notable sketch series have included &quot;Zut!&quot;, &quot;The Gavin Crawford Show&quot; and &quot;The Holmes Show&quot;. Canadian television also frequently showcases stand-up comedians. The popular series &quot;Comics!&quot;, based around one comedian each week, has been the first national television exposure for many of Canada&#x27;s current comedy stars. Another series, &quot;Just for Laughs&quot;, has for many years presented comedians appearing at the Montreal Comedy Festival. That series has also spawned the more recent &quot;Just For Laughs Gags&quot;, a practical joke show similar to &quot;Candid Camera&quot;.

Although several notable Canadian sitcoms have been produced, such as &quot;Excuse My French&quot;, &quot;King of Kensington&quot;, &quot;Hangin&#x27; In&quot;, &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot;, Letterkenny, &quot;Mr. D&quot;, &quot;Kim&#x27;s Convenience&quot;, and &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot;, many other sitcoms, including &quot;Material World&quot;, &quot;Mosquito Lake&quot;, &quot;Snow Job&quot;, &quot;Check it Out!&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Tracy&quot;, &quot;Rideau Hall&quot; and &quot;Not My Department&quot;, have often fared poorly with critics and audiences. Critic Geoff Pevere has pointed out, however, that American television has produced a lot of bad sitcoms as well. The difference, according to Pevere, is that the economics of television production in Canada mean that whereas an unpopular American sitcom may be cancelled and largely forgotten after just a few weeks, Canadian television networks can rarely afford to lose their investment — meaning that a Canadian sitcom almost always airs every episode that was produced, &quot;regardless&quot; of its performance in the ratings.

According to television critic Bill Brioux, there are a number of structural reasons for this: the shorter seasons, typical of Canadian television production, make it harder for audiences to connect with a program before its season has concluded, and put even successful shows at risk of losing their audience between seasons because of the longer waiting time before a show returns with new episodes; the more limited marketing budgets available to Canadian television networks mean that audiences are less likely to be aware that the show exists in the first place; and the shows tend to resemble American sitcoms, in the hope of securing a lucrative sale to an American television network, even though by and large the Canadian sitcoms that have been successful have been ones, such as &quot;Corner Gas&quot; or &quot;King of Kensington&quot;, that had a more distinctively Canadian flavour.

On the other hand, Canadian television comedy fares much better when it breaks the sitcom form, especially with dramedy. Unconventional comedy series such as &quot;The Beachcombers&quot;, &quot;Due South&quot;, &quot;Made in Canada&quot;, &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny&quot;, &quot;Chilly Beach&quot;, &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, &quot;Primetime Glick&quot;, &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;, &quot;La Petite Vie&quot;, &quot;Seeing Things&quot;, &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;, &quot;Supertown Challenge&quot;, &quot;Les Bougon&quot; and &quot;Twitch City&quot; have been much more successful than most of Canada&#x27;s conventional sitcoms, both in Canada and as international exports.

Canada has a national television channel, The Comedy Network, devoted to comedy. Its programming includes some of the classic Canadian comedy series noted above, repeats of several hit American and British series such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot; and &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, and original series such as &quot;Kevin Spencer&quot;, &quot;Odd Job Jack&quot;, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocates&quot;, &quot;Improv Heaven and Hell&quot; and &quot;Puppets Who Kill&quot;.

Rick Mercer began his career in 1990 with a touring one-man show, &quot;Show Me the Button, I&#x27;ll Push It&quot;, about Canadian life in the immediate aftermath of the failed Meech Lake Accord. That show was a sellout success; in 1993, he made his television debut as one of the writers and performers on &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. Mercer&#x27;s &quot;rants&quot;, short op-ed pieces on Canadian politics and culture, quickly became the show&#x27;s signature segment. When he published a collection of rants in 1998 as &quot;Streeters&quot;, the book quickly became a bestseller. Mercer left &quot;22 Minutes&quot; in 2000 to devote more time to his other series, &quot;Made in Canada&quot;. When that series ended its run, he launched the new &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;.

Another famous comedic export in the same era was Tom Green, whose surreal and sometimes grotesque humour on &quot;The Tom Green Show&quot; began as a community cable show in Ottawa before becoming a hit on MTV.

As with many other genres, Canadian television comedy also frequently plays with the topic of Canada&#x27;s relationship with the United States. Mercer turned another &quot;22 Minutes&quot; segment, &quot;Talking to Americans&quot;, into a 2001 television special, which was a ratings smash. In &quot;Talking to Americans&quot;, Mercer, in his &quot;22 Minutes&quot; guise as reporter &quot;J.B. Dixon&quot;, visited American cities to ask people on the street for their opinion on a Canadian news story — the joke for Canadians was that the news story was always fabricated, and either inherently ridiculous (e.g. a border dispute between Quebec and Chechnya or an annual Toronto polar bear hunt) or blatantly out of context (e.g. wishing Canadians a &quot;Happy Stockwell Day&quot;.)

Another notable show, the sitcom &quot;An American in Canada&quot;, reversed that formula, finding comedy in the culture shock of an American television reporter taking a job with a Canadian TV station. Tom Green once played with this staple of Canadian comedy as well, during a controversial segment in which he burned a Canadian flag.

==Film==
Film critic Barry Hertz created a list of the 23 best Canadian comedy films ever made for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in 2023, although he included two films that had Canadian themes, settings and creative participants but were not Canadian productions:

In addition to Hertz&#x27;s own selections, sidebars asking other notable figures in Canadian comedy to identify their own choices singled out the films &quot;Rare Birds&quot; as a choice of Mercer and &quot;You&#x27;re Sleeping Nicole&quot; as a favourite of Levack, while Mark Critch reiterated Hertz&#x27;s choice of &quot;Seducing Doctor Lewis&quot;.

==Web==
In the same vein as &quot;Air Farce&quot; and &quot;22 Minutes&quot;, a number of notable web sites have emerged to publish articles that either satirize real events or wholly invent stories that lampoon aspects of Canadian culture. Frank magazine, which originated as a printed publication, has been joined in recent years by The Beaverton, The Daily Bonnet, and Walking Eagle News each broadly modelled after The Onion.

==Comedy clubs==
Notable Canadian comedy clubs and showcases include The Second City branch in Toronto (originally housed at The Old Fire Hall), the Yuk Yuk&#x27;s chain, and The ALTdot COMedy Lounge. The top clubs in Canada are Rumor&#x27;s Comedy Club in Winnipeg, The Comic Strip in Edmonton, The Laugh Shop in Calgary, and Absolute Comedy in Ottawa.

==Awards==

The Canadian Comedy Awards were founded by Tim Progosh and Higher Ground Productions in 1999, and present awards for achievements in Canadian comedy across a variety of domains, including live performance, radio, film, television, and Internet media.

The Canadian Screen Awards present a number of awards for television comedy, including Best Comedy Series and awards for performance, writing and direction in comedy series.

Just for Laughs and SiriusXM Canada stage an annual SiriusXM Top Comic competition for Canadian stand-up comedians. The annual Tim Sims Encouragement Award also provides a $2,500 prize to an emerging comedian.

The annual Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour is presented to works of comedic literature, across both fiction and non-fiction genres.

<doc id="1257842" wikidata="Q862758" url="?curid=1257842" title="Book of Rites">
<text>The Book of Rites, also known as the Liji, is a collection of texts describing the social forms, administration, and ceremonial rites of the Zhou dynasty as they were understood in the Warring States and the early Han periods. The &quot;Book of Rites&quot;, along with the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; (&quot;Zhōulǐ&quot;) and the &quot;Book of Etiquette and Rites&quot; (&quot;Yílǐ&quot;), which are together known as the &quot;Three Li (&quot;Sānlǐ&quot;),&quot; constitute the ritual (&quot;lǐ&quot;) section of the Five Classics which lay at the core of the traditional Confucian canon (each of the &quot;five&quot; classics is a group of works rather than a single text). As a core text of the Confucian canon, it is also known as the Classic of Rites or Lijing, which some scholars believe was the original title before it was changed by Dai Sheng.

== History ==
The &quot;Book of Rites&quot; is a diverse collection of texts of uncertain origin and date that lacks the overall structure found in the other &quot;rites&quot; texts (the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; and the &quot;Etiquette and Ceremonial&quot;). Some sections consist of definitions of ritual terms, particularly those found in the &quot;Etiquette and Ceremonial&quot;, while others contain details of the life and teachings of Confucius. Parts of the text have been traced to such pre-Han works as the &quot;Xunzi&quot; and &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, while others are believed to date from the Former Han period.

During the reign of Qin Shihuang, many of the Confucian classics were destroyed during the 213 BC &quot;Burning of the Books.&quot; However, the Qin dynasty collapsed within the decade and Confucian scholars who had memorized the classics, or hid written copies recompiled them in the early Han dynasty. The &quot;Book of Rites&quot; was said to have been fully reconstructed, but the &quot;Classic of Music&quot; could not be recompiled and fragments principally survive in the &quot;Record of Music&quot; (&quot;Yueji&quot;) chapter of the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;.

Since then, other scholars have attempted to redact these first drafts. According to the &quot;Book of Sui&quot;, Dai De reworked the text in the 1st century BC, reducing the original 214 books to 85 in the &quot;Ritual Records of Dai the Elder&quot; ( &#x27;), his nephew Dai Sheng further reduced this to 46 books in the &quot;Ritual Records of Dai the Younger&quot; ( &#x27;), and finally Ma Rong added three books to this bringing the total to 49. Later scholarship has disputed the &quot;Book of Sui&quot;&#x27;s account as there is no reliable evidence to attribute these revisions to either Dai De or Dai Sheng, although both of them were Confucian scholars specialising in various texts concerning &quot;li&quot;. 

At this time, these texts were still being edited, with new script and old script versions circulating, and the content not yet fixed. When Zheng Xuan, a student of Ma Rong, composed his annotated text of the &quot;Rites&quot; he combined all of the traditions of ritual learning to create a fixed edition of the 49 books which are the standard to this day. Zheng Xuan&#x27;s annotated edition of the &quot;Rites&quot; became the basis of the &quot;Right Meaning of the Ritual Records&quot; ( ) which was the imperially authorised text and commentary on the &quot;Rites&quot; established in 653 AD.

In 1993, a copy of the &quot;Black Robes&quot; chapter was found in Tomb 1 of the Guodian Tombs in Jingmen, Hubei. Since the tomb was sealed around 300 BCE, the find reactivated academic arguments about the dating of the other &quot;Liji&quot; chapters by the Warring States period.

==“Li”==

Confucius described “Li” as all traditional forms that provided a standard of conduct. “Li” literally means &quot;rites&quot; but it can also be used to refer to &quot;ceremonial&quot; or &quot;rules of conduct.” The term has come to generally be associated with &quot;good form,” &quot;decorum&quot; or &quot;politeness.” Confucius felt that “li” should emphasize the spirit of piety and respect for others through rules of conduct and ceremonies. As outlined in the “Book of Rites,” “li” is meant to restore the significance of traditional forms by looking at the simplicity of the past. Confucius insisted that a standard of conduct that focused on traditional forms would be a way to ease the turmoil of collapsing Zhou state. The absolute power of “li” is displayed in the “Book of Rites”: &quot;Of all things to which the people owe their lives the rites are the most important...&quot; The ideas of “li” were thought to become closely associated with human nature, ethics, and social order as the population integrated “li” into their lives. “Li” is beneficial to society because it guides people to recognize and fulfill their responsibilities toward others.

== Legacy ==
As a result of the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;&#x27; chapters, using a syncretic system later scholars formed both the &quot;Great Learning&quot; and the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;. These two books were both believed to be written by two of Confucius&#x27; disciples; one specifically being his grandson. The Neo-Confucian Zhu Xi and his edited versions of the &quot;Great Learning&quot; and the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; influenced the Chinese society to place much more attention on these and two other books creating the Four Books. Following the decision of the Yuan dynasty (followed by the Ming and Qing) to make the Five Classics and the Four Books the orthodox texts of the Confucian traditions, they were the standard textbooks for the state civil examination, from 1313 to 1905, which every educated person had to study intensively. Consequently, the &quot;Book of Rites&quot; and two of its by-products were large integral parts of the Chinese beliefs and industry for many centuries.

===Comparisons===
The Han Feizi&#x27;s editor (W.K. Liao 1939) contrasts the Han Feizi&#x27;s chapter six with the Book of Rites (Li Ki), taking some of the chapter&#x27;s content as &quot;diametrically opposed to the Confucian spirit&quot;, and the &quot;Great Community of Confucius.&quot; The Han Feizi has elements that would be compared with the Daodejing.

<doc id="1257859" wikidata="Q7206456" url="?curid=1257859" title="Pocket universe">
<text>A pocket universe or bubble universe, also called pocket dimension, is a concept in inflationary theory, proposed by Alan Guth.

==Description==
It defines a realm like the one that contains the observable universe as only one of many inflationary zones.

Astrophysicist Jean-Luc Lehners, of the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science, has argued that an inflationary universe does produce pockets. In his 2012 journal, Lehners wrote about how pocket universes can emerge as a result of eternal inflation. The mechanisms of inflation within these pocket universes could function in a variety of manners, such as slow-roll inflation, undergoing cycles of cosmological evolution, or resembling of the Galilean genesis or other &#x27;emergent&#x27; universe scenarios. Lehners goes on to discuss which one of these types of universes we live in, and how that is dependent on the measurement of the regulation of infinities inherent in eternal inflation.

But, Lehners continues, &quot;the current leading measure proposals—namely, the global light-cone cutoff and its local counterpart, the causal diamond measure—as well as closely related proposals, all predict that we should live in a pocket universe that starts out with a small Hubble rate, thus favoring emergent and cyclic models.&quot; Lehners adds, &quot;Pocket universes which undergo cycles are further preferred, because they produce habitable conditions repeatedly inside each pocket.&quot;

==In media==
Pocket dimensions are used as a plot device in myriad media. In the SCP Foundation series of collaborative writing, SCP-106, otherwise known as &quot;The Old Man,&quot; dwells in a pocket dimension into which it lures its victims.

<text>Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a substance often used as a recreational drug and is known to have euphoriant and stimulant properties. Several studies conducted between 2000 and 2011 found that the effects of BZP are similar to amphetamine, although BZP&#x27;s dosage is roughly 10 times higher by weight.

Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity and seizures. Deaths from piperazine derivatives are extremely rare, but there has been at least one death apparently due to BZP alone. Its sale is banned in several countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania and other parts of Europe.

== History ==

=== Development history ===
BZP was first synthesized by Burroughs Wellcome &amp; Company in 1944. It is often claimed that it was originally synthesized as a potential antihelminthic (anti-parasitic) agent for use in farm animals, but its synthesis is thought to predate their interest in piperazines as antihelminthics. Even so, the majority of the early work with the piperazines were investigations into their potential use as antihelminthics, with the earliest clinical trials in the literature relating to piperazine being articles in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in the 1950s. It was discovered that BZP had side effects and was largely abandoned as a worm treatment. It next appears in the literature in the 1970s when it was investigated as a potential antidepressant medication, but rejected when research reported that BZP had amphetamine-like effects and was liable to abuse. The study suggested that BZP &quot;should be placed under statutory control similar to those regulating the use of amphetamine&quot;.

=== Recreational history ===
In 1996, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration noted that it was being recreationally used in California. It also reported that BZP was being used as an adulterant in illicit drugs. In around 2000, its use increased worldwide, which was soon followed by legislative control in Europe and the United States. In New Zealand, it was initially legal, but was restricted in 2005 and later reclassified as Class C due to new evidence in 2008. It was widely used before its reclassification, and an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007. BZP, which is often mixed with TFMPP, has been claimed to be a safer alternative to other illicit street drugs. It is also used as an adulterant of or substitute for MDMA, which has similar effects, and is sometimes marketed as &quot;ecstasy&quot;, a colloquial term for MDMA.

BZP has also been used and prohibited in horse racing and athletics.

== Production and distribution ==
BZP is a piperazine derivative which comes as either the hydrochloride salt or a free base. The hydrochloride salt is a white solid while the base form is a slightly yellowish-green liquid. BZP base is corrosive and causes burns.

BZP is often marketed ostensibly as a &quot;dietary supplement&quot; to avoid meeting stricter laws that apply to medicines and drugs, despite the fact that BZP has no dietary value. As of late 2005, the Misuse of Drugs Act ensured it can no longer be classified or marketed as a dietary supplement in New Zealand. Some retailers claim that BZP is a &quot;natural&quot; product, describing it as a &quot;pepper extract&quot; or &quot;herbal high,&quot; when in fact the drug is entirely synthetic, and has not been found to occur naturally.

== Pharmacodynamics ==
BZP has been shown to have a mixed mechanism of action, acting on the serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor systems in a similar fashion to MDMA. BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the serotonin reuptake transporter, which increase serotonin concentrations in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cell and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors. BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP has a high affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released noradrenaline. Another study lists 1-Benzylpiperazine (BZP)&#x27;s Release DAT, NET, and SERT EC50s (i.e. a measure of potency for the release of neurotransmitters via BZP&#x27;s affinity for the dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters respectively--whereby those transporter are induced to shuttle neurotransmitters out of neurons and deposit them in the synaptic gap) as 175, 62, and 6050; for comparison, the values listed for d-amphetamine (25, 7, and 1765) and d-methamphetamine (25, 12, and 736) show a similar DAT:NET affinity ratio as well as minor SERT activity which suggests BZP possesses similar activity to the two aforementioned drugs (when dosed ~7x higher due to lower potency) rather than serotonergic substituted amphetamines like MDMA.

BZP also acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist on a wide variety of serotonin receptors. Binding to 5-HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5-HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5-HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.

== Effects ==
The effects of BZP are largely similar to amphetamines, with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts were unable to distinguish between dextroamphetamine and BZP administered intravenously. A 2005 study has shown that mixtures of BZP with other piperazine drugs such as TFMPP share certain pharmacodynamic traits with MDMA.

=== Subjective effects ===

Upon ingestion of between 50 mg and 200 mg of BZP, the user may experience any or all of the following:

Initial Effects:
* Feelings of euphoria, wonder, amazement, well-being, energy and elation
* Rapid mood elevation
* Enhanced sociability
* Enhanced appreciation of music
* Increased desire to move, also slight increase in stereotypy
* Skin tingling
* Decreased appetite
* Repetitive thought patterns
* Actual and perceived changes in body temperature
* Mild jaw clenching/bruxism
* Increased heart rate
* Dilation of pupils (see photo)
* Nausea
* Flushing
* Mild xerostomia (dry mouth)
* Slight urinary incontinence, often described as &quot;leaking&quot; a small amount of urine after urinating (not due to loss of bladder control)
Later Effects:
* Mild headache
* Nausea
* Hangover-like symptoms (common with high doses)
* Fatigue
* Indigestion (similar to acid indigestion/heartburn)
* Increased hunger (and sometimes thirst)
* Insomnia
* Confusion
* Depression (particularly with frequent/heavy use)
=== Tolerance ===

Research into BZP&#x27;s tolerance is sparse. Anecdotal evidence from online sources claim tolerance to the central action of BZP will develop quickly. Due to tiredness associated with the body&#x27;s recovery from stimulants, such as BZP, it is uncommon for users to be able to sustain a week-long intake.

=== Toxic effects ===
As with most sympathomimetic stimulants, significant side effects are associated with BZP use. It reportedly produces insomnia and a mild to severe hangover after the drug effect wears off. The majority of the toxic effects information came from a 2005 study that recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand. Fourteen toxic seizures were recorded in two patients with life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.

The major side effects include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, pruritus, confusion, agitation, tremor, extrapyramidal symptoms (dystonia, akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, collapse, hyperventilation, sweating, hyperthermia and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or as part of a medicolegal death investigation.

=== Risk of fatality ===
Ingestion of piperazine derivatives alone rarely causes death. A retrospective study carried out at an Auckland emergency department found that BZP presentations only made a minor contribution to their overdose database, with most cases not producing any significant toxicity. One death has been attributed to ingestion of BZP alone; in this case its blood concentration was measured to be 8 mg/L.

Combined with alcohol or other illicit drugs, such as TFMPP and MDMA, multiple deaths have been reported. A combination of BZP and MDMA ingested by a 23-year-old DJ nearly resulted in death. He was put into an induced coma, and later recovered. In another case in Zürich in 2001, a 23-year-old who had taken BZP and MDMA died from a massive cerebral edema 57 hours after hospital admission.

=== Addictive effects ===
BZP has not been found to be physically addictive in humans. Most users of BZP say they could stop, but do not want to. Studies undertaken on animals have indicated that BZP can substitute for methamphetamine in addicted rats, although it is one-tenth as potent and produces correspondingly weaker addictive effects.

== Legal status ==

BZP is banned in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malta, Poland, Sweden and the United States. BZP is not controlled under any UN convention, so the compounds themselves are legal throughout most of the world, although in most countries their use is restricted to pharmaceutical manufacturing and recreational use is unknown.

=== Australia ===
BZP is banned in all Australian states. Victoria, the last state in which it was legal, changed its classification on 1 September 2006, when BZP and piperazine analogs become illegal in the federal schedules, which are enacted by all Australian states and territories.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, Benzylpiperazine and salts of benzylpiperazine are classified as Schedule III controlled substances under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

=== European Union ===
Benzylpiperazine was the subject of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) risk assessment to determine to determine how to control it throughout the European Union. The risk assessment came about as the result of a joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The report was published in June 2007, and concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission asked the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year.

=== Finland ===
Scheduled in &quot;government decree on narcotic substances, preparations and plants&quot; and is hence illegal.

=== New Zealand ===
Based on the recommendation of the EACD, the New Zealand government passed legislation which placed BZP, along with other piperazine derivatives (TFMPP, mCPP, pFPP, MeOPP, and MBZP), into Class C of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on 18 December 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs was in effect until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.

=== United Kingdom ===
Piperazine and salts of piperazine are classified as Prescription Only Medicines in the UK. Any products containing salts of piperazine would be licensable under the Medicines Act and consequently anyone manufacturing and supplying it legally must hold the relevant licenses to do so. BZP is not a salt of piperazine, but mislabelling of BZP products as containing &quot;piperazine blend&quot; resulted in some prosecutions of suppliers in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, although none were successful. In May 2009, the Home Office announced plans to ban BZP, and launched a consultation on the proposal. In October 2009, it was announced that from 23 December 2009, BZP and related piperazines would be Class C drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

=== United States ===
The drug was federally classified as a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States in 2002, following a report by the DEA which incorrectly stated that BZP was 10 to 20 times &quot;more&quot; potent than amphetamine, when in fact BZP is ten times &quot;less&quot; potent than dexamphetamine. It is also illegal at the state level in Florida, Oklahoma, Vermont, and Virginia.

<text>Vincent Lindon (; born 15 July 1959) is a French actor and filmmaker. For his role in the film &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; (2015), Lindon won Best Actor at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, Best Actor at the 41st César Awards and the IFFI Best Actor Award (Male) at the 46th International Film Festival of India.

Lindon was selected as the president of the jury for the main competition section of the 2022 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2024, Lindon was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice International Film Festival for his lead role in &quot;The Quiet Son&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Vincent Lindon is the son of Laurent Lindon, who was director of the company Audioline. He is the grandson of Raymond Lindon, who served as the magistrate and mayor of Étretat between 1929 and 1959, as well as the nephew of Jérôme Lindon, director of Les Éditions de Minuit. He is also the great-grandson of Fernande Citroën, the older sister of André Citroën and wife of Alfred Lindon (born Abner Lindenbaum), a Jewish jeweler and modern art collector originally from Kraków, Poland. Through his mother, Alix Dufaure, a journalist for &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, Lindon is a descendant of French Prime minister Jules Dufaure and Marshal Rémy Joseph Isidore Exelmans.

Lindon completed studies at the Lycée Victor-Duruy, where he obtained a baccalauréat scientifique. He then enrolled in an école supérieure de commerce, but lost interest in his studies after 22 days. In 1979, his mother secured an internship for him as a costume design assistant on the set of Alain Resnais&#x27; film &quot;My American Uncle&quot; (1980), on which he worked with actor Gérard Depardieu. He then spent six months in New York working as an assistant in charge of radio promotion with his uncle, Eric Dufaure, founder of the label Cachalot Records (Ian North, Die Hausfrauen, Medium Medium, Malaria, Stars of the Streets, Comateens, Made in France, Personal Effects). When he returned to Paris, his father-in-law Pierre Bénichou secured a position for him managing the microphones for the tour of comedian Coluche in 1981. He was also a courier for the newspaper &quot;Le Matin de Paris&quot; before entering the Cours Florent drama school.

==Career==
Since 1980, Vincent Lindon has worked with renowned film directors Claude Sautet, Claude Lelouch, Coline Serreau, Bertrand Blier, Claire Denis, Emmanuel Carrère, Nicole Garcia, Stéphane Brizé, Jacques Doillon, Xavier Giannoli, Julia Ducournau, Alain Cavalier, Mathieu Kassovitz, Benoît Jacquot, Jean-Jacques Beineix, Diane Kurys, Claude Pinoteau, Pierre Jolivet. 

In 2005, he won the Swann d&#x27;Or for best actor at the Cabourg Film Festival for La Moustache by Emmanuel Carrère.

In 2013, he chaired the jury of the 39th Deauville American Film Festival.

In 2015, he earned the Best Actor Award at the 68th Cannes Film Festival and then the César Award for Best Actor at the 41st ceremony for the film The Measure of a Man directed by Stéphane Brizé. 

In May 2022, he was appointed as president of the jury for the 75th edition of the Cannes Film Festival, succeeding Spike Lee. 

In 2024, he starred in the film Le Deuxième Acte directed by Quentin Dupieux, which was the opening film for the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival 

Lindon was also awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 2024 Venice Film Festival for his lead role in The Quiet Son.

==Personal life==
In the 1980s, Lindon was in a relationship with Claude Chirac, daughter of President Jacques Chirac, for nearly ten years. Lindon later had a highly-publicised relationship with Caroline, Princess of Monaco. Lindon has a son, Marcel, born in 1996. He married actress Sandrine Kiberlain in 1998, with whom he has a daughter, Suzanne, born in 2000. The couple met in 1993 on the set of the film &quot;L&#x27;Irrésolu&quot; (1994). They separated in 2003.

<doc id="1257871" wikidata="Q6055638" url="?curid=1257871" title="IRC script">
<text>IRC scripts are a way of shortening commands and responding automatically to certain events while connected to an IRC network. There are many different scripting languages for different types of IRC clients: ircII, BitchX, HexChat, mIRC, Visual IRC, Bersirc, and others have their own scripting languages, many of which share common features and syntax and therefore are easily portable from one IRC client to another.

== Basis ==
=== Aliases ===
Most IRC scripts contain one or more aliases. Aliases are used to bind some command to a set of commands, or give it parameters, to save time when typing such commands over and over. For example, a simple alias might allow the user to type &quot;&quot;/j channel&quot; instead of &quot;/join #channel&quot;&quot;, saving exactly 5 keystrokes (counting Shift). Aliases can add new commands, replace commands built into the IRC client, or provide abbreviations for long commands or sequences of commands. Aliases can usually be used as functions to produce a value that is used elsewhere in the script. In some cases, an alias hypo can be associated with a keyboard shortcut.

=== Event-based scripting ===
Events, also known as remotes, allow a script to respond automatically when a particular type of message is received from the IRC server, or when a certain action is performed by the user, such as pressing a key or closing a window. Advanced event scripting usually requires knowledge of the IRC protocol, though basic events can usually be written without it.

=== Popups in scripts ===
Scripts for graphical IRC clients may contain pop-ups, which extend or replace the menus built into the client. Many scripts contain nothing but long lists of pop-ups that send humorous or cute canned messages to the channel; many of those messages take the form of a &quot;slap&quot;, ridiculing a victim chosen by the user.

== Security concerns ==
Since IRC scripts are used to interface with a public network, they are a favourable target for attack. Event handling code must be careful when dealing with input received from other IRC users; a poorly written IRC script may leave the user vulnerable, allowing attackers to possibly read the user&#x27;s passwords or private conversations, execute arbitrary commands in the user&#x27;s IRC client, or access files on the user&#x27;s hard disk.

IRC Scripts downloaded from public web sites or received from other IRC users may contain backdoors or similar malicious commands. Some users prefer to write their own IRC scripts to avoid the potential problems caused by a malicious or buggy script.

== Similarities to other programming/scripting languages ==
IRC Scripts have many of the same concepts of other scripting or programming languages, such as variables, event-based execution, modification of core components and functions. IRC Scripts look similar to modular software configuration files, such as those used for some IRC daemons such as UnrealIRCd.

<text>John Wesley North (January 4, 1815 – February 22, 1890) was an American abolitionist, lawyer, and politician. A founder of the Republican Party of Minnesota, North also served in Minnesota&#x27;s constitutional convention. As a legislator in the Minnesota Territorial Legislature, North was influential in founding the University of Minnesota. He was appointed as Nevada&#x27;s first surveyor general and as an associate justice on Nevada&#x27;s territorial Supreme Court.

He was the founder of the cities of Northfield, Minnesota and Riverside, California.

==Early life and career==
North was born near Sand Lake, New York on January 4, 1815. North&#x27;s family was associated with the Methodist Church, as the Second Great Awakening swept New England and New York State in the early 19th-century. North&#x27;s father travelled as a preacher.

Through a professional connection with the Reverend Arnold Scholefield, North met Gerrit Smith. Smith, a wealthy leader of the abolitionist movement, was an important influence in North&#x27;s embrace of anti-slavery.

In 1838, North enrolled at Wesleyan University. After achieving local recognition in an impromptu debate with the pro-slavery minister Francis Hodgson, North was invited by the Connecticut Anti-Slavery Society to work as a lecturer. As he gained attention, North&#x27;s lay license to practice ministry on behalf of the Methodist Episcopal Church was challenged by Augustus William Smith. Though North survived the challenge, he resigned his license.

North founded Wesleyan&#x27;s Anti-Slavery Society and, after graduation, continued to lecture for two years across Connecticut.

North also practiced law, forming connections with the anti-slavery lawyers and educators Joshua Leavitt, Beriah Green, and William Burleigh, among others. North&#x27;s relationship with John Greenleaf Whittier from this era would remain a profound influence on his later life.

== Marriage and family ==
North&#x27;s first wife was Emma Bacon, whom he married in 1845. She died of tuberculosis in 1847.

In 1848, North married Ann Hendrix Loomis.

==Career in Minnesota==
North struggled as a lawyer. Seeking new financial opportunities, John and Ann North travelled to Minnesota Territory in 1849, settling in St. Anthony, near the growing cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. North settled in St. Anthony at the request of Franklin Steele, agreeing to serve as his legal counsel.

The political leadership of the Territory, men like Henry Hastings Sibley and Henry Mower Rice, were associated with the national Democratic Party, a consequence of the connection between the fur trade and the regional Democrats. Territorial governor Alexander Ramsey, appointed by Whig President Zachary Taylor, led local political opposition to the influence of the Democrats and the fur trade.

Through a letter-writing campaign that targeted abolitionist reform newspapers and made use of the Norths&#x27; political connections, the Norths encouraged several thousand Eastern settlers to move to St. Anthony. John and Ann North&#x27;s aggressive and selective promotion doubled the population of St. Anthony, pushing the political character of the community towards temperance and abolitionism and reducing the power of the Democratic Party.

=== Founding Northfield, Minnesota ===
In January 1855, North travelled south from St. Anthony to visit the Cannon River Valley. On that trip, he purchased interests in the town of Faribault and met with nearby settlers along the Cannon River, organizing a plan for the construction of a saw mill, a grist mill, and a bridge at a convenient site.

A year later, the construction projects neared completion, a townsite was platted, and John and Ann moved their family to the town. A meeting of settlers named the town Northfield.

=== Political career ===
North&#x27;s successful campaign to populate St. Anthony with anti-slavery reformers led to his election to the Minnesota Territorial Legislature in 1851.

On March 29, 1855, several hundred men met in the St. Anthony Congregational church to organize Minnesota&#x27;s Republican Party. North called the meeting to order. John and Ann North prepared the party&#x27;s resolutions, which John presented at the March party meeting. North&#x27;s resolutions included the abolition of slavery in new states, the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act, and the prohibition of alcohol, among other resolutions. In 1860, North was a delegate to the Chicago Republican Convention which nominated Abraham Lincoln for the presidency of the United States, and he was a member of the committee that went to Springfield to notify Lincoln of his nomination.

==Career in Nevada==
In 1861 President Lincoln appointed North the official surveyor of the new Territory of Nevada, and North moved to Virginia City, Nevada. The territorial surveyor was a sensitive position in a mining region such as Nevada&#x27;s Comstock Lode, where the boundaries of mining claims were the constant subject of lawsuits. Lincoln may have counted on North to keep Nevada Territory loyal to the Union, and to bring Nevada in as a Republican state, as he had Minnesota. North surveyed, invested in silver mining properties, began building an ore-treatment mill he named the Minnesota Mill, and practiced law.

In early 1863, when Justice Gordon Mott&#x27;s resignation from the Supreme Court of Nevada Territory was a certainty, Judge Horatio M. Jones recommended North for the vacancy. On August 20, 1863, Lincoln granted North a temporary appointment to Nevada&#x27;s highest court, the predecessor of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. Initially, North won praise both for his decisions and for removing the backlog of cases on his docket. He was also elected president of the 1863 constitutional convention (in Carson City) assigned to draft a proposed state constitution for Nevada. In both positions he clashed with William M. Stewart, a prominent lawyer with political ambitions and large mining companies as clients. North&#x27;s rulings supported the &quot;many-ledge&quot; interpretation of mining law on the Comstock Lode, which favored the smaller mining companies over the larger companies that were Stewart&#x27;s clients.

Stewart accused North of accepting bribes from litigants. North denied the charge, and Stewart was forced to publicly recant, but Stewart continued to attack North&#x27;s honesty, and orchestrated a campaign against North in the Nevada newspapers allied with Stewart. Other newspapers supported North.

North resigned because of ill health after less than a year on the bench, but sued Stewart for slander. North agreed to submit his suit to arbitration, and after hearing both sides, the court declared that Stewart had indeed slandered North, and that there was no evidence that North had engaged in corruption. Nevertheless, North left the Territory for California, and Stewart remained and became the U.S. Senator from the new state of Nevada.

== Career in Tennessee ==
During Reconstruction in 1866, North left Nevada for Knoxville, Tennessee. North invested in a foundry, but his goal was to organize a mixed-race colony. These intentions, as well as North&#x27;s interference in an attempted lynching, led to boycotts of his business interests, and North left Knoxville.

==Career in California==

=== Founding Riverside, California ===
In 1870, North founded the southern California town of Riverside along with associates—some from Minnesota—who joined him there.

In 1879, he and his family moved north to San Francisco and joined a law firm. That year, North was nominated, but did not win, the Republican nomination to the California Supreme Court. In 1880, he became the general agent for the Washington Irrigated Colony, near Fresno, California. He opened a law office in Fresno, built a house and started a farm in nearby small community of Oleander. His wife did not join him in this move.

=== Death ===
John North died in Fresno on February 22, 1890, and was buried in Riverside&#x27;s Evergreen Cemetery.

John W. North High School and the John W. North Water Treatment Plant are located in Riverside and named after him.

<text>Thomas Dale Jackson, (born 27 October 1948) is a Canadian actor and singer. He created and starred in an annual series of Christmas concerts called the Huron Carole for 18 years. He was the Chancellor of Trent University from 2009 until 2013. He played Billy Twofeathers on &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; and Peter Kenidi on &quot;North of 60&quot;.

==Life and career==
Tom Jackson was born on the One Arrow Reserve, Saskatchewan, near Batoche, the son of Rose, a Cree, and Marshall, an Englishman. He moved with his family to Namao, Alberta at age seven, and then to Winnipeg, Manitoba when he was fourteen. A year later, he dropped out of high school and lived on the streets for several years.

As an actor, he has appeared in television shows such as &quot;North of 60&quot; and &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; where his character Billy Twofeathers debuted in its Halloween episode &quot;Scare Dares&quot;. Jackson also made a guest appearance on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in the season seven episode &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;. His films include &quot;Loyalties&quot; and &quot;The Diviners&quot;.

He also starred in &quot;Grizzly Falls&quot; in 1999 and appeared in the 2007 horror thriller &quot;Skinwalkers&quot;. In 2014, he appeared in &quot;The Dependables&quot;, as Sergeant Robinson. In 2019, he played White Bull, a Ute drug lord, alongside Liam Neeson in the film &quot;Cold Pursuit&quot;. He appeared the 2023 series &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Crossing&quot;.

He has also released several albums of country and folk music.

==Personal life==
Jackson now resides in Port Hope, Ontario with his family.

==Philanthropy==
A well-known philanthropist, Jackson created an annual series of Christmas concerts called the Huron Carole. Featuring Jackson and numerous other Canadian singers and performers, the Huron Carole troupe travels across the country each year, raising money for the Canadian Association of Food Banks. An album of Christmas songs recorded to tie-in with the tour is an annual best seller in Canada. After 17 years, Jackson retired the Huron Carole and in its place launched &quot;Singing for Supper&quot;, a cross-Canada tour that plays smaller community venues raising money and gifts of food, during the 2005 Christmas season.

After &quot;North of 60&quot; cast member Mervin Good Eagle died by suicide in October 1996, Tom started the Dreamcatcher Tour.

In the spring of 1997 Jackson&#x27;s home town was bracing for &quot;the flood of the century&quot; that had already put towns south of the US/Canada border under water. Jackson was instrumental in organizing flood relief concerts across the nation (Calgary, Winnipeg).

==Honours and decorations==
Jackson has been honoured several times for his life&#x27;s work. Most notably, in 2000, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and is a former member of the Order of Canada Advisory Council. He has been nominated for Juno Awards and Gemini Awards. He has also received honours from several Canadian universities, including honorary degrees from the University of Calgary, Trent University, the University of Lethbridge and Carleton University. He also received the Humanitarian Award at the 2007 Juno Awards due to his charitable efforts.
In May 2014, Jackson received a Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award (GGPAA) for his lifetime contributions to Canadian broadcasting. At the Gala honouring GGPAA recipients on 10 May, Jackson took to the National Arts Centre stage to perform one of his songs.

On 14 April 2009, Jackson was announced as the tenth chancellor for Trent University. Jackson held this position until 2013.

<text>Hammerstein is a municipality on the river Rhine in the district of Neuwied in Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany.
Near the village, is the Hammerstein castle. The ancient German noble family Hammerstein (surname), which have sponsored the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York, comes from here.

== History ==

The north-eastern part of the Hammerstein district was crossed by the Upper Germanic Limes during the Roman Empire. Part of this border wall was the small fort &quot;Am Forsthofweg&quot;, which is located on today&#x27;s municipal territory. 

Centuries later, the villages of Niederhammerstein and Oberhammerstein developed under the protection of the hilltop castle of Hammerstein, which was first mentioned in a document in 1002. The origins of the castle date back to the 10th century. The earliest documentary mention of Niederhammerstein dates back to 1225. The village of Oberhammerstein, located at the foot of the castle, was granted town rights in 1337. In 1357, Emperor Karl IV confirmed to the lords of the castle an even older right to strike coins and hold fairs. The castle remained in use until the middle of the 17th century and was only razed in 1654 by troops from the Electorate of Trier. From 1419 to 1788, Hammerstein was the seat of the Electorate of Trier, and between 1803 and 1815 of the Ducal-Nassau Office of Hammerstein, a lower administrative and judicial district. Niederhammerstein and Oberhammerstein were independent municipalities until 1936.

== Sights ==

Hammerstein is home to numerous historical monuments whose origins date back to the High Middle Ages and Roman times and which bear witness to the town&#x27;s long history.

* The location of the former small fort and current ground monument as well as other traces and reconstructions of the rampart, ditch and palisade of the Upper Germanic Limes are accessible in the Hammerstein area via the Limes hiking trail leading from Rheinbrohl to Niederbieber.
Another important and interesting long-distance hiking trail, the Rheinsteig, passes through the Hammerstein district.

* Hammerstein Castle, built in the 10th century, is probably the oldest castle in the Middle Rhine Valley. It was first mentioned as an imperial castle in 1002. Between the last quarter of the 11th century and the beginning of the 14th century, it had a certain importance as a customs castle. In the 12th century, the imperial insignia were repeatedly kept there. Its ruins are located on a rock rising from the Rhine in the south of the municipality. It can be visited and is one of the town&#x27;s main attractions.

* The Romanesque origins of the parish church of St George in Oberhammerstein date back to the 11th or 12th century. The two bells, with diameters of 96 and 61 cm respectively, were cast around 1050. They are the oldest church bells on the Middle Rhine and the only Romanesque double bells in Germany.

* The so-called Burgmannshof, also known as Claurenburg, a 16th century tithe farm, is located on the same site where a royal court was documented as early as 1176. It was first mentioned in a document as Burgmannshof in 1556. In the 1920s and early 1930s, the building housed a youth hostel. The Burgmannshof has been privately owned since 1937.

* The old Jewish cemetery, which was used from the 17th to the early 20th century, is located on the forest path from the Hammerstein castle ruins to Leutesdorf. The burials were carried out by a small Jewish community based in Leutesdorf. A total of 21 gravestones have been preserved.

* The Catholic branch church of St Katharina in Niederhammerstein also dates back to the 17th century. However, it goes back to an older sacred building mentioned in a document in 1424. Its sacristy dates back to 1742 and the building was extended in 1872.

* The Krewl vineyard in Niederhammerstein dates back to a 17th or 18th century nunnery in the Electorate of Cologne.

* The Hammersteiner Werth is the Rhine island off Hammerstein. It serves as a fishing area and is popular with locals as a bathing beach in summer.

<text>Luis Gabriel Rey Villamizar (February 20, 1980) is a Colombian former professional footballer who last played for Liga MX club Monarcas Morelia on loan from Club América.

A classical left-footed striker, Rey arrived to Mexico in 2001 and has scored over 150 goals in Liga MX. He holds Mexican citizenship. Nicknamed in Mexico as &quot;El Canguro&quot; (Spanish for kangaroo) due to his goal celebrations, he was part of the Colombia national team and played the Copa América 2007.

==Career==

===Early career===
Rey debuted in 2000 with Atlético Bucaramanga, where he remained for one year, moved to Mexico and was transferred to Segundo Division clubs such as Lobos BUAP, Zitacuaro, and Acapulco; eventually he switched to Atlante FC.

===Atlante===
While at the club, he reaped great success as goalscorer, winning the league&#x27;s Gold Boot, achieved in the 2003 Apertura, becoming the first Colombian to win that distinction in Mexico soccer. In his first stint with Atlante, Rey scored 43 goals in 76 appearances.

===Morelia===
In 2005, Rey signed with Monarcas Morelia where he managed to score 26 goals in 88 appearances from 2005 to 2007.

===Return to Morelia===
During the 2009 Draft it was announced that Rey would return to Monarcas Morelia. While in preseason with the club in Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, Rey picked up an injury that would prevent him from playing the first match of the season. He would not reappeared until matchday six, against Atlas and score his first goal against UANL. In November 2009 Rey would score what he considers &quot;the best goal of his career&quot; against Club Deportivo Guadalajara at the Estadio Morelos. After a cross from teammate Jaime Duran, Rey attempted a successful bicycle-kick which beat goalkeeper Luis Ernesto Michel.

===Jaguares de Chiapas===
For the Apertura 2011, Rey was transferred to Jaguares de Chiapas, club in which he scored his 100th goal in the Mexican top-flight in the first match of the tournament against Monterrey. Appearing in over 70 matches and scoring 33 goals, Rey is one of the top goal-scorers in the club&#x27;s history.

===América===
On June 5, 2013, Rey was signed by recently crowned league champions América. He scored his first goal for América on September 2 in the 4–1 win over UNAM. On 2015, Rey moved to Puebla FC.

===Puebla===
Puebla signed Rey in a season-long loan deal from Club América. Rey played a total of 38 games between Liga MX and the Copa MX, having scored a total of 11 goals in both competitions. At the end of the Apertura 2015 he returned with Club América.

<doc id="1257892" wikidata="Q1863895" url="?curid=1257892" title="Sonic Rush">
<text>is a 2005 platform game developed by Sonic Team and Dimps for the Nintendo DS as part of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. It was released on November 15, 2005, in North America, November 18 in the PAL region, and November 23 in Japan, and was the final game in the mainline Sonic series to be produced by Yuji Naka before his departure from Sega. It was the first Sonic game with the English 4Kids cast, instead of the cast first seen in Sonic Adventure. It is a 2D platform game, similar to earlier games in the series like &quot;Sonic Advance&quot;, as well as later ones like &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;. Levels in the game are side-scrolling and displayed using both of the DS&#x27;s screens. However, boss battles, the main characters, and a special stage are rendered in 3D, creating a 2.5D effect. The game&#x27;s storyline follows the intertwining adventures of the series&#x27; main character, Sonic the Hedgehog and a new character, Blaze the Cat. They respectively battle Doctor Eggman and his doppelgänger Eggman Nega at certain points.

The game was announced under the working title &quot;Sonic DS&quot; at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004, and under &quot;Sonic Rush&quot; at E3 2005. The game&#x27;s 2.5D format was based on Sonic Team&#x27;s idea to combine elements from 2D and 3D games in the series. Upon release, &quot;Sonic Rush&quot; was well received by critics, with praise stemming from the game&#x27;s visuals, music, and similarity to older games in the series and criticism stemming from its overall quickness. A sequel, &quot;Sonic Rush Adventure&quot;, was released in 2007.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Sonic Rush&quot; is a 2D platform game, similar to earlier games in the series like &quot;Sonic Advance&quot; as well as later ones like &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;. The player controls either Sonic the Hedgehog or Blaze the Cat, who differ in terms of special abilities. In the tradition of past &quot;Sonic&quot; games, gameplay consists of moving quickly through levels, collecting rings and defeating enemies. The player collects rings as a form of health; when they are hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, their rings bounce in all directions and can be recollected. The player begins the game with three lives, one of which is lost when the character is hit without any rings in their possession, crushed, drowns, falls into a bottomless pit, or reaches the act&#x27;s 10-minute limit; losing all lives results in a game over. Both of the DS&#x27;s screens are used to display the play area, with the player&#x27;s character moving between them as necessary. Levels in the game are divided into &quot;zones&quot;, each consisting of two acts of normal gameplay then a 3D boss battle. The course of the game differs depending on whether Sonic or Blaze is chosen; the seven zones are the same, but are accessed in different orders. During boss battles, Blaze fights Doctor Eggman and Sonic fights an Eggman doppelgänger called Eggman Nega. As the characters&#x27; stories progress, they meet each other several times and unite in the final zone that comes after the seventh. The game features special stages the player can access via certain handles in order to obtain the Chaos Emeralds. These Special Stages resemble those of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; and use the DS&#x27;s stylus controls.

New features include a grading system that grades the player based on the time it takes for them to complete the level; they can return to levels later to try for a higher grade. There is a point system based on the one in &quot;Sonic Advance 2&quot; but displaying points in multiple categories. Sonic Rush introduces a &quot;Tension Gauge&quot; on the left side of the screen which is filled by doing tricks and defeating enemies. The energy it generates allows the player to use boosts of speed while moving; defeating enemies, moving through the level more quickly, which results in more points and a higher grade, and when playing as Sonic, accessing the special stage. Although the game is primarily two-dimensional, there are three-dimensional elements which create a 2.5D effect.

The game has a two-player mode in which Sonic and Blaze race to the end of a chosen level from the game. There is also a feature in which players who own the game can send a demo of the game to other Nintendo DS users.

==Plot==

Blaze the Cat is somehow pulled from her native dimension into Sonic&#x27;s world. Her world had seven Sol Emeralds—similar to the Chaos Emeralds—but they were stolen by Doctor Eggman. She then makes it her goal to retrieve them. While searching, she meets Cream the Rabbit and is surprised by her politeness. Meanwhile, Sonic is searching for the Chaos Emeralds, which have been stolen by Doctor Eggman Nega, Eggman&#x27;s alternate counterpart from Blaze&#x27;s dimension.

Sonic briefly encounters Blaze during his search, but she departs before he can question her. His friend Tails learns that the two dimensions are merging somehow, and both will collapse if the process is not stopped. Suspicious of Blaze, Sonic and Tails begin searching for her. Upon finding Blaze and Cream, Sonic questions Blaze about her nature, but she refuses to give any information and leaves with Cream. Sonic follows her to Eggman Nega&#x27;s base, where it is revealed that Eggman and Eggman Nega are working together to collect both the Chaos Emeralds and the Sol Emeralds. Blaze declares that she is the only one who can save their worlds, without anyone&#x27;s help. Sonic and Blaze fight each other, until Sonic wins the fight and Blaze realizes the error of her ways.

After Eggman kidnaps Cream, Blaze goes after him while Sonic takes on Nega. Sonic collects the last of the seven Chaos Emeralds and catches up with Blaze, who fails to prevent Eggman and Eggman Nega from draining the Sol Emeralds&#x27;s power for their Egg Salamander mech. As the world begins to destabilize, Sonic and his friends help Blaze realize the meaning of friendship. This restores the Sol Emeralds, and Sonic and Blaze use both sets of Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic and Burning Blaze. The two destroy the Egg Salamander, restoring the dimensions to normal, and Blaze returns to her world, now better understanding her powers. Cream is saddened by Blaze&#x27;s departure, but Sonic assures her that Blaze promised to return someday.

==Development==

&quot;Sonic Rush&quot; was developed by Sonic Team and Dimps, and published by Sega. Yuji Naka, Sega&#x27;s executive managing director, announced the game at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004, along with &quot;Project Rub&quot;. A demo of the newly titled &quot;Sonic Rush&quot; was featured at E3 2005, and won video game publication &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Biggest Surprise&quot; award. Blaze the Cat, a new character, was revealed at Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2005. The game&#x27;s 2.5D format was based on Sonic Team&#x27;s idea to combine elements from 2D and 3D games in the series. Director Akinori Nishiyama stated in a September 2005 interview with &quot;GameSpot&quot; that Sonic Team &quot;wanted to keep the elements from 2D, yet still explore some of the new elements from 3D.&quot; At TGS 2005, he stated that while working on &quot;Sonic Advance 3&quot;, he realized that the series was becoming more complicated, opting for a &quot;fast, dynamic action&quot; approach to the next title in the series.

The music was primarily composed by Hideki Naganuma of &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; fame. Additional music was composed by the game&#x27;s sound director Teruhiko Nakagawa, along with Masayoshi Ishi and Hiroyuki Hamada of T&#x27;s Music. Composing the music was a challenge for Naganuma, who had to work under the limitations of the Nintendo DS&#x27; sound chip. The final boss music in the soundtrack, &quot;Wrapped in Black,&quot; used audible excerpts from Malcom X&#x27;s &quot;Message to the Grass Roots&quot; speech.

&quot;Sonic Rush&quot; introduced Blaze, who has become a recurring character in the series. Blaze appeared for the second time in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; in 2006, and then in &quot;Sonic Rush Adventure&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Sonic Rush&quot;, and numerous other games.

==Reception==

&quot;Sonic Rush&quot; was released on November 15, 2005, in North America; November 18 in Europe; and November 23 in Japan. It was the ninth best-selling DS game of December 2006. It sold 360,000 copies in Europe from March 2006 to March 2007. The game received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

The game was released to &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the game for its usage of elements from older &quot;Sonic&quot; games. &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;, and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; compared the game to older games in the series, specifically those on the Sega Genesis. &quot;GameSpy&quot; staff writer Greg Sewart offered a similar opinion, also praising the game for its &quot;gorgeous graphics&quot;. The visuals were well received, with some calling it &quot;gorgeous&quot; and &quot;colourful&quot;. The game&#x27;s overall quickness was not as well received. &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Greg Sewart, although giving a mostly positive review, complained that &quot;it&#x27;s so fast you almost can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s going on most of the time.&quot; &quot;1UP.com&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot; thought similarly. The game&#x27;s music was well-received, called &quot;bright [and] buoyant&quot; by &quot;1UP.com&quot; and compared to that of &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; by &quot;GameSpot&quot;. &quot;GameSpy&quot; called the music &quot;all very fitting and very catchy&quot;, noting its use of sampling and unconventional structure.

In 2008, &quot;Sonic Rush&quot; was listed at #17 in &quot;IGN&quot;″s list of the top 25 DS games. In 2009, it was listed as one of the &quot;cheers&quot; on &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Cheers &amp; Tears&quot; list of action games for the DS.

<doc id="1257905" wikidata="Q3964194" url="?curid=1257905" title="Solar Winds">
<text>Solar Winds: The Escape and its sequel Solar Winds: Galaxy (also known as Solar Winds II: Universe) are top-down, space-themed role-playing action games developed by James Schmalz and published by Epic MegaGames in 1993.

The main character of both games, bounty hunter Jake Stone, takes on a series of missions that has him shipping cargo and fending off attackers. The story is told through simple conversations and brief cutscenes. In some ways, the series is reminiscent of &quot;Star Control II&quot;, without the ship customization and fleet building aspects.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay is presented in a top-down view. The focus is always on Stone&#x27;s ship. The keyboard or a joystick is used to navigate the ship and fire weapons (which consist of lasers and missiles). Mice are also supported. Many functions, such as scans, communication, and power distribution, are controlled by the control panel. The player can zoom out to see details, the amount of which depends on how much power is allocated to sensors.

Power is allocated to various ship&#x27;s systems, such as shields, weapons, life support, engines, and is consumed by the hyperdrive, whose maximum speed is determined by engine power allocation. Hull integrity is shown through a square superimposed on top of the ship. Over time, the ship will repair itself, the speed of which depending on how much power has been dedicated to the life support systems. The waveforms of shields and weapons can be adjusted. The specific waveform selected for a laser blast or shield configuration dictates their effectiveness against each other. Lasers can be set to fire for either one, two, or three laser cannons firing simultaneously.

Communication is implemented in the form of the other party talking and the player selecting a response.

Items in the player&#x27;s cargo hold can be transported to planets and other ships. In the first episode, many missions involve delivering cargo in return for useful items.

== Development ==
&quot;Solar Winds&quot; was the first major title designed by James Schmalz. As a young developer, his simple motivation was to develop a game that is fun to make. He created &quot;Solar Winds&quot; based on inspiration from the game &quot;Star Control II&quot;, as well as his love of the science fiction series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Released by shareware publisher Epic MegaGames, &quot;Solar Winds&quot; became successful enough that Schmalz could afford to develop his next games for Epic: &quot;Epic Pinball&quot;, &quot;Extreme Pinball&quot;, and eventually, &quot;Unreal&quot;.

==Plot==
In &quot;The Escape&quot;, humans live in a planetary system millions of light years from Earth. Space travel is common, but hyperdrive research is restricted: any research pertaining to hyperdrive travel is destroyed by the oppressive solar government. However, one group has spent a decade in secret developing a hyperdrive ship and plans to use it to escape the force field encasing their planetary system. The government hires Stone to stop them.

It is eventually revealed that the solar government is conspiring with a race of superior aliens to stop the development of hyperdrive technology. These aliens keep species for study, and push these species toward war. Travel to other planetary systems is barred by invisible force fields around the systems. The aliens and their agents travel by means of fixed, self-made portals, opened with special keys. Ultimately, Stone is able to travel through one of the portals where he is greeted by an alien agitator, who seeks his assistance to bring to an end the cruel treatment of these species.

In &quot;Universe&quot;, Jake Stone continues his work with these agitators to disrupt the portals. Meanwhile, a human colony fleet from Earth is heading for the force field surrounding the Solar System (Earth&#x27;s planetary system). Ultimately Stone is able to work for the enemy to get close enough to destroy the Controller that maintains the force fields and portals, thus freeing these worlds.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Chuck Miller in 1993 approved of &quot;Solar Winds&quot;″s combination of action, strategy, and role-playing, and said that the game &quot;is an exceptional product and worth the $30 registration fee&quot;. In 2013, Richard Cobbett of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; complained about the lack of content and also said it takes too long to get between destinations.

==Soundtrack==
The music for the game was composed by Dan Froelich using FM Synthesis.

<doc id="1257907" wikidata="Q418594" url="?curid=1257907" title="Valaciclovir">
<text>Valaciclovir, also spelled valacyclovir, is an antiviral medication used to treat outbreaks of herpes simplex or herpes zoster (shingles). It is also used to prevent cytomegalovirus following a kidney transplant in high risk cases. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include headache and vomiting. Severe side effects may include kidney problems. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. It is a prodrug, which works after being converted to aciclovir in a person&#x27;s body.
Valaciclovir was patented in 1987 and came into medical use in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 113th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Valaciclovir is used for the treatment of HSV and VZV infections, including:
* Oral and genital herpes simplex (treatment and prevention)
* Reduction of HSV transmission from people with recurrent infection to uninfected individuals
* Herpes zoster (shingles): the typical dosage for treatment of herpes is 1,000 mg orally three times a day for seven consecutive days.
* Prevention of cytomegalovirus following organ transplantation
* Prevention of herpesviruses in immunocompromised people (such as those undergoing cancer chemotherapy)
* Chickenpox in children (ages 2–18)

It has shown promise as a treatment for infectious mononucleosis and is preventively administered in suspected cases of herpes B virus exposure.

Bell&#x27;s palsy does not seem to benefit from using valaciclovir as its only treatment.

==Adverse effects==
Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of people) associated with valaciclovir are the same as for aciclovir, its active metabolite. They include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and headache. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include: agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, edema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, rash, weakness and/or renal impairment. Rare adverse effects (&lt;0.1% of patients) include: coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, tremor, ataxia, encephalopathy, psychotic symptoms, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and/or anaphylaxis.

== Pharmacology ==
Valaciclovir is a prodrug, an esterified version of aciclovir that has greater oral bioavailability (about 55%) than aciclovir. It is converted by esterases to the active drug, aciclovir, and the amino acid valine via hepatic first-pass metabolism. Aciclovir is selectively converted into a monophosphate form by viral thymidine kinase, which is more effective (3000 times) in phosphorylation of aciclovir than cellular thymidine kinase. Subsequently, the monophosphate form is further phosphorylated into a disphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and then into the active triphosphate form, aciclo-GTP, by cellular kinases.

=== Mechanism of action ===
Aciclo-GTP, the active triphosphate metabolite of aciclovir, is a very potent inhibitor of viral DNA replication. Aciclo-GTP competitively inhibits and inactivates the viral DNA polymerase. Its monophosphate form also incorporates into the viral DNA, resulting in chain termination. It has also been shown that the viral enzymes cannot remove aciclo-GMP from the chain, which results in inhibition of further activity of DNA polymerase. Aciclo-GTP is fairly rapidly metabolized within the cell, possibly by cellular phosphatases.

Aciclovir is active against most species in the herpesvirus family. In descending order of activity:
* Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1)
* Herpes simplex virus type II (HSV-2)
* Varicella zoster virus (VZV)
* Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)
* Cytomegalovirus (CMV)

The drug is predominantly active against HSV and, to a lesser extent, VZV. It is only of limited efficacy against EBV and CMV. However, valaciclovir has been shown to lower or eliminate the presence of the Epstein–Barr virus in subjects afflicted with acute mononucleosis, leading to a significant decrease in the severity of symptoms. Valaciclovir and acyclovir act by inhibiting viral DNA replication, but as of 2016 there was little evidence that they are effective against Epstein–Barr virus. Acyclovir therapy does prevent viral latency, but has not proven effective at eradicating latent viruses in nerve ganglia.

As of 2005, resistance to valaciclovir has not been significant. Mechanisms of resistance in HSV include deficient viral thymidine kinase and mutations to viral thymidine kinase and/or DNA polymerase that alter substrate sensitivity.

It also is used for herpes B virus postexposure prophylaxis.

== Chemistry ==
Details of the synthesis of valaciclovir were first published by scientists from the Wellcome Foundation.
Aciclovir was esterified with a carboxybenzyl protected valine, using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as the dehydrating agent. In the final step, the protecting group was removed by hydrogenation using a palladium on alumina catalyst.

== History ==
Valaciclovir was patented in 1987 and came into medical use in 1995. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 113th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5million prescriptions.

==Society and culture==
=== Brand names ===
It is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline under the brand names Valtrex and Zelitrex. Valaciclovir has been available as a generic drug in the US since November 2009.

<text>JAST USA is a publisher of English-language versions of Japanese video games, specifically bishōjo games, dating sims, visual novels and Japanese RPGs. It was founded in 1996, and their first game releases were Sakura Soft&#x27;s &quot;Season of the Sakura&quot; and JAST&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&#x27; Story&quot;. It has had several brands: Peach Princess, G-Collections, JAST Densetsu, and JAST Blue.

JAST USA was so named because it was originally affiliated with JAST (the Japanese company), but with the closure of JAST in 2000, the company created the subsidiary Peach Princess (because there was no longer a JAST to be affiliated with). As Peach Princess, the company published mostly Crowd and Will titles. In 2005, JAST acquired G-Collections from CD Bros., as it left the US market. In 2006, JAST USA merged its subsidiaries as JAST USA brands. In 2011, the brand JAST Densetsu was created with the goal of separating visual novel games from the image of dating-sims. In 2015, all brands were folded back into the parent company, JAST USA, to improve overall brand recognition in a glowingly competitive market. In 2018 during Anime EXPO, its newer branch called JAST BLUE, which focuses on boys&#x27; love games, announced license acquirements of Nitro+chiral&#x27;s titles &quot;Sweet Pool&quot;, &quot;Lamento: Beyond the Void&quot;, &quot;Togainu no Chi&quot;, &quot;DRAMAtical Murder&quot;, and &quot;Slow Damage&quot;.

In addition to publishing their own games, JAST USA also acts as distributor for titles published by MangaGamer. In the past, they have also been the US distributor for games translated by the London-based company Otaku Publishing, Ltd., such as &quot;True Love&quot;.

==Games published==

This list are the titles from JAST USA, including ones from its past subsidiaries and acquisitions.

<doc id="1257927" wikidata="Q7805856" url="?curid=1257927" title="Timeline of Northfield, Minnesota">
<text>This is a timeline of historical events relating to Northfield, Minnesota.

==Nineteenth century==
1851- The U.S. government imposed a treaty on the Dakota people, Siouan-speaking Native Americans who had been in this territory since at least the 17th century. Indigenous peoples of varying cultures had lived in the area for thousands of years before that. The treaty allowed European-American settlement in southern Minnesota. Most of the Dakota were removed to a reservation near New Ulm, Minnesota. The treaty marked part of the decline of the Dakotah Nation, adversely affected by infectious disease and warfare. The people have undergone a revival since the later 20th century, however. The treaty paved the way for the foundation of Northfield.

1851- William Marshall surveyed land and helped John W. North, a migrant from Syracuse, New York, pick out land to build mills and a town, to be called Northfield.

1854- May, Daniel Kuykendall was the first European-American pioneer to arrive in the area. Others soon followed.

1855- On August 17, 1855, North purchased 160 acres (647,000 m²) of land from each of the other two original pre-emptors.

1856- September, Miron W. Skinner and his brother moved to Northfield and opened the second town store. He was instrumental in the establishment of Northfield College, now known as Carleton College. (See 1916 note about building of Skinner Chapel on the campus.)

1856- Herman Jenkins built the first hotel in Northfield.

1857 John L. Schofield came to Northfield and was the town’s first doctor. He built the first drugstore, which was attached to his house. John North suffered financial failure in the Panic of 1857.

1859- Charles Augustus Wheaton bought John North&#x27;s financial interests and became one of the early town leaders. 
1865- Jesse Ames moved to town and bought mills from Charles Augustus Wheaton. 
1866- The Minnesota Conference of Congregational Churches and Charles M. Goodsell established Northfield College, later named Carleton College. 
1867- Wheaton and Goodsell each gave a plot of land to the fledgling Northfield College to establish the college campus north of the main part of town.

1871- Northfield College changes its name to Carleton College, after benefactor William Carleton of Charlestown, Massachusetts, who had given US$50,000 to the fledgling institution.

<text>Agrippina (HWV 6) is an &quot;opera seria&quot; in three acts by George Frideric Handel with a libretto by Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani. Composed for the Venice &quot;Carnevale&quot; season, the opera tells the story of Agrippina, the mother of Nero, as she plots the downfall of the Roman Emperor Claudius and the installation of her son as emperor. Grimani&#x27;s libretto, considered one of the best that Handel set, is an &quot;anti-heroic satirical comedy&quot;, full of topical political allusions. Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani&#x27;s political and diplomatic rivalry with Pope Clement XI.

Handel composed &quot;Agrippina&quot; at the end of a three-year sojourn in Italy. It premiered in Venice at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo on 26 December 1709. It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed. Observers praised the quality of the music—much of which, in keeping with the contemporary custom, had been borrowed and adapted from other works, including the works of other composers. Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work, Handel did not promote further stagings. There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel&#x27;s operas, including &quot;Agrippina&quot;, fell out of fashion in the mid-18th century.

In the 20th century &quot;Agrippina&quot; was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of the work have become ever more common, with innovative stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007, and the Metropolitan Opera in 2020. Modern critical opinion is that &quot;Agrippina&quot; is Handel&#x27;s first operatic masterpiece, full of freshness and musical invention which have made it one of the most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival.

==Background==

Handel&#x27;s earliest opera compositions, in the German style, date from his Hamburg years, 1704–06, under the influence of Johann Mattheson. In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years, developing his compositional skills. He first settled in Florence where he was introduced to Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. His first opera composed in Italy, though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was &quot;Rodrigo&quot; (1707, original title &quot;Vincer se stesso ê la maggior vittoria&quot;), and was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel&#x27;s process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.

Handel then spent time in Rome, where the performance of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of &quot;secco&quot; recitative and &quot;aria da capo&quot;. Works from this period include &quot;Dixit Dominus&quot; and the dramatic cantata &quot;Aci, Galatea e Polifemo&quot;, written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel and asked him to set his new libretto, &quot;Agrippina&quot;. Grimani intended to present this opera at his family-owned theatre in Venice, the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as part of the 1709–10 &quot;Carnevale&quot; season.

==Writing history==
===Libretto===
Grimani&#x27;s libretto is based on much the same story used as the subject of Monteverdi&#x27;s 1642 opera &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;. Grimani&#x27;s libretto centres on Agrippina, a character who does not appear in Monteverdi&#x27;s darker version. Grimani avoids the &quot;moralizing&quot; tone of the later &quot;opera seria&quot; libretti written by such acknowledged masters as Metastasio and Zeno. According to the critic Donald Jay Grout, &quot;irony, deception and intrigue pervade the humorous escapades of its well-defined characters&quot;. All the main characters, with the sole exception of Claudius&#x27;s servant Lesbus, are historical, and the broad outline of the libretto draws heavily upon Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Annals&quot; and Suetonius&#x27; &quot;Life of Claudius&quot;. It has been suggested that the comical, amatory character of the Emperor Claudius is a caricature of Pope Clement XI, to whom Grimani was politically opposed. Certain aspects of this conflict are also reflected in the plot: the rivalry between Nero and Otho mirror aspects of the debate over the War of the Spanish Succession, in which Grimani supported the Habsburgs and Pope Clement XI France and Spain.

===Composition===
According to John Mainwaring, Handel&#x27;s first biographer, &quot;Agrippina&quot; was composed in the three weeks following Handel&#x27;s arrival in Venice in November 1709, a theory supported by the autograph manuscript&#x27;s Venetian paper.
In composing the opera Handel borrowed extensively from his earlier oratorios and cantatas, and from other composers including Reinhard Keiser, Arcangelo Corelli and Jean-Baptiste Lully. This practice of adapting and borrowing was common at the time but is carried to greater lengths in &quot;Agrippina&quot; than in almost all of Handel&#x27;s other major dramatic works. The overture, which is a French-style two-part work with a &quot;thrilling&quot; allegro, and all but five of the vocal numbers, are based on earlier works, though subject in many cases to significant adaptation and reworking.
Examples of recycled material include Pallas&#x27;s &quot;Col raggio placido&quot;, which is based on Lucifer&#x27;s aria from &quot;La resurrezione&quot; (1708), &quot;O voi dell&#x27;Erebo&quot;, which was itself adapted from Reinhard Keiser&#x27;s 1705 opera &quot;Octavia&quot;. Agrippina&#x27;s aria &quot;Non ho cor che per amarti&quot; was taken, almost entirely unchanged, from &quot;Se la morte non vorrà&quot; in Handel&#x27;s earlier dramatic cantata &quot;Qual ti reveggio, oh Dio&quot; (1707); Narcissus&#x27;s &quot;Spererò&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;Sai perchè&quot; from another 1707 cantata, &quot;Clori, Tirsi e Fileno&quot;; and parts of Nero&#x27;s aria in act 3, &quot;Come nube che fugge dal vento&quot;, are borrowed Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Il trionfo del tempo&quot; (all from 1707). Later, some of &quot;Agrippina&#x27;s&quot; music was used by Handel in his London operas &quot;Rinaldo&quot; (1711) and the 1732 version of &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;, in each case with little or no change. The first music by Handel presented in London may have been Agrippina&#x27;s &quot;Non ho cor che&quot;, transposed into Alessandro Scarlatti&#x27;s opera &quot;Pirro è Dimitrio&quot; which was performed in London on 6 December 1710. The &quot;Agrippina&quot; overture and other arias from the opera appeared in pasticcios performed in London between 1710 and 1714, with additional music provided by other composers. Echoes of &quot;Ti vo&#x27; giusta&quot; (one of the few arias composed specifically for &quot;Agrippina&quot;) can be found in the air &quot;He was despised&quot;, from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; (1742).

Two of the main male roles, Nero and Narcissus, were written for castrati, the &quot;superstars of their day&quot; in Italian opera. The opera was revised significantly before and possibly during its run. One example is the duet for Otho and Poppaea in act 3, &quot;No, no, ch&#x27;io non apprezzo&quot;, replaced with two solo arias before the first performance. Another is Poppaea&#x27;s aria &quot;Ingannata&quot;, replaced during the run with another of extreme virtuosity, &quot;Pur punir chi m&#x27;ha ingannata&quot;, either to emphasise Poppaea&#x27;s new-found resolution at this juncture of the opera or, as is thought more likely, to flatter Scarabelli by giving her an additional opportunity to show off her vocal abilities.

The instrumentation for Handel&#x27;s score follows closely that of all his early operas: two recorders, two oboes, two trumpets, three violins, two cellos, viola, timpani, contrabassoon and harpsichord. By the standards of Handel&#x27;s later London operas this scoring is light, but there are nevertheless what Dean and Knapp describe as &quot;moments of splendour when Handel applies the full &quot;concerto grosso&quot; treatment&quot;. &quot;Agrippina&quot;, Handel&#x27;s second Italian opera, was probably his last composition in Italy.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
On hearing that her husband, the Emperor Claudius, has died in a storm at sea, Agrippina plots to secure the throne for Nero, her son by a previous marriage. Nero is unenthusiastic about this project, but consents to his mother&#x27;s wishes (&quot;Con saggio tuo consiglio&quot;). Agrippina obtains the support of her two freedmen, Pallas and Narcissus, who hail Nero as the new Emperor before the Senate.
With the Senate&#x27;s assent, Agrippina and Nero begin to ascend the throne, but the ceremony is interrupted by the entrance of Claudius&#x27;s servant Lesbus. He announces that his master is alive (&quot;Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!&quot;), saved from death by Otho, the commander of the army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that he loves the beautiful Poppaea more than he desires the throne. Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius. Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the tables on Otho by telling the Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius&#x27;s attentions. This, Agrippina believes, will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of the throne.

Poppaea believes Agrippina. When Claudius arrives at Poppaea&#x27;s house she denounces what she believes is Otho&#x27;s treachery. Claudius departs in fury, while Agrippina cynically consoles Poppaea by declaring that their friendship will never be broken by deceit (&quot;Non ho cor che per amarti&quot;).

===Act 2===
Pallas and Narcissus realize that Agrippina has tricked them into supporting Nero and decide to have no more to do with her. Otho arrives, nervous about his forthcoming coronation (&quot;Coronato il crin d&#x27;alloro&quot;), followed by Agrippina, Nero and Poppaea, who have come to greet Claudius. All combine in a triumphal chorus (&quot;Di timpani e trombe&quot;) as Claudius enters. Each in turns pays tribute to the Emperor, but Otho is coldly rebuffed as Claudius denounces him as a traitor. Otho is devastated and appeals to Agrippina, Poppaea, and Nero for support, but they all reject him, leaving him in bewilderment and despair (&quot;Otton, qual portentoso fulmine&quot; followed by &quot;Voi che udite il mio lamento&quot;).

However, Poppaea is touched by her former beloved&#x27;s grief, and wonders if he might not be guilty (&quot;Bella pur nel mio diletto&quot;). She devises a plan and when Otho approaches her, she pretends to talk in her sleep recounting what Agrippina has told her earlier. Otho, as she intended, overhears her and fiercely protests his innocence. He convinces Poppaea that Agrippina has deceived her. Poppaea swears revenge (&quot;Ingannata una sol volta&quot;, alternate aria &quot;Pur punir chi m&#x27;ha ingannata&quot;) but is distracted when Nero comes forward and declares his love for her. Meanwhile, Agrippina, having lost the support of Pallas and Narcissus, manages to convince Claudius that Otho is still plotting to take the throne. She advises Claudius that he should end Otho&#x27;s ambitions once and for all by abdicating in favour of Nero. Claudius agrees, believing that this will enable him to win Poppaea.

===Act 3===

Poppaea now plans some deceit of her own, in an effort to divert Claudius&#x27;s wrath from Otho with whom she has now reconciled. She hides Otho in her bedroom with instructions to listen carefully. Soon Nero arrives to press his love on her (&quot;Coll&#x27;ardor del tuo bel core&quot;), but she tricks him into hiding as well. Then Claudius enters; Poppaea tells him that he had earlier misunderstood her: it was not Otho but Nero who had ordered her to reject Claudius. To prove her point she asks Claudius to pretend to leave, then she summons Nero who, thinking Claudius has gone, resumes his passionate wooing of Poppaea. Claudius suddenly reappears and angrily dismisses the crestfallen Nero. After Claudius departs, Poppaea brings Otho out of hiding and the two express their everlasting love in separate arias.

At the palace, Nero tells Agrippina of his troubles and decides to renounce love for political ambition (&quot;Come nube che fugge dal vento&quot;). But Pallas and Narcissus have by now revealed Agrippina&#x27;s original plot to Claudius, so that when Agrippina urges the Emperor to yield the throne to Nero, he accuses her of treachery. She then claims that her efforts to secure the throne for Nero had all along been a ruse to safeguard the throne for Claudius (&quot;Se vuoi pace&quot;). Claudius believes her; nevertheless, when Poppaea, Otho, and Nero arrive, Claudius announces that Nero and Poppaea will marry, and that Otho shall have the throne. No one is satisfied with this arrangement, as their desires have all changed, so Claudius in a spirit of reconciliation reverses his judgement, giving Poppaea to Otho and the throne to Nero. He then summons the goddess Juno, who descends to pronounce a general blessing (&quot;V&#x27;accendano le tede i raggi delle stelle&quot;).

==Performance history==

===Premiere===
The date of &quot;Agrippina&quot;″s first performance, about which there was at one time some uncertainty, has been confirmed by a manuscript newsletter as 26 December 1709. The cast consisted of some of Northern Italy&#x27;s leading singers of the day, including Antonio Carli in the lead bass role; Margherita Durastanti, who had recently sung the role of Mary Magdalene in Handel&#x27;s &quot;La resurrezione&quot;; and Diamante Scarabelli, whose great success at Bologna in the 1697 pasticcio &quot;Perseo&quot; inspired the publication of a volume of eulogistic verse entitled &quot;La miniera del Diamante&quot;.

&quot;Agrippina&quot; proved extremely popular and established Handel&#x27;s international reputation. Its original run of 27 performances was extraordinary for that time. Handel&#x27;s biographer John Mainwaring wrote of the first performance: &quot;The theatre at almost every pause resounded with shouts of &quot;Viva il caro Sassone!&quot; (&#x27;Long live the beloved Saxon!&#x27;) They were thunderstruck with the grandeur and sublimity of his style, for they had never known till then all the powers of harmony and modulation so closely arranged and forcibly combined.&quot; Many others recorded overwhelmingly positive responses to the work.

===Later performances===
Between 1713 and 1724 there were productions of &quot;Agrippina&quot; in Naples, Hamburg, and Vienna, although Handel himself never revived the opera after its initial run. The Naples production included additional music by Francesco Mancini. In the later 18th, and throughout the 19th centuries, Handel&#x27;s operas fell into obscurity, and none were staged between 1754 and 1920. However, when interest in Handel&#x27;s operas awakened in the 20th century, &quot;Agrippina&quot; received several revivals, beginning with a 1943 production at Handel&#x27;s birthplace, Halle, under conductor Richard Kraus at the Halle Opera House. In this performance the alto role of Otho, composed for a woman, was changed into a bass accompanied by English horns, &quot;with calamitous effects on the delicate balance and texture of the score&quot;, according to Winton Dean. The Radio Audizioni Italiane produced a live radio broadcast of the opera on 25 October 1953, the opera&#x27;s first presentation other than on stage. The cast included Magda László in the title role and Mario Petri as Claudius, and the performance was conducted by Antonio Pedrotti.

A 1958 performance in Leipzig, and several more stagings in Germany, preceded the British première of the opera at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1963. This was followed in 1982 by the first fully professional production in England. It was performed by Kent Opera with the conductor, Ivan Fischer, making his debut with the company and the orchestra playing on baroque instruments. Felicity Palmer took the title role. In 1983 the opera returned to Venice, for a performance under Christopher Hogwood at the Teatro Malibran. In the United States a concert performance had been given on 16 February 1972 at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, but the opera&#x27;s first fully staged American performance was in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1985. That same year it reached New York, with a concert performance at Alice Tully Hall, where the opera was described as a &quot;genuine rarity&quot;. The Fort Worth performance was quickly followed by further American stagings in Iowa City and Boston. The historically informed performance movement inspired two period instrument productions of &quot;Agrippina&quot; in 1985 and 1991 respectively. Both were in Germany, the first was in the Schlosstheater Schwetzingen, the other at the Göttingen International Handel Festival.

===21st century revivals===
There have been numerous productions in the 21st century. There was a fully staged performance at the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, New York in 2001, conducted by Harry Bicket and directed by Lillian Groag. This production then moved in 2002 to the New York City Opera, revived in 2007, and was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic as &quot;odd ... presented as broad satire, a &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; version of &quot;I, Claudius&quot;&quot;, although the musical performances were generally praised. In Britain, the English National Opera (ENO) staged an English-language version in February 2007, directed by David McVicar, which received a broadly favourable critical response, although critic Fiona Maddocks identified features of the production that diminished the work: &quot;Music so witty, inventive and humane requires no extra gilding&quot;. Some of the later revivals used countertenors in the roles written for castrati. Joyce DiDonato has performed the title role in productions in London at The Royal Opera in 2019 and at the Metropolitan Opera New York in 2020, among other venues.

==Music==
&quot;Agrippina&quot; is considered Handel&#x27;s first operatic masterpiece; according to Winton Dean it has few rivals for its &quot;sheer freshness of musical invention&quot;. Grimani&#x27;s libretto has also been praised: &quot;The New Penguin Opera Guide&quot; describes it as one of the best Handel ever set, and praises the &quot;light touch&quot; with which the characters are vividly portrayed. &quot;Agrippina&quot; as a whole is, in the view of the scholar John E. Sawyer, &quot;among the most convincing of all the composer&#x27;s dramatic works&quot;.

===Style===
Stylistically, &quot;Agrippina&quot; follows the standard pattern of the era by alternating recitative and &quot;da capo&quot; arias. In accordance with 18th-century opera convention the plot is mainly carried forward in the recitatives, while the musical interest and exploration of character takes place in the arias—although on occasion Handel breaks this mould by using arias to advance the action. With one exception the recitative sections are &quot;secco&quot; (&quot;dry&quot;), where a simple vocal line is accompanied by continuo only. The anomaly is Otho&#x27;s &quot;Otton, qual portentoso fulmine&quot;, where he finds himself robbed of the throne and deserted by his beloved Poppaea; here the recitative is accompanied by the orchestra, as a means of highlighting the drama. Dean and Knapp describe this, and Otho&#x27;s aria which follows, as &quot;the peak of the opera&quot;. The 19th-century musical theorist Ebenezer Prout singles out Agrippina&#x27;s &quot;Non ho cor che per amarti&quot; for special praise. He points out the range of instruments used for special effects, and writes that &quot;an examination of the score of this air would probably astonish some who think Handel&#x27;s orchestration is wanting in variety&quot;.

Handel made more use than was then usual of orchestral accompaniment in arias, but in other respects &quot;Agrippina&quot; is broadly typical of an older operatic tradition. For the most part the arias are brief, there are only two short ensembles, and in the quartet and the trio the voices are not heard together. However, Handel&#x27;s style would change very little in the next 30 years, a point reflected in the reviews of the Tully Hall performance of &quot;Agrippina&quot; in 1985, which refer to a &quot;string of melodious aria and ensembles, any of which could be mistaken for the work of his mature London years&quot;.
===Character===
Of the main characters, only Otho is not morally contemptible. Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster he would become, is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is pompous, complacent, and something of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel&#x27;s sex kittens, is also a liar and a flirt. The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas, Handel avoids laughing at his characters.

In &quot;Agrippina&quot; the &quot;da capo&quot; aria is the musical form used to illustrate character in the context of the opera. The first four arias of the work exemplify this: Nero&#x27;s &quot;Con raggio&quot;, in a minor key and with a descending figure on the key phrase &quot;il trono ascenderò&quot; (&quot;I will ascend the throne&quot;) characterises him as weak and irresolute. Pallas&#x27;s first aria &quot;La mia sorte fortunata&quot;, with its &quot;wide-leaping melodic phrasing&quot; introduces him as a bold, heroic figure, contrasting with his rival Narcissus whose introspective nature is displayed in his delicate aria &quot;Volo pronto&quot; which immediately follows. Agrippina&#x27;s introductory aria &quot;L&#x27;alma mia&quot; has a mock-military form which reflects her outward power, while subtle musical phrasing establishes her real emotional state. Poppaea&#x27;s arias are uniformly light and rhythmic, while Claudius&#x27;s short love song &quot;Vieni O cara&quot; gives a glimpse of his inner feelings, and is considered one of the gems of the score.

===Irony===
Grimani&#x27;s libretto is full of irony, which Handel reflects in the music. His settings sometimes illustrate both the surface meaning, as characters attempt to deceive each other, and the hidden truth. For instance, in her aria in act 1, &quot;Non ho cor che per amarti&quot;, Agrippina promises Poppaea that deceit will never mar their new friendship, while tricking her into ruining Otho&#x27;s chances for the throne. Handel&#x27;s music illuminates her deceit in the melody and minor modal key, while a simple, emphasised rhythmic accompaniment hints at clarity and openness. In act 3, Nero&#x27;s announcement that his passion is ended and that he will no longer bound by it (in &quot;Come nube che fugge dal vento&quot;) is set to bitter-sweet music which suggests that he is deceiving himself. In Otho&#x27;s &quot;Coronato il crin&quot; the agitated nature of the music is the opposite of what the &quot;euphoric&quot; tone of the libretto suggests. Contrasts between the force of the libretto and the emotional colour of the actual music would develop into a constant feature of Handel&#x27;s later London operas.

==List of arias and musical numbers==
The index of Chrysander&#x27;s edition (see below) lists the following numbers, excluding the &quot;secco&quot; recitatives. Variants from the libretto are also noted.
Act 1

Act 2

Act 3

==Recordings==
==Editions==
Handel&#x27;s autograph score survives, with the Sinfonia and first recitatives missing, but it shows significant differences from the libretto, due to changes made for the first performances. Handel&#x27;s performing score is lost. Three early manuscript copies, probably dating from 1710, are held in Vienna; one of these may have been a gift from Grimani to the future Emperor Charles VI. These copies, presumably based on the lost performing score, show further changes from the autograph. A manuscript from the 1740s known as the &quot;Flower score&quot; is described by Dean as &quot;a miscellany in haphazard order&quot;.

In about 1795 the British composer Samuel Arnold produced an edition based on early copies; this edition, while it contains errors and inaccuracies, has been called &quot;probably a reasonable reflection of early performances&quot;. The Chrysander edition of 1874 has a tendency to &quot;sweep Arnold aside when he is right and follow him when he is wrong&quot;. Musicologist Anthony Hicks calls it &quot;an unfortunate attempt to reconcile the autograph text with Arnold and the wordbook, the result being a composite version of no authority&quot;.

In 1950 Bärenreiter published Hellmuth Christian Wolff&#x27;s edition, prepared for the 1943 Halle revival and reflecting the casting of basses for Otto and Narcissus, even when they sing what would otherwise be the alto part in the last chorus. It presents a German adaptation of the recitatives and written out embellishments for the da capo arias as well as numerous cuts. The B-flat fugue G 37 appears as an act 2 overture along with other instrumental music.

An edition by John E Sawyer appeared in 2013 as series II vol. 3 of the &quot;Hallische Händelausgabe&quot;. It is based on the 1709 version, with ballet music borrowed from Rodrigo, and contains two appendices with added and reconstructed music as well as deleted versions from the autograph.

<text>Rob Sampson (born October 27, 1955) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003 and was a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris.

==Background==
Sampson has a Bachelor of Arts degree and an MBA from Queen&#x27;s University. Sampson worked at the Toronto branch of the Toronto Dominion Bank from 1980 to 1987, and at the Toronto branch of Chase Manhattan from 1987 to 1995. He also worked for Brays Lane Consulting in 1995, and is a Fellow in the Institute of Canadian Bankers. In 1992-93, he was an Executive Member of the Planning Advisory Committee for the City of Toronto.

==Politics==
He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Steve Mahoney (later a federal cabinet minister under Jean Chrétien) by about 3,000 votes in the riding of Mississauga West. This was considered an upset; the Tories performed extremely well in Mississauga in this election, but most observers expected that Mahoney would retain his seat. He was named a Minister without Portfolio in Mike Harris&#x27;s government on 16 August 1996, with responsibility for privatization.

During his time as Minister of Privatization, he was best known for sale of the 407-ETR Major Highway for $3.1 billion. The highway was sold to a consortium including the Spanish company Grupo Ferrovial and its subsidiary Cintra Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte, SNC-Lavalin, and Capital d&#x27;Amerique CDPQ, a subsidiary of the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec. The sale was heavily criticized as being well below value. It was estimated that the cost of acquiring the land exceeded $100 billion since the 1970s.

Sampson was re-elected in the new riding of Mississauga Centre in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal George Winter by over 4,000 votes. He was promoted to Minister of Correctional Services on 17 June 1999. He stepped down from this position on 4 December 2000 to demonstrate ministerial responsibility after a backbench Tory named Doug Galt listed the names of several young offenders in the legislature; he was returned to his position on March 8, 2001.

Sampson is a committed Neo-conservative, and supported numerous right-wing economic policy initiatives during his time in government, including the controversial privatization of Highway 407. As Correctional Services minister, he promoted the privatization of Ontario&#x27;s prison system despite warnings that this could result in decreased safety. Sampson was dropped from cabinet when Ernie Eves succeeded Mike Harris as party leader in 2002.

In the provincial election of 2003, he was defeated by Liberal Harinder Takhar by fewer than 3,000 votes, amid a general decline in support for the Tories in Mississauga.

<doc id="1257938" wikidata="Q3785731" url="?curid=1257938" title="New Zealand hip-hop">
<text>New Zealand hip hop derives from the wider hip hop cultural movement originating amongst African Americans in the United States. Like the parent movement, New Zealand hip hop consists of four parts: rapping, DJing, graffiti art and breakdancing. The first element of hip hop to reach New Zealand was breakdancing, which gained notoriety after the release of the 1979 movie &quot;The Warriors&quot;. The first hip hop hit single, &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; by the Sugarhill Gang, became a hit in New Zealand when it was released there in 1980, a year after it was released in the United States. By the middle of the 1980s, breakdancing and graffiti art were established in urban areas like Wellington and Christchurch. By the early 1990s, hip hop became a part of mainstream New Zealand culture.

Many popular songs for a large part of the genre&#x27;s history in New Zealand have been performed with mostly English lyrics; however there has been a inverse trend in recent times towards prioritizing of rap in the indigenous Māori language by artists such as Mā.

==Music==
===Early years and Māori influence===
Some of the first hip hop musicians to achieve recognition combined American styles with Māori language and traditional songs. The music video for Dalvanius Prime&#x27;s 1984 popular hit track &quot;Poi E&quot; incorporated hip hop dance elements, making it the first time New Zealanders viewed hip hop culture in association with a local recording. Upper Hutt Posse likewise combined hip hop and Māori culture in their 1988 single &quot;E Tu&quot;, which is recognised as New Zealand&#x27;s first pure hip hop single. A bootleg recording of their song &quot;Hardcore Hiphop&quot; reached number one on Christchurch student radio in February 1988. Some rappers, such as the members of Upper Hutt Posse, became known for politicised lyrics in support of tino rangatiratanga (Māori sovereignty).

Another popular Māori group which incorporated hip hop music was Moana and the Moahunters, which won a New Zealand Music Industry award for best Māori recording in 1992, speaking out against the perceived racism they saw against Māori people in New Zealand. They cited the rarity of airtime on national radio for Māori music and the exclusion from the mainstream music industry as reflective of the wider societal problem. The awarded song is called &quot;AEIOU (Akona Te Reo)&quot;, and translates as &quot;Learn the Language&quot;. Its release was directed primarily at Māori youth who did not speak Māori. The majority of the lyrics are in English.

Early hip hop releases in New Zealand included the collection &quot;Ak89 - In Love With These Rhymes&quot;, compiled by Simon Laan and released by Auckland radio bFm in 1989 (on cassette only), and a variety of releases by Southside Records. Amongst these were releases by Urban Disturbance featuring a young rapper, Zane Lowe, now a UK radio personality, and MC OJ &amp; Rhythm Slave.

By the late 1980s, the South Auckland and West Auckland hip hop scenes were thriving, with dozens of young acts, many promoted as part of the Voodoo Rhyme syndicate which featured acts such as the Semi MCs, MC Slam &amp; DJ Jam, Total Effect, Sisters Underground, Enemy Productions (which featured a very young Dei Hamo), Boy C &amp; the BB3 (which later became Three the Hard Way), the Chain Gang and others. Most of the acts that joined the Voodoo Rhyme Syndicate were discovered through talent contests by Voodoo Rhyme Syndicate founder, DJ Andy Vann. The Voodoo Rhyme Syndicate hosted Voodoo dance parties to raise funds to record the acts, and formed Voodoo vinyl in 1989. Voodoo Vinyl&#x27;s first release in 1989 was Enemy Productions Stop Tagging produced by founder Andy Vann. Other notable related releases include Semi MCs&#x27; &quot;Set Your Body Free &amp; Trust Me&quot; and MC Slam &amp; DJ Jam&#x27;s &quot;Prove Me Wrong&quot;, both of which achieved Top 40 success in New Zealand. A DJ competition was held in Auckland in 1989, with DJ Ned Roy winning.

The first major New Zealand commercial hip hop hit was &quot;Hip Hop Holiday&quot; by 3 The Hard Way, featuring the vocal stylings of Bobbylon (from the seminal 1990s Reggae/Punk band the Hallelujah Picassos). Released by Deepgrooves Entertainment and distributed by Festival Records, it sampled &quot;Dreadlock Holiday&quot; by 10CC and became a number one hit in 1994.

Upper Hutt Posse&#x27;s DJ, DLT, also influenced the local scene in Auckland, including Joint Force, Che Fu and Dam Native. DLT began the influential radio show &quot;True Skool Hip Hop Show&quot;, which joined Wellington&#x27;s &quot;Wednesday Night Jam&quot; in promoting hip hop. Simon Grigg &amp; Nick D&#x27;Angelo championed hip hop on a dedicated hip hop radio show on bFm).

===Polynesian influence===
In Wellington, K.O.S.-163, more commonly known as Kosmo, influenced the hip hop scene during the 1980s. Returning from a visit to Los Angeles, Kosmo introduced a new type of dance called popping to New Zealand. Aware of their accents and other &#x27;foreign&#x27; markers, Samoan youth in California used dancing and hip hop to assert themselves. Nearly three decades of Samoan involvement in street dance and rap music influenced the scene in other cities, including Wellington. With two other New Zealanders, Kosmo started the hip hop group called &quot;The Mau&quot;; their name paying homage to Samoan independence.

Wellington&#x27;s underground scene was vibrant in the late &#x27;80s, from whence arose the local supergroup Rough Opinion and a wave of performers like The Wanderers, Temple Jones and Hamofide.

In the 1990s Maori and Polynesian hip hop musicians grew steadily more popular, leading to a fusion of Pacific and traditional hip hop sounds as Urban Pasifika. Pauly Fuemana as OMC with Alan Jansson took the urban Pacific sound into the world&#x27;s charts with the multi-million selling &quot;How Bizarre&quot;, in 1995. It remains the best-selling song ever recorded in New Zealand. Rapper Scribe became the first to top both the single and album charts at the same time in 2004. Savage became the first New Zealand hip hop artist in history to have a single achieve platinum certification status in the United States with his single &quot;Swing&quot;. The track featured in the 2007 film &quot;Knocked Up.&quot; Many top hip hop artists are signed with Dawn Raid Entertainment, a Polynesian-run record label based in Manukau. Dawn Raid briefly went out of business early in 2007 after financial problems resulting from the expensive production of several albums.

Che Fu remains one of New Zealand&#x27;s most successful hip hop artists. He began his career at high school with a group of friends and they eventually formed the Low Down Dirty Blues Band, which went on to be the legendary Supergroove. Their first album, &quot;Traction&quot; sold triple platinum and went on to win countless awards. Che Fu&#x27;s fame continued through the 90s with his involvement with DLT in the number one hit song Chains in 1996, and in 2002 he won album of the year in the New Zealand music awards.

===Hip hop in the 2000s and 2010s===
The years 2004–2005 are often seen as a high-water mark for the popularity of hip hop music in New Zealand, and a book on the subject, &quot;Hip Hop Music In Aotearoa&quot;, won a national book award.

Smashproof&#x27;s single &quot;Brother&quot;, featuring singer Gin Wigmore, reached the top of the New Zealand charts in 2009.

Modern New Zealand hip hop has evolved into many styles, and artists such as Team Dynamite, Homebrew, Louie Knuxx, Rizván and the like are popular in New Zealand, and artists tend to incorporate many elements from different genres. Classic artists such as Che Fu and King Kapisi are still very much current in the music scene and perform regularly also, and have been a major influence on the sound of hip hop in this country.

===Hip hop in the 2020s===
UK-born, Auckland-based Nigerian hip hop artist and producer Mazbou Q was one of the organisers of the Black Lives Matter George Floyd protests in Auckland on 1 June and 14 June 2020. He spoke about the ongoing persecution of the Black African communities, including: &quot;The same white supremacy which has led to disproportionate killings of Black people in the US exists here in New Zealand.&quot; He called on Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to condemn violence against Black Americans. He also spoke and wrote about the appropriation of Black American culture, including hip hop ghetto culture born from the oppressed minorities the South Bronx in the 1970s, and the lack of exposure for New Zealand Black African hip hop artists compared to Māori and Pasifika artists. As a result, schools invited him, and other organisers, to speak to their students and staff.

== APRA Silver Scroll Award ==
The annual APRA Silver Scroll Awards in New Zealand is a prestigious honour for New Zealand songwriters. In 1999, King Kapisi became the first hip hop artist to receive the Silver Scroll Award for his single &quot;Reverse Resistance&quot;. In 2002, Che Fu (and Godfrey de Grut) won for &quot;Misty Frequencies&quot;, Nesian Mystik in 2004 with their single &quot;For the People,&quot; and in 2004, Scribe and P-Money won with their huge hit &quot;Not Many.&quot;

==Breakdancing==
Breakdancing first came to New Zealand via TV, Movies and American Samoa through Western Samoa in the early 1980s. One can see the influence of Samoan culture in New Zealand&#x27;s appropriation of breakdancing specifically through language. The term &quot;bopping,&quot; for example, comes from a Samoan pronunciation of popping, one of the elements in breakdance, where a dancer will move in a stilted fashion, isolating their limbs robotically. After its initial period of popularity, breakdancing fell out of fashion for most of the 1990s. Late in that decade it underwent a revival, and breakdancing stages can be found at events such as the Aotearoa Hip-Hop Summit.

The nearly three decades of Samoan involvement in street dance and rap music in California has significantly impacted Samoan cultural production in other places where Samoans have settled, including New Zealand. The dancing in New Zealand is heavily influenced by American dances.

One reason break dancing became popular was that many youth saw it as a way of being recognized or a channel of identity. Maori youth that had little chance of being recognized for accomplishments in school or sport found break dancing as a new way to achieve recognition. Early on, New Zealand even sponsored a national break dancing competition for young Maori and Pacific Islanders. This helped many young breakers to realize their potential by giving them a nation audience.

Many of the Maori and Pacific Island youth found alternative possibilities to organize their daily lives. Images of street dance arriving via imported American media - such as the movies Flashdance or Beat Street granted a legitimacy to their efforts. This gave a boost of confidence for both Maori and the children of recent immigrants, and the American street dance forms such as popping, locking and breaking created a friendly environment for Maori and Pacific Islander youth in order to fashion their own styles and codes.

New Zealand-born choreographer and dancer Parris Goebel, who is of Samoan descent, has worked with artists including Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Janet Jackson, Jennifer Lopez, Nicki Minaj, BIGBANG, CL, iKON, Taeyang. Her work has included choreographing routines and starring in music videos and movies. One of her notable successes was her work choreographing the video &quot;Sorry&quot; for Justin Bieber, which as of March 2016 is one of the 5 top viewed videos on YouTube with more than 1.7 billion views. Goebel went on to choreograph and direct all thirteen of Justin Bieber&#x27;s Purpose: The Movement videos. These videos have totaled over 3 billion views combined.

==Battle rap==
Battle rapping has had a strong underground presence in New Zealand. 1Outz is an organized rap battle league that began in Auckland, and Red Zone Battle&#x27;s is another which began in Christchurch.

==Graffiti art==
As elsewhere, New Zealand graffiti art takes two forms: bombing (usually large scale and multi-coloured, using paint and generally requiring some artistic skill) and tagging (stylised writing of the tagger&#x27;s &#x27;tag&#x27; name). In 1999 the Dowse Art Museum mounted an exhibition of street art called &quot;Style Crimes&quot;, followed by &quot;Common Ground&quot; in 2009. Exhibitions signalled street art&#x27;s growing acceptance as a legitimate art form. The artistic quality of the best work was recognised and practitioners were able to make a career out of street art. Some were commissioned by local councils and businesses to create pieces. Organisations for troubled youth ran legal graffiti sessions. Another early event was&quot; Disrupt the System&quot;, organised in Aotea Square, Auckland, in 2000. More recent events include Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Oi You!&quot; (first held in 2010), Taupō&#x27;s &quot;Graffiato&quot; (2011), Auckland&#x27;s &quot;All Fresco&quot; (2013), Christchurch&#x27;s &quot;From the Ground Up&quot; (2013) and Kawerau&#x27;s &quot;Street Legal&quot; (2014).

===Artists===
Askew One (Elliot O&#x27;Donnell) is the most prominent street artist in New Zealand and is well known in street art circles overseas. He started out tagging as a teenager in the 1990s and graduated to pieces, and eventually to works on canvas. Some street artists work together in collectives. Smooth Inc were at work in Auckland in the 1980s. They were followed by TMD (The Most Dedicated) in the mid-1990s. Cut Collective was founded in 2006. Its members have been commissioned to make public murals, and have exhibited at the Dowse Art Museum, Auckland Art Gallery and Dunedin Public Art Gallery. Many female artists have gained recognition for their work, including Diva, Misery (Tanja Thompson), Flox (Hayley King), Erin Forsyth, Ikon and Mica Still.

<text>Ornithopoda () is a clade of ornithischian dinosaurs, called ornithopods (). They represent one of the most successful groups of herbivorous dinosaurs during the Cretaceous. The most primitive members of the group were bipedal and relatively small-sized, while advanced members of the subgroup Iguanodontia became quadrupedal and developed large body size. Their major evolutionary advantage was the progressive development of a chewing apparatus that became the most sophisticated ever developed by a non-avian dinosaur, rivaling that of modern mammals such as the domestic cow. They reached their apex of diversity and ecological dominance in the hadrosaurids (colloquially known as &#x27;duck-bills&#x27;), before they were wiped out by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event along with all other non-avian dinosaurs. Members are known worldwide.

==History of research==
In 1870, Thomas Henry Huxley listed Iguanodontidae (coined by Edward Drinker Cope a year earlier) as one of his three families of dinosaurs (alongside Megalosauridae and Scelidosauridae), including within it the genera &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;, and &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;, in addition to &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot; and tentatively &quot;Stenopelix&quot;. The term Ornithopoda was erected by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1881 as part of his then still ongoing investigation of the classification of Dinosauria. It was considered one of the four definite orders of dinosaurs, the others being Theropoda, Sauropoda, and Stegosauria (Hallopoda was considered a possible fifth). He subdivided the order into three families: Camptonotidae, Iguanodontidae, and Hadrosauridae; the former was a new name, whereas the latter two were carried over from the nomenclatures of Huxley and Edward Drinker Cope respectively. Within Camptonotidae he included the European &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot; and three American taxa he named himself, &quot;Camptonotus&quot;, &quot;Laosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Nanosaurus&quot;. &quot;Camptonotus&quot; was in 1885 renamed to &quot;Camptosaurus&quot;, as the original name was pre-occupied by a cricket; the associated family followed suit, becoming Camptosauridae. In Iguanodontidae, only found in Europe, he included &quot;Iguanodon&quot; and &quot;Vectisaurus&quot;. In Hadrosauridae, he included &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Cionodon&quot;, and tentatively &quot;Agathaumas&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Ornithopoda&quot; means &quot;bird feet&quot;, from the Greek &quot;ornithos&quot;, &quot;ornis&quot; (&quot;bird&quot;) and &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;podos&quot; (&quot;feet&quot;); this is in reference to members’ characteristic birdlike feet. They were also characterized as lacking in body armour, not developing a horny beak, having an elongated pubis (that eventually extended past the ilium), and having a missing hole in the lower jaw (a Mandibular fenestra). A variety of ornithopods, and related ornithischians, had thin cartilaginous plates along the outside of the ribs; in some cases, these plates mineralized and were fossilized. The function of these intercostal plates is unknown. They have been found with &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;, &quot;Nanosaurus&quot;, &quot;Parksosaurus&quot;, &quot;Talenkauen&quot;, &quot;Thescelosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Macrogryphosaurus&quot; to date.

The early ornithopods were only about 1 metre (3 feet) long, but probably very fast. They had a stiff tail, like the theropods, to help them balance as they ran on their hind legs. Later ornithopods became more adapted to grazing on all fours; their spines curved, and came to resemble the spines of modern ground-feeders, such as the bison. As they became more adapted to eating while bent over, they became facultative quadrupeds; still running on two legs, and comfortable reaching up into trees, but spending most of their time walking or grazing on all fours. The taxonomy of dinosaurs previously ascribed to the &quot;Hypsilophodontidae&quot; is problematic. The group previously consisted of all non-iguanodontian bipedal ornithischians, but a phylogenetic reappraisal has shown such species to be paraphyletic. As such, the hypsilophodont family is currently represented only by &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;.

Later ornithopods became larger, but never rivalled the incredible size of the long-necked, long-tailed sauropods. The very largest, such as &quot;Shantungosaurus&quot;, were as heavy as medium-sized sauropods (up to 23 metric tons/25 short tons), but never grew much beyond 15 metres (50 feet).

==Classification==


Historically, most indeterminate ornithischian bipeds were lumped in as ornithopods. Most have since been reclassified.

===Taxonomy===
Ornithopoda is usually given the rank of Suborder, within the order Ornithischia. While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favour among dinosaur paleontologists, some researchers have continued to employ such a classification, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Benton (2004) placed it as an infraorder within the suborder Cerapoda (originally named as an unranked clade), while others, such as Ibiricu &quot;et al.&quot; 2010, have retained it at its traditional ranking of suborder.

Iguanodontia is often listed as an infraorder within a suborder Ornithopoda, though Benton (2004) lists Ornithopoda as an infraorder and does not rank Iguanodontia. Traditionally, iguanodontians were grouped into the superfamily Iguanodontoidea and family Iguanodontidae. However, phylogenetic studies show that the traditional &quot;iguanodontids&quot; are a paraphyletic grade leading up to the hadrosaurs (duck-billed dinosaurs). Groups like Iguanodontoidea are sometimes still used as unranked clades in the scientific literature, though many traditional &quot;iguanodontids&quot; are now included in the more inclusive group Hadrosauroidea. Iguanodontia was originally phylogenetically defined, by Paul Sereno, in 1998, as the most inclusive group containing &quot;Parasaurolophus walkeri&quot; but not &quot;Hypsilophodon foxii&quot;. Later, in 2005, he amended the definition to include &quot;Thescelosaurus neglectus&quot; as a secondary external specifier, alongside &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;, accounting for the paraphyletic nature of Hypsilophodontidae. A 2017 study which named and described &quot;Burianosaurus&quot; noted that the type species &quot;Iguanodon bernissartensis&quot; must be part of the definition, and that the 2005 definition would, in their analysis, include a far larger group than intended (including Marginocephalia). They proposed an entirely new, node-based definition: the last common ancestor of &quot;Iguanodon bernissartensis&quot;, &quot;Dryosaurus altus&quot;, &quot;Rhabdodon priscus&quot;, and &quot;Tenontosaurus tilletti&quot;. 

In 2021, Iguanodontia was given a formal definition under the PhyloCode: &quot;The smallest clade containing &quot;Dryosaurus altus&quot;, &quot;Iguanodon bernissartensis&quot;, &quot;Rhabdodon priscus&quot;, and &quot;Tenontosaurus tilletti&quot;, provided that it does not include &quot;Hypsilophodon foxii&quot;.&quot; Under this revised definition, Iguanodontia is limited to its traditionally included species, and if it were found to include hypsilophodonts, which were not traditionally considered iguanodontians, it would become an invalid grouping. 

The slightly less inclusive clade Dryomorpha was named by Paul Sereno in 1986 and given a formal definition in the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; as &quot;the smallest clade containing &quot;Dryosaurus altus&quot; and &quot;Iguanodon bernissartensis&quot;&quot;. This group includes basal members such as &quot;Hesperonyx&quot;, members of the family Dryosauridae, and the derived clade Ankylopollexia.

===Phylogeny===
In 2021, Ornithopoda was given a formal definition under the PhyloCode: &quot;The largest clade containing &quot;Iguanodon bernissartensis&quot; but not &quot;Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis&quot; and &quot;Triceratops horridus&quot;.&quot;
The cladogram below follows a 2024 analysis of Fonseca &quot;et al.&quot;

<doc id="1257944" wikidata="Q2738971" url="?curid=1257944" title="WACA Ground">
<text>The WACA Ground () is a sports stadium in Perth, Western Australia. The stadium&#x27;s name derives from the initials of its owners and operators, the Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA).

The WACA has been referred to as Western Australia&#x27;s &quot;home of cricket&quot; since the early 1890s, with Test cricket played at the ground since the 1970–71 season. The ground is the home venue of Western Australia&#x27;s first-class cricket team, the Western Warriors, and the state&#x27;s Women&#x27;s National Cricket League side, the Western Fury. The Perth Scorchers, a Big Bash League franchise, played home matches at the ground until 2019. The Scorchers and Australian national team have shifted most matches to the nearby 60,000-seat Perth Stadium.

The pitch at the WACA is regarded as one of the quickest and bounciest in the world. These characteristics, in combination with the afternoon sea-breezes which regularly pass the ground (the Fremantle Doctor), have historically made the ground an attractive place for pace and swing bowlers. The outfield is exceptionally fast, contributing to the ground seeing some very fast scoring – as of February 2016, four of the nine fastest Test centuries have been scored at the WACA. The WACA has also hosted 7 scores of 99 in Test cricket – the most of any ground in the world.

Throughout its history, the ground has also been used for a range of other sports, including athletics carnivals, Australian rules football, baseball, soccer, rugby league, rugby union, and international rules football. However, recent years have seen most of these activities relocated to other venues. It has also been used for major rock concerts. The WACA Museum is located on-site and features exhibits about Western Australian cricket.

==Early history==

William Henry Wise, a gardener who came to WA from England in 1880, laid the first turf wicket at the WACA. Wise was personal gardener to Sir George Shenton, of Crawley. In addition to his work at the WACA Ground, he laid the first tennis court on the Perth Esplanade.

The Western Australian Cricket Association was officially established on 25 November 1885 under the Presidency of JCH James. In 1893, the WACA ground was officially opened, occupying a site of old swamp land to the east of the city. The association has a 999-year lease over the land (which expires in 2888). The long term of the lease means that, effectively, the association has freehold title (save that it cannot divest itself of any part of the land without the state government&#x27;s consent). Originally, the title covered 29 acres (117,000 m2), and took in what is now Gloucester Park. However, the latter part of the land was divested to the Trotting Association in the early 1920s. Between 1977 and 1979, (then-rebel) World Series Cricket matches were played at Gloucester Park because the Kerry Packer-led organisation was not granted access to the WACA.

The first match played on the turf wickets took place in February 1894. However, difficulties encountered in transporting teams to Western Australia meant that the ground was not part of Australia&#x27;s main cricket community for many years. Even with the building of a transcontinental railway, the trip from the eastern states still took several days. It took the introduction of scheduled flights to Western Australia to make the WACA readily accessible to interstate or overseas teams.

James Gardiner, president of the WACA for three terms between 1897 and 1924, proposed the adoption of &#x27;electorate&#x27; cricket (as it was first known) whereby teams were established on a district basis for competition. He also inaugurated Country Week cricket, during which country teams compete against each other. In 1907, the WACA ground was under threat of being controlled by the Perth City Council to recover debts. Gardiner led the bid to save the ground and secured a government loan. Further financial difficulties led Gardiner to again raise funds and donations with a cricket match by the Australian XI team in 1912.

From 1928 to 1935, motorcycle speedway took place around the outside of the oval. The Australian champion in 1928 and 1929 Sig Schlam, lost his life in a crash at the ground on 1 November 1930.
==Ground developments==
The WACA ground, like many stadiums of its era, has undergone various re-developments. The most notable are:
* The building, in 1895, of the first grandstand; seating 500 people and incorporating dressing rooms, a dining room, bathrooms, members&#x27; rooms and bars.
* In 1931 the Farley Stand was opened, named after W.J. Farley, the association&#x27;s president from 1915–1916 to 1916–17 and secretary from 1917–1918 to 1928–1929.
* In 1948 the scoreboard at the WACA was destroyed by a storm. In 1954 a replacement scoreboard was built, a donation from the North West Murchison Cricket Association. This, now iconic, scoreboard remains in operation.
* In the 1960s the Players Pavilion was built to provide facilities for the players and the WACA administration. Additional seating was later added, initially to accommodate the first Test match to be played at the WACA (Australia v England in 1970).
* Also to welcome Test cricket to the WACA, 1970 saw the opening of the &quot;Test Stand&quot;. It was later renamed the Inverarity Stand, after Western Australian, South Australian and Australian player John Inverarity.
* From 1984 to 1988 the WACA underwent major renovations, including a realignment and a complete resurfacing of the ground and the construction of new terracing and seating in the outer. 

Also built were: -

* the three tiered Prindiville Stand, name after the then WACA president Bernie Prindiville in 1985
* the two tiered Lillee-Marsh Stand named after the former WA Australian cricketers Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh in 1988, which increased the ground&#x27;s seating capacity. 
Six large light towers were also installed in 1986 at a cost of $4.2 million, allowing for night time sports such as day-night cricket matches to be played at the ground. An icon of the WACA, the floodlights are 70 metres high and cost $600 per hour to run.

These redevelopments also made the venue an attractive venue for sports other than cricket, and it was during the late 1980s and early 1990s that the ground saw its greatest use as a multi-sports venue. From 1987 to 2000, the ground was used by the West Coast Eagles, and from 1995 by the Fremantle Dockers, both Western Australian-based AFL teams. 72 AFL matches were held at the ground during this time. From 1995 to 1997 the WACA also served as the home ground for the Western Reds rugby league team. In the late 1990s the ground played host to the Perth Heat in the former Australian Baseball League (1989-1999).

However, for various reasons these sports moved away from the WACA (in the case of night football, to Subiaco Oval), and as a consequence the WACA was again redeveloped in 2002. The capacity of the ground was reduced to around 20,000 with the demolition of the Farley Stand and the old Players Pavilion with the stands being replaced by podiums for temporary stands, replacing the seats square of the wickets with grass hills, the construction of a new Players Pavilion in between the Lillee-Marsh Stand and the Scoreboard, replacement of seats in the remaining grandstands and the dimensions of the playing arena were also decreased by a total of 31 metres at the eastern and western boundaries, meaning Australian rules football could no longer be played at the ground. From time to time, temporary stands are used to boost the ground&#x27;s capacity to 24,500.

In 2013, a new video screen was installed at the WACA near the old scoreboard, replacing one of the old temporary screens.

===Rejected proposals===
In April 2007 the Western Australian Cricket Association announced a $250m redevelopment of the stadium. Seating capacity was to be increased, with residential and commercial buildings built in the surrounding areas. The project was to be done in partnership with Ascot Capital Limited with a three- to four-year time frame. WACA members gave final approval for the project in July 2010 and construction was expected to commence in March 2011. However, by November 2011 work on the redevelopment had still yet to commence, and it was reported that delays could continue for years. Although the project received finance, tax office and members&#x27; approval, adverse market conditions were believed to have made the project unfeasible. The redevelopment was also the subject of a dispute between the WACA and the Australian Cricketers Association, with the players&#x27; union seeking 26 per cent of the value of the project.
In November 2012 the WACA and Ascot Capital Limited commenced selling 137 apartments in &quot;The Gardens&quot;, a planned 10-story residential complex to be located on the western boundary line of the ground. Construction of The Gardens was expected to commence mid-2013 and be completed by mid-2015. The agreement between the WACA and Ascot Capital would have seen new northern grandstands, an increase in ground capacity and a long term revenue stream. However, in December 2013 the WACA released a statement that it had abandoned the so-called Gardens Development because it was unable to achieve the pre-sales target in order to finance the project.

In September 2013 Cricket Australia announced that the WACA ground would not host a Test match in the shortened 2014/15 season to accommodate the 2015 Cricket World Cup, a decision which left Perth without a summer test match for the first time in nearly 40 years. Cricket Australia said the WACA Ground required significant improvements, given it has the smallest capacity of the five mainland capital city venues.

===2019-2025 redevelopments===

By the 2018/19 summer, the WACA Ground was no longer the primary international cricket venue in Perth, having been replaced by Perth Stadium in Burswood for most limited overs internationals, Test matches and domestic Big Bash League (BBL) matches for Perth Scorchers. Several years before construction of Perth Stadium concluded, the WACA proposed developing the ground into a 15,000-capacity boutique stadium with improved facilities. In March 2019 the WACA unveiled plans to improve cricket training facilities and enable the ground to host large-scale community events. The plans also included a proposal to reshape the ground to once again be capable of hosting Australian rules football matches, notably marquee WAFL matches. The total cost would be $75 million, of which $60 million would need to be either privately financed or granted by state and federal governments.

In August 2019, the Western Australian Government provided a $100,000 grant to the Western Australian Cricket Association to construct two new change rooms under the Lillee-Marsh Stand to support women&#x27;s cricket in the state. Construction of the change rooms was completed in time for the 2020 ICC Women&#x27;s T20 World Cup. In December 2019 the WACA confirmed a $30 million grant had been granted from the Federal Government for major upgrade works. This was later matched with an identical grant from the Western Australian Government.

Redevelopment works began in August 2021. The Inverarity and Prindiville stands have been demolished and will be replaced by a community sports hub and a new multi-level public pavilion, and the grass hills at either end have been partially excavated to allow Australian rules football matches to again be played at the ground. New facilities will include a high-performance cricket centre, a new museum, cafe, gym, and a six-lane, 50-metre outdoor swimming pool. A new aquatic centre will include an indoor learn-to-swim pool and waterslides. As part of the redevelopment, five of the light towers were also upgraded with the replacement of the older lights with LED sports lighting as well as the ability to be lit up in various colours in a similar way to Perth Stadium&#x27;s exterior and were first switched on in December 2022. Light tower no.2, located next the site of the original Players Pavilion was not upgraded and was demolished to make way for the high performance centre. 

The redevelopment of the WACA was originally intended to be completed in December 2023. This was later revised to September 2025. The East Fremantle Football Club of the West Australian Football League (WAFL) played their home matches at the WACA for the 2022 and 2023 seasons when East Fremantle Oval underwent its own redevelopment.

==Notable events at the WACA==

*Australian wicket keeper Adam Gilchrist hit the second fastest hundred in Test match history (now the fourth fastest), off 57 balls, in the 3rd Ashes Test match, in December 2006.(Scorecard)This was just one more ball than the record set by Viv Richards in 1985–1986. It eclipsed the previous Australian record of a hundred off 67 balls set by Jack Gregory at Johannesburg in 1921–1922. Gilchrist did not score a run from seven of his first nine deliveries.
*The WACA hosted its first Twenty20 International match on 11 December 2007. Australia defeated New Zealand by 55 runs (Scorecard).
*India defeated Australia by 72 runs to end Australia&#x27;s record-equaling Test match winning streak of 16 consecutive wins, in January 2008 (Scorecard).
*South Africa defeated Australia by six wickets in a Test match in December 2008, achieving the second-highest successful run chase in Test history when they reached the victory target of 414 late in the second session on the final day, for the loss of just four wickets. In the match, Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson became the first left-arm paceman to take eight wickets in a Test innings with figures of 8/61 in South Africa&#x27;s first innings (Scorecard).
*In December 2009, West Indian Chris Gayle scored the fifth-fastest hundred in Test cricket history, against Australia (now the eighth fastest). His hundred came off just 70 balls and included six sixes and nine fours.(Scorecard).
;2010s
*During a one-day international between Australia and Pakistan in January 2010, Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi was captured by television cameras making two solid biting motions into the ball; he was suspended for two matches after pleading guilty to ball tampering. In the same game, Pakistan player Khalid Latif was crash-tackled to the ground by a spectator who had run onto the ground to reach the cricketer, later leading to intense scrutiny of the WACA&#x27;s security measures.
* In January 2012, Australian batsman David Warner scored a century off 69 balls against India, the equal fourth fastest hundred in Test cricket history shared with Shivnarine Chanderpaul of the West Indies (now equal sixth fastest).(Scorecard).
*Liam Davis and Adam Voges had a 343-run partnership for Western Australia v New South Wales in February 2012 (Scorecard). This ranks inside the top-five WA partnerships of all time and marked the best third-wicket WA partnership against NSW. Davis&#x27; score of 303* is the 16th highest score in Sheffield Shield history.
*The Guinness World Record for the highest basketball shot in the world was thrown from one of the four flood-light towers at the WACA (Video).
*In January 2014, the WACA hosted its third women&#x27;s Test match, between England and Australia. In a low scoring contest, in which the momentum ebbed and flowed until the final morning, England emerged the winner, by 61 runs, but Ellyse Perry of Australia was awarded player of the match (Scorecard). England&#x27;s veteran captain Charlotte Edwards has since described the Test as &quot;the most incredible match I&#x27;ll ever play in&quot;.
*On 13 November 2015 David Warner scored 253 against New Zealand, which at the time was the second highest test score at the ground In the same game on 15 November, Ross Taylor scored 290, the highest total against an Australian team in Australia. Also he overtook Warner&#x27;s score in the previous innings to make the second highest test score at the ground.
*On 14 December 2017, WACA hosted its final Ashes Test, and possibly final international match. In that match, both Dawid Malan (140) and Mitchell Marsh scored their maiden Test centuries (Marsh reached 181) and Jonny Bairstow scored his first century in Australia, Steve Smith scored his maiden home Test double-century, then went on to his highest Test score (239). Smith and Marsh also achieved the highest partnership for the 5th wicket at the WACA (301). The match ended with Australia regaining the Ashes.(Scorecard).
*On 25 January 2018, the WACA hosted its final Big Bash League match - Perth Scorchers V Adelaide Strikers.

<text>CSS Hampton was a wooden gunboat of the Confederate States Navy, one of the few &quot;Hampton&quot; class gunboats to be built.

&quot;Hampton&quot; was built at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in 1862 and based there until May 1862, when the yard was abandoned and the fleet moved up the James River. With Lieutenant John Herndon Maury, CSN, in command, &quot;Hampton&quot; participated in significant river actions including the battle at Dutch Gap on August 13, 1864; operations against Fort Harrison on September 29-October 1; and the engagement at Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff on October 22.

&quot;Hampton&quot; was burned by the Confederates as they evacuated Richmond, Virginia on April 3, 1865.

<doc id="1257960" wikidata="Q2164310" url="?curid=1257960" title="State of Fear">
<text>State of Fear is a 2004 techno-thriller novel by Michael Crichton, his fourteenth under his own name and twenty-fourth overall, in which eco-terrorists plot mass murder to publicize the danger of global warming. 

Despite being a work of fiction, the book contains many graphs and footnotes, two appendices, and a 20-page bibliography; all combining to give an actual or fictional impression of scientific authority; in support of Crichton&#x27;s beliefs which are critical of the scientific consensus on climate change. Climate scientists, science journalists, environmental groups, science advocacy organizations and the scientific community at large have criticized and disputed the presented views as being inaccurate, misleading and distorted.

The novel had an initial print run of 1.5 million copies and reached the #1 bestseller position at Amazon and #2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for one week in January 2005. The novel garnered mixed reviews, with some reviewers stating that the book&#x27;s misrepresentation of scientific facts and global warming denial distracts from the story. The book is thought to have popularized climate change denial and Antarctica cooling controversy.

==Plot summary==
Peter Evans is a lawyer for a millionaire philanthropist, George Morton. Evans&#x27; main duties are managing the legal affairs surrounding Morton&#x27;s contributions to an environmentalist organization, the National Environmental Resource Fund (NERF) (modeled after the Natural Resources Defense Council).

Morton becomes suspicious of NERF&#x27;s director, Nicholas Drake, after discovering that Drake has misused some of the funds Morton had donated to the group. Soon afterward, Morton is visited by two men, John Kenner and Sanjong Thapa, who appear on the surface to be researchers at MIT, but, in fact, are international law enforcement agents on the trail of an eco-terrorist group, the Environmental Liberation Front (ELF) (modeled on the Earth Liberation Front). The ELF is attempting to create &quot;natural&quot; disasters to convince the public of the dangers of global warming. All these events are timed to happen during a NERF-sponsored climate conference that will highlight the &quot;catastrophe&quot; of global warming. The eco-terrorists have no qualms about how many people are killed in their manufactured &quot;natural&quot; disasters and ruthlessly assassinate anyone who gets in their way (few would recognize their preferred methods as murder: the venom of a rare Australian blue-ringed octopus which causes paralysis, and &quot;lightning attractors&quot; which cause their victims to get electrocuted during electrical storms). Kenner and Thapa suspect Drake of being involved with the ELF to further his own ends (garnering more donations to NERF from the environmentally-minded public).

Evans joins Kenner, Thapa, and Morton&#x27;s assistant, Sarah Jones, on a globe-spanning series of adventures to thwart various ELF-manufactured disasters before these disasters kill thousands of people. Kenner&#x27;s niece, Jennifer Haynes, joins the group for the final leg as they travel to a remote island in the Solomon Islands to stop the ELF&#x27;s &quot;pièce de résistance&quot;, a tsunami that will inundate the California coastline just as Drake is winding up the international conference on the &quot;catastrophe&quot; of global warming. Along the way, the group battles man-eating crocodiles and cannibalistic tribesmen (who feast on Ted Bradley, an environmentalist TV actor whom Drake had sent to spy on Kenner and his team). The rest of the group is rescued in the nick of time by Morton, who had previously faked his own death to throw Drake off the trail so that he could keep watch on the ELF&#x27;s activities on the island while he waited for Kenner and his team to arrive.

The group has a final confrontation with the elite ELF team on the island during which Haynes is almost killed, and Evans kills one of the terrorists who had previously tried to kill both him and Jones in Antarctica. The rest of the ELF team is killed by the backwash from their own tsunami, which Kenner and his team have sabotaged just enough to prevent it from becoming a full-size tsunami and reaching California.

Morton, Evans, and Jones return to Los Angeles. Evans quits his law firm to work for Morton&#x27;s new, as yet unnamed, organization, which will practice environmental activism as a business, free from potential conflicts of interest. Morton hopes Evans and Jones will take his place in the new organization after his death.

== Allegorical characters ==

Several critics have suggested that Crichton uses the major characters as proxies for differing viewpoints on the topic of global warming in order to allow the reader to clearly follow the various positions portrayed in the book.

* Joseph Romm suggests that Kenner is a stand-in for Crichton himself.
* David Roberts suggests that Evans is the stand-in for the reader (who Crichton presumes accepts most of the tenets of global warming without any detailed study of it, but not unquestioningly).
*David Roberts also suggests that Ted Bradley is a stand-in for people who accept the &quot;environmentalist&quot; party line without question.
* Ronald Bailey suggests that Drake is a stand-in for the environmental movement &quot;professional&quot; activist.
* Bruce Barcott suggests that Jones, and Michael B. McElroy and Daniel P. Schrag suggest that Haynes are stand-ins for the academic community (intelligent enough to follow the debate but undecided until the evidence is presented), with Jones being the portion of the community likely to believe in global warming on less than undeniable evidence (they will accept &quot;Likely, but not proven&quot; as sufficient proof) and Haynes representing the part of the community that accepts undeniable evidence only.
* Michael B. McElroy and Daniel P. Schrag suggest that Haynes is a stand-in for conflicts of interest created by how the research is funded (i.e., her &quot;official&quot; story changes based on who is paying the bills, but in private she makes her true feelings known).
* Gregory Mone suggests that Thapa is a stand-in for the local university library/reputable Internet source verification, etc.

== Author&#x27;s afterword/appendices ==
Crichton included a statement of his views on global climate change as an afterword. In the &quot;Author&#x27;s message&quot;, Crichton states that the cause, extent, and threat of climate change are largely unknown. He finishes by endorsing the management of wilderness and the continuation of research into all aspects of the Earth&#x27;s environment.

In Appendix I, Crichton warns &quot;both sides&quot; of the global warming debate against the politicization of science. Here he provides two examples of the disastrous combination of pseudoscience and politics: the early 20th-century ideas of eugenics (which he directly cites as one of the theories that allowed for the Holocaust) and Lysenkoism.

This appendix is followed by a bibliography of 172 books and journal articles that Crichton presents &quot;...to assist those readers who would like to review my thinking and arrive at their own conclusions.&quot;

== Global warming ==
&quot;State of Fear&quot; is, like many of Crichton&#x27;s books, a fictional work that uses a mix of speculation and real world data, plus technological innovations as fundamental storyline devices. The debate over global warming serves as the backdrop for the book. Crichton supplies a personal afterword and two appendices that link the fictional part of the book with real examples of his thesis.

The main villains in the plot are environmental extremists. Crichton does place blame on &quot;industry&quot; in both the plot line and the appendices. Various assertions appear in the book, for example:

* The science behind global warming is speculative and incomplete, meaning no concrete conclusions can be drawn regarding human involvement in climate change.
* Elites in various fields use either real or artificial crises to maintain the existing social order, misusing the &quot;science&quot; behind global warming.
* As a result of potential conflicts of interest, the scientists conducting research on topics related to global warming may subtly change their findings to bring them in line with their funding sources. Since climatology can not incorporate double-blind studies, as are routine in other sciences, and climate scientists set experiment parameters, perform experiments within the parameters they have set, and analyze the resulting data, a phenomenon known as &quot;bias&quot; is offered as the most benign reason for climate science being so inaccurate.
* A key concept, delivered from the eccentric Professor Hoffman, suggests, in Hoffman&#x27;s words, the existence of a &quot;politico-legal-media&quot; complex, comparable to the &quot;military-industrial complex,&quot; of the Cold War era. Hoffman insists climate science began using more extreme, fear-inducing terms such as &quot;crisis,&quot; &quot;catastrophe,&quot; and, &quot;disaster,&quot; shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in order to maintain a level of fear in citizens, for the purpose of social control, since the specter of Soviet Communism was gone. This &quot;state of fear&quot; gives the book its title.

The book contains numerous charts and quotations from real world data (including footnoted charts) which suggest mean global temperature is, in this era, lowering. Where local temperatures show a general rise in mean temperature, mostly in major world cities, Crichton&#x27;s characters infer it is due to urban sprawl and deforestation, not carbon emissions.

Crichton argues for removing politics from science and uses global warming and real-life historical examples in the appendices to make this argument. In a 2003 speech at the California Institute of Technology, he expressed his concern about what he considered the &quot;emerging crisis in the whole enterprise of science—namely the increasingly uneasy relationship between hard science and public policy.&quot;

==Reception==

===Literary reviews===

The novel has received mixed reviews from professional literary reviewers.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s Ronald Bailey gave a favorable review, calling it &quot;a lightning-paced technopolitical thriller&quot; and the &quot;novelization of a speech that Mr. Crichton delivered in September 2003 at San Francisco&#x27;s Commonwealth Club.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Gregory Kirschling gave a favorable A− review and said it was &quot;one of Crichton&#x27;s best because it&#x27;s as hard to pigeonhole as greenhouse gas but certainly heats up the room.&quot;

In &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Sacha Zimmerman gave a mixed review. Zimmerman criticized Crichton&#x27;s presentation of data as condescending to the reader but concluded that the book was a &quot;globe-trotting thriller that pits man against nature in brutal spectacles while serving up just the right amount of international conspiracy and taking digs at fair-weather environmentalists.&quot;. In March 2006, Michael Crowley, a senior editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, wrote a strongly critical review focusing on Crichton&#x27;s stance on global warming. In the same year, Crichton published the novel &quot;Next&quot;, which contains a minor character named &quot;Mick Crowley&quot;, who is a Yale graduate and a Washington, D.C.–based political columnist. The character was portrayed as a child molester with a small penis. The character does not appear elsewhere in the book. The real Crowley, also a Yale graduate, alleged that by including a similarly named character Crichton had libeled him.

Much criticism was given to Crichton&#x27;s presentation of global warming data and the book&#x27;s portrayal of the global warming debate as a whole. In the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, John Birmingham criticized the book&#x27;s usage of real world research and said it was &quot;boring after the first lecture, but mostly in the plotting... It&#x27;s bad writing and it lets the reader ignore the larger point Crichton is trying to make.&quot; In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Guttridge wrote that the charts and research in the book got &quot;in the way of the thriller elements&quot; and stated the bibliography was more interesting than the plot. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bruce Barcott criticized the novel&#x27;s portrayal of the global warming debate heavily, stating that it only presented one side of the argument.

In the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, Allan Walton gave a mostly favorable review and offered some praise for Crichton&#x27;s work. Walton wrote that Crichton&#x27;s books, &quot;as meticulously researched as they are, have an amusement park feel. It&#x27;s as if the author channels one of his own creations, &quot;Jurassic Park&#x27;s&quot; John Hammond, and spares no expense when it comes to adventure, suspense and, ultimately, satisfaction.&quot;

===Criticism from scientific community===
This novel received criticism from climate scientists, science journalists and environmental groups for inaccuracies and misleading information. Sixteen of 18 US climate scientists interviewed by Knight Ridder said the author was bending scientific data and distorting research.

Several scientists whose research had been referenced in the novel stated that Crichton had distorted it in the novel. Peter Doran, leading author of the &quot;Nature&quot; paper, wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;our results have been misused as &#x27;evidence&#x27; against global warming by Michael Crichton in his novel &quot;State of Fear&quot;&quot;.

Myles Allen wrote: Michael Crichton&#x27;s latest blockbuster, &quot;State of Fear&quot;, is also on the theme of global warming and is, ... likely to mislead the unwary... Although this is a work of fiction, Crichton&#x27;s use of footnotes and appendices is clearly intended to give an impression of scientific authority.The American Geophysical Union states in their newspaper &quot;Eos&quot; &quot;We have seen from encounters with the public how the political use of &quot;State of Fear&quot; has changed public perception of scientists, especially researchers in global warming, toward suspicion and hostility.&quot;

James E. Hansen wrote that Crichton &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem to have the foggiest notion about the science that he writes about.&quot; Jeffrey Masters, chief meteorologist for Weather Underground, writes: &quot;Crichton presents an error-filled and distorted version of the Global Warming science, favoring views of the handful of contrarians that attack the consensus science of the IPCC.&quot;

The Union of Concerned Scientists devote a section of their website to what they describe as misconceptions readers may take away from the book.

== Recognition ==

===US Congress===
Despite being a work of fiction, the book has found use by advocates for climate change denial. For example, US Senator Jim Inhofe, who once pronounced global warming &quot;the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people&quot;, made &quot;State of Fear&quot; &quot;required reading&quot; for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which he chaired from 2003 to 2007, and before which he called Crichton to testify in September 2005.

Al Gore said on March 21, 2007, before a US House committee: &quot;The planet has a fever. If your baby has a fever, you go to the doctor ... if your doctor tells you you need to intervene here, you don&#x27;t say &#x27;Well, I read a science fiction novel that tells me it&#x27;s not a problem. Several commentators interpreted this as a reference to &quot;State of Fear&quot;.

===AAPG 2006 Journalism Award===

The novel received the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) 2006 Journalism Award. AAPG Communications director Larry Nation told the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;It is fiction, but it has the absolute ring of truth&quot;. The presentation of this award has been criticized as a promotion of the politics of the oil industry and for blurring the lines between fiction and journalism. After some controversy within the organization, AAPG has since renamed the award the &quot;Geosciences in the Media&quot; Award.

Daniel P. Schrag, Director of the Center for the Environment at Harvard University, called the award &quot;a total embarrassment&quot; that he said &quot;reflects the politics of the oil industry and a lack of professionalism&quot; on the association&#x27;s part. As for the book, he added &quot;I think it is unfortunate when somebody who has the audience that Crichton has shows such profound ignorance&quot;.

<text>Daniele Luttazzi (; born Daniele Fabbri on 26 January 1961) is an Italian theater actor, writer, satirist, illustrator and singer. His stage name is an homage to musician and actor Lelio Luttazzi. His favourite topics are politics, religion, sex and death.

== Biography ==

Luttazzi was born in Santarcangelo di Romagna, province of Rimini. He began his comic career performing satirical monologues in theatre shows and writing comedy books.
In 1988, his monologue won an award in a comedy contest held at Rome&#x27;s Teatro Sistina.
From 1989, he began working in TV variety shows: &quot;Fate il vostro gioco&quot; (1989, Rai 2), &quot;Banane&quot; (1989, Telemontecarlo), &quot;Magazine 3&quot; (1993, 1994, Rai 3), &quot;Mai Dire Gol&quot; (1996, 1997, Italia 1).
In 1998, he hosts his own late night show, &quot;Barracuda&quot; (Italia 1). Luttazzi did monologues about recent news, interviews with famous showbiz and political personalities, and skits for adult audiences. The same formula was then adopted for his next TV show, called &quot;Satyricon&quot;, aired by the public channel Rai 2 in 2001. In March 2001, Luttazzi interviewed journalist Marco Travaglio about &quot;L&#x27;odore dei soldi&quot; (The Scent of Money), a book on the mysterious origins of Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s wealth: bank Rasini, a bank largely used by Italian mafia for money laundering. The next year, shortly after Berlusconi&#x27;s statement on the &quot;criminal use of public television&quot; made by Luttazzi (see Editto bulgaro), Luttazzi&#x27;s show was cancelled by RAI&#x27;s management. Since then, Luttazzi has been often cited by the European press (i.e. &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;El País&quot;) as proof of Mr. Berlusconi&#x27;s censorship of the opposition.

After television, Luttazzi toured Italy doing theatre shows and wrote books. He returned on TV in 2007 with the new satirical program &quot;Decameron: Politica, Sesso, Religione e Morte&quot; (Decameron: Politics, Sex, Religion and Death) for the private channel La7. Eventually his show was suspended after a controversial joke on journalist Giuliano Ferrara (who was working for La7 too).
2012: Luttazzi wins his legal battle against La7. La7 shall pay Luttazzi 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros.

In 2009 he opens a satire gym on his blog. The authors of &quot;Lercio.it&quot; are trained at his school.

== Controversies ==
In 1994, Susanna Tamaro, bestselling author of &quot;Va&#x27; dove ti porta il cuore&quot;, sued Luttazzi for plagiarism after his parody &quot;Va&#x27; dove ti porta il clito&quot;. Luttazzi won the trial: it was ruled a parody, not plagiarism.

Over the years, several detractors have accused Luttazzi of &quot;plagiarism&quot;. One of the most assiduous was Christian Rocca, a journalist from &quot;Il Foglio&quot; (a conservative newspaper controlled by Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s family): after the first episodes of &quot;Satyricon&quot; (Rai 2, 2001), Rocca accused Luttazzi of copying the David Letterman Show. Luttazzi replied that &quot;Satyricon&quot; was a parody of Letterman. Rocca took things further in 2007, claiming that the joke about Giuliano Ferrara, which led to the closure of the program &quot;Decameron&quot; (La7), was plagiarism from Bill Hicks. In 2012 a judge ruled the joke was not plagiarized and La7 was sentenced to pay 1,200,000 euro as compensation to Luttazzi. 

In January 2008 an anonymous blog listed a series of jokes in English claiming that Luttazzi had &quot;plagiarized&quot; them, and in June 2010, two months after Luttazzi&#x27;s tv monologue on &quot;Raiperunanotte&quot;, an anonymous video was released online comparing jokes by English-speaking comedians with jokes by Luttazzi. Italian newspapers reported the news. Luttazzi replied that that video was defamatory because it did not tell the whole truth: since the opening of his blog (2005) he has invited fans to find the quotes hidden in his monologues, through a game reported on the blog&#x27;s home page, the &quot;treasure hunt&quot;. Luttazzi also calls the allegations &quot;naive&quot;, explaining why those jokes are not &quot;plagiarized&quot;, but &quot;calqued&quot;, which is a fair use of original material. 

Five years before those allegations, Luttazzi wrote that he adds famous comedians&#x27; material to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. Luttazzi calls his ruse &quot;the Lenny Bruce trick&quot; after a similar trick played by his hero, Lenny Bruce. Luttazzi asks his readers to find out the original jokes. He awards a prize to anyone who finds a &quot;nugget&quot;, i.e. a reference to famous jokes: he calls the game &quot;treasure hunt&quot;. Luttazzi&#x27;s blog lists all the comedians and writers quoted in his works.

In 2014, an academic paper explained why Luttazzi&#x27;s jokes are his own and not &quot;plagiarized&quot; ones. The essay positively evaluated Luttazzi&#x27;s rewritings of pre-existing materials, defining them as transcreations, or creative translations that add new meanings to the sources, with the aim of modifying the cultural canon of their country. 

In Luttazzi&#x27;s defense, film director Roberto Faenza quoted Roberto Benigni: Benigni compares Luttazzi&#x27;s copying to the greatest artists&#x27; copying, writers like Virgil, Ovid, Dante, Shakespeare, Buster Keaton, Eduardo De Filippo, and Woody Allen.

<text>Joaquín Botero Vaca (born 10 December 1977) is a Bolivian former professional footballer who played as a striker.

He is the second all-time top goalscorer for the Bolivia national team with 20 goals and was the top goalscorer in world football in the 2002 season, with 49 goals scored for Club Bolívar.

==Club career==
Botero not only played in Bolivia&#x27;s football league, he also played abroad, in the football leagues of Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela.

After scoring 133 goals for Club Bolívar and becoming the club&#x27;s second highest goalscorer of all time behind Luis Fernando Salinas, he left the club to play abroad.

Botero&#x27;s first foreign club was the Mexican team Pumas. In his first season with Pumas, the 2003 Apertura, he scored three goals in 17 games. After scoring another three in nine games in the 2004 Clausura, Botero broke out in the 2004 Apertura, registering 11 goals in 19 games.

In 2006, he joined San Lorenzo de Almagro of the Primera División de Argentina and in 2007 he played for Deportivo Táchira of Venezuela. After an unsuccessful stint in both clubs, Botero returned to Bolívar as a free agent in 2008.

He joined the Mexican team Correcaminos UAT for the Clausura 2009 season, marking his return to Mexico.

In January 2010, he was loaned out to Al Arabi Kuwait for $170,000. He made four appearances and scored three goals.

In 2011, Botero returned to his country to play for San José and Sport Boys Warnes; in the latter, he was the author of two goals that allowed promotion of the team to the First Division of Bolivia for the first time. In this team, he played until his retirement in 2014.

For six years and after his retirement, Botero decided to dedicate himself to personal activities and projects. However, in 2020 he announced his return to the fields, playing for Club Universidad San Francisco de Asís of the Primera A de Potosí in Tupiza, Bolivia.

==International career==
Since 1999, Botero was a regular player for the Bolivia national team, including participation in the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which he played in all three of Bolivia&#x27;s group stage matches, the 2001 Copa América and the 2004 Copa América. 

On 1 April 2009, Botero scored a hat-trick for Bolivia in a historic 6–1 victory over Argentina in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier, Argentina&#x27;s first loss under the recently appointed manager, Diego Maradona. On 15 May 2009, Botero surprisingly announced the end of his era with the national team, putting as an excuse that his motivation &quot;was not there anymore.&quot; 

In his ten years playing for Bolivia, Botero earned a total of 48 caps and scored 20 goals, becoming the highest scorer in the national team&#x27;s history, before being surpassed by Marcelo Moreno in 2020. 

Botero represented his country in 30 FIFA World Cup qualification matches, scoring 16 goals.

<text>Jet CD is a studio album by Japanese pop rock duo Puffy, released on March 31, 1998, through Epic/Sony Records. It features five hit singles that they released between 1996 and 1997, including three of which topped the Japanese Oricon charts.

&quot;Jet&quot; debuted at the number-two on the Oricon Weekly Albums Charts (defeated by Globe&#x27;s third album &quot;Love Again&quot;), and climbed the summit in following week. The album remained there for 16 weeks, becoming their only album to have sold more than 1 million copies. In March 1999, the album won the 13th Gold Disc Awards by the Recording Industry Association of Japan, the prizes conferred on the music recordings which gained outstanding commercial success.

In Japan, the album was simultaneously released on MD (entitled &quot;Jet-MD&quot;). In some Asian territories, it was also released on audio cassette under the alternative title &quot;Jet-Cassette&quot;.

The Japanese edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Jet-CD&quot; as number 76 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums&quot;.

<doc id="1257977" wikidata="Q7628808" url="?curid=1257977" title="Stunting (broadcasting)">
<text>Stunting is a type of publicity stunt in radio broadcasting, where a station—abruptly and often without advance announcement—begins to air content that is seemingly uncharacteristic compared to what is normally played.

Stunting is typically used to generate publicity and audience attention for upcoming changes to a station&#x27;s programming, such as new branding, format, or as a soft launch for a newly-established station. Occasionally, a stunt may be purely intended as publicity or a protest, and not actually result in a major programming change. Stunts often involve a loop of a single song, or an interim format (such as the discography of a specific artist, Christmas music, or a novel theme that would not be viable as a permanent format), which may sometimes include hints towards the station&#x27;s new format or branding.

To a lesser extent, stunting has also been seen on television, most commonly in conjunction with April Fools&#x27; Day, or to emphasize a major programming event being held by a channel.

==Types of radio stunting and noted examples==

===Continuous loop===
A station may stunt by repeating the same song, playlist, or other content on a continuous loop:
* The song(s) in question are commonly a clue towards the incoming format or branding, such as was the case in March 2014 when San Francisco Regional Mexican station KVVF/KVVZ stunted with a loop of &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; by Nelly for three days. This led into the stations&#x27; relaunch as rhythmic contemporary &quot;Hot 105.7&quot;. The stunt notably attracted mainstream media attention, with the hashtag &quot;#nelly1057&quot; being used to discuss the event on Twitter.
** In late June 2022, CKKS-FM in Greater Vancouver similarly faced mainstream media attention when it played a loop of &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; by Rage Against the Machine as part of its transition from hot adult contemporary &quot;Kiss&quot; to modern rock &quot;Sonic&quot;. The loop included kayfabe segments of DJs discussing their repeated playing of the song, and &quot;callers&quot; either requesting &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; or asking for a different song—which led to a false impression that its employees had commandeered the station to protest staffing changes associated with the format change.
* Often the song chosen for the loop does not pertain to either the old or new format:
** In one of the oldest radio stunts recorded, WNOE-AM/New Orleans played &quot;Shtiggy Boom&quot; by The Nuggets nonstop for 58 hours and 45 minutes before the launch of its Top 40 format in early 1955. 
**In 1961, XEAK San Diego/Tijuana played &quot;Mope-itty Mope&quot; by The Bosstones for 72 hours straight before launching one of the first all-news formats in North American radio. 
** In late-April 1994, WMGV/Winneconne stunted with a loop of 21 different versions of the song &quot;Louie Louie&quot; as &quot;Louie 103.9&quot;, before launching a new oldies format on May 3.
** In a reference to the Rickroll meme, the new Toronto radio station CIND-FM played a loop of Rick Astley&#x27;s &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; prior to its official launch as &quot;Indie 88&quot;.
**Linder Radio Group is known for routinely using &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&quot; by Rolf Harris as a filler stunt when changing a format on one of its stations.
* For four days before the July 8, 2012, relaunch of KOKE-FM/Austin — a station which popularized progressive country in the early 1970s, a live recording of Dale Watson&#x27;s &quot;Country My Ass&quot; played in a continuous loop. This example of stunting is notable for the station-specific nature of the song&#x27;s lyrics; Watson re-recorded the song for the occasion, adding a new coda in which he sings, &quot;Now Austin&#x27;s on track, &#x27;cause KOKE-FM&#x27;s back.&quot;
* In May 1990, the staff of Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio station Triple J staged an industrial action, after its news director was suspended for playing a clip of the N.W.A. song &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot; in a segment discussing its subject matter (despite the full song having been played by the station before without incident). During the action, Triple J played another N.W.A. song, &quot;Express Yourself&quot; (whose lyrics criticize censorship of rap music), 82 times in a row. 
** Triple J paid homage to the event during the April 30, 2014 relaunch of digital radio station ABC Dig Music as sister station Double J, which was preceded by a stunt loop of 13 different versions of &quot;Express Yourself&quot; (including the original recording, and covers of the song by Australian musicians).
* WJMP/Kent, OH, in a protest over the Major League Baseball players&#x27; strike, continuously played two versions of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; sunrise-to-sunset (the station operated only during daytime hours), for two months (and 57,161 total plays) from August to October 1994. The stunt merited WJMP an entry in the &quot;Guinness Book of Sports Records&quot;.
* In April 2012, WDKN/Philadelphia—after its sale by Family Radio to Merlin Media—stunted with a loop of &quot;It&#x27;s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)&quot; by R.E.M., as a jab at a failed prediction by the station&#x27;s former owner Harold Camping that the Rapture would take place on May 21, 2011. The stunt later shifted to nonstop airings of &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; as &quot;Hannity @ 106.9&quot; (with reruns of previous episodes aired when the show wasn&#x27;t live), before launching its new news/talk format &quot;iQ 106.9&quot; (which featured &quot;Hannity&quot; and other conservative talk hosts).
** Later that year, in honor of the alleged Mayan apocalypse, modern rock station CFEX-FM/Calgary stunted with a loop of &quot;It&#x27;s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)&quot; on December 21, 2012 with no change in format. The song was interspersed with &quot;Apocalypse Survival Tips&quot; and &quot;Get to Know a Mayan&quot; sketches.
* Prior to its August 26, 2019 launch of a sports talk format affiliated with Fox Sports Radio, WDAS/Philadelphia stunted with a loop of the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot; theme music over the preceding weekend. The change in format was announced in advance of the flip.
*In a non-music example, the launch of Black Information Network—a chain of iHeartMedia news radio stations targeting African Americans—featured its initial stations playing a loop of speeches by prominent African Americans, mixed with sweepers promoting the launch date, and containing the tagline &quot;Our side of the story is about to be told.&quot;
*Prior to the September 30, 2021 launch of an adult hits format, AAA station KTHX-FM in Reno stunted with instrumental jazz music mixed with sweepers stating that the station was &quot;on hold&quot;.

===Temporary formats===
Occasionally a station dropping an old format will stunt with a transitional format, either containing hints towards the new format (such as songs referencing its new branding, and artists who may be included in the eventual format), or having little to do with it. This can include songs based on specific themes (such as a single musician), or novelties that would not be viable as a permanent format. In some cases (sometimes referred to as a &quot;wheel of formats&quot;), a station may cycle between multiple formats during the stunt until the new, permanent format launches.

* As part of its February 1996 transition from country music to rhythmic contemporary WKTU, New York City&#x27;s WYNY carried simulcasts of programming from several of its Evergreen Media sister stations, including WRCX/Chicago (with morning host Mancow Muller informing his expanded audience that there would be &quot;no more goat-ropin&#x27; music&quot; on WYNY, making jokes directed towards competitors WHTZ and WXRK, and pulling a prank on the latter&#x27;s morning host Howard Stern), KKBT/Los Angeles, WLUP/Chicago, KIOI/San Francisco, and WXKS/Boston.
* In 2006, after its sale to new owners, KFYE in Kingsburg, California, dropped its contemporary Christian music programming for a stunt format it dubbed &quot;Porn Radio&quot;, featuring songs with sexually-suggestive lyrics, and songs edited to include moaning sounds; on August 3, 2006, the station emerged as rhythmic adult contemporary &quot;Sexy 106.3&quot;. The station would hold a second publicity stunt in March 2007, promoting that the station would &quot;say goodbye&quot; on March 30; the ensuing announcement was a change in call letters to KSXE to match the &quot;Sexy&quot; moniker. 
** WLYK in Cape Vincent, New York (serving Kingston, Ontario) pulled a similar stunt when it transitioned to new operators in February 2023, replacing its outgoing &quot;Kiss&quot; CHR format with &quot;The Pole&quot; (a pun of the name of one of the station&#x27;s new owners, Jon Pole)—a variety format which played music that one would hear at a strip club. The stunt notably attracted the attention of an actual strip club in Kingston. The station emerged as adult hits &quot;Lake FM&quot; on March 17, 2023.
* In May 2009, WSKS in Utica, New York, announced that due to &quot;financial constraints&quot;, its contemporary hit radio (CHR) format would be replaced by a beautiful music format similar to what was broadcast on sister station WUTQ. The ensuing programming included staged scenes of station employees protesting the changes. The &quot;new format,&quot; however, lasted for only two hours before WSKS management came clean, restored the CHR format, and confirmed the stunt was a way to promote the station&#x27;s new lineup.
* As a publicity stunt for the program by local broadcaster Global, Toronto radio station CIRR-FM (which usually broadcasts a CHR format targeting the LGBT community) temporarily rebranded as &quot;Glee FM&quot; on April 12, 2010, adding music from the U.S. musical comedy-drama series &quot;Glee&quot; to its playlist. On August 16, 2010, British radio station &quot;Oxford&#x27;s FM 107.9&quot; held its own &quot;Glee FM&quot; stunt, leading into its August 18 relaunch as &quot;Glide FM&quot;.
* Over Memorial Day weekend in 2010, WJZX-FM/Milwaukee, Wisconsin, stunted as &quot;Tiger 106.9&quot;, featuring songs about cheating (in reference to an infidelity scandal involving golfer Tiger Woods). The station was expected to change to a top 40 format with the new call letters WNQW—with the new calls suggesting that its branding would involve the name &quot;Now&quot;. However, competing station WQBW abruptly moved to introduce the same format and branding as &quot;97.3 Radio Now&quot;, preventing WJZX from using the name. The station continued airing temporary formats (such as patriotic music and The Beatles&#x27; discography in alphabetical order), before settling on a permanent format in June 2010, as classic country station WZBK-FM (the station eventually adopted a rhythmic top 40 format in September 2012 as &quot;Energy 106.9&quot;). 
* In 2011, WWWN/Chicago and WEMP/New York—which had recently been sold to Merlin Media—transitioned from alternative rock to all-news radio as &quot;FM News&quot;. As a transitional format, both stations aired a format branded as &quot;FM New&quot;, which featured adult contemporary music interspersed with news, traffic, and weather updates from personalities who would serve under the new &quot;FM News&quot; formats.
* Some stations have held temporary stunts focused on specific artists in honor of major concert tours making stops in their markets, with KSON in San Diego briefly rebranding as &quot;The All-New George-FM&quot; in January 2014 ahead of the January 31 date on George Strait&#x27;s farewell tour The Cowboy Rides Away (promoting an increased amount of George Strait music, and on-air giveaways of merchandise and concert tickets)&quot;,&quot; and San Francisco&#x27;s KBAY announcing that it would temporarily rebrand as &quot;Tay Bay&quot; and play all-Taylor Swift music on July 28 and 29, 2023, in honor of The Eras Tour.
* On October 8, 2014, KROI/Houston ended its all-news format and began stunting as &quot;B92&quot;, playing only music by Houston-native Beyoncé. The stunt led into its relaunch as classic hip-hop &quot;Boom 92&quot;.
* KEGY/San Diego used an unbranded mainstream rock format as part of its transition from CHR to a new hot talk-oriented format in 2018. The stunt&#x27;s playlist featured Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; at the top of each hour, which teased its eventual branding as &quot;The Machine&quot;.
* Multiple stations in the United States and Canada have stunted with Chinese music under the branding &quot;Kung Pao&quot;, such as KDOG (which led into a flip to classic hits), WVHT (which led into its re-launch as CHR &quot;Hot 100&quot;), and CIGM (which led into its re-launch as CHR &quot;Hot 93.5&quot;).
* In connection with President Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency and the 2016, 2020, and 2024 presidential elections in the United States, multiple radio stations have stunted with songs directly related to both his presidency and campaigns under either both &quot;Donald&quot; and &quot;Trump&quot; brandings, such as WVWF (when it briefly stunted as &quot;Trump 105.1&quot; and played songs that aimed directly to his campaign such as Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;—in referenced to his border wall—in September 2016), and Hartford conservative talk station WDRC (which temporarily rebranded as &quot;Trump 103.3&quot; to promote its new FM translator W277DT, before returning to its normal &quot;Talk of Connecticut&quot; branding).
*In July 2021, Denver CHR station KPTT briefly aired all-Britney Spears music as &quot;Free Britney Radio&quot; (in reference to the Britney Spears conservatorship dispute) before re-launching its format as &quot;Hits 95.7&quot;.

===Christmas music===
The popular practice of radio stations playing all-Christmas music during the lead-up to (and occasionally the week after) Christmas Day has sometimes been used by stations as a transition period between formats. However, the ensuing format change can still occur before the end of the holiday season. Christmas music is sometimes used as a more blatant stunt format outside of the holiday season (in a similar spirit to ironic &quot;Christmas in July&quot; promotions). 

*On November 17, 2017, Seattle country station KMPS flipped to Christmas music in defense of its former competitor and now-sister station, KKWF, following the merger of CBS Radio with KKWF&#x27;s owner Entercom. While ostensibly for the holiday season, KMPS abruptly ended the all-Christmas programming on December 4, 2017, and flipped to soft adult contemporary. The following year, Entercom&#x27;s Detroit station WDZH performed a similar flip from an outgoing CHR format to soft AC, with its transition period having lasted only three days.
* In April 2008, Saskatoon&#x27;s new radio station CFWD-FM stunted with Christmas music as &quot;Santa FM&quot; prior to its official launch as CHR &quot;Wired 96.3&quot;. In December 2012, the station used Christmas music to transition from CHR to adult hits. 
** In April 2011, its Edmonton sister station CKEA-FM used a weekend of Christmas music to soft launch its new adult contemporary format &quot;Lite 95.7&quot;, promoting the new station&#x27;s intent to play all-Christmas music during the holiday season. 
* Duluth&#x27;s WEBC used Christmas music as a transitional format in September 2015 when flipping from sports talk to classic rock, with the station initially implying that the Christmas format was permanent.
* Richmond&#x27;s WURV aired 12 hours of &quot;inappropriately early&quot; Christmas music on October 7, 2015, as a satire of Christmas creep and stations trying to be the first in their market to play Christmas music. 
** WURV&#x27;s sister station WJSR would notably conduct an unusually-long Christmas music stunt lasting from October 13, 2020 to March 4, 2021; the station had originally stunted with snippets of songs as &quot;Short Attention Span Radio&quot; from October 1. After just over five months of stunting in total, WJSR flipped to classic hits &quot;Awesome 100.9&quot; on March 4, 2021.
* In October 2018, KBFF in Portland, Oregon briefly stunted with a Halloween-themed format as &quot;eviL 95.5&quot; (an inversion of its typical branding &quot;Live 95.5&quot;), as a parody of all-Christmas formats.

=== Other ===
* On January 7, 2019, country station KSED/Sedona began stunting with a speaking clock counting down to 6:00 a.m. on January 14, 2019. The stunt—which led into a rebranding with no change in format—prompted the Flagstaff Police Department to issue a statement clarifying that, despite concerns from residents, this was a promotional event with no harm intended.
* In 2018 and 2020, iHeartMedia used multiple stunts as part of its retooling and relaunch of CHR station KBKS-FM in Seattle. 
** In late-October 2018 approaching Halloween, the station dropped its on-air personalities, and began to air promos and sweepers implicating the end of its existing &quot;Kiss&quot; format. Later, the station began to interrupt songs with a demonic voiceover stating that &quot;&quot;Kiss&quot; is dead&quot;, and air promos teasing an announcement on October 31. At that time, the station announced that it would revamp its on-air lineup with no change in format, explaining the prior stunt by stating that they were &quot;dead serious&quot; about finding &quot;Seattle&#x27;s Funniest Person&quot; to join its morning show (as part of an accompanying contest). 
** In July 2020, KBKS announced that it had hired Jubal Fresh—the former co-host of KQMV&#x27;s nationally-syndicated morning show &quot;Brooke &amp; Jubal&quot;—to host a new morning show on the station. On August 3, 2020, the station temporarily rebranded as &quot;Jubal 106.1&quot; to promote the impending launch of &quot;The Jubal Show&quot;, after which it adopted its new branding—&quot;Hits 106.1&quot;—on August 20 to coincide with its premiere.
* From March 27 to late-May 2020, CHR station WFLC/Miami, &quot;Hits 97.3&quot;, branded as &quot;Quarantine Radio&quot; in reference to the COVID-19 pandemic and Florida&#x27;s stay-at-home order. The station maintained its existing format, but added commercial-free hours of dance music mixes (&quot;Fit Mixes&quot;) at 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. daily. In late-May, the &quot;Quarantine Radio&quot; branding was dropped and the station promoted itself as being &quot;under construction&quot;, before re-launching the &quot;Hits&quot; format on June 3 with a new on-air lineup.
* On December 21, 2024, after WQRR in Tuscaloosa, Alabama dropped its alternate rock format, the station began stunting as &quot;Radio 101.7&quot;, running loops first of solely Taylor Swift songs, then changing to a loop of Michael Jackson songs on the 22nd. Between both days, the station initially framed the stunt as the station being &quot;hacked&quot; by Russian broadcasters (to the point that the Swift portion of the stunt includes covers of her songs translated to Russian). The initial part of the stunt would earn the station a surge of attention on social media, as local and international listeners claimed the move was connected to the then-recent reports of unmanned drones flying across various cities in the United States.

==On television==
Cartoon Network has broadcast its share of stunts over the years, many on April Fools&#x27; Day. On April 1, 1997, the network aired a stunt where it had purportedly been taken over by Screwy Squirrel, and subsequently broadcast the Screwy Squirrel cartoon &quot;Happy-Go-Nutty&quot; for 12 hours straight. Numerous complaints were received about this particular event, generally fielded by Cartoon Network&#x27;s cable providers, who had been left in the dark about the stunt. Later April Fools&#x27; Day stunts on Cartoon Network have included an 11 hour &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; marathon in place of a scheduled &quot;Chowder&quot; marathon on April 1, 2009, and 14 hours of programming edited to have googly eyes on April 1, 2017.

Adult Swim has held a number of their own April Fools&#x27; programming stunts, such as promoting a television premiere of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot; before its theatrical release (but displaying it in a comically-small window over regularly-scheduled programming), airings of the cult Tommy Wiseau film &quot;The Room&quot;, episodes of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; redubbed by children and edited to be family-friendly (&quot;Adult Swim Junior&quot;), a one-off revival of Cartoon Network&#x27;s former action and anime block Toonami (which later relaunched under the auspices of Adult Swim by popular demand), an airing of Toonami with programs in their original Japanese audio with subtitles (including Masaaki Yuasa&#x27;s 2004 experimental film &quot;Mind Game&quot;) rather than an English dub, and preceding an announced season 2 premiere of &quot;Smiling Friends&quot; with airings of several season 1 episodes recreated with puppets. The stunts have sometimes included unannounced previews and premieres of new and existing series, such as additional episodes of &quot;Perfect Hair Forever&quot; after its supposed series finale, the third season premiere of &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, and an unannounced world premiere of the first episode of &quot;FLCL&quot;″s third season before its second season had even premiered in the U.S. yet.

For 35 days in early-1998, Birmingham, Alabama&#x27;s CBS affiliate WBMG—which had recently been acquired by Media General—stunted during some of the timeslots of its local newscasts with a clock counting down to a major relaunch of the station and its fledgling news department on February 5.

Nick Jr. Too, a sister to the British Nick Jr. channel, has occasionally aired long-term marathons of &quot;Peppa Pig&quot;, during which it has branded as &quot;Nick Jr. Peppa&quot;. In a similar manner, Sky Sports has also temporarily rebranded some of its channels to devote them specifically to certain major events, such as The Ashes series in cricket (Sky Sports Ashes), the PDC World Darts Championship (Sky Sports Darts; in 2015, this used the Sky Sports F1 channel, since Formula One was in its off-season), and golf&#x27;s Open Championship (Sky Sports The Open). In January 2019, Sky Sports Action was temporarily renamed &quot;Sky Sports USA&quot;, with programming focusing on the National Basketball Association (coinciding with the playing of the NBA Global Games series in London), and the National Football League playoffs and Super Bowl LIII.

At least three networks have used stunting-type events prior to their formal launches: G4, for example, aired a 7 day long game of &quot;Pong&quot; before its formal debut on April 24, 2002. This stunt would later be referenced by the network&#x27;s sign-off December 31, 2014, as well as in the video announcing its 2021 return. MLB Network aired a continuous loop of baseball highlights and promos as a &quot;soft launch&quot; in the weeks before its formal debut on January 1, 2009. Canada&#x27;s Sun News Network employed an on-screen countdown clock graphic in the hours before its April 18, 2011, launch.

Since 2017, one of ESPN&#x27;s networks has stunted as &quot;ESPN8: The Ocho&quot; on or near August 8 (8/8), carrying a marathon of programming featuring sporting events and competitions that are either obscure or unconventional, such as chess boxing, disc golf, dodgeball, esports, Highland games, kabaddi, lawn mower racing, mini-golf, and roller derby. The stunt pays tribute to a fictitious ESPN channel of the same name portrayed in the 2004 sports comedy film &quot;&quot; (nicknamed &quot;The Ocho&quot;, in reference to ESPN2 being nicknamed &quot;The Deuce&quot; on launch), which carries coverage of competitions that are &quot;almost a sport&quot;. The stunt was originally held on ESPNU—a channel that normally carries college sports events during the academic year, but moved to ESPN2 beginning in 2018. The film itself has sometimes been screened as part of this lineup as well.

<text>Royal elections in Poland (Polish: &quot;wolna elekcja&quot;, lit. &quot;free election&quot;) were the elections of individual kings, rather than dynasties, to the Polish throne. Based on traditions dating to the very beginning of the Polish statehood, strengthened during the Piast and Jagiellon dynasties, they reached their final form in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth period between 1572 and 1791. The &quot;free election&quot; was abolished by the Constitution of 3 May 1791, which established a constitutional-parliamentary monarchy.

== Evolution ==


The tradition of electing the country&#x27;s ruler, which occurred either when there was no clear heir to the throne, or to confirm the heir&#x27;s appointment, dates to the very beginning of Polish statehood. Legends survive of the 9th-century election of the legendary founder of the first Polish royal family, Piast the Wheelwright of the Piast dynasty, and similar voting of his son, Siemowit (that would place a Polish ruler&#x27;s vote a century before the earliest Icelandic ones by the Althing). Still, sources for that time are very sparse, and it is hard to estimate whether those elections were more than a formality. The election privilege, exercised during the gatherings known as &quot;wiec&quot;, was usually limited to the most powerful nobles (magnates) or officials, and was heavily influenced by local traditions and strength of the ruler.

Traditions diverged in different regions of Poland during the period of fragmentation of Poland. In the Duchy of Masovia, the hereditary principle dominated, but in the Seniorate Province, elections became increasingly important. In the other provinces both elements mixed together. By the 12th or 13th century, the &quot;wiec&quot; institution limited participation to high-ranking nobles and officials. The nationwide &quot;wiec&quot; gatherings of officials in 1306 and 1310 can be seen as a precursor of the general sejm (Polish parliament).

The elections reinforced the empowerment of the electorate (the nobility), as the contender to the throne would increasingly consider issuing promises that he undertook to fulfil in the event of a successful election. Wenceslaus II of Bohemia made the first of such undertakings (the Litomyšl Privilege) in 1291. Nonetheless, for most of the Piast dynasty, electors customarily endorsed rulers from that dynasty, in accordance with hereditary descent. The Piast dynasty came to an end with the death without an heir of the last of the Polish Piasts of the main line, Casimir III the Great, in 1370.

In a milestone for the process of the free elections, Casimir&#x27;s nephew, Louis I of Hungary, became king after the agreement between him, Casimir III the Great and the Polish nobility (Privilege of Buda). Louis had no sons, which created another dilemma for the succession of the Polish throne. In an attempt to secure the throne of Poland for his line, he gathered the nobles and sought their approval to have one of his daughters retained as the queen regnant of Poland in exchange for the Privilege of Koszyce (1374).

The next election of a Polish king had occurred in 1386, with the selection of Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila), Grand Duke of Lithuania, as the first king of Poland&#x27;s second dynasty. The electors chose Władysław II Jagiełło as king, and he married a daughter of Louis I, Jadwiga of Poland, but had no promise that his dynasty would continue on the throne. He would need to issue more privileges to the nobility to secure the guarantee that upon his death, one of his sons would inherit. The royal council chose the candidates, and the delegates of nobility and towns confirmed them during the sejm. The principle of election continued in effect throughout the nearly two centuries of the Jagiellon Dynasty, but just as in Piast times, it actually amounted to mere confirmation of the incoming heir.

One could describe the monarchy of Poland at that time as &quot;the hereditary monarchy with a[n] elective legislature.&quot; A major reason was the desire on the part of Polish nobility to retain the Polish–Lithuanian union, and the Jagiellon dynasty were the hereditary rulers of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Nonetheless, the pretense of having a choice by elections remained important for the nobility, and when in 1530 Sigismund I the Old attempted to secure the hereditary throne for his 10-year-old son, there was a political crisis, and the Polish parliament, the sejm, ruled that a new king could be chosen during the life of his predecessor (that became known in the Polish politics as the &quot;vivente rege&quot;).

In 1572, Poland&#x27;s Jagiellon dynasty became extinct upon the death, without a successor, of King Sigismund II Augustus. During the ensuing interregnum, anxiety for the safety of the Commonwealth eventually led to agreements among the political classes that pending election of a new king, the Roman Catholic Primate of Poland would exercise supreme authority, acting as &quot;interrex&quot; (from the Latin); and that special &quot;hooded&quot; confederations (Polish: &quot;konfederacje kapturowe&quot;, named after the hoods traditionally worn by their members) of nobility would assume power in each the country&#x27;s regions. Most importantly, however, the Poles decided that they would choose the next king by election, and they finally established the terms of such election at a convocation sejm (&quot;sejm konwokacyjny&quot;) in 1573. On the initiative of nobles from Southern Poland, supported by the future Great Crown Chancellor and hetman Jan Zamoyski, all male szlachta (nobles) who assembled for the purpose would become electors. Any Catholic nobleman could stand for election, but in practice, only rich and powerful members of foreign dynasties or Commonwealth magnates had a serious chance for consideration. With the election of the first king of the &quot;free election&quot; period, the elections assumed their final form, which would remain stable for the next two centuries. These elections would be solidified in the Henrician Articles, passed by the first elected king, Henry of Valois.

Particularly in the late 17th and 18th centuries, the political instability from the elections led numerous political writers to suggest major changes to the system: most notably, to restrict the elections to Polish candidates only (that became known as the &quot;election of a Piast&quot;), as many kings were from foreign nations, meaning the Polish election became a multi-national struggle. The elections also often saw the Polish nobility attempt to elect a weak and controllable monarch, and there were large amounts of corruption, particularly related to bribes. None of the projects at reforming the Polish election came into force, however. The Constitution of 3 May 1791 eliminated the practice of electing individuals to the monarchy.

==Procedure==
Three special sejms handled the process of the royal election in the interregnum period:
* Convocation sejm (&quot;Sejm konwokacyjny&quot;), called upon a death or abdication of a king by the Primate of Poland. Deputies would focus on establishing the dates and any special rules for the election (in particular, preparation of pacta conventa, bills of privileges to be sworn by the king) and on screening the candidates. It was to last two weeks.
* Election sejm (&quot;Sejm elekcyjny&quot;), when the nobility voted for the candidate to the throne. It was open to all members of the nobility and so it often had many more attendees than a regular sejm. The exact numbers of attendees were never recorded and are estimated to vary from 10,000 to over 100,000; the usual numbers tended to be towards the lower end of the scale, around 10,000-15,000. Subsequently, the voting could last days (in 1573, it was recorded that it took four days). The entire sejm was to last six weeks. To handle the increased numbers, it would be held in Wola, then a village near Warsaw. Royal candidates themselves would be barred from attending the sejm but were allowed to send representatives. Attending nobles would have discussed their preferences before attending the election sejm, during local sejmiks sessions, but often, matters came to a heated debate that would last days and could lead to fights and battles. Norman Davies notes that &quot;in 1764, when only thirteen electors were killed, it was said that the Election was unusually quiet.&quot;
* Coronation sejm (&quot;Sejm koronacyjny&quot;), held in Kraków, where the coronation ceremony was traditionally held by the Primate, who relinquished his powers to the chosen king. It was to last two weeks. The king-elect undertook various ceremonies and formalities, such as swearing an oath to uphold the &quot;pacta conventa&quot; and the Henrician Articles. The coronation itself would take place in the Wawel Cathedral. The two exceptions were the Warsaw coronations of Stanisław I Leszczyński and Stanisław August Poniatowski (reigned as Stanisław II Augustus), both of which took place in Warsaw.

==Influence==
The elections played a major role in curtailing the power of the monarch and so were a significant factor in preventing the rise of an absolute monarchy, with a strong executive, in the Commonwealth. Most tellingly, one of the provisions of the pacta conventa included the right of revolution (rokosz) for the nobility if it considered the king not to be adhering to the laws of the state.

While seemingly introducing a very democratic procedure, free elections, in practice, contributed to the inefficiency of the Commonwealth&#x27;s government. The elections, open to all nobility, meant that magnates, who could exert significant control on the masses of poorer nobility, could exert much influence over the elections.

The elections also encouraged foreign dynasties&#x27; meddling in Polish internal politics. On several occasions, if the magnates could not come to an agreement, two candidates would proclaim themselves the king and civil wars erupted (most notably, the War of the Polish Succession of 1733–1738, and the War of the Polish Succession of 1587–1588, with smaller scale conflicts in 1576 and 1697). By the last years of the Commonwealth, royal elections grew to be seen as a source of conflicts and instability; Lerski describes them as having &quot;become a symbol of anarchy&quot;.

==List of elections==
In the period of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, 10 elections (composed of the convocation, election and coronation sejmik) were held in Poland, resulting in the elevation of 11 kings.

<doc id="1258015" wikidata="Q5040027" url="?curid=1258015" title="Carl DeFaria">
<text>Carl DeFaria (born ) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003 and was a cabinet minister in the government of Ernie Eves.

==Background==
DeFaria has a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto and a law degree from Osgoode Hall. He worked in criminal and constitutional law before entering political life. DeFaria was also an instructor of the Bar Admission Course for the Law Society of Upper Canada. His wife, Riina DeFaria, has also campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada on two occasions.

==Politics==
He ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1990, as the Tory candidate in the working-class riding of Cambridge. He finished a distant third, behind prominent New Democrat Mike Farnan and a Liberal candidate.

DeFaria then ran for the federal Progressive Conservative Party in the federal election of 1993 in Mississauga East, placing a distant third, this time behind Liberal Albina Guarnieri and a Reform Party candidate.

He was elected in Mississauga East by more than 6,000 votes over his Liberal opponent in the provincial election of 1995, amid a Tory sweep of the Mississauga region. A moderate, DeFaria remained a backbencher during the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris.

DeFaria was re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating his Liberal opponent by more than 4,000 votes. He supported Ernie Eves to succeed Harris as party leader in 2002, and was named Minister of Citizenship with responsibility for Seniors on April 15, 2002.

In late 2002, he was criticized by some for issuing a pamphlet of Christmas songs entitled &quot;Sing Along With Carl&quot;. One of the works was a Stephen Foster song from 1851, which referred to blacks as &quot;darkies&quot;. DeFaria quickly apologized, claiming that he had not scrutinized the pamphlet carefully enough before its release.

In the provincial election of 2003, he lost to Liberal candidate Peter Fonseca (a well-known Olympic athlete) by about 3,000 votes, amid a general regional decline in Tory support.

==Later life==
He ran for the Mississauga South federal Conservative nomination in 2004, losing to Phil Green.

In 2005, DeFaria was appointed director of the Serious Crimes Unit by Timorese President Xanana Gusmão. His task was to windup war crimes probes before the UN pullout on May 20, 2005. He faced some criticism that the UN was leaving before the war crime trial process was finished. He said, &quot;Obviously, we would like to have all of the people who have been indicted brought to justice. It will be up to the Timorese government. I&#x27;m sure if they decide to pursue it, they will have a lot of support from the international community.&quot;

In the 2006 federal election, DeFaria ran for the Conservative Party of Canada, finishing second to longtime Liberal incumbent Albina Guarnieri.

<doc id="1258023" wikidata="Q434419" url="?curid=1258023" title="Minh Mạng">
<text>Minh Mạng (), also known as Minh Mệnh (, , lit. &quot;the bright favour of Heaven&quot;; 25 May 1791 – 20 January 1841; born Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, also known as Nguyễn Phúc Kiểu) was the second emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty of Vietnam, reigning from 14 February 1820 until his death, on 20 January 1841. He was the fourth son of Emperor Gia Long, whose eldest son, Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh, had died in 1801. He was well known for his opposition to French involvement in Vietnam, completing the final Vietnamese conquest of Champa, temporary annexation of Cambodia, and his rigid Confucian orthodoxy.

==Early years==

Born Nguyễn Phúc Đảm at Gia Định in the middle of the Second Tây Sơn – Nguyễn War, Minh Mạng was the fourth son of lord Nguyễn Phúc Ánh – future Emperor Gia Long. His mother was Gia Long&#x27;s second wife Trần Thị Đang, later known as the empress Thuận Thiên. At the age of three, under the effect of a written agreement made by Gia Long with his first wife the Empress Thừa Thiên, she took Đảm in and raised him as her own son.
Following Thừa Thiên&#x27;s death in 1814, it was supposed that her grandson, Crown Prince Cảnh&#x27;s eldest son Mỹ Đường, would be responsible for conducting the funeral. Gia Long however, brought out the agreement to insist that Phúc Đảm, as Thừa Thiên&#x27;s son, should be the one fulfilling the duty. Despite opposition from mandarins, such as Nguyễn Văn Thành, Gia Long was decisive with his selection.

In 1816, Gia Long appointed Đảm as his heir apparent. After the ceremony, Crown Prince Đảm moved to Thanh Hòa Palace and started assisting his father in processing documents and discussing country issues.

Gia Long&#x27;s death coincided with the re-establishment of the Paris Missionary Society&#x27;s operations in Vietnam, which had closed in 1792 during the chaos of the power struggle between Gia Long and the Tây Sơn brothers before Vietnam was unified. In the early years of Minh Mạng&#x27;s government, the most serious challenge came from one of his father&#x27;s most trusted lieutenants and a national hero in Vietnam, Lê Văn Duyệt, who had led the Nguyễn forces to victory at Qui Nhơn in 1801 against the Tây Sơn dynasty and was made regent in the south by Gia Long with full freedom to rule and deal with foreign powers.

==Policy towards missionaries==
In February 1825, Minh Mạng banned missionaries from entering Vietnam. French vessels entering Vietnamese harbours were ordered to be searched with extra care. All entries were to be watched &quot;lest some masters of the European religion enter furtively, mix with the people and spread darkness in the kingdom.&quot; In an imperial edict, Christianity was described as the &quot;perverse European&quot; (practice) and accused of &quot;corrupting the hearts of men&quot;.

Between 1833 and 1838, seven missionaries were sentenced to death, amongst them Pierre Borie, Joseph Marchand, and Jean-Charles Cornay. He first attempted to stifle the spread of Christianity by attempting to isolate Catholic priests and missionaries from the populace. He asserted that he had no French interpreters after Chaigneau&#x27;s departure and summoned the French clergy to Hue and appointed them as mandarins of high rank to woo them from their proselytising. This worked until a priest, Father Regereau, entered the country and began missionary work. Following the edict which forbade further entry of missionaries into Vietnam, arrests of clerics began. After strong lobbying by Duyệt, the governor of Cochin China, and a close confidant of Gia Long and Pigneau de Behaine, Minh Mạng agreed to release the priests on the condition that they congregate at Đà Nẵng and return to France. Some of them obeyed the orders, but others disobeyed the order upon being released, and returned to their parishes and resumed preaching. 
==Isolationist foreign policy==
Minh Mạng continued and intensified his father&#x27;s isolationist and conservative Confucian policies. His father had rebuffed a British delegation in 1804 proposing that Vietnam be opened to trade; the delegation&#x27;s gifts were not accepted and turned away. At the time, Vietnam was of no interest to the European powers, since most of the continent was engaged in the Napoleonic Wars. Nevertheless, Napoleon had seen Vietnam as a strategically important objective in the Anglo-French power struggle in Asia, as he felt that it would make an ideal base from which to contest the East India Company&#x27;s foothold in the Indian subcontinent. With the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy and the final exile of Napoleon in 1815, the military scene in Europe quieted and French interest in Vietnam was revived. Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau, one of the volunteers of Pigneau de Behaine who had helped Gia Long in his quest for power, had become a mandarin and continued to serve Minh Mạng, upon whose ascension, Chaigneau and his colleagues were treated more distantly. He eventually left in November 1824. In 1825, he was appointed as French consul to Vietnam after returning to his homeland to visit his family after more than a quarter of a century in Asia. Upon his return, Minh Mạng received him coldly. The policy of isolationism soon saw Vietnam fall further behind the pace of technology and become more vulnerable to outside encroachment as political stability returned to continental Europe, allowing European powers free hand to once again direct their attention towards increasing their influence in Asia. With his Confucian orthodoxy, Minh Mạng shunned all Western influence and ideas as hostile and avoided all contact. 

In 1819, Lieutenant John White of the United States Navy was the first American to make contact with Vietnam, arriving in Saigon. Minh Mạng was willing to sign a contract, but only to purchase artillery, firearms, uniforms and books. White was of the opinion that the deal was not sufficiently advantageous and nothing was implemented. In 1821, a trade agreement from Louis XVIII was turned away, with Minh Mạng indicating that no special deal would be offered to any country. That same year, East India Company agent John Crawfurd made another attempt at contact, but was allowed to disembark only in the northern ports of Tonkin; he gained no agreements, but concluded relations with France posed no threat to Company trade. In 1822, the French frigate &quot;La Cleopatre&quot; visited Tourane (present day Đà Nẵng). Her captain was to pay his respects to Minh Mạng, but was greeted with a symbolic dispatch of troops as though an invasion had been expected. In 1824 Minh Mạng rejected the offer of an alliance from Burma against Siam, a common enemy of both countries. In 1824 Henri Baron de Bougainville was sent by Louis XVIII to Vietnam with the stated mission &quot;of peace and protection of commerce. Upon arriving in Tourane in 1825, it was not allowed ashore. The royal message was turned away on the pretext that there was nobody able to translate it. It was assumed that the snub was related to an attempt by Bougainville to smuggle ashore a Catholic missionary from the Missions étrangères de Paris. Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau&#x27;s nephew, Eugène Chaigneau, was sent to Vietnam in 1826 as the intended consul but was forced to leave the country without taking up his position.

Further fruitless attempts to start a commercial deal were led by de Kergariou in 1827 and Admiral Laplace in 1831. Another effort by Chaigneau in 1829 also failed. In 1831 another French envoy was turned away. Vietnam under Minh Mạng was the first East Asian country with whom the United States sought foreign relations. President Andrew Jackson tried twice to contact Minh Mạng, sending Edmund Roberts in 1832, and Consul Joseph Balestier in 1836, to no avail. In 1837 and 1838, &quot;La bonite&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Artémise&quot; were ordered to land in Tourane to attempt to gauge the situation in Vietnam with respect to missionary work. Both were met with hostility and communication was prevented. Later, in 1833 and 1834, a war with Siam was fought over control of Cambodia which for the preceding century had been reduced to impotence and had fallen under the control of its two neighbours.

In 1824, a Burmese envoy dispatched by the Burmese king, presenting a proposal of a Burmese–Vietnamese alliance against Siam, which was immediately declined by Minh Mang. Minh Mang saw a risky war against Siam, the former ally, might have jeopardized Vietnamese hegemony in Cambodia, which had been acquired by his father Gia Long. Second, he had carefully watched the British seizure of Singapore in 1819 and who were waging war in Burma, thus he saw Britain as the new rising threat, and urged that the Chakri dynasty of Siam should focus alongside Burma in their struggle against the British expansion.

After Vietnam under Gia Long gained control over Cambodia in the early 19th century, a Vietnamese-approved monarch was installed. Minh Mạng was forced to put down a Siamese attempt to regain control of the vassal, as well as an invasion of southern Vietnam which coincided with rebellion by Lê Văn Khôi. The Siamese planned the invasion to coincide with the rebellion, putting enormous strain on the Nguyễn armies. Eventually, Minh Mạng&#x27;s forces were able to repel the invasion, as well as the revolt in Saigon, and he reacted to Western encroachment by blaming Christianity and showing hostility, leading to the European powers&#x27; asserting that intervention was needed to protect their missionaries. This resulted in missed opportunities to avert the colonisation of Vietnam through having friendly relations, since strong opposition was raised in France against an invasion, due to the costs of such a venture. After the outbreak of the First Opium War in 1839, Minh Mạng attempted to build an alliance with European powers by sending a delegation of two lower rank mandarins and two interpreters in 1840. They were received in Paris by Prime Minister Marshal Soult and the Commerce Minister, but they were shunned by King Louis-Philippe. This came after the Society of Foreign Missions and the Holy See had urged a rebuke for an &quot;enemy of the religion&quot;. The delegation went on to London, with no success. 

==Domestic program==
The beginning of Minh Mang rule over Vietnam was vastly unsettling. Vietnam was divided into autonomous domains governed independently by Viceroys under Gia Long. The first cholera pandemic reached Vietnam in summer 1820 removed 206,835 tax payers from royal tax registers, while political scientist Samuel Popkin suggested that around one million people might have been perished due to the disease, out of Vietnam&#x27;s total population of around eight million.

On the domestic front, Minh Mạng continued his father&#x27;s national policies of reorganising the administrative structure of the government. These included the construction of highways, a postal service, public storehouses for food, monetary and agrarian reforms. He continued to redistribute land periodically and forbade all other sales of land to prevent wealthy citizens from reacquiring excessive amounts of land with their money. In 1840 it was decreed that rich landowners had to return a third of their holdings to the community. Calls for basic industrialisation and diversification of the economy into fields such as mining and forestry were ignored. He further centralised the administration, introduced the definition of three levels of performance in the triennial examinations for recruiting mandarins. In 1839, Minh Mạng introduced a program of salaries and pensions for princes and mandarins to replace the traditional assignment of fief estates. 

Diseases, disasters and rebellions against oppression and misery were very frequent, undermining the king&#x27;s strength. Vietnam was at its low point of coherence in history. About 200 rebellions were recorded during his twenty-year reign.

===Conquests and ethnic minority policy===

Despite ongoing intra-turmoil, Minh Mang exhibited his admiring to Confucian rule and classical Chinese culture, while imposing ethnic assimilation at home and pursuing territorial expansion and interference in neighboring Laos. Minh Mang put his support to Vientiane&#x27;s king Chao Anou, his close ally, to wage war against Siam. But the outcome did not go for their plan. Anou was defeated and then was detaining to the Siamese in late 1828 by Chao Noi, ruler of Muang Phuan, also a tributary of Minh Mang. Chao Noi was arrested by the Vietnamese for betraying, then being executed in Hue by Minh Mang. Muang Phuan was annexed into Vietnam in 1832 as Tran Ninh prefecture.

Minh Mạng enacted the final conquest of the Champa Kingdom after the centuries long Cham–Vietnamese wars. He aggressively repressed culture of the Cham and indigenous highland peoples. The Cham Muslim leader Katip Sumat was educated in Kelantan and came back to Champa to declare a Jihad against the Vietnamese after Emperor Minh Mạng&#x27;s annexation of Champa. The Vietnamese coercively fed lizard and pig meat to Cham Muslims and cow meat to Cham Hindus against their will to punish them and assimilate them to Vietnamese culture.

The Chinese or Hoa particularly concentrated in urbanized areas such as Saigon, Cho Lon, and Hanoi. They organized themselves into &quot;bang&quot; or &#x27;congregations.&#x27; Two groups of Chinese that people tended to distinct, known as &quot;Minh Hương&quot; and &quot;Thanh nhân.&quot; The Minh hương were South Chinese refugees of the Ming dynasty that had migrated and settled down in South Vietnam earlier during the 17th century, who married with Cambodian women, had been substantially assimilated to local Vietnamese and Khmer populaces, and loyal to the Nguyen, compared to the Thanh nhân, Chinese immigrants of the Qing dynasty that recently arrived in Southern Vietnam, who dominated the grain trade. During the reign of Minh Mạng, a restriction against the Thanh nhân was issued in 1827, which prohibits the Thanh nhân access to the state bureaucracy, rice monopoly and foreign trade. Their alternate option was having themselves to be adjusted and integrated into Vietnamese society like the Minh Hương.

Minh Mang sent troops to crushed a rebellion in Cambodia in 1820, then incorporated Cambodia into Vietnam in 1834 as the new Tây Thành province. Since then, until his death, Minh Mang had been trying to force the Cambodians to adopt Vietnamese culture by the cultural assimilation progress of what historian David P. Chandler dubbed &quot;The Vietnamization of Cambodia.&quot; Siamese accounts describe that Khmer nobles in Phnom Penh was forced to dress like Vietnamese, abide to Vietnamese laws, and were called &quot;the new Yuon (Viet)&quot;. Cambodian revolts were put down brutally. Douglas Johnson recalled year 1836 as the momentum marked the greatest territorial extent of the Vietnamese empire, also high point of its stability which most revolts in Minh Mang&#x27;s realm had been suppressed. However, continuous uprisings in Cambodia, Tonkin, and wars with Siam put Minh Mang&#x27;s expansion to an query, as all sides became exhausted.

===Rebellions===

Minh Mạng was regarded as being in touch with the concerns of the populace. Frequent local rebellions reminded him of their plight. Descendants of the old Lê dynasty fomented dissent in the north, appealing not only to the peasantry but to the Catholic minority. They attempted to enlist foreign help by promising to open up to missionaries. Local leaders in the south were upset with the loss of the relative political autonomy they enjoyed under Duyệt. With Duyệt&#x27;s death in 1832, a strong defender of Christianity passed. Catholics had traditionally been inclined to side with rebel movements against the monarchy more than most Vietnamese and this erupted after Duyệt&#x27;s death. Minh Mạng ordered Duyệt posthumously indicted and one hundred lashes were applied to his grave. This caused indignation against southerners who respected Duyệt. In July 1833, a revolt broke out under the leadership of his adopted son, Lê Văn Khôi. Historical opinion is divided with scholars contesting whether the grave desecration or the loss of southern autonomy after Duyệt&#x27;s death was the main catalyst. Khôi&#x27;s rebels brought Cochinchina under their control and proposed to replace Minh Mạng with a son of Prince Cảnh. Khôi took into hostage French missionary Joseph Marchand within the citadel, thinking that his presence would win over Catholic support. Khôi enlisted Siamese support, which was forthcoming and helped put Minh Mạng on the defense for a period.

Eventually, however, the Siamese were defeated and the south was recaptured by royalist forces, who besieged Saigon. Khôi died during the siege in December 1834 and Saigon fell nine months later in September 1835 and the rebel commanders put to death. In all the estimates of the captured rebels was put between 500 and 2000, who were executed. The missionaries were rounded up and ordered out of the country. The first French missionary executed was Gagelin in October 1833, the second was Marchand, who was put to death along with the other leaders of the Saigon citadel which surrendered in September 1835. From then until 1838 five more missionaries were put to death. The missionaries began seeking protection from their home countries and the use of force against Asians.

Minh Mạng pursued a policy of cultural assimilation of non-Viet ethnic groups which from 1841, through 1845, led to southern Vietnam experiencing a series of ethnic revolts.

==Ruling style==

Minh Mạng was known for his firmness of character, which guided his instincts in his policy making. This accentuated his unwillingness to break with orthodoxy in dealing with Vietnam&#x27;s problems. His biographer, Marcel Gaultier, asserted that Minh Mạng had expressed his opinions about national policy before Gia Long&#x27;s death, proposing a policy of greater isolationism and shunning Westerners, and that Long tacitly approved of this. Minh Mạng was regarded as more nuanced and gentle than his father, with less forced labour and an increased perceptiveness towards the sentiment of the peasantry.


Although he disagreed with European culture and thinking, he studied it closely and was known for his scholarly nature. Ming Mạng was keen in Western technologies, namely mechanics, weaponry and navigation which he attempted to introduce into Vietnam. Upon hearing of the vaccination against smallpox, he organised for a French surgeon to live in a palatial residence and vaccinate the royal family against the disease. He was learnèd in Eastern philosophy and was regarded as an intellectually oriented monarch. He was also known for his writings as a poet. He was known for his attention to detail and micromanagement of state affairs, to a level that &quot;astonished his contemporaries&quot;. As a result, he was held in high regard for his devotion to running the country. When Minh Mạng died, he left the throne to his son, Emperor Thiệu Trị, who was more rigidly Confucianist and anti-imperialist than his father. During Thiệu Trị&#x27;s reign, diplomatic standoffs precipitated by aspiring European imperial powers on the pretext of the &quot;treatment&quot; of Catholic priests gave them an excuse to use gunboat diplomacy on Vietnam, and led to increasing raids and the eventual colonisation of Vietnam by France. Nevertheless, during his reign, Minh Mạng had established a more efficient government, stopped a Siamese invasion and built many national monuments in the imperial city of Huế. 

==Family and succession==

Minh Mạng had a large number of wives and concubines. He is reported to have fathered 142 children from 43 wives. His sons included: Miên Tông (Emperor Thiệu Trị), Miên Định (Prince of Thọ Xuân), Miên Thẩm (Prince of Tùng Thiện), Miên Trinh (Prince of Tuy Lý), Miên Bửu (Prince of Tương An), Miên Lâm (Prince of Hoài Đức), Miên Triện (Prince of Hoằng Hóa), Miên Lịch (Yên Thành). Three of his daughters, Nguyệt Đình, Mai Am and Huệ Phố, were famous poets.

Minh Mạng&#x27;s sons also had a remarkable number of offspring: Prince of Thọ Xuân fathered 144 children, including 78 sons and 66 daughters, Prince of Tuy Lý, another son, had 77 sons and 37 daughters. He is succeeded by Emperor Thiệu Trị, who himself fathered 29 princes and 35 princesses.

He decided to name his descendants (Nguyễn Phước or Nguyễn Phúc: all members of the Nguyễn dynasty) by choosing the Generation name following the words of the &quot;Imperial succession poem&quot; to avoid confusion. For boys, the following poem is shown in Chữ Quốc Ngữ (modern Vietnamese script) and in chữ nôm:
:Đế Hệ Thi
:&quot;Miên Hường Ưng Bửu Vĩnh&quot;
:&quot;Bảo Quý Định Long Trường&quot;
:&quot;Hiền Năng Kham Kế Thuật&quot;
:&quot;Thế Thoại Quốc Gia Xương&quot;.

:帝系詩
:綿洪膺寶永
:保貴定隆長
:賢能堪繼述
:世瑞國嘉昌
Note: Hường replaced Hồng and Thoại replaced Thụy because it was taboo to use the names of passed emperors or fathers.&quot;

The meaning of each name is roughly given as follows:

Girls receive also a different name on each generation, for example: &quot;Công-chúa&quot;, &quot;Công-nữ&quot;, &quot;Công Tôn-nữ&quot;, &quot;Công-tằng Tôn-nữ&quot;, &quot;Công-huyền Tôn-nữ&quot;, &quot;Lai-huyền Tôn-nữ&quot;, or shorten to &quot;Tôn-nữ&quot; for all generations afterward.

<text>is a Japanese actor, singer, television host, and a former member of SMAP, one of the best-selling boy bands in Asia.

==Early life==
Kusanagi grew up in Kasukabe, Saitama, Japan.

==Career==
===Music===

In 1987, at age 13, Kusanagi auditioned to enter Johnny &amp; Associates, a Japanese talent agency that recruits and trains young boys, preteens to teens, to become singers and members of boy bands. After five of the other band members auditioning individually from 1986 through 1987, in autumn 1987, twenty boys, from ages ten to seventeen, were put together into a group called The Skate Boys, which was initially created as backup dancers for a famous boy band, Hikaru Genji. In April 1988, producer Johnny Kitagawa chose six out of the twenty boys to create a new boy band and named them &quot;SMAP&quot;.

A year after the dissolution of SMAP, Kusanagi, alongside former members Shingo Katori, and Goro Inagaki formed the group, Atarashii Chizu.

===Acting===
He had the lead role in the movie, (January 18, 2003; a Japan public presentation). Moreover, his Korean-language-Japanese-produced movie (March 6, 2004 Japan public presentation) was submitted to the Moscow International Film Festival on June 25, 2004.

In 2020, Kusanagi took on the role of Nagisa, a transgender nightclub worker in Eiji Uchida&#x27;s Midnight Swan. The film won numerous awards, such as Picture of the Year, and he was subsequently awarded the Japan Academy Film Prize for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role.

===Television===
As a member of the boyband SMAP, Kusanagi used to co-host the weekly variety show SMAP×SMAP alongside his bandmates for 20 years. In 2001, he hosted the variety show &quot;Chonangang&quot; on Fuji TV. Determined to debut in Korea, Kusanagi started learning the Korean language and appearing on Korean variety shows. This focus on Korean culture led to him adopting &quot;Chonangang&quot; as his Korean persona in various SMAP concerts, even releasing several singles. Originally, &quot;Chonangang&quot; was intended to focus on Kusanagi&#x27;s journey in South Korea, however lasted eight years due to its popularity. Because of the show&#x27;s success, the format shifted to feature interviews with popular Korean celebrities such as Lee Min-ho, and led to Kusanagi interviewing former South Korean Presidents Roh Moo-hyun, and Lee Myung-bak on TBS.

==Personal life==
Kusanagi announced his marriage on December 30, 2020.

===Arrest===
On April 23, 2009, at around 3 a.m., Kusanagi was arrested on suspicion of public indecency at Akasaka, Minato, Tokyo.
On April 24, 2009, he held a press conference accompanied by his attorney and apologized for his misbehavior. Prosecutors decided not to indict Kusanagi because of his apology. He took a one-month-long hiatus and returned to the taping of &quot;SMAPxSMAP&quot; on May 28, 2009.

They finished as runners-up in the Apertura 2004, and won the play-off promotion beating Club León with a goal from Roberto Dominguez and winning the promotion to Liga MX just one year after the club was founded. The club was relegated to the Apertura in a 2006 tournament after playing for just two years in the top tier.

<doc id="1258029" wikidata="Q1814600" url="?curid=1258029" title="Dominique">
<text>&quot;Dominique&quot; is a 1963 French language popular song, written and performed by Belgian singer Jeannine Deckers, better known as Sœur Sourire (&quot;Sister Smile&quot; in French) or The Singing Nun. The song is about Saint Dominic, a Spanish-born priest and founder of the Dominican Order, of which she was a member (as Sister Luc-Gabrielle). The English-version lyrics of the song were written by Noël Regney. In addition to French and English, Deckers recorded versions in Dutch, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese.

It was a top selling record in 11 countries in late 1963 and early 1964.

==Commercial performance==

&quot;Dominique&quot; reached the Top 10 in 11 countries in late 1963 and early 1964, topping the chart in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It reached the Top 5 in Norway, Denmark, Ireland and South Africa, with the song making it into the lower reaches of the Top 10 in the Netherlands, West Germany, and the United Kingdom. The song reached and stayed at No. 1 on Top 40 radio station WABC in New York City for the four weeks of 19 November through 10 December. On WLS Chicago, the song was No. 1 for the three weeks 15–29 November 1963. On both the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and &quot;Easy Listening chart&quot;, &quot;Dominique&quot; was No. 1 for the four weeks 7–28 December 1963.

The song won the Grammy Award for Best Gospel or Other Religious Recording (Musical) in 1964. It was also a nominee for Grammy Award for Record of the Year, and Sœur Sourire was a nominee for Best Female Vocal Performance. It was the second foreign language song to hit No. 1 on the Hot 100 in 1963, the first being &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; by Kyu Sakamoto. For the next ten years or so, although there were a number of hits with most of the vocals in a language other than English (e.g., The Sandpipers&#x27; &quot;Guantanamera&quot;, René y René&#x27;s &quot;Lo Mucho Que Te Quiero&quot;, etc.), no other purely foreign language song reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&#x27;s top 40 until the Spanish language hit &quot;Eres tú (Touch The Wind)&quot; in 1974. &quot;Dominique&quot; outsold Elvis Presley during its stay on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; it was the second to last No. 1 hit before the British Invasion.

==The song==
&quot;Dominique&quot; became a worldwide hit in 1963 and was the first, and only, Belgian number-one hit single in the American &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

It is remembered chiefly for its refrain, which goes:
: &quot;Domi-nique -nique -nique s&#x27;en allait tout simplement,&quot;
: &quot;Routier, pauvre et chantant.&quot;
: &quot;En tous chemins, en tous lieux,
: &quot;Il ne parle que du Bon Dieu,&quot;
: &quot;Il ne parle que du Bon Dieu.&quot;

A literal English translation is:
: &quot;Domi-nic -nic -nic went about simply,&quot;
: &quot;a poor singing traveller.&quot;
: &quot;On every road, in every place,&quot;
: &quot;he talks only of the Good Lord,&quot;
: &quot;he talks only of the Good Lord.&quot;

The lyrics of the chorus of Regney&#x27;s English-language translation are:
: &quot;Domi-nique -nique -nique, o&#x27;er the land he plods along,&quot;
: &quot;And sings a little song.&quot;
: &quot;Never asking for reward,&quot;
: &quot;He just talks about the Lord,&quot;
: &quot;He just talks about the Lord.&quot;

* Sandler and Young revived the song in late 1966, a version that appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; easy listening chart. The performance was a medley including other religious-themed songs including &quot;Deep River&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows the Trouble I&#x27;ve Seen&quot;.

<text>Schreibersite is generally a rare iron nickel phosphide mineral, , though common in iron-nickel meteorites. It has been found on Disko Island in Greenland and Illinois.

Another name used for the mineral is rhabdite. It forms tetragonal crystals with perfect 001 cleavage. Its color ranges from bronze to brass yellow to silver white. It has a density of 7.5 and a hardness of 6.5 – 7. It is opaque with a metallic luster and a dark gray streak. It was named after the Austrian scientist Carl Franz Anton Ritter von Schreibers (1775–1852), who was one of the first to describe it from iron meteorites.

Schreibersite is reported from the Magura Meteorite, Arva-(present name – Orava), Slovak Republic; the Sikhote-Alin Meteorite in eastern Russia; the São Julião de Moreira Meteorite, Viana do Castelo, Portugal; the Gebel Kamil (meteorite) in Egypt; and numerous other locations including the Moon.

In 2007, researchers reported that schreibersite and other meteoric phosphorus bearing minerals may be the ultimate source for the phosphorus that is so important for life on Earth. In 2013, researchers reported that they had successfully produced pyrophosphite, a possible precursor to pyrophosphate, the molecule associated with ATP, a co-enzyme central to energy metabolism in all life on Earth. Their experiment consisted of subjecting a sample of schreibersite to a warm, acidic environment typically found in association with volcanic activity, activity that was far more common on the primordial Earth. They hypothesized that their experiment might represent what they termed &quot;chemical life&quot;, a stage of evolution which may have led to the emergence of fully biological life as exists today.

Lightning strikes may have provided an alternative source of reduced phosphorus species for the synthesis of early biomolecules.

<doc id="1258041" wikidata="Q519455" url="?curid=1258041" title="Vidiians">
<text>The Vidiians are a fictional alien race in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Developed by &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; series&#x27; co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor, they serve as recurring antagonists during the show&#x27;s first two seasons. They are represented as a nomadic species suffering from a pandemic known as the Phage, which destroys their tissue. A society with highly developed medical technology, the Vidiians harvest organs from corpses and living beings to stall the progression of the Phage, and experiment on other alien species in an attempt to develop a cure. Vidiian storylines frequently revolve around the aliens&#x27; attempts to take &quot;Voyager&quot; crew members&#x27; organs, though a Vidiian scientist named Danara Pel serves as a love interest for The Doctor. The alien species have made minor appearances in the show&#x27;s subsequent seasons, and have been included in novels set in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

Inspired by the Maya civilization, the bubonic plague, and Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, the Vidiians were seen by the show&#x27;s co-creators as a way to honor Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s approach to portraying well-developed antagonists in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. The Vidiians were presented as one of three new alien species that could be expanded as recurring antagonists; the other two were the Kazon and the Sikarians. The concept for the Phage as a bacteriophage was decided through a collaboration between science consultant André Bormanis and the show&#x27;s producers. Michael Westmore was the primary make-up supervisor involved in the creation of the Vidiians&#x27; appearance. The make-up and prosthetics for the Vidiians were extensive, requiring actors to wear head masks, contacts, and dentures. The Vidiians received a generally positive response from critics who praised them as successfully bringing horror themes to the series. Susan Diol garnered positive reviews for her performance as Danara Pel.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; ===
The Vidiians appear as recurring antagonists during &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; first two seasons. The crew of the USS &quot;Voyager&quot; first encounters the alien species in the season one episode &quot;Phage&quot;, in which the Talaxian Neelix (Ethan Phillips) has his lungs stolen by two Vidiians, Dereth (Cully Fredricksen) and Motura (Stephen Rappaport). After Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) pursues the Vidiians to recover Neelix&#x27;s organs, the Vidiians explain that their entire species has been infected by a pandemic known as the Phage. They have developed advanced medical technology to remotely harvest organs directly from living humanoids in order to stop the progression of the Phage, which causes tissue to disintegrate on a cellular level. Motura informs Janeway that he has already implanted Neelix&#x27;s lungs into his own body, but these cannot be removed without killing him, to which he agrees. Faced with a moral dilemma, Janeway refuses his offer and allows both Dereth and Motura to leave. She instructs them to tell the other Vidiians that any attempt to take another organ from &quot;Voyager&quot;″s crew will be met with deadly force. Dereth and Motura perform an operation and adapt a lung from Kes (Jennifer Lien), an Ocampa and Neelix&#x27;s romantic partner, to make for a compatible donation aligned with Neelix&#x27;s physiology. They are able to successfully implant the lung into Neelix&#x27;s body.

In &quot;Faces&quot;, Lieutenants Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), B&#x27;Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), and Peter Durst (Brian Markinson) are kidnapped by the Vidiians. Paris and Durst are forced to work in mines while waiting to have their organs harvested. Vidiian Chief Surgeon Sulan (also played by Markinson) experiments on Torres to find a cure for the Phage, since her Klingon genetic structure has an immunity to the disease. The procedure splits Torres into two bodies (a full-blooded Klingon and a full-blooded human); Sulan conducts further experiments on the Klingon Torres while the Human Torres is forced to work in the mines. Sulan kills Durst and grafts his face on top of his own. Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), Lieutenant Commander Tuvok (Tim Russ), and Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang), who had formed a search party to locate the missing crew members, but upon encountering armed guards are forced to turn back. Chakotay, however returns, now disguised as a Vidiian guard with the help of Tuvok and The Doctor (Robert Picardo), helps to rescue Torres; the Doctor combines both versions of Torres back together.

During &quot;Lifesigns&quot;, the crew responds to a distress call and attempts to help a Vidiian scientist Danara Pel (Susan Diol). The Doctor creates a holographic body for Pel in order to work with her to develop a cure for the Phage. Despite the Vidiians&#x27; mistreatment of Torres in &quot;Faces&quot;, she eventually agrees to provide a sample of her Klingon DNA for their experiments. During their collaboration, the Doctor develops romantic feelings for Pel, and the pair go on a date in the holodeck. When Pel&#x27;s condition deteriorates rapidly, she decides to stay in her new holographic body so that she can remain alive for several days with the Doctor, rather than return to her own Phage-ravaged body. The Doctor convinces Pel to transfer her consciousness back into her body and the couple dance before Pel departs &quot;Voyager&quot;.

Vidiians make minor appearances in &quot;Deadlock&quot; and &quot;Resolutions&quot;. In &quot;Deadlock&quot;, Janeway orders Tom Paris to direct &quot;Voyager&quot; into a nebula to prevent detection from two nearby Vidiian planets. The starship and its crew are duplicated due to a space-time rift. Several Vidiians attack one of the copies of &quot;Voyager&quot; and harvest vital organs from members of its crew. The Janeway captaining the invaded ship stops the invasion by self-destructing the &quot;Voyager&quot; in question. This kills the Vidiians and the crew of that &quot;Voyager&quot;, excepting Harry Kim and the newborn Naomi Wildman; their counterparts having died, they change ships before the self-destruct completes. Pel returns in &quot;Resolutions&quot; to provide a cure for Janeway and Chakotay, who are infected with a terminal illness. Other Vidiians launch an ambush attack during the exchange, but &quot;Voyager&quot; manages to escape with the serum for Janeway and Chakotay.

The Vidiians are referenced and seen in several subsequent episodes. In &quot;Coda&quot;, Janeway finds herself caught in a time loop after a group of Vidiians kill her during an away mission. All of Janeway&#x27;s experiences in the time loop, as well as her death, are explained to be the result of hallucinations caused by an alien disguised as the spirit of her dead father, Admiral Janeway (Len Cariou). In &quot;Think Tank&quot;, Janeway learns that a cure for the Phage has been developed by a committee of alien intellectuals. The Vidiians make their final appearance during an alternative timeline in &quot;Fury&quot;. During this episode, Kes returns to &quot;Voyager&quot; (she had left at the beginning of the fourth season when the development of her psionic powers threatened the starship and its crew). Kes has forgotten the reason for her earlier departure, blaming the crew for abandoning her. After traveling to the past, she contacts the Vidiians and tells them that she will help them commandeer &quot;Voyager&quot; if they escort her past self back to her home planet. The future version of Kes is killed by Janeway during the Vidiians&#x27; attack, and her past version makes a holographic message to prevent the events from occurring. The final mention of the Vidiians occurs in the season six episode &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; as one of the various alien species that have threatened &quot;Voyager&quot; in the past.

=== Other appearances ===
The Vidiians have appeared in original fiction based on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. For example, in &quot;Shadow of Heaven&quot;, Danara Pel is captured by an alien species, who desire vengeance against the Vidiians for their past organ-harvesting operations. Kes rescues Pel by using her psionic powers. In the alternative universe presented in the short story &quot;Places of Exile&quot;, the Doctor and Pel are the ones who have created the cure for the Phage. In this interpretation, the Vidiians form a more diplomatic bond with &quot;Voyager&quot; crew and promise to help expedite their return to the Alpha Quadrant.

Several pieces of merchandise related to the Vidiians were also released following their debut. In 1996, an action figure of a Vidiian was released as part of a second wave of Playmates Toys&#x27; &quot;Star Trek&quot; merchandise. A figure of a Vidiian starship was also released by WizKids. The Vidiians have not been featured in &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), but a writer from Cryptic Studios presented in a 2013 article that they may be one potential alien species to be included in future updates.

== History and culture ==
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, roughly 2,000 years prior to the arrival of &quot;Voyager&quot; in the Delta Quadrant, the Vidiian Sodality was a culture driven by &quot;educators, artists, and explorers&quot;. The book &quot;Star Trek: Star Charts&quot; identifies the Vidiians&#x27; homeworld as Vidiia Prime, the central planet of the Vidiia system and a Class M planet. The spread of the Phage, resulting in thousands of Vidiians dying every day, pushed the alien race to harvest organs and tissue from corpses as well as living beings.

The Vidiians developed advanced medical technology to counteract the spread and progression of the disease, such as their use of a &quot;combined weapon, medical scanner, and surgical instrument&quot; and knowledge of immunogenicity. They also experimented on other alien species in an attempt to find a cure for the Phage. The Vidiians developed methods for interspecies organ transplants. Despite their technological advancements, this alien species is shown to be unfamiliar with holographic technology and engines powered by dilithium.

The Vidiians&#x27; culture also shifts as a result of the Phage. In Vidiian society, an individual would hire a specialist, or a &quot;honatta&quot;, to find the required organs or tissues. Extended periods of contact or group meetings are strongly discouraged to prevent the further spread of the Phage, and those infected are shunned by healthy Vidiians out of fear of contamination. The Vidiians also capture other species to work for them as slaves doing manual tasks, such as mining. In the years following &quot;Voyager&quot; encounters with the Vidiians but prior to their return to Earth, a committee of alien intellectuals known as the Think Tank claimed to have cured the Phage.

== Background ==
=== Concept and creation ===
Prior to the announcement of a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; incarnation, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor conceived of the basic concepts and characters during secret developmental meetings. Taylor, Piller, and producer Brannon Braga developed the premise behind the Phage and the Vidiians&#x27; motives for harvesting organs from discussing ideas that fulfilled the following questions: &quot;Who&#x27;s interesting? What&#x27;s interesting? What&#x27;s an agenda we find interesting?&quot; According to Taylor, the Vidiians were first imagined from an &quot;idea of a culture that was dying of an incurable virus that would go to any lengths to make themselves and their species stay alive&quot;.

Taylor originally envisioned the Vidiians as reminiscent of the Maya civilization, especially relative to practices of human sacrifice and cannibalism. Braga, however, has connected the alien species to European history, questioning if Europeans would have pursued similar methods if the bubonic plague had persisted as a pandemic. Braga stated that the Vidiians were partially inspired by Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, emphasizing that he wanted to portray them as sympathetic. In his book &quot;Star Trek: Parallel Narratives&quot;, Chris Gregory attributes the development of the Vidiians to Braga&#x27;s affinity for the horror genre.

During the writing and development of the episode &quot;Faces&quot;, executive story editor Kenneth Biller had difficulty writing the primary Vidiian character as a sympathetic villain. He looked to Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s approach to portraying antagonists in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise: &quot;[A]liens should never be patently evil. They may have a set of values that differ from our own, but be careful of making them mustache-twirling villains.&quot; Taylor used the following description to summarize the show&#x27;s approach to the alien species:Initially called the &quot;Phages&quot;, the show&#x27;s producers changed the alien species&#x27; name to the &quot;Vaphorans&quot;. Following the completion of the script for the debut episode, the species&#x27; name was revised again to &quot;Vidiians&quot; to prevent potential pronunciation issues for the cast. Introduced in the first season, the Vidiians were developed as one of three new alien species that could be used as recurring antagonists; the other two were the Kazon and the Sikarians. The Vidiians and the Kazon would be featured in later episodes, while the appearance of the Sikarians was restricted to the episode &quot;Prime Factors&quot;.

Through a collaboration with science consultant André Bormanis, the producers established the Phage as a bacteriophage. During a behind-the-scenes feature included on the DVD release of the show&#x27;s second season, Bormanis explained that the writers and producers paid close attention to imagining a virus that could believably almost exterminate an entire species. Both Piller and Braga responded positively to Taylor&#x27;s concept of the Vidiians. Piller viewed the idea of &quot;an alien culture who are a civilized people who are forced to do uncivilized things in order to survive&quot; as a compelling plot point. Braga agreed with Piller&#x27;s assessment, saying: &quot;Very rarely do you stumble on something that has real resonance.&quot; Freelance writer Skye Dent, who had helped with the original development of the Vidiians, felt that pride characterized the alien species. She explained: &quot;[E]ven though they knew what they were doing was wrong in terms of the actual action, they were very confident that because they were culturally superior, they were totally justified in killing people and taking their organs&quot;.

=== Design and casting ===
The series&#x27; make-up supervisor Michael Westmore was heavily involved in the creation of the Vidiians&#x27; look. Taylor worked closely with Westmore to ensure that the Vidiians bore no resemblance to previous alien species featured in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. According to Westmore, the script for the episode &quot;Phage&quot; called for the species to appear like &quot;a race of people whose skin and organs were rotting&quot;. The series&#x27; make-up supervisors based the Vidiians&#x27; design on patchwork quilts, specifically in the way their bodies were composed of various harvested body parts and organs along with their own decomposing skin.

Created as a mask covering the entirety of the actor&#x27;s head, the prosthetic make-up includes pieces from other alien species, such as Talaxians and the Kazon, to represent the Vidiians&#x27; long history of taking organs from humanoids in multiple areas of the Delta Quadrant. Along with the mask, actors portraying Vidiians would wear contact lenses and dentures. Robert Beltran said he felt uncomfortable while acting in the facial mask during the filming of the disguised Chakotay in &quot;Faces&quot;. He described the prosthetic as giving him a &quot;raw, wounded face, which made [him] feel very vulnerable as a person&quot;, and viewed it as an acting challenge.

Following an extensive casting process, American actress Susan Diol was selected to play Danara Pel. Diol had previously appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; as engineer Carmen Davila. Robert Picardo praised her performance, noting that she &quot;miraculously side-stepped all of the pitfalls of that role, which were abject pity&quot;. Taylor developed Danara Pel as a way to explore the morality behind treating terminally ill individuals, while Picardo approached the character as a meditation on the role of physical appearance in romantic relationships. He explained his interpretation of the Doctor&#x27;s romance with Pel:

== Response ==
=== Cast and crew response ===
The Vidiians&#x27; debut in &quot;Phage&quot; received primarily positive responses from &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s cast and crew. Kate Mulgrew praised the moment in which Janeway had to choose between &quot;sacrificing Neelix&#x27;s lungs or allowing another species to continue to survive&quot;. She viewed Janeway&#x27;s initial difficulty with approaching the Vidiians about the subject of ethics as showcasing a level of &quot;poignancy&quot;. While discussing the alien species introduced in the early seasons of &quot;Voyager&quot;, Westmore said that he found the Vidiians to have the most compelling design. He described them as &quot;the most interesting ones that we&#x27;ve run into as far as a new concept and look, and something totally different&quot;, highlighting their use of horror conventions. Taylor praised Westmore&#x27;s work representing the Vidiians as &quot;truly grisly-looking people&quot; without turning them into flat or static characters. Skye Dent had a more critical opinion of the episode, saying that alterations made to her first draft of the script weakened the effectiveness of the alien species as antagonists. She felt that they &quot;just seemed very wimpy to me, even though they were saying the same dialogue I had written&quot;.

The series&#x27; producers and writers also commented on the inclusion of the Vidiians in the episode &quot;Faces&quot;. Piller, Braga, and Taylor praised executive producer Rick Berman&#x27;s decision to reformat the Torres&#x27; storyline with the inclusion of the Vidiians. Dent was impressed by the episode&#x27;s representation of the alien species, and felt it was an improvement over her initial concepts. While discussing the representation of the Vidiians, Biller highlighted the scene in which Vidiian scientist Sulan transplants the face of Lieutenant Peter Durst (also played by Markinson) onto his own, and referred to it as &quot;my classic moment in &quot;Voyager&quot; first season&quot;.

=== Critical reception ===
The Vidiians have received positive feedback from television critics. Marc Buxton of the website Den of Geek! included the Vidiians on his list of the 50 best alien life forms in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, describing them as &quot;Wes Craven nightmares&quot;. While commenting on the episode &quot;Lifesigns&quot;, &quot;TrekToday&quot; Michelle Erica Green questioned the show&#x27;s decision to focus on the Kazon and described the Vidiians as a more suitable and compelling candidate to serve as the primary antagonists for the first two seasons. &quot;Today&quot;&#x27;s Ree Hines called the Vidiians one of the greatest &quot;Star Trek&quot; villains, writing that &quot;their method of organ extraction upped the fear factor&quot; and made them unsympathetic.

Jamahl Epsicokhan of Jammer&#x27;s Reviews commended the development of the Vidiians in &quot;Faces&quot;, writing that they were portrayed as complex villains. Even though he felt that the Vidiians had a compelling premise, he criticized their repeated appearances as distracting from the series&#x27; story arc of a lost crew on a journey home. Juliette Harrison of Den of Geek! ranked Susan Diol&#x27;s performance as Danara Pel as one of the top ten guest performances on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. Pel&#x27;s storyline was praised by Harrison as portraying &quot;the on-going effects of chronic illness on the sufferer&#x27;s sense of self&quot;; for Harrison, Diol approached the role through &quot;carefully understated but heartfelt reactions to her situation&quot;.

===Academic analysis===
A number of academics have identified the Vidiians as potentially adversely influencing public knowledge and perceptions of scientific issues, including genetics and organ donation. Clarence Spiger and colleagues, in a study of student perceptions of organ donations, highlighted the Vidiians as an example of a problematic source of information about the topic on television, a medium which many participants had identified as a key source for their understanding. &quot;We can only speculate&quot;, they wrote, &quot;that students&#x27; responses could have been indirectly or subconsciously influenced through the viewing of such programming.&quot;

Literary critic John Kenneth Muir wrote that the Vidiians were an example of the prevalence of organ harvesting story arcs in science fiction, comparing them to characters in the British television shows &quot;UFO&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. He also questioned the connection between storylines such as the Vidiians to the spread of urban legends involving organ trafficking. In his 2016 &quot;The Politics of Star Trek&quot;, political scientist George A. Gonzalez argued that the Vidiians served as a critique of realpolitik. He described the alien species as built on an &quot;intersubjective agreement that does not recognize the rights of others to their bodies/organs&quot;.

Scholar Karin Blair interpreted the Doctor&#x27;s dance with Pel, which she described as &quot;the Vidiian &#x27;collection of spare parts&#x27;&quot;, as one example of how &quot;Voyager&quot; focused on a &quot;more bounded word, a stable dwelling or memories of home&quot; as opposed to the emphasis on &quot;pluralism and open-ended diversity&quot; in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Blair wrote that Pel provided a glimpse into the Vidiians&#x27; appearance prior to the Phage, noting that she had a stronger set of morals than the Vidiians featured in previous episodes.

<doc id="1258047" wikidata="Q2566892" url="?curid=1258047" title="White Eyes">
<text>White Eyes, named Koquethagechton (c. 1730 – 5 November 1778), was Chief Sachem of the Lenape (Delaware) people in the Ohio Country during the era of the American Revolution. Sometimes known as George White Eyes, or Captain Grey Eyes al. Sir William, his given name in Lenape was rendered in many spelling variations in colonial records.

By 1773 he was Speaker of the Delaware Head Council and known as one of the most important councilors. White Eyes was a war chief and a tireless mediator in turbulent times, negotiating the first Indian treaties with the fledgling United States, and always working toward his ultimate goal of establishing a secure Indian territory. His assassination by an American militia officer is believed to have been covered up by United States officials.

==Early life and education==
Born in Somerset, Pennsylvania, around 1730. White Eyes was a member of the turtle clan(head) of the Lenape nation. His clan heritage marked him as a man in a position for leadership. Both his mother and father were Lenape leaders. Traditionally, the Lenape had lived in the Delaware River Valley. 

==Migration and career==
After the war, when European colonists began settling near the Lenape villages around Fort Pitt in western Pennsylvania, the Native Americans moved further west to Muskingum in the Muskingum River valley in present-day eastern Ohio. By this time, many Lenape had converted to Christianity under the influence of Moravian missionaries and lived in villages led by these missionaries. The missionary towns also moved to Muskingum, so that the Lenape, both Christian and non-Christian, could stay together. Though not a Christian, White Eyes ensured that the Christian Lenape remained members of the larger native community.

==Marriage and family==
After becoming a chief, White Eyes married Rachel Doddridge (d. 1788), a young English colonist who had been taken captive as a 5-year-old child during a Lenape raid and adopted into the Lenape people, becoming fully assimilated. They had at least one son, named George Morgan White Eyes.

Rachel had been living with her father Philip Doddridge and family at a farm on Chartier&#x27;s Creek near Statler&#x27;s Fort (Washington County, Pennsylvania). Her cousin Philip Doddridge reported seeing her later as an adult at a trading post. Thoroughly assimilated by then, she was not interested in a reunion with her British relatives.

==Town in Ohio==
White Eyes established his own town, known by the colonists as White Eyes&#x27; Town, near the Lenape capital of Coshocton, Ohio. By 1773 White Eyes served as Speaker of the Delaware Head Council, an important position and indication of his high reputation in the tribe. In 1774, the Lenape Grand Council, an association of chiefs, named White Eyes as principal chief of the nation.

In the early 1770s, violence on the frontier between whites and Indians threatened to escalate into open warfare. White Eyes unsuccessfully attempted to prevent what would become Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War in 1774, fought primarily between the Shawnee and Virginia colonists. He served as a peace emissary between the two armies, and helped negotiate a treaty to end the war.

==Revolution and death==

When the American Revolutionary War began soon after the end of Dunmore&#x27;s War, White Eyes was negotiating a royal grant with Lord Dunmore to secure the Lenape territory in the Ohio Country. After the American revolutionaries forced Dunmore out of Virginia, White Eyes had to begin anew with the Americans.

In April 1776, he addressed the Continental Congress in Philadelphia on behalf of the Lenape. Two years later he completed an alliance of the Delaware with the United States by a treaty signed in 1778 at Fort Pitt. It promised to establish a Lenape state, with representation in the American Congress, provided that the Congress approved. 
The treaty provided for the Lenape to serve as guides for the Americans when they moved through the Ohio Country to strike at their British and Indian enemies to the north, in and around Detroit. In early November 1778, White Eyes joined an American expedition under General Lachlan McIntosh as a guide and negotiator.

Soon after, the Americans reported that White Eyes had contracted smallpox and died during the expedition. After his death, the Lenape alliance with the Americans eventually collapsed. The Americans by then had no interest in supporting a state under Lenape control. After his death, Gelelemend of the Turtle Clan became the principal chief of the Lenape as no other leader was qualified by clan.

==Assassination claim==
Years later, George Morgan, a US Indian agent, trader, and former close associate of White Eyes, wrote a letter to Congress claiming that the chief had been &quot;treacherously put to death&quot; by American militia in Michigan. Later documentation affirmed that White Eyes had been assassinated by an American militia officer on November 5, 1778. (Morgan had helped negotiate with Native Americans in the Fort Pitt area, so was closely involved in these matters.) He also wrote that the murder of White Eyes had been covered up to prevent the Lenape from abandoning the revolutionaries.

White Eyes&#x27; British-Lenape wife Rachel Doddridge was reportedly murdered by white men in 1788. Their mixed-race son George Morgan White Eyes (1770?–1798) was cared for by the family friend George Morgan. Later he was educated at the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University), where his tuition was paid by the Continental Congress. He graduated in 1789.

<doc id="1258057" wikidata="Q110820614" url="?curid=1258057" title="Peptide synthesis">
<text>In organic chemistry, peptide synthesis is the production of peptides, compounds where multiple amino acids are linked via amide bonds, also known as peptide bonds. Peptides are chemically synthesized by the condensation reaction of the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another. Protecting group strategies are usually necessary to prevent undesirable side reactions with the various amino acid side chains. Chemical peptide synthesis most commonly starts at the carboxyl end of the peptide (C-terminus), and proceeds toward the amino-terminus (N-terminus). Protein biosynthesis (long peptides) in living organisms occurs in the opposite direction.

The chemical synthesis of peptides can be carried out using classical solution-phase techniques, although these have been replaced in most research and development settings by solid-phase methods (see below). Solution-phase synthesis retains its usefulness in large-scale production of peptides for industrial purposes moreover.

Chemical synthesis facilitates the production of peptides that are difficult to express in bacteria, the incorporation of unnatural amino acids, peptide/protein backbone modification, and the synthesis of D-proteins, which consist of D-amino acids.

==Solid-phase synthesis==
The established method for the production of synthetic peptides in the lab is known as solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Pioneered by Robert Bruce Merrifield, SPPS allows the rapid assembly of a peptide chain through successive reactions of amino acid derivatives on a macroscopically insoluble solvent-swollen beaded resin support.

The solid support consists of small, polymeric resin beads functionalized with reactive groups (such as amine or hydroxyl groups) that link to the nascent peptide chain. Since the peptide remains covalently attached to the support throughout the synthesis, excess reagents and side products can be removed by washing and filtration. This approach circumvents the comparatively time-consuming isolation of the product peptide from solution after each reaction step, which would be required when using conventional solution-phase synthesis.

Each amino acid to be coupled to the peptide chain N-terminus must be protected on its N-terminus and side chain using appropriate protecting groups such as Boc (acid-labile) or Fmoc (base-labile), depending on the side chain and the protection strategy used (see below).

The general SPPS procedure is one of repeated cycles of alternate N-terminal deprotection and coupling reactions. The resin can be washed between each steps. First an amino acid is coupled to the resin. Subsequently, the amine is deprotected, and then coupled with the activated carboxyl group of the next amino acid to be added. This cycle is repeated until the desired sequence has been synthesized. SPPS cycles may also include capping steps which block the ends of unreacted amino acids from reacting. At the end of the synthesis, the crude peptide is cleaved from the solid support while simultaneously removing all protecting groups using a reagent such as trifluoroacetic acid. The crude peptide can be precipitated from a non-polar solvent like diethyl ether in order to remove organic soluble byproducts. The crude peptide can be purified using reversed-phase HPLC. The purification process, especially of longer peptides can be challenging, because cumulative amounts of numerous minor byproducts, which have properties similar to the desired peptide product, have to be removed. For this reason so-called continuous chromatography processes such as MCSGP are increasingly being used in commercial settings to maximize the yield without sacrificing purity.

SPPS is limited by reaction yields due to the exponential accumulation of by-products, and typically peptides and proteins in the range of 70 amino acids are pushing the limits of synthetic accessibility. Synthetic difficulty also is sequence dependent; typically aggregation-prone sequences such as amyloids are difficult to make. Longer lengths can be accessed by using ligation approaches such as native chemical ligation, where two shorter fully deprotected synthetic peptides can be joined in solution.

===Peptide coupling reagents===

An important feature that has enabled the broad application of SPPS is the generation of extremely high yields in the coupling step. Highly efficient amide bond-formation conditions are required. To illustrate the impact of suboptimal coupling yields for a given synthesis, consider the case where each coupling step were to have at least 99% yield: this would result in a 77% overall crude yield for a 26-amino acid peptide (assuming 100% yield in each deprotection); if each coupling were 95% efficient, the overall yield would be 25%. and adding an excess of each amino acid (between 2- and 10-fold). The minimization of amino acid racemization during coupling is also of vital importance to avoid epimerization in the final peptide product.

Amide bond formation between an amine and carboxylic acid is slow, and as such usually requires &#x27;coupling reagents&#x27; or &#x27;activators&#x27;. A wide range of coupling reagents exist, due in part to their varying effectiveness for particular couplings, many of these reagents are commercially available.

====Carbodiimides====

Carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) are frequently used for amide bond formation. The reaction proceeds via the formation of a highly reactive &quot;O&quot;-acylisourea. This reactive intermediate is attacked by the peptide N-terminal amine, forming a peptide bond. Formation of the &quot;O&quot;-acylisourea proceeds fastest in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane.

DIC is particularly useful for SPPS since as a liquid it is easily dispensed, and the urea byproduct is easily washed away. Conversely, the related carbodiimide 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) is often used for solution-phase peptide couplings as its urea byproduct can be removed by washing during aqueous work-up.

Carbodiimide activation opens the possibility for racemization of the activated amino acid. Racemization can be circumvented with &#x27;racemization suppressing&#x27; additives such as the triazoles 1-hydroxy-benzotriazole (HOBt), and 1-hydroxy-7-aza-benzotriazole (HOAt). These reagents attack the &quot;O&quot;-acylisourea intermediate to form an active ester, which subsequently reacts with the peptide to form the desired peptide bond. Ethyl cyanohydroxyiminoacetate (Oxyma), an additive for carbodiimide coupling, acts as an alternative to HOAt.

====Amidinium and phosphonium salts====

To avoid epimerization through the O-acylisourea intermediate formed when using a carbodiimide reagent, an amidinium- or phosphonium-reagent can be employed These reagents have two parts: an electrophilic moiety which deoxygenates the carboxylic acid (blue) and masked nucleophilic moiety (red). Nucleophilic attack of the carboxylic acid on the electrophilic amidinium or phosphonium moiety leads to a short lived intermediate which is rapidly trapped by the unmasked nucleophile to form the activated ester intermediate and either a urea or phosphoramide by-product. These cationic reagents have non-coordinating counteranions such as a hexafluorophosphate or a tetrafluoroborate. The identity of this anion is typically indicated by the first letter in the reagent’s acronym, although the nomenclature can be inconsistent. For example HBTU is a hexafluorophosphate salt while TBTU is a tetrafluoroborate salt. In addition to HBTU and HATU other common reagents include HCTU (6-ClHOBt), TCFH (chloride) and COMU (ethyl cyano(hydroxyimino)acetate). Amidinium reagents incorporating hydroxybenzotriazole moieties can exist in an N-form (guanadinium) or an O-form (uronium), but the N-form is generally more stable. Phosphonium reagents include BOP (HOBt), PyBOP (HOBt) and PyAOP (HOAt). Although these reagents can lead to the same activated ester intermediates as a carbodiimide reagent, the rate of activation is higher due to the high electrophilicty of these cationic reagents. Amidinium reagents are capable of reacting with the peptide N-terminus to form an inactive guanidino by-product, whereas phosphonium reagents are not.
==== Propanephosphonic acid anhydride ====
Since late 2000s, propanephosphonic acid anhydride, sold commercially under various names such as &quot;T3P&quot;, has become a useful reagent for amide bond formation in commercial applications. It converts the oxygen of the carboxylic acid into a leaving group, whose peptide-coupling byproducts are water-soluble and can be easily washed away. In a performance comparison between propanephosphonic acid anhydride and other peptide coupling reagents for the preparation of a nonapeptide drug, it was found that this reagent was superior to other reagents with regards to yield and low epimerization.

===Solid supports===

Solid supports for peptide synthesis are selected for physical stability, to permit the rapid filtration of liquids. Suitable supports are inert to reagents and solvents used during SPPS and allow for the attachment of the first amino acid. Swelling is of great importance because peptide synthesis takes place inside the swollen pores of the solid support.

Three primary types of solid supports are: gel-type supports, surface-type supports, and composites. Improvements to solid supports used for peptide synthesis enhance their ability to withstand the repeated use of TFA during the deprotection step of SPPS. Two primary resins are used, based on whether a C-terminal carboxylic acid or amide is desired. The Wang resin was, , the most commonly used resin for peptides with C-terminal carboxylic acids.

===Protecting groups schemes===
As described above, the use of N-terminal and side chain protecting groups is essential during peptide synthesis to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as self-coupling of the activated amino acid leading to (polymerization). This would compete with the intended peptide coupling reaction, resulting in low yield or even complete failure to synthesize the desired peptide.

Two principle protecting group schemes are typically used in solid phase peptide synthesis: so-called Boc/benzyl and Fmoc/&quot;tert-&quot;butyl approaches. The Boc/Bzl strategy utilizes TFA-labile N-terminal Boc protection alongside side chain protection that is removed using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride during the final cleavage step (with simultaneous cleavage of the peptide from the solid support). Fmoc/tBu SPPS uses base-labile Fmoc N-terminal protection, with side chain protection and a resin linkage that are acid-labile (final acidic cleavage is carried out via TFA treatment). Both approaches, including the advantages and disadvantages of each, are outlined in more detail below.

====Boc/Bzl SPPS====
Before the advent of SPPS, solution methods for chemical peptide synthesis relied on &quot;tert&quot;-butyloxycarbonyl (abbreviated &#x27;Boc&#x27;) as a temporary N-terminal α-amino protecting group. The Boc group is removed with acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). This forms a positively charged amino group in the presence of excess TFA (note that the amino group is not protonated in the image on the right), which is neutralized and coupled to the incoming activated amino acid. Neutralization can either occur prior to coupling or &quot;in situ&quot; during the basic coupling reaction.

The Boc/Bzl approach retains its usefulness in reducing peptide aggregation during synthesis. In addition, Boc/benzyl SPPS may be preferred over the Fmoc/&quot;tert-&quot;butyl approach when synthesizing peptides containing base-sensitive moieties (such as depsipeptides or thioester moeities), as treatment with base is required during the Fmoc deprotection step (see below).

Permanent side-chain protecting groups used during Boc/benzyl SPPS are typically benzyl or benzyl-based groups. Final removal of the peptide from the solid support occurs simultaneously with side chain deprotection using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride via hydrolytic cleavage. The final product is a fluoride salt which is relatively easy to solubilize. Scavengers such as cresol must be added to the HF in order to prevent reactive cations from generating undesired byproducts.

====Fmoc/&quot;t&quot;Bu SPPS====

The use of N-terminal Fmoc protection allows for a milder deprotection scheme than used for Boc/Bzl SPPS, and this protection scheme is truly orthogonal under SPPS conditions. Fmoc deprotection utilizes a base, typically 20–50% piperidine in DMF. The exposed amine is therefore neutral, and consequently no neutralization of the peptide-resin is required, as in the case of the Boc/Bzl approach. The lack of electrostatic repulsion between the peptide chains can lead to increased risk of aggregation with Fmoc/&quot;t&quot;Bu SPPS however. Because the liberated fluorenyl group is a chromophore, Fmoc deprotection can be monitored by UV absorbance of the reaction mixture, a strategy which is employed in automated peptide synthesizers.

The ability of the Fmoc group to be cleaved under relatively mild basic conditions while being stable to acid allows the use of side chain protecting groups such as Boc and &quot;t&quot;Bu that can be removed in milder acidic final cleavage conditions (TFA) than those used for final cleavage in Boc/Bzl SPPS (HF). Scavengers such as water and triisopropylsilane (TIPS) are most commonly added during the final cleavage in order to prevent side reactions with reactive cationic species released as a result of side chain deprotection. Nevertheless, many other scavenger compounds could be used as well. The resulting crude peptide is obtained as a TFA salt, which is potentially more difficult to solubilize than the fluoride salts generated in Boc SPPS.

Fmoc/&quot;t&quot;Bu SPPS is less atom-economical, as the fluorenyl group is much larger than the Boc group. Accordingly, prices for Fmoc amino acids were high until the large-scale piloting of one of the first synthesized peptide drugs, enfuvirtide, began in the 1990s, when market demand adjusted the relative prices of Fmoc- vs Boc- amino acids.

====Other protecting groups====

=====Benzyloxy-carbonyl=====

The (Z) group is another carbamate-type amine protecting group, discovered by Leonidas Zervas in the early 1930s and usually added via reaction with benzyl chloroformate.

It is removed under harsh conditions using HBr in acetic acid, or milder conditions of catalytic hydrogenation.

This methodology was first used in the synthesis of oligopeptides by Zervas and Max Bergmann in 1932. Hence, this became known as the Bergmann-Zervas synthesis, which was characterised &quot;epoch-making&quot; and helped establish synthetic peptide chemistry as a distinct field. It constituted the first useful lab method for controlled peptide synthesis, enabling the synthesis of previously unattainable peptides with reactive side-chains, while Z-protected amino acids are also prevented form undergoing racemization.

The use of the Bergmann-Zervas method remained the standard practice in peptide chemistry for two full decades after its publication, superseded by newer methods (such as the Boc protecting group) in the early 1950s. Nowadays, while it has been used periodically for α-amine protection, it is much more commonly used for side chain protection.

=====Alloc and miscellaneous groups=====
The allyloxycarbonyl (alloc) protecting group is sometimes used to protect an amino group (or carboxylic acid or alcohol group) when an orthogonal deprotection scheme is required. It is also sometimes used when conducting on-resin cyclic peptide formation, where the peptide is linked to the resin by a side-chain functional group. The Alloc group can be removed using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0).

For special applications like synthetic steps involving protein microarrays, protecting groups sometimes termed &quot;lithographic&quot; are used, which are amenable to photochemistry at a particular wavelength of light, and so which can be removed during lithographic types of operations.

====Regioselective disulfide bond formation====
The formation of multiple native disulfides remains challenging of native peptide synthesis by solid-phase methods. Random chain combination typically results in several products with nonnative disulfide bonds. Stepwise formation of disulfide bonds is typically the preferred method, and performed with thiol protecting groups. Different thiol protecting groups provide multiple dimensions of orthogonal protection. These orthogonally protected cysteines are incorporated during the solid-phase synthesis of the peptide. Successive removal of these groups, to allow for selective exposure of free thiol groups, leads to disulfide formation in a stepwise manner. The order of removal of the groups must be considered so that only one group is removed at a time.

Thiol protecting groups used in peptide synthesis requiring later regioselective disulfide bond formation must possess multiple characteristics. First, they must be reversible with conditions that do not affect the unprotected side chains. Second, the protecting group must be able to withstand the conditions of solid-phase synthesis. Third, the removal of the thiol protecting group must be such that it leaves intact other thiol protecting groups, if orthogonal protection is desired. That is, the removal of PG A should not affect PG B. Some of the thiol protecting groups commonly used include the acetamidomethyl (Acm), &quot;tert&quot;-butyl (But), 3-nitro-2-pyridine sulfenyl (NPYS), 2-pyridine-sulfenyl (Pyr), and trityl (Trt) groups. Importantly, the NPYS group can replace the Acm PG to yield an activated thiol.

Using this method, Kiso and coworkers reported the first total synthesis of insulin in 1993. In this work, the A-chain of insulin was prepared with following protecting groups in place on its cysteines: CysA6(But), CysA7(Acm), and CysA11(But), leaving CysA20 unprotected.

==Microwave-assisted peptide synthesis==

Microwave-assisted peptide synthesis has been used to complete long peptide sequences with high degrees of yield and low degrees of racemization.

The first article relating to continuous flow peptide synthesis was published in 1986, but due to technical limitations, it was not until the early 2010&#x27;s when more academic groups started using continuous flow for the rapid synthesis of peptides. The advantages of continuous flow over traditional batch methods is the ability to heat reagents with good temperature control, allowing the speed of reaction kinetics while minimising side reactions. cycles times vary from 30 seconds, up to 6 minutes, depending on reaction conditions and excess of reagent.

Thanks to inline analytics, such as UV/Vis spectroscopy and the use of Variable Bed Flow reactor (VBFR) that monitor the resin volume, on-resin aggregation can be identified and coupling efficiency can be evaluated.

== Synthesizing long peptides ==
Stepwise elongation, in which the amino acids are connected step-by-step in turn, is ideal for small peptides containing between 2 and 100 amino acid residues. Another method is fragment condensation, in which peptide fragments are coupled. Although the former can elongate the peptide chain without racemization, the yield drops if only it is used in the creation of long or highly polar peptides. Fragment condensation is better than stepwise elongation for synthesizing sophisticated long peptides, but its use must be restricted in order to protect against racemization. Fragment condensation is also undesirable since the coupled fragment must be in gross excess, which may be a limitation depending on the length of the fragment.

A new development for producing longer peptide chains is chemical ligation: unprotected peptide chains react chemoselectively in aqueous solution. A first kinetically controlled product rearranges to form the amide bond. The most common form of native chemical ligation uses a peptide thioester that reacts with a terminal cysteine residue.

Other methods applicable for covalently linking polypeptides in aqueous solution include the use of split inteins, spontaneous isopeptide bond formation and sortase ligation.

In order to optimize synthesis of long peptides, a method was developed in Medicon Valley for converting peptide sequences. The simple pre-sequence (e.g. Lysine (Lysn); Glutamic Acid (Glun); (LysGlu)n) that is incorporated at the C-terminus of the peptide to induce an alpha-helix-like structure. This can potentially increase biological half-life, improve peptide stability and inhibit enzymatic degradation without altering pharmacological activity or profile of action.

==Cyclic peptides==

===On resin cyclization===
Peptides can be cyclized on a solid support. A variety of cyclization reagents can be used such as HBTU/HOBt/DIEA, PyBop/DIEA, PyClock/DIEA. Head-to-tail peptides can be made on the solid support. The deprotection of the C-terminus at some suitable point allows on-resin cyclization by amide bond formation with the deprotected N-terminus. Once cyclization has taken place, the peptide is cleaved from resin by acidolysis and purified.

The strategy for the solid-phase synthesis of cyclic peptides is not limited to attachment through Asp, Glu or Lys side chains. Cysteine has a very reactive sulfhydryl group on its side chain. A disulfide bridge is created when a sulfur atom from one Cysteine forms a single covalent bond with another sulfur atom from a second cysteine in a different part of the protein. These bridges help to stabilize proteins, especially those secreted from cells. Some researchers use modified cysteines using S-acetomidomethyl (Acm) to block the formation of the disulfide bond but preserve the cysteine and the protein&#x27;s original primary structure.

===Off-resin cyclization===
Off-resin cyclization is a solid-phase synthesis of key intermediates, followed by the key cyclization in solution phase, the final deprotection of any masked side chains is also carried out in solution phase. This has the disadvantages that the efficiencies of solid-phase synthesis are lost in the solution phase steps, that purification from by-products, reagents and unconverted material is required, and that undesired oligomers can be formed if macrocycle formation is involved.

The use of pentafluorophenyl esters (FDPP, PFPOH) and BOP-Cl are useful for cyclising peptides.

<doc id="1258079" wikidata="Q354550" url="?curid=1258079" title="Voltage-gated ion channel">
<text>Voltage-gated ion channels are a class of transmembrane proteins that form ion channels that are activated by changes in a cell&#x27;s electrical membrane potential near the channel. The membrane potential alters the conformation of the channel proteins, regulating their opening and closing. Cell membranes are generally impermeable to ions, thus they must diffuse through the membrane through transmembrane protein channels.

Voltage-gated ion channels have a crucial role in excitable cells such as neuronal and muscle tissues, allowing a rapid and co-ordinated depolarization in response to triggering voltage change. Found along the axon and at the synapse, voltage-gated ion channels directionally propagate electrical signals.

Voltage-gated ion-channels are usually ion-specific, and channels specific to sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and chloride (Cl−) ions have been identified. The opening and closing of the channels are triggered by changing ion concentration, and hence charge gradient, between the sides of the cell membrane.

==Structure==
Voltage-gated ion channels are generally composed of several subunits arranged in such a way that there is a central pore through which ions can travel down their electrochemical gradients. The channels tend to be ion-specific, although similarly sized and charged ions may sometimes travel through them.

The functionality of voltage-gated ion channels is attributed to its three main discrete units: the voltage sensor, the pore or conducting pathway, and the gate. Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels are composed of four transmembrane domains arranged around a central pore; these four domains are part of a single α-subunit in the case of most Na+ and Ca2+ channels, whereas there are four α-subunits, each contributing one transmembrane domain, in most K+ channels.

The membrane-spanning segments, designated S1-S6, all take the form of alpha helices with specialized functions. The fifth and sixth transmembrane segments (S5 and S6) and pore loop serve the principal role of ion conduction, comprising the gate and pore of the channel, while S1-S4 serve as the voltage-sensing region.

The four subunits may be identical, or different from one another. In addition to the four central α-subunits, there are also regulatory β-subunits, with oxidoreductase activity, which are located on the inner surface of the cell membrane and do not cross the membrane, and which are coassembled with the α-subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum.

==Mechanism==
Crystallographic structural studies of a potassium channel have shown that, when a potential difference is introduced over the membrane, the associated electric field induces a conformational change in the potassium channel. The conformational change distorts the shape of the channel proteins sufficiently such that the cavity, or channel, opens to allow influx or efflux to occur across the membrane. This movement of ions down their concentration gradients subsequently generates an electric current sufficient to depolarize the cell membrane.

Voltage-gated sodium channels and calcium channels are made up of a single polypeptide with four homologous domains. Each domain contains 6 membrane spanning alpha helices. One of these helices, S4, is the voltage sensing helix. The S4 segment contains many positive charges such that a high positive charge outside the cell repels the helix, keeping the channel in its closed state.

In general, the voltage sensing portion of the ion channel is responsible for the detection of changes in transmembrane potential that trigger the opening or closing of the channel. The S1-4 alpha helices are generally thought to serve this role. In potassium and sodium channels, voltage-sensing S4 helices contain positively-charged lysine or arginine residues in repeated motifs. In its resting state, half of each S4 helix is in contact with the cell cytosol. Upon depolarization, the positively-charged residues on the S4 domains move toward the exoplasmic surface of the membrane. It is thought that the first 4 arginines account for the gating current, moving toward the extracellular solvent upon channel activation in response to membrane depolarization. The movement of 10–12 of these protein-bound positive charges triggers a conformational change that opens the channel. The exact mechanism by which this movement occurs is not currently agreed upon, however the canonical, transporter, paddle, and twisted models are examples of current theories.

Movement of the voltage-sensor triggers a conformational change of the gate of the conducting pathway, controlling the flow of ions through the channel.

The main functional part of the voltage-sensitive protein domain of these channels generally contains a region composed of S3b and S4 helices, known as the &quot;paddle&quot; due to its shape, which appears to be a conserved sequence, interchangeable across a wide variety of cells and species. A similar voltage sensor paddle has also been found in a family of voltage sensitive phosphatases in various species. Genetic engineering of the paddle region from a species of volcano-dwelling archaebacteria into rat brain potassium channels results in a fully functional ion channel, as long as the whole intact paddle is replaced. This &quot;modularity&quot; allows use of simple and inexpensive model systems to study the function of this region, its role in disease, and pharmaceutical control of its behavior rather than being limited to poorly characterized, expensive, and/or difficult to study preparations.

Although voltage-gated ion channels are typically activated by membrane depolarization, some channels, such as inward-rectifier potassium ion channels, are activated instead by hyperpolarization.

The gate is thought to be coupled to the voltage sensing regions of the channels and appears to contain a mechanical obstruction to ion flow. While the S6 domain has been agreed upon as the segment acting as this obstruction, its exact mechanism is unknown. Possible explanations include: the S6 segment makes a scissor-like movement allowing ions to flow through, the S6 segment breaks into two segments allowing of passing of ions through the channel, or the S6 channel serving as the gate itself. The mechanism by which the movement of the S4 segment affects that of S6 is still unknown, however it is theorized that there is a S4-S5 linker whose movement allows the opening of S6.

Inactivation of ion channels occurs within milliseconds after opening. Inactivation is thought to be mediated by an intracellular gate that controls the opening of the pore on the inside of the cell. This gate is modeled as a ball tethered to a flexible chain. During inactivation, the chain folds in on itself and the ball blocks the flow of ions through the channel. Fast inactivation is directly linked to the activation caused by intramembrane movements of the S4 segments, though the mechanism linking movement of S4 and the engagement of the inactivation gate is unknown.

==Different types==

===Sodium (Na+) channels===

Sodium channels have similar functional properties across many different cell types. While ten human genes encoding for sodium channels have been identified, their function is typically conserved between species and different cell types.

===Calcium (Ca2+) channels===

With sixteen different identified genes for human calcium channels, this type of channel differs in function between cell types. Ca2+ channels produce action potentials similarly to Na+ channels in some neurons. They also play a role in neurotransmitter release in pre-synaptic nerve endings. In most cells, Ca2+ channels regulate a wide variety of biochemical processes due to their role in controlling intracellular Ca2+ concentrations.

===Potassium (K+) channels===

Potassium channels are the largest and most diverse class of voltage-gated channels, with over 100 encoding human genes. These types of channels differ significantly in their gating properties; some inactivating extremely slowly and others inactivating extremely quickly. This difference in activation time influences the duration and rate of action potential firing, which has a significant effect on electrical conduction along an axon as well as synaptic transmission. Potassium channels differ in structure from the other channels in that they contain four separate polypeptide subunits, while the other channels contain four homologous domain but on a single polypeptide unit.

===Chloride (Cl−) channels===

Chloride channels are present in all types of neurons. With the chief responsibility of controlling excitability, chloride channels contribute to the maintenance of cell resting potential and help to regulate cell volume.

===Proton (H+) channels===
Voltage-gated proton channels carry currents mediated by hydrogen ions in the form of hydronium, and are activated by depolarization in a pH-dependent manner. They function to remove acid from cells.

== Phylogenetics ==

Phylogenetic studies of proteins expressed in bacteria revealed the existence of a superfamily of voltage-gated sodium channels. Subsequent studies have shown that a variety of other ion channels and transporters are phylogenetically related to the voltage-gated ion channels, including:

* inwardly rectifying K+ channels, 
* ryanodine-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor Ca2+ channels, 
* transient receptor potential Ca2+ channels, 
* polycystin cation channels, 
* glutamate-gated ion channels, 
* calcium-dependent chloride channels, 
* monovalent cation:proton antiporters, type 1, and 
* potassium transporters.

<text>Peter Roger Hunt (11 March 1925 – 14 August 2002) was a British director, editor and producer of film and television, best known for his work on the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series, first as an editor and then as a second unit director. He finally served as director for &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. His work on the series helped pioneer an innovative, fast-cutting editing style.

== Biography ==
As an infantryman, Hunt served in Salerno, Italy, in 1943.

After undertaking several forms of employment, Hunt worked as an assistant cutter for Alexander Korda, before working as an assembling editor on &quot;The Man Who Watched Trains Go By&quot;. After several B-movies, he served as the supervising editor on &quot;A Hill in Korea&quot;. The following year, Hunt edited &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; (directed and co-written by Lewis Gilbert), becoming good friends with John Glen. Hunt continued his collaboration with Gilbert on films such as &quot;Ferry to Hong Kong&quot; and &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot;.

In the 1960s, Hunt signed on as an editor on the first James Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), and he edited &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963) and &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964). On those three films, Hunt developed an editing technique in which he utilized quick cutting, allowing camera swings during action and inserts interleaving other elements. He also worked with Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli on the Bob Hope film &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot; (1963), and with Saltzman and a few other Bond veterans on the non-Eon thriller &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; (1965). &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot; was the only film produced by the James Bond production company Eon Productions that was not a Bond film until 2014.

After editing &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965), Hunt asked to direct &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967) but was passed over in favor of Lewis Gilbert. Although Hunt initially quit in protest, Broccoli and Saltzman persuaded him to stay as second unit director on the understanding that he would be promoted to director in a future Eon film. Saltzman and Broccoli were impressed with his quick cutting skills and felt he had set the style for the series. Hunt directed the &quot;Little Nellie&quot; sequence of the film. When Gilbert passed on the opportunity to direct &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969), Broccoli and Saltzman selected Hunt as director. Hunt also asked for the position during the production of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), and he brought along with him many crew members, including cinematographer Michael Reed and editor John Glen. Hunt was concerned to put his mark on the production – &quot;I wanted it to be different than any other Bond film would be. It was my film, not anyone else&#x27;s.&quot;

&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; was the last James Bond film on which Hunt worked. Hunt was asked to direct numerous other Eon Bond films — including &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, and &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; — but always declined. In 1971, Hunt directed episodes of &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; with Bond star, Roger Moore; he also directed Moore in &quot;Gold&quot; (1974) and &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; (1976) with Lee Marvin. Although approached by Kevin McClory, he refused to direct &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983) afraid that Broccoli would consider him disloyal. His last films included &quot;Wild Geese II&quot; (1985) and the Cannon Film thrillers, &quot;Death Hunt&quot; (1981) and &quot;Assassination&quot; (1987), both starring Charles Bronson. He also directed the epic television miniseries &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1984).

== Personal life ==
Hunt spent his later years living in the United States. He was gay and lived with his partner, Nicos Kourtis, from 1975 until his death. He died of heart failure on 14 August 2002 at his home in Santa Monica, California, at the age of 77.

<doc id="1258103" wikidata="Q4832426" url="?curid=1258103" title="Azerbaijani hip-hop">
<text>Azerbaijani hip hop () is the musical genre which became popular in Azerbaijan in mid-1990s. It&#x27;s a mix of native meykhana genre of Azerbaijani music with Western hip hop.

==History==
The first Azerbaijani hip-hop song &quot;Dünənki keçdi&quot; (Yesterday is Past) was created in 1983 by Chingiz Mustafayev, who would later become Azerbaijan&#x27;s national hero for unrelated reasons.
The pioneer of Azerbaijani rap often associated with name of Anar Nagilbaz in 1992, which also included elements of disco but the popularity of the rap genre came with the rise of Dayirman, which included primarily patriotic elements.

In 2000s, despite mass emergence of independent rappers like Elşad Xose and Huseyn Derya and popularity of hip-hop shows like &quot;Mən də varam&quot; on Space TV, only a few Azerbaijani rap artists have achieved commercial success. During the late 2000s, rap group H.O.S.T. became primarily popular among hip hop fans.

On 29 December 2011, the first Azerbaijani national musical, a hip-hop version of the classic love story Leyli and Majnun, has been performed in Baku. Despite the commercial dominance of hip-hop and Azerbaijani pop music during this period, rapper Miri Yusif found success with his reggae and soul fusion album &quot;Karma&quot;, peaked at number 1 in the Azerbaijani Albums Chart in 2010.

<text>RETAIN is a mainframe based database system, accessed via IBM 3270 terminals (or more likely, emulators), used internally within IBM providing service support to IBM field personnel and customers.

The acronym RETAIN stands for Remote Technical Assistance Information Network.

== Predecessor system ==

Historically, two different, but similar, systems were called RETAIN. The first, dating to the mid-1960s was a system that provided technical information to people in the IBM Field Engineering Division in the form of short bulletins or tips, organized according to machine type number or, for software, according to software component ID number. This information was accessible using simple query commands from IBM service branch office terminals. The terminals supported by this early RETAIN system were typewriter-type terminals, such as the IBM 2740. These same terminals were also used to access the IBM Field Instruction System (FIS), which provided education in the form of programmed instruction courseware. The RETAIN system was built on the same software framework as that of FIS. In fact, most of the early support for RETAIN was actually written in the language of a &quot;course&quot;.

The system was primarily used to provide field support for the System/360 family of mainframe systems, although it was used also to disseminate some technical information on other older systems.

== RETAIN/370 ==

In 1970, concurrent with the announcement of System/370, the next generation of mainframes after System/360, a new system was announced, called RETAIN/370. This system was designed for use by special Technical Support Centers located in regional centers, rather than by the branch office. This new system was designed to display terminals, rather than the old typewriter-based ones. A special version of the 2915 display, originally designed for the airline reservations systems, such as SABRE, was used. The 2915 was a small keyboard-display driven by a large electronic controller and data interchange unit, the IBM 2948. Each 2948 could control up to 31 display terminals, which had to be located within a few hundred feet. The cost of this display system, with its large controller, prevented the 2915 terminals from being used in branch offices, so they were used in regional support centers instead. The older RETAIN system continued to be used for several years afterwards, running in parallel with RETAIN/370, still connected to branch-office terminals. It was sometimes called the &quot;RETAIN/360&quot; system, although that designation was never formalized. In time, after RETAIN/370 became available via 3270 terminals in the branch offices, the old RETAIN system was phased out, and RETAIN/370 was renamed to simply RETAIN.

=== Search engine ===

RETAIN/370 ran special applications designed for technical support center use. Its most powerful feature was a full-text search engine, enabling most text documents in the system to be retrieved by using boolean search requests, similar in concept to full-text search engines in use today on the Internet, such as Google or AltaVista, although limited only to searching for individual words, or combinations of words, without reference to word-adjacency. RETAIN/370 was the first IBM system deployed on a large scale that had such a capability. The search engine component of RETAIN is called IRIS, for Interpretive Retrieval Information System (not to be confused with other non-IBM software systems of that name... IBM never sold this search engine as a product, so there was no trademark issue).

=== Mirrored database ===

In the mid-1970s, a RETAIN was expanded to permit multiple copies of the database to be hosted on geographically distributed systems. RETAIN&#x27;s custom-built Data Bank Manager, which served as the foundation for all RETAIN applications, and the IRIS search engine, was modified to support &quot;mirroring&quot; of file updates to take place automatically across the network, in a manner nearly invisible to the application programs, but which providing a high level of data integrity. After this change, RETAIN hosts were created in two US locations, two in Europe, two in South America, and two in Japan. Most applications were developed by IBM programmers in Raleigh, NC, (moved to Boulder, Colorado, in 1976) with some work being done in North Harbour, UK.

Registered users of the system numbered in the thousands, in over 60 countries.

=== Remote support ===

At the time System/370 was announced, along with the corresponding RETAIN/370 system, IBM announced that the new family of computers would be equipped to permit remote diagnosis of hardware problems. Each System/370 installation of model 145 and above have a telecommunications adapter included capable of being used for remote support. The hardware diagnostic programs were written to allow control via a remote connection to applications on the RETAIN system that could be controlled by IBM specialists located at the IBM support center in Chicago, managed by Paul Rushton, and also including the original plant of manufacture of the CPU. This form of support was dubbed &quot;Data Link / Hardware&quot;. The connection was made through a communications device called an IBM 2955 adapter, a stripped-down variant of the 2701 communications controller. It could connect at 600 bit/s to the RETAIN system to run diagnostics. Mainly, this was to run mostly the same diagnostics that could be run locally by an IBM CE, but in time other specialized applications were developed, such as programs to analyze &quot;logouts&quot; generated by hardware malfunctions, i.e. &quot;machine check&quot; interruptions.

In time, the concept of remote support was extended to software as well (about 1973 or 1974). Through a special application, an MVS system could be connected, via RETAIN, to an IBM support center, and memory dumps and other system data could be examined remotely. The application also permitted download of software fixes, or IBM Program temporary fixes. Although the 2955 only supported a 6-bit character code (similar to the 2740 terminal), binary transfer of memory dump and software updates was accomplished through a protocol similar to the base-64 encoding scheme used today on the Internet for email attachments.

Over the years, several projects have aimed to supplant RETAIN&#x27;s functionality, but it has shown lasting presence despite them.

<doc id="1258121" wikidata="Q5500879" url="?curid=1258121" title="Free-form radio">
<text>Free-form, or free-form radio, is a radio station programming format in which the disc jockey is given wide or total control over what music to play, regardless of music genre or commercial interests. Freeform radio stands in contrast to most commercial radio stations, in which DJs have little or no influence over programming structure or playlists. In the United States, freeform DJs are still bound by Federal Communications Commission regulations.

==History in the United States==
Many shows claim to be the first free-form radio program, but the earliest on record is &quot;Nightsounds&quot; on KPFA-FM in Berkeley, California, D.J.&#x27;d by John Leonard. Probably the best-remembered in the Midwest is Beaker Street, which ran for almost 10 years on KAAY &quot;The Mighty 1090&quot; in Little Rock, Arkansas, beginning in 1966, making it also probably the best-known such show on an AM station; its signal reached from Canada to Mexico and Cuba, blanketing the Midwest and Midsouth of the U.S. WFMU is currently the longest-running freeform radio station in the United States. WNEW-FM 102.7 in NYC was the first commercial station in the US to introduce a free-form format. It stayed that way under the ownership of Metromedia Broadcasting until it was sold and the new owners were not interested. WNEW-FM was a leader in introducing new music and making household names of a good deal of the bands we know from the 1960s and &#x27;70s. Jim Ladd of KLOS in Los Angeles, California was one of the most notable freeform DJs. Tom Petty wrote a song about Jim Ladd called &quot;The Last DJ&quot;. The only time Jim Ladd didn&#x27;t have complete control over what music is being played is when he turned control over to his faithful listeners commonly referred to as &quot;The Tribe&quot;.
On October 26, 2011, Ladd was among various staffers let go from KLOS following the acquisition of station owner Citadel Broadcasting by Cumulus Media. From 2012 until shortly before his death in 2023, Ladd hosting a daily freeform show on Sirius XM&#x27;s Deep Tracks.

The free-form ethos tends to disdain playlists confined to a single music genre. However, DJs may opt to play selections according to an arbitrary theme (e.g., Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; followed by Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;). Freeform-ish stations that played only or almost only rock music were known as progressive rock stations, while those that play mostly folk and/or country-leaning cuts are known as Americana stations.

Commercial free-form radio stations were common in the late 1960s and early &#x27;70s, particularly on the FM band, but are rare today. An exceptional case was Indie 103.1 FM of Santa Monica and Newport Beach, California. Indie 103.1 broadcast radio programs in which famous musicians from the world of popular music host radio programs and choose the playlist. Indie 103.1 recently left the FM airwaves, but currently continues on the internet.

Another commercial free-form radio station is KHUM, &quot;radio without the rules&quot;, at 104.3 and 104.7 FM in Ferndale, California. KHUM has transmitted since 1996 and is the most popular station in Humboldt County, California.

Internet radio and, to a lesser extent, college radio are sanctuaries of the free-form format (although even the latter has lost much of its independence as stations begin modeling corporate stations in their presentation). On Sirius XM satellite radio, the weekly Bob Dylan-hosted &quot;Theme Time Radio Hour&quot; featured a freeform format, as do several specialty programs on The Loft. The nationally syndicated &quot;The Mainstream&quot;, distributed by Native Voice One, follows a freeform format. Many terrestrial freeform stations are small and lack corporate backing, and therefore have relatively weak radio transmitters (especially around metropolitan areas where corporate radio signals dominate, but at the same time have enough of a population density to cover enough people to support such a station), a problem that has caused numerous broadcasters to transition to Internet radio, pirate radio or both.

The full service format can be seen as a variant of the free-form format, though since most full-service stations are located in rural areas, country music, adult standards, classic hits (oldies or classic rock), and occasionally adult contemporary music tend to form the bulk of the music on a full-service station, and the vast majority of full-service stations focus primarily on mainstream, popular music (whereas freeform stations often put the emphasis on less widely known or more exotic selections).

==Adult hits/Jack FM==
The adult hits brand can be considered a &quot;sequel&quot; of sorts to the freeform format. Many of these stations play a wide variety of music ranging from many formats that includes, but is not limited to: Oldies/classic hits, classic rock, adult contemporary, Mainstream Top 40/Adult Top 40, etc. Most of the music played on these stations are from the years 1970–2020, although a few 1960s tracks may be sprinkled in. Unlike freeform radio, adult hits stations emphasize familiar hit songs from researched playlists, and sometimes operate without disk jockeys.

The most notable adult hits station brand is Jack FM, which has many affiliates across the world. Several imitators of the Jack brand and its associated slogan &quot;Playing What We Want&quot; have also emerged. These imitators often use the name of a person, place or a historical site and can include: Mac (E.G. Mac 94.7 Clinton, Iowa) historical figures (E.G. The Chief 92.5 Champaign, Illinois), etc.

==Freeform radio vs. eclectic radio==

Eclectic radio describes radio programming encompassing diverse music genres. Unlike freeform radio, the eclectic radio format involves prescribed playlists. While freeform radio stands in contrast to commercial radio formats, a number of commercial radio stations offer programs showcasing an eclectic variety of music. While Eclectic radio, like free-form is mainly limited to North America, the digital radio stations BBC Radio 6 Music and Double J operated by the BBC and the ABC in the UK and Australia respectively resemble attempts at a similar broader format with both having a wide range of music played. 

Some eclectic radio stations in the United States are:
*KCRW (Santa Monica, California)
*KEOS (College Station, Texas)
*KEXP (Seattle, Washington)
*KFAI (Minneapolis, Minnesota)
*KGLT (Bozeman, Montana)
*KNYE (Pahrump, Nevada)
*KGSR (Austin, Texas)
*KPIG (Freedom, California)
*KUOM (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota)
*KXUA (Fayetteville, Arkansas)
*WERS (Boston, Massachusetts)
*WHPK (University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois)
*WJCU (University Heights, Ohio)
*WMLB (Avondale Estates, Georgia)
*WUSM (Hattiesburg, Mississippi)
*WRAS (Atlanta, Georgia)
*WXPN (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)
*WNCW (Spindale, North Carolina)
*The Loft (Sirius XM)

The second Kid Quantum was James&#x27; sister Jazmin Cullen, who underwent surgery to augment her power and no longer have to use the belt. Despite initial hostility from the Legion&#x27;s members, she was eventually elected leader of the team and later entered a relationship with Cosmic Boy.

===Post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===
An alternate universe incarnation of James Cullen / Kid Quantum appears in &quot;&quot; as one of several variants of Monarch who were killed by him.

In &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot;, Jazmin returns from limbo to fight the Legion of Super-Villains.

<doc id="1258132" wikidata="Q4658668" url="?curid=1258132" title="A Number">
<text>A Number is a 2002 play by British playwright Caryl Churchill. The story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) – two of whom are clones of the first one. The play addresses the subject of human cloning and identity, especially nature versus nurture. Many critics over the years have lauded &quot;A Number&quot;, arguing Churchill created a work of significant intellectual depth with effective economy of style.

==Contextual information==
&quot;A Number&quot; was first produced in 2002 at the Royal Court Theatre, London.

The play was written during a time of public debate over the ethics of cloning. The cloning of Dolly the sheep, the creation of human embryos at Advanced Cell Technology, and the cloning of a kitten gave rise to controversy concerning possible human cloning.

==Plot synopsis==

Scene 1: Bernard 2 (&quot;B2&quot; in the script) has discovered that he is one of a number of clones. Salter explains that he agreed to a cloning experiment to try again at parenting his first son, who had died, but, unbeknownst to Salter, the doctors unethically made several more clones. Salter decides that they should sue the doctors, which soothes the shaken Bernard 2.

Scene 2: An angry Bernard 1 (&quot;B1&quot;) visits Salter for the first time since his childhood. We learn that Salter sent him to a clinical home after the suicide of his mother had left them both in a constant state of fear and pain. B1 has learned about the clones, and is furious at his father for doing it, as well as for his neglectful and traumatic upbringing. Salter admits that the clones were meant to give him another chance at raising a child without repeating his many parental mistakes. B1 grows increasingly agitated and threatens to murder B2.

Scene 3: B2 speaks to Salter after having met B1 in the park. He has learned the truth about the situation, and now hates Salter for what he has done. B2 decides to leave the country for a while, both to get away from Salter and because he fears that B1 might try to kill him. Salter tries to convince him not to go, or at least to come back soon, but B2 refuses.

Scene 4: B1 tells Salter that when B2 left the country, B1 followed him and killed him. Salter, stricken with grief, demands to know the details, but B1 says little.

Scene 5: Salter is meeting with one of the other clones of his son, Michael Black. We learn that Bernard 1 has killed himself, and Salter is now planning to meet with the other clones. Michael, who never knew Salter, is a happily married maths teacher with three children. He is completely undisturbed that he is a clone, and tells Salter that he does not care. Salter finds this very unsettling. He demands to know more about him, something personal and unique, but Michael can only answer superficially and Salter is left unsatisfied.

==Characters==
*Salter: a man in his early sixties. He was married and had one son, named Bernard. His wife committed suicide by throwing herself under a train when their son was only two. Salter attempted to raise their son alone, but was neglectful due to his drinking and the son&#x27;s issues, and eventually sent his son away. He then had his son cloned, creating Bernard 2, in an attempt to try raising him again and being a better father. He has attempted to hide the truth of what he&#x27;s done from his sons, and the story is driven by the facts coming to light.
*Bernard (B2): Salter&#x27;s son, thirty-five, cloned from Bernard 1 to replace him. He is very mild-mannered and emotional.
*Bernard (B1): Salter&#x27;s son, forty. First and original son of Salter. He was a difficult and disturbed child who was neglected by Salter and then sent away when he was 4. He grew to have an explosive temper and to hate Salter for what he did.
*Michael Black: Salter&#x27;s son, thirty-five. An unauthorized clone of Salter’s first son. He is married with three children, the oldest aged twelve, and is a mathematics teacher.

==Staging==
Churchill gives no stage directions and no indication of a setting for the play. In the 2002 production, the stage was described by one critic as a “bare blank design” with “no relation to domestic realism.” The costumes of the play were as simple as the stage design. Salter always wore a rumpled looking suit, sometimes expensive looking, but sometimes not. The various Bernards usually wore jeans and a T-shirt, but sometimes a sweatshirt.

==Productions==

===Original production===
The play debuted at the Royal Court Theatre in London on 23 September 2002. The production was directed by Stephen Daldry and designed by Ian MacNeil and featured the following cast:
* Salter – Michael Gambon
* Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black – Daniel Craig

Lighting was designed by Rick Fisher and Ian Dickinson was the sound designer. The play won the 2002 Evening Standard Award for Best Play.

===Revivals===
The play was revived at the Sheffield Crucible studio in October 2006 starring real-life father and son Timothy West and Samuel West. This production later played at the Chocolate Factory in 2010 and at the Fugard Theatre, Cape Town in 2011.

The play was revived at The Nuffield Theatre (Southampton) in February 2014 with John and Lex Shrapnel to huge critical acclaim. It transferred to the Young Vic Theatre in June 2015. Zinnie Harris directed the play at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh in April 2017.

The play was revived again at the Bridge Theatre, in February 2020, with Roger Allam and Colin Morgan, directed by Polly Findlay.

The play received a London revival in January 2022 at The Old Vic, with Lennie James and Paapa Essiedu, directed by Lyndsey Turner. The production received a Laurence Olivier Award nomination for Best Revival in the same year.

===US premiere===
In 2004, the play made its American debut at the New York Theatre Workshop in a production starring Sam Shepard (later played by Arliss Howard) and Dallas Roberts.

===LA/OC, California premiere===
In February/March 2009, the play made its Los Angeles/Orange County debut at the Rude Guerrilla Theater Company in a production directed by Scott Barber, starring Vince Campbell and Mark Coyan.

==Reception==
Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;A Number&quot; as &quot;stunning&quot; and &quot;a gripping dramatic consideration of what happens to autonomous identity in a world where people can be cloned&quot;. James M. Brandon had mixed sentiments in &quot;Theatre Journal&quot;, arguing that while it &quot;is a wellwritten play—evocative, disturbing, and with more than one surprise—it remains a troubled one that seems, in production, unfinished. &quot; The critic disputed comparisons of the broken dialogue to that of David Mamet and said that &quot;the language here is not nearly as compelling on the stage&quot;. However, Brandon praised the final scene as &quot;brilliant&quot; and said that one of its characters &quot;serves as a welcome reminder that it is possible to have an ostensibly normal life&quot;, ultimately describing &quot;A Number&quot; as &quot;one of the more intellectually vital scripts to emerge in the new century&quot; despite shortcomings.

In a 2006 review of a later Churchill work, &quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s Paul Taylor described the play as one of the best dramas of the new millennium, and as &quot;superbly compressed and economic&quot;. After watching a performance featuring John and Lex Shrapnel, Lyn Gardner of &quot;The Guardian&quot; dubbed the play &quot;[p]unchy, compact and endlessly inquisitive,&quot; arguing that it &quot;is no simple warning against the perils of science messing with nature, but a complex and humane study of parental guilt, regret and responsibility and what it really means to be a father or son.&quot; Conversely, Jane Shillings of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; argued, &quot;The highly wrought writing veers at times towards the mannered, leaving a faint sense that the style of Churchill’s play exceeds its substance, and the issue of cloning has lost its urgency&quot;. Don Aucoin of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; praised the way the playwright &quot;devotes no time to preamble or writerly throat-clearing, but plunges us straightaway into the play’s central dilemma&quot;. In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Chris Jones described &quot;A Number&quot; as &quot;masterfully written&quot;.

After seeing a 2020 Bridge Theatre performance, Nick Curtis of &quot;Evening Standard&quot; argued, &quot;If the background logistics are sketchy – who made the human copies, and why? – the relationships between Salter and his offspring, and their differing reactions to finding that they are not unique, are right on the money. [...] It’s almost exactly an hour long and the ending is abrupt, but Churchill packs more ideas and feeling into that time than most dramatists manage at twice the length.&quot; Clive Davis of &quot;The Times&quot;, however, panned the play as &quot;both too short and too long&quot; after seeing the same performance. Matt Wolf lauded &quot;A Number&quot; as a &quot;beautiful play&quot;, and wrote that it &quot;works not least as a thriller or bit of forensic detection, as Churchill plants clues prompting a reevaluation of the narrative at every turn.&quot; Arjun Neil Alim of &quot;The Independent&quot; stated that &quot;Churchill, a political playwright par excellence, tactfully references current events. [...] Are &#x27;Who are you?&#x27; and &#x27;What are you made from?&#x27; the same question? Churchill’s answer comes in the form of a character who defines himself by his deeds and his loved ones, rather than the circumstances of his birth.&quot; Andrzej Lukowski of &quot;Time Out&quot; called the play a &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

Steve Dinneen argued in &quot;City A.M.&quot; that the work &quot;is remarkable in the way it so gracefully touches upon the great philosophical questions without ever feeling didactic. A Number is no cold thought experiment, but a quiet rumination on human nature&quot;. Dineen wrote that Salter&#x27;s interludes &quot;say as much as an hour’s worth of dialogue&quot;. Franco Milazzo of &quot;Londonist&quot; summarised the play as asking &quot;what makes you you?&quot; Arifa Akbar of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that &quot;Churchill’s linguistic tics – of interruptions and half-finished sentences – create a hyperreal effect and enable Salter’s obfuscation&quot;. Richard Pahl of &quot;Northwest Herald&quot; billed &quot;A Number&quot; as an &quot;engaging meditation on human cloning, personal identity and the conflicting claims of nature and nurture&quot;. Pahl wrote that the work &quot;offers intellectual and emotional depth, and illustrates the ways people rationalize bad behavior and unthinkingly objectify others, including their own flesh and blood. It asks important questions.&quot;

==Interpretation==
Dinneen argued that the play is about &quot;our desire to be unique, for our lives to have meaning, for our imperfect minds and bodies to somehow achieve perfect ends.&quot; Pahl wrote that questions asked by the play are, &quot;If we had a do-over, could we atone for our mistakes? What is the value of a human life? What is the source of our individuality?&quot;

==Adaptations==
&quot;A Number&quot; was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television, in a co-production between the BBC and HBO Films. Starring Rhys Ifans and Tom Wilkinson, it was broadcast on BBC Two on 10 September 2008.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 416, commonly referred to as Highway 416 and as the Veterans Memorial Highway, is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that connects Highway 417 (Trans-Canada Highway) in Ottawa with Highway 401 between Brockville and Cornwall. The freeway acts as an important trade corridor from Interstate 81 between New York and Eastern Ontario via Highway 401, as well as the fastest link between Ottawa and Toronto. Highway 416 passes through a largely rural area, except near its northern terminus where it enters the suburbs of Ottawa. The freeway also serves several communities along its length, notably Spencerville and Kemptville.

Highway 416 had two distinct construction phases. Highway 416 &quot;North&quot; was the segment starting from an interchange at Highway 417 and bypassing the original route of Highway 16 into Ottawa (now Prince of Wales Drive) along a new right-of-way. Highway 416 &quot;South&quot; was the twinning of of Highway 16 New (a two-lane expressway constructed throughout the 1970s and finished in 1983 that bypassed the original Highway 16), plus a new Y interchange connecting to Highway 401 towards Kingston and Toronto. Sections of both opened throughout the late 1990s. Highway 416 was commemorated as the Veterans Memorial Highway on the 54th anniversary of D-Day in 1998. The final link was officially opened by a World War I veteran and local officials on September 23, 1999.

== Route description ==

Highway 416 begins at an interchange with Highway 401, branching to the north near the community of Johnstown in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville. This interchange only provides access to and from the west of Highway 401, but immediately north of it, a second interchange with the remaining section of Highway 16 provides access from Johnstown and to a parclo interchange with both directions of Highway 401, as well as to the Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge crossing to Ogdensburg, New York.
Proceeding north, the two carriageways of the freeway are separated by a forested median.
The route is surrounded by thick forests for the next . As it passes beneath Leeds and Grenville County Road 44, the original routing of Highway 16 (the Prescott Highway) south of Spencerville, it exits the forest and enters farm fields. The route travels to the east of the community, access to which is provided by an interchange at County Road 21, and crosses a swamp and the South Nation River.

Highway 416 crosses under the Prescott Highway a second time; to the north, the two remain roughly parallel but separated as they pass through a mix of farmland and forest. South of the community of Kemptville, the Prescott Highway crosses the route a third time, with an interchange connecting the two highways.
The freeway curves to the northeast, bypassing Kemptville and featuring an interchange with County Road 43 (formerly Highway 43).
It crosses the line of the old Bytown and Prescott Railway,
then curves to the northwest, providing an interchange with River Road. At the southeast corner of the River Road interchange is the Veterans Commemorative Park, dedicated in 2000 by the Royal Canadian Legion.

It crosses the Rideau River and enters the City of Ottawa. Aside from the first couple of kilometres north of the Rideau River, the majority of the freeway cuts through swaths of farmland which fill the Ottawa Valley. The median also becomes narrower. The freeway encounters an interchange with Dilworth Road and thereafter with Roger Stevens Drive, the latter providing access to North Gower.

Continuing north of Manotick through fields, Highway 416 is crossed by the Prescott Highway for the fourth and final time as that road turns northeast and travels into downtown Ottawa as Prince of Wales Drive. Shortly thereafter is an interchange with Brophy Drive / Bankfield Road; the latter provides access to the Prescott Highway / Prince of Wales Drive. Approaching urban Ottawa, the route passes alongside a large quarry, then jogs to the west along an S-curve, crossing the Jock River in the process. After this, an interchange with Fallowfield Road provides access to the suburb of Barrhaven which occupies portions of the land immediately east of the freeway. The route jogs back to the east along a second S-curve and passes through an aesthetically designed bridge while traveling alongside the Stony Swamp.

The final section of Highway 416 travels parallel to Cedarview Road, which was relocated for the freeway. The Stony Swamp lies west of the route while farmland lies to the east. At the northern end of the swamp is an interchange with West Hunt Club Road. The freeway continues through a section of greenspace before descending gently into a trench. It passes beneath Bruin Road and the Ottawa Central Railway while traveling alongside Lynwood Village in Bells Corners. The highway is crossed by Baseline Road and Richmond Road; the former provides an onramp to southbound Highway 416. The freeway ends at a directional T interchange with Highway 417 (the latter also known as &quot;The Queensway&quot; in Ottawa and also part of the Trans-Canada Highway) (Exit 131), just south of the Lakeview and Bayshore communities on the Ottawa River; downtown Ottawa is to the east and Kanata is to the west.

=== Design features ===
The Stony Swamp overpass at the southern entrance to Ottawa is a pre-tensioned concrete arch; the design, which allows the structure to cross the entire right of way with a single span, won the 1996 Award of Excellence from the Portland Cement Association. The bridge acts as a gateway to the National Capital Region and is the longest rigid frame bridge in Ontario with a span.
In the same vicinity, the freeway sinks below ground level in a trench; groundwater-retaining walls were installed to prevent the lowering of the water table in adjacent wetlands, therefore mitigating damage to them.

At the Jock River, southwest of Barrhaven, deposits of sensitive leda clay presented a challenge in designing the crossing for the freeway as well as the Canadian National Railway overpass to the north. It was feared that the weight of these structures could destabilize the clay deposits beneath and lead to landslides. In place of the standard heavier aggregate, lighter blast furnace slag, at half the weight, was substituted.

Sloped rock cuts line the side of the freeway in numerous locations. With the intent of reducing the severity of collisions against those cuts, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) tested out numerous alternatives to strike a cost-to-benefit balance. The standard slope used by the MTO is vertical, offset from the edge of the pavement by . The study concluded that although an initially higher investment would be required, the 2:1 sloped cut with grass overlaid produced the best results.

Since July 12, 2024, the speed limit is on most of its length, with the exception of on the North end of the highway and near the Highway 401 interchange, where the speed limit is .

== History ==
=== Highway 16 New ===
In 1966, the Department of Highways (DHO), predecessor to today&#x27;s MTO, published the Eastern Ontario Highway Planning Study, identifying the need for a controlled-access highway between Ottawa and Highway 401.
Highway 16, which passes over the geologically subdued St. Lawrence Lowlands, was selected over Highway 15, which crosses the undulating Canadian Shield to the west, as the ideal route for the new link.
Highway 16 was one of the first roads taken over by the expanding Department of Public Highways in 1918. The important corridor between the Trans-provincial Highway (Highway 2) and Ottawa was known as the Prescott Highway. In 1925, the road was given a numerical designation to supplement the name.
This highway served the low traffic volumes of the day, but as the number of vehicles increased over the first half of the 20th century, issues arose with the numerous private driveways along the route. To overcome this issue of abutting properties long-established on the old Highway 16 corridor, the DHO began purchasing a new right-of-way between Highway 401 and Century Road by late 1967 for a two-lane bypass of the original alignment, avoiding all the built-up areas that the original Highway 16 encountered. This route was designed to easily accommodate the eventual upgrade to a freeway when traffic volumes necessitated.

Construction of the super two, dubbed &quot;Highway 16 New&quot;, took place between 1969 and 1983. The Spencerville Bypass opened by 1971, connecting with the old highway in the south near Crowder Road and in the north near Ventnor Road.
By the end of 1973, the new highway was completed from immediately north of Highway 401 through Leeds and Grenville United Counties and into Ottawa–Carleton. This included a bypass around Kemptville and a new structure over the Rideau River. The new highway ended at Dilworth Road (Regional Road 13).

For nearly a decade, no new construction took place. Then, during the summer of 1982, the MTO awarded a contract to construct the route north from Dilworth Road towards Manotick, bypassing North Gower and extending the route as far north as Roger Stevens Drive (Regional Road 6), including a structure over Stevens Creek. Following completion of this first contract, a second contract was awarded for the remaining distance north to Century Road (Regional Road 8).
The project was completed in 1983, merging into the original route of Highway 16 northeast of the present Prince of Wales Drive overpass.
With the completion of Highway 16 New, the MTO needed only to construct interchanges and the southbound lanes in order to create a full freeway corridor. The upgrade to Highway 416 took place between 1989 and 1999 and was carried out through two separate projects: Highway 416 North was a freeway on a new alignment through Ottawa and an interchange at Highway 417, and Highway 416 South was the twinning of of Highway 16 New and an interchange at Highway 401.

=== Change of plans ===
The original plans for Highway 416, conceived during the late 1960s, had it enter Ottawa along the &quot;Merivale Corridor&quot; to merge with the Queensway approximately east of the present interchange. However, when it came time to construct this section, public attitudes had shifted and environmental concerns had come to the forefront of everyday life; new roads were now subject to intense public scrutiny. Suburbs grew along Merivale Road, prompting the Region of Ottawa–Carleton to request the MTO decommission the right-of-way along the road in 1977, which it did. The passing of the Environmental Assessment Act in 1975, however, meant that new projects were subject to a lengthy investigation of social and environmental concerns.

In 1981, the MTO began an environmental assessment into a new alignment for the northern connection with the Queensway. It was approved in mid-1987, with Cedarview Drive chosen as the ideal alignment for the new freeway. The MTO set out to design a four-lane route to connect the Queensway with Highway 16 New, including a three-level free-flow interchange. A contract for construction of this interchange was awarded in late 1989 and construction began in 1990. During the 1991 construction season, contracts were awarded to construct several overpasses along the new route.
This contract was completed in 1993, after which budgetary restraints prevented the awarding of further contracts. As a result, aside from the interchange at Highway 417 and some overpasses, construction activity on Highway 416 came to a standstill for two years.

It was during this period that the MTO undertook an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway 407 became a tolled highway and for a time it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway 416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this never happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost savings of over $7 million and several of the unique design features located along the length of the freeway.

=== Twinning and completion ===
Work resumed on Highway 416 North following the review. It was opened from Century Road to Hunt Club Road on July 16, 1996, and completed on July 31, 1997, with the opening of the interchange with Highway 417. The cost of this section was $196 million. On December 8, 1995, in North Gower, the provincial and federal governments announced a financing deal to ensure Highway 416 South was completed by 2000.
This section of the route was constructed through a process known as twinning in which a second carriageway is built parallel to an existing road. In addition, existing intersections were rebuilt as grade-separated interchanges.
With the right-of-way along Highway 16 New already purchased, construction was able to proceed without disruption to local properties or traffic.

The project was constructed through five contracts. The first was awarded to Tarmac Canada on June 10, 1996, calling for twinning of from Century Road south to Roger Stevens Drive. Another contract was awarded one month later to Bot Construction, on August 19. This contract involved the section from Roger Stevens Drive south to what was then Highway 43, a distance of . On June 12, 1997, the first section opened, connecting with the Ottawa Bypass at Century Road.
On July 10, the third contract was awarded to Armbro Construction to construct the section from Highway 43 south to Grenville County Road 20 (Oxford Station Road). Another contract followed on October 21 for the south to Grenville County Road 20 (Shanly Road) which was awarded to Bot Construction. The fifth and final contract was awarded to Armbro Construction on April 8, 1998, calling for the construction of the southern and the two flyover ramps at Highway 401. Instead of using Highway16&#x27;s existing Parclo interchange with Highway401 where some ramps had at-grade intersections, this was bypassed by a separate right-of-way so that Highway416 would meet Highway 401 at a new freeway-to-freeway interchange serving traffic to/from Kingston. Shortly before Highway416 reaches its southern terminus, an Y interchange was constructed for Highway16 to branch off where it continues as a short stub through Johnstown. 

The section between Roger Stevens Drive and what had now become Leeds and Grenville County Road 43, including a second crossing of the Rideau River, opened to traffic on June 26, 1998.
This was followed two months later by the section between Highway 43 and Oxford Station Road, which opened on August 24.

On the fifty-fourth anniversary of D-Day, June 6, 1998, then Transportation Minister Tony Clement unveiled two signs in Ottawa and formally declared the entire length of Highway 416 as the Veterans Memorial Highway, despite earlier reluctance from previous minister Al Palladini.
Six additional signs were also installed along the length of the route.
At the time, the Veterans Memorial Parkway in London already existed. Since then, two additional veterans highways have been named: on October 20, 2002, the Veterans Highway was designated in Halton Region along Regional Road 25;
on September 23, 2010, the Niagara Veterans Memorial Highway was designated in Niagara Falls along Regional Road 420.
A ceremony was held in Johnstown on September 23, 1999 to open the final section of Highway 416 that would complete the link from Highway 401 to Highway 417. Premier Mike Harris, Transportation Minister David Turnbull and World War I Veteran James W. Fraser officially opened the highway.

With the widening of Highway 417 from four/six lanes to eight lanes between Highway 416 and Palladium Drive, the ramp for incoming traffic from Highway 416 was extended as far as the Moodie Drive overpass, where it merges to the left side of the Highway 417 westbound carriageway. As a result, Highway 416 northbound motorists no longer have direct access to the Moodie Drive interchange, and now must take the exit to Holly Acres Road and then drive west on Richmond Road to reach Moodie Drive. 

On December 14, 2009, there was a 60–70 vehicle pileup due to fog and icy conditions, forcing the closure of the highway in both directions.

== Future ==
The Ontario government is fighting gridlock in south Ottawa by investing $5 million in a new interchange at Highway 416 and Barnsdale Road. The interchange will save commuters time in the rapidly growing community of Barrhaven and connect more people to housing and jobs across the region.
