<text>Michael Kelley (October 27, 1954 –  January 31, 2012) was an American artist whose work involved found objects, textile banners, drawings, assemblage, collage, performance, photography, sound and video. He also worked on curatorial projects; collaborated with many other artists and musicians; and left a formidable body of critical and creative writing. He often worked collaboratively and had produced projects with artists Paul McCarthy, Tony Oursler, and John Miller. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in 2012, Holland Cotter described the artist as &quot;one of the most influential American artists of the past quarter century and a pungent commentator on American class, popular culture and youthful rebellion.&quot;

==Early life==
Kelley was born in Wayne, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, to a working class Roman Catholic family in October 1954. His father was in charge of maintenance for a public school system; his mother was a cook in the executive dining room at Ford Motor Company. In his early years he was involved with the area&#x27;s music scene, which spawned bands such as Iggy and the Stooges, and was a member of the noise band Destroy All Monsters. In 1976, Kelley graduated from the University of Michigan and then moved to Los Angeles. In 1978, he graduated from the California Institute of the Arts with a Master of Fine Arts, where he admired the work of his teachers John Baldessari, Laurie Anderson, David Askevold and Douglas Huebler and fully embraced the ideals of the avant-garde.

==Work==
During his time at CalArts, Kelley started to work on a series of projects in which he explored works with loose poetic themes, such as &quot;The Sublime&quot;, &quot;Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Plato&#x27;s Cave, Rothko&#x27;s Chapel, Lincoln&#x27;s Profile&quot;, using a variety of different media such as drawing, painting, sculpture, performance, video, and writing. In the 1980s, he became known for working with another type of
material: crocheted blankets, fabric dolls and other rag toys found at thrift stores and yard sales. Perhaps the most famous work in this vein, &quot;More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid and The Wages of Sin&quot; from 1987, featured a mess of used rag dolls, animals and blankets strewn across a canvas, a way of investing a fictional childhood scene with some visceral pathos which was first shown at Rosamund Felsen Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1988, Kelley created an installation called &quot;Pay for Your Pleasure,&quot; which featured a gallery of portraits of men of genius – poets, philosophers and artists included – subverted at the end by a painting created by a convicted criminal. In &quot;From My Institution to Yours&quot; (1988) and &quot;Proposal for the Decoration of an Island of Conference Rooms&quot; (1992), Kelley appropriated photocopied drawings and other ephemera of vernacular office humor and moved it into more formalized environments where such crude materials are normally not seen.

Kelley often employed soft, tangled toys as a satirical metaphor for Expressionist art. In &quot;Deodorized Central Mass with Satellites&quot; (1991–99), an installation sculpture made from untidy clusters of toys suspended from the ceiling, a dozen monochrome plush-toy spheres, linked by a system of cables and pulleys across the ceiling, orbit around a central, rainbow-colored blob; ten large, geometrically faceted, brightly colored wall-reliefs are actually monumental dispensers of pine-scented air freshener, which automatically send their cleansing spray into the room at timed intervals.

In 1995, he produced &quot;Educational Complex&quot;, an architectural model of the institutions in which he had studied, including his Catholic elementary school and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. According to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the work&#x27;s selective inclusion of institutional locations and features responds to &quot;the rising infatuation of the public with issues of repressed memory syndrome and child abuse... The implication is that anything that can&#x27;t be remembered is somehow the result of trauma.&quot; In 1999, he made a short video in which Superman recites selections from Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;.

Kelley was in the band Poetics with fellow California Institute of the Arts students John Miller and Tony Oursler. In 1997–98, Kelley and Oursler presented the &quot;Poetics Project&quot; at Documenta X, as well as at venues in Los Angeles, New York, and Tokyo; through video projections, sound, and artworks, this installation re-created their experience at CalArts as members of a short-lived band. Along with his collaborations with Shaw and Oursler, Kelley was also known for working with artist Paul McCarthy in the 1990s. They collaborated on a series of video projects, including a 1992 work based on Johanna Spyri&#x27;s classic children&#x27;s book, &quot;Heidi&quot;. A 1986 Massachusetts Institute of Technology presentation of Kelley&#x27;s performance &quot;Plato&#x27;s Cave, Rothko&#x27;s Chapel, Lincoln&#x27;s Profile&quot; (1985) included a live performance by Sonic Youth; the band later featured his orange-knit creatures on the cover and booklet of their 1992 record &quot;Dirty&quot;. In 2010, he combined with Artangel to realize his first work of public art in Detroit.

In November 2005, Kelley staged &quot;Day is Done&quot;, filling Gagosian Gallery with funhouse-like multimedia installations, including automated furniture, as well as films of dream-like ceremonies inspired by high school year book photos of pageants, sports matches and theater productions. In December 2005, Village Voice art critic Jerry Saltz described &quot;Day is Done&quot; as a pioneering example of &quot;clusterfuck aesthetics,&quot; the tendency towards overloaded multimedia environments in contemporary art. &quot;Day is Done&quot; was Kelley &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;, this body of work was initiated with &#x27;Extracurricular Activity Projective Reconstruction #1 (Domestic Scene),
the work was produced by Emi Fontana and first exhibited in her gallery in Milano in 2000. In the same year Emi Fontana and Mike Kelley started a romantic relationship that lasted for seven years, and led to Fontana relocating to Los Angeles.

Begun in 1999, the &quot;Kandor&quot; project deals with the town of Kandor, on the planet Krypton from which the child Kal-El escaped to Earth, where he became Superman. Kandor&#x27;s depiction in these narratives is inconsistent and fragmentary, prompting Kelley to create multiple versions of it, cast in colorful resins and illuminated like reliquaries. &quot;Kandor 4&quot; (2007) includes a giant bell jar and an air compressor pump. The installation &quot;Kandor-Con 2000&quot; was first presented in the millennium show at Kunstmuseum Bonn and later at Technische Universität Berlin (2007), the Deichtorhallen/Sammlung Falckenberg, Hamburg (2007); ZKM, Karlsruhe (2008); the Shanghai Biennial (2008); and the Centre Pompidou, Paris (2010). &quot;Kandor-Con 2000&quot; is conceived – and continued to develop – as a work in progress. Throughout the exhibitions, architecture students built cardboard models of Kandor inspired by the original comics. These models were sent to Pasadena, where Kelley made scaled down casts. &quot;Kandor 10A&quot; (2010), a yellow city housed in a hand-blown, pink glass bottle, is a grouping of tall skyscrapers situated within a full-scale rock grotto. &quot;Kandor 10B (Exploded Fortress of Solitude)&quot; (2011) is a pile of dark boulders and slabs forming a cave with a quarry-like foyer made from faux black rock and built on a scale that invites the viewer into the forbidden fortress. Set within the cave&#x27;s inner recesses is a glowing rose-colored city-in-a-bottle. &quot;Kandor 12&quot;, constructed in off-white resin and evocative of a group of chess pawns, or minarets, is encased in a shadowy brown bottle, which sits on a platform resembling a Greek column positioned in front of a chest of drawers and an illuminated translucent green wall.

In 2004, Kelley&#x27;s exhibition and catalogue, &quot;Mike Kelley: The Uncanny&quot; at Tate Liverpool and Mumok featured Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Andy Warhol Robot.&#x27;&quot; Frieze (magazine) writes: &quot;Taking its cue from the resurgence of figurative sculpture in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and Sigmund Freud&#x27;s essay &#x27;The Uncanny&#x27; (1919), the exhibition brings together mannequin-related artworks, mostly from the 1960s onwards,&quot; including from ancient Egypt to the early 2000s. In Freud&#x27;s &#x27;The Uncanny,&#x27; he writes, &quot;It may be true that the uncanny is nothing else than a hidden, familiar thing that has undergone repression and then emerged from it.&quot; Kelley explores &quot;memory, recollection, horror and anxiety through the juxtaposition of a highly personal collection of objects with realist figurative sculpture.&quot; Kelley remarks in his essay for the exhibition, &quot;works develop a life of their own by virtue of their existence in the world outside of my control,&quot; and &quot;I had intended to rework the original essay for &#x27;The Uncanny,&#x27; &quot;Playing with Dead Things,&quot; into dialogue form for a theater piece but never got around to it,&quot; akin to Warhol&#x27;s urgings for his &quot;No-Man Show&quot; theater piece with Lewis Allen and Peter Sellars. Kelley also makes reference to Jack Burnham who writes, &quot;the liberalizing tendencies of modern art and the discoveries of archaeology finally compelled historians to consider the aesthetic merits of [substratum figures as a fine art] and an increasing range of other anthropomorphic forms,&quot; and Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel who shares, &quot;lying between life and death, animated and mechanic, hybrid creatures and creatures to which hubris gave birth, they all may be liked to fetishes.&quot;

In 2009, Kelley collaborated with longtime friend and fellow artist Michael Smith on &quot;A Voyage of Growth and Discovery&quot;, a six-channel video and sculptural installation piece. This piece was conceived in 2007 and curated by Emi Fontana, produced by Kelley himself and West of Rome Public Art. The work was first installed at the Sculpture Center, New York in 2009, The Farley Building (former Kelley studio) for West of Rome in 2010, and The BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art in 2011.

Also in 2009, Kelley participated in Performa 09, the third edition of the Performa Biennial, where he created &quot;Extracurricular Activity Projective Reconstruction #32, Plus.&quot; For this performance, Kelley translated his filmed material into highly energetic scenes of music and psychodynamic drama. 

The artist&#x27;s last performance video was &quot;Vice Anglais&quot; from 2011.

On January 31, 2012, Kelley committed suicide via carbon monoxide poisoning at his home in South Pasadena, California. It is believed that Kelley was suffering from depression at the time of his death. A spontaneous memorial to Kelley was built in an abandoned carport near his studio in the Highland Park section of L.A. shortly after news of his death. Mourners were invited via an anonymous Facebook page to &quot;help rebuild &quot;MORE LOVE HOURS THAN CAN EVER BE REPAID AND THE WAGES OF SIN&quot; (1987), by contributing stuffed fabric toys, afghans, dried corn, wax candles…building an altar of unabashed sentimentality.&quot; The memorial was active throughout February 2012 and was dismantled in early March 2012, with the contents given to the Mike Kelley Foundation.

Kelley&#x27;s work was inspired by diverse sources such as philosophy, politics, history, underground music, decorative arts and working-class artistic expression. His art often examined class and gender issues as well as issues of normality, criminality and perversion.

Kelley lived and worked in various places in Los Angeles, among them the Farley Building in Eagle Rock.

In 2018, the Mike Kelley Foundation collaborated with popular streetwear brand Supreme and released a collection of clothes. Supreme highlights the iconic imagery from the Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts, sourcing from works such as &quot;More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid and The Wages of Sin&quot;, &quot;Ahh…Youth!&quot; and &quot;Reconstructed History&quot;. Comprising a work shirt, work jacket, rayon shirt, two hoodies, a crewneck sweater, three T-shirt and eight skateboard decks, the Supreme x Mike Kelley collection dropped in September 6, 2018.

==Exhibitions==

Kelley began having regular solo exhibitions at Metro Pictures Gallery in Manhattan in 1982, and at Rosamund Felsen Gallery in Los Angeles the following year. He subsequently started to gain recognition outside Los Angeles in the mid-eighties with the sculptural objects and installations from the series &quot;Half-a-Man&quot;. In 2002, Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City showed &quot;Mike Kelley: Reversals, Recyclings, Completions, and Late Editions&quot; from November 2-December 7. In 2005, he had his first solo show at Gagosian Gallery in New York City, which was representing him at his death. A retrospective, &quot;Mike Kelley: Catholic Tastes,&quot; appeared at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1993 and traveled to Los Angeles and Munich; a second retrospective appeared at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona in 1997; and a third was at the Tate Liverpool in 2004. In 2006, his show &quot;Profondeurs Vertes&quot; was presented at the Musée du Louvre (2006). A major retrospective exhibition was held after the reopening of the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam in 2012, and traveled to the MOCA, Los Angeles in 2014. The many group exhibitions he participated in include the Whitney Biennial (1985, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 2002, and 2012), Venice Biennale (1988 and 1995), Carnegie International (1991), Documenta 9 and 10 (1992 and 1997), and SITE Santa Fe Biennial (2004).

In 2012, the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit received a grant to complete Kelley&#x27;s unfinished project &quot;Mobile Homestead&quot;, a large-scale replica of the artist&#x27;s home in suburban Detroit. The detachable facade of the home, set on a street-legal trailer, is meant to travel from city to city hosting art, educational and social services initiatives. During its exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, &quot;Mobile Homestead&quot; hosts a series of &quot;public service activations,&quot; including a lunch-making workshop led by the Local United Network to Combat Hunger, a School on Wheels donation drive, an American Red Cross Blood Services event and an L.A. Human Right to Housing Project/Community Action Network-hosted Rent Control Tenant Meeting.

The Watermill Center staged an award-winning exhibition of Kelley&#x27;s video and sound installations, as well as works from the &quot;Kandor&quot; series in 2012. The Exhibition, &quot;Mike Kelley: 1954-2012,&quot; was voted &quot;Best show in a non-profit gallery or alternative space&quot; in 2012 by the International Association of Art Critics.

On October 13, 2013, the largest exhibition of Kelley&#x27;s works opened in the MoMA PS1 in New York City. The exhibition titled, &quot;Mike Kelley&quot; included over 200 of his pieces from the 1970s until his death in 2012. This was the biggest exhibition of any kind that MoMA had organized since 1976.

On December 14, 2015, a selection of Kelley&#x27;s videos, from the sassy/melancholy Superman Recites Selections from &#x27;The Bell Jar&#x27; and Other Works by Sylvia Plath (1999) to the threatening histrionics of Extracurricular Activity Projective Reconstruction #1 (Domestic Scene) (2000), as well as collaborative pieces, such as his minimalist exploration of sado-masochistic relationships in 100 Reasons (1991) – among others will be screened at REDCAT in Los Angeles. From November 3 - December 23, 2016, Hauser &amp; Wirth in New York showed &quot;Mike Kelley: Memory Ware.&quot;

A large-scale retrospective &quot;Ghost and Spirit&quot; devoted to Kelley, opened at the Bourse de Commerce in Paris, Pinault Collection in 2023 (October 13, 2023 - February 19, 2024). The exhibition was organized by Tate Modern, London in collaboration with the Pinault Collection, Paris, K21 – Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf, and the Moderna Museet, Stockholm and will travel to all these venues after Paris.

The Mike Kelley Foundation currently has the 1987 piece “Deodorized Central Mass with Satellites” On display at The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), located in New York City. The piece itself features 13 hanging sculptures surrounding one large sculpture made from a varying assortment of stuffed animals stitched together, coded by color and with the faces sewn into the body of each sculpture. The piece was partially gifted to the MoMA by Peter M. Brant, of the Brant Foundation.

==Collections==
During the artist&#x27;s lifetime, German art-book publisher Benedikt Taschen and Los Angeles-based businessman Kourosh Larizadeh were the principal collectors who bought Kelley&#x27;s work in depth. In 2001, Kelley himself donated three works by fellow artists William Leavitt, Franz West and Jim Isermann to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.

<doc id="1246000" wikidata="Q847176" url="?curid=1246000" title="Porthcurno">
<text>Porthcurno (, meaning &quot;pinnacle cove&quot;, see below) is a small village covering a small valley and beach on the south coast of Cornwall, England in the United Kingdom. It is the main settlement in a civil and an ecclesiastical parish, both named St Levan, which comprise Porthcurno, diminutive St Levan itself, Trethewey and Treen.

It is centred west of the railway, market, and resort town of Penzance and from Land&#x27;s End, the most westerly point of the English mainland. Road access is via the north end of the valley along a long cul-de-sac with short branches off the B3283 and land traditionally associated with the village, including its beach, is on the South West Coast Path.

==Amenities and homes==
The village comprises houses and apartment blocks together with a few commercial premises along the access road known as &quot;The Valley&quot;. The road curves inland past Minack Point to St. Levan&#x27;s Church about from the village. At the southern end are:
*Large public car park
*A small seasonal café 
*A public house.
*The South West Coast Path

The route is marked as two hours from Land&#x27;s End or about four hours walk from Penzance for the most agile cliff-side path walkers.

A low-frequency bus service links Penzance, Lands End and nearby villages and hamlets including Newlyn, Paul, Sheffield, Lamorna, St Buryan, Treen, Trethewey, Polgigga and Sennen.

Porthcurno is largely not farms or fisherman&#x27;s cottages today, having its linear centre inland, centred west of the railway, market, and resort town of Penzance and from Land&#x27;s End, the most westerly point of the English mainland. In most local-level organisational and community bodies, it is in civil and ecclesiastical parishes named Saint Levan and usually spelled as St Leven since the 18th century.

==The Cable Station and Engineering College==
Porthcurno is unusually well known for its size because of its history as a major international submarine communications cable station. In the late nineteenth century, the remote beach at Porthcurno became internationally famous as the British termination of early submarine telegraph cables, the first of which was landed in 1870, part of an early international link stretching from the UK to India, which was then a British colony. Porthcurno was chosen in preference to the busy port of Falmouth because of the reduced risk of damage to the cables caused by ships&#x27; anchors. In 1872, the Eastern Telegraph Company (ETC) Limited was formed which took over the operation of the cables and built a cable office in Porthcurno valley. The concrete cable hut, where the cable shore ends were connected to their respective landlines, is a listed building and still stands at the top of the beach. ETC and its cable operations expanded through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in 1928 to merge with Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph Company Limited to form Imperial and International Communications Limited which was renamed Cable and Wireless Limited in 1934. Cable and Wireless Limited was a predecessor company of Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide and Cable &amp; Wireless Communications.

In the inter-war years, the Porthcurno cable office operated as many as 14 cables, for a time becoming the largest submarine cable station in the world, with the capacity to receive and transmit up to two million words a day. Porthcurno is still known colloquially by the acronym &#x27;PK&#x27; being represented in Morse code as &#x27;di-dah-dah-dit&#x27; followed by &#x27;dah-di-dah&#x27;, communicating with a line operator and testing connections, an acronym often sent.

Over the years, many apprentices were trained at the Porthcurno cable office in telegraphy and supporting skills, initially by ETC and then by Cable and Wireless. In 1950 the latter, nationalised, opened its Porthcurno engineering college which provided many courses in branches of telecommunications for employees, secondees and external students. The cable office closed in 1970, exactly 100 years after the first cable was landed, but the college remained open, receiving substantial investment in buildings and training equipment through the 1970s and 1980s; however, due to its isolation from towns, it closed in 1993. Some of its buildings were demolished. After the closure of the college, the award-winning Porthcurno Telegraph Museum was opened. This museum has been featured locally and nationally on educational programmes, including the BBC TV documentary series &quot;What the Victorians Did for Us&quot; and &quot;Coast&quot;. It occupies some of the former college buildings and includes many exhibits, in &#x27;The Tunnel&#x27;.

==World War II tunnels==
The cable office at Porthcurno was a critical communications centre and considered at serious risk of attack during the Second World War, being only about from the port of Brest in occupied France. To improve security, a network of two parallel tunnels, connected by two smaller cross-tunnels, was bored into the granite valley east side by local tin mining labourers, starting in June 1940, to accommodate the essential telegraph equipment. Each of the two main entrances was protected by offset double bomb-proof and gas-proof doors. To provide evacuation for staff in case the defences failed, a covert emergency escape route was provided by granite steps cut into a steeply rising fifth tunnel leading from the rear cross tunnel to a concealed exit in the fields above.

Each of the main tunnel interiors was that of a windowless open-plan office constructed as a building shell within the granite void, complete with a pitched roof to collect water seepage from the rocks, a false ceiling, plastered and decorated walls, and all the necessary services. In total about 15,000 tons of rock were removed to construct the tunnels. The construction work progressed relentlessly day and night, taking nearly a year, and the completed tunnels were opened in May 1941 by Lady Wilshaw who was the wife of Sir Edward Wilshaw, Chairman of Cable and Wireless at the time.

The concrete defences around the tunnel entrances and the nearby buildings were camouflaged with the help of a local artist: the design, when viewed from the air with some imagination, resembled a belt of trees, complete with rabbits and birds. The tunnel environment being secure, dry, and at a virtually constant temperature proved to be ideal for the sensitive telegraph equipment and it continued to house the subsequently upgraded equipment after the war until the cable office closure in 1970. It was then used for training facilities for the Engineering College until the college itself also closed in 1993. Today the tunnel houses exhibits of, and is itself an exhibit of, the Museum of Global Communications, operated by PK Porthcurno.

==Porthcurno coastal area==

The cliffs and coastline around Porthcurno are officially designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Part of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and widely considered as some of the most visually stunning in the United Kingdom.

Porthcurno Beach and bay enclosed by the Logan Rock headland has been listed among the ten most beautiful bays in the World. The cliffs are enjoyed by walkers using the many public footpaths in the area and the protected South West Coastal Footpath passes through the area often within just a few yards of the clifftops. Coastal areas around Porthcurno, including those formerly owned by Cable and Wireless, are now owned, preserved and maintained by the National Trust and the remainder by the local parish council on behalf of Cornwall Council. The nearby cliffs rise to 60 m to 70 m above mean sea level and are formed from a bedrock of prismatic granite; over the geological timescales having been eroded, shaped and divided vertically and horizontally sometimes almost into rounded cubic blocks.

An ancient bridleway, probably an early route to Porthcurno beach via the nearby Trendrennen Farm, about half a mile to the east of the village, has been opened by the Ramblers Association. This was probably used by horse-drawn carts to collect seaweed which was used for land fertilisation.

Porthcurno Beach and Bay, a few hundred yards south of the village is situated in the shelter of the Logan Rock headland just less than to the east. The beach is noted for its sand of crushed, white sea shells, privacy, and isolation rather than the movement of ships. Porthcurno Bay has been described as &quot;floored by glorious white sand that shines through translucent water&quot;. Sometimes combinations of wind, tides and sea currents can change the &#x27;sandscape&#x27; dramatically in a few hours, but the volume of sand is sufficient that it is unusual for the beach to be completely inundated by the sea at high tide. To the immediate east of Porthcurno beach, on the other side of Percella Point is a small tidal beach called Green Bay. Sometimes this is accessible with caution from Porthcurno Beach at low tide.
Another tidal beach called Pedn Vounder lies further to the east between Porthcurno and the Logan Rock headland for which footpath access is by a steep and rugged path leading down from the cliff path. Often a sand bank forms off Pedn Vounder at low tide. Unlike the nearby fishing coves of Penberth and Porthgwarra, about to the east and west respectively, Porthcurno has no known recent history of commercial fishing activity.

==Demography==
==White pyramid==
About halfway along the main coastal footpath from Porthcurno to Logan Rock another path loops off to the cliffs above Pedn Vounder beach. Beside this is a pyramid built from granite blocks and painted white, about tall. For navigation, it replaced a brightly coloured hut which housed the termination of another submarine telegraph cable connected to the French port of Brest owned by &quot;La Compagnie Française de Telegraphe de Paris à New York&quot;, which was laid in 1880. Overhead lines carried the signals to and from Penzance which had the cable office. Some of the stone ducting which was built up on the cliffside to protect the cable is still visible from the footpath nearby. This was part of the first cable connection from the UK to the American continent passing from Porthcurno to Brest and then via the trans-Atlantic cable first to Saint-Pierre and Miquelon near the coast of Canada, and then a further to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In 1919, another &quot;Compagnie Française&quot; cable was laid to Porthcurno but this was terminated in the Cable Hut at the top of the beach a few hundred yards to the west where it remained in operation until 1962.
==Logan Rock==
The Logan Rock headland, about 30 minutes&#x27; walk from Porthcurno to the east along the coastal footpath around Porthcurno Bay is famous for the 80 ton granite rocking stone (Logan Rock) perched at the top of the middle outcrop of rocks on the small rocky peninsula. Millennia of erosion had balanced it so finely that one person could move it easily. In 1824, a group of sailors led by Lieutenant Hugh Calville Goldsmith, nephew of the poet Oliver Goldsmith, and the worse for drink climbed up to Logan Rock armed with crowbars and dislodged it, allowing it to fall down the cliff. Such was the disgust of the local people at this blatant act of vandalism, that they complained to the Admiralty and Goldsmith was ordered to replace the rock at his own expense. It took seven months, 60 labourers and cost Goldsmith £130 8s d at 1824 prices () to replace it. The original invoice for equipment and labour is now displayed on the wall of The Logan Rock public house in the nearby village of Treen.

Just to the north of the peninsula is evidence of an Iron Age cliff fort called Treryn Dinas, a scheduled monument comprising about five ramparts, ditches and some evidence of round dwelling huts. There is a small rocky island off the Logan Rock peninsula called Horrace and another smaller granite island called Great Goular which is only visible at low tide.

==Climate and tourism==
The prevailing wind is from the southwest and the winters are unusually mild for its latitude because of the influence of the warm Gulf Stream sea current crossing the Atlantic Ocean from warmer seas around the Gulf of Mexico. The local area has some of the highest &quot;average&quot; annual air temperatures of the United Kingdom. In common with much of the south Cornish coast, summer daily maxima rarely exceed about 25 degrees Celsius (77 °F) and below-freezing temperatures and frost are uncommon. The lower valley and beach enjoy a micro-climate being sheltered from winds in most directions. For the more exposed cliff-top areas, gale-force winds are common throughout the year which occasionally cause moderate structural damage to buildings locally.

In the summer months, Porthcurno is popular with families on holiday with young children who enjoy playing on the beach and perhaps some supervised bathing, as the beach is prone to strong rip currents. In the quieter seasons visitors tend to be local people and day-trippers from other parts of Cornwall. Many tourists come from elsewhere in the United Kingdom and abroad and may have rented self-catering or bed and breakfast accommodation nearby. The Porthcurno Telegraph Museum and the Minack Theatre, both bring visitors to the area.

==History==

===Porthkornow, Porthcornow===

The name Porthcurno evolved from the 16th century Cornish spelling &#x27;Porth Cornowe&#x27;. In the Cornish language &quot; (standard written form uses &quot;c&quot;) meant &#x27;cove/landing place of horns or pinnacles&#x27;, a reference to the granite rock formations in the vicinity. Some evidence of early commercial port activity exists in the remains of man-made stone tracks for horse-drawn vehicles which may have provided access to the beach, visible on one of the footpaths near the south side of the car park ascending the east side of the valley.

===Industrial and wartime developments===
Development of the area was dominated for over one hundred years by the operations of the cable station owned by Cable and Wireless plc and its predecessor companies. Probably over 90% of the inhabitants were either employees of Cable and Wireless or were directly supported by it. 

During the Second World War, Porthcurno was designated a &quot;Vulnerable Point&quot; and was heavily defended and fortified as a part of British anti-invasion preparations. At the beginning of the war a small guard of special constables was put on duty at the cable office and cable house, later superseded by a platoon of soldiers who camped on a former bowling green. Porthcurno Valley was declared a protected place and as many as 300 troops were deployed in the immediate area to guard the station. Passes were issued to residents and visitors who had business to be in the area and many mock attacks were staged. The defences included pillboxes and a petroleum warfare beach flame barrage which could be operated remotely from the tunnel. At the end of the War, although some 867 bombs fell in the (Penzance) area and 3,957 houses were damaged or destroyed, the only damage suffered by any communications equipment at Porthcurno was the destruction of an antenna when a bomb fell at Rospletha Farm, located at the top of the hill about half a mile to the west of the cable office.

===Submarine optical fibre cables===
Porthcurno&#x27;s association with international telecommunications links continues to the present day. The first successors to submarine telegraph cables were submarine telephony cables of coaxial construction, some of which were landed at Porthcurno. In the last twenty years or so these have all been superseded by their very high-capacity modern descendants, those using fibre optic technology as the transmission medium instead of copper. These also have been landed at Porthcurno forming a significant link, part of the UK connection to the international telecommunications &#x27;backbone&#x27; infrastructure. These form parts of international cable networks and include systems known as Trans-Atlantic Telephone Cable 12/13 (TAT-12/13), Gemini, Fibre-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG), and RIOJA. Each of these has thousands of times the capacity of all of their predecessors&#x27; cables put together. However, all of the successors of the telegraph cables today use Porthcurno merely as a shore landing-point for connecting to the national telecommunications network, passing directly via landlines buried under the local roads to a terminating station at Skewjack about inland from Porthcurno.

Much of the beach and surrounding shores previously owned by Cable and Wireless was donated to the National Trust in 1993.

Many of the houses built for the former Engineering College have been converted to holiday flats, making the population very seasonally dependent. Today the major industry in the area is tourism.

===Church of St Levan===

The 12th and 15th-century church of St Levan is between St Levan proper and Porthcurno, towards the end of the cul-de-sac main village road. It has medieval foundations and is adjoined by a graveyard which has two of the parish&#x27;s six stone crosses and a small car park. It sits close to the coast path, lightly wooded slopes and adjoins pasture meadows. The largely unadulterated exterior has featured in the BBC drama &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Minack Theatre==

Narrowly out of sight of Porthcurno beach in the cliff face to the west is the Minack Theatre, a unique open-air theatre with a unique stage backdrop of Porthcurno Bay and the Logan Rock headland. It is an unusual setting for plays staged during the summer months ranging from the traditional Shakespeare to the more contemporary. The theatre is accessible on foot from the coastal footpath by a rugged path in the cliff face or more easily by road taking the steep narrow hill leaving Porthcurno to the south towards St. Levan Church and turning left at the top. It was built virtually single-handedly by the late Rowena Cade who worked there into her eighties with the support of local labourers. Today the Rowena Cade exhibition centre, coffee shop and theatre are open to visitors for most of the year except during performances.

==Wireless Point==

A small headland to the west of the Minack Theatre called Pedn-men-an-Mere, which is now owned by The National Trust, (Cornish: &#x27;rocky headland by the sea&#x27;) is known locally as &#x27;Wireless Point&#x27;. Here, exposed areas of granite bedrock and concrete plinths retain the preserved remains of the base and guy wire tether points of a wireless telegraphy antenna mast that was erected in 1902 by the Eastern Telegraph Company. It was thought that this was used to &#x27;spy&#x27; on the early wireless transmissions by Marconi, a developer of radio, from the Poldhu cliff top about to the east, across Mount&#x27;s Bay on the west side of the Lizard Peninsula. In those days Marconi&#x27;s &#x27;wireless telegraphy&#x27; was seen as a potential threat to the established &#x27;cable and line telegraphy&#x27; on which the security of Porthcurno and many jobs depended. A small hut was built nearby to house the early wireless equipment and remained there for a further 21 years. The company mistakenly concluded that Marconi&#x27;s efforts posed no threat to their cable business. Marconi&#x27;s secretive development of the Shortwave Beam Wireless System at Poldhu would be so successful that Eastern and many other cable telegraph companies were forced into near-bankruptcy by 1928.

There is a pair of large boulders near the cliff edge of which the smaller one, weighing about 5 tons, can be rocked by the weight of one adult.

==Cornish wrestling==
Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, were held in Porthcurno in the 1800s.

==Porth Chapel beach==

Pedn-men-an-Mere overlooks the small secluded tidal beach of Porth Chapel to the west. Porth Chapel beach is named after the remains of a Christian site and medieval chapel visible next to the footpath about above the beach. There is a spring known as the St. Levan Holy Well up on the cliff which may be reached by restored medieval granite steps. The steps were covered for many years but were discovered in 1931 by the Reverend HT Valantine and Dr Vernon Favel. They were restored in 2003, part of a Cornwall County Council restoration project, and were opened by Sophie, Countess of Wessex.
==Notable residents==
The British philosopher Bertrand Russell, his wife Dora and their children John and Kate spent the summer months from 1922 to 1927 in Porthcurno.

<text>Blinn College is a public junior college in Brenham, Texas, with additional campuses in Bryan, Schulenburg, Sealy and Waller. Brenham is Blinn&#x27;s original and main campus, with housing and athletics.

==History==
Blinn was founded in 1884 as Mission Institute by local minister Carl Urbantke with an original class of 3 ministerial students. It was affiliated with the Southern German Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and became coeducational in 1888. In 1889, the institute&#x27;s name was changed to Blinn Memorial College in honor of the Reverend Christian Blinn, who had donated a considerable sum of money to make the school possible. Blinn was a wealthy minister and immigrant from Germany who funded several German Methodist efforts, including the building of the in New York.

In 1927, the Board of Trustees, under leadership of President Philip Deschner, organized a junior college. In 1930, Blinn merged with Southwestern University of Georgetown, Texas. In 1934, a new charter was procured by the citizens of Brenham, and a private nonsectarian junior college was organized as Blinn College with nine regents as the board of control. In February 1937, all connections with Southwestern University and the Methodist denominations were severed.

On June 8, 1937, voters in Washington County levied a property tax for the creation of a public junior college district. Blinn thus became the first county-owned junior college district in Texas. The college continues to operate as one of the largest of some fifty public community college districts in Texas. After some early struggles (including the campus nearly closing in 1946 due to fiscal issues), the college began to grow and do well under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Morris Spencer, one of the early public junior college pioneers in Texas. When he left the college in 1957, it was on a firm fiscal footing.

=== Campuses ===

Blinn has six campuses in the following locations: Brenham, Bryan (Villa Maria Road), RELLIS (SH 47 in Bryan, shared with Texas A&amp;M University), Schulenberg, Sealy and Waller.

The Bryan campus was established in 1970, and by the early 1980s, a third campus opened in College Station. In 1997, the Villa Maria Road campus opened in Bryan, consolidating the programs that were located in the Townshire Shopping Center in Bryan and the Woodstone Center in College Station. The third Brazos County site, located in the former Bryan post office, continues to house the dental hygiene, radiologic technology, and workforce education programs. The original three buildings on the Bryan campuses were expanded to six, and in 2002, the former Schulman Theater was purchased and converted to classroom space, known as the College Park Campus (CPC). The Schulenburg campus opened in 1997 and the Sealy campus opened in 2005.

In 2015, Blinn announced that it would cancel expansion plans at the Villa Maria campus and open new facilities at the Texas A&amp;M RELLIS Campus instead. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Blinn College educational building took place on March 31, 2017. In 2022, Blinn opened a new $32 million administration building at RELLIS, incorporating 19 new classrooms in addition to offices for student enrollment.

In 2023, Blinn opened the Waller campus in the former Waller High School.

==Service area==
The Texas Legislature defined the service area of the college as such:
* All of the following counties: Brazos, Burleson, Grimes, Madison, Waller, and Washington
* Austin County, except for areas in Brazos ISD (legislation uses &quot;Wallis-Orchard&quot;, the district&#x27;s former name)
* Fayette County, except for areas in Smithville ISD
* Lee County, except for areas in Elgin ISD
* Portions of Bastrop County within Lexington ISD
* Portions of Harris County within Waller ISD
* Portions of Milam County within Gause ISD, Lexington ISD, and Milano ISD
* Portions of Montgomery County within Richards ISD
* Portions of Robertson County within Bryan ISD, Franklin ISD, Hearne ISD, and Mumford ISD
* Portions of Walker County within Richards ISD
* Portions of Williamson County within Lexington ISD

Of those areas, the only portion within the college&#x27;s taxation area, which means the only portion eligible for in-district tuition, is Washington County.

==Academics==
Blinn offers more than 150 degree and certificate programs. The college is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associate&#x27;s degrees.

=== Transfer ===
Blinn has the highest transfer rate in the state of Texas, sending students to institutions such as Texas A&amp;M University, Sam Houston State University, Texas State University, the University of Texas and the University of Houston. Its transfer rate to four-year universities is 49% compared to the state average of 27%. Blinn transfers more students to Texas A&amp;M University than any other two-year college. Blinn technical students score among the best in the state on board and licensure exams.

In 2001, Blinn and Texas A&amp;M University established the first co-enrollment program of its kind with the TEAM (Transfer Enrollment at Texas A&amp;M) Program. TEAM students enroll in one or two A&amp;M courses at a time while taking the rest of their courses at Blinn. After 60 credit hours and meeting academic standards, students are guaranteed transfer to A&amp;M, with opportunity to transfer before 60 credits/2 years. In 2013, the program was awarded the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board&#x27;s Recognition of Excellence, and in 2014 it received the THECB Star Award.

== Student profile ==

For Fall 2021, the college district enrolled 8,779 full-time and 17,909 total students. The student body was 49% male and 51% female. The largest program was Liberal Arts, followed by Agriculture then Nursing, all associates degrees.
==Community impact==

Economic Modeling Specialists International (EMSI) conducted a 2014 study which concluded that Blinn made a $345.3 million impact in its service area, including $239.5 million in added income by former students employed in the regional workforce, $61.3 million in College operations spending and $44.5 million in student spending. The report found that Blinn has made an impact of $247.4 million in Bryan-College Station, $83 million in Brenham, $11.1 million in Schulenburg and $3.9 million in Sealy.

Blinn has also been recognized for its community service. In 2011, Blinn received the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching Community Engagement Classification, and in 2012 it was the only community college in the state of Texas to be named to the President&#x27;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll. Each year, Blinn devotes a day to community service, called the Blinn Blitz, and hundreds of students participate in local community service projects.

==Athletics==

The home campus in Brenham has offered intercollegiate athletics since 1903 and has won 50 national championships since 1987. The Blinn Buccaneers compete in football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, cheerleading, and dance.

<doc id="1246012" wikidata="Q2940726" url="?curid=1246012" title="Sagittal keel">
<text>In the human skull, a sagittal keel, or sagittal torus, is a thickening of part or all of the midline of the frontal bone, or parietal bones where they meet along the sagittal suture, or on both bones. Sagittal keels differ from sagittal crests, which are found in some earlier hominins (notably the genus &quot;Paranthropus&quot;) and in a range of other mammals. While a proper crest functions in anchoring the muscles of mastication to the cranium, the keel is lower and rounded in cross-section, and the jaw muscles do not attach to it.

Sagittal keels occur in several early human species, most noticeably in &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, occasionally in &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; and in some Upper Paleolithic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; specimens. Most modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; groups have lost them, likely as part of the general trend toward thinning of the cranial bones to make room for larger brains during the Pleistocene. However, there is a small portion of modern humans who have the feature, but its function and etiology are unknown. Actor Patrick Stewart and the martial artist Shi Yan Ming present good examples of modern humans (&quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot;) with this feature. The keel appears to be tied to general cranial robustness and is more common in adult men than women and absent in children.

<text>WUTC (88.1 FM) is a non-commercial, listener-supported public radio station in Chattanooga, Tennessee, serving the Chattanooga metropolitan area and the Tennessee Valley. It is owned and operated by the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and broadcasts from UTC campus. It is a member station of National Public Radio and broadcasts news programs plus a variety of music, including adult album alternative and related genres.

WUTC has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 30,000 watts. The transmitter tower is on Sawyer Cemetery Road in Walden. The signal can be heard in parts of Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama and North Carolina.

==Programming==
WUTC airs a mix of news and talk programs and adult album alternative (AAA) music shows on weekdays with other genres heard on weekends. Popular weekday shows from NPR include &quot;Morning Edition, All Things Considered&quot; and &quot;Fresh Air&quot;. Once-a-week specialty shows include &quot;On The Media, The Moth Radio Hour, Latino USA, Travel with Rick Steves, The New Yorker Radio Hour, Radiolab, The TED Radio Hour, Freakonomics Radio, Left, Right and Center&quot; and &quot;Wait, Wait, Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;.

Weekday music shows are hosted by Richard Windham (late mornings) and Haley Solomon (early evenings). Specialty music shows, heard nights and weekends, include programs on acoustic, bluegrass, jazz, folk, blues and Celtic music. The station seeks donations on the air and on its website.

==History==
===Early years===
WUTC signed on the air in . In its early years, it aired a classical music radio format, with news and educational shows. Another Chattanooga non-commercial station, 90.5 WSMC-FM, also airs classical music. WUTC&#x27;s studios were in Race Hall on the UTC campus.

Until 1988, WUTC rebroadcast the morning programming of WUOT-FM in Knoxville. At that point, WUTC obtained its own satellite downlink and was able to obtain nationally syndicated programming from public radio networks on its own.

===NPR affiliation===
In October 1995, WUTC became the exclusive home in the Chattanooga market for several NPR programs, including &quot;Morning Edition,&quot; &quot;All Things Considered,&quot; &quot;Car Talk&quot; and &quot;Weekend Edition&quot;. That&#x27;s when 90.5 WSMC-FM dropped most NPR programming due to conflicts with religious programming on its schedule. WSMC-FM is owned by Southern Adventist University and it devotes some hours on Fridays and Saturdays to Adventist programming.

Today, WUTC maintains a mix of syndicated programming and local music shows in its weekday schedule, with a focus on syndicated shows almost exclusively on weekends. In July 2002, WUTC began streaming its broadcast online. In May 2006, it became the first Chattanooga radio station (public or commercial) to simulcast its broadcast in HD Radio format. In 2022, WUTC moved its studios and offices from its longtime location in Cadek Hall to the UTC Administrative Services Building on Palmetto Street.

===Controversy===
In March 2017, the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga fired WUTC reporter Jacqui Helbert, who had interviewed state politicians about a transgender bathroom bill. The political figures alleged they did not know she was a journalist even though she was reportedly wearing headphones and a microphone with the WUTC logo.

The dismissal came after state legislators complained to university officials. Station and university officials said that Helbert breached journalistic ethics by not identifying herself as a journalist or giving the legislators a chance to comment before the story aired. However, critics claimed station and university officials overreacted out of fear that the legislature would reduce the station&#x27;s funding.

<doc id="1246024" wikidata="Q339398" url="?curid=1246024" title="Gaius Valerius Pudens">
<text>Gaius Valerius Pudens was a Roman Senator who was a suffect consul and held at least three imperial appointments during the late 2nd - early 3rd centuries. His career is known almost entirely from inscriptions in the four provinces he is known to have governed.

Valerius Pudens was a native of Cuicul, now Djémila. His earliest attested post was governor of Pannonia Inferior in April 193, then his consulship either in the later part of 193 or in 194, before becoming governor of Germania Inferior at some point between 197 and 200. 

After his tenure as governor in Lower Germany, he was appointed governor of Roman Britain. An inscription at Bainbridge fort records new barracks being built under his governorship, possibly in connection with recent uprisings by the Brigantes, and attests his presence there in 205. Birley believes he was the predecessor of Lucius Alfenus Senecio, but admits the evidence equally supports Pudens as Senecio&#x27;s successor.

Pudens is last heard of as proconsul of Africa in 211/212. While proconsul, according to Tertullian, he refused to hear a case against a Christian &quot;perceiving from the indictment that it was a case of vexatious accusation; tearing the document in pieces, he refused so much as to hear him without the presence of his accuser, as not being consistent with the imperial commands.&quot;

<doc id="1246027" wikidata="Q5070789" url="?curid=1246027" title="Chancellor of Uppsala University">
<text>The Chancellor (Swedish &quot;kansler&quot;) of Uppsala University was from 1622 to 1893 the head of the University of Uppsala, although in most academic and practical day-to-day matters it was run by the (&quot;konsistorium&quot;) or board, and its chairman, the Rector magnificus.

There appears to have been a position as chancellor of the university already in its earliest period. According to the papal bull of Sixtus IV from 1477, the Archbishop of Uppsala, Jakob Ulfsson (the initiator of the university), was to be chancellor of the university. His successors appear not to have held this position, and during the 16th century and its long periods of dormancy of the university, no chancellor seems to have been appointed.

According to the privileges for Uppsala University promulgated by the regent Duke Charles (later king Charles IX) in 1595, the archbishop of Uppsala, the other bishops of the realm and the university were to elect the chancellor, who was then to be confirmed in his position by the king. In 1604 the university requested Prince Gustavus Adolphus as chancellor but received the reply that the Duke was still too young to understand these matters. In 1607 Count Abraham Brahe was appointed chancellor, but does not seem to have given much attention to the university, in contrast to the king&#x27;s former tutor, the learned Johan Skytte, still remembered (among other things) for his donation of the Skyttean professorship, who was appointed chancellor in 1622 and can be said to begin the continuous chronological list of chancellors. Skytte was a member of the council of state (&quot;riksrådet&quot;) and the king ordered in 1625 that one of the councillors of state (riksråd) was always to hold the position of chancellor. The position of Pro-Chancellor (&quot;prokansler&quot;), deputy of the Chancellor, was always held &quot;ex officio&quot; by the Archbishop of Uppsala.

From the latter half of the 18th century until 1859 the position of chancellor was more often than not held by members of the royal family. For instance, Crown Prince Carl Johan, the former French Marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte and later king Charles XIV of Sweden, held the position from his election as heir to the throne and adoption by king Charles XIII. On his accession to the throne in 1818, his French-born son, Crown Prince Oscar (later Oscar I of Sweden), succeeded his father in the position, as did his son, Crown Prince Carl, when Oscar became king in 1844. Carl (the later Charles XV of Sweden) belonged to the first Swedish-born generation of the Bernadotte dynasty, and he and his brothers were also the first members of any Swedish royal dynasty to attend university since Charles X, who had been matriculated in Uppsala somewhat over 200 years earlier (1638). Carl was in fact chancellor already while he was himself a student at the university, and he remained so until his accession to the throne in 1859.

From 1861 the Chancellor of Uppsala University was also head of the Karolinska Institute (founded in 1810), and from 1859 until 1893 the Chancellorship of Uppsala University was always held by the same person as the Chancellorship of Lund University; from June 17, 1893, the positions were combined into a single one, with the new University Chancellor having responsibility both for the two old universities and for the then recently founded University Colleges of Stockholm and Gothenburg (now the Universities of Stockholm and Gothenburg).

The role of the chancellor and his level of interference in university affairs depended on the aspirations or visions of the person holding the position and varied over time. With the new national university chancellor getting a supervisory role in relation to higher education as a whole from 1893, the local leadership role of the &quot;rector magnificus&quot; grew from the end of the 19th century and the terms of the rectors of the university lengthened from the one or two semesters at a time which had previously been the rule to several years or even a decade or two.

The position of Pro-Chancellor was abolished in 1934, but the last incumbent, Archbishop Erling Eidem retained it until his retirement in 1950.

<doc id="1246035" wikidata="Q3427676" url="?curid=1246035" title="Research Assessment Exercise">
<text>The Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) was an exercise undertaken approximately every five years on behalf of the four UK higher education funding councils (HEFCE, SHEFC, HEFCW, DELNI) to evaluate the quality of research undertaken by British higher education institutions. RAE submissions from each subject area (or &quot;unit of assessment&quot;) are given a rank by a subject specialist peer review panel. The rankings are used to inform the allocation of quality weighted research funding (QR) each higher education institution receives from their national funding council. Previous RAEs took place in 1986, 1989, 1992, 1996 and 2001. The most recent results were published in December 2008. It was replaced by the Research Excellence Framework (REF) in 2014.

Various media have produced league tables of institutions and disciplines based on the 2008 RAE results. Different methodologies lead to similar but non-identical rankings.

==History==
The first exercise of assessing of research in higher education in the UK took place in 1986 under the Margaret Thatcher Government. It was conducted by the University Grants Committee under the chairmanship of the Cambridge mathematician Peter Swinnerton-Dyer. The purpose of the exercise was to determine the allocation of funding to UK Universities at a time of tight budgetary restrictions. The committee received submissions of research statements from 37 subject areas (&quot;cost centres&quot;) within universities, along with five selected research outputs. It issued quality rankings labelled &quot;outstanding&quot;, &quot;above average&quot;, &quot;average&quot; or &quot;below average&quot;. The research funding allocated to universities (called &quot;quality-related&quot; funding) depended on the quality ratings of the subject areas. According to Swinnerton-Dyer, the objective was to establish a measure of transparency to the allocation of funding at a time of declining budgets.

A subsequent research assessment was conducted in 1989 under the name &quot;research selectivity exercise&quot; by the Universities Funding Council. Responding to the complaint of the universities that they weren&#x27;t allowed submit their &quot;full strength,&quot; Swinnerton-Dyer allowed the submission of two research outputs per every member of staff. The evaluation was also expanded to 152 subject areas (&quot;units of assessment&quot;). According to Roger Brown and Helen Carasso, only about 40 per cent of the research-related funding was allocated based on the assessment of the submissions. The rest was allocated based on staff and student numbers and research grant income.

In 1992, the distinction between universities and polytechnics was abolished. The Universities Funding Council was replaced by regionwise funding councils such as the HEFCE. Behram Bekhradnia, the directory of policy at HEFCE, came to the conclusion that the research assessment needed to become &quot;much more robust and rigorous.&quot; This led to the institution of the Research Assessment Exercise in 1992. The results of the 1992 exercise were nevertheless challenged in Court by the Institute of Dental Surgery and the judge warned that the system had to become more transparent. The assessment panels in the subsequent exercises had to be much more explicit about the criteria for evaluation and the working methods. In 1996, all volume-based evaluation was removed to account for the criticism that volume rather than quality was rewarded.

The 1992 exercise also stipulated that the staff submitted for assessment had to be in post by a specific date (the &quot;census date&quot;) in order to counter the criticisms that the staff that had moved on were still counted in the assessment. This led to the phenomenon of &quot;poaching&quot; of highly qualified staff by other universities ahead of the census date. In the 2001 exercise, the credit for the staff that moved institutions in the middle of the cycle could be shared between the two institutions. In the 2008 exercise, this was abolished.

The assessment of 2008 also brought in a major change. Instead of a single grade for an entire subject area (&quot;unit of assessment&quot;), a grade was assigned to each research output. This was done to counter the criticism that large departments were able to hide a &quot;very long tail&quot; of lesser work and still get high ratings and, conversely, excellent staff in low-graded departments were unable to receive adequate funding. Thus the single grades for units of assessment were replaced by &quot;quality profiles,&quot; which indicated the proportion of each department&#x27;s research against each quality category.

==Scale==

===2008===

The 2008 RAE used a four-point quality scale, and returned a profile, rather than a single aggregate quality score, for each unit.
The quality levels—based on assessment of research outputs, research environment and indicators of esteem—are defined as:

Each unit of assessment was given a &quot;quality profile&quot; – a five-column histogram – indicating the proportion of the research that meets each of four quality levels or is unclassified.

===Earlier Assessments===
In 1992, 1996 and 2001, the following descriptions were used for each of the ratings.

These ratings have been applied to &quot;units of assessment&quot;, such as French or Chemistry, which often broadly equate to university departments. Various unofficial league tables have been created of university research capability by aggregating the results from units of assessment. Compiling league tables of universities based on the RAE is problematic, as volume and quality are both significant factors.

==Assessment process==
The assessment process for the RAE focuses on quality of research outputs (which usually means papers published in academic journals and conference proceedings), research environment, and indicators of esteem. Each subject panel determines precise rules within general guidance. For RAE 2008, institutions are invited to submit four research outputs, published between January 2001 and December 2007, for each full-time member of staff selected for inclusion.

In response to criticism of earlier assessments, and developments in employment law, the 2008 RAE does more to take into account part-time workers or those new to a sufficient level of seniority to be included in the process.

==Criticism==
The RAE has not been without its critics. In its different iterations, it has divided opinion among researchers, managers and policy makers. Amongst the criticisms is the fact that it explicitly ignores the publications of most full-time researchers in the UK, on the grounds that they are employed on fixed term contracts. According to the RAE 2008 guidelines, most research assistants are &quot;not eligible to be listed as research active staff&quot;. Publications by researchers on fixed term contracts are excluded from the Assessment Exercise unless those publications can be credited to a member of staff who is eligible for the RAE. This applies even if the member of staff being assessed only made a minor contribution to the article. The opposite phenomenon is also true, where non-research active staff on permanent contracts, such as lecturers who have been responsible primarily for teaching activities have also found themselves placed under deeper contractual pressure by their employing universities to produce research output. Another issue is that it is doubtful whether panels of experts have the necessary expertise to evaluate the quality of research outputs, as experts perform much less well as soon as they are outside their particular area of specialisation.

Since 1996 the AUT, now incorporated within the UCU, has maintained a policy of opposition to the Research Assessment Exercise. In its view,
The official &quot;Review of Research Assessment,&quot; the 2003 &quot;Roberts Report&quot; commissioned by the UK funding bodies, recommended changes to research assessment, partly in response to such criticisms.

The House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee considered the Roberts report, and took a more optimistic view, asserting that, &quot;the RAE had had positive effects: it had stimulated universities into managing their research and had ensured that funds were targeted at areas of research excellence&quot;, it concluded that &quot;there had been a marked improvement in universities&#x27; research performance&quot;. Nevertheless, it argued that &quot;the RAE in its present form had had its day&quot;, and proposed a reformed RAE, largely based on Roberts&#x27; recommendations.

==Planned changes to RAE system==
It was announced in the 2006 Budget that after the 2008 exercise a system of metrics would be developed in order to inform future allocations of QR funding. Following initial consultation with the higher education sector, it is thought that the Higher Education Funding Councils will introduce a metrics based system of assessment for subjects in science, technology, engineering and medicine. A process of peer review is likely to remain for mathematics, statistics, arts, humanities and social studies subjects.

HEFCE has developed a new set of arrangements, known as the Research Excellence Framework (REF), which has been introduced as a follow on to the 2008 RAE.

<text>The Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) is an American national, not-for-profit organization, founded in 1973, and sponsored by the U.S. manufacturers and distributors of BMW, BRP, Harley-Davidson, Honda, Kawasaki, KTM, Piaggio/Vespa, Suzuki, Triumph, Indian Motorcycle and Yamaha motorcycles. The MSF maintains rider training curricula used in most states for novice and experienced riders.

The MSF fosters a &quot;ride safe&quot; attitude, and promotes lifelong learning for motorcyclists. It also participates in government relations, motorcycle safety research, public awareness campaigns, and technical assistance to state training and licensing programs.

==Courses==

MSF is a developer of comprehensive, research-based rider education and training curricula designed to develop or advance motorcyclists&#x27; riding skills.

, the Motorcycle Safety Foundation has published 28 RiderCourses for current or prospective motorcyclists. MSF offers several courses via iTunes U including &quot;An Adventure in Motorcycle Physics&quot;, &quot;Dr. Ray&#x27;s Street Strategies&quot;, &quot;Dr. Ray&#x27;s Guide to Group Riding&quot; and &quot;Dr. Ray&#x27;s Seasoned Rider&quot;.

MSF administers courses directly in Colorado, New Mexico, New York, and West Virginia and directly operates training sites called MSF Campuses in Troy, Ohio and Alpharetta, Georgia. However, in most states courses are administered by state agencies (i.e. Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Transportation, Department of Public Safety) or state university or community college networks that use MSF&#x27;s curricula. Individual training sites may be public, as through technical colleges, or private organizations. Thirty-one states use the MSF tests for licensing, and 41 states use the MSF motorcycle operator manual. In 45 states, these local training sites are certified by MSF. California, Idaho, Ohio, South Dakota, and Oregon states use non MSF-developed curricula. All fifty states have rider training programs.

MSF is recognized by most state departments of transportation in the U.S. Successful completion of MSF&#x27;s &quot;Basic &quot;RiderCourse&quot;&quot; usually replaces a state&#x27;s riding exam, and may also replace the written exam, to receive a motorcycle operator&#x27;s endorsement or license. Some insurance companies also offer discounts to those who have passed an MSF course. All United States military personnel are required to graduate from an MSF course to ride a motorcycle either on or off base.

==Team Oregon dispute==
A 2006 lawsuit by the MSF over alleged intellectual property infringement by the Team Oregon Rider Safety Program was settled in 2008. Team Oregon is a motorcycle training program run by the Oregon Department of Transportation and Oregon State University. In the settlement, Team Oregon was granted permission to use MSF materials provided a statement of MSF copyright ownership was included. Team Oregon also agreed to only market its materials in Oregon, as in the past, and will still deny that the agreed upon acknowledgment of copyright is needed. Team Oregon claimed victory in the settlement, in that no payments were required and they may continue to use the training materials, while the MSF said the settlement was the same as one they had offered in 2006.

Underlying the dispute was the question of whether programs like Team Oregon, or Idaho&#x27;s Skills Training Advantage for Riders (STAR), were free to develop their own training programs, specifically in response to the contention by the state programs that the MSF had made changes in their course that weakened it, making it easier to pass while putting riders at greater risk. Idaho&#x27;s training manager had expected to be named in the suit along with Team Oregon, due to their similarity to Team Oregon.

<text>John Ellis Temple (August 8, 1927 – January 9, 1994) was an American professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman from 1952 to 1964, most prominently as a member of the Cincinnati Reds, where he was the leadoff hitter and starting second baseman for six seasons.

A six-time All-Star player, Temple had a .300-plus batting average three times with the Reds and was one of the top defensive second basemen of his era. He teamed with shortstop Roy McMillan to form one of the best double-play combinations of the 1950s.

He also played for the Cleveland Indians, Baltimore Orioles and the Houston Colt .45s. Temple was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1965.

==Early baseball career==
Temple was born in Lexington, North Carolina where he attended Reed High School, now known as West Davidson High School. When he was 16-years-old, he suffered a broken leg and severe burns on his left leg while escaping a house fire, causing him to wear a protective shin guard over the injuries while participating in sports. At Reed High School, he served as captain of the school&#x27;s baseball and basketball teams and graduated as the class valedictorian in 1945.

Temple excelled as a high school basketball player and he received an athletic scholarship to play basketball for Duke University however, as a poor farm boy, he felt out of place at the prestigious university and left the school after two weeks. Instead, he decided to enroll at Catawba College in Salisbury, North Carolina. He then joined the United States Navy and served on the aircraft carrier USS Randolph toward the end of the Second World War. While playing for Navy baseball teams, Temple discovered that he enjoyed playing baseball enough to try to make a professional career out of it.

In 1948, Temple signed a contract to play for the Cincinnati Reds after attending a Reds tryout camp in Mooresville, North Carolina. He was assigned to play for the Morganton Aggies of the Western Carolina League where he produced a .316 batting average in 59 games. In 1949, he hit .400 while playing in 116 games for the Ogden Reds of the Pioneer League.

By the 1951 season, he had progressed to the top of the minor league ladder with the Tulsa Oilers where the presence of the superb-fielding shortstop Roy McMillan forced Temple to convert to playing as a second baseman.

==Major leagues==
Temple made his major league debut with the Reds on April 15, 1952 at the age of 24. He was a career .284 hitter with 22 home runs and 395 RBI in 1420 games. A legitimate leadoff hitter and four-time All-Star, he was a very popular player in Cincinnati in the 1950s. He teamed with McMillan from 1954 through the 1959 season to become the second longest double play combination in the NL since 1900.(The longest was Joe Morgan and Dave Concepción of the Cincinnati Reds in the 1970s.). Throughout his career, he walked more often than he struck out, compiling an outstanding 1.92 walk-to-strikeout ratio (648-to-338) and a .363 on-base percentage. Temple also had above-average speed and good instincts on the base paths. Quietly, he had 140 steals in 198 attempts (71%).

In , Temple and six of his Redleg teammates—Ed Bailey, Roy McMillan, Don Hoak, Gus Bell, Wally Post and Frank Robinson—were voted into the National League All-Star starting lineup, the result of a ballot stuffing campaign by Redlegs fans. Bell remained on the team as a reserve, but Post was taken off altogether. Bell and Post were replaced as starters by Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.
Temple enjoyed his best year in 1959, with career-highs in batting average (.311), home runs (8), RBI (67), runs (102), hits (186), at-bats (598), doubles (35) and triples (6). At the end of the season he was sent to Cleveland for Billy Martin, Gordy Coleman and Cal McLish.

Temple also played with Baltimore and Houston, and again with Cincinnati for his last major season, where he was a part-time coach. In August 1964, he cleaned out his locker after having a fight with fellow coach, Reggie Otero. When Fred Hutchinson had to leave the Reds due to his health, Cincinnati management decided to go with only two coaches and not reinstate Temple.

After his baseball career was over, Temple worked as a television newsman in Houston, Texas and got involved with a business that sold boats and RVs. The business failed causing Temple to lose everything, including his home. In 1977, Temple was arrested and charged with larceny of farm equipment. Through the efforts of his wife, who wrote a public letter to The Sporting News, Temple got legal assistance. He gave testimony to the South Carolina assembly against his criminal partners.

Temple died in Anderson, South Carolina in 1994 at the age of 66.

<doc id="1246063" wikidata="Q6664001" url="?curid=1246063" title="Local Emergency Planning Committee">
<text>Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) are community-based organizations that assist in preparing for emergencies, particularly those concerning hazardous materials. Under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) must develop an emergency response plan, review the plan at least annually, and provide information about hazardous materials in the community to citizens. Plans are developed by LEPCs with stakeholder participation. The LEPC membership must include (at a minimum):

* Elected state and local officials
* Police, fire service, civil defense, and public health professionals
* Environment, transportation, and hospital officials
* Facility representatives
* Representatives from community groups and the media

Some required elements of the community emergency response plan, developed by the LEPC, include:

* Identification of facilities and transportation routes of extremely hazardous substances
* Description of emergency response procedures, on and off site
* Designation of a community coordinator and facility emergency coordinator(s) to implement the plan
* Outline of emergency notification procedures
* Description of how to determine the probable affected area and population by releases
* Description of local emergency equipment and facilities and the persons responsible for them
* Outline of evacuation plans
* A training program for emergency responders (including schedules)
* Methods and schedules for exercising emergency response plans

Though LEPCs were created with the Federal law EPCRA, through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, they are often funded partially by the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness grant program. Other sources of funding may include local jurisdictions, industry, businesses, NGOs, and other public or private grants.

Alomar was born in Palma and raised in the Balearic Islands, a traditional province of Spain where the power of the Catholic Church was very strong. His father was a minor bureaucrat and so was moved around rather often; this made Gabriel&#x27;s childhood rather more cosmopolitan than was normal for Spanish youngsters of the time. In 1888, after finishing secondary school in Palma, he (like many young Majorcan men) went to mainland Barcelona to finish his education. In this environment, he became active as a journalist as well as continuing to publish poetry in what the critic Josephine de Boer has called a Parnassian mode, as well as becoming involved with the Catalan regionalist movement and the literary trend of noucentisme.

==Poetry==
Gabriel Alomar is often placed by critics among the poets of the Escola Mallorquina, but this choice is problematic. Alomar&#x27;s poetry &quot;is&quot; technically rather conservative in , but in terms of content it does not fit well with the highly orthodox Catholic beliefs of the other poets associated with the school (Joan Alcover, Miquel Costa i Llobera). A better-fitting classification is to group his poetry with the Parnassianist strain of Modernista poetry. While Alomar&#x27;s verse was and is well regarded in his home territory of Majorca, it is his essays and journalism which continue to be reprinted and read.

==Journalism==
Alomar&#x27;s periodical writings tended less toward strict reportage and more toward a polemic style couched in column form. His columns often read like speeches; in fact, as an educator and secondary school , many of them began as lectures. The most famous of these speech-articles, &quot;El futurisme&quot;, describes Alomar&#x27;s vision of Spain&#x27;s present condition, its problems, and his ideas for solving them. He is credited of inventing the term &quot;futurism&quot;, as well as partly its ideology, not the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, this discovery being outlined by authors with the stature of Nicaraguan modernist poet Rubén Darío and Chilean avant-garde poet Vicente Huidobro. In essence, Alomar believed that Spain was addicted to its own past, that it preferred to maintain a belief in the regeneration of Iberia&#x27;s imperial past rather than turn about and face the twentieth century. For Alomar, the future was far more important than the past, and so this addiction was Spain&#x27;s main problem. Thus the name.

==Diplomat==
Gabriel Alomar was the Spanish Ambassador to Italy (1932–34) and Egypt from 1937 to the end of the Spanish Civil War but remained in Egypt until his death in Cairo in 1941.

==Influence==
Gabriel Alomar had many occupations in his life, but throughout it he was constantly in demand as a writer of prologues. He wrote dozens, in Castilian Spanish, Catalan, and French, for editions of famous writers and for young authors needing a boost.

<text>Gränichen is a municipality in the district of Aarau of the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

==Geography==

The river Wyna flows north at first and heads northwest thereafter. The valley has an average width of about .
On both sides of the valley there are steep hills with tributary valleys and small high plateaus. The landscape is not dissimilar to that of the Tafeljura, even though - geographically and geologically speaking - Gränichen lies in the Midland of Switzerland.

The hills on the left side of the valley are (from north to south): Manzenberg ( ), Wällenen (559 m), Moosberg (550 m), Heidberg () and Pfendel (). These are foothills of the Schornig (), which marks the transition to the valley of the river Suhre. The hills on the right side of the valley are called Fuden (), Räckholderen (), Breitenberg () and Surberg (). In front of the Breitenberg is the Schulthess () which has almost the shape of an ellipsis. The Dossen () und the high plateau of the Liebegg are foothills of the Surberg.

Near the southern border, at an average distance of two kilometers, there are three hamlets, which also belong to the municipality of Gränichen: Rütihof () on Moorbergs, Bleien () and Refental () between Breitenberg, Dossen and Surberg.

Gränichen has an area, , of . Of this area, 30.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 56.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 13.1% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (0.1%) is non-productive (rivers or lakes). The highest point is at above main sea level on the &#x27;Pfendel&#x27;, the lowest point is at where the river wyna leaves the village.

The seven neighbouring villages are Suhr in the nordwest, Hunzenschwil in the north, Schafisheim in the northeast, Seon in the east, Teufenthal in the south, Unterkulm in the south, Muhen in the southwest and Hirschthal in the west.

==History==
History&#x27;s first mention of Gränichen was around 1184 under the name of &quot;Cranechon&quot;. However, archaeological discoveries dating from the Neolithic, as well as the remains of a Celtic castle, show that the area around Gränichen has been settled for quite some time.

In the 12th century Gränichen belonged to the monastery of Engelberg and later came under the reign of the Habsburgs, who passed the government of the village to the Lords of the Castle of Liebegg. After 1415, Gränichen belonged to Bern.

The construction of the Wynentalbahn railway in 1904 promoted the settlement of local industries.

==Coat of arms==
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is &quot;Per bend sinister Or and Azure a Bend counterchanged.&quot;

==Points of interest==
The castle of Liebegg resides on a hill close to the border to Teufenthal, about three kilometers south-south-east of the village center. The Castle, which dates from the 11th century, is nowadays used as a center for culture, meetings and congresses.

Near the village center one finds the &quot;Chornhaus&quot;, which, built in 1695, looks very similar to a small castle, because of its tower. Until 1798 it served as a granary and was thereafter used by the municipal administration department for over a century. Since the new parish hall was completed in 1995 it contains a small village museum.

The Reformed Church was built from 1661 to 1663 on the site where the previous church had collapsed. It is one of the main works of Protestant church building in the canton of Aargau, and is listed as a heritage site of national significance.

The other heritage site of national significance in Gränichen is the &quot;Untervogthaus&quot; on Lochgasse.

<text>Lucius Alfenus Senecio was a Roman figure of the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries.

==Career==

Born in Curculum, Africa (Roman province) (Djemila, Algeria), Lucius Alfenus Senecio was a Numidian (Romanised Berber). He served as &quot;procurator Augusti&quot; in &quot;Gallia Belgica&quot;, then in &quot;Mauretania Caesariensis&quot; (196-197?). After consulship, served as governor of Syria between 200 and 205. Between c. 205 and 207, he was the last governor of all Roman Britain prior to its division into multiple provinces.

He restored many of the installations at Hadrian&#x27;s Wall following the uprisings of earlier years and a Victory dedication mentions his name. Dio Cassius also writes of victories in Britain in 206 and it is therefore likely that he finished the re-occupation of the province and its frontiers. Troubles from the tribes immediately north of the wall however, trouble from the Maeatae and the Caledonian Confederacy appear to have required expeditions north of the wall. Senecio seems to have been initially successful; he erected a victory monument at Benwell.

Herodian records that he requested re-enforcements from emperor Septimius Severus, perhaps to undertake punishment raids in Scotland or for a military expedition led by the emperor himself. His report back to Rome described barbarians rebelling, &quot;overrunning the land, taking booty and causing destruction&quot;. Despite being 62 years old, Septimius Severus chose to intervene personally, arriving in 208 to lead new campaigns.

When Severus arrived in Britain he charged his youngest son, Publius Septimius Geta with the task of administering some aspects of Roman Britain although as viceroy rather than as a formal governor. 

When Severus died at York in 211, his eldest son, Caracalla tried to claim the throne. As part of his efforts to settle matters in Britain before leaving to press his claim, he may have divided the province into Britannia Inferior in the north and Britannia Superior in the south, each with its own governor. Alternatively, the division may have been decreed by Severus sometime previously.

<doc id="1246105" wikidata="Q5990320" url="?curid=1246105" title="If He Hollers Let Him Go">
<text>If He Hollers Let Him Go is the first novel by American writer Chester Himes, published in 1945, about an African-American shipyard worker in Los Angeles during World War II. It earned him critical acclaim and was considered a &quot;protest novel&quot;, in the tradition of Richard Wright.

The book was adapted as a 1968 film, starring Raymond St. Jacques, Dana Wynter, Kevin McCarthy, Barbara McNair, and Arthur O&#x27;Connell. The screenplay differed markedly from the novel. 

==Plot and characters==
The story spans four days in the life of Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Jones, a newcomer to Los Angeles from Ohio. With some college education, he works as a crew leader in a naval shipyard. In this period, black workers are gaining opportunities in the defense industry as a result of executive orders of President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II. 

However, Jones cannot escape the pressures of racism. He believes he was promoted as a supervisor only to gain the cooperation of black workers in the war effort. He is forced to deal with anti-communist paranoia, resentment from whites on the floor working at the same jobs as &quot;colored boys&quot;, and the baiting of black workers by some white females. 

His fears invade his dreams, aspirations, and passions. His dream of making something of himself in California is jeopardized as he reacts to the actions of the white people around him. He struggles to contain his urges to fight, kill, and rape as ways to overcome his resentment of white power arrayed against him. 

The main characters are the protagonist, Bob Jones, and two women: Madge Perkins, who is white; and Alice Harrison, his higher-class African-American girlfriend. Bob struggles for place in a white-dominated world and is filled with violent thoughts against white people, but does not act on them. 

In what is described as a &quot;sexually charged novel&quot;, Madge makes a racial slur toward Bob. His calling her a &quot;bitch&quot; results in his demotion. He considers raping her as a way to get back at white America, seeing her as a symbol of &quot;whiteness&quot;, but when she expresses sexual attraction to him, he rejects her. Alice tells Bob it is no use getting angry about the inequality that blacks must live with, and he has to learn to deal with it.

==Themes==
Themes addressed in the novel include racism suffered by black people, color differentiation among African Americans (Alice&#x27;s light skin is associated with her higher class), employment discrimination against blacks, and class divisions among whites and blacks. Communism is featured generously, as the Communist unionists (&quot;agitators&quot;) are the only ones who talk about the issue of race in any way with which the protagonist agrees. There is some reference to jazz.

The book’s title plays on the third line of a popular children’s rhyme, which follows the second line historically included a racial epithet, “catch a n** by the toe”(in the US and other English-speaking countries like Australia). Mid-20th century variants in the US replaced the epithet with “tiger.” 

The novel is referred to in Frantz Fanon&#x27;s book, &quot;Black Skin White Masks&quot; (1952), first published in French, in the chapter titled &quot;The Fact of Blackness&quot;.

==Reception==
Critics praised this first novel by Himes, classifying it in the &quot;protest novel&quot; tradition established by Richard Wright.

<doc id="1246114" wikidata="Q244189" url="?curid=1246114" title="Cackling goose">
<text>The cackling goose (Branta hutchinsii) is a species of goose found in North America and East Asia.

==Systematics==
The genus name &quot;Branta&quot; is a Latinised form of Old Norse &quot;Brandgás&quot;, &quot;burnt (black) goose&quot;, and the specific epithet &quot;hutchinsii&quot; commemorates English surgeon Thomas Hutchins who was employed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

The cackling goose was originally considered the same species or a subspecies of the Canada goose, but in July 2004 the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union&#x27;s (AOU) Committee on Classification and Nomenclature split the two into two species, making cackling goose into a full species with the scientific name &quot;Branta hutchinsii&quot;. The British Ornithologists&#x27; Union (BOU) followed suit in June 2005.

The AOU has divided the many associated subspecies between both animals. To the present species were assigned:

*Richardson&#x27;s cackling goose (&quot;B. h. hutchinsii&quot;)
*Aleutian cackling goose (&quot;B. h. leucopareia&quot;)
*Small cackling goose (&quot;B. h. minima&quot;)
*Taverner&#x27;s cackling goose (&quot;B. h. taverneri&quot;)
*†Bering cackling goose (&quot;B. h. asiatica&quot;)—doubtfully distinct from &quot;B. h. leucopareia&quot;; extinct (c.1929)

The distinctions between the two geese have led to a great deal of confusion and debate among ornithologists. This has been aggravated by the overlap between the small types of Canada goose and larger types of cackling goose. The old &quot;lesser Canada geese&quot; were believed to be a partly hybrid population, with the birds named &quot;taverneri&quot; considered a mixture of &quot;minima&quot; with subspecies &quot;occidentalis&quot; and &quot;parvipes&quot;, which today remain with the Canada goose proper. Actually however, &quot;taverneri&quot; is one of the larger subspecies of cackling geese. In addition, it has been determined that the barnacle goose (&quot;B. leucopsis&quot;) is a derivative of the cackling goose lineage, whereas the Hawaiian goose (&quot;B. sandvicensis&quot;) is an insular representative of the Canada goose.

In the wake of the discussion generated by the official standalone species designation, introduced by the AOU and BOU in 2004 and 2005, Harold C. Hanson published a paper in 2007 suggesting that Canada and cackling geese should be split into six species and 200 subspecies. The radical nature of this proposal provoked surprise, with Richard Banks of the AOU urging caution before any of Hanson&#x27;s proposals be accepted. No further redesignation has been introduced by either of these Ornithologists&#x27; Unions.

==Description==
The black head and neck with white &quot;chinstrap&quot; distinguish this goose from all other geese except the larger Canada goose (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;) and the similarly sized barnacle goose (&quot;B. leucopsis&quot;). There are up to five subspecies of cackling goose of varying sizes and plumage details. The female looks virtually identical but is slightly lighter and has a different voice. Some are hard to distinguish from the Canada goose, with which the cackling goose was long assumed to form one species, the cackling goose and the smaller Canada goose subspecies being called the lesser Canada goose. The smallest cackling geese (&quot;B. h. minima&quot;) are much smaller than any Canada goose, but the subspecies &quot;B. h. hutchinsii&quot;, at up to , grows to the same size as some Canada geese. The distinctness of the extinct population of the Komandorski and Kuril Islands &quot;B. h. asiatica&quot; is controversial. The barnacle goose differs in having a black breast and grey, rather than brownish, body plumage.

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

==Range==
This species is native to North America, breeding in Northern Canada and Alaska in a variety of tundra habitats, where the nest is usually located in an elevated area near water. The eggs are laid in a shallow depression, lined with plant materials and down. However, as the nests are made close-to, or directly on, the ground, the eggs (along with lone nesting females and newly-hatched goslings) are particularly vulnerable to predation by certain mammalian carnivores. Depending on the region, potential threats may vary from free-ranging domestic or feral cats and dogs, to foxes, coyotes, rats and other animals, such as some species of snakes. Thus, as a result, both geese—especially the male—in a nesting pair become highly aggressive and defensive of the nesting site, even chasing people away who may happen to walk by.

A pair may mate for life (up to around 20 years). Adult geese are often seen leading their goslings in a line with one parent at the front, and the other at the back of the &quot;parade&quot;.

Like most geese, the cackling goose is naturally migratory, with their overwintering range being most of the U.S. (locally in Western Canada, the West Coast of the U.S. and northern Mexico). The calls overheard from large flocks of cackling geese, flying in their typical &quot;V&quot;-shaped formation, signal the transitions into spring and fall. In some areas, migration routes change due to shifts in available habitat, environment and food sources.

As vagrants, cackling geese have reached Western Europe of their own accord, as has been proven by ringing recoveries and documented sightings. The birds seen in Europe are of, at least, the subspecies &quot;hutchinsii&quot;, and possibly others. Cackling geese are also found, naturally, as vagrants around the Kamchatka Peninsula in Far Eastern Russia (Siberia), East China, and throughout the islands of Japan. Nevertheless, the IUCN considered the species to be extirpated from Japan, where it previously had an established non breeding (winter) population. Birds have recently been reintroduced to both Japan and Siberia.

==Feeding==
These birds feed mainly on plant material. When feeding in water, they submerge their heads and necks to reach aquatic plants, sometimes tipping forward like a dabbling duck. Flocks of these birds often feed on leftover cultivated grains in fields, especially during migration or in winter. They also eat some insects, molluscs and crustaceans.

==Status==
By the early 20th century, over-hunting and loss of habitat in the late 19th and early 20th centuries had resulted in a serious decline in the numbers of this bird in its native range. With improved game laws and habitat restoration and preservation programs, their populations have recovered in most of their range, although some local populations may still be declining, especially of the subspecies &quot;minima&quot; and &quot;leucopareia&quot;. Though the taxonomic distinctness of the Komandorski and Kuril Islands populations, which used to winter in Japan, is controversial, it is without doubt that they disappeared around 1929.

<doc id="1246115" wikidata="Q907275" url="?curid=1246115" title="Countersteering">
<text>Countersteering is used by single-track vehicle operators, such as cyclists and motorcyclists, to initiate a turn toward a given direction by momentarily steering counter to the desired direction (&quot;steer left to turn right&quot;). To negotiate a turn successfully, the combined center of mass of the rider and the single-track vehicle must first be leaned in the direction of the turn, and steering briefly in the opposite direction causes that lean. The rider&#x27;s action of countersteering is sometimes referred to as &quot;giving a steering command&quot;.

The scientific literature does not provide a clear and comprehensive definition of countersteering. In fact, &quot;a proper distinction between steer torque and steer angle ... is not always made.&quot;

==How it works==
When countersteering to turn right, the following is performed:
* A torque on the handlebars to the left is applied.
* The front wheel will then rotate about the steering axis to the left and the tire will generate forces in the contact patch to the left.
* The machine as a whole steers to the left.
* Because the forces in the contact patch are at ground level, this pulls the wheels &quot;out from under&quot; the bike to the left and causes it to lean to the right.
* The rider, or in most cases the inherent stability of the bike, provides the steering torque necessary to rotate the front wheel back to the right and in the direction of the desired turn.
* The bike begins a turn to the right.

While this appears to be a complex sequence of motions, it is performed by every child who rides a bicycle. The entire sequence goes largely unnoticed by most riders, which is why some assert that they do not do it.

It is also important to distinguish the steering torque necessary to initiate the lean required for a given turn from the sustained steering torque and steering angle necessary to maintain a constant radius and lean angle until it is time to exit the turn.
* The initial steer torque and angle are both opposite the desired turn direction.
* The sustained steer angle is in the same direction as the turn.
* The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is either with or opposite the turn direction depending on forward speed, bike geometry, and combined bike and rider mass distribution.

===Need to lean to turn===
A bike can negotiate a curve only when the combined center of mass of bike and rider leans toward the inside of the turn at an angle appropriate for the velocity and the radius of the turn:

:formula_1
where formula_2 is the forward speed, formula_3 is the radius of the turn and formula_4 is the acceleration of gravity.

Higher speeds and tighter turns require greater lean angles. If the mass is not first leaned into the turn, the inertia of the rider and bike will cause them to continue in a straight line as the tires track out from under them along the curve. The transition of riding in a straight line to negotiating a turn is a process of leaning the bike into the turn, and the most practical way to cause that lean (of the combined center of mass of bike and rider) is to move the support points in the opposite direction first.

===Stable lean===

As the desired angle is approached, the front wheel must usually be steered into the turn to maintain that angle or the bike will continue to lean with gravity, increasing in rate, until the side contacts the ground. This process often requires little or no physical effort, because the geometry of the steering system of most bikes is designed in such a way that the front wheel has a strong tendency to steer in the direction of a lean.

The actual torque the rider must apply to the handlebars to maintain a steady-state turn is a complex function of bike geometry, mass distribution, rider position, tire properties, turn radius, and forward speed. At low speeds, the steering torque necessary from the rider is usually negative, that is opposite the direction of the turn, even when the steering angle is in the direction of the turn. At higher speeds, the direction of the necessary input torque often becomes positive, that is in the same direction as the turn.

===At low speeds===
At low speeds countersteering is equally necessary, but the countersteering is then so subtle that it is hidden by the continuous corrections that are made in balancing the bike, often falling below a just noticeable difference or threshold of perception of the rider. Countersteering at low speed may be further concealed by the ensuing much larger steering angle possible in the direction of the turn.

===Gyroscopic effects===
One effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment is proportional to the moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.

For a sample motorcycle moving at 22 m/s (50 mph) that has a front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6 kgm2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5 Nm. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks out from under the motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50 N. This, acting on the 0.6 m (2 ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30 Nm.

While the moment from gyroscopic forces is only 12% of this, it can play a significant part because it begins to act as soon as the rider applies the torque, instead of building up more slowly as the wheel out-tracks. This can be especially helpful in motorcycle racing.

==Motorcycles==
Deliberately countersteering is essential for safe motorcycle riding, and as a result is generally a part of safe riding courses run by organisations like the Motorcycle Safety Foundation, the Canada Safety Council, or Australian Q-Ride providers. Deliberately countersteering a motorcycle is a much more efficient way to steer than to just lean. At higher speeds the self-balancing property of the bike gets stiffer, and a given input force applied to the handlebars produces smaller changes in lean angle.

===Training===
Much of the art of motorcycle cornering is learning how to effectively push the grips into corners and how to maintain proper lean angles through the turn. When the need for a quick swerve to one side suddenly arises in an emergency, it is essential to know, through prior practice, that countersteering is the most efficient way to change the motorcycle&#x27;s course. Many accidents result when otherwise experienced riders who have never carefully developed this skill encounter an unexpected obstacle.

To encourage an understanding of the phenomena around countersteering, the phrase &quot;positive steering&quot; is sometimes used. Other phrases are &quot;PRESS – To turn, the motorcycle must lean&quot;, &quot;To lean the motorcycle, press on the handgrip in the direction of the turn&quot; or &quot;Press left – lean left – go left&quot;.

The Motorcycle Safety Foundation teaches countersteering to all students in all of its schools, as do all motorcycle racing schools. Countersteering is included in United States state motorcycle operator manuals and tests, such as Washington, New Jersey, California, and Missouri.

===Safety===
According to the Hurt Report, most motorcycle riders in the United States would over-brake and skid the rear wheel and under-brake the front when trying hard to avoid a collision. The ability to countersteer and swerve was essentially absent with many motorcycle operators. The often small amount of initial countersteering input required to get the bike to lean, which may be as little as 0.125 seconds, keeps many riders unaware of the concept.

==Multi-track vehicles==
Three wheeled motorcycles without the ability to lean have no need to be countersteered, and an initial steer torque in one direction does not automatically result in a turn in the other direction. This includes sidecar rigs where the car is rigidly mounted on the bike. The three wheeled BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster uses two front wheels which do not lean, and so it steers like a car.

Some sidecars allow the motorcycle to lean independent of the sidecar, and in some cases, the sidecar even leans in parallel with the motorcycle. These vehicles must be countersteered the same way as a solo motorcycle. The three wheel Piaggio MP3 uses mechanical linkages to lean the two front wheels in parallel with the rear frame, and so that it is countersteered in the same manner as a two-wheeled motorcycle.

Free-leaning multi-track vehicles must be balanced by countersteering before turning. Multi-track leaning vehicles that are forced-tilted, such as the Carver, are tilted without countersteering the control and are not balanced by the operator. Later versions of the Carver introduced automatic countersteer to increase tilt speed and reduce the force required to tilt the vehicle. Other forced-tilted vehicles may incorporate automatic countersteering. A prototype tilting multi-track free leaning vehicle was developed in 1984 that employs automatic countersteering and does not require any balancing skills.

==Countersteering by weight shifting==
With a sufficiently light bike (especially a bicycle), the rider can initiate a lean and turn without using the handlebars by shifting body weight, called counter lean by some authors.
Documented physical experimentation shows that on heavy bikes (many motorcycles) shifting body weight is less effective at initiating leans.

The following is done when countersteering using weight shifting to turn left:

* The rider applies a momentary torque, either at the seat via the legs or in the torso that causes the bike itself to lean to the right.
* The combined center of mass of the bike and rider is only lowered and not moved out, but if the front of the bike is free to swivel about its steering axis, the lean to the right will cause it to steer to the right by some combination of gyroscopic precession, ground reaction forces, gravitational force on an off-axis center of mass or simply the inertia of an off-axis center of mass depending on the exact geometry and mass distribution of the particular bike and the amount of torque and the speed at which it is applied.
* This countersteering to the right causes the ground contact to move to the right of the center of mass, as the bike moves forward, thus generating a leftward lean. Finally the front end steers to the left and the bike enters the left turn.

The amount of leftward steering necessary to balance the leftward lean appropriate for the forward speed and radius of the turn is controlled by the torque generated by the rider, again either at the seat or in the torso.

To straighten back out of the turn, the rider simply reverses the procedure for entering it: cause the bike to lean farther to the left; this causes it to steer farther to the left, which moves the wheel contact patches farther to the left, eventually reducing the leftward lean and exiting the turn.

A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study showed that rider lean has a larger influence on a lighter motorcycle than a heavier one, which helps explain why no-hands steering is less effective on heavy motorcycles. Leaning the torso with respect to the bike does not cause the bike to lean far enough to generate anything but the shallowest turns. No-hands riders may be able to keep a heavy bike centered in a lane and negotiate shallow highway turns, but not much else.

Complex maneuvers are not possible using weight shifting alone because even for a light machine there is insufficient control authority.
Although on a sufficiently light bike (especially a bicycle), the rider can initiate a lean and turn by shifting body weight, there is no evidence that complex maneuvers can be performed by bodyweight alone.

==Other uses==

The term countersteering is also used by some authors to refer to the need on bikes to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage. Motorcycle speedway racing takes place on an oval track with a loose surface of dirt, cinders or shale. Riders slide their machines sideways, powersliding or broadsiding into the turns, using an extreme form of this type of countersteering that is maintained throughout the turn. This also works, without power, for bicycles on loose or slippery surfaces, although it is an advanced technique.

The term is also used in the discussion of the automobile driving technique called drifting.

<text>Langley Frederick George &quot;Lang&quot; Hancock (10 June 1909 27 March 1992) was an Australian iron ore magnate from Western Australia who maintained a high profile in the spheres of business and politics. Famous initially for discovering the world&#x27;s largest iron ore deposit in 1952 and becoming one of the richest men in Australia, he is now perhaps best remembered for his marriage to the much-younger Rose Porteous, a Filipino woman and his former maid. Hancock&#x27;s daughter, Gina Rinehart, was bitterly opposed to Hancock&#x27;s relationship with Porteous. The conflicts between Rinehart and Porteous overshadowed his final years and continued until more than a decade after his death.

==Early life==
Hancock was born on 10 June 1909 in Leederville, Perth, Western Australia. He was the oldest of four children born to Lilian () and George Hancock; his mother was born in South Australia and his father in Western Australia. His father&#x27;s great-aunt was Emma Withnell, while a cousin was Sir Valston Hancock. Hancock spent his early childhood on his family&#x27;s station at Ashburton Downs, later moving to Mulga Downs Station in the north-west after his father, George Hancock, bought a farming estate there. After initially being educated at home, at the age of eight he began boarding at the St Aloysius Convent of Mercy in Toodyay. He later attended Hale School in Perth from 1924 to 1927, where he played for the school cricket and football teams. Upon completing his secondary education, he returned to Mulga Downs Station to help his father manage the property.

As a young man, Hancock was widely considered charming and charismatic. In 1935 he married 21-year-old Susette Maley, described by his biographer Debi Marshall as &quot;an attractive blonde with laughing eyes&quot;. The couple lived at Mulga Downs for many years, but Maley pined for city life and eventually left Hancock to return to Perth. Their separation – formalised in 1944 – was amicable. Also in 1935, Hancock took over the management of Mulga Downs station from his father. He partnered with his old schoolmate E. A. &quot;Peter&quot; Wright in running the property, later boasting that no deals between the two men were ever sealed with anything stronger than a handshake.

During the Second World War, Hancock served in a militia unit, the 11th (North-West) Battalion, Volunteer Defence Corps, and attained the rank of sergeant. On 4 August 1947, he married his second wife, Hope Margaret Nicholas, the mother of his only acknowledged child, Gina Rinehart. Lang and Hope remained married for 35 years, until her death in 1983 at the age of 66. In 2012, Hilda Kickett, who had long claimed to be Lang Hancock&#x27;s illegitimate daughter, claimed that the late mining magnate had had an illicit affair with an Aboriginal cook on his property at Mulga Downs resulting in her conception. These claims have not been corroborated.

==Wittenoom Gorge==
As a child, Hancock showed a keen interest in mining and prospecting from his uncle John Hancock Jr , and discovered asbestos at Wittenoom Gorge at the age of ten. He staked a claim at Wittenoom in 1934 and began mining blue asbestos there in 1938 with the company Australian Blue Asbestos.

The mine attracted the attention of national behemoths CSR Limited, who purchased the claim in 1943. Hancock retained a 49% share after the sale, but appears to have become quickly disillusioned about this arrangement, complaining that CSR viewed their 51% share as a licence to ignore his views. He sold the remainder of his claim in 1948. The mine would later become the source of much controversy, when hundreds of cases of asbestos-related diseases came to light. He was aware of the dangers of asbestos prior to selling his stake in Australian Blue Asbestos (as recently discovered papers have shown) but never accepted any liability, nor have his companies since his death. Neither the Australian federal government nor the Western Australian state government have pursued his companies for damages as of 2017.

==The Pilbara discovery==

On 16 November 1952, Hancock claimed he discovered the world&#x27;s largest deposit of iron ore in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Hancock said he was flying from Nunyerry to Perth with his wife, Hope, when they were forced by bad weather to fly low, through the gorges of the Turner River. In Hancock&#x27;s own words,
The story is widely accepted in modern descriptions of the discovery, but one biographer, Neill Phillipson, disputes Hancock&#x27;s account. In &quot;Man of Iron&quot; he argues that there was no rain in the area of the Turner River on 16 November 1952 or indeed on &quot;any&quot; day in November 1952, a fact the Australian Bureau of Meteorology confirms. Hancock returned to the area many times and, accompanied by prospector Ken McCamey, followed the iron ore over a distance of . He soon came to realise that he had stumbled across reserves of iron ore so vast that they could supply the entire world, thus confirming the discovery of the geologist Harry Page Woodward, who after his survey asserted:
After 1920 development of the Yampi Sound deposits started but exports to Japan were curtailed by the Commonwealth Government in 1938. Prospecting and exploration of other ore deposits continued until 1952 where an agreement between the Government of Western Australia and BHP to build a steel mill and smelter in Kwinana was established. All other iron ore, known or unknown, was reserved to the Crown for 9 years. Representations were made to the Commonwealth Government to have the embargo lifted and in 1960 limited approval was granted for the export of iron ore from non-BHP deposits. This sparked a wave of intensive prospecting and exploration concentrated in the North West, the Hamersley Ranges in particular, where formation had been known but ore bodies not yet delineated. At this time Hancock revealed his discovery. Hancock had lobbied furiously for a decade to get the ban lifted and in 1961 was finally able to reveal his discovery and stake his claim.

In the mid-1960s Hancock turned once more to Peter Wright and the pair entered into a deal with mining giant Rio Tinto Group to develop the iron ore find. Hancock named it &quot;Hope Downs&quot; after his wife. Under the terms of the deal Rio Tinto set up and still administer a mine in the area. Wright and Hancock walked away with annual royalties of A$25 million, split evenly between the two men. In 1990, Hancock was estimated by &quot;Business Review Weekly&quot; to be worth a minimum of A$125 million.

==Political activity==
Although Lang Hancock never aspired to political office, he held strong conservative political views and often entered the political arena. In addition to his activities in the 1950s, lobbying against government restrictions on the mining of iron ore, Hancock donated considerable sums of money to politicians of many political stripes. His political views aligned most closely with the Liberal and National Parties of Australia. He was a good friend and strong supporter of Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen and donated A$632,000 to the Queensland National Party while Bjelke-Petersen was in charge. He gave A$314,000 to their counterparts in Western Australia, but also gave the Western Australian Labor Party A$985,000; because &quot;at least they can&#x27;t do any harm&quot;. Hancock had had a falling-out with Sir Charles Court and the Western Australian Liberals and was adamant that the Liberals should be kept out of power as long as possible.

Hancock also offered strong advice to the politicians he favoured. In 1977 he sent a Telex to the then-Treasurer of Australia Sir Phillip Lynch, telling him he needed to &quot;stop money coming in to finance subversive activities, such as Friends of the Earth, which is a well-heeled foreign operation.&quot; He also suggested to Bjelke-Petersen that the Federal Government should attempt to censor the works of Ralph Nader and John Kenneth Galbraith, lest they &quot;wreck Fraser&#x27;s government&quot;.

In 1969 Hancock and his partner Peter Wright commenced publication in Perth of a weekly newspaper, &quot;The Sunday Independent&quot;, principally to help further their mining interests. Faced with strong competition, the newspaper is thought never to have turned a profit, Hancock largely relinquishing his interest in it in the early 70s and Wright selling it to &quot;The Truth&quot; in 1984.

Hancock was a staunch proponent of small government and resented what he considered to be interference by the Commonwealth Government in Western Australian affairs. He declared before a state Royal Commission in 1991 that &quot;I have always believed that the best government is the least government&quot;, and that &quot;Although governments do not and cannot positively help business, they can be disruptive and destructive.&quot;

Hancock bankrolled an unsuccessful secessionist party in the 1970s, and in 1979 published a book, &quot;Wake Up Australia&quot;, outlining what he saw as the case for Western Australian secession. The book was launched by Gina Rinehart and Bjelke-Petersen.

==Attitudes towards Aboriginal people==

Hancock is quoted as saying,
:&quot;Mining in Australia occupies less than one-fifth of one percent of the total surface of our continent and yet it supports 14 million people. Nothing should be sacred from mining whether it&#x27;s your ground, my ground, the blackfellow&#x27;s ground or anybody else&#x27;s. So the question of Aboriginal land rights and things of this nature shouldn&#x27;t exist.&quot;

In a 1984 television interview, Hancock suggested forcing unemployed indigenous Australians − specifically &quot;the ones that are no good to themselves and who can&#x27;t accept things, the half-castes&quot; − to collect their welfare cheques from a central location. &quot;And when they had gravitated there, I would dope the water up so that they were sterile and would breed themselves out in the future, and that would solve the problem.&quot;

In 1983, the same year as Hope Hancock&#x27;s death, Rose Lacson (now Porteous) arrived in Australia from the Philippines on a three-month working visa. By the arrangement of Hancock&#x27;s daughter, Gina Rinehart, Porteous began working as a maid for the newly widowed Lang Hancock.

Hancock and Porteous became romantically involved over the course of Porteous&#x27; employment and they were wed on 6 July 1985 in Sydney. It was a third marriage for each of them. Porteous, who was thirty-nine years younger than her husband, was often accused of gold digging because of their age disparity, as well as being unfaithful and promiscuous. As Porteous later stated: &quot;I have been accused of sleeping with every man in Australia ... I would have been a very busy woman.&quot; Hancock&#x27;s daughter, Gina Rinehart, who stood to inherit his entire estate, did not attend the wedding.
Although the marriage would later prove tumultuous, early on Hancock was clearly infatuated with his young wife. He gave her money and investments in real estate in the Sydney area. Porteous, in turn, helped Hancock to look and act like a much younger man, belying his eight decades. As &quot;The Age&quot; put it, &quot;Rose made Lang feel younger, sprucing up his wardrobe, dyeing his hair and getting rid of his cane.&quot; Together they built the &quot;Prix d&#x27;Amour&quot;, a lavish 16-block mansion overlooking the Swan River. The mansion, which was modelled after Tara, the plantation mansion from the movie &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, was the setting for many large parties at which Hancock and Porteous would &quot;dance into the night&quot;.

As the marriage wore on, however, the relationship between Lang and Rose began to break down. Rinehart would later claim that Hancock&#x27;s bride had paid little attention to his worsening health, but had instead &quot;screeched at him for money&quot;. Although there were many quarrels, the Hancocks remained married until Lang&#x27;s death in 1992.

On 25 June 1992, less than three months after Hancock&#x27;s death, Porteous married for the fourth time, to Hancock&#x27;s long-time friend William Porteous. Rinehart was indignant at the haste with which her stepmother had remarried.

The Prix d&#x27;Amour, built in 1990, was bulldozed in March 2006. Western Australian finance minister Max Evans mourned the loss of the home as the excavators moved in and recalled Hancock had been bemused by his wife&#x27;s desire for the sprawling mansion:

&quot;He&#x27;d say, &#x27;Mr Evans, I don&#x27;t know why Rose wants this house, I&#x27;d be happy sleeping in a transportable.&#x27; &quot;

Mrs Porteous told him she&#x27;d always wanted to live in Prix D&#x27;Amour, &quot;but I don&#x27;t want to clean it&quot;, she had added quickly.

==Death and inquest==
In March 1992 Hancock died, aged 82 years, while living in the guesthouse of the Prix D&#x27;Amour. According to his daughter, the death was &quot;unexpected&quot; and came &quot;despite strong will to live&quot;.

An autopsy showed that he had died of arteriosclerotic heart disease and police investigation revealed no evidence to contradict that. However, Hancock&#x27;s daughter insisted that her stepmother had unnaturally hastened his death. Two successive state coroners refused to allow an inquest, but one was eventually granted in 1999 under the direction of the WA Attorney-General, Peter Foss.

After preliminary hearings during 2000, the inquest began in April 2001 with an initial estimate of 63 witnesses to be called over five weeks. The inquest was dominated by claims that Porteous had literally nagged Hancock to death with shrill tantrums and arguments. Porteous denied the allegations, famously explaining: &quot;For anyone else it would be a tantrum, for me it&#x27;s just raising my voice.&quot; In the last few days of Hancock&#x27;s life, Porteous had attempted to pressure him into changing his will and Hancock eventually took out a restraining order against her. The inquest was put on hold after allegations that Rinehart had paid witnesses to appear and that some had lied in their testimony. It resumed three months later with a smaller witness list and ended with the finding that Hancock had died of natural causes and not as a result of Porteous&#x27; behaviour.

With a legal bill of A$2.7m, Rose and William Porteous commenced action against Rinehart, that was eventually settled out of court in 2003.

==Legacy==

Hancock&#x27;s daughter, Gina Rinehart, continues to chair Hancock Prospecting and its expansion into mining projects continues in Western Australia and other states of Australia, estimated to be earning about A$870 million in revenue in 2011. 
Rinehart is Australia&#x27;s richest person and was also the world&#x27;s richest woman for a period of time, with a net worth of 29.17 billion during 2012; by 2019, her wealth had eased to around $US14.8 billion, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;.

The Hancock Range, situated about north-west of the town of Newman at , commemorates the family&#x27;s contribution to the establishment of the pastoral and mining industry in the Pilbara region.

<doc id="1246147" wikidata="Q41715035" url="?curid=1246147" title="108-form Wu family tai chi">
<text>108-Form Wu family tai chi, also known as Wu Jianquan-style tai chi, is a traditional form of tai chi that originated in China. It is named after its creator, Wu Jianquan, who developed this style of tai chi in the early 20th century.

The different slow-motion solo-form training sequences of tai chi are the manifestations of tai chi best-known to the general public. In English, they are usually called the &quot;hand form&quot; or just the &quot;form.&quot; In Mandarin, it is usually called &quot;quan&quot; (). They are performed slowly by beginners and are said to promote concentration, condition the body, and acquaint students with the inventory of motion techniques for more advanced styles of martial arts training. There are also solo weapons forms, as well as much shorter and repetitive sequences to train power-generation-leverages as a form of &quot;qigong&quot;. The various forms of Wu-style pushing hands have their own one-person drill routines, as well, which fulfil some of the same functions as the power-generation drills.

== History ==
Wu Jianquan was born in 1870 in the Hebei province of China, into a family of martial artists. His father, Wu Quanyou, was a student of Yang Luchan, the founder of Yang-style tai chi. Wu Jianquan began learning martial arts from his father at a young age and later went on to study under Yang Banhou, the son of Yang Luchan.

In the early 1900s, Wu Jianquan founded his own school of tai chi in Shanghai, where he taught his unique style to students from all over China. He combined the principles of tai chi with his family&#x27;s martial arts techniques, creating a new style, which came to be known as Wu Jianquan-style tai chi.

== Training ==
Training in Wu Jianquan-style tai chi typically involves learning the basic movements and principles of tai chi, as well as the specific movements of the 108 forms. Students begin by learning the basic stances, hand and foot movements, and basic breathing techniques, before progressing to more advanced movements.

The style also includes partner drills and sparring exercises, where students learn to apply the principles of tai chi in a practical setting. In addition, Wu Jianquan-style tai chi also includes various forms of Qigong, or energy cultivation exercises that are designed to improve the body&#x27;s internal energy and to enhance health.

== Forms ==
The 108-Form Wu Family tai chi is a long and complex form, consisting of 108 movements that are performed in a slow, continuous, and flowing manner. It emphasizes the use of softness and yielding to overcome hardness and force, using circular movements and spiralling energy to deflect attacks and neutralize an opponent&#x27;s force.

The style emphasizes the importance of relaxation and internal energy, using the breath and the mind to guide the movements. Practitioners of Wu Jianquan-style tai chi believe that by cultivating internal energy, or Qi, they can enhance their health, improve their mental focus, and develop their martial arts skills.

=== List of forms ===
The following list is an English translation from Chinese of the empty-hand or fist-form list published in Wu Kung-tsao&#x27;s &quot;Wu Family T&#x27;ai Chi Ch&#x27;uan&quot;. Different schools will use different translations. Notably, the family&#x27;s Shanghai branch has a different enumeration scheme, numbering the same &quot;long form&quot; routine sequence with 89 posture names instead of 108. Almost all of the individual posture names are the same, however.

For each unique form name, there is a literal translation, the Hong Kong school&#x27;s translation, and then the Shanghai school&#x27;s translation in italics where they differ, followed by the original Chinese characters:

<text>Pannonia Inferior, lit. Lower Pannonia, was a province of the Roman Empire. Its capital was Sirmium. It was one of the border provinces on the Danube. It was formed in the year 103 AD by Emperor Trajan who divided the former province of Pannonia into two parts: Pannonia Superior and Pannonia Inferior. The province included parts of present-day states of Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The province was bordered to the east (across the Danube) by a Sarmatian tribe—the Iazyges. Later, the Vandals appeared to the north-east.

==Settlements==

Major settlements in Pannonia Inferior included:
* &quot;Sirmium&quot; (Sremska Mitrovica) which several times served as an imperial residence for several emperors.
* &quot;Aquincum&quot; (Buda), the provincial capital.
* &quot;Cuccium&quot; (Ilok)
* &quot;Cibalae&quot; (Vinkovci)
* &quot;Mursa&quot; (Osijek)
* &quot;Certissa&quot; (Đakovo)
* &quot;Marsonia&quot; (Slavonski Brod)
* &quot;Sopianae&quot; (Pécs)

==Aftermath and legacy==
The province was yet again split during the reign of the tetrarchs into two more provinces, Pannonia Valeria in the north, with the new provincial capital at Sopianae, and Pannonia Secunda in the south with Sirmium as the provincial capital. During the Frankish period, in the 9th century, the term Lower Pannonia was used to designate eastern and southern regions of Pannonia, including the Slavic Principality of Lower Pannonia, particularly Posavina.

<text>The California Public Employees&#x27; Retirement System (CalPERS) is an agency in the California executive branch that &quot;manages pension and health benefits for more than 1.5 million California public employees, retirees, and their families&quot;. In fiscal year 2020–21, CalPERS paid over $27.4 billion in retirement benefits, and over $9.74 billion in health benefits.

CalPERS manages the largest public pension fund in the United States, with more than $469 billion in assets under management as of June 30, 2021. CalPERS is known for its shareholder activism; stocks placed on its &quot;Focus List&quot; may perform better than other stocks, which has given rise to the term &quot;CalPERS effect&quot;. Outside the U.S., CalPERS has been called &quot;a recognized global leader in the investment industry&quot;, and &quot;one of America&#x27;s most powerful shareholder bodies&quot;.

As of 2018, the agency has $360 billion in assets, and is underfunded by an estimated $150 billion, with current assets below 70% of necessary to provide for liabilities. In an effort to reduce this shortfall, at the end of 2016 the board lowered their expected annual rate of return on investments from 7.5% to 7.0%, increasing the costs California cities must pay toward their workers&#x27; pensions.

==Statistics on pension payouts, 2018==

* Total payout = $22 billion
* Total beneficiaries = 600,000
* Overall average = $32,224 - (including payments to survivors and workers with only a few years of service)
* 20+ years of service average = $50,333
* 30+ years of service average = $66,373
* Police or Firefighters with 20+ years of service average = $78,104
* Number of retirees with $100,000+ pension = 26,000 (This is 4% of the total number of retirees, yet this group collected 17% of the total amount CalPERS paid out in 2018.)

For comparison:
* Average Social Security payout = $17,532

==History==
Discussion about providing for the retirement of California state employees began in 1921, but only in 1930 did California voters approve an amendment to the State Constitution to allow pensions to be paid to state workers, and only in 1931 was state law passed to establish a state worker retirement plan. In 1932, the &quot;State Employees&#x27; Retirement System&quot; (SERS) began operation. The California State Employees Association, established in 1931, began a close relationship with SERS that continues to this day.

In 1939, the state Legislature passed a bill that allowed local public agencies (such as cities, counties, and school districts) to participate in SERS. Initially, SERS could invest only in bonds, but in 1953 a new state law allowed SERS to invest in real estate. SERS then built a , 16-story building in Sacramento which opened in 1965; part of the building housed SERS employees, and part of the building was leased to other state agencies.

The &quot;first major new benefit for SERS members,&quot; health insurance, began in 1962 with the passage of a law that was later amended to become the &quot;Public Employees&#x27; Medical and Hospital Care Act&quot;. Because by 1967 SERS was contracting with 585 local public agencies for retirement benefits, its name was changed to the &quot;Public Employees&#x27; Retirement System&quot; (PERS). With the passage of a ballot proposition and a state law in 1966–1967, PERS was allowed to invest 25% of its portfolio in stocks; in 1984, Proposition 21 removed the 25% limitation.

State Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh was a PERS Board member in the mid-1980s. He began PERS&#x27; emphasis on corporate governance; in addition, he was instrumental in creating the Council of Institutional Investors, an organization of pension funds and other institutions that opposed &quot;greenmail and other corporate practices that benefited only management&quot;.

In 1986, the headquarters building of PERS, now called &quot;Lincoln Plaza North&quot;, was completed in Sacramento at a cost of $81 million. The building, which has , is known for its six-story-high atrium and landscaped terraces.

===Governor Pete Wilson===
In 1990, fund value reached $49.8 billion. In July 1991, Governor Pete Wilson addressed the state&#x27;s $14.3 billion budget deficit by removing $1.6 billion from the pension fund. Wilson further sought to give the governor&#x27;s office control of the PERS’ actuarial projections and the appointment of a majority of its board of directors. Public employee unions responded by seeking an amendment to the Constitution of California that would guarantee the board&#x27;s independence, remove the fund&#x27;s duty to minimize contributions or administrative costs, and require the provision of benefits to &quot;take precedence over any other duty.&quot; The initiative, known as Proposition 162, passed by a single percent at the November California elections, 1992. Proposition 162, also known as the &quot;California Pension Protection Act of 1992,&quot; gave the PERS board &quot;the sole and exclusive fiduciary responsibility over the assets of&quot; PERS.

To avoid confusion with public employees&#x27; retirement systems in other states, the organization&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;CalPERS&quot; in 1992. By 1996, the CalPERS portfolio was worth $100 billion, and the number of members exceeded 1 million.

===Governor Gray Davis===
In 1999, fund value reached $159.1 billion, requiring $159 million in state tax dollar contributions. In 1999, the CalPERS board proposed a benefits expansion that would allow public employees to retire at age 55 and collect more than half their highest salary for life. CalPERS predicted the benefits would require no increase in the State&#x27;s contributions by projecting an average annual return of 8.25% over the next decade. When Board member Phil Angelides’ aide questioned whether the stock market could grow that long, Board Chairman William Crist, a former union president, replied that they &quot;could make all sorts of different assumptions and make predictions, but that’s really more than I think we can expect our staff to do.&quot; CalPERS&#x27; chief actuary, objected, finding that it would be &quot;fairly catastrophic&quot; if the fund only grew at 4.4%.

The benefits expansion bill, SB 400, passed with unanimous backing by California State Assembly Democrats and was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis. CalPERS then produced a video promoting the legislation with Chairman Crist promising greater benefits &quot;without imposing any additional cost on the taxpayers&quot; and the California State Employees Association president praising it as &quot;the biggest thing since sliced bread&quot;.

The next year the dot-com bubble burst, and CalPERS did not grow, instead losing value in the stock market downturn of 2002. In 2001–2002, CalPERS provided technical assistance for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because it had sustained financial losses from the Enron and WorldCom bankruptcies. After the Great Recession, in 2009 CalPERS investments lost 24%, dropping $67 billion in value. Chairman Crist retired from the board and it was later revealed he had accepted more than $800,000 from a firm to ensure hundreds of millions of investment from CalPERS.

In November 2005, CalPERS expanded its headquarters with the &quot;Lincoln Plaza East &amp; West&quot; buildings which cost $265 million. The architecture of the buildings, which received praise, includes an entry tower high in a shape reminiscent of a tree which is made of steel covered with glass. The project was awarded a Gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating.

===Governor Jerry Brown===
In 2012, Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation that reduced benefits for all new state employees and sought to combat pension spiking. Legislators rejected Governor Brown&#x27;s proposals to include a 401(k) type defined contribution plan and to require CalPERS Board members to be independent, not themselves pensioners. Governor Brown promoted the reform as the &quot;biggest rollback to public pension benefits in the history of California&quot;, but it only resulted in a 1% to 5% reduction in contribution increases. Total savings from the reform are estimated to be $28 to $38 billion.

In the fall of 2014, CalPERS named Ted Eliopoulos as chief investment officer. He won the #2 ranking in the Public Investor 100 for 2016. Blackstone Group LP announced in November 2015 that it would acquire 43 international and domestic real estate funds from CalPERS for $3 billion.

In 2015, Kevin de León, who was the California State Senate majority leader at the time, introduced legislation to require CalPERS and CalSTRS divest from coal and the California Democratic Party passed a resolution in support of fossil fuel divestment. The bill was passed and, effective June 1, 2017, CalPERS was prohibited from maintaining holdings in companies that receive at least half of their revenue from thermal coal.

In 2016, CalPERS fund value reached $295.1 billion. State tax dollar contributions have had to increase to $45 billion, a 3,000% increase from before the 1999 benefits expansion. Promised benefits exceeded funds available by $241.3 billion. Unfunded retiree healthcare costs add an additional $125 billion to California&#x27;s public retirement debt.

=== Governor Gavin Newsom ===
During Gavin Newsom&#x27;s tenure, activists have increasingly called for CalPERS to more broadly divest from fossil fuels. On February 17, 2022, State Senator Lena Gonzalez introduced legislation that would require CalPERS and CalSTRS divest. The CalPERS board has opposed proposals to divest. The bill passed the state senate on May 25 but was halted in the assembly by Jim Cooper.

==Governance==

===Law===
The legal authority for the activities of CalPERS can be found in the constitution, laws, and regulations of the state of California, including:
* California Constitution, Article XVI, Section 17, under which (as amended by Proposition 162) &quot;the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall have plenary authority and fiduciary responsibility for investment of moneys and administration of the system&quot;.
* California Government Code, Title 2, Division 5, Parts 3-8 (i.e., Sections 20000–22970.89). Among other parts, Part 3 covers the administration of the retirement system including membership, contributions, and benefits; and Part 5 covers the Public Employees&#x27; Medical and Hospital Care Act on health benefits.
* California Code of Regulations, Title 2, Division 1, Chapter 2, Sections 550–559.554.

===Board of Administration===

CalPERS is overseen by a 13-member Board of Administration whose members are elected, appointed, or ex officio:
* Six are elected from CalPERS members (two by all CalPERS members, one by active State members, one by active CalPERS school members, one by active CalPERS public agency members, and one by retired members of CalPERS)
* Three are appointed (two by the Governor, one by specified leaders of the Legislature)
* Four are ex officio (California State Treasurer, California State Controller, Director of the California Department of Human Resources, and designee of the California State Personnel Board)

Notable past Board members have included Caspar Weinberger (1967–1969), Jesse Unruh (1983–1987), Gray Davis (1986–1994), Matt Fong (1995–1998), Kathleen Connell (1995–2003), Phil Angelides (1999–2006), Willie Brown (2000–2005), and Steve Westly (2003–2006).

As of 2017, the current Board members are Rob Feckner (President), Priya Sara Mathur, Michael Bilbrey, John Chiang, Richard Costigan, Richard Gillihan, JJ Jelincic, Henry Jones (Vice President), Ron Lind, Betty Yee, Bill Slaton, Teresa Taylor and Dana Hollinger.

====Controversies====
Between 1999 and 2001, several conflicts among Board members were notable:
* In 1999, after Board member Phil Angelides (also state treasurer) criticized a statement in a report, Board chairman Charles Valdes said about Angelides &quot;What we have here is a Greek treasurer who doesn&#x27;t like Turkey, the country; who doesn&#x27;t like Turks, who is trying to … drive our policy according to those ethnic hatreds&quot;. Angelides responded that he was &quot;do[ing] what is best for the state&quot;. Valdes later apologized for the remarks.
* Board member Kathleen Connell (also state controller) sued CalPERS in January 2001 to limit its investment managers&#x27; pay. Although CalPERS argued that the higher salaries were necessary to compete for qualified investment managers and that CalPERS had the authority under Proposition 162 to issue the higher salaries, it lost the lawsuit, which &quot;helped prompt the fund&#x27;s chief investment officer to quit&quot;.
* Valdes endorsed a lawsuit against the Board&#x27;s proposal to change its election procedures to require a majority vote (not simply a plurality vote) for Board seats chosen by CalPERS members.
In response to such conflicts, the Board took various measures (e.g., it adopted a &quot;document of collegiality&quot; in October 2001).

Other controversies have affected the Board, such as:
* In 1998, it was discovered that several Board members were &quot;taking expense-paid trips and other gifts from people trying to do business with&quot; CalPERS.
* Articles in 2002–03 issues of &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; noted cronyism and conflicts of interest among Board members.
* A president of the Board, Sean Harrigan, was removed from his position in December 2004 amid criticism for his activism on matters of corporate governance. He claimed his removal was politically motivated.
* In September 2014, California&#x27;s State controller, John Chiang criticized the fund for &quot;passive&quot; approach towards pension spiking - a practice of inflating workers&#x27; benefits just before retirement in order to boost their pensions- and failing to adequately review payroll data, inviting abuse.

===Executives===
CalPERS employees perform under the direction of the chief executive officer (CEO) of CalPERS. Past CEOs have been: Earl W. Chapman (1932–1956); Edward K. Coombs (acting, 1956); William E. Payne (1956–1974); Carl J. Blechinger (1975–1983); Sidney C. McCausland (1984–1986); Kenneth G. Thomason (acting or interim, 1987); Dale M. Hanson (1987–1994); Richard H. Koppes (interim, 1994); James E. Burton (1994–2002); Robert D. Walton (interim, 2002); Fred R. Buenrostro, Jr. (2002–2008); Kenneth W. Marzion (interim, 2008–2009); Anne Stausboll (2009–June 2016); and Marcie Frost (October 2016 – Present).

Reporting to the CEO, the executive officers of CalPERS are: deputy executive officers for customer services and support, health benefit programs, policy and planning, operations and technology, and external affairs; a general counsel; a chief actuary; and a chief financial officer; a chief information officer; a chief risk officer; and a chief investment officer. Under the executive officers, CalPERS employees work in 23 major branches, divisions, and offices. Approximately $415.1 million is budgeted in 2014-2015 for administrative functions in CalPERS, such as paying the salaries of 2,700 CalPERS employees.

==Operations==

===Investment income gains and losses 1999-2021===
CalPERS current fund balance value as of June 2021 is 466.66 Billion.

CalPERS derives its income from investments, from member contributions, and from employer contributions.

Investment Income has fluctuated in the last 15 years, 1999–2013, with five years of losses and 10 years of gains. There were investment income gains of $17 billion in 1999, $16 billion in 2000 and $5 billion in 2003. The stock market declines in 2001 led to investment income losses of 12 billion in 2001 and 10 billion in 2002. Thus, the five-year period 1999 to 2003 period had a cumulative income of $16 billion, or about three billion a year on an investment portfolio of over $200 billion.

The next four years were a period of investment income stability; a 24 billion investment income in 2004, 22 billion in 2005, 21 billion in 2006, and 41 billion in 2007. This four-year period had a cumulative investment income of $108 billion, or $27 billion a year.

With the stock market decline in 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, there were large investment income losses. There was a 12 billion dollar investment income loss in 2008 and 55 billion in 2009.

The 124 billion dollars of income in the nine-year period 1999-2007 was reduced by half as a consequence of the combined losses of 67 billion in 2008 and 2009. This totals to 57 billion dollars of investment income during this 11-year period, or about 5.1 billion a year on an investment portfolio of 261 billion in October 2007 and down to 186 billion in October 2008. This is a 2.5% return on investment over the 11-year period.

Income or loss from investments fluctuates from year to year; between 1998–99 and 2007–08, the highest income was $40.7 billion in 2006-07 and the greatest loss was $12.5 billion in 2007–08. As of October 2008, CalPERS had a total of $186.7 billion in assets invested as follows: $104.9 billion (56.2%) in equities, $41.0 billion (21.9%) in fixed income, $20.9 billion (11.2%) in real estate, $16.2 billion (8.7%) in cash equivalents, and $3.7 billion (2.0%) in inflation linked assets.

In 2010 CalPERS revised its strategic asset allocation mix using its Asset Liability Management process. By the end of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, CalPERS had a total of $257.9 billion in assets invested as follows: $166.3 billion (64 percent) in equities, $40.2 billion (16 percent) in fixed income, $25.8 billion (10 percent) in real assets, $10.6 billion (4 percent) in cash equivalents, $9.2 billion (4 percent) in inflation-linked assets, $5.2 billion (2 percent) in hedge funds, and $0.5 billion (0.0 percent) in multi-asset class and other.

===Shareholder activism===
Beginning in the 1980s, and especially in the early 1990s under the pioneering leadership of CEO Dale Hanson, CalPERS has used its influence as one of the largest shareholders in the world to change the way certain things are done in business. It is especially known for its shareholder activism concerning corporate governance, in which it has been described as the most influential pension fund and as &quot;a leader among activist institutions&quot;.

Among other examples of its shareholder activism, CalPERS has:
*Lobbied the board of General Motors (GM) &quot;to take a more active role in monitoring the company, which may have been a factor in the GM board&#x27;s ousting chairman Robert Stempel in 1992.
*Demanded in 1999 that U.S. companies in its portfolio disclose their Year 2000 problem readiness.
*Starting in 2000, &quot;screen[ed] all its investments in emerging markets for compliance with a number of human rights, environmental and labor standards&quot;.
*As of 2002, called on companies which operate in offshore havens to repatriate to the United States.
*With other pension funds, on September 16, 2003, called upon Richard Grasso to resign from the NYSE because of an exorbitant pay package; he resigned the next day.
*In 2003, sued the NYSE and seven specialist firms over allegations that the firms&#x27; floor workers engage in practices which hurt investors. The firms &quot;settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2005 and paid more than $240 million in fines without admitting or denying guilt&quot;. The part of CalPERS&#x27; lawsuit aimed at the NYSE itself was later thrown out of court, and in 2008 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to reinstate that part of the lawsuit.
*Called for reform in executive compensation, especially golden parachutes, in 2004.
*In 2004, with other parties, opposed Michael Eisner as chairman of the board and CEO of The Walt Disney Company; Eisner was removed as chairman of the board and in 2005 resigned as CEO.
*In 2006, banned investment of its funds in nine companies that do business in Sudan until the government of that country halts ongoing genocide; however, that decision was described as &quot;a largely symbolic gesture&quot; because CalPERS &quot;did not own a stake in any of the nine&quot;.
*From September 2006 through July, participated as lead plaintiff in a successful class-action lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group for options backdating. CalPERS had held &quot;6.6 million shares of UnitedHealth stock valued at $360 million&quot;. In August 2009, a federal judge in Minnesota ordered UnitedHealth to pay $895 million to settle the lawsuit; furthermore, former UnitedHealth CEO William W. McGuire would pay $30 million and relinquish options to buy 3.68 million UnitedHealth shares; another former executive would pay $500,000.
* With other institutional investors, requested in 2007 that the government &quot;set national, mandatory standards to cut greenhouse gas emissions&quot;.
* At Apple in 2013, CalPERS voted for a management proposal to implement majority voting for director elections and other proposals designed to enhance shareowner rights. This was a result of more than two years of engagement with Apple to change its voting standard for board candidates from a plurality model to a majority standard. Following successful CalPERS-sponsored shareowner resolutions supporting majority voting, in February 2013 Apple sponsored Proposal 2, which would amend Apple&#x27;s charter to provide for majority voting for directors. The proposal would also establish a par value for Apple stock and eliminate Apple&#x27;s ability to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval. CalPERS strongly supported Apple&#x27;s position that preferred stock should not be issued without shareowner approval. While the 2013 vote was canceled on a technicality, majority voting was officially adopted in 2014.
* At Nabors Industries in 2013 CalPERS sponsored a proposal to amend the company&#x27;s by-laws to require shareowner approval of severance benefits that exceed 2.99 times the sum of an executive&#x27;s base salary and bonus. CalPERS also voted for a proposal asking the board to elect an independent chair and for a proposal allowing shareowners to nominate candidates for election to the board.
* CalPERS is among the signatories of the &quot;Principles for a Responsible Civilian Firearms Industry,&quot; which seeks to engage firearms manufacturers, dealers, and retailers in promoting gun safety.

CalPERS has received some criticism for its shareholder activism:
* As of 2002, there was a concern that CalPERS&#x27; activism had distracted from &quot;its effectiveness as a corporate watchdog and its ability to provide for the 1.3 million public employees whose pensions it guarantees&quot;.
* Despite the efforts of CalPERS and others, the chief counsel of TIAA-CREF was quoted in 2003 as saying that there has been &quot;no countrywide improvement in corporate governance&quot;.
* CalPERS votes against some companies&#x27; directors &quot;whose sins are exceedingly small,&quot; such as &quot;attendance gaps or minor conflicts&quot;.
* Businesses describe CalPERS as having a &quot;pro-labor agenda&quot;, especially because of the dominance of Democrats on CalPERS&#x27; board.
* Some argue that CalPERS&#x27; actions unduly interfere with business and encourage the belief that California is &quot;anti-business&quot;.

===The Focus List and the &quot;CalPERS effect&quot;===
Beginning in 1987, CalPERS placed certain companies, with which it had &quot;concerns about stock and financial underperformance and corporate governance practices&quot; on a &quot;Focus List&quot;. The list was also referred to as a &quot;name and shame&quot; list. Beginning in 2010, CalPERS stopped publicly naming companies on the list and instead began dealing with such companies privately. In 2012, CalPERS initiated a program to monetize the Focus List. Each year, after the Board approves staff recommendations for Focus List companies, CalPERS increases investments in those companies. New Focus List companies are added to the portfolio each year, and the portfolio is rebalanced so that holdings remain equally weighted. The purpose of monetizing the Focus List is to replicate the Wilshire studies—using actual funds to demonstrate and measure the &quot;CalPERS Effect.&quot; Monetizing the Focus List also allows CalPERS to realize a return on the increased value that typically occurs following an engagement. In 2014, a study by Wilshire Associates showed the companies engaged by CalPERS significantly outperformed the Russell 1000.

====Analysis of performance of companies on the Focus List====
In 1994, Nesbitt published a study that found that companies on the Focus List trailed the S&amp;P 500 prior to being put on the list, but outperformed the S&amp;P 500 after being put on the list, and named this phenomenon the &quot;CalPERS effect&quot;. The term has been used in the newsmedia. Whether a &quot;CalPERS effect&quot; actually exists has been studied in a number of subsequent papers, including:
* Michael P. Smith (1996) determined that shareholder wealth increased for companies that adopted changes proposed by CalPERS or made changes that resulting in reaching a settlement with CalPERS; however, shareholder wealth decreased for companies that resisted CalPERS&#x27; proposals.
* Wahal (1996) analyzed the efficacy of pension-fund activism for CalPERS and eight other funds such as TIAA-CREF. Of the firms targeted by the nine funds, &quot;only firms targeted by Calpers experience[d] a positive stock price reaction&quot;.
* Crutchley et al. (1998) discovered that CalPERS&#x27; &quot;less visible activism&quot; in 1995-1997 corresponded with less returns on stocks than in 1992-1994 when CalPERS&#x27; activism was more aggressive.
* Two studies published by CalPERS staff (i.e., Anson et al.) in 2003-2004 found that stocks on the CalPERS Focus List experience &quot;positive excess stock returns of about 12% over the three months following release of the list&quot; and &quot;an average one-year cumulative excess return of 59.4 per cent&quot;.
* English et al. (2004) concluded that CalPERS targeting produces a statistically significant improvement in short-term returns but not necessarily in long-term returns (depending on the specific methods used to calculate long-term returns).
* Nelson (2006) claimed that his study addressed problems in the methodologies of previous studies (e.g., by controlling for the &quot;contaminating events&quot; of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; articles appearing just before or just after the dates that CalPERS released Focus List information). He found &quot;no evidence to support the persistence of a &#x27;CalPERS effect&#x27;&quot; after 1993.
* Barber (2006) asserted that in his analyses &quot;CalPERS activism yields small, but reliably positive, market reactions&quot; in the short term. In contrast, although the long-term returns of companies &quot;are uniformly positive and economically large&quot; after being placed on the CalPERS Focus List, due to market volatility he could not conclude that the long-term returns were unusual. Barber&#x27;s paper won a 2006 prize for best study in the area of socially responsible investing from the Haas School of Business.
* Junkin and Toth (2008), in an update of Nesbitt&#x27;s 1994 study, found that the &quot;CalPERS effect&quot; was still present in that &quot;the average targeted company produced excess returns of 15.7% above their respective benchmark return on a cumulative basis,&quot; but that the effect had decreased over time.

===Notable investments===
*The agency both lost and gained from investments in Enron (which went bankrupt in 2001) and its affiliated companies. Its losses included common stock worth $40 million; &quot;stock in a different portfolio, some bonds and a separate investment in New Power Co.&quot; worth $100 million; and $4 million from the liquidation of Enron&#x27;s JEDI II project (i.e., CalPERS had paid $175 million for its stake but received only $171 million in return). However, as CalPERS had earned $132.5 million from the sale of its stake in Enron&#x27;s JEDI I project to Enron&#x27;s Chewco project, its total Enron losses were only about $11 million. Although CalPERS &quot;was alerted by its advisers in December 2000 about the serious and potentially embarrassing conflicts inherent in one of a web of private partnerships set up by Enron&#x27;s chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow&quot;, it later denied that it could have taken actions to prevent Enron&#x27;s downfall. Nevertheless, as a result of the Enron experience, in 2002 the CalPERS board did resolve to improve accounting and auditing standards among companies in which it invests.
*In June 2000, CalPERS announced that it would invest $500 million in biotech as part of its California Biotechnology Program. Ultimately, $235 million went to California-base venture capital firms specializing in the biotech sector.
*In 2002, the Republican Party questioned CalPERS&#x27; investing $100 million in a firm that was co-founded by a Democratic supporter. CalPERS denied any political influence in its investment decision.
*In 2002, it was revealed that CalPERS had invested $700 million in venture capital funds of billionaire Ronald Burkle who had donated &quot;$1.9 million to Democratic candidates and causes&quot;. Phil Angelides denied that CalPERS made its decision because of the donations.
*As of 2002, CalPERS had invested $3.5 billion in &quot;underserved areas of California&quot;.
*In 2002, CalPERS evaluated emerging markets for &quot;evidence of political stability, humane labor laws, a fair and functional legal system and financial transparency&quot;; on the basis of the evaluation, CalPERS placed the Philippines on &quot;probation&quot; for investment. In 2004, a consultant&#x27;s recommendation to remove the Philippines from the &quot;approved&quot; list &quot;contributed to a 3.3% drop... in the $55-billion Manila stock market&quot;. By 2006, CalPERS had given higher ratings to the Philippines, for which its President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo personally expressed appreciation.
*CalPERS has been criticized for being foolish to invest in collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) before the July 2007 mortgage meltdown and for not publicly addressing the issue.
*In June 2008, after Los Angeles-area property developer LandSource filed for bankruptcy protection, CalPERS was criticized for having invested $947 million in LandSource in 2007; a CalPERS spokesperson described the investment as &quot;small&quot; relative to CalPERS&#x27; total assets.
*As of 2021, CalPERS has invested about $30 billion in fossil fuels, which has been criticized by environmentalists.

===Studies commissioned by CalPERS on its economic impacts===
CalPERS commissioned three studies that were released in 2007-2008 about the economic impacts of the following:
* CalPERS retirement benefits payments. Prepared by California State University, Sacramento, and released in April 2007, this study found that the direct payments of $7.7 billion in 2006 led to a total impact (including &quot;the ripple effect of business and government revenues as spending from... benefit checks works its way through the economy&quot;) of $11.8 billion.
* CalPERS investments. Prepared by California State University, Sacramento, and released in September 2007, this study found that the direct investments of $8.3 billion in 2006 led to a total impact of $15.1 billion.
* CalPERS health care benefits payments. Prepared by Lincoln Crow Benefits Research Group and released in April 2008, this study found that the direct payments of $4.2 billion in 2006 led to a total impact of $7.6 billion.

Key findings of the &quot;CalPERS Economic Impacts in California Report&quot; for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 included:
* CalPERS benefits (retirees spending their pensions) returned $10.85 in economic activity to California for each taxpayer dollar (public funds) contributed to the system.
* The total economic revenue generated by CalPERS benefits was more than $30.4 billion.
* CalPERS benefits created 113,664 jobs throughout California.
* Investments in California accounted for $20.7 billion, or approximately 8.9 percent, of the CalPERS portfolio.
* The CalPERS investment portfolio, which included public and private equities, real estate, fixed income, and infrastructure, supported 1.5 million jobs.

CalPERS touted the studies as demonstrating the value of the agency with news releases such as &quot;CalPERS and CalSTRS Pensions Power Up State and Local Economies&quot;. The studies and their use by CalPERS were criticized as follows:
* A reporter summarized the opinion of the lead author of the first study as &quot;his study was never intended as any sort of implied commentary on the wisdom of CalPERS&#x27; policies&quot;.
* If the money that CalPERS paid in benefits were returned to taxpayers, the money would be spent and would therefore still cause &quot;ripple effects&quot;.
* The economic impact &quot;might be the same if a private investment firm managed the fund&#x27;s portfolio&quot;.

===Employee recognition program===
Among other &quot;offerings to ensure [its] workers are happy as well as healthy,&quot; CalPERS has an onsite Montessori method child care facility, conducts employee surveys every two years, offers a training and wellness program, and administers a nationally known employee recognition program. The employee recognition program has several components:
* An informal day-to-day employee-to-employee program with a &quot;You are the Rock&quot; theme. The program includes a river rock that is passed around to employees who are &quot;rock solid,&quot; rock-shaped notes with appreciative sentiments written on them, and rock-themed e-cards.
* The quarterly ACE (Achieving Communication Excellence) award, consisting of a lapel pin and an informal celebration.
* A formal annual recognition called APEX (Achieving Performance Excellence), with a crystal trophy, a cash award, and a luncheon.
* Managers are &quot;encouraged to thank workers more often&quot; and &quot;are graded for the amount of ongoing feedback they gave employees&quot;.

Two CalPERS employees received 2000 National Association for Employee Recognition (NAER) Recognition Champion Awards for the employee recognition program. In addition, CalPERS itself won a 2002 Best Practices award from NAER. The employee recognition program was reported to contribute to high employee satisfaction and a low employee turnover rate at CalPERS.

==Contributions==

===Member contributions===
CalPERS members contribute a percentage of their salary throughout their active membership. Member contribution rates are set by statute and can vary by membership category (miscellaneous or safety) and by benefit formula. Member contribution rates can change based on legislative law changes. However, the rise and fall of the contribution percentages does not affect member-accrued retirement benefits, which are guaranteed by law.

The percentage contributed above the monthly compensation breakpoint depends upon the benefit formula as shown in the &quot;employee contributions&quot; subsection of the summary of Plan Provisions in Appendix B of each public agency, state and schools annual valuation report.

With the passage of Assembly Bill 340 (AB 340), the pension reform legislation by the California Legislature, CalPERS members hired after January 1, 2013, are expected to pay 50 percent of the Total Normal Cost of the benefit plan in which they participate.

===Employer contributions===
On average, schools and other public agencies contribute 12.7% of payroll for their employees&#x27; retirement benefits; however, the rates can increase if CalPERS&#x27; investments perform unfavorably and decrease if CalPERS&#x27; investments perform favorably. According to CalPERS, &quot;The School Pool contribution rate is affected by the investment return of a given fiscal year in the second year that follows&quot; and &quot;Local public agency contribution rates are affected by the investment return of a given fiscal year in the third fiscal year that follows&quot;. CalPERS&#x27; earnings and losses are averaged over 15 years to prevent extreme changes in employers&#x27; contribution rates. Nevertheless, in 2008 &quot;CalPERS warned that it might ask for more money from the state starting in July 2010 and from local-government employers starting in July 2011&quot; if CalPERS&#x27; investments are performing poorly as of June 30, 2009.

Employers’ contributions and stated unfunded liabilities are calculated using actuarial present value, which assumes the fund will continually grow at 7.5%. However, if an employer seeks to leave CalPERS, it will be required to immediately payoff the undisclosed current market value of the unfunded liabilities, which only assumes 2.56% growth. At a 2011 legislative hearing, Governor Jerry Brown called CalPERS asserted reliance on bringing in new members &quot;a Ponzi scheme&quot;.

After the financial crisis of 2007–2008, many cities in California came under financial stress due to a combination of factors, which led to three high-profile municipal bankruptcy filings by Vallejo, Stockton, and San Bernardino that received nationwide attention. During the proceedings some creditors accused CalPERS&#x27;s increased post-crisis employer payments and future unfunded liabilities as a cause of insolvency and sought to have CalPERS employer contributions reduced. This was vigorously opposed by CalPERS. According to 2011 state figures, the CalPERS system is 78% funded with unfunded future liabilities of $133 billion. Non-government estimates show a larger shortfall.

==Benefits==
CalPERS provides benefits to all state government employees and, by contract, to local agency and school employees. CalPERS administers the following categories of benefits to members:
* Retirement benefits under defined benefit plans
* Deferred compensation and other supplemental income plans
* Disability retirement and industrial disability retirement
* Death benefits
* Health benefits
* Long-term care benefits

===Retirement benefits under defined benefit plans===
As of 2020, CalPERS paid monthly allowances to 732,529 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries. In the fiscal year 2019-20, CalPERS paid $25.8 billion in benefits. The retirement benefits &quot;are calculated using a member&#x27;s years of service credit, age at retirement, and final compensation (average salary for a defined period of employment),&quot; and the retirement formulas &quot;are determined by the member&#x27;s employer (State, school, or local public agency); occupation (miscellaneous (general office and others), safety, industrial, or peace officer/firefighter); and the specific provisions in the contract between CalPERS and the employer&quot;.

In addition, CalPERS administers the Legislators&#x27; Retirement System, Judges&#x27; Retirement System, and Judges&#x27; Retirement System II.

Besides CalPERS, California has a number of other public retirement systems, including:
* At least 22 counties (Alameda, Contra Costa, Fresno, Imperial, Kern, Los Angeles, Marin, Mendocino, Merced, Orange, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco [county as well as city], San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Tulare, and Ventura)
* At least 6 cities (Concord, Fresno, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco [also a county], and San Jose)
* The University of California
* The California State Teachers&#x27; Retirement System (CalSTRS)
CalPERS has reciprocity agreements with many of these California public retirement systems that allow retirees with service credit and contributions in two systems to receive payments from both systems.

Some people prefer defined contribution plans to CalPERS&#x27; defined benefit plan. For example:
* In 1996, Howard Kaloogian sponsored a bill in the State Assembly to allow state employees to choose between CalPERS&#x27; defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan; the bill failed in a State Senate committee.
* In early 2005, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed a ballot initiative to require new public employees to join a 401(k)-like plan, but dropped the proposal after opposition to a provision in the initiative to &quot;reduce benefits for widows of officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty&quot;.
* In November 2008, the voters of the city of Pacific Grove passed an advisory measure to leave CalPERS in favor of a defined contribution plan.
Among other arguments, CalPERS claims that defined contribution plans cost more to manage than defined benefit plans and fail to provide adequate funds to retirees.

===Deferred compensation and other supplemental income plans===

CalPERS is responsible for a deferred compensation retirement plan (457 plan) and two other plans to supplement income after retirement or permanent separation from State employment. As of December 2014:
* The CalPERS 457 Plan serves 27,526 participants and had $1.296 billion in assets.
* The Peace Officers&#x27; &amp; Firefighters&#x27; Defined Contribution Plan had 33,128 participants and $497 million in assetsfunded by a State contribution of 2% of base pay.
* A member-funded Supplemental Contributions Program for 521 participants had $20.3 million in assets.

===Disability retirement and industrial disability retirement===

CalPERS offers two types of retirement benefits if a worker is disabled. In &quot;industrial disability retirement,&quot; the &quot;disability is due to a job-related injury or illness&quot;; in contrast, &quot;disability retirement&quot; implies that the disability was not necessarily caused by employment. The specific benefits vary by employer, by the contract between CalPERS and the employer, and by the employee&#x27;s occupation.

Two major controversies have affected CalPERS&#x27; disability retirement and industrial disability retirement program over the years. First, in the mid-1990s and again in the mid-2000s there were concerns about inappropriate industrial disability retirement for public safety personnel, including:
* Some non-disabled persons fraudulently claim industrial disability retirement, such as &quot;a &#x27;disabled&#x27; highway patrol officer riding in a rodeo.&quot; Unfortunately, &quot;state law forbids Calpers from requiring disabled retirees who are 50 or older to submit to another medical evaluation, even if there is evidence of possible fraud&quot;.
* &quot;A series of bills that expanded eligibility for these medical pensions - and made it easier to get them&quot; increased costs for state and local governments.
* The list of &quot;disabilities automatically presumed to be job-related for public-safety workers&quot; has grown to include diseases and conditions that may or may not be caused by employment, such as lower back pain, heart disease, cancer, syphilis, HIV, and mad cow disease.
* Retirees can receive two safety disability retirements for the same condition if they are covered by two separate pension systems.
* Because California law prevents light-duty assignments in the California Highway Patrol, some officers are &quot;forced to retire against their will.&quot;

Second, &quot;a 1980 state law that tied public safety officers&#x27; disability benefits to the age at which they were hired&quot; caused an age discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1992 which eventually led to a 1995 class action lawsuit against CalPERS and other state and local agencies. In January 2003, CalPERS settled the suit by agreeing to pay $50 million in retroactive benefits and $200 million in future benefits to 1,700 officers; the settlement &quot;was by far the largest in the EEOC&#x27;s history&quot;. Furthermore, CalPERS agreed to not use an age-based formula in the future, which &quot;basically nullifie[d]&quot; the 1980 state law.

===Death benefits===

If a CalPERS member dies before retirement, CalPERS may provide death benefits to certain beneficiaries. The benefits can include one-time payments and/or monthly payments, but &quot;depend on the member&#x27;s age, years of service, job classification, employer&#x27;s contract with CalPERS, eligible beneficiary, date of separation from employment, and whether or not they were eligible to retire at the time of death&quot;.

===California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust Fund===
The California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust Fund was established by CalPERS in March 2007 to provide California public agencies with a cost-efficient, professionally managed investment vehicle for prefunding other post-employment benefits (OPEB) such as retiree health benefits. Prefunding reduces an agency&#x27;s long-term OPEB liability. Participating agencies can use investment earnings to pay future OPEB liabilities, similar to the CalPERS pension fund in which three out of four dollars paid in retirement benefits come from investment earnings.

===Health benefits===
In 1961, the Meyer-Geddes Hospital and Medical Health Care Act was passed, which led to SERS&#x27; offering health insurance for state employees beginning in 1962. After the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Act of 1973, PERS began to deal with HMOs &quot;to create more unified and standardized health care benefit rates&quot;. In 1978, the Meyer-Geddes Act was renamed the &quot;Public Employees&#x27; Medical and Hospital Care Act&quot;.

By the early 1990s, CalPERS received national attention for its attempt at implementing &quot;managed competition,&quot; which is the theory that health care costs &quot;can be controlled by forcing health providers to compete with one another under government supervision&quot;. As of 1994–1995, CalPERS contracted with 24 health plans for its &quot;over 900,000&quot; members and was able to reduce health insurance premiums by 1% compared with 1993–1994. At the time CalPERS was &quot;called a model for the so-called health alliances&quot; proposed in the 1993 Clinton health care plan.

Rates continued to decline by 5.3% in 1996 and 1.4% in 1997, but rose by 2.7% in 1998 and 5.1% in 1999. CalPERS attracted national attention again in the mid-2000s, this time for health maintenance organization rate increases of 25% in 2004 and 18% in 2005. Meanwhile, the number of participating plans dropped to seven as of 2003, and &quot;more than two dozen cities, counties and school districts&quot; (representing 4% of membership) left CalPERS as of 2004 because of high medical insurance rates.

A 2006 study by the Government Accountability Office determined that from 1997 through 2002 the average annual growth in CalPERS premiums (6.5%) was lower than that of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP, 8.5%) and of other surveyed employer-sponsored health benefit programs (7.1%); however, between 2003 and 2006–7, the average annual growth rate in CalPERS premiums (14.2%) was higher than that of FEHBP (7.3%) and of other surveyed employer-sponsored health benefit programs (10.5%). As of 2008, CalPERS eliminated copayments for preventive care visits, raised copayments for other types of office visits, and took other measures in an attempt to reduce costs.

In 2010, Blue Shield of California, Dignity Health, and Hill Physicians Medical Group initiated an integrated health management program (similar to an Accountable Care Organization) that covered 41,000 CalPERS members.

In 2019, CalPERS provided more than $9.2 billion in health benefits for 1.5 million active and retired state, public agency, and school workers and their dependents. Therefore, it was the nation&#x27;s second largest public purchaser of health benefits, behind the FEHBP which covered &quot;about 8 million federal employees, retirees, and their dependents&quot;. Of the enrollees, 59% are state employees and 41% are local government and school employees; 68% are working and 32% are retired.

Enrollees can join three types of plans:
* 68% are enrolled in health maintenance organization plans administered by Blue Shield of California and by Kaiser Permanente.
* 25% are enrolled in preferred provider organization plans called &quot;PERS Select,&quot; &quot;PERSCare,&quot; and &quot;PERS Choice,&quot; which are administered by Anthem Blue Cross (the California subsidiary of WellPoint). 
* 7% are enrolled in &quot;association&quot; plans for the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, and the Peace Officers Research Association of California.

===Long-term care benefits===
California&#x27;s &quot;Public Employees&#x27; Long-Term Care Act,&quot; as passed in 1990 and amended in 1996, led to CalPERS&#x27; administering a Long-Term Care Program for &quot;California public employees and retirees, as well as their spouses, parents, parents-in-law, adult children and adult siblings between the ages of 18 and 79.&quot; Described as the &quot;largest self-funded program of its kind&quot;, the program provides &quot;nursing home care, residential assisted living, home health care, homemaker services and adult day care&quot;.

The program is funded by participant premiums and by proceeds from investments in the CalPERS Long-Term Care Fund. During an economic downturn in 2002, premiums for the program rose an average of 9% and investment losses were $99 million. Another premium increase of an average of 33.6% occurred in 2007 due to &quot;a projected $600 million shortfall in the program over the next 50 to 60 years&quot;. The causes of the deficit predicted as of 2007 were less investment income than expected, a higher volume of claims than expected, and a lower dropout rate than expected. As of 2020, the program had 116,832 members who paid annual premiums of $278.5 million and who collectively received $337.3 million in benefits annually.

As of December 2014, the LTC program had 144,936 enrolled participants who paid annual premiums of more than $168 million from July 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013. The average premium collected during that time period was $2,177. The decrease in the total long-term care participant count may be attributable to the LTC program stabilization and sustainability measures and realized participant population morbidity.

The total benefits paid since the LTC program&#x27;s inception in 1995 through June 30, 2013 have reached approximately $1.3 billion. A summary of plan types and a five-year historical participant count are available online in the CalPERS Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.

===Member Home Loan Program===
As of December 15, 2010, the CalPERS Board of Administration approved the suspension of the CalPERS Member Home Loan Program and stopped accepting new applications.

==Unfunded Liabilities Crisis==
CalPERS faces significant unfunded liabilities which is likely to challenge its long-term financial stability. Official estimates place the liabilities at approximately $150 billion, an increase from $22 billion in 2002. The unfunded liabilities figure is a projection that takes into account returns on CalPERS investments. The $150 billion figure is based on a long term return of 7%; if the returns are higher, the true liability is much smaller, but if returns are lower than the liabilities are much larger. CalPERS itself projects that it will return 6.1% over the next decade and 8.3% for the decade after that. 
There are significant concerns that to keep up, contributions by municipal and state authorities will have to rise drastically, putting financial strain on those authorities.

According to the CalPERS chart &quot;Historical Factors Impact Funded Status (1993-2018)&quot;, the most recent year with no unfunded liabilities was FY 2007.

==Criticisms==

CalPERS has received criticism for the number of retirees (26,000 in 2018) who collect over $100,000 a year in pension. That group of people, while less than 4 percent of the total number of retirees receiving benefits from CalPERS, collect 17 percent of the total yearly pension payouts.

<text>Dr. Luis Rafael Sánchez, a.k.a. &quot;Wico&quot; Sánchez (November 17, 1936) is a Puerto Rican essayist, novelist, and short-story author who is widely considered one of the island&#x27;s most outstanding contemporary playwrights. Possibly his best known play is &quot;La Pasión según Antígona Pérez&quot; (The Passion according to Antigona Perez), a tragedy based on the life of Olga Viscal Garriga.

==Early years==
Sánchez was born and raised by his parents in the city of Humacao, Puerto Rico, in the eastern part of Puerto Rico. There he received his primary education. His family moved to San Juan, where Sánchez continued to receive his secondary and higher education. He enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico in 1955 after graduating from high school, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree. It was during his days as a student at the university that he became interested in acting. There he was taught by Victoria Espinosa.

Sánchez&#x27;s interest in literature led him to enroll at the City University of New York where in 1959 he earned his master&#x27;s degree in dramatic arts. He eventually went to Madrid, Spain and earned his Doctorate in Literature in 1976 from the Complutense University of Madrid.

==&quot;La Pasión según Antigona Pérez&quot;==

Sánchez&#x27;s best known play is &quot;La Pasión según Antigona Pérez&quot; (The Passion of Antigona Perez), a tragedy set in present-day Latin America, suggested by Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot;. The character of Antigona was based on the life of Olga Viscal Garriga (1926–1995). Her life was rooted in politics and her three children. She was a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and an accomplished speaker who spent time in jail for her political beliefs yet, she saw herself as a simple woman with simple needs. But, in fact, she was a very complex woman with many facets of her personality. The world premiere production took place in 1968 at Old San Juan&#x27;s Tapia Theater, starring Myrna Vázquez as &quot;Antigona&quot;, during the 11th Annual Puerto Rican Theater Festival.

A highly acclaimed all-star revival opened in 1991 at San Juan&#x27;s Performing Arts Center featuring Alba Nydia Diaz as Antigona, Walter Rodriguez as Creon, Samuel Molina as Monsignor Escudero, Marian Pabon as Pilar Vargas, Noelia Crespo as Aurora, and Julia Thompson as Irene. The production, which integrated video and broadcast technology, was directed by Idalia Perez Garay for Teatro del Sesenta Theater Company. It featured original music by Pedro Rivera Toledo, sets by Checo Cuevas, and film sequences supervised by Puerto Rican filmmaker Luis Molina Casanova. A new production opened at San Juan&#x27;s Performing Arts Center on April 8, 2011, featuring Yamaris Latorre as Antigona, directed by Gilberto Valenzuela for Tablado Puertorriqueño Theater Company.

==&quot;La Guaracha del Macho Camacho&quot; (Macho Camacho&#x27;s Beat)==
&quot;La Guaracha del Macho Camacho&quot; (Macho Camacho&#x27;s Beat) was published in 1976. This novel moves to a guaracha, a Latin rhythm, inviting readers to imagine (or learn) what this beat sounds like. It has been suggested that the song itself is the real protagonist of the tale. The Americanization of Puerto Rico is explored in this work, as well as the topic of Puerto Rican politics and the political situation of the island as a colony. One aspect of this examination can be seen as a critique of Puerto Ricans who give up their culture to assimilate into the American culture as compared to Puerto Ricans who refuse to let go of their cultural identity. The book was translated into English by Gregory Rabassa.

In his essay &quot;La guagua aérea&quot; (&quot;The Flying Bus&quot;), Sánchez explores the concept of a bi-polar culture, the question of assimilation and opposition to U.S. Anglo culture. He coined the term &quot;La guagua aérea&quot; which has since been used by other prominent Puerto Rican authors such as Giannina Braschi who pays homage to Sánchez&#x27;s classic essay in her Spanglish novel &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot;. He also wrote &quot;En cuerpo de camisa&quot; (&quot;In Shirt Sleeves&quot;, 1966), a collection of short stories.

Luis Rafael Sánchez is now a professor emeritus at the University of Puerto Rico and the City University of New York. He travels to Europe and Latin America, where he has been involved in the teachings and works of theater.

<doc id="1246191" wikidata="Q173104" url="?curid=1246191" title="RAM Racing">
<text>RAM Racing was a Formula One racing team which competed during the racing seasons of 1976 to 1985. The team entered other manufacturers&#x27; chassis from 1976 to 1980, then ran March&#x27;s team from 1981 to 1983, only entering a car entirely their own in 1984 and 1985.

The team was formed in 1975 by Mike Ralph and John Macdonald, with RAM derived from their names. After running Macdonald in a GRD in British Formula Three, they entered Alan Jones in a Formula 5000 March for 1976. They also bought a pair of Brabham BT44B Formula One cars, and entered the 1976 World Championship, running Loris Kessel and Emilio de Villota for the Spanish Grand Prix, where neither qualified. However, both Kessel and another pay-driver, Patrick Nève, qualified for the Belgian Grand Prix, with Jac Nellemann, Damien Magee, Lella Lombardi and Bob Evans all making appearances in the cars. There were few finishes, and the pay-drivers meant the team were frequent non-qualifiers.

For 1977, Boy Hayje drove a RAM-entered March with little success, and a second &quot;rent-a-car&quot; did no better later in the year when driven by Andy Sutcliffe, Mikko Kozarowitzky or Michael Bleekemolen. However, they had some success running Guy Edwards in the Shellsport Group 8 Championship in Britain, finishing 2nd overall. For 1978 the team switched to the British Aurora Formula One series, with Edwards placing 4th overall that year in a March, and 5th overall the following season in a Fittipaldi F5A. For 1980, RAM made an investment in a pair of 1979-spec Williams FW07s, with Emilio de Villota winning the title. Sponsorship included American men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Penthouse&quot;. They then entered one of these cars for Rupert Keegan in the British Grand Prix. Kevin Cogan and Geoff Lees would guest in another car in the last two rounds, but their best finish was Keegan&#x27;s 9th place at the United States Grand Prix.

1981 saw RAM manage and run the returning March Grand Prix team, with Derek Daly and Eliseo Salazar driving. However, non-qualifications were frequent, and the team failed to score any points, Daly&#x27;s 7th place at the British Grand Prix being their best result.

The combination stayed together for 1982, landing backing from Rothmans, and the new March 821 saw design work from a young Adrian Reynard. With veteran Jochen Mass to lead the team, backed up by Raul Boesel, hopes were high, but it was another disappointing year. Mass took 7th place at the Detroit Grand Prix, but as the car proved to be slow he lost motivation, and focused more on sports car racing with Porsche. From the German Grand Prix, Keegan took over the car, but RAM March once again failed to score points.
1983 saw the RAM name make itself onto the chassis for the first time, with Dave Kelly&#x27;s RAM March 01 design. Salazar returned to drive the main entry, while a second car for Jean-Louis Schlesser was fielded at the French Grand Prix as a one-off. Salazar scored a 15th place in the season opener, but the bulky car struggled to qualify. Financial reasons saw the team skip the Detroit Grand Prix, while they only made the Canadian Grand Prix due to fielding local driver Jacques Villeneuve, Sr. and attracting some Canadian sponsorship. Kenny Acheson then took over for the rest of the season, only qualifying once, at the season-closing South African Grand Prix, where he took the team&#x27;s best result of the year, 12th and last.

Astonishingly, the team pressed on into 1984. The partnership with March was dissolved, and RAM attracted sponsorship from Skoal Bandit. Two RAM 02 cars, with Hart turbo engines, were entered for Formula Two champion Jonathan Palmer and Philippe Alliot. Kelly&#x27;s new design was disappointing, and the cars were frequent back-markers, and Palmer&#x27;s 8th place in the opening Brazilian Grand Prix was their best result of the year (and of all time). Indeed, the team drew more notices for the crashes their drivers were involved in.
Alliot remained for 1985, with Manfred Winkelhock entered in the second car, and a new RAM 03 designed by Gustav Brunner. Winkelhock put in some improved qualifying performances, but actual results were still thin. Winkelhock&#x27;s death in a sports car event in Canada in the summer was a blow to the team, and Acheson was recalled briefly, before the team slimmed down to a single entry. They missed the final two rounds altogether. Skoal withdrew their backing at the end of the year, the team&#x27;s best result having been Alliot&#x27;s 9th place, again at the opening Brazilian Grand Prix.

The team planned to enter a single updated RAM 03 for Mike Thackwell (who had stood in for Palmer at the 1984 Canadian Grand Prix) for the season, but the funds could not be found, and the team folded over the winter of 1985. The team would have raced as car #9 for 1986 otherwise, per the FIA entry list.

<doc id="1246203" wikidata="Q242922" url="?curid=1246203" title="Dominican peso">
<text>The Dominican peso, officially the since 2010, is the currency of the Dominican Republic. Its symbol is &quot;$&quot;, with &quot;RD$&quot; used when distinction from other pesos (or dollars) is required; its ISO 4217 code is &quot;DOP&quot;. Each peso is divided into 100 &quot;centavos&quot; (&quot;cents&quot;), for which the ¢ symbol is used. With exception of the United States dollar, it is the only currency that is legal tender in the Dominican Republic for all monetary transactions, whether public or private.

Until the promulgation of the 2010 constitution, &quot;peso oro&quot; (English: Gold peso) was the official name of the currency of the Dominican Republic.

== History ==
The first Dominican peso was introduced with the country&#x27;s independence from Haiti in 1844. It replaced the Haitian gourde at par and was divided into 8 &quot;reales&quot;. The Dominican Republic decimalized in 1877, subdividing the peso into 100 centavos. A second currency, the &quot;franco&quot;, was issued between 1891 and 1897 but did not replace the peso. However, in 1905, the peso was replaced by the U.S. dollar, at a rate of 5 pesos to the dollar. The &quot;peso oro&quot; was introduced in 1937 at par with the U.S. dollar, although the dollar continued to be used alongside the peso oro until 1947.

== Coins ==

=== First peso, 1844–1905 ===
Only one denomination of coin was issued by the Dominican Republic before decimalization. This was the real, issued in 1844 in bronze and in both 1844 and 1848 in brass. Decimalization in 1877 brought about the introduction of three new coins, the 1, and 5 centavos. centavo coins were also issued between 1882 and 1888. In 1891 Dominican Republic entered in the Latin Monetary Union and changed its currency to the franco including coins of 5 and 10 centesimos struck in bronze and 50 centesimos, 1 and 5 francos struck in silver. After the franco was abandoned, silver coins were introduced in 1897 in denominations of 10 and 20 centavos, and 1 peso. The designs of these coins were very similar to those of the franco.

Older Coins
=== Peso Oro, from 1937 ===
Coins were introduced in 1937 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 centavos and pesos with limited numbers of 1 peso coins first minted in 1939. All coins bore the national arms on the reverse while all except the 1 centavo bore a crowned allegorical Indian head on the obverse. The 1 centavo instead depicted a palm tree, the symbol of the ruling Dominican Party. The coins were all of identical weights, diameter, and composition to U.S. coins of the era. Two denominations appeared on these coins, one in &quot;centavos&quot; or &quot;pesos&quot; and another in &quot;gramos&quot; to represent a pre-decimal silver weight system formerly used in much of the region. A two coin set of 1955 commemorative coins were minted for the 25th anniversary of Rafael Trujillo&#x27;s reign. These consisted of a gold 30 peso (33,000 minted) and a silver one peso, both showing him in profile. 50,000 of the silver one peso coins were produced in issued into circulation, but after Trujillo was assassinated in 1961 an estimated 32,550 were recalled and melted down. In 1963 the silver content in the 10, 25, 50, and 1 peso coins was reduced from 0.900 pure to 0.650 pure. The 1963 issue also distinctively commemorated the centennial of the republic and the crowned Indian head was added to the 1 centavo, replacing the palm.

After 1963 the Peso Oro became a fiat currency and base metals replaced silver in the higher denominations, with the 10, and 25 centavos and pesos reintroduced in copper-nickel in 1967. 1 peso coins were struck as only commemorative in small numbers. In 1976 a new coin series was introduced featuring Juan Pablo Duarte, and in 1983 another series was released featuring various other figures important to Dominican history, including the Mirabal sisters and formally dropping the outdated &quot;gramos&quot; denomination reference. In 1989, the content of the coins was changed from copper-nickel to nickel-plated steel. In 1991, eleven sided circulating non commemorative 1 peso coins were reintroduced in copper-zinc, followed by bimetal 5 pesos in 1997. For the latter coin the first year of issue was a circulating commemorative for the 50th anniversary of the national bank. Both a bimetal 10 pesos and a copper-nickel 25 pesos were introduced in 2005. Due to inflation, any coins below 1 peso are now rarely found.

== Banknotes ==
=== First peso, 1848–1905 ===
Paper money made up the bulk of circulating currency for the first peso. Provisional issues of 40 and 80 pesos were produced in 1848, followed by regular government notes for 1, 2 and 5 pesos in 1849, and 10 and 50 peso notes in 1858. The &quot;Comisión de Hacienda&quot; issued 50 and 200 pesos in 1865, whilst the &quot;Junta de Crédito&quot; introduced notes for 10 and 20 centavos that year, followed by 5 and 40 centavos in 1866 and 1, 2, 5 and 10 pesos in 1867. In 1862, the Spanish issued notes for , 2, 5, 15 and 25 pesos in the name of the &quot;Intendencia de Santo Domingo&quot;. The last government notes were 1 peso notes issued in 1870.

Two private banks issued paper money. The &quot;Banco Nacional de Santo Domingo&quot; issued notes between 1869 and 1889 in denominations of 25 and 50 centavos, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 100 pesos. The &quot;Banco de la Compañía de Crédito de Puerto Plata&quot; issued notes from the 1880s until 1899 in denominations of 25 and 50 centavos, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50 pesos. Note that the Banco Nacional de Santo Domingo also issued notes in 1912 denominated in dollars (called pesos in the Spanish text).

=== Peso Oro, 1947-2011 ===
When the peso oro was first introduced as a local coinage in 1937, no paper money was made and US notes continued to circulate as the U.S. dollar was officially the national currency. Only in 1947 were the first peso oro notes issued by the Central Bank in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 500, and 1000 oros, though the latter two denominations were rarely used. These notes were printed by the American Bank Note Company, a private printing and engraving firm. Though US notes were always acceptable in exchange, they were gradually withdrawn from circulation. In 1961, low value notes were issued in denominations of 10, 25 and 50 centavos to help compensate for the value of silver in coins surpassing face value and the resulting coin shortages. Following the demise of Trujillo all banknotes afterwards dropped references to the capital city Ciudad Trujillo which had reverted to its old name, Santo Domingo.

Banknotes currently in circulation are 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 pesos oros. The 10 and 20 peso denomination bills have been replaced with 10 and 25 peso coins respectively in 2005. In 2010, a new 20 pesos oro polymer banknote was released. Limited editions of the 500 and 2000 peso oro notes were issued for the 1992 500th anniversary of the discovery of the Americas and year 2000 millennial celebrations, respectively, but not many of these remain in circulation. A 5000 pesos note has been considered before but not made.

All current banknotes carry the phrase &quot;Este billete tiene fuerza libertoria para el pago de todas las obligaciónes públicas o privadas&quot;. Literally translated, ().

===2010===
On July 1, 2010, the Central Bank of Dominican Republic issued a 20-peso oro banknote that is similar to the previous paper issue, but is now printed on a polymer substrate.

===2011===
In 2011, the Central Bank of Dominican Republic announced that all banknotes dated 2011 and later will be denominated in &quot;Pesos Dominicanos&quot; instead of &quot;Pesos Oro&quot;. This decision was made in response to a mandate of the Constitution of the Dominican Republic of January 26, 2010.

===2014===
On October 1, 2014, the Central Bank of Dominican Republic planned to issue a new family of notes with new designs and new security features.

== Relation with the U.S. dollar ==
The United States dollar is used as a reserve currency by the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic. Also, when agreed by both parties, both U.S. dollars and the euro can be used in private transactions (this applies mostly in tourism-related activities). This was most true during the drastic inflationary period of 2003–2004. Nowadays the U.S. dollar is widely accepted and tourists visiting the Dominican Republic can use it as a second currency.

== Historical exchange rates ==
Historically, since the first monetary emission in 1948, the peso was at parity with the United States dollar.

The exchange rate for U.S. dollar vs. Dominican peso over the last few decades is as follows:
* 1984 to 
* 1993 to 
* 1998 to 
* 2002 to 
* 2003 to 
* 2004 to 
* 2006 to 
* 2007 to 
* 2008 to 
* 2009 to 
* 2012 to 
* 2013 to 
* 2016 to 

In 2004 the peso dramatically plummeted; a single US dollar was worth almost . In August 2020, mark was temporarily crossed again.

As of February 8, 2023, buys around 56.30 pesos.

As of April 5, 2024, US$1 buys around 59.24 pesos. In September 2024, the U.S. dollar surpassed the mark.

<text>The 2004 Major League Soccer season was the ninth season of Major League Soccer. It was also the 92nd season of FIFA-sanctioned soccer in the United States, and the 26th with a national first-division league.

After playing one season in the suburb of Southlake, the Dallas Burn returned to the Cotton Bowl.

D.C. United signed 14-year-old prodigy Freddy Adu, who made his debut as a substitute in their season opener becoming the youngest player in North American sports history. The Columbus Crew emerged as a dominant team in the second half of the regular season, running off an MLS-record 18-game unbeaten streak en route to winning the Supporters&#x27; Shield.

The regular season began on April 3, and concluded on October 17. The 2004 MLS Cup Playoffs began on October 22, and concluded with MLS Cup 2004 on November 14. D.C. United won their record 4th league title by defeating the Kansas City Wizards in MLS Cup.

==Overview==

===Season format===
The season began on April 3 and concluded with MLS Cup on November 14. The 10 teams were split evenly into two conferences. Each team played 30 games that were evenly divided between home and away. Each team played every other team in their conference, and two designated opponents from the opposite conference, four times, and the remaining teams in the opposite conference twice.

The top four teams from each conference qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs. In the first round, aggregate goals over two matches determined the winners. The conference finals were played as a single match, and the winners advanced to MLS Cup. In all rounds, draws were broken with two 15-minute periods of extra time, followed by penalty kicks if necessary. The away goals rule was not used in any round.

The team with the most points in the regular season was awarded the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield. Additionally, the winner of MLS Cup and the runner-up qualified for the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.

<doc id="1246225" wikidata="Q636771" url="?curid=1246225" title="Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire">
<text>The Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, also known as the Conquest of Peru, was one of the most important campaigns in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. After years of preliminary exploration and military skirmishes, 168 Spanish soldiers under conquistador Francisco Pizarro, along with his brothers in arms and their indigenous allies, captured the last Sapa Inca, Atahualpa, at the Battle of Cajamarca in 1532. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory in 1572 and colonization of the region as the Viceroyalty of Peru. The conquest of the Inca Empire (called &quot;Tahuantinsuyu&quot; or &quot;Tawantinsuyu&quot; in Quechua, meaning &quot;Realm of the Four Parts&quot;), led to spin-off campaigns into present-day Chile and Colombia, as well as expeditions to the Amazon Basin and surrounding rainforest.

When the Spanish arrived at the borders of the Inca Empire in 1528, it spanned a considerable area and was by far the largest of the four grand pre-Columbian civilizations. Extending southward from the Ancomayo, which is now known as the Patía River, in southern present-day Colombia to the Maule River in what would later be known as Chile, and eastward from the Pacific Ocean to the edge of the Amazonian jungles, it covered some of the most mountainous terrains on Earth. In less than a century, the Inca had expanded their empire from about in 1448 to in 1528, just before the arrival of the Spanish. This vast area of land varied greatly in culture and climate. Because of the diverse cultures and geography, the Inca allowed many areas of the empire to be governed under the control of local leaders, who were watched and monitored by Inca officials. Under the administrative mechanisms established by the Inca, all parts of the empire answered to, and were ultimately under the direct control of, the Inca Emperor. Scholars estimate that the population of the Inca Empire was between 12 and 16 million.

Some scholars, such as Jared Diamond, believe that while the Spanish conquest was undoubtedly the proximate cause of the collapse of the Inca Empire, it may very well have been past its peak and already in the process of decline. In 1528, Emperor Huayna Capac ruled the Inca Empire. He could trace his lineage back to a &quot;stranger king&quot; named Manco Cápac, the mythical founder of the Inca clan, who, according to tradition, emerged from a cave in a region called Paqariq Tampu.

Huayna Capac was the son of the previous ruler, Túpac Inca, and the grandson of Pachacuti, the Emperor who, by conquest, had commenced the dramatic expansion of the Inca Empire from its cultural and traditional base in the area around Cusco. On his accession to the throne, Huayna Capac had continued the policy of expansion by conquest, taking Inca armies north into what is today Ecuador. While he had to put down a number of rebellions during his reign, by the time of his death, his legitimacy was as unquestioned as was the primacy of Inca power.

Expansion had caused its own set of problems. Many parts of the empire retained distinct cultures, which were at best reluctant to become part of the greater imperial project. Due to its size, and the fact that all communication and travel had to take place by foot or by boat, the Inca Empire proved increasingly difficult to administer and govern, with the Inca Emperor having increasingly less influence over local areas.

Huayna Capac relied on his sons to support his reign. While he had many legitimate-born of his sister-wife, under the Inca system- and illegitimate children, two sons are historically important. Prince Túpac Cusi Hualpa, also known as Huáscar, was the son of Coya Mama Rahua Occllo of the royal line. The second was Atahualpa, an illegitimate son who was likely born of a daughter of the last independent King of Quitu, one of the states conquered by Huayna Capac during the expansion of the Inca Empire. These two sons would play pivotal roles in the final years of the Inca Empire.

The Spanish conquistador Pizarro and his men were greatly aided in their enterprise by invading when the Inca Empire was in the midst of a war of succession between the princes Huáscar and Atahualpa. Atahualpa seems to have spent more time with Huayna Capac during the years when he was in the north with the army conquering Ecuador. Atahualpa was thus closer to and had better relations with the army and its leading generals. When both Huayna Capac and his eldest son and designated heir, Ninan Cuyochic, died suddenly in 1528 from what was probably smallpox, a disease introduced by the Spanish into the Americas, the question of who would succeed as emperor was thrown open. Huayna had died before he could nominate the new heir.

At the time of Huayna Capac&#x27;s death, Huáscar was in the capital Cuzco, while Atahualpa was in Quito with the main body of the Inca army. Huáscar had himself proclaimed Sapa Inca (i.e. &quot;Only Emperor&quot;) in Cuzco, but the army declared loyalty to Atahualpa. The resulting dispute led to the Inca Civil War.


== Chronology of the last years of the Inca Empire ==

* c. 1528 – Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro make first contact with the Inca Empire at Tumbes, the northernmost Inca stronghold along the coast. The Inca Emperor Huayna Capac died from European-introduced smallpox. Death sets off a civil war between his sons: Atahualpa and Huáscar
* 1528–1529 – Pizarro returns to Spain where the Queen of Spain grants him the license to conquer Peru
* 1531–1532 – Pizarro&#x27;s third voyage to Peru. Spaniards form a bond with the Natives (Huancas, Chankas, Cañaris and Chachapoyas) who were under the oppression of the Inca Empire, and Pizarro includes them among his troops to face the Incas. Atahualpa is captured by Spanish.
* 1533 – Almagro arrives; Atahualpa is executed after he orders Huáscar to be killed; Pizarro submits Cuzco and installs seventeen-year-old Manco Inca as new Inca Emperor
* 1535 – Pizarro founds the city of Lima; De Almagro leaves for present-day Chile
* 1536 – Gonzalo Pizarro steals Manco Inca&#x27;s wife, Cura Olcollo. Manco rebels and surrounds Cuzco. Juan Pizarro is killed, and Inca general Quizo Yupanqui attacks Lima
* 1537 – Almagro seizes Cuzco from Hernando and Gonzalo Pizarro. Rodrigo Orgóñez sacks Vitcos and captures Manco Inca&#x27;s son, Titu Cusi. Manco escapes and flees to Vilcabamba, which became the capital of the Neo-Inca State
* 1538 – Hernando Pizarro executes Diego de Almagro
* 1539 – Gonzalo Pizarro invades and sacks Vilcabamba; Manco Inca escapes but Francisco Pizarro executes Manco&#x27;s wife, Cura Olcollo
* 1541 – Francisco Pizarro is murdered by Diego de Almagro II and other supporters of De Almagro
* 1544 – Manco Inca is murdered by supporters of Diego de Almagro. The Inca do not stop their revolt
* 1572 – Viceroy of Peru, Francisco Toledo, declares war on the Neo-Inca State; Vilcabamba is sacked and Túpac Amaru, the last Inca Emperor, is captured and executed in Cuzco. The Neo-Inca capital of Vilcabamba is abandoned; the Spanish remove inhabitants and relocate them to the newly established Christian town of San Francisco de la Victoria de Vilcabamba.

== Beginning of the conflict ==
The civil war between Atahualpa and Huascar weakened the empire immediately prior to its struggle with the Spanish. Historians are unsure if a united Inca Empire would have defeated the Spanish in the long term due to factors such as the high mortality from disease and the resulting social disruption, and the superior military technology of the conquistadors, who possessed horses, dogs, metal armor, swords, cannons, and primitive, but effective, firearms. Atahualpa appeared to be more popular with the people than his brother, and he was certainly more valued by the army, the core of which was based in the recently conquered northern province of Quito.

At the outset of the conflict, each brother controlled his respective domains, with Atahualpa secure in the north, and Huáscar controlling the capital of Cuzco and the large territory to the south, including the area around Lake Titicaca. This region had supplied large numbers of soldiers for Huáscar&#x27;s forces. After a period of diplomatic posturing and jockeying for position, open warfare broke out. Huáscar seemed poised to bring the war to a rapid and decisive conclusion, as troops loyal to him took Atahualpa prisoner, while he was attending a festival in the city of Tumebamba. However, Atahualpa quickly escaped and returned to Quito. There, he was able to amass what is estimated to be at least 30,000 well-trained soldiers. While Huáscar managed to muster about the same number of soldiers, they were much less experienced.

Atahualpa sent his forces south under the command of two of his leading generals, Challcuchima and Quisquis, who won an uninterrupted series of victories against Huáscar that soon brought them to the very gates of Cuzco. On the first day of the battle for Cuzco, the forces loyal to Huáscar gained an early advantage. However, on the second day, Huáscar personally led an ill-advised &quot;surprise&quot; attack, of which the generals Challcuchima and Quisquis had advanced knowledge. In the ensuing battle, Huáscar was captured, and resistance completely collapsed. The victorious generals sent word north by &quot;chasqui&quot; messenger to Atahualpa, who had moved south from Quito to the royal resort springs outside Cajamarca. The messenger arrived with news of the final victory on the same day that Pizarro and his small band of adventurers, together with some indigenous allies, descended from the Andes into the town of Cajamarca.

== Arrival of Pizarro ==

Francisco Pizarro and his brothers (Gonzalo, Juan, and Hernando) were attracted by the rumors of a rich and fabulous kingdom. They had left the then-impoverished Extremadura, like many migrants after them.

In 1529, Francisco Pizarro obtained permission from the Spanish Monarchy to conquer the land they called Peru.

According to historian Raúl Porras Barrenechea, Peru is not a Quechuan nor Caribbean word, but Indo-European or hybrid. Unknown to Pizarro, as he was lobbying for permission to mount an expedition, his proposed enemy was being devastated by the diseases brought to the American continents during earlier Spanish contacts.

When Pizarro arrived in Peru in 1532, he found it vastly different from when he had been there just five years before. Amid the ruins of the city of Tumbes, he tried to piece together the situation before him. From two local boys, whom Pizarro had taught how to speak Spanish in order to translate for him, Pizarro learned of the civil war and of the disease that was destroying the Inca Empire.

After four long expeditions, Pizarro established the first Spanish settlement in northern Peru, calling it San Miguel de Piura.
When first spotted by the natives, Pizarro and his men were thought to be &quot;Viracocha Cuna&quot; or &quot;gods&quot;. The Natives described Pizarro&#x27;s men to the Inca. They said that &quot;capito&quot; was tall with a full beard and was completely wrapped in clothing. The Natives described the men&#x27;s swords and how they killed sheep with them. The men did not eat human flesh, but rather sheep, lamb, duck, pigeons, and deer, and cooked the meat. Atahualpa was fearful of what the newly arrived white men were capable of. If they were &quot;runa quicachac&quot; or &quot;destroyers of peoples,&quot; then he should flee. If they were &quot;Viracocha Cuna Runa allichac&quot; or &quot;gods who are benefactors of the people,&quot; then he should not flee, but welcome them. The messengers went back to Tangarala, and Atahualpa sent Cinquinchara, an Orejon warrior, to the Spanish to serve as an interpreter.

After traveling with the Spanish, Cinquinchara returned to Atahualpa; they discussed whether or not the Spanish men were gods. Cinquinchara decided they were men because he saw them eat, drink, dress, and have relations with women. He saw them produce no miracles. Cinquinchara informed Atahualpa that they were small in number, about 170–180 men, and had bound the Native captives with &quot;iron ropes&quot;. When Atahualpa asked what to do about the strangers, Cinquinchara advised that they be killed because they were evil thieves who would take whatever they wanted, and were &quot;supai cuna&quot; or &quot;devils&quot;. He recommended trapping the men inside of their sleeping quarters and burning them to death.

== Capture of Atahualpa ==
After his victory and the capture of his brother Huáscar, Atahualpa was fasting in the Inca baths outside Cajamarca. Pizarro and his men reached the city on 15 November 1532.

Pizarro sent Hernando de Soto to the Atahualpa&#x27;s camp. De Soto rode to meet Atahualpa on his horse, an animal that Atahualpa had never seen before. With one of his young interpreters, Soto read a prepared speech to Atahualpa telling him that they had come as servants of God to teach them the truth about God&#x27;s word. He said he was speaking to them so that they might:
&quot;lay the foundation of concord, brotherhood, and perpetual peace that should exist between us, so that you may receive us under your protection and hear the divine law from us and all your people may learn and receive it, for it will be the greatest honor, advantage, and salvation to them all.&quot; Additionally, they invited the Inca leader to visit Pizarro at his quarters along the Cajamarca plaza. When De Soto noticed Atahualpa&#x27;s interest in his horse, he put on a display of &quot;excellent horsemanship&quot; in close proximity. Atahualpa displayed hospitality by serving refreshments.

Atahualpa responded only after Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s brother, Hernando Pizarro, arrived. He replied with what he had heard from his scouts, that the Spanish had been killing and enslaving countless numbers of people and civilians on the coast. Pizarro denied the report and Atahualpa, with limited information, reluctantly let the matter go. At the end of their meeting, the men agreed to meet the next day at Cajamarca.
The next morning, on 16 November 1532, Pizarro had arranged an ambuscade around the Cajamarca plaza, where they were to meet. At this point, Pizarro had in total 168 men under his command: 106 on foot and 62 on horseback. When Atahualpa arrived with about 6,000 unarmed followers, Friar Vincente de Valverde and the interpreter Felipillo met them and proceeded to &quot;expound the doctrines of the true faith&quot; &quot;(requerimiento)&quot; and seek his tribute as a vassal of King Charles. The unskilled translator likely contributed to problems in communication. The friar offered Atahualpa the Bible as the authority of what he had just stated. Atahualpa stated, &quot;I will be no man&#x27;s tributary.&quot;

Pizarro urged attack, starting the Battle of Cajamarca. The battle began with a shot from a cannon and the battle cry &quot;Santiago!&quot; The Spaniards unleashed volleys of gunfire at the vulnerable mass of Incas and surged forward in a concerted action. Pizarro also used devastating cavalry charges against the Inca forces, which stunned them in combination with the supporting gunfire. However, many of the guns used by the Spaniards were hard to use in close-quarters combat. The effect was devastating, and the shocked Incas offered such feeble resistance that the battle has often been labeled a massacre, with the 2,000 Incas slain and the Spanish with only one soldier wounded.

Though the historical accounts relating to the circumstances vary, the true Spanish motives for the attack seemed to be a desire for loot and flat-out impatience. The Inca likely did not adequately understand the conquistadors&#x27; demands. Pizarro knew that his forces were badly outnumbered but that capturing the Emperor and holding him hostage would give him a key edge.

The majority of Atahualpa&#x27;s troops were in the Cuzco region along with Quisquis and Challcuchima, the two generals he trusted the most. This was a major disadvantage for the Inca. Their undoing also resulted from a lack of self-confidence, and a desire to make public demonstration of fearlessness and godlike command of situation. The main view is that the Inca were eventually defeated due to inferior weapons, &#x27;open battle&#x27; tactics, disease, internal unrest, the bold tactics of the Spanish, and the capture of the Inca&#x27;s Emperor. Spanish armor was very effective against most of the Andean weapons, though it was not entirely impenetrable to maces, clubs, or slings. Later, most natives adapted in &#x27;guerrilla fashion&#x27; by only shooting at the legs of the conquistadors if they happened to be unarmored. However, ensuing hostilities such as the Mixtón Rebellion, Chichimeca War, and Arauco War would require that the conquistadors ally with friendly tribes in these later expeditions.

By February 1533, Almagro had joined Pizarro in Cajamarca with an additional 150 men with 50 horses.

After the Spanish captured Atahualpa at the massacre at Cajamarca, they allowed his wives to join him, and the Spanish soldiers taught him the game of chess. During Atahualpa&#x27;s captivity, the Spanish, although greatly outnumbered, forced him to order his generals to back down by threatening to kill him if he did not. According to the Spanish envoy&#x27;s demands, Atahualpa offered to fill a large room with gold and promised twice that amount in silver. While Pizarro ostensibly accepted this offer and allowed the gold to pile up, he had no intention of releasing the Inca. He needed Atahualpa&#x27;s influence over his generals and the people in order to maintain the peace. The treasure began to be delivered from Cuzco on 20 December 1532 and flowed steadily from then on. By 3 May 1533 Pizarro received all the treasure he had requested; it was melted, refined, and made into bars. Hernando Pizarro went to gather gold and silver from the temples in Pachacamac in January 1533, and on his return in March, captured Chalcuchimac in the Jauja Valley. Francisco Pizzaro sent a similar expedition to Cuzco, bringing back many gold plates from the Temple of the Sun.
The question eventually came up of what to do with Atahualpa; both Pizarro and Soto reportedly spoke against killing him, but the other Spaniards were loud in their demands for death. False interpretations from the interpreter Felipillo made the Spaniards paranoid. They were told that Atahualpa had ordered secret attacks and his warriors were hidden in the surrounding area. Soto went with a small force to scout for the hidden army, and the show trial of Atahualpa was held in his absence. Among the charges were polygamy, incestuous marriage, and idolatry, all frowned upon in Catholicism but common in Inca culture and religion.

The men who were against Atahualpa&#x27;s conviction and murder argued that he should be judged by King Charles since he was the sovereign prince. Atahualpa was forced to submit to baptism to avoid being burned at the stake and in the hopes of one day rejoining his army and killing the Spanish; they referred to him as Francisco for the purposes of the ritual. On 29 August 1533 the Spanish captors murdered Atahualpa by garrotting. He was buried with Christian rites in the church of San Francisco at Cajamarca, but was soon disinterred. His body was recovered, probably at his prior request, and borne to its final resting place in Quito. Upon de Soto&#x27;s return, he was furious; he had found no evidence of any secret gathering of Atahualpa&#x27;s warriors.

Pizarro advanced with his army of 500 Spaniards toward Cuzco, accompanied by Chalcuchimac. The latter was burned alive in the Jauja Valley, accused of secret communication with Quizquiz, and organizing resistance. Manco Inca Yupanqui joined Pizarro after the death of Túpac Huallpa. Pizarro&#x27;s force entered the heart of the Tawantinsuyu on 15 November 1533.

Benalcázar, Pizarro&#x27;s lieutenant and fellow Extremaduran, had already departed from San Miguel with 140 foot soldiers and a few horses on his conquering mission to Ecuador. At the foot of Mount Chimborazo, near the modern city of Riobamba (Ecuador) he met and defeated the forces of the great Inca warrior Rumiñawi with the aid of Cañari tribesmen who served as guides and allies to the conquering Spaniards. Rumiñahui fell back to Quito, and, while in pursuit of the Inca army, Benalcázar was joined by five hundred men led by Guatemalan Governor Pedro de Alvarado. Greedy for gold, Alvarado had set sail for the south without the crown&#x27;s authorization, landed on the Ecuadorian coast, and marched inland to the Sierra. Finding Quito empty of its people&#x27;s treasure, Alvarado soon joined the combined Spanish force. Alvarado agreed to sell his fleet of twelve ships, his forces, plus arms and ammunition, and returned to Guatemala.

==Rebellion and reconquest==
After Atahualpa&#x27;s murder, Pizarro installed Atahualpa&#x27;s brother, Túpac Huallpa, as a puppet Inca ruler, but he soon died unexpectedly, leaving Manco Inca Yupanqui in power. He began his rule as an ally of the Spanish and was respected in the southern regions of the empire, but there was still much unrest in the north near Quito where Atahualpa&#x27;s generals were amassing troops. Atahualpa&#x27;s murder meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders. Led by Atahualpa&#x27;s generals Rumiñahui, Zope-Zupahua and Quisquis, the native armies were finally defeated, effectively ending any organized rebellion in the north of the empire.

Manco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors. However, in 1535 he was left in Cuzco under the control of Pizarro&#x27;s brothers, Juan and Gonzalo, who so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately rebelled. Under the pretense of recovering a statue of pure gold in the nearby Yucay valley, Manco was able to escape Cuzco.
Manco Inca hoped to use the disagreement between Almagro and Pizarro to his advantage and attempted the recapture of Cuzco starting in April 1536. The siege of Cuzco was waged until the following spring, and during that time Manco&#x27;s armies managed to wipe out four relief columns sent from Lima, but was ultimately unsuccessful in its goal of routing the Spaniards from the city. The Inca leadership did not have the full support of all its subject peoples and furthermore, the degrading state of Inca morale coupled with the superior Spanish siege weapons soon made Manco Inca realize his hope of recapturing Cuzco was failing. Manco Inca eventually withdrew to Tambo.

Archaeological evidence of the rebellion incident exists, showing that the Spanish conquistadors were aided by native Indian allies. The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007. Forensic evidence suggests that European weapons killed some of the natives, probably during the uprising in 1536, but that the vast majority had been killed by local, indigenous weapons.

After the Spanish re-occupied Cuzco, Manco Inca and his armies retreated to the fortress at Ollantaytambo where he, for a time, successfully launched attacks against Pizarro based at Cuzco and even managed to defeat the Spanish occupiers in an open battle.

When it became clear that defeat was imminent, Manco Inca retreated further to the mountainous region of Vilcabamba and established the small Neo-Inca State, where Manco Inca and his successors continued to hold some power for several more decades. His son, Túpac Amaru, was the last Inca, being killed by the Spanish in 1572.

In total, the conquest took about forty years to complete. Many Inca attempts to regain their empire had occurred, but none had been successful. Thus the Spanish conquest was achieved, aided by factors like smallpox and a great communication and cultural divide. The Spaniards destroyed much of the Inca culture and imposed Spanish culture onto the native population.
==Aftermath==

A struggle for power resulted in a long civil war between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro in which Almagro was killed. Almagro&#x27;s loyal followers and his descendants later avenged his death by killing Pizarro in 1541. This was done inside the palace of Francisco Pizarro in a fight to the death by these assassins, most of which were former soldiers of Diego de Almagro who were stripped of title and belongings after his death.

Despite the war, the Spaniards did not neglect the colonizing process. Spanish royal authority on these territories was consolidated by the creation of an Audiencia Real, a type of appellate court. In January 1535, Lima was founded, from which the political and administrative institutions were to be organized. In 1542, the Spanish created the Viceroyalty of New Castile, that shortly after would be called Viceroyalty of Peru. Nevertheless, the Viceroyalty of Peru was not organized until the arrival of a later Viceroy, Francisco de Toledo, in 1569. Toledo ended the indigenous Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba, executing the Inca Túpac Amaru. He resettled the indigenous people in Spanish-style settlements in a process called reductions, promoted economic development using commercial monopoly and increased the production of the silver mines of Potosí, using an Inca institution of forced labor for mandatory public service called &quot;mita&quot;.

The integration of Spanish culture into Peru was carried out not only by Pizarro and his other captains, but also by the many Spanish who also came to Peru to exploit its riches and inhabit its land. These included many different kinds of immigrants such as Spanish merchants, peasants, artisans, and Spanish women. Another element that the Spanish brought with them were African slaves to work alongside captive Incas for use in labor with things such as agriculture and mining for silver. These people all brought with them their own pieces of Spanish culture to integrate into Peruvian society.

===Effects of the conquest on the people of Peru===
The long-term effects of the arrival of the Spanish on the population of South America were catastrophic. While this was the case for every group of Native-Americans invaded by Europeans during this time period, the Inca population suffered an exceptionally dramatic and rapid decline following contact. The population decline for the Inca Empire from 1520 to 1571 is roughly estimated at from 10 to 15 million in 1520 to less than 3 million in 1570 with the population still declining after 1570.

The single greatest cause of the decimation of native populations was Old World infectious diseases, carried by colonists and conquistadors. As these were new to the natives, they had no acquired immunity and suffered very high rates of death. More died of disease than any army or armed conflict. As the Inca did not have as strong a writing tradition as the Aztec or Maya, it is difficult for historians to estimate population decline or any events after conquest. But, it is sometimes argued, and equally disputed among scholars that the Inca began to contract these diseases several years before the Spanish appeared in the region, as it was possibly carried to their empire by traders and travelers. The outbreak, argued to be hemorrhagic smallpox, reached the Andes in 1524. While numbers are unavailable, Spanish records indicate that the population was so devastated by disease that they could hardly resist the foreign forces.

Historians differ as to whether the illness of the 1520s was smallpox; a minority of scholars claim that the epidemic was due to an indigenous illness called Carrion&#x27;s disease. In any case, a 1981 study by N. D. Cook the shows that the Andes suffered from three separate population declines during colonization. The first was of 30–50 percent during the first outbreak of smallpox. When a measles outbreak occurred, there was another decline of 25–30 percent. Finally, when smallpox and measles epidemics occurred together, which occurred from 1585 to 1591, a decline of 30–60 percent occurred. Collectively these declines amounted to a decline of 93 percent from the pre-contact population in the Andes region. Mortality was particularly high among children, ensuring that the impact of the epidemics would extend to the next generation.

Beyond the devastation of the local populations by disease, they suffered considerable enslavement, pillaging and destruction from warfare. The Spanish took thousands of women from the local natives to use as servants and concubines. As Pizarro and his men took over portions of South America, they plundered and enslaved countless people. Some local populations entered into vassalage willingly, to defeat the Inca. Native groups such as the Huanca, Cañari, Chanka, and Chachapoya fought alongside the Spanish as they opposed Inca rule. The basic policy of the Spanish towards local populations was that voluntary vassalage would yield safety and coexistence, while continued resistance would result in more deaths and destruction.

Another significant effect on the people in South America was the spread of Christianity. As Pizarro and the Spanish subdued the continent and brought it under their control, they forcefully converted many to Christianity, claiming to have educated them in the ways of the &quot;one true religion.&quot; With the depopulation of the local populations along with the capitulation of the Inca Empire, the Spanish missionary work after colonization began was able to continue unimpeded. It took just a generation for the entire continent to be under Christian influence.

===Environmental impact===
The arrival of the Spanish also had an unexpected impact on the land itself. Recent research points out that the Spanish conquest altered Peru&#x27;s shoreline. Before the Spaniards arrived, inhabitants of the arid northern Peruvian coast clad massive sandy ridges with an accidental form of &quot;armor&quot;, millions of discarded mollusk shells, which protected the ridges from erosion for nearly 4700 years prior to the Spanish arrival, and produced a vast corrugated landscape that is visible from space. This incidental landscape protection came to a swift end, however, after diseases brought by Spanish colonists decimated the local population and after colonial officials resettled the survivors inland, without humans to create the protective covering, newly formed beach ridges simply eroded and vanished. According to archaeologist Torben Rick, parts of the northern coast of Peru may look completely natural and pristine, &quot;but if you rewind the clock a couple of millennia, you see that people were actively shaping this land by creating beach ridge systems&quot;.

==In fiction==

Marmontel&#x27;s novel &quot;Les Incas, ou la destruction de l&#x27;empire du Perou&quot; (1777), inspired by Bartolomé de Las Casas&#x27;s &quot;Account&quot;, tells a fictitious version of the conquest of Peru to portray the author&#x27;s views on the religious fanaticism of the Conquistadors and their cruelty to the natives.

An opera of Verdi, &quot;Alzira&quot; (1845), is set during the Conquest. In the play, an Inca called Zamoro wants to find the princess Alzira, who has been engaged to the Conquistador Gusmano.

The second act of Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Les Indes galantes&quot; (1735) is called &quot;Les incas du Pérou&quot; and tells the love story of a Spanish Conquistador and an Inca princess.

The Spanish Comedy &quot;La aurora en Copacabana&quot;, written by Pedro Calderón de la Barca, dramatizes the Conquest under a religious perspective, adding allegorical characters that represents the Idolatry and the Christian conversion of the Native Peruvians.

The first part of Madame de Graffigny&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;Lettres d&#x27;une Péruvienne&quot; narrates the abduction of Zilia, an Inca princess, by the Spaniards during the Conquest.

Peter Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; (1964) dramatizes the conquest of the Incas. In the play, Pizarro, Atahualpa, Valverde and other historical figures appear as characters.

This event is also narrated as a Science Fiction novelette in Randall Garrett&#x27;s &quot;Despoilers of the Golden Empire&quot; (1959).

The Ransom Room is the setting of the romance &quot;Das Gold von Caxamalca&quot; (1928) by German novelist Jakob Wasserman.

The conquest is also used as a starting point for the Matthew Reilly novel &quot;Temple&quot;, where the siege of Cusco is used. Many historical figures are mentioned, especially Pizarro who is mentioned as the pursuer of the protagonist.

The Inca are featured in the third Campaign in &quot;Age of Empires 3&quot;, having a Lost City hidden in the Andes. They are also in the Multiplayer, found primarily in the areas making up Chile and Argentina. In the Definitive Edition of the game they are a playable faction.

The conquest is parodied in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; TV series, in the episode &quot;Lost Verizon&quot;, written by John Frink.

Pizarro and his fellow conquistadors feature as antagonists in the 1982 animated serial &quot;The Mysterious Cities of Gold&quot;.

<doc id="1246227" wikidata="Q1785366" url="?curid=1246227" title="Security theater">
<text>Security theater is the practice of implementing security measures that are considered to provide the feeling of improved security while doing little or nothing to achieve it.

The term was originally coined by Bruce Schneier for his book &quot;Beyond Fear&quot; and has since been widely adopted by the media and the public, particularly in discussions surrounding the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

Practices criticized as security theater include airport security measures, stop and frisk policies on public transportation, and clear bag policies at sports venues.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;security theater&quot; was coined by computer security specialist and writer Bruce Schneier for his book &quot;Beyond Fear&quot;, but has gained currency in security circles, particularly for describing airport security measures.

Examples of use of the term:

== Examples ==
Some measures which have been called security theater include:

===Airport security measures===
Many procedures of the TSA have been criticized as security theater. Specific measures critiqued as security theater include the &quot;patting down the crotches of children, the elderly and even infants as part of the post-9/11 airport security show&quot; and the use of full body scanners, which &quot;are ineffective and can be easily manipulated.&quot; Many measures are put in place in reaction to past threats and &quot;are ineffective at actually stopping terrorism, as potential attackers can simply change tactics.&quot;

The use of Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) and its successor, Secure Flight – programs which rely on static screening of airline passenger profiles to choose which people should be searched – has been criticized as ineffective security theater. The TSA&#x27;s Registered Traveler Program and Trusted Traveler Program have been criticized on similar grounds. CAPPS has been demonstrated to reduce the effectiveness of searching below that of random searches, since terrorists can test the system and use those who are searched least often for their operations.

A 2010 United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the TSA&#x27;s $900million Screening Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program, a behavioral-detection program introduced in 2007 that is aimed at detecting terrorists, had detected no terrorists and failed to detect at least 16 people who had traveled through airports where the program was in use and were later involved in terrorism cases. In 2013, a GAO report found that no evidence existed to support the idea that &quot;behavioral indicators[...] can be used to identify persons who may pose a risk to aviation security.&quot; A separate 2013 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General found that the TSA had failed to evaluate the SPOT program and could not &quot;show that the program is cost effective.&quot; The SPOT program has been described as security theater.

With the aim of preventing individuals on a No Fly List from flying in commercial airliners, U.S. airports require all passengers to show valid picture ID (e.g. a passport or driver&#x27;s license) along with their boarding pass before entering the boarding terminal. At this checkpoint, the name on the ID is matched to that on the boarding pass, but is not recorded. In order to be effective, this practice must assume that 1) the ticket was bought under the passenger&#x27;s real name (at which point the name was recorded and checked against the No Fly List), 2) the boarding pass shown is real, and 3) the ID shown is real. However, the rise of print-at-home boarding passes, which can be easily forged, allows a potential attacker to buy a ticket under someone else&#x27;s name, to go into the boarding terminal using a real ID and a fake boarding pass, and then to fly on the ticket that has someone else&#x27;s name on it. Additionally, a 2007 investigation showed that obviously false IDs could be used when claiming a boarding pass and entering the departures terminal, so a person on the No Fly List can simply travel under a different name.

Facial recognition technology was introduced at Manchester Airport in August 2008. A journalist for &quot;The Register&quot; claimed that &quot;the gates in Manchester were throwing up so many false results that staff effectively turned them off.&quot; Previously matches had to be 80% the same to their passport pictures to go through, and this was quickly changed to 30%. According to Rob Jenkins, a facial recognition expert at Glasgow University, when testing similar machines at a 30% recognition level, the machines were unable to distinguish between the faces of Osama bin Laden and Winona Ryder, bin Laden and Kevin Spacey, nor between Gordon Brown and Mel Gibson.

===Random search programs on public transit and sports venues===
Random bag searches on subway systems – a practice that has been used on the Washington Metro and on New York City mass transit – have been condemned as ineffective security theater and a waste of resources. Such programs have also been criticized by members of the public and civil liberties groups. After eighteen months of random bag checks by the Metro Transit Police from December 2010, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported that the program, which was funded by a federal homeland security grant, had yielded zero arrests.

Similarly, the Chicago Transit Authority police&#x27;s deployment of random explosive-residue-swabbing checkpoints at public transit stations has been criticized as an ineffective means of security. Pat-downs of fans entering arenas for National Football League and metal detectors at Major League Baseball games have also been criticized as security theater. Additionally, the effectiveness of Clear and Large Bag policies at many major sports venues in the United States has been questioned repeatedly.

===Other===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, some measures such as surface sanitation and temperature checks at airports have been criticized as being security theater or &quot;hygiene theater&quot;.

Credit card signatures have been a longstanding subject of scrutiny and generally referred to as theatrical measure, as they have been notably criticized for having no true effect on deterring or stopping credit card fraud.

== Benefits ==
Despite criticism of security theater being ineffective at stopping terrorism and crime, it may be beneficial in a localized situation, as the perception of security is sometimes more important than security itself. If the potential victims of an attack feel more protected and safer as a result of the measures, then they may carry on activities they would have otherwise avoided, which could lead to economic benefits.

== Disadvantages ==
By definition, security theater practices provide no measurable security benefits, or minimal benefits that do not outweigh the cost of such practices. Security theater typically involves restricting or modifying aspects of people&#x27;s behavior or surroundings in very visible and highly specific ways, which could involve potential restrictions of personal liberty and privacy, ranging from mild inconveniences such as confiscating liquids over a limited amount, to sensitive issues, such as a full body strip search.

Critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have argued that the benefits of security theater are temporary and illusory since after such security measures inevitably fail, not only is the feeling of insecurity increased, but there is also loss of belief in the competence of those responsible for security.

Organizations such as the US TSA, who have implemented security theater practices, have been found to be highly ineffective, with one 2015 investigation resulting in TSA agents failing to prevent illegal items in 95% of trials. A follow up study in 2017 found similar results, though the TSA did not release an exact rate of success or failure.

Researchers such as Edward Felten have described the airport security repercussions due to the September 11, 2001 attacks as security theater.

=== Increased casualties ===
In 2007, researchers at Cornell University studied the specific effects of a change to security practices instituted by the TSA in late 2002. They concluded that this change reduced the number of air travelers by 6%, and estimated that consequently, 129 more people died in car accidents in the fourth quarter of 2002. Extrapolating this rate of fatalities, &quot;New York Times&quot; contributor Nate Silver remarked that this is equivalent to &quot;four fully loaded Boeing 737s crashing each year.&quot;

=== Economic costs ===
The 2007 Cornell University study also noted that strict airport security hurts the airline industry; it was estimated that the 6% reduction in the number of passengers in the fourth quarter of 2002 cost the industry $1.1billion in lost business.

The ACLU has reported that between October 2008 and June 2010, over 6,500 people traveling to and from the United States had their electronic devices searched at the border. The Association of Corporate Travel Executives (ACTE), whose member companies are responsible for over one million travelers and represent over $300billion in annual business travel expenditures, reported in February 2008 that 7% of their members had been subject to the seizure of a laptop or other electronic device. Electronic device seizure may have a severe economic and behavioral impact. Entrepreneurs for whom their laptop represents a mobile office can be deprived of their entire business. Fifty percent of the respondents to ACTE&#x27;s survey indicated that having a laptop seizure could damage a traveler&#x27;s professional standing within a company.

The executive director of the ACTE testified at a 2008 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution seizure of data or computers carrying business proprietary information has forced and will force companies to implement new and expensive internal travel policies.

=== Increased risk of targeted attacks ===
The direct costs of security theater may be lower than that of more elaborate security measures. However, it may divert portions of the budget for effective security measures without resulting in an adequate, measurable gain in security.

Because security theater measures are often so specific (such as concentrating on potential explosives in shoes), it allows potential attackers to divert to other methods of attack. This not only applies to the extremely specific measures, but can also involve possible tactics such as switching from using highly scrutinized airline passengers as attackers to getting attackers employed as airline or airport staff. Another alternate tactic would be simply avoiding attacking aircraft in favor of attacking other areas where sufficient damage would be done, such as check-in counters (as was done, for example, in the attacks on Brussels airport on 22 March 2016), or simply targeting other places where people gather in large numbers, such as cinemas.

=== Discriminatory practices ===
An additional disadvantage of security theater is the potential for biases to lead to negative outcomes and unequal treatment for certain groups. Airport racial profiling in the United States is an issue that largely began in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States, and persists today.

Documents uncovered by the ACLU found that until late 2012, the US TSA maintained training manuals that exclusively focused on examples of Arab or Muslim terrorists. In 2022, the US GAO found that advanced imaging technologies by the TSA disproportionately selected passengers of minority groups for additional screening, and a follow up report in 2023 found the same issue.

The ACLU also filed a 2015 lawsuit against the TSA&#x27;s SPOT program, and was successful in obtaining thousands of pages of documents regarding the program. The ACLU dropped their lawsuit against the TSA in 2017, but a report published by the organization, as well as reports published by the US GAO and a scientific advisory group found that the SPOT program had no scientific basis for effectiveness.

<text>Ulpius Marcellus (fl. 211–212) was formerly thought to be the latest-recorded governor of Britannia, before it was divided into separate provinces. He was supposed to be the son of Ulpius Marcellus, governor of Britannia during the reign of Commodus. Older sources, such as &quot;Roman Britain&quot;, by Peter Salway, still list him as a separate person, whilst later authorities now list Lucius Alfenus Senecio as the last known governor.

The theory that there was a second Ulpius Marcellus was based on two inscriptions at the fort at Cilurnum, which mention this name in connection with the second ala of Asturians. The arrival of the Asturians was previously thought to date to the early 3rd century. Their arrival is now placed in the later 2nd century, and the inscription is therefore believed to refer to the earlier governor.

<text>Lance J. Williams (September 25, 1949 – August 20, 2017) was a prominent graphics researcher who made major contributions to texture map prefiltering, shadow rendering algorithms, facial animation, and antialiasing techniques. Williams was one of the first people to recognize the potential of computer graphics to transform film and video making.

Williams died at 67 years old on August 20, 2017, after a battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife and two children.

==Education==
Williams was an Honors student majoring in English with a minor in Asian Studies at the University of Kansas and graduated with a B.A. in 1972. While a student at KU he competed in collegiate chess tournaments and is said to have had a rating of 1800. He was drawn to the University of Utah by a &quot;Humanistic Computation&quot; summer seminar held by Jef Raskin at KU. He joined the graduate Computer Science program at the University of Utah in 1973 and studied computer graphics and animation under Ivan Sutherland, David Evans, and Steven Coons. At this time in the early 1970s, the University of Utah was the hub for much of the pioneering work being done in computer graphics. Lance left Utah (having completed his PhD course work and exams except the writing of a thesis) in 1977 to join the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT). While at NYIT, Williams invented the mipmapping technique for texture filtering, which is ubiquitously used today by graphics hardware for PCs and video games, and wrote and directed the abandoned project &quot;The Works&quot; which would have been the first entirely 3D CGI film had it been finished in the early 1980s as intended.

Williams was awarded his PhD in 2000 from the University of Utah based on a rule allowing someone who published three seminal papers in his field to bind them together as his thesis. The three papers are &quot;Casting Curved Shadows on Curved Surfaces&quot; (1978), &quot;Pyramidal Parametrics&quot; (1983) and &quot;View Interpolation for Image Synthesis&quot; (1993).

==Professional career==
Williams worked at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) from 1976-1986 on research and commercial animation, and the development of shadow mapping and &quot;mip&quot; texture mapping. Subsequently Williams consulted for Jim Henson Associates, independently developed facial tracking for computer animation, worked for six years in Apple Computer&#x27;s Advanced Technology Group starting in 1987. While there he collaborated with Eric Chen to pioneer early image based rendering work, developed &quot;Virtual Integral Holography,&quot; (with Dan Venolia), created 3D paint systems and contributed to QuickTime VR. He has pioneered work in motion capture facial animation systems for over 20 years. In 1997, Williams joined DreamWorks SKG. In 2002 he became Chief Scientist at Walt Disney Animation Studios. In 2006, Williams joined Google and worked with the Google Geo Group (Maps and Earth). In 2008 he was a Principal Member of Research Staff at Nokia and as of 2012, he joined NVIDIA Research.

<text>Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois (; 1 October 1748 in Ville-sous-la-Ferté, Aube – 5 November 1839) was a French general during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. He is best known for the surrender of Malta to the British in 1800. On 20 August 1808 he was created Comte de Belgrand de Vaubois. Later, his name was inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe (Arche Kléber) in Paris.

==Early life==
Vaubois was born at Clairvaux (now part of Ville-sous-la-Ferté, Aube). In 1765 he was appointed a lieutenant of artillery in the Regiment of Metz. In 1789 he was appointed a Captain Commandant of Artillery. In 1791 he became a lieutenant colonel of volunteers. During service with the Army of the Alps, he was promoted to general of brigade in September 1793 and to general of division in 1796. After transferring to General Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s Army of Italy, he led his troops in the capture of Livorno. Appointed to command a division in the Bassano campaign, he participated in the victory at the Battle of Rovereto on 4 September.

During the Arcola campaign, Vaubois defended Trento with a 10,500-man division. Paul Davidovich&#x27;s Austrian corps proved to be unexpectedly strong and fell upon Vaubois with 18,000 men. In a series of skirmishes, Vaubois was driven out of Trento and pushed back to Calliano where his command was defeated on 7 November. Bonaparte arrived to stabilize the situation but the French army commander left Vaubois to do the best he could while Bonaparte attacked the main Austrian army at Arcole. The French won the three-day battle of Arcole on 17 November, the same day that Davidovich beat Vaubois again at Rivoli Veronese. The defeat had little consequence, since Bonaparte soon massed against Davidovich and sent his corps fleeing northward. Soon after, Bonaparte gave Vaubois&#x27; division to Barthélemy Joubert.

On 24 November 1796, Bonaparte wrote of him, &quot;Vaubois is a brave man. Has the proper qualifications for the commander of a besieged place but not for the commander of a division in a very active army or in a war so vigorously conducted as this.&quot; The events of 1798-1800 were to prove he was certainly the right choice to command a besieged place.

== Belgrand de Vaubois in Malta ==
Today he is most often remembered in Malta, where Napoleon appointed him &quot;Commandant en chef des Isles de Malte et du Goze&quot;) on 19 June 1798, just seven days after the Knights Hospitaller, rulers of this archipelago from 1530, signed a surrender on board &quot;L&#x27;Orient&quot;, Napoleon&#x27;s flagship. Napoleon and his expedition then set sail for Egypt, with the Knight&#x27;s treasure, worth five million francs in gold and one million in silver plate, on board the flagship. (Nelson&#x27;s fleet destroyed &quot;L&#x27;Orient&quot; on 1 August at Abū Qīr Bay in the Battle of the Nile; the Knights&#x27; treasures are still on the bottom of sea there.)

Napoleon left behind a garrison of 3,053 men, 5 companies of artillery and a medical unit in Malta and Gozo. The French proceeded to institute a number of policies. They declared the French language to be the official language. Although the French initially tried to win the support of the Catholic Church, they soon came into conflict with the Maltese Church as they instituted French revolutionary reforms. They abolished papal jurisdiction, authorized civil marriage, expelled all priests, regular clergy and nuns who were not native of Malta, and plundered the churches of gold and silver artifacts and paintings. The plundering of their churches outraged the staunchly pious Maltese. Furthermore, French draining of most of the cash of the &quot;Monte di Pietà&quot; and the &quot;Massa frumentaria&quot; precipitated an unprecedented financial crisis. On 2 September 1798 the Maltese rose against the French garrison in Notabile (Città Vecchia or Mdina). Soon both Malta and Gozo were in full rebellion, with the Maltese forming a National Assembly. They dispatched to a petition to Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, their official Suzerain, in Naples, to help them in their struggle against the French occupiers. Though Ferdinand promised much, he did little, having enough of his own troubles to worry much about his loyal Maltese subjects.

=== Insurrection and the arrival of the British ===

Still, on 18 September, a Portuguese squadron of four ships began a blockade of Malta. That blockade - although varying in the number and national composition of the ships - continued until the French surrendered. Nelson dispatched British forces under the command of Captain Alexander Ball, who arrived on 12 October 1798. The Maltese insurrectionist forces forced the French to withdraw to Valletta and the Three Cities around the Grand Harbour. On 28 October Gozo Island fell as the French commander there surrendered himself and his 217 men to Captain Ball. With General Vaubois&#x27;s forces besieged in Valletta, Captain Ball&#x27;s ships continued the blockade. Expecting the imminent French capitulation, Nelson wrote to Ball in January 1799:

... Respecting the situation of Malta with the King of Naples, it is this – he is the legitimate Sovereign of the Island: therefore, I am of opinion his Flag should fly. At the same time, a Neapolitan garrison would betray it to the first man who would bribe him. I am sure the King would have no difficulty in giving his Sovereignty to England; and I have lately, with Sir William Hamilton, got a Note that Malta should never be given to any Power without the consent of England ...P.S. – In case of the Surrender of Malta, I beg you will not do anything which can hurt the feelings of their Majesties. Unite their Flag with England&#x27;s, if it cannot, from the disposition of the Islanders, fly alone.

=== The siege of Valletta ===

In February 1799, the Maltese insurgents, having lost hope in an intervention of King Ferdinand, requested that Ball, who had previously landed near the village of Qrendi on the south of the island, preside over the National Assembly. He changed the name of the assembly to that of National Congress and declared himself chief of government. In March, the Congress appealed to King George III to assume sovereignty over Malta, but no answer came from Pitt&#x27;s ministry.

The starving French garrison received a little relief at the beginning of February 1799. The frigate &quot;La Boudeuse&quot; ran the blockade and entered the Grand Harbour. However, she was the last ship to re-supply Vaubois and his men.

On 1 November 1799 Nelson was off Valletta on board the &quot;Foudroyant&quot;. Vaubois, who was still hoping for relief from France, summarily rejected a new surrender demand. Vaubois wrote: &quot;Mindful of being worthy of the respect of your country, as you are with our own, we are resolved to defend this fortress to the last.&quot;

Nelson ordered Ball to take command of the Maltese forces – about 2,000 Maltese troops along with about 1,500 irregulars, unpaid, ill-equipped and half-starving. A hard pressed King Ferdinand agreed to confirm Ball as Governor of Malta.

The whole Maltese population, running short of essential provisions, was living close to famine so that the siege was turning into a race of which side would starve first. The British and Maltese, together with a Neapolitan contingent of 1,200 men, got some relief in January 1800.

However, General Vaubois waited in vain for supplies. French preparations had dragged on until Napoleon—now &quot;Premier Consul&quot;—appointed &quot;Contre-amiral&quot; Jean-Baptiste Perrée to command a relief expedition. The squadron, comprising &quot;Le Généreux&quot; (one of the two survivors of the Battle of the Nile), three corvettes serving as armed storeships, and one armed storeship, all with some 3,000 men, arms, food and ammunition on board, sailed from Toulon-sur-Mer on 6 February 1800. The expedition ended in disaster. On the morning of 18 February English ships met the French squadron off Lampedusa island. &quot;Contre-amiral&quot; Perrée was killed at the start of the action and at 1.30 p.m. &quot;Le Généreux&quot; struck her colours. The rest of the French convoy returned to Toulon.

On 24 August Vaubois dispatched the frigates &quot;La Diane&quot; and &quot;La Justice&quot; to run the blockade to France. The &quot;Success&quot; sighted them, with the &quot;Northumberland&quot; and the captured &quot;Le Généreux&quot;, now crewed by the British, giving chase. The British captured &quot;La Diane&quot; but &quot;La Justice&quot; escaped under cover of darkness.

=== Vaubois&#x27; surrender ===

The siege was nearing its end. The French garrison had eaten all the horses, the mules, the dogs, the cats and the rats of Valletta. Finally, on 4 September 1800, Vaubois sent an emissary under a flag of truce to the British commander Major-General Henry Pigot. The following day, Pigot and Captain George Martin, RN, negotiated terms of surrender with General Vaubois and &quot;Contre-amiral&quot; Villeneuve. (Ironically the French excluded Captain Alexander Ball, as chief of the Maltese, from the negotiations, as the French did not want to surrender to the Maltese.) The British granted Vaubois and the French fair terms and the honours of war, including the right to keep their arms and spoils. Vaubois and his troops were quickly repatriated to Marseilles.

==After Malta==

While the siege continued, Vaubois became a senator on 27 July 1800. He was named a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1804 and a Count of the Empire in 1808. In 1809 he led a division of the National Guard. He became a peer of France and Knight of St. Louis in 1814. During the Hundred Days in 1815, Vaubois did not join Napoleon. He died in 1839.

<doc id="1246261" wikidata="Q5171512" url="?curid=1246261" title="Cornell Chimes">
<text>The Cornell Chimes is a 21-bell chime in McGraw Tower on the central campus of Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, United States.

The chime originally had nine bells, donated by Jennie McGraw. They first rang at the University&#x27;s opening ceremonies on October 7, 1868, and have since marked the hours and been used for chiming concerts.

The tower, long called &quot;the Library Tower&quot;, was renamed in 1961. Whether the new name was intended to honor Jennie McGraw or her father, trustee John McGraw, was not specified at the time.

==The Cornell Chimes==
The bells are played by a group of &quot;chimesmasters.&quot; About ten chimesmasters play three concerts daily during the school year and a reduced schedule during the summer and semester breaks, making it one of the largest and most frequently played chimes in the world. The chimes are sometimes mistakenly called a &quot;carillon&quot; which is incorrect as a true carillon has at least 23 bells, and a different playing console.

Many styles of music are played on the bells, including classical and modern pieces by a range of composers, including Beethoven, The Beatles, Franz Schubert, and Scott Joplin. Commonly played pieces include Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Pomp and Circumstance Marches&quot; and the theme from &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, as well as a multitude of original compositions. The chimes&#x27; music library contains over two-thousand specially arranged pieces and original compositions—both solos and duets.

Every morning concert, since 1869, has begun with the &quot;Cornell Changes&quot; (affectionately known as the &quot;Jennie McGraw Rag&quot;). The chimesmasters&#x27; goal is to play its 549 notes as quickly as 
possible. The Cornell &quot;Alma Mater&quot; is played at the midday concert, and the &quot;Cornell Evening Song&quot; at the end of the evening concert.

Each spring semester potential chimesmasters, &quot;compets&quot;, undergo a rigorous ten-week competition to become a chimesmaster. The only requirement to compete is an ability to read music and the energy to climb the 161 steps to operate the playing clavier (there is no mechanical assistance). The first stage of competition requires that compets learn the three traditional Cornell pieces (the &quot;Jenny McGraw Rag,&quot; the &quot;Alma Mater,&quot; and the &quot;Cornell Evening Song&quot;). Compets play a practice instrument, where the levers strike tuned bars with hammers (like a xylophone), allowing them to learn the instrument without the whole campus listening. To advance to the next round of competition, compets must demonstrate their mastery of the three songs, in addition to sight reading a piece. This audition is played on the main chimes console, but compets only press the dampers halfway, and therefore the chimes remain silent. Those who pass the silent audition move on to coached concerts, and then, finally, judged concerts, where compets take on the full responsibilities of a chimesmaster.

The Cornell Chimes welcome visitors to all concerts.

==McGraw Tower==
In 1873, the chimes were moved from a ground-level playing stand to McGraw Hall. In 1891, they were moved to their permanent home atop McGraw Tower, designed by Cornell alumnus William Henry Miller. The 173-foot (53 m) tower is Cornell&#x27;s most prominent landmark and is adjacent to Uris Library. The tower is also home to an office, museum, practice room, and a restored 1875 Seth Thomas clock with a 14-foot pendulum. Visitors can still see the clockworks and pendulum, but the clock was linked to the Global Positioning System in 1999.

<text>Ján Bahýľ (25 May 1856 – 13 March 1916) was a Slovak inventor and engineer. He specialised in military science, military construction, and engineering. Flying machines were a particular interest of his. In 1895, he was granted a patent on the helicopter.

==Biography==
Bahýľ was born in Zvolenská Slatina in the Austrian Empire (in present-day Slovakia). In 1869 he graduated from the Mining Academy of Banská Štiavnica with a diploma in technical drawing. After graduation, he joined the Hungarian Army; his superior officers noticed his technical ability and transferred him to the technical staff. The new assignment allowed Bahýľ to study at the Vienna Military Academy, where he graduated in 1879 and was commissioned as a lieutenant. During his time in the army, Bahýľ developed a number of inventions, many of which involved hydraulics.

==Inventions==
Bahýľ financed his first invention himself. It was called the Steam Tank, and was purchased by the Russian army. Bahýľ was granted seventeen patents in all, including patents for the tank pump, a hot air balloon combined with an air turbine, the first petrol engine car in Slovakia (in partnership with Anton Marschall), and a lift to the Bratislava Castle.
He flew one of the earliest helicopter models which he developed using an internal combustion engine as a power source. On 5 May 1905, a version reached a height of and flew .

<text>The Portuguese Wikipedia () is the Portuguese-language edition of Wikipedia (written Wikipédia, in Portuguese), the free encyclopedia. It was started on 11 May 2001.

Wikipedia is the nineteenth most accessed website in Brazil and the tenth most accessed in Portugal. , it is the largest Wikipedia by article count, containing articles.

== History ==
The Portuguese Wikipedia was the third edition of Wikipedia to be created, simultaneously with other languages. It started its activities on 11 May 2001, having reached the mark of one hundred thousand articles on 26 January 2006.
From late 2004, the edition grew rapidly. In May 2005, it overtook both the Spanish and Italian language Wikipedias. By comparison, in May 2004 it was only the 17th Wikipedia by the number of articles.

Portuguese articles can contain variations of writing, as European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese have differences in vocabulary and usage. Articles can contain written characteristics of one or the other variant depending on who wrote the article.

The Portuguese Wikipedia community decided not to split a separate Brazilian Portuguese version off from the Portuguese Wikipedia. In 2005, a proposal to fork Portuguese Wikipedia and create a Brazilian Portuguese (&quot;pt-br&quot;) version was voted down by the Wikimedia community. In 2007 another one to create European Portuguese was rejected too by the Wikimedia community. In 2009 another one to create in Brazilian Portuguese was rejected, but this time by language committee, according to new policies to create new Wikipedia editions, with the following explanation: &quot;Brazilian Portuguese is not a separate language.. this is a requirement.&quot;

Beginning in January 2007, the project experienced a decrease of the share of edits by unregistered users (from around 20 to around 15%) and an increase of the share of such edits being reverted, from about 15% to a peak of 25% in late 2008, which suggests an increase in disruptive editing.
In the same month, a JavaScript was added that forced all unregistered users to preview their edit before saving it.

In December 2010, the Portuguese Wikipedia overtook the Dutch language Wikipedia in a number of articles, but in the first quarter of 2011, it was surpassed by the Russian and Dutch language Wikipedias, ranking in the tenth position.

In April 2016, the project had 1388 active editors who made at least five edits in that month.

== Characteristics ==

The Portuguese language Wikipedia is different from the English one in a number of aspects.
* Fair use images were forbidden until 2009. Debates have been raised before concerning the fair use policy, all of them failing to have the uploading of such images allowed. Uploading pictures at the Portuguese Wikipedia has even been fully disabled until then. In August 2009, though, a new debate was raised in order for users to approve or deny the creation of a policy of uploading fair use media (named &quot;Uso Restrito de Conteúdo&quot; there, which translates as &quot;Restricted Use of Contents&quot;). This debate resulted in 142 votes for &quot;yes&quot; against 120 votes for &quot;no&quot;, which means the policy was approved and implemented.
* Like English, Portuguese has regional differences in vocabulary, grammar, and spelling. It is widely accepted that an article written in Brazilian Portuguese should be kept as it is, and the same applies to articles in European Portuguese. However, if one rewrites the article in another variant (provided content was changed, not merely the language), but leaves some words in the former variant, these words should be rewritten in accordance with the new version&#x27;s variant of the article.
* In order to hinder spamming and trolling, completion of a CAPTCHA image was required for all unregistered users to make any edit. It was disabled on 1 January 2014.
* In 2020, after a community vote that lasted from 4 September to 4 October, the Portuguese Wikipedia no longer allows edits from unregistered users (IP addresses).

As of 2019, the Portuguese Wikipedia had 316,000 unique categories, 3.57% of them lacking an appropriate page in the category . The average article in this language version has nine categories, while the ratio of unique categories per article is 0.314. The largest number of articles belong to Arts (16%) and Geography (14%) categories. Articles related to Crime and Events have the highest average quality. Those related to Health are read more often, and articles in the Business category have the highest average author interest.

In April 2022, the European Union&#x27;s East StratCom Task Force published its findings that four pro-Russian disinformation outlets (&quot;SouthFront&quot;, &quot;NewsFront&quot;, InfoRos and Strategic Culture Foundation) were referenced in 45 articles of the Portuguese Wikipedia. This made it the fourth Wikipedia edition most affected by such disinformation, behind the Russian, Arabic and Spanish Wikipedias. They wrote:

<text>Dariga Nursultanqyzy Nazarbayeva (, &quot;&quot;; born 7 May 1963) is a Kazakh businesswoman and politician who is the daughter of Nursultan Nazarbayev who was the President of Kazakhstan from 1990 to 2019. She was a member of the Mäjilis from 2004 to 2007, 2012 to 2015 and 2021 to 2022. She was Deputy Chairwoman of Mäjilis from 2014 to 2015 until being appointed as a Deputy Prime Minister under Massimov&#x27;s cabinet. She was a member of the Kazakh Senate from 2016 to 2020, serving as Senate Chairwoman from 2019 to 2020. She is one of the richest women in Kazakhstan.

Nazarbayeva began her career in 1994 in media business as she headed Khabar, the largest national television agency in Kazakhstan. In 2003, she founded the Asar party and the following year later in 2004 for the first time, Nazarbayeva was elected to the Mäjilis. While serving the post there, the Asar in 2006 merged with the Amanat, a ruling party that was led by her father Nazarbayev. Following the dissolution of the Mäjilis in 2007, Nazarbayeva did not run for re-election and remained out of politics until her eventual return in 2012 to the Mäjilis seat where she was the deputy chairwoman and parliamentary leader of Amanat. In 2015, Nazarbayeva was appointed by her father as Deputy Prime Minister under PM Karim Massimov before then returning to the Parliament in 2016 as a Senator. After her father&#x27;s resignation from presidency in 2019, Nazarbayeva took over Kassym-Jomart Tokayev&#x27;s role as the Senate Chairwoman, while Tokayev in turn, became the President of Kazakhstan. In 2020, she was unexpectedly removed from the post by Tokayev shortly before returning to the Mäjilis once more in 2021.

Because of Nazarbayeva&#x27;s high-ranking official positions and relations with her father, it had been widely speculated that she was potentially being prepared for presidency as a way to succeed Nazarbayev&#x27;s legacy in a nepotist fashion despite the dismissed claims by Nazarbayev himself.

==Early life and education==
Nazarbayeva was born at Temirtau on 7 May 1963. In 1981–1982, she completed her secondary education at K. Satpayev Gymnasium No. 56 in Alma-Ata. From 1980 to 1983, she studied at the history department at Moscow State University. She graduated from the S. M. Kirov Kazakh State University in 1985, and in 1991, defending her thesis for a candidate degree in historical sciences at the Moscow State University. In 1998, Nazarbayeva defended her thesis for Ph.D degree in political sciences at the Russian Academy of State Service.

== Career ==
Nazarbayeva became the vice president of her mother Sara Nazarbayeva&#x27;s Bobek Children&#x27;s Charity Fund.

In 1994, Nazarbayeva became the vice president of the Television and Radio of Kazakhstan Republican Corporation. In 1995, the Khabar TV channel was created. The organizations associated to Nazarbayeva purchased the Europa Plus Radio Station, KTK and NTK television companies and popular newspaper &quot;Сaravan&quot;. TV-Media and Alma-Media companies were established to manage the new media holding. In 1998, Khabar was transformed into a closed joint-stock company, and Nazarbayeva became President of the Company, and in 2001, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors.

Since the late 1990s, Nazarbayeva has regularly appeared on Kazakh TV as a singer. Her repertoire includes Kazakh folk songs, Russian romances, opera arias and songs by Joe Dassin. In 2011, Nazarbayeva gave a recital “Salem, Russia” in Moscow on the new stage in the Bolshoi Theater, and the Organ Hall of Astana. A Russian company Universal Music filmed her concert performances at various venues for the musical television movie My Star. The two-part film was presented in 2012. In 2013, she gave a concert, co-organized by Count Pierre Sheremetev, at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, with the Orchestre Lamoureux directed by Dmitry Yablonsky and the Sazgen sazi group directed by Baghdat Tilegenov, and with some artists as the pianist Timur Urmancheev, Sundet Baigozhin or Medet Chotabaev. 

== Political career ==

=== Chair of the Asar (2003–2006) ===

In October 2002, Nazarbayeva became the Chairperson of the Board of Trustees of the Choice of the Young People block; it was proposed to create the Congress of Youth of Kazakhstan at the first conference of the block.

In October 2003, Nazarbayeva organized and became the leader of the Asar Republican Party. In a few months, more than 167,000 applications were collected from those wishing to join Asar; 139,000 applications were processed and authenticated, and 77,000 signatures were submitted to the Ministry of Justice for registration. In December 2003, the party was registered.

According to the results of the elections to the Mäjilis in 2004, the party polled 541,239 (11.38%) votes on a party list basis and ranked the third; Nazarbayeva became an elected member from the Asar party-list in the Mäjilis, along with three deputies from the party who were elected in single-member constituencies.

On 4 July 2006, an extraordinary party convention was held where they decided to merge with the Otan Republican Political Party (later Nur Otan from December 2006), with Nazarbayeva being elected as the deputy chairwoman of Amanat under her father&#x27;s chairmanship.

=== Parliamentarian career ===

==== Member of the Mäjilis (2004–2007, 2012–2015, 2021–present) ====
In February 2005, a new Deputy Group of Aimak formed in the Parliament, consisting of 36 deputies (28 deputies from the Mäjilis and 8 deputies from the Senate). Nazarbayeva was elected as the group leader. The main goals of the Aimak Deputy Group were to promote and monitor the implementation of existing state and industry programs aimed at regional development, take an active part in the development and legislative support of administrative reform and local self-government and develop entrepreneurship. She remained as a member of the Mäjilis until its dissolution on 20 June 2007.

In the 2012 Kazakh legislative election, Nazarbayeva ran again in the Amanat party list which won 83 seats. She headed the Mäjilis Committee on Socio-Cultural Development.

On 3 April 2014, Nazarbayeva was unanimously chosen as a Mäjilis deputy chairwoman and the parliamentary leader of Amanat. On 11 September 2015, she was appointed as a Deputy Prime Minister.

Nazarbayeva reappeared on the Amanat party-list at a congress on 25 November 2020 where she made her first public appearance since being dismissed from the Senate Chairwoman post, bringing her candidacy to the Mäjilis seat again. The Amanat maintained its control over the Mäjilis following the 2021 legislative elections, sweeping 76 seats. From there, she became a member of the Committee for Economic Reforms and Regional Development.

==== Member of the Senate (2016–2020) ====
On 13 September 2016, Nazarbayeva was appointed to the Senate; she was designated as the head of the Senate&#x27;s International Affairs, Defense, and Security Committee on 16 September.

===== Chairwoman of the Senate =====
On the same day her father stepped down as the President of Kazakhstan, Nazarbayeva was appointed as the Senate Chair in a unanimous secret ballot on 20 March 2019. She succeeded Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in that role, who became the acting president of the country. According to The New York Times, this may have been a signal that Nazarbayeva was being groomed to become president herself. Several speculations arose that Nazarbayeva was preparing her presidential bid for the 2019 presidential elections in which the allegations were revealed to be false according to her close aide on 9 April 2019. 

On 2 May 2020, she was removed from the Senate and her role as the Chair by Tokayev. Many theories arose that either Tokayev was expanding his political influence or a sign of growing feud between the Kazakhstan&#x27;s ruling elite. Others claimed that the reason was due to public scandals regarding her son Aisultan and the British court case which ruined Nazarbayeva&#x27;s reputation and her fathers image.

== Personal life ==
===Family===

Nazarbayeva had a long marriage to Kazakh businessman and politician Rakhat Aliyev until their divorce in June 2007. Aliyev held senior posts in Kazakhstan&#x27;s domestic intelligence agency and foreign ministry, and later as ambassador to Austria. In 2004, a woman alleged to be Aliyev&#x27;s mistress was found dead, having fallen from a tall apartment building in Beirut. He was stripped of his titles in 2007 after critiquing President Nazarbayev for altering the nation&#x27;s constitution to allow him to be president for life. Aliyev claimed that his divorce was executed without his consent, and that it was forced by Nazarbayev.

Aliyev was convicted in absentia for various crimes in Kazakhstan. Austria refused to extradite him, but were preparing to try him for the kidnapping and murder of two Kazakh bank officials. Before the trial, he was found dead in his Austrian jail cell due to alleged suicide.

Nazarbayeva has two sons with Aliyev, Nurali and Aisultan, and a daughter Venera. She is also a grandmother. Nurali&#x27;s wife gave birth to Laura Aliyeva in 2013.

On 23 January 2020, Nazarbayeva&#x27;s son, Aisultan, made a public statement on his Facebook page, claiming that his grandfather Nazarbayev was allegedly his dad and that his mother Nazarbayeva has been attempting to kill him while living in London. Nazarbayeva made no responses regarding the case made by her son. The next day on 24 January, a female correspondent from the RFE/RL attempted to receive response from Nazarbayeva regarding her son&#x27;s claims as she was walking by in the Parliament building hallway where one of Nazarbayeva&#x27;s security guards ended up grabbing the reporter by the arm and covering her mouth. On 16 August 2020, Aisultan was found dead in London with the cause of his death being allegedly due to cardiac arrest. In response to the incident, Nazarbayeva stated that &quot;my family is devastated at the loss of our beloved Aisultan and we ask for privacy at this very difficult time.&quot;

=== Offshore activities ===

In 2018, it was revealed by the Panama Papers that Nazarbayeva was the sole shareholder of an off-shore sugar company based in the British Virgin Islands which did business in Kazakhstan. Her son, Nurali, was also named in the papers as being a client of Mossack Fonseca in Panama, and having two companies and luxury yacht also registered in the British Virgin Islands. According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;this is a sharp contradiction from Nazarbayev&#x27;s frequent appeals to entrepreneurs in the oil-rich country to pay taxes in Kazakhstan.&quot; The Panama Papers also suggest she may be the owner, through an off-shore company, of 221B Baker Street, the $183 million property famous as being the fictional address of Sherlock Holmes.

On 10 March 2020, a British court announced the names of the owners of properties worth $100 million, which were issued an UWO in the spring of 2019. The owners turned out to be Nazarbayeva and her eldest son, Nurali Aliyev, with his wife Aida. The representative of the defendants at the hearing explained that the owners can confirm the source of the funds, since at that time they were engaged in business. In April, the High Court of Justice declared the claims by the British law enforcement agencies unfounded and as a result, the case was overturned.

===Wealth===
According to &quot;Forbes Magazine&quot; in 2013 her wealth was about $595 million. It was through her involvement in the companies such as Europe Plus Kazakhstan JSC, NTK, AlmaInvestHolding, Almatystroysnab LLP, and ALMA TV. She also founded Kazakhstan&#x27;s main TV network, Khabar Agency.

<text>The Topeka Constitutional Convention met from October 23 to November 11, 1855 in Topeka, Kansas Territory, in a building afterwards called Constitution Hall. It drafted the Topeka Constitution, which banned slavery in Kansas, though it would also have prevented free blacks from living in Kansas. The convention was organized by Free-Staters to counter the pro-slavery Territorial Legislature elected March 5, 1855, in polling tainted significantly by electoral fraud and the intimidation of Free State voters.

The Topeka Constitution marked the first effort to form a Kansas governmental structure and define its basis in law. Free-State delegates passed the constitution on December 15, 1855. The Territorial election for officers and approval of the constitution on January 15, 1856, was boycotted by most pro-slavery men. Among those elected was Charles L. Robinson as governor. The constitution was forwarded to Washington with a plea to the U.S. Congress for admitting Kansas as a free state, under this constitution. President Pierce, anxious to placate Southerners and keep them in the Union, condemned the document. It was presented in the Senate by Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan and in the House by Representative Daniel of Indiana. It passed the House by two votes on July 2, but was held in committee by the Senate. On July 8, Senator Stephen A. Douglas took up the Topeka Constitution in a bill counter to Senator Cass, which threw the issue back upon the people of Kansas in accordance with the provisions of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

Following the model of Oregon, citizens of the 2nd Territorial District petitioned the 1855 Free State convention to incorporate a &quot;black exclusion&quot; clause in the Topeka Constitution. This would have prevented not only the enslaved, but also free African Americans from residing in the state. It was rejected by convention president James H. Lane and others, who allowed the issue to be voted on separately in the January 1856 referendum; the results favored exclusion.

With renewed determination, the Free State legislature reconvened in Constitution Hall on January 5, 1858. Governor Robinson urged keeping the State government intact, and laws were passed. The Topeka Constitution was again sent to the Congress, but no action was taken. The South controlled Congress, and it was not going to admit Kansas as a free state if it could help it. It was not so much that slavery was benign, as most of them believed, it was that a new free state would change the balance of power in the polarized Senate.

The Topeka Constitution was followed by the equally unsuccessful, pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution of 1857 and the Free-State Leavenworth Constitution of 1858. Finally the Wyandotte Constitution (1859) led to Kansas being admitted into the Union as a free state in 1861, five years after it first applied, the Southern legislators blocking it having departed &quot;en masse&quot;. The Civil War began four months later.

The conflict between the Free State legislature and the Territorial legislature, each seeking control of Kansas&#x27;s destiny, was carried out with guns and the ballot box. These conditions and surrounding national implications inspired the term Bleeding Kansas. Following the Free State elections, in a lengthy address on January 24, 1856, President Franklin Pierce proclaimed the Topeka government to be illegitimate and ordered the arrest of its leaders: Despite this proclamation, the Topeka Legislature convened on March 4, 1856, and again on the Fourth of July to ask the Congress for admittance of the state. The legislature was dispersed on July 4, 1856, by three squadrons of federal troops under the command of Colonel Edwin Vose Sumner. Sumner later called this the most painful duty of his career. Never before had a body of U.S. citizens, meeting to exercise their right to vote, been broken up by federal forces.

<text>A clearness committee is a process for discernment within the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). It is often used when a member of the meeting seeks to reach clarity on how to respond to a concern or dilemma. 

Like Quaker business meetings, meetings of clearness committees are considered a form of meeting for worship and are based on the principle that the inner light is present in all people. The process thus is one of aiding the person seeking clearness in finding the answer within, rather than offering outside advice or guidance. A clearness committee can be requested by anyone for any reason and will usually be appointed by one of the standing committees of a Monthly Meeting.

In addition to those requested by individuals, clearness committees are appointed by most meetings when a person applies for membership and when a couple seeks marriage under the care of the meeting. In these cases, the committee serves the dual purpose of helping the person or couple find clearness that this is the proper step and ensuring that the meeting is ready to take the member or couple under their care.

Clearness committees were frequently used by the Quaker-influenced Movement for a New Society and occasionally show up in other progressive organizations in the Philadelphia area, especially those with pacifist or nonviolence orientations.

<text>Mykines (Danish: &quot;Myggenæs&quot;) is the westernmost of the 18 main islands of the Faroese Archipelago.

It lies west of 7.5 degrees W, effectively putting it in the UTC-1 region. However, Mykines uses Greenwich Mean Time like the rest of the Faroes. The only settlement on the island is also called Mykines.

==Description==
On the northern side of the island is the valley of Korkadalur, where there are great columns of basalt, called the Stone-wood. To the west of Mykines is the 1 km long islet Mykineshólmur, with several sea stacks clustered at its western end, where a lighthouse was built in 1909. A 40m-long footbridge connects its eastern end with Mykines.

===Geology===

Mykines belongs to the oldest part of the Faroe Islands and was formed about 60 million years ago. The Faroese basalt is divided into three phases of eruption: the lower and oldest, the middle, and the upper and youngest; the lowest formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava through long fissures, forming flat volcanoes. In the sound between Mykines and Mykineshólmur, Holmgjogv, one can see one of the most abundant of such flows on the Faroes, with a depth of about 50 m. The interspersed layers of softer volcanic tuff between the layers of basalt are differentially eroded, so forming, especially on the steep northern side of the islet, some of the richest bird cliffs in the world. The highest peak on the island is Knúkur at 560 metres above sea level.

===Flora and fauna===
Mountain hares (&quot;Lepus timidus&quot;) have been introduced, and inhabit the mountain area and surrounding valleys. The Mykines house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus mykinessiensis&quot;) is endemic for Mykines, and this might suggest an early introduction, maybe as early as in the 6th century by the Irish monks, who cultivated this island. Its closest relative was the now extinct St Kilda house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus muralis&quot;).

====Important Bird Area====
Large numbers of puffins and gannets inhabit Mykines and Mykineshólmur. On the rocks at the water&#x27;s edge there are colonies of cormorants, while the eroded tuff layers in the cliffs make perfect nesting ledges for guillemots and razorbills. On the grassy slopes above the bird cliffs, thousands of puffins have their burrows, and their guano fertilizes the slopes. Access to the puffin colony is subject to a fee.

Mykines, including Mykineshólmur, has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially northern fulmars (50,000 pairs), Manx shearwaters (2500 pairs), European storm petrels (50,000 pairs), northern gannets (200 pairs), European shags (250 pairs), black-legged kittiwakes (23,000 Pairs), Atlantic puffins (125,000 pairs), common guillemots (9500 individuals) and black guillemots (200 pairs).

==History==
It has been suggested that the name Mykines is pre-Norse in origin, coming from &quot;muc-innis&quot;, an Irish term for &quot;pig island&quot;. This may be a reference to whales, which are known as &quot;muc-mhara&quot; (sea sows) in Irish.

*625 – Palynology indicates oats and barley were grown on Mykines, possibly by early settlers such as monks and hermits.
*1592 – Peter Claussøn Friis, a Norwegian priest, described the Faroese mouse as a distinct species, and the Mykines mouse as a subgroup having especially long powerful hind legs.
*1595 – (approx) on 25 April, fifty boats from around the country were shipwrecked in a sudden storm, and all the working men of Mykines lost their lives (estimated 20 to 30 men).
*1667 – the Dutch ship &quot;Walcheren&quot; was wrecked on Mykines and the islanders salvaged goods from the ship.
*1909 – the building of the Lighthouse on Mykines Holm and construction of the first bridge over Holmgjogv, the narrow strait between Mykines and Mykines Holm.
*1928 – radio beacons were installed at Nólsoy and Mykines lighthouses, making radio navigation possible for the first time, and Mykines got a telephone connection to the outside world.
*1942 – in spring British forces completed a radar station.
*1953 – the second bridge over Holm Gjogv was built.
*1970 - A Fokker F27 Friendship, with registration TF-FIL, from Flugfélag Íslands on flight from Bergen to Vágar Airport, crashed in bad weather on Mykines on 26 September. The captain and 7 passengers, all seated on the left side of the plane, were killed. 26 passengers and crew survived, some with serious injuries. Three passengers hiked for an hour to reach Mykines village to alert the authorities. Most of the villagers went up the mountain to aid the survivors before the arrival of the Danish patrol vessel F348 &quot;Hvidbjørnen&quot;. A marble memorial was placed in the church.
*1970 – Mykines lighthouse was automated and the last man moved from the Holm, which had been occupied continuously from 1909 by a varying population of up to 22 people (including children).
*1989 – the third bridge between Mykines and Mykineshólmur came into use in June.

==Population==
The population of the island declined over the 20th century, with 11 permanent residents of Mykines village in 2004; the oldest inhabitant was 75 and the youngest six years old. Although there are 40 houses in the village, only six are inhabited year-round. Earlier Mykines was one of the largest villages in the Faroes, with a population of 170 people in 1940. From 1911 to 2004 Mykines was a separate community but in 2005 it merged administratively with Sørvagur kommune. Famous people from Mykines include the painter Sámal Joensen-Mikines (1906-1979).

<text>Rick White (born 5 December 1970) is a Canadian musician and singer-songwriter. Born in Moncton, New Brunswick, he was a member of indie bands Eric&#x27;s Trip, Elevator, Perplexus, and The Unintended. White first played music, in a band called &quot;Bloodstain&quot;, in 1984, before starting his own band &quot;in 1986&quot;, called &quot;T.C.I.B&quot;, which later transitioned into the band name, &quot;The Underdogs&quot;, which lasted from the summer of 1987, until June 1988. By the summer of 1989, The Underdogs had broken up, and Rick had joined another band, &quot;The Forest&quot;, which lasted from the 1989, until June 1990, with a one-off recording session happening in December, 1990. Prior to Eric&#x27;s Trip, and while in Eric&#x27;s Trip, White also recorded two solo-produced albums, one in March 1990, and another in August 1991, but both were not released until 2022. Known for lo-fi recording, he has also recorded and produced music for The Sadies, Orange Glass, Joel Plaskett, One Hundred Dollars, Dog Day, HotKid and his former Eric&#x27;s Trip bandmate Julie Doiron.

White released his first solo album, &quot;The Rick White Album&quot;, in late 2005. He followed it with &quot;Memoreaper&quot; in 2007. White&#x27;s next album, &quot;137&quot;, is a double album which was released in 2009 on Blue Fog Recordings. He released a record in 2019, &quot;The Opening&quot;, and was recorded with Eiyn Sof. His latest release, with all original material, is &quot;Music Box&quot;, which was released in 2023.

White is the former roommate of Dallas Good, founding member of The Sadies. White lived with Good during the early 2000s after moving from Moncton to Toronto.

<text>Ruoholahti (; ; both meaning &quot;Grass Bay&quot;) is a quarter in Helsinki, part of the Länsisatama neighbourhood and Kampinmalmi district. It is located in the southwestern part of the central city area of Helsinki, close to the Lauttasaari island, and it functions as the principal connection between the Helsinki city centre and the city of Espoo to the west. Ruoholahti is inhabited by approx. 3300 people. The &quot;Länsisatama&quot; port is also situated in Ruoholahti.

==History==
The Ruoholahti area was created in the 1910s by connecting several small islands with earth fill. Its purpose was to accommodate the above-mentioned port. In the 1940s there also developed a small industrial district whose most notable buildings were the cable factory (Kaapelitehdas) of Nokia (which later became a cultural centre when Nokia gave up cable manufacturing and moved on to telecommunications), the headquarters of the Finnish government-owned alcohol enterprise Alko (transformed in 2002 into the Ruoholahti shopping centre), and the legendary Lepakko or Lepakkoluola (Bat cave), an old warehouse building used in 1967–1979 as emergency accommodation for homeless alcoholics and then, from 1979 to 1999 as an independent centre of youth culture from 1979 to 1999 (it was demolished to make way for an office building). In the 1960s the &quot;Länsiväylä&quot; highway (part of the Finnish national road 51) was built through Ruoholahti to connect Helsinki to southern Espoo via Lauttasaari.

A planning competition for the future of the area had been held in the middle 1980s. The area started changing significantly in 1991 when the construction of a new residential and office area began. The most striking of the office buildings was the High Tech Centre (HTC), designed by architect Kai Wartiainen and completed in 2001. The Helsinki Metro was extended to Ruoholahti in 1993. A short canal was built through the area to reinforce the image of a maritime district. Nokia returned to the area in 1999, when a new research centre was opened, designed by architect Tuomo Siitonen.

==Future==
As a part of the Kampinmalmi area and for its great location near the Helsinki city center, Ruoholahti is a vivid and easy area to live and work. There are lot of parks and kindergartens, so the area is very popular among the families. Ruoholahti has its own school: Ruoholahden Ala-aste which is now facing a positive challenge to fulfil the needs of its expanding neighbourhood Jätkäsaari. Jätkäsaari got its own school in autumn 2017 - first it only served first and second graders, but in 2019 there was a promise of Jätkäsaari primary and secondary school.

Ruoholahti now competes with Jätkäsaari area and there are many everyday services, shops, restaurants, coffee shops and one can participate in sports, study music in Ruoholahden Konservatorio or explore arts in Kaapelitehdas. Ruoholahti-Jätkäsaari has its own choir, own football teams (operated by PPJ) and many local activities. Ruoholahti and Jätkäsaari area is an optimal area to live for people in all ages.

Ruoholahti is also known as a business center, many succeed brands have an office in Ruoholahti - just to mention Supercell and Huawei.

In the 2017 municipal elections, the Greens party led in Ruoholahti.

<text>Chryse Planitia (Greek, &quot;Golden Plain&quot;) is a smooth circular plain in the northern equatorial region of Mars close to the Tharsis region to the west, centered at . Chryse Planitia lies partially in the Lunae Palus quadrangle, partially in the Oxia Palus quadrangle, partially in the Mare Acidalium quadrangle. It is 1600 km or 994 mi in diameter and with a floor 2.5 km below the average planetary surface altitude, and has been suggested to be an ancient buried impact basin, though this is contested. It has several features in common with lunar maria, such as wrinkle ridges. The density of impact craters in the range is close to half the average for lunar maria.

Chryse Planitia shows evidence of water erosion in the past, and is the bottom end for many outflow channels from the southern highlands as well as from Valles Marineris and the flanks of the Tharsis bulge. It is one of the lowest regions on Mars ( below the mean surface elevation of Mars), so water would tend to flow into it
The elevation generally goes down from the Tharsis Ridge to Chryse. Kasei Valles, Maja Valles, and Nanedi Valles
appear to run from high areas (Tharsis Ridge) to Chryse Planitia. On the other side of Chryse, to the east, the land gets higher. Ares Vallis travels from this high region, then empties into Chryse. Much of Tiu Valles and Simud Valles move toward Chryse as well.
Several ancient river valleys discovered in Chryse Planitia by the Viking Orbiters, as part of the Viking program, provided strong evidence for a great deal of running water on the surface of Mars.

It has been theorized that the Chryse basin may have contained a large lake or an ocean during the Hesperian or early Amazonian periods since all of the large outflow channels entering it end at the same elevation, at which some surface features suggest an ancient shoreline may be present. Chryse basin opens into the North Polar Basin, so if an ocean was present Chryse would have been a large bay.

&quot;Viking 1&quot; landed in Chryse Planitia in 1976, but its landing site was not near the outflow channels and no fluvial features were visible; the terrain at that point appeared primarily volcanic in origin. The Mars Pathfinder landed in Ares Vallis, at the end of one of the outflow channels emptying into Chryse.

<doc id="1246346" wikidata="Q1136665" url="?curid=1246346" title="Vignetting">
<text>In photography and optics, vignetting ( ) is a reduction of an image&#x27;s brightness or saturation toward the compared to the image center. The word &quot;&quot;, from the same root as &quot;vine&quot;, originally referred to a decorative border in a book. Later, the word came to be used for a photographic portrait that is clear at the center and fades off toward the edges. A similar effect is visible in photographs of projected images or videos off a projection screen, resulting in a so-called &quot;hotspot&quot; effect.

Vignetting is often an unintended and undesired effect caused by camera settings or lens limitations. However, it is sometimes deliberately introduced for creative effect, such as to draw attention to the center of the frame. A photographer may deliberately choose a lens that is known to produce vignetting to obtain the effect, or it may be introduced with the use of special filters or post-processing procedures.

When using zoom lenses, vignetting may occur all along the zoom range, depending on the aperture and the focal length. However, it may not always be visible, except at the widest end (the shortest focal length). In these cases, vignetting may cause an exposure value (EV) difference of up to 3EV.

==Causes==
There are several causes of vignetting. Sidney F. Ray distinguishes the following types:

* Mechanical vignetting
* Optical vignetting
* Natural vignetting

A fourth cause is unique to digital imaging:
* Pixel vignetting

A fifth cause is unique to analog imaging:
* Photographic film vignetting

===Mechanical vignetting===
Mechanical vignetting occurs when light beams emanating from object points located off-axis (laterally or vertically off from the optical axis of an optical system under consideration) are partially blocked by external objects of the optical system such as thick or stacked filters, secondary lenses, and improper lens hoods. This has the effect of changing the entrance pupil shape as a function of angle (resulting in the path of light being partially blocked). Darkening can be gradual or abrupt – the smaller the aperture, the more abrupt the vignetting as a function of angle.

When some points on an image receives no light at all due to mechanical vignetting (the paths of light to these image points is completely blocked), then this results in a restriction of the Field of View (FOV) – parts of the image are then completely black.

===Optical vignetting===
This type of vignetting is caused by the physical dimensions of a multiple element lens. Rear elements of the lens are shaded by elements in front of them, which reduces the effective lens opening for off-axis incident light. The result is a gradual decrease in light intensity towards the image periphery. Optical vignetting is sensitive to the lens aperture and can often be cured by a reduction in aperture of 2–3 stops. (An &quot;increase&quot; in the F-number.)

===Natural vignetting===
Unlike the previous types, natural vignetting (also known as natural illumination falloff) is not due to the blocking of light rays. The falloff is approximated by the cos4 or &quot;cosine fourth&quot; law of illumination fall off. Here, the light fall off is proportional to the fourth power of the cosine of the angle at which the light impinges on the film or sensor array. Wide angle rangefinder designs and the lens designs used in compact cameras are particularly prone to natural vignetting. Telephoto lenses, retrofocus wide angle lenses used on SLR cameras, and telecentric designs in general are less troubled by natural vignetting. A gradual grey filter or postprocessing techniques may be used to compensate for natural vignetting, as it cannot be cured by stopping down the lens. Some modern lenses are specifically designed so that the light strikes the image perpendicular or nearly so, eliminating or greatly reducing vignetting.

=== Pixel vignetting ===
Pixel vignetting only affects digital cameras and is caused by angle-dependence of the digital sensors. Light incident on the sensor at normal incident produces a stronger signal than light hitting it at an oblique angle. Most digital cameras use built-in image processing to compensate for optical vignetting and pixel vignetting when converting raw sensor data to standard image formats such as JPEG or TIFF. The use of offset microlenses over the image sensor can also reduce the effect of pixel vignetting.

== Post-shoot ==
For artistic effect, vignetting is sometimes applied to an otherwise un-vignetted photograph and can be achieved by burning the outer edges of the photograph (with film stock) or using digital imaging techniques, such as masking darkened edges. The Lens Correction filter in Photoshop can also achieve the same effect.

In digital imaging, this technique is used to create a low fidelity appearance in the picture.

To give a photo a &#x27;retro&#x27; look - that it was made with an old camera or lens - one could add an obvious &#x27;vignette&#x27; using &#x27;lens correction&#x27; or burning in margins by any of several techniques.

There is a much more general use.

Viewers&#x27; eyes are attracted to brightness so if the areas to the corners or edges are brighter than the desired center of interest, eyes may wander towards that brightness. To direct the viewers&#x27; attention, the bright corners or margins are barely perceptibly darkened. This darkening &#x27;fences off&#x27; the bright area and keeps the viewer&#x27;s eyes where the photographer wants.

The object is to keep the view inside the image but, at the same time, not be obvious.

<text>Walter Millis (March 16, 1899 – March 17, 1968) was an editorial and staff writer for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; from 1924 to 1954. Millis was a staff member of the Fund for the Republic from 1954 to 1968. He later became the director of the Fund for the Republic&#x27;s study of demilitarization in 1954.

Millis, widely recognized as a historical writer, wrote eight books including: &quot;Road to War: America 1914–1917&quot;, &quot;This is Pearl! The United States and Japan—1941&quot;, &quot;Why Europe Fights&quot;, &quot;Viewed Without Alarm: Europe Today&quot;, &quot;Arms and Men: A Study of American Military History&quot;, &quot;The Martial Spirit: A Study of Our War with Spain&quot;, and &quot;An End to Arms&quot;. He also edited &quot;The Forrestal Diaries&quot;.

==Early life==
Millis was born in Atlanta, GA, the son of John Millis, a regular army officer, and Mrs. Mary Raoul Millis. He graduated from Yale University, although his studies were interrupted by World War I, when he joined the Army and became a second lieutenant in the field artillery. He received his A.B. degree from Yale in 1920.

==Family==
His first marriage, to the former Norah Thompson, ended in divorce. They had two children, Walter Millis, Jr. and Sarah (Millis) McCoy. His second marriage, to fashion journalist Eugenia Sheppard in 1944, ended with his death. He was survived by six grandchildren.

<text>Equilin is a naturally occurring estrogen sex hormone found in horses as well as a medication. It is one of the estrogens present in the estrogen combination drug preparations known as conjugated estrogens (CEEs; e.g. Premarin) and esterified estrogens (EEs; e.g. Estratab, Menest). CEEs is the most commonly used form of estrogen medications in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms in the United States. Estrone sulfate is the major estrogen in CEEs (about 50%) while equilin sulfate is the second major estrogen in the formulation, present as about 25% of the total.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Equilin is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs), the ERα and ERβ. In terms of relative binding affinity for the ERs, equilin has about 13% and 49% of that of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Analogously to the reversible transformation of estrone into estradiol by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, equilin can be converted into the more potent estrogen 17β-dihydroequilin in the body. This estrogen has about 113% and 108% of the relative binding affinities of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Equilin is present in CEEs in the form of equilin sulfate, which itself is inactive and acts as a prodrug of equilin via steroid sulfatase.

Similarly to synthetic estrogens like ethinylestradiol, equilin and CEEs have disproportionate effects in certain tissues such as the liver and uterus relative to bioidentical human estrogens like estradiol and estrone. Because of their disproportionate potency in the liver, equilin and CEEs have relatively increased effects on liver protein synthesis compared to estradiol.

A dosage of 0.25 mg/day equilin sulfate is equivalent to 0.625 mg/day CEEs in terms of relief from hot flashes. At a dosage of 0.625 mg/day equilin sulfate, the increases in circulating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), corticosteroid-binding globulin, and angiotensinogen were 1.5 to 8 times those observed with estrone sulfate. Equilin has about 42% of the relative potency of CEEs in the vagina and 80% of the relative potency of CEEs in the uterus, while its more active form, 17β-dihydroequilin, has about 83% of the relative potency of CEEs in the vagina and 200% of the relative potency of CEEs in the uterus.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Equilin has about 8% of the relative binding affinity of testosterone for SHBG, relative to 12% in the case of estrone. In terms of plasma protein binding, it is bound 26% to SHBG and 13% to albumin. The metabolic clearance rates of equilin and equilin sulfate are 2,640 L/day/m2 and 175 L/day/m2, respectively. In accordance, the biological half-life of equilin sulfate is substantially longer than that of equilin. Equilin is converted into 17β-dihydroequilin in the liver and in other tissues. Equilin and 17β-dihydroequilin can also be transformed into equilenin and 17β-dihydroequilenin. Equilin is excreted in the form of glucuronide conjugates.

==Chemistry==
Equilin, also known as δ7-estrone or as 7-dehydroestrone, as well as estra-1,3,5(10),7-tetraen-3-ol-17-one, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid and an analogue of estrone. In terms of chemical structure and pharmacology, equilin is to 17β-dihydroequilin (δ7-17β-estradiol) as estrone is to estradiol.

<doc id="1246361" wikidata="Q5617591" url="?curid=1246361" title="Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary">
<text>The Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (formerly Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary) protects the wildlife, habitats, and cultural resources of one of the most diverse and bountiful marine environments in the world, an area of 3,295 square miles off the northern and central California coast. The waters within Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary are part of a nationally significant marine ecosystem, and support an abundance of life, including many threatened or endangered species.

==About==
In 1972, in response to a growing awareness of the value of the coastal waters of the United States, the United States Congress passed the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. The Act authorized the designation of National Marine Sanctuaries to protect significant waters and secure habitat for aquatic species, shelter historically significant shipwrecks and other cultural resources, and serve as valuable spots for research, fishing, wildlife viewing, boating, and tourism.

Designated on January 16, 1981, Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) spanned 1,279 square miles (966 square nautical miles) just north and west of San Francisco Bay, and protected open ocean, nearshore tidal flats, rocky intertidal areas, estuarine wetlands, subtidal reefs, and coastal beaches within its boundaries. In 2015, GFNMS expanded north and west of their original boundaries to encompass 3,295 square miles, and changed their name to Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. GFNMS has administrative jurisdiction over the northern portion of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, from the San Mateo/Santa Cruz County line northward to the existing boundary between the two sanctuaries. GFNMS maintains an administrative office and public Visitor Center on Crissy Field in the Presidio of San Francisco.

GFNMS is located within the California Current ecosystem, one of four major eastern boundary currents in the world, that stretches along the western coast of North America from southern Canada to northern Mexico. Due to a high degree of wind-driven upwelling, there is a ready supply of nutrients to surface waters and the California Current ecosystem is one of the most biologically productive regions in the world.

GFNMS is a globally significant, extraordinarily diverse, and productive marine ecosystem that supports abundant wildlife and valuable fisheries. It provides breeding and feeding grounds for at least twenty-five endangered or threatened species; thirty-six marine mammal species, including blue, gray, and humpback whales, harbor seals, elephant seals, Pacific white-sided dolphins, and one of the southernmost U.S. populations of threatened Steller sea lions; over a quarter-million breeding seabirds; and one of the most significant white shark populations on the planet.

GFNMS adjoins two other National Marine Sanctuaries, Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary. It comprises part of the United Nations&#x27; Golden Gate Biosphere Reserve. Within the sanctuary are the Farallon Islands and associated National Wildlife Refuge.

<doc id="1246377" wikidata="Q716955" url="?curid=1246377" title="Robert L. Eichelberger">
<text>Robert Lawrence Eichelberger (9 March 1886 – 26 September 1961) was a general officer in the United States Army who commanded the Eighth United States Army in the Southwest Pacific Area during World War II.

A 1909 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, he saw service in Panama and on the Mexican border before joining the American Expeditionary Force Siberia in 1918. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for repeated acts of bravery in Siberia. After the war, he transferred to the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps. He attended the Command and General Staff College and the Army War College, and was Secretary of the War Department General Staff, working for the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General Douglas MacArthur.

In 1940, Eichelberger became the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He instituted a number of reforms, cutting back activities such as horseback riding and close order drill, and substituting modern combat training, in which cadets participated in military exercises alongside National Guard units. He acquired Stewart Field as a training facility, which gave cadets a chance to qualify as pilots while still at West Point. He became commander of the 77th Infantry Division in March 1942, and I Corps in June.

In August 1942, Eichelberger was abruptly sent to the Southwest Pacific Area, where he led American and Australian troops in the bloody Battle of Buna–Gona. In 1944, he had notable victories at Hollandia and the Battle of Biak. As Commanding General of the newly formed Eighth Army, Eichelberger led the invasion of the Southern Philippines, clearing the islands of Mindoro, Marinduque, Panay, Negros, Cebu, and Bohol. By July 1945, his forces had defeated the Japanese on Mindanao. In August 1945, Eichelberger&#x27;s Eighth Army began a three-year stint as part of the Occupation of Japan. He retired from the Army at the end of 1948.

==Early life==
Robert Lawrence Eichelberger was born at Urbana, Ohio on 9 March 1886, the youngest of five children of George Maley Eichelberger, a farmer and lawyer, and Emma Ring Eichelberger. He grew up on the family farm that had been established by his grandfather. He graduated from Urbana High School in 1903, and entered Ohio State University, where he joined Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.

In 1904, Eichelberger persuaded his father&#x27;s former law partner, William R. Warnock, now the congressman for Ohio&#x27;s 8th congressional district, to appoint him to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He entered West Point in June 1905. His class of 1909 was a distinguished one. Some 28 of them ultimately wore the stars of general officers, including Jacob L. Devers, John C. H. Lee, Edwin F. Harding, George S. Patton and William H. Simpson. Eichelberger was a poor student, as he had been at high school and Ohio State, but did become a cadet lieutenant, and graduated 68th in his class of 103.

Eichelberger was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 25th Infantry on 11 June 1909, but was transferred to the 10th Infantry at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, on 22 July. In March 1911, the 10th Infantry was despatched to San Antonio, Texas, where it became part of the Maneuver Division, which was formed to undertake offensive operations during the Border War with Mexico. Then, in September, it was sent to the Panama Canal Zone. It was in Panama that Eichelberger met Emmaline (Em) Gudger, the daughter of Hezekiah A. Gudger, the Chief Justice of the Panama Canal Zone Supreme Court. After a brief courtship, they were married on 3 April 1913.

On returning to the United States in March 1915, Eichelberger was posted to the 22nd Infantry at Fort Porter, New York. It too was sent to the Mexican border, and was based at Douglas, Arizona, where Eichelberger was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 July 1916. In September, he became Professor of Military Science and Tactics at Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri.

==World War I and Russian Civil War==
Following the American entry into World War I in April 1917, Eichelberger was promoted to captain on 15 May. In June he was posted to the 20th Infantry at Fort Douglas, Utah, and commanded a battalion until September, when he was transferred to the newly formed 43rd Infantry at Camp Pike, Arkansas. He was Senior Infantry Instructor at the 3rd Officers&#x27; Training Camp at Camp Pike until February 1918, when he was assigned to the War Department General Staff in Washington, D.C., where he became an assistant to Brigadier General William S. Graves, and was promoted to major on 3 June 1918.

In July 1918, Graves was appointed commander of the 8th Division, which was then based at Palo Alto, California, and scheduled to be sent to France in 30 days. Graves took Eichelberger with him, initially as his Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3 (Operations). While he was en route to California, Eichelberger learned from Graves that the 8th Division&#x27;s destination had changed, and it was now bound for Siberia instead. President Woodrow Wilson had agreed to support the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and Graves would command the American Expeditionary Force Siberia (AEFS). The AEFS departed San Francisco on 15 August, with Eichelberger as its Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (Intelligence).

Graves was instructed that his mission was political rather than military, and accordingly he was to &quot;maintain strict neutrality&quot;. Eichelberger found himself thrust into a complex political, diplomatic, and military environment. Soon after arriving, he was appointed to the ten-nation Inter-Allied Military Council, which was responsible for Allied strategy. Eichelberger became convinced that America&#x27;s objectives in Siberia were not necessarily the same as those of her French and British allies, but it was far from clear what they actually were, especially when the State Department and the War Department did not always agree. American policy called for protecting the Trans-Siberian Railway, but this was under the control of Admiral Alexander Kolchak&#x27;s White Army forces, whom Eichelberger considered to be &quot;murderers&quot; and &quot;cutthroats&quot;.

Eichelberger was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for repeated acts of bravery while assigned to the Expeditionary Force. His citation read:

For his services in Siberia, Eichelberger was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 28 March 1919. Graves prevented him from receiving the British Distinguished Service Order and the French Legion of Honor, as had other members of the Inter-Allied Military Council. Eichelberger did, however, receive the Japanese Imperial Order of Meiji, Order of the Sacred Treasure, and Order of the Rising Sun. Siberia gave Eichelberger a chance to observe the Japanese Army at first hand, and he was impressed by what he saw of their training and discipline. He concluded that, if properly led, they would be more than a match for American troops. The AEFS was withdrawn in April 1920.

==Between the wars==
Instead of returning to the United States following his service in Siberia, Eichelberger became Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (Intelligence), of the Philippine Department on 4 May 1920. Like many officers in the aftermath of World War I, he was reduced in rank to his permanent rank of captain on 30 June 1920, but was immediately promoted to major again the next day. Em had joined him in Vladivostok in March 1920, and the two first travelled to Japan before moving on to the Philippines. In March 1921, Eichelberger became head of the Intelligence Mission to China. He established intelligence offices in Peking and Tientsin, and met the President of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. He finally returned to the United States in May 1921, where he was assigned to the Far Eastern Section of the G-2 (Intelligence) Division of the War Department General Staff.

A major disappointment for Eichelberger was his failure to make the General Staff Eligibility List (GSEL). Under the National Defense Act of 1920, only officers on this list could be promoted to brigadier general. Concluding that his prospects for promotion in the infantry were poor, at the urging of the Adjutant General, Major General Robert C. Davis, he transferred to the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps on 14 July 1925. He continued to work with the War Department General Staff, but now in the Adjutant General&#x27;s Office. In April 1925, he was posted to Fort Hayes, Ohio, as Assistant Adjutant General, 5th Corps Area.

Davis had offered to nominate Eichelberger for a place at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. Eichelberger joined 247 other officers there in July 1924. Since the students were seated alphabetically, he sat next to the officer who topped the class, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower. Other students in the class included Joseph Stilwell, Leonard Gerow, and Joseph T. McNarney. Eichelberger graduated as a Distinguished Graduate, one of the top quarter of the class, and stayed on at the college as its Adjutant General. In 1929, he became a student at the Army War College. On graduation, he was posted back to the Adjutant General&#x27;s Office in Washington, D.C.

In 1931, Eichelberger was sent to West Point as its adjutant. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 August 1934. In April 1935, he became Secretary of the War Department General Staff, working for the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General Douglas MacArthur. Eichelberger transferred back to the infantry in July 1937, although he remained Secretary of the War Department General Staff until October 1938, in the rank of colonel from 1 August.

The new Chief of Staff, General Malin Craig offered Eichelberger command of the 29th Infantry, the demonstration regiment based at Fort Benning, Georgia. Eichelberger turned this down, as he had been away from the infantry for many years, and some infantry officers might be jealous. Instead, he accepted command of the 30th Infantry, a less prestigious unit stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco, but there were still officers who resented someone attaining command of a regiment at the age of 52. Before departing, he took a brief course at the Infantry School at Fort Benning to reacquaint himself with the infantry. As part of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 30th Infantry took part in a series of major training exercises over the next two years.

==World War II==

===Training in the United States===
Eichelberger was promoted to brigadier general in October 1940, and the next month received orders to become deputy division commander of the 7th Infantry Division under Stilwell. At the last minute, these orders were changed. Major General Edwin &quot;Pa&quot; Watson interceded with President Franklin Roosevelt to have Eichelberger appointed the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Before taking up the position, Eichelberger met with Craig&#x27;s successor as Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, who warned him that the courses at the Command and General Staff College and Army War College had been drastically shortened in order to meet the needs of the expanding Army, and that West Point would suffer a similar fate unless Eichelberger could make the course more relevant to the Army&#x27;s immediate needs.

As superintendent, Eichelberger attempted &quot;to bring West Point into the twentieth century&quot;
. He cut back activities such as horseback riding and close order drill, and substituted modern combat training, in which cadets participated in military exercises alongside National Guard units. He acquired Stewart Field as a training facility, and required cadets to undergo basic flight training. This gave cadets a chance to qualify as pilots while still at West Point. Yet he also concerned himself with the dismal state of the West Point football team. Through Pa Watson, he was able to persuade the Surgeon General of the United States Army to waive weight restrictions to allow heavier players to be recruited, and hired Earl Blaik to coach the team.

Over time, Marshall came to believe that Eichelberger&#x27;s talents were wasted at West Point, but he was opposed by Pa Watson, who wanted Eichelberger to remain at the academy. When Marshall told Watson that Eichelberger&#x27;s chances for promotion to major general were being adversely affected by being denied the chance to command a division, Watson added Eichelberger&#x27;s name to the top of a promotion list and had the President sign it. In this manner, Eichelberger was promoted to major general in July 1941.

After the United States declaration of war upon Japan in December 1941, Eichelberger applied for a transfer to an active command. He was given the choice of three new divisions, and chose the 77th Infantry Division, which was activated at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in March 1942. The other two divisions were given to Major Generals Omar Bradley and Henry Terrell, Jr. The three generals and their staffs attended a training course at Fort Leavenworth. For his chief of staff, Eichelberger chose Clovis Byers, an officer who had also attended Ohio State and West Point, and had been a fellow member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.

Eichelberger&#x27;s period in command of the 77th Infantry Division was brief, for on 18 June 1942 he became commander of I Corps, with Byers as his chief of staff. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service with the 77th Infantry Division. I Corps consisted of the 8th, 30th, and 77th Infantry Divisions. Eichelberger was given the initial task of arranging a demonstration for dignitaries including Winston Churchill, Marshall, Henry Stimson, Sir John Dill, and Sir Alan Brooke. The demonstration was judged a success, although the trained eyes of Brooke and Lesley McNair noted flaws. Within days, two of the division commanders were relieved of their commands. Eichelberger was nominated to command American forces in Operation Torch, and he was ordered to conduct training in amphibious warfare with the 3rd, 9th, and 30th Infantry Divisions in Chesapeake Bay in cooperation with Rear Admiral Kent Hewitt.

===Battle of Buna-Gona===
On 9 August 1942, his orders were abruptly changed. MacArthur, now Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Area, had requested that a corps headquarters be sent to his command. Major General Robert C. Richardson, Jr., had originally been detailed for the assignment, but as Marshall informed MacArthur, &quot;Richardson&#x27;s intense feelings regarding service under Australian command made his assignment appear unwise.&quot; Eichelberger&#x27;s I Corps headquarters was ready for overseas service and had training in amphibious warfare, and Eichelberger had experience working with MacArthur, so Marshall selected him for the job instead. Eichelberger was not happy with the assignment, especially when he found out about Richardson, and &quot;knew General MacArthur well enough to know that he was going to be difficult to get along with&quot;.

Eichelberger departed for Australia on 20 August with 22 members of his staff in a B-24 Liberator. I Corps controlled the two American divisions in Australia: Major General Forrest Harding&#x27;s 32nd Infantry Division, based at Camp Cable near Brisbane; and Major General Horace Fuller&#x27;s 41st Infantry Division at Rockhampton, Queensland, where Eichelberger, who was promoted to lieutenant general on 21 October, decided to establish his I Corps headquarters inside the Criterion Hotel. His I Corps came under the command of Lieutenant General Sir John Lavarack&#x27;s Australian First Army. On meeting Australian commanders, Eichelberger noted that many of them &quot;had already been in combat with the British in North Africa, and, though they were usually too polite to say so, considered the Americans to be—at best—inexperienced theorists.&quot; He was disturbed at the level of training received by the two American divisions. Instead of training for jungle warfare, they were following the same syllabus used in the United States. He warned MacArthur and MacArthur&#x27;s chief of staff, Major General Richard K. Sutherland, that the divisions could not be expected to meet veteran Japanese troops on equal terms. He decided in September that the 32nd Infantry Division should proceed to New Guinea first, as Camp Cable was inferior to the 41st Infantry Division&#x27;s camp at Rockhampton.

Eichelberger&#x27;s fears were realized when the overconfident 32nd Infantry Division suffered a serious reverse in the Battle of Buna-Gona. Harding was confident that he could capture Buna &quot;without too much difficulty&quot;, but poor staff work, inaccurate intelligence, inadequate training and, above all, Japanese resistance, frustrated the American efforts. The Americans found themselves confronted by a network of well-sited and expertly prepared Japanese positions, accessible only through a swamp. The Americans&#x27; failure damaged their relationship with the Australians and threatened to derail MacArthur&#x27;s entire campaign. Eichelberger and a small party from I Corps headquarters were hurriedly flown up to Port Moresby in a pair of C-47 Dakotas on 30 November. MacArthur ordered Eichelberger to assume control of the battle at Buna. According to Byers and Eichelberger, MacArthur told him &quot;in a grim voice&quot;:

The next day, Eichelberger&#x27;s party was flown to Dobodura, where he assumed command of US troops in the Buna area. He relieved Harding, and replaced him with the division&#x27;s artillery commander, Brigadier General Albert W. Waldron. He relieved other officers too, appointing a 26-year-old captain to command a battalion. Some of the 32nd Infantry Division&#x27;s officers privately denounced Eichelberger as ruthless and &quot;Prussian&quot;. He set an example by moving among the troops on the front lines, sharing their hardships and danger. Despite the risk, he purposefully wore his three silver stars while at the front, even though he knew Japanese snipers targeted officers, because he wanted his troops to know their commander was present. After the snipers seriously wounded Waldron in the shoulder, Eichelberger appointed Byers to command the 32nd Infantry Division, but he too was wounded on 16 December. This left Eichelberger as the only American general in the forward area, and he assumed personal command of the division. He was not the most senior general present though; he served under the command of Australian Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, whom he referred to in letters to Em as &quot;my grand colleague&quot;.
After the fall of Buna, Eichelberger was placed in command of the Allied force assembled to reduce the remaining Japanese positions around Sanananda, with Australian Major General Frank Berryman as his chief of staff. The battle continued until 22 January 1943. The price of victory at Buna was high. The 32nd Division lost 707 dead and 1,680 wounded; another 8,286 were hospitalized with tropical diseases, principally malaria. Its men referred to their division cemetery as &quot;Eichelberger Square&quot;. On 24 January, Eichelberger flew back to Port Moresby where he was warmly welcomed by Herring. The next day he flew back to Rockhampton. For the battle, Eichelberger received the Distinguished Service Cross along with ten other generals, all of whom received the same citation. Some, like Herring, had served at the front; others, like Sutherland, had not. Eichelberger was also created an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Byers recommended Eichelberger for the Medal of Honor but the nomination was disapproved by MacArthur. Another officer on Eichelberger&#x27;s staff, Colonel Gordon B. Rogers then submitted the recommendation directly to the War Department. MacArthur informed the War Department that &quot;Among many outside the immediate staff of this officer, there was criticism of his conduct of operations which while not detracting from his personal gallantry led to grave considerations at one time of his relief from command.&quot;

===New Guinea Campaign===
In February 1943, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger&#x27;s Sixth United States Army headquarters arrived in Australia. Since Sixth Army would do all the planning, and there was as yet little scope for corps-sized operations, Eichelberger found himself with a training role, preparing the 24th Infantry Division, which had arrived from Hawaii, and the 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions, which had returned from Papua, for future missions. The War Department asked in May 1943 if Eichelberger could be released to command the First United States Army, but MacArthur would not release him. Later, it asked if he could be released to command the Ninth United States Army, but this was also refused, and this job went to Eichelberger&#x27;s West Point classmate William H. Simpson. Instead, he was given responsibility for Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s visit to Australia in September 1943. She visited Sydney Melbourne and Rockhampton, and had dinner with the Governor General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, and the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, in Canberra.
In January 1944, Eichelberger was informed that he would be in charge of the next operation, a landing at Hansa Bay with the 24th and 41st Infantry Divisions. However, in March this was cancelled in favor of Operation Reckless, a landing by the same force at Hollandia. The operation meant leapfrogging the Japanese defenses at Hansa Bay, but was risky because it was outside the range of land-based air cover. Cover was instead provided by aircraft carriers of the United States Pacific Fleet, but this meant that the operation had to adhere to a strict timetable. Hoping to avoid a repeat of Buna, Eichelberger meticulously planned the operation, and implemented a thorough training program that emphasized physical fitness, individual initiative, small unit tactics, and amphibious warfare. The operation went well, mainly because surprise was achieved and few Japanese were present in the area. However, poor topographical intelligence led to an inability to clear some beaches due to their being backed by swamps. Supplies piled up on the beaches, with fuel and ammunition being stored together in some instances. On 23 April a single Japanese plane ignited a fuel dump, which caused a fire that resulted in 124 casualties and the loss of 60 per cent of the ammunition stockpile. An appalled Krueger felt that Eichelberger had been let down by his staff, and offered to transfer Byers to an assistant division commander&#x27;s post, but Eichelberger turned down the offer.

In June 1944, Eichelberger was summoned to Sixth Army headquarters by Krueger. The Battle of Biak, where the 41st Infantry Division had landed in May, was going badly, and the airfields that MacArthur had promised would be available to support the Battle of Saipan were not in American hands. Eichelberger found that the Japanese, who were present in larger numbers than originally reported, were ensconced in caves overlooking the airfield sites. While the Americans were better trained and equipped than at Buna, so too were the Japanese, who employed their new tactics of avoiding costly counterattacks and exacting the maximum toll for ground gained. After seeing the situation for himself, Eichelberger concluded that Fuller&#x27;s 41st Infantry Division had not done too badly. Nonetheless, as at Buna, Eichelberger relieved a number of officers that he felt were not performing as the battle ground on. His orders were to supersede Fuller as task force commander rather than relieve him as division commander, but Fuller requested his own relief, and Krueger obliged him. On Eichelberger&#x27;s recommendation, Fuller was replaced by Brigadier General Jens A. Doe. Krueger was unimpressed with Eichelberger&#x27;s performance on Biak, concluding that Eichelberger&#x27;s tactics were unimaginative, and no better than Fuller&#x27;s, and may have delayed rather than expedited the capture of the island. On the other hand, MacArthur thought sufficiently highly of Eichelberger&#x27;s performance to award him the Silver Star.

===Philippines Campaign===
While still on Biak, Eichelberger learned that MacArthur had selected him to command the newly formed Eighth United States Army, which arrived at Hollandia in August 1944. Eichelberger took two officers with him from I Corps: Byers and Colonel Frank S. Bowen, his G-3. The Eighth Army assumed control of operations on Leyte Island from Sixth Army on 26 December, the day after MacArthur and Krueger announced that organized resistance there had ended. The troops there included Eichelberger&#x27;s old command, the 77th Infantry Division. In two months, Sixth Army had killed over 55,000 Japanese soldiers on Leyte, and estimated that only 5,000 remained alive on the island. By 8 May 1945, the Eighth Army had killed over 24,000 more.

In January, the Eighth Army entered combat on Luzon, landing Major General Charles P. Hall&#x27;s XI Corps on 29 January near San Antonio and Major General Joseph M. Swing&#x27;s 11th Airborne Division at Nasugbu, Batangas two days later. Combining with Sixth Army, the Eighth Army enveloped Manila in a great pincer movement. Eichelberger assumed personal command of the operation, which involved an advance on Manila by the lightly equipped 11th Airborne Division. The audacious advance made rapid progress until it was halted by well-prepared positions on the outskirts of Manila. MacArthur awarded Eichelberger another Silver Star.

Eighth Army&#x27;s final operation of the war was that of clearing out the southern Philippines, including the major island of Mindanao, an effort that occupied the soldiers of the Eighth Army for the rest of the war. In six weeks, the Eighth Army conducted 14 major and 24 minor amphibious operations, clearing Mindoro, Marinduque, Panay, Negros, Cebu, and Bohol. In August 1945, Eichelberger&#x27;s Eighth Army became part of the Occupation of Japan. In the one instance when the Japanese formed a self-help vigilante guard to protect women from rape by off-duty GIs, the Eighth Army ordered armoured vehicles in battle array into the streets and arrested the leaders, and the leaders received long prison terms. The only source for this account is Eichelberger&#x27;s diary, which does not mention any sex crimes but does mention the beatings of several GIs.

He was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his services as commander of I Corps, a second for his command of Eighth Army in the Philippines, and a third for the occupation of Japan. He also received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, two oak leaf clusters to his Silver Star Medal, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Air Medal. He also received a number of foreign awards, including Grand Officer of the Order of Orange Nassau with swords from the Netherlands, Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour from France, Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown and the Croix de Guerre with palm from Belgium, the Order of Abdon Calderón from Ecuador, the Distinguished Service Star, Liberation Medal, and Legion of Honor from the Philippines, and Grand Officer of the Military Order of Italy.

==Retirement and death==
After nearly 40 years of service, Eichelberger retired with the rank of lieutenant general on 31 December 1948. In 1950, he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where he lived with his wife Em for the rest of his life. He suffered from a number of health problems, including hypertension and diabetes, and had his gall bladder removed. His name appeared in a series of articles for the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; on his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific, actually written by ghostwriter Milton MacKaye. They subsequently expanded the articles into a book, &quot;Our Jungle Road to Tokyo,&quot; which one reviewer described as &quot;a straightforward and modest account of the campaigns of the Army ground forces from the Buna operation to the Philippines and victory.&quot; The book sold reasonably well, and Harry Truman and Omar Bradley requested autographed copies. In 1951 he traveled to Hollywood, where he served as technical consultant on &quot;Francis Goes to West Point&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Day the Band Played&quot; (1952), but he was not altogether happy with the results. He turned his hand to writing articles about the Far East for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, but gave this away in 1954. He then worked on the lecture circuit, giving speeches about his experiences, but gave this up too in 1955. He campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960.

The United States Congress, in recognition of his service, promoted Eichelberger, along with a number of other officers who had commanded armies or similar higher formations, to general in 1954. He was distressed that Harding and Fuller were still hurt and angry with him over being relieved of their commands, something he felt was really MacArthur&#x27;s fault. In turn, Eichelberger never forgave Krueger or Sutherland for real or imagined slights. When Sutherland tried to talk, Eichelberger refused to speak to him. Eventually, Eichelberger decided to write a tell-all book that &quot;would destroy the MacArthur myth forever&quot;. For this purpose, he gave his papers to Duke University. Jay Luuvas, a historian at Allegheny College, published his letters in 1972 as &quot;Dear Miss Em: General Eichelberger&#x27;s War in the Pacific 1942–1945&quot;. However, Eichelberger maintained his warm wartime relationship with Herring. Herring and his wife Mary stayed with the Eichelbergers in Asheville in 1953, and they exchanged regular letters. Eichelberger underwent exploratory prostate surgery in Asheville on 25 September 1961. Complications set in and he died from pneumonia the following day. He was buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Domo is an experimental robot made by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology designed to interact with humans. The brainchild of Jeff Weber and Aaron Edsinger, cofounders of Meka Robotics, its name comes from the Japanese phrase for &quot;thank you very much&quot;, &quot;domo arigato&quot;, as well as the Styx song, &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot;. The Domo project was originally funded by NASA, and has now been joined by Toyota in funding robot&#x27;s development.

==Purpose==
Domo was created to test many robotic circuits and commands that are very complex.

==Origin==
The home of the Domo Project is with the Humanoid Robotics Group at MIT Artificial Intelligence Labs. Its existence is inspired by the robot projects that came before it.

The Cardea Robot Project was a research project led by Professor Rodney Brooks in the Humanoid Robotics Group at MIT. The lab group worked to create a cable-drive brushless Series Elastic Actuator arm mounted to a Segway platform. Jeff Weber and Aaron Edsinger-Gonzales were a part of this research, specifically responsible for the design and implementation of the robotic arm. This collaboration allowed Edsinger-Gonzales and Weber to take some of the research and apply it to a new robot, Domo.

Edsinger and Weber collaborated on many other robots as well, and their experience working with the Kismet page and Cog projects influenced the design of Domo. Kismet was a robotic head developed by Cynthia Breazeal for experimenting with social expressions and cues. Edsinger&#x27;s role in the project was helping to develop the early stages of Kismet&#x27;s eye detection module, which allowed Kismet to make eye contact while interacting. The Cog project was intended to explore the way that intelligence is formed through social interaction. The Cog robot was designed to emulate the human body&#x27;s motor points and limbs and to accept input stimuli from these so that it could use its limbs in a human-like way. Edsinger&#x27;s contribution to the Cog project was a Series Elastic Actuator arm and controllers for the body of the robot. Though the research direction of these robots is very different from the Domo Project, the design of the eye detection module and the Series Elastic Actuator arm are integrated into Domo&#x27;s design.

==Design==
Domo was created in order to research manipulation and interaction with stimuli and machine learning of sensorimotor skills. To accomplish this, the design was required to have particular consideration as to how the robot would be able to interact with unfamiliar stimuli. The research also required Domo to be able to perceive and act upon its surroundings. Satisfying these concerns meant that Domo needed to be able to function without a complete model of the world, rather, it was equipped with the ability to build a model for itself.

===Mechanical parts===
====Head====
Domo&#x27;s robotic head consists of seven degrees of freedom for the upper head which is attached to a neck with two degrees of freedom. There are two eyes, each with a single wide-angle camera. The cameras are capable of video capture at either 640×480 at 30 frames per second (frame/s) or 1024×768 at 15 frame/s. The two cameras tilt along the same degrees of freedom, but have individual degrees of freedom to allow for independent panning. A set of eyelids is included to use for expressions.

Heads of previous robots, such as Cog, were impeded by the bundle of electrical cords that would run to the eye cameras and motors. Domo&#x27;s design runs all the cables down through the neck so that they are tucked out of the way. This allows Domo a great deal of range and freedom in head articulation.

The head movement is facilitated by brushed direct-current motors. Potentiometer position sensors in the motor provide feedback as to the head&#x27;s absolute position at startup, so Domo does not require a calibration routine before being able to function.

The main focus of the head design was for Domo to be able to emulate human eye movement. Human eye movements range from very quick and explosive movements to slow and accurate movements for following moving stimuli, so careful consideration was needed to design Domo&#x27;s head and vision system.

These eyes are linked to a cognitive system that is a networked cluster of Linux machines. The YARP (Yet Another Robot Platform) software suite is utilized for the cognitive system to do visual processing.

====Arms====
Rather than designing Domo&#x27;s arms for absolute precision, Edsinger and Weber designed the arms to work more closely to that of a human. Human arms are adept at sensing and controlling the forces at every joint, giving up precision in position for compliance. Translating this to a humanoid robot required the design to include some tolerance and compliance at every joint while also being able to keep track of and output torque.

Domo&#x27;s arms have six degrees of freedom, two at the shoulder and four in the arm and wrist. The joints are Series elastic actuators (SEA) driven by custom brushless DC motors. The degrees of freedom contain cable drive systems, with the drive cables hidden discreetly in the center of the joints to not impede movement. Series elastic actuators are used to provide force-sensing capabilities to the arms. The sensors embedded throughout the arms are linked up to the cognitive system.

====Hands====
The design of a humanoid hand is required to incorporate some way to measure and output force. A few older designs had force sensors in the fingertips. While this would work in a known environment, it does not provide enough feedback to work in a novel and unknown environment. The controllers in Domo&#x27;s hands are able to sense forces at the individual joints. This allows the hands to execute a grasp of an object even without a model of the object&#x27;s size, shape or material.

Each hand consists of three fingers powered by four actuators. There is one actuator for each finger and the fourth is to control the spread between two of the fingers. The two fingers are spread using gears, while the third remains in place.

==Abilities==
Domo will adapt to its surroundings by testing the physical nature of things by touching them or shaking them. Its abilities include determining the volume of an item, placing items on shelves, pouring drinks for humans, shaking hands, and giving hugs.

===Perception===
Using the two cameras mounted on its head and the visual processing system, Domo is able to analyze the size and shape of an object to prepare for interaction. This is done without prior knowledge about an object and allows Domo to accomplish tasks in unknown environments.

===Learning===
Domo&#x27;s architecture allows for the robot to remember previous sensory experiences. Domo is able to learn about its own sensorimotor abilities and is able to fine-tune the modulation of its actions based on previously accomplished tasks.

===Manipulation===
Domo&#x27;s hands were designed to be dexterous and capable of many different grasps and movements. However, this cannot be accomplished without the design of the software system to be adept at managing different controllers for each of its joints. This allows the robot to be able to react quickly and change its arm activity. This is critical for the robot to be able to attempt to perform real world tasks.

<text>Unbibium, also known as element 122 or eka-thorium, is a hypothetical chemical element; it has placeholder symbol Ubb and atomic number 122. &quot;Unbibium&quot; and &quot;Ubb&quot; are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol respectively, which are used until the element is discovered, confirmed, and a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, it is expected to follow unbiunium as the second element of the superactinides and the fourth element of the 8th period. Similarly to unbiunium, it is expected to fall within the range of the island of stability, potentially conferring additional stability on some isotopes, especially 306Ubb which is expected to have a magic number of neutrons (184).

Despite several attempts, unbibium has not yet been synthesized, nor have any naturally occurring isotopes been found to exist. There are currently no plans to attempt to synthesize unbibium. In 2008, it was claimed to have been discovered in natural thorium samples, but that claim has now been dismissed by recent repetitions of the experiment using more accurate techniques.

Chemically, unbibium is expected to show some resemblance to cerium and thorium. However, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ; for example, it is expected to have a ground state electron configuration of Og] 7d1 8s2 8p1 or [Og] 8s2 8p2, despite its predicted position in the g-block superactinide series.

==Introduction==
==History==
===Synthesis attempts===
====Fusion-evaporation====
Two attempts were made to synthesize unbibium in the 1970s, both propelled by early predictions on the island of stability at &quot;N&quot; = 184 and &quot;Z&quot; &gt; 120, and in particular whether superheavy elements could potentially be naturally occurring. The first attempts to synthesize unbibium were performed in 1972 by Flerov et al. at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), using the heavy-ion induced hot fusion reactions:

: + → * → no atoms

Another unsuccessful attempt to synthesize unbibium was carried out in 1978 at the GSI Helmholtz Center, where a natural erbium target was bombarded with xenon-136 ions:

: + → * → no atoms

No atoms were detected and a yield limit of 5 nb (5,000 pb) was measured. Current results (see flerovium) have shown that the sensitivity of these experiments were too low by at least 3 orders of magnitude. In particular, the reaction between 170Er and 136Xe was expected to yield alpha emitters with half-lives of microseconds that would decay down to isotopes of flerovium with half-lives perhaps increasing up to several hours, as flerovium is predicted to lie near the center of the island of stability. After twelve hours of irradiation, nothing was found in this reaction. Following a similar unsuccessful attempt to synthesize unbiunium from 238U and 65Cu, it was concluded that half-lives of superheavy nuclei must be less than one microsecond or the cross sections are very small. More recent research into synthesis of superheavy elements suggests that both conclusions are true.

In 2000, the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research performed a very similar experiment with much higher sensitivity:

: + → * → no atoms

These results indicate that the synthesis of such heavier elements remains a significant challenge and further improvements of beam intensity and experimental efficiency is required. The sensitivity should be increased to 1 fb in the future for more quality results.

====Compound nucleus fission====
Several experiments studying the fission characteristics of various superheavy compound nuclei such as 306Ubb were performed between 2000 and 2004 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions. Two nuclear reactions were used, namely 248Cm + 58Fe and 242Pu + 64Ni. The results reveal how superheavy nuclei fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (&quot;Z&quot; = 50, &quot;N&quot; = 82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, suggesting a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.

===Claimed discovery as a naturally occurring element===
In 2008, a group led by Israeli physicist Amnon Marinov at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem claimed to have found single atoms of unbibium-292 in naturally occurring thorium deposits at an abundance of between 10−11 and 10−12 relative to thorium. This was the first time in 69 years that a new element had been claimed to be discovered in nature, after Marguerite Perey&#x27;s 1939 discovery of francium. The claim of Marinov &quot;et al.&quot; was criticized by the scientific community, and Marinov says he has submitted the article to the journals &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Nature Physics&quot; but both turned it down without sending it for peer review. The unbibium-292 atoms were claimed to be superdeformed or hyperdeformed isomers, with a half-life of at least 100 million years.

A criticism of the technique, previously used in purportedly identifying lighter thorium isotopes by mass spectrometry, was published in &quot;Physical Review C&quot; in 2008. A rebuttal by the Marinov group was published in &quot;Physical Review C&quot; after the published comment.

A repeat of the thorium experiment using the superior method of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) failed to confirm the results, despite a 100-fold better sensitivity. This result throws considerable doubt on the results of the Marinov collaboration with regards to their claims of long-lived isotopes of thorium, roentgenium, and unbibium. Current understanding of superheavy elements indicates that it is very unlikely for any traces of unbibium to persist in natural thorium samples.

===Naming===
Using Mendeleev&#x27;s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, unbibium should instead be known as &quot;eka-thorium&quot;. After the recommendations of the IUPAC in 1979, the element has since been largely referred to as &quot;unbibium&quot; with the atomic symbol of (&quot;Ubb&quot;), as its temporary name until the element is officially discovered and synthesized, and a permanent name is decided on. Scientists largely ignore this naming convention, and instead simply refer to unbibium as &quot;element 122&quot; with the symbol of (&quot;122&quot;), or sometimes even &quot;E122&quot; or &quot;122&quot;.

==Prospects for future synthesis==
Every element from mendelevium onward was produced in fusion-evaporation reactions, culminating in the discovery of the heaviest known element oganesson in 2002 and most recently tennessine in 2010. These reactions approached the limit of current technology; for example, the synthesis of tennessine required 22 milligrams of 249Bk and an intense 48Ca beam for six months. The intensity of beams in superheavy element research cannot exceed 1012 projectiles per second without damaging the target and detector, and producing larger quantities of increasingly rare and unstable actinide targets is impractical.
Consequently, future experiments must be done at facilities such as the superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) or RIKEN, which will allow experiments to run for longer stretches of time with increased detection capabilities and enable otherwise inaccessible reactions.

It is possible that fusion-evaporation reactions will not be suitable for the discovery of unbibium or heavier elements. Various models predict increasingly short alpha and spontaneous fission half-lives for isotopes with &quot;Z&quot; = 122 and &quot;N&quot; ~ 180 on the order of microseconds or less, rendering detection nearly impossible with current equipment. The increasing dominance of spontaneous fission also may sever possible ties to known nuclei of livermorium or oganesson and make identification and confirmation more difficult; a similar problem occurred in the road to confirmation of the decay chain of 294Og which has no anchor to known nuclei. For these reasons, other methods of production may need to be researched such as multi-nucleon transfer reactions capable of populating longer-lived nuclei. A similar switch in experimental technique occurred when hot fusion using 48Ca projectiles was used instead of cold fusion (in which cross sections decrease rapidly with increasing atomic number) to populate elements with &quot;Z&quot; &gt; 113.

Nevertheless, several fusion-evaporation reactions leading to unbibium have been proposed in addition to those already tried unsuccessfully, though no institution has immediate plans to make synthesis attempts, instead focusing first on elements 119, 120, and possibly 121. Because cross sections increase with asymmetry of the reaction, a chromium beam would be most favorable in combination with a californium target, especially if the predicted closed neutron shell at &quot;N&quot; = 184 could be reached in more neutron-rich products and confer additional stability. In particular, the reaction between and would generate the compound nucleus and reach the shell at &quot;N&quot; = 184, though the analogous reaction with a target is believed to be more feasible because of the presence of unwanted fission products from and difficulty in accumulating the required amount of target material. One possible synthesis of unbibium could occur as follows:

: + → + 3 

Should this reaction be successful and alpha decay remain dominant over spontaneous fission, the resultant 300Ubb would decay through 296Ubn which may be populated in cross-bombardment between 249Cf and 50Ti. Although this reaction is one of the most promising options for the synthesis of unbibium in the near future, the maximum cross section is predicted to be 3 fb, one order of magnitude lower than the lowest measured cross section in a successful reaction. The more symmetrical reactions 244Pu + 64Ni and 248Cm + 58Fe have also been proposed and may produce more neutron-rich isotopes. With increasing atomic number, one must also be aware of decreasing fission barrier heights, resulting in lower survival probability of compound nuclei, especially above the predicted magic numbers at &quot;Z&quot; = 126 and &quot;N&quot; = 184.

==Predicted properties==
===Nuclear stability and isotopes===

The stability of nuclei decreases greatly with the increase in atomic number after plutonium, the heaviest primordial element, so that all isotopes with an atomic number above 101 decay radioactively with a half-life under a day. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after lead) have stable isotopes. Nevertheless, because of reasons not very well understood yet, there is a slight increased nuclear stability around atomic numbers 110–114, which leads to the appearance of what is known in nuclear physics as the &quot;island of stability&quot;. This concept, proposed by University of California professor Glenn Seaborg, explains why superheavy elements last longer than predicted.

In this region of the periodic table, &quot;N&quot; = 184 has been suggested as a closed neutron shell, and various atomic numbers have been proposed as closed proton shells, such as &quot;Z&quot; = 114, 120, 122, 124, and 126. The island of stability would be characterized by longer half-lives of nuclei located near these magic numbers, though the extent of stabilizing effects is uncertain due to predictions of weakening of the proton shell closures and possible loss of double magicity. More recent research predicts the island of stability to instead be centered at beta-stable copernicium isotopes 291Cn and 293Cn, which would place unbibium well above the island and result in short half-lives regardless of shell effects. The increased stability of elements 112–118 has also been attributed to the oblate shape of such nuclei and resistance to spontaneous fission. The same model also proposes 306Ubb as the next spherical doubly magic nucleus, thus defining the true island of stability for spherical nuclei.

A quantum tunneling model predicts the alpha-decay half-lives of unbibium isotopes 284–322Ubb to be on the order of microseconds or less for all isotopes lighter than 315Ubb, highlighting a significant challenge in experimental observation of this element. This is consistent with many predictions, though the exact location of the 1 microsecond border varies by model. Additionally, spontaneous fission is expected to become a major decay mode in this region, with half-lives on the order of femtoseconds predicted for some even–even isotopes due to minimal hindrance resulting from nucleon pairing and loss of stabilizing effects farther away from magic numbers. A 2016 calculation on the half-lives and probable decay chains of isotopes 280–339Ubb yields corroborating results: 280–297Ubb will be proton unbound and possibly decay by proton emission, 298–314Ubb will have alpha half-lives on the order of microseconds, and those heavier than 314Ubb will predominantly decay by spontaneous fission with short half-lives. For the lighter alpha emitters that may be populated in fusion-evaporation reactions, some long decay chains leading down to known or reachable isotopes of lighter elements are predicted. Additionally, the isotopes 308–310Ubb are predicted to have half-lives under 1 microsecond, too short for detection as a result of significantly lower binding energy for neutron numbers immediately above the &quot;N&quot; = 184 shell closure. Alternatively, a second island of stability with total half-lives of approximately 1 second may exist around &quot;Z&quot; ~ 124 and &quot;N&quot; ~ 198, though these nuclei will be difficult or impossible to reach using current experimental techniques. However, these predictions are strongly dependent on the chosen nuclear mass models, and it is unknown which isotopes of unbibium will be most stable. Regardless, these nuclei will be hard to synthesize as no combination of obtainable target and projectile can provide enough neutrons in the compound nucleus. Even for nuclei reachable in fusion reactions, spontaneous fission and possibly also cluster decay might have significant branches, posing another hurdle to identification of superheavy elements as they are normally identified by their successive alpha decays.

===Chemical===
Unbibium is predicted to be similar in chemistry to cerium and thorium, which likewise have four valence electrons above a noble gas core, although it may be more reactive. Additionally, unbibium is predicted to belong to a new block of valence g-electron atoms, although the 5g orbital is not expected to start filling until about element 125. The predicted ground-state electron configuration of unbibium is either Og] 7d1 8s2 8p1 or 8s2 8p2, in contrast to the expected Og] 5g2 8s2 in which the 5g orbital starts filling at element 121. (The ds2p and s2p2 configurations are expected to be only separated by about 0.02 eV.) In the superactinides, relativistic effects might cause a breakdown of the Aufbau principle and create overlapping of the 5g, 6f, 7d and 8p orbitals; experiments on the chemistry of copernicium and flerovium provide strong indications of the increasing role of relativistic effects. As such, the chemistry of elements following unbibium becomes more difficult to predict.

Unbibium would most likely form a dioxide, UbbO2, and tetrahalides, such as UbbF4 and UbbCl4. The main oxidation state is predicted to be +4, similar to cerium and thorium. A first ionization energy of 5.651 eV and second ionization energy of 11.332 eV are predicted for unbibium; this and other calculated ionization energies are lower than the analogous values for thorium, suggesting that unbibium will be more reactive than thorium.

<text>Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein is a 1994 science fiction horror film directed by Kenneth Branagh who also stars as Victor Frankenstein, with Robert De Niro portraying Frankenstein&#x27;s monster (called The Creation in the film), and co-stars Tom Hulce, Helena Bonham Carter, Ian Holm, John Cleese, Richard Briers and Aidan Quinn. Considered the most faithful film adaptation, in some respects, of Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot;, despite several differences and additions, the film follows a medical student named Victor Frankenstein who creates new life in the form of a monster composed of various corpses&#x27; body parts.

&quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; premiered at the London Film Festival, and was released theatrically on November 4, 1994, by TriStar Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $112 million worldwide on a budget of $45 million, making it less successful than the previous Francis Ford Coppola-produced horror adaptation, &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992).

==Plot==
In 1794, Captain Walton leads an expedition to the North Pole. While their ship is trapped in ice, a frightening noise is heard and a cloaked man emerges from the mist, telling the crew to follow him with their weapons. The dogs run toward the noise but are killed by its source. Walton is determined to continue the expedition; the newcomer asks, &quot;Do you share my madness?&quot; He reveals his name is Victor Frankenstein and tells his life story, presented in flashback.

Victor grows up with his adopted sister, Elizabeth Lavenza. Victor&#x27;s mother dies giving birth to his brother William, and Victor vows on her grave to find a way to conquer death. Victor and his friend Henry Clerval study medicine at the University of Ingolstadt under professor Shmael Augustus Waldman, whose notes contain information on creating life. Waldman warns Victor not to use them lest he create an abomination.

Waldman is murdered by a patient who is then hanged. Using the killer&#x27;s body and Waldman&#x27;s brain, Victor builds a creature based on Waldman&#x27;s notes. He is so obsessed with his work that he drives Elizabeth off when she comes to take him away from Ingolstadt, which is being quarantined amid a cholera epidemic. Victor gives his creation life, but is horrified by the creature&#x27;s hideous appearance and tries to kill him. The creature steals Victor&#x27;s coat and flees, and is driven away by the townspeople when he tries to steal food.

The creature shelters for months in a family&#x27;s barn without their knowledge, learning to read and speak by watching them. He attempts to earn their trust by anonymously bringing them food, and eventually converses with the elderly, blind patriarch after murdering an abusive debt collector. When the man&#x27;s family returns, they are terrified and chase the creature away. The creature finds Victor&#x27;s journal and learns the circumstances of his creation. Upon returning to the farmhouse, he discovers the family has abandoned it. He burns down the farm and vows revenge on Victor for bringing him into a world that hates him.

Returning to Geneva to marry Elizabeth, Victor finds his younger brother William has been murdered. The Frankensteins&#x27; servant Justine is blamed and hanged, but Victor knows the creature is responsible. The creature abducts Victor and demands he make him a female companion, promising to leave Victor in peace in return. Victor gathers his tools, but when the creature insists that he use Justine&#x27;s body, Victor breaks his promise. The creature exacts his revenge on Victor&#x27;s wedding night by breaking into Elizabeth&#x27;s bridal suite and ripping out her heart.

Victor races home to bring Elizabeth back to life. He stitches her head and hands onto Justine&#x27;s body and reanimates her as a disfigured, mindless shadow of her former self. The creature demands Elizabeth as his bride. Victor and the creature fight, but Elizabeth, realizing what has been done to her, commits suicide by setting herself on fire. Victor and the creature escape as the mansion burns down.

Back in the Arctic, Victor tells Walton he has been pursuing his creation for months to kill him. Victor dies of pneumonia, and Walton discovers the creature weeping over Victor&#x27;s body, having lost the only family he has ever known. The crew prepares a funeral pyre, but the ceremony is interrupted when the ice around the ship cracks. Walton invites the creature onto the ship, but the creature chooses to remain with the pyre. He takes the torch and burns himself alive with Victor&#x27;s body. Walton orders the ship to return home.

==Production==
Steph Lady wrote the original script to the film that was sold to Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s American Zoetrope. Coppola originally intended to direct the film (having already directed &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992) but instead elected to just serve as executive producer. Coppola wanted Robert De Niro cast as the Creature above all else, which resulted in his casting over considerations of casting Gérard Depardieu and Andy García for the title role. He chose Branagh to direct the film; Branagh brought in Frank Darabont to do a second draft of the screenplay, insisting on including elements from the novel that had not been present in the script, complete with having as many &quot;explicitly sexual birth images&quot; to go along with elements inspired from Mary Shelley&#x27;s life in terms of her being &quot;surrounded by images of death&quot;. As opposed to the novel, the film includes a re-created bride due to Branagh believing that it seemed to &quot;make psychological sense&quot; while reflecting on his difference from James Whale in his staging for both of his Frankenstein films that he stated as having &quot;high camp&quot;.

Branagh stated in an interview that the film was &quot;a family tragedy, like Shakespeare. There are lots of echoes of &#x27;Hamlet&#x27; in it, I think. Victor Frankenstein is the opposite side of the same coin as Hamlet. Instead of forming a philosophy of death and our journey toward it, he resists it. He says, &#x27;Let&#x27;s stop them dying and see if we can do it better.&#x27; He replaces Hamlet&#x27;s intellectual pursuit with physical action. And still isn&#x27;t happy.&quot; De Niro studied stroke victims in preparation for the voice of the Creature.

==Release==
The film had its world premiere on November 3, 1994, at the London Film Festival before opening in the United Kingdom and United States on November 4.

==Reception==
===Frank Darabont===
Original screenwriter Steph Lady, who sold the script to Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s American Zoetrope, said &quot;the film was a shocking disappointment; a misshapen monster born of Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s runaway ego. He took a poignant, thought-provoking tragedy and turned it into a heavy metal monster movie. The casting of Robert De Niro as the monster was beyond inexplicable.&quot; Frank Darabont, who did a second draft, later called the film &quot;the best script I ever wrote and the worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. He elaborated:
There&#x27;s a weird doppelgänger effect when I watch the movie. It&#x27;s kind of like the movie I wrote, but not at all like the movie I wrote. It has no patience for subtlety. It has no patience for quiet moments. It has no patience period. It&#x27;s big and loud and blunt and rephrased by the director at every possible turn. Cumulatively, the effect was a totally different movie. I don&#x27;t know why Branagh needed to make this big, loud film ... the material was subtle. Shelley&#x27;s book was way out there in a lot of ways, but it&#x27;s also very subtle. I don&#x27;t know why it had to be this operatic attempt at filmmaking. Shelley&#x27;s book is not operatic, it whispers at you a lot. The movie was a bad one. That was my Waterloo. That&#x27;s where I really got my ass kicked most as a screenwriter ... [Branagh] really took the brunt of the blame for that film, which was appropriate. That movie was his vision entirely. If you love that movie you can throw all your roses at Ken Branagh&#x27;s feet. If you hated it, throw your spears there too, because that was his movie.

===Critical response===
Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, writing: &quot;I admired the scenes with De Niro [as the Creature] so much I&#x27;m tempted to give &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; a favorable verdict. But it&#x27;s a near miss. The Creature is on target, but the rest of the film is so frantic, so manic, it doesn&#x27;t pause to be sure its effects are registered&quot;.

Janet Maslin wrote: &quot;Branagh is in over his head. He displays neither the technical finesse to handle a big, visually ambitious film nor the insight to develop a stirring new version of this story. Instead, this is a bland, no-fault &quot;Frankenstein&quot; for the &#x27;90s, short on villainy but loaded with the tragically misunderstood. Even the Creature (Robert De Niro), an aesthetically challenged loner with a father who rejected him, would make a dandy guest on any daytime television talk show&quot;.

Conversely, James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net gave the film three out of four stars: &quot;&quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; may not be the definitive version of the 1818 novel, and the director likely attempted more than is practical for a two-hour film, but overambition is preferable to the alternative, especially if it results—as in this case—in something more substantial than Hollywood&#x27;s typical, fitfully entertaining fluff&quot;.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Box office===
&quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; collected $11,212,889 during its opening weekend, ranking in second place at the box office below &quot;Stargate&quot;. In the U.S. and Canada, the film grossed $22,006,296, with the opening weekend making up more than half of its total. The film opened the same day in the United Kingdom and Ireland and was the number one film with a gross of $2 million (£1.3 million) in its opening weekend from 320 screens. It remained at number one in the UK for a second week. Outside the U.S. and Canada, it grossed $90 million, bringing the worldwide gross to $112 million.

=== Year-end lists ===
* 3rd worst – Peter Travers, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;
* 9th worst – Janet Maslin, &quot;The New York Times&quot;

=== Accolades ===
==Video game==

A video game adaptation based on the film was released on numerous home video game consoles in 1994. A themed pinball machine was released in early 1995 by Sega Pinball; it is one of the machines included in the video pinball simulator &quot;The Pinball Arcade&quot;.

<text>The vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) is a transport protein integrated into the membranes of synaptic vesicles of presynaptic neurons. It transports monoamine neurotransmitters – such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and histamine – into the vesicles, which release the neurotransmitters into synapses, as chemical messages to postsynaptic neurons. VMATs utilize a proton gradient generated by V-ATPases in vesicle membranes to power monoamine import.

Pharmaceutical drugs that target VMATs have possible applications for many conditions, leading to a plethora of biological research, including hypertension, drug addiction, psychiatric disorders, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and other neurological disorders. Many drugs that target VMATs act as inhibitors and alter the kinetics of the protein. Much research regarding the effects of altered VMATs on biological systems is still ongoing.
==Monoamines==
Monoamines transported by VMATs are mainly noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, histamine, and trace amines. Exogenous substrates include guanethidine and MPP+.

==Discovery==
VMAT research began in 1958 when Nils-Åke Hillarp discovered secretory vesicles. In the 1970s, scientists like Arvid Carlsson recognized the need to understand how transport systems and ion gradients work in different organisms in order to explore new treatment options such as reserpine (RES). Researchers discovered inhibitors that blocked the uptake of neurotransmitters into vesicles, suggesting the existence of VMATs. A decade later, molecular genetic tools have improved methods for protein identification. Scientists have used these tools to analyze DNA and amino acid sequences, and discovered that transporters in bacteria and humans were very similar, which emphasized the importance and universality of transporters. The transporters were first structurally identified by cloning VMATs in rats. The VMAT were first isolated and purified in bovine chromaffin granules, in both its native and denatured forms.

==Location==
There are two types of VMATs expressed in humans: VMAT1 and VMAT2. VMAT1 is expressed mainly in large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) of the peripheral nervous system. VMAT1 may be found in neuroendocrine cells, particularly chromaffin and enterochromaffin granules, which are primarily found in the medulla of the adrenal glands.

VMAT2 favors expression in a variety of monoaminergic cells of the central nervous system, such as the brain, sympathetic nervous system, mast cells, It is prevalent in β-cells, expressed in blood platelets, and co-expressed in chromaffin cells. Expression of the two transporters in internal organs seems to differ between species: only VMAT1 is expressed in rat adrenal medulla cells, whereas VMAT2 is the major transporter in bovine adrenal medulla cells.

==Structure and function==

VMAT1 and VMAT2 are acidic glycoproteins with a molecular weight of approximately 70 kDa. Both isoforms are transmembrane proteins with 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs).

VMATs function by loading monoamines—dopamine, serotonin, histamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine—into transport vesicles. VMATs use the same transport mechanism for all types of monoamines, and transport them from the cytosol into high-concentration storage vesicles. Transport vesicles are released into the space between neurons, called the synaptic cleft, where they convey a chemical message to the next neuron. VMATs also function in sorting, storing, and releasing neurotransmitters, and are believed to participate in protecting these neurotransmitters from autoxidation. The transporters are also known to continue biochemical modification after loading certain neurotransmitters.

Vesicle packing requires a large energy source to store large quantities of neurotransmitters into a small vesicular space at high concentrations. VMAT transport relies on the pH and electrochemical gradient generated by a vesicular H+-ATPase. The current model of VMAT function proposes that the efflux of two protons (H+) against the H+ gradient is coupled with influx of one monoamine. The first H+ efflux generates a transporter conformation associated with a high-affinity amine-binding site in the cytosolic phase, and the second H+ efflux is coupled with a second large conformational change that leads to amine transport from the cytosolic side into the vesicle, reducing amine-binding affinity.

Studies indicate that the amino acid residue His419, located on the domain between TMDs X and XI of rat VMAT1, plays a role in energy coupling to the amine transport by assisting the first proton-dependent conformational change. It has been proposed that RES inhibits VMAT by interacting with this conformation.

VMAT gene sequence analysis demonstrates that four aspartic acid residues in the middle region of TMDs I, VI, X, and XI and one lysine residue in TMD II have highly conserved gene sequences, suggesting these residues play a critical role in transporter structure and function. Specifically, the residues Lys139 and Asp427 are thought to compose an ion pair that promotes high-affinity interaction with VMAT substrates and inhibitors. The Asp431 residue located in TMD XI is believed to be critical for amine transport, but does not interact with RES binding; it is thought to complete the substrate transport cycle.

==Kinetics==
VMATs have a relatively low Vmax, with an estimated rate of 5–20/sec depending on the substrate. Vesicle filling may limit monoamine release from neurons with high rates of firing.

Specific amine-binding affinity varies by VMAT isoform; studies indicate that catecholamines dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine have a threefold higher affinity for VMAT2 than VMAT1 binding and uptake. The imidazoleamine histamine has a thirtyfold higher affinity for VMAT2 compared to VMAT1, and is thought to bind to a different site than other monoamines. Unlike catecholamines and histamine, the indoleamine serotonin binds to VMAT1 and VMAT2 with a similar affinity for both transporter isoforms.

VMAT1 has a lower turnover number and a lower affinity for most monoamine substrates than VMAT2, which may be because of VMAT2&#x27;s location in the central nervous system, which demands fast recovery from neurotransmitter release in order to prepare for subsequent releases. The uptake efficiencies of each VMAT substrate can be ranked in order of efficiency as: serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.

Methamphetamines decrease Vmax, while cocaine increases Vmax reversibly in rat brain.

==Inhibition==
The effects of VMAT inhibition have been studied in-depth in animal models. Mutant homozygous VMAT(-/-) mice move little, feed poorly, and die within a few days of birth.

More specifically, inhibition of VMAT2 may cause an increase in cytosolic catecholamine levels, which can result in an increase in efflux of catecholamines through the cell membrane, depleting catecholamine concentrations and causing increased oxidative stress and oxidative damage to the neuron.

Heterozygous VMAT mutants display hypersensitivity to amphetamine, cocaine, and MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), the latter being a substance causally linked to Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD) in rodents. This suggests a protective role of VMATs against oxidative stress through removal of such substances from the cytosol.

VMAT inhibitors include:
*Reserpine (RES), bietaserpine, and ketanserin (KET) (potent inhibitors of VMAT2 mediated serotonin transport)
*Tetrabenazine (TBZ) (specific to VMAT2)
*Phenylethylamine
*Amphetamine
*MDMA
*&quot;N&quot;-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) (very potent inhibitors of VMAT2 mediated serotonin transport)
*Fenfluramine (specific to VMAT1 )
*Non-hydrolysable GTP-analogue guanylyllimidodiphosphate GMP-P(NH)P (VMAT2 only)

==Binding site structures==
===Ligand-binding affinities and structures===
Two known binding sites for VMAT inhibitors include the RES binding site and the TBZ binding site. Some evidence suggests these two sites may overlap or exist as two separate conformations of the same binding site. VMAT inhibitors tend to fall into two classes: those that interact with the RES binding site and those that interact with the TBZ binding site.

RES, methoxytetrabenazine (MTBZ), and the drug amiodarone bind to the RES binding site. TBZ (also called Nitoman and Xenazine), dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZOH), ketanserin (KET), and the drug lobeline bind to the TBZ binding site. Amphetamine, methamphetamine and GZ-7931 are also known to interact with VMAT2.

Inhibitor affinity varies among VMAT isoforms. RES and KET have higher inhibitory affinity for VMAT2–mediated 5HT transport than for that of VMAT1; TBZ seems to inhibit VMAT2 exclusively.

The residues asp33 and ser180, 181, and 182 are believed to be involved in substrate recognition, and interact with the protonated amino group and hydroxyl group on the catechol or indole rings.

Cocaine and methylphenidate (MPD, also known as Ritalin and Concerta) are believed to interact with VMAT2 to cause a shift in VMAT2 &quot;from a plasmalemmal membrane-associated fraction to a vesicle-enriched, nonmembrane-associated fraction.&quot;

====RES binding site====
Consistent with catecholamine-binding affinity, RES has a threefold higher affinity for VMAT2 than for VMAT1. The RES binding site is known to be hydrophobic, which is thought to contribute to ligand binding affinity. Methamphetamine binds to the RES site on VMATs.

The current working model proposes that RES and the substrate bind to a single site in a pH-gradient modulated conformational structure of the transporter. The conformation occurs after the transport of one H+ across the membrane and into the vesicle; proton transport drives the substrate recognition site from the lumen to the cytoplasmic surface of the vesicle for RES and substrate binding. Methoxytetrabenazine (MTBZ) may bind to the RES binding site, based on studies indicating that RES significantly inhibited MTBZ-binding. Amiodarone is also believed to inhibit monoamine vesicular uptake by binding to the RES binding site.

====TBZ binding site====
TBZ and dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZOH) are believed to bind to a different binding site from the RES/substrate binding site, or to a different conformation of the RES/substrate binding site. This site is believed to be located at the N-terminus, based on studies done in bovine VMAT2. Tyr434 and asp461 are identified as being responsible for the high-affinity interaction of TBZ, serotonin, and histamine in VMAT2. Unlike methamphetamine, amphetamine binds to the TBZ site on hVMAT2.

Unlike RES inhibition, TBZ inhibition is only affected by very high concentrations of monoamines; however, single injections of RES can inhibit TBZ binding. ketanserin (KET) and lobeline also bind to the TBZ binding site conformation.

===Glycosylation sites: N- and C-linked terminals===
Three to four glycosylation sites exist in the vesicular matrix on a loop between TMD I and TMD II. In biology, the vesicle matrix refers to the material or tissue between cells in which more specialized structures are embedded. Two of the glycosylation sites, the &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation terminal and &quot;C&quot;-linked terminal, are located in the cytosolic portion of the vesicle.

The highest amount of genetic variance between VMAT1 and VMAT2 exists near the N- and C- terminals in the cytosolic phase, and in the glycosylated loop between TMDs I and II.

===C-terminus and VMAT trafficking cycle===
Several motifs involved in the VMAT trafficking cycle are believed to be encoded in the C-terminus. A dileucine motif in the C-terminus is required for VMAT2 endocytosis. Studies suggest the acidic residues in the dileucine motif sort VMAT2 away from constitutive secretory vesicles and into the regulated secretory pathway. The hydrophobic residues in the dileucine motif are thought to couple with the acidic residues as a single unit to help sort VMAT2 to large dense course vesicles. Acidic glutamate residues located upstream of the dileucine motif are known to be important for localization of VMAT2 to large dense core vesicles; these residues are also conserved in VMAT1.

==Genetic expression and transporter regulation==
Although both VMAT1 and VMAT2 are encoded by two different genes, the individual genetic sequences demonstrate high homology. Polymorphisms in VMAT2 that affect regulation and quantitative expression may pose genetic risk factors for PD. A specific VMAT1 gene (&quot;SLC18A1&quot;) has several associated polymorphisms, which have a locus 8p21.3 that has been strongly connected to schizophrenia susceptibility.

Over-expression of VMAT2 results in increased secretion of neurotransmitter upon cell stimulation. Data suggests that deletion of the VMAT2 genes does not affect the size of small clear-core vesicles.

VMATs may be regulated by changes in transcription, post-transcriptional modifications such as phosphorylation and mRNA splicing of exons, and vesicular transport inactivation facilitated by heterotrimeric G-proteins, which are thought to be possessed by chromaffin granules, and have shown to regulate small clear-core vesicles.

Specific heterotrimeric G-protein type regulation is tissue-dependent for VMAT2; it is not known whether this is the case for VMAT1. Heterotrimeric G-protein Gαo2 decreases VMAT1 activity in pancreatic and adrenal medulla cells, and activates heterotrimeric G-proteins to inhibit VMAT2 activity in the brain, regardless of whether they are localized on small clear-core or large-dense-core vesicles. The activated heterotrimeric G-protein Gαq downregulates VMAT2-mediated serotonin transport in blood platelets, but not in the brain, where Gαq completely inhibits VMAT2 activity. Although the exact signalling pathway for G-protein mediated regulation of VMATs is not known, it has recently been described that implicated G-proteins act directly on the VMATs.

==Clinical significance==
VMAT2 has been shown to contribute to many clinical neurological disorders including drug addiction, mood disorders, and stress, as well as Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===
Studies indicate VMAT2 mRNA is present in all cell groups damaged by Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD); these findings have identified VMAT2 as a target for preventing Parkinson&#x27;s. VMAT2 presence does not independently protect neurons from PD, but a decrease in VMAT2 expression has been shown to correlate with susceptibility to the disease, which may be due to a ratio between the dopamine transporter and VMAT2.

Based on the understanding the increased cytosolic dopamine levels lead to dopaminergic cell death in PD, it has been proposed that regulatory polymorphisms in VMAT2 affect VMAT2 quantitative expression, and may serve as a genetic risk factor for PD. Specifically, the SLC18A2 promoter region for the VMAT2 gene has been identified as an area where several polymorphisms form discrete haplotypes.

===Mood disorders===
Studies using a genetic rodent model to understand clinical depression in humans suggest that VMAT2 genetic or functional alterations may be involved in depression. Reduced VMAT2 levels were identified in specific subregions of the striatum involved in clinical depression, including the nucleus accumbens shell but not the core, the ventral tegmental area, and the substantia nigra&#x27;s pars compacta. The reduced VMAT2 protein levels were not accompanied by similar levels of VMAT2 mRNA alterations. Based on these findings, it has been proposed that VMAT2 activity is not altered at the level of genetic expression, but may be altered at the functional level in ways that may correlate with clinical depression.

===Drug addiction===
Many psychostimulant drugs are known to interact with VMAT, including amphetamine analogs such as methamphetamine, cocaine, and ecstasy (MDMA).

==Pharmacology==
VMAT inhibitors tend to fall into two classes; those that interact with the RES binding site and those that interact with the TBZ binding site.

RES, methoxytetrabenazine, and amiodarone bind to the RES binding site.

TBZ, DTBZOH, ketanserin, and lobeline bind to the TBZ binding site.

Many psychostimulants, including substituted amphetamines and cocaine, are known to interact with VMAT2. Studies indicate that both amphetamines and cocaine act to increase non-exocytotic release of dopamine in specific regions of the brain by interacting directly with VMAT2 function.

===Methamphetamine===
VMAT is a main target of methamphetamine. Studies indicate that substituted amphetamines including methamphetamine interact with VMAT2 at the TBZ/DTBZOH binding site. By acting as a negative allosteric modulator, methamphetamine blocks the presynaptic cell&#x27;s ability to use VMAT for vesicular packaging.

Methamphetamine alters the subcellular location of VMAT2, which affects the distribution of dopamine in the cell. Treatment with methamphetamine relocates VMAT2 from a vesicle-enriched fraction to a location that is not continuous with synaptosomal preparations.

Repeated amphetamine exposure may increase VMAT2 mRNA in certain brain regions with little or no decline upon withdrawal from the drug.

A study performed by Sonsalla &quot;et al.&quot; demonstrated that methamphetamine treatment decreases DHTBZ binding and vesicular dopamine uptake. Another study demonstrated that multiple high doses of methamphetamine removed DTBZ binding sites from the vesicles.

In addition to an interaction with the TBZ/DTBZOH binding site, some researchers propose that substituted amphetamines like methamphetamine decrease dopamine uptake because of the weak base properties of substituted amphetamines. This “Weak Base Hypothesis” proposes that amphetamine analogs enter the cell through transport and lipophilic diffusion, then diffuses through the vesicular membrane where they accumulate in synaptic vesicles and offset the proton electrochemical gradient in the vesicle that drives monoamine transport through VMAT. Amphetamine administration would prevent vesicular dopamine uptake through VMAT, and explain the finding that amphetamine administration correlates with decreased dopamine release from vesicles and a neurotoxic increase in intracellular dopamine.

===Cocaine===
Unlike methamphetamine, cocaine interacts with VMAT2 by mobilizing VMAT2-expressing vesicles, causing a shift in VMAT2 proteins from a plasmalemmal (synaptosomal) membrane fraction to a vesicle-enriched fraction that is not associated with the synaptosomal membrane and not retained in synaptosomal preparations. Methylphenidate is believed to interact with VMAT2 in a similar fashion.

In addition to mobilizing VMAT2-expressing vesicles, cocaine has been shown to increase the Vmax of VMAT2 for dopamine and increase the number of DTBZ binding sites. It has also mobilized a synapsin-dependent reserve pool of dopamine-containing synaptic vesicles, which interacts with the vesicular trafficking cycle to increase dopamine release.

Short-term exposure to cocaine increases VMAT2 density in the prefrontal cortex and striatum of mammalian brains. This is theorized to be a defensive mechanism against the depletive effects cocaine has on cytosolic dopamine through increasing monoamine storage capacity. Chronic cocaine use has been implicated with a reduction in VMAT2 immunoreactivity as well as a decrease in DTBZOH binding in humans.

Research suggests a decline in VMAT2 protein through prolonged cocaine use could play an important role in the development of cocaine-induced mood disorders.

===MDMA===
MDMA is known to affect serotonergic neurons, but has been shown to inhibit synaptosomal and vesicular uptake of serotonin and dopamine to roughly the same extent &quot;in vitro&quot;. &quot;In vivo&quot; studies indicate short-term MDMA exposure causes short-term reduction in VMAT2 activity, which is reversed after 24 hours.

==Current research==
===Clinical research===
Genetic research models have shown that polymorphisms in &quot;SLC18A1&quot; and &quot;SLC18A2&quot;, the genes that encode for VMAT1 and 2 proteins, respectively, may confer risk for some neuropsychiatric disorders; however, no specific diseases have been identified yet as directly resulting from a genetic mutation in an &quot;SLC18&quot; gene, which codes for VMAT proteins.

Much of the current research related to VMAT explores the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders as they may be affected by &quot;SLC18A&quot; family mutations.

The dopaminergic neuron is known to play a central role in drug addiction and abuse and the potential role of the dopamine transporter has been well-explored as a target for amphetamine and cocaine. Current research looks toward VMAT2 as a target for such psychostimulants. A combination of imaging, neurochemical, biochemical, cell biological, genetic, and immunohistochemical evidence has been compiled to provide the most current comprehensive understanding of the role the VMAT2 plays in amphetamine and cocaine abuse and addiction through aminergic neurotransmission.

As VMATs are membrane proteins, structural information is limited and researchers have yet to completely understand the structure of both isoforms. Further studies are needed in order to determine the structure and therefore complete function of these proteins. There is preliminary evidence that the gene for VMAT1 may be linked to susceptibility to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and various anxiety disorders. Further studies are needed in order to confirm these findings and to gain a better understanding of the role of VMATs in the central nervous system.

Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the coding region of VMATs. The effects of some of these SNPs have been alteration of VMAT function, structure and regulation. Further investigation of these SNPs is required in order to distinguish whether they may be attributable to certain diseases with suspected SNP-mutation origins.

α-synuclein, a cytosolic protein found mainly in pre-synaptic nerve terminals, has been found to have regulatory interactions with the trafficking of VMATs; mutations involving α-synuclein have been linked to familial PD. Further research is needed to clarify the extent to which these proteins modulate the trafficking of VMATs, and whether they may be exploited in order to gather more information about the exact mechanism of how disorders such as PD occurs, and how they may potentially be treated.

Studies have shown that at the synaptic membrane, enzymes responsible for the synthesis of dopamine, tyrosine hydroxylase and amino acid aromatic decarboxylase are physically and functionally coupled with VMAT2. It was initially thought that the synthesis of these substances and the subsequent packaging of them into vesicles were two entirely separate processes.

===Animal research===
Current research related to VMAT uses VMAT2 knockout mice to explore the behavioral genetics of this transporter in an animal model. VMAT2 knockouts are known to be lethal as homozygotes, but heterozygote knockouts are not lethal and are used in many studies as a durable animal model.

From knockout and knockdown mice, researchers have discovered that it is good to have over-expression or under-expression of the VMAT genes in some circumstances. Mice are also used in drug studies, particularity studies involving the effect cocaine and methamphetamine have on VMATs. Studies involving animals have prompted scientists to work on developing drugs that inhibit or enhance the function of VMATs. Drugs that inhibit VMATs may have use in addiction but further studies are needed. Enhancing the function of VMATs may also have therapeutic value.

<doc id="1246414" wikidata="Q7300594" url="?curid=1246414" title="Reading for special needs">
<text>Reading for special needs has become an area of interest as the understanding of reading has improved. Teaching children with special needs how to read was not historically pursued under the assumption of the reading readiness model that a reader must learn to read in a hierarchical manner such that one skill must be mastered before learning the next skill (e.g. a child might be expected to learn the names of the letters in the alphabet in the correct order before being taught how to read his or her name). This approach often led to teaching sub-skills of reading in a decontextualized manner, preventing students with special needs from progressing to more advanced literacy lessons and subjecting them to repeated age-inappropriate instruction (e.g. singing the alphabet song).

During the 1970s, the education system shifted to targeting functional skills that were age-appropriate for people with special needs. This led to teaching sight words that were viewed as necessary for participation in the school and community (e.g. &quot;exit&quot;, &quot;danger&quot;, &quot;poison&quot;, &quot;go&quot;). This approach was an improvement upon previous practices, but it limited the range of literacy skills that people with special needs developed.

A newer model for reading development, the &quot;emergent literacy&quot; or &quot;early literacy&quot; model, purports that children begin reading from birth and that learning to read is an interactive process based on children&#x27;s exposure to literate activities. It is under this new model that children with developmental disabilities and special needs have been considered to be able to learn to read.

==Populations at increased risk==
Children with language difficulties that fall below expectations for their chronological age are at increased risk for reading disorders or difficulties that can occur early in preschool and continue throughout development. Children with other disabilities, such as developmental disability, autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and cerebral palsy, can also have language impairments that raise the risk of developing reading problems.

===Down syndrome===
It has been found true for children with intellectual disabilities, such as children with Down syndrome, that phonological awareness skills are often deficient and require targeted teaching. For example, studies have found that children with Down syndrome show deficits in phonological awareness, and though they can develop such skills, often rely on sight word vocabulary knowledge rather than phonological awareness skills to decode words. Given this, it is recommended that phonological awareness skills be taught in a systematic manner with explicit instruction of how to use these skills when reading.

===Autism===
Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been identified as having particular difficulties with reading comprehension despite normal decoding abilities. Historically, those individuals who are especially good at decoding but have poor comprehension are considered to have hyperlexia. Not all individuals with autism, however, are poor comprehenders as there is a wide range of abilities in children on the spectrum. Despite the type of reader an individual with autism might be, individuals should be given the opportunity to learn to read.
Very few studies have examined the effectiveness of interventions for reading for individuals with ASD.
Using computer-assisted instruction to implement programs for individuals with ASD that target skills in decoding could be an effective way to help improve these skills in these individuals. Procedural facilitation tasks such as prereading questions, anaphoric cuing, or a cloze task helped to improve reading comprehension with the anaphoric cuing task being the most effective task.

===Cerebral palsy===
Children with cerebral palsy (CP) may or may not have motor speech impairments and/or language impairments, which can lead to reading difficulties. Often children with CP can be classified as having severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI), but children with other disorders can fall into this category as well. Children with SSPI can be at increased risk for reading difficulties not only because they may have language impairments, but also because they can have limited literary experiences and limited reading instruction. Additionally, parents and teachers may have low expectations of the child&#x27;s ability to become a reader, which may influence experiences with text and impact literacy instruction. Assistive technology (also Alternative and Augmentative Communication devices; AAC) can be used to overcome physical barriers to manipulating books, and to augment speech motor and language difficulties (e.g., type, or select symbols to identify rhyming words), and cognitive impairments (to provide needed support required for target skill acquisition) (Copeland &amp; Keef, 2007, see chapter 9). Of course, access to assistive devices is not sufficient for reading development. Appropriate reading instruction is required (e.g., instruction in phonological awareness skills, phonemic awareness skills, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, text comprehension, and book conventions), regularly conducted story reading sessions, constructive AT/AAC use to target literacy skills, high expectations of student literacy achievement, and text-rich environments have been found to be important for developing literacy skills in children with CP.

==Interventions==

Classroom teachers are expected to provide the primary source of reading instruction for most students. Special education teachers may supplement the classroom instruction in reading and writing skills based on the independent performance of their students. Other professionals including a reading specialist, a speech-language pathologist, an educational or school psychologist, and an occupational therapist may also provide reading and writing support to individuals with reading and writing difficulties.

People with severe speech difficulties can use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. AAC proponents insist that AAC enables such individuals to express needs, wants, and ideas. Evidence indicates that few AAC users are able to progress to a second grade literacy level and many do not become conventionally &quot;literate&quot; at all.

<doc id="1246418" wikidata="Q864545" url="?curid=1246418" title="Donald M. Fraser">
<text>Donald MacKay Fraser (February 20, 1924 – June 2, 2019) was an American politician from Minnesota who served as U.S. Representative from Minnesota&#x27;s 5th congressional district from 1963 to 1979 and as mayor of Minneapolis from 1980 to 1994.

==Early life==

Fraser was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Everett and Lois (McKay) Fraser, immigrants from Canada. His father studied law at Harvard University, began teaching at George Washington University and became dean of the University of Minnesota Law School in 1920. Fraser graduated from University High School in 1941 and that year, he entered the University of Minnesota. During college, he was a member of the varsity swimming team.

Having joined the US Navy ROTC, he was placed on active duty in July 1942 and continued his naval studies on campus until February 1944, when he was commissioned an officer and sent to the Pacific Theater during World War II. Fraser worked as a radar officer into the peacetime that followed, ending in 1946. In June 1946 Fraser returned to Minneapolis to study law at the University of Minnesota Law School.

Fraser served as a member of the &quot;Minnesota Law Review&quot; and wrote a law review article on the illegality of racial covenants for land, a position supported by the United States Supreme Court in 1948. Fraser earned his law degree and was admitted to the bar, the same year. He joined the politically active firm of Larson, Loevinger, Lindquist, Freeman, and Fraser. Fraser engaged in general law practice and served as municipal attorney for the suburban community of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. He married Arvonne Skelton in 1950 and the following year, they had the first of their six children: Thomas, Mary, John, Lois, Anne, and Jean.

==Political career==

In 1954, Fraser was elected to the Minnesota Senate and served for eight years. In 1962, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Minnesota&#x27;s Fifth District. He served there in the 88th through the 95th Congresses, from January 3, 1963 until January 3, 1979. Fraser is now best known for his work as the chair of the International Organizations and Movements subcommittee, a post he used to hold hearings on human rights violations in U.S. allies. As the historian Barbara Keys has shown, from 1973 to 1976, Fraser was a key leader in Congress in drafting legislation to reduce U.S. aid to countries whose governments engaged in a pattern of &quot;gross violations of human rights.&quot; His efforts laid the foundations for much of Jimmy Carter&#x27;s human rights agenda and transformed the way the U.S. Department of State operates, mandating that it write annual country reports on human rights and ensuring that diplomatic posts take note of human rights issues. In 1978, following the death of incumbent U.S. senator Hubert Humphrey, Fraser chose to run in the special election for Humphrey&#x27;s old senate seat instead of running for re-election to the house. Fraser received the endorsement of the DFL but was narrowly defeated by the more conservative businessman Bob Short. Short went on to lose the general election to attorney David Durenberger.

Fraser served as president of Americans for Democratic Action from 1974 to 1976. He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1979, taking office on January 2, 1980. His first mayoral term was two years; he was re-elected to three four-year terms. He was the oldest, longest-lived and longest-serving mayor in Minneapolis history. He left office on January 3, 1994, and was succeeded by the city&#x27;s first female and first African-American mayor, Sharon Sayles Belton.

Fraser died on June 2, 2019, at age 95.

==Papers==
His papers are available for research. The collection is particularly strong in its documentation of international relations, Democratic Party policy and reform, human rights issues, environmental conservation, and women&#x27;s issues, in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Endorsement of United Nations Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA)==
On April 23, 2014, Fraser endorsed the proposal for the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly. He is one of only six people who served in Congress to do so.

<text>BASIC 8 (or BASIC 8.0) &quot;The Enhanced Graphics System For The C128&quot; was an American-designed graphics system developed by Walrusoft of Gainesville, Florida and published in 1986 by Patech Software of Somerset, New Jersey. The system was an extension of Commodore&#x27;s BASIC 7.0 for the Commodore 128 computer. BASIC 8.0 provided commands lacking in BASIC 7.0 to generate (color) graphics in the C128&#x27;s high-resolution 80-column mode (640×200 pixels) for RGB monitors.

The BASIC 8 package was developed by Walrusoft&#x27;s Louis Wallace and David Darus, with contributions from Ken French (printer drivers) and indirectly from Richard Rylander (who allowed his 3D solids commands for the Commodore 64, originally published in &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;, to be converted to the C128&#x27;s hi-res mode).

==Background==
===The problem===
Unlike its competitors, such as the Apple II and Atari 8-bit computers, previous iterations of BASIC in Commodore&#x27;s computers lack commands for handling sound, graphics, and input devices. Instead they require awkward PEEK and POKE sequences, or machine language routines, in order to read from joysticks and paddles, and generate high-resolution graphics, sounds, and music.

The lack of sound and graphics commands in BASIC 2.0, used for the Commodore 64, led to the development of many third-party language extensions, such as Simons&#x27; BASIC, which were more accessible to non-expert users.

The Commodore 128 (C128) launched with BASIC 7.0 which contained several sound and graphics commands. However, these only worked in the &quot;40-column&quot; video mode, a TV or monitor mode with a resolution equal to the C64&#x27;s. Programming graphics for the C128&#x27;s new high-resolution &quot;80-column mode&quot;, primarily intended for RGBI monitors, was more challenging than it had been with the C64, due to the C128&#x27;s 8563 VDC graphics chip being more difficult to work with than the VIC-II.

===A solution===
BASIC 8.0, available via floppy disk or ROM, provided many graphics commands that were competitive with the C128&#x27;s competitors in the high-end 8-bit microcomputer market. BASIC 8.0 was fully compatible with the various first-party RAM and video RAM expansion chips and cartridges, as well as mice and joysticks. It also provided basic 3D graphics commands. Along with a 188-page manual, the software package included an example of a GUI, and a high-res paint program, Basic Paint, both developed using BASIC 8.0.

==Source code and copy protection==
Source code of some of the BASIC 8 package was provided, and the BASIC 8.0 disk lacked any sort of copy protection, but this was before the Open Source Initiative; it was done as a courtesy. Instead of threatening legal action, Walrusoft simply asked users not to copy the software in the documentation. It worked; BASIC 8.0 became one of the best selling expansions for the C128.

==Sample commands==
In BASIC 8.0, all added commands were prefaced with the @ mark, which was not normally used in Commodore BASIC, to distinguish between the original and the new keywords. The use of this character would allow the developer to extend BASIC 7.0 without having to re-tokenize the commands as it was done on the C64. It was accomplished by trapping the syntax error generated by the command.
* codice_1 – Displays a text string on a bitmap field (similar to the BASIC 7.0&#x27;s low-res codice_2 command)
* codice_3 – Switch between one of up to 32 high-res screens
* codice_4 – Fill a closed area with a color or a pattern
* codice_5 – Returns the color value of a pixel
* codice_6 – Copies part or all of a screen for later usage
* codice_7 – Displays the Walrusoft logo and the type/size of video RAM used (16K or 64K)
* codice_8 – Define part of the screen as a &#x27;window&#x27; for purposes of drawing

===Notes===
# The VDC was programmed by writing commands to and reading status messages from a single control register and transferring data between system RAM and the chip&#x27;s dedicated video RAM (16 or 64 KB, depending on C128 version) via a single data register, following a relatively complex protocol a laborious and slow procedure compared with the straightforward use of the several discrete, memory mapped control/status registers the shared system/video memory setup of the VIC-II. Many programmers took advantage of a VDC control primitive buried deep within the part of the KERNAL that controlled the 80 column video display, rather than writing their own primitive.

<text>HMS &quot;Hurst Castle&quot; (K416) was one of 44 s built for the Royal Navy during World War II. Completed in June 1944, she began escorting convoys in August and was sunk by a German U-boat the following month.

==Design and description==
The Castle-class corvette was a stretched version of the preceding Flower class, enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The &quot;Castle&quot;s carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement was 99 officers and ratings.

The Castle-class ships were equipped with a single QF Mk XVI gun forward, but their primary weapon was their single three-barrel Squid anti-submarine mortar. This was backed up by one depth charge rail and two throwers for 15 depth charges. The ships were fitted with two twin and a pair of single mounts for Oerlikon light AA guns. Provision was made for a further four single mounts if needed. They were equipped with Type 145Q and Type 147B ASDIC sets to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water. A Type 277 search radar and a HF/DF radio direction finder rounded out the Castles&#x27; sensor suite.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Hurst Castle&quot;, the only ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy, was ordered on 2 February 1943 from Caledon Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company and was laid down at their shipyard in Dundee on 6 August. She was launched on 23 February 1944 and was completed on 9 June. The ship sailed to the anti-submarine training base in Tobermory, Mull, HMS Western Isles, for working up. &quot;Hurst Castle&quot; was assigned to Escort Group B3 on 3 July and escorted Convoy OS 85/KMS 59 from Britain to Gibraltar on 2 August. The group escorted Convoy SL 167/MKS 58 from Gibraltar to the UK later that month.

On 30 August &quot;Hurst Castle&quot; and her sister ship departed Derry, Northern Ireland, to rendezvous with Force 33 the following day. After meeting up with the other ships, they were tasked to search for the which had been spotted by a Royal Air Force Consolidated B-24 Liberator patrol aircraft on the morning of 1 September. At 08:25, &quot;Hurst Castle&quot; was struck port side aft by a torpedo fired by the submarine; the ship sank in six minutes at with the loss of 17 ratings. The escort destroyer rescued all 102 survivors.

<text>Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright I (February 24, 1792 – September 21, 1854) was a provisional Episcopal bishop in Manhattan, New York City.

==Early life==
Wainwright was born in Liverpool, England on February 24, 1792. He was the son of Peter Wainwright and Elizabeth (née Mayhew) Wainwright (1759–1829), who met on a trip to England from the United States and married in 1790. His father was a prosperous English tobacco merchant who emigrated from England to Boston and became a citizen after the American Revolution. His mother was the daughter of Reverend Jonathan Mayhew of Boston. His parents didn&#x27;t return to Massachusetts until eleven years later, in 1802. Among his siblings was Eliza Wainwright (b. 1794), who married Dr. Walter Channing, a prominent obstetrician. His brother, Robert Dewar Wainwright, was the father of Richard Wainwright, an American Civil War naval officer.

Jonathan graduated from Harvard College in 1812, where he was afterward a tutor. He received the degree of D.D. from Union College in 1823, and from Harvard in 1835. The degree of D.C.L. was conferred upon him by Oxford University in 1852.

==Career==
On April 13, 1817, he was ordered deacon in the Episcopal Church in Trinity Church, Boston and on May 29, 1818, he was ordained as a priest in Christ Church, Hartford, Connecticut, of which he later became rector.

In November 1819, he moved to New York and became assistant minister in Trinity Church. He was made rector of Grace Church in 1821, and remained in that charge until 1834, when he became rector of Trinity Church, Boston. In 1837 he returned to Trinity Parish, New York, as assistant in charge of St. John&#x27;s Chapel, which post he retained until he was elevated to the episcopate with the exception of six months&#x27; service in 1850 as rector-elect of Calvary Church in Gramercy Park.

He was for many years secretary of the house of bishops, and was instrumental in the founding of New York University. He was considered one of the first pulpit orators of his day. He wielded great social influence, was a ripe scholar, and was a devoted lover of music, contributing toward its improvement in the churches of his denomination. He was secretary of the board of trustees of the General Theological Seminary in 1828–34, and a trustee or officer of many other institutions and societies.

In 1844, he engaged in a controversy with his friend George Potts, which grew out of an assertion that Rufus Choate made at a celebration of the New England society. The orator said that the Pilgrim fathers had founded a &quot;state without a king and a church without a bishop.&quot; At the dinner that followed, Wainwright, in responding to a sentiment, said in reply that &quot;there is no church without a bishop.&quot; The subsequent discussion with Potts, which was carried on in nineteen letters in the New York &quot;Commercial Advertiser&quot;, was published as a book &quot;No Church Without a Bishop; or, the Controversy between the Rev. Drs. Potts and Wainwright. With a Preface by the Latter, and an Introduction and Notes by an Anti-Sectarian&quot;.

On October 1, 1852, Wainwright was elected provisional bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York.

<doc id="1246440" wikidata="Q533314" url="?curid=1246440" title="Joachim Beuckelaer">
<text>Joachim Beuckelaer (c. 1533 – c. 1570/4) was a Flemish painter specialising in market and kitchen scenes with elaborate displays of food and household equipment. His development of the genre of market and kitchen scenes was influential on the development of still life art in Northern Europe as well as Italy and Spain. He also painted still lifes with no figures in the central scene. He further added the staffage (i.e. the figures) or the garments in works of other local painters, such as Anthonis Mor.

==Life==
Details about the life of the artist are scarce. Beuckelaer was born in Antwerp into a family of painters. He was likely the son of the painter Mattheus Beuckeleer and the grandson of the painter Cornelis de Beuckelaer. His brother, known as Huybrecht Beuckeleer, also became a painter. The works of Huybrecht have occasionally been misattributed to Joachim. He possibly learned to paint in the workshop of his uncle, the Dutch painter Pieter Aertsen, who had married his aunt Kathelijne Beuckelaer. Aertsen was best known for his market and kitchen scenes.
Beuckelaer became an independent master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1560. He remained active in Antwerp throughout his career and continued to develop themes pioneered in painting by Aertsen, but arguably surpassing his presumed master in skill. Beuckelaer was reportedly not getting high prices for his works during his lifetime. It was only after his death that his works dramatically increased in price. However, the large size of his later works and the number of workshop variants produced likely point to a degree of success at least towards the end of his life.

The date of his death is not known with certainty but fell likely between 1570 and 1574.
==Work==
Beuckelaer specialised in market and kitchen scenes with elaborate displays of food and household equipment. He also painted some brothel scenes. During the 1560s, especially during the early part of the decade, Beuckelaer painted some purely religious works, possibly because there was little demand for his kitchen and market scenes. For these religious works, unlike for the kitchen and market scenes, drawings are known. Most of these were destroyed in the course of the Calvinist iconoclasm which swept the Low Countries, starting in Antwerp in 1566. His still life of a carcass referred to as &quot;Slaughtered pig&quot; (Wallraf-Richartz Museum) dated 1563 is likely the earliest dated example of this subject. In the 1560s he also made designs for stained glass. 
Many of Beuckelaer&#x27;s works, as those of Pieter Aertsen, show in the foreground tables full of bountiful produce which can be interpreted as temptations of earthly satisfactions. Often these works not only reference the pleasures of food but also contain objects and gestures which point to the temptations of sexual desire. For instance, visual representations of men&#x27;s purses occasionally evoke men&#x27;s genitals. These purses often had straps or false flaps and smaller pouches for coins on the bag&#x27;s external side which could be very suggestive as is shown in the &quot;Market farmers&quot; in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. In the &quot;Poultry dealer and a young woman with an array of fruit, vegetables, fish and game on a table before a house&quot;, the poultry dealer is holding a large chicken and standing close behind the young woman. As in other cultures, the chicken or rooster was frequently a reference to male genitalia and sexuality, while the Dutch word &#x27;vogel&#x27; (bird) was slang for sexual intercourse (as in the verb &#x27;vogelen&#x27;).
As an antidote to these earthly temptations, Beuckelaer&#x27;s market scenes, like those of Aertsen, often incorporate biblical episodes in the background. His &quot;Four Elements&quot; series National Gallery, London are a good example. The painting depicting the element &quot;Water&quot;, for example, shows a fish market selling 12 kinds of fish, representing the twelve disciples of Jesus. Through an archway in the background the miraculous draught of fishes is depicted, with Christ appearing to his apostles and telling them to cast their nets on the other side of the boat. The scene appearing most frequently in the background is that of &quot;Christ in the House of Mary and Martha&quot;. It recounts the story of Christ visiting the sisters at their home in Bethany, and reprimanding Martha for busying herself with household matters rather than heeding his message. The moral message of these religious scenes was to encourage viewers to leave behind the temptations of the flesh and move towards the spiritual food offered by the Christian faith.
Both Aertsen and Beuckelaer gradually developed images that detached the world of produce from the religious content of their earlier hybrid images. These later works depict either kitchens or markets and the persons associated with those activities, more often women than men. The later paintings by Beuckelaer show a greater profusion of foodstuffs in the market scenes, together with a more prominent foregrounding of female peasants immersed within these sales items. Beuckelaer also produced several images of fish stalls, often with background religious scenes, but sometimes completely separated from any additional narrative or reference. In the year 1563 Beuckelaer was experimenting with more outspoken landscape settings in an innovative way, which was influential on later artists in Antwerp.
One of the still lives without figures in the kitchen or market scene itself is the &quot;Kitchen scene with Christ at Emmaus&quot; (c. 1660/65, Mauritshuis, The Hague) which is unique in his oeuvre. In this composition Beuckelaer painted a kitchen with numerous ingredients for a lavish meal: vegetables, fruits, nuts, poultry and a large cut of meat. The table linen and crockery are also in view. In the background, Beuckelaer depicted the biblical story of Christ at Emmaus. This story is pushed into the background while the secondary matter of the dinner preparations for Christ&#x27;s visit at Emmaus has become the painting&#x27;s main subject. This and similar scenes are regarded as the forerunners of the still lifes of the 17th century, in which the narrative elements vanished entirely.

Beuckelaer was also employed painting the figures or the garments in the work of other artists such as Anthonis Mor and Cornelis van Dalem.

Research into the technique underlying Beuckelaer&#x27;s canvases has shown that he often recycled his own compositions from one image to the next. He employed patterns of clustered items through tracings to compose new pictures with apparent variety. This kind of technique allowed him to increase production efficiency and cut costs in time and effort.

His work was influential in Flanders and abroad. The Flemish still life and animal painter Frans Snyders developed his Baroque many market scenes by taking inspiration of the work of Aertsen and Beuckelaer. Northern Italian painters such as Vincenzo Campi and Jacopo Bassano were also influenced by his work. Diego Velázquez was influenced by his kitchen scenes with religious scenes in the creation of his bodegones such as the &quot;Kitchen Scene with Christ in the House of Martha and Mary&quot; (1618, National Gallery). It is very likely that Velázquez had seen engravings of works of Aertsen and Beuckelaer.

<doc id="1246448" wikidata="Q7270334" url="?curid=1246448" title="Queen Elizabeth High School (Halifax, Nova Scotia)">
<text>Queen Elizabeth High School (QEH) was a secondary school in Halifax, Nova Scotia. QEH was known for its high academic standards, competitive sports teams and distinguished extra-curricular activities such as its annual model parliament and musical productions. Its Reach for the Top team won the CBC-TV national championship in 1975.

Queen Elizabeth High School was part of the Halifax community for 65 years, and offered many services and facilities including a 1280-seat performance auditorium that opened in 1951. QEH closed in 2007, merging with longtime rival St. Patrick&#x27;s High School to form Citadel High School.

==History==
Queen Elizabeth High School was formed by a merger of two former schools, the Halifax Academy and Bloomfield High School, which were considered overcrowded and outdated. It was built during World War II on Camp Hill, facing Robie Street, and opened on 2 September 1942. The new school was named after Queen Elizabeth (popularly known after 1952 as the Queen Mother), who had visited Halifax in 1939 with King George VI.

Queen Elizabeth was registered as a designated school for children of the United States Armed Forces and Diplomatic Corps, and had a long tradition of attracting students from other parts of Canada as well as from overseas.

&quot;Live!&quot;, the first live album released by legendary Canadian rock and roll band April Wine, was recorded in the QEH auditorium in 1974.

Queen Elizabeth High School was merged with nearby St. Patrick&#x27;s High School to form Citadel High School. The new school is located across the street from the former site of Queen Elizabeth, adjacent to Citadel Hill. Ground breaking for Citadel High School took place in April 2006, and the final classes at QEH finished in June 2007. Queen Elizabeth closed as the academically top-ranked high school in Nova Scotia (based on the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies annual rankings of high schools).

The building was demolished in 2011, and its former land was transferred to the province of Nova Scotia. During the demolition, workers discovered an unmarked, sealed copper time capsule behind the school&#x27;s cornerstone. Opened in September 2011 at Citadel High School, the capsule contained newspapers, school planning documents, and other paraphernalia from 1941.

Over the short term, a community garden has been developed on the site and includes a walking path from Robie Street to Bell Road. In the future, the land is slated to be developed by the Nova Scotia Health Authority as an expansion to the neighbouring Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre.

Queen Elizabeth High School hosted numerous successful reunions in its history and one final reunion, the &quot;Last Chance Reunion&quot; took place from July 27 to 29, 2007.

==Campus==
Queen Elizabeth High School occupied a sloping site on the corner of Bell Road and Robie Street, popularly known as the &quot;Willow Tree&quot; intersection. The sprawling school building, located opposite the Halifax Common and the Quinpool Road commercial district, was built in phases from the 1940s to 1960s. It had four teaching levels as well as a clock tower.

Though the school was originally planned to include a gymnasium and auditorium, construction of these facilities was deferred due to the war and a lack of funds. Work began in 1950, and the gym and auditorium were opened in 1951. &quot;Erminie&quot; was the first musical presented in the new auditorium.

The first phase of the school, as well as the subsequent gym/auditorium addition, were designed by architect C.A. Fowler (1891–1950) of Halifax.

More classrooms were added in the late 1950s, but the school remained overcrowded into the 1960s. The authorities discussed a variety of options to deal with the problem including adding another storey to the school, building a new high school in the north end, or building an extension to QEH. They finally settled on the latter option, and in February 1969 the Board of School Commissioners opened an addition along Bell Road that more than doubled the school&#x27;s size.

Queen Elizabeth High School&#x27;s facilities included a library, art rooms, music rooms, technology education shops, science laboratories, computer laboratories, family studies rooms, a reading resource room, a learning support centre, an ESL centre, a gymnasium, an auditorium and a full-service cafeteria – all of which were accessible to the physically challenged.

==Model parliament==
Queen Elizabeth High School had one of the oldest-running high school model parliaments in all of North America, founded in 1952. This became one of the most prized traditions of the school and continues at Citadel High School.

==Athletics==

===Basketball===

At the Nova Scotia high school level during the 1980s, QEH was the most dominant high school team in the province, winning several provincial titles as well as other tournaments across Canada. Bob Douglas, who has become a local basketball coaching legend, headed the team. Douglas died in 2008, but his coaching success at QEH spanned three decades and he coached or influenced perhaps most of the best players that came from Nova Scotia over that period. In the 1980s alone, the QEH Lions won four consecutive provincial titles and Douglas was officially recognized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. The Nova Scotia high school league in general was very competitive, and by the midpoint of the 1980s, basketball had become the most popular sport for both girls and boys at the high school level.

===Football===

The QEH Lions football team had a storied history, and ranks amongst the most successful high school programmes in Canada. Head Coach Mike Tanner was the 1999 recipient of the NFL Canada Youth Coach of the Year Award. Tanner, a former QEH Lions player himself, also taught High School Physical Education throughout his career as head coach of the football team. Many other former Lions players also returned as coaches including Jeff Lawley, who coached defence from the 1990s until the programme was merged with that of Saint Patrick&#x27;s at Citadel High.

<doc id="1246450" wikidata="Q466098" url="?curid=1246450" title="Lidia Gueiler">
<text>Lidia Gueiler Tejada (28 August 1921 – 9 May 2011) was a Bolivian politician who served as the 56th president of Bolivia on an interim basis from 1979 to 1980. She was Bolivia&#x27;s first female Head of State, and the second female head of state in a republic in the history of the Americas (the first was Isabel Perón in Argentina between 1974 and 1976).

She was the cousin of American actress Raquel Welch.

==Background and earlier career==
Gueiler was born in Cochabamba, to Moisés Gueiler Grunewelt, an immigrant from Germany and a Bolivian mother, Raquel Tejada Albornoz. She received a BA degree from Instituto Americano in Cochabamba. In the 1940s, she joined the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR). When that party came to power as a result of the 1952 National Revolution, Gueiler became a member of the Congress of Bolivia, serving in that capacity from 1956 until 1964. In 1964, she went into exile abroad after the MNR was toppled from power by generals Barrientos and Ovando. She spent the next fifteen years out of the country, and joined Juan Lechín&#x27;s Revolutionary Party of the Nationalist Left (PRIN).

She also became the vice-president of the Revolutionary Left Front.

Upon returning to Bolivia in 1979, Gueiler again ran for Congress and was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies of Bolivia (the lower house of the Bolivian Congress) as part of the MNR alliance of former president Víctor Paz Estenssoro.

As no presidential candidate in the 1979 elections had received the necessary 50% of the vote, it fell to Congress to decide who should be president. Surprisingly, no agreement could be reached, no matter how many votes were taken. An alternative was offered in the form of the President of the Senate of Bolivia, Dr. Wálter Guevara, who was named temporary Bolivian President in August 1979 pending the calling of new elections in 1980. Guevara was shortly afterwards overthrown in a military coup led by General Alberto Natusch. The population resisted, however, led by a nationwide labor strike called by the powerful Central Obrera Boliviana (&quot;COB&quot;) of Juan Lechín. In the end, Natusch was able to occupy the Palacio Quemado for only sixteen days, after which he was forced to give up power. The only face-saving concession he extracted from Congress was the promise that Guevara not be allowed to resume his duties as president.

==Interim President of Bolivia==
The above condition was accepted and a new provisional president was found in Lidia Gueiler, then leader of the lower congressional house.

As interim President, Gueiler was entrusted with the task of conducting new elections, which were held on 29 June 1980.

===Overthrown by Bolivian Armed Forces in 1980===
Before the winners could take their parliamentary seats, however, Gueiler herself was overthrown by the Bolivian Armed Forces in coup by her cousin, General Luis García Meza Tejada in 1980. Despite being backed by both the Soviet Union and the United States, while her cousin was supported by Argentina, Brazil and Peru. Gueiler subsequently left the country, and lived in France until the fall of the dictatorship in 1982.

==Later diplomatic and other activities==
Later, she served her country mostly in the diplomatic sphere, having been appointed Bolivia&#x27;s ambassador to first Colombia, then West Germany, and finally—after joining Jaime Paz&#x27;s &quot;Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria&quot;—to Venezuela (1989). She retired from public life in the mid-1990s.

Gueiler was involved in various Bolivian feminist organizations throughout her life. She opposed the United States-backed war on drugs in Latin America, particularly the so-called Plan Colombia. In addition, she authored two books, publishing &quot;La mujer y la revolución&quot; (&quot;The woman and the revolution&quot;) in 1960 and her autobiography, &quot;Mi pasión de lideresa&quot; (&quot;My passion as a leader&quot;), in 2000. She supported the candidacy of Evo Morales in the 2005 election.

In June 2009, Gueiler accepted the role of honorary president of the Human Rights Foundation in Bolivia.

She is the recipient of several awards, including the Order of the Condor of the Andes Grand Cross and the 1979 United Nations Woman of the Year award.

==Death==
On 9 May 2011, Gueiler died in La Paz following a long illness. She was 89 years old.

<text>Paul Broome (born June 6, 1976, in Dallas, Texas) is a retired American soccer defender who played eight seasons in Major League Soccer.

==Youth and college==
Broome graduated from Lake Highlands High School in Dallas, Texas, where he was an All-State soccer and football player. He also played youth soccer with the Dallas Texans Soccer Club. He attended Southern Methodist University, playing as a midfielder and forward on the men&#x27;s soccer team from 1995 to 1998. He graduated with a degree in business administration.

==Professional==
Broome was drafted in the first round (12th overall) in the 1999 MLS College Draft by his hometown Dallas Burn. In 1999, Broome appeared in thirteen games, registering one goal and two assists. He saw an enlarged role in 2000, playing a utility role for the Burn in outside midfield and left back. He played in 20 games in 2000 and 22 games in 2001. During the 2000 MLS offseason, Broome trained with Tottenham Hotspur of the English Premier League.

In 2002, Broome started all twenty-five games he played as a left back, registering four assists. However, in 2003, Chris Gbandi returned from a long-term injury and replaced Broome at left back.

In 2003, Broome played as a left midfielder and back for the Galaxy. In 2004, he earned a starting position, starting twenty games. He was traded to Real Salt Lake in June 2005 and played eleven games that season.

<doc id="1246454" wikidata="Q1557624" url="?curid=1246454" title="Born Innocent (film)">
<text>Born Innocent is a 1974 American made-for-television drama film which was first aired under the &quot;NBC World Premiere Movie&quot; umbrella on September 10, 1974. Highly publicized and controversial, &quot;Born Innocent&quot; was the highest-rated television movie to air in the United States in 1974. The movie deals with the physical, psychological and sexual abuse of a teenage girl, and included graphic content never before seen on American television.

==Plot==
Christine &quot;Chris&quot; Parker is a 14-year-old runaway who, after getting arrested many times, is sentenced to spend time in a girls&#x27; juvenile detention center. It is revealed that Chris comes from an abusive home. Her father beats her on a regular basis, which leads to her repeated flights from home. Her mother is unfeeling, sitting in her recliner, watching television and smoking cigarettes all day, and in complete denial as to what her husband is doing. Chris&#x27; older brother Tom is aware of the abuse, but he is unable to help Chris, as he is absorbed with the care of his own family.

Chris&#x27; social worker Emma Lasko never realizes that her dysfunctional parents are the cause of her troubles, and the juvenile justice system places the blame for her troubles on Chris herself. With the exception of one dedicated counselor named Barbara Clark (Joanna Miles), the reform school personnel are mostly apathetic and allow an unhealthy, destructive culture to fester. Despite Barbara&#x27;s attempts to help Christine talk about her problems, Chris refuses to open up to her or anyone else about her abuse.

After Chris is attacked in the shower and sexually assaulted by her fellow inmates, as well as witnessing a pregnant resident whom Chris befriends suffer a miscarriage while in isolation, and the pervasive indifference of the staff, Chris – feeling abandoned by the system in addition to her family – becomes angry, cold and bitter. When an argument between Chris and Ms. Lasko turns physical, a riot ensues. Chris is investigated for causing the riot. She calmly maintains that she had nothing to do with it. In the final shot, Barbara looks on helplessly as she sees Chris, an innocent, intelligent, decent girl, transformed into a violent, pathological, manipulative, vengeful and cold person, devoid of guilt or remorse for her actions, who is destined Chris&#x27;s parents to become a criminal adult when released upon reaching legal age.

==Controversial rape scene==
The original cut of &quot;Born Innocent&quot; contained a scene where several girls, led by Moco (Nora Heflin) and Denny (Janit Baldwin), use a plunger handle to rape Chris in the communal showers.

&quot;Born Innocent&quot; is credited with being one of the catalysts for the National Association of Broadcasters creating a family viewing policy. University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee educator Elena Levine pointed out that the film was advertised in &quot;The New York Times&quot; alongside the television show &quot;Born Free&quot;, which she theorized may have encouraged viewers to believe the film to be family friendly.

The film made several negative references to lesbianism. One version of the script implied that the character Moco&#x27;s lesbianism was a result of her surroundings and prompted her abuse of Chris and others.

The film was criticized by the National Organization for Women, the New York Rape Coalition, and numerous gay and lesbian rights organizations for its depiction of female-on-female sexual abuse; the Lesbian Feminist Liberation dismissed the film, stating: &quot;Men rape, women don&#x27;t,&quot; and regarded the film as &quot;propaganda against lesbians.&quot; The shower scene was eventually cut from the film due to multiple complaints.

=== Lawsuit over copycat crime ===
The film was blamed for the rape of a nine-year-old child at Baker Beach, San Francisco, by some of her peers using a glass soda bottle. Valeria Niemi, the victim&#x27;s mother, sued NBC and asked for damages up to $11 million. Her lawsuit cited the facts that one of the perpetrators, Sharon Smith (the only one jailed for the attack, having been sentenced to three years in a federal prison), evoked the movie when she was arrested, and that William Thomas, 14, the boy who provided the bottle, asked if it would be &quot;like it was done in the picture&quot;. Two other girls, 10 and 15, and the boy who served as lookout saw charges dropped.
In 1981, the California Supreme Court ruled the film was not obscene, and that the NBC network was not liable for the actions of the persons who committed the crime.

=== Effect on rape awareness ===

Blair cited what she felt was one positive outcome of the film, saying that she thought it made it easier for rape survivors to come forward.

==Subsequent airing==
In a response to the incident, re-airings in the late 1970s and 1980s did not air any of the rape sequence. The California rape influenced the establishment of the Family Viewing Hour which became briefly mandatory for the networks in the late 1970s, as the movie&#x27;s first hour was aired from 8 to 9PM Eastern Time, when some children may not have been in bed.

==Home media==
After the edited re-airings in the 1980s, the uncut version appeared on VHS in numerous budget-priced editions. In 2004, VCI Entertainment released &quot;Born Innocent&quot; on DVD with the rape scene included. More recently, a remastered version of the unedited version is available on the Shout Factory Channel via Amazon Prime.

<doc id="1246458" wikidata="Q1387401" url="?curid=1246458" title="Trevor Baylis">
<text>Trevor Graham Baylis (13 May 1937 – 5 March 2018) was an English inventor best known for the wind-up radio. The radio, instead of relying on batteries or external electrical source, is powered by the user winding a crank. This stores energy in a spring which then drives an electrical generator. Baylis invented it in response to the need to communicate information about AIDS to the &quot;people of Africa&quot;. He ran a company in his name dedicated to helping inventors to develop and protect their ideas and to find a route to market.

==Early life==
Baylis was born on 13 May 1937 to Gladys Jane Brown, an artist, and her husband, Cecil Archibald Walter Baylis, an engineer, in Kilburn, London. He grew up in Southall, Middlesex, and attended North Primary School and Dormers Wells Secondary Modern School.

His first job was in a Soil Mechanics Laboratory in Southall where a day-release arrangement enabled him to study mechanical and structural engineering at a local technical college.

A keen swimmer, he swam for Great Britain at the age of 15; he narrowly failed to qualify for the 1956 Summer Olympics. In 1959, Baylis started his National Service as a physical-training instructor with the Royal Sussex Regiment and swam for the Army and Imperial Services during this time. When he left the army he took a job with Purley Pools, the company which made the first free-standing swimming pools. Initially he worked in a sales role, but later switched to research and development.

His swimming skills enabled him to demonstrate the pools and drew the crowds at shows, and this led to forming his own aquatic-display company as professional swimmer, stunt performer and entertainer, performing high dives into a glass-sided tank. With money earned from performing as an underwater-escape artist in the Berlin Circus, he set up Shotline Steel Swimming Pools, a company which supplies swimming pools to schools.

==Inventing career==
Baylis&#x27;s work as a stunt man exposed him to the needs of disabled people, through colleagues whose injuries had ended their performing careers. By 1985, this involvement had led him to invent and develop a range of products for the disabled called Orange Aids.

In the late 1980s or early 1990s, Baylis saw a television programme about the spread of AIDS in Africa and realised that a way to halt the spread of the disease would be to educate and disseminate information by radio. Within 30 minutes, he had assembled the first prototype of his most well-known invention, the wind-up radio. The original prototype included a small transistor radio, an electric motor from a toy car, and the clockwork mechanism from a music box. Baylis filed his first patent in 1992.

While the prototype worked well, Baylis struggled to find a production partner. The turning point came in 1994 when his prototype was featured on a film produced by Liz Tucker for the BBC TV programme &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, which resulted in an investor coming forward to back the product. With money from investors he formed a company called Freeplay Energy; in 1996, the Freeplay radio was given the BBC Design Awards for Best Product and Best Design. In the same year Baylis met Queen Elizabeth II and Nelson Mandela at a state banquet, and also travelled to Africa with the Dutch Television Service to produce a documentary about his life. He was awarded the 1996 World Vision Award for Development Initiative that year.

The year 1997 saw the production in South Africa of the new generation Freeplay radio, a smaller and cheaper model designed for the Western consumer market which uses rechargeable cells with a generic crank generator.

During the 1990s, Baylis was also a regular on the Channel 4 breakfast programme, &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;.

In 2001, Baylis completed a 100-mile walk across the Namib Desert, demonstrating his electric shoes and raising money for the Mines Advisory Group. The &quot;electric shoes&quot;, developed in collaboration with the UK&#x27;s Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, use piezoelectric contacts in the heels to charge a small battery that can be used to operate a radio transceiver or cellular telephone.

Baylis set up the Trevor Baylis Foundation to &quot;promote the activity of Invention by encouraging and supporting Inventors and Engineers&quot;. This led in September 2002 to the formation of the company &#x27;Trevor Baylis Brands PLC&#x27; which provided inventors with professional partnership and services to enable them to establish the originality of their ideas, to patent or otherwise protect them, and to get their products to market. The company&#x27;s primary goal was to secure licence agreements for inventors, but it also considered starting up new companies around good ideas. The company was based in Richmond, Greater London. In 2013 it was reported that the company was financially struggling and was primarily reliant upon Baylis&#x27; personal finances to keep itself running. A few months after his death, Trevor Baylis Brands PLC became insolvent, and in early 2019 it ceased trading.

==Personal life==
For many years, Baylis lived on Eel Pie Island on the river Thames. He regularly attended jazz performances at the Eel Pie Island Hotel. He was a pipe-smoker and in 1999, received the Pipe Smoker of the Year award from the British Pipesmokers&#x27; Council. 
 In March 2010, Baylis stated that he was sexually abused at the age of five by a Church of England curate. This was also covered in his 1999 autobiography, &quot;Clock This&quot;.

In 2013 it was reported that Baylis was in financial difficulties and was living in relative poverty, having made little money from his wind-up power invention&#x27;s commercialization, having lost legal control of the product after it had been re-engineered by his corporate partners, and he was relying on a small income as a motivational after-dinner speaker.

He died on 5 March 2018 at the age of 80 after a heart attack and having been afflicted with Crohn&#x27;s disease in his final years. At the time of his death he was unmarried and had no living next-of-kin. A funeral was held at Mortlake Crematorium on 13 March 2018, where his body was cremated in a novelty coffin fashioned as the wind-up radio that he had invented.

==Awards and honours==
Baylis was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for humanitarian services in the 1997 Birthday Honours, and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to intellectual property. Baylis was awarded 11 honorary degrees from UK universities. He received honorary doctorates from Heriot-Watt University in 2003, Leeds Metropolitan University in 2005. and the University of Northampton in 2009.

<doc id="1246459" wikidata="Q2003532" url="?curid=1246459" title="Tactical light">
<text>A tactical light or weapon light is a flashlight used in conjunction with a firearm to aid low-light target identification, allowing the user to simultaneously aim a weapon and illuminate the target. Tactical lights can be handheld or mounted to the weapon with the light beam parallel to the bore. Tactical lights can also serve as a non-lethal weapon, used to temporarily blind and disorient targets or, in the case of a large handheld flashlight, to be used as a blunt weapon.

Features particularly associated with tactical lights include shock resistance, reliability, lightweight construction and powerful, long-lasting batteries, and high light intensity. Tactical lights may have optional filters to produce colored light, to not attract bugs, or may emit only infrared radiation for use with night vision equipment. A laser sight may also be added to a weapon-mounted tactical light.

==Handheld lights==

Handheld lights are generally restricted to use with handguns, as long guns such as rifles and shotguns require two hands to operate. While just about any handheld flashlight can serve in the role of tactical light with the proper technique, some features are more readily adapted to the role. Because the flashlight needs to be reliable and rugged, specialized, more expensive tactical flashlights are generally used by law enforcement officers and soldiers, rather than inexpensive consumer-grade units. Some manufacturers sell lights specifically designed for use as handheld tactical lights. Police training programs in shooting while holding a flashlight date back to at least the 1930s.

To use a handheld light as a tactical light, the handgun is held in one hand, and the light in the other. There are a variety of positions that can be used to allow the light and handgun to be held parallel and provide mutual support, or the light can be held off to the side of the body to present a false target to a potential assailant. Since the weapon and light are not attached to each other, the light may be used to illuminate areas that may or may not contain a target, without pointing the weapon at the area. If a target is detected, the handgun can quickly be brought into line to cover the target.

A flashlight intended to be used in this way will have provisions for ease of use when used with a handgun. Some models will have a narrow body and a ring designed to fit through the fingers, allowing the light to be used in a tight two handed grip on a handgun, with the switch controlled by pulling back with the fingers on the ring. More traditional models can be used as well. Some flashlights feature a momentary on switch so that the light is quickly turned off by releasing finger pressure on the button. Another useful feature is the ability to attach a lanyard to the light, allowing the light to be secured to the hand holding it; this allows the light to be dropped if the hand is needed (for a magazine change, for example) and quickly retrieved.

Police often use large flashlights like the classic D cell Maglite, a sturdy metal unit which, when held correctly, can double as a billy club and as a tactical light. The flashlight is held in the weak hand, with the back of the flashlight extending past the thumb. This allows the light to quickly be reversed, swinging the back end of the light forward to strike the target or block a blow. The strong hand can then be used to draw a sidearm, and place the hands back to back to provide support and illumination in the firing position. Smaller tactical flashlights often have crown-like protrusions around the lens to enable its use as a weapon by hammerfist strike.

==Weapon-mounted lights==

Hand-held flashlights were introduced about 1900 with availability of dry cell batteries and incandescent light bulbs. Early bulbs were often too fragile to survive the acceleration of firearm recoil. A United States patent was issued in 1912 for a night sight for firearms demonstrated on a revolver with a bulb mounted in a shock absorber below the barrel and the grip modified to hold a battery and include a pressure switch.

Weapon-mounted lights (sometimes called &quot;weapon lights&quot;) offer hands-free use, leaving the operator free to use both hands to control the weapon. For rifles, two hands are needed to use the weapon. Most models have an on/off switch mounted on a short wire. The switch is then mounted somewhere on the gun within easy reach of the firer&#x27;s fingers. Weapon-mounted lights are most commonly seen on rifles, shotguns, and submachine guns, but small tactical lights are becoming more common on handguns as well. These lights are often much more expensive than the handheld lights, since they must be sufficiently robust to withstand the recoil of the firearm, and the dedicated mounting hardware also adds to the price. One downside of the weapon-mounted light is that it is always aimed parallel to the bore, so illuminating an object means that it is also targeted. Because of this, weapon-mounted lights may not be appropriate under some rules of engagement.

Weapon-mounted lights used to be specific to particular models of firearm, and to some extent that is still true; for example, SureFire makes dedicated lights that replace the forends of the Mossberg 500 and Benelli M3 shotguns, the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine gun, and the M4 carbine. On the other hand, many modern firearms are incorporating rail integration systems, allowing any appropriately-sized rail-compatible tactical light to be attached. Other mounting systems are simple clamps, designed to mount most cylindrical lights parallel to the barrel of most firearms. Using an infrared light in conjunction with night vision goggles can mitigate concern about revealing the user, so long as the target lacks night vision. Also partially mitigating this risk associated with a visible light tactical light is the ability of the tactical light user to temporarily disrupt the night vision of the target.

On most handgun holsters, the firearm is held in the holster via the trigger guard, either via a locking mechanism or simply by the holster being a bit tight in that area and holds or clicks the firearm in place. On handguns with lights, however, it is often not possible to make a holster that retain the firearm by the trigger guard, and most such holsters therefore retain the firearm firmly via the light. As such, ready-to-use light bearing holsters not only have to be made for a specific handgun model, but also a specific light, or at least for a light which shares the same or roughly the same form factor. One example of this is the SureFire 300 and 400 model series, which have retained the same form factor despite receiving numerous modifications over time. Pistol lights sharing the same form factor gives the possibility to upgrade lights to newer models and continue to use old holsters, as well as giving better aftermarket support for holsters. Some holsters can safely accommodate different types of lights.

==Lighting features==
Since tactical lights are intended for use in situations where lethal force is likely to be used, reliability is important.

===Battery===
Primary lithium batteries are commonly used with tactical lights, due to the long shelf life, high specific energy, and gradual voltage decay over the battery&#x27;s lifetime. Alkaline batteries also provide moderately long shelf life and low initial cost. In powerful lights with high current draw, the high internal resistance of alkaline cells results in decreased effective capacity. As the rate of discharge increases, a greater proportion of the cells&#x27; power is wasted in its internal resistance. Because of their low internal resistance, lithium batteries are often the primary cell of choice when a high rate of discharge relative to nominal capacity is required. Lithium cells will also provide better performance in cold weather than alkaline cells. High-quality lithium cells are less prone to leakage of electrolyte than alkalines.

Rechargeable batteries, such as NiMH and Nicad, are economical options for lights with heavy usage. Rapid capacity loss in comparison to alkaline and lithium batteries limits the use of rechargeable cells to lights in frequent use. With a lithium-ion battery or a low self-discharge NiMH battery, rechargeable battery shelf life is extended. Several new models of tactical flashlights incorporate the ability to be recharged from a USB cable.

===Bulb===
Bulbs are chosen based on the desired light output and battery life. Generally, high performance bulbs are used, such as xenon bulbs or high power LED lights. LEDs provide maximum battery life due to their energy efficiency, and 2000s technology has greatly increased the light output of LEDs. At one time, xenon bulbs offered the brightest light levels, but recent high-power LEDs are brighter and more efficient than comparable xenon-filled incandescent lamps. Most importantly, LED bulbs are not subject to filament breakage due to the shot recoil of a firearm. Recent advances in high-lux, high-efficiency white LEDs have led to a wave of brighter and more energy-efficient tactical lights.

===Illumination types===
Tactical lights can be fitted with lenses to produce certain colors, Colored lights or filters provide flexibility for different purposes. Red lights are best for preserving night vision for the law enforcement officer, due to their minimal impact on the rod cells in the eye, while blue light provides high contrast for detecting blood. Light in the infrared spectrum is only visible through night vision devices, allowing the operator to see clearly while reducing the visibility to those not equipped with night vision equipment. Tactical lights are sometimes combined with a laser to form a multifunction unit, able to provide low-light targeting, illumination, or both.

<text>Spokane Transit Authority, more commonly Spokane Transit or STA, is the public transport authority of central Spokane County, Washington, United States, serving Spokane, Washington, and its surrounding urban areas. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

Originally conceived in 1980, and authorized by voters on March 10, 1981, STA provides public transportation within the Spokane County Public Transportation Benefit Area (PBTA). As of 2023, STA&#x27;s service area has a population of approximately 471,000 across including the cities of Spokane, Spokane Valley, Cheney, Liberty Lake, Airway Heights, Medical Lake, the Town of Millwood, and unincorporated areas between and around those cities.

It began operating service in 1981 after acquiring the assets of the city-operated Spokane Transit System. The agency can trace its roots to a number of private transit operators extending back to 1888. While the 98th largest metropolitan area in the United States, Spokane ranks 20th in transit ridership per capita using 2019 ridership data.

== Services ==

Spokane Transit provides multiple services:
* Fixed Route Bus Service. Spokane Transit operates 51 bus routes throughout its service area on published schedules. Most routes run 365 days a year. Additionally, STA operates routes during major community events such as the Lilac Bloomsday Run, Hoopfest, and the Spokane County Fair &amp; Expo.
* Paratransit. Pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Spokane Transit provides accessible transportation to persons with disabilities within of every fixed route.
* Rideshare. Previously Vanpool. A service which matches people traveling to or from similar locations and provides a publicly owned car or van at a fixed price per month.

=== Fixed routes ===
Spokane Transit has 51 fixed routes operating year-round on published schedules. Routes are numbered to reflect service class by the number of digits as described in the table below. Key geography is reflected in the first digit of regular service, while numbering of target service with triple reflects key markets and underlying geography through the combination of digits. Routes have distinct weekday, Saturday and Sunday schedule patterns. Most national holidays operate on a Saturday schedule with New Year&#x27;s day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas day operating on a Sunday schedule. 
=== Bus rapid transit ===
As of 2023, Spokane Transit has one bus rapid transit line within the region as part of its planned High Performance Transit network, with a second in development.

The first line, the City Line, began service in July 2023 and traverses from east–west through Downtown Spokane and the University District, running between the Browne&#x27;s Addition neighborhood and the Spokane Community College Transit Center.

A second line, with a working project name of Division BRT, is currently in design and planned to run north–south through Spokane along Division Street, with a goal of starting construction in 2026 and commencing service between 2027 and 2029 dependent on the opening of the North Spokane Corridor.

== Passenger facilities and amenities ==
=== Transit centers ===
Spokane Transit operates four transit centers as of June 2023:
*STA Plaza, in downtown Spokane
* Pence-Cole Valley Transit Center (VTC), in Spokane Valley
* Spokane Community College Transit Center, in Chief Garry Park in East Spokane
* West Plains Transit Center, near Four Lakes

=== Park-and-ride lots ===
Spokane Transit operates a total of 14 park-and-ride facilities throughout its service area, several of which are operated through cooperative agreements with other property owners to allow parking access to transit services.

=== Bus stops ===
At the end of 2022, Spokane Transit served 1,778 bus stops throughout its service area.

=== Bicycle accommodation ===
All fixed routes have buses with racks that can fit three bikes on the exterior of the bus. Most park and ride lots feature bike lockers that can be rented on a monthly basis. The New Flyer Xcelsior 60&#x27; articulating electric buses implemented on the City Line accommodate bikes on board the bus via the rear doors.

== Fares and passes ==
=== Fare structure ===
Fare structure as of May 2023: 
As of October 2022, the standard fare costs $2.00 and permits the rider to board any route for a period of two hours from initial purchase or validation on the bus. On October 1, 2022, Spokane Transit inaugurated a new accounted-based fare collection system, known as the Connect fare system. The fare system includes online account management, a smart card known as the Connect card, and a mobile app, STA Connect. The new system caps fares collected on a daily and monthly basis and includes several discount programs . A &quot;Rider&#x27;s License&quot; allows youth ages 6–18 to ride with zero fare. Traditional fareboxes remain on all fixed route coaches, allowing riders to pay with cash or older media as described below.

=== Fare media ===
As of 2021, fares on Spokane Transit can be paid in cash, or with pre-paid passes and transfers programmed to magnetic stripe cards or RFID smart cards. The fare payment platform went live on December 4, 2006, after a three-day transition period with no fares collection while new fare boxes were installed. STA&#x27;s prior system, while also accepting cash, utilized paper transfers and metal coin tokens.

STA launched the Connect Card with a companion eConnect app on October 1, 2022. The fare collection system, developed by INIT, can accept the Connect Card via NFC and the mobile eConnect app. The Connect Card and mobile eConnect app are linked to an online account-based fare management system. Users can reload balances via the app, at the STA Plaza, or partnered retail locations. The pass allows for fare-capping and allows users to lock the cards if a card is lost or stolen.

In July 2023, the system began accepting contactless payments including Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and digital wallets (Apple Pay and Google Pay) with onboard fare collection boxes as well as off-board fare validators and fare vending machines.

=== Pass programs ===
Spokane Transit provides multiple fare instruments, including employee, youth, and college passes. Additionally, organizations may participate in the Universal Transit Access Pass (UTAP) program with a &quot;utility charge&quot; for each ride taken by eligible participants. Spokane Transit currently maintains UTAP contracts with Eastern Washington University, Washington State University Spokane, Community Colleges of Spokane, Whitworth University, Gonzaga University and the University of Washington School of Medicine in Spokane (via Gonzaga University); City of Spokane for employees and elected officials; and, Spokane County for employees and elected officials.

== Governance ==
Spokane Transit is governed by a board of directors which includes nine positions filled by elected officials who must be appointed by the municipal jurisdictions that form the agency, and one position appointed by the Board upon recommendation by the labor organizations representing the public transportation employees within the local public transportation system pursuant to state law.

Originally, the board consisted of 2 members from the City of Spokane, 2 members from the Spokane County Commission, 1 member from each of the Cities of Airway Heights, Cheney, Medical Lake, and the Town of Millwood, and one additional member alternately held by an official from the City of Spokane and Spokane County. The City of Liberty Lake was incorporated in August 2001, and the City of Spokane Valley was incorporated in March 2003, necessitating a change in board membership.

Currently the board consists of:
* City of Spokane, 3 members
* Spokane County, 2 members
* City of Spokane Valley, 2 members
* The &quot;small cities&quot;, 2 members (combined)
* Labor representative, 1 member (non-voting)
The board of directors is also advised by the following committees:

* Board Operations Committee
* Planning &amp; Development Committee
* Performance Monitoring &amp; External Relations Committee
** Citizens Advisory Board

The executive team for Spokane Transit Authority consists of the following positions:

* Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
* Chief Operations Officer (COO)
* Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
* Chief Planning and Development Officer
* Chief Human Resources Officer
* Chief Communication and Customer Service Officer

== History ==

=== 1880s–1970s: Predecessors ===
Transit history in the Spokane area dates back more than 130 years beginning with the inaugural trip of a horse-drawn streetcar running between downtown Spokane and the Browne&#x27;s Addition neighborhood to the west in 1888. The first electrically powered streetcar began operations November 1889 and traveled between downtown Spokane through what is now the University District. Over the next several decades, multiple private interests constructed and operated streetcars and cable cars typically as an integral part of a real estate development plan.

By 1896, the leading streetcar system was the Spokane Street Railway Company, with 23 miles of railway. Its network of lines was described as a &quot;cartwheel&quot; that emanated from a &quot;hub&quot; at the intersection of Riverside Avenue and Howard Street in downtown Spokane.

By 1910, streetcar lines were owned and operated by two competing companies: Washington Water Power and Spokane Traction Company. In addition to urban street railways, each company had interests in electric Interurban lines that stretched as far away as Moscow, Idaho. In that year, streetcar and interurban ridership peaked at 37.98 million rides.

The decade following 1910 was a time of intense competition for the streetcars, with growing automobile ownership and private jitneys that threatened the viability of a divided transit system. By the end of the decade, Spokane Traction Company fell into receivership and underwent reorganizations that were unsuccessful in returning the system to profitability. In 1922, Spokane citizens overwhelmingly voted to amend the city charter to reduce taxes and other special assessments imposed on streetcar operations and infrastructure, enabling the formation of a unified streetcar system featuring &quot;universal transfers&quot; between lines and empowering the company to convert some lines to trolleybuses on its own discretion. Following the successful measure, the Spokane United Railway Company was formed as a subsidiary to Washington Water Power (later, Avista Corporation), creating a unified electric streetcar system.

The street railway system was gradually phased out through the 1930s to make way for motorized coaches. Bus ridership reached a peak in the Spokane area in 1946 with 26 million passengers. The system was purchased by Spokane City Lines Company (part of National City Lines) in 1945, and later turned over to the City of Spokane in 1968. Upon acquisition by the city, funding for the system was derived from a $1 household tax.

=== 1980s: Reorganization into regional system ===
In 1980, a municipal corporation was created to administer mass transit services for a new public transportation benefit area (PTBA). The new PTBA represented a shift in funding and operational model of Spokane Transit System from a city model to a regional model. Due to rapid inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the flat $1 city tax on households that had funded Spokane Transit System was no longer keeping up with the rising costs of its era. The household tax model had another major disadvantage; because the tax depended on the quantity of households within the tax boundaries, its revenues would only increase with the construction of new households. Meanwhile, most residential growth was occurring outside Spokane city limits. Furthermore, the flat tax on households had been viewed by some as a very regressive tax.

An election was held on March 10, 1981, to determine the future of public transportation in the Spokane region. The election measure, which passed and was subsequently implemented the following month of April 1981, replaced the $1 tax on households within Spokane city limits with a 0.3% sales tax to be applied throughout the public transportation benefit area. The shift in the transit agency&#x27;s funding and administrative model was not isolated to Spokane. Many other cities and regions in Washington state including the cities of Vancouver and Tacoma, as well as King County, Pierce County, Snohomish County, and Clark County had already shifted from a city household tax model to a county-wide transit system funded by sales tax.

In addition to adapting its funding model to reflect the current economic times, the shift to a regional model allowed the transit agency to heavily increase bus service to areas beyond Spokane city limits. Prior to the election, service outside city limits was limited, since no tax subsidies were collected outside the city limits.

The restructured system operated under three branches; Spokane Transit Authority for Regional Transportation (START) was the administrative body, the Spokane Transit System (STS) name remained for the fixed route bus operation, and Spokane Area Special Transportation Agency (SASTA) operated the paratransit services. The three names were unified about one and half years later in September 1982 under the Spokane Transit Authority name and brand. The name change officially took effect on September 23, 1982, after the START Board passed a resolution renaming the municipal corporation to Spokane Transit Authority.

In September 1989, Spokane Transit opened the Valley Transit Center, an off-street passenger facility located on 4th Avenue at University Road in Spokane Valley, featuring a large passenger island with covered seating. The facility included a park and ride lot among other amenities.

=== 1990s ===
At the urging of the downtown business community, Spokane Transit built a transit center in 1995 to replace the historic &quot;Howard and Riverside&quot; hub which required that buses park along many downtown streets for passengers to make transfers. Not only was this uncomfortable for passengers, who were forced to wait for buses in the weather, but it also made the streetside businesses less accessible to customers. The bus center, known as &quot;The Plaza&quot; was constructed as an indoor urban park at a cost of approximately $20 million including property acquisition costs. With its high, daylight ceiling, imported Italian tile, and cougar statues leaping over a waterfall between the up- and down- escalators, it generated great controversy.

In September 1998, Spokane Transit implemented a major revision of the bus network, the largest change to the bus network in 17 years. Routes were consolidated to provide more frequency on busy corridors and all route numbers were revised, primarily according to geography.

In addition to the local sales tax, a major revenue source was Washington State&#x27;s motor vehicle excise tax which provided matching funds. After statewide Initiative I-695 was passed in 1999, the legislature eliminated the matching funds even though the initiative was later found unconstitutional.

=== 2000s ===

The period after the elimination of the motor vehicle excise tax was a time of unprecedented change for Spokane Transit. As its undesignated cash reserves balance fell, Spokane Transit attempted to increase its tax authority from 0.3% to 0.6% in September 2002, but it was rejected by voters 48% to 52%. Research following the failed ballot measure pointed to limited understanding of the agency&#x27;s organizational structure, performance and financial conditions.

Spokane Transit created task force to study changes that could be made to regain the support of the community, while simultaneously preparing for a potential 40% service decrease. After increased public participation, and 69% voter approval, Spokane Transit increased the sales tax from 0.3% to 0.6% in October 2004, subject to a sunset of the tax in 2009. In May 2008, voters reauthorized the additional 0.3% sales tax with no sunset clause, with nearly 69% in favor.

SRTC and STA jointly created the Light Rail Steering Committee (LRSC) in early 2000 which was responsible for studying the creation of a light rail corridor from Downtown Spokane to Liberty Lake. This effort was preceded by significant study by the SRTC. In 2006 the committee published a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) which evaluated several rail and bus alternatives for the corridor. The committee stated preference for a single-track rail corridor using diesel multiple units (DMU) that would cost less than half the conventional light rail system. The travel demand modeling performed as part of the DEIS forecast less than 3,500 daily boardings on the 15.5-mile system in 2025. An advisory vote in 2006 elicited a negative response to continued planning and investment in the light rail project.

In 2005, E. Susan Meyer took lead as CEO of the agency.

In 2008, transit consultants Nelson-Nygaard Associates recommended changes to transit operations downtown while retaining the use of the Plaza transfer facility.

=== 2010s ===
Spokane Transit adopted a new comprehensive plan, Connect Spokane, in June 2010, to guide system planning and growth. The plan calls for a network of high performance transit with frequent service connecting key neighborhoods and activity centers throughout the region.

In response to a significant decline in sales tax revenue resulting from the Great Recession, Spokane Transit undertook service reductions in 2010 and 2011.
Despite the cuts, ridership increased, reaching an all-time high for Spokane Transit Authority in 2014, with 11.3 million passengers on its fixed route system.

In 2016, voters approved an increase in the sale tax dedicated to public transit to implement the STA Moving Forward plan. The plan called for more and better service, new connection facilities, include new transit centers and stations, and investments in six high performance transit lines.

In 2018, Spokane Transit opened the West Plains Transit Center, an investment of the STA Moving Forward plan. The addition of the transit center allows passengers between the cities of Cheney, Medical Lake and Airway Heights to travel between those cities without transferring in Spokane at the STA Plaza. As part of the 2018 changes, STA also increased frequency on service to the West Central neighborhood, introduced larger buses on North Division Street and introduced a new express route to the Valley Transit Center.

=== 2020s ===

Like public transport agencies across the globe, STA was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Fixed route ridership dropped from 9.97 million passenger boardings in 2019 to 5.24 million passenger boardings in 2021. STA&#x27;s ridership began to recover in 2022, with May 2022 experiencing a year-over-year increase of 29.6% on fixed route, 38.7% on Paratransit and 37.0% increase on Vanpool. In October 2022, STA launched a new fare collection system which allows for mobile payments in addition to previous payment methods, as well as introduced fare capping.

In July 2023, STA launched City Line, the organization&#x27;s first bus rapid transit line $14 million under budget. In the first year, City Line provided over 700,000 rides.

In December 2024, CEO E. Susan Meyer retired from STA after a near 20-year stint at the agency starting in 2005. While the CEO search is under way, Brandon Rapez-Betty (Chief Operations Officer) and Karl Otterstrom (Chief Planning and Development Officer) are acting as co-CEOs.

== Planned developments ==
Spokane Transit participates in regional transportation and land use planning activities. It is a member jurisdiction of the Spokane Regional Transportation Council (SRTC), and sends a member of its board to serve on SRTC&#x27;s board.
=== High Performance Transit Network ===
In 2010, STA developed a preliminary proposal for what it calls a &quot;High Performance Transit Network&quot; (HPTN) comprising 14 corridors of premium all-day frequent transit service. The preliminary proposal does not specify the operating modes for each corridor but suggests that the corridors will operate at a speed appropriate to the access provided and urban characteristics of the operating environment. The HPTN vision is an element of the agency&#x27;s proposed comprehensive plan, referred to as &quot;Connect Spokane&quot;.

Also in 2010, STA and the City of Spokane initiated an alternatives analysis to study transit improvements in and around the downtown core. This &quot;central city transit alternatives analysis&quot; considered &quot;High Performance Transit&quot; improvements that can be made to increase mobility and stimulate in-fill development. The locally preferred alternative was adopted in July 2011, calling for an east–west alignment for an electric, rubber-tired vehicle, and was dubbed the Central City Line.

In 2016, the central city transit plan took the form as the Central City Line project, later named the City Line, a bus rapid transit line that began service in 2023. It is the first phase of a number of high performance transit lines in Spokane and is the region&#x27;s first bus rapid transit corridor.

The future Division Street BRT, running from downtown Spokane to unincorporated Mead, WA, would be the second BRT corridor in the region. In March 2022, the Washington State Legislature passed a 16-year transportation program, programming funding for various projects and initiatives, with an emphasis on moving people in cleaner, more efficient ways. The program included $50 million to Division Street bus rapid transit.

<text>Millwood is a hamlet and census-designated place located in the town of New Castle, New York, United States in Westchester County. It was originally settled as Sarlesville. The area now known as Millwood appears on 19th century maps as Merritt&#x27;s Corners (now the intersection of NY 100 and NY 120) and Rockdale Mills (close to what is now the Briarcliff Manor border). As of the 2000 census, the community had a population of 1,210.

Miss America 1984, actress and singer Vanessa Williams grew up in Millwood, but lives in New Castle&#x27;s larger hamlet of Chappaqua.

Sarles&#x27; Tavern, also known as Granite House, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

==Education==
All of the census-designated place is in the Chappaqua Central School District includes the village. Additionally, most of the Millwood area lies in the Chappaqua Central School district.

Schools include: Elementary - Roaring Brook, Westorchard and Douglas Grafflin; Middle School - Seven Bridges and Robert E. Bell; High School - Horace Greeley. Most Millwood public school students will go to Westorchard, Seven Bridges, and Horace Greeley. The last group of students who graduated from Bell were seniors during the 2007-2008 school year. Over 94% of Greeley graduates attend four-year colleges.

==Infrastructure==
Millwood had a train station that was originally built by the New York and Putnam Railroad, that later became the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad. The last passenger train ran along the Putnam Division in May 1958. Freight service ended in 1962, when the rails were removed after this section had been abandoned. There was no usable track already by 1970. Pavement has since taken its place, and it is now a bicycle and pedestrian path, the North County Trailway. The original Millwood station house, built in 1888, burnt to the ground soon after the station was built, and it was replaced by a baggage car. The baggage car remained the station until 1910, when Henry Law built a new station for Briarcliff and the old Briarcliff Manor station was moved to Millwood. This station house was demolished in May 2012.

The closest Metro-North Railroad station is Chappaqua on the Harlem Line.

Important highways: Taconic State Parkway (North to Albany, South to Hawthorne), NY Route 100 (North to Somers, South to Yonkers), NY Route 133 (East to Mount Kisco, West to Ossining), NY Route 120 (South to Rye, North end in Millwood).

===Fire department===

As legend has it, lightning struck the Millwood railroad station one spring day in 1924 and a blazing fire started. Area residents attempted to put out the fire, but they did not have the equipment or manpower and the Chappaqua fire department was called in to suppress the blaze. To many residents, the railroad fire incident underscored the importance of a quick response to a fire in Millwood. Shortly after the railroad fire, a dozen families met to start the Millwood Fire Company to meet the suppression needs of the community.

Land for the Millwood Fire House was located on Route 120. The founders of the Fire Company contributed seed money and solicited area residents for donations for the land, to build Station #1 and to buy the 1924 Brockway chemical pumper. Much of the labor to build the firehouse was donated by residents, as many were carpenters and tradesmen.

In the beginning, firefighters were called to alarms by hammering the bell – still to be seen – in front of Station #1. That system was soon replaced with an air horn which was later replaced with an electronic siren still in use today.

In the early days, reporting a fire was done by telephone. When a fire was reported, telephones would ring in ten locations including Station #1, Millwood Shell, Deems Mobil, and the private homes of the Fire Company officers. Each of these phones was capable of sounding the air horn at Station #1. Today, a caller can dial 911 to report a fire, and firefighters are dispatched by a portable radio paging/alert system and an audible alarm sounds at the firehouse. Pager freq are Westchester county fire control 46.26 for page out and Trunk 17 for response. They also utilize county fire 17 for operations and communications to 60 control and multi-district communication at major fires.

The Millwood Fire Company currently houses two locations: Station #1 located on Route 120 and Station #2 located on Route 134. There are approximately 50 volunteers that respond to over 300 alarms a year. The all volunteer company is equipped with six fire-fighting pieces of equipment: two Engines (E-247, E-248), a Tanker (T-15), a Ladder (L-52 - a quint), a Rescue-Engine (R-36), a Mini-Attack (MA-10), and two utility vehicles (U-44, U-145).

<doc id="1246470" wikidata="Q4300" url="?curid=1246470" title="Codex Theodosianus">
<text>The Codex Theodosianus (&quot;Theodosian Code&quot;) is a compilation of the laws of the Roman Empire under the Christian emperors since 312. A commission was established by Emperor Theodosius II and his co-emperor Valentinian III on 26 March 429 and the compilation was published by a constitution of 15 February 438. It went into force in the eastern and western parts of the empire on 1 January 439. The original text of the codex is also found in the &quot;Breviary of Alaric&quot; (also called &quot;Lex Romana Visigothorum&quot;), promulgated on 2 February 506 by Visigoth King Alaric II.

== Development ==
On 26 March 429, Emperor Theodosius II announced to the Senate of Constantinople his intention to form a committee to codify all of the laws (&quot;leges&quot;, singular &quot;lex&quot;) from the reign of Constantine up to Theodosius II and Valentinian III. The laws in the code span from 312 to 438, so by 438 the &quot;volume of imperial law had become unmanageable&quot;. Twenty-two scholars, working in two teams, worked for nine years starting in 429 to assemble what was to become the &quot;Theodosian Code&quot;. The chief overseer of the work was Antiochus Chuzon, a lawyer and a prefect and consul from Antioch.

Their product was a collection of 16 books containing more than 2,500 constitutions issued between 313 and 437, while, at the same time, omitting obsolete provisions and superfluous phrases, and making additions, emendations, and alterations. John F. Matthews illustrated the importance of Theodosius&#x27; code when he said, &quot;the Theodosian Code was the first occasion since the Twelve Tables on which a Roman government had attempted by public authority to collect and publish its &quot;leges&quot;.&quot; The code covers political, socioeconomic, cultural, and religious subjects of the 4th and 5th centuries in the Roman Empire.

A collection of imperial enactments called the &quot;Codex Gregorianus&quot; had been written in c. 291–4 and the &quot;Codex Hermogenianus&quot;, a limited collection of rescripts from c. 295, was published. The Sirmondian Constitutions may also represent a small-scale collection of imperial laws. However, Theodosius desired to create a more comprehensive code that would provide greater insight into law during the later empire (321–429). Peter Stein states, &quot;Theodosius was perturbed at the low state of legal skill in his empire of the East.&quot; He started a school of law at Constantinople. In 429, he assigned a commission to collect all imperial constitutions since the time of Constantine.

While gathering the vast amount of material, editors often had multiple copies of the same law. In addition to this, the source material the editors were drawing upon changed over time. Clifford Ando notes that according to Matthews, the editors &quot;displayed a reliance on western provincial sources through the late 4th century and on central, eastern archives thereafter.&quot;

After 6 years, an initial version was finished in 435 but was not published. Instead, it was improved upon and expanded and finally finished in 438 and taken to the Senate in Rome and Constantinople. Matthews believes that the two attempts are not the result of a failed first attempt; however, the second attempt shows &quot;reiteration and refinement of the original goals at a new stage in the editorial process&quot;. Others have put forth alternate theories to explain the lengthy editorial process and two different commissions. Boudewijn Sirks believes that &quot;the code was compiled from imperial copy books found at Constantinople, Rome, or Ravenna, supplemented by material at a few private collections, and that the delays were caused by such problems as verifying the accuracy of the text and improving the legal coherence of the work.&quot;

The tone of the work reflected the rhetorical training that the drafters had received, and Averil Cameron has described it as &quot;verbose, moralizing and pretentious&quot;.

== Context ==
The code was written in Latin and referred explicitly to the two capitals of Constantinople (&quot;Constantinopolitana&quot;) and Rome (&quot;Roma&quot;). It was also concerned with the imposition of orthodoxy – the Arian controversy was ongoing – within the Christian religion and contains 65 decrees directed at heretics.

Initially, Theodosius attempted to commission &quot;leges generales&quot; beginning with Constantine as a supplement for the &quot;Codex Gregorianus&quot; and the &quot;Codex Hermogenianus&quot;. He intended to supplement the legal codes with the opinions and writings of ancient Roman jurists, much like the digest found later in &quot;Justinian&#x27;s Code&quot;. But the task proved too great, and in 435, it was decided to concentrate solely on the laws from Constantine to the time of writing.

Matthews observes, &quot;The Theodosian Code does, however, differ from the work of Justinian (except the Novellae), in that it was largely based not on existing juristic writings and collections of texts, but on primary sources that had never before been brought together.&quot; Justinian&#x27;s Code, published about 100 years later, comprised both &quot;ius&quot;, &quot;law as an interpretive discipline&quot;, and &quot;leges&quot;, &quot;the primary legislation upon which the interpretation was based&quot;. While the first part, or codex, of Justinian&#x27;s &quot;Corpus Civilis Juris&quot; contained 12 books of &quot;constitutions&quot;, or imperial laws, the second and third parts, the &quot;digest&quot; and the &quot;Institutiones&quot;, contained the &quot;ius&quot; of Classical Roman jurists and the &quot;Institutes&quot; of Gaius.

While the Theodosian Code may seem to lack a personal facet due to the absence of judicial reviews, upon further review, the legal code gives insight into Theodosius&#x27; motives behind the codification. Lenski quotes Matthews as noting that the &quot;imperial constitutions represented not only prescriptive legal formulas but also descriptive pronouncements of an emperor&#x27;s moral and ideological principles&quot;.

==Christianity==
Apart from clearing up confusion and creating a single, simplified, and supersedent code, Theodosius II also attempted to solidify Christianity as the Empire&#x27;s official religion after it had been decriminalised under Galerius&#x27; rule and promoted under Constantine&#x27;s. In his &quot;City of God&quot;, St. Augustine praised Theodosius the Great, Theodosius II&#x27;s grandfather, who shared his faith and devotion, as &quot;a Christian ruler whose piety was expressed by the laws he had issued in favor of the Catholic Church&quot;.

The &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot; is, for example, explicit in ordering that all actions at law should cease during Holy Week, and the doors of all courts of law be closed during those 15 days (1. ii. tit. viii.). It also instituted laws punishing homosexuality, which represented a departure from policy under the period of the Roman Republic, under which homosexuality was tolerated and perhaps mocked but was not illegal.

The first laws granting tax exemption to the church appear in the &quot;Codex&quot; and are credited to Constantine and his son Constantius II. These laws specify land owned by clergy, their family members, and churches were exempt from compulsory service and tax payments with the exception of land personally owned by the clerics.

== Sources ==
Books 1-5 lack the manuscript support available for books 6–16. The first five books of the surviving Codex draw largely from two other manuscripts. The Turin manuscript, or &quot;T&quot;, consists of 43 largely discontinuous folios. The second manuscript is the &quot;Breviary of Alaric&quot;, and a good part of the &quot;Breviarium&quot; that is included in book 1 contains the original text of the respective part of the original codex.

The latter part of the Codex, books 6–16, also drew largely from two texts. Books 6–8 of the Codex were preserved in the text of a document known as &quot;Parsinus&quot; 9643. The document circulated in early medieval French libraries, as well as the other formative document for the latter part of the code, a document held in the Vatican (Vat. Reg. 886), also known as &quot;V&quot;. Scholars consider this section to have been transmitted completely.

<text>HMS &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was a British Royal Navy destroyer which served in the Second World War. She and her Thornycroft competitor, , were prototypes designed to exploit advances in construction and machinery since World War I and formed the basis of Royal Navy destroyer evolution up to the of 1936.

She was launched at Yarrow on 15 January 1926, served in World War II, and was broken up at Troon in 1946.

==Design and construction==
In November 1923, the Admiralty issued a request to the major British shipyards specialising in destroyers for designs for the first destroyers to be built for the Royal Navy since the end of the First World War. The ships were required to carry a similar armament to that of the preceding war-built W-class destroyers (i.e. four 4.7 in (120 mm) guns and six 21 in (533 mm) torpedo tubes) but to have a longer range, at least at cruising speed. A speed of at least was required, and the ships were to be no more than long between perpendiculars (pp).

The winning designs were those from Yarrow and Thornycroft, and orders for one ship each placed in June 1924. Yarrow&#x27;s design, which became HMS &quot;Ambuscade&quot;, was smaller and lighter ( long (pp) and full load displacement) than Thornycroft&#x27;s ( pp long and full load). The ship was fitted with Yarrow&#x27;s distinctive inward sloping stern, which Yarrow claimed increased the ship&#x27;s speed by up to compared to a conventional V-shaped stern.

In order to provide the increased fuel economy required by the specification, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was fitted three 4-drum Yarrow boilers with air pre-heating, working at a pressure of and 200 °F (111 °C) of superheat. These fed geared steam turbines and drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at .

The main gun armament of &quot;Ambuscade&quot; consisted of four 4.7 inch BL Mk I guns. These guns fired a shell to a range of at a rate of about 5–6 rounds per gun per minute, with 190 shells carried per gun. (Later destroyers were fitted with QF guns firing cased charges and giving a higher rate of fire). Anti-aircraft armament consisted of two 2-pounder pom-poms (with 100 rounds per gun) and four Lewis guns. Torpedo armament consisted of the required six 21 inch torpedo tubes, in two triple mounts.

The ship&#x27;s armament went through a number of changes during the Second World War. By April 1941, the aft triple torpedo-tube mount was replaced by a 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft gun. Further changes included the addition of two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, the removal of two 4.7 inch guns (&quot;A&quot;- and &quot;Y&quot;-mount), replacement of the ships rangefinder and director with radar, fitting of the Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and a heavier depth charge outfit. The ship&#x27;s Hedgehog mount and remaining torpedo tubes were removed when the ship was fitted with two Squid launchers in May 1943.

&quot;Ambuscade&quot; was laid down at Yarrow&#x27;s Glasgow shipyard on 8 December 1924 and was launched on 14 January 1926. During speed trials on 2 March 1927, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; reached an average speed of . She was commissioned on 9 April 1927.

==Service==
Following commissioning, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; (with the pennant number D38) joined the Atlantic Fleet for trials, undergoing repair and modifications at Chatham Dockyard between September and November that year, before returning to normal duties. Between April and August 1928, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; and &quot;Amazon&quot; were sent on a cruise to South America and the West Indies to evaluate the ships and their machinery in tropical conditions. Both ships encountered problems with high temperatures in their engine rooms, while &quot;Ambuscade&quot; also suffered from vibration and had a shorter range than specified. In general, &quot;Amazon&quot;″s machinery was considered more successful than that of &quot;Ambuscade&quot;. Following her return to the UK, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; joined the Third Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet. In August 1929, she was hit by a practice torpedo, damaging her propellers and starboard propeller shaft, requiring repair at Malta until October that year. In January 1930, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; transferred to the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla, also part of the Mediterranean Fleet. In August, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; went to Malta for repair again, this time due to problems with the ship&#x27;s turbines. The repairs continued until March 1931, when &quot;Ambuscade&quot; returned to the UK and went into reserve at Sheerness.

In June 1932, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was taken out of reserve and joined the Home Fleet, serving in Irish waters. In December 1932, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was deployed as a Tender to , the torpedo school, being used for training and trials. &quot;Ambuscade&quot; continued this duty until February 1937, when the poor condition of the ship&#x27;s turbines resulted in a refit at Portsmouth, with the turbines requiring replacement.

&quot;Ambuscade&quot;″s refit continued until May 1940, while when she re-entered service with the Sixteenth Destroyer Flotilla based at Harwich, receiving a new pennant number, I38. On 10 June, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; took part in the attempt to evacuate troops of the 51st (Highland) Division from Saint-Valery-en-Caux (Operation Cycle). &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was damaged by German shell fire while embarking troops, and on the journey back to Portsmouth, she took the destroyer in tow after the latter was badly damaged by German dive bombers. Following repair, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; rejoined her Flotilla, carrying out anti-invasion patrols and convoy escort operations in July and August 1940, before transferring to the Twelfth Destroyer Flotilla based at Greenock in September, but recurrence of the ship&#x27;s turbine problems resulted in more repairs from September to November 1940.

&quot;Ambuscade&quot; then rejoined her Flotilla, by then based at Iceland for convoy escort duties. Further mechanical problems, this time with the ship&#x27;s condensers forced more repair at Portsmouth between October 1941 and January 1942. In March 1942, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; formed part of the Arctic convoy PQ 14 on its leg from Scotland to Iceland, and for the return convoy QP 9. By this time, it was clear that &quot;Ambuscade&quot;″s re-occurring mechanical problems meant that the ship was not fit for convoy escort duties, and &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was assigned target duties.

In late 1942, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; became a trials ship for anti-submarine weapons and sensors, being fitted with the experimental &#x27;Parsnip&#x27; anti-submarine mortar in an attempt to provide a more capable ahead-firing anti-submarine weapon than &#x27;Hedgehog&#x27;. &#x27;Parsnip&#x27; was not a success, and in May 1943, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was fitted with the prototype installation of the &#x27;Squid&#x27; anti-submarine mortar and its associated depth-finding Type 147 sonar. Trials of Squid were successful, and the weapon was widely fitted in new construction Royal Navy escorts. &quot;Ambuscade&quot; continued in use as a trials and training platform until the end of the war in Europe, then going into reserve.

&quot;Ambuscade&quot; was used for shock trials during 1946, and was sold for scrapping in November that year, being broken up by West of Scotland Shipbreaking Company at Troon from March 1947.

==Export variant==
&quot;Ambuscade&quot; served as the basis for the design by Yarrow of the s which served the Portuguese Navy (&quot;Marinha Portuguesa&quot;) from 1933 to 1967. Five vessels were ordered by Portugal in 1932. The first two, NRP &quot;Douro&quot; and &quot;Tejo&quot;, which were laid down on 9 June 1932, were sold to the Colombian Navy before their 1933 completion. This was in response to the Colombia–Peru War. Renamed and &quot;Caldas&quot; respectively, they served the Colombians as the . Two further ships were ordered by the Portuguese Navy to replace them. Two of the ships were built at Yarrow&#x27;s shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, and the remainder in Lisbon with Yarrow machinery.

<text>Chappaqua station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, located in Chappaqua, New York, United States, within the town of New Castle.

Next to the modern station is the building opened by the New York Central Railroad in 1902. Still in use as a waiting area, it is part of the Chappaqua Railroad Depot and Depot Plaza listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979. It was built on land donated by the daughter of Horace Greeley, a prominent newspaper editor and presidential candidate who had moved to Chappaqua in the mid-19th century and been responsible for much of its early development, on the condition that a small park adjacent to the station be maintained.

==History==

Chappaqua was first settled by Quakers moving inland from Long Island Sound in the 1740s. For a century after that, it remained a self-sustaining farming community, centered around the meeting house 0.6 mile (1 km) north of the present downtown along Quaker Road. The meeting house and several other buildings remain from that era. They are now part of the Old Chappaqua Historic District, also listed on the National Register.

In 1846 the New York and Harlem Railroad laid the first tracks along the current route. That led to gradual changes in the economy and geography of Chappaqua. Farmers could now easily ship their crops to New York for sale, and many switched to growing cash crops to take advantage of this. A few businesses began to cluster around the original depot site, a few hundred feet north of the present station. Three buildings were eventually built close to the station.

The rail connection made it possible for those with social and commercial links to the city to maintain them, and some who had business there moved to Chappaqua. Among them was Horace Greeley, the crusading editor of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. He settled there with his wife and daughter in 1853, seeking a quiet country retreat from the demands of his job and a place to test the farming methods he advocated. Shortly after moving in he built the first concrete dairy barn in the country. In 1864 he bought a large farm south of the station and expanded its farmhouse. He lived there for the last nine years of his life.

His daughter Gabrielle inherited the farm. Over the remaining years of the 19th century more city residents followed her family&#x27;s lead and moved out to Chappaqua. They often settled on farms that had been subdivided into large residential lots. By the turn of the century the 1846 depot was no longer able to handle its daily passenger and freight traffic, and the existing buildings were preventing easy access to the station. As sites for a new depot were being proposed and considered, with considerable opposition from the owners of the three buildings near the old station. Gabrielle offered to donate the where it presently stands for a station, a public park to always be maintained there, and an access road to be named Woodbine Avenue after her mother&#x27;s family.

Her offer was accepted, and the station was built there. It was completed and opened in 1902, amid much local celebration. Its completion triggered the development of most of modern downtown Chappaqua, and accelerated the suburbanization of the community, as Gabrielle Greeley continued to subdivide the remnants of the farm for development by others until her death in 1937. The small park, decorated with a statue of her father and war memorial in 1914, remained per the stipulation of her original gift.

In the early 1970s the Penn Central Railroad, successor by merger to the New York Central Railroad, which had absorbed the New York and Harlem, went bankrupt. Commuter rail services it had operated were first run by Conrail, then by Metro-North Railroad after that agency was created under the aegis of New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). During the 1980s the new station, with elevated platforms, was built. Café La Track was opened in the old station a decade later.

In the early 2000s, 20 spaces in the station&#x27;s lot were equipped with plug-in recharging stations for electric cars as part of a pilot program to encourage their use. Drivers of those vehicles were guaranteed access to one of those spaces. Three years later, during a $1.1 million renovation of the station, the owners of Café La Track, which occupied the southwestern corner of the station building, resorted to an online petition to successfully prevent themselves from being replaced by a Dunkin&#x27; Donuts franchise.

The historic station building was converted into a restaurant, Chappaqua Station, in 2015, while retaining much of the station&#x27;s original character. As of 2019, the station is occupied by Bobo&#x27;s Cafe.

==Station layout==
The station has one eight-car-long high-level island platform serving trains in both directions.

==Buildings and grounds==

The station is located on the southwest corner of downtown Chappaqua, located in a low area amid hilly terrain just north of the Mount Pleasant town line. At that point the two railroad tracks run straight in a northeast-southwest heading, paralleling the Saw Mill River Parkway and the headwaters of the eponymous stream immediately to their west. Quaker Road (New York State Route 120) crosses over the tracks just north of the station, east of its interchange with the parkway. Beyond the Quaker Road bridge, a parking lot separates the road from the main commercial area of downtown around the intersection of King Street, South Greeley Avenue, and North Greeley Avenue.

East of the station, across South Greeley Avenue, are commercial buildings north of Woodburn Avenue and Robert E. Bell Middle School of the Chappaqua Central School District. South of it is the Episcopal Church of St. Mary the Virgin, also listed on the Register due to its connection to the Greeley family. A baseball diamond lies between the station and New Castle&#x27;s town hall and the Chappaqua library on the south. To the southwest of the station its overflow parking spills out alongside the tracks to the town line.

Woodburn Avenue west of South Greeley serves as the station&#x27;s entrance road. Parking is in concentric semicircles, mirroring the small park just east of the station. A statue of Greeley and war memorial are located just across Allen Place from the historic station building on the east side of the tracks. The entry stairs to the modern station are immediately to the south.

The historic building is a one-story fieldstone structure with a tiled hipped roof pierced at either end by two stone chimneys. On its west side, opposite the statue and war memorial, is a gabled &quot;porte-cochère&quot; supported by square bracketed wooden pillars atop a stone wall. West, along the tracks, a roofed arcade extends along the tracks. It is no longer necessary as a shelter for passengers awaiting trains since the tracks are now fenced off on that side and all ingress and egress from them is via the modern station.

A walkway and steps enclosed with glass and aluminum climb to a similarly treated overpass from both north and south, with an elevator in a brick shaft between them. In the overpass are ticket machines, on the west end of the overpass, another enclosed stairwell and another elevator in a brick shaft descend to the elevated concrete island platform between the tracks.

The platform, long enough to accommodate eight cars, extends about to the south of the overpass. North of the overpass it continues to slightly north of the Quaker Road overpass. A roof covers the first hundred feet (30 m). Along its length are ornate metal streetlights, enclosed shelters, and some vending machines.

The historic station was converted to a café in 2015. While the ticket counter closed, the cafe retains most of the station&#x27;s original elements, including the waiting area benches and the original ticket counter, which serves as a check-out counter. It is decorated entirely in wood, from the flooring to the vertical siding to the exposed ceiling rafters. There is a simple molding at the floor, and a more decorative one at the chair rail level and then running around the waiting room at the top of the entryways, all of which are flanked by smooth square pilasters. Above that level is a paneled entablature (with ten-pane horizontal casement windows above the former ticket office), with another molded cornice at the ceiling.

<doc id="1246480" wikidata="Q1755547" url="?curid=1246480" title="Leonard Part 6">
<text>Leonard Part 6 (also known as Leonard Part VI) is a 1987 American spy parody film. It was directed by Paul Weiland and starred Bill Cosby, who also produced the film and wrote its story. The film also starred Gloria Foster as the villain, and Joe Don Baker. The film was shot in the San Francisco Bay Area. It earned several Golden Raspberry Awards; Cosby himself denounced and disowned it in the press in the weeks leading up to its release.

The film received universally negative reviews from critics and has often been considered to be one of the worst films ever made. It was also a box-office bomb, earning just over $4.6 million on a $24 million budget.

==Plot==
Bill Cosby plays Leonard Parker, a retired CIA spy who now operates a restaurant. According to the opening sequence of the film, the title refers to the idea that this film is actually the sixth installment of a series of films featuring the adventures of Leonard with parts one through five concealed in the interest of world security. In reality, no Leonard films precede this one.

The theatrical release poster points out that Leonard Parker is, at the time of his reluctant return to action, coping with domestic issues:

The film starts with Parker being called out of retirement by his CIA director Snyderburn (Baker) to save the world from evil vegetarian Medusa Johnson (Foster), who brainwashes animals to kill people. During the film, he infiltrates the International Tuna factory (Medusa Johnson&#x27;s hideout), fights vegetarians dressed in bird costumes and &quot;horny&quot; bees, and successfully steals her mind control device. However, Medusa kidnaps Leonard&#x27;s wife and blackmails the CIA into returning the device to her. Leonard then enlists laboratory rabbits to attack other CIA agents in an effort to regain the mind control device. Leonard again infiltrates Johnson&#x27;s headquarters to rescue his wife, Alison, but is captured and tortured by lobsters, but uses their claws to remove their restraints. Freed from the cell, he attacks Medusa&#x27;s henchmen with &quot;magic meat&quot; he acquired from a Gypsy, while Alison frees the captive animals, and destroys the base using Alka-Seltzer in the animal control chemical vats. He escapes by riding an ostrich across the roof and, despite ostriches being flightless birds, he is flown to the ground by the animal. The movie ends with Leonard and Alison celebrating their reconciliation in his restaurant.

==Cast==
* Bill Cosby as Leonard Parker
* Tom Courtenay as Frayn
* Joe Don Baker as Nick Snyderburn
* Moses Gunn as Giorgio Francozzi
* Gloria Foster as Medusa Johnson
* Pat Colbert as Allison Parker
* Victoria Rowell as Joan Parker
* John Hostetter as Adams

==Production==
Cosby says he got the idea for the film from watching &quot;Rambo&quot;. He said he thought to himself &quot;Man, there&#x27;s got to be a place for a hero who has to deal with a heavy who&#x27;s got a bigger gun than he has.&quot; Cosby described the lead as a &quot;high-tech comic-book character.&quot; He said, &quot;I&#x27;ve put stuff in here for the women, I&#x27;ve put stuff in here for the kids.&quot;

Asked years later about his work on the film, director Paul Weiland recalled:

==Reception==
The movie received overwhelming negative reviews. When the film was released in 1987, even Cosby himself said that he was so disappointed with it that he publicly advised people not to waste their money on it.

Roger Ebert called it &quot;one of the worst movies of the year&quot; and strongly criticized the obvious Coca-Cola product placement in one of the film&#x27;s close-up scenes, saying that Cosby &quot;ought to be ashamed of himself.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film zero stars out of four, calling it &quot;The year&#x27;s worst film involving a major star. That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s worse than &quot;Ishtar&quot;.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; declared, &quot;Bill Cosby is right to be embarrassed by this dud, but the result really can&#x27;t have come as a total surprise to him since he wrote the story and produced it.&quot; Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Cosby and the director, Paul Weiland, were reportedly at odds while filming &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot; ... but there&#x27;s plenty of blame for them to share. Mr. Weiland&#x27;s direction, Mr. Cosby&#x27;s story and Jonathan Reynolds&#x27;s screenplay seem equally trite.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Leonard Part 6&quot; is a smug, tedious exercise in self-indulgence ... There&#x27;s virtually nothing to laugh at in this film, and too much of everything else.&quot; Thomas noted that, although Weiland was the director, &quot;clearly Cosby, as star, producer and idea man, is the &quot;auteur&quot; here.&quot; Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated: &quot;Cosby looks woebegone all movie long. He knows he&#x27;s out of his element, a comedian of words in a physical role.&quot; Robert Garrett wrote in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;This Christmas turkey is so dreadful that it must be in the same league as Paul Newman&#x27;s &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; for its power to embarrass its star.&quot;

As of June 2022, &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot; had a 7% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews with an average rating of 3.5/10.

===Box office===
The movie was a box office flop. It grossed only $4,615,255—a mere fraction of its $24 million budget.

===Accolades===
The movie won three Golden Raspberry Awards, for Worst Actor (Cosby), Worst Picture, and Worst Screenplay (Jonathan Reynolds and Cosby). It was nominated for two more Razzie Awards, for Worst Supporting Actress (Foster) and Worst Director (Weiland). A few weeks after the ceremony, Cosby accepted his three Razzies on Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show.&quot; He demanded that the three Razzies he earned be specifically made out of 24 karat (99.99%) gold and Italian marble, which were later paid for by Fox. Cosby later brought the awards with him when he was a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,&quot; happily displaying them and proclaiming, &quot;I swept the awards!&quot; For the 2005 Razzies, the movie earned a nomination in the &quot;Worst &#x27;Comedy&#x27; of Our First 25 Years&quot; category, losing to &quot;Gigli&quot;.

It was also nominated for Worst Picture at the 1987 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards.

===Home media===
&quot;Leonard Part 6&quot; was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on DVD, on April 26, 2005.

<text>Idrottslaget Hødd is a multi-sports club from Ulsteinvik in Møre og Romsdal, Norway. Founded in 1919, it has sections for team handball, gymnastics and football. It is best known for their men&#x27;s football team, which since 2015 plays at Høddvoll, whose stated capacity is 4,081. The club&#x27;s old home ground, Høddvoll Stadion, holds the record attendance of over 12,000 spectators at a match against Vålerenga in 1981.

Hødd are currently playing in 2. divisjon, the third tier of Norwegian football. They played in the top tier in 1966, 1969–72 (4 seasons) and 1995 and is the club that has played most seasons at the second tier. Hødd won the Norwegian Cup in 2012.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
Idrottslaget Hødd was founded on 1 August 1919. The name derives from Höðr, which was a gifted archer in Norse mythology, and means &quot;battle&quot; or &quot;fight&quot;. Before the Second World War, the football team was not competitive with the two big clubs in the region, Rollon and Aalesund. Hødd was first promoted to the &quot;Landsdelserien&quot; (second tier) in 1950, and was close on promotion to Hovedserien in both the 1951–52 season and the 1958–59 season, but lost the promotion in the play-off against Ranheim and Brage respectively. Hødd also reached the third round of the Norwegian Football Cup on several occasions during the 1950s, where they were eliminated by first-tier teams.

===1965-1972: The golden era===
Hødd was promoted to the 1. divisjon for the first time in the 1965 season when they won their 2. divisjon group ahead of Rosenborg and Brann on goal difference, after Rosenborg lost 2–1 against Brann in the decisive match while Hødd won 8–2 against Kvik Trondheim on Lerkendal Stadion. With Kjetil Hasund as the most notable star on the small team from a small place in the outskirts of Norway, the national media predicted that Hødd would relegated in its first season in the top-flight. The pundits were right and Hødd were relegated from the 1966 1. divisjon, but the team performed well and was only one point short of avoiding relegation. All the players stayed at the club after the relegation, and were again promoted to the top-flight in the 1968 season.

When Hødd was back in the 1. divisjon, the team had learned its lesson and for the next three season the team had a miraculous ability to avoid relegation. As favourites to be relegated, Hødd won 3–1 against Sarpsborg in the last match of the 1969 season while Start won 2–0 against Lyn. These results saved Hødd from relegation as they finished level on points but with better goal difference then Start and Lyn, who were relegated. That Lyn was relegated was quite a surprise, as the team had won the double in the previous season and played the quarterfinal of the 1968–69 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup against Barcelona. Hødd reached the quarter-final of the Norwegian Football Cup for its first time in 1969, where they lost 1–3 against Fredrikstad. The next season, Hødd again avoided relegation with better goal difference then the relegated team, after Hødd won 6–0 against Pors while Skeid lost 1–0 against Strømsgodset in the decisive match, and Skeid was relegated. In the 1971 season, Hødd won 5–0 against Frigg in the penultimate match and avoided relegation with two points ahead of Frigg. After four seasons in the first-tier league, Hødd were relegated in 1972.

===1970s and 1980s===
After playing in the 2. divisjon in the 1970s, Hødd were relegated in the 1980 season and were playing at the third tier since their last time in 1964. With Terje Skarsfjord as head coach the team won promotion to the 2. divisjon and reached the quarterfinal of the 1981 Norwegian Football Cup. The third-tier team met the defending Norwegian Football Cup champions Vålerenga in the quarterfinal at Høddvoll, and Hødd scored the first goal before Vålerenga turned the match into a 2–1 victory. The match was watched by 12,300 spectators, which is the club&#x27;s record attendance. Jan Åge Fjørtoft and Børre Meinseth had their breakthrough in the 1985 season, but Hødd were relegated in 1987 and were playing at the third tier in 1988 and finished behind the local team Hareid before Hødd won promotion to the 2nd tier the next season.

===1990s: Ups and downs===
Hødd reached the quarter-final of the 1994, where they lost 3–5 after extra time against Lyn, and won the 1994 1. divisjon and was promoted to Tippeligaen with Erik Brakstad as head coach. Hødd eliminating the defending Norwegian Cup winners Molde in the fourth round of the 1995 Norwegian Football Cup with 2–0 at home after goals from Tommy Sylte. The team went on to reach the semi-final where they lost 7–1 on aggregate against Rosenborg after losing 5–0 in the first leg at home. The team was however relegated after only one season, as they finished 12th in the 1995 Tippeligaen. With the exception of 2000, Hødd played in the 1. divisjon until 2006 when the club was relegated to the 2. divisjon, and is the club with the most seasons at the second tier since 1963. Hødd hired Sture Fladmark, who won Tippeligaen coach of the year in 2002, as the new head coach ahead of the 2007 season, to win promotion back to the 1. divisjon. Hødd won promotion to the First Division in 2007, and started the 2008 season with a win against Sarpsborg Sparta before the team collected six points in the next 16 matches. With nine points and seven losses in a row Hødd fired Fladmark in August 2008.

===A new golden generation===
Einar Magne Skede and Lars Arne Nilsen replaced Fladmark, but could not prevent the team from relegation. Skede and Nilsen continued as head coaches in 2009, when Hødd finished third in the 2. divisjon, before Nilsen continued as the sole head coach in 2010 when the team won promotion to the 1. divisjon. The newly promoted team impressed in the 2011 season, and managed to go 29 matches without losing until they lost away against Sandefjord on 22 May 2011. Hødd was positioned at second place half-way through the season, before finishing the season at eighth place.

The next season did not start as good, and after eight matches Hødd had three points with 21 conceded goals, before they went unbeaten for the next six league-games. Hødd remained in the relegation-zone throughout the season and avoided relegation with better goal difference then Tromsdalen.

In 2012, Hødd won its first Norwegian Football Cup. The feat was according to pundit Arne Scheie the biggest upset in the history of the Norwegian Cup, as Hødd was a second-tier team who had in fact been fighting against relegation up until the last round in the league. Despite their troubles in 1. divisjon, Hødd defeated the first-tier teams Haugesund and Brann, qualifying them to their first ever cup final. Their opponent in the final was Tromsø, who finished fourth in Tippeligaen. After regular time, the score was 1–1, and no goals were scored in extra time. In the penalty shoot-out, Hødd won 4–2. Ørjan Nyland was named man of the match, while Fredrik Aursnes became the youngest ever Norwegian Cup winner aged 16 years and 351 days.

Hødd failed to defend the Norwegian Cup title, as the team was eliminated by the defending Tippeligaen winners Molde in the third round of the 2013 Norwegian Football Cup, after a penalty shoot-out where Hødd&#x27;s former goalkeeper Ørjan Nyland, who had transferred to Molde after the previous season, saved two penalties. As a result of the Norwegian Cup win, Hødd qualified for the first time in a European competition, Europa League. They debuted with a 1–0 victory at home against Aktobe, but the European adventure ended after a 2–0 loss in the second leg.

==Notable players==
After the relegation from the top-flight in 1972, the club did not manage to keep the talented youngsters at the club, and Svein Inge Urke and Åge Hareide moved to Start and Molde respectively. For the next decades, the club continued to develop talented players, like the sons of the generation that played in the First Division, Geir Hasund, Børre Meinseth, Egil Ulfstein, Ole Bjørn Sundgot and Arild Sundgot along with Jan Åge Fjørtoft and Karl Oskar Fjørtoft moved elsewhere to play in the top-flight after having had a good development in Hødd.

In 2012, Hødd arranged an official voting of the best player in the history of the club and Kjetil Hasund, who scored 460 goals in 646 matches for Hødd, was voted as the best ever player. He was capped 16 times for Norway and is still the only player to be capped for Norway while playing for Hødd. With his 683 matches, André Nevstad is the player with most matches for Hødd and he was voted as the second best Hødd-player, while Otto Sundgot finished third in the competition. Åge Hareide, Sindre Eid, Hallbjørn Hasund, Karl Oskar Fjørtoft, Geir Hasund, Geir Televik and Jan Åge Fjørtoft were the other players in the top ten, while Vidar Ulstein was voted as the best goalkeeper.

<doc id="1246490" wikidata="Q1812747" url="?curid=1246490" title="Japanese cruiser Takao (1930)">
<text>was the lead vessel in the heavy cruisers, active in World War II with the Imperial Japanese Navy. These were the largest cruisers in the Japanese fleet, and were intended to form the backbone of a multipurpose long-range strike force. Her sister ships were , and . &quot;Takao&quot; was the only ship of her class to survive the war. She was surrendered to British forces at Singapore in September 1945, then sunk as a target ship in 1946.

==Background==
The &quot;Takao&quot;-class ships were approved under the 1927 to 1931 supplementary fiscal year budget, and like her sister ships, was named after a mountain. Mount Takao (高雄山) is located outside Kyoto and is not to be confused with the similarly named Mount Takao (高尾山) located outside Tokyo, or the city of Takao (高雄, Kaohsiung), in Taiwan.

==Design==

The &quot;Takao&quot;-class cruisers were an improved version of the previous design, incorporating technical elements learned with the development of the experimental light cruiser . They had a distinctive profile with a large, raked main funnel, and a smaller, straight, second funnel. Intended to address issues with the &quot;Myōkō&quot; class, the &quot;Takao&quot; class had thicker armor, dual-purpose main guns which could be used against aircraft, and torpedo launchers moved to the upper deck for greater safety. However, as with its predecessors, the &quot;Takao&quot; class was also top-heavy.

The &quot;Takao&quot; class displaced . &quot;Takao&quot; was long, with a beam of , draft of and were capable of 35.25 knots.

Propulsion was by 12 Kampon boilers driving four sets of single-impulse geared turbine engines, with four shafts turning three-bladed propellers. The ship was armored with a side belt, and armored deck; the bridge was armored with armored plates.

&quot;Takao&quot;’s main battery was ten 20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns, the heaviest armament of any heavy cruiser in the world at the time, mounted in five twin turrets. Her secondary armament included eight Type 10 12cm dual purpose guns in four twin mounts on each side, and 16 Type 90 torpedoes in four quadruple launchers. She was very deficient in anti-aircraft capability, with only two anti-aircraft guns. &quot;Takao&quot; was repeatedly modernized and upgraded throughout her career in order to counter the growing threat of air strikes, and in her final configuration was armed with ten 20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns (5x2), eight Type 89 dual purpose guns, (4x2), and 16 Type 93 Long Lance torpedoes in four quadruple launchers (plus 8 reloads). Anti-aircraft protection included 24 triple-mount and 12 twin-mount and 26 single-mount Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Guns and four  AA machine guns.

==Operational history==

===Early operations===

&quot;Takao&quot; was laid down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 28 April 1927, launched and named on 12 May 1930, and was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy on 31 May 1932. Although the first ship in her class to be laid down, &quot;Atago&quot; was actually completed two months earlier.

All of the &quot;Takao&quot; class were assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District, forming &quot;Sentai&quot;-4 of the IJN 2nd Fleet, and trained as a unit during the 1930s. She was captained by Captain Chūichi Nagumo from November 1933 – 1934, Captain Eiji Gotō from November 1934 – 1935, Captain Takeo Takagi from December 1936 – 1937 and Captain Tadashige Daigo from December 1937 – 1938. During this time, issues with their stability and seaworthiness due to the top-heavy design became evident. &quot;Takao&quot; and &quot;Atago&quot; were rebuilt at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal between 1938 and 1939, resulting in an improved design: the size of the bridge was reduced, the main mast was relocated aft, and hull bulges were added to improve stability. &quot;Maya&quot; and &quot;Chōkai&quot; were not modified as extensively, and can be considered mistakenly as a separate class. After rebuilding was completed, &quot;Takao&quot; and &quot;Atago&quot; patrolled off the coast of China in 1940 and early 1941.

===Pacific War===

At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Takao&quot; was commanded by Captain Asakura Bunji and assigned to Vice Admiral Nobutake Kondō&#x27;s &quot;Sentai&quot;-4 together with her three sister ships and provided gunfire support for the landings at Lingayen Gulf on Luzon in the Philippines. In February 1942, operating out of Palau, &quot;Takao&quot; was assigned to intercept shipping escaping from the Netherlands East Indies, sinking the Dutch freighter &quot;Toradja&quot;, British minesweeper and capturing the Dutch freighter &quot;Bintoehan&quot; on 1 March. On the same day, one of &quot;Takao&quot; floatplanes bombed the Dutch freighter &quot;Enggano&quot;. The next night, &quot;Takao&quot; and &quot;Atago&quot; overtook the old United States Navy destroyer and sank her with no survivors. Early on 4 March, &quot;Takao&quot;, &quot;Atago&quot;, &quot;Maya&quot; and the destroyers and , attacked a convoy near Tjilatjap. The Royal Australian Navy sloop defended the convoy for an hour and half, but was sunk. The Japanese cruisers then sank three ships from the convoy: the tanker &quot;Francol&quot;, the depot ship &quot;Anking&quot;, and Royal Navy Minesweeper-51. Two Dutch freighters, the 1030 ton Dutch freighter &quot;Duymaer van Twist&quot; and the 7089 ton freighter &quot;Tjisaroea&quot; were also captured. &quot;Takao&quot;, &quot;Maya&quot; and &quot;Atago&quot; then returned to Yokosuka for a refit with additional anti-aircraft guns, arriving 18 March.

In April, she participated in the unsuccessful pursuit of the Doolittle raid task force.

On 2 May, &quot;Takao&quot; assisted in rescue efforts for the seaplane carrier , which had been torpedoed by the US submarine off of Omaezaki. &quot;Takao&quot; rescued 471 crew from the sinking ship .

In June 1942, &quot;Takao&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot; supported the invasion of the Aleutian Islands, protecting the convoy for Kiska and providing fire support for landings on Attu. On 3 June 1942, their reconnaissance floatplanes were attacked by USAAF Curtiss P-40 fighters from Umnak and two were shot down; on 5 June, &quot;Takao&quot; shot down a B-17 Flying Fortress. &quot;Takao&quot; returned to Ōminato on 24 June.

In August 1942, &quot;Takao&quot; was assigned to &quot;Operation Ka&quot;, the Japanese reinforcement during the Battle of Guadalcanal, departing Hashirajima with &quot;Atago&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot; on 11 August for Truk. The cruisers were in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August from a distance, and did not see combat. However, during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October, all three cruisers (together with and ) participated in night combat operations resulting in the sinking of the crippled and abandoned American aircraft carrier .


This was followed by a determined attempt to shell the US base at Henderson Field leading to the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Early in the morning of 15 November 1942, the battleship , supported by &quot;Takao&quot; and &quot;Atago&quot;, engaged the American battleships and . All three Japanese ships hit &quot;South Dakota&quot; multiple times with shells, knocking out her radar and fire controls. &quot;Takao&quot; and &quot;Atago&quot; fired Long Lance torpedoes at &quot;Washington&quot; but missed. However, &quot;Kirishima&quot; was quickly disabled by &quot;Washington&quot; and sank a few hours later. &quot;Atago&quot; was damaged. &quot;Takao&quot; escaped unharmed, but was forced to retreat to Truk, and from there went back to Kure Naval Arsenal for repairs at the end of November, returning to Truk by the end of December.

In early 1943, &quot;Takao&quot; supported the evacuation of Guadalcanal. The force consisted of the carriers , and , the battleships and , heavy cruisers &quot;Atago&quot;, &quot;Takao&quot;, &quot;Myōkō&quot; and &quot;Haguro&quot;, the light cruisers &quot;Nagara&quot; and , and 11 destroyers. The Japanese transports were successful in evacuating 11,700 troops from the island.

Under the command of Inoguchi Toshihira, &quot;Takao&quot; operated in the central Pacific from her base at Truk. She returned to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 26 July for the installation of additional anti-aircraft guns. After returning to Truk on 23 August, she continued on to Rabaul on 27 August, disembarking army troops and supplies.

In response to American carrier aircraft raiding in the Gilbert Islands, &quot;Takao&quot; sortied with Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s fleet to engage the American carriers. The fleet consisted of the aircraft carriers , &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Zuihō&quot;, the battleships and , heavy cruisers &quot;Myōkō&quot;, &quot;Haguro&quot;, , , , &quot;Atago&quot;, &quot;Takao&quot;, &quot;Chōkai&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot;, the light cruiser &quot;Agano&quot; and fifteen destroyers. Despite extensive searches, this force failed to make contact with the American striking force and returned to Truk.

&quot;Takao&quot; was refueling at Rabaul when the base was attacked on 5 November 1943 by American carrier aircraft. She was targeted by SBD Dauntless dive bombers from and hit by two bombs, killing 23 crewmen and damaging her steering. &quot;Takao&quot; was forced to return to Yokosuka for dry dock repairs. During the repair work, additional anti-aircraft guns were fitted, along with a Type 21 radar. Repairs were not complete until 18 January 1944.

&quot;Takao&quot; was assigned to Vice Admiral Ozawa’s First Mobile Fleet based at Palau from 1 March 1944, and was stationed at Davao in the southern Philippines from 1 April. She was attacked by the submarine on 6 April, but all of her torpedoes missed. On 13 June, during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Takao&quot; was part of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita’s Mobile Force Vanguard, deployed from Tawi Tawi in an attempt to force the American 5th Fleet into a &quot;decisive battle&quot; off of Saipan. In what came to be called the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;, Japanese aircraft attacking US Task Force 58 off Saipan suffered severe losses. On 26 June &quot;Takao&quot; was again at Kure Naval Arsenal, where yet more anti-aircraft guns were installed, as well as a Type 13 air-search radar.

&quot;Takao&quot; returned to Singapore in mid-July and conducted operations in the vicinity of Singapore and Brunei until mid-October. On 22 October, &quot;Takao&quot; sortied from Brunei as part of Admiral Kurita&#x27;s Center Force for the Battle of Leyte Gulf. In the predawn hours of 23 October, the Japanese force was intercepted by two American submarines in the Palawan Passage. &quot;Takao&quot; was hit by two torpedoes from , which shattered two shafts, broke her fantail and flooded three boiler rooms. &quot;Atago&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot; were both sunk in the same engagement. &quot;Chōkai&quot; was lost a few days later at the Battle off Samar, leaving &quot;Takao&quot; as the sole survivor of her class.

&quot;Takao&quot; limped back to Brunei, escorted by the destroyers and , the torpedo boat &quot;Hiyodori&quot; and the transport &quot;Mitsu Maru&quot;, and on to Singapore by 12 November. &quot;Takao&quot; was assessed as being unrepairable at Singapore and impossible to tow to Japan. She was therefore moored as a floating anti-aircraft battery defending Seletar Naval Base along with &quot;Myōkō&quot;, the latter crippled at the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea and then further damaged by a submarine-launched torpedo.

Concerned that both cruisers could interfere with Allied forces approaching Singapore, the Royal Navy launched Operation Struggle on 31 July 1945 with the midget submarines (Lieutenant Ian Edward Fraser) assigned to attack &quot;Takao&quot;, and (Lieutenant J. E. Smart) to attack &quot;Myōkō&quot;. After penetrating the harbor defenses, &quot;XE3&quot; maneuvered under &quot;Takao&quot;, where diver Acting Leading Seaman James Joseph Magennis exited the submarine. The magnets of the limpet mines would not hold them on &quot;Takao&quot;″s hull, which was covered with a thick layer of seaweed, so he attached six limpet mines to the hull using an improvised piece of rope. When the mines exploded, they blew a hole. Several compartments below the lower deck were flooded, including two ammunition magazines, the main gun plotting room and the lower communications room. Fraser and Magennis were awarded the Victoria Cross.
It was discovered after the end of the war that &quot;Takao&quot; was manned by a skeleton crew and had no ammunition aboard for her 8-inch main armament. Japanese forces surrendered Seletar Naval Base to the British on 21 September 1945. On 27 October 1946, &quot;Takao&quot; was towed to the Strait of Malacca and was sunk as a target ship by the light cruiser on 29 October 1946 at . She was removed from the navy list on 3 May 1947.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Takao&quot; has an important role in the 2023 film &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot;, where the United States authorizes the ship to be returned to Japan so that it can defend the country against Godzilla. &quot;Takao&quot; arrives in time to rescue the main cast and battles Godzilla at point-blank range, forcing back the kaiju, only to be destroyed by the monster&#x27;s atomic breath and its resulting nuclear explosion.

The ship also makes an appearance in the anime &quot;Arpeggio of Blue Steel&quot; where she defects from the Fog to help the protagonists.

The ship is also a playable character in the smartphone gacha games &quot;Azur Lane, Kantai Collection&quot; and other similar themed titles&quot;.&quot;

<text>Sextans A (also known as UGCA 205) is a small dwarf irregular galaxy. It spans about 5000 light-years across, and is located at 4.3 million light-years away, in the outskirts of the Local Group of galaxies, which includes the Milky Way galaxy, and to which Sextans A may or may not belong.

Sextans A has a peculiar square shape. Massive short-lived stars exploded in supernovae that caused more star formation, triggering yet more supernovae, ultimately resulting in an expanding shell. Young blue stars now highlight areas and shell edges high in current star formation, which from the perspective of observers on Earth appears roughly square. The 10.4 m telescope Gran Telescopio Canarias recently observed the OB-type stars that power the giant HII regions.
