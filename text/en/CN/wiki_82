<text>Here [[Northumbria]] is defined as Northumberland, the northernmost county of England, and County Durham.
According to &#x27;World Music: The Rough Guide&#x27;, &quot;nowhere is the English living tradition more in evidence than the border lands of Northumbria, the one part of England to rival the counties of the west of Ireland for a rich unbroken tradition. The region is particularly noted for its tradition of border ballads, the Northumbrian smallpipes (a form of bagpipes unique to North East England) and also a strong fiddle tradition in the region that was already well established in the 1690s. Northumbrian music is characterised by considerable influence from other regions (and vice versa), particularly southern Scotland and other parts of the north of England, as well as Irish immigrants.

==Local musical forms and styles==

Northumbria shares with southern Scotland the long history of border ballads, such as &#x27;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&#x27;. It is also known for local dances, namely rapper dancing and Durham and Northumberland style clog dancing. The dance music of Northumbria differs markedly in style from that of the rest of England. It has more in common with Irish dance music, and especially Scottish dance music, yet is to some extent unique. Many dances from the region have the characteristic rant step.

Although many tunes are shared with other regions of England or other nations, there is often a distinct difference between a Northumbrian version of a tune and versions from elsewhere. For instance a simple Irish tune, &#x27;The Chorus Jig&#x27;, with three strains, appears in the Northumbrian tradition as &#x27;Holey Ha&#x27;penny&#x27;, an ornate five-strain variation set. A Scottish strathspey, &#x27;Struan Robertson&#x27;s Rant&#x27; appears, stripped of the Scotch snap, as a smallpipe tune, &#x27;Cuckold come out of the Amrey&#x27;, a long variation set. These two examples illustrate the impossibility of ascribing a regional origin to an old tune; each can be played on a primitive instrument, and may have been played for as long before first publication, as they have been since. Assumptions of regional origins can bedevil the study of music undertaken by enthusiastic musicians (who may sadly follow partisan allegiances) however regional versions and styles (like Northumbrian) are quite a different matter, having reliable established sources.

Tunes in hornpipe rhythm are much appreciated in the region, both for playing and for dancing, particularly clog dancing. One rhythm characteristic of the region is the rant, used for figure dances such as &quot;The Morpeth Rant&quot; with a characteristic step; musically it is similar to a reel, though somewhat slower, and with more of a lilt.

During 1770–2 William Vickers made a manuscript collection of local dance tunes, of which some 580 survive, including both pipe and fiddle tunes, many of which are from Scotland, southern England, Ireland and even France, revealing the very extensive and varied repertoire of local musicians at that time.

==Bagpipe music==
 In the later medieval period pipe music appears to have been characterized by the use of the Northumbrian &#x27;war pipe&#x27;, which may have been the ancestor of the Great Highland Bagpipe, but no example has survived. It appears to have been replaced in the region by the eighteenth century by a variety of pipes, ranging from the conical bore, open-ended border pipes, to the cylindrically bored smallpipes; the closed-ended form with its single octave compass and closed fingering is known to have existed since the seventeenth century, and open-ended forms were also known. The Union or Pastoral pipes, the precursor of the Irish Uilleann pipes, are also known to have been played and made in the region. The earliest known bagpipe manuscript from the UK is a tunebook by William Dixon of Stamfordham in Northumberland, dated 1733. This includes forty tunes with extensive sets of variations. Some of the tunes correspond to later versions of known smallpipe tunes; others, with a nine-note compass, must have been played either on Border pipes or on an open-ended smallpipe, like the Scottish smallpipes.

In the early nineteenth century, makers such as John Dunn and Robert and James Reid added keys to the closed-ended smallpipe, extending its range to almost two octaves. With its greater flexibility, the instrument became more fashionable at this time. On the other hand, the Border pipes seem not to have been found in Northumberland much after the middle of the century, though they were revived as the &#x27;half-long pipes&#x27; in the 1920s and more successfully in the 1970s and 80s.

Many families have been associated with traditional Northumbrian piping. Will Allan (Old Wull) and his son James (Jemmy) were noted pipers in the eighteenth century: James played on several occasions for the Countess of Northumberland. In 1756 Joseph Turnbull was appointed piper to the Countess. The Percy family have continued to maintain a piper to this day. Contrary to popular tradition, the Duke&#x27;s current piper, Richard Butler, has written that &quot;there is no record in the Percy Archives (Alnwick Castle) recording that James Allan was Piper to the Duchess or Duke&quot;. Turnbull&#x27;s pupil, John Peacock was probably the first Northumbrian piper to play a keyed chanter. Most notably, the Clough family of Newsham produced six generations of pipers, including Tom Clough, who made an important early recording in 1929, and taught many pipers, including Billy Pigg.

==Fiddle music==
The earliest source of music for fiddle from Northumberland is Henry Atkinson&#x27;s tunebook from the 1690s. This includes tunes current in both the southern English and Scottish music of the time. A later source, unfortunately lost, was John Smith&#x27;s tunebook from 1750. Some tunes from this were copied out by John Stokoe in the nineteenth century: these include an extended set of variations on the song &quot;The Keel Row&quot; for fiddle (the earliest known version), pipe tunes with variations such as &quot;Bold Wilkinson&quot;, and a version of &quot;Jacky Layton&quot; with variations for fiddle. It is clear that as in Scotland, the playing of extended variation sets on the fiddle was current in Northumberland at the time. A slightly later source, the William Vickers manuscript, from 1770, and also for fiddle, contains 580 simple dance tunes, but few variation sets.

In the nineteenth century the most notable feature of the region&#x27;s music was the popularity of the hornpipe in 4/4 time, and in particular the very influential playing of the publican, fiddler and composer James Hill. His compositions include &#x27;The High Level Bridge&#x27;, &#x27;The Great Exhibition&#x27;, &#x27;The Beeswing&#x27;, &#x27;The Hawk&#x27; and many others. Many other fine tunes have been attributed to him, but these include some he cannot possibly have written. Another local composer, in the later 19th century, was the fiddler and dancing master Robert Whinham, some 60 of whose compositions survive, notably the hornpipe &#x27;Remember Me&#x27;, and &#x27;Whinham&#x27;s Reel&#x27;.

In the early- and mid-twentieth century, influential fiddlers included Ned Pearson, Jim Rutherford, Adam Gray, George Hepple and Jake Hutton, father of the noted piper Joe Hutton. John Armstrong of Carrick played with the piper Billy Pigg. In the later part of the century, Willy Taylor was perhaps the most highly respected of the many fiddlers in the region.

==Other instruments==
Other musical instruments which have been used in the region include the flute and piccolo. Some nineteenth-century manuscripts contain tunes which are in keys and registers appropriate to the flute. Billy Ballantine was a piccolo player from the west of the region, who played for dances in the mid-twentieth century. The style of his playing was very distinctive, mixing staccato notes for rhythmic emphasis with more ornate passages. He made recordings of tunes like the &quot;Kielder Schottische&quot; and &quot;The Gilsland Hornpipe&quot; for the BBC. Billy Conroy made some recordings on home-made whistles.

Free reed instruments have been of growing importance since their development in the nineteenth century. In particular the mouth organ or &quot;moothie&quot; was played notably by Will Atkinson. As elsewhere in England the melodeon has been used for dance music.

==Folk revivals==
The first folk revival in the region tended to circulate around folk dance, the collection of border ballads and, from the later 1870s, the revival of interest in pipe music.

John Bell collected many tunes and songs from the region in the early nineteenth century. Later on, in the middle of the century the Ancient Melodies Committee of the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries attempted a more comprehensive collection, based largely on manuscript and printed sources; this was later edited for publication by John Collingwood Bruce and John Stokoe.

The Northumbrian Small Pipes Society was founded in Newcastle in 1893; although it was short-lived, only continuing until 1900, it ran a series of competitions, won by Henry Clough and Richard Mowat. The Northumbrian Pipers&#x27; Society was founded in 1928, and are generally credited with helping to keep the distinctive tradition alive. The first recordings of the Northumbrian smallpipes were made in the late 1920s, including the HMV recording of Tom Clough.

Border ballads were a major part of those collected by Francis James Child and make up most of the sixth volume of his ten volume collection of &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot; (1882–98).

The second folk revival saw a number of acts drawing on this work, and enjoying some success. Probably the most influential piper from the region was Billy Pigg, but other important pipers in the mid-twentieth century include G. G. Armstrong, George Atkinson, Jack Armstrong, and Joe Hutton. Figures such as Lou Killen, The High Level Ranters and Bob Davenport brought Northumbrian folk to national and international audiences.

The melody later used by Simon &amp; Garfunkel in &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; was first sung by Mark Anderson (1874–1953), a retired lead miner from Middleton-in-Teesdale, County Durham, to Ewan MacColl in 1947. MacColl recorded the lyrics and melody in a book of Teesdale folk songs, and later included it on his and Peggy Seeger&#x27;s &quot;The Singing Island&quot; (1960) 

The most successful folk group from the region in the 1970s were Lindisfarne, who played progressive folk music with some local stylings. Much more concerned with traditional music from the region were the group that splintered from them in 1973 Jack the Lad, and another group from which they gained some members Hedgehog Pie, who, for a time, provided a regional answer to the British folk rock of bands like Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span. These groups have been seen as continuing an exploration of regional identity through folk music. Between their demise and revival in the 1990s, the local scene continued through groups like the more traditional Doonan family, which contained some of the finest folk flute players in the region. These groups have been seen as continuing an exploration of regional identity through folk music.

Another prolific figure from the 1970s to 2000s was Eric Boswell. While best known for writing the Christmas song &quot;Little Donkey&quot;, Boswell&#x27;s local ballads like &quot;I&#x27;ve Got A Little Whippet&quot;, &quot;Sweet Waters Of Tyne&quot; and &quot;Tyneside&#x27;s Where I Come From&quot; often featured on Tyne Tees and at Newcastle City Hall &quot;Geordierama&quot; concerts and The Little Waster Bobby Thompson and various others made recordings. Boswell&#x27;s songs continue to be performed in folk clubs.

Colin Ross, has been influential not only as a player and teacher of the Northumbrian pipes, but has also been an important pipemaker, as David G. Burleigh was. Distinctive local sounds were much more marked in the next generation of traditional Northumbrian folk musicians such as Ed Pickford and Jez Lowe, who have reinvigorated the local scene and artists like fiddler Nancy Kerr and piper Kathryn Tickell have gained international reputations, appearing on records with artists including Kate Rusby, Eliza Carthy and Sting. In 2003 June Tabor stimulated interest in the Border ballads with her album &quot;An Echo of Hooves&quot;.

Thanks to the efforts of musicians like these in 2001 Newcastle University was the first to offer a performance-based degree programme in folk and traditional music in England. Currently the region has over thirty active folk clubs and hosts several major folk festivals, including the Traditional Music Festival at Rothbury.

==Contemporary music in Northumbria==
There are many artists and acts that have formed in the North East such as the Lighthouse Family and Dubstar (Newcastle upon Tyne), Maxïmo Park (Singer from Billingham, other band members met in Newcastle) The Futureheads and Field Music (Sunderland) as well as China Drum (from Ovingham). Musicians and singers that were born and raised in the region include Sting, Bryan Ferry, Dave Stewart, Mark Knopfler, Cheryl Tweedy, Andy Taylor of Duran Duran, Jimmy Nail (Auf Wiedersehen Pet, Spender), AC/DC&#x27;s Brian Johnson, Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys, Paddy McAloon, and Moloko&#x27;s Mark Brydon.

===Northumbrian Mákina===
Mákina music, a subgenre of hardcore techno originated in Spain, has thrived in North East England and Scotland from the late 1990s to current times. The genre is the staple of the rave scene in North East England and Scotland. Following the closures of the most prominent venues – in particular the New Monkey nightclub – its popularity has slightly faded in those areas and has been partially replaced with Scouse house. Despite this it still retains a strong cultural legacy; regularly heard blasting from coaches when Newcastle United and Sunderland AFC play away matches.

<doc id="1258473" wikidata="Q1143410" url="?curid=1258473" title="Tow (fibre)">
<text>In the textile industry, a tow (or hards) is a coarse, broken fibre, removed during processing flax, hemp, or jute and separated from the shives. Flax tows are often used as upholstery stuffing and oakum. Tows in general are frequently cut up to produce staple fibre. The very light color of flax tow is the source of the word &quot;&quot;, meaning a person with naturally light blond hair.

== Composite materials ==
In the artificial fibre and composites industries, a tow is an untwisted of continuous filaments, in particular of acrylic, carbon fibres, or viscose rayon. Tows are designated either by their total tex (mass in grams per 1000 m length) or by the number of fibres they contain. For example, a 12K tow contains 12,000 fibres.

Spread tow fabrics are woven sheet materials, used for composite layup, where the warp and weft are flat tows, rather than spun yarns, in order to provide the maximum strength as a composite.

<doc id="1258478" wikidata="Q910635" url="?curid=1258478" title="Karaoke box">
<text>A is a type of karaoke establishment commonly found in Asia, the United States and Canada. It originated in Japan, and is now popular worldwide, particularly in Asia. Karaoke boxes consist of multiple rooms containing karaoke equipment, usually rented out for a period of time. A typical karaoke box establishment contains 10–20 (or more) such rooms, that can be themed so that each room has a different feeling or can be a traditional karaoke box, as well as have a main karaoke bar area in the front. Karaoke box establishments often sell beverages, and sometimes food but sometimes the establishment offers free refreshments. Many people of all ages enjoy karaoke as a pastime in Japan, as it still has a huge influence in the Japanese music scene and it is also a place that can attract tourists as well. While people do go to and enjoy karaoke boxes with family and friends, people also go by themselves and are able to enjoy the comfort of performing in the room by themselves. There is also a different style of karaoke, the traditional type where the patrons sing in front of everyone that is also still offered in popular entertainment areas, rather than the private boxes. 

A new trend of karaoke booth have shown up in Chinese shopping malls where customers can enter a booth, similar to a photo-booth, that allows them to perform different songs. It is suitable for use by one or two people The booths are cheaper than the traditional karaoke box, as they do not have to rent a room but just go in and sing a number of songs. The booths are very similar to the karaoke boxes but on a more intimate scale, with at least 20,000 booths running with an estimated () in 2017. The booths have an air conditioner, seats for the customers, the karaoke equipment, and headsets. 

Another trend that has popped up recently is offering boxes for daytime meetings for business who need a cheap business room.

There has also been conversation about fire safety with karaoke boxes after an arson in Hong Kong which led to public concern about their safety. One test recreated an establishment with 3 boxes and a corridor, in a remote location in China with the intention of testing a real-time fire in a karaoke establishment. There has also been additional research about karaoke boxes as to ensure the safety of the customers in evacuation research about widening the length of hallways.

The term karaoke box is primarily used in Japan, Hong Kong and Macau. Karaoke box establishments are commonly known as KTV (an abbreviation of karaoke television) in Taiwan, China, Cambodia, Myanmar, Singapore, the United States and Canada, &quot;videoke&quot; in the Philippines, &quot;noraebang&quot; (노래방) in South Korea (literally meaning singing room), &quot;hwamyŏn panju ŭmaksil&quot; (화면반주음악실) in North Korea, &quot;karaoke room&quot; in Vietnam, and &quot;karaoke club&quot; in Sri Lanka. It is also common to simply abbreviate it as K in Hong Kong Cantonese, often when used as a verb, for example 去K歌 (to go K songs) or 去唱K (to go sing K).

<doc id="1258480" wikidata="Q183334" url="?curid=1258480" title="Tretyakov Gallery">
<text>The State Tretyakov Gallery (; abbreviated ГТГ, &quot;GTG&quot;) is an art gallery in Moscow, Russia, which is considered the foremost depository of Russian fine art in the world.

The gallery&#x27;s history starts in 1856 when the Muscovite merchant Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov acquired works by Russian artists of his day with the aim of creating a collection, which might later grow into a museum of national art. In 1892, Tretyakov presented his already famous collection of approximately 2,000 works (1,362 paintings, 526 drawings, and 9 sculptures) to the Russian nation. The museum attracted 894,374 visitors in 2020 (down 68 percent from 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). It was 13th on the list of most-visited art museums in the world in 2020.

The façade of the gallery building was designed by the painter Viktor Vasnetsov in a peculiar Russian fairy-tale style. It was built in 1902–04 to the south from the Moscow Kremlin. During the 20th century, the gallery expanded to several neighboring buildings, including the 17th-century church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi. The collection contains more than 130,000 exhibits, ranging from the &quot;Theotokos of Vladimir&quot; to the monumental &quot;Composition VII&quot; by Wassily Kandinsky and the &quot;Black Square&quot; by Kazimir Malevich. In 1977 the Gallery kept a significant part of the George Costakis collection.

In May 2012, the Tretyakov Art Gallery played host to the prestigious FIDE World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Boris Gelfand as the organizers felt the event would promote both chess and art at the same time. In May 2023, the Tretyakov Gallery refused to hand over one of its most famous icons, Andrei Rublev&#x27;s &quot;Trinity&quot;, to the Russian Orthodox Church. In June 2023 the icon was transferred to Moscow&#x27;s main cathedral despite the museum&#x27;s protests on the personal order of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Administratively, the State Tretyakov Gallery organisation also includes a gallery of contemporary art in another part of central Moscow, and a number of other satellite galleries, including one in Kaliningrad, in the extreme west of Russia, and one in Vladivostok, in the far east.

==History==

Pavel Tretyakov started collecting art in the middle of 1850. The founding year of the Tretyakov Gallery is considered to be 1856, when Tretyakov purchased two paintings of Russian artists: &quot;Temptation&quot; by Nikolay Shilder and &quot;Skirmish with Finnish Smugglers&quot; by Vasily Khudyakov, although earlier, in 1854–1855, he had bought 11 drawings and nine pictures by Dutch Old Masters. In 1867 the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov was opened. The gallery&#x27;s collection consisted of 1,276 paintings, 471 sculptures and 10 drawings by Russian artists, as well as 84 paintings by foreign masters.
In August 1892 Tretyakov presented his art gallery to the city of Moscow as a gift. In the collection at this time, there were 1,287 paintings and 518 graphic works of the Russian school, 75 paintings and eight drawings of European schools, 15 sculptures and a collection of icons. The official opening of the museum called the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov took place on 15 August 1893.
The gallery was located in a mansion that the Tretyakov family had purchased in 1851. As the Tretyakov collection of art grew, the residential part of the mansion filled with art and it became necessary to make additions to the mansion in order to store and display the works of art. Additions were made in 1873, 1882, 1885, 1892 and 1902–1904, when there was the famous façade, designed in 1900–1903 by architect V. Bashkirov from the drawings of the artist Viktor Vasnetsov. Construction of the façade was managed by the architect A. M. Kalmykov.
In early 1913, the Moscow City Duma elected Igor Grabar as a trustee of the Tretyakov Gallery.
On 3 June 1918 the Tretyakov Gallery was declared owned by the Russian Federated Soviet Republic and was named the State Tretyakov Gallery. Igor Grabar was again appointed director of the museum. With Grabar&#x27;s active participation in the same year, the State Museum Fund was created, which up until 1927 remained one of the most important sources of replenishment of the gallery&#x27;s collection.
In 1926 architect and academician Alexey Shchusev became the director of the gallery. In the following year the gallery acquired the neighboring house on Maly Tolmachevsky Lane (the house was the former home of the merchant Sokolikov). After restructuring in 1928, it housed the gallery&#x27;s administration, academic departments, library, manuscripts department, and funds and graphics staffs. In 1985–1994, an administrative building was built from the design of architect A. L. Bernstein with two floors and height equal to that of the exposition halls.
In 1928 serious renovations were made to the gallery to provide heating and ventilation. In 1929 electricity was installed.
In 1929 the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi was closed, and in 1932 the building was given to the gallery and became a storage facility for paintings and sculptures. Later, the church was connected to the exposition halls and a top floor was built which was specially designed for exhibiting a painting by Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov,&quot;The Appearance of Christ Before the People&quot; (1837–1857). A transition space was built between rooms located on either side of the main staircase. This ensured the continuity of the view of exposure. The gallery began to develop a new concept of accommodating exhibits.
In 1936, a new two floor building was constructed which is located on the north side of the main building – it is known as the Schusevsky building. These halls were first used for exhibitions, and since 1940 have been included in the main route of exposure.From the first days of the Great War, the gallery&#x27;s personnel began dismantling the exhibition, as well as those of other museums in Moscow, in preparation for evacuating during wartime. Paintings were rolled on wooden shafts, covered with tissue paper, placed in boxes, and sheathed with waterproof material. In the middle of the summer of 1941 a train of 17 wagons traveled from Moscow and brought the collection to Novosibirsk. The gallery was not reopened in Moscow until 17 May 1945, upon the conclusion of the Great War.

In 1956, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Tretyakov Gallery, the Alexander Ivanov Hall was completed.
From 1980 to 1992, the director of the Tretyakov Gallery was Y. K. Korolev. Because of the increased number of visitors, Korolev was actively engaged in expanding the area of exposition. In 1983, construction work began to expand the gallery. In 1985 the Depository, a repository of works of art and restoration workshops, was commissioned. In 1986 renovations began on the main building of the Tretyakov Gallery. The architects I. M. Vinogradsky, G. V. Astafev, B. A. Klimov and others were retained to perform this project. In 1989, on the south side of the main building, a new building was designed and constructed to house a conference hall, a computer and information center, children&#x27;s studio and exhibition halls. The building was named the &quot;Corps of Engineers&quot;, because it housed engineering systems and services.
From 1986 to 1995, the Tretyakov Gallery in Lavrushinsky Lane was closed to visitors to accommodate a major renovation project to the building. At the time, the only museum in the exhibition area of this decade was the building on the Crimean Val, 10, which in 1985 was merged with the Tretyakov Gallery.

== Other galleries within the Tretyakov organisation ==
The Tretyakov management structure looks after multiple other sites, the most important of these being a second major gallery in Moscow and two remote satellite galleries.

=== Gallery of modern art ===
In 1985, the Tretyakov Gallery was administratively merged with a gallery of contemporary art, housed in the Central House of the Artists a large modernist building along the Garden Ring, immediately south of the Krymsky Bridge. The grounds of this branch of the museum contain a collection of Socialist Realism sculpture, including such highlights as Yevgeny Vuchetich&#x27;s iconic statue &quot;Iron Felix&quot; (which was removed from Lubyanka Square in 1991), the &quot;Swords Into Plowshares&quot; sculpture representing a nude worker forging a plough out of a sword, and the &quot;Young Russia&quot; monument. Nearby is Zurab Tsereteli&#x27;s 86-metre-tall statue of Peter the Great, one of the tallest outdoor statues in the world.

Near the gallery of modern art there is a sculpture garden called &quot;the graveyard of fallen monuments&quot; that displays statues of former Soviet Union that were relocated.

There are plans to demolish the gallery constructed in the late Soviet modernism style, though public opinion is strongly against this.

=== Kaliningrad and Vladivostok ===
New branches of the Tretyakov, based in the far west and east of Russia, were funded with reserved oil and gas revenue.

<text>Eric Daniel Djemba-Djemba (born 4 May 1981) is a Cameroonian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He previously played club football in France, England, Qatar, Denmark, Israel, Serbia, Scotland, India and Indonesia. In international competition, he represented Cameroon, having appeared for his country 34 times, including at the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==
===Nantes===
Djemba-Djemba rose to prominence with Nantes in France, where he forged a successful partnership with Mathieu Berson. His performances as a feisty and uncompromising tackler for the French club earned him a move to Manchester United for £3.5 million in the summer of 2003, signed by Alex Ferguson as a possible eventual successor to the 31-year-old Roy Keane.

===Manchester United===
Arriving in England, Djemba-Djemba established his aggressive style on his debut against Arsenal in the FA Community Shield, with a tackle on Arsenal&#x27;s Sol Campbell which Arsène Wenger called &quot;obscene&quot;.

In 18 months at Old Trafford, Djemba-Djemba found it difficult to maintain a period of sustained form, and he was eventually unable to establish himself as a player capable of eventually succeeding the ageing captain Roy Keane in the centre of the United midfield. A highlight during his United career was when he scored a looping volley against Leeds United in the League Cup. With the score at 2–2 and three minutes of extra time left, Quinton Fortune swung in a corner which reached Djemba-Djemba, who hit it first time and it looped over Leeds goalkeeper Paul Robinson which secured a 3–2 win and progression to the next round. He scored only once more for United, in a 5–0 UEFA Champions League win over Greek side Panathinaikos.

===Aston Villa===
Djemba-Djemba was sold to Aston Villa in the January 2005 transfer window for a fee of £1.5 million. However, the move did little to restore the player&#x27;s reputation as he found it difficult to move ahead of Gavin McCann and Steven Davis in Villa&#x27;s midfield. After being played only once, as a late substitute against Arsenal in the first ever game at the Emirates Stadium, by new Villa manager Martin O&#x27;Neill on the first day of the 2006–07 season, Djemba-Djemba was loaned out to Championship club Burnley for the remainder of the season in the January transfer window.

====Loan to Burnley ====
Djemba-Djemba made his first appearance for Burnley on 13 January 2007 against Southampton, playing the full 90 minutes. Early in his time at Turf Moor, he was sent off for the Lancashire side after a second bookable offence at Derby County; however he impressed with his skillful and effective play during his loan spell.

During July 2007, all signs pointed to Djemba-Djemba leaving Villa Park after he was the only member of the first-team squad not to be included in the North American tour and his contract was subsequently terminated by Aston Villa.

===Qatar SC===
Following his departure from Aston Villa, Djemba-Djemba joined Qatar SC. He only played one season at the Qatar-based club, but managed to get his football career back on track.

===Odense BK===
On 16 July 2008, Djemba-Djemba signed a three-year contract with Danish side OB, the contract was later extended with a year. He previously went on a trial with the club and made his Odense debut against former club Aston Villa in the Intertoto Cup. Odense drew the match 1–1, losing 2–1 on aggregate. In his career in Odense, Djemba-Djemba impressed the club&#x27;s fans, with his good ball skills and great performances. In his first season as an Odense player, he played good football, and was described by many as the league&#x27;s best player. In 2009, in the 72nd minute against Esbjerg away, Djemba-Djemba became the first player in the Danish league to assist with his sock, as the sole of his right boot had come off, forcing him to finish the game with one boot. Later that year, Djemba-Djemba was among three other players to be nominated for the SAS Liga player of the year.

In the summer of 2010, Djemba-Djemba was linked with a move back to England to join West Bromwich Albion and Italian side Lecce. After travelling to England for talks, the move broke down, and this led to accusations against West Brom by the club and Djemba-Djemba himself.

At the end of the 2011–12 season, Djemba-Djemba&#x27;s future at OB was uncertain after his contract expired. Despite expected negotiations, Djemba-Djemba instead left the club. The year before, he, along with Peter Utaka, had been told by the club&#x27;s officials that their contracts would not be renewed. As a result of their contracts not being renewed, the club decided to release players sooner rather than later.

===Hapoel Tel Aviv===
On 14 August 2012, Djemba-Djemba signed a two-year contract with Israeli club Hapoel Tel Aviv. Djemba-Djemba played a total of 28 league games with the Tel Aviv-based team.

===Partizan===
On 24 July 2013, Djemba-Djemba signed a two-year contract with Serbian side Partizan. He made his debut in a Champions League qualifying match away to Ludogorets Razgrad on 31 July 2013, coming on as a substitute in the 64th minute. However, Djemba-Djemba hardly played for Partizan during the first half of the season. The club&#x27;s signing of Nikola Drinčić on 20 December meant that Djemba-Djemba became surplus to requirements and his contract was terminated on 23 December 2013.

Djemba-Djemba once went on three month unpaid at the club.

===St Mirren===
On 5 February 2014, Djemba-Djemba signed a short-term deal with Scottish Premiership club St Mirren. He said he hoped his move to St Mirren can help him gain a place in the Cameroon squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Upon joining the club, manager Danny Lennon described Djemba-Djemba as the club&#x27;s biggest signing.

Djemba-Djemba made his debut for the club, in the fifth round of the Scottish Cup, as St Mirren lost 2–1 against Dundee United. After making just three appearances in all competitions, he was released by the club at the end of the season and also failed to secure a place on the Cameroon squad for the world cup.

===Chennaiyin FC===
In October 2014, Djemba-Djemba signed a short-term deal with Indian Super League club Chennaiyin.

===Later career===
In February 2015, Djemba-Djemba signed for Indonesian Super League club then legally known as Persebaya Bhayangkara. Before he could make a debut, the league was cancelled following FIFA&#x27;s sanction on Indonesia for governmental intervention.

In 2016 Djemba-Djemba joined French fifth-tier club Châteaubriant.

In September 2021, he announced his retirement from playing professional football.

==International career==
Djemba-Djemba was a member of the Cameroon national team that won the 2002 African Nations Cup and finished as runners-up to France at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. While in the Confederations Cup, Djemba-Djemba stated that he was the last person to have a conversation with Marc-Vivien Foé before Foé collapsed on the pitch and later died in the hospital. He also appeared at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. However, Djemba-Djemba was not included for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, due to managerial differences. Despite his attempt to make the Cameroon squad for the 2014 World Cup, Djemba-Djemba was not included in the 28-man provisional World Cup squad and thus missing out on the World Cup under the management of Volker Finke.

==Personal life==
Djemba-Djemba was born in Douala, Cameroon. He holds Cameroonian and French nationalities. He acquired French nationality by naturalization on 17 October 2001.

He was declared bankrupt following his move from Manchester United to Aston Villa in 2007.

Djemba-Djemba was married and fathered four children before being divorced. He is a Christian.

<text>Whipcord is the name for either a fabric or a form of braided cord.

==Fabric==
Whipcord fabric is a strong worsted or cotton fabric made of hard-twisted yarns with a diagonal cord or rib. 
The weave used for whipcord is a steep-angled twill, essentially the same weave as a cavalry twill or a steep gabardine. 
However, the ribs of whipcord are usually more pronounced than in either of those fabrics, and the weft (filling) may be visible between the ribs on the right side, which is usually not the case for gabardines. 
In practice, marketing considerations, rather than technical details, determine when the specific term whipcord is used.

Whipcord is usually found in durable outdoor clothing (typically pants, sometimes jackets) as a 16 to 18oz (ounces per square yard of fabric) wool, or in durable workers&#x27; clothing (typically overalls) as a 9 to 12oz cotton. In the latter case, whipcord is an alternative to duck, which has a different weave.

==Cord==
Whipcord (also &quot;whipcording&quot;) is a form of cordage used to make whippings, secure knottings placed over the ends of ropes to keep them from fraying. Sometimes called Interlocking, it is made by plaiting together four strands to make a stronger cord, usually using bobbins to weight the strands and make them easier to control. 

It can be worked as a solid color or in a stripe or a diagonal for a two color pattern.

<doc id="1258491" wikidata="Q50874" url="?curid=1258491" title="WrestleMania XIV">
<text>WrestleMania XIV (marketed as WrestleMania dX raided) was the 14th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF; WWE as of 2002). It took place on March 29, 1998, at the FleetCenter in Boston, Massachusetts. A total of eight matches were held at the event.

This pay-per-view event was notable for the involvement of boxer Mike Tyson, who acted as a ring enforcer for the main event. In the main event, Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Shawn Michaels to win the WWF Championship for the first time; Michaels performed despite a severe injury sustained during a match at the Royal Rumble and would not compete again until SummerSlam in 2002. This was the first WrestleMania of The Attitude Era and also the first WrestleMania event since 1986 not to feature Bret Hart, who jumped to the rival World Championship Wrestling the previous year after the Montreal Screwjob.

==Production==
===Background===
WrestleMania is the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF, now WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of the WWF&#x27;s original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the &quot;Big Four&quot;, and was considered one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; PPVs, along with King of the Ring. WrestleMania XIV was scheduled to be held on March 29, 1998, at the FleetCenter in Boston, Massachusetts. In print advertisements, the event was billed as &quot;WrestleMania: dX raided&quot;.

===Storylines===
After the Legion of Doom lost their WWF Tag Team Championship to The New Age Outlaws, they were then assaulted by the Outlaws and D-Generation X. At the Royal Rumble, the LOD lost a championship match, thanks in large part to Road Dogg handcuffing Hawk outside of the ring. Following this, they suffered two defeats at the hands of NWA members Jeff Jarrett and Barry Windham. Finally, on the February 23 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, the LOD once again lost to The New Age Outlaws when, despite having the match all but won following a &quot;Doomsday Device&quot;, the non-legal Hawk did not leave the ring as Animal was making the cover; while the referee was busy removing Hawk, Animal was struck by the title belts, causing them to lose the match. Following the match, the two men brawled all the way to the back and announced their dissolution, not appearing again until WrestleMania.

After the Montreal Screwjob, Owen Hart was left as the only member of the Hart family to remain with the company; and after a temporary absence, Owen returned during the closing moments of D-Generation X: In Your House to attack Shawn Michaels. Following this, he turned his attention to Hunter Hearst Helmsley (who would later be known simply as Triple H) and the European Championship that Michaels had given to Helmsley as a Christmas present. After weeks of deterring a championship match by way of a fractured kneecap (which was, in fact, legitimate), Triple H finally acquiesced to a match on the January 26 edition of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, only for The Artist Formerly Known as Goldust (who was dressing up from week-to-week in a bid for attention) to appear in Helmsley&#x27;s place. After Hart won the match, WWF Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter declared the disguise to be so convincing that he upheld the decision and awarded the championship to Hart. On the March 2 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Owen defended the title against Mark Henry. During the match, Chyna came to the ring and pushed Hart off the turnbuckle allowing Henry to lock on a bearhug, but before Owen could submit, Chyna delivered a blatant low blow to Henry, resulting in a disqualification in favor of Hart. The following week in a match against Barry Windham, Hart landed awkwardly on his ankle, suffering a sprained ankle with ligament damage as a result. On a special Tuesday edition of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; on March 17, Hart joined the commentary team with a supportive cast on his leg. This would bring Triple H to ringside, where he goaded Owen into an impromptu title defense despite his cast. During the match, Chyna appeared and struck Owen&#x27;s ankle with a baseball bat, allowing Helmsley to capitalize and win the title back.
Due to his jealousy over the attention his wife and valet, Sable, was garnering from the crowd, Marc Mero would try to intentionally cover up Sable&#x27;s provocative clothing and eventually send her to the back during his matches, replacing her with The Artist Formerly Known as Goldust, who at the time was dressing up from week-to-week in his own bid of self-attention. Although the two initially worked well together, Goldust&#x27;s valet Luna Vachon grew vocally disdainful of Sable, who was also being mocked by Mero and Goldust, causing Sable to eventually grow tired of the disrespect and fight back. As the two women brawled, their partners tried to separate them; but when Goldust grabbed Sable in order to restrain her, Mero&#x27;s jealousy took over and he attacked him. The two men then had a match on Raw, where both women were handcuffed to the ring posts in an effort to prevent their brawling. But after the referee was knocked down, Goldust stole the key and unchained Luna who attacked Sable with make up, painting her face before also throwing water on her. Goldust then challenged Mero and Sable to a mixed tag team match at WrestleMania XIV.

After successively beating members of the Nation of Domination week after week, Ken Shamrock initially defeated the Intercontinental Champion Rocky Maivia (later known as The Rock) at the Royal Rumble despite being hit with a foreign object, seemingly winning the title. However, The Rock convinced the referee that it was, in fact, he who suffered an illegal attack and the referee reversed his decision (Maivia had placed the foreign object in Shamrock&#x27;s trunks after hitting him with it). The following month at No Way Out of Texas: In Your House, Shamrock capitalized on the in-fighting of the Nation, due to leadership disputes between Faarooq and The Rock, by making the champion tap out in a ten-man tag team match.

At the end of the inaugural Hell in a Cell match at Badd Blood: In Your House, just as The Undertaker looked to win the match against Shawn Michaels, the lights went out and a huge masked man came to the ring and delivered a tombstone piledriver to the shocked Undertaker. The masked man was revealed to be Kane, Undertaker&#x27;s (kayfabe) half-brother and, despite the animosity and the presence of Paul Bearer, Undertaker vowed never to fight his little brother. Before Undertaker&#x27;s casket match with Michaels at the Royal Rumble, D-Generation X claimed Kane had joined them, but in fact, he came to the ring to assist Undertaker. The alliance was short-lived, however, as during the Royal Rumble, Kane came to the ring and turned on his brother, allowing Michaels to win the match before locking Undertaker in the casket and setting it ablaze, presuming his brother dead. On the March 2 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Kane&#x27;s scheduled opponent, Stone Cold Steve Austin, was taken out by D-Generation X before the match could begin. With nothing else to do, Bearer ordered the timekeeper to deliver a ten-bell salute for The Undertaker&#x27;s passing, before then telling Kane to tombstone him. After he did, more bells were heard ringing, this time signaling Undertaker&#x27;s arrival. The ringing continued much longer than normal, with Bearer vehemently denying the possibility of it being Undertaker. Eventually, a sarcophagus appeared on the top of the ramp. After the sarcophagus was struck by a bolt of lightning, The Undertaker sat up before revealing that he had been to Hell and talked with his parents, telling them that he would have to go back on his vow before finally challenging Kane to a match at WrestleMania. The week before WrestleMania, Kane came to the ring and began to display similar supernatural powers as his brother, striking the TitanTron with lightning, as well as the announce table, before finally striking a crew worker with lightning, setting him on fire; Undertaker was shown on the same episode speaking to his parents&#x27; gravestones, revealing it may have to take the damnation of his soul to reunite the troubled family.

In January, Stone Cold Steve Austin won the Royal Rumble match while Shawn Michaels retained his WWF Championship, all while Mike Tyson looked on from the director&#x27;s box. The following night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Vince McMahon was set to reveal that Tyson would be the special guest referee for WrestleMania&#x27;s main event; however, Austin appeared and gave the finger to Tyson, offering him a fight and proclaiming the wrestling ring to be his, not Tyson&#x27;s. Austin and Tyson then engaged in a massive brawl that garnered headlines all around the world. At the ensuing press conference, McMahon officially announced that due to the explosive situation, Tyson&#x27;s role was being changed to that of ring enforcer. On the February 2 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, in a scheduled match against Road Dogg, D-Generation X stormed the match and tied Austin in the ropes, allowing Shawn Michaels to hurl insults at Austin and rub the championship belt in his face, taunting him with it until Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie came to his aid. The following week, Austin stole the championship belt from Michaels in the hope of baiting him into a singles match, but the partnership of D-Generation X and The New Age Outlaws continued, allowing Michaels to retrieve the belt back. This all led to a &quot;non-sanctioned&quot; eight-man tag match at No Way Out of Texas: In Your House, which Michaels was unable to participate in due to a back injury; Austin won the match for his team by pinning Road Dogg. With WrestleMania drawing closer, on the March 2 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Mike Tyson appeared once again to be interviewed by Vince McMahon, only for DX to interrupt; Shawn Michaels then challenged Tyson to a fight. After both men&#x27;s entourages left the ring, the two taunted each other for a bit until Michaels would rip off Tyson&#x27;s shirt, revealing a DX T-shirt underneath, showing the enforcer&#x27;s degenerate alliance; Later in the evening, as Austin came out to take place in a match against Kane, Triple H appeared on the ramp and lured Austin to him. Austin fell for the trap, and promptly turned around into a Sweet Chin Music by Michaels which knocked him out, a trap which occurred again the following week. Also that week, during a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Tuesday broadcast of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; on March 17, Austin called out Vince McMahon and verbally berated him for describing Mike Tyson as &quot;the baddest man on the planet&quot;, but McMahon would not be goaded into a fight, as he instead forced Austin to fight Rocky Maivia the following episode, just before WrestleMania.

== Event ==
Chris Warren and The DX Band opened the show by performing hard rock versions of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. The audience did not react well to the performance, booing the band during and after their songs. This segment was edited off all subsequent home video releases, as well as the WWE Network and Peacock.

=== Preliminary matches ===
The night began with the mystery entrants in the tag team battle royal being revealed as the reunited Legion of Doom, now known as LOD 2000, with Sunny as their new valet. Savio Vega was first eliminated by Chainz meaning his tag team partner, Miguel Perez, had to leave too. Kurrgan illegally entered the ring to enact revenge on Sniper and Recon by eliminating them on behalf of The Jackyl. Barry Windham also illegally entered to eliminate Chainz, and so left his partner Bradshaw. The final four teams lasted a while until Skull would be eliminated by Henry Godwinn, which meant The Disciples of Apocalypse were eliminated. 8-Ball then eliminated Phineas Godwinn, which meant The Godwinns were then eliminated. Afterwards, The Godwinns attacked LOD 2000 with slop buckets before leaving. The Midnight Express tried to keep Animal out of the ring while double-teaming Hawk, but once Animal re-entered the ring, LOD 2000 simultaneously eliminated both Bob and Bart, leaving LOD 2000 the last team standing and the winners of the battle royal.

The second match was a Light Heavyweight Championship match, with Taka Michinoku defending his title against Águila; this would be the first and only time the championship was defended at WrestleMania, though its successor, the Cruiserweight Championship would be defended at the event more than once. After throwing Taka out the ring and baseball sliding into him, Águila hit an asai moonsault outside the ring, but was soon the victim of a springboard crossbody after Taka reversed a suplex from the apron. Águila almost won the match with a moonsault crossbody into a pin, but remained on the offensive with a frankensteiner. Taka tried to land the Michinoku Driver, but as Aguila flipped out and attempted a hurricanrana, Taka managed a powerbomb reversal. Taka then stopped a high flying dive attempt by Aguila with a dropkick, before successfully executing a Michinoku Driver and picking up the win. After the match, both contestants shook each other&#x27;s hand and celebrated together. Also, partway into the matchup, Jim Ross made a fleeting comment about the date of Taka&#x27;s title win, December 7, the date of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, calling it &quot;ironic enough&quot;. This incident went largely unnoticed, only causing a slight stir in the wrestling community.

Triple H made his way to the ring with his theme being played by the DX Band. Before Owen Hart came to the ring, Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter handcuffed himself to Chyna so that she would not interfere, despite her protestations. The match began with Hart pummeling Helmsley with fists before sliding out of the ring. Triple H tried to jump from the apron onto Hart, but made contact with the crowd barrier instead. After executing a powerbomb, Hart attempted to lock in the sharpshooter, but Helmsley reversed it and started some offensive maneuvers of his own, kicking Hart in the turnbuckle and delivering a suplex. Hart then suffered a cut to the bridge of his nose from a boot to the face, after which Triple H began to work on Hart&#x27;s damaged ankle, dropping his knee onto it and stretching it. After avoiding another kick to the face and crouching Helmsley onto the ring post, Owen managed to take advantage, reversing a Pedigree attempt into the sharpshooter. Chyna, having to pull Slaughter, pulled Triple H to the rope for the break. As Slaughter was distracted, Chyna then threw white powder into Slaughter&#x27;s face, causing the referee a worried Hart to check on him. While the referee was distracted and as Owen turned around to confront Triple H, Chyna low-blowed him from outside, allowing Triple H to successfully nail the Pedigree and retain the title. After she was freed from the handcuffs, Chyna nailed Slaughter with a forearm and shoved him over the barricade into the crowd.

Next up was the mixed tag team match. Marc Mero and Goldust began the match, but Goldust soon tagged in Luna Vachon, requiring Sable to be tagged in too, as per the rules. However, Vachon simply ran around the outside of the ring with Sable chasing her, before tagging Goldust back in. Wanting to get her hands on Vachon, Sable double-teamed Goldust with a boot to the face after an Irish whip from Mero, but could not get Vachon to enter the ring. A near-pinfall came from a running crossbody from Mero and following this, the two ran into each other, causing both men to crawl and tag in the women. Sable then took Luna down and punched her around the face before kicking her in the midsection and face in the turnbuckle and attacking Goldust, before running back to clothesline Vachon over the ropes. Vachon tagged Goldust in, but before Sable would do the same, she struck him in the face, then let Mero take over who had his TKO reversed into a DDT. Mero would then reverse the Curtain Call, allowing him the chance to try a moonsault pin to a standing Goldust. After Vachon struck a running Mero with her knee, Mero went to punch her, but ducked out of the way as Goldust ran to her rescue, causing him to inadvertently knock her off the apron. Mero then executed the TKO, but Luna interrupted the pin count, jumping on Mero&#x27;s back resulting in Sable tagging in as Mero wandered around the ring with Vachon on his back. Sable tried pinning Goldust, but the referee was distracted and as he finally began to count, Sable leapt off Goldust so the interfering Vachon would inadvertently bodysplash Goldust. Sable then performed a powerbomb and Mero&#x27;s TKO to win the bout.

Gennifer Flowers, who was accompanied by Jeff Jarrett and Tennessee Lee, then came to the ring as the special guest ring announcer for the upcoming Intercontinental Championship match between Ken Shamrock and Rocky Maivia. The fight began in the aisleway with a brawl that saw Shamrock get whipped into the steel steps before both men entered the ring. Maivia then delivered his People&#x27;s Elbow, but could not secure a three-count. Shamrock then rolled out of the ring and grabbed a steel chair; when the referee tried to take it off him, he threw the referee into the corner; Maivia quickly grabbed the chair and hit Shamrock with it as the referee recovered. Shamrock kicked out and quickly re-gained the advantage, delivering a belly-to-belly suplex off an Irish whip and then securing his ankle lock submission in the center of the ring, making Maivia tap to win the match and the title. The surrounding members of the Nation quickly jumped into the ring, but Shamrock dispatched them all with suplexes, including the four hundred pound Mark Henry, before then reapplying the ankle lock to a bloody Maivia. Faarooq then ran down from the back and jumped onto the apron, only to look on at Maivia with a smile, before walking away. A number of referees (the ones Shamrock attacked were actually independent wrestlers, or stuntmen put in referee uniforms) and officials would appear, trying to subdue Shamrock. After being surrounded, Shamrock suplexed a referee and then an official before calming down as Maivia was wheeled away on a gurney. Howard Finkel then announced Shamrock had been disqualified for not breaking his ankle lock submission, meaning The Rock would retain the Intercontinental championship. This would cause Shamrock to become enraged and chase Rocky, and dump him off of the gurney and fighting him on the Chris Warren band stage.

The WWF Tag Team Championship match was a &quot;Dumpster match&quot;, the objective being the first tag team to put their opponents into a dumpster with the lids being closed shut would be the winners. The match began with Billy Gunn facing Chainsaw Charlie and Road Dogg exchanging blows with Cactus Jack. Trying a cannonball on Road Dogg from the apron, Cactus missed and slammed himself into the dumpster instead. The Outlaws then focused on Charlie, using a back drop to deposit him into the dumpster and, as he attempted to climb out, they simultaneously slammed the lid shut on the hardcore legends&#x27; heads. With Cactus and Charlie both in the dumpster, the Outlaws shut the lid down on them, but Cactus managed to get back up while the Outlaws were celebrating and pushed Road Dogg down to the ground with a mandible claw, pulling him into the dumpster. Both teams took time to recover and began to brawl with weapons in the ring, Cactus Jack pulling out a ladder and climbing it opposite Billy Gunn, only for both men to be pushed off straight into the dumpster outside the ring, thanks to a dazed Chainsaw Charlie. Road Dogg pulled his partner out and the two then focused their efforts on Charlie, powerbombing him into the dumpster, but Cactus had managed to escape in the meantime. The fight eventually found its way to the backstage area, with both Outlaws throwing Cactus into boxes and promotional displays, but Jack replied with a chair shot to both of them and planted Billy Gunn onto a wooden pallet with a double-arm DDT. Charlie then reappeared on a forklift and elevated the wooden pallet as Jack dragged Road Dogg onto it too. Charlie then drove the forklift above a backstage dumpster and dropped both opponents inside as Cactus Jack closed the lid to win the WWF Tag Team Championship.

=== Main event matches ===
Before The Undertaker&#x27;s match with Kane, baseball record-holder Pete Rose came to the ring as the special ring announcer. However, after insulting the hometown team and introducing Kane, he received a tombstone piledriver, starting a tri-year tradition. The Undertaker was preceded by a league of torch-bearing druids to the tune of &quot;O Fortuna&quot;. As the match began, The Undertaker cornered Kane and threw a flurry of punches into him, ducking and reversing Kane&#x27;s attempts until Kane hit him with a clothesline that he instantly sat up from. Kane then set Undertaker up in a tree of woe to begin his assault of punches and Irish whips, before suplexing Undertaker onto the ropes and delivering a flying club to the neck from the turnbuckle. As The Undertaker began to fight back, Kane threw him into the ropes, but Undertaker retaliated by jumping onto his back, which was met a face-first electric chair. Paul Bearer kept the referee distracted while Kane landed the steel steps onto Undertaker, and repeated the effort a second time while Undertaker was lying on the steps, crushing him in-between them. As the referee tried to keep Kane in check, Bearer slapped Undertaker while walking past him. Kane caught his brother running and delivered a chokeslam, but Undetaker lifted his shoulders off the mat before the three-count could be made. Kane put The Undertaker into a sleeper hold that he eventually fought out of with a flurry of punches. Undertaker then dropped Kane on top of the ropes and punched him off the apron; he followed this with an over the top rope suicide dive that Kane managed to sidestep, sending Undertaker crashing through the Spanish announce table. As Undertaker made it back into the ring, Kane hit him with a flying lariat. Undertaker then attempted to give Kane the Tombstone Piledriver, but Kane managed to shift his weight, reversing the positions and allowing Kane to deliver the tombstone to Undertaker instead. Undertaker kicked out and after landing a running clothesline, Undertaker choke slammed Kane and then delivered a tombstone piledriver of his own; but Kane kicked out. This would mark the first time anyone had ever kicked out of Undertaker&#x27;s tombstone piledriver. It would take three tombstones with a guillotine leg drop and flying clothesline in between to stop Kane. But in the end, Undertaker scored the pin and was victorious. As soon as the match was over, Bearer attacked Undertaker and ordered Kane to attack him, which he did with a chair shot to the head and then a tombstone piledriver onto the chair. After Kane and Bearer left, Undertaker sat up and left the ring.
With Mike Tyson enforcing from ringside, the WWF Championship match began with both wrestlers taunting each other, engaging in a few light punches before Shawn Michaels escaped the ring and ran back in to take advantage of Stone Cold Steve Austin, but was met with a standing clothesline. Austin followed up by pulling down Michaels&#x27; tights, exposing Michaels&#x27; backside. Michaels then tried to run at Austin, but was back dropped over the top rope onto Triple H. As Triple H threw Austin into the crowd barrier, the referee ordered he and Chyna to leave ringside. As they were leaving Austin followed and fought with Triple H up to the entrance gate. Michaels caught up and hit Austin with a cymbal from the DX Band&#x27;s stage, before Irish whipping Austin into the dumpster. As the match resumed in the ring, Austin met Michaels&#x27;s high-risk maneuver with a clothesline and then ran him into the turnbuckle before picking him up for an inverted atomic drop. Michaels&#x27; attempt to pick up some momentum saw him picked up and dropped onto the ropes, but Michaels managed to push Austin away as he attempted a stunner. When Michaels tried to escape the ring though, Austin delivered a right hand, forcing the champion to fall upon the announce table. After Austin slowed the match down with a sleeper hold, Michaels tried to pull his knee into the ring post but was instead pulled into it himself. Austin then tried to rush at Michaels, but was back dropped into the crowd and struck with the ring bell. Michaels used the momentum to take advantage inside the ring, delivering a snapmare and then a low kick to the grounded Austin, while also taking time to taunt the audience. Austin briefly picked up some speed throwing Michaels out of the ring, but just as quickly lost ground as Michaels repeatedly worked on Austin&#x27;s left knee, throwing it into the ring post before kicking and dropping onto it back inside the ring. When Austin tried to recover outside of the ring, he was met with a baseball slide that launched him over the announce table. Austin was then thrown back into the ring by Tyson, where he soon suffered a figure-four leglock that Michaels illegally elevated using the second and third ring rope. Austin&#x27;s eventual counter was stopped by a rope break. Austin then tried to reverse a standing sleeper hold by throwing Michaels back into the turnbuckle, but unwittingly trapped referee Mike Chioda who fell unconscious. With both men on the floor, Michaels recovered with a kip-up and landed a high-flying elbow drop, getting in position for Sweet Chin Music. As Austin eventually stood up, he ducked the superkick, attempting a stunner on Michaels. Michaels responded by throwing Austin into the ropes before once again attempting Sweet Chin Music. However, Austin grabbed Michaels&#x27; foot, spun him around and nailed him with a Stone Cold Stunner. Mike Tyson jumped into the ring to make a quick three count and the new champion celebrated by tossing the enforcer an &quot;Austin 3:16&quot; t-shirt. When Shawn Michaels stood up, he confronted Tyson about his turn, but was met with a punch that instantly floored him, before Tyson then draped Michaels with Austin&#x27;s t-shirt.

== Aftermath ==
The result of the main event heralded a changing of the guard in the World Wrestling Federation. Shawn Michaels, who had been a major superstar in the WWF for many years, having won his first WWF Championship at WrestleMania two years previously, took a four-year hiatus from wrestling due to a severe back injury sustained during the casket match against The Undertaker at the Royal Rumble. During his retirement, Michaels made several ostensible one-off appearances as a guest commentator during episodes of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; in the summer of 1998, and eventually replacing Sgt. Slaughter as the WWF commissioner at the end of the year, holding onto the position for a year and a half. After what was supposed to be a one-time match four years later at SummerSlam, Michaels and the now renamed World Wrestling Entertainment realized that his injuries had healed, and he made a full-time return to wrestling, eventually retiring permanently in 2010 at WrestleMania XXVI, 12 years after this event.

With Stone Cold Steve Austin as the new WWF Champion, the &quot;Attitude Era&quot; was fully ushered in. The company&#x27;s iconic scratch logo had started to replace the &quot;New Generation&quot; logo and began to appear on ring aprons and promotional material during and after this event. The next night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot; after WrestleMania, the old WWF &quot;winged eagle&quot; world championship belt was retired, and a new belt design with a larger eagle and blue globe debuted (eventually being retired in 2002). The Attitude Era saw Austin&#x27;s feud with Vince McMahon escalate and two weeks later, &quot;Raw Is War&quot; defeated World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; in the ratings war for the first time in eighty-four weeks.

Shawn Michaels&#x27; loss was criticized by Triple H the following night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, with Triple H blaming Michaels for overlooking Tyson&#x27;s potential double-cross. Helmsley delivered a promo saying that he would now lead D-Generation X and turn it into an army, saying &quot;the first thing you do is look to your blood. You look to your buddies. You look to your friends. You look...to the Kliq&quot;, before introducing a returning Sean Waltman, now under the &quot;X-Pac&quot; persona, who had re-signed with the company after being fired from World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Later in the evening, it was revealed that Road Dogg and Billy Gunn were also part of the DX Army.

The ongoing saga between The Undertaker and Kane continued to escalate even further. The following night, Paul Bearer challenged Undertaker on behalf of Kane to a match at , where the ring would be surrounded by fire. The first man to be set ablaze would lose, thus giving birth to the Inferno Match.

By winning the fifteen-team battle royal, LOD 2000 won the right to face the WWF Tag Team Champions at Unforgiven. The champions by rights were Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie, but some legal wrangling from The New Age Outlaws saw the match held up on account of the wrong dumpster being used. The vacant titles were then decided in a steel cage match between the two teams the following night, which the Outlaws won after interference from the newly formed DX Army, concreting their ties, and by handcuffing Charlie to the cage by his neck. Charlie returned to his Terry Funk persona, whilst Cactus Jack became Dude Love again. Meanwhile, the New Age Outlaws became part of the DX Army, achieving further success.

In a tag team match against Ken Shamrock and Steve Blackman, Rocky Maivia promised to show Faarooq that the Nation was stronger and more connected than ever before. The promise was a sour one as, during the match, Rocky left Faarooq to suffer the wrath of Shamrock and Blackman. Afterwards, Faarooq demanded that Rocky come back out so the two could fight. When Rocky returned and squared up to Faarooq, the other members of the Nation turned on him, and Maivia proclaimed himself as the new &quot;ruler&quot; of the faction.

Before Marc Mero&#x27;s match with Taka Michinoku the next night, Luna Vachon appeared and challenged Sable to a singles match, which Sable promptly accepted. Vachon also announced that it was not to be a traditional wrestling match, because she wanted to humiliate Sable, and so it would be an evening gown match to be held at Unforgiven.

<text>Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL or MoFi) is a record label that specialized in the production of audiophile issues. The company produces reissued vinyl LP records, compact discs, and Super Audio CDs and other formats.

== History ==
Recording engineer Brad Miller (1939–1998) released the first recordings on the Mobile Fidelity label in March 1958, a recording of a Southern Pacific steam locomotive. Later LPs included other steam trains, environmental sounds and orchestral music, and a few pop and orchestral recordings. In 1977 Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs was founded and began releasing Original Master Recording LPs, using a half-speed mastering process.

From 1985-1992, MoFi sourced recordings from the Soviet Union’s Melodiya Records archives. In November 1999, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab shut down after the bankruptcy of M. S. Distributing. In 2001 MFSL&#x27;s assets were acquired by Jim Davis of Music Direct.

== Products ==
=== LPs ===

In 1977, Mobile Fidelity began to produce a line of records known as &quot;Original Master Recording&quot; vinyl LPs. These albums were previously released by other companies, licensed by Mobile Fidelity, and remastered using half-speed mastering from the original analog master tapes, without compression, and with minimal equalization. The recordings were pressed in Japan using a plastic compound invented by JVC, and marketed as &quot;Supervinyl&quot; by Mobile Fidelity.

In 2016, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab launched a new vinyl series called Ultradisc One-Step, releasing titles including Santana&#x27;s &quot;Abraxas&quot; and Bill Evans&#x27;s &quot;Sunday at the Village Vanguard&quot;.

=== Cassettes, CDs, and SACDs ===

During the mid-1980s, Mobile Fidelity began to sell CDs and cassettes. In the 2000s, it began to sell SACDs.

=== MoFi Electronics ===
In 2016 an audio electronics line was introduced under the MoFi banner. MoFi Electronics offices and turntable manufacturing are based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

== Audio sourcing controversy ==
On July 14, 2022, Michael Esposito, a record store owner and YouTuber, released a video on his YouTube channel &quot;The &#x27;In&#x27; Groove&quot; stating that &quot;pretty reliable sources&quot; informed him that, contrary to the company&#x27;s official statements and marketing, MFSL had been using digital masters instead of analogue for years. John Wood, the label&#x27;s executive president, saw Esposito&#x27;s video and then invited him to California for a tour of their business. A second video was produced with Esposito interviewing MFSL staff, where they confirmed that they were using Direct Stream Digital files when creating their vinyl masters for duplication. The staff members stated that at least 60% of all titles used this process by the end of 2011, and that the process was also being used for the label&#x27;s Ultradisc One-Step releases, which were previously marketed as coming directly from the original master tapes. The revelation generated controversy over not only Mobile Fidelity&#x27;s integrity, given the company&#x27;s marketing and the stigmatization of digital audio in audiophile circles, but also the extent of analog audio&#x27;s perceived merits over digital audio. The scandal became known as &quot;MoFi Gate&quot; (combining an abbreviation of &quot;Mobile Fidelity&quot; with the &quot;-gate&quot; suffix derived from the Watergate scandal) in audiophile communities.

In August 2022, Adam Stiles, a longtime customer of Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, filed a class action fraud lawsuit against the label over the revelations. The lawsuit resulted in MFSL paying $25 million in damages.

In 1992, CNN International started the &quot;Noticiero CNN Internacional&quot;, the first in Spanish on that channel. Other programs in Spanish were &quot;Las Noticias&quot; and &quot;Noticias México&quot;, all of them presented by the Colombian Patricia Janiot and the Uruguayan Jorge Gestoso, and with the direction of Rolando Santos. The following year, CNN en Español Radio was launched.

===Launch (1997)===

On March 17, 1997, CNN en Español began broadcasting 24 hours a day. In addition, the chain&#x27;s production centers begin to operate in Buenos Aires and Havana. The correspondent in the Cuban capital was the first office of a U.S. organization on the island.

The channel was added to the Sky Brasil platform on the first week of April 1997.

On February 15, 2017, Venezuela&#x27;s National Commission of Telecommunications (Conatel) blocked CNN en Español from any national TV provider, saying a report from the network regarding passport fraud was &quot;a threat to the peace and democratic stability&quot; of the nation. Conatel additionally blocked sister network CNN International and BBC World News on April 30, 2019 during an uprising attempt.

On September 22, 2022, CNN en Español was taken off the air from all cable providers in Nicaragua by order of the Nicaraguan Institute of Telecommunications and Post Office (TELCOR).

<doc id="1258502" wikidata="Q50876" url="?curid=1258502" title="WrestleMania XV">
<text>WrestleMania XV was the 15th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on March 28, 1999, at the First Union Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Ten professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event&#x27;s card. The ticket sales of 20,276 drew a gross of $1,437,050.

The main event saw the challenger Stone Cold Steve Austin face The Rock in a no disqualification match for the WWF Championship. The penultimate match saw The Undertaker wrestle Big Boss Man in a Hell in a Cell match. Lower on the card, six of the promotion&#x27;s seven active championships were defended, including the first WrestleMania defense of the Hardcore Championship. Also on the undercard was a Brawl for All match, an unscripted type of shootfight between wrestler Bart Gunn and boxer/mixed martial artist Butterbean. This event also marked the final WWF appearance for Gorilla Monsoon, who died in October that year.

==Production==
===Background===

WrestleMania is the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF, now WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of the WWF&#x27;s original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the &quot;Big Four&quot;, and was considered one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; pay-per-views, along with King of the Ring. WrestleMania XV was scheduled on March 28, 1999, at the First Union Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

===Storylines===
When Road Dogg Jesse James and &quot;Bad Ass&quot; Billy Gunn lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to The Corporation, they tried their hand at singles wrestling for some time. Gunn failed in his attempts to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship, but Road Dogg becoming Hardcore Champion until an injury prevented him from honoring a championship match with Al Snow. Snow ended up fighting himself and then Bob Holly for the vacant belt at St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre: In Your House, with Holly winning the title at the banks of the Mississippi River. When Road Dogg won the Intercontinental Championship on &quot;Raw Is War&quot; Gunn fought Holly (now Hardcore Holly) and won when Holly crashed into an ad-hoc announcers table Jim Ross had constructed for his pirate broadcast of the show. Holly felt enraged that circumstances had conspired against him, while Snow still wanted another chance at the belt.

In the previous year, due to the suddenly enlarged roster, a shootfighting (unscripted) knockout tournament titled Brawl for All was organized on a voluntary basis, with Bart Gunn winning the tournament on August 24 after defeating every opponent by knockout aside from his opening-round opponent Bob Holly. When Holly rechristened himself Hardcore Holly on February 15, decrying poor gimmicks and tag-team partners he had been given in the past, Gunn made his first appearance since winning the tournament, to remind Holly that not all his partners were of a poor caliber. After a hardcore match between the two, which Gunn dominated until a masked assailant, revealed to be &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams, threw him off the stage. Williams did this out of revenge for losing to Gunn in the Brawl for All. The week after on Raw Is War, Williams&#x27; manager Jim Ross announced to Gunn he would be facing noted mixed martial artist and boxer Eric &quot;Butterbean&quot; Esch, who held a 43–1–1 record at the time, who challenged him to a Brawl for All fight.

From November&#x27;s Survivor Series until the night after St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre, The Rock and Mankind (Mick Foley) traded the WWF Championship numerous times as Mr. McMahon screwed Mankind time and time again on his quest to headline WrestleMania. In their final match, a &quot;Raw Is War&quot; ladder match, Paul Wight delivered the Showstopper to Mankind as he was about to win the match, removing his chances of appearing the main event. However, as Mr. McMahon&#x27;s conspiracy of appointing Big Show as special guest referee to secure The Rock as champion began to fall apart, Mankind constantly offered his services as a second official. With The Rock and Big Show causing infighting in the Corporation, Mankind successfully canvassed for a chance to referee; rather than have two conflicting referees, a match was booked to give the winner the right to officiate.

When Ryan Shamrock (Alicia Webb) appeared front row on &quot;Raw Is War&quot; on January 11, she gained attention not only from her brother but also Val Venis, who performed a flirtatious dance for her, and &quot;Badd Ass&quot; Billy Gunn, who lived up to his moniker by mooning her. Enraged, Ken Shamrock fought Gunn at the Royal Rumble, then Venis at St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre, with Venis winning the Intercontinental Championship thanks to help from Ryan. Venis soon dumped Ryan, and she began a relationship with Goldust (Dustin Rhodes). Venis also unwittingly lost his championship to Road Dogg on &quot;Raw Is War&quot; and found himself defending his championship against the important men in Ryan Shamrock&#x27;s life in a four-corners elimination match.

After The Rock won his &quot;I Quit&quot; match against Mankind at the Royal Rumble by playing a recording of his voice, Triple H demanded an I Quit match of his own, but as he was about to put Rock through the announcers table, The Corporation came to the ring and Kane held his manager/girlfriend Chyna hostage, demanding that he quit the match. As soon as the match was over, Chyna low blowed Triple H and revealed her alliances with The Corporation, promising a Valentine&#x27;s Day present at the subsequent pay-per-view. Despite almost having the match won, Triple H suffered at the hands of an interfering Shane McMahon and illegal man Kane&#x27;s chokeslam. Triple H took revenge on the February 22 &quot;Raw Is War&quot; by interfering in X-Pac&#x27;s (Sean Waltman) match with Chyna, causing her to lose. Chyna called Triple H out on March 8, but before they could fight, Kane came to the ring. Chyna held up Triple H as Kane shot a fireball at him, though he would duck out of the way causing (kayfabe) severe retinal damage to Chyna. Despite not receiving any damage, Triple H maintained that the fireball was meant for him, an insult he took personally and an intended injury he wanted to return at WrestleMania. On March 22, Kane prepared to have a match against Goldust, but as he threw off his entrance robes and wig, it turned out he was Triple H holding a flamethrower, shooting flames in Kane&#x27;s face. Meanwhile, X-Pac, who had altercations with Shane McMahon prior to the February event, was frustrated with Shane&#x27;s interference in the match and goaded into putting his European Championship on the line in a tag-team match with Triple H against Kane and Shane, which Shane won thanks to Triple H being distracted by Chyna. With Shane claiming himself to be a fighting champion, he agreed to a rematch at WrestleMania, but regularly interfered in X-Pac&#x27;s matches up until that point, culminating in a Greenwich Street Fight on March 22 that ended in a no-contest when the Mean Street Posse ambushed X-Pac and drove off with Shane in their car.

Tori was sitting front row as a plant as early as September 14&#x27;s &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, but it was not until late December that she began to act with stalker tendencies, sending flowers and notes to Sable, the Women&#x27;s Champion and even helping her to defend her title against Luna Vachon at the Royal Rumble. On &quot;Raw Is War&quot; the night after the previous pay-per-view, Tori invaded the ring again and was publicly shouted at and humiliated by Sable. Vachon then brought Tori to the ring a fortnight after, reprimanding Sable for her ego, but a still-obsessed Tori helped attack Vachon. The following week on March 8&#x27;s &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Tori fought Vachon with Sable in her corner but after receiving a squash from Vachon, Sable also gave Tori a Sable Bomb, leading to Tori interrupting Sable&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot; interview by demanding a championship match at WrestleMania.

Having been buried alive in a Royal Rumble qualification match at Rock Bottom: In Your House, The Undertaker disappeared from television while The Acolytes, Faarooq (Ron Simmons) and Bradshaw (John Layfield), began to act strangely, eventually abducting Dennis Knight and leaving him tied up in a darkened room. On January 11, The Undertaker returned in slightly new attire, taking a seat in a ceremonial throne on the &quot;Raw Is War&quot; stage while Paul Bearer stood beside him and The Acolytes brought Knight out and tied him to a table. There, Undertaker performed a ritualistic ceremony, rechristening him Mideon. Undertaker began delivering ambiguous apocalyptic messages, but after recruiting Mabel, now Viscera (Nelson Frazier, Jr.) and The Brood, he began to be more direct, revealing his plan to attack Mr. McMahon and take over the World Wrestling Federation.

The security of Mr. McMahon&#x27;s Corporation, Big Boss Man, challenged the Ministry to a six-man tag team match, which ended in a no-contest when the Ministry abducted Shane McMahon and took him to Undertaker, who threatened him while choking him then gave him a letter to give to his father. McMahon replied the following week on February 22 by booking The Undertaker in an Inferno match with Kane on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, the first network television airing of that type of match. During the match, McMahon provided commentary, nonchalantly revealing he had placed Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match against Big Boss Man for WrestleMania. During the match, Paul Bearer gave an ominous gift to McMahon, a teddy bear. After Undertaker set Kane on fire, he turned to the enraged McMahon, taking the teddy bear (later revealed to belong to Stephanie McMahon) and setting it alight, reducing Vince to his knees. Trying to defeat either of his problems, McMahon declared he&#x27;d never show such weakness again and put Mankind against Undertaker, which ended with Undertaker almost chokeslamming McMahon through the announcers table until Boss Man saved him. Undertaker continued with his mind games on March 8, ordering his Ministry to look for Boss Man all night and attacking any innocents in his way, eventually capturing Boss Man and crucifying him. Boss Man managed to escape while police were being beaten off by Undertaker&#x27;s minions until he offered himself to the police while being derided by McMahon. The following week he continued his assault, with videos playing throughout the evening of the Ministry at McMahon&#x27;s mansion ending in McMahon coming to the ring while Triple H brawled with Kane, begging Kane to help him. Kane ripped off his mask to reveal it was actually The Undertaker who grabbed McMahon by the throat as the lights turned off in the arena and when they came up, he was gone with McMahon alone in the ring.

The main event of the evening was another chapter in the ongoing rivalry between Stone Cold Steve Austin and McMahon, which dated back to when Austin won the Royal Rumble in 1998. After Austin won the WWF Championship at WrestleMania XIV, McMahon set on a six-month-long quest to take the championship from him. With the exception of a one day reign by Kane, who won the championship in a First Blood Match at King of the Ring when his (kayfabe) brother The Undertaker caused Austin to bleed first, Austin thwarted each attempt by McMahon until in September 1998. There, Austin defended the championship against Undertaker and Kane in what was billed as a triple threat match. McMahon added a stipulation, however, that neither brother could pin the other to win the match; this led to both men simultaneously pinning Austin, causing him to lose the match and the championship. This had been part of a deal McMahon had made with the two men to protect him from Austin, with the reward of the championship if they were successful. However, McMahon went back on his word after Austin attacked him on the next night’s &quot;Raw&quot; and announced he was forcing Undertaker and Kane to wrestle for the vacant championship at Judgment Day: In Your House. He also named Austin the special guest referee, hoping to humiliate him by forcing him to declare a new champion. Austin, however, had other ideas and counted both men out, declaring himself the winner of the match and leaving the championship vacant.

A &quot;Deadly Games&quot; tournament was scheduled for Survivor Series in November, in which it turned out that The Rock, not Mankind, was McMahon&#x27;s choice for winner and had the tournament manipulated to his advantage, while Austin lost in a match when McMahon&#x27;s son Shane, acting as referee, refused to count a pinfall to go to the finals. Knowing Rock would be busy feuding with Mankind, McMahon realized Austin was likely to use the 1999 Royal Rumble, rather than a personal attack, to attempt to reclaim the belt and laid down the stipulation that he must win a Buried Alive match against The Undertaker to be in the Rumble. When he did, with some help from Kane, McMahon further tried to prevent Austin winning back the championship by &quot;randomly&quot; drawing him as the first entrant in the Rumble and drawing himself as the 30th. Having annoyed commissioner Shawn Michaels, McMahon was placed into the match as the second entrant. McMahon would later try to incentivize other wrestlers to eliminate Austin by putting a $100,000 bounty on him during the Royal Rumble match.

Despite this, Austin (and, for that matter, McMahon) managed to stay in the match to the very end, although this was mostly due to he and McMahon leaving the ring at various points to brawl around the arena. Late in the match The Rock, who earlier in the evening had regained the WWF Championship, came to the ring and started arguing with Austin. McMahon took advantage of the distraction and threw Austin over the top rope, thus winning the match.

Since he was officially now the winner of the Royal Rumble, McMahon was entitled to face whoever the WWF Champion was at WrestleMania. On the following night&#x27;s episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, however, he announced that, since he was only a part-timer and the champion was a fellow Corporation member in The Rock, that he had filed paperwork relinquishing his WrestleMania championship opportunity and that he would be naming a replacement later in the evening. To his chagrin, Austin and Michaels informed him shortly thereafter that, according to the rules, his actions resulted in Austin, as the runner-up in the Royal Rumble, taking his place.

With McMahon irate, Austin revealed he was willing to put his place on the line and not headline WrestleMania if McMahon would give him the opportunity to fight him one on one with no interference from The Corporation; if McMahon could beat him, Austin would not go to WrestleMania. Their steel-cage match at St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre mostly consisted of McMahon running away, but eventually the two fought with Austin winning the match under unusual circumstances when Big Show made his debut, coming from under the ring and throwing Austin into the cage with the walls of it coming open, meaning that Austin had inadvertently won.

==Event==
===Pre-show===
The event was marked with a &quot;Rage Party&quot; the preceding evening at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, playing on the tagline of the event, much like &quot;Fan Axess&quot; that would come in later years. It included music from Isaac Hayes, Big Pun, and the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies.

During the &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; pre-show, Jacqueline (Jacqueline Moore) pinned Ivory (Lisa Moretti) after a back suplex. After the match, Terri Runnels burned her cigar into Ivory&#x27;s cheek. The second &quot;Heat&quot; match saw a 21-man battle royal match with the last two competitors becoming a tag team for the evening to face the Tag Team Championship holders. In the event, D&#x27;Lo Brown and Test (Andrew Martin) were the last two, still fighting without realizing the match was over when Droz (Darren Drozdov) and The Godfather (Charles Wright) eliminated each other. The show officially began with Boyz II Men singing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; in the ring before the opening video.

===Preliminary matches===
The inaugural WrestleMania Hardcore Championship match began with Al Snow striking Billy Gunn as he tried to make a pre-match speech. With Gunn in the corner, Snow fought with Hardcore Holly outside the ring, wrapping his neck in cable but, after some fighting from Gunn, Holly was able to suplex Snow. After Gunn again interjected himself, Snow was able to go underneath the mat to find some weapons including a Philadelphia Flyers hockey stick much to the delight of the crowd. The match ended when Gunn put Snow through a table in the corner, originally intended for Gunn and then used the Fameasser on Snow, driving him into a chair on the mat. As the referee counted, Holly struck Gunn with a weapon, quickly covering Snow to steal his second championship reign. The WWF Tag Team Championship match began with Jeff Jarrett and D&#x27;Lo Brown exchanging running maneuvers before both tagging in their respective partners, at which point Test used a pumphandle slam on Owen Hart, but tried again after a failed pin attempt only to be met with an enziguiri and then the Sharpshooter. Brown came in illegally to break it up but was tagged in straight afterward, dominating both Hart and Jarrett with power slams and dropkicks, almost winning the match after a Sky High that was broken up by Jarrett. Referee Jimmy Korderas was distracted when Debra (Debra Marshall) came to the apron to distract Brown only to be pulled down by Ivory (Lisa Moretti), at which point PMS (Terri Runnels and Jacqueline Moore) arrived and all of them began to fight while Test tried to pull them apart. With everyone distracted, Hart missile dropkicked Brown allowing Jarrett to roll Brown up and sit on him, securing a pin count.

The Brawl For All match began with the two meetings in the middle, Gunn running into some blows from Butterbean. The two traded punches, neither man managing to contact properly until Butterbean shook Gunn with a left-hand jab followed by a right hook which stunned Gunn allowing Bean to corner him, giving him another right hook which knocked him down. Gunn immediately came back upon his knees but took advantage of the eight seconds before standing up fully. As the fight resumed, Butterbean jabbed Gunn to the body and followed with a clean overhand right which sent Gunn back to the canvas, giving Butterbean a victory via knockout. The match lasted a total of 34 seconds. This was followed with an appearance from the San Diego Chicken, who mocked special referee Vinny Pazienza and was punched to the floor for it.

On the WWF WrestleMania special on HSN later during the pay per view, after the Shane McMahon match &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams cut a promo on Bart Gunn in a backstage interview with Jim Ross by his side, saying the Butterbean&#x27;s punch &quot;wasn&#x27;t lucky&quot; and that &quot;Bart deserved what he got&quot;, telling the viewer to keep watching WWF because &quot;the Doctor hasn&#x27;t finished his job yet&quot;. This was in hopes of setting up an angle between Williams and Gunn, and to continue building Williams as a credible midcarder. However, because of Gunn being released, their feud instead carried over to All Japan Pro Wrestling in the early 2000s, where in Japan the Brawl For All was better received.

When Mankind entered the ring he was immediately headbutted out, but as Big Show followed him out, Mankind slammed Show&#x27;s head into the steel steps. He then tried a double-armed DDT into the steps but was shoved over the steps falling backward. Show dominated Mankind in the ring afterward, using his sheer size to punch and throw Mankind, with Mankind eventually being tied up in the ropes, which allowed him to back body drop Show out of the ring. Mankind then took out Mr. Socko, a smelly gym sock, and stuffed the foul-smelling sock into the Big Show’s mouth with the mandible claw three times. The third claw came with a low blow, for which Mankind was not disqualified. When Show stood back up, he had Mankind on his back with the sock in his mouth and jumped backward so that his entire body landed on Mankind, breaking up the hold. As the two recovered, Show kicked his opponent out of the ring, grabbing a steel chair and thrusting it into Mankind&#x27;s chest then hitting it over his back. Big Show threw that chair and another in the ring, setting them both in seated positions and Show Stopping Mankind through the middle of them. At this point Earl Hebner finally decided to disqualify Big Show, with Show taking out his anger by attacking Mankind more with the chair. Mr. McMahon made his way to the ring afterward, berating Big Show for risking the WWF Championship match at which point Show grabbed him by the throat. He then thought better of it and released him, only to be met with another tirade from McMahon and a slap, causing Show to punch McMahon and knock him out.

The four corners Intercontinental match began with Ken Shamrock and Road Dogg in the ring, with the latter being thrown from corner to corner until Goldust tagged his way in, with running shoulder barges that floored Shamrock. Shamrock tagged in Venis who came in and instantly attacked Shamrock until Goldust backdropped him. Goldust tried the Curtain Call but Venis flipped over Goldust&#x27;s back only to be knocked down again by a clothesline from Goldust who then put Venis on the turnbuckle and attempted a superplex but Venis fought back and replied with a diving bulldog following with a fisherman suplex pin which would only make a two count. The two then collided in the turnbuckle, causing Goldust to fall down and Venis to fall on him, headbutting his crotch. Shamrock took a blind tag from Road Dogg, after he replaced Goldust, immediately putting an ankle lock until Venis grabbed the bottom rope. As Venis grabbed the ropes to stand up again Shamrock charged him but was tossed over the ropes as Ryan Shamrock insulted him. Venis went after Ken Shamrock and the two fought up the walkway with Shamrock running back to the ring but not fast enough to avoid a double count-out. Shamrock, not accepting the decision belly to belly suplex slammed both competitors before leaving. When they recovered Goldust Irish whipped Road Dogg but had it reversed and as Goldust ran into the ropes he had his leg caught by Ryan Shamrock, seemingly trying to grab Road Dogg&#x27;s leg. Road Dogg charged Goldust and was picked up for a powerslam but managed to roll Goldust round, crashing him into the floor and covering him for a successful pin count.

Before Kane&#x27;s match with Triple H, Kane entered the ring only to be attacked while he was performing his signature entrance by the San Diego Chicken. Kane fought back and unmasked the chicken, revealing it to be Pete Rose, trying to gain revenge for the previous year&#x27;s incident but receiving a Tombstone piledriver. Triple H also tried to ambush Kane by coming through the crowd while all eyes were on the stage entrance, hitting Kane out of the ring and then hitting him into the ring post and whipping him into the steel steps. Kane then picked Triple H up and straddled him on the crowd barrier, pushing him into the Mean Street Posse who were at ringside, picking him up again to ram his back into the steel post three times. Back inside the ring, Kane dominated Helmsley with his rough fighting style, using his foot to choke Triple H and knocking him down with clotheslines and punches until Triple H gained momentum from a reversal, smashing Kane&#x27;s face into his knee. Kane was allowed time to recover when Triple H was distracted by Chyna coming to ringside. Triple H tried to Pedigree Kane as he stood up but failed while Chyna pushed the steel steps into the ring. Kane picked them up and ran into Triple H, who used the turnbuckle to swing his feet up and kicked them back into Kane causing Kane to stagger backward and drop them before smashing his face into the steps from a drop toe-hold. Triple H then clotheslined Kane out of the ring, following himself and attempting to Pedigree Kane on the steps but was backbody dropped. When they made it back into the ring Kane chokeslammed Triple H while Chyna entered the ring with a steel chair, telling Kane she wanted to attack Triple H, but as Kane turned, Chyna hit him with the chair, causing him to corner her but again was hit with the chair, this time by Triple H, who followed it up with a Pedigree onto the chair. Chyna and Triple H celebrated the reunion of D-Generation X afterwards.
The Women&#x27;s Championship match began with Tori taking her time to enter the ring, Sable grabbing her hair when she finally did and tossing her back out. Tori regrouped outside and pulled Sable out by her legs, ramming her face into the apron and the barricade. She was whipped into the barrier herself and as she recovered, Sable performed a crossbody from the outside apron. Sable continuously assaulted Tori while down on the mat, but Tori delivered two vicious clotheslines to the corner on Sable, then attempted a sunset flip pin which began a series of pinning reversals ending in a stalemate. Afterward Tori tried a running attack on Sable but took out referee Jimmy Korderas unwittingly. Sable then tried to perform her Sable Bomb but Tori jumped out of it. As she tried to perform her own powerbomb, a muscled woman, later identified as Nicole Bass, came into the ring to gorilla press slam Tori. This allowed Sable to Sable Bomb Tori and pin her to retain the championship.

Before X-Pac could make his way to the ring Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco attacked him from behind but caused the little problem to X-Pac who beat them then ran into the ring, with Shane McMahon fleeing. Shane eventually made his way to the ring and was punched into the corner, escaping a Bronco Buster when Test pulled him out of the ring. Shane tried to escape once again but X-Pac chased him and threw him back into the ring, only to be struck down by Test and then have his crotch rammed into the ring post. When he returned to the ring Shane scoop slammed him and attempted a Corporate Elbow, with X-Pac sitting up just before the end but he was brought back down with a low blow as referee Mike Chioda was distracted by Test. Shane continued to push the disqualification boundaries by whipping X-Pac with his belt several times before being back body dropped out of the ring, recovering only to be met with a flying crossbody. The Mean Street Posse tried to restrain X-Pac but he fought back, only to be floored by Test. After a superplex, the pin-count was broken up by Test but he was soon kicked out of the ring then X-Pac whipped McMahon with the belt before round house kicking him into the corner and performing the Bronco Buster. When Chioda checked on McMahon afterward, Test struck X-Pac with the championship belt but by the time McMahon covered him he managed to kick out. Test tried to interfere but took a Bronco Buster too. Triple H and Chyna came to the ring to pull Test out but when McMahon was floored by an X Factor, Chyna distracted the referee to allow Triple H to Pedigree X-Pac and cover him with Shane, turning heel and allowing him to retain the title. The New Age Outlaws ran to the ring and brawled with Triple H and Test until the lights went out and Kane&#x27;s music began to play but by the time the lights came up The Corporation were clear of the ring and had fled.

===Main event matches===
The Hell in a Cell match began with Big Boss Man punching The Undertaker into the corner until he ducked out and returned the same. Although Boss Man was able to deliver a swinging neckbreaker, Undertaker took control again throwing Boss Man into the cell. Boss Man reversed an Irish whip and threw Undertaker into the cell too, handcuffing one hand to the chain fence. Boss Man taunted Undertaker&#x27;s lack of control before striking him repeatedly with his night stick causing Undertaker to fall to the floor and rip the handcuffs, though Boss Man carried on using the nightstick and cut Undertaker open. Undertaker fought back by grabbing Boss Man at the throat and throwing him back into the fence again, striking him with a chair and running Boss Man face-first into the chain fence with a fireman&#x27;s carry. As the two returned to the ring Boss Man tried to clothesline Undertaker but he ducked and performed a leaping flying clothesline of his own before going Old School, ultimately falling into the ropes. The two began a fistfight in the middle of the ring with Undertaker failing a tombstone piledriver attempt, but successfully performing it seconds later and pinned him afterwards. Undertaker stood up and looked to the heavens with his hands upwards, signaling The Brood to descend onto the roof of the cell. They cut open the roof of the cell and passed through a noose, securing the other end to the top of the cell. The Brood then ascended back into the rafters as Undertaker put the noose around Boss Man&#x27;s neck, with Paul Bearer causing the Cell to rise and take a hanging Boss Man with it. After the match a video package of the &quot;Rage Party&quot; was shown while Boss Man was taken down and carried off on a stretcher.
Before the main event, Michael Cole announced Jim Ross returning to call the match. Mr. McMahon then came to the ring as the special guest referee but was confronted by Commissioner Shawn Michaels, who explained that only the commissioner is entitled to appoint a referee for WrestleMania, ordering McMahon to the back and barring all members of The Corporation from ringside. The main event began with the two wrestlers insulting each other before Austin threw the first punch, The Rock instantly returning. The majority of the early part of the match took place outside the ring, with Austin being choked with a T-shirt then taking Rock through the crowd before returning into the secure area and into the crowd the opposite end. When Rock threw Austin back into the secure area he choked him on some cable and took him up the walkway, but Austin fought out of his grasp and threw him into the steel barriers, trying to piledrive him but being backbody dropped so that his knee landed onto light support girders. Rock picked up Austin and threw him into the WrestleMania XV sign but Austin circled round and threw Rock into them instead, then dragged him back towards the ring having a suplex reversed on the concrete walkway. Rock then tried to throw Austin back through the crowd at ringside, spitting water in his face but Austin took control and put him onto the Spanish announce table, performing two elbow drops to break the table and then spat water into Rock&#x27;s face. Austin threw his opponent into the ring, celebrating to the crowd but when he entered the ring Rock sprang up and drove Austin into the floor with a Rock Bottom, following with an unsuccessful pin cover. The Rock grabbed a chair but Austin took it from him, Rock blocked the oncoming chair shot by pulling referee Mike Chioda in front of him, who took the chair shot. Rock then caught Austin by surprise with a swinging neckbreaker, taking the chair and driving it into Austin&#x27;s back several times. After another pin attempt, with Tim White now officiating, Austin still kicked out and Rock used a sitting chin hold to subdue him. After holding him for some time, Austin slowly stood up, elbowing Rock and attempting a running attack but was taken out with a Samoan drop, which Austin again kicked out of. The Rock took his frustration out on White, Rock Bottoming him, which gave Austin the time to recover and attack the champion with a Stone Cold Stunner, with Earl Hebner eventually coming in to officiate but only counting to two before Rock kicked out. Mr. McMahon came to the ring, distracting Austin while The Rock low-blowed him; the two men kicking away at Austin in the corner and punching Hebner when he tried to stop them. As the two double-teamed Austin, Mankind came running to the ring in his referee&#x27;s uniform, throwing McMahon straight out the ring and taking over as referee. Austin tried a roll-up pin, following up with a Lou Thesz Press but Rock soon took the advantage with another Rock Bottom. With Austin in the middle of the ring, The Rock tried the Corporate Elbow but Austin moved out of the way at the last second. Rock caught Austin&#x27;s foot and spun him around, trying to Rock Bottom him again but Austin elbowed him away and delivered a stunner, finally securing a pinfall and winning the WWF Championship.

==Reception==
The event was met with mixed critical response. Canadian Online Explorer&#x27;s professional wrestling section gave the entire event five out of 10 stars. The main event between The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF Championship was rated eight out of 10 stars; the Hell in a Cell match between The Undertaker and Big Boss Man was rated five out of 10 stars; the match between Shane McMahon and X-Pac for the WWF European Championship was rated seven out of 10 stars; the match between Sable and Tori for the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship was rated one out of 10 stars; the match between Triple H and Kane was rated four out of 10 stars; the referee match between Mankind and Big Show was rated four out of 10; the four-corners elimination match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship between Road Dogg Jesse James, Ken Shamrock, Goldust, and Val Venis was rated five out of 10 stars; the tag team match for the WWF Tag Team Championship between D&#x27;Lo Brown and Test against Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett was rated three out of 10 stars; and the triple threat match for the WWF Hardcore Championship between Hardcore Holly, Billy Gunn, and Al Snow was rated six out of 10 stars.

Writing for 411Mania in 2009, Rob McNew gave the event a rating of 5.5/10, stating, &quot;Like most Attitude Era shows this one doesn’t hold up very well ten years later&quot; though he praised the main event bout between Rock and Austin. Similarly, Scott Keith gave the event an overall negative rating, while calling the Rock vs. Austin match &quot;solid by default&quot; and complimenting Shane McMahon&#x27;s performance given his lack of wrestling experience. In 2012, Bleacher Report ranked the event 25th out of the 27 Wrestlemanias to that point, calling the event &quot;underwhelming&quot; and criticizing the Hell in a Cell match.

== Aftermath ==
Stone Cold Steve Austin&#x27;s feud with The Corporation continued after WrestleMania with Austin demanding the return of his customized smoking skull belt that was taken from him after losing the WWF Championship at in 1998. With The Ministry of Darkness continuing to threaten his family, Mr. McMahon was forced to comply with his nemesis&#x27; demands and requested his son Shane to deliver the belt to Austin. Shane, however, refused and took matters with Austin into his own hands by giving the smoking skull belt to The Rock. This culminated in a rematch between Austin and The Rock at Backlash while McMahon served as a special guest referee. Austin defeated The Rock to retain the WWF Championship after Mr. McMahon prevented Shane from screwing him and handed the smoking skull belt back to Austin.

The Ministry of Darkness continued their ongoing war with The Corporation with The Undertaker going after Mr. McMahon&#x27;s daughter Stephanie. The Undertaker continued to make sacrifices including Ryan Shamrock leading to a feud between Undertaker and Ken Shamrock who wanted revenge for Undertaker&#x27;s actions to his family with Undertaker defeating Shamrock at Backlash: In Your House.

When The Undertaker did successfully find Stephanie, Shamrock, in his quest to get revenge on Undertaker, continued to beat down and interrogate members of The Ministry of Darkness for McMahon&#x27;s whereabouts. After Christian told Shamrock McMahon&#x27;s whereabouts, Undertaker punished Christian by whipping him and have him face Crucifixion. Edge and Gangrel, who along with Christian were members of their own stable The Brood and were loyal to Christian decided to rescue him, betraying The Ministry. The Ministry got revenge by defeating The Brood in a Six-Man Tag Team Match at Backlash.

Bart Gunn would leave the WWF after his match against Butterbean. On the &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot; episode on the Brawl for All, Gunn said he felt his match against Butterbean was &quot;punishment&quot; for winning the Brawl and knocking out Steve &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Williams during the event (Williams suffered other injuries during the match) which was not what the bookers wanted (they wanted Williams to win to give him a push against &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin). Gunn would not return to WWF TV until 2007.

Nicole Bass continued to accompany Sable to the ring and destroyed all competition for Sable&#x27;s WWF Women&#x27;s Championship. After HHH washed his hands of D-Generation X and joined Chyna in the Corporation, X-Pac teamed up with Kane to form an unlikely tag team, and captured the WWF Tag Team titles from Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett. 
The City of Philadelphia would later host the event again in 2024 with this time being held at the nearby Lincoln Financial Field in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the event held in the city and the 40th anniversary of WrestleMania.

<doc id="1258520" wikidata="Q599348" url="?curid=1258520" title="Big Bayou Canot rail accident">
<text>On September 22, 1993, an Amtrak &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; passenger train derailed on the CSX Transportation Big Bayou Canot Bridge near Mobile, Alabama, United States. It was caused by displacement of a span and deformation of the rails when a tow of heavy barges collided with the rail bridge eight minutes earlier. Forty-seven people were killed and 103 more were injured. To date, it is the deadliest train wreck in both Amtrak&#x27;s history and Alabama&#x27;s railway history. It is also the worst rail disaster in the United States since the 1958 Newark Bay rail accident, in which 48 people died.

==Events==
Prior to the derailment, a barge pushed by the towboat &quot;Mauvilla&quot; (owned and operated by Warrior and Gulf Navigation of Chickasaw, Alabama) made a wrong turn on the Mobile River and entered the Big Bayou Canot, a channel of water closed to commercial boat traffic and crossed by a CSX Transportation rail bridge.

The towboat&#x27;s pilot, Willie Odom, was not properly trained on how to read his radar and so, due to very poor visibility in heavy fog and his lack of experience, did not realize he was off course. The boat also lacked a compass and a chart of the waters. Odom believed that he was still on the Mobile River and had identified the bridge in the radar as another tug boat. After the investigation, he was found not to be criminally liable for the incident.

The bridge was struck by the &quot;Mauvilla&quot; at about 2:45 a.m. The span had been designed to rotate so it could be converted to a swing bridge by adding appropriate equipment. No such conversion had been performed but the span had not been adequately secured against unintended movement. The collision forced the unsecured end of the bridge span approximately out of alignment and severely kinked the track.

Despite the displacement of the bridge, the continuously welded rails did not break. As a result, the track circuit controlling the bridge approach block signals remained closed (intact) and the nearest signal continued to display a clear (green) aspect. Had one of the rails been severed by the bridge&#x27;s displacement, the track circuit would have opened, causing the approach signal to display a stop (red) aspect and the preceding signal a yellow (caution) approach indication. This might have given the Amtrak engineers sufficient time to stop the train or at least reduce its speed in an effort to mitigate the accident&#x27;s severity.

At 2:53 a.m., Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; train, powered by three locomotives (one GE Genesis P40DC number 819 in the front and two EMD F40PHs, numbers 262 and 312) en route from Los Angeles, California, to Miami, Florida, with 220 passengers and crew aboard, crossed the bridge at around and derailed at the kink. The first of its three locomotives slammed into the displaced span, causing that part of the bridge to collapse into the water beneath. The lead locomotive embedded itself nose-first into the canal bank and the other two locomotives, together with the baggage car, sleeping car and two of the six passenger cars, plunged into the water. The locomotives&#x27; fuel tanks, each of which held several thousand gallons of diesel fuel, ruptured upon impact, resulting in a massive fuel spill and a fire. Forty-seven people, including the train’s three engineers, two crew members, and 42 passengers were killed many by drowning, others by fire/smoke inhalation. Another 103 were injured. The towboat&#x27;s four crew members were not injured. Odom helped save 17 people after the crash using the same towboat that had been pushing the barge that hit the bridge.

The National Geographic documentary program &quot;Seconds From Disaster&quot; also examined the derailment. In addition to corroborating findings of the official accident report, the program revealed that the train had been delayed in New Orleans by repairs to an air conditioner unit and a toilet. This had put it a half-hour behind schedule. If not for this delay, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; would have passed over the Big Bayou Canot bridge 20 minutes before the bridge was hit by the barge.

==Aftermath==
As a result of its investigation of this derailment, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) made a comprehensive series of recommendations, on September 19, 1994, to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Amtrak, the American Waterways Operators, Inc., the Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Company, the Association of American Railroads, and the American Short Line Railroad Association. Following a recommendation to maintain a record of onboard passenger numbers, Amtrak now records passenger lists electronically.

==Notable passengers==
* Andrea Chancey — 11-year-old wheelchair-using &quot;miracle child&quot; with cerebral palsy, whose parents died in the crash
* Ken Ivory and Michael Dopheide — honored by the Coast Guard for saving lives after the crash
* R. C. Sproul — related his experience in the crash

<doc id="1258524" wikidata="Q2667001" url="?curid=1258524" title="Meriasek">
<text>Saint Meriasek () was a 6th-century Cornish and Breton saint. The legends of his life are known through &quot;Beunans Meriasek&quot;, a Cornish language play known from a single surviving manuscript copy dated 1504, and a few other sources. He is the patron saint of Camborne, and according to his legendary will his feast day is the first Friday in June (although it is celebrated in some places on 7 June).

==Sources==
Until Beunans Ke came to light in 2000, Beunans Meriasek was the only known saint&#x27;s play in Middle Cornish. It was rediscovered in the 1860s. It was most probably written down at Glasney collegiate church at Penryn by one Radulphus Ton, perhaps under the aegis of Master John Nans, provost of Glasney, who later moved to Camborne and died in 1508.

==Life==

Meriasek was a Breton from a ducal family. Conan Meriadoc, the legendary king of Brittany at the time, wanted to arrange a political marriage for him, but Meriasek preferred to renounce his inheritance and become a priest. He performed several miraculous cures thereafter. He crossed the Channel to found an oratory in Camborne, Cornwall. Encountering persecution from King Teudar, he returned to Brittany (landing at Plougasnou) to found a chapel in Josselin, in the lands of the Viscounts of Rohan. His reputation for miracles attracted crowds and he decided to withdraw to Pontivy, close to the château of Rohan.

He assisted the Viscount in dealing with brigands who infested his lands by bringing down the fire of heaven upon them; in gratitude he founded three fairs at Noyal at the saint&#x27;s request.

He is reputed to have healed many lepers and disabled people, to have driven off the highwaymen of Josselin through prayer, to have made water spring from solid rock, and to have calmed a storm. He was elevated to become bishop of Vannes but continued to wear a hair shirt, practise asceticism, and minister to the poor. He was buried in Vannes Cathedral. His sacred well in Camborne was long thought to have the power of healing the insane.

==Legacy==
An open-air performance of an adaptation of &quot;Beurens Mariasek&quot; was performed in Heartlands by well over 100 schoolchildren on 13 July 2012. The performance was the culmination of a project that introduced students to the Cornish language and the tradition of medieval Cornish drama through a series of workshops and rehearsals.

<doc id="1258545" wikidata="Q6775783" url="?curid=1258545" title="Martin J. Whitman">
<text>Martin J. Whitman (September 30, 1924 – April 16, 2018) was an American investment adviser and a strong critic of the direction of recent changes in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the U.S. He was founder and Co-Chief Investment Officer of Third Avenue Management, and Portfolio Manager of the Third Avenue Value Fund.

==Early life and education==
Whitman was born to a Jewish family in the Bronx, New York. He served in the US Navy in the Pacific during World War II. Returning to New York state, he graduated from Syracuse University with a B.S. in business administration in 1949. He held an M.A. in economics from the New School of Social Research. He worked for various investment firms in New York City before setting up his own company in 1974, M.J. Whitman &amp; Co. His first big successful investment was his purchase of $100,000 in mortgage bonds issued by the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad. He later sold the bonds for five times his original investment.

==Views on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles==
Whitman used the quarterly shareholder letters of his fund as a running critique of what he called the &quot;primacy of the income account&quot; (&quot;primacy of the income account&quot; means that corporate wealth is created only by flows, i.e., having positive earnings, and/or cash flows for a period), which he argued serves only short-term speculators rather than long-term investors. For example, in his July 31, 2004 letter Wayback Machine, he wrote that recent developments in GAAP &quot;...increasingly impose unneeded and counter-productive burdens on American corporations, American management and American capital markets. GAAP... ought to be geared toward meeting the needs and desires of creditors rather than the needs and desires of short-term stock market speculators... [T]he amount of money invested in credit instruments of all types in our economy dwarfs the amount of funds invested in equities.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;Most private companies, given a choice, seek to enhance [Net Asset Value] by
means other than having reported operating income, which is taxable at maximum rates.&quot;

He argued that &quot;in GAAP... material facts [should] be disclosed in a conservative, consistent, and reliable manner&quot;, and that &quot;Financial statements [should] be prepared under the assumption that the users of such financial statements are reasonably intelligent, reasonably diligent, and are people who understand not only the uses, but also the limitations, of GAAP... [T]he most GAAP can give... are objective benchmarks which the analyst then uses as a tool to determine his, or her, version of economic truth and economic reality.&quot;

As an example of the difference in these perspectives, he discussed the current () controversy over whether stock options ought to be expensed using &quot;fair value method&quot; or &quot;intrinsic value method&quot; and points out that the issue of stock dilution is &quot;a stockholder problem, not a company problem&quot;. He pointed out that to a creditor there is &quot;a world of difference in the credit-worthiness of an issuer who... pays out... $200 million per annum in cash for executive compensation... [and one who] issues stock options on a non-dividend-paying common stock with a &quot;fair value&quot; of $200 million&quot; (the point being that the latter is of almost no concern to a creditor).

In particular, he cited as wrongheaded an advertisement in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; of April 27, 2004, which argued that &quot;financial statements exist to help investors make informed investment decisions&quot;. He responded, &quot;That statement is just plain wrong from either a public policy point of view or a creditor&#x27;s point of view. Financial statements exist to fulfill the needs and desires of many constituencies: managements, creditors, governments, customers, &quot;etc.&quot;&quot; (italics in original).

==Economic views==
Although a strong advocate of capitalism, Whitman was a critic of free markets in the sense advocated by Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek. For example, in a discussion of John Maynard Keynes, Friedman and Hayek, Whitman wrote that the three &quot;…great economists… missed a lot of details that are part and parcel of every value investor&#x27;s daily life.&quot; While calling Hayek &quot;100% right&quot; in his critique of the pure command economy, he wrote &quot;However, in no way does it follow, as many Hayek disciples seem to believe, that government is &quot;per se&quot; bad and unproductive while the private sector is, &quot;per se&quot; good and productive. In well-run industrial economies, there is a marriage between government and the private sector, each benefiting from the other.&quot; As illustrations of this, he points at &quot;Japan after World War II, Singapore and the other Asian Tigers, Sweden and China today… Government has a
necessary role in determining how control persons [management, boards of directors, etc.] are incentivized… 

He argued, in particular, for the value of government-provided credit and of carefully crafted tax laws. Further, Whitman argued (explicitly against Hayek) that &quot;a free market situation is probably also doomed to failure if there exist control persons who are not subject to external disciplines imposed by various forces over and above competition.&quot; The lack of these disciplines, said Whitman, lead to &quot;1. Very exorbitant levels of executive compensation… 2. Poorly financed businesses with strong prospects for money defaults on credit instruments… 3. Speculative bubbles… 4. Tendency for industry competition to evolve into monopolies and oligopolies… 5. Corruption.&quot; For all of these he provides recent examples from the U.S. economy, which he considers to be in some respects under-regulated, although in other respects over-regulated (he is generally opposed to Sarbanes-Oxley ).

He believed that an apparently &quot;free&quot; relationship—that between a corporation and its investors and creditors—is actually a blend of &quot;voluntary exchanges&quot; and &quot;coercion&quot;. For example, there are &quot;voluntary activities, where each individual makes his or her own decision whether to buy, sell, or hold&quot; but there are also what he defined as &quot;[c]oercive activities, where each individual security holder is forced to go along…provided that a requisite majority of other security holders so vote…&quot; His examples of the latter included proxy voting, most merger and acquisition transactions, certain cash tender offers, and reorganization or liquidation in bankruptcy. Whitman also states that &quot;Corporate America would not work at all unless many activities continued to be coercive.&quot;

&quot;I am one with Professor Friedman that, other things being equal, it is far preferable to conduct economic activities through voluntary exchange relying on free markets rather than through coercion. But Corporate America would not work at all unless many activities continued to be coercive.&quot;

==Retirement==
In February 2012, Whitman announced that he was retiring from active management of the $3.2 billion Third Avenue Value Fund. he will hand over responsibility to his longtime co-manager and protégé, Ian Lapey on March 1, 2012.

==Philanthropy==
In 2003, Whitman donated $23 million to Syracuse University which renamed its School of Management after Whitman, becoming the Martin J. Whitman School of Management. The same year, he was elected member of the board of trustees at Syracuse University. He was also an adjunct faculty member at Yale School of Management In 2008, he and his wife founded The Lois and Martin Whitman Scholarship Fund at Tel Aviv University to support the educational needs of Arab-Israeli students. Whitman related his experience as a Jew in the United States, “I spent half my life as a second-class citizen” and his inability to attend Ivy League colleges at the time. Sympathizing with their situation, he told the students it is important “to give scholarships to Arab students at Tel Aviv University.&quot; Whitman was a supporter of the Two state solution in Israel.

<text>Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) is a private Malaysian Research university established in 10th January 1997. It is wholly owned by Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS), Malaysia&#x27;s oil and gas multinational corporation. The campus is built on in the new township of Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia. The university conducts research activities in collaboration with PETRONAS on six research areas.  They are self-sustainable building, transport infrastructure, health analytics, hydrocarbon recovery, contaminant management and autonomous system. In 2023, the university was rated as the best university in Malaysia according to &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;.

==History==
In 1997, UTP was established in Perak, Malaysia when PETRONAS was invited by the Government of Malaysia to set up a university. Setting up a university from scratch poses formidable challenges, and the first step was taken in December 1998 with the completion of the UTP academic master plan. This acted as the basis for the physical master plan studies and registration or accreditation of degree programmes. The process of master planning was completed in 2002 and the construction of the area under consideration was completed in August 2004.

==Campus==
The university site is located one kilometre from the village of Tronoh, a former mining town in the Perak Tengah district of Perak, the largest state on the west coast of the peninsula. The 2 site lies within the commercial corridor between Kuala Lumpur and Penang, some from the town of Batu Gajah and from the city of Ipoh. A total amount of 7.3MWp solar panel were installed at its building rooftop.

== Academic complex ==

The new academic complex was designed by Foster and Partners, and the first-phase construction was completed in 2004. The design received an Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2007. The overall layout of the new academic complex is in the shape of a five-pointed star made up by five semicircles. The new academic complex was officially opened by the former chairman of PETRONAS and ITPSB Board, YBhg Tun Azizan Zainul Abidin. Currently, almost all of the academic activities have been shifted to the new campus. A ‘star concept’ diagram, overlaying vision, site, programme and quality, was used as a template to zone various facilities and initiate the preliminary design,

<doc id="1258560" wikidata="Q7294674" url="?curid=1258560" title="Ras Shorty I">
<text>Ras Shorty I (6 October 1941 – 12 July 2000), born Garfield Blackman and also known as Lord Shorty, was a Trinidadian calypsonian and soca musician, known as the Father of Soca and The Love Man.

==Biography==
He was born Garfield Blackman in Lengua Village, Princes Town, Trinidad, and rose to fame as &quot;Lord Shorty&quot; with his 1963 hit &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot;, subsequently taking the name Ras Shorty. A prolific musician, composer and innovator, Shorty experimented with fusing calypso and the other Indian-inspired music, including chutney music, for nearly a decade before unleashing &quot;the soul of calypso&quot;, soca music. Shorty was the first to really define his music and with &quot;Indrani&quot; in 1973 and the album &quot;Endless Vibration&quot; in 1975. On 30 August 1977, Shorty&#x27;s friend and collaborator Maestro (Cecil Hume) died in an accident in Trinidad and his loss was felt by Shorty, who penned &quot;Higher World&quot; as a tribute.

In Dominica, Shorty had attended an Exile One performance of cadence-lypso, and collaborated with Dominica&#x27;s 1969 Calypso King, Lord Tokyo, and two calypso lyricists, Chris Seraphine and Pat Aaron, in the early 1970s, who wrote him some creole lyrics. Soon after, Shorty released a song, &quot;Ou Petit&quot;, with words such as &quot;Ou di mwen ou piti Shorty&quot; (meaning &quot;you told me you are small Shorty&quot;), a combination of calypso, cadence and kwéyòl. Shorty&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Endless Vibrations&quot; and &quot;Soul of Calypso&quot; brought soca to its peak of international fame.

Soca&#x27;s development as a musical genre included its fusion with calypso, cadence, and Indian musical instruments—particularly the dholak, tabla and dhantal—as demonstrated in Lord Shorty&#x27;s classic compositions &quot;Ïndrani&quot; and &quot;Shanti Om&quot;.
His fame continued to grow throughout the 1970s, and he became one of the country&#x27;s top performers. He recorded tracks such as &quot;Kim&quot; and &quot;Money Eh No Problem&quot;, which was a stinging political and social commentary based on the words of Trinidad&#x27;s then Prime Minister, Eric Williams of the People&#x27;s National Movement. &quot;Money Eh No Problem&quot; was used in a political advertising campaign in 2000 for the United National Congress while Shorty lay on his deathbed unable to protest the use of his music for the wrong reasons, a guiding principle behind his life choices.

In 1984, he voiced his disenchantment with soca, claiming it was being used for the wrong reasons. A short time thereafter, he embraced a strict form of Christianity, adopted the name Ras Shorty I and moved with his family to the Piparo forest in the southern hills of Central Range (Trinidad and Tobago), where he and his family focused on creating faith-based music.

In the late 1980s, he began recording again, fusing soca and gospel in a style he called &#x27;jamoo&#x27;. He continued recording into the late 1990s, writing hits such as &quot;Watch Out My Children&quot;, which focuses on the dangers of drug abuse. The song was recorded in ten languages and was adopted by the UN in an anti-cocaine campaign. He toured transnationally with his band, the Love Circle, which consisted mainly of family members. During his lifetime Lord Shorty fathered a total of 23 children. The Love Circle included his wife Claudette and sons Eldon, Sheldon and Isaac, who have gone on to record several highly infectious hits, including &quot;Blessed are the Elders&quot; and &quot;To The Ceiling&quot;. His daughters, Marge, Nehilet and Avion Blackman, also have successful careers in recording and fashion design. Artist Ataklan has also benefited under the musical training of Ras Shorty I and has gone on to become a maverick of the rapso tradition.
The family aims to put across positive messages with their music, focusing especially on youth. They also exhort modern soca artists to preach positivity and the word of God through their music. Through his daughter Abbi Blackman, Ras Shorty is the grandfather of singer Nailah Blackman.

<doc id="1258581" wikidata="Q1346632" url="?curid=1258581" title="Jebe">
<text>Jebe (or Jebei, , pronounced as &quot;Zev&quot;; birth name: Jirqo&#x27;adai (Modern Mongolian: Zurgaadai), , ) (death: approximately 1224) was one of the most prominent Noyans (generals) of Genghis Khan. He belonged to the Besud clan, part of the Taichud tribe, which was under Targudai Khiriltug&#x27;s leadership at the time of Genghis Khan. Even though Jebe was originally an enemy soldier, Genghis Khan recruited him and turned him into one of his greatest generals. Jebe played an important role in helping to expand the territory of Genghis Khan&#x27;s empire. Despite playing a large role as a general for Genghis Khan, there are relatively few sources or biographies about his life. Jebe has been described as &quot;the greatest cavalry general in history&quot; for his unorthodox and daring maneuvers.

== Life ==
In 1202, during the Battle of the Thirteen Sides, an arrow wounded Genghis Khan&#x27;s horse in the neck. His loyal subordinate, Jelme, cared for him. After winning the battle, he asked the defeated to reveal who shot his horse in the neck. This was a euphemism for his own injury in an attempt to conceal his injury or possibly to prevent false confessions. Jebe, known then as Jirqo&#x27;adai, voluntarily confessed and further added that it was Genghis Khan&#x27;s choice to kill him, but if allowed to live, would serve Genghis Khan loyally. Genghis Khan valued demonstrated skills by men and their loyalty. He thus pardoned and praised Jirqo&#x27;adai in this account. He then gave Jirqo&#x27;adai a new name, Jebe, which means both &quot;arrow&quot; and &quot;weapon&quot; in Mongolian.

Jebe quickly became one of the best and most loyal commanders of Genghis Khan in later conquests, rising to one of Genghis Khan&#x27;s top generals in just 3 years, and commanding the critical left army wing in the 1211 invasion of Jin China. His ability as a general put him on the level of Muqali and Subutai ba&#x27;atur. A Song emissary, Zhao Hong, noted that Jebe was considered to have the same level of authority as a third tier governor and held command of elite troops in Genghis Khan&#x27;s army. This can be attributed to many successful military achievements while he served under Genghis Khan.

=== War against Jin dynasty ===
He served with distinction in the initial war against Jin dynasty (1211–1214). During this first invasion, Jebe commanded the left wing with Subutai. His unit went around the wall to the east, capturing two fortresses. He then re-circled his tracks to destroy the second Jin army at Wusha Fortress and linked up with Genghis&#x27;s main army, who later went on to win the Battle of Yehuling. After this crushing victory, the Mongols took command of the passes that lead into the Beijing plains and continued to spread their control through the territory. Jebe was sent to capture numerous chains of fortresses, which he accomplished by using a feigned retreat to lure out defenders. Genghis Khan seemed to rely on Jebe as his long ranged general: in winter 1211, Jebe was sent to capture Liaoyang, when Mongol forces had barely secured the great plains around Zhongdu. After riding several hundred miles away from the main battle front, Jebe lured the defenders of Liaoyang on a feigned retreat that lasted over 100 miles and left a large amount of Mongol booty on the ground. The Chinese troops paused to plunder it, and using the long nights of the northern winter, Jebe&#x27;s army rode 100 miles in 24 hours to rout the disorderly Jin forces and seize Liaoyang.

In 1213, Genghis sent Jebe to secure the heavily defended Juyong Pass. Jebe managed to find a mountain pass that enveloped the Jin fortifications, forcing the defenders to take the field. Jebe and Subutai then made forced marches the opposite way, retracing their steps and falling behind the enemy&#x27;s new rear, encircling and liquidating this crucial army. After inciting a revolt in Manchuria and reducing a number of fortresses, Genghis split his army into five parts to raid vast swathes of Jin territory. Jebe was placed in the elite force under Muqali with Subutai, and they successfully raided the territory to the ocean while destroying or capturing many Jin towns and cities.

=== Battles against Kuchlug ===
In 1218, Jebe was tasked to defeat the perennial Mongol adversary Kuchlug and conquer Kara-Khitai. Given only 20,000 men, Jebe conserved manpower by inciting and backing religious revolts between the ruling Buddhists and oppressed Muslims. His forces moved with incredible alacrity which allowed him to overwhelm Kuchlug and his 30,000 men. Kuchlug was later hunted down after a long chase through the mountains. After Jebe scored victories over Kuchlug of Kara-Khitan, Genghis Khan was said to be concerned. Although Genghis Khan was glad of his general&#x27;s victory, he was unsure if Jebe would seek greater ambition and rebel against him. When word of this reached Jebe, he immediately returned to where Genghis Khan was and offered 100 white horses (the same kind that Genghis Khan rode when Jebe wounded him) as a sign of loyalty and put any doubts to rest.

=== Invasion of Khwarezm Empire ===
During the invasion of the Khwarezm Empire in 1219, Jebe was sent with a diversionary force over the Tian Shan mountains during the winter to threaten the fertile Ferghana Valley. Jebe was able to navigate the tall mountain passes that had over five feet of snow, and he drew out Shah Mohammed II&#x27;s elite 50,000 man cavalry reserve force. Jebe either won a victory or at least avoided defeat against this elite force and maneuvered further south to threaten Khorasan in order to cut off the far-away provinces. He then looped back to join Genghis&#x27;s main army at the capital Samarkand, effectively dividing Khwarezm into two. In order to prevent the Shah from rallying his forces in Khorasan and western Iran, Genghis Khan dispatched Jebe and Subutai to hunt the Shah throughout his own empire. Though they ultimately failed to catch him, their close pursuit prevented the Shah from rallying any new armies and the Shah was forced to flee toward Iran with Jebe and Subutai in close behind. As a result, the Khwarezmian forces were spread out and destroyed gradually.

== Death ==
Jebe had made a legendary raid around the Caspian Sea where he and Subutai defeated the Georgians, who were set to join the Fifth Crusade, as well as the Caucasus Steppe tribes. He then later went on to defeat the Kievan Rus&#x27; and Cumans at the Battle of the Kalka River. This battle preceded the conquest of Kievan Rus&#x27; and he likely died on his return from the conquests of the Kievan Rus&#x27; in approximately 1224. The circumstances surrounding his disappearance and death are mysterious. One scholar, Stephen Pow suggests that Jebe may have been killed by the Russian allied Kipchaks forces near a kurgan close to Khortytsia Island. The discrepancy behind this information may be a result of linguistic errors since the Turkic-speaking Kipchaks referred to Jebe as Gemya-Beg. But Russian scholars D.M. Timokhin and V.V. Tishin questioned his views; they believe that the version of Stephen Pow is not proven on the basis of written sources and has absolutely no linguistic evidence. Although the circumstances around his death are mysterious, Jebe left an indelible mark on history with his conquests in China, Central Asia, and Europe at Kiev and the Rus.

<text>Münir Nurettin Selçuk (1900 or 1901 – April 27, 1981) was a Turkish classical musician and tenor singer.

==Biography==

He was born in the Sarıyer district of Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire in 1900 or 1901. His uncle was Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, Abdurrahman Nurettin Pasha. As a youth, Selçuk studied in Hungary before returning to Turkey and becoming a musician. In 1927, he travelled to Paris for a musical education, then began working for the Istanbul Conservatory in 1953. He was the director of the Conservatory for a total of sixteen years.

Selçuk spent some time singing in stage musicals. One of Selçuk&#x27;s most important legacies was the establishment of the position of lead singer in Turkish music. He died on April 27, 1981, and was buried at Aşiyan Asri Cemetery.

He had two sons, both of whom followed his footsteps into music, pianist composer Timur Selçuk, and jazz drummer composer Selim Selçuk.

==Works==
He appeared in the films &quot;Üçüncü Selim&#x27;in Gözdesi&quot; (1950), &quot;Hasret&quot; (1944), &quot;Kahveci Güzeli&quot; (1941), and &quot;Allah&#x27;ın Cenneti&quot; (1939), as well as composing for three films.

<doc id="1258603" wikidata="Q755488" url="?curid=1258603" title="Sebaceous cyst">
<text>A sebaceous cyst is a term commonly used to refer to either:

* Epidermoid cysts (also termed epidermal cysts, infundibular cyst)
* Pilar cysts (also termed trichelemmal cysts, isthmus-catagen cysts)

Both of the above types of cysts contain keratin, not sebum, and neither originates from sebaceous glands. Epidermoid cysts originate in the epidermis and pilar cysts originate from hair follicles. Technically speaking, then, they are not sebaceous cysts. &quot;True&quot; sebaceous cysts, which originate from sebaceous glands and which contain sebum, are relatively rare and are known as steatocystoma simplex or, if multiple, as steatocystoma multiplex.

Medical professionals have suggested that the term &quot;sebaceous cyst&quot; be avoided since it can be misleading. In practice, however, the term is still often used for epidermoid and pilar cysts.

==Signs and symptoms==

The scalp, ears, back, face, and upper arm, are common sites of sebaceous cysts, though they may occur anywhere on the body except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They are more common in hairier areas, where in cases of long duration they could result in hair loss on the skin surface immediately above the cyst. They are smooth to the touch, vary in size, and are generally round in shape.

They are generally mobile masses that can consist of:
* Fibrous tissues and fluids
* A fatty (keratinous) substance that resembles cottage cheese, in which case the cyst may be called &quot;keratin cyst&quot; – this material has a characteristic &quot;cheesy&quot; or foot odor smell
* A somewhat viscous, serosanguineous fluid (containing purulent and bloody material)

The nature of the contents of a sebaceous cyst, and of its surrounding capsule, differs depending on whether the cyst has ever been infected.

With surgery, a cyst can usually be excised in its entirety. Poor surgical technique, or previous infection leading to scarring and tethering of the cyst to the surrounding tissue, may lead to rupture during excision and removal. A completely removed cyst will not recur, though if the patient has a predisposition to cyst formation, further cysts may develop in the same general area.

==Causes==
Cysts may be related to high levels of testosterone, hence may be more frequent in users of anabolic steroids.

A case has been reported of a sebaceous cyst being caused by the human botfly.

Hereditary causes of sebaceous cysts include Gardner&#x27;s syndrome and basal cell nevus syndrome.

==Types==

===Epidermoid cyst===

===Pilar cyst===

About 90% of pilar cysts occur on the scalp, with the remaining sometimes occurring on the face, trunk, and extremities. Pilar cysts are significantly more common in females, and a tendency to develop these cysts is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In most cases, multiple pilar cysts appear at once.

==Treatment==

Sebaceous cysts generally do not require medical treatment. However, if they continue to grow, they may become unsightly, painful, and/or infected.

===Surgical===
Surgical excision of a sebaceous cyst is a simple procedure to completely remove the sac and its contents, although it should be performed when inflammation is minimal.

Three general approaches are used - traditional wide excision, minimal excision, and punch biopsy excision.

The typical outpatient surgical procedure for cyst removal is to numb the area around the cyst with a local anaesthetic, then to use a scalpel to open the lesion with either a single cut down the center of the swelling, or an oval cut on both sides of the center point. If the cyst is small, it may be lanced, instead. The person performing the surgery will squeeze out the contents of the cyst, then use blunt-headed scissors or another instrument to hold the incision wide open while using fingers or forceps to try to remove the cyst wall intact. If the cyst wall can be removed in one piece, the &quot;cure rate&quot; is 100%. If, however, it is fragmented and cannot be entirely recovered, the operator may use curettage (scraping) to remove the remaining exposed fragments, then burn them with an electrocauterization tool, in an effort to destroy them in place. In such cases, the cyst may recur. In either case, the incision is then disinfected, and if necessary, the skin is stitched back together over it. A scar will most likely result.

An infected cyst may require oral antibiotics or other treatment before or after excision. If pus has already formed, then incision and drainage should be done along with avulsion of the cyst wall with proper antibiotics coverage.

An approach involving incision, rather than excision, has also been proposed.

<text>In computer science and mathematical logic, a proof assistant or interactive theorem prover is a software tool to assist with the development of formal proofs by human–machine collaboration. This involves some sort of interactive proof editor, or other interface, with which a human can guide the search for proofs, the details of which are stored in, and some steps provided by, a computer.

A recent effort within this field is making these tools use artificial intelligence to automate the formalization of ordinary mathematics.

== System comparison ==


* ACL2 – a programming language, a first-order logical theory, and a theorem prover (with both interactive and automatic modes) in the Boyer–Moore tradition.
* Coq – Allows the expression of mathematical assertions, mechanically checks proofs of these assertions, helps to find formal proofs, and extracts a certified program from the constructive proof of its formal specification.
* HOL theorem provers – A family of tools ultimately derived from the LCF theorem prover. In these systems the logical core is a library of their programming language. Theorems represent new elements of the language and can only be introduced via &quot;strategies&quot; which guarantee logical correctness. Strategy composition gives users the ability to produce significant proofs with relatively few interactions with the system. Members of the family include:
**HOL4 – The &quot;primary descendant&quot;, still under active development. Support for both Moscow ML and Poly/ML. Has a BSD-style license.
**HOL Light – A thriving &quot;minimalist fork&quot;. OCaml based.
**ProofPower – Went proprietary, then returned to open source. Based on Standard ML.
* IMPS, An Interactive Mathematical Proof System.
* Isabelle is an interactive theorem prover, successor of HOL. The main code-base is BSD-licensed, but the Isabelle distribution bundles many add-on tools with different licenses.
* Jape – Java based.
* Lean
* LEGO
* Matita – A light system based on the Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
* MINLOG – A proof assistant based on first-order minimal logic.
* Mizar – A proof assistant based on first-order logic, in a natural deduction style, and Tarski–Grothendieck set theory.
* PhoX – A proof assistant based on higher-order logic which is eXtensible.
* Prototype Verification System (PVS) – a proof language and system based on higher-order logic.
* TPS and ETPS – Interactive theorem provers also based on simply-typed lambda calculus, but based on an independent formulation of the logical theory and independent implementation.

== User interfaces ==
A popular front-end for proof assistants is the Emacs-based Proof General, developed at the University of Edinburgh.

Coq includes CoqIDE, which is based on OCaml/Gtk. Isabelle includes Isabelle/jEdit, which is based on jEdit and the Isabelle/Scala infrastructure for document-oriented proof processing. More recently, Visual Studio Code extensions have been developed for Coq, Isabelle by Makarius Wenzel, and for Lean 4 by the leanprover developers.

== Formalization extent ==
Freek Wiedijk has been keeping a ranking of proof assistants by the amount of formalized theorems out of a list of 100 well-known theorems. As of September 2023, only five systems have formalized proofs of more than 70% of the theorems, namely Isabelle, HOL Light, Coq, Lean, and Metamath.

<text>Polperro (, meaning &quot;Pyra&#x27;s cove&quot;) is a large village, civil parish, and fishing harbour within the Polperro Heritage Coastline in south Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. Its population is around 1,554.

Polperro, through which runs the River Pol, is 7 miles (11 km) east of Fowey and 4 miles (6 km) west of the neighbouring town of Looe and west of the major city and naval port of Plymouth. It is a noted tourist destination, particularly in the summer months, for its idyllic appearance with tightly-packed ancient fishermen&#x27;s houses which survive almost untouched, its quaint harbour and attractive coastline.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name Polperro derives from the Cornish &quot;Porthpyra&quot;, meaning &quot;harbour named after Pyran&quot;. However Ekwall suggests that &quot;Pyra&quot; or &quot;Pira&quot; may not be a personal name and suggests that &quot;Perro&quot; could be a name for the stream. Early forms are &quot;Portpira&quot;, 1303, and &quot;Porpira&quot;, 1379. The chapel of St Peter de Porthpyre is mentioned in 1398 and the following forms are recorded from the reign of King Henry VIII: &quot;Polpyz&quot; explained as &quot;fish-pool&quot; (probably a literal error for &quot;Polpyr&quot;), &quot;Poulpirrhe&quot;, &quot;Poul Pier&quot; and &quot;Poulpyrre&quot; (in John Leland&#x27;s account).

===Early history===
Polperro, since medieval times, fell under the jurisdiction of two ancient and separate manors, those of Raphael in the parish of Lansallos, west of the &quot;River Pol&quot; which runs through the middle of the village, and Killigarth to the east in the parish of Talland, mentioned in the Domesday Book.

As early as the 13th century Polperro was a recognised fishing settlement and its first known record is in a Royal Ordinance of 1303.

===Later history===

The date of the building of Polperro&#x27;s older quay is uncertain but Jonathan Couch (writing in the mid-19th century) considered that it is either the one mentioned by John Leland (who wrote in the first half of the 16th century) or one built upon the same site. It was probably built under the patronage of the lord of the manor of Raphael who owned the harbour and its rights. Polperro&#x27;s newer quay, also of unknown antiquity, is sited almost on an east-west alignment a little further out to sea. It was built before 1774 when it suffered much damage in a storm, following which Thomas Long, of Penheale and lord of the manors of Raphael and Lansallos, paid for its repair.

Parts of the harbour were rebuilt after destruction by a violent storm on 19 and 20 January 1817, when thirty large boats, two seiners and many smaller boats were destroyed with many parts of the village including the Green and Peak Rock were consumed by the sea waters and a number of houses were swept away. The damage was estimated at £2,000 but there were no deaths. This storm, with hurricane-force winds, caused damage to property from Plymouth to Land&#x27;s End; the fishing boats at Polperro ″shared in the common calamity and exposed the unhappy sufferers to distress from which the industry of years can scarcely be expected to relieve them″.

In November 1824 the worst ever storm occurred: three houses were destroyed, the whole of one pier and half the other were swept away and nearly 50 boats in the harbour were dashed to pieces. Of the six boats that survived, only one of which was a Gaffer. Polperro&#x27;s new pier was designed to afford better protection for the future. The East Indiaman &quot;Albemarle&quot; was blown ashore with a valuable cargo of diamonds, coffee, pepper, silk and indigo on 9 December 1708 near Polperro (the precise location of the wreck is yet to be discovered).

Jonathan Couch was the village doctor for many years, and wrote the history of the village as well as various works of natural history (particularly on ichthyology). The &quot;History of Polperro&quot;, 1871, was published after his death by his son, Thomas Quiller Couch, with many abridgements since. Couch contributed two series of articles to the periodical &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; – &quot;The Folklore of a Cornish Village&quot; 1855 and 1857, and these were incorporated in the &quot;History of Polperro&quot;, to which he also contributed a sketch of his father&#x27;s life. The welfare of the fishermen and the prosperity of the fisheries were in his care together with his medical and scientific work.

Polperro&#x27;s beauty has long been a magnet for artists. The celebrated Austrian painter Oskar Kokoschka, upon discovering Polperro, spent a year in the village between 1939 and 1940. It also features as a location for filming the TV drama series, &quot;Doc Martin&quot; and &quot;Beyond Paradise&quot;.

===Smuggling===

Smuggling is understood to have prospered since Polperro developed as a port in the 12th century. It reached its zenith in the late 18th century when Britain&#x27;s wars with America and France precipitated the high taxation of many imported goods, making it worthwhile for the local fishermen to boost their income by the covert importation of spirits, tobacco and other goods from Guernsey and elsewhere. By the late 18th century, much of the success of the smuggling trade through Polperro was controlled by Zephaniah Job (1749–1822), a local merchant who became known as the &#x27;Smugglers&#x27; Banker&#x27;.

A more organised Coast Guard service was introduced in the 19th century together with the deterrent of stiff penalties, leading to much less smuggling. Part of the South West Coast Path was originally used by Revenue Officers as they patrolled the coast in search of smugglers. Whilst the South West Coast Path is maintained by the National Trust, the foreshore belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall.

===Robert Jeffery===
In 1807, on Commander Warwick Lake&#x27;s , Robert Jeffery, a Polperroite, was found to have stolen his midshipman&#x27;s beer, and Lake, in a fit of pique, ordered him to be marooned on the island of Sombrero off Anguilla. Jeffery was born in Fowey but moved to Polperro before joining the merchant navy and then being press-ganged into the Royal Navy.

Some months later, Lake&#x27;s commanding officer Sir Alexander Cochrane learned of what had happened and immediately ordered Lake to retrieve Jeffery. When &quot;Recruit&quot; arrived at Sombrero, Jeffery could not be found. Eventually the story got out and Lake was discharged from the Royal Navy by court martial for his actions. As it turned out, Jeffery had been rescued by an American ship and was discovered in Massachusetts three years later, working as a blacksmith; he was repatriated to Britain and awarded compensation.

==Economy==

===Tourism===

Tourism became Polperro&#x27;s main industry during the 20th century. The village is accessible by air via Plymouth or Newquay, by train via Looe railway station, by road and by boat. It was estimated that the village received about 25,000 visitors a day during summer in the 1970s. Visitors are no longer permitted to drive cars into the village, having to leave them in the main car park at Crumplehorn to the north of the village and walk through the half-mile length of the village to its harbour. The village&#x27;s quaint but narrow streets make driving difficult. There are horse and cart rides and milk floats disguised as trams for those who prefer not to walk.

Attractions of Polperro include the South West Coast Path, the -long and established walk from Dorset to Somerset which passes through the village, and offers day walks along the local scenic coastline, in particular to nearby Talland Bay on the coast path heading East. Westwards, the path passes three large beaches en route to Fowey: Lansallos Beach, Lantivit Bay and Lantic Bay. Within the village is the Polperro Heritage Museum of Fishing and Smuggling, situated on the harbourside in an old fish processing warehouse, which houses interesting photographs of the village&#x27;s history among other popular displays. Guided walks are available in the village, and boat trips can be taken from the harbour to view the coastline which can offer sightings of dolphins and seals.

The village has several restaurants as well as seven pubs. A holiday and caravan park is situated outside the village to the northeast at Carey Park.

===Fishing===

Fishing was traditionally the principal occupation of Polperro families. For centuries the village has been a pilchard fishing and processing port. Fish are drawn for feeding off the South Cornwall coast in late summer bringing rich pickings for local fishermen. Once ashore, the fish were salted and pressed and the oil was collected as a by-product and used for heating and lighting. Polperro pilchards were exported throughout Europe.

Shoals of these fish diminished in the 20th century and pilchard fishing died out as Polperro&#x27;s mainstay in the 1960s, however approximately twelve commercial fishing vessels still operate from the harbour catching flatfish, scallops, crabs, monkfish, ray, pollock, bass and cod. Fresh fish and seafood are available for purchase at the quayside from time to time.

===Festivals===
Other than traditional festival days, The Polperro Festival has been held annually since 1996, being a community festival run by volunteers beginning on the 3rd Saturday in June which helps to promote business for the village. It started as an Arts and crafts Festival, and has developed to include live music of many genres, dance, street entertainment, theatre and children&#x27;s entertainment and local food. Most of the entertainment centres on Big Green, the village square, and for the last few years under a covered marquee. After 9 pm, for noise considerations, the festivities at Big Green disperse elsewhere.

====Past Lord Mayors of Polperro====
Here is a current list of all the previous Lord Mayors of Polperro since its conception in 1996:
‡ Note: There was no festival held between 2020 &amp; 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead Mike Jelly held onto the Lord Mayor title until handing over to Phil Thomas in 2022.

==Notable buildings==

Couch&#x27;s House in Lansallos Street was home to naturalist and physician, Jonathan Couch and before him of many generations of the Quiller family who became prosperous through the proceeds of smuggling and buccaneering.

Polperro&#x27;s War Memorial is some distance outside the village on the coast path towards Talland. Also, tucked away in the village&#x27;s winding streets (on &quot;The Warren&quot;), is a house clad entirely in shells, known colloquially as &quot;The Shell House&quot;.

===Churches===
Situated in the Anglican diocese of Truro Polperro, although a small village, is served by two Church of England parishes divided by the River Pol: Lansallos to the west and Talland to the east. The 19th-century Anglican Chapel of St John, a chapel of ease to Talland Parish Church, stands in the village but no longer conducts services. John Wesley preached in the village in 1762 and 1768: by 1792 it was possible to build a large chapel accommodating 250 people and Methodism flourished in Polperro during the 1800s.

Sclerder Abbey, a Roman Catholic monastery, is located off the road to Looe, just outside the village.

==Science==
In the late 19th century, Sir Francis Galton conducted a study of fingerprints at Polperro. He chose the village because of the prevalence of intermarriage amongst its inhabitants, being only accessible from the sea or by coastal path at that time. His findings helped to advance criminology and sociology and include extensive genealogies of local families which are held at the College of Arms in London.

<text>Harriet Constance Smithson (18 March 1800 – 3 March 1854), who also went by Henrietta Constance Smithson, Harriet Smithson Berlioz, and Miss H.C. Smithson, was an Anglo-Irish Shakespearean actress of the 19th century, best known as the first wife and muse of Hector Berlioz.

==Early life==
Harriet Smithson was born on 18 March 1800, at Ennis, County Clare, Ireland. Her father, William Joseph Smithson, was an actor and theatrical manager from Gloucestershire, England, and her mother was an actress whose full name is unknown. She also had a brother, Joseph Smithson, and a sister, name also unknown. In October 1801, Harriet was left in the care of Reverend James Barrett, a priest of the Church of Ireland, parish of Drumcliffe. Barrett became her guardian and brought her up as though she were his own daughter. He instructed her &quot;in the precepts of religion,&quot; and kept everything connected with the stage from her view. After Barrett&#x27;s death on 16 February 1808, the Smithsons sent Harriet to a boarding school in Waterford.

==Acting career==
=== Irish beginning ===
On 27 May 1814, Smithson made her first stage appearance at the Theatre Royal (Dublin), as Albina Mandevill in Frederick Reynolds&#x27;s &quot;The Will&quot;. Her performance was well received, and the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; gave her a positive review.

She certainly is a most interesting and promising young actress, and there is no doubt she would prove a great acquisition to Crow-street, in the line of performance which her taste, as well as her talents, incline her to pursue.

In 1815, Smithson took her parents&#x27; place in Montague Talbot&#x27;s company in Belfast after they returned to Dublin. The season opened on 1 January 1816, where she extended her range in roles, performing in multiple comedies. She then travelled to Newry, Limerick, Dublin, and Burmingham, where she joined Robert Elliston&#x27;s company. She spent the next two months playing over forty roles in various genres.

===Debut in London===
Four years later, 20 January 1818, Smithson made her first London appearance at Drury Lane as Letitia Hardy in &quot;The Belle&#x27;s Stratagem&quot;. Her first performance received mixed reviews from critics, but she quickly gained some favour of critics and performers as she obtained more experience.

She joined the permanent company at the Royal Coburg later that year. However, she rejoined Drury Lane Company in the autumn of 1820. On 20 February 1821, she took the lead female role in &quot;Thérèse&quot; by John Howard Payne, when the cast actress fell ill.

Overall, the London public remembered her as &quot;The Times&quot; put it, &quot;a face and features well adapted to her profession; but [an actress] not likely to make a great impression on a London audience, or to figure among stars of the first magnitude.&quot;

===Success in Paris===
In 1827, Smithson made her Paris début as Lydia Languish in &quot;The Rivals&quot; at the Odéon theatre. Though she received negative reviews for this role, she was highly praised for her beauty and ability in the subsequent performance of &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;.

On 11 September 1827, she was given the part of Ophelia next to Charles Kemble in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; which was when Hector Berlioz first saw her. She left a long lasting impression on the French through her interpretation of Ophelia&#x27;s madness, utilizing pantomime and natural presentation.

Miss Smithson acted the scene in which, robbed of her sanity, she takes her own veil to be her father&#x27;s body with utmost grace and truth. The whole passage which seemed long and relatively insignificant and even exaggerated in reading, had tremendous impact on stage…The most remarkable feature of her acting is her pantomime; she adopts fantastic postures; and she uses the dying fall in her inflections, without ever ceasing to be natural…

The tremendous success of &quot;Hamlet&quot; led to that of &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;, for 15 September. Smithson was cast as Juliet, where she revolutionized the women&#x27;s role in theatre by becoming as important as her male counterpart, Romeo. Until this point, women&#x27;s lines in theatre were heavily cut and censored to reduce the role for the company&#x27;s &quot;restricted talent.&quot; Again, the production was widely well received.

Miss Smithson was charged with the role of Juliet, and she was excellent in it. It was in the scene in the second act, where she has a night meeting with Romeo, that her acting began to attract the audience&#x27;s attention. This scene is extremely beautiful, even though it is written with a studied refinement...Miss Smithson could not have been more graceful upon the balcony; her posture were full of truth, grace, and love...In her strong moments, she is no longer a woman, but a Fury or something approaching that... 
On 18 September, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; became the third Shakespeare tragedy to be performed by The English theatre. Her performance as Desdemona was less effective, but the production was popular enough to be repeated the week after.
The English Theatre replaced the productions of tragedies with comedies, such as &quot;The Belle&#x27;s Stratagem&quot;, &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, Mrs. Centlivre&#x27;s &quot;The Wonder&quot;, and Mrs. Cowley&#x27;s &quot;The Weathercock&quot;. However, press&#x27;s demand for more tragedies led to the production of &quot;The Tragedy of Jane Shore&quot;. In this renowned tragedy, Smithson was cast as Shore, the role in which she moved her audience to tears. The production soon became the most performed play in the English season. At the end of her time in France, she acted in several productions with famous actors such as William Charles Macready, Edmund Kean, and Charles Kemble.

Smithson became famous for her natural presentation of characters, striking pantomime, and beauty. She introduced the French to natural English theatrical techniques that allowed her to become her characters instead of simply portraying them. The new acting style, emphasizing drama and truth, which appealed to the French Romantics, prevailed over traditional French Classicists&#x27; idea of great acting. Soon, many French actresses started to imitate her method.

===Back in London===
As opportunities to continue her work in Paris dwindled, Smithson returned to London to perform &quot;Jane Shore&quot; again. The production opened at Covent Garden on 11 May 1829 under unfavorable circumstances. Some audience members, who had read her reviews before she went to Paris, felt reluctant to attend the show. Furthermore, the London press was anxious to prove that their previous reviews of her average acting were accurate. Newspapers such as the &quot;Examiner&quot; gave the first performance a begrudging review:

Her action is easy and graceful though somewhat redundant. Her declamation and studied choice of attitudes show that she has been a careful student in the French school of High tragedy. Her voice from a peculiarity in its intonation has a monotonous effect…
However, just seven days after her next performance as Juliet, in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the press, including &quot;The Examiner&quot;, gave her glowing reviews:

Miss Smithson&#x27;s performance of Juliet, take it as a whole, is by many degrees the best we have seen since the days of Miss O&#x27;Neil…She is the best tragic actress now in London.

She appeared as Belvidera in &quot;Venice Preserved&quot; and as Mrs Simpson in &quot;Simpson and Co&quot; on the Lincoln Circuit at the Peterborough theatre between 27 June and 2 July 1831. After Covent Garden closed for the summer in 1832, Smithson toured England to minor theatres performing almost exclusively in tragedies. In June 1832, she joined the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, where she had limited success and received criticism about her weight.

===End of career===
In 1830, Smithson went back to Paris to set up an English theatre under her own management. She obtained permission to perform at the Theatre-Italien where she performed several unsuccessful plays. A year later, she broke her leg and was forced to put her career on hold until her leg healed. She was now in great debt, yet her mother and sister still depended on her for support. She gave her last performance, as Ophelia, on 15 December 1836, before her health deteriorated.

==As a muse==
Smithson&#x27;s genuine portrayal of her characters led to her fame and elusiveness. Until her, tragedy was considered primarily a man&#x27;s realm. Her distinctly genuine, almost grotesque, interpretation of characters made way for subsequent actresses in tragedies. In this way, she set the standard of great acting for all actors.

Smithson&#x27;s excellent acting muddled perceptions of her personality with that of her female characters. At the height of her career, she became the figurehead for the French Romantic movement. The many French Romantic pieces of art, plays, music, and written works she had inspired depicted her as Ophelia, Juliet, and Harriet. The most famous of these works was Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot;. After Berlioz saw Smithson as Ophelia in 1827, he became infatuated with her, or rather with &quot;a dramatic image [of a woman] lent force by supreme art of Shakespeare and intensity by a highly charged occasion and performance.&quot; His obsession prompted him to compose the &quot;Symphonie Fantastique,&quot; which is known as the first great romantic symphony.

==Marriage to Hector Berlioz==
Berlioz discovered Smithson at the Odéon Theatre performing the roles of Juliet Capulet and Ophelia and immediately fell in love with her. He persistently sent her letters despite never having met her. For a brief period, he lived in an apartment whence he could see her return home and watch her until she went to sleep. She ignored all of his advances until 1832, when she was invited to a performance of &quot;Lélio&quot;, a sequel to his &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot;, by a mutual friend. She realized that the symphony was about her and sent Berlioz a message congratulating him. Berlioz quickly received permission to meet her and they became lovers. Despite her quiet reluctance and the opposition of both families and friends, they were married at the British Embassy in Paris on 3 October 1833. Louis, the couple&#x27;s only child, was born on 14 August 1834.

Smithson soon became resentful and jealous of Berlioz as his musical success distanced him from her. As she became increasingly possessive and ill, Berlioz began an affair with Marie Recio, a singer at the Paris Opera, who was to be Berlioz’ second wife. Smithson eventually moved out of the matrimonial home on the rue Saint Vincent, Montmartre, to the rue Blanche in 1843, but was still financially supported by Berlioz.

==Death==
Toward the end of her life, Smithson suffered from paralysis, which left her barely able to move or speak. She died on 3 March 1854, at her home on the rue Saint-Vincent, and was buried at the Cimetière Saint-Vincent. Berlioz later had her body reinterred at the Montmartre cemetery when Saint-Vincent&#x27;s was to be redeveloped.

<doc id="1258615" wikidata="Q109391" url="?curid=1258615" title="Volcanic crater">
<text>A volcanic crater is an approximately circular depression in the ground caused by volcanic activity. It is typically a bowl-shaped feature containing one or more vents. During volcanic eruptions, molten magma and volcanic gases rise from an underground magma chamber, through a conduit, until they reach the crater&#x27;s vent, from where the gases escape into the atmosphere and the magma is erupted as lava. A volcanic crater can be of large dimensions, and sometimes of great depth. During certain types of explosive eruptions, a volcano&#x27;s magma chamber may empty enough for an area above it to subside, forming a type of larger depression known as a caldera.

==Geomorphology==
In most volcanoes, the crater is situated at the top of a mountain formed from the erupted volcanic deposits such as lava flows and tephra. Volcanoes that terminate in such a summit crater are usually of a conical form. Other volcanic craters may be found on the flanks of volcanoes, and these are commonly referred to as flank craters. Some volcanic craters may fill either fully or partially with rain and/or melted snow, forming a crater lake. 
These lakes may become soda lakes, many of which are associated with active tectonic and volcanic zones.

A crater may be breached during an eruption, either by explosions or by lava, or through later erosion. Breached craters have a much lower rim on one side. 

Some volcanoes, such as maars, consist of a crater alone, with scarcely any mountain at all. These volcanic explosion craters are formed when magma rises through water-saturated rocks, which causes a phreatic eruption. Volcanic craters from phreatic eruptions often occur on plains away from other obvious volcanoes. Not all volcanoes form craters.

<text>Prince of Persia 3D is a 1999 action-adventure game developed by Mindscape and published by Red Orb Entertainment for Microsoft Windows. A port for the Dreamcast was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive in North America the following year under the title Prince of Persia: Arabian Nights. It is the first 3D installment in the &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; series, and the final game in the trilogy that started with the original 1989 game. Taking the role of the titular unnamed character rescuing his bride from a monstrous suitor&#x27;s schemes, gameplay follows the Prince as he explores environments, platforming and solving puzzles while engaging in combat scenarios.

Production began in 1997 and lasted over two years. While series creator Jordan Mechner acted as a creative consultant and contributed to the narrative, he was mostly uninvolved. The visual design drew from Medieval Persia with added fantastical elements. A planned PlayStation port was cancelled in favour of the Dreamcast version. Reception of the title was mixed, with most of the criticism focusing on its gameplay and several bugs. Following its sale to Ubisoft, the series was rebooted under Mechner&#x27;s guidance with 2003&#x27;s &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Prince of Persia 3D&quot; is an action-adventure video game. The player controls the main protagonist, an unnamed Prince from a kingdom in Persia; the Prince is navigated through fifteen levels. Environments are seen through a fixed third-person view which tracks with the Prince&#x27;s movements. When the Prince is standing still, the player can take manual control of the camera to examine the environment. The Prince is guided through levels using tank controls. While exploring levels, he can jump across gaps and up onto platforms, climb up and explore along ledges, deal with traps, and swim through bodies of water. Many puzzles found during levels, which must be solved to progress, involve activating levers and triggering pressure plates and switches. Potions can be found through the environments, with effects ranging from replenishing and increasing health to turning invisible or curing poison.

While exploring, the Prince can engage individual enemies in close-range combat with three weapon types; the sword, the spear or staff, a bow and twin blades. The bow can only be used outside normal combat to shoot enemies from a distance, and can also be used in some puzzle types. The health of the Prince and their current opponent is shown along the bottom of the screen. Combat is initiated when drawing a weapon with an enemy nearby, with the camera switching to a side perspective which adjusts with the Prince&#x27;s movements. While always facing the enemy, the Prince can move in any direction. During battle, the player can strike from both sides and above, block attacks, and feint a move to create an opening for an attack. If a character&#x27;s blow is blocked, then the attacker is stunned for a short time and the opponent can launch a faster counterattack. Some scenarios in levels allow the Prince to either sneak past enemies or use environmental elements to kill them. If the Prince runs out of health, the game ends and must be restarted either from a save point or the beginning of a level.

== Plot ==
The Sultan, together with the recently-married Prince and Princess, visit the kingdom of his brother Assan south of Persia. During an entertainment, Assan&#x27;s guards kill the Sultan&#x27;s own guard and imprison the Prince. The Sultan had previously promised the Princess&#x27;s hand to Assan&#x27;s son Rugnor, a vow the Sultan broke when the Prince married her. The Prince escapes captivity and makes his way to the Sultan, who unsuccessfully attempts to persuade the Prince to give the Princess up. Assan attempts to kill the Prince, but kills the Sultan when he steps between them. The Sultan asks the Prince to save the Princess before he dies, and the Prince flees as Assan accuses the Prince of the Sultan&#x27;s murder. Rugnor, revealed to be a half-human half-tiger creature, kidnaps the Princess and has multiple run-ins with the Prince. When the Princess refuses to yield to Rugnor, going as far as cutting off his hand with a sword, he decides to kill her by tying her to a large gear machine in his lair to crush her to death. The Prince arrives in time, killing Rugnor by knocking him into the gears and stopping the machine. The Prince then spirits the Princess away to an unknown destination.

== Development ==
&quot;Prince of Persia 3D&quot; began active development in 1997 at Mindscape. Preproduction had begun in April 1996 when the first proposals were made. During its production period, the &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; brand changed ownership from Broderbund after the company was purchased by The Learning Company in mid-1998, then by Mattel Interactive in December of that same year through a merger with The Learning Company. The game was published under the Red Orb Entertainment brand, which was split away from Broderbund during the buyout and continued to support Mindscape. Series creator Jordan Mechner was brought in as a creative consultant, and co-authored the scenario; the cutscene dialogue was written by John Morgan. Mechner was brought on board after finishing work on &quot;The Last Express&quot;. He never felt connected to the project, saying that it was always the brainchild of producer Andrew Pederson. He described his role as simply giving the go-ahead, and being brought in to consult on proposed mechanics. Mechner disliked the project as it evolved, seeing as little more than a clone of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, which was very popular at the time. He also felt a disconnect with the Prince character, as executive pressure had forced the Prince into becoming a character he barely recognised. Around 20 people worked on the game, plus a few contractors in Canada helping out on cutscenes.

During the design phase, the team put a lot of effort into creating the narrative and the environmental design. Environments and architecture, together with enemy designs, drew inspiration from the history and religion of Medieval Persia. The storyline itself was meant to emulate the style of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. Much of the architecture was based on Persia during the 9th and 12th century, with the team consulting Mechner with incorporating &quot;more contemporary&quot; traps. The game&#x27;s characters and enemies were worked on by artist Chris Grun, who was described by Mechner as someone who was &quot;not Disney, not realistic, just &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;&quot;. Grun drew inspiration for his designs from the work of Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen, who created illustrations for &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, and the work of artist Edmond de Lack. In portraying different cultures, he was directly inspired by the conflicts caused by the spread of Islam through the region.

The battle sequences drew inspiration both from earlier &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; titles, and other titles including &quot;Bushido Blade&quot;. The more realistic fighting was influenced by the two weapon and fighting consultants hired for the project, one involved with weapon props for movies (Richard Pallaziol) and the other an ex-Marine. The two were filmed acting out fighting moves, which were then mimicked inside the game environment. For the Prince&#x27;s athletics, the team had an Olympic gymnast perform them on camera, then they used the footage to replicate the actions in-game. This style, while not true motion capture, was a style similar to Mechner&#x27;s rotoscoping technique for the original &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; titles.

The game used the third-party NetImmerse game engine, with character animation and AI behaviour handled by Motion Factory&#x27;s Motivate middleware system. The team considered creating their own game engine during early production, but settled on third-party software so they could focus on game development. NetImmerse was used to manage polygon models and particle effects, while Motivate was used for animation development. Other actions and elements were otherwise handled by the in-house programming team. The engine&#x27;s versatility allowed the developers to create both indoor and outdoor environments without many restrictions. Further graphical elements included warping polygon models to allow actions such as the Prince&#x27;s breathing to be visible. Several different graphical options were supported, and 3D acceleration was a requirement for the title. The music was co-composed by Tom Rettig, Jonelle Adkisson and Greg Rahn.

== Release ==
&quot;Prince of Persia 3D&quot; was announced by Broderbund in April 1998, planned for a release in &quot;early 1999&quot;. It was later shown off at that year&#x27;s E3. As part of the promotion, a developer&#x27;s blog was originally operated on the game&#x27;s website, although due to workload the blog was not greatly expanded. The game was released on 17 September 1999 in North America, and 1 October in Europe. This version was released for Microsoft Windows. Multiple patches were released for the game over the following weeks, focusing on fixing reported bugs.

The port of &quot;Prince of Persia 3D&quot; for the Dreamcast was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive. For the port, the game was retitled &quot;Prince of Persia: Arabian Nights&quot;. The port was released in North America on 6 December 2000. A port was also being developed for the PlayStation, based on the PC version and featuring gameplay alterations to appeal to fans of action games. The PlayStation port was cancelled so staff could focus on the Dreamcast port.

== Reception ==
The Dreamcast version received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In retrospective opinions from Mechner and game journalists, &quot;Prince of Persia 3D&quot; is considered one of the weakest titles in the series and a key reason for a growing lack of interest from the gaming community.

&quot;IGN&quot; praised the PC version&#x27;s unique score, fluid animations and well made graphics, and the jumping mechanics. &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticised the same version&#x27;s rough character models, difficult camera effects, and unresponsive controls, but praised the action. John Lee of &quot;NextGen&quot; gave a positive review to the PC version of the game, but noted the controls as &quot;sluggish&quot; and the occasional problems with the camera. Peter Olafson of &quot;GamePro&quot; was generally positive to the PC version of the game, but was critical to the controls and camera. Later, however, Dr. Zombie called the Dreamcast version a &quot;solid fun for Dreamcast, providing a good mix of action with challenging puzzle solving&quot;, but deemed it inferior compared to other adventure games such as &quot;Tomb Raider Revelations&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Following the poor performance of &quot;Prince of Persia 3D&quot;, Mechner distanced himself from the video game industry, feeling burned out and disconnected from the series. In 2001, Mattel sold off The Learning Company&#x27;s entertainment division, which included rights to the &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; series catalogue, to Ubisoft. At that time, Mechner retained the IP rights, and Ubisoft contacted him about rebooting the series. While Mechner was reluctant, Ubisoft won him over and he decided to start over with both the series and its lead character. That reboot, &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;, was released in 2003 to commercial success and positive reviews. The game saw multiple sequels, and is cited as the reason players and critics returned to the &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; series following &quot;Prince of Persia 3D&quot;.

<text>Live is a 1992 live recording by Sarah McLachlan, not to be confused with the 2004 Live Acoustic EP. It documents a concert that McLachlan performed in September of that year in Harbourfront, Toronto, and was released on CD in October. All of the songs originally appeared on McLachlan&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Solace&quot;, except &quot;Ben&#x27;s Song&quot;, which is from her 1988 release &quot;Touch&quot;. Although labelled an EP, a format that usually has a short running time and only a few tracks, this release runs more than 30 minutes, above the length threshold of being a full album.

This album was released as a limited edition, which included a condensed version of McLachlan&#x27;s 1991–1992 tour program; all copies released by the label have sold out. It is now considered a collector&#x27;s item. It is the first of several live albums McLachlan has released to date.

&quot;Drawn to the Rhythm&quot; was later included on the 1996 compilation &quot;Rarities, B-Sides and Other Stuff&quot;.

<doc id="1258636" wikidata="Q466003" url="?curid=1258636" title="John Faulkner">
<text>John Philip Faulkner (born 12 April 1954) is an Australian former Labor Party politician who was a Senator for New South Wales from 1989 to 2015. He was a Cabinet Minister in the Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments.

After his election to the Senate in 1989, Prime Minister Paul Keating appointed Faulkner as Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel in 1993. In 1994, Faulkner was moved to the position of Minister for the Environment, which he held until Labor&#x27;s defeat in 1996. He later served as the Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate from 1996 to 2005, and returned to Cabinet upon Labor&#x27;s election in 2007, after Kevin Rudd made him Vice-President of the Executive Council and Special Minister of State. He later served as Minister for Defence from 2009 to 2010, when he retired from frontline politics. He became the Father of the Australian Senate in 2014, and retired from Parliament altogether a year later by way of resignation, and is considered by some as an elder statesman. Faulkner has since been a member of the board of the Global Panel Foundation – Australasia – an NGO that works global in crisis areas.

==Background and early career==
Faulkner was born in Leeton, New South Wales on 12 April 1954, attended Pennant Hills High School, and was educated at Macquarie University, Sydney, where he graduated in Arts and Education (BA, DipEd). Before entering politics he worked as a Special Education teacher in government schools from 1977 to 1979. In 1980 he was employed as a Research officer to the New South Wales Minister for Sport and Recreation, Ken Booth. Gaining prominence within the ALP, he was made Assistant General Secretary of the NSW party in 1980, serving for nine years and became a member of the ALP National Executive in 1989.

==Political career==
A leading member of the Socialist Left faction of the ALP, Faulkner was appointed to the Senate in 1989 to succeed the former left-wing minister Arthur Gietzelt, who had resigned mid-term. In the Keating Labor government, Faulkner was Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1993–94, and Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, with a seat in the Cabinet, 1994–96.

After the defeat of the Keating government in 1996, Faulkner became Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, and was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1996–2004. He was at various times Shadow Minister for Social Security, Public Administration and Home Affairs. He was a key Labor strategist in the 1998, 2001 and 2004 federal elections, and was a particularly close advisor to Mark Latham during the 2004 election. In the wake of Labor&#x27;s defeat in that election, he resigned his positions. Faulkner became the first Labor Senate leader who did not become Government Senate leader since Don Willesee. In October 2006 John Faulkner was elected as the National President of the Australian Labor Party until February 2008 and chaired the Labor&#x27;s National Conference in 2007.

In the First Rudd Ministry, Faulkner served as the Vice-President of the Executive Council, Special Minister of State and Cabinet Secretary. In his role he introduced new rules for ministerial conduct and fundraising aimed at reducing the influence of lobbyists on government decisions. He also introduced new guidelines reducing the overt political control of government funded advertising.

On 9 June 2009, Faulkner was sworn in the Minister for Defence, replacing Joel Fitzgibbon, who had stepped down on 4 June. He retained this portfolio in the First Gillard government until the 2010 federal election following an earlier announcement that he would step down as Defence Minister and return to the backbench.

In 2014 Faulkner began a process of reforms that sought to stamp out perceived corruption and factional infighting within the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party. Faulkner proposed to include members in decisions such as the selection of candidates for Senate and Legislative Council vacancies and party tickets, and a vote in the direct election of the New South Wales parliamentary leaders. However, Faulkner&#x27;s reform proposals were mostly rejected at NSW Labor&#x27;s 2014 conference. The direct election of party leader gained support with effect from after the 2015 election.

===Resignation===
Faulkner announced on 30 April 2014 that he would not seek re-election and would be retiring at the end of his term on 30 June 2017. On 11 December 2014, however, he announced that he would be resigning from the Senate in late January or early February 2015, creating a casual vacancy. Faulkner resigned on 6 February 2015.

==Post-politics life==
Faulkner has since been a member of the board of the Global Panel Foundation – Australasia – an NGO that works global in crisis areas.

==Personal life==
Faulkner was formerly married to fellow Labor politician Sandra Nori and they have two children.

<doc id="1258641" wikidata="Q379476" url="?curid=1258641" title="Epidermoid cyst">
<text>An epidermoid cyst or epidermal inclusion cyst is a benign cyst usually found on the skin. The cyst develops out of ectodermal tissue. Histologically, it is made of a thin layer of squamous epithelium.

==Signs and symptoms==
The epidermoid cyst may have no symptoms, or it may be painful when touched. It can release macerated keratin. In contrast to pilar cysts, epidermoid cysts are usually present on parts of the body with relatively little hair. Some vaginal cysts are epidermoid cysts.

Although they are not malignant, there are rare cases of malignant tumors arising from an epidermoid cyst. Epidermal inclusion cysts account for approximately 85–95% of all excised cysts; malignant transformation is exceedingly rare. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma developing from an epidermal inclusion cyst has been estimated to range from 0.011 to 0.045%.

==Diagnosis==
Epidermoid cysts are usually diagnosed when a person notices a bump on their skin and seeks medical attention. The definitive diagnosis is made after excision by a pathologist based on microscopic appearance of a cystic lesion lined by cornified epithelium containing lamellated keratin without calcifications. They can also be seen as isointense lesions on MRI or hyperintensities on FLAIR.

==Treatment==
Cysts can be removed by excision.

In case of fronto-ethmoidal epidermoid cysts, surgical resection appears to be the mainstay of treatment; however, the extent of resection is dictated by adherence of the tumor capsule to the surrounding vital structures.

Hydrogen peroxide gel (H2O2) was previously recommended for cyst treatment, particularly those on body piercings. However the gel cannot adequately permeate the cyst and was not found to be effective. Hydrogen peroxide is no longer recommended for wound care by doctors as it can damage the healing tissues.

On body piercings, self treatment with a hot saline soak to help drain the cyst and the use of an antibacterial or medicated talcum powder to help dry out the bump and reduce bacterial proliferation is generally recommended until medical advice can be obtained. (Use of talc is no longer recommended due to recently discovered associations with multiple cancers.) Piercings, however, are more likely to be victims of hypertrophic scarring than a cyst. Cheek piercings seem to be the piercing most prone to cysts due to the possible interruption of saliva ducts.

==Terminology==
Several synonyms exist for epidermoid cysts, including epidermal cyst, infundibular cyst, keratin cyst and epidermal inclusion cyst &quot;Epidermal inclusion cyst&quot; more specifically refers to implantation of epidermal elements into the dermis. The term &quot;infundibular cyst&quot; refers to the site of origin of the cyst: the infundibular portion of the hair follicle. The majority of epidermal inclusion cysts originate from the infundibular portion of the hair follicle, thus explaining the interchangeable, yet inaccurate, use of these two terms.

Epidermoid cyst may be classified as a sebaceous cyst, although technically speaking it is not sebaceous. &quot;True&quot; sebaceous cysts, cysts which originate from sebaceous glands and which contain sebum, are relatively rare and are known as steatocystoma simplex or, if multiple, as steatocystoma multiplex. Medical professionals have suggested that the term &quot;sebaceous cyst&quot; be avoided since it can be misleading. In practice, however, the term is still often used for epidermoid and pilar cysts.

<doc id="1258642" wikidata="Q2361344" url="?curid=1258642" title="Durvasa">
<text>In Hindu scriptures, Durvasa (, ), also known as Durvasas (), is a legendary rishi (sage). He is the son of Anasuya and Atri. According to some Puranas, Durvasa is a partial avatar of Shiva, known for his short temper. Wherever he goes, he is received with great reverence by humans and devas alike.

==Curses and boons==
The rishi Durvasa, being short-tempered, is said to have both cursed and gifted boons to several notable deities and people in the Hindu scriptures. Some of them include:

Curses
# Indra, whom he cursed to lose all his powers, after Indra&#x27;s elephant Airavata threw down a rather fragrant garland given by Durvasa to Indra.
# Saraswati, whom he cursed to be born as a human because she laughed at his incorrect recitation of the Vedas. Ubhay Bharati was the human incarnation of the Goddess Saraswati on the earth during 8th Century CE.
# Rukmini, whom he cursed to be separated from her husband, Krishna, because she drank water without seeking Durvasa&#x27;s permission.
# Shakuntala, who avoided Durvasa while at the ashrama (hermitage) of sage Kanva, which enraged Durvasa rishi, who cursed her that Dushyanta would forget her. Durvasa later clarified that Dushyanta would remember her when she presented his ring (that he had previously given to her) to him.
# Kandali, his wife, whom he cursed to be reduced to a heap of dust for excessively quarrelling with him. 
#Bhanumati, the daughter of Banu, the erstwhile leader of the Yadavas. Bhanumati provoked Durvasa while playing at the garden of Raivata, and in response, Durvasa cursed her. She, later in life, is abducted by the Danava Nikumbha. However, Durvasa clarified (after being pacified) that no harm would come to Bhanumati, and that she would be saved go on to marry the Pandava Sahadeva.

Boons 
# Krishna, whom he blessed with partial invulnerability. The Anushasana Parva, as related by Krishna to his son Pradyumna details the incident when Durvasa visited Krishna at Dvaraka, and requested that Krishna smear his own body with the payasam remaining after Durvasa had eaten. Krishna complied with this, and Durvasa blessed him with invulnerability in those parts of his body that he covered with the payasam, noting that Krishna never smeared the soles of his feet with it. Krishna would die years after the events of the Kurukshetra war by an arrow to his foot shot by a hunter who mistook it for a deer.
#Kunti, whom he taught mantras capable of summoning a deva to beget children. Karna is born to Kunti, and later the five Pandava brothers are born of Kunti&#x27;s and her co-wife Madri&#x27;s use of the mantras.
#Draupadi who gave him her clothes when his clothes were once swept away. Durvasa blessed her by saying that she would never lack clothes at the time of requirement, and it is due to his blessing that Dushasan was unable to strip off her clothes in the gambling hall due to lord krishna&#x27;s presence, thus protecting her modesty.

==Origin==

According to Chapter 44 of the Brahmanda Purana, Brahma and Shiva got into a heated quarrel. Shiva became violently enraged when the devas fled from his presence in fear. His consort, Parvati, complained that Shiva is now impossible to live with. Realizing the chaos his anger had caused, Shiva deposited this anger into Anasuya, the wife of sage Atri. From this portion of Shiva deposited into Anasuya, a child is born, named &#x27;Durvasa&#x27; (lit. &quot;one who is difficult to live with&quot;). Because he is born of Shiva&#x27;s anger, he had an irascible nature.

== Samudra Manthana ==

In Vishnu Purana, Vayu Purana, and the Padma Purana, a curse that Durvasa laid upon Indra is described as the indirect reason for the Samudra Manthana. The Srimad Bhagavata and Agni Purana also mention Durvasa&#x27;s involvement in the episode, without going into detail. Other sources for this story, such as Ramayana, Mahabharata, Harivamsa, and Matsya Purana, do not mention Durvasa&#x27;s involvement at all and ascribe the incident to other causes, such as the devas&#x27; and asuras&#x27; desire for immortality.

According to a story in the Vishnu Purana, Durvasa, while wandering the earth in a state of ecstasy due to a vow he is observing, came by a &quot;Vidyadhari&quot; (nymph of the air) and demanded her heavenly wreath of flowers. The nymph respectfully gave the garland to the sage, whereupon he wore it on his brow. Resuming his wanderings, the Durvasa came across Indra riding his elephant, Airavata, attended by the gods. Still, in his state of frenzy, Durvasa threw the garland at Indra, who caught it and placed it on Airavata&#x27;s head. The elephant is irritated by the fragrance of the nectar in the flowers, so it threw the garland to the ground with its trunk.

Durvasa is enraged to see his gift treated so callously and cursed Indra that he would be cast down from his position of dominion over the three worlds, just as the garland is cast down. Indra immediately begged Durvasa&#x27;s forgiveness, but the sage refused to retract or soften his curse. Because of the curse, Indra and the devas were diminished in strength and stripped of their lustre. Seizing this opportunity, the asuras led by Bali waged war against the gods.

The gods were routed and turned to Brahma for help. Brahma directed them to seek refuge with Vishnu. Vishnu, in turn, advised them to call a truce with the asuras, and help them churn the ocean of milk to obtain the amrita (nectar of immortality), on the pretext of sharing it with them. Vishnu promised that only the devas would drink the nectar to regain their former power, so they could once again defeat the asuras. The devas took Vishnu&#x27;s advice and called their truce with the asuras, and thus the gods and demons began planning their great enterprise.

==Ramayana==

In the Uttara Kanda of Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana, Durvasa appeared at Rama&#x27;s doorstep and, seeing Lakshmana guarding the door, demanded an audience with Rama. Meanwhile, Rama was having a private conversation with Yama (the god of death), disguised as an ascetic. Before the conversation, Yama gave Rama strict instructions that their dialogue is to remain confidential, and anyone who entered the room is to be executed. Rama agreed and entrusted Lakshmana with the duty of guarding his door and fulfilling his promise to Yama.

Hence, when Durvasa made his demand, Lakshmana politely asked the sage to wait until Rama had finished his meeting. Durvasa grew angry, and threatened to curse all of Ayodhya if Lakshmana did not immediately inform Rama of his arrival. Lakshmana, in a dilemma, decided it would be better that he alone die to save all of Ayodhya from falling under Durvasa&#x27;s curse, and so interrupted Rama&#x27;s meeting to inform him of the sage&#x27;s arrival. Rama quickly concluded his meeting with Yama and received the sage with due courtesy. Durvasa told Rama of his desire to be fed, and Rama fulfilled his guest&#x27;s request, whereupon the satisfied sage went on his way.

Rama is filled with sorrow, for he did not want to kill his beloved brother, Lakshmana. Still, he had given his word to Yama and could not go back on it. He called his advisers to help him resolve this quandary. On Vasishta&#x27;s advice, he ordered Lakshmana to leave him for good, since such abandonment is equivalent to death, as far as the pious were concerned. Lakshmana then went to the banks of the Sarayu, and resolved on giving up the world by drowning himself in the Sarayu river.

==Mahabharata==
In the Mahabharata, Durvasa is known for granting boons to those who pleased him, particularly when he had been served well as an honoured guest. An example of such behaviour is the episode between him and Kunti, the future wife of Pandu and the mother of the Pandavas. When Kunti is a young girl, she lived in the house of her adopted father, Kuntibhoja. Durvasa visited Kuntibhoja one day and sought his hospitality. The king entrusted the sage to his daughter&#x27;s care and tasked Kunti with the responsibility of entertaining the sage and meeting all his needs during his stay. Kunti patiently put up with Durvasa&#x27;s temper and his unreasonable requests (such as demanding food at odd hours of the night) and served the sage with great dedication. Eventually, the sage is gratified. Before departing, he rewarded Kunti by teaching her the Atharvaveda mantras, which enables a woman to invoke any god of her choice to beget children by them. Curious and skeptical, Kunti decided to test the mantra.

After invoking Surya, the sun god, she bore her first son, Karna. Fearing the fate of an unmarried mother, she placed the newborn in a basket and set him afloat down a river. The infant Karna is later found and raised by Adhiratha, a charioteer for the monarch of Hastinapura, and his wife, Radha. Soon after this episode, Kunti is married to Pandu, the king of Hastinapur, and, by invoking those same mantras taught to her by Durvasa, she bore the three eldest of Pandu&#x27;s five sons. Karna would go on to become an accomplished warrior and a formidable adversary of the Pandavas. This enmity would eventually culminate in his death on the battlefield of Kurukshetra at the hands of Arjuna, his younger half-brother, who is unaware of their fraternal bond. Apart from his hair-trigger anger, Durvasa is also known for his extraordinary boons. According to the Shiva Purana, once while bathing in a river, Durvasa&#x27;s clothes were carried away by the river&#x27;s currents. Seeing this, Draupadi, who is nearby, gave her own clothes to the sage. Durvasa blessed her by saying that she would never lack clothes at the time of requirement, and it is due to his blessing that the Kauravas were unable to strip off her clothes in the gambling hall, thus protecting her modesty.

Another example of Durvasa&#x27;s benevolent side is the incident when he granted Duryodhana a boon. During the Pandavas&#x27;s exile, Durvasa and several disciples arrived at Hastinapura. Duryodhana with his maternal uncle Shakuni managed to gratify the sage. Durvasa is pleased enough to grant him a boon. Duryodhana, secretly wanting Durvasa to curse the Pandavas in anger, asked the sage to visit his cousins in the forest after Draupadi had eaten her meal, knowing that the Pandavas would then have nothing to feed him.

Durvasa and his disciples visited the Pandavas in their hermitage in the forest, as per Duryodhana&#x27;s request. During this period of exile, the Pandavas would obtain their food by means of the Akshaya Patra, which would become exhausted each day once Draupadi finished her meal. Because Draupadi had already eaten by the time Durvasa arrived that day, there was no food left to serve him and the Pandavas were very anxious as to their fate should they fail to feed such a venerable sage. While Durvasa and his disciples were away bathing at the river, Draupadi prayed to Krishna for help.

Krishna immediately appeared before Draupadi, announcing that he was hungry and asked her for food. Draupadi grew exasperated, and said she had prayed to Krishna precisely because she had no food left to give. Krishna then told her to bring the Akshaya Patra to him. When she did, he partook of the lone grain of rice and a piece of vegetable that he found stuck to the vessel, and announced that he was satisfied by the &quot;meal&quot;.

This satiated the hunger of Durvasa and his disciples, as the satisfaction of Krishna (An avatar of Vishnu himself) meant the satiation of the hunger of all living things. Sage Durvasa and his disciples then quietly left after their bath, without returning to the Pandavas&#x27;s hermitage, for they were afraid of facing what they thought would be the Pandavas&#x27;s wrath at their impolite behaviour of refusing the food that would be served to them.

==Swaminarayan Hinduism==

According to the followers of Swaminarayan Hinduism, Narayana took birth as the saint Swaminarayan due to a curse by Durvasa. The story goes that shortly after Krishna&#x27;s passing, Uddhava proceeded to Badrinath, the abode of Nara-Narayana. He joined the many divine sages and saints who were there listening to Nara-Narayana&#x27;s discourses. As Nara is speaking, Durvasa arrived at the assembly from Mount Kailash, but no one noticed him because they were all so engrossed in the discourse.

He waited for one ghadi (24 minutes), for someone to welcome him with the respect he felt he is entitled to, but still, no one realized that he was there. Seeing no one rise to receive him, he took this as an insult, and cursed the entire assembly, saying that they would all be born as humans and suffer insults and agony from the wicked. Nara-Narayana&#x27;s parents, the god Dharma and goddess Bhakti, pacified Durvasa, who then reduced his curse, saying that Narayana himself (represented here as the Supreme Being) would be born as Dharma and Bhakti&#x27;s son, and that his birth would relieve them all from the clutches of evil. Proclaiming thus, Durvasa made his way back to Kailasha.

Dharma and Bhakti were eventually born as Hariprasad Pande (a.k.a. Dharmadev) and Premvati Pande (a.k.a. Bhaktidevi). Narayana is born as their son, named Ghanshyam, who is now known as Swaminarayan. The story is limited to Swaminarayan Hinduism, and no other Hindu scriptures support the tale.

<text>Bukharan Jews, in modern times called Bukharian Jews, are the Mizrahi Jewish sub-group of Central Asia that traditionally spoke Bukharian, a Judeo-Persian language most similar to the Tajik dialect of Farsi. Their name comes from the former Muslim-Uzbek polity Emirate of Bukhara which once had a sizable Jewish population. The vast majority lived in modern-day Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, with small groups in Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan.

Bukharan Jews are one of the oldest Jewish diaspora groups, dating back to the Babylonian exile, and comprise a branch of Persian speaking-Jewry. They are also one of the oldest ethno-religious groups in Central Asia.

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the great majority have immigrated to Israel or the United States, with others immigrating to Europe or Australia.

==Name==
The name by which the community originally called itself was Bnei Israel.

The term &quot;Bukharan&quot; was coined by European travelers who visited Central Asia around the 16th century. The Jewish community at the time lived in the Khanate of Bukhara, the Khanate of Khiva, and the Khanate of Kokand, with the term &quot;Bukharan&quot; likely being coined as the Bukharan Emirate was the largest of the three khanates.

The local populace referred to them as &quot;Yahūdī&quot; (Persian: یهودی) or &quot;Juhud&quot; (Persian:جهود), the latter of which was a pejorative term.

==Language==
The Jews in the Achaemenid Empire spoke Hebrew, Aramaic, and Persian. Persian would become the prominent language for Jews in Central Asia and Iran, though Jews who were educated in Jewish cheder&#x27;s spoke fluently in Hebrew, the latter of which lasted until the early 20th century. 

Up until the 19th century, Persian speakers in Central Asia (including Jews) had no name for the dialect/language and simply regarded themselves as speaking Farsi. By then, Bukharan Jews had dubbed their Judeo-Persian language &quot;Bukharian&quot; or &quot;Bukhori&quot;, itself most similar to the Tajik and Dari dialect of Farsi, with linguistic elements of Hebrew and Aramaic to communicate among themselves. 

This language, along with Hebrew was used for all cultural and educational life among the Jews. It was used widely until Central Asia was &quot;Russified&quot; by the Soviet Union and the dissemination of religious information was halted, as the Soviet Union wanted Russian as the lingua franca in the region. 

During the Soviet era, the two main languages spoken by Bukharan Jews were Bukharian and Russian (some also spoke in Uzbek, depending on where they worked or lived). The younger generation today either born outside Central Asia or who left as children generally use Russian as their secondary language, but sometimes do understand or speak &quot;Bukhori.&quot;

==History==

According to one legend, Bukharan Jews are exiles from the tribes of Naphtali and Issachar during the Assyrian captivity, basing this assumption on a reading of &quot;Habor&quot; at II Kings 17:6 as a reference to Bukhara. However, modern day scholarship associate this telling with European myths, where stories about the &quot;Ten Lost Tribes&quot; had been propagated in Europe. 

Historians associate their establishment in the region following the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus the Great, which became part of the Persian Empire. Cyrus granted all the Jews citizenship and allowed them to return to Israel, but a significant portion of the population chose to remain in Mesopotamia, later spreading to all parts of the Persian Empire. In the opinion of some scholars, Jews settled in Central Asia in the sixth century, but it is certain that during the eighth to ninth centuries they lived in Central Asian cities such as Balkh, Khwarezm, Bukhara, Samarkand, and Merv. At that time, and until approximately the sixteenth century, Bukharan Jews formed a homogeneous group with the Jews of Iran and Afghanistan. 

The first primary written account of Jews in Central Asia dates to the beginning of the 4th century CE. It is recalled in the Talmud by Rabbi Shmuel bar Bisna, a member of the Talmudic academy in Pumbeditha, who traveled to Margiana (present-day Merv in Turkmenistan). The presence of Jewish communities in Merv is also proven by Jewish writings on ossuaries from the 5th and 6th centuries, uncovered between 1954 and 1956.

===Under the Kara-Khanid Khanate===
In the 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela, a Jewish traveler from Spain, wrote of the populous Jewish community in Samarkand and claimed that there were about 50,000 &quot;Israelites&quot; in that city, among them &quot;very wise and rich men.&quot; 

===Under the rule of Tamerlane===
In the 14th century under the rule of Timur in the Timurid Empire, Jewish weavers and dyers contributed greatly to his effort to rebuild Central Asia following Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasions. In the centuries following Timur&#x27;s demise, Jews came to dominate the region’s textile and dye industry. 

===Splintering of the Judeo-Persian communities===
Until the start of the 16th century, the Jews of Iran and Central Asia constituted one community. However, during the Safavid dynasty, Iran adopted the Shia branch of Islam, while Central Asia retained their allegiance to the Sunni branch of Islam. Due to the hostile relationship between the neighboring states because of this, the links between the Jews of the area were severed, and the Jewish community was divided into two similar but separate communities. From here, a distinct point of origin of the ethnonym and cultural identity of &quot;Bukharan Jews&quot; began to take formation. 

A similar event happened in the middle of the 18th century with the Jews of Afghanistan, which saw the creation of the Afghani kingdom, ruled by the Durrani dynasty, while the Emirate of Bukhara was ruled by the Manghud dynasty. Due to the hostile relationship between the two dynasties, the ties between the Jews of Afghanistan and Bukharan Jews were split into two similar but separate communities. 

Over the centuries, whether it was to escape political turmoil, persecution, or to pursue economic opportunities, Jews from Iran and Central Asia would frequently migrate to each other&#x27;s communities. Notable instances that spurred such migrations include Jews from Iran fleeing persecution under the Safavid dynasty in the mid 17th century, and Jews from the cities of Kabul and Herat fleeing forced conversion to Islam in the mid 19th century. Other Jews from Iran and Afghanistan came during the Russian conquest of Central Asia, where the Russians had extended greater freedoms and economic opportunities for Jews. When Joseph Stalin and Soviet authorities established their hold over the borders in Central Asia in the mid 1930s (which resulted in a drastic deterioration of living conditions for the Bukharan Jews) a significant number migrated to Iran or Afghanistan. 

===Under Sunni Muslim rule===

In the Khanate of Bukhara, Bukharan Jews lived under the status of &quot;Dhimmi,&quot; and experienced a series of discriminatory practices from the Muslim majority. They were forced to wear clothing that identified them as Jews, such as a yellow patch, a hat called a &quot;Tilpak,&quot; and had their belts made of rope, while the leather belts were reserved for Muslims. Jewish homes also had to be marked as &quot;Jewish&quot; with a dirty cloth nailed to their front doors, and their stores and homes had to be lower than Muslim ones. In court cases, any evidence from a Jew was inadmissible involving a Muslim. They were also forbidden to ride horses and donkeys and had to transport themselves by foot. Lastly, when paying their annual Jizya tax, the Jewish men would be ritually slapped in the face by Muslim authorities. Despite these prohibitions and humiliations, the Jews were able to achieve financial success primarily as merchants and established lucrative trade businesses.

Towards the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century, the Jewish quarter, Mahalla, was established in the town of Bukhara. The Jews were forbidden to reside outside its boundaries.

During the 18th century, Bukharan Jews continued to face considerable discrimination and persecution. Jewish centers were closed down, and the Muslims of the region forced conversion on a significant number of Jews (over one-third, according to one estimate), under a threat of torture and agonizing execution. Some were killed for refusing to convert. These Jews who forcibly converted were known as &quot;Chala&#x27;s,&quot; a term meaning &quot;neither this nor that.&quot; 

By the middle of the 18th century, practically all Bukharan Jews lived in the Bukharan Emirate. In the early 1860s, Arminius Vambery, a Hungarian-Jewish traveler, visited the emirate disguised as a Sunni &quot;dervish,&quot; writing in his journals that the Jews of Bukhara &quot;live in utmost oppression, being despised by everyone.&quot;

===Rabbi Yosef Maimon===

In 1793, a missionary kabbalist named Rabbi Yosef Maimon, who was a Sephardic Jew originally from Tetuan, Morocco, travelled to Bukhara to collect/solicit money from Jewish patrons. It was during his search for funds that he chose to stay, in order to strengthen Judaism within the local Jewish population, who were said to be in a state of disarray. 

Prior to Maimon&#x27;s arrival, the native Jews of Bukhara followed the Persian religious tradition. Maimon staunchly demanded that the native Jews of Bukhara adopt Sephardic traditions. Many of the native Jews were opposed to this and the community split into two factions. The opposing faction was led by Rabbi Zacchariah ben Mashiah, who was originally from Sana&#x27;a, Yemen. The followers of the Maimon clan eventually won the struggle for religious authority over the native Bukharans, and Bukharan Jewry forcefully switched to Sephardi customs. The supporters of the Maimon clan, in the conflict, credit Maimon with causing a revival of Jewish practice among Bukharan Jews which they claim was in danger of dying out. However, there is evidence that there were Torah scholars present upon his arrival to Bukhara, but because they followed the Persian rite their practices were aggressively rejected as incorrect by Maimon. 

Maimon&#x27;s great-grandson Shimon Hakham continued his great-grandfather&#x27;s work as a Rabbi, and in 1870 opened the &quot;Talmid Hakham&quot; yeshiva in Bukhara, where religious law was promoted. At that time Bukharan Jews were getting only a general education, which mostly consisted of religious laws, reading, writing and some math. Even though they studied Torah, many Bukharan Jews did not speak fluent Hebrew. Only a few books were written in Persian and many of them were old and incomplete. Hakham decided to change this situation by translating religious books into Bukhori. But since there was no printing in Bukhara at that time, he went to Jerusalem to print his books.

===Under Imperial Russia rule=== 

In 1865, Russian colonial troops took over Tashkent and established the Russian Turkestan region, as part of their expanding empire. Unlike the Jews of Eastern Europe, Tsarist Russia was largely favorable towards the Jews living there, due to years of trade relations with the Bukharan Jews, and they were viewed as potential allies in the region to act as interpreters with the local authorities. As a Russian official explained in 1866:

&quot;Whatever we know of the interior of Bukhara we are chiefly indebted for its Jewish inhabitants... Upon the whole the Jews of Bukhara are much shrewder than their oppressive masters, and able to converse on subjects of which a genuine Bokharan has no idea.&quot; 

In spring of 1868, Russian authorities relied on Jewish support when their armies attacked the Emirate of Bukhara, as young Jewish men acted as scouts for the Russians and brought food and drinks to the Russian troops.

An 1884 report by Vasily Radlov described how the Bukharan Jews viewed Tsarist Russia rule:

&quot;The Jew, who in Europe has lived for centuries in enmity with the Christian, welcomes him here with a shining gaze (…) and is delighted to be able to wave a greeting to him. He proudly regards him as his new friend, his protector. In his proximity, he looks down on the Mohammedan with contempt.&quot;

Dubbed the &quot;Golden Age&quot; for Bukharan Jews, from 1876 to 1916 they were no longer restricted in their autonomy and had the same rights as their Muslim neighbors. Dozens of Bukharan Jews held prestigious jobs in medicine, law, and government, and many of them prospered. Many Bukharan Jews became successful and well-respected actors, artists, dancers, musicians, singers, film producers, and sportsmen. Several Bukharan entertainers became artists of merit and gained the title &quot;People&#x27;s Artist of Uzbekistan&quot;, &quot;People&#x27;s Artist of Tajikistan&quot;, and even (in the Soviet era) &quot;People&#x27;s Artist of the Soviet Union&quot;. Many succeeded in the world of sport, with several Bukharan Jews in Uzbekistan becoming renowned boxers and winning many medals for the country.

===Hibbat Zion and immigrating into Ottoman Palestine ===


Beginning from 1872, Bukharan Jews began to move into the region of Ottoman Palestine, motivated by religious convictions and the desire to return to their ancestral homeland. The land on which they settled in Jerusalem was named the Bukharan Quarter (Sh&#x27;hunat HaBucharim) and still exists today. In 1890, seven members of the Bukharan Jewish community formed the Hovevei Zion Association of the Jewish communities of Bukhara, Samarkand and Tashkent. In 1891, the association bought land and drew up a charter stating that the new quarter would be built in the style of Europe&#x27;s major cities. Architect Conrad Schick was employed to design the neighborhood. The streets were three times wider than even major thoroughfares in Jerusalem at the time, and spacious mansions were built with large courtyards. The homes were designed with neo-Gothic windows, European tiled roofs, neo-Moorish arches and Italian marble. Facades were decorated with Jewish motifs such as the Star of David and Hebrew inscriptions.

Rabbi Shimon Hakham and Rabbi Shlomo Moussaieff were some of the organizers of the quarter where Bukharan homes, synagogues, schools, libraries, and a bath house were established.

The Bukharan Quarter was one of the most affluent sections of the city, populated by Bukharan Jewish merchants and religious scholars supported primarily by various trading activities such as cotton, gemstones, and tea from Central Asia. Following World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution, the quarter fell into decline as sources of income from foreign trade became cut off leaving many residents with little more than just their homes in Jerusalem, forcing them to subdivide and rent out rooms to bring in income. From being lauded as one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in the city, the Bukharian Quarter earned the opposite sobriquet, of being one of the poorest neighborhoods of Jerusalem. In the 1920s and 1930s, the neighborhood also became one of the centers of the Zionist movement with many of its leaders and philosophers living there.

Between 1953 and 1963, Rabbi Bernard M. Casper was working as Dean for Student Affairs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and during this period he became deeply concerned about the impoverished Quarter. After his appointment as Chief Rabbi in South Africa he set up a special fund for the Quarter&#x27;s improvement and this was tied with Prime Minister Menachem Begin&#x27;s urban revitalization program, Project Renewal. Johannesburg was twinned with the Bukharan Quarter, and Johannesburg Jewry raised enormous funds for its rehabilitation. Frustrated by the lack of progress, Casper traveled to Jerusalem in 1981 to resolve the hurdles. He consulted with community organizer Moshe Kahan and suggested that they present the dormant agencies with concrete evidence of what could be done. Using a private discretionary fund, he initiated development of several pilot projects, among them a free loan fund, a dental clinic and a hearing center whose successes spurred the municipality back on track.

The quarter borders Tel Arza on the west, the Shmuel HaNavi neighborhood on the north, Arzei HaBira on the east, and Geula on the south. Today, most of the residents are Haredi Jews.

===Under Soviet Union rule===

Following the Soviet capture of Bukhara and the creation of the Soviet Social Republics of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, synagogues were destroyed or closed down, and were replaced by Soviet institutions. Consequently many Bukharan Jews fled to the West. 

Stalin&#x27;s decision to end Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy and initiate the First five-year plan in the late 1920s resulted in a drastic deterioration of living conditions for the Bukharan Jews. By the time Soviet authorities established their hold over the borders in Central Asia in the mid 1930s, many tens of thousands of households from Central Asia had crossed the border into Iran and Afghanistan, amongst them some 4,000 Bukharan Jews who were heading towards Mandatory Palestine.

Soviet doctrines, ideology and nationalities policy had a large impact on the everyday life, culture and identity of the Bukharan Jews. Bukharan Jews who had put efforts into creating a Bukharan Jewish Soviet culture and national identity were charged during Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, or, as part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s nationalities policies and nation building campaigns, were forced to assimilate into the larger Soviet Uzbek or Soviet Tajik national identities, but the community still attempted to preserve their traditions while displaying loyalty to the new government. 

During this time, both Jews and Muslims suffered from the anti-religious policies the Soviets imposed on Central Asia, which aimed to break the power of their religious institutions and eventually replace religious belief with atheism.
In 1950 the &quot;Black Years of Soviet Jewry&quot; began where suppression of the Jewish religion resumed after stopping due to World War II. After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s attempt to turn the newly founded state of Israel into a socialist country failed, an anti-Israel, anti-Zionist and antisemitic campaign launched against Soviet Jews. Several religious and prominent Bukharan Jews were arrested and sentenced to 25 years on charges of &quot;Zionist propagation.&quot; Even those who uttered the traditional phrase said by Jews on the Passover holiday, &quot;Next Year in Jerusalem&quot;, were subject to arrests. These arrests were all part of the Soviet anti-cosmopolitan campaign, where antisemitism was often disguised under the banner of anti-Zionism.

After the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, and later the Six-Day Arab–Israeli War of 1967, antisemitism intensified amongst the Muslim majority, with the 1967 war leading to a rise in Jewish patriotism. The Soviet Union forbade Jews to make aliyah to Israel, though these restrictions loosened in the 1970s and were dropped in the 1980s.

===Relationship between other Jewish communities===
After the Russian conquest of Central Asia, a small amount of Ashkenazi Jews emigrated from Eastern Europe and the European part of the Russian Empire to Russian Turkestan. During World War II, large migrations of Ashkenazi Jewish refugees from the European regions of the Soviet Union headed eastward to various republics in Central Asia. The Bukharan Jewish communities helped contribute to the resettlement of these refugees, housing families in their homes and assisted them with finding jobs until they settled in to their new surroundings. 

Despite this, Bukharan and Ashkenazi Jews remained separate from one another, and intermarriage between the two was extremely rare. Bukharan Jews ranged from religious to traditional, and clustered together (particular those who lived in the Jewish Quarters), while most Ashkenazi Jews living in Central Asia were secular, both structurally and culturally, and assimilated into the general populace. Some Bukharan Jews viewed Ashkenazi Jews as inauthentic Jews, and looked down on them for their lack of Jewish identity.

However, Bukharan Jewry had good relations with the Chabad-Lubavitch, beginning from the end of the 19th century with the arrival of Rabbi Shlomo Leib Eliezrov, a student of Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn. Rabbi Eliezrov accepted a temporary rabbinical position in Uzbekistan and helped organize the provision of kosher meat in surrounding cities where Jews lived. Over the decades, other emissaries from Chabad would come to support the community as well.

There were also numerous Jews from other Eastern countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and Morocco who migrated into Central Asia (by way of the Silk Road), and were absorbed into the Bukharan Jewish community.

===Mass migration after 1991===
In the late 1980s to the late 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and foundation of the independent Republic of Uzbekistan in 1991, most of the remaining Bukharan Jews left Central Asia for the United States, Israel, Europe, or Australia in the last mass emigration of Bukharan Jews from their resident lands. 

Some left due to economic instability, while others left fearing growth of nationalistic policies in the country. The resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan (such as the Fergana massacre and the 1990 Dushanbe riots) prompted an increase in the level of emigration of Jews. According to various Bukharan Jews, the Uzbek and Tajik locals would come to Jewish homes and would often say things in line with &quot;Go back to where you came from. You don&#x27;t belong here.&quot; Because of this, they also found it difficult to sell their homes at a reasonable price. In 1990, there were riots against the Jewish population of Andijan and nearby areas. This led to most Jews in the Fergana Valley immigrating to Israel or the United States.

==Immigrant populations==
===Tajikistan===

In early 2006, the still active Dushanbe Synagogue in Tajikistan as well as the city&#x27;s mikveh (ritual bath), kosher butcher, and Jewish schools were demolished by the government (without compensation to the community) to make room for the new Palace of Nations. After an international outcry, the government of Tajikistan announced a reversal of its decision and publicly claimed that it would permit the synagogue to be rebuilt on its current site. However, in mid-2008, the government of Tajikistan destroyed the whole synagogue and started construction of the Palace of Nations. The Dushanbe synagogue was Tajikistan&#x27;s only synagogue, and the community were therefore left without a center or a place to pray. In 2009, the Tajik government reestablished the synagogue in a different location for the small Jewish community.

As of the 2010 census, there are 36 Jews left in Tajikistan. All but two are Ashkenazi Jews, while the others are Bukharan. On January 15, 2021, Jura Abaev, the last Jew in the city of Khujand, Tajikistan died.

===Afghanistan===

As Afghanistan is a landlocked country located between Central Asia and South Asia, the Jews who lived in Afghanistan are sometimes considered to be the same as Bukharan Jews, though some Jews from Afghanistan identify solely as &quot;Afghan Jews.&quot;

With the Kazakh famine of 1930–1933, a significant number of Bukharan Jews crossed the border into the Kingdom of Afghanistan as part of the wider famine-related refugee crisis; leaders of the communities petitioned Jewish communities in Europe and the United States for support. In total, some 60,000 refugees had fled from the Soviet Union and reached Afghanistan. 

In 1935, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported that &quot;ghetto rules&quot; had been imposed on Afghan Jews, requiring them to wear particular clothes, requiring Jewish women to stay outside markets, requiring all Jews to live within certain distances from mosques and banning Jews from riding horses. In 1935, a delegate to the World Zionist Congress claimed that an estimated 40,000 Bukharan Jews had been killed or starved to death.

By the end of 2004, only two known Jews were left in Afghanistan, Zablon Simintov and Isaac Levy (born c. 1920). Levy relied on charity to survive, while Simintov ran a store selling carpets and jewelry until 2001. They lived on opposite sides of the dilapidated Kabul synagogue. In January 2005, Levy died of natural causes, leaving Simintov as the sole known Jew in Afghanistan. 

Due to decades of warfare, antisemitism, and religious persecution, there are officially no Jews remaining in Afghanistan today.

===United States===

The largest number of Bukharan Jews in the U.S. is in New York City. In Forest Hills, Queens, 108th Street, often referred to as &quot;Bukharan Broadway&quot; or &quot;Bukharian Broadway&quot;, is filled with Bukharan restaurants and gift shops. Furthermore, Forest Hills is nicknamed &quot;Bukharlem&quot; due to the majority of the population being Bukharan. They have formed a tight-knit enclave in this area that was once primarily inhabited by Ashkenazi Jews. Congregation Tifereth Israel in Corona, Queens, a synagogue founded in the early 1900s by Ashkenazi Jews, became Bukharan in the 1990s. Kew Gardens, Queens, also has a very large population of Bukharan Jews. Although Bukharan Jews in Queens remain insular in some ways (living in close proximity to each other, owning and patronizing clusters of stores, and attending their own synagogue rather than other synagogues in the area), they have connections with non-Bukharans in the area. 
In December 1999, the First Congress of the Bukharian Jews of the United States and Canada convened in Queens. In 2007, Bukharan-American Jews initiated lobbying efforts on behalf of their community. Zoya Maksumova, president of the Bukharan women&#x27;s organization &quot;Esther Hamalka&quot; said &quot;This event represents a huge leap forward for our community. Now, for the first time, Americans will know who we are.&quot; Senator Joseph Lieberman intoned, &quot;God said to Abraham, &#x27;You&#x27;ll be an eternal people&#x27;… and now we see that the State of Israel lives, and this historic [Bukharan] community, which was cut off from the Jewish world for centuries in Central Asia and suffered oppression during the Soviet Union, is alive and well in America. God has kept his promise to the Jewish people.&quot;

==Culture==
===Dress codes===

Bukharan Jews had their own dress code, similar to but also different from other cultures (mainly Turco-Mongol) living in Central Asia, which they were wore as their daily attire until the Soviet Union, though was still worn during communal events. Today, the traditional kaftan (Jomah-ҷома-ג&#x27;אמה in Bukhori and Tajik) is worn during weddings and Bar Mitzvahs.

Bukharan Jews also have a unique kippah, a full head-sized covering with rich patterns and lively colors embroidered. In present times, this kippah can sometimes be seen being worn by liberal-leaning and Reform Jews.

===Music===

The Bukharan Jews have a distinct musical tradition called shashmaqam, which is an ensemble of stringed instruments, infused with Central Asian rhythms, and a considerable klezmer influence as well as Muslim melodies, and even Spanish chords. The main instrument is the dayereh. Shashmaqam music &quot;reflect[s] the mix of Hassidic vocals, Indian and Islamic instrumentals and Sufi-inspired texts and lyrical melodies.&quot; They were heavily responsible for sustaining and transmitting the music during the Soviet era, and later when immigrating to the United States. Ensemble Shashmaqam was one of the first New York-based ensembles created to showcase the music and dance of Bukharan Jews.

An account from explorer Henry Lansdell in 1885, upon visiting Samarkand and hearing the music of the Bukharan Jews:
We went then to the synagogue, allowed to the Jews of Samarkand only since the Russians came, where the best chorister in the region was that evening to sing. The crowd was dense, and in a short time two singers appeared; the “primo,” a delicate, modest-looking man, who blushed at the eagerness with which his arrival was awaited, whilst the “secondo” was a brazen-faced fellow, who carried his head on one side, as if courting attention, and with the assurance that he should have it. They were introduced to us, and began at once, that we might hear. The singing, so called, was the most remarkable that up to that time I had ever heard. The first voice led off in a key so high, that he had to strain for some seconds before he could utter a sound at all. After this he proceeded very slowly as to the number of words he sang, but prolonged his notes into numerous flourishes, screaming as loud as he could in falsetto. The second voice was an accompaniment for the first; but as both bawled as loudly as possible, I soon voted it anything but good music, and intimated that it was time for us to go. The congregation, moreover, were crowding round, without the smallest semblance of their being engaged in divine worship. 

===Weddings and marriage traditions===

Bukharan Jews celebrated their weddings in several stages leading up to the wedding ceremony. When a match between a couple was accepted, an engagement (&quot;Shirini-Khori&quot;) took place in the house of the bride. Following this, the Rabbi congratulated the father of the bride on the engagement and distributed sugar to those present. Other sweets were distributed towards relatives, notifying them that the engagement had taken place. After engagement, the meeting between parents of the groom and bride was carried out in the house of the bride, where refreshments and gifts from the groom were sent. Further celebrations lasted a week in the house of the groom, where relatives of the groom brought gifts to the bride. 

Before the wedding, a unique practice that was done was a &quot;Kosh-Chinon&quot; ceremony, a local custom practiced by both Jews and Muslims in Central Asia, which involved all the female guests of the wedding to pluck the bride&#x27;s eyebrows and the strands of hair above her lip, as well as the sides of the bride&#x27;s face being cleaned of their dark wisps. Girls in Central Asia were taught that they shouldn&#x27;t manicure their facial hair until they got married. The smooth, clean face served as a mark of womanhood. This ceremony was done a few days before the wedding, and after the bride had immersed herself in the Mikveh. 

The wedding itself followed the same traditions as a standard Jewish wedding, including the signing of the Ketubah, the Chuppah, and the Kiddish. A few small differences were the &quot;Chuppah&quot; being a prayer shawl that was held by members of the family, unlike it being hung on four poles as is widely practiced today in Jewish weddings. Furthermore, as the bride and groom would take their positions in the prayer shawl, the mothers of the bride and groom would stitch their needles through the fabric of their children&#x27;s clothing. 

===Cuisine===
The cooking of Bukharan Jews is based on traditional Central Asian cuisine, along with some uniquely Bukharan Jewish dishes such as bakhsh and osh savo, subject to the restrictions of Jewish dietary laws. 

The Bukharians&#x27; Jewish identity was always preserved in the kitchen. &quot;Even though we were in exile from Jerusalem, we observed kashruth,&quot; said Isak Masturov, another owner of Cheburechnaya. &quot;We could not go to restaurants, so we had to learn to cook for our own community.&quot;

Authentic Bukharan Jewish dishes include:

* &quot;Osh palov&quot; – a Bukharan Jewish version of palov for weekdays, includes both beef and chicken.
* &quot;Bakhsh&quot; – &quot;green palov&quot;, rice with meat or chicken and green herbs (coriander, parsley, dill), exists in two varieties; bakhshi &quot;khaltagi&quot; cooked Jewish-style in a small bag immersed in a pot with boiling water or soup and bakhshi &quot;degi&quot; cooked like regular palov in a cauldron; bakhshi &quot;khaltagi&quot; is precooked and therefore can be served on Shabbat.
*&quot;Oshi sabo&quot; (also &quot;osh savo&quot; or &quot;osovoh&quot;), a &quot;meal in a pot&quot; slowly cooked overnight and eaten hot for Shabbat lunch. Oshi sabo is made with meat, rice, vegetables, and fruit added for a unique sweet and sour taste. By virtue of its culinary function (a hot Shabbat meal in Jewish homes) and ingredients (rice, meat, vegetables cooked together overnight), oshi sabo is a Bukharan version of cholent or hamin.
* &quot;Khalta savo&quot; – food cooked in a bag (usually rice and meat, possibly with the addition of dried fruit).
* &quot;Yakhni&quot; – a dish consisting of two kinds of boiled meat (beef and chicken), brought whole to the table and sliced before serving with a little broth and a garnish of boiled vegetables; a main course for Friday night dinner.
* &quot;Kov roghan&quot; – fried pieces of chicken with fried potatoes piled on top.
* &quot;Serkaniz&quot; (&quot;Sirkoniz&quot;) – garlic rice dish, another variation of palov.
* &quot;Oshi piyozi&quot; – stuffed onion.
* &quot;Shulah&quot; – a Bukharan-style risotto.
* &quot;Boyjon&quot; – eggplant puree mixed only with salt and garlic, the traditional starter for the Friday-night meal in Bukharan Jewish homes.
* &quot;Slotah Bukhori&quot; – a salad made with tomato, cucumber, green onion, cilantro, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Some also put in lettuce and chili pepper.
* &quot;Bichak&quot; - stuffed baked or fried pastry, traditional for Rosh Hashanah and Sukkot. 
*&quot;Samsa&quot; - pastries filled with spiced meat or vegetables, are baked in a unique, hollowed out tandoor oven, and greatly resemble the preparation and shape of Indian samosas.
* &quot;Noni Toki&quot; – a crispy flat bread that is baked on the back of a wok. This method creates a bowl-shaped bread.
* Fried fish with garlic sauce (for Friday night dinner): &quot;Every Bukharian Sabbath ... is greeted with a dish of fried fish covered with a pounded sauce of garlic and cilantro&quot;. In the Bukharan dialect, the dish is called or in full , where is fried fish and is garlic sauce (literally &quot;garlic water&quot;). Bread is sometimes fried and then dipped in the remaining garlic water and is called .
*&quot;Chakchak,&quot; a popular sweet made from unleavened dough cut and rolled into hazelnut-sized balls, which are then deep-fried in oil. Optionally, hazelnuts or dried fruit (e.g. apricots and raisins) are added to the mixture. The fried balls are stacked in a mound in a special mold and drenched with hot honey.

== Genetics ==
In autosomal analyses, Bukharan Jews form a close genetic cluster with Iranian Jews, Iraqi Jews, Mountain Jews, Georgian Jews, and Kurdish Jews, and are genetically completely distinct to their local neighbors. This cluster plots between Levantine and Northern West Asian populations.

Among non-Jewish populations, Bukharan Jews also form a cluster with other West Asian people including Kurds, Iranians, Armenians, Assyrians, and Levantine Arabs.

<text>On December 9, 1974, the sesquicentennial celebration of the Battle of Ayacucho, the site of Simón Bolívar&#x27;s final victory over Spain, eight Hispanic American nations stated their intention to consider arms limitations. Representatives from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela jointly declared the need to &quot;create conditions which permit effective limitation of armaments and put an end to their acquisition for offensive military purposes, in order to dedicate all possible resources to economic development.&quot;

By 1975 the declaration&#x27;s signers had reached a consensus on prohibiting a range of weapons and equipment, including nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons; ballistic missiles; aircraft carriers; cruisers; and nuclear submarines. Colombia also remained adamant in opposing the introduction of strategic missiles into the region—a move favored by neighboring Venezuela—as well as all models of bomber aircraft.

In September 1980, Colombia joined with three of the declaration&#x27;s original signers plus Costa Rica in agreeing upon the Charter of Conduct, which reaffirmed support for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and for the principles of the 1974 declaration.

<text>Robert Francis Ray (born 8 April 1947) is an Australian former politician who was a Labor Party senator from 1981 to 2008, representing the state of Victoria.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ray was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and educated at Monash University, Melbourne, where he graduated in arts and education. He worked as a teacher in government schools and as a taxi-driver before entering politics.

===Political career===
A leading member of the right-wing faction of the ALP, Ray defeated a left-wing senator, Jean Melzer, in a ballot for a place on the party&#x27;s Senate ticket. This caused great bitterness in the Socialist Left faction. He was elected to the Senate at the October 1980 election, taking his seat on 1 July 1981.

In the Hawke Labor government Ray was Minister for Home Affairs 1987–88, Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs 1988–90 (with a seat in the Cabinet), and Minister for Defence 1990–96. In this portfolio he strongly supported Hawke&#x27;s decision to send Australian forces to support the United Nations in the Gulf War, despite bitter opposition from the left.

After the defeat of the Keating government in 1996 election, Ray did not seek election to the Opposition Shadow Ministry, but remained a powerful figure in the Labor Party, acting as a key factional supporter of Opposition Leader Kim Beazley 1996–2001. His influence diminished when Mark Latham became Leader in 2003. He did not stand for re-election at the 2007 election, which meant that his Senate term was due to expire on 30 June 2008. He formally resigned from Parliament on 5 May 2008, having spent two more days in the Senate as a member of government than as a member of the Opposition. The casual vacancy was filled by Jacinta Collins.

<text>Enniskerry (historically &quot;Annaskerry&quot;, from ) is a village in County Wicklow, Ireland. The population was 2,008 at the 2022 census.

==Location==

The village is situated on the Glencullen River in the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains in the east of the island, just 5 minutes south of the Dublin border and some south of Dublin city centre. The R117 road, colloquially known as &quot;The Twenty-One Bends&quot; connects the town to the main N11 road to Dublin. The 185 Go-Ahead Ireland route connects the village hourly to Bray, the nearest large town. The 44 Dublin Bus route connects the village with Dublin city centre.

==History==

Enniskerry is a planned estate village dating from the 1840s, with the original buildings designed in a neo-Tudor style.

The Protestant population of the village attended church in the grounds of the Powerscourt Demesne until 1859. Mervyn Wingfield, 7th Viscount Powerscourt built a new church, Saint Patrick&#x27;s, in the village which was completed two years later, in 1861. This coincided with an extensive renovation programme that also established the Italian gardens at Powerscourt. The Viscount Powerscourt claimed the old church following the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland by the Irish Church Act 1869. The consequences were that only those with a right to be buried next to the old church within the Demesne could claim these rights thereafter.

Powerscourt Estate, comprising a large house and gardens today occupying , is located near the town and is a popular visitor attraction. The extensive formal gardens form the grounds of an 18th-century Palladian house, designed by Richard Cassels, which was destroyed by fire in 1974, and lay as a shell until extensive restorations were carried out in 1996. Powerscourt Waterfall in the grounds of the estate, at 121 metres, is the highest waterfall in Ireland. 

==Culture==

===Film===

In 1944, Enniskerry was the setting for some scenes of Laurence Olivier&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Henry V&quot;.

&quot;Johnny Nobody&quot; (released in 1961) was partly filmed in Enniskerry.

Scenes from a number of other films, including &quot;P.S I Love You&quot; (2007) &quot;Into the West&quot; (1992) and &quot;Leap Year&quot; (2010) were also shot locally.

Scenes for the 2022 Disney film &quot;Disenchanted&quot; were shot in Enniskerry.

===Television===
From 1996 to 2001, along with Avoca, County Wicklow, it played host to the television series &quot;Ballykissangel&quot;. On 16 March 2009, Meredith Vieira and Al Roker broadcast live in Enniskerry for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;.

==Transport==
The Bray and Enniskerry Railway was proposed in the 19th century, to link the town to Bray. Some initial work was carried out, including building a bridge to carry the railway over Dublin Corporation&#x27;s Vartry watermain. Wicklow County Council recently removed much of the railway embankment in road widening, but left the bridge, which is directly opposite the ornate bridge carrying the watermain over the Cookstown River, a tributary of the River Dargle. The plan ran into financial difficulties, and the rails were lifted and sold off.
The 44 Bus to DCU via Dundrum and St. Stephen&#x27;s Green now has a terminus in Enniskerry (operated by Dublin Bus), whilst the 185 Bus to Bray goes through the village (operated by Go-Ahead Ireland).

==Sports==
There are two soccer clubs located in the village; Enniskerry Football Club and Enniskerry Youth Club.

Enniskerry Football Club was founded in the early 1970s as Enniskerry Schoolboys Football Club. The club, which now fields teams of boys and girls, is based in the Bog Meadow. Enniskerry FC participates in the Metropolitan Girls League with all-girls teams, the Wicklow Schoolboys/Girls Soccer League for their all-boys teams and the Athletic Union League for the men&#x27;s team.

Enniskerry Youth Club have several teams playing at adult and youth level.

There is also a Gaelic football club and Enniskerry Boxing Club located at St Mary&#x27;s GAA grounds.

==Religion==
Strong ecumenical links have been forged over the years between the Roman Catholic parish of St Mary and the Church of Ireland parish of St Patrick, Powerscourt, both in the village of Enniskerry. For Volkstrauertag 2022, the Roman Catholic priest Bernard Kennedy led his congregation in &quot;an Ecumenical prayer for peace with interfaith elements&quot;, joining Lutheran, Catholic and Jewish communities in Enniskerry. Other clergymen have previously spoken out about the strong ties that exist between Christian communities in the area.

<text>Ernest Martin Skinner (January 15, 1866 – November 26/27, 1960) was an American pipe organ builder whose innovations in electro-pneumatic switching systems significantly influenced organ-building technology in the early 20th century.

==Life and Career==
Skinner was born in Clarion, Pennsylvania to touring concert singers Washington and Alice Skinner. His father organized a music company in Taunton, Massachusetts and sang in a quartet in Taunton&#x27;s Unitarian Church. It was at this church that Skinner encountered his first organ and experienced live music for the first time, during a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan songs. He got a job as a bellows pumper at Taunton&#x27;s Baptist church for fifteen cents per hour, where he first gained experience repairing and constructing organs.

When he was a teenager, the family moved to West Somerville, Massachusetts, where he attended high school for six months. In his autobiography, he stated that the reason for his leaving school was due to his inability to understand Latin, but Dorothy Holden attributes it in her biography &quot;The Life and Work of Ernest M. Skinner&quot;, to the fact that the family&#x27;s fortunes had declined and Skinner had to help support them.

Skinner became a &quot;shop boy&quot; for George H. Ryder, a small organ builder located in Reading, Massachusetts. He was fired after four years, which led to his employment at the shop of a prominent Boston organ builder, George Hutchings, following Ryder&#x27;s foreman Horace Marden, and voicer William H. Dolbeer. He began at Hutchings&#x27; shop working as a tuner. After twelve years at the firm, Skinner climbed to the position of factory superintendent.

In 1893 in Bethel, Maine, he married Bethel native Mabel Hastings.

The 1897 Hutchings organ at the Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Boston drew national attention for Hutchings, though he did not credit Ernest Skinner in its success.

Skinner made the first of two publicly known trips to England, crossing the Atlantic on a cattle steamer, in 1898. There, Skinner was introduced to the work of Henry Willis, the London builder whose high-pressure chorus reeds and tuba &#x27;organ stop&#x27; set the benchmark for much of the 20th century. Skinner was given access to the large organ at St George&#x27;s Hall, Liverpool, and met privately with Willis who tutored him in voicing practices and techniques not yet known in the United States. 

Skinner then visited France where he met Louis Vierne, the blind organist at Notre-Dame in Paris. Upon his return to Boston, Skinner made his first pedal trombone stop modeled after the work of Willis for the 1900 Hutchings organ at Boston Music Hall. The first documented instance of the Pitman windchest, as developed by Skinner, appeared in the 1899 Hutchings-Votey organ installed at the Flatbush Reformed Dutch Church in Brooklyn, New York, although some sources mention origins in Hutchings organs as early as 1893.

In 1901, Skinner decided to strike out on his own. In 1902, he entered into a partnership to form the Skinner &amp; Cole Company with another former Hutchings-Votey employee. By 1904 their partnership had dissolved, and Ernest M. Skinner &amp; Company purchased the Skinner and Cole assets.

===Organ development and design===
Skinner was one of the first organ builders to try establishing a systematic method for providing fixed dimensions in his organ consoles. Before this, each organ builder might have used different dimensions on their consoles, causing problems with users adapting to different layouts and positions of keyboards and pedalboards of different instruments, even those made by the same builder. Skinner worked to develop a set of universal distances between the various keyboards, determining the ideal placement of the pedal board at a specific distance from the Great Manual, as well as the placement of the various expression shoes and other mechanical devices. These advancements significantly contributed to the standard American Guild of Organists (AGO) Console Measurements in use in the United States since 1930.

Skinner consoles had fully adjustable combination pistons and combination actions decades before other American firms adopted similar devices. Access to pre-sets, used to store and recall combination controls on Skinner instruments, was located on numbered rows of buttons located between the keyboards.

Skinner is credited with the advancement of electro-pneumatic action, which controls the mechanical operation of the instruments. These huge (frequently several ton) and highly sophisticated devices were built of wood, leather, and metal organ parts. They used low-voltage DC and low-pressure pressurized air to control and direct the switching and control commands. These actions allowed the pipework of the instrument to be located in any part of a building, while the console could be located hundreds of feet away allowing a single organist to have control over every aspect of the instrument.

Skinner developed numerous automatic playing mechanisms which enabled unskilled individuals to operate a large pipe organ like a player piano. In 1915, Skinner filed a patent for an &quot;Automatic Musical Instrument,&quot; which was granted in 1916. The following year, 1917, Skinner completed a player organ dubbed, &quot;The Orchestrator.&quot; This was a lifelong interest of Skinner, and one which he frequently worked in secret. The Toledo Museum of Art contains a fully restored Skinner instrument that uses a Skinner player action, Opus 603. 

The first of Skinner&#x27;s new stops, the &quot;Erzähler&quot;, appeared in 1904, and was soon joined by other tonal colors which Skinner worked on between 1908 and 1924, including flügelhorn and heckelphone stops. In addition to his orchestral color reeds, Skinner developed numerous string and hybrid flue stops, many with matching celestes. Among these were the &quot;Salicional/Voix Celeste&quot; and &quot;Dulciana/Unda Maris&quot; present in the Swell and Choir divisions of many American organs of the era, as well as his &quot;Flauto Dolce/Flute Celeste&quot;, his &quot;Dulcet&quot; (a pair of very narrow scaled string ranks tuned with a fast beat to heighten the intensity), a pair of inverted-flare gambas found in the solo divisions of many of his larger organs that allowed a rich, cello-like timbre for solo lines in the tenor range, the &quot;Kleine Erzähler&quot;, a softer, brighter version of his earlier &quot;Erzähler&quot; (which mimics the effect of string players playing very softly), as well as &quot;Pedal Violone&quot; stops at 32&#x27; and 16&#x27; pitches, which he defined as &quot;subtle, soft string stops&quot;. Skinner is known for his imitative French horn stop, which is the only one of his sonic creations that he patented.

His earliest designs built in his workshop in South Boston were for George Foster Peabody and for the Great Hall of City College in New York.

Ernest M. Skinner &amp; Company built large organs for Old South Church in Boston, Cathedral of St. John the Divine (op. 150, 1906); Saint Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Evanston, Illinois (op. 327, 1922); Sage Chapel at Cornell University (op. 175, 1909); Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh (op. 180, 1910); Appleton Chapel, Harvard (op. 197, 1912); Saint Thomas Episcopal Church, New York (op. 205, 1913); Finney Chapel, Oberlin College (op. 230, 1914), Kirkpatrick Chapel at Rutgers College (Op. 255, 1916), and the Brick Presbyterian Church, New York (op. 280, 1917).

In 1919, Ernest M. Skinner &amp; Company was reorganized with Arthur H. Marks (the former general manager and vice-president of the Goodrich Rubber Company) as the president and Skinner as vice-president of the newly organized Skinner Organ Company. This allowed Skinner to focus on technical and artistic aspects, while others managed the commercial aspects of the company. In 1924, at the behest of Marks and William Zeuch, another principal at the factory, Skinner made his second trip to England, this time meeting with Henry Willis III, the grandson of Henry Willis, and spending time in France with Marcel Dupré learning about mutation stops and chorus work of the French Romantic organ.

===Declining success and sale of the Skinner Organ Company===
The Skinner Organ Company built hundreds of pipe organs for customers all across the United States. The relationship between Skinner and the business managers of his company was rarely good, but by 1927 friction had built between Marks and Skinner. At the suggestion of English organ builder Henry Willis III, George Donald Harrison joined the Skinner staff as assistant general manager in 1927. Initially, Skinner viewed this arrangement positively, and collaborations between Skinner and Harrison resulted in four Landmark Organs in the late 1920s. The first was built in 1928 for the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, then two additional large organs, one for the Chapel at Princeton University, then another for Rockefeller Memorial Chapel at the University of Chicago. The final instrument was the rebuilding and expansion of the Newberry Memorial Organ, which is located in Woolsey Hall at Yale University. The Woolsey Hall organ is the largest instrument to bear the Skinner nameplate and remains virtually unaltered. It is widely considered to be one of the finest &quot;symphonic organs&quot; in the world.

With the onset of the Great Depression and coincident improvements in the recording and playback of electronically amplified music in larger public spaces, orders for pipe organs fell. The Skinner Company was forced to lay off workers and scale back production. The world of organ music and performance in the early 1930s had also begun to change. The orchestral style of instrument, which was the Skinner Company&#x27;s specialty, had been falling from favor among younger organists; many of them were looking for a more classical organ sound. Harrison, who had been working on the development of this new tonal direction for the company, was becoming more frequently requested as the designer and finisher of the limited number of available projects, while Skinner found himself being requested less. Many organists did maintain personal loyalty to Skinner and insisted on his involvement.

The 1932 merger of the Aeolian Organ Company with the Skinner Company and the resulting change of the company name to Aeolian-Skinner, resulted in increasing tension between Skinner, Harrison, and Marks, as Skinner saw his technical and artistic influence diminishing with the ascension of Harrison.

On July 14, 1933, Skinner was formally stripped of his titles and authority within the company by the Board of Directors of the Aeolian-Skinner Company, following his attempts to circumvent Harrison and influence the terms of the contract for the organ at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco.

The final instrument, which was personally designed and finished by Skinner, though built by the Aeolian-Skinner factory, is the large organ at the Chapel of Girard College in Philadelphia (Opus 872 - 1933). It is installed in a spacious and highly resonant dedicated chamber, located above the ceiling, and above the floor of the 2,000+ seat chapel. Speaking down through a large ceiling grill and into the resonant acoustics of the chapel, even the softest voices of the instrument are heard throughout the room.

As pressure increased within the Aeolian-Skinner Company, Skinner began to plan the formation of a new organ company with his son, Richmond Hastings Skinner, which he planned to call the Ernest M. Skinner and Son Organ Company, to compete with the Aeolian-Skinner Company. Marks was able to persuade Skinner (with the help of Skinner&#x27;s wife Mabel and his son Richmond) to instead enter into a five-year contract with the Skinner Organ Company that provided Skinner with an annual salary of $5,000 in exchange for the continued use of his name, but required that Mr. Skinner and his newly purchased interest in the Methuen Organ Company would not compete with Aeolian-Skinner in the construction of new organs, but rather &quot;confine his work...&quot; in the Methuen shop &quot;...to the rebuilding of older pipe organs&quot;.

In January 1936, Skinner sold his interest in the Skinner Organ Company to purchase the property now known as Methuen Memorial Music Hall in Methuen, Massachusetts, including the adjacent organ factory. Both had been built by Edward Francis Searles to house and maintain the very large organ which was originally built for the Boston Music Hall in 1863. In the following years, Skinner presented public performances of both choral and organ works with featured performers including Marcel Dupré and E. Power Biggs.

===Later years===
In 1936, Skinner, and his son Richmond Hastings Skinner, were awarded the contract for what would be his final instrument, for the Washington National Cathedral. The instrument was dedicated in the fall of 1938, to wide national acclaim.

World War II and the resulting materials shortages and related financial troubles forced the company to file for bankruptcy on October 1, 1941. The Methuen Organ Shop burned to the ground on June 17, 1943; the adjacent Music Hall and its organ were saved.

In January 1947, Skinner joined the Schantz Organ Company in Orrville, Ohio.

In 1949, then in his eighties and almost completely deaf, Skinner retired from organ building completely. Afterward, he began writing the book &quot;The Composition of the Organ&quot;, which was unfinished by his death, but completed and published by his son in 1980.

Skinner was always a prolific writer, with his letters penned to the editors of &quot;The Diapason&quot; and &quot;The American Organist&quot; appearing in those publications from the 1940s onward, wherein he worked to defend his tonal ideals and attempted to regain lost territory on the American musical landscape. As early as the mid-1930s, Skinner saw many of his instruments rebuilt or modified beyond recognition, while others were simply removed and thrown out wholesale, in the name of &quot;musical progress.&quot; Even three of the &quot;Landmark Organs&quot; mentioned in the previous section were subject to this trend, with modifications to the University of Chicago organ being carried out only a few years after its completion.

Not every organist felt obliged to follow the dictates of the &quot;organ reform movement&quot; and any discussion of Skinner would be incomplete without mentioning his extensive, informative, and influential writings on the organ and its music, published in books and national journals over most of his career.

Following the death of his wife Mabel in 1951, Skinner entered a downward spiral from which he never recovered. The tonal revision of his earlier organs at St. John the Divine (op. 150, 1911), St. Thomas (op. 205, 1913), and his final large organ built for the Washington National Cathedral all were subject to this trend by the mid-1950s, further complicating his emotional state as he saw his life&#x27;s work and ideals gradually becoming extinct. In recent decades, however, there has been a resurgence of interest in restoring Skinner&#x27;s instruments to their original condition. In many cases in which Skinner pipework was replaced with more generic or baroque sounds, the original pipework was preserved in storage, thus making it easier for the eventual rebuilding and restoration of his instruments to their original tonal designs and sound.

In 1956, he was living in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The final years of Skinner&#x27;s life saw him living in relative obscurity in California.

Skinner died during the night of November 26–27, 1960, at the age of 94, at the family home. He is buried in Bethel, Maine, in his wife&#x27;s family plot.

<text>St. Andrew&#x27;s Junior College (SAJC) is a junior college in Singapore, offering two-year pre-university courses leading up to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examination. It is an Anglican mission school, part of St. Andrew&#x27;s School. It is affiliated to schools under the Anglican Diocese of Singapore, as well as Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School and Presbyterian High School.

==History==
St. Andrew&#x27;s Junior College (SAJC) has its origins in St. Andrew&#x27;s School, which was founded in 1862 by the Anglican Diocese of Singapore. SAJC is an aided mission school which was started as a vision of faith when the Anglican Church took up the challenge of building a junior college in line with national educational developments in the 1970s. The Lutheran and Presbyterian Churches also joined in the building project. SAJC had its origins as pre-university classes began in 1969 as part of Saint Andrew&#x27;s Secondary School. In 1978, the college was formally established with its own campus at Telok Blangah, where it remained for 28 years.

At the former campus at Malan Road, the junior college had an air conditioned hall. Initially tutorial rooms were not air-conditioned. Indeed, some tutorial rooms only had 3 walls, with the fourth side fully opened to a common corridor linking the row of rooms. Later, tutorial rooms were air conditioned. As air conditioning in halls and tutorial rooms was not funded by the Ministry of Education in Singapore, it had to be paid for by funds raised by alumni and the college.

The college campus then had a bitumen track and bleachers at the opposite side to the main building. The campus also housed the old Chapel of the Resurrection, which has since relocated to St. Andrew&#x27;s Village.

It moved to Potong Pasir to form part of St Andrew&#x27;s Village on 15 December 2005. The campus is now located at the former Secondary School site at 5 Sorby Adams Drive, Singapore 357691 (previously as 55 Potong Pasir Avenue 1). St Andrew&#x27;s Village was officially opened by the then Minister for Education Tharman Shanmugaratnam on 26th Aug 2006. A sheltered pedestrian bridge, named Jacob Ballas Bridge, connects the college to the secondary and junior schools across the Kallang River.

==Principals==
== Affiliations ==
Saint Andrew&#x27;s Junior College is affiliated to the Anglican Diocese of Singapore, as well as all institutions affiliated to the Anglican Diocese of Singapore.

These institutions include Saint Andrew&#x27;s Junior School, Saint Andrew&#x27;s Secondary School, Anglican High School, Christ Church Secondary School, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School, Presbyterian High School, Saint Hilda&#x27;s Secondary School and Saint Margaret&#x27;s Secondary School.

The college is part of and affiliated to other organisations in The Saints&#x27; Family.

== Identity and Culture ==
Students at the college are called &quot;Saints&quot;.

=== Motto ===
All the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Schools shares the same motto, &quot;Up and On&quot;, as well as the school colours of blue and white.

=== Crest ===

The former crest of Saint Andrew&#x27;s Junior College distincted itself from that of SASS and SAJS. It bore the saltire and had &quot;SAJC&quot; in white letters on a red circle in the middle of the cross instead of the tiger head and crossed keys of the other schools. The crest was changed in 1993 to that of SASS to forge a united Saint Andrew&#x27;s identity.

=== Houses and Classes===
There are five houses in SAJC, whose names matches that of SAJS and SASS. They are Romanis, Gomes, Hose, LoyFatt, Venn, all named after founding members of St. Andrew&#x27;s School. Students in the Faculty of Arts belong to the house Romanis, while students in the Faculty of Science are split among the other houses. Classes, known as Civic Groups (CG) in the college, are named by the year the students came into the school, the faculty (A for Arts, S for Science) and a number. An example is &quot;16S04&quot; – meaning, the class started in 2016, is in the Faculty of Science and is the 4th class in the faculty.

=== Anthem ===
The College Anthem differs from that of SAJS and SASS. It is unique in that the key shifted from G-major to F-major midway and back to G-major at the end. Also, the words &#x27;Up Boys&#x27; is changed to &#x27;Up Saints&#x27;, as the college is co-ed. The music was written by J.J. de Souza and the lyrics by Pauline Koe. The College Hymn then was O God, Our Help in Ages Past. The anthem and hymn were changed in 1993 to that of SASS to forge a united Saint Andrew&#x27;s identity.

=== Uniform ===
Male students wear a white short-sleeved shirt and navy blue long pants, along with a navy blue tie with yellow and white stripes and bearing the school crest. Female students wear a white short-sleeved shirt and navy blue skirt of which the hemline should be no higher than 5 cm from the middle of the knee cap as well as the back of the knee.

The formal attire changes the white shirt or blouse to a long-sleeved one, and the pants or skirts to a white one. Students donning this uniform will wear black court shoes.

The PE attire consists of a white FBT-branded dry-fit shirt with the school crest sewn on the chest. The college divides students into 5 Houses – Venn (black), Loy Fatt (yellow), Hose (blue), Gomes (red) and Romanis (green). Students purchase a shirt with their house colours at the side torso area. The shirt follows the previous shirt designs with the word, &quot;SAINTS&quot;, printed on the back of the shirt. The previous shirt was cotton based and house colours were dyed on the sleeves of the shirts instead. The shorts are navy blue shorts with the college initials sewn at the bottom-right of the shorts. The school tie, which was worn by all students, was solid navy blue with one red and one white diagonal stripe across it toward the bottom.

===Christian Culture===
The school comes under the purview of Anglican Diocese of Singapore, believing that students do not enrol into the school by chance. This serving as a reminder to both students and staff alike that each Saint has a divine purpose and plan set by God. The school also has daily scripture readings and morning prayers conducted by teachers and students. There is also Chapel held fortnightly led by associates from the Chapel of the Resurrection. Once a year, the school also observes Passion Week, finishing off with Life Concert, a charismatic worship concert held on school grounds which also serves as an evangelical outreach to non-Christian students.

<text>Saint Andrew&#x27;s Secondary School is a government-aided Anglican all-boys&#x27; secondary school in Potong Pasir, Singapore. Established in the 19th century, it still operates along traditional British lines and offers a four- or five-year programme, leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level or Singapore-Cambridge GCE Normal Level examinations.

==History==
The school was founded in 1862 by Reverend Edward Sherman Venn. In May 1872, after the Colonial Chaplain, Canon J. A. Beccles, applied to the government for financial aid, Saint Andrew&#x27;s School became a grant-in-aid institution. The growing school moved from Upper Hokkien Street to Victoria Street and then in 1875 to a four-acre site along Stamford Road.

By the 1920s, the school&#x27;s enrolment had reached 800 boys. In the 1930s, a system of prefects was instituted, and the school became known for its excellence in boxing and rugby in this period.

A new, larger campus was opened in Woodsville in 1940. More buildings were added in the 1950s, housing both the primary school and secondary school sections.

In 1986, the secondary school moved from Woodsville to a site in Potong Pasir across the Kallang River after the Woodsville buildings were deemed inadequate for the running of both the primary and secondary classes. In mid-2003, the school moved temporarily to the old Victoria School building at Kallang Bahru before returning to new buildings opposite Saint Andrew&#x27;s Junior School in 2005 as part of the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Village project, which brings together in one complex the Junior, Secondary and Junior College campuses.

Meanwhile, the old school buildings have been conserved and strengthened for re-use as a church, winning an Honourable Mention in the UNESCO Heritage Awards in 2007.

The Saint Andrew&#x27;s Village has the first artificial rugby pitch in Singapore, shared between the secondary school and the primary school. It opened in January 2008 at a cost of S$1 million and provides an all-weather surface.

==Academics==
In 2008, Saint Andrew&#x27;s was one of eight schools in Singapore to begin offering three new subjects at the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level: Creative 3D Animation, Fundamentals of Electronics, and Introduction to Enterprise Development.

In 2009, Saint Andrew&#x27;s gained an Academic Value-Added Sustained Achievement Award from the Ministry of Education.

In 2010, the school was commended for including the Saint Andrew&#x27;s River Programme in its science curriculum. Students investigated the impact on the Kallang River ecosystem and water quality of the building of the Marina Barrage and the enclosure of the Marina Basin.

From 2011, Saint Andrew&#x27;s offers enhanced enrichment courses for upper secondary students taking the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examinations in art.

In 2011, the school won the Special Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovations in Normal Course.

==Sporting achievements==
Saint Andrew&#x27;s is one of the traditional &quot;Big Three&quot; rugby schools in Singapore, along with Raffles Institution and Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). The school has won a total of 157 national school titles for rugby since the late 1960s (based on available records). It has also held the Kiwi Cup from 1945 to 2013 inclusive. It has been awarded niche status in rugby by the Ministry of Education.

The school is also strong in hockey. The B Division Hockey Team emerged champions of the B Division Competitions in 2005, 2008 and 2018, as well as the C Division Hockey Team who emerged champions in 2010, 2012 and a recent win over Raffles Institution gave them another national title in 2014. The B Division Hockey Team also recently emerge as champions in the 2016 B Division Hockey Competitions after edging their opponents, Sengkang Secondary, in the finals with a score of 2-0. In cricket, Saint Andrew&#x27;s was under-17 champions in 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2003.

==School culture==
Despite being an Anglican school, it is not a requirement for students to be Christian. Saint Andrew&#x27;s has a house system comprising five houses: Gomes, Hose, Loyfatt, Romanis and Venn. The school regards its system of prefects as an important element in maintaining an ethos of service and high standards of conduct.

===School uniform===
All students wear white short-sleeved shirts bearing the school badge. Lower secondary boys (Secondary 1 and 2) wear dark blue short trousers with white socks; Bermuda shorts are not permitted. Upper secondary boys (Secondary 3 onwards) wear dark blue long pants, although Secondary 3 students have been allowed to do so only since the 1990s. The prefects in upper secondary wear white long pants. 

===Discipline===
Saint Andrew&#x27;s maintains strict rules for behaviour inside and outside the school. There is a new system of demerit points, used in combination with the school&#x27;s long-standing policy of corporal punishment in the form of caning on the palm of the hand or on the buttocks over clothing. 

After a series of bullying cases attracted attention in 2003, the school stated that the situation at Saint Andrew&#x27;s was no worse than at any other school, adding that bullies receive a stern warning; recalcitrant offenders or those who injure others are caned and ultimately expelled. A Saint Andrew&#x27;s student caught bringing pornography to school would be caned either in public or in class, depending on the seriousness of the case.

For cases where the offence has a victim or where there is conflict to be resolved, a system of Restorative Practices is in place. &quot;In the process of resolving the conflict, the offenders are asked to suggest the appropriate consequences for their action, which may include any form of punishment. However, any students who fail to cooperate with the teacher will be dealt with differently.&quot;

After high school, she moved to Las Vegas for four years, earning her Bachelor of Arts degree in Communication Studies (1993) from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, with an emphasis on Public Relations and a minor in Sociology.

Since the age of twelve, McRandle&#x27;s modeling career included photography shoots, runways, and character modeling. In Las Vegas, she worked as a promotional model at the Las Vegas Convention Center, Bally&#x27;s Mirage, MGM, and in the Roman Festival at Caesar&#x27;s Palace. She also worked as a make-up artist in the Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach areas.

==Star Wars==
Prior to 1998, Mara Jade was a character that existed only as a subject of illustrations created by a variety of artists. These depictions were based solely on written descriptions of the character found within the Star Wars expanded universe novels.

A fan of the franchise, Shannon McRandle auditioned for the opportunity to represent Mara Jade&#x27;s image when Lucasfilm opted to use a photographic likeness as a model for the character. In 1999, McRandle was photographed for this purpose, known at the time as Shannon Baksa due to her marriage to her first husband in 1994. Lucasfilm subsequently utilized McRandle&#x27;s likeness for Mara Jade merchandise.

It is worth noting that the illustrations of Mara Jade&#x27;s character were influenced by McRandle&#x27;s physical appearance.

==Personal life==
Shannon Lynn married United States Navy veteran Jamie McRandle on September 18, 2002. They have three children. She and her family live in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

In 2013, Shannon McRandle was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis and Stage 3 Rectal Cancer. The cancer is in remission, but the radiation and chemo caused severe osteoporosis in her back and hips, and resulted in a severely-weakened immune system as well as several other medical issues. None of the AS treatments were successful.

<text>An inter frame is a frame in a video compression stream which is expressed in terms of one or more neighboring frames. The &quot;inter&quot; part of the term refers to the use of &quot;Inter frame prediction&quot;. This kind of prediction tries to take advantage from temporal redundancy between neighboring frames enabling higher compression rates.

==Inter frame prediction==
An inter coded frame is divided into blocks known as macroblocks. After that, instead of directly encoding the raw pixel values for each block, the encoder will try to find a block similar to the one it is encoding on a previously encoded frame, referred to as a reference frame. This process is done by a block matching algorithm. If the encoder succeeds on its search, the block could be encoded by a vector, known as motion vector, which points to the position of the matching block at the reference frame. The process of motion vector determination is called motion estimation.

In most cases the encoder will succeed, but the block found is likely not an exact match to the block it is encoding. This is why the encoder will compute the differences between them. Those residual values are known as the prediction error and need to be transformed and sent to the decoder.

To sum up, if the encoder succeeds in finding a matching block on a reference frame, it will obtain a motion vector pointing to the matched block and a prediction error. Using both elements, the decoder will be able to recover the raw pixels of the block. The following image shows the whole process graphically:

This kind of prediction has some pros and cons:
* If everything goes fine, the algorithm will be able to find a matching block with little prediction error so that, once transformed, the overall size of motion vector plus prediction error is lower than the size of a raw encoding.
* If the block matching algorithm fails to find a suitable match the prediction error will be considerable. Thus the overall size of motion vector plus prediction error will be greater than the raw encoding. In this case the encoder would make an exception and send a raw encoding for that specific block.
* If the matched block at the reference frame has also been encoded using Inter frame prediction, the errors made for its encoding will be propagated to the next block. If every frame was encoded using this technique, there would be no way for a decoder to synchronize to a video stream because it would be impossible to obtain the reference images.

Because of these drawbacks, a reliable and time periodic reference frame must be used for this technique to be efficient and useful. That reference frame is known as Intra-frame, which is strictly intra coded, so it can always be decoded without additional information.

In most designs, there are two types of inter frames: P-frames and B-frames. These two kinds of frames and the I-frames (Intra-coded pictures) usually join in a GOP (Group Of Pictures). The I-frame doesn&#x27;t need additional information to be decoded and it can be used as a reliable reference. This structure also allows to achieve an I-frame periodicity, which is needed for decoder synchronization.

==Frame types==
The difference between P-frames and B-frames is the reference frame they are allowed to use.

===P-frame===
P-frame is the term used to define the forward Predicted pictures. The prediction is made from an earlier picture, mainly an I-frame or P-frame, so that require less coding data (≈50% when compared to I-frame size).

The amount of data needed for doing this prediction consist of motion vectors and transform coefficients describing prediction correction. It involves the use of motion compensation.

===B-frame===
B-frame is the term for bidirectionally predicted pictures. This kind of prediction method occupies less coding data than P-frames generally (≈25% when compared to I-frame size) because the prediction is made from either an earlier frame or a later frame or both them. (B-frames can also be less efficient than P-frames under certain cases, e.g.: lossless encoding.)

Similar to P-frames, B-frames are expressed as motion vectors and transform coefficients.
In order to avoid a growing propagation error, B-frames are not used as a reference to make further predictions in most encoding standards. However, in newer encoding methods (such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and HEVC), B-frames may be used as reference for better exploitation of temporal redundancy.

==Typical Group Of Pictures (GOP) structure==

The typical Group of pictures (GOP) structure is IBBPBBP... The I-frame is used to predict the first P-frame and these two frames are also used to predict the first and the second B-frames. The second P-frame is predicted also using the first I-frame. Both P-frames join to predict the third and fourth B-frames. The scheme is shown in the next picture:

This structure suggests a problem because the fourth frame (a P-frame) is needed in order to predict the second and the third (B-frames). So we need to transmit the P-frame before the B-frames and it will delay the transmission (it will be necessary to keep the P-frame).

This structure has strong points:
* It minimizes the problem of possible uncovered areas.
* P-frames and B-frames need less data than I-frames, so less data is transmitted.

But it has weak points:
* It increases the complexity of the decoder, which can mean more memory needed to rearrange the frames, and a tiny bit more processing power.
* B-frames may introduce decoding dependency which inevitably increases decoding latency.

== H.264 inter frame prediction improvements ==
The most important improvements of the H.264 technique in regard to standards before it (especially MPEG-2) are:
*More flexible block partition
*Resolution of up to ¼ pixel motion compensation
*Multiple references
*Enhanced Direct/Skip Macroblock

=== More flexible block partition ===
Luminance block partition of 16×16 (MPEG-2), 16×8, 8×16, and 8×8. The last case allows the division of the block into new blocks of 4×8, 8×4, or 4×4.

The frame to be coded is divided into blocks of equal size as shown in the picture above. Each block prediction will be blocks of the same size as the reference pictures, offset by a small displacement.

=== Resolution of up to ¼ pixel motion compensation ===
Pixels at half-pixel position are obtained by applying a filter of length 6.

 H=[1 -5 20 20 -5 1], i.e.
 half-pixel &quot;b&quot;=A - 5B + 20C + 20D - 5E + F

Pixels at quarter-pixel position are obtained by bilinear interpolation.

While MPEG-2 allowed a ½ pixel resolution, Inter frame allows up to ¼ pixel resolution. That means that it is possible to search a block in the frame to be coded in other reference frames, or we can interpolate nonexistent pixels to find blocks that are even better suited to the current block. If motion vector is an integer number of units of samples, that means it is possible to find in reference pictures the compensated block in motion. If motion vector is not an integer, the prediction will be obtained from interpolated pixels by an interpolator filter to horizontal and vertical directions.

=== Multiple references ===
Multiple references to motion estimation allows finding the best reference in 2 possible buffers (List 0 to past pictures, List 1 to future pictures) which contain up to 16 frames in total. Block prediction is done by a weighted sum of blocks from the reference picture. It allows enhanced picture quality in scenes where there are changes of plane, zoom, or when new objects are revealed.

=== Enhanced Direct/Skip Macroblock ===
Skip and Direct Mode are very frequently used, especially with B-frames. They significantly reduce the number of bits to be coded. These modes are referred to when a block is coded without sending residual error or motion vectors. The encoder will only record that it is a Skip Macroblock. The decoder will deduce the motion vector of Direct/Skip Mode coded block from other blocks already decoded.

There are two ways to deduce the motion:

; Temporal: It uses the block motion vector from List 1 frame, located at the same position to deduce the motion vector. List 1 block uses a List 0 block as reference.
; Spatial: It predicts the movement from neighbour macroblocks in same frame. A possible criterion could be to copy the motion vector from a neighboring block. These modes are used in uniform zones of the picture where there is not much movement.

In the figure above, pink blocks are Direct/Skip Mode coded blocks. As we can see, they are used very frequently, mainly in B-frames.

==Additional information==
Although the use of the term &quot;frame&quot; is common in informal usage, in many cases (such as in international standards for video coding by MPEG and VCEG) a more general concept is applied by using the word &quot;picture&quot; rather than &quot;frame&quot;, where a picture can either be a complete frame or a single interlaced field.

Video codecs such as MPEG-2, H.264 or Ogg Theora reduce the amount of data in a stream by following key frames with one or more inter frames. These frames can typically be encoded using a lower bit rate than is needed for key frames because much of the image is ordinarily similar, so only the changing parts need to be coded.

<text>Dilip Shanghvi (born 1 October 1955) is an Indian billionaire businessman. Shanghvi is the founder of Sun Pharmaceuticals, a pharmaceutical company. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honor of the Padma Shri in 2016. &quot;India Today&quot; magazine ranked him 8th in India&#x27;s most powerful people of 2017 list. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, as of March 2024, Shanghvi is the 6th richest person in India with an estimated net worth of US$25.7 billion.

== Early life ==
Shanghvi, often confused as a Jain, originally belongs to a Gujarati Hindu Vaishnav Kapol Vania family settled in Kolkata. He was born in the small town of Amreli in the Indian state of Gujarat, the son of Shantilal Shanghvi and his wife Kumud Shanghvi. Shanghvi earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Calcutta. He spent his childhood and college life with his parents in the Burrabazar locality of Kolkata. He is an alumnus of J. J. Ajmera High School and Bhawanipur Education Society College, where he did his schooling and graduation, respectively.

== Career ==
Shanghvi started by helping his father in his business, which was a wholesale dealership of medicines, mainly generic drugs, in Kolkata. It was during this work that he thought of manufacturing his own drugs instead of selling products made by others.

In 1982, the 27-year-old Shanghvi finally opened his first manufacturing unit with a capital of INR 10,000. He named his venture Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. The unit, located in Vapi in his native state of Gujarat, a short drive away from Mumbai, produced exactly one psychiatry drug. However, the business soon picked up, thanks to Shanghvi&#x27;s acumen and energy, and by 1997, Sun Pharma was even able to acquire Caraco Pharma, an American company. Sun also acquired Israel&#x27;s Taro Pharma in 2007. Shanghvi stepped down as chairman and CEO in 2012 and chose Israel Makov, formerly CEO of Teva Pharmaceuticals, as his successor; Shanghvi became managing director. In April 2014 Sun, Ranbaxy, and Daiichi Sankyo (the majority shareholder in Ranbaxy) agreed that Sun would acquire all outstanding shares of Ranbaxy for $3.2 billion in Sun stock and that Sun would take on $800M in Ranbaxy debt; the deal closed in March 2015 and made Sun the largest drug company in India and fifth largest in the world, and made Daiichi the second-largest shareholder in Sun. In May 2021 he stepped down from the position of Managing director of SPARC and will continue to function as a non-executive director and chairman.

== Community ==
In January 2018, the Indian government appointed Shanghvi to the Reserve Bank of India&#x27;s 21-member central board committee. He is chairman of the board of governors at IIT Bombay. He was made a trustee of the Rhodes scholarship programme at Oxford University in 2017.

==Personal life==
He is married to Vibha Shanghvi. They have a son, Aalok and a daughter, Vidhi, both of whom work for Sun Pharmaceuticals.

Shanghvi is a devotee of Shrinathji and makes regular pilgrimage with his family to the deity&#x27;s abode in the city of Nathdwara in Rajasthan. Photos and idols of the deity adore Sun Pharma&#x27;s factory and offices.

== Book ==
In 2019, journalist Soma Das authored &quot;The Reluctant Billionaire&quot;, the first and only biography of Dilip Shanghvi. Published by Penguin Random House, the book was nominated for Tata Literature Award in the Best Business Book category in November 2019.

<doc id="1258691" wikidata="Q509691" url="?curid=1258691" title="Frank Gray">
<text>Francis Tierney Gray (born 27 October 1954) is a Scottish football manager and former player. He played for Leeds United, Nottingham Forest, Sunderland and Darlington, while he also represented Scotland 32 times. He managed Darlington, Farnborough Town, Grays Athletic, Woking, Basingstoke Town and Bashley.

== Club career ==
=== Leeds United ===
Gray was born in Glasgow and brought up in the city&#x27;s Castlemilk district. He was one of the new generation of Leeds United players of the mid-1970s charged with the task of maintaining the club&#x27;s success after the Don Revie era.

Gray, younger brother of Eddie, joined the club under Revie as a 17-year-old left-winger and made his debut in 1973, scoring a goal in his first start. Revie had lost regular left back Terry Cooper to a broken leg the year before and needed to find replacements, and Gray was given his chance as a left-back as a result.

He did not stay in the side, with a reshuffled defence allowing Trevor Cherry to take the left back spot for the end of the season which consisted of two cup finals (the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners Cup) both of which Leeds lost. Revie did invite Gray to travel with the squad to Wembley and he sat next to his manager during the defeat to Sunderland.

Gray was similarly spared regular football in the first team at such an early age the following year, with Cherry settled into the left back role. Leeds won the League championship thanks to an unbeaten start to the season of 29 games. Gray played only six times and did not qualify for a medal.

The following season, he made 18 appearances in the League and usurped Cherry for the No. 3 shirt in the European Cup final in Paris, which Leeds lost 2–0 to Bayern Munich. As the Revie team disbanded due to age – Revie himself had quit for the England manager&#x27;s job the year before – Gray found himself tagged as one of the bright young things who would maintain the work of the previous team, alongside Gordon McQueen and Joe Jordan.

=== Nottingham Forest ===
In 1979, Gray joined Nottingham Forest for £500,000. Forest were managed by Brian Clough, who had previously managed Gray at Leeds.

Gray slotted into the team and played in his second European Cup final in 1980, making him the first player to appear in the final for two different English clubs. This time he was successful as Forest won 1–0 against a Hamburg SV side which included Kevin Keegan. Gray also finished on the losing side earlier in the season when Forest were beaten in the League Cup final by Wolves, thanks to a single goal from unrelated fellow Scotsman Andy Gray.

=== Return to Elland Road ===
Despite his success with Forest, in 1981 Gray returned to Leeds, accepting an invitation from manager – and former teammate – Allan Clarke. It was a £300,000 deal which took Gray back to Elland Road, but in the first season of his return Leeds were relegated.

Clarke was sacked by Leeds after relegation and Gray&#x27;s brother Eddie took over. The younger Gray played for four years under his brother&#x27;s stewardship but Leeds could not gain promotion and Gray left for Sunderland in 1985. His tally for Leeds stood up at 396 appearances and 35 goals.

== International career ==
Gray made his debut for Scotland in a 1–0 win over Switzerland in 1976, and won more caps in late 1978, having missed out on a place in the squad for that summer&#x27;s World Cup in Argentina.

Gray was selected for Scotland&#x27;s World Cup squad for the 1982 tournament in Spain, and he played in all three of the group games against New Zealand, Brazil and the USSR, though Scotland did not progress further.

His international career ended in 1983 after 32 appearances and one goal.

== Management career ==
During his second spell at Leeds, Gray coached Collingham Under 16s. After his second stint at Leeds, he helped Sunderland gain promotion from Division Three, then helped Darlington into the Football League as assistant to Brian Little in the 1990s and took Farnborough Town to the Nationwide Conference South play-offs in 2005–06. He moved to Grays Athletic with assistant Gerry Murphy to replace Mark Stimson, but his stay was short. He was brought to Woking by football technical director Colin Lippiatt in May 2007 with the aim of taking the club into the Football League.

Gray was appointed manager at Woking on 3 May 2007 on a two-year deal, replacing Glenn Cockerill. He departed by mutual consent on 8 April 2008.

He was appointed manager of Basingstoke Town in the Conference South, but he left the club through mutual consent, and was succeeded by academy manager Jason Bristow on a temporary contract until the end of the season.

Gray was appointed on 31 May 2012 as manager at Evostik Premier Division South club side Bashley. On 19 June 2013 Gray and his sideman Murphy stepped down and were replaced by former Bashley players Paul Gazzard and Stewart Kearn.

== Post-management career ==
Gray lives in Australia where he works as a pundit for Fox Sports Australia&#x27;s Premier League coverage. In 2016, Gray worked in an advisory capacity for Manly United where he oversaw the Manly United junior programme and worked with women&#x27;s teams across all grades.

== Family football links ==
His son Andy Gray, a striker, came through the ranks at Leeds and later played for Nottingham Forest, Bury, Preston, Oldham Athletic, Bradford City, Sheffield United, Sunderland, Burnley, Charlton Athletic and Barnsley. He also won two full international caps for Scotland.

His nephew Stuart represented Celtic and Reading as a full-back.

His grandson, Archie Gray, son of Andy, is a midfielder for Tottenham Hotspur and England under 21s.

<doc id="1258696" wikidata="Q7311965" url="?curid=1258696" title="Remixed (Sarah McLachlan album)">
<text>Remixed is the first remix album by Canadian singer Sarah McLachlan, released in Canada on 4 July 2001 by Nettwerk and in the United States on 16 December 2003 by Arista Records. It includes various dance club versions of McLachlan&#x27;s songs, remixed by DJs such as William Orbit, Tiësto, BT, and Rabbit in the Moon.

==Content==
&quot;Remixed&quot; features mostly new remixes of songs which originally appeared on McLachlan&#x27;s studio albums: &quot;Solace&quot; (1991), &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; (1993) and &quot;Surfacing&quot; (1997). Three tracks were previously released on club compilations or 12&quot; promotional singles: &quot;Possession&quot; (Rabbit in the Moon Mix) in 1995, &quot;I Love You&quot; (BT Mix) in 2000 and &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; (DJ Tiësto Mix) in 2000. &quot;Remixed&quot; also features &quot;Silence&quot; by Delerium and McLachlan, which became one of the greatest trance songs of all time. Here, it was remixed by Tiësto. The remix album was overseen and produced by George Maniatis. 

In early 2002, the edit of &quot;Angel&quot; (Dusted Remix) was released on the &quot;Angel&quot; single in the United Kingdom. Later in 2002, the edit of &quot;Fear&quot; (Hybrid&#x27;s Super Collider Mix) was included on the &quot;Roswell&quot; soundtrack. Also in 2002, the edit of &quot;Plenty&quot; (Fade Mix) appeared on the second &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; soundtrack.

==Commercial performance==
In Canada, the album peaked at number ten in 2001. It was also certified platinum. In the United States, it was released in December 2003 and entered the Dance/Electronic Albums at number one. It stayed on top for four consecutive weeks. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;Remixed&quot; reached number 200. As of January 2005, the album has sold 162,000 copies in the United States.

Several remixes charted over the years on the US Dance Club Songs: &quot;Possession&quot; in 1995 (peak at number thirty), &quot;I Love You&quot; in 2000 (peak at number twenty-three), &quot;Silence&quot; in 2000 (peak at number six) and &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; in 2001 (also peak at number six). In 2004, &quot;Silence 2004&quot; entered the Dance Club Songs and peaked at number one, becoming McLachlan&#x27;s first chart-topper there.

<doc id="1258707" wikidata="Q83960" url="?curid=1258707" title="Solomon Luria">
<text>Shlomo Luria (1510 – November 7, 1573) () was one of the great Ashkenazic &quot;poskim&quot; (decisors of Jewish law) and teachers of his time. He is known for his work of Halakha, &quot;Yam Shel Shlomo&quot;, and his Talmudic commentary &quot;Chochmat Shlomo&quot;. Luria is also referred to as &quot;&quot;Maharshal&quot; (Hebrew abbreviation: Our Teacher, Rabbi Solomon Luria), or &quot;Rashal&quot;&quot; (Hebrew abbreviation: Rabbi Solomon Luria).

==Biography==

Luria was born in the city of Poznań (Posen), in the Kingdom of Poland. His father, Yechiel Luria, was the rabbi of the Lithuanian city of Slutzk and the son of the eminent Talmudist Miriam Luria. The Luria family claims descent from Rashi. Luria studied in Lublin under Rabbi Shalom Shachna, and later in the Ostroh yeshiva under Kalonymus Haberkasten; he later married Lipka, daughter of Rabbi Kalonymus. Students in the yeshiva included Joshua Falk. The Maharshal served as Rabbi in Brisk and various Lithuanian communities for 15 years.

Around 1550, he had several correspondences with Rabbi Moses Isserles (Rema). Rabbi Isserles represented the moderated use of philosophy in Jewish studies while Luria was more critical of this approach. He believed that Isserles contradicted the Geonim in his arguments. Despite debating Isserles&#x27; method, Luria was friendly in his replies.

When Haberkasten assumed the position of rosh yeshiva in Brisk, Luria replaced him as the official rabbi of the city and region of Ostroh. Luria later succeeded Shalom Shachna as head of the Lublin Yeshiva, which attracted students from all over Europe. Due to various internal problems in the yeshiva, he opened his own yeshiva. The building, known as the &quot;Maharshal&#x27;s shul&quot;, remained intact until World War II.

==Works==
Yam Shel Shlomo, Luria&#x27;s major work of Halakha, was written on sixteen tractates of the Talmud; however, it is extant on only seven. In it, Maharshal analyzes key &quot;sugyot&quot; (passages) and decides between various authorities as to the practical halacha. Maharshal, famously, objected to Isserles&#x27;s method of presenting halakhic rulings without discussing their derivation. He wrote &quot;Yam Shel Shlomo&quot; to &quot;probe the depths of the halacha&quot; and to clarify the process by which those halachot are reached.

Chochmat Shlomo is a gloss, and comments, on the text of the Talmud. One aim of this work being to establish the correct text. To achieve this Maharshal scrutinized the published editions of the Talmud as well as the commentaries of Rashi, Tosafot, and other Rishonim. His comments were later published by his son; an abridged version of &quot;Chochmat Shlomo&quot; appears in nearly all editions of the Talmud today, at the end of each tractate. The original, separately printed version, is far more extensive, and has now been re-published in the Metivta/Oz ve-Hadar edition of the Talmud. The Chida writes that &quot;I&#x27;ve heard from elders, that the Maharshal is extremely deep; and most &quot;hasagot&quot; (criticisms/objections) from the Maharsha on the Maharshal, aren&#x27;t &quot;hasagot&quot; if the reader will delve deep into the subject&quot;.

Maharshal also wrote:
*&quot;Yeri&#x27;ot Shlomo&quot;, a super-commentary on Rashi&#x27;s commentary on the Torah (in fact a commentary on Elijah Mizrachi&#x27;s supercommentary on Rashi) - HebrewBooks.org;
*&quot;Amudei Shlomo&quot;, a commentary on &quot;Sefer Mitzvot Gadol&quot; (&quot;SeMag&quot;) of Rabbi Moses ben Jacob of Coucy;
*A collection of Responsa; see History of Responsa: Sixteenth century.

<doc id="1258709" wikidata="Q2074410" url="?curid=1258709" title="Peter Cook (Australian politician)">
<text>Peter Francis Salmon Cook (8 November 19433 December 2005) was an Australian politician. He served as a Labor member of the Senate from 1983 to 2005, representing the state of Western Australia.

==Career==

Cook was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and was an active trade unionist before entering politics. He was Secretary of the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council 1975–83 and vice-president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions 1981–83. He was also a member of the Labor Party&#x27;s National Executive.

He was elected to the Senate at the 1983 election; as this was a double dissolution election, his service commenced on election day, 5 March 1983 (although for the purpose of determining the rotation of senators it was taken to have commenced on the previous 1 July).

In the Hawke and Keating Labor governments he was Minister for Resources 1988–1990, Minister for Industrial Relations 1990–1993, Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support 1992–93, Minister for Trade 1993–1994 and Minister for Industry, Science and Technology 1994–96.

After the defeat of the Keating government in 1996, Cook was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1996–2001 and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. In 1997–2001, he chaired a Senate Committee inquiry into the proposed Goods and Services Tax.

He was defeated by union organiser Glenn Sterle in a Labor preselection ballot before the 2004 election, and subsequently did not contest the election. His term expired on 30 June 2005. An avid ally of Julia Gillard, Cook publicly backed her for the Labor leadership after Mark Latham resigned in 2005.

==Death==
Cook died on 3 December 2005 after being diagnosed with melanoma in July 2004. The last Senate report to which he contributed was &quot;The cancer journey: Informing choice&quot;, handed down on 23 June 2005.

<text>The Northrop X-21A was an experimental aircraft designed to test wings with laminar flow control. It was based on the Douglas WB-66D airframe, with the wing-mounted engines moved to the rear fuselage and making space for air compressors. The aircraft first flew on 18 April 1963 with NASA test pilot Jack Wells at the controls. Although useful testing was accomplished, the extensive maintenance requirements of the intricate laminar-flow system caused the end of the program.

==Design and development==
Laminar-flow control is a technology that offers the potential for significant improvement in drag coefficient which would provide improvements in aircraft fuel usage, range or endurance that far exceed any known single aeronautical technology. In principle, if 80% of wing is laminar, then overall drag could be reduced by 25%. The frictional force between the air and the aircraft surface, known as viscous drag, is much larger in a turbulent boundary layer than in a laminar one. The principal type of active laminar-flow control is removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations (boundary layer suction).

Two major modifications were required, the first involving the standard underwing podded Allison J71 engines being removed and replaced by a pair of static thrust General Electric XJ79-GE-13 non-afterburning turbojets mounted in pods attached to the rear of the fuselage sides. Bleed air from the J79 engines was fed into a pair of underwing fairings, each of which housed a &quot;bleed-burn&quot; turbine which sucked the boundary layer air out through the wing slots.

The X-21A test vehicles (&quot;55-0408&quot; and &quot;55-0410&quot;) also incorporated sophisticated laminar flow control systems built into a completely new wing of increased span and area, with a sweep reduced from 35° to 30°. The wing had a multiple series of span-wise slots (800,000 in total) through which turbulent boundary-layer was &quot;sucked in,&quot; resulting in a smoother laminar flow. Theoretically, reduced drag, better fuel economy and longer range could be achieved.

The forward cockpit carried a pilot and two flight engineers while two additional flight test engineers were housed in a central fuselage bay underneath the wing.

==Testing==

In initial testing there were significant problems with the porous materials and surface slots getting plugged with debris, bugs, and even rain. In certain conditions, ice crystals would form due to the rapid cooling of air over the laminar surfaces. This would abruptly disrupt laminar flow, causing rapid melting and rapid transition back to turbulent flow. Maximum achievement of 95% laminar flow over those areas was desired. However, the design effort was canceled due to the plugging problems.

Pioneering data were obtained in the X-21 flight program, including the effects of surface irregularities, boundary-layer turbulence induced by three-dimensional span-wise flow effects in the boundary layer (referred to as span-wise contamination) and degrading environmental effects such as ice crystals in the atmosphere.

==Disposition==
Both X-21As ended up in storage at Edwards Air Force Base, California, where they gradually became derelicts, used primarily as photo targets. The remains can still be viewed, but no efforts have been made to recover either example for restoration or display.

<text>Binyamin &quot;Fuad&quot; Ben-Eliezer (; ; 12 February 1936 – 28 August 2016) was an Iraqi-born Israeli politician and general. He served as a member of the Knesset between 1984 and 2014, and held several ministerial posts, including Minister of Industry, Trade and Labour; Minister of Defense; and Deputy Prime Minister. He served as leader of the Israeli Labor Party between 2001 and 2002.

==Biography==
Ben-Eliezer was born in Basra in southern Iraq to an Iraqi-Jewish family, the son of Saleh and Farha Elazar. His name at birth was Fuad Elazar. He immigrated to Israel in 1950, where his name was Hebraized to Binyamin Ben-Eliezer. He was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces in 1954 and became a career soldier.

He lived in Rishon LeZion and was married with five children. Some of his granddaughters live in the United States. He was fluent in Hebrew, Arabic and English.

==Military career==
Ben-Eliezer was drafted into the IDF in 1954 and served in the Golani Brigade. He served in the Brigade as a soldier and as a squad leader. In 1956 he became an infantry officer after completing Officer Candidate School and return to the Golani Brigade, and fought in the Sinai war. Ben-Eliezer served as a Commander of sayerert shaked in the Six-Day War and was wounded in the War of Attrition. In the Yom Kippur War he served as a brigade Executive officer. In 1977, he was appointed First Commanding Officer in Southern Lebanon, serving as the army liaison between the Lebanese Christian militias and Israel. He was Military Governor of the Israeli-occupied West Bank (1978–81) and was Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories from 1983 until 1984. He completed his military service with the rank of Brigadier General.

==Political career==
After retiring from the army, Ben-Eliezer was briefly a member of the Tami Party, a grouping of Israeli Jews of &quot;Mizrahi&quot; or Middle Eastern origin.
Ben-Eliezer was first elected to the Knesset in 1984 on the Yahad list, which merged into the Alignment during his first term. He was re-elected in 1988 and 1992, by which time the Alignment had become the Labor Party. In July 1992 he was appointed Minister of Housing and Construction in Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s government. He retained his seat in the 1996 elections, but lost his place in the cabinet as Labor went into opposition. Following Ehud Barak&#x27;s victory in the 1999 Prime Minister election, Ben-Eliezer returned to the cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Communications. From October 2000 to 3 March 2001, he also served as Minister of Housing and Construction. After Ariel Sharon&#x27;s victory in the special election for Prime Minister in 2001, Ben-Eliezer was appointed Minister of Defense in the national unity government, and served as Labor Party leader following Barak&#x27;s resignation until Amram Mitzna was elected in 2002. He left the post on 2 October 2002 when Labor withdrew from the coalition.

Re-elected again in 2003, Ben-Eliezer served as Minister of National Infrastructure from 10 January 2005 until 23 November, when Labor left the government. In the Labor Party leadership election on 9 November 2005, he came third with 16.8% of the vote, behind Amir Peretz and Shimon Peres. He retained his seat again in the 2006 elections, and was appointed Minister of National Infrastructure in Ehud Olmert&#x27;s government.

In March 2007, Ben-Eliezer was forced to cancel a trip to Egypt after being warned by Egyptian intelligence that he could be arrested, when Egyptian media and opposition implicated him in the &#x27;massacre&#x27; of 250 Egyptian POWs during the Six-Day War following an Israeli documentary. However, the allegations are disputed by both Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and the documentary film-maker Ran Edelist. Placed eighth on the party&#x27;s list, he was re-elected again in the 2009 elections and appointed Minister of Industry, Trade and Labour. He resigned from the cabinet after Ehud Barak left the Labor Party to establish Independence in January 2011.

He contracted pneumonia in March 2011 and was put into a medically induced coma, eventually making a full recovery. He was re-elected in the 2013 elections, but resigned from the Knesset for health reasons in December 2014, and was replaced by Raleb Majadele.

Ben-Eliezer was a candidate to succeed Shimon Peres as President of Israel in 2014, but withdrew after allegations of corruption surfaced against him.

==Views and opinions==
Ben-Eliezer was considered a hawk on foreign policy and was one of the main architects of the invasion of Lebanon as well as a strong proponent for Operation Defensive Shield. He advocated halting peace talks with Palestinians until there was an end to violence against Israelis, although he believed once their leadership is able to put a stop to terrorism and abandon it as a political tool there should be &quot;compromise&quot; in final status talks with the Palestinian Authority.

Ben-Eliezer warned in 2012: &quot;So far Palestinians have kept quiet, but one day they will awake and the explosion will happen. People don&#x27;t accept [being] under military rule for 50 years.&quot;

==Death==
On the afternoon of 28 August 2016, Binyamin died at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center from kidney disease. He was 80 years old. He was buried in South Cemetery.

<doc id="1258728" wikidata="Q5648736" url="?curid=1258728" title="Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington">
<text>Johanna Mary Sheehy-Skeffington (née Sheehy; 24 May 1877 – 20 April 1946) was a suffragette and Irish nationalist. Along with her husband Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, Margaret Cousins and James Cousins, she founded the Irish Women&#x27;s Franchise League in 1908 with the aim of obtaining women&#x27;s voting rights. She was later a founding member of the Irish Women Workers&#x27; Union. Her son Owen Sheehy-Skeffington became a politician and Irish senator.

==Early life==
Hanna Sheehy was born in Kanturk, County Cork, Ireland, the daughter of Elizabeth &quot;Bessie&quot; McCoy and David Sheehy, an ex-Fenian and an MP for the Irish Parliamentary Party, representing South Galway. She spent her earliest years in a millhouse which her father also grew up in. When she was three years old the family relocated to Loughmore, Tipperary. She had six siblings, one of whom died at an unknown age; there is very little written about this child. Her siblings were Margaret, born 1875; Eugene, born 1882; Richard, born 1884; Mary Sheehy Kettle, born 1884; and Kathleen Cruise O&#x27;Brien, born 1886. One of her uncles, Father Eugene Sheehy, was known as the Land League Priest, and his activities landed him in prison. He was also one of Éamon de Valera&#x27;s teachers in Limerick.

When her father became an MP in 1887, the family moved to Hollybank, Drumcondra, Dublin. The family lived next door to the Lord Mayor of Dublin and poet of &quot;God Save Ireland&quot;, T.D. Sullivan.

Sheehy was sent to Germany for a short period when she was 18 years old to get treatment for tuberculosis.

After graduating from the Royal University of Ireland, she worked in Paris for a time as an au pair, returning to Ireland in 1902.

Her brother Richard was close friends with James Joyce. Joyce wrote about the Sheehys in his acclaimed novel Ulysses, depicting Bessie as a &#x27;social climbing matriarch&#x27;, a description to which she vehemently objected.
 When Sheehy was a teenager, her family held an open house on the second Sunday night of each month, at 2 Belvedere Place near Mountjoy Square in Dublin. They encouraged young people to visit them and their six children. James Joyce, who was a student at the nearby Belvedere College, and his younger brother Stanislaus, were regular visitors in 1896–1897. Joyce nursed a secret love for her sister Mary, the prettiest girl in the family (and later Mrs. Tom Kettle). The Sheehys were fond of singing and playing games and would ask their guests to sing.

== Education ==
Sheehy was educated at the Dominican Convent on Eccles Street, where she was a prize-winning pupil. She then enrolled at St Mary&#x27;s University College, a third-level college for women established by the Dominicans in 1893, to study modern languages (in her case, French and German). She sat for examinations at Royal University of Ireland and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1899, and a Master of Arts Degree with first-class honours in 1902. This led to a career as a teacher in Eccles Street and an examiner in the Intermediate Certificate examination.

== Personal life ==
Sheehy was introduced to Francis Skeffington, from County Down, by mutual friend James Joyce, who went to university with Skeffington. The couple would meet regularly in Bewley&#x27;s Cafe to discuss politics, the arts and religion.

Sheehy married Francis Skeffington on 3 June 1903 at University Chapel in St. Stephen&#x27;s Green, Dublin. The couple wore their graduation gowns as a substitute for a traditional wedding gown and suit. Both husband and wife took the surname Sheehy-Skeffington as a symbol of their honour for one another. This gesture angered Dr. J.B., Francis&#x27;s father, as it was seen as an act of betrayal to their family&#x27;s name.

The couple moved to 36 Airfield Road, Rathgar, Dublin, shortly after the ceremony. This was an area considered Pro-British at the time.

Sheehy-Skeffington had one child, a son named Owen. (In 2014, Owen&#x27;s daughter, Dr Micheline Sheehy-Skeffington, won a gender discrimination case against NUI Galway.)

Her sister Mary married the writer and politician Thomas Kettle. Another sister, Kathleen, married Frank Cruise O&#x27;Brien, and was the mother of Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien. The fourth of the sisters, Margaret, married a solicitor, John Culhane, and later the poet Michael Casey. Their two brothers worked as lawyers.

== Political life ==
Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington was born into a strongly republican family. She was influenced by James Connolly and during the 1913 lock-out worked with other suffragists in Liberty Hall, providing food for the families of the strikers.

Sheehy-Skeffington fought hard to get women the right to vote in Ireland, founding the IWFL in 1908 and also founding the publication &quot;The Irish Citizen&quot; with her husband. Her strong republican ties were also shown as she helped in the 1916 rising by delivering messages and food to the GPO.

She strongly opposed participation in the First World War which broke out in August 1914, and was prevented by the British government from attending the International Congress of Women held in The Hague in April 1915. The following June her husband was imprisoned for anti-recruiting activities. He was later shot dead during the 1916 Easter Rising, after having been arrested by British soldiers. She did not find out about his death until two days had passed. Sheehy-Skeffington refused compensation for her husband&#x27;s death. Lillian Metge, a regular &quot;Citizen&quot; reporter and suffragette friend (who bought Sheehy-Skeffington suitably coloured shoes at one time) wrote in sympathy and sharing her grief.

She aligned herself with Sinn Féin, giving them her support. In December 1916 she went to the US to talk about the fight for Irish independence and to raise awareness on behalf of Sinn Féin, attending 250 meetings. On her return, in 1917, she became an executive of Sinn Féin. In October 1917 she was the sole Irish representative to League of Small and Subject Nationalities where, along with several other contributors, she was accused of pro-German sympathies. She published &quot;British Militarism as I Have Known It&quot;, which was banned in the United Kingdom until after the First World War. Upon her return to Britain she was once again imprisoned, this time in Holloway prison. After her release, Sheehy-Skeffington attended the 1918 Irish Race Convention in New York City and later supported the anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War.

In 1920 she joined Dublin Corporation as a councillor and in 1926 she joined Fianna Fáil as an executive; however, she only kept this position for one year. During the 1930s she was assistant editor of &quot;An Phoblacht&quot; a journal of the Irish Republican Army. In January 1933 she was arrested in Newry for breaching an exclusion order banning her from Northern Ireland. At her trial she said: &quot;I recognise no partition. I recognise it as no crime to be in my own country. I would be ashamed of my own name and my murdered husband&#x27;s name if I did… Long live the Republic!&quot; and was sentenced to a month&#x27;s imprisonment.

At the 1943 general election, at the age of 66, Sheehy-Skeffington stood for the Dáil as an Independent candidate in the Dublin South constituency. She received 917 votes (1.7%) and was not elected.

== Involvement in feminism ==
Sheehy-Skeffington was a founding member of the Irish Women Workers&#x27; Union and an author whose works deeply opposed British imperialism in Ireland. Sheehy-Skeffington was a close friend of trade unionist and fellow suffragette Cissie Cahalan. The Irish Women&#x27;s Franchise League was formed in November 1908, with Sheehy-Skeffington among its founding members, along with her husband, Margaret Cousins, and James Cousins. Although it began with only twelve founding members, the I.W.F.L grew to become one of the largest suffrage groups that existed in the early twentieth century. The I.W.F.L. was a militant organisation that focused on trying to fight issues like the lack of Irish independence and the exclusion of women from the voting process in accordance with the Home Rule Bill and the absence of women&#x27;s rights in general.

The IWFL&#x27;s main goal was to ensure that votes for women were included in the proposed Home Rule Bill. Meetings on a weekly basis were held in Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park, alongside organised rallies throughout the country. According to Margaret Cousins, their work was met with much hostility, yet by 1912 it was estimated they had approximately 1000 members, making it Ireland&#x27;s largest suffrage society.

On 13 June 1912, she, along with seven other women, was arrested for smashing the glass windows of Dublin Castle. On 20 June she was convicted, along with fellow suffragettes Margaret Palmer and Jane and Margaret Murphy. They served a month-long sentence in Mountjoy prison, alongside another month after they refused to pay a fine. They were granted the privileges of political prisoners.

In November 1913 Sheehy-Skeffington attempted to present leaflets to the Conservative Party leader, Bonar Law, and the Ulster Unionist leader, Sir Edward Carson. She was arrested after assaulting a police officer and was sent to Mountjoy Prison again. She went on a hunger strike for five days until her release.

Sheehy-Skeffington was dismissed in 1913 from her job as a teacher at Rathmines School of Commerce for her continued involvement in feminist militancy.

In August 1918 she was arrested on Westmoreland Street. She was taken to Bridewell Jail and then Holloway Jail where she went on hunger strike.

Alongside Maud Gonne and Charlotte Despard, Sheehy-Skeffington helped establish the Women&#x27;s Prisoners&#x27; Defence League, to campaign and fundraise for over 7000 republicans who were imprisoned as a consequence of the Irish Civil War.

The Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom held its annual conference in Dublin in July 1926. Sheehy-Skeffington attended, along with twenty-one other Irish delegates. The president of the W.I.L.F.P.F, Jane Addams praised the bravery of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, for which Sheehy-Skeffington was grateful. Sheehy-Skeffington also attended the conference in 1929 in Prague.

In January 1933, she entered Northern Ireland to speak on behalf of the female republican prisoners being held in Armagh jail. She had been barred from entering Northern Ireland because of her political record and was subsequently arrested and held for fifteen days.

In 1935 she spoke out on behalf of the Women Graduates&#x27; Association against the Conditions of Employment Bill, which was set to restrict the opportunities of employment for women. She met and was photographed with the Indian independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose when he visited Ireland in 1936.

In 1937 she became a founding member of the Women&#x27;s Social and Progressive League, because of her dissatisfaction with parts of the new Irish Constitution relating to women.

== The Irish Citizen 1912–1920 ==
The &quot;Irish Citizen&quot; was a feminist newspaper launched by Sheehy-Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. It was first published on 25 May 1912 as an eight-page weekly newspaper. By June 1912 it was selling 3,000 copies and reaching up to 10,000 readers. The motto of the newspaper was, ‘For Men and Women Equally The Rights of Citizenship; For Men and Women Equally The Duties of Citizenship’.

Francis Sheehy-Skeffington and James Cousins, the husbands of the founders, were the first editors of the publication.

Sheehy-Skeffington, in October 1919 said that the newspaper was founded &quot;to further the cause of Woman Suffrage and Feminism in Ireland... In addition, it had stood for the rights of Labour, especially for the rights of women workers... we stood for the self-determination of Ireland.&quot; The newspaper covered topics such as Home Rule, Nationalism, and Feminism. It gave women and the suffragette movement their own voice to express their views. Lillian Metge, from Lisburn, wrote articles for the newspaper throughout the suffrage campaign and during World War One.

Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington took over the position of editor when her husband was shot in 1916 and remained in this role, on and off, until 1920 when the publication ceased.

== Lecture tours in America 1917–1923 ==
After the verdict in the court-martial of Bowen-Colthurst referring to her husband&#x27;s death, Sheehy-Skeffington was not satisfied with the outcome and decided to bring her story to America. She spoke at over 250 meetings for nineteen months across the United States expressing &#x27;British Militarism&#x27;.

Sheehy-Skeffington first appeared on 6 January 1917 at Carnegie Hall, New York City. From then onwards, she toured the New England States and the East: Boston, where &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; describe her as &quot;a wonderful woman. Her self-restraint and self-control were remarkable&quot;. Pittsfield, Massachusetts where &quot;The Pittsfield Daily News&quot; reported that: &quot;Those present were simply amazed at the wonderful poise and self-control of the speaker as she told stories perpetrated by the military authorities in Dublin that made the audience gasp with horror&quot;.

She also addressed huge crowds in New Haven, Springfield, Westfield, Hartford, Bridgeport, Lawrence, Meriden, Torrington, Fitchburg, New Bedford, Salem, Lowell, Worcester, Malden, Holyoke and Waterbury. She also had talks at Columbia and Harvard Universities.

From the 25th of February, Sheehy-Skeffington travelled to the Midwest. She had the most successful meetings at the Orchestra Hall, Chicago with over 3,000 people which included prominent figures of Chicago. Journalists, Supreme Court Justices, clergy, labour leaders, pacifists, suffragists, newspapermen and socialists also attended her lecture tours.

Sheehy-Skeffington returned to the East on March 4 and to the Midwest on April 11. Her tours start to move westward in the spring of 1917. She travelled to California, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Montana, Butte, Pasadena and San Francisco.

Sheehy-Skeffington wanted to tour New Mexico, Nebraska, Missouri and Alaska using her contacts as she wanted to extend her tours to various cities but it came to no avail.

In January 1918, Sheehy-Skeffington received a petition from the women of Cumann na mBan. The petition &quot;put forth the claim of Ireland for self-determination and appealed to President Wilson to include Ireland among the small nations for whose freedom America was fighting&quot;.

For the rest of the upcoming months until June, Sheehy-Skeffington returned to the Midwest and San Francisco. She also spoke in Madison Square Garden in May before leaving New York City with her son, Owen Sheehy-Skeffington on 27 June 1918, ending the first round of her lecture tours.

For the second round of her lectures, she replaced Muriel MacSwiney who was called back to Ireland by Eamon de Valera. She continued the Western section of the United States along with Kathleen Boland and Linda Kearns in 1922.

They travelled to the East and the Midwest because they wanted to raise funds for the relief of Irish prisoners and their families. In their speeches, they focused on the conditions in Ireland at the time of the War of Independence. During their tour which ended in May 1923, the delegation raised $123,000.

== Later life and death ==
She died, aged 69, in Dublin, and is buried with her husband in Glasnevin Cemetery.

== Legacy ==

There is a bronze statue of her in Kanturk, County Cork, Ireland.

In the 1990s, some of the students of Women&#x27;s Studies in University College Dublin petitioned to rename their Gender Studies building after Sheehy-Skeffington in order to honour her contribution to women&#x27;s rights and equal access to third-level education. Her husband Francis Sheehy-Skeffington was himself an alumnus of the university and Sheehy-Skeffington of the Royal University, a sister university of UCD. Their campaign was successful and the building was renamed the Hanna Sheehy Skeffington Building.

Her name and picture (and those of 58 other women&#x27;s suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.

A blue plaque commemorating Sheehy-Skeffington&#x27;s breaking of windows at Dublin Castle during a protest for women&#x27;s right to vote can be found on the Ship Street side of Dublin Castle. and her papers are held in the National Library of Ireland as part of the &quot;Sheehy Skeffington Papers&quot; collection.

In October 1977 the historian, Brian Harrison, interviewed Sheehy-Skeffington’s daughter-in-law, Andrée, as part of the Suffrage Interviews project, titled &quot;Oral evidence on the suffragette and suffragist movements: the Brian Harrison interviews&quot;. Andrée talks about Hanna’s education, her relationship with husband and son, and with Andrée herself, before discussing her political and religious views.

<text>Hunterville is a small town in the Rangitikei district of the North Island of New Zealand. It is located halfway between Taupo and Wellington on State Highway 1, and as of the 2018 census has a population of 408.

The township was named for George Hunter, who was a member of the Wellington Provincial Council. It straddles the state highway as well as the main trunk railway in the foothills forming the gateway to the Central Plateau.

The closest airport or airfield to Hunterville is RNZAF Base Ohakea, an important Royal New Zealand Air Force base, which is sited 33 km to the south west. 6 km north of Hunterville is Vinegar Hill.

Hunterville is well known for its statue of the huntaway, a specialised herding dog that uses its voice to drive the sheep. The town festival and market held on the first Saturday after Labour Day has a &quot;Shepherds Shemozzle&quot; – a race with man and dog with shepherds travelling from all over New Zealand to compete for the top prize.

There are marae south of the town at Rātā, which are affiliated with Ngāti Hauiti hapū. Tāhuhu Marae (or Taahuhu Marae) and Te Ruku a Te Kawau meeting house is a meeting place for Ngāti Haukaha. Rātā or Te Hou Hou or Potaka Marae and Hauiti meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Ruaanga and Ngāti Tamateraka.

== History ==
From at least 1895 to 1948 the Hunterville Express was published in the town. It was one of 45 newspapers founded by Joseph Ives. Other editors were Cuthbert James Powell, Walter Keay, who was also a novelist and whose wife had earlier signed a suffrage petition in 1893, when women first gained a vote. In 1905 it was the Hunterville Express and Upper Rangitikei Advertiser, published 3 times a week. The Express offices were burnt out in 1917.

The Hunterville railway station on the North Island Main Trunk line opened in 1887 and closed in 1988.

The town&#x27;s memorial for the First World War was unveiled in 1923. 

Kiwiburn, the New Zealand Burning Man regional burn, has been held there since 2014.

<text>MIT Technology Review is a bimonthly magazine wholly owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was founded in 1899 as The Technology Review, and was re-launched without &quot;The&quot; in its name on April 23, 1998, under then publisher R. Bruce Journey. In September 2005, it was changed, under its then editor-in-chief and publisher, Jason Pontin, to a form resembling the historical magazine.

Before the 1998 re-launch, the editor stated that &quot;nothing will be left of the old magazine except the name.&quot; It was therefore necessary to distinguish between the modern and the historical &quot;Technology Review&quot;. The historical magazine had been published by the MIT Alumni Association, was more closely aligned with the interests of MIT alumni, and had a more intellectual tone and much smaller public circulation. The magazine, billed from 1998 to 2005 as &quot;MIT&#x27;s Magazine of Innovation&quot;, and from 2005 onwards as simply &quot;published by MIT&quot;, focused on new technology and how it is commercialized; was sold to the public and targeted at senior executives, researchers, financiers, and policymakers, as well as MIT alumni.

In 2011, &quot;Technology Review&quot; received an &quot;Utne Reader&quot; Independent Press Award for Best Science/Technology Coverage.

==History==

===Original magazine: 1899–1998===
&quot;Technology Review&quot; was founded in 1899 under the name &quot;The Technology Review&quot; and relaunched in 1998 without &quot;The&quot; in its original name. It currently claims to be &quot;the oldest technology magazine in the world.&quot;

In 1899, &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented:

We give a cordial welcome to No. 1 of Vol. I of The Technology Review, a Quarterly Magazine Relating to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, published in Boston, and under charge of the Association of Class Secretaries. As far as make-up goes, cover, paper, typography and illustrations are in keeping with the strong characteristics of the Institution it represents. This magazine, as its editors announce, is intended to be &quot;a clearing house of information and thought,&quot; and, as far as the Institute of Technology is concerned, &quot;to increase its power, to minimize its waste, to insure [sic] among its countless friends the most perfect co-operation.&quot;

The career path of James Rhyne Killian illustrates the close ties between &quot;Technology Review&quot; and the Institute. In 1926, Killian graduated from college and got his first job as assistant managing editor of &quot;Technology Review;&quot; he rose to editor-in-chief; became executive assistant to then-president Karl Taylor Compton in 1939; vice-president of MIT in 1945; and succeeded Compton as president in 1949.

The May 4, 1929, issue contained an article by Dr. Norbert Wiener, then Assistant Professor of Mathematics, describing some deficiencies in a paper Albert Einstein had published earlier that year. Wiener also commented on a cardinal&#x27;s critique of the Einstein theory saying:

The pretended incomprehensibility of the Einstein theory has been used as capital by professional anti-Einsteinians. Without prejudice to the cause of religion, I may remark that theological discussions have not at all times been distinguished by their character of lucidity.

The historical &quot;Technology Review&quot; often published articles that were controversial, or critical of certain technologies. A 1980 issue contained an article by Jerome Wiesner attacking the Reagan administration&#x27;s nuclear defense strategy. The cover of a 1983 issue stated, &quot;Even if the fusion program produces a reactor, no one will want it,&quot; and contained an article by Lawrence M. Lidsky, associate director of MIT&#x27;s Plasma Fusion Center, challenging the feasibility of fusion power (which at the time was often fancied to be just around the corner). The May 1984 issue contained an exposé about microchip manufacturing hazards.

In 1966, the magazine started using a puzzle column started in &quot;Tech Engineering News&quot; a few months earlier. Its author is Allan Gottlieb, who has now written the column for more than fifty years.

As late as 1967, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described &quot;Technology Review&quot; as a &quot;scientific journal.&quot; Of its writing style, writer George V. Higgins complained:

&quot;Technology Review&quot;, according to [then-editor] Stephen Marcus... [subjects] its scientific contributors to rewrite rigors that would give fainting spells to the most obstreperous cub reporter. Marcus believes this produces readable prose on arcane subjects. I don&#x27;t agree.

In 1984, &quot;Technology Review&quot; printed an article about a Russian scientist using ova from frozen mammoths to create a mammoth-elephant hybrid called a &quot;mammontelephas&quot;. Apart from being dated &quot;April 1, 1984&quot;, there were no obvious giveaways in the story. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; News Service picked it up as a real news item, and it was printed as fact in hundreds of newspapers.

In 1994, a survey of &quot;opinion leaders&quot; ranked &quot;Technology Review&quot; No. 1 in the nation in the &quot;most credible&quot; category.

Contributors to the magazine also included Thomas A. Edison, Winston Churchill, and Tim Berners-Lee.

===Relaunch: 1998–2005===
A radical transition of the magazine occurred in 1996. At that time, according to the &quot;Boston Business Journal&quot;, in 1996 &quot;Technology Review&quot; had lost $1.6 million over the previous seven years and was &quot;facing the possibility of folding&quot; due to &quot;years of declining advertising revenue.&quot;

R. Bruce Journey was named publisher, the first full-time publisher in the magazine&#x27;s history. According to previous publisher William J. Hecht, although &quot;Technology Review&quot; had &quot;long been highly regarded for its editorial excellence,&quot; the purpose of appointing Journey was to enhance its &quot;commercial potential&quot; and &quot;secure a prominent place for &quot;Technology Review&quot; in the competitive world of commercial publishing.&quot; John Benditt replaced Steven J. Marcus as editor-in-chief, the entire editorial staff was fired, and the modern &quot;Technology Review&quot; was born.

&quot;Boston Globe&quot; columnist David Warsh described the transition by saying that the magazine had been serving up &quot;old 1960s views of things: humanist, populist, ruminative, suspicious of the unseen dimensions of new technologies&quot; and had now been replaced with one that &quot;takes innovation seriously and enthusiastically.&quot; Former editor Marcus characterized the magazine&#x27;s new stance as &quot;cheerleading for innovation.&quot;

Under Bruce Journey, &quot;Technology Review&quot; billed itself as &quot;MIT&#x27;s Magazine of Innovation&quot;. Since 2001, it has been published by Technology Review Inc., a nonprofit independent media company owned by MIT.

Intending to appeal to business leaders, editor John Benditt said in 1999, &quot;We&#x27;re really about new technologies and how they get commercialized.&quot; &quot;Technology Review&quot; covers breakthroughs and current issues on fields such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and computing. Articles are also devoted to more mature disciplines such as energy, telecommunications, transportation, and the military.

Since Journey, &quot;Technology Review&quot; has been distributed as a regular mass-market magazine and appears on newsstands. By 2003, circulation had more than tripled from 92,000 to 315,000, about half that of &quot;Scientific American,&quot; and included 220,000 paid subscribers and 95,000 sent free to MIT alumni. Additionally, in August 2003, a German edition of &quot;Technology Review&quot; was started in cooperation with the publishing house Heinz Heise (circulation of about 50,000 as of 2005). According to The &quot;New York Times&quot;, as of 2004 the magazine was still &quot;partly financed by M.I.T. (though it is expected to turn a profit eventually).&quot;

&quot;Technology Review&quot; also functions as the MIT alumni magazine; the edition sent to alumni contains a separate section, &quot;MIT News,&quot; containing items such as alumni class notes. This section is not included in the edition distributed to the general public.

The magazine is published by Technology Review, Inc, an independent media company owned by MIT. MIT&#x27;s website lists it as an MIT publication, and the MIT News Office states that &quot;the magazine often uses MIT expertise for some of its content.&quot; In 1999 &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; noted that (apart from the alumni section) &quot;few &quot;Technology Review&quot; articles actually concern events or research at MIT.&quot; However, in the words of editor Jason Pontin:

Our job is not to promote MIT; but we analyse and explain emerging technologies, and because we believe that new technologies are, generally speaking, a good thing, we do indirectly promote MIT&#x27;s core activity: that is, the development of innovative technology.

From 1997 to 2005, R. Bruce Journey held the title of &quot;publisher&quot;; Journey was also the president and CEO of Technology Review, Inc. Editors-in-chief have included John Benditt (1997), Robert Buderi (2002), and Jason Pontin (2004).

The magazine has won numerous Folio! awards, presented at the annual magazine publishing trade show conducted by &quot;Folio!&quot; magazine. In 2001, these included a &quot;Silver Folio: Editorial Excellence Award&quot; in the consumer science and technology magazine category and many awards for typography and design. In 2006, &quot;Technology Review&quot; was named a finalist in the &quot;general excellence&quot; category of the annual National Magazine Awards, sponsored by the American Society of Magazine Editors.

On June 6, 2001, &quot;Fortune&quot; and CNET Networks launched a publication entitled &quot;Fortune/CNET Technology Review&quot;. MIT sued &quot;Fortune&quot;″s parent corporation, Time, Inc. for infringement of the &quot;Technology Review&quot; trademark. The case was quickly settled. In August the MIT student newspaper reported that lawyers for MIT and Time were reluctant to discuss the case, citing a confidentiality agreement that both sides described as very restrictive. Jason Kravitz, a Boston attorney who represented MIT in the case, suggested that the magazine&#x27;s change of name to &quot;Fortune/CNET Tech Review&quot;, a change that occurred in the middle of the case, may have been part of the settlement.

Many publications covering specific technologies have used &quot;technology review&quot; as part of their names, such as Lawrence Livermore Labs&#x27;s &quot;Energy &amp; Technology Review&quot;, AACE&#x27;s &quot;Educational Technology Review&quot;, and the International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s &quot;Nuclear Technology Review.&quot;

The magazine adopted a more serious tone in a 2004 redesign.

In 2005, &quot;Technology Review&quot;, along with &quot;Wired News&quot; and other technology publications, was embarrassed by the publication of a number of stories by freelancer Michelle Delio containing information which could not be corroborated. Editor-in-chief Pontin said, &quot;Of the ten stories which were published, only three were entirely accurate. In two of the stories, I&#x27;m fairly confident that Michelle Delio either did not speak to the person she said she spoke to, or misrepresented her interview with him.&quot; The stories were retracted.

===Modern magazine: 2005–present===
On August 30, 2005, &quot;Technology Review&quot; announced that R. Bruce Journey, publisher from 1996 to 2005, would be replaced by the then current Editor in Chief, Jason Pontin, and would reduce the print publication frequency from eleven to six issues per year while enhancing the publication&#x27;s website. The Boston Globe characterized the change as a &quot;strategic overhaul.&quot; Editor and publisher Jason Pontin stated that he would &quot;focus the print magazine on what print does best: present[ing] longer-format, investigative stories and colorful imagery.&quot; Technology Review&#x27;s Web site, Pontin said, would henceforth publish original, daily news and analysis (whereas before it had merely republished the print magazine&#x27;s stories). Finally, Pontin said that Technology Review&#x27;s stories in print and online would identify and analyze emerging technologies. This focus resembles that of the historical &quot;Technology Review.&quot; Pontin convinced copy editors to adopt the diaeresis mark for words like &quot;coördinate&quot;, a rarity in native English usage, though failed to convince them to use logical punctuation.

Without evident comment, the July/August, 2017, issue revealed a shift in top personnel, with Elizabeth Bramson-Boudreau listed as Chief Executive Officer and Publisher, and David Rotman as Editor. Gideon Lichfield was named editor-in-chief in November 2017.

In 2020, the Brazilian version of MIT Technology Review, known as MIT Technology Review Brasil, was launched.

The magazine, like many others has transitioned its focus from print to digital.

Every year, the magazine publishes a list of the 10 technologies it considers the most influential.

== Annual lists ==
Each year, MIT Technology Review publishes three annual lists:
* Innovators Under 35 (formerly TR35)
* 10 Breakthrough Technologies
* 50 Smartest Companies

=== Innovators Under 35 ===

&quot;MIT Technology Review&quot; has become well known for its annual Innovators Under 35. In 1999, and then in 2002—2004, MIT Technology Review produced the &quot;TR100&quot;, a list of &quot;100 remarkable innovators under the age of 35.&quot; In 2005, this list was renamed the &quot;TR35&quot; and shortened to 35 individuals under the age of 35. Notable recipients of the award include Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Geekcorps creator Ethan Zuckerman, Linux developer Linus Torvalds, BitTorrent developer Bram Cohen, MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; bioengineer Jim Collins, investors Micah Siegel and Steve Jurvetson, and Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen. The list was renamed Innovators Under 35 in 2013.

<doc id="1258752" wikidata="Q786959" url="?curid=1258752" title="2000 Polish presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Poland on 8 October 2000. Incumbent President Aleksander Kwaśniewski was easily re-elected in the first round with more than 50% of the vote, the only time a direct presidential election in Poland has not gone to a second round.

Kwaśniewski would be the last president to be re-elected until Andrzej Duda in 2020.

==Background==
President Kwaśniewski was seen as very likely to win re-election in the run up to the presidential election with polls showing that his popularity was high as 70% support. His main challenger was expected to be Marian Krzaklewski from the Solidarity Electoral Action, which had formed the government since winning the last parliamentary elections in 1997. The other main candidate was a former Foreign Minister and more liberal conservative Andrzej Olechowski, who won support from voters who were discontented with both of the other main candidates and in particular younger voters, businessmen and intellectuals.

Candidates seen as having less of a chance included Andrzej Lepper, a populist farmers leader who opposed entry into the European Union and former president Lech Wałęsa. Wałęsa was rejected as the candidate for the Solidarity party he had won the presidency for, and thus ran separately in the election.

In order to be elected in the first round a candidate had to gain over 50% of the vote. If no candidate reached this level, then a second round would have been held between the top two candidates. As the campaign continued, the biggest question in the election was whether or not incumbent President Kwaśniewski would win the 50% required to avoid a second round.

In the August before the election Kwaśniewski and another former president and candidate Lech Wałęsa were investigated by a court on allegations that they had been informers for the Communist secret police. If they had been found guilty they could have been banned from seeking election to political office for 10 years. However they both claimed that the evidence had been manipulated by political opponents and were cleared by the court.

Solidarity candidate Krzaklewski attacked Kwaśniewski for his past as a Communist party activist. However opinion polls in August showed this had little effect with Kwaśniewski well ahead with over 60% support, while Krzaklewski was second and Olechowski third, but both a long way behind. President Kwaśniewski&#x27;s campaign focused on reconciling all of Poland with slogans including &quot;Poland, our common home&quot;. Most voters felt he had done well as President and he was seen as having done a good job in guiding Poland to membership of NATO. Krzaklewski&#x27;s popularity was not high due to the infighting in the government led by his Solidarity party since they had won the 1997 parliamentary election. Meanwhile, Lech Wałęsa trailed badly in the polls with only about 2% support, which Wałęsa saw as being due to voters seeing him as being responsible for the pain involved in the transition from communism.

In the election 3 candidates ran on platforms against the European Union. During the campaign one of them, Andrzej Lepper, was arrested for illegally blocking a customs post, however he claimed that this was an attempt to sabotage his campaign.

As the election neared Kwaśniewski dropped in the polls and it became uncertain whether he would win the 50% required to avoid a second round. This followed a television advertisement from Solidarity candidate Krzaklewski in which Kwaśniewski was accused of having mocked Pope John Paul II. The video showed Kwaśniewski apparently urging his security advisor to kiss the ground is a parody of the Pope, although Kwaśniewski claimed this was inaccurate. At least one poll showed Kwaśniewski&#x27;s support having dropped by 10% in one week following this, however it was the other main candidate, Andrzej Olechowski, who benefited as Krzaklewski was seen as being tarnished for having run a negative campaign.

===Campaign spending===
==Candidates==
There was no second round since Aleksander Kwaśniewski got over 50% in the first round.

First Round

* Businessman Bogdan Pawłowski (Independent), 55 
* Generał broni Tadeusz Wilecki (National Party), 55

=== Withdrawn ===
==Opinion polls==
==Results==
Incumbent President Kwaśniewski won the election in the first round receiving almost 54% of the vote. Independent Andrzej Olechowski came second beating Solidarity candidate Krzaklewski into third place. Meanwhile, former President Lech Wałęsa only won 1% of the vote and following the election stood down as leader of his small Christian Democratic party.

<text>Stephanie Graf (born 26 April 1973, in Klagenfurt) is an Austrian former middle distance runner who won silver medals in the 800 metres at both the Olympic Games and the World Athletics Championships. In June 2010 Graf was suspended for two years for an anti-doping rule violation.

==Biography==
Graf finished second to Maria de Lurdes Mutola in the women&#x27;s 800 meters at both the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and the 2001 World Athletics Championships in Edmonton, Alberta. Her time from the 2000 Olympics, 1:56.64 minutes, is the current Austrian 800 metres record.

Proceedings were issued against Graf by the Austria&#x27;s anti-doping authority in May 2010. Following the revelation that the Humanplasma laboratory had aided around 30 athletes with blood doping practices, Graf admitted that her blood had been taken at the lab, but insisted that it had never been re-injected (which would have improved her performances).

In June 2010, Graf was suspended for two years for the attempted use of a prohibited method.

He stood as the party&#x27;s candidate in the 2000 presidential election but received only 1% of the vote. It never gained substantial support.

==History==
The former president announced the establishment of the new formation in the autumn of 1997, before the parliamentary election, in which he supported the Solidarity Electoral Action. In theory, it was to become the first Polish mass Christian Democrats, the lack of which – and in a country as Catholic as Poland – was pointed out by politicians. Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s new party, built at the institute bearing his name, did not gain any significance on the political scene.

The ChDRP was registered by the court on 2 December 1997, and its first congress, at which the party&#x27;s national leadership was elected, took place in September 1998. Initially, a group of about 10 AWS parliamentarians joined the party, including Stanisław Iwanicki (the party&#x27;s deputy chairman), Jerzy Gwiżdż, Marek Kolasiński, Jan Oraniec, Konstanty Miodowicz, Władysław Skrzypek, Bernard Szweda and others (mainly associated with the Solidarity in the Elections movement). Gradually, most of them left the party for other groups (RS AWS, SKL, transformed into the SwW party). The Christian Democrats&#x27; authorities also included Marek Gumowski (board chairman), Marek Karpiński (spokesperson) and Elżbieta Hibner. The party ran in the local elections in 1998.

In October 2000, Lech Wałęsa ran in the presidential election, receiving 1.01% of the votes (7th place out of 12 candidates), after which he resigned from the position of the party&#x27;s chairman, receiving the title of honorary chairman.

In 2001, ChDRP signed an agreement with the Janusz Tomaszewski Civic Forum to run jointly in the parliamentary election of the same year under the name Civic Forum Christian Democracy. This committee did not register electoral lists for the Sejm, and only put forward a few candidates for the Senate, none of whom received a mandate. ChDRP returned to activity under its own banner, ceasing any major activity. In the elections, several party members ran for the Sejm on the Civic Platform lists, and a few were also on the AWSP and ARS lists. None of them received a mandate.

Christian Democracy of the Third Polish Republic was removed from the register of political parties (where it was entered under number 3) in the spring of 2003 due to the lack of financial reports for previous years. On 12 May 2004 it was re-registered (under number 176; at the request of Lech Wałęsa, Gniewomir Rokosz-Kuczyński and Piotr Dwornicki). In the elections to the European Parliament the following month, ChDRP activists Gniewomir Rokosz-Kuczyński, Wojciech Żebrowski and Piotr Dwornicki ran from the lists of the National Electoral Committee of Voters (led by Maciej Płażyński), which did not receive any seats. The party&#x27;s activity then ceased.

In later years, some of the ChDRP circles became closer to the Right of the Republic. Gniewomir Rokosz-Kuczyński, who remained one of the group&#x27;s leaders, was also the district representative of Marek Jurek&#x27;s party in Kraków. In the 2011 parliamentary elections, Bogumiła Zwolińska from ChDRP ran for the Sejm from the Right&#x27;s list near Kraków.

The party became active in 2015. It registered a committee for the 2015 Polish parliamentary election, but ultimately did not run. However, it supported three candidates for the Senate (Jarosław Lasecki from PO and Anna Maria Anders and Konstanty Radziwiłł, who ran for PiS). On 10 November 2015, Lech Wałęsa announced the reactivation of ChDRP at a conference in the office of the European Solidarity Centre. He appointed Piotr Dwornicki and Adam Zalewski (who were also appointed vice-chairmen) and Adam Domiński (who was also appointed spokesman) as plenipotentiaries for the reactivation of the party. However, the party did not resume wider activity. In 2022, the party submitted a financial report to the National Electoral Commission after the required deadline set out in the Act on Political Parties. In 2023, ChDRP was deregistered from the register of political parties again.

<doc id="1258772" wikidata="Q947211" url="?curid=1258772" title="Keg">
<text>A keg is a small cask used for storing liquids. Wooden kegs made by a cooper were used to transport nails, gunpowder, and a variety of liquids. Nowadays a keg is normally constructed of stainless steel, although aluminium can be used if it is coated with plastic on the inside. It is commonly used to store, transport, and serve beer. Other alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks, carbonated or non-carbonated, may be housed in a keg as well. Carbonated drinks are generally kept under pressure in order to maintain carbon dioxide in solution, preventing the beverage from becoming flat.

==Beer keg==
Beer kegs are made of stainless steel, or less commonly, of aluminium. A keg has a single opening on one end, called a &quot;bung&quot;. A tube called a &quot;spear&quot; extends from the opening to the other end. There is a self-closing valve that is opened by the coupling fitting which is attached when the keg is tapped. There is also an opening at the top of the spear that allows gas (usually carbon dioxide) to drive the beer out of the keg. The coupling fitting has one or two valves that control the flow of beer out of and gas into the keg. The keg must be in the upright position, that is, with the opening on top, for the beer to be dispensed. Kegs can be contrasted to casks, which have two or more openings and no spear. Most major breweries now use internally speared kegs. Beer that is sold in kegs is fully conditioned. Beer intended for local use may be kegged without sterilization, however, the beer must stay cold. 

===Size===

Historically a beer barrel was a standard size of , as opposed to a wine barrel of , or an oil barrel of . Over the years barrel sizes have evolved, and breweries throughout the world use different sized containers. Even when the content capacity of two kegs are equal, e.g. metricized to 50 liters, the keg shape and tap system may differ greatly.

====U.S. keg sizes====
Most U.S. brewers sell beer in barrels of 15.5 gallons, barrels of 7.75 gallons, and barrels of 5.17 gallons.

Since keg sizes are not standardized, the keg cannot be used as a standard unit of measure for liquid volumes: despite this, a number of people still refer to kegs as if they were a unit of measure. This size standard varies from country to country and brewery to brewery, with most countries using the metric system rather than U.S. gallons.

In common parlance, the term &quot;keg&quot; refers to a half-barrel (15.5 U.S. gallon) vessel as this is the most common size used in restaurants, bars and limited home use. A quarter-barrel has a volume of 7.75 U.S. gallons. Generally, a keg is a vessel smaller than a barrel; thus, it is 30 gallons or smaller.

In the U.S. the terms &quot;half-barrel&quot; and &quot;quarter-barrel&quot; are derived from the U.S. beer barrel, legally defined as being equal to 31 U.S. gallons (this is not the same volume as some other units also known as &quot;barrels&quot;).

A 15.5 U.S. gallon keg is also equal to:

* Exactly 58.673882652 liters
* 124 U.S. pints
* 165 twelve U.S. fluid ounce drinks
* 6.875 24-unit cases of 12 fl oz cans
* 1,984 fluid ounces (U.S.)
* ≈12.90645 Imperial gallons
* ≈103.2516 Imperial pints
* 177 330ml drinks (U.K.)
* 7.375 24-unit cases of 330ml cans
* ≈2065.032 fluid ounces (imperial)

However, beer kegs can come in many sizes:
=====Specifications for a U.S. barrel keg=====
Accepted specifications for a standard keg are:

====DIN-keg and Euro-keg====

In Europe, the most common keg size is 50 liters. This includes the UK, which uses a non-metric standard keg of 11 imperial gallons: by coincidence, this is exactly . 

The German DIN 6647-1 and DIN 6647-2 have also defined kegs in sizes of 20 and 30 liters.

===Taps===
Kegs are sealed to contain the liquid and pressurized gas for storage and transportation. Most beer is served carbonated, and this is most easily accomplished by storing it carbonated as well. Beer kegs are designed to maintain the carbonation in a beverage by storing it with pressurized carbon dioxide in the headspace above the liquid. The liquid is also dispensed using pressurized gas; the pressure of the gas provides mechanical force to overcome friction and gravity to push the beer to the dispensing location.

To serve the beverage, a keg must be tapped to breach the container so that pressurized gas can be added and the liquid can be dispensed. Originally, this was done by hammering a tapping rod through a cork bung, similar to how a keystone is still used today to tap unpressurized cask ales. Tapping a keg this way would often waste a bit of beer, which would be forced out under pressure until the tap was secured. By the 1950s and 60s when metal kegs had replaced wooden ones, common tap systems included Golden Gate, Hoff–Stevens, and Peerless taps, which all had one or two couplers for pressurizing and dispensing the beer but retained a separate bunghole for cleaning and filling the keg which was sealed with a wooden bung. These made it easier to tap the keg, but still had sanitation problems (from the wooden bung and attachments that penetrated the keg, and from ports that were at the bottom of the keg next to the floor) and tended to leave some beer inaccessible at the bottom of the keg.

In the 1960s and 70s, several similar styles of tap were created in Europe and America which used a single hole for cleaning, filling, pressurizing, and dispensing. A single bunghole at the top of the keg is used to clean and fill the keg, after which it is sealed with a metal assembly containing a ball bearing which acts as a stopper, held in place by the gas pressure inside the keg. The tap is twisted or slid into place atop the keg, and a lever provides the mechanical force needed to push the ball bearing down, providing access to the keg&#x27;s contents. These taps, or &quot;couplers&quot;, are more sanitary and easy to operate, and were adopted by major U.S. breweries like Anheuser-Busch in the 1970s and quickly displaced other taps to become the industry standard. One such system was referred to as Sankey after its designer (GKN Sankey Ltd., named for founder Joseph Sankey). The term Sankey, often misspelled &quot;Sanke&quot;, has become a generic name for all of the similar industry standard couplers.

Today there are six industry standard couplers:
* The D System is used by most breweries in the Americas.
* The S System is used by many breweries in Europe. It is similar to the D System but has a longer probe.
* The G System (or Grundy) is less common and is used by some British and Irish breweries and beers including Tennent&#x27;s, Boddingtons, and Fuller&#x27;s ESB.
* The U System (or U/E.C.) is uncommon and is used for a few Irish beers (mainly beers from Guinness/Diageo: Guinness, Harp, Kilkenny, and Smithwick&#x27;s) and Magners cider.
* The A System (or Flat Top German) is used by many large German breweries. It slides into place rather than rotating.
* The M System is very uncommon and is used by only a few breweries in and around Germany (mainly for Aventinus Eisbock, Einbecker, Schneider, Veltins, and Żywiec). It also slides into place.

There are two different types of tapping equipment that are available for kegs. A &quot;party tap&quot; or &quot;picnic tap&quot; is a hand-operated pump that utilizes outside air, thus introducing oxygen and bacteria into the keg. This causes the beer to oxidize, affecting the taste; the partial pressure of CO2 will also decrease, causing the beer to go flat. Kegs dispensed with a party pump should be used within 18–24 hours so that the beer does not become unpalatable. Commercial installations, as well as some home users, use pure pressurized gas; these can preserve a keg up to 120 days with proper refrigeration. In simpler installations only CO2 is used to pressurize and dispense the beer, but in installations with very long lines between the keg and dispensing location (bars with customer-operated faucets at each table being an extreme example), the pressure needed to pump the beer for dispensing would over-carbonate the beer. In these situations, &quot;beer gas&quot; or &quot;mixed gas&quot; is used which combines CO2 with another gas, usually nitrogen. Nitrogen is 80 times less soluble in water than CO2, so it can provide additional pressure without noticeably affecting flavor. Typical beer gas is 70-75% nitrogen and 25-30% CO2, but the ideal ratio depends on the beer being served and the installation; more advanced installations blend the gas on site so it can be adjusted for each beer. A few beers like Guinness are required to be pressurized and dispensed with mixed gas; they usually also require the use of a special faucet that deliberately creates additional friction to force the nitrogen out of solution, creating a thick frothy head.

As with any pressurized container, a keg can cause injury, even at normal operating pressure, whether with compressed air or carbon dioxide:

Commercially, kegs are usually kept in a refrigerated room for storage and dispensing, and liquid lines run from this room to all of the faucets in the restaurant. Kegs are too large to fit in a typical home refrigerator. A kegerator (specially designed for kegs, or converted from a suitable small refrigerator) can be used, but as these are somewhat specialized they are cost-prohibitive for the average consumer who has only occasional use for one, and are obviously impractical to bring to a beach or campsite. Instead, in the US and Australia, kegs are usually kept in a bucket of ice and/or water to keep the beer cool. Alternately, the keg can be kept at ambient temperature and served using a &quot;jockey box&quot;, consisting of a cooler with beer coils ( metal dispensing lines arranged in a coil) and filled with ice, which acts as a heat exchanger to cool the beer to serving temperature by the time it reaches the faucet. European consumers, when not using a party pump, mainly use inline beer chillers, essentially the same concept as a jockey box but using a refrigeration unit instead of ice. Those chillers usually also have their own air compressor for keg pressurization.

==Other types of kegs==

===Cornelius keg===

The Cornelius keg (also known as a &quot;Corny keg&quot; or &quot;soda keg&quot;) was originally used by the soft drink industry. It is now commonly used to store and dispense beer, especially homebrewed.

Cornelius kegs were originally made by Cornelius, Inc., and were used for premix soft drinks. Since the arrival of newer technology such as bag-in-box packages, Cornelius kegs have become largely obsolete in the soft drink industry, and refurbished ones are readily available to hobbyists.

Cornelius kegs use two unique types of tap, both very similar to each other, known as ball locks and pin locks.

===Mini keg===

The mini keg is a 5-liter keg produced for retail sales. Some brands come with a spout and pour from the bottom via gravity, while others may use a low cost pressurized tap. Mini kegs are typically not returned to the manufacturer for cleaning and refilling. The disposable kegs, being made of aluminum, may be recycled.

In Canada, Molson brewery dubbed the mini keg &quot;Bubba&quot;. This name has now been genericized to generally apply to all 5-liter mini kegs in Canada . This might cause confusion, as a company called Bubba Keg is established in the U.S., and appears to not be associated with Molson. Today, mini kegs are widely available in liquor stores worldwide, with Heineken, Grolsch and Bitburger all adopting the design.

Recently in Austria, beer is available in mini kegs, either by a one-way type keg made of steel or out of a reinforced thermoplastic for about a 4 € deposit.

===Beer ball===
Another type of mini keg is the &quot;beer ball&quot; or the &quot;party ball&quot;, a disposable plastic ball that usually holds around , the equivalent of 55 twelve-ounce beers, though they can also be found in a smaller size. Like kegs, it is necessary to tap the ball before the beer inside can be served.

===One-way kegs===
 One-way kegs, also known as disposable kegs or PET kegs, were invented in 1996. They are usually made of plastic. Some types have a cardboard outer packaging, which makes them easier to stack and transport, and also protects the plastic container. Some may use either bag in ball or spear technology. Products like the Hybrid keg have a puncture resistant wall and are easy to disassemble after use. Circular by design, the top and bottom chimes can either be re-used or recycled.

===Quarter barrel (pony keg)===
A quarter barrel, more commonly known as pony keg, is a beer vessel containing approximately 7.75 U.S. gallons (29.33 liters) of fluid. It is half the size of the standard beer keg and equivalent to a quarter of a barrel. The term &quot;&quot; refers to its smaller size – compare pony glass (quarter-pint) and pony bottle. It will serve roughly 82 twelve-ounce cups. The shape of a pony keg resembles that of a full-sized keg while being much easier to move manually. However, it shares many inconveniences with the bigger kegs, such as: often requiring a deposit when purchased, needing a tap to serve the contents, and posing difficulties in determining the amount of beer remaining (weighing the keg or observing its buoyancy are common techniques). Despite this, a pony keg can be a cheap way to provide beer for a medium-sized party. In some places, such as Cincinnati, the term pony keg can mean a convenience store that sells beer.

===Sixth barrel===
A sixth barrel keg contains approximately 5.2 gallons, and is becoming the choice for many establishments and breweries that wish to use kegs smaller than a half barrel. The sixth barrel kegs are nominally larger in size and volume compared to the Cornelius keg. They are normally fitted with a standard US Type D Sanke coupler on a single downspout; whereas, Corny kegs are normally fitted with a flip-hatch, and a dual connector pin-lock or ball-lock top. Although the sixth barrel torpedo keg is approximately the same height as the standard half barrel, the smaller foot print of the sixth barrel allows retailers have a greater variety of beer in a small space. This size keg is quickly replacing the quarter barrel size which has the same foot print as a half barrel keg, but is only half as tall. Other than smaller circumference, sixth barrel kegs are very similar to their full-sized counterparts in construction. A stainless Micromatic brand sixth barrel keg weighs approximately 14-15 pounds (6.3–6.8 kg) when empty, and approximately 58-60 pounds (26.3-27.2 kg) when full.

===Eighth barrel===
An eighth barrel has the same dimensions as a sixth barrel, but the seven bottom-most inches are hollow.

==UK and Irish keg supply structure==

The beer vessel supply structure in the UK and Ireland is quite different, whilst the couplers for kegs have been largely standardised to sankey, grundy and interbrew, a couple of others exist such as UEC and U-Type, however these are much less common. The kegs themselves are made from stainless steel or aluminium. The standard keg size is 11 imperial gallons (50 litres or 88 imperial pints) and the vast majority of keg beers are supplied in this keg size. There are also smaller 30 litre (6.6 imperial gallons or 52.8 imperial pints) kegs, usually reserved for speciality and premium European beers.

A number of manufacturers also produce 18 imperial gallon (81.82 litres or 144 imperial pints) and 22 imperial gallon (100 litres or 176 imperial pints) kegs: however owing to their size they are not as popular, as manual handling is seen by some to be difficult, and as a result these tend to be used only for large-scale events and bars with a high output.

For bars that sell a large volume of beer, there is a 36 imperial gallon (163.64 litres or 288 imperial pints) keg. However, due to its very large size, few people can move it without assistance, making it an impractical choice otherwise.

==Keg laws==
In the U.S. as of 2005, there are 21 states and numerous localities that have keg registration laws. The laws vary widely in terms of whom they target, what their intended purpose is, and how strongly they are enforced.

<doc id="1258810" wikidata="Q799838" url="?curid=1258810" title="Rodolfo Pio da Carpi">
<text>Rodolfo Pio da Carpi (22 February 1500 – 2 May 1564) was an Italian cardinal, humanist and patron of the arts. The nephew of a diplomat, he himself became a diplomat by the age of thirty, and came to know both Emperor Charles V and King Francis of France, and he negotiated with both on behalf of the pope. His uncle, Alberto Pio da Carpi, had been educated by Pico della Mirandola, and had become a noted humanist scholar. These associations formed Rodolfo&#x27;s background and education. He formed a notable library and participated in the humanist studies of 16th-century Rome; he also served on the Roman Inquisition. He helped to establish the Inquisition at Milan.

==Biography==

===Family===
The lords of Carpi first made a position for themselves in the 14th century. From the house of Este they received the lordship of Carpi, and in 1518, through the influence of Pope Leo X, they acquired the subsidiary fiefs of Meldola and Sassuolo, with which Rodolfo Pio da Carpi was invested. Many members of the family continued in the family tradition as condottieri: Alberto Pio obtained from the house of Savoy in 1450 the privilege of adding &quot;di Savoia&quot; to his name, as a reward for his military services. Others besides Cardinal Carpi made careers in diplomacy: Alberto Pio (1475–1531) who was Imperial ambassador in Rome won fame as a man of learning. Ascanio Pio (d. 1649) was a dramatic poet. Spain conferred the title of prince on the family, and one branch of the family is to this day established in Spain.

===Education and early career===
Rodolfo Pio da Carpi was born in Carpi near Modena, where his uncle Alberto (c. 1475 – 1531) was lord of Carpi. His father was Lionello da Carpi and his mother was Maria Martinengo. In 1516 he was a Chevalier of the Knights of S. John of Jerusalem and Commendatory of the church of S. Lorenzo di Colorno in the diocese of Parma. Pope Leo X granted him the church of the Holy Trinity in Ferrara, clearly as a favor to his uncle rather than an acknowledgment of his own achievements. Rodolfo was sent to study at the University of Padua, where he became Doctor of Philosophy, and at Rome, where he took up an ecclesiastical career as a Papal Chamberlain under Pope Clement VII, who made him bishop of Faenza in 1528. There Carpi presided over a synod in 1533. He was absent, however, during most of the sixteen years of his episcopate, and therefore the duties of his office were performed by his brother Teodoro and by Segicellus of Faventia.

Carpi&#x27;s first mission to France took place between 26 July and 28 November 1530. He was back in France as a special envoy in the summer of 1533, charged with arranging a personal meeting between Francis I and Pope Clement VII. He was received by Francis at Lyon on 11 June. The pope wanted to meet at Nice, but eventually the meeting took place in Marseille, where the marriage of Henry II and Catherine de&#x27; Medici was solemnized, and where Pope Clement was able to engage in negotiations with both Francis I and Charles V.

Carpi attracted further notice in papal diplomacy when he was established as papal nuncio at the court of Francis I (1535–1537). His commission was dated 9 January 1535; he joined the Court at Saint-Germain on 17 February. There he negotiated a peace between King Francis and the Emperor Charles V, who was pleased enough to appoint him &quot;protector of the Holy Roman Empire&quot;. While Carpi was in France in 1533, there were rumors being spread around Rome, suggesting that Carpi was furnishing information to the Imperialists. Carpi was advised about these rumors by Pope Paul&#x27;s secretary, Ambrogio Ricalcato, who also indicated that they were being circulated by agents of the Cardinal de Lorraine. Evidently King Francis heard about these rumors as well, since, in the middle of the night of 26 January 1536 he summoned Carpi to tell him that he deplored these rumors and considered Carpi a good servant. The king wrote to the pope, asking for a red hat for Carpi; the pope replied that it would be a subject for the next consistory for the creation of cardinals. Carpi also initiated discussions about having a general council of the Church to address the problems of heresy and church reform, though it became clear immediately that the king and the emperor had entirely different views as to how, and where, and what. He left France in July 1537, having already been appointed Cardinal.

===Cardinalate===

Pope Paul III created Rodolfo Pio da Carpi a cardinal in the Consistory of 22 December 1536, and on 23 July 1537 he was given his cardinal&#x27;s ring and the &quot;titulus&quot; of Santa Pudenziana. He exchanged S. Pudenziana for Santa Prisca on 28 November 1537. On 19 December 1537 Cardinal Carpi was named &quot;Legatus a latere&quot; to King Francis I of France. He travelled to France in the company of Cardinal Cristoforo Jacobazzi, who had been named Legate to the Imperial Court in Spain. Both cardinals had a personal interview with King Francis at Montpellier in mid-January 1538. His purpose, and Jacobazzi&#x27;s, was to bring together Francis I and Charles V in a meeting with Pope Paul III. The meeting duly took place in May, though at Nice rather than at Montpellier, but Cardinal Carpi did not attend. He had been sent to Rome, to act as the pope&#x27;s prefect and Legate of the City in the pope&#x27;s absence.

On 21 April 1539, Carpi was appointed Legate to the March of Ancona; he served until 1542. The province was in disarray, due to the repeated campaigns of the French and Imperialists. After restoring order, Carpi&#x27;s most important work in that office was the revision of the Aegidian Constitutions, by which the March had been governed since 1357. Carpi&#x27;s work, into which he drew the assistance of fourteen experts, was finally given approval and authorization by Pope Paul III in September 1544.

In 1543, Cardinal Carpi composed a Memorandum for the Emperor Charles V, entitled &quot;Discorso del rev. card. di Carpi del 1543 a Carlo V Cesare del modo di dominare&quot;. The manuscript has never been published, but brief quotations have been published by Ludwig Pastor. The subject was the Duchy of Milan, which the Emperor Charles had taken from Francis I, and the content was advice on how to retain it. On no account should it be returned to Francis I.

Cardinal Carpi, as he now was, made his presence felt in the Roman Curia as a member of the Roman Inquisition and a defender of the new orders, the Capuchins and the Jesuits.

Cardinal Pio da Carpi became Cardinal Priest of San Clemente on 24 September 1543, which he exchanged for Santa Maria trans Tiberim on 17 October 1544.

In 1544 he was offered the See of Agrigentum (Girgenti) in Sicily by Charles V, and he was approved as Administrator of Girgenti by Pope Paul III on 10 October 1544. He held the post until his death. He never went to Girgenti, of course, since the appointment was only a financial benefit. In 1544, the Cardinal presided over the establishment of the Accademia degli Imperfetti in Meldola, the tiny principality of which his uncle Alberto Pio da Carpi had been the first ruler. This academy for the encouragement of cultured persons; the stimulation of culture itself was another of those multitudinous clubs that were formed in cities and towns throughout Italy for the pursuit of intellectual growth.

===Conclave of 1549–1550===

Pope Paul III died on Sunday, 10 November 1549. Cardinal Pio da Carpi was one of the fifty-one cardinals who participated at one point or another in the Conclave which began on 29 November 1549. There was much illness, coming and going, and one death in the Conclave. In the first Scrutiny, which did not take place until 4 December, at which forty-one cardinals were present, Cardinal Reginald Pole, the favorite candidate of the Emperor, received between 24 and 26 votes, only four (or two) votes short of a valid canonical election. The French Ambassador protested that if the election took place without the presence of the French cardinals, who were en route, he would declare the Election invalid. The French were promoting Giovanni Salviati (Bishop of Porto and cousin of Catherine de&#x27; Medici, Queen of France) and Ridolfo Pio de Carpi, and were commanded to prevent the election of Cardinal Pole at all costs. Cardinal Carpi received nine votes in the fourteenth Scrutiny on 17 December, just after the majority of the French cardinals had entered the Conclave. But it was his high water mark. The French votes quickly redeployed, seeking a more viable candidate. The last of the French cardinals, the Cardinal de Bourbon, did not reach the Conclave until 14 January 1550, thereby raising the number of participants to 48. The voting had fallen into a stagnant pattern, 21 votes for Pole, 21 votes for Carafa of Naples. Forty-seven cardinals participated in the final vote, which took place on 7 February 1550 and elected Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, a member of the Farnese faction.

Pope Julius III (Ciocchi del Monte) promoted (&#x27;preferred&#x27;) Cardinal Carpi to the See of Frascati (Tusculum) on 11 December 1553. Cardinal Carpi was &#x27;preferred&#x27; to the See of Porto on 29 May 1555.

In 1558, King Philip II of Spain bestowed an annual income of 10,000 scudi upon the diocese of Agrigento (which had been worth only 4,000), which was still being held by Rodolfo Pio da Carpi as a gift from the Emperor Charles V. The new grant was for services rendered, no doubt, and in anticipation of future services on the part of a most influential Cardinal.

===Conclave of 1559===
Pio da Carpi was the favorite candidate of King Philip II of Spain in the Conclave of 5 September–26 December 1559, which followed the death of Pope Paul IV, along with Jacopo Puteo (President of the Inquisition in Rome), Giovanni Angelo de&#x27; Medici (brother of the Marchese di Marignano), and Clemente D&#x27;Olera (former head of the Observant Franciscans). All of those candidates were rigorously orthodox, which was an essential criterion for Philip II&#x27;s choice. It was said by the French Ambassador that Cardinals Carpi and Ricci were circulating a story in the Conclave to the effect that Cardinal de&#x27; Medici had Lutheran tendencies, and that he had said that it might be necessary to loosen the requirements on celibacy of the clergy and to allow the laity to receive both the bread and the wine in Holy Communion. Carpi had been the leader of the Imperial faction in the Conclave of 1555. The intractable resistance of the leader of the French faction, cardinal Ippolito d&#x27;Este, however, prevented his being considered a serious candidate for the papacy.

On 18 May 1562, Cardinal Rodolfo Pio da Carpi was promoted Bishop of Ostia and Dean of the College of Cardinals, succeeding François de Tournon who had died on 22 April 1562.

===Artistic interests===
Carpi&#x27;s broader modern interest for historians centers on his collection of classical sculpture and other antiquities, which formed one of the prominent museums of Rome. &quot;Roma nihil possidet magnificentius, nihil admirabilius&quot; one guidebook remarked (&quot;Rome possesses nothing more magnificent, nor to be more admired&quot;). And his Greek and Latin library, dispersed after his death, brought scholars and humanists, not invariably good Catholics, to his palazzo in the Campo Marzio, the Campus Martius of Antiquity. Also his suburban villa was on the site of the gardens of Sallust, on the flank of the Quirinal Hill. In the 1550s the Flemish medallist and epigrapher Antoine Morillon studied the Latin inscriptions in the Cardinal&#x27;s gallery. Even reading the dry inventories furnish materials for the historian of taste. The semi-public collections of princes and cardinals made Rome a museum-city, memorialized by Ulisse Aldrovandi&#x27;s guidebook &quot;Delle Statue antiche che per tutta Roma si veggono&quot;, 1556 Aldrovandi praised the delights of the Carpi antiquities in their rustic suburban setting. Even after Cardinal Carpi&#x27;s death, the collections drew sculptors and artists.

Among the antiquities that belonged to Cardinal Carpi:
* The bronze bust called the &quot;Capitoline Brutus&quot; that Pio da Carpi bequeathed to the City of Rome, now in the Capitoline Museums. (Haskell and Penny, cat. 14).
* The ecstatic marble head called the &quot;Dying Alexander&quot;, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence by 1579; often copied in plaster, bronze and marble. (Haskell and Penny, cat. 2).
* Bronze and marbles bought from Duke Alfonso II d&#x27;Este some of which disappeared after they belonged to Rudolf II at Prague. 
* A 5th-century manuscript of the complete works of Virgil, called the &quot;Medici Virgil&quot; after it was purchased for the Laurentian Library, Florence.

Cardinal Carpi did not neglect the moderns; among his paintings:
* &quot;Madonna of the Divine Love&quot; by Raphael, which Vasari said had been commissioned by the cardinal&#x27;s father, Leonello da Carpi; it passed to the Farnese and in now at the Capodimonte Museum, Naples.
* &quot;History of the Madonna of Loreto&quot; and &quot;Saint Jerome in his study&quot; by Lorenzo Lotto.
* &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot;, originally attributed to Sebastiano del Piombo; now thought to be by Francesco Salviati, at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.

===Death===
Cardinal Carpi died in Rome on 2 May 1564, in his 65th year, at the Palazzo Pallavicini in the Campo Marzio, where he had a lease for life. He had long suffered from gout (&quot;podagra&quot;), by which he was so tormented in the last four months of his life that he could not eat, speak or sleep without great pain. On his death he left a considerable debt, which was criticized by Pope Pius IV. He is interred in Rome at Santissima Trinità dei Monti, above the Spanish Steps, where there is a sepulchral monument erected to his memory by Pope Pius V in 1568.

<text>Kaladar is a compact rural community in the municipality of Addington Highlands, Lennox and Addington County in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It is located at the junction of Ontario Highway 7 and Ontario Highway 41.

This area was first settled following the construction of the Addington Road in 1857. It was originally named Scouten after its first postmaster. The former Canadian Pacific Railway Havelock Subdivision rail bed passing through the town has been turned into a rail trail and become part of the Trans Canada Trail. The Kaladar fire tower was situated at the north end of the village just off the highway, but was removed some time in the 1970s or 1980s.

The name is also used for Kaladar Township, a geographic township, in which Kaladar lies roughly at the centre.

<text>Tushhan (alternatively spelled as Tushan or Tušḫan) was a Neo-Assyrian provincial capital in the upper Tigris region. It was rebuilt by the ruler Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) and survived until the end of the Neo-Assyrian period around 611 BC.

It is generally thought to be located at the site of the archaeological site Ziyaret Tepe (), Diyarbakır Province, Turkey though Üçtepe Höyük has also been proposed.

==History of Tušḫan==
In the Middle Iron Age the second tier provincial capitol was built/rebuilt by Neo-Assyrian ruler Ashurnasirpal II. From one of his texts:
==Site History==
The site of Ziyaret Tepe was occupied as early as the Early Bronze Age. Most of the urban development uncovered to date is from the Middle Iron Age, when the city was rebuilt after its collapse at the end of the Late Bronze Age. In Neo-Assyrian times it is thought to have been known as Tushhan, until to 605 BC, when that empire fell. The site was also occupied in a much smaller scale in the Hellenistic, Roman, Medieval and Ottoman periods.

==Archaeology==
The site covers an area of 32 hectares, composed of a 3 hectare upper mound and a 29 hectare lower town extending to the eastern, southern, and western sides. In the Neo-Assyrian period the site had a 4 meter wide fortification wall with a fortified gate. The site has been damaged by iron irrigation piping supporting cotton farming area and the lower town degraded by wheat farming. The southeastern part of the main mound is covered by a modern shrine and grave area used by locals.

The site was identified in the 1990s for rescue archaeology as it was expected to be inundated by the Ilısu Dam which was scheduled for completion in 2016 but has only recently reached operational levels. Work at the location began with 3 years of surface survey and remote sensing in 1997. Work included magnetometry, resistivity analysis, and a limited use of ground penetrating radar.
From 2000 until 2014 the site was being excavated by a team directed by Timothy Matney of the University of Akron and John Macginnis of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at Cambridge University. A Neo-Assyrian period monumental building was found on the main mound, termed a palace by the excavators. It was destroyed by fire c. 800 BC though later occupation occurred in the area. The number of bronze vessels found led the excavators to name it the Bronze Palace. Under the floor were found five cremation burials with grave goods including bronze vessels, stone bowls, ivory and a stamp seal. Small finds at the site included various military paraphernalia of that period including armor scales, and bronze and iron arrowheads and spearheads. In the Lower Town barrack, high status residences, and an administrative building were found.

Thirty five late Neo-Assyrian period cuneiform clay tablets, mostly fragmentary, were found at the site, along with clay sealings and hundreds of clay tokens. One tablet, thought to be from the final days, read:
One damaged Neo-Assyrian period cuneiform tablet originally contained a list of 169 names of which 59 were still legible. For some of the names the original language, Akkadian etc, could be identified but for the rest this was not the case. The epigrapher speculated that the unknown language might be Shubrian, a little known language of that region.

<text>The NIR 101 Class is a class of diesel-electric locomotive formerly operated by Northern Ireland Railways (NIR). With the return to the working of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; service from Belfast to Dublin with coaching stock instead of augmented diesel railcar sets, NIR found itself with no suitable main line diesel locomotives. The 101 Class (DL) became the answer to the immediate problem working in conjunction with the newly acquired British Rail Mark 2 coaches.

==History==

The 101 Class of NIR consisted of three mainline diesel-electric locomotives designed for use with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; passenger services between Belfast and Dublin. The intention was to reduce the time for the 180 km (112-mile) journey to two hours. The design of the superstructure and bogies was carried out by the Hunslet Engine Company of Leeds with English Electric-AEI Traction being responsible for the traction equipment. The contract stipulated a ten-month delivery period but with Hunslet&#x27;s workshops already committed, the superstructure and assembly was contracted out to (British Rail Engineering Limited&#x27;s, Doncaster Works), Hunslet providing the bogies. They were of Bo-Bo wheel arrangement and fitted with CSVT Mk. II engines. The locomotives were fitted with buckeye couplers as standard and had air brake capability for operation with the Mark 2 coaches.

They were visually, mechanically &amp; electrically very similar to the KTMB class 22 (Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad - Malaysian Railways) locomotives built by English Electric at around the same time, however these had had a Co-Co arrangement and an uprated power unit. A small number are still operated.

The press launch of the new &quot;Enterprise&quot; was held on 3 July 1970 when a special train, carrying invited guests, ran from Great Victoria Street, Belfast to Dublin with two locomotives working the train, one at each end. This was generally well received, however comments were made regarding the train &quot;hunting&quot; due to the second locomotive pushing from the rear.

All three re-use names previously used by the Great Northern Railway Class V locomotives, as follows:

==Replacement==
Towards the end of the 1970s, although only 10 years old, the class were suffering from regular failures in service and they were displaced from the principal passenger workings by the arrival of the NIR 111 Class locomotives. The 101s were cascaded to lesser duties, such as shunting in Adelaide Yard.

All three locomotives progressively withdrawn from service, the first having been stored in 1989 (103) and the last in 1999 (102). After two years out of service, 102 was briefly re-instated as a working locomotive in 2001. This was short-lived as the locomotive was stopped after only one trip, and placed back into storage at Whitehead, County Antrim.

Number 103 was scrapped in 1997. Numbers 101 and 102, however, remained at Whitehead for some time until offered by Translink for sale.

==Preservation==

Translink offered the two inoperable locomotives 101 and 102 for sale after withdrawal. The Railway Preservation Society of Ireland (RPSI) bid for the locomotives, and succeeded in purchasing them. Since both were already located at the RPSI&#x27;s Whitehead site, they did not need to be moved. As it was, neither locomotive would be able to operate until they received a full overhaul to working condition, as the engines had been stopped in the late 1980s-early 1990s and by this time would require remedial work before they could be fired up.

In 2005, number 102 was selected for restoration to working order, while 101 was chosen to be cannibalised for spare parts to restore 102. However, the attempt to restore 102 did not occur because of a series of external issues, and so the locomotive was left in storage in the Whitehead sidings. All openings such as the exhaust outlet were covered over to prevent rainwater ingress from damaging the cylinder heads, but other than covering these openings, no further work was taken. It was hoped in 2008 to move it to the Downpatrick and County Down Railway for restoration, but this too did not come to fruition.

In 2009, a second attempt was made to restore 102 to working order, starting with a brief attempt to get the engine in 102 to turn over. The plan was eventually mothballed, but not before the following was achieved:
* The locomotive&#x27;s batteries were either recharged or replaced (as some were now missing).
* The isolating switch, which had burnt out in 2005, was replaced with that from 101.
* The air filters were replaced with the cleaner ones from 101.
* The oil return valve was cleaned out and adjusted.
* A faulty relay was cleaned to allow the Start Control Contactor to close, allowing the engine to be &#x27;turned over&#x27;.
* Using a 110 V battery charger, the batteries were charged enough to turn the engine briskly.
* A temporary fuel supply was set up using a 5-gallon tank of diesel as the fuel in 102&#x27;s tank had deteriorated due to six years of storage.

The locomotive was successfully fired up for a minute using this temporary fuel supply with two of the eight cylinders firing (only six were considered operational as two cylinders had stuck exhaust valves). This however ended when the vibrations of the engine jarred the temporary external fuel feed out of the temporary fuel tank, starving the engine of fuel and causing it to shut down prematurely. The decision was already made by then to mothball the project, and so the locomotive was returned to long-term storage.

As of 2010, the RPSI website reported that 102 had its leaky roof patched with tarpaulins, and that there were no plans to restart it in the near future. It requires a full overhaul, supposedly much of which relates to the locomotive&#x27;s body, engine, and other associated components. No further work was done to the locomotive until it was sold in late 2011 to the Ulster Folk &amp; Transport Museum.

In January 2012, 102 was transported with fellow UFTM resident CIE 113 Class B113 from Whitehead to Cultra under the cover of night. Although 102 was able to operate, albeit in a limited capacity due to the extent of engine repairs required, neither was mechanically fit enough to make the trip under their own power. The two locomotives were instead hauled by NIR 111 class locomotives 112 &quot;Northern Counties&quot; and 8113 (113) &quot;Belfast &amp; County Down&quot;. Prior to the move, 102 was repainted in its original red with yellow stripe livery.

Locomotive 101 remained in storage at Whitehead, County Antrim, ostensibly as a source of spare parts for 102. Due to pressure for space as a result of the arrival of B(141) class locomotive B142 from Inchicore, attempts were made to seek a buyer for 101. This did not materialise, and it was decided to reluctantly scrap the partially stripped 101 and remove any useful parts for use on 102. The remains of the locomotive were cut up in January 2010.

==Livery==
When delivered the locomotives were painted in an unlined maroon livery with, on the ends, a &quot;flowing V&quot; in a golden yellow colour. The &quot;NIR&quot; logo and numbers were transfers. From 1978 the livery was changed to blue with an orange/red shallow &#x27;V&#x27; stripe on each end ( See photograph above). The first locomotive in the new livery appeared on 3 July. 102 later carried a slightly darker shade of blue with black cab surrounds and yellow end panels.

== Models ==
Accurascale are producing a ready to run OO Gauge model of the locomotive.

<text>A straight-line diagram (abbreviated SLD) is a diagram of a road where the road is shown as a straight line. Such diagrams are usually produced by a highway department, and display features along the road, including bridges and intersecting roads. Rows below the diagram show data about the road, usually including speed limit, number of lanes, bridge numbers, and historical data, among other data. Subway lines also frequently employ straight-line diagrams. An internal SLD viewing system may also include links to other internal data, including photos or plans. Public SLDs are distributed in formats including PDF and TIFF.

Straight-line diagrams were historically used in transportation planning but have been supplanted for these purposes by geographic information systems.

A strip map is a road map laid out similarly to a straight-line diagram, featuring the same details found in more conventional road maps rather than technical details. In the United States, some strip maps are distributed by state highway departments. In Australia, strip maps are distributed by state automobile associations. In the early 20th century, scrolling strip maps were also a component of some forerunners to satellite navigation devices. One wristwatch introduced in 1927 came with strip maps to be scrolled by hand. The 1932 Iter-Avto was a car-mounted device that scrolled the strip map automatically based on dead reckoning with the speedometer.

<text>Alashiya ( &quot;Alašiya&quot; [a-la-ši-ia]; &quot;ẢLṮY&quot;; Linear B: 𐀀𐀨𐀯𐀍 &quot;Alasios&quot; [a-ra-si-jo]; Hieratic &quot;&#x27;irs3&quot;), also spelled Alasiya, also known as the Kingdom of Alashiya, was a state which existed in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, and was situated somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean. It was a major source of goods, especially copper, for ancient Egypt and other states in the Ancient Near East. It is referred to in a number of the surviving texts and is now thought to be the ancient name of Cyprus, or an area of Cyprus. This was confirmed by the scientific analysis performed in Tel Aviv University of the clay tablets which were sent from Alashiya to other rulers.
==History==
The name of the state, rendered as &quot;Alashiya&quot;, is found on texts written in Egyptian, Hittite, Akkadian, Mycenean (Linear B) and Ugaritic. The name may be the origin of the later Biblical term Elishah.

===Hittites===
Around 1400 BC, the Hittite king Arnuwanda I chastised his vassal Madduwatta for raiding Alashiya, asserting that it was Hittite territory. Madduwatta replied that he had been unaware of the Hittite claim:

Although Madduwatta&#x27;s statement can be interpreted as prevarication, no surviving texts from this period refer to Hittite involvement in Alashiya and the empire&#x27;s military situation would have made direct control unlikely. Thus, the political reality behind this statement remains unclear.

Around 1200 BC, the Hittite kings Tudhaliya IV and Suppiluliuma II waged military campaigns in Alashiya and forced its king to sign a treaty of submission.

===Egypt===
Some of the Amarna letters (c. 1350 BC) are from the king or the ministers of Alashiya. They concern mostly the amount of copper that has been sent from Alashiya and requests for silver or ivory in return. One letter refers to 500 talents of copper (probably about 12.5 tons) and makes excuses as to why so little copper has been sent. The Pharaoh is also referred to by the King of Alashiya as his &quot;brother&quot;, indicating that the king regarded himself as an equal, probably because of the economic power of his kingdom. Papyrus Anastasi IV, written several centuries later, also refers to copper (as well as cows) sent from Alashiya to Egypt.

The extant ending of the Story of Wenamun records how Wenamun, a priest of Egypt, had been blown off course on the sea journey from Byblos to Egypt and ended up on Alashiya. Wenamun reports that he was almost killed by an angry mob, but was rescued by Hatbi, the &quot;princess of the town&quot;.

*EA 40; Title: &quot;Duty-Free, Governor to Governor&quot;

===Ugarit===
In other correspondence, the King of Ugarit pleads for military assistance from the King of Alashiya. Another document from Ugarit records the banishment of two princes to &quot;the land of Alashiya&quot;. One further text found at Ugarit may contain a further clue to the location of the capital city of Alashiya, as it could imply that the city was located on a mountain. However, this word has more usually been translated as shore. The first recorded name of a Cypriot king is &quot;Kushmeshusha&quot;, as appears on letters sent to Ugarit in the 13th century BC.

==Identification ==
Alashiya was known to be a regional source of copper for other East Mediterranean states, which it traded along maritime routes of the era. Alashiya therefore needs to be situated somewhere where there was sizable Bronze Age copper production, on the coast, and in the East Mediterranean. There are additional clues to its location in surviving texts including references to the King of Alashiya having ships and to the kingdom being raided by Lukka people.

Some scholars have suggested sites and areas of Syria or Turkey, but it is now generally (although not universally) agreed that Alashiya refers to at least part of Cyprus. Specifically, it was generally argued that the site of Enkomi was the capital of the kingdom of Alashiya, which covered the entire island of Cyprus.

The identification of Cyprus with Alashiya was confirmed by the 2003 publication by Goren et al. of an article in the&quot; American Journal of Archaeology &quot;detailing the petrographic and chemical analysis of a number of the Amarna and Ugaritic letters sent from Alashiya. These examinations of the provenance of the clay used to create the tablets indicate that Syria could not be the location of Alashiya, while clay on Cyprus is a good match.

However, this analysis showed that the clays did not originate anywhere near the site of Enkomi and that suitable clays are close to the sites of Kalavasos and Alassa (itself a possible cognate of Alashiya). These sites, especially Kalavasos, were also important Late Bronze Age sites and are located close to sources of copper.

Moreover, Armstrong argues that there is considerable evidence for regional variation and that there is no evidence for a centralized, island-wide political authority on Cyprus during the Late Bronze Age.

It is therefore currently unclear whether the kingdom of Alashiya comprised the whole of Cyprus, with the capital city moving location (probably starting with Enkomi), or was always sited at Kalavasos, or whether Alashiya comprised only one region of Cyprus.

<text>Francis Goodwin (1784–1835) was an English architect, born in King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk. He trained under J. Coxedge in Kensington, London. He initially designed two churches in King&#x27;s Lynn, followed by nine Commissioners&#x27; churches. He then designed more new churches, and rebuilt or remodelled other churches, for different clients, and also gained commissions for civic and public buildings. Most of his church designs were in Gothic Revival style, while those for civic and public buildings were mainly Neoclassical. Later in his career he became involved in domestic architecture. He also unsuccessfully created many designs for other buildings, such as King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and the new Houses of Parliament. He died suddenly in London, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

<doc id="1258888" wikidata="Q1153094" url="?curid=1258888" title="Sophia University">
<text>Sophia University, (Japanese: 上智大学, &quot;Jōchi Daigaku&quot;; Latin: &quot;Universitas Sedis Sapientiae&quot;) is a private Jesuit research university in Tokyo, Japan. Founded in 1913 by the Jesuits, it was granted university status in 1928, becoming the first Catholic university in Japan. Sophia University has 12,080 undergraduate students and 1,357 postgraduate students. The university has 9 undergraduate faculties and 10 graduate schools, with over 13,900 students in total.

Sophia University is a highly globalised university with international students from 77 countries and exchange agreements with 400 universities in 81 countries. The university attracts many students from across Japan and abroad. As of 2022, foreign students constituted approximately 9% of the student body.

Sophia&#x27;s alumni are commonly referred to as &quot;Sophians&quot;, among whom include the 79th Prime Minister of Japan, Morihiro Hosokawa, several politicians represented in the Japanese National Diet, several foreign statesmen including, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, Mukhriz Mahathir, Li Linsi, and a number of actors and musicians in the Japanese film and music industries.

== Origins of the university name ==
The name of the university is traced to letters of correspondence between two of the three founders of what would become Sophia University, Fr. James Rockliff, SJ and Fr. Hermann Hoffmann, SJ. The Japanese term 上智 (&quot;higher wisdom&quot; or &quot;supreme wisdom&quot;, &quot;Jōchi&quot;) was the equivalent of the Latin word &quot;sapientia,&quot; which means wisdom. According to Catholic Church tradition, the term &quot;sapientia&quot; refers to one of the Church&#x27;s devotional titles for the Blessed Virgin Mary, &quot;the Seat of Wisdom&quot;.

When Joseph Eylenbosch, SJ began teaching Greek at the university in April 1924, he thought that the Japanese term &quot;jōchi&quot; was the equivalent of the Greek term σοφία (&quot;sofia&quot;). Afterwards, the students had proposed that the school be known as Sophia University.

Fr. Hoffmann, SJ, who was serving as University President at that time, initially opposed the proposal. However, he soon accepted the idea and submitted the proposal to Rome for the approval.

The English-language, peer-reviewed academic journal &quot;Monumenta Nipponica&quot;, which was first published in 1938, identified itself as being published by Sophia University. The use of Sophia as the university name then became firmly established in Japan and overseas.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The origins of Sophia University could be traced to 1549 when Saint Francis Xavier, a prominent member and co-founder of the Society of Jesus, arrived in Japan to spread Christianity. In his letters to his fellow Jesuits, he had expressed hopes of establishing a university in Japan.

During the so-called Kirishitan period of Japanese history, the Catholic Church had been responsible for establishing and administering educational institutions in Japan called &quot;Collegios&quot; and &quot;Seminarios&quot;, serving as bridges between the East and West.

The establishment of the university only began to take place more than 400 years from St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s arrival in Japan. In 1903, three Jesuit priests from Europe came to Japan to continue the missionary work of the Church and to help establish Sophia University. One of the founders, Fr. Joseph Dahlmann, SJ from Germany, who had come to Japan via India, had listened to the requests of Catholics in the country, who expressed their desires to construct a Catholic university to serve as the cultural and spiritual base of the Church&#x27;s missionary operations in Japan.

Dahlmann heeded the requests and sent a proposal to the then-Bishop of Rome, Pope Pius X, at the Holy See in Rome. In 1905, Dahlmann was granted a private audience with the Pope, who promised to assign the Society of Jesus to create and administer a Catholic university in Japan. In Dahlmann&#x27;s Latin memoirs regarding the encounter with Pius, he recounted that he spoke as follows: &quot;&quot;Habebitis collegium in Japonica, magnam universitatem&quot; (in English: &quot;You (plural) will have in Japan a college that is a great university&quot;.).

On that same year, the then-Bishop of Portland, Maine in the United States, William H. O&#x27;Connell, was appointed by the Pope to serve as a special ambassador of the Vatican to Emperor Meiji in Japan. O&#x27;Connell was also tasked to survey the situation in Japan. When he was granted an audience with Emperor Meiji, he had ascertained the education policy directions of the Japanese Ministry of Education, and reported to officials at the Holy See regarding the possible establishment of a Catholic university in Japan.

At the 25th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus in held in Rome in September 1906, Pius X issued a formal written statement to the Jesuits to establish a Catholic university in Japan. Thus, the delegates at the Congregation voted unanimously in favour of the Pope&#x27;s commands, and the first concrete steps were taken to prepare a university institution in the East.

=== Founding ===

Sophia University was founded by Jesuits in 1913. It opened with departments of German Literature, Philosophy and Commerce, headed by its founder Fr. Hermann Hoffmann, SJ (1864–1937) as its first official president.

In 1932, a small group of Sophia University students refused to salute the war dead at Yasukuni Shrine in the presence of a Japanese military attache, saying it violated their religious beliefs. The military attache was withdrawn from Sophia as a result of this incident, damaging the university&#x27;s reputation in the eyes of the government of the Japanese Empire. The Archbishop of Tokyo intervened in the standoff by permitting Catholic students to salute the war dead, after which many Sophia students, as well as Hermann Hoffmann himself, participated in rites at Yasukuni. The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples later issued the &quot;Pluries Instanterque&quot; in 1936, which encouraged Catholics to attend Shinto shrines as a patriotic gesture; the Vatican re-issued this document after the war in 1951. Hermann Heuvers served as the university&#x27;s second president from 1937 until 1941.

=== Post-war growth ===
Sophia University continued to grow as it increased the number of academic departments, faculty members and students, in addition to advancing its international focus by establishing an exchange program. Many of its students studied at Georgetown University in the United States as early as 1935. Sophia&#x27;s junior college was established in 1973, followed by the opening of Sophia Community College in 1976.

=== 21st century ===
With the founding of the Faculty of Liberal Arts in 2006, Sophia University presently holds 27 departments in its eight faculties. Its current president is Yoshiaki Terumichi. Toshiaki Koso serves as head of its board of directors. Since 2008, the Global Leadership Program was started for students from four Jesuit universities in East Asia: Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines, Fu Jen Catholic University in Taiwan, Sogang University in South Korea, and Sophia University in Japan. In 2016 the university reached out to the four Jesuit junior-senior high schools in Japan, joining them in the Sophia College Corporation to help them pass on the Jesuit charism to their lay faculty through workshops and other assistance. These schools are Sophia-Fukuoka, Eiko Gakuen, Hiroshima Gakuin, and Rokko School.

In 2019, Pope Francis visited Sophia University as a part of his 2019 pastoral tour. This was the first time in 38 years that a pope visited Sophia University.

== Campuses ==
Sophia&#x27;s main campus at Yotsuya is urban, consisting of roughly 25 large, modern buildings in the center of Tokyo. The majority of Sophia&#x27;s 10,000 undergraduate students spend nearly all their time here. The faculties of Theology, Humanities, Law, Foreign Studies, Economics, Liberal Arts, and Science and Technology have their home here, as do the main library, cafeteria, gymnasium, chapel, bookstore, and offices. In April 2006, the Faculty of Comparative Culture, which had been located at the smaller Ichigaya campus, moved to the main Yotsuya campus and changed its name to the Faculty of Liberal Arts. Nearly all of Sophia&#x27;s foreign exchange and most of international students study at the FLA.

Students of Department of Nursing, Faculty of Human Sciences, starting from their second year, and students of the Course of Midwifery, commute to Mejiro Seibo campus at Shinjuku. Mejiro Seibo campus was originally the campus of Seibo College, before it merged with Sophia University, and the department has retained connection to the nearby Seibo Hospital.

<text>The River Leven (pron. ) is a short river in the ceremonial county of Cumbria, falling within the historic boundaries of Lancashire. It drains Windermere from its southernmost point and flows for approximately into the northern reaches of Morecambe Bay. The river and its estuary are the boundary between the Cartmel Peninsula and Furness Peninsula and is part of North Lonsdale, also known as Lancashire North of the Sands.

The upriver limit of tidal flow is close to the village of Haverthwaite. Also at this point is to be found Low Wood Bridge which, until the coming of the railways, was the first bridging point across the river. The Leven is navigable upstream as far as Low Wood, and downstream from Windermere to Newby Bridge.

Apart from Newby Bridge and Haverthwaite, the only other settlements on the Leven are the villages of Backbarrow and Greenodd. The river&#x27;s steep fall around Backbarrow allowed industrial use of the river for the ultramarine mill and also a small hydroelectric generator at Backbarrow ironworks.

The River Leven has one significant tributary, Rusland Pool, which drains a substantial part of Grizedale Forest and the Rusland Valley into the upper tidal section of the river. The Leven is a noted salmon river. At spawning time the fish can be seen jumping up the waterfalls at Backbarrow. The river is popular with kayakers due to the continuous grade III+ rapids found between Newby Bridge and Haverthwaite and a relatively stable water level sustained by Windermere.

In 1903 a train crossing the railway bridge over the river was derailed by high winds during the Ulysses Storm.

The Leven Estuary is one of the six main estuaries in the traditional county of Lancashire.

<text>Richmond Pearson Hobson Jr. (November 27, 1907 – August 9, 1966) was an American-Canadian author who wrote memoirs of his life as a rancher in British Columbia. His books, &quot;Grass Beyond the Mountains&quot;, &quot;Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy&quot; and &quot;The Rancher Takes a Wife&quot;, inspired the CBC drama series &quot;Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Washington, D.C., in 1907, he was the son of Grizelda Houston Hull Hobson and Richmond Pearson Hobson. His father was a congressman, a U.S. Navy admiral and a decorated veteran of the Spanish–American War. Hobson attended Stanford University before moving to Wyoming and forming a partnership with Panhandle &quot;Pan&quot; Phillips. The pair traveled north to British Columbia in the early 1930s, formed the Frontier Cattle Company and established Home Ranch north of Anahim Lake in the Chilcotin. When his partnership with Phillips ended in the 1940s, Hobson moved to the Vanderhoof area and continued ranching. He and his wife Gloria (1921–1986) lived on River Ranch, south of Vanderhoof. He died there in 1966.

Hobson&#x27;s first book, &quot;Grass Beyond the Mountains&quot; (1951), recalled his early years in British Columbia and the hardships he and Phillips endured in establishing their ranch. It was first published in serial form by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine. The next volume, &quot;Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy&quot; (1955), covered the difficulties of maintaining the ranch during the shortages caused by World War II. His final book, &quot;The Rancher Takes a Wife&quot; (1961), detailed his life as a married rancher in Vanderhoof. 

He died August 8, 1966, from a coronary attack.

<text>Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy is a Canadian television drama series, which aired on CBC from 1998 to 2000. The series, which is set in the 1940s, was based on the memoirs of author and rancher Richmond P. Hobson, Jr. and set on a ranch in rural northern British Columbia.

The series began with a 1998 television film pilot directed by Kari Skogland, starring Chad Willett in the title role as Hobson, Sarah Chalke as his love interest and later wife Gloria McIntosh and Ted Atherton as his friend and business partner Panhandle Phillips, as well as Zachary Bennett, Robin Brûlé and Ryan Gosling in supporting roles. It then premiered as a weekly series in February 1999, with Yannick Bisson replacing Willett as Hobson while Chalke and Atherton continued to play the same roles. The series aired nine episodes in the winter and spring of 1999; although thirteen had been produced, the network&#x27;s programming schedule was disrupted in the spring by a technician&#x27;s strike which resulted in the season ending earlier than planned.

The series was renewed for a second season; it aired seventeen episodes, including the four leftover episodes from the first season and thirteen new episodes, between October 1999 and February 2000. The second season initially saw a significant ratings dropoff from the first, to which the CBC responded by scheduling one episode for a special airing in a prime family viewing spot on Sunday evening; the special airing doubled the ratings of the season&#x27;s previous episodes and the show&#x27;s ratings improved significantly in its regular time slot for the rest of the season.

The series was not renewed for a third season.

==Awards==
The television film received a Gemini Award nomination to Danny Nowak for Best Photography in a Drama Program or Series at the 13th Gemini Awards in 1998.

At the 14th Gemini Awards in 1999, Sarah Strange received a nomination for Guest Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series, for the episode &quot;Wild Horses&quot;, and Lorraine Carson received a nomination for Best Costume Design.

At the 15th Gemini Awards in 2000, Atherton was nominated for Best Actor in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role and Chalke was nominated for Best Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role.

<doc id="1258941" wikidata="Q13479570" url="?curid=1258941" title="Whiteprint">
<text>Whiteprint describes a document reproduction produced by using the diazo chemical process. It is also known as the blue-line process since the result is blue lines on a white background. It is a contact printing process that accurately reproduces the original in size, but cannot reproduce continuous tones or colors. The light sensitivity of the chemicals used was known in the 1890s and several related printing processes were patented at that time. Whiteprinting replaced the blueprint process for reproducing architectural and engineering drawings because the process was simpler and involved fewer toxic chemicals. A blue-line print is not permanent and will fade if exposed to light for weeks or months, but a drawing print that lasts only a few months is sufficient for many purposes.

==The diazo printing process==

Two components underpin diazo printing:
# diazonium salt: a light-sensitive chemical
# the coupler: a colorless chemical that combines with the salt to produce color.

In a related sense, the process relies on two properties of diazonium compounds:
# they are deactivated by light, i.e. they degrade irreversibly to products that cannot form deeply colored dyes
# they (the diazonium compounds that were not degraded by light) react with a (colorless) coupling agent to give the deeply colored product(s)

In a variety of combinations and strengths, these two chemicals are mixed in water and coated onto paper. The resulting coating is then dried yielding the specially treated paper commercially sold as Diazo paper. This solution can also be applied to polyester film or to vellum.

The process starts with original documents that have been created on a translucent medium. Such media include polyester films, vellums, linens, and translucent bond papers (bonds). Any medium that allows some light to pass through typically works as a master; the desired durability of the master determines the choice. Depending on the thickness and type of the master, the intensity of the UV exposure light is adjusted according to media types commonly used for masters in any particular shop. Similarly, the speed control (for setting the speed at which the sheets are pulled through the machine) is likewise typically pre-marked in any particular shop, having been optimized based on trial runs.

The original document is laid on top of the chemically-coated side of a sheet of diazo paper, which is retrieved from a light-protected flat file, and the two sheets are fed into the diazo duplicator, being pulled into the machine by rotating rubber friction wheels. There are two chambers inside the machine. The first is the exposure area, where the sandwich of the two sheets (the master and the diazo paper) passes in front of an ultraviolet lamp. Ultraviolet light penetrates the original and neutralizes the light-sensitive diazonium salt wherever there is no image on the master. These areas become the white areas on the copy. Once this process is complete, the undeveloped image at the locations where the UV light could not penetrate can often be seen as very light yellow or white marks/lines on the diazo sheet. This completes the exposure phase.

Next, the original is peeled from the diazo paper as the sandwich of master and diazo exits the machine, and the diazo sheet alone is fed into the developing chamber. Here, fumes of ammonium hydroxide create an extremely alkaline environment. Under these conditions, the azodyes (couplers) react with the remaining diazonium salt and undergo a chemical reaction that results in the unexposed lines changing color from invisible (or yellow) to a visible dark color. The range of colors for these lines is usually blue or black, but sepia (a brownish hue) is also quite popular. When making multiple copies of an original no more than four or five copies can typically be made at a time, due to the build-up of ammonia fumes, even with ventilation fans in the duplication room. A slight delay of perhaps five minutes is often required for the fumes to subside enough to permit making additional copies if no ventilation exists. Many blueprint shops ran ventilation ducts from the machines to the outside. Smaller and mid-size blueprint machines were often outfitted with neutralizers which absorbed some of the ammonia for some time.

If the lines are too light, it is also possible to run the blue line through the developing chamber once more, which often increases the contrast of the lines relative to the base media. Repeated lack of contrast and light prints is also a tip-off that the operator needs to adjust the speed or amount of ammonia. Sometimes both the master and the diazo print are inadvertently fed through the developing chamber together. If this occurs, one simply peels the master from the diazo paper and runs the diazo sheet through the developer once more to fully develop the lines.

Diazo printing was one of the most economical methods to reproduce large engineering and architectural drawings.

==Fading prints==
A quirk of diazo blueline prints is that with continued exposure to ultraviolet light, either from natural sunlight or from typical office fluorescent lighting, a blueline copy can fade over months (indoors) or just days (outdoors), becoming illegible. This fading process thus requires reduplication of the original documents every few months in a typical office for any project using bluelines. Hence, blueline drawings that are used as engineering working copy prints have to be protected when not in use by storing them in flat files in the dark. Incandescent lighting was often used in areas where blueline engineering prints needed to be posted on a wall for long periods to hinder rapid fading.

Improperly exposed bluelines are more likely to fade at an increased rate since the chemical reaction in the ammonia phase continues until the process is completed. But also properly exposed bluelines should not be exposed to the elements, and bluelines kept in flat files or hanging on racks in a cool, dry room often retain the majority of their lines and can be subsequently scanned into a digital format for various purposes.

==Demise of the technology==
The blueline print process was largely abandoned within the architectural/engineering community around the early 2000s. Contributing factors were the development of computer-aided drafting and printing, the speed of machine printing, and the introduction of larger xerographic machines or large format printers from companies like Ricoh and Xerox. The cost of blueline production materials and equipment, the fact that the prints themselves faded in sunlight, and the need to use the pungent chemical ammonia as a developer sped up its replacement.

<text>Rushing to Paradise is a novel by British author J. G. Ballard, first published in 1994.

The novel relates the fictional tale of a small and eccentric group of environmentalists attempting to save the albatross on the Pacific island of St. Esprit from nuclear tests by the French government.

== Plot summary ==

Dr. Barbara is a disgraced doctor who forms a small band of environmentalists to attempt to save the albatross from nuclear testing by the French government on the remote Pacific island of St. Esprit. Neil, a naïve 16-year-old, joins the group and the story is told from his perspective.

During an illegal landing on the island, Neil is caught on film being shot in the foot by a French soldier. The subsequent news coverage makes Neil, and their environmental campaign, media celebrities. This allows a return visit to the island with a larger and more eccentric group of campaigners.

Whilst attempting to land, a French navy frigate collides with their boat. This event is broadcast live to the world by the cameraman who dies in the collision. The subsequent adverse news coverage causes the French to leave the campaigners unmolested on the island.

The coverage also leads to a deluge of gifts from well wishers all over the world, a steady stream of visitors and a growing collection of endangered animals which are meant to use the island as sanctuary.

Visitors include a representative from Club Med who investigates whether the island can be turned into a resort.

These excesses cause Dr. Barbara to manipulate Neil and other residents to commit ever greater acts of sabotage to cut themselves off from the outside world. Gradually, the male residents of the island (except Neil) become ill and slowly die under the &#x27;care&#x27; of Dr. Barbara. As fewer able bodied residents are left, the endangered animals they are supposed to be saving are killed and eaten.

Slowly, Neil realises that his role is to father as many children as possible from the female residents. As more visitors arrive on the island, the female members stay and the male members disappear. When another young man arrives on the island, Neil&#x27;s role as stud is in jeopardy and he too becomes ill whilst the new arrival is kept healthy.

Slowly, over the course of the story, the environmentalists change from being the sane ones in an insane world into total insanity as Dr. Barbara&#x27;s all female &#x27;paradise&#x27; is constructed.

Neil and the remaining residents are rescued in the nick of time by the French navy, after a couple who only just manage to escape alert the authorities to what is really happening on the island.

<doc id="1258963" wikidata="Q152331" url="?curid=1258963" title="Roer">
<text>The Roer (, ) or Rur (; ) is a major river that flows through portions of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. It is a right (eastern) tributary to the Meuse (). About 90 percent of the river&#x27;s course is in Germany.

It is not to be confused with the rivers Ruhr and Röhr, which are tributaries of the Rhine in North Rhine-Westphalia.

==History==
During the Middle Ages the valley of the Roer lay mostly within the Duchy of Jülich. In 1795, until 1814, during which time the area was part of the French Republic and Empire, it gave its name to the French &quot;département&quot; of the Roer.

The Roer represented an important front in the Allied push towards Germany at the end of the Second World War. A fortified area known as the Roer Triangle, formed by the towns of Roermond and Sittard, in the Netherlands, and Heinsberg in Germany, was the scene of heavy fighting at the beginning of 1945.

Operation Blackcock was the code name for the clearing of the Roer Triangle. It was conducted by the 2nd British Army between 14 and 26 January 1945. The objective was to drive the German 15th Army back across the Rivers Roer and Wurm and move the frontline further into Germany. The operation was carried out under command of the XII Corps by three divisions. The operation is relatively unknown despite the sometimes fierce battles that were fought for each and every village and hamlet within the &quot;Roer Triangle&quot;.

Between 16 December 1944 and 23 February 1945, the U.S. Ninth Army was unable to advance across the Roer during Operation Queen, because German forces controlled dams close to the river&#x27;s source in the densely forested region of the Hohes Venn. This meant Axis forces could potentially blow the dams, releasing enough water to wash out an Allied assault. At the same time, the German Ardennes Offensive meant any further westward push would leave Allied forces stretched and supply lines exposed. Eventually the counteroffensive was overwhelmed and German engineers, under pressure of aerial and artillery bombardment, released the dams. As the flood waters began to subside, Allied forces crossed the Rur in rafts in the early hours of February 23, 1945, as part of Operation Grenade.

==Geography==
The Roer rises in the High Fens, near the high Signal de Botrange in Belgium at an elevation of above sea level. South of Monschau it flows into Germany, through North Rhine-Westphalia. It flows first through the northern part of the Eifel mountains.

After it reaches the Roer Reservoir, the second-largest artificial lake in Germany. After approximately it flows into the Netherlands, and at its mark it flows into the river Meuse in the city of Roermond.

Major tributaries of the Roer include the Inde and the Wurm. The towns along the Roer are Monschau, Heimbach, Nideggen, Düren, Jülich, Linnich, Hückelhoven, Heinsberg (all in Germany) and Roermond (Netherlands).

In the 1960s and 1970s, the northern part of the Roer was heavily polluted by the tailings of many German coal mines. Neither fish nor other organisms could be found, and it was dangerous to swim in the river. Foam flakes regularly flooded parts of the city of Roermond. After the closure of the mines, the waste water treatment in Germany and the Netherlands greatly improved. Only the lower part of the river is still contaminated. The water in the upper part of the river is so clean that trout and more than 30 species of fish are back. After an absence of 125 years, salmon returned to the Roer in 2004.

===Tributaries===
* Ellebach
* Inde
* Kall
* Malefinkbach
* Merzbach
* Wurm
* Olef
* Urft

==Recreation==
The Roer is the only real white water river in North Rhine-Westphalia. The upper section above the Roer reservoir (German: Rurtalsperre Schwammenauel) offers of white water ranging from class III(+) to I. The town of Monschau is the venue for the yearly International White Water Race which was held on 17 March 2013 for the 58th time.

<text>The Grumman G-44 Widgeon is a five-person, twin-engined, amphibious aircraft. It was designated J4F by the United States Navy and Coast Guard and OA-14 by the United States Army Air Corps and United States Army Air Forces.

==Design and development==
The Widgeon was originally designed for the civil market. It is smaller, but otherwise similar to Grumman&#x27;s earlier G-21 Goose, and was produced from 1941 to 1955. The aircraft was used during World War II as a small patrol and utility machine by the US Navy, US Coast Guard, and Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm.

The first prototype flew in 1940, and the first production aircraft went to the US Navy as an antisubmarine aircraft. In total, 276 were built by Grumman, including 176 for the military. During World War II, they served with the US Navy, Coast Guard, Civil Air Patrol, and Army Air Force, as well as with the British Royal Navy, which gave it the service name Gosling.

==Operational history==
===United States Coast Guard===
On August 1, 1942, a J4F-1 flown by US Coast Guard Patrol Squadron 212 based out of Houma, Louisiana, and flown by Chief Aviation Pilot Henry White, spotted and attacked a German U-boat off the coast of Louisiana. White reported the submarine sunk, and he was subsequently credited with sinking and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

However, in June 2001 the wreck of &quot;U-166&quot; was found sitting near the wreck of SS &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; by an oil exploration team; and the sinking of &quot;U-166&quot; on July 30 (i.e. two days before the Widgeon flight) is now credited to patrol craft &quot;PC-566&quot; escorting the &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot;.

White&#x27;s Widgeon is now thought to have made an unsuccessful attack against , a Type IXC U-boat identical to &quot;U-166&quot; that reported an air attack coincident with White&#x27;s attack. &quot;U-171&quot; was undamaged by White&#x27;s attack, but was sunk four months later in the Bay of Biscay.

===Civil Air Patrol===
The sinking of a German U-boat by the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) was claimed by one of their larger aircraft on 11 July 1942. The Grumman G-44 Widgeon, armed with two depth charges and crewed by Captain Johnny Haggins and Major Wynant Farr, was scrambled when another CAP patrol radioed that they had encountered an enemy submarine, but were returning to base due to low fuel. After scanning the area, Farr spotted the U-boat cruising beneath the surface of the waves. Unable to accurately determine the depth of the vessel, Haggins and Ferr radioed the situation back to base and followed the enemy in hopes that it would rise to periscope depth. For three hours, the crew shadowed the submarine. Just as Haggins was about to return to base, the U-boat rose to periscope depth, and Haggins swung the aircraft around, aligned with the submarine and dove to . Farr released one of the two depth charges, blowing the submarine&#x27;s front out of the water. As it left an oil slick, Farr made a second pass and released the other charge. Debris appeared on the ocean&#x27;s surface, confirming the U-boat&#x27;s demise and the CAP&#x27;s first kill.

===Postwar operations===
After the war, Grumman redesigned the aircraft to make it more suitable for civilian operations. A new hull improved its water handling, and six seats were installed. In total, 76 of the new G-44As were built by Grumman, the last being delivered on January 13, 1949. Another 41 were produced under license by the (SCAN) in La Rochelle, France, as the SCAN 30. Most of these ended up in the United States.

McKinnon Enterprises at Sandy, Oregon, converted over 70 Widgeons to &quot;Super Widgeons&quot;. The conversion features replacing the engines with Avco Lycoming GO-480-B1D flat-six piston engines, and various other modifications, including modern avionics, three-bladed propellers, larger windows, improved soundproofing, emergency exits, and increased maximum takeoff weight. Retractable wingtip floats were optional.

<doc id="1258972" wikidata="Q7725" url="?curid=1258972" title="Evening">
<text>Evening is the period of a day that begins at the end of daylight and overlaps with the beginning of night. It generally indicates the period of time when the sun is close to the horizon and comprises the periods of civil, nautical and astronomical twilight. The exact times when evening begins and ends are subjective and depend on location and time of year. It may be used colloquially to include the last waning daytime shortly before sunset. 

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the Old English &quot;ǣfnung&quot;, meaning &#x27;the coming of evening, sunset, time around sunset&#x27;, which originated from &quot;æfnian&quot;, meaning &quot;become evening, grow toward evening&quot;. The Old English &quot;æfnian&quot; originated from &quot;æfen&quot; (eve), which meant &quot;the time between sunset and darkness&quot;, and was synonymous with even (Old English &quot;æfen&quot;), which meant the end of the day. The use of &quot;evening&quot; dates from the mid 15th century.

==Start time==
The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; defines evening as varying according to daylight and lifestyle, but says that many people consider it to begin at 5 p.m.

In a social context, the Oxford English Dictionary defines evening as &quot;the time from about 6 p.m., or sunset if earlier&quot;.

As such, there is no fixed consensus on when the period of evening starts.

== Astronomy ==
Despite the less favorable lighting conditions for optical astronomy, evening can be useful for observing objects orbiting close to the Sun. Evening (and morning) serves as the optimum time for viewing the inferior planets Venus and Mercury. It is a popular time to hunt for comets, as their tails grow more prominent as these objects draw closer to the Sun. The evening (and morning) twilight is used to search for near-Earth asteroids that orbit inside the orbit of the Earth. In mid-latitudes, spring evenings around the time of the equinox―that is, the March one in the Northern Hemisphere and the September equinox to the south of the equator―are favorable for viewing the zodiacal light.
