<text>E. Maurice &quot;Buddy&quot; Adler (June 22, 1906 – July 12, 1960) was an American film producer and production head for 20th Century Fox studios.

In 1954, his production of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture and in 1956, his &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot; was nominated for best picture. Adler also produced the 1956 film &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, starring Marilyn Monroe.

==Biography==
Adler was born in New York City in 1906 (some references have listed his birth year as 1908 or 1909) with &quot;Buddy&quot; as his childhood nickname. His family ran a small chain of department stores and Adler did advertising copy for the chain. He began writing short stories in his spare time and published them under the name &quot;Bradley Allen&quot;. In 1936 he moved to Hollywood where he wrote the Pete Smith short features for MGM. He wrote the screenplay for the short documentary film &quot;Quicker&#x27;n a Wink&quot;, which won an Oscar in 1940. He also owned a small string of movie showhouses, called the Hitching Post.

During World War II, Adler served in the Signal Corps (1941–1945), ending with the rank of colonel. 

In 1954 Alder moved from Columbia to Fox, where he produced several films. 

===Head of Fox===
In 1956 Adler was named as Head of Production for 20th Century Fox, replacing Darryl F. Zanuck, and in 1957, he established the Fox Talent School, with a $1 million budget. Actors who had their first starring roles under Adler include Elvis Presley, Pat Boone, Tommy Sands, Fabian, Stuart Whitman, Suzy Parker, Joanne Woodward, France Nuyen, May Britt, Bradford Dillman, Tony Randall, Barry Coe, and Diane Varsi.

==Personal life==
Adler was born in New York City. He moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1936 and resided there for the rest of his life. In 1940 he married actress Anita Louise Fremault (1915–1970), with whom he had two children. The family were at his bedside when he died in 1960, from lung cancer.
Joan Collins told a story on The Graham Norton Show about a party where Adler asked Joan if she would like her pick of roles from upcoming Fox productions, and she said yes. He then told her that although he was older than her and married, if she was &quot;nice&quot; to him, he could do that for her. She rebuffed him and said that she was not interested in using the casting couch to get ahead in her career.

==Awards==
Adler received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1957. In 1958 he received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in motion pictures.

==Death==
On July 12, 1960, Adler died of lung cancer, aged 54, in Los Angeles and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. His widow, who is buried there as well, survived him by ten years.

<text>Majekodunmi Fasheke, popularly known as Majek Fashek (March 1963 – 1 June 2020) was a Nigerian singer-songwriter and guitarist. His 1988 album &quot;Prisoner of Conscience&quot; included the single &quot;Send Down the Rain&quot;, which won six PMAN Music Awards. Also known as The Rainmaker, he worked with various artists worldwide including Tracy Chapman, Jimmy Cliff, Michael Jackson, Snoop Dogg, and Beyoncé

==Early life==
Fashek was born in Benin City to an Edo mother and an Ijesa father in 1963, but identified mainly with his Benin roots. Various translations of his name Fasheke (Ifá à ṣe èké) include &quot;powers of miracles&quot; and &quot;divination does not lie&quot;, however, it refers to the orisha (deity) Ifa (deity of divination) of the Yoruba religion and means &quot;Ifa does not lie/deceive.&quot; After his parents separated, Fashek remained in Benin City with his mother, and later joined the choir in his local &quot;Aladura&quot; church where he learned to play the trumpet and guitar whilst composing songs for the choir.

==Musical career==
===Early 80&#x27;s: Jah Stix===
In the early eighties Fashek, who at the time went by the stage name Rajesh Kanal, joined the group Jah Stix with musicians Amos McRoy Gregg and Black Rice. The trio soon gained popularity as the in-house band on the NTA Benin show &quot;Music Panorama&quot;, and toured with fellow reggae group The Mandators (fronted by Victor Essiet). Jah Stix were also session musicians for up and coming reggae singer Edi Rasta, who would later be known as Evi-Edna Ogholi.

===1987–1990: &quot;Prisoner of Conscience&quot; and &quot;I&amp;I Experience&quot;===
In 1987, shortly after Jah Stix disbanded, Fashek, who now used the name Majek Fashek, signed with Tabansi Records and began a solo career, releasing the album &quot;Prisoner of Conscience&quot; and quickly becoming Nigeria&#x27;s top reggae artist after the song &quot;Send Down The Rain&quot; became the most popular song of the year. In 1989, he won six PMAN awards for &quot;Song of the Year&quot;, &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Reggae Artist of the Year&quot; among others. Fashek&#x27;s next album, &quot;I&amp;I Experience&quot;, was released in late 1989 under the Tabansi Label and included the anti-apartheid anthem &quot;Free Africa, Free Mandela&quot; which sampled Steam&#x27;s &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot;.

===1991: &quot;So Long Too Long&quot; and American invasion===
After leaving Tabansi Records, Fashek was signed to CBS Nigeria in the early 1990s and released &quot;So Long Too Long&quot;. It was included on Putumayo World Music&#x27;s first album. In 1990 he was signed to Interscope Records and released the critically acclaimed album &quot;Spirit Of Love&quot;, produced by &quot;Little Steven&quot; Van Zandt. In 1992, he appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in support of his new 1991 album, and performed the song &quot;So Long Too Long&quot; for the television audience.
Flame Tree released &quot;The Best of Majek Fashek&quot; in 1994. He was later dropped by Interscope before moving to Mango, a division of Island Records accustomed to marketing reggae internationally. His first album for the company included a cover version of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Redemption Song&quot;. He has recorded several albums for various labels since, including &quot;Rainmaker&quot; for Tuff Gong (1997) and &quot;Little Patience&quot; for Coral (2004).

==Musical style==
Fashek&#x27;s musical influences include Bob Marley – whom he resembled vocally – Jimi Hendrix, and Fela Kuti. He was one of the original Nigerian artists drawn to Caribbean music, specifically reggae, rather than indigenous hybrids such as fuji, jùjú, but was known to mix these genres to create his own style he called &quot;kpangolo&quot;, and the song &quot;My Guitar&quot;, an ode to his favourite instrument, was heavily influenced by rock.

==Other works==
Fashek had a supporting role in the 1999 Nollywood movie &quot;Mark of the Beast&quot;, and starred in a commercial for the non-alcoholic beverage Diamalt. In 2016 he performed to audience of over 10,000 people in a comedy show hosted by Ayo Makun in Eko Hotel Hall, Lagos.

In November 2016 Fashek contributed the song &quot;We Are Not Afraid&quot; to a video directed by former 10CC member Kevin Godley featuring over 200 celebrities including 53 members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to raise funds for the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Human Rights Watch (HRW).

==Personal life==
Fashek was married to Rita Fashek who inspired the song &quot;Without You&quot;; the couple had four children together, but later divorced. In 2015, it was revealed that Fashek was bankrupt and battling drug addiction. After admitting that he needed help, he was admitted into a drug rehabilitation centre in Abuja, where he recovered and returned to music.

==Death==
Besides his struggle with drug addiction, other health conditions required Fashek&#x27;s hospitalisation on several occasions. He was rumored dead in September 2019 but his manager quelled the rumors, confirming that Fashek had indeed been critically ill, hospitalized at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London in the UK, and in dire need of financial assistance. Billionaire businessman and philanthropist Femi Otedola pledged to cover all the singer&#x27;s medical expenses.

Fashek died in his sleep on 1 June 2020 in New York City. He was 57, and was battling esophageal cancer.

<text>Peter Herman Adler (2 December 1899, Gablonz an der Neiße, Bohemia – 2 October 1990, Ridgefield, Connecticut) was an American conductor born in Austria-Hungary in Gablonz an der Neiße, which is now in the Czech Republic.

==Career==
While at the Prague Conservatory, Adler studied with Vítězslav Novák, Fidelio Finke, and Alexander von Zemlinsky. He was the music and artistic director of the NBC Opera Theatre (1950–64) and the National Educational Television Opera. He was a pioneer of televised broadcast of opera, commissioning such works as Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot; and &quot;Maria Golovin&quot;, Norman Dello Joio&#x27;s &quot;The Trial at Rouen&quot;, and Bohuslav Martinů&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage&quot;; Jack Beeson&#x27;s &quot;My Heart&#x27;s in the Highlands&quot;, Thomas Pasatieri&#x27;s &quot;The Trial of Mary Lincoln&quot; and Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s &quot;La Cubana&quot;. Adler was also involved in the early career development of such singers as Leontyne Price, George London and Mario Lanza. He later conducted the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra from 1959 to 1968. He conducted the United States premiere of Ernst Bloch&#x27;s opera &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Juilliard School in May 1973.

<text>America Georgina Ferrera (; born April 18, 1984) is an American actress, director and television producer. She has received numerous accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award, in addition to a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2007 and 2024, &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world and in 2023, she was named in BBC&#x27;s 100 Women list.

Ferrera developed an interest in acting at a young age, performing in several stage productions at her school. She made her feature film debut in 2002 with the comedy-drama &quot;Real Women Have Curves&quot;, earning praise for her performance. She achieved modest success early in her career with roles in films such as the comedy-dramas &quot;Gotta Kick It Up!&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&quot; (2005). She garnered further critical acclaim and recognition for her starring role as Betty Suarez in the ABC comedy-drama series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; (2006–2010). For her performance, she won a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, the first for a Latina woman in the category.

Ferrera&#x27;s other film roles include the drama &quot;The Dry Land&quot; (2010), the romantic comedy &quot;Our Family Wedding&quot; (2010), the crime drama &quot;End of Watch&quot; (2012), and the fantasy comedy &quot;Barbie&quot; (2023), which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also voiced Astrid Hofferson in the &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; franchise (2010–2019) and co-produced and starred in the NBC workplace comedy series &quot;Superstore&quot; (2015–2021).

==Early life and education==
Ferrera, the youngest of six children, was born in Los Angeles, California. Her parents, América Griselda Ayes and Carlos Gregorio Ferrera, were originally from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and immigrated to the United States in the mid-1970s. Ferrera has stated that she has Lenca ancestry. Her mother worked as the director of the housekeeping staff for one of the Hilton Hotels, and stressed the importance of higher education. When Ferrera was seven, her parents divorced and her father returned to Honduras. Ferrera was estranged from her father when he died there in 2010.

Ferrera was raised in the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles, where she attended Calabash Street Elementary School, George Ellery Hale Middle School and El Camino Real High School. At age seven she played a small role in a school production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and when she was 10 she played the Artful Dodger in &quot;Oliver!&quot;.

While at El Camino High School, she took acting lessons. She entered the University of Southern California (USC) on a presidential scholarship, double-majoring in theatre and international relations. She dropped out to focus on her acting career, but completed her bachelor&#x27;s degree in May 2013.

==Career==
===Debut and early roles (2002–2005)===
In July 2002, Ferrera appeared in her first television film, &quot;Gotta Kick It Up!&quot; for The Disney Channel. While at a theatre program at Northwestern University that same year, she made her feature movie debut in &quot;Real Women Have Curves&quot;. Ferrera followed this with roles in television (&quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;). She also appeared in the movie &quot;Plainsong&quot;, based on the novel by Kent Haruf, which also featured Aidan Quinn and Rachel Griffiths. Ferrera played a pregnant teenager, Victoria Roubideaux, who has been kicked out of her mother&#x27;s house; she is taken in by two kindly brothers who live alone on a farm. In the 2005 film &quot;How the Garcia Girls Spent Their Summer&quot;, she starred as Bianca, a 17-year-old third-generation Mexican-American who is disgusted with the boys in her neighborhood but finds romance with a boy from a neighboring town. In 2006, she appeared in the short film &quot;3:52&quot;, which won the Audience Award at the San Diego Women Film Festival. Later that year, she featured in the movie &quot;Steel City&quot;, which received nominations at the Film Independent Spirit Awards and the Sundance Film Festival. In December 2005, she appeared in the Off-Broadway play &quot;Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead&quot;, directed by Trip Cullman.

===Breakthrough and rise to fame (2006–2010)===

In 2006, Ferrera landed the lead role of Betty Suarez in ABC&#x27;s new comedy-drama &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, an adaptation of the successful Colombian telenovela &quot;Yo soy Betty, la fea&quot; (1999–2001), in which Ferrera portrays a girl whom her peers find extremely unattractive, thus the series title. As Betty Suarez, Ferrera wears braces, has bushy eyebrows and a disheveled wig, and cosmetics and clothing intended to downplay her own looks, in contrast to most of the &quot;glammed up&quot; characters; Ferrera invented the term &quot;Bettification&quot; to describe the process of creating her onscreen persona. In 2007, Ferrera won numerous accolades for her performance in the series; she also won the &quot;triple crown&quot; for acting in television; she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series, and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, becoming the first Latina woman to win the Outstanding Lead Actress Award.

In the wake of her Golden Globe win, Ferrera was congratulated by Hilda L. Solis in the United States House of Representatives and was commended for &quot;helping to break down stereotypes and provide a role model for young Latinas&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; included Ferrera in their 2007 list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Also in 2007, Ferrera won the Imagen Foundation&#x27;s Creative Achievement Award. Ferrera starred as Carmen in the 2005 film &quot;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&quot;, and reprised the role in 2008&#x27;s &quot;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2&quot;.

<text>Sucé-sur-Erdre (, literally &quot;Sucé on Erdre&quot;; ) is a commune in the Loire-Atlantique department in western France.

Its name comes from the Latin &quot;sulcus&quot;, meaning &quot;furrow&quot;, and the Celtic &quot;erdam&quot;, meaning &quot;small river&quot;.

Sucé-sur-Erdre, as its name indicates, is located on the river Erdre, which at this point is near its confluence with the Loire. The town was fairly small (2,000 or so) for quite some time until it began to be absorbed into the greater suburbia of Nantes. As of 2019, it has about 7,200 inhabitants, a significant portion of which commute to Nantes. In general, the area is middle-class with a good portion of upper-middle class and upper-class homes, especially on the river banks.

Sucé-sur-Erdre is relatively well known in the area for its scenic river landscapes, and its many water sports opportunities, including fishing, sailing, windsurfing in Mazerolles (Funboard44), kayaking, and water skiing. It has essentially no industry, the main employer is a large convalescence home. There are many shops (butcher, baker, etc...) and one small supermarket.

Sucé-sur-Erdre has had few encounters with history, its greatest claim to fame being that the famous philosopher René Descartes spent some time there (although this is not very well documented). It has a few old houses, but the church is modern (late nineteenth century. There are many picturesque farm houses in the area, although they are disappearing quickly due to the accelerated modernization brought by the expansion of Nantes.

==Population==

The inhabitants of Sucé-sur-Erdre are called &quot;Sucéens&quot;.

<text>Las Qoray (, ) is a historic coastal town in the Sanaag region of Somaliland. It had the biggest factory of producing tuna fish since 1991. 

BBC reported in 2021, &quot;The Navy or Somaliland Coast Guard is one of the military departments of Somaliland, operating on the coast of Somaliland in Las Qoray, Zeila and Berbera.&quot; Somaliland National TV (SLNTV) reported in its September 2023 broadcast that Las Koray is a territory of Somaliland. Hiiraan Online reported in a January 2024 article, &quot;Las Qoray is outside Hargeisa&#x27;s control.&quot; Andrew Palmer, CEO of the maritime consultancy Idarat Ltd, describes Las Qoray as &quot;on the north coast of Puntland&quot; in 2014. Awet Tewelde Weldemichael, an associate professor at Queen&#x27;s University, wrote in his book &quot;Puntland coast between Las Qoray and Hafun&quot; in 2019.

==History==
===Ancient times===

The Las Qoray settlement is several centuries old. Between the town and El Ayo lies Karinhegane, a site containing numerous cave paintings of both real and mythical animals. Each painting has an inscription below it, which collectively have been estimated to be around 2,500 years old. Around from Las Qoray is found Gelweita, another key rock art site. Karinhegane&#x27;s rock art is in the same distinctive Ethiopian-Arabian style as the Laas Gaal cave paintings.

Somaliland is home to numerous such archaeological sites, with similar edifices found at Haylan, Qa’ableh, Qombo&#x27;ul and El Ayo. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.

=== Medieval to Early Modern ===
In the 13th century, Dhidhin, chief of Warsangali, a branch of Darod, rose to power around now Las Qoray and took the title of Garaad as the monarch&#x27;s title.

The town of Las Qoray began in 1735 when Al-sheikh Cali Maxamud Nuux of the Ugaslabe/Warsangali clan built a mosque and prospered through trade with Swahili, Zanzibar, Arabia, India, etc.

Mohamoud Ali Shire, who became Sultan of Warsangali at the end of the 19th century, made Las Qoray his base. However, there were several bases, and during the hot summer months, they were based in the cooler valleys in the south, away from the coast.

===Modern===
In 1986, executives from the American oil company Chevron visited Las Qoray at the request of the Somali government and found traces of oil.

The Somali Civil War broke out around 1988; in 1991, Somaliland declared the independence; in 1998, Puntland declared the establish. Both countries are stability relatively quickly, with Somaliland trying to expand its power to the east and Puntland to the west. The two sides engaged in a military confrontation around the Warsangali residential area (Puntland-Somaliland dispute.)

In April 2011, Puntland government arrested 16 pirates in Las Qoray.

In July 2011, a British research vessel was authorized by the Somaliland government to visit Las Khorey, but the stationed Puntland military refused.

Former president Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud (Siilaanyo) visited the town in March 2014 along with a delegation including then Minister of Health Suleiman Haglotosiye. The restoration of Las Qoray&#x27;s industries, among them its famous tuna factory, as well as the planned construction of a hospital for the town was announced during the visit.

In 2017, voter registration for the 2017 Somaliland presidential election took place throughout Somaliland, but there were no registrations from Dhahar and Las Qoray districts.

In December 2019, flooding in the Las Qoray area caused missing people and flooded and isolated roads to and from surrounding neighborhoods.

In February 2020, Somaliland&#x27;s Badhan Regional Governor Mohamud Hamd Omar visited Las Khorey district with Somaliland army. The Puntland army with Ali Hussein Somali, governor of Sanaag region of Puntland, attacked it.

During the conflict between July 2021 and November 2022, Las Qoray had the largest number of exodus in Sanaag. Meanwhile, in October 2021, the Somaliland government began the forced deportation of hundreds of people they defined as &quot;non-Somalilanders&quot; from some areas of Sanaag. However, it is reported that Las Qoray is very unlikely to be targeted.

In March 2023, Puntland&#x27;s Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources, in cooperation with Secure Fisheries, an agency working to develop the fishing industry, launched a Fisheries Partnership Management Program in the Las Qoray area.

==Transportation==

Las Qoray has a jetty-class seaport, the Port of Las Qoray. Horn Relief (now Adeso), an organization founded by Somali environmentalist Fatima Jibrell, began a project for the redevelopment of the 400-year-old seaport. The initiative was later taken up by Faisal Hawar, CEO of the Maakhir Resource Company. In 2012, he brokered an agreement with a Greek investment firm for the development of the commercial Las Qoray Port. A team of engineers was subsequently enlisted by the Puntland authorities to assess the ongoing renovations taking place at the seaport. According to the Minister of Ports, Saeed Mohamed Ragge, the Puntland government intends to launch more such development projects in Las Khorey.

The nearest airport to Las Qoray is the Bender Qassim International Airport in Bosaso.
==Demographics==
Las Qoray has a population of around 2,000 inhabitants. The broader Las Qoray area has a total population of 34,724 residents.

==Economy==
Las Qoray has long been an exporter of livestock, fish, produce, and frankincense. On the other hand, they imported rice, wheat, sugar, clothing, etc.
Canned tuna is well known and &quot;Las Qoray&quot; is accepted as like a trademark. In 1970, the Somali government built a fish cannery with a pier for fishing boats, and it became a major industry in Las Qoray. In addition to tuna, shark fins are also taken for export.

The factory, which had been shut down due to the Somali civil war, reopened in 2001, but was closed shortly after. The facility was modernized and reopened in 2007. At that time, there were 2,800 fishermen and factory workers. On August 12, Hodman Trading Company, a company in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, acquired the entire plant of Las Qoray. In 2012, it was reported that they were exporting to Yemen and the United Arab Emirates. In 2019, the BBC reports that fakes are on the market. Las Qoray&#x27;s cannery will remain shut down as of April 2021.

<text>Versata is a business-rules based application development environment running in Java EE. It is a subsidiary of Trilogy, Inc.

==History==
Versata started in the early 1990s as a software consulting company called Vision Software. Over time it developed and sold software for Microsoft Visual Basic development market. Around 1994, it began development of an integrated development environment for applications. It included a GUI builder and a business rules engine that enabled developers to create a Web application rapidly using MS SQL Server or Oracle in the backend. The product, called Vision Jade, was released around 1997. It was enhanced to support three tier applications and Java thin clients.

Vision Software changed its key product and company name to Versata, went public in March 2000 and, on that day, was worth an astonishing $4 billion—astonishing considering that the company had revenues of about $60 million and was losing a lot of money; but this was during the Dot-com bubble. Despite hard times, Versata has managed to stay alive and maintain its customer base.

In November 2000, Versata expanded into the business workflow area with the acquisition of Verve, Inc..

From early 2001 through mid-2003, Versata&#x27;s revenues were in quarter over quarter decline until Alan Baratz took over as CEO. Five consecutive quarters of growth followed until early 2005 when revenues once again took a downward plunge.

Mid-2005 the company was notified by NASDAQ that it no longer met NASDAQ&#x27;s requirements for continued listing, related to maintenance of a minimum amount of shareholder&#x27;s equity, market value, or net income. Rather than continue to focus on these requirements, the company decided to move to the OTC (also known as the Pink Sheets) in order to remain publicly traded.

On 7 December 2005, Versata announced that Austin based Trilogy, Inc. had made an offer to acquire the company by tender. That deal was consummated in February 2006, taking the company private.

Trilogy then proceeded to merge portions of Trilogy, specifically, Trilogy Technology Group, into Versata and began acquiring further companies, reorganizing dramatically and offshoring most technical positions to its office in Bangalore, India.

From 2006 to 2008, Versata continued to make acquisitions mostly in US. Most of the employees in the acquired companies were laid -off with the majority work being offshored to its India office in Bangalore.

In early 2009, Versata made another major overhaul of its business model when it asked all its employees in India to work as contractors through oDesk for a gDev which is an entity incorporated by Trilogy to manage its outsourcing activities. The only employees left in Versata were the ones in US.

A jury in the Eastern District of Texas awarded Versata Software $139m following its decision that SAP infringed two of Versata&#x27;s patents - U.S. Patent No. 6,553,350 and U.S. Patent No. 5,878,400. Sam Baxter, Ted Stevenson, Scott Cole and Steve Pollinger of McKool Smith represented Versata on this case. iRunway India Private Limited and NTrak LLC were the technical consultants and provided end-to-end litigation support to McKool Smith.
The case has been rumbling on for a couple of years now, hinging on Versata-owned patents that cover mechanisms for pricing products. In January 2011, the judge in the case set aside the damages award, and ordered a new trial on damages.

In June, 2010, Versata filed an antitrust complaint against SAP AG. It alleges that SAP illegally excluded Versata from selling to vast majority of large ERP customers.
==Acquisitions==
On July 3, 2006, Versata acquired Artemis International Solutions Corporation, a provider of project and product portfolio management tools, including Artemis (software).

In September 2007, Versata acquired Nextance a provider of enterprise contract management solutions.

In November 2007, Versata acquired Gensym. Gensym is a provider of business rule engine software.

February 22, 2008 – Privately held Versata Enterprises, Inc. Announced the acquisition of NUVO Network Management Inc. Nuvo was a Canadian-based managed service provider/software provider.

February 25, 2008 - Versata acquired AlterPoint, a maker of Network Change and Configuration Management (NCCM) software.

March, 2008 - Versata acquired Tenfold Corporation. TenFold Corporation (OTC: TENF.OB)is a provider of EnterpriseTenFold SOA, an SOA-compliant, Ajax-enabled solutions framework for adding functionality to existing applications and building enterprise-scale applications.

In May 2008, Versata acquired Evolutionary Technologies International (ETI) and Clear Technologies.

On August 7, 2009 - Versata announced the acquisition of Everest Software, Inc. (Everest), a provider of retail and wholesale business management software.

On January 14, 2010 - Versata announced the acquisition of PurchasingNet, Inc. PurchasingNet, a Web-based provider of eProcurement, ePayables and Financial Management services and solutions to mid- and large-sized organizations.

<doc id="1254304" wikidata="Q1501204" url="?curid=1254304" title="Gemonian stairs">
<text>The Gemonian Stairs (, ) were a flight of steps located in the ancient city of Rome. Nicknamed the Stairs of Mourning, the stairs are infamous in Roman history as a place of execution.

== Location ==

The steps were situated in the central part of Rome, leading from the Arx of the Capitoline Hill down to the Roman Forum. As viewed from the Forum, they passed down the Tabularium and the Temple of Concord on the left side, and past the Mamertine Prison on the right side. It is believed that the location of the steps roughly coincides with the current Via di San Pietro in Carcere, past the ruins of the Mamertine Prison.

It is believed the stairs were built some time before the rule of Tiberius (14–37), as they were not mentioned by name in any ancient texts that predate this period. Their first use as a place of execution is primarily associated with the rumoured paranoid excesses of Tiberius&#x27; later reign.

== Executions ==
The condemned were usually strangled before their bodies were bound and desecrated. Occasionally the corpses of the executed were transferred here for display from other places of execution in Rome. Corpses were usually left to rot on the staircase for extended periods of time in full view of the Forum, scavenged by dogs or other carrion animals, until eventually being thrown into the Tiber.

Death on the stairs was considered extremely dishonourable and dreadful, yet several senators and even an emperor met their demise here. Among the most famous who were executed on this spot were the prefect of the Praetorian Guard Lucius Aelius Sejanus and the emperor Vitellius. Sejanus was a former confidant of emperor Tiberius who was implicated in a conspiracy in AD 31. According to Cassius Dio, Sejanus was strangled and cast down the Gemonian stairs, where the mob abused his corpse for three days. Soon after, his three children were similarly executed in this place.

Vitellius was a Roman general who became the third emperor in the so-called Year of the Four Emperors in AD 69. He succeeded Otho upon his suicide on 16 April, but lived to be emperor for only eight months. When his armies were defeated by those of Vespasian he agreed to surrender, but the Praetorian Guard refused to let him leave the city. On the entrance of Vespasian&#x27;s troops into Rome he was dragged out of his hiding place, driven to the Gemonian stairs and struck down. His last words were &quot;Yet I was once your Emperor&quot;.

On those same stairs, Decebalus&#x27;s head was thrown along with his right hand in AD 106.

== Similar places ==
During Republican times, the Tarpeian Rock, a steep cliff at the southern summit of the Capitoline Hill, was used for similar purposes. Murderers and traitors, if convicted by the &quot;quaestores parricidii&quot;, were flung from the cliff to their deaths. Infants who suffered from significant mental or physical disabilities sometimes suffered the same fate, as they were thought to have been cursed by the gods.

<text>Hannah Höch (; 1 November 1889 – 31 May 1978) was a German Dada artist. She is best known for her work of the Weimar period, when she was one of the originators of photomontage. Photomontage, or fotomontage, is a type of collage in which the pasted items are actual photographs, or photographic reproductions pulled from the press and other widely produced media.

An important element in Höch&#x27;s work was the intention to dismantle the fable and dichotomy that existed in the concept of the &quot;New Woman&quot;: an energetic, professional, and androgynous woman, who is ready to take her place as man&#x27;s equal. Her interest in the topic was in how the dichotomy was structured, as well as in who structures social roles.

Other key themes in Höch&#x27;s works were androgyny, political discourse, and shifting gender roles. These themes all interacted to create a feminist discourse surrounding Höch&#x27;s works, which encouraged the liberation and agency of women during the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) and continuing through to today.

Hannah Höch was born Anna Therese Johanne Höch in Gotha, Germany. Although she attended school, domesticity took precedence in the Höch household. In 1904, Höch was taken out of the Höhere Töchterschule in Gotha to care for her youngest sibling, Marianne. In 1912 she began classes at the college of Applied Arts in Berlin under the guidance of glass designer Harold Bergen. She chose the curriculum in glass design and graphic arts, rather than fine arts, to please her father.

In 1914, at the start of World War I, she left the school and returned home to Gotha to work with the Red Cross. In 1915 she returned to Berlin, where she entered the graphics class of Emil Orlik at the National Institute of the Museum of Arts and Crafts. Also in 1915, Höch began an intimate relationship with Raoul Hausmann, a later activist of the Berlin Dada movement. Höch&#x27;s involvement with the Berlin Dadaists began in earnest in 1917. Höch, as the only woman among the Berlin group, was singled out for her self-sufficiency, masculine presentation, and bisexuality, as she consistently addressed themes of the &quot;New Woman&quot; who was free to vote, to begin and enjoy sexual encounters and to seek financial independence.

From 1916 to 1926, she worked in the handicrafts department for the publisher Ullstein Verlag, designing dress, embroidery, lace, and handiwork designs for &quot;Die Dame&quot; (The Lady) and &quot;Die Praktische Berlinerin&quot; (The Practical Berlin Woman). The influence of this early work and training can be seen in a number of her collages made in the late 1910s and early- to mid-1920s in which she incorporated sewing patterns and needlework designs. From 1926 to 1929 she lived and worked in the Netherlands. Höch formed many influential friendships and professional relationships over the years with individuals such as Kurt Schwitters, Nelly van Doesburg, Theo van Doesburg, Sonia Delaunay, László Moholy-Nagy, and Piet Mondrian, among others. Höch, along with Hausmann, was one of the first pioneers of the art form that would come to be known as photomontage.
===Personal life and relationships===
Art historian Maria Makela has characterized Höch&#x27;s affair with Raoul Hausmann as &quot;stormy&quot;, and identifies the central cause of their altercations—some of which ended in violence—in Hausmann&#x27;s refusal to leave his wife. He reached the point of fantasizing about killing Höch. Hausmann continually disparaged Höch not only for her desire to marry him, which he described as a &quot;Bourgeois&quot; inclination, but also for her opinions on art. Hausmann&#x27;s hypocritical stance on women&#x27;s emancipation spurred Höch to write &quot;a caustic short story&quot; entitled &quot;The Painter&quot; in 1920, the subject of which is &quot;an artist who is thrown into an intense spiritual crisis when his wife asks him to do the dishes.&quot; Hausmann repeatedly implied that the only way Höch could reach her full potential, as a woman and in their relationship, was to have a child with him. Höch herself wanted children, but both times she found she was pregnant with Hausmann&#x27;s child, in May 1916 and January 1918, she had an abortion.

Höch ended her seven-year relationship with Raoul Hausmann in 1922. In 1926, she began a relationship with the Dutch writer and linguist Mathilda (&#x27;Til&#x27;) Brugman, whom Höch met through mutual friends Kurt and Helma Schwitters. By autumn of 1926, Höch moved to The Hague to live with Brugman, where they lived until 1929, at which time they moved to Berlin. Höch and Brugman&#x27;s relationship lasted nine years, until 1935. They did not explicitly define their relationship as lesbian, instead choosing to refer to it as a private love relationship. In 1935, Höch began a relationship with Kurt Matthies, to whom she was married from 1938 to 1944.

===Later years===
Höch spent the years of the Third Reich in Berlin, Germany, keeping a low profile. She was the last member of the Berlin Dada group to remain in Germany during this period. She bought and lived in a small garden house in Berlin-Heiligensee, a remote area on the outskirts of Berlin.

She married businessman and pianist Kurt Matthies in 1938 and divorced him in 1944. She suffered from the Nazi censorship of art, and her work was deemed &quot;degenerate art&quot;, which made it even more difficult for her to show her works. Though her work was not as acclaimed after the war as it had been before the rise of the Third Reich, she continued to produce her photomontages and exhibit them internationally until her death in 1978, in Berlin. Her house and garden can be visited at the annual Tag des offenen Denkmals.

The 128th anniversary of her birthday was commemorated on 1 November 2017 by a Google Doodle.

== Dada ==

Dada was an artistic movement formed in 1916 in Zurich, Switzerland. The movement rejected monarchy, militarism, and conservatism and was enmeshed in an &quot;anti-art&quot; sentiment. Dadaists felt that art should have no boundaries or restrictions and that it can be whimsical and playful. These sentiments arose after the Great War, which caused society to question the role of government, and to reject militarism after seeing the atrocities of war. Many Dada pieces were critical of the Weimar Republic and its failed attempt at creating a democracy in post-war (WWI) Germany.

The Dada movement had a tone of fundamental negativity in regards to bourgeois society. The term &quot;dada&quot; has no actual meaning – it is a childlike word used to describe the lack of reason or logic in much of the artwork. The main artists involved in the movement in Berlin include George Grosz, John Heartfield and Raoul Hausmann. Some claim that it was Höch&#x27;s relationship with Hausmann that allowed her into the sphere of Dada artists. George Grosz and John Heartfield were against Höch exhibiting with them in the 1920 First International Dada Fair, for example, and only allowed her participation after Raoul Hausmann argued for her inclusion. Later, Hausmann still attempted to deny Höch a place in the movement, by writing in his memoirs that &quot;she was never a member of the club.&quot; She nonetheless held the title of “Dadasophin“ within the movement.

Höch is best known for her photomontages. These collages, which borrowed images from popular culture and utilized the dismemberment and reassembly of images, were a central element of the Dada aesthetic, though other Dadaists were hesitant to accept her work due to inherent sexism in the movement. Her work added &quot;a wryly feminist note&quot; to the Dadaist philosophy of disdain towards bourgeois society, but both her identity as a woman and her feminist subject matter contributed to her never being fully accepted by the male Dadaists.

Like other Dada artists, Höch&#x27;s work also came under close scrutiny by the Nazis as it was considered degenerate. The Nazis put to a stop her 1932 intended exhibition at the Bauhaus (a German art school). They were not only offended by her aesthetic, but also by her political messages and by the mere fact that she was a woman.

Her images portrayed androgynous individuals, which the Nazis despised. Nazi ideology appreciated artwork that portrayed the ideal Aryan German man and woman. The images Höch used often contrasted this look, or used it to make a point about society, such as in the piece &quot;Das Schöne Mädchen&quot; (&quot;The Beautiful Girl&quot;). The Nazis preferred a traditional clear rational style of artwork that did not require deep thought or analysis. They felt that the chaos of the Dada style bordered on pathological. Höch went into seclusion during the Nazi years and was later able to return to the art world after the fall of the Third Reich.

=== Photomontage ===
&quot;Höch&#x27;s photomontages display the chaos and combustion of Berlin&#x27;s visual culture from a particularly female perspective&quot; (Makholm). &quot;Höch was not only a rare female practicing prominently in the arts in the early part of the twentieth century—near unique as a female active in the Dada group in Berlin that coalesced in her time—she also consciously promoted the idea of women working creatively more generally in society. She explicitly addressed in her pioneering artwork in the form of photomontage the issue of gender and the figure of woman in modern society&quot; (The Art Story).

In these montages, Höch gathered images and text from popular forms of media, such as newspapers and magazines, and combined them in often uncanny ways, which were able to express her stances on the important social issues of her time. The fact that images she included in her pieces were pulled from current newspapers and magazines gave her messages validity.

The power of the works came from the intentional dismemberment and reconstruction of the images. This alludes to the notion that current issues can be viewed through different lenses. This technique was originally thought of as extremely leftist and revolutionary, but by the 1930s, it had become an accepted mode of design linked with modernity and consumerism. Thus began the notion that mass culture and fine arts could be combined in a meaningful way. The ambiguity in her work was integral to the way which she addressed issues of sexuality and gender. These complex constructions of genders allow women to embrace both their masculine and feminine attributes. This leads to an intensified sense of individualism. Photomontage is a large part of Höch&#x27;s legacy as an artist.

=== Women in Dada ===
The role that women played in Dada has been the object of research in recent years, including in scholarly works by Ruth Hemus, Nadia Sawleson-Gorse and Paula K. Kamenish. While the Dadaists, including Georg Schrimpf, Franz Jung, and Johannes Baader, &quot;paid lip service to women&#x27;s emancipation,&quot; they were clearly reluctant to include a woman among their ranks. Hans Richter described Höch&#x27;s contribution to the Dada movement as the &quot;sandwiches, beer and coffee she managed somehow to conjure up despite the shortage of money.&quot; Raoul Hausmann even suggested that Höch get a job to support him financially, despite her being the only one from her close circle to have a stable income.

On her exclusion and the sexism of the Dadaists, Höch responded, &quot;None of these men were satisfied with just an ordinary woman. But neither were they included to abandon the (conventional) male/masculine morality toward the woman. Enlightened by Freud, in protest against the older generation. . . they all desired this ‘New Woman’ and her groundbreaking will to freedom. But—they more or less brutally rejected the notion that they, too, had to adopt new attitudes. . . This led to these truly Strinbergian dramas that typified the private lives of these men.”

Höch was the lone woman among the Berlin Dada group. Emmy Hennings and Sophie Taeuber were also important figures in Zurich, while others, including Beatrice Wood and Baroness Else von Freytag-Loringhoven, participated in New York. Höch references the hypocrisy of the Berlin Dada group and German society as a whole in her photomontage, &quot;Da-Dandy.&quot; Höch also wrote about the hypocrisy of men in the Dada movement in her short essay &quot;The Painter&quot;, published in 1920, in which she portrays a modern couple that embraces gender equality in their relationship, a novel and shocking concept for the time. This is an example of how Höch was able to transcend one particular medium and convey her social ideals in many forms.

Höch&#x27;s time at Ullstein Verlag working with magazines targeted at women made her acutely aware of the difference between women as portrayed in media and their reality, and her workplace provided her with many of the images that served as raw material for her own work. She was also critical of the institution of marriage, often depicting brides as mannequins and children, reflecting the socially pervasive idea of women as incomplete people with little control over their lives.

Höch worked for the magazine Ullstein Verlag between 1916 and 1926 in the department which focused on design patterns, handicrafts, knitting and embroidery, artistic forms within the domestic sphere which were considered appropriate for women. &quot;The pattern designs Höch created for Ullstein&#x27;s women&#x27;s magazines and her early experiments with modernist abstraction were integrally related, blurring the boundaries between traditionally masculine and feminine modes of form and expression&quot; (Makholm). She wrote a Manifesto of Modern Embroidery in 1918, which spoke to the modern woman, empowering her to take pride in her work. &quot;She now drew on this experience and on a large body of advertising material she had collected, in images that were unprecedented in their insights into the way society &#x27;constructs&#x27; women&quot; (Hudson).

Höch considered herself a part of the women&#x27;s movement in the 1920s, as shown in her depiction of herself, alongside multiple political and cultural figures, in the large-scale photomontage &quot;Schnitt mit dem Küchenmesser DADA durch die letzte Weimarer Bierbauchkulturepoche Deutschlands&quot; (&quot;Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany&quot;) (1919–20). Her pieces also commonly combine male and female traits into one unified being. During the era of the Weimar Republic, &quot;mannish women were both celebrated and castigated for breaking down traditional gender roles.&quot; In this artwork Hoch metaphorically equates her scissors, used to cut images or her collages, to the kitchen knife. This is used to symbolize cutting through the dominant domains of politics and public life in Weimer culture. Her androgynous characters may also have been related to her bisexuality and attraction to masculinity in women (that is, attraction to the female form paired with stereotypically masculine characteristics).

==Works==
Höch was a pioneer of the art form that became known as photomontage and of the Dada movement. Many of her pieces sardonically critiqued the mass culture beauty industry of the time, then gaining significant momentum in mass media through the rise of fashion and advertising photography. Many of her political works from the Dada period equated women&#x27;s liberation with social and political revolution.

Her work displays the chaos and combustion of Berlin&#x27;s visual culture from the female perspective. In particular, her photomontages often critically addressed the Weimar New Woman, collating images from contemporary magazines. Her works from 1926 to 1935 often depicted same-sex couples, and women were once again a central theme in her work from 1963 to 1973. Her most often used technique was to fuse together male and female bodies. This fusion existed in order to give the attributed power of a man to a woman, as well as blur the lines of gender attributed actions. She also used historically feminine mediums such as embroidery and lace in her collages to highlight gendered associations.

Höch also made strong statements on racial discrimination. Her most famous piece is &quot;Schnitt mit dem Küchenmesser DADA durch die letzte Weimarer Bierbauchkulturepoche Deutschlands&quot; (&quot;Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany&quot;), a critique of Weimar Germany in 1919. This piece combines images from newspapers of the time mixed and re-created to make a new statement about life and art in the Dada movement.

&quot;From an Ethnographic Museum&quot; (1929), one of Höch&#x27;s most ambitious and highly political projects, is a series of twenty photomontages that depict images of European female bodies with images of African male bodies and masks from museum catalogues, creating collages that offer &quot;the visual culture of two vastly separate civilizations as interchangeable—the modish European flapper loses none of her stylishness in immediate proximity to African tribal objects; likewise, the non-Western artifact is able to signify in some fundamental sense as ritual object despite its conflation with patently European features.&quot; Hoch created &quot;Dada Puppen&quot; (Dada Dolls) 1916. These dolls were influenced by Hugo Ball, the Zurich-based founder of Dada. The doll&#x27;s costumes resembled the geometric forms of Ball&#x27;s own costumes worn in seminal Dada performances.

== Important works ==

=== &quot;Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany&quot; (1919) ===
Dada was an inherently political movement; Dadaists often deployed satire to address the issues of the time. They attempted to push art to the limits of humanity and to convey the chaos in post-war (World War I, which did not yet have this title) Germany. &quot;Many of Höch&#x27;s overtly political photomontages caricatured the pretended socialism of the new republic and linked female liberation with leftist political revolution&quot; (Lavin). Perhaps Höch&#x27;s most well known piece &quot;Schnitt mit dem Küchenmesser DADA durch die letzte Weimarer Bierbauchkulturepoche Deutschlands&quot; (&quot;Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Beer-Belly of the Weimar Republic&quot;) symbolizes her cutting through the patriarchal society. The piece is a direct criticism of the failed attempt at democracy imposed by the Weimar Republic. &quot;Cut with the Kitchen Knife&quot; is &quot;an explosive agglomeration of cut-up images, bang in the middle of the most well-known photograph of the seminal First International Dada Fair in 1920&quot; (Hudson). This photomontage is an excellent example of a piece that combines these three central themes in Höch&#x27;s works: androgyny, the &quot;New Woman&quot; and political discourse. It combines images of political leaders with sports stars, mechanized images of the city, and Dada artists.

=== &quot;The Beautiful Girl&quot; (1920) ===

&quot;The New Woman of Weimar Germany was a sign of modernity and liberation&quot; (Lavin).

Women in Weimar Germany in theory had a new freedom to discover social, political, and self-definition—all areas heavily addressed by Höch. Despite this, there were still many issues with the socioeconomic status of women. Women were given more freedom, yet in a way that seemed to be predetermined for them. They were still restricted to certain jobs and had the less employment benefits than their male counterparts. Analysis of Höch&#x27;s piece &quot;Das Schöne Mädchen&quot; (&quot;The Beautiful Girl&quot;) shows the construction of the archetype of the &quot;New Woman&quot;. The piece combines motifs of the ideal feminine woman with car parts. In the upper right corner there is a woman&#x27;s face with the eyes of a cat. Along with industrialization comes the opportunity for women to be more involved in the workforce. While this opportunity was exciting for women, it was also frightening—symbolized by the cat eyes staring down at the image. This image shows that although women were excited about the idea of the &quot;New Woman&quot; and the freedom this lifestyle might bring, it was a freedom that was still constructed by men, who still had most of the power in society.

=== &quot;Marlene&quot; (1930) ===

This piece alludes to an ambiguous sexual identity of the subject. The image depicts two men looking upward at a pair of legs clad in stockings with high heels atop a pedestal. This pedestal symbolizes traditionalism, while the legs show sexuality triumphing over classical architecture (which would have been revered by the Nazis). The lips in the upper right corner show a feminine sexuality that is kept from the male gaze. (Lavin). For the viewer, the piece can provide the concept of a utopian moment that opposes gender-hierarchies. &quot;Her androgynous images depict a pleasure in the movement between gender positions and a deliberate deconstruction of rigid masculine and feminine identities&quot; (Lavin). These ideas were radical at the time when Höch raised them, but are still in the process of being addressed today. Androgyny can be viewed as a utopian ideal in Höch&#x27;s works; in addition it relates to some of the radical leftist ideas in her works and the political discourse surrounding them.

=== &quot;Ethnographic Museum&quot; Series (1924–1930) ===
Höch created an expansive series of works titled the Ethnographic Museum Series after a visit to an ethnographic museum. Germany had begun colonial expansion into African and Oceanic territories by the 1880s, which lead to an influx of cultural artifacts into Germany. Höch was inspired by the pedestals and masks present in the museums, and began incorporating them into her art.

=== &quot;Mother&quot; (1930) &quot;Ethnographic Museum&quot; series (1924–1930) ===
The photomontage &quot;Mutter&quot; (&quot;Mother&quot;), part of Höch&#x27;s &quot;Ethnographic Museum&quot; series, utilizes the photo of a pregnant, working class mother. Höch effaces the woman with a mask from the Kwakwakaʼwakw, or the Kwakuti Indian tribe, on the Northwest Coast. She pastes a woman&#x27;s mouth over the bottom of the mask, and a single eye over one of the eye holes. The image is part of an ongoing critique by Höch of Paragraph 218, a law outlawing abortion in Germany at the time.

=== &quot;Death Dance&quot; and &quot;Time of Suffering&quot; Series ===
Höch also executed two series around 1943, &quot;TotenTanz&quot; (&quot;Death Dance&quot;&quot;)&quot; and &quot;Notzeit&quot; (&quot;Time of Suffering&quot;). &quot;Death Dance&quot; consists of three works, titled &quot;Death Dance I, Death Dance II,&quot; and &quot;Death Dance III&quot;. This series is primarily watercolor and pencil. The images show individual figures without hair or defining features, in long gray shifts, filing across barren pastel landscapes. The &quot;Time of Suffering&quot; series is black and white but contains similar figures to the &quot;Death Dance&quot; series. The series, comprising two works titled &quot;Time of Suffering I&quot; and &quot;Time of Suffering II&quot;, shows the figures walking through a cemetery towards a grim reaper, and a line of people leading up into the sky.

=== &quot;Strange Beauty II&quot; (1966) ===
Höch returned to the female figure in the 1960s after a long period where she favored surrealism and abstraction. Fremde Schönheit II (&quot;Strange Beauty II&quot;) is a part of this return, showing a woman surrounded by feathery pink fauna. The woman&#x27;s face is covered by a Peruvian terracotta trophy head. In this piece, Höch effaces the figure of the New Woman and replaces her head with a tribal mask, turning the figure from beautiful to disturbing.

==Exhibitions==
Höch&#x27;s work has been exhibited internationally in solo and group exhibitions.

The Whitechapel Gallery in London presented a major exhibition of Höch&#x27;s work from 15 January to 23 March 2014. This exhibition was composed of over one hundred works from international collections that Höch created from the 1910s to 1970s. Highlights included &quot;Staatshäupter (Heads of State)&quot; (1918–20), &quot;Hochfinanz (High Finance)&quot; (1923), &quot;Flucht (Flight)&quot; (1931), and many works from the series &quot;From an Ethnographic Museum&quot;.

Examples of her work were included in &quot;Woven Histories: Textiles and Modern Abstraction&quot;.

<text>In numerical analysis, Brent&#x27;s method is a hybrid root-finding algorithm combining the bisection method, the secant method and inverse quadratic interpolation. It has the reliability of bisection but it can be as quick as some of the less-reliable methods. The algorithm tries to use the potentially fast-converging secant method or inverse quadratic interpolation if possible, but it falls back to the more robust bisection method if necessary. Brent&#x27;s method is due to Richard Brent and builds on an earlier algorithm by Theodorus Dekker. Consequently, the method is also known as the Brent–Dekker method.

Modern improvements on Brent&#x27;s method include Chandrupatla&#x27;s method, which is simpler and faster for functions that are flat around their roots; Ridders&#x27; method, which performs exponential interpolations instead of quadratic providing a simpler closed formula for the iterations; and the ITP method which is a hybrid between regula-falsi and bisection that achieves optimal worst-case and asymptotic guarantees.

== Dekker&#x27;s method ==

The idea to combine the bisection method with the secant method goes back to .

Suppose that we want to solve the equation &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0. As with the bisection method, we need to initialize Dekker&#x27;s method with two points, say &quot;a&quot;0 and &quot;b&quot;0, such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;0) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;0) have opposite signs. If &quot;f&quot; is continuous on [&quot;a&quot;0, &quot;b&quot;0], the intermediate value theorem guarantees the existence of a solution between &quot;a&quot;0 and &quot;b&quot;0.

Three points are involved in every iteration:
* &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the current iterate, i.e., the current guess for the root of &quot;f&quot;.
* &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the &quot;contrapoint,&quot; i.e., a point such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;) have opposite signs, so the interval [&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;] contains the solution. Furthermore, |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;)| should be less than or equal to |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;)|, so that &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; is a better guess for the unknown solution than &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;.
* &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1 is the previous iterate (for the first iteration, we set &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1 = &quot;a&quot;0).

Two provisional values for the next iterate are computed. The first one is given by linear interpolation, also known as the secant method:
::formula_1

and the second one is given by the bisection method
::formula_2
If the result of the secant method, &quot;s&quot;, lies strictly between &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; and &quot;m&quot;, then it becomes the next iterate (&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 = &quot;s&quot;), otherwise the midpoint is used (&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 = &quot;m&quot;).

Then, the value of the new contrapoint is chosen such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1) have opposite signs. If &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1) have opposite signs, then the contrapoint remains the same: &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 = &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;. Otherwise, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;) have opposite signs, so the new contrapoint becomes &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 = &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;.

Finally, if |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1)| &lt; |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1)|, then &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 is probably a better guess for the solution than &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1, and hence the values of &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 and &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 are exchanged.

This ends the description of a single iteration of Dekker&#x27;s method.

Dekker&#x27;s method performs well if the function &quot;f&quot; is reasonably well-behaved. However, there are circumstances in which every iteration employs the secant method, but the iterates &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; converge very slowly (in particular, |&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; − &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1| may be arbitrarily small). Dekker&#x27;s method requires far more iterations than the bisection method in this case.

== Brent&#x27;s method ==
 proposed a small modification to avoid the problem with Dekker&#x27;s method. He inserts an additional test which must be satisfied before the result of the secant method is accepted as the next iterate. Two inequalities must be simultaneously satisfied:

Given a specific numerical tolerance formula_3, if the previous step used the bisection method, the inequality formula_4 must hold to perform interpolation, otherwise the bisection method is performed and its result used for the next iteration.

If the previous step performed interpolation, then the inequality formula_5 is used instead to perform the next action (to choose) interpolation (when inequality is true) or bisection method (when inequality is not true).

Also, if the previous step used the bisection method, the inequality formula_6
must hold, otherwise the bisection method is performed and its result used for the next iteration. If the previous step performed interpolation, then the inequality formula_7
is used instead.

This modification ensures that at the kth iteration, a bisection step will be performed in at most formula_8 additional iterations, because the above conditions force consecutive interpolation step sizes to halve every two iterations, and after at most formula_8 iterations, the step size will be smaller than formula_3, which invokes a bisection step. Brent proved that his method requires at most &quot;N&quot;2 iterations, where &quot;N&quot; denotes the number of iterations for the bisection method. If the function &quot;f&quot; is well-behaved, then Brent&#x27;s method will usually proceed by either inverse quadratic or linear interpolation, in which case it will converge superlinearly.

Furthermore, Brent&#x27;s method uses inverse quadratic interpolation instead of linear interpolation (as used by the secant method). If &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;), &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1) are distinct, it slightly increases the efficiency. As a consequence, the condition for accepting &quot;s&quot; (the value proposed by either linear interpolation or inverse quadratic interpolation) has to be changed: &quot;s&quot; has to lie between (3&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; + &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;) / 4 and &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot;.

==Example==

Suppose that we are seeking a zero of the function defined by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; + 3)(&quot;x&quot; − 1)2.

We take [&quot;a&quot;0, &quot;b&quot;0] = [−4, 4/3] as our initial interval.

We have &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;0) = −25 and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;0) = 0.48148 (all numbers in this section are rounded), so the conditions &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;0) &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;0) &lt; 0 and |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;0)| ≤ |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;0)| are satisfied.
# In the first iteration, we use linear interpolation between (&quot;b&quot;−1, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;−1)) = (&quot;a&quot;0, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;0)) = (−4, −25) and (&quot;b&quot;0, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;0)) = (1.33333, 0.48148), which yields &quot;s&quot; = 1.23256. This lies between (3&quot;a&quot;0 + &quot;b&quot;0) / 4 and &quot;b&quot;0, so this value is accepted. Furthermore, &quot;f&quot;(1.23256) = 0.22891, so we set &quot;a&quot;1 = &quot;a&quot;0 and &quot;b&quot;1 = &quot;s&quot; = 1.23256.
# In the second iteration, we use inverse quadratic interpolation between (&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1)) = (−4, −25) and (&quot;b&quot;0, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;0)) = (1.33333, 0.48148) and (&quot;b&quot;1, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;1)) = (1.23256, 0.22891). This yields 1.14205, which lies between (3&quot;a&quot;1 + &quot;b&quot;1) / 4 and &quot;b&quot;1. Furthermore, the inequality |1.14205 − &quot;b&quot;1| ≤ |&quot;b&quot;0 − &quot;b&quot;−1| / 2 is satisfied, so this value is accepted. Furthermore, &quot;f&quot;(1.14205) = 0.083582, so we set &quot;a&quot;2 = &quot;a&quot;1 and &quot;b&quot;2 = 1.14205.
# In the third iteration, we use inverse quadratic interpolation between (&quot;a&quot;2, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;2)) = (−4, −25) and (&quot;b&quot;1, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;1)) = (1.23256, 0.22891) and (&quot;b&quot;2, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;2)) = (1.14205, 0.083582). This yields 1.09032, which lies between (3&quot;a&quot;2 + &quot;b&quot;2) / 4 and &quot;b&quot;2. But here Brent&#x27;s additional condition kicks in: the inequality |1.09032 − &quot;b&quot;2| ≤ |&quot;b&quot;1 − &quot;b&quot;0| / 2 is not satisfied, so this value is rejected. Instead, the midpoint &quot;m&quot; = −1.42897 of the interval [&quot;a&quot;2, &quot;b&quot;2] is computed. We have &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) = 9.26891, so we set &quot;a&quot;3 = &quot;a&quot;2 and &quot;b&quot;3 = −1.42897.
# In the fourth iteration, we use inverse quadratic interpolation between (&quot;a&quot;3, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;3)) = (−4, −25) and (&quot;b&quot;2, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;2)) = (1.14205, 0.083582) and (&quot;b&quot;3, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;3)) = (−1.42897, 9.26891). This yields 1.15448, which is not in the interval between (3&quot;a&quot;3 + &quot;b&quot;3) / 4 and &quot;b&quot;3). Hence, it is replaced by the midpoint &quot;m&quot; = −2.71449. We have &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) = 3.93934, so we set &quot;a&quot;4 = &quot;a&quot;3 and &quot;b&quot;4 = −2.71449.
# In the fifth iteration, inverse quadratic interpolation yields −3.45500, which lies in the required interval. However, the previous iteration was a bisection step, so the inequality |−3.45500 − &quot;b&quot;4| ≤ |&quot;b&quot;4 − &quot;b&quot;3| / 2 need to be satisfied. This inequality is false, so we use the midpoint &quot;m&quot; = −3.35724. We have &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) = −6.78239, so &quot;m&quot; becomes the new contrapoint (&quot;a&quot;5 = −3.35724) and the iterate remains the same (&quot;b&quot;5 = &quot;b&quot;4). 
# In the sixth iteration, we cannot use inverse quadratic interpolation because &quot;b&quot;5 = &quot;b&quot;4. Hence, we use linear interpolation between (&quot;a&quot;5, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;5)) = (−3.35724, −6.78239) and (&quot;b&quot;5, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;5)) = (−2.71449, 3.93934). The result is &quot;s&quot; = −2.95064, which satisfies all the conditions. But since the iterate did not change in the previous step, we reject this result and fall back to bisection. We update &quot;s&quot; = -3.03587, and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) = -0.58418.
# In the seventh iteration, we can again use inverse quadratic interpolation. The result is &quot;s&quot; = −3.00219, which satisfies all the conditions. Now, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) = −0.03515, so we set &quot;a&quot;7 = &quot;b&quot;6 and &quot;b&quot;7 = −3.00219 (&quot;a&quot;7 and &quot;b&quot;7 are exchanged so that the condition |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;7)| ≤ |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;7)| is satisfied). (&quot;Correct&quot; : linear interpolation )
# In the eighth iteration, we cannot use inverse quadratic interpolation because &quot;a&quot;7 = &quot;b&quot;6. Linear interpolation yields &quot;s&quot; = −2.99994, which is accepted. (&quot;Correct&quot; : )
# In the following iterations, the root &quot;x&quot; = −3 is approached rapidly: &quot;b&quot;9 = −3 + 6·10−8 and &quot;b&quot;10 = −3 − 3·10−15. (&quot;Correct&quot; : Iter 9 : &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) = −1.4 × 10−7, Iter 10 : &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) = 6.96 × 10−12)

<text>Edward Galen Givens Jr. (January 5, 1930 – June 6, 1967) was a United States Air Force officer, test pilot, and NASA astronaut. Selected by NASA in 1966 as a member of the fifth astronaut group, he died in an automobile accident before being assigned to a prime or backup spaceflight crew.

==Early life and education==
Givens was born on January 5, 1930, in Quanah, Texas, to Edward Galen Givens Sr. (1904–1990) and Mary Helen Givens (; 1909–2002). He had one younger brother, Donald Jarrell Givens (1932–1952), who died in a Consolidated P4Y-2 Privateer crash in Corpus Christi, Texas.

As a child, his family called him Young Galen Givens. He took on extra courses when he was in high school, which allowed him to finish a year early. He worked in a grocery store and spent time cleaning cars to earn money for flying lessons and would hitchhike to Childress Municipal Airport to take them. His parents said he &quot;never had an interest in anything but aviation&quot;. Givens earned his pilot&#x27;s license in early 1946, and then performed a solo flight the day after he turned 16 in a Piper Cub. He graduated from Quanah High School in 1946. Givens was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout.

He attended Texas A&amp;M University for a semester and the University of Oklahoma for three semesters. He graduated in 1952, as an outstanding student, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Naval Sciences from the United States Naval Academy. During his time at the academy, Givens (or &quot;Give&quot;, as he was known there), studied academics, undertook flight training, and played varsity lacrosse.

Givens and his wife Ada had three children: Catherine H. (born in 1963), Edward G. (born in 1964), and Diane (born in 1967).

==Military career==

Givens was commissioned in the Air Force as a second lieutenant upon graduating from Annapolis in 1952, and received his flight training as a student pilot at the United States Air Force Air Training Command. On August 18, he flew the T-6 Texan—the first advanced trainer he flew with the air force—and continued to fly the plane almost every day. Givens was awarded his wings on February 4, 1953, as one of the top students. As such, he could choose the branch of the air force where he wanted to serve and chose fighter training at Williams Air Force Base in Chandler, Arizona. The group commander was known to be tough on his students, and Givens chose this location so he could be formed into a great fighter pilot.

He started flying the T-28 Trojan at his new assignment, and learned fighter tactics, formation flying, and some aerobatics. Starting on June 3, he flew the two-seater T-33. On October 2, he moved from Chandler to Perrin Air Force Base, in Sherman, Texas, where he continued flying the T-33. In addition to training with the T-33, he began flying the F-86D, an all-weather, single-seat fighter jet with an all-rocket armament, and achieved supersonic speed for the first time while flying it. In 1954, he was promoted to first lieutenant, and was assigned duty in Japan as a flight commander and fighter pilot with the 35th Fighter-Interceptor Group until 1956.

He served as an instructor at the Air Force Interceptor Weapons School from January 1956 to March 1958 and then attended the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California as a captain. Graduating as an outstanding graduate (Class 58B), he became an instructor in the Stability and Control Section.

His next assignment took him to the Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California, where he was a project pilot with Air Development Squadron 4. While there, he not only conducted operational evaluations, but was responsible for compiling and developing the operation procedures and tactics for fleet operation of the F8U-2N—a single-engine, supersonic, carrier-based jet aircraft.

He served as Assistant to the Commandant at the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School from November 1961 to September 1962 and then attended the Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class III), from which he graduated in 1963. When informed of his selection for astronaut training in 1966, he was assigned as Project Officer with USAF SSD Detachment 2 at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas.

He logged more than 3,500 hours flight time; 2,800 hours in jet aircraft.

==NASA career==

Givens was a Project Mercury finalist in 1959, and was one of nineteen astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966 for its fifth astronaut group. After completing basic astronaut training, he was assigned to the Apollo program, and briefly served on the support crew for the first crewed mission, Apollo 1, and then, after the fire, of Apollo 7.

==Death==
On June 6, 1967, Givens was driving his Volkswagen home from a meeting of the Quiet Birdmen fraternal organization, with two other officers, when he missed a sharp, unmarked turn and crashed into a ditch in Pearland, Texas, near the Manned Spacecraft Center. Givens died on the way to the hospital. The two other passengers were injured. At the time of his death, Givens held the rank of major. He was buried at Quanah Memorial Park in his hometown. He was survived by his wife Ada and their three children

<doc id="1254329" wikidata="Q1638891" url="?curid=1254329" title="St Mary's Cathedral, Newcastle upon Tyne">
<text>The Cathedral Church of St Mary is a Catholic cathedral in Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, England. It is the mother church of the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle and seat of the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle. The cathedral, situated on Clayton Street, was designed by Augustus Welby Pugin and built between 1842 and 1844. The cathedral is a grade I listed building and a fine example of the Gothic Revival style of architecture championed by Pugin. 

There is a monument dedicated to Cardinal Basil Hume in the Monument Garden outside of the cathedral, which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2002. St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral is the sixth tallest structure in the city.

==History==
St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Newcastle opened in August 1844, paid for largely through halfpenny subscriptions from the community of poor immigrants on Tyneside. The priest at the mission at Newcastle upon Tyne was William Riddell. The stained glass in the Great East Window, Lady Chapel and Blessed Sacrament Chapel, were done by William Wailes in 1843 to designs provided by Pugin.

By decree of Pope Pius IX on 29 September 1850, the Catholic hierarchy was restored on a regular pattern to England and Wales. Much of what had been known as the Vicariate Apostolic of the Northern District became the new See of Hexham. Bishop William Hogarth was appointed to be the first bishop of the new diocese, and as such, required a church in which to place his seat or cathedra. St Mary&#x27;s was chosen for this purpose and thus it gained the status of a cathedral church in 1850, becoming the first cathedral in Newcastle, as the Anglican St. Nicholas&#x27; Cathedral didn&#x27;t become a cathedral until 1882.

On 21 August 1860, the cathedral was dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption. The name of the see was changed in 1861 to Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle. Since then, eleven further bishops have been installed in St Mary&#x27;s as Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle.

With a bequest from the estate of Elizabeth Dunn, in 1872 a tower and steeple designed by Dunn &amp; Hansom were added.

==Present==
The seat of the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle was vacant after the death of the Right Reverend Kevin John Dunn in March 2008. He served in the post for almost four years, having been consecrated a Bishop and installed on the feast of St Bede the Venerable, 25 May 2004. Seamus Cunningham received his episcopal consecration on 20 March 2009 (feast of St. Cuthbert, the diocese&#x27;s patron), at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral. He is the thirteenth bishop of the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle.

On 21 April 2006 the incumbent Dean, the Reverend Michael Campion, officially left his appointment at the cathedral. He is succeeded by the Reverend Peter Leighton, formerly the Catholic Chaplain to the University of Durham. Under the careful guidance of the Reverend Peter Leighton, the cathedral has undergone a thorough period of renovation restoring much of the beauty of the original design. Phase one of the work was completed in September 2010 and phase two of the work, which included the installation of a new three-manual Kenneth Tickell organ of 46 stops, was completed in February 2013.

On 4 February, Pope Francis announced that Bishop Robert Byrne was to be the next Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle after the resignation of Bishop Seamus Cunningham. Robert Byrne previously served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Birmingham, he is also a member of the Oratory the St. Philip Neri at Birmingham Oratory.

===Controversy===
In 2019, Canon Michael McCoy was appointed dean by Bishop Robert Byrne in succession to Father Dermott Donnelly (brother of TV presenter Declan Donnelly). This was despite multiple issues on his record, including being &quot;subject of safeguarding plans regarding boundaries relevant to working with older teenagers&quot;. On 10 April 2021, McCoy was found dead: following an inquest, it was found that he had killed himself after being informed of historical sexual abuse allegations against him. 

On 22 January 2023, it was reported that the Vatican was investigating rumours of a sex party at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral. In May 2023, it was concluded that &quot;Allegations that lewd parties took place at St
Mary’s Cathedral during the pandemic are simply untrue.&quot; However, there were gatherings for volunteers with wine and takeaways, in contravention to Covid regulations in place at that time.

<text>Applied ecology is a sub-field within ecology that considers the application of the science of ecology to real-world (usually management) questions. It is also described as a scientific field that focuses on the application of concepts, theories, models, or methods of fundamental ecology to environmental problems.

== Concept ==
Applied ecology is an integrated treatment of the ecological, social, and biotechnological aspects of natural resource conservation and management. Applied ecology typically focuses on geomorphology, soils, and plant communities as the underpinnings for vegetation and wildlife (both game and non-game) management.

Applied ecology includes all disciplines that are related to human activities so that it does not only cover agriculture, forestry and fisheries but also global change. It has two study categories. The first involves the outputs or those fields that address the use and management of the environment, particularly for its ecosystem services and exploitable resources. The second are the inputs or those that are concerned with the management strategies or human influences on the ecosystem or biodiversity.

The discipline is often linked to ecological management on the grounds that the effective management of natural ecosystems depends on ecological knowledge. It often uses an ecological approach to solve problems of specific parts of the environment, which can involve the comparison of plausible options (e.g. best management options).

The role of applied science in agricultural production has been brought into greater focus as fluctuations in global food production feed through into prices and availability to consumers.

== Approaches ==
Applied ecologists often use one or more of the following approaches, namely, observation, experimentation, and modeling. For example, a wildlife preservation project could involve: observational studies of the wildlife ecology; experiments to understand causal relationships; and the application of modeling to determine the information beyond the scope of experimentation.

The ecological approach used in applied ecology could include inputs from management strategies such as conservation biology, restoration ecology, global change, ecotoxicology, biomonitoring, biodiversity, environmental policies, and economics, among others. Restoration ecology is a particularly prominent strategy in the discipline since it applies the principles of restoring and repairing damaged ecological systems to their original state.

Like those used in ecological theory, many areas of the discipline employ approaches that are based on simple statistical and analytic models (e.g. spatial models) as well as those with mathematical properties (e.g. matrix models). There is also the digital computer simulation modeling, which is designed to solve statistical ecology problems and to achieve bioeconomic goals such as the forecasting and the evaluation of consequences for specific activities.

Applied ecology also requires human interest, particularly the exercise of judgments of relative values and goals.

== Applications ==
Applied ecology can be applied to the economic development process. The discipline, for example, can be integrated into the national economic planning to comprehensively address environmental concerns since these problems are intersectoral and interdisciplinary in nature.

Aspects of applied ecology include:

* Agro-ecosystem management
* Biodiversity conservation
* Biotechnology
* Conservation biology

* Ecosystem restoration
*Environmental engineering
* Environmental technology
* Habitat management
* Invasive species management
*Landscape use (including development planning)

<doc id="1254337" wikidata="Q5450854" url="?curid=1254337" title="Finnish poetry">
<text>Finnish poetry is the poetry from Finland. It is usually written in the Finnish language or Swedish language, but can also include poetry written in Northern Sámi or other Sámi languages. It has its roots in the early folk music of the area, and still has a thriving presence today.

The retrieval of these old folk songs in the 19th century reinvigorated the countries sense of poetic identity and influenced later poets. The best-known opus of Finnish poetry is the mythical epic &quot;Kalevala&quot;, compiled by Elias Lönnrot. Arguably the Kalevala established Finland in equal status with Sweden as a national language.

Poetry continues to be popular in Finland today and is marked by the individual directions its poets take not limited to traditional schools or ideologies. The contemporary form has taken on a conversational, matter-of-fact description often unmotivated by social, political, or moral agendas. The worlds of everyday life are prominent environments for discussing suffering, distortion of minds and absurd sequences of events.

==History==
Due to Swedish occupation of Finland, from 1150 to 1809, there has not been much documented on the history of Finnish poetry. Only until the 19th century did efforts pioneered by Elias Lönnrot begin in collecting old folkloric and mythical material in the Northern parts of the country. In 1809 Russia annexed Finland and in doing so imposed military sanctions on Sweden. During this time Russian censorship severely limited the publication of Finnish literature and from 1850 to 1860 imperial decree forbad the publication of any work not dealing with politics or religion including folkloric poems, songs, and tales. Authorities claimed this repression of literature was said to be in the protection of the working classes, the only readers of Finnish poetry, against &#x27;nonreligious and nonutilitarian&#x27; motives which would dissuade them from work. A morally protective view continued to be held by publishers aligned with the church up until 1964 when restrictions on printing and publication alleviated.

For the most part Russian culture did not interfere with the thematic representation of Finnish poetry as the Russians encouraged any sort of move which distanced them from their former Swedish rulers. Prior to this between 1766 and 1788 folk poetry saw a revival among upper classes who mostly spoke Swedish. Between 1864 and 1870 Aleksis Kivi, a writer and poet, was the first to publish his work in the Finnish language. Since then, national interest in Finnish poetry has only increased as Finnish Universities became increasingly interested in ancient texts in a conscious and collective movement towards national identity.

In the second half of the 19th century August Ahlqvist, known by his pseudonym Oksanen, also had a considerable influence on Finnish poetry providing strict rules about the forms of linguistic expression in an attempt to match if not rival the literary art of other European languages. These were attempts to abandon the &#x27;beauties&#x27; of the old folk meter in favour of a more &#x27;elegant and precise&#x27; form of meter well known to Europe. However, in subsequent years, during the 1920s and 30&#x27;s, Ahlqvist&#x27;s experimental form of poetry was attacked by many critics and writers because of its rhyme and fixed metric patterns despite Ahlqvist&#x27;s experience writing poetry in the old folk meter. Alhqvist&#x27;s reasoning for advocating the abandonment of the old folk meter came from a pre-emptive fear of Finnish writing sounding anachronistic. He also predicted the importance of stress in future Finnish poetry.

==Folk and oral poetry==
Finnish old folk poetry or oral poetry from the Middle Ages were epic sequences or short songs. They were composed in old Finnish meter, a trochaic tetrameter of eight syllables and their lines are identifiable by two types, a dipodic trochaic line and the broken line. These poems were originally written for Finnish Nobility of the Middle Ages and they reflect universal myths such as the creation of the world from an egg, the Milky Way as being depicted by a humungous tree, and deeds of heroes. However, folksingers had widely not known the meaning of these words until their transcription in the 19th century.

Seclusion from the Roman Empire allowed ancient beliefs and folk poetry to develop undisturbed. Early 12th century poems centre around a violence and action reminiscent of the last days of Rome. Folk epics tell of the expeditions of Vikings, marauding, plundering and abducting foreign women. Courtly ballads include The &quot;Song of Inkeri and Lalmanti&quot;, as well as &quot;Elina&#x27;s death&quot;. An interpretation of the &quot;Legend of Saint George&quot; titled &quot;The Song of the Virgin and the Dragon&quot; was an &#x27;attempt to combine old forms with new subjects&#x27;.

&quot;Sampo&quot; is an early creation story about the adventures of the warrior Lemminkäinen, and the tragic hero Kullervo. These stories, belonging to the larger folk epic &quot;Kalevala&quot;, are mixed with historical as well as mystical themes which has caused speculation on fictionality of the tales&#x27; characters. Many of the lyrics are love songs emotive of Finland&#x27;s rural landscapes pulling imagery from its forests, lakes and occasionally village life.

In the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, clergymen hoped to stamp out the songs of old folk poetry due to its pagan origins despite efforts of Bishop Mikael Agricola, who introduced the Reformation into Finland in, in an effort to preserve the language of his people. In the preface to Jacobus Finno&#x27;s hymn book of 1582 the Church&#x27;s justification for its disdain towards old folk poetry seemed to be &#x27;Because there were no sacred songs for the people to learn, they began to practise pagan rites and to sing shameful, lewd and foolish songs&#x27;.

Two centuries later attitudes towards folk poetry changed after scholar Henrick Gabriel Porthan in 1766 began research collecting old material. His advocation inspired serious scholarship among fellow teachers and students until in 1789, a friend Christfrid Ganander published &quot;Mythologia Fennica&quot;, &#x27;an encyclopaedia of phenomena associated with folk beliefs and poetry&#x27;. Studying folk poetry has become a main resource in understanding and reconstructing Finland&#x27;s past. By the 1820s expeditions to collect such material were already entering the borders of Russia. A leading figure in this part of history was Lönnrot, a collector who&#x27;d made contact with old folk singers taking notes of their poems. His idea was that the manner of these songs was fragmented in the sense that the Greek epics Illiad and Odyssey were believing that he could combine several epic sequences into one long poem. This process included the removal of unnecessary Christian imagery and the names of people and places in relation to the history of old folklore.

Collection of old folk poetry has continued since the 19th century in the spirit of National Romanticism. The collection of epic poetry was favoured above everything else as they were deemed part of an &#x27;expansive oral narrative which one could still access&#x27;. The authenticity of these findings has continuously been debated as often national romantics had to creatively fill in the gaps left by the fragments they had found. However, today&#x27;s scholars are less concerned with authenticity as defined by the folklore&#x27;s origins and are rather concerned with bringing the pieces of Finland&#x27;s poetic history together. The material retrieved from these expeditions have since been documented by modern scholars as &#x27;shared experience dialogues&#x27; consisting of lyrics, proverbs and laments that refer to a broader &#x27;discussion&#x27; between rune singers, collectors, and modern observers over the course of Finland&#x27;s poetic history.

== 1960s ==
Post WWII Finland underwent an urbanisation which changed poets&#x27; relationships with culture and nature, specifically the forest. Like much of Europe and the western world, 1960&#x27;s Finland saw an artistic period of challenging old taboo&#x27;s where its poetry become heavily politicised. Though there also existed a school of poets who avoided politics and social idioms altogether. Their use of free rhythm, lack of rhyme and symbolic imagery showed a scepticism towards worldly politics in favour of honing lyrical expression.

After the war era of the 1930s, Finland&#x27;s poetry mainly consisted of lines of prayer and mourning. However, as the turmoil settled in later decades its poetry became one of consideration, a reflection on past conflict as well as the international conflict beginning to rise with the Cold War where Finland found itself between powers from both East and West. This change in poetic attitude was in direct relation to the increase of Western consumer products alongside increases in income and mobility which gave well-to-do Finns the luxury of indulgent free time (City 514). The rapid urbanisation that also began in this period also brought forth buildings bearing no historical roots to folkloric history disrupting both a sense of cultural identity and social cohesion within these new cities. Nonetheless, the rise of East/ West politics and the discussion of international relations inspired younger more ambitious poets whose thinking predominantly came from Leftist Marxism.

Modernist poets, Paavo Haavikko and Pentti Saarikoski, reacted against the war generation drawing influence from T.S Eliot and other Finland-Swedish modernists. Their writing reflects historical parallels among other nations who had lost the war. The aesthetic of these poets was shaped using experimentation, introducing techniques such as collage and montage in order to what Veivo says, &#x27;open the space of the text to foreign voices and materials and to connect with everyday life, politics and a wide range of social discourses&#x27;. This opened the poetic form to the creolization of language and allowing for elements, linguistic as well as social and political, to contaminate and merge with the poetry regardless of order. Some of the poetry from this time was also written to be published alongside popular articles of varying topics from economy, politics to community statistics on alcohol consumption.

The &#x27;new poetry&#x27; of the 60s was radically different to the poetry of earlier decades. Abandoning the viewpoint that contemplation should be made from a distance and the old war themed trope of a &#x27;no man&#x27;s land&#x27;, 60s Finnish poetry sought to align itself with the humanitarian movements happening in other countries. They embraced the bohemian lifestyle of the beatniks and advocated avant-garde forms of experimentation.

The relationship between the poet and their environment whether discorded or harmonious is visible throughout the 60s. With suburban housing complexes being both built on the edge of cities and deep within the forest, the relationship between people and their environment became framed and blocked by modern infrastructure. Parking lots, highways, flats and random objects of modernity littered the scenes of once quiet agrarian communities. Many poets felt displaced by this rapid change of scenery whilst others embraced it. Much of the discussion took place in Finland&#x27;s capitol Helsinki where a number of poets based their poems.

In Matti Paavilainen&#x27;s Kaupunki enemmän kuin  kohtalo (City  more than  destiny,  1972), he writes: &#x27;Everything you see is an answer to the question you didn&#x27;t have to make&#x27;, identifying the poets connection to the environment while noticing his discordance in terms of its development. Pentti Saarikoski&#x27;s &quot;Minä asun Helsingissä&quot; (&quot;I live in Helsinki&quot;, 1962) similarly states: &quot;Helsinki my  City  remains in  my  mind, in  good  order /  and  when I  am  gone, it  still  moves like  a  tree&quot;. Finnish poets used Parallelisms such as these in a step-by-step processes of recognizing their own identity within a new modern state.  

==Recent history==
British poet and translator Herbert Lomas has written much about Finnish literature. In his review of &quot;Lomas&#x27; Contemporary Finnish Poetry&quot;, Binham highlights Lomas&#x27; views on &#x27;the significance of poetry to Finn&#x27;s, who &quot;turn to it for solace, inspiration, stimulation to think about themselves, extension of experience and the shaping spirit&quot;&#x27;. Contemporary poetry covers a variety of themes mainly concerned with disparity in modern society.

Although they depict similar worlds in their poetry, Contemporary poets have never used their ancestors as models. Rather they&#x27;ve only borrowed fragments such as the old metre in their works. Though some modernist uses of old folk metre came off as anachronistic, apart from Eino Leino who was one of the only poets to make use of it correctly, in versus consisting of a blend of both historical and the mythological. This success may be attributed to the fact the Leino had also perfected the form of other European metres much like his predecessors.

Sirkka Turkka&#x27;s poetry, through the construction of her language, addresses the dualities of existence. Eeva Kilpi, is also an accomplished poet who is also praised for her autobiographical novels set after World War II. Due to the apparent neglect of women during the retrieving of old folk runes during the 19th century there has since been a rise in recognising women poets in Finland. Many of the lyrics of these women dealt with everyday &#x27;griefs and joys&#x27; often depicting the poet as a solitary soul set in a rural landscape littered by lakes and trees (Brit) Today&#x27;s contemporary poets deal with themes such as domestic and social life as well as the corruption of these environments within families further associating today&#x27;s poets with their old folk predecessors.

<text>Hey! Spring of Trivia is the name given by Spike TV to the show , a Japanese comedy game show on Fuji TV.

==Concept==
&quot;Trivia&quot; consists of a series of video segments that introduce and confirm the validity of unusual trivia. Past trivia has included exploding erasers, spiders affected by caffeine, and insects that cannot be killed. Most of the trivia on the show is sent in by viewers. A celebrity panel of five judges (ten in special episodes) evaluate each video segment and votes on how interesting it is by pushing a every time they are astonished. ( is the Japanese interjection for expressing genuine surprise, equivalent to a mix of the English interjections &quot;Really?&quot; and &quot;Wow!&quot;.) The total of all &quot;Hey&quot;s collected during the presentation of the trivia (maximum of 20 per judge) is then used as the indicator for the degree of surprise of this trivia. For every &quot;Hey&quot; a piece of trivia gets, the trivia submitter receives 100 yen. Should it receive a perfect score of 100 Heys (200 in special episodes), the trivia submitter receives 100,000 yen (200,000 in special episodes). To date no piece of trivia has received 100 Heys.

At some point in the show, there is a segment called . Viewers submit hypothetical questions intended to produce answers in the form of new trivia; &quot;Trivia&quot; then &quot;go[es] to great lengths to answer them.&quot; Tamori (referred to as &quot;Chairman Tamori&quot; in the English dubbed version) evaluates the Seed of Trivia by pulling a lever. The Seed of Trivia&#x27;s grade is shown as a flower. is the highest of grades. Past examples of &quot;Seed of Trivia&quot; segments have included the fastest Japanese baseball mascots, the brand of ramen containing the greatest net noodle length per package, and which form of barbecue lions prefer most.

As of 2005, there is a new segment called . This is where they take a trivia sent in by a viewer that turned out to be false and sink it in a sort of bog. Additionally, they say, &quot;If you use this trivia, you might be called,&quot; and then they always show a cute girl (Tamaki Ogawa) doing some date-like activity and saying, at the end of the segment.

At the end of the show, host Norito Yashima gives out , a brain shaped trophy that has a melon bread inside that is in the shape of a brain, to the sender of the highest rated trivia. Co-host Katsumi Takahashi gives out – a smaller version of The Golden Brain with the same shape but with no melon bread inside – to the sender of his favorite trivia (announced as &quot;MFT - My Favorite Trivia&quot;). In 2005, small color-appropriate banners were added to the awards, and in 2006, the awards began featuring a small analog clock.

==History==
&quot;Trivia&quot; has been running in Japan since October 7, 2002, first as a low-budget program after midnight (with initially much more obscene and sexual trivia than afterwards). Its increasing cult status (the show obtained viewership ratings just above 5%) made Fuji TV shift the broadcast time to prime time July 2, 2003.

On November 4, 2004 Fuji TV announced that twenty six episodes of &quot;Trivia&quot; would be adapted for broadcast in the United States on the cable network Spike TV (now Paramount Network). The network began airing the slightly edited English dubbed version of the show on November 11, with the broadcast ending in May 2005. The editing included the removal of certain culturally specific trivia pieces such as those referring to Japanese history and actors. The shorter run time was made up for by adding trivia pieces from other episodes. Unlike Spike TV&#x27;s other Japanese show &quot;MXC&quot;, the English dialogue was mostly based on the original Japanese utterances and texts, although it was often exaggerated in a comical manner. Spike had planned to produce an American version of the show premiering in Spring 2005, but that version never materialized and the network decided against ordering more episodes of the English dub.

<doc id="1254376" wikidata="Q351972" url="?curid=1254376" title="João Pinto">
<text>João Manuel Vieira Pinto (; born 19 August 1971) is a Portuguese retired professional footballer who played mostly as a forward.

Blessed with playmaking and goalscoring ability, he made his name mostly at a domestic level and as a key figure in the Portuguese national team&#x27;s &quot;Golden Generation&quot;, collecting 151 caps and scoring 45 goals across all levels (81/23 for the senior team alone) and representing the country at the 2002 World Cup and two European Championships.

At the club level, Pinto started his career with Boavista, but it was mainly associated with two of the biggest clubs in the country, Benfica and Sporting CP, with which he won one Primeira Liga each for a total of six major titles. Over 19 top-division seasons, he played 476 matches and netted 117 goals.

==Career==
As a youth, Pinto played for Bairro do Falcão (where he was born, in Campanhã, Porto&#x27;s east side) and Águias da Areosa FC, finishing his development at Boavista F.C. after joining its academy as a 12-year-old. Early on, he impressed with his speed and ball control, and was subsequently one of the brightest stars in Portugal&#x27;s wins in the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Riyadh and Lisbon, being one of three players ever to have been on the winning side in this competition twice along with goalkeeper Fernando Brassard (whom however did not play in the first tournament) and Argentinian Sergio Agüero. Additionally, he made his Primeira Liga debut at only 17.

Pinto&#x27;s performance in the first youth competition earned him a transfer to Atlético Madrid in 1990, but he was placed instead with the reserve team. After a forgettable season he rejoined Boavista, appeared in every match, scored eight goals and won the Taça de Portugal, in a final against city rivals FC Porto. Shortly after, he signed for S.L. Benfica.

Whilst with Benfica, Pinto&#x27;s career was threatened in late 1992 by a collapsed lung during an international match for Portugal in Scotland for the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, eventually recovering but being unable to help his team win the title. However, the next season, he played arguably his best football there, his best moment coming in the Lisbon derby against Sporting CP, where he scored three goals and was on the play of the remaining three in a 6–3 win at the Estádio José Alvalade; this result proved to be decisive for the club&#x27;s clinching of the 1994 national championship.

Dubbed &quot;The Golden Boy&quot;, Pinto won captaincy from veteran António Veloso after the latter&#x27;s retirement in 1995, but was unable to win a national title again. Following a wage dispute with president João Vale e Azevedo, he was released from contract weeks before the UEFA Euro 2000 (making him the only free agent in the competition), where he helped the national team reach the semi-finals after scoring eight goals during the qualifying stage, netting through a header against England in a 3–2 comeback win in the group stage on 13 June 2000; he was also selected for the Euro 1996 tournament.

Subsequently, Pinto had several offers from abroad, eventually agreeing to a four-year deal at Sporting. After a relatively poor season in 2000–01, the &quot;Lions&quot; acquired four-time Portuguese Golden Boot winner Mário Jardel, and Pinto returned to his golden years in a magnificent run which ended with the claiming of his second title; named the &quot;father of the team&quot; by the Brazilian, took part in all but one game and scored nine goals.

Although a highly talented player, Pinto was also known for a series of red cards for aggression and bad tackles. His feud with Porto player and national teammate Paulinho Santos lasted for years, and both would be frequently ejected after hitting each other; he also stirred some controversy when he assaulted a fireman in the league fixture at Rio Ave F.C. on 20 September 1997.

The lowest point, however, was when Pinto hit Argentine referee Ángel Sánchez who had sent him off after a bad tackle early into the 1–0 loss to hosts South Korea in the third group game of the 2002 World Cup. He was suspended for six months.

Pinto ended his Portugal career with 81 caps and 23 goals. Never recovering fully from the World Cup incident, he failed to impress in the following seasons, when Sporting failed to reach the top two spots, and in 2004 he was released from contract, returning to Boavista. Although he was close to signing with Al-Hilal FC of Saudi Arabia in the January transfer window, he remained with his first professional club.

After a second season carrying Boavista&#x27;s squad (who almost qualified for the UEFA Cup, with him scoring nine league goals and receiving numerous Player of the match awards), Pinto accepted the invitation of S.C. Braga&#x27;s board in July 2006, signing for one year. He netted twice in 24 appearances in an eventual fourth-place finish for the Minho side, and renewed his link for the 2007–08 campaign; however, during February 2008, he trained with Toronto FC of Major League Soccer and, later that month, announced the termination of his contract at Braga, retiring shortly after aged 36.

Subsequently, Pinto worked with the Portuguese Football Federation in directorial capacities.

==Personal life==

Still in his teens, Pinto had two children from his first marriage to Carla Baía; the elder, Tiago, first played professionally with C.D. Olivais e Moscavide. In 2008 he married television presenter Marisa Cruz, with the couple divorcing five years later.

Pinto&#x27;s younger brother, Sérgio, was also a footballer, having competed almost exclusively in the lower leagues of Portugal and one year in England.

<text>The Battle of Rancagua, also known in Chile as the Disaster of Rancagua, occurred on October 1, 1814, to October 2, 1814, when the Spanish Army under the command of Mariano Osorio defeated the Chilean forces led by Bernardo O’Higgins. This put an end to the Chilean Patria Vieja and it was the decisive step of the Spanish military Reconquest of Chile.

==Background==
After the signing of the British-broken Treaty of Lircay, that established a comprehensive truce between the patriot government of Chile and the Cortes de Cádiz through the royalist Viceroyalty of Perú, some factions within the pro-independence movement perceived this diplomatic approach to Spain as a treason. On 25 July 1814, the radicals overthrew Supreme Director Francisco de la Lastra and appointed Jose Miguel Carrera as the head of a provisional junta. When the Viceroy of Peru, José Fernando de Abascal, heard about the revolt in Chile, he sent an expedition of Spanish soldiers and royalists to defeat the rebellion. O&#x27;Higgins, whose position towards the revolt was unclear, heard about the besieged troops in Rancagua and went with his army of 1,000 patriots, to reinforce Juan Carrera forces at Rancagua. Outnumbered and with barely enough supplies, O&#x27;Higgins did not retreat and sealed the fate of his army.

==The Battle==
The battle occurred on the morning of October 1, 1814, outside the town of Rancagua. The Chilean forces had occupied the town prior to this confrontation and ultimately were surrounded by Osorio’s forces who advanced towards the town. The reason for occupying the town was its strategic importance in the defense of the Chilean capital, Santiago. The battle was fierce and the Spanish had an elite force of soldiers known as “Talaveras” who were veterans from the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. As the fighting continued onward to the evening, the Spanish forces decided to set fire to the town. With casualties growing, the Chilean forces requested reinforcements from the capital city of Santiago, which was 87 Kilometers north of Rancagua. Ultimately the request failed, which forced the Chilean army to disperse and flee to the countryside and wilderness. After this victory, the Spanish army continued on to Santiago, crushed the Chilean Government and instituted their brutal Reconquista of Chile.

==Aftermath==
After the Battle of Rancagua, the Spanish captured Santiago within a few days, which marked the beginning of the Reconquista of South America. This battle became a stain on Chile&#x27;s national memory as it was a time when the nation was lost and the people feared that their struggle for independence was in vain. The people fled elsewhere in South America as refugees to escape the violence the Spanish would have meted out to the rebels.

<doc id="1254391" wikidata="Q1116528" url="?curid=1254391" title="Siege of Nara">
<text>The alternatively known as the Nanto Arson Campaign in Japan is an event which took place on January 15th 1181 (December 28th 1180 in the Jishō calendar), following Prince Mochihito and Minamoto no Yorimasa&#x27;s defeat and subsequent death to the Taira clan, after which the Taira forces burnt down the Miidera temple (which had sheltered the anti-Taira forces), before moving on to Nara, where they &quot;set fire to the monastic complexes of Kōfuku-ji and Tōdai-ji.&quot;

== Background ==
In June, after the suppression of Mochihito&#x27;s army, the Taira clan punished Mii-dera Temple, which had been involved in the rebellion, by prohibiting it from participating in court sessions, dismissing its priests, and confiscating the temple&#x27;s territory. Kōfuku-ji (one of the powerful Seven Great Temples in Nara) was not punished as severely as Mii-dera. At the end of the year, the people of Mii-dera and Kofuku-ji joined the uprising of the Ōmi Minamoto clan and others in the , which finally led the Taira to turn the tables on Kofuku-ji when Taira Shigehira attacked and burned down Mii-dera.

Nara was regarded as a rebel against the throne because it had sided with Miidera and received Prince Takakura when he led the revolt. Once the temples at Nara had heard of this, they rose up like &quot;a swarm of angry bees&quot;.

== Battle ==
Taira no Kiyomori first sent with 500 soldiers to Nara. Kiyomori instructed Kanayasu to settle the matter in as peaceful a manner as possible and sent him off lightly armed. However, the monks of Nara captured and beheaded over 60 of Kaneyasu&#x27;s men and lined them up at the edge of Sarusawa Pond, causing Kanayasu to return to Kiyomori. A now infuriated Kiyomori sent Taira no Shigehira and Tomomori, both sons of Kiyomori, to siege Nara with &quot;about 40,000 horsemen&quot; (However, the The Tale of the Heike is known for exaggerating numbers).

The monks, numbering around 7,000 men, began digging ditches in the roads, and built many forms of improvised defenses. They fought primarily with bow &amp; arrow, and &quot;naginata&quot;, while the Taira were on horseback, giving them a great advantage.

Soon the Taira forces arrived, after which they divided into two, attacking the two defensive positions the monks had built. By nightfall, both positions had been broken through. Despite the monks&#x27; strategic defenses, their enemy succeeded in defeating even the best monks of Nara, and Shigehara ordered nearly every temple in the city to be lit, and the fire spread quickly due to the winds at the time. Soon the elderly and young (numbering roughly 1,000) began to flee into the , but soon it was destroyed by fire too, with the Kofuku-ji falling aswell. Only the Shōsōin survived.

The Heike Monogatari laments the destruction of the Tōdai-ji&#x27;s &quot;Daibutsu&quot; (Great Buddha statue) and Nara:
== Aftermath ==
In all, 3,500 non-combants died in the burning of Nara, with another 1,000 warrior monks, some of whose heads where hung on the gates of the Hannya-ji, while some were carried back to Kyoto. Kiyomori alone was greatly rejoiced at the news, while the Empress, and the Retired Emperor all sorrowed at the destruction of so many temples, though somewhat pleased that the rebellious monks of Nara were exterminated. The courtiers had decided that the heads of the monks should be displayed on public scaffolds as punishment. However, they did not go through with any decisions regarding the tragic destruction of the Nara temples. In the writings of the Emperor Shōmu it says:&quot;When my temple of Kofukuji is prosperous the whole Empire shall be prosperous, and when my temple falls to ruin the Empire will decline also&quot;Due to this, many now believed the fall of the Empire was inevitable.

<doc id="1254412" wikidata="Q4230" url="?curid=1254412" title="Union of South American Nations">
<text>The Union of South American Nations (USAN), sometimes also referred to as the South American Union, abbreviated in Spanish as UNASUR and in Portuguese as UNASUL, is an intergovernmental regional organization. It was set up by Hugo Chavez to counteract the influence of the United States in the region. 

The UNASUR Constitutive Treaty was signed on 23 May 2008, at the Third Summit of Heads of State, held in Brasília, Brazil. According to the Constitutive Treaty, the Union&#x27;s headquarters will be located in Quito, Ecuador. On 1 December 2010, Uruguay became the ninth state to ratify the UNASUR treaty, thus giving the union full legality. As the Constitutive Treaty entered into force on 11 March 2011, UNASUR became a legal entity during a meeting of Foreign Ministers in Mitad del Mundo, Ecuador, where they had laid the foundation stone for the Secretariat Headquarters.

In April 2018, six countries—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru—suspended their membership, and in August of the same year, Colombia announced its withdrawal from the organization. In March 2019, Brazil&#x27;s president Jair Bolsonaro announced his country&#x27;s intention to withdraw from the organization. On 13 March 2019, Ecuador announced that it would withdraw from the organization. The president of the country, Lenin Moreno, also asked the bloc to return the headquarters building of the organization, based in Quito. On 10 March 2020, Uruguay officially announced its withdrawal from the organization. Brazil rejoined on 5 May 2023.

In January 2019, amid growing concern about Venezuela&#x27;s Nicolás Maduro, a new group, PROSUL/PROSUR, was advanced to counteract the influence of what countries in the region call a dictatorship in Venezuela. A Chilean summit to organize PROSUL was held on 22 March 2019, and excluded Venezuela. Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Guyana and Suriname were invited to join the new regional bloc.

==Overview==
At the Third South American Summit on 8 December 2004, presidents or representatives from 12 South American nations signed the &quot;Cusco Declaration&quot;, a two-page statement of intent announcing the foundation of the South American Community. Panama and Mexico attended the signing ceremony as observers in Brazil.

The mechanics of the new entity came out of the First South American Community of Nations Heads of State Summit, which was held in Brasília on 29–30 September 2005. An important operating condition of UNASUR is that no new institutions will be created in the first phase, so as not to increase bureaucracy, and the community will use the existing institutions belonging to the previous trade blocs.

==History==

===Background===


Between the 15th and 19th centuries, the Spanish and Portuguese colonization brought about the establishment and development of colonial empires in the Americas that integrated politically, economically and culturally vast extensions of the continent each with their respective metropolis.

Since the Spanish American wars of independence a trend towards the political integration of the newly born republics of Hispanic America became strong in the thinking of several independence leaders, influenced in turn by the Spanish Enlightenment and the French and American revolutions. A notable early exponent of this trend was Francisco de Miranda, who envisioned a federated republic encompassing all of Hispanic America, which he called &quot;Colombia&quot;.

The independence war efforts saw the concurrence of integrated armies composed by Spanish Americans of diverse regions on both sides of the conflict (v.g. Patriots and Royalists), and fighting all over the territories of many future nations. For example, the Army of the Andes which was gathered in the United Provinces of the River Plate fought in Chile, Peru and Ecuador, and later integrated with Simón Bolívar&#x27;s Army (which itself included troops of future Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador) to further fight in Peru and the Upper Peru.

By the 1820s, the main proponent of a federation of the newly born republics was Simón Bolívar, although this idea was shared by many notable contemporaries, including José de San Martín and Bernardo de Monteagudo, under either republican or constitutional monarchical governments. In 1826, Bolívar summoned a conference to be held in Panama, which was to be known as the &quot;Amphictyonic&quot; Congress of Panama because of the parallelism with the Hellenic Amphictyonic League. The Congress was attended by Gran Colombia (including present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador), the Federal Republic of Central America (including present-day Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala), the United Mexican States, and Peru. The ostensible intention was to form a defensive league that could prevent foreign expansionism and foster the interests of the Spanish American republics. The Congress&#x27; conclusions, however, were not ratified by the participants, except for Gran Colombia. Soon after, both Gran Colombia and the United Provinces of Central America fell apart and the whole of Hispanic America was balkanized by competing national governments.

By the 1990s, however, Brazil had consolidated as the most powerful country in South America (accounting for half of the regional GDP) and began to promote the notion of a united South America (a new regional framing) where Brasília would be pivotal. The project did not take hold until the United States&#x27; foreign policy priorities turned to other regions in the 2000s.

===Formation===
The complete integration between the Andean Community and the Mercosur nations was formalized during the meeting of South American heads of state that took place on 23 May 2008 in Brasília.

In the 2004 South American Summit, representatives of twelve South American nations signed the Cuzco Declaration, a two-page letter of intent announcing the establishment of the then-named &quot;South American Community of Nations&quot;. Panama and Mexico were present as observers. The leaders announced the intention of modeling the new community in the mold of the European Union, including a unified passport, a parliament and, eventually, a single currency. The then Secretary General of the Andean Community Allan Wagner speculated that an advanced union such as the EU should be possible within the next fifteen years.

After Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela, Uruguay became the ninth nation to ratify the constitutive treaty of the organization on 1 December 2010, thus completing the minimum number of ratifications Necessary for the entry into force of the Treaty, on 11 March 2011 With the entry into force of the Treaty, UNASUR became a legal entity during the Summit Ministers of Foreign Affairs, in Mitad del Mundo, Ecuador, where the cornerstone was laid for the headquarters of the General Secretariat of the Union.

===Naming===

On 28 December 2005, Chilean former foreign minister Ignacio Walker proposed that the Union&#x27;s former designation, the South American Community of Nations, abbreviated as CSN, be changed to &quot;South American Union&quot;; nevertheless, many members responded that that proposal had already been rejected to prevent confusion since its acronym of U.S.A. (Spanish: &quot;Unión Sudamericana&quot;) would be easily confused for the United States of America. In the press, the phrase &quot;United States of South America&quot; was bandied about as an analogy to the United States to reflect the economic and political power that the union would have on the world stage.

The name was finally changed on 16 April 2007 to &quot;Union of South American Nations&quot;. The new name was jointly agreed by all member states during the first day of meeting at the First South American Energy Summit, held at Isla Margarita, Venezuela.

=== Leadership crisis ===
After Colombian Ernesto Samper completed his term as Secretary General in January 2017, the UNASUR governments have been unable to reach consensus on the organization&#x27;s future leadership. Venezuela, with the support of Bolivia and Suriname, has blocked the nomination of Argentine diplomat José Octavio Bordón.

In August 2017, six members of UNASUR—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru—joined in forming the Lima Group, a coalition of Western Hemisphere nations that repudiates the Venezuela government of Nicolás Maduro as antidemocratic. In February 2018, Maduro was disinvited from the Summit of the Americas hosted by Peru (held in Lima in April 2018). In response, Bolivia&#x27;s president Evo Morales urged UNASUR to defend Venezuela, stating &quot;UNASUR should call an emergency meeting and enforce the sovereignty of a brotherly people.&quot; Morales acceded to the rotating role of president pro tempore of UNASUR on 17 April 2018.

On 20 April 2018, six countries—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru—announced that they would suspend their own membership for a year until the regional group became more organized. Chilean Foreign Minister Roberto Ampuero stated that the organization &quot;isn&#x27;t getting anywhere, there is no integration&quot; and that &quot;We can&#x27;t be throwing this money to an institution that doesn&#x27;t work.&quot; A briefing sent to the Brazilian cabinet stated that the countries share the view that Bolivia&#x27;s leadership of the block has been ineffective. Paraguayan Foreign Minister stated that his country&#x27;s objection concerned the failure to put a new Secretary General in place, and the need to make the organization less ideological, but did not reflect negatively on Bolivia&#x27;s leadership. Bolivian Foreign Minister Fernando Huanacuni called an emergency meeting for May 2018 to attempt to resolve the crisis.

=== Countries renouncing the treaty ===
==== Colombia ====
On 28 August 2018, Colombian president Iván Duque announced that foreign minister Carlos Holmes had officially notified UNASUR of their intention to leave the bloc within the next 6 months, denouncing it as an institution created by Hugo Chávez to sideline existing international treaties and referring to it as an accomplice to what they referred to as the dictatorship in Venezuela. However, in 2023 the country announced that it would rejoin UNASUR.

==== Brazil ====
On 7 March 2019 Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro announced that Brazil would withdraw from UNASUR and join the newly created PROSUR. Following the 2022 Brazilian general election, newly elected president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva signalled his intention to rejoin UNASUR. It rejoined effective 5 May 2023.

==== Ecuador ====
On 13 March 2019 Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno announced that Ecuador would withdraw from UNASUR and join the newly created PROSUR. Moreno also asked the bloc to return the headquarters building of the organization, based in Quito, so it can be handed over to PROSUR.

==== Argentina ====
On 12 April 2019 Argentine president Mauricio Macri announced that Argentina would withdraw from UNASUR and join the newly created PROSUR. However, the country rejoined UNASUR in April 2023. Following the 2023 Argentine general election, new president Javier Milei raised the possibility of Argentina withdrawing again.

==== Uruguay ====
On 11 March 2020 Uruguayan president Luis Lacalle Pou announced that Uruguay would withdraw from UNASUR.

==Structure==

The presidents of each member nation had an annual meeting, which was the top political mandate. The first meeting was held in Brasília on 29 and 30 September 2005. The second meeting was held in Cochabamba, Bolivia, on 8 and 9 December 2006. The third meeting was held in Brasília – this meeting should have taken place in Cartagena (Colombia), but was postponed because of tension between Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. It was at this meeting that UNASUR was formalized and in which the Constitutive Treaty of the organization was signed.

The foreign ministers of each country met once every six months. They made concrete proposals for action and executive decision. The Permanent Representative Committee of the President of Mercosur and the Director of the Mercosur Department, the Secretary General of the Andean Community, the Secretary General of ALADI and the Permanent Secretaries of any institution for regional cooperation and integration, Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, among others, also attended these meetings.

On 9 December 2005, the Strategic Reflection Commission on the South American Integration Process was created. It consists of 12 members, whose function is to elaborate proposals that will help in the process of integration among the South American nations. These proposals were to be made at the 2nd UNASUR Meeting (2006).

The South American Parliament will be located in Cochabamba, Bolivia.

The executive committee, created at the 2nd UNASUR Meeting, was transformed into the Political Commission or Council of Deputies, in accordance with the Decisions of the Political Dialogue. The text prepared by heads of state to form UNASUR was approved at the 3rd UNASUR Meeting in Brasília on 23 May 2008. This meeting was scheduled to take place in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 24–28 January 2008, but was postponed because of tensions between Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.

===Secretary General===

A Secretary General is the legal representative of the Secretariat in Quito, Ecuador. Former Ecuadorian president Rodrigo Borja was nominated to this position but resigned a few days before the formation of the USAN in May 2008. On 4 May, Néstor Kirchner of Argentina was appointed as the first Secretary General, despite resistance from Colombia, Uruguay, and Peru. After the death of Néstor Kirchner in 2010, there was a period of time when the position went unfilled, which eventually ended when María Emma Mejía Vélez was elected in March 2011. After Ernesto Samper completed his term in January 2017, UNASUR members have been unable to come to consensus on a successor.

===Presidency pro tempore===

The temporary presidency will be governed by a year and will be rotating among the member countries between each UNASUR meeting. According to the document &quot;Decisions of the Political Dialogue&quot;, which was signed during the 1st South American Energy Meeting, a permanent general cabinet will be created and headquartered in Quito, Ecuador.

Argentine Deputy Economy Minister Roberto Feletti said that the council would study measures to strengthen regional trade in national currencies without the use of dollar. &quot;We have reached an agreement on three axes of work and one of them is to move forward with multilateral payment mechanisms, to sustain trade and protect the volumes of reserves,&quot; Feletti said, noting that trade between countries in the region moves 120 billion dollars annually. &quot;The use of national currencies, excluding the dollar, protects reserves and increases trade because there are lower transaction rates.&quot; He also detailed plans of the technical groups focused on the development and strengthening of Development Banks, such as CAF – Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean and the Bank of the South. He explained that the technicians will review the Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR), aiming at in order to give greater capacity to intervene to the governments of the bloc in case of speculative attacks against currency or sovereign debt.

===Council of South American Defense===
The creation of a Council of South American Defense was proposed by Brazil and discussed for the first time at a summit of the South American presidents in April 2008. The project was extensively discussed throughout 2008. The then Brazilian Defense Minister, Nelson Jobim, said in April 2008 that the council would be formed after the &quot;political&quot; decision of the presidents who participated in the launch of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) on 23 May 2008.

On 15 December 2008, at the extraordinary UNASUR summit, the creation of the South American Defense Council was finally approved.

It is also a consultation and consensus body concerning health, which intends to delve deeply into relevant themes and strengthen public policies aimed at improving the living conditions of the inhabitants of the South American continent.

Since health is an essential right to all human beings and all societies, and it is also a vital component for the development of mankind, the Health Council seeks political and social acceptance regarding the issue, proposing health to be seen as an important booster of cooperation and integration of the bloc&#x27;s nations, intensifying the coordination of such nations and respecting diversity and interculturalism in the region.

The Health Council aims to strengthen, by establishing a South American political institution with expertise in sanitary issues, the development of solutions to challenges that transcend national borders, developing values and mutual interests among the neighboring countries, thus facilitating the interaction of the Member States health authorities through the exchange of knowledge and technology in the region.
The South American Health Council (SHC) is composed of the Health Ministries of Unasur Member States. In order to achieve the council&#x27;s goals, the Coordinating Committee – responsible for preparing propositions of Agreements and Resolutions – was created.

== Demographics ==

At its peak of membership, UNASUR had a total population of 410 million inhabitants and a rate of population growth of about 0.6% per year. There were several different ecological regions such as tropical forests, the Atacama Desert and the icy portions of Patagonia. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly Spaniards, Portuguese and Italians), Africans and indigenous. There is a high percentage of mestizos that vary greatly in composition according to each place. There is also a minor population of Asians, especially in Brazil. The two main languages are by far Spanish and Portuguese, followed by French, English and Dutch in smaller numbers. Economically, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia are the wealthiest and most developed nations in the continent.
=== Languages ===
Portuguese, Spanish, English and Dutch are the official languages of UNASUR. Spanish is the official language of Bolivia and Venezuela. Dutch is the official language of Suriname; English is the official language of Guyana.

Indigenous languages of UNASUR include Wayuunaiki in northwestern Venezuela (Zulia) and Guaraní, Quechua and Aymara in Bolivia. At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages.

Other languages found in UNASUR include, Hindustani and Javanese in Suriname; Italian in Venezuela. Arabic speakers, often of Lebanese, Syrian, or Arab Palestinian descent, can be found in Arab communities in Venezuela.

=== Religion ===
An estimated 87% of South Americans are Christians (69% Roman Catholic, 18% other Christian denominations mainly Traditional Protestants and Evangelicals but also Orthodoxy), accounting for 20% of Christians worldwide.

Due to the immigration of Indonesian workers, Suriname and Guyana have a large Hindu and Muslim community. Also Kardecist Spiritism can be found in several countries along with Afro-American religions. 
== Economy ==

The economy of UNASUR is divided between the mineral extractivism in the Amazon region and the agriculture present in practically all its States. Industrialization is of medium level to high in diverse regions, although very strong the presence of local industries of origin Foreign (multinational). The extraction and export of oil is notable in Venezuela, which owns the largest world reserves. Bolivia stands out for the production of natural gas, with important reserves of this matter that in recent years have led to what has been known as the &quot;Gas War.&quot;

The highest nominal GDP in 2018 was Venezuela (62nd worldwide) with 96,328 billion dollars, followed by Bolivia (92nd at the global level) with 41,833 billion dollars.

The highest GDP in 2018 was in Venezuela (52nd worldwide) with 330,984 billion dollars, and Bolivia (88th worldwide) with 88,866 billion dollars.

The highest GDP per capita in 2018 was held by Suriname with 13,876, followed by Venezuela with 12,388. In terms of nominal per capita GDP, the ranking was headed by Venezuela with US$6,890, and Suriname with US$5,869.

===Common Market===
One of the initiatives of Unasur is the creation of a common market, starting with the elimination of tariffs for products considered non-sensitive until 2014 and for sensitive products until 2019.

The Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America is currently underway, with investments estimated at US$38 billion from the Inter-American Development Bank, the Andean Development Corporation, the National Bank for Economic and Social Development and the Financial Fund for Development of the Plata Basin.

The initial integration plans through the infrastructure cooperation of UNASUR came with the construction of the Bioceanic Corridor and the Interoceanic Highway. The Pacific Highway, between Peru and Brazil, began to be built in September 2005, financed 60% by Brazil and 40% by Peru, and was completed in December 2010.

===Economic development===

Presidents of the seven founding countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, Venezuela and Uruguay) officially launched the South American Bank in Buenos Aires in December 2007. The heads of all the founding countries were at the ceremony, with the exception of President Tabaré Vázquez of Uruguay. The capital will be US$7b, with Venezuela responsible for US$3b and Brazil US$2b. The headquarters will be located in Caracas with offices in Buenos Aires and La Paz.

The Bank of the South will finance economic development projects to improve local competitiveness and to promote the scientific and technological development of the member states. Its founding charter affirms that the bank will promote projects in a &quot;stable and equal&quot; manner and priorities will be oriented towards reinforcing South American integration, reducing asymmetries, and promoting an egalitarian distribution of investments.

The Brazilian Minister, Guido Mantega, stated that the bank is not similar to the International Monetary Fund; it will be a credit institution similar to the World Bank.

===Monetary policy===
The Bank of the South (Portuguese: Banco do Sul, Spanish: Banco del Sur, Dutch: Bank van het Zuiden, English: Bank of the South) will establish monetary policy and finance development projects. One of the objectives of monetary union is to establish a Single South American currency. Support for the creation of this currency was provided in January 2007 by Peruvian President Alan García, and other South American authorities expressed themselves in favor, as Bolivian President Evo Morales in April of that year, who proposed that the currency Only one denominated &quot;Pacha&quot; (&quot;earth&quot; in Quechua language), however, except for the right of each country to suggest a name for the common currency.

==Defense policy==


The South American Defense Council (CDS) was proposed by Venezuela and Brazil to serve as a mechanism for regional security, promoting military co-operation. From the beginning Brazil, Argentina and Chile, the countries that took the leadership of the project, made clear that they did not intend to form a NATO-like alliance, but a cooperative security arrangement, enhancing multilateral military cooperation, promoting confidence and security building measures and fostering defense industry exchange. Colombia initially refused to join the defense council due to the strong military ties it has with the United States through the Plan Colombia. However, after reviewing the proposal they decided to join on 20 July 2008.

Shortly following the signing by Colombia&#x27;s president, President of Chile Michelle Bachelet appointed a working group to investigate and draft a plan for the new council. Finally, on 10 March 2009, the 12 nation members held, in Chile, the first meeting of the newly formed council.

In mid-2010, UNASUR played a key role in mediating the 2010 Colombia–Venezuela diplomatic crisis. On 1 September 2010, the agency &quot;UnasurHaití&quot; was created to provide US$100 million in help to Haiti.

==Democracy==
On 26 November 2010, the Additional Protocol on Commitment to Democracy was signed in the city of Georgetown, Cooperative Republic of Guyana. The protocol derives from the mandate established in the Buenos Aires Declaration of 1 October 2010, which affirms that member states will not tolerate a challenge to institutional authority, nor attempt to strike a legitimately constituted civilian power, adopting concrete and immediate measures in case of breach of constitutional order. It is applicable &quot;in the event of a breach or threat of a breach of the democratic order, of a violation of the constitutional order or in any situation that endangers the legitimate exercise of power and the observance of democratic values and principles.&quot;

In the event of such a situation, the Council of Heads of State and Government or the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs may be convened extraordinarily by the Pro-Tempore Presidency of the Union, ex officio or at the request of the affected State or another member of UNASUR, to deliberate on the application of sanctions to the affected state. Among the political and diplomatic sanctions envisaged by the Protocol, the following stand out:
*Suspension of the right to participate in the different organs and instances of Unasur
*Partial or total closure of land borders with the affected State, including suspension or limitation of trade, air and sea transportation, communications, energy supply, services and supply.

==Free movement of people==

Visits by citizens of UNASUR to any other UNASUR member state of up to 90 days only require an identification document issued by the traveler&#x27;s country. In November 2006, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Uruguay agreed to abolish visa requirements for tourists between any of those nations.

Mercosur, along with its Associate members of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador established that their territories together form an &quot;area of free residence with the right to work&quot; to all its citizens, with no additional requirements other than nationality. The Free Movement and Residence Agreement was established in the Brasília summit based in a previous document signed on 6 December 2002.

Citizens of any Mercosur countries will have a simplified process in temporary residence visa of up to two years in any other member countries, with the requirements of a valid passport, birth certificate, and no criminal record. Temporary residence can become permanent if a licit means of living can be verified.

==Electoral monitors==
UNASUR intended to create electoral monitor teams that would replace the monitors from the Organization of American States.

<doc id="1254421" wikidata="Q2985399" url="?curid=1254421" title="Committee of safety (American Revolution)">
<text>In the American Revolution, committees of correspondence, committees of inspection, also known as committees of observation and committees of safety, were different local committees of Patriots that became a shadow government; they took control of the Thirteen Colonies away from royal officials, who became increasingly helpless.

In the Province of Massachusetts Bay, as affairs drew toward a crisis, it became usual for towns to appoint three committees: of correspondence, of inspection, and of safety. The first was to keep the community informed of dangers either legislative or executive, and concert measures of public good; the second to watch for violations of , or attempts of loyalists to evade them; the third to act as general executive while the legal authority was in abeyance. In February 1776 these were regularly legalized by the Massachusetts General Court but consolidated into one called the &quot;Committee of Correspondence, Inspection, and Safety&quot; to be elected annually by the towns.

==Committees of correspondence==
Committees of correspondence were public functionaries, and first existed in England, created by the parliamentary party of the 17th century in their struggles with the Stuarts. In 1763, when the English government attempted to enforce the trade and navigation acts on the American colonies after the Peace of Paris, the colonial leaders advised the merchants to hold meetings and appoint committees to memorialize the legislature and correspond with each other to forward a union of interests. This was done in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York 1763–64.

On November 21, 1772, a town meeting at Faneuil Hall in Boston, appointed a correspondence committee of 21 to communicate with other Massachusetts towns concerning infringements of popular rights. Until late in 1774, the committee remained the real executive body of Boston and largely of the province. The Boston committee, by legal town meeting, was made the executive of Boston. Under its direction the tea was thrown into the harbor, and the Tea Act of 1773 roused the remaining colonies: Georgia in September, Maryland and Delaware in October, North Carolina in December, New York and New Jersey in February, chose legislative committees of correspondence. New municipalities later joined the movement, including several in New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and New York City.

After the Boston Port Bill came into effect the Boston committee invited those of eight other towns to meet in Faneuil Hall, and the meeting sent circulars to the other colonies recommending suspension of trade with Great Britain, while the legislative committee was directed by the House to send copies of the Port Bill to other colonies, and call attention to it as an attempt to suppress American liberty. The organization of the committees was at once enormously extended; almost every town, city, or county had one. In the middle and southern colonies the committees were empowered, by the terms of their appointment, to elect deputies to meet with those of other committees, to consult on measures for the public good.

==Committees of inspection==
Resolution 11, passed by the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, established Committees of Inspection in every county, city, and town to enforce the Continental Association. Hundreds of committees of inspection were formed following the First Continental Congress&#x27;s declaration of the Continental Association, a boycott of British goods, in October 1774. In New York City, it was called the Committee of Observation or Committee of Sixty.

The focus of the committees was initially on enforcing the Non-importation Agreements, which aimed to hinder the import of British manufactured goods. However, as the revolutionary crisis continued, the committees rapidly took on greater powers, filling the vacuum left by the colonial governments; the committees began to collect taxes and recruit soldiers. Kathleen Burk writes, &quot;It is significant that the Committees believed that they derived their authority from the Continental Congress, not from the provincial assemblies or congresses.&quot;

==Committees of safety==
Committees of Safety were a later outcome of the committees of correspondence. Committees of safety were executive bodies that governed during adjournments of, were created by, and derived their authority from, provincial assemblies or congresses, like those of the New York Provincial Congress. The Committees of safety were emergency panels of leading citizens, who passed laws, handed down regulations, enacted statutes, and did other fundamental business prior to the Declaration of Independence in July 1776 and the passage of individual state constitutions. As they assumed power to govern, however, they generally chose to observe rough legal procedures, warning and shaming enemies rather than killing them. Two examples of the rough legal proceedings were forced public confessions and apologies for slander or more violently, roughing up an individual for voting against giving the poorer Bostonians supplies. Many of the men that had served on their individual states&#x27; Committees of safety were later delegates for the Continental Congress.

==Importance==
T. H. Breen writes that &quot;proliferation of local committees represented a development of paramount importance in the achievement of independence,&quot; because the committees were the first step in the creation of &quot;a formal structure capable not only of policing the revolution on the ground but also of solidifying ties with other communities.&quot; The network of committees were also vital for reinforcing &quot;a shared sense of purpose,&quot; speaking to &quot;an imagined collectivity—a country of the mind&quot; of Americans.

The strengthening of the committees of correspondence in the 1770s also marked the creation of what Gordon S. Wood terms &quot;a new kind of popular politics in America.&quot; Wood writes that &quot;the rhetoric of liberty now brought to the surface long-latent political tendencies. Ordinary people were no longer willing to trust only wealthy and learned gentlemen to represent them ... various artisan, religious, and ethnic groups now felt that their particular interests were so distinct that only people of their kind could speak for them. In 1774 radicals in Philadelphia demanded that seven artisans and six Germans be added to the revolutionary committee of the city.&quot;

The development of coalition and interest-group politics greatly alarmed both royal officials and more conservative Patriots. For example, William Henry Drayton, the prominent South Carolina planter who had studied at Oxford University, complained about the participation of cobblers and butchers, stating that &quot;Nature never intended that such men should be profound politicians, or able statesmen. In 1775, the royal governor of Georgia &quot;noted in astonishment that the committee in control of Savannah consisted of &#x27;a Parcel of the Lowest People, chiefly carpenters, shoemakers, Blacksmiths etc with a Jew at their head.&quot;

Very few records of committees of safety survive. Committee activities are attested to primarily through newspapers and published material.

By 1775, the committees had become counter-governments that gradually replaced royal authority and took control of local governments. They regulated the economy, politics, morality, and militia of their individual communities. In North Carolina in December 1776, they came under the control of a more powerful central authority, the Council of Safety.

Eighteen years later, at the height of the French Revolution, France was ruled by its own Committee of Public Safety. The French revolutionaries were familiar with the American struggle — for them, the most recent and significant precedent of a Republican revolution.

<doc id="1254422" wikidata="Q1473663" url="?curid=1254422" title="Saint Catherine Parish">
<text>Saint Catherine () is a parish in the south east of Jamaica. It is located in the county of Middlesex, and is one of the island&#x27;s largest and most economically valued parishes because of its many resources. It includes the first capital of Jamaica, Spanish Town, originally known as San Jago de la Vega or Santiago de la Vega (St. James of the Plain).

==History==
The modern boundaries of St. Catherine were decided in 1867 when four smaller parishes were amalgamated. The historic parishes of Saint Dorothy Parish, Saint John Parish and Saint Thomas in the Vale Parish, Jamaica were merged with the historic parish of Saint Catherine.

==Geography and People==
St Catherine is located at . It is bordered by St Andrew in the east, Clarendon in the west, and by St Mary and St Ann in the north. It has an area of 1,192 km2, making it one of Jamaica&#x27;s largest parishes and it is one of the fastest growing parishes in the nation and has the largest economy out of all fourteen parishes. Except for the Hellshire Hills near the coast, the south of the parish is virtually flat. The central and northern sections are very mountainous, however; the northern border is on Mount Rosser, which crosses over into St Ann, the highest point being .

A plain of approximately occupies the southern part of the Rio Cobre basin. The Rio Cobre is the only river that runs along the southern plain. It provides water to irrigate over on the plain.

==Commerce==

===Development===
Out of all the parishes (with the exception of Kingston Parish and Saint Andrew Parish) Saint Catherine shows the most potential for urban development. With its good water resources, virtually flat landscape, and nearness to the capital, it could possibly be one of the Caribbean&#x27;s major urban areas in the next few years.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture remains the main source of employment in the parish. There are many small farmers who practice mixed farming; crops such as bananas, coconuts, pineapple, citrus, pumpkins, peppers, coffee and callaloo are planted for both domestic and commercial purposes. The larger properties produce sugar cane, bananas and citrus mainly for export. Dairy farms are also found in the parish. One of these is a farm in Old Harbour. The Salt Ponds District between Spanish Town, Port Henderson and Passage Fort is noted for the fine fish especially calipera.

===Manufacturing===
St Catherine is second only to Kingston as an industrial center. Industrial plants are some of the biggest employers in the parish. Spanish Town has the largest salt producing plant in the Caribbean, while Jamaica Milk Products, an affiliate of the Nestlé organization, has a factory in Bog Walk, another major town in the parish. The largest power plant in the island and several factories are located in Old Harbour. Twickenham Park, near Spanish Town, is another industrial estate with mainly light industries including cigarettes, carpets, batteries, ackee,

plastic items, medical and pharmaceutical products.

===Tourist sites===
*Jamaica&#x27;s emancipation Square can be found in Spanish Town. This is the only Georgian square in Jamaica. Kings House and the House of Assembly on the west and east sides, respectively, were erected in 1762. The Courthouse was built in 1819 and used as a chapel and armory with the Town Hall upstairs. 
*The Rio Cobre River and Gorge is one of the largest in the island. Sinking at a place called River Sink at Worthy Park, it runs underground for nearly six kilometres, then surfaces at River Head Grand Cave in St Thomas-in-the-Vale. Before entering the gorge it is joined by a number of tributaries, such as the Thomas River, the Rio D&#x27;Oro and the Rio Pedro. In the early 1770s, a road was opened through the gorge. The Flat Bridge was originally constructed of logs, which were washed away in a flood. The present bridge was built and it has withstood countless floods. A marker can be found, which shows where the water rose to over above the bridge in 1933. An apocryphal story is that at noon, on every Good Friday, for a short period of time the ghosts of all the slaves who drowned in the river can be seen. 
*Caymanas Race Track, Jamaica&#x27;s most famous race track, is in St Catherine.
*St Clair Cave, one of Jamaica&#x27;s more famous caves, is found in the parish. This large, complex cave contains one of the most notable bat roosts on the island, and is one of the few known historical sites for the possibly extinct bat, &quot;Phyllonycteris aphylla&quot;. Because of the biological importance of the system, and the inherent dangers involved in exploring it (i.e. noxious gases, histoplasmosis, Cutaneous larva migrans, difficult footing), casual visitation is discouraged.
*Hellshire Beach is located on the south coast of Jamaica in St. Catherine Parish about 20 minutes away from Kingston. Not a tourist spot due to its distance from major hotels.

<doc id="1254436" wikidata="Q5501119" url="?curid=1254436" title="Freeport Tortuga">
<text>Freeport Tortuga was a free port project by Dupont Caribbean Inc. of Texas, which began construction in 1971 based upon a 99-year contract with the government of Haiti. The location of the freeport was the old buccaneer stronghold of Tortuga island located some 10 miles off the north coast of the main Haitian island of Hispaniola, which is also shared by the Dominican Republic. Freeport Tortuga ended with its expropriation by the Haitian government in 1974.

==Origin of the freeport==

In 1967, during the time that Don Pierson of Eastland, Texas was attempting to lease a radio broadcasting ship that had been the former homes of &quot;Swinging Radio England&quot; and &quot;Britain Radio&quot; off the coast of England, he received a response from the Ambassador for Haiti in Washington, DC. Don Pierson&#x27;s original plan was to lease or sell the ship to the government of Haiti for it to establish two powerful 50 kW commercial radio stations.

==Dupont Caribbean Inc.==
This offer emerged into a plan to develop the island of Tortuga as a freeport and he was asked to assist the government of Haiti to encourage business investment in that poverty-stricken land. This privately financed, privately managed free enterprise zone became a reality in 1971 when Haitian dictator François Duvalier (known as &quot;Papa Doc&quot;) and the Haitian government entered into a 99-year contract with Don Pierson&#x27;s company called Dupont Caribbean Inc. This contract provided for the establishment of Freeport Tortuga.

==Construction==
Within 18 months Don Pierson succeeded in building the island&#x27;s first airport, a loading dock for seagoing vessels, a rudimentary water and sewer system, an electricity generating facility, and six miles of paved road. Of equal importance, the project created jobs for some 400 previously unemployed Haitians and resulted in the establishment of a small school to teach various job skills. During this period he also became Honorary Consul of the Republic of Haiti to Texas from 1969 through 1974.

==Expropriation==
The project came to abrupt end in 1974 when, after it was announced that Gulf Oil Corporation was contemplating investing more than $300 million to build a resort on the island, the government of Jean-Claude Duvalier (known as &quot;Baby Doc&quot;), summarily expropriated the project, resulting in its collapse.

<text>Morgan Academy is a secondary school in the Stobswell area of Dundee, Scotland. Morgan Academy was founded in 1889 and is the second oldest state school in Dundee behind Harris Academy.

==History==
The building was designed in 1862 by the Edinburgh architects John Dick Peddie and Charles Kinnear, opening in 1866 as the Morgan Hospital, a charitable institution providing accommodation and education for &quot;sons of tradesmen and persons of the working class generally whose parents stand in the need of assistance&quot;. 

In 1888, Morgan Hospital closed and a year later in 1889, the school opened as Morgan Academy, often referred to by alumni as &quot;The Morgan&quot; or simply &quot;Morgan&quot;, with various alterations, including roofing over the courtyard as a hall. The architecture is designated as a Category &#x27;A&#x27; listing by Historic Scotland.

Its benefactor was John Morgan, the son of a Dundee maltman, who emigrated to India at the age of 20 where, with his brother, he became a wealthy indigo farmer. Upon his death in 1850 he bequeathed much of his fortune to establish a residential institution. The hospital closed in 1888 and was bought by the members of the Dundee Burgh School Board, who re-opened it as a school.

Until the advent of comprehensive education in the late 1960s and early 1970s, there were mainly two types of high school in Scotland: junior secondaries where students left school at 16 and began preparation for one of the trades or entered the workforce, and academies where students remained until the end of fifth or sixth year and took highers before normally going to college or university. Morgan functioned in the latter category.

Morgan Academy later became a comprehensive school in 1972, although the school was still called an academy rather than a high school.

The school suffered a fire on 21 March 2001 which destroyed much of the building. It was rebuilt using the original facade and much of the internal appearance. The newly rebuilt Morgan Academy was re-opened in November 2004, by then Minister for Education and Young People Peter Peacock MSP. A portrait of John Morgan, found in the basement of the McManus Galleries, was unveiled at newly rebuilt school and placed on show in the Great Hall of the school.

== Houses ==
The school consists of three houses, named after three Scottish castles: Airlie, Cortachy and Mains which compete annually in the House Championship and also elect House Captains, formerly one male and one female but now three of any gender combination, from Sixth Year. Originally four houses, the three aforementioned plus Glamis, which was dissolved in 2011.

<text>The British Rail Class 413 (or 4-CAP) units were formed from 1982 by permanently coupling two Class 414 2-HAP units together.

== History ==
The British Rail Class 413 (or 4-CAP) units were formed from 1982 by permanently coupling two Class 414 2-HAP units together, initially for East and West Coastway services from Brighton. There were two sub-classes of units: class 413/2, units 3201–3213, converted in 1982 from phase 1 2 HAP units 6001-6049. These units were formed DTCsoL - MBSO - MBSO - DTCsoL, with the former driving equipment of the DMBSO decommissioned, giving the new designation; and class 413/3, converted from the later phase 2 build units 6050–6173, units 3301–3311 (formed 1982, again with the MBSOs innermost) and 3321–3325 (formed 1991, with the DMBSO outermost giving the formation, DMBSO - TCsoL - TCsoL - DMBSO. The centre vehicles again had their driving equipment decommissioned.

==Fleet list==
Eleven Class 413/3 unit were converted in 1982 from &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; 2-HAP units (6043-6173, later reclassified as Class 414/3). Units were marshalled with the driving motor vehicles in the centre. 

In 1991 a further five units (3321–3325) were converted from &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; 2-HAP units (by now renumbered into the range 4301–4322). These units had the driving motors marshalled outermost.
==Withdrawal==
The final units were withdrawn in 1994/95. None survived into preservation.

<doc id="1254450" wikidata="Q523014" url="?curid=1254450" title="Muscogee language">
<text>The Muscogee language (Muskogee; Muskogee: ), previously referred to by its exonym, Creek, is a Muskogean language spoken by Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole people, primarily in the US states of Oklahoma and Florida. Along with Mikasuki, when it is spoken by the Seminole, it is known as Seminole.

Historically, the language was spoken by various constituent groups of the Muscogee or &quot;Maskoki&quot; in what are now Alabama and Georgia. It is related to but not mutually intelligible with the other primary language of the Muscogee confederacy, Hitchiti-Mikasuki, which is spoken by the kindred Mikasuki, as well as with other Muskogean languages.

The Muscogee first brought the Muscogee and Miccosukee languages to Florida in the early 18th century. Combining with other ethnicities there, they emerged as the Seminole. During the 1830s, however, the US government forced most Muscogee and Seminole to relocate west of the Mississippi River, with most forced into Indian Territory.

The language is today spoken by fewer than 400 people, most of whom live in Oklahoma and are members of the Muscogee Nation and the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma.

==Current status==
Muscogee is widely spoken among the Muscogee people. The Muscogee Nation offers free language classes and immersion camps to Muscogee children.

===Language programs===

The College of the Muscogee Nation offers a language certificate program. Tulsa public schools, the University of Oklahoma and Glenpool Library in Tulsa and the Holdenville, Okmulgee, and Tulsa Muscogee Communities of the Muscogee Nation offer Muscogee Creek language classes. In 2013, the Sapulpa Creek Community Center graduated a class of 14 from its Muscogee language class. In 2018, 8 teachers graduated from a class put on by the Seminole nation at Seminole State College to try and reintroduce the Muscogee language to students in elementary and high school in several schools around the state.

==Phonology==
The phoneme inventory of Muscogee consists of thirteen consonants and three vowel qualities, which distinguish length, tone and nasalization. It also makes use of the gemination of stops, fricatives and sonorants.

===Consonants===
====Plosives====
There are four voiceless stops in Muscogee: . is a voiceless palatal affricate and patterns as a single consonant and so with the other voiceless stops. has an alveolar allophone before . The obstruent consonants are voiced to between sonorants and vowels but remain voiceless at the end of a syllable.

Between instances of , or after at the end of a syllable, the velar is realized as the uvular or . For example:

====Fricatives====
There are four voiceless fricatives in Muscogee: . can be realized as either labiodental or bilabial in place of articulation. Predominantly among speakers in Florida, the articulation of is more laminal, resulting in being realized as , but for most speakers, is a voiceless apico-alveolar fricative .

Like , the glottal is sometimes realized as the uvular [] when it is preceded by or when syllable-final:

====Sonorants====
The sonorants in Muscogee are two nasals ( and ), two semivowels ( and ), and the lateral , all voiced. Nasal assimilation occurs in Muscogee: becomes before .

Sonorants are devoiced when followed by in the same syllable and results in a single voiceless consonant:

====Geminates====
All plosives and fricatives in Muscogee can be geminated (lengthened). Some sonorants may also be geminated, but and are less common than other sonorant geminates, especially in roots. For the majority of speakers, except for those influenced by the Alabama or Koasati languages, the geminate does not occur.

===Vowels===
The vowel phonemes of Muscogee are as follows:

There are three short vowels and three long vowels . There are also the nasal vowels (in the linguistic orthography, they are often written with an ogonek under them or a following superscript &quot;n&quot;). Most occurrences of nasal vowels are the result of nasal assimilation or the nasalizing grade, but there are some forms that show contrast between oral and nasal vowels:

====Short vowels====
The three short vowels can be realized as the lax and centralized () when a neighboring consonant is coronal or in closed syllables. However, will generally not centralize when it is followed by or in the same syllable, and will generally remain noncentral if it is word-final. Initial vowels can be deleted in Muscogee, mostly applying to the vowel . The deletion will affect the pitch of the following syllable by creating a higher-than-expected pitch on the new initial syllable. Furthermore, initial vowel deletion in the case of single-morpheme, short words such as &quot;ifa&quot; &#x27;dog&#x27; or &quot;icó&quot; &#x27;deer&#x27; is impossible, as the shortest a Muscogee word can be is a one-syllable word ending in a long vowel (&quot;fóː&quot; &#x27;bee&#x27;) or a two-syllable word ending with a short vowel (&quot;ací&quot; &#x27;corn&#x27;).

====Long vowels====
There are three long vowels in Muscogee (), which are slightly longer than short vowels and are never centralized.

Long vowels are rarely followed by a sonorant in the same syllable. Therefore, when syllables are created (often from suffixation or contractions) in which a long vowel is followed by a sonorant, the vowel is shortened:

====Diphthongs====
In Muscogee, there are three diphthongs, generally realized as .

====Nasal vowels====
Both long and short vowels can be nasalized (the distinction between and below), but long nasal vowels are more common. Nasal vowels usually appear as a result of a contraction, as the result of a neighboring nasal consonant, or as the result of nasalizing grade, a grammatical ablaut, which indicates intensification through lengthening and nasalization of a vowel ( &#x27;warm&#x27; with the nasalizing grade intensifies the word to &#x27;nice and warm&#x27;). Nasal vowels may also appear as part of a suffix that indicates a question ( &#x27;I wonder if it&#x27;s raining&#x27;).

====Tones====
There are three phonemic tones in Muscogee; they are generally unmarked except in the linguistic orthography: high (marked in the linguistic orthography with an acute accent: á, etc.), low (unmarked: a, etc.), and falling (marked with a circumflex: â, etc.).

==Orthography==
The traditional Muscogee alphabet was adopted by the tribe in the late 1800s and has 20 letters.

Although it is based on the Latin alphabet, some sounds are vastly different from those in English like those represented by c, e, i, r, and v. Here are the (approximately) equivalent sounds using familiar English words and the IPA:

There are also three vowel sequences whose spellings match their phonetic makeup:

===Consonants===
As mentioned above, certain consonants in Muscogee, when they appear between two sonorants (a vowel or m, n, l, w, or y), become voiced. They are the consonants represented by p, t, k, c, and s:

* c can sound like , the &quot;j&quot; in just
* k can sound like , the &quot;g&quot; in goat
* p can sound like , the &quot;b&quot; in boat
* s can sound like , the &quot;z&quot; in zoo
* t can sound like , the &quot;d&quot; in dust

In addition, certain combinations of consonants sound differently from English, giving multiple possible transcriptions. The most prominent case is the second person singular ending for verbs. &quot;Wiketv&quot; means &quot;to stop:&quot; the verb for &quot;you are stopping&quot; may be written in Muscogee as &quot;wikeckes&quot; or &quot;wiketskes&quot;. Both are pronounced the same. The -eck- transliteration is preferred by Innes (2004), and the -etsk- transliteration has been used by Martin (2000) and Loughridge (1964).

===Vowel length===
While vowel length in Muscogee is distinctive, it is somewhat inconsistently indicated in the traditional orthography. The following basic correspondences can be noted:

* The short vowel v with the long vowel a ( vs. )
* The short vowel e with the long vowel ē ( vs. )
* The short vowel u with the long vowel o ( vs. )

However, the correspondences do not always apply, and in some words, short is spelled a, long is spelled e, and short is spelled o.

===Nonstandard orthography===
Muscogee words carry distinctive tones and nasalization of their vowels. These features are not marked in the traditional orthography, only in dictionaries and linguistic publications. The following additional markers have been used by Martin (2000) and Innes (2004):

* Falling tone in a syllable is shown using a circumflex. In English, falling tone is found in phrases such as &quot;uh-oh&quot; or commands such as &quot;stop!&quot; In Muscogee, however, changing a verb such as (&quot;she is putting on (a dress)&quot;) to alters the meaning from one of process to one of state (&quot;she is wearing (a dress)&quot;).
* Nasalization of a vowel is shown with an ogonek under the vowel. Changing the verb to adds the imperfective aspect, a sense of repeated or habitual action (&quot;she kept putting on (that same dress)&quot;).
* The key syllable of a word is often shown with an accent and is the last syllable that has normal (high) tone within a word; the following syllables are all lower in pitch.

==Grammar==

=== Word order ===
The general sentence structure fits the pattern subject–object–verb. The subject or object may be a noun or a noun followed by one or more adjectives. Adverbs tend to occur either at the beginning of the sentence (for time adverbs) or immediately before the verb (for manner adverbs).

=== Grammatical case ===
Case is marked on noun phrases using the clitics -t for subjects, and -n for non-subjects. The clitic -n can appear on multiple noun phrases in a single sentence at once, such as the direct object, indirect object, and adverbial nouns. Despite the distinction in verbal affixes between the agent and patient of the verb, the clitic -t marks subject of both transitive and intransitive verbs.

In some situations, case marking is omitted. This is especially true of sentences with only one noun where the role of the noun is obvious from the personal marking on the verb. Case marking is also omitted on fixed phrases that use a noun, e.g. &quot;go &quot;to town&quot;&quot; or &quot;build &quot;a fire&quot;&quot;.

===Verbs===
In Muscogee, a single verb can translate into an entire English sentence. The root infinitive form of the verb is altered for:

* Person of agent. &quot;Letketv&quot; = to run.
** &quot;Lētkis.&quot; = I am running.
** &quot;Lētketskes.&quot; = You are running.
** &quot;Lētkes.&quot; = He / She is running.
** Plural forms can be a bit more complicated (see below).
* Person of patient and/or indirect object. That is accomplished with prefixes. &quot;Hecetv&quot; = to see.
** &quot;Cehēcis&quot; = I see you.
** &quot;Cvhēcetskes.&quot; = You see me.
** &quot;Hvtvm Cehēcares.&quot; = I will see you again.
* Tense. &quot;Pohetv&quot; = to hear.
** &quot;Pohis.&quot; = I am hearing (present).
** &quot;Pohhis.&quot; = I just heard (first or immediate past; within a day ago).
** &quot;Pohvhanis.&quot; = I am going to hear.
** &quot;Pohares.&quot; = I will hear.
** &quot;Pohiyvnks.&quot; = I heard recently (second or middle past, within a week ago).
** &quot;Pohimvts.&quot; = I heard (third or distant past, within a year ago).
** &quot;Pohicatēs.&quot; = Long ago I heard (fourth or remote past, beyond a year ago).
** There are at least ten more tenses, including perfect versions of the above, as well as future, indefinite, and pluperfect.
* Mood. &quot;Wiketv&quot; = to stop.
** &quot;Wikes.&quot; = He / She is stopping (indicative).
** &quot;Wikvs.&quot; = Stop! (imperative)
** &quot;Wike wites.&quot; = He / She may stop (potential).
** &quot;Wiken omat.&quot; = If he / she stops (subjunctive).
** &quot;Wikepices.&quot; = He / She made someone stop (causative).
* Aspect. &quot;Kerretv&quot; = to learn.
** &quot;Kērris.&quot; = I am learning (progressive, ongoing or in progress).
** &quot;Kêrris.&quot; = I know (resulting state).
** &quot;Kęrris.&quot; = I keep learning (imperfect, habitual or repeated action).
** &quot;Kerîyis.&quot; = I just learned (action completed in the past).
* Voice.
** &quot;Wihkis.&quot; = I just stopped (active voice, 1st past).
** &quot;Cvwihokes.&quot; = I was just stopped (passive voice, 1st past).
* Negatives.
** &quot;Wikarēs.&quot; = I will stop (positive, future tense).
** &quot;Wikakarēs.&quot; = I will not stop (negative, future tense).
* Questions. &quot;Hompetv&quot; = to eat; &quot;nake&quot; = what.
** &quot;Hompetskes.&quot; = You are eating.
** &quot;Hompetskv?&quot; = Are you eating? (expecting a yes or no answer)
** &quot;Naken hompetska?&quot; = What are you eating? (expecting a long answer)

====Verbs with irregular plurals====
Some Muscogee verbs, especially those involving motion, have highly irregular plurals: &quot;letketv&quot; = to run, with a singular subject, but &quot;tokorketv&quot; = to run of two subjects and &quot;pefatketv&quot; = to run of three or more.

====Stative verbs====
Another entire class of Muscogee verbs is the stative verbs, which express no action, imply no duration, and provide only description of a static condition. In some languages, such as English, they are expressed as adjectives. In Muscogee, the verbs behave like adjectives but are classed and treated as verbs. However, they are not altered for the person of the subject by an affix, as above; instead, the prefix changes:

: &quot;enokkē&quot; = to be sick;
: &quot;enokkēs&quot; = he / she is sick;
: &quot;cvnokkēs&quot; = I&#x27;m sick;
: &quot;cenokkēs&quot; = you are sick.

====Locative prefixes====
Prefixes are also used in Muscogee for shades of meaning of verbs that are expressed, in English, by adverbs in phrasal verbs. For example, in English, the verb &quot;to go&quot; can be changed to &quot;to go up&quot;, &quot;to go in&quot;, &quot;to go around&quot;, and other variations. In Muscogee, the same principle of shading a verb&#x27;s meaning is handled by locative prefixes:

Example:
* &quot;vyetv&quot; = to go (singular subjects only, see above);
* &quot;ayis&quot; = I am going;
* &quot;ak-ayis&quot; = I am going (in water / in a low place / under something);
* &quot;tak-ayis&quot; = I am going (on the ground);
* &quot;oh-ayis&quot; = I am going (on top of something).

However, for verbs of motion, Muscogee has a large selection of verbs with a specific meaning: = to go out; = to go through.

===== Switch-reference =====
Clauses in a sentence use switch-reference clitics to co-ordinate their subjects. The clitic -t on a verb in a clause marks that the verb&#x27;s subject is the same as that of the next clause. The clitic -n marks that verb&#x27;s subject is different from the next clause.

===Possession===

In some languages, a special form of the noun, the genitive case, is used to show possession. In Muscogee this relationship is expressed in two quite different ways, depending on the nature of the noun.

====Nouns in fixed relationships (inalienable possession)====

A body part or family member cannot be named in Muscogee without mentioning the possessor, which is an integrated part of the word. A set of changeable prefixes serves this function:

* = his / her hand
* = my hand
* = your hand
* = our hand

Even if the possessor is mentioned specifically, the prefix still must be part of the word: &quot;Toskē enke&quot; = Toske&#x27;s hand. It is not redundant in Muscogee (&quot;Toske his_hand&quot;).

====Transferable nouns====
All other nouns are possessed through a separate set of pronouns.

* &quot;efv&quot; = dog;
* &quot;vm efv&quot; = my dog;
* &quot;cem efv&quot; = your dog;
* &quot;em efv&quot; = his / her dog;
* &quot;pum efv&quot; = our dog.

Again, even though the construction in English would be redundant, the proper way to form the possessive in Muscogee must include the correct preposition: &quot;Toskē em efv&quot; = Toske&#x27;s dog. That is grammatically correct in Muscogee, unlike the literal English translation &quot;Toske his dog&quot;.

====Locative nouns====
A final distinctive feature, related to the above, is the existence of locational nouns. In English, speakers have prepositions to indicate location, for example, &quot;behind&quot;, &quot;around&quot;, &quot;beside&quot;, and so on. In Muscogee, the locations are actually nouns. These are possessed just like parts of the body and family members were above.

* = house; = noun for &quot;behind&quot;; = behind the house; = behind me; = behind you.
* = under; = tree; = under the tree.
* = near; = near me; = near you; = near us.

===Examples===

* Family.
** &quot;Erke.&quot; = Father.
** &quot;Ecke.&quot; = Mother. 
** &quot;Pauwv.&quot; = Maternal Uncle. 
** &quot;Erkuce.&quot; = Paternal Uncle.
** &quot;Eckuce.&quot; = Aunt. 
** &quot;Puca.&quot; = Grandpa. 
** &quot;Puse.&quot; = Grandma.
** &quot;Cēpvnē.&quot; = Boy. 
** &quot;Hoktuce.&quot; = Girl.

==Male vs. female speech==
Claudio Saunt, writing about the language of the later 18th century, said that there were different feminine and masculine versions, which he also calls dialects, of the Muscogee language. Males &quot;attach[ed] distinct endings to verbs&quot;, while Females &quot;accent[ed] different syllables&quot;. These forms, mentioned in the first (1860) grammar of the Muscogee language, persisted in the Hichiti, Muscogee proper, and Koasati languages at least into the first half of the 20th century.

==Seminole dialects==
The forms of Muscogee used by the Seminoles of Oklahoma and Florida are separate dialects from the ones spoken by Muscogee people. Oklahoma Seminole speak a dialect known as Oklahoma Seminole Creek. Florida Seminole Creek is one of two languages spoken among Florida Seminoles; it is less common than the Mikasuki language. The most distinct dialect of the language is said to be that of the Florida Seminole, which is described as &quot;rapid&quot;, &quot;staccato&quot; and &quot;dental&quot;, with more loan words from Spanish and Mikasuki as opposed to English. Florida Seminole Creek is the most endangered register of the Muscogee language.

<text>Oebisfelde () is a town and a former municipality in the Börde district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Since 1 January 2010, it is part of the town Oebisfelde-Weferlingen.

It is accessed by Bundesstraße (German federal highway) 188.

== Geography ==
Oebisfelde is in the Altmark/Magdeburg Börde area. It borders on Lower Saxony, across the Aller river. East of Oebisfelde is the Drömling Nature Park.

=== Subdivisions ===
* Bergfriede
* Breitenrode
* Buchhorst
* Gehrendorf
* Lockstedt
* Niendorf
* Wassensdorf
* Weddendorf

==History==
Between 1945 and 1990 the Oebisfelde railway station served as an East German inner German border crossing for rail transport. In Oebisfelde&#x27;s component village of Buchhorst there was an East German border crossing for inland navigation on the Mittellandkanal, only open for freight vessels. The traffic between the Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany (until 1949, thereafter the East German Democratic Republic, or West Berlin and the British zone of occupation) and Federal Republic of Germany was subject to the Interzonal traffic regulations, which, between West Germany and West Berlin, followed the special regulations of the Transit Agreement (1972).

<text>John Edward Hastings (March 16, 1942 – May 15, 2024) was a Canadian politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003.

==Background==
Hastings earned degrees from the University of Western Ontario (1963) and the University of Toronto (1967). He worked as a political researcher and as a teacher in Ontario&#x27;s Secondary School system. In 1975, he worked as executive assistant to provincial cabinet minister Lorne Henderson. Hastings was a member of the Worker&#x27;s Compensation Board from 1977 to 1994 and also served on the advisory board of the Institute of Study of Antisocial Behaviour in Youth before entering public life.

==Politics==
Hastings ran for Toronto&#x27;s Hydro Commission in 1985 and was elected to the second position. He was elected to the Etobicoke City Council in 1988, and held this position until 1995.

Hastings was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating long-serving New Democrat Ed Philip by fewer than 1,000 votes in Etobicoke—Rexdale. In 1997, he was appointed a parliamentary assistant to the minister of transportation.

In the 1999 provincial election, Hastings ran for re-election in the redistributed riding of Etobicoke North and retained his seat with less than 40 per cent of the popular vote. Hastings&#x27;s riding was targeted by both the Liberals and NDP, and many believe that &quot;vote-splitting&quot; among the opposition parties caused his re-election. In 2000, Hastings supported Stockwell Day for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance on the second ballot of the newly formed party&#x27;s leadership contest.

He supported Ernie Eves to replace Harris as party leader in 2002, even though his riding executive endorsed rival candidate Jim Flaherty. Hastings rarely spoke in the legislature after Harris&#x27; retirement as premier and did not seek re-election in 2003.

On November 13, 2006, Hastings was elected to the Toronto District School Board as Trustee for Ward 1 (Etobicoke North), defeating incumbent Stan Nemiroff. Hastings took office in December 2006. He was re-elected in 2010 but was defeated in 2014 by Michael Ford who was fifty-two years his junior, the nephew of then-Mayor Rob Ford and then-councillor Doug Ford. After 17 months, Michael Ford vacated his school board seat to run for the municipal council seat held by Rob Ford at his death. Hastings sought to regain the school board seat in the 2016 by-election but was defeated by business owner Avtar Minhas.

Hastings died on May 15, 2024, at the age of 82.

<text>Ollantaytambo () is a town and an Inca archaeological site in southern Peru some by road northwest of the city of Cusco. It is located at an altitude of above sea level in the district of Ollantaytambo, province of Urubamba, Cusco region. During the Inca Empire, Ollantaytambo was the royal estate of Emperor Pachacuti, who conquered the region, and built the town and a ceremonial center. At the time of the Spanish conquest of Peru, it served as a stronghold for Manco Inca Yupanqui, leader of the Inca resistance. Located in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, it is now an important tourist attraction on account of its Inca ruins and its location en route to one of the most common starting points for the four-day, three-night hike known as the Inca Trail.

== History ==
Around the mid-15th century, the Inca emperor Pachacuti conquered and razed Ollantaytambo; the town and the nearby region were incorporated into his personal estate. The emperor rebuilt the town with sumptuous constructions and undertook extensive works of terracing and irrigation in the Urubamba Valley; the town provided lodging for the Inca nobility, while the terraces were farmed by &quot;yanakuna&quot;, retainers of the emperor. After Pachacuti&#x27;s death, the estate came under the administration of his &quot;panaqa&quot;, his family clan.

During the Spanish conquest of Peru, Ollantaytambo served as a temporary capital for Manco Inca, leader of the native resistance against the conquistadors. He fortified the town and its approaches in the direction of the former Inca capital of Cusco, which had fallen under Spanish domination. In 1536, on the plain of Mascabamba, near Ollantaytambo, Manco Inca defeated a Spanish expedition in what is known as Battle of Ollantaytambo, blocking their advance from a set of high terraces and flooding the plain. Despite his victory, however, Manco Inca did not consider his position tenable, so the following year, he withdrew to the heavily forested site of Vilcabamba, where he established the Neo-Inca State.

In 1540, the native population of Ollantaytambo was assigned in &quot;encomienda&quot; to Hernando Pizarro.

In the 19th century, the Inca ruins at Ollantaytambo attracted the attention of several foreign explorers; among them, Clements Markham, Ephraim Squier, Charles Wiener, and Ernst Middendorf published accounts of their findings.

Hiram Bingham III stopped here in 1911 on his journey up the Urubamba River in search of Machu Picchu.

== Description ==
The town of Ollantaytambo is located along the Patakancha River, close to the point where it joins the Willkanuta River. The main settlement is located on the left margin of the Patakancha with a smaller compound called &#x27;Araqhama on the right margin. The main Inca ceremonial center is located beyond &#x27;Araqhama on a hill called Cerro Bandolista. Several Inca structures are in the surrounding areas, and what follows is a brief description of the main sites.

=== Town ===

The main settlement at Ollantaytambo has an orthogonal layout with four longitudinal streets crossed by seven parallel streets. At the center of this grid, the Incas built a large plaza that may have been up to four blocks large; it was open to the east and surrounded by halls and other town blocks on its other three sides. All blocks on the southern half of the town were built to the same design; each comprised two &quot;kanchas&quot;, walled compounds with four one-room buildings around a central courtyard. Buildings in the northern half are more varied in design; however, most are in such a bad condition that their original plan is hard to establish.
Ollantaytambo dates from the late 15th century and has some of the oldest continuously occupied dwellings in South America. Its layout and buildings have been altered to different degrees by later constructions; for instance, on the southern edge of the town, an Inca esplanade with the original entrance to the town was rebuilt as a Plaza de Armas surrounded by colonial and republican buildings. The plaza at the center of the town also disappeared, as several buildings were built over it in colonial times.

Araqhama is a western prolongation of the main settlement, across the Patakancha River; it features a large plaza, called Manyaraki, surrounded by constructions made out of adobe and semicut stones. These buildings have a much larger area than their counterparts in the main settlement; they also have very tall walls and oversized doors. To the south are other structures, but smaller and built out of fieldstones. Araqhama has been continuously occupied since Inca times, as evidenced by the Roman Catholic church on the eastern side of the plaza. To the north of Manyaraki are several sanctuaries with carved stones, sculpted rock faces, and elaborate waterworks; they include the Templo de Agua and the Baño de la Ñusta.

=== Temple Hill ===

&#x27;Araqhama is bordered to the west by Cerro Bandolista, a steep hill on which the Incas built a ceremonial center. The part of the hill facing the town is occupied by the terraces of Pumatallis, framed on both flanks by rock outcrops. Due to impressive character of these terraces, the Temple Hill is commonly known as the Fortress, but this is a misnomer, as the main functions of this site were religious. The main access to the ceremonial center is a series of stairways that climb to the top of the terrace complex. At this point, the site is divided into three main areas: the Middle sector, directly in front of the terraces; the Temple sector, to the south; and the Funerary sector, to the north.

The Temple sector is built out of cut and fitted stones in contrast to the other two sectors of the Temple Hill, which are made out of fieldstones. It is accessed by a stairway that ends on a terrace with a half-finished gate and the Enclosure of the Ten Niches, a one-room building. Behind them is an open space which hosts the Platform of the Carved Seat and two unfinished monumental walls. The main structure of the whole sector is the Sun Temple, an uncompleted building which features the Wall of the Six Monoliths. The Middle and Funerary sectors have several rectangular buildings, some of them with two floors; also, several fountains are in the Middle sector.

The unfinished structures at the Temple Hill and the numerous stone blocks that litter the site indicate that it was still undergoing construction at the time of its abandonment. Some of the blocks show evidence of having been removed from finished walls, which provides evidence that a major remodeling effort was also underway. Which event halted construction at the Temple Hill is unknown; likely candidates include the war of succession between Huáscar and Atahualpa, the Spanish Conquest of Peru, and the retreat of Manco Inca from Ollantaytambo to Vilcabamba. However it is also theorised that they are the work of the earlier Tiwanaku culture.

=== Terraces ===

The valleys of the Urubamba and Patakancha Rivers along Ollantaytambo are covered by an extensive set of agricultural terraces or andenes which start at the bottom of the valleys and climb up the surrounding hills. The andenes permitted farming on otherwise unusable terrain; they also allowed the Incas to take advantage of the different ecological zones created by variations in altitude. Terraces at Ollantaytambo were built to a higher standard than common Inca agricultural terraces; for instance, they have higher walls made of cut stones instead of rough fieldstones. This type of high-prestige terracing is also found in other Inca royal estates such as Chinchero, Pisaq, and Yucay.

A set of sunken terraces starts south of Ollantaytambo&#x27;s Plaza de Armas, stretching all the way to the Urubamba River. They are about 700 m long, 60 m wide, and up to 15 m below the level of surrounding terraces; due to their shape, they are called &quot;Callejón&quot;, the Spanish word for alley. Land inside Callejón is protected from the wind by lateral walls which also absorb solar radiation during the day and release it during the night; this creates a microclimate zone 2 to 3 °C warmer than the ground above it. These conditions allowed the Incas to grow species of plants native to lower altitudes that otherwise could not have flourished at this site.

At the southern end of Callejón, overlooking the Urubamba River, is an Inca site called Q&#x27;ellu Raqay. Its interconnected buildings and plazas form an unusual design quite unlike the single-room structures common in Inca architecture. As the site is isolated from the rest of Ollantaytambo and surrounded by an elaborate terraces, it was postulated to be a palace built for emperor Pachacuti.

=== Storehouses ===

The Incas built several storehouses or &quot;qullqas&quot; () out of fieldstones on the hills surrounding Ollantaytambo. Their location at high altitudes, where more wind and lower temperatures occur, defended their contents against decay. To enhance this effect, the Ollantaytambo &quot;qullqas &quot;feature ventilation systems. They are thought to have been used to store the production of the agricultural terraces built around the site. Grain would be poured in the windows on the uphill side of each building, then emptied out through the downhill side window.

=== Quarries ===
The main quarries of Ollantaytambo were located at Kachiqhata, in a ravine across the Urubamba River some 5 km from the town. The site features three main quarrying areas: Mullup&#x27;urku, Kantirayoq, and Sirkusirkuyoq; all of them provided blocks of rose rhyolite for the elaborate buildings of the Temple Hill. An elaborate network of roads, ramps, and slides connected them with the main building areas. In the quarries are several &quot;chullpas&quot;, small stone towers used as burial sites in pre-Hispanic times.

=== Defenses ===

As Ollantaytambo is surrounded by mountains, and the main access routes run along the Urubamba Valley; there, the Incas built roads connecting the site with Machu Picchu to the west and Pisaq to the east. During the Spanish conquest of Peru, emperor Manco Inca fortified the eastern approaches to fend off Spanish attacks from Cusco during the Battle of Ollantaytambo. The first line of defense was a steep bank of terraces at Pachar, near the confluence of the Anta and Urubamba Rivers. Behind it, the Incas channeled the Urubamba to make it cross the valley from right to left and back, thus forming two more lines, which were backed by the fortifications of Choqana on the left bank and &#x27;Inkapintay on the right bank. Past them, at the plain of Mascabamba, 11 high terraces closed the valley between the mountains and a deep canyon formed by the Urubamba. The only way to continue was through the gate of T&#x27;iyupunku, a thick defensive wall with two narrow doorways. To the west of Ollantaytambo, the small fort of Choquequillca defended the road to Machu Picchu. In the event of these fortifications being overrun, the Temple Hill itself with its high terraces provided a last line of defense against invaders.

<text>The was the first in which Minamoto no Yoritomo, who became &quot;shōgun&quot; less than a decade later, was commander of the Minamoto forces. The battle was fought on September 14, 1180, in the southwest of present-day Odawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, near Yoritomo&#x27;s headquarters at Kamakura.

==Background==
Minamoto no Yoritomo was exiled by the leader of the Taira clan, Taira no Kiyomori, following the Heiji Rebellion of 1160. In the following years, the Taira clan attempted to consolidate their position, eventually forcing the Emperor Takakura to abdicate in favour of his infant son, Antoku, whose mother was a Taira. Prince Mochihito, brother of Emperor Takakura, felt that the Taira had denied his rightful claim to the throne, and in May 1180, issued an appeal to the Minamoto clan to rise against the Taira. As Yorimoto was married into the Hōjō clan, they helped fund his petition to claim himself as the head of the Minamoto clan.

When Kiyomori heard that Yoritomo had left Izu Province for the Hakone Pass, he appointed Ōba Kagechika to stop him. Although there was much sympathy for Yoritomo&#x27;s call to arms, the clans were wary of openly supporting him, and an army of only 300 gathered at Ishibashiyama where he had raised his standard. A force from the Miura clan, was prevented from reaching Yoritomo due to poor weather conditions which caused the Sakawa River near Kamakura to flood.

==Battle==
Ōba Kagechika launched a night attack on the Minamoto camp with 3,000 men during a heavy rainstorm. A further 300 soldiers under the command of Itō Sukechika skirted around the camp, attacking the Minamoto forces in the rear to cut off their way of retreat. At the same time the defenders were aided by members of Ōba&#x27;s forces who&#x27;s loyalties were questionable, and they decided to disrupt the assault against the Minamoto, using the dark and stormy conditions to avoid detection. Despite being greatly outnumbered, the soldiers of the Minamoto clan put up a valiant defense.

In the midst of the battle, Yoritomo&#x27;s brother-in-law Hōjō Munetoki, was killed. The imbalance in numbers between the two armies eventually forced Yoritomo to retreat, supposedly culminating in a last stand by Yoritomo and a single retainer by the trunk of a hollow tree. It is said that when they realized all was lost, Yoritomo and his companion hid inside the tree. Later, they are said to have been found by a Minamoto sympathizer serving in Ōba&#x27;s army and then successfully smuggled out of harms way. Yoritomo then fled by sea from Cape Manazuru to the Bōsō Peninsula in Awa Province in the south of present-day Chiba Prefecture on September 28, 1180.

<text>The Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (3C) is an astronomical catalogue of celestial radio sources detected originally at 159 MHz, and subsequently at 178 MHz.

==History==

===3C===
The catalogue was published in 1959 by members of the Radio Astronomy Group of the University of Cambridge. Entries in the catalogue are identified by the prefix &quot;3C&quot; followed by the entry number, with a space - for example, 3C 273. The number denotes objects in order of increasing right ascension. The catalogue was produced using the Cambridge Interferometer on the west side of Cambridge. The interferometer had previously been used for the Second Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (2C) survey, published in 1955.

===3CR===
The catalogue was subsequently revised by Bennett in 1962 using observations at 178 MHz, and for many years &#x27;3CR&#x27; was considered as the definitive listing of the brighter radio sources in the Northern Hemisphere. The revision resulted in a number of sources being deleted from the catalogue (as being below the flux limit of 9 Jy or as now-resolved blends of adjacent sources) and others being added. To avoid renumbering the existing sources (which were listed in RA order) these new sources were added using a decimal extension. E.g. 3C 323.1 follows 3C 323 in Right Ascension and precedes 3C 324.

===3CRR===
A further revision by R.A. Laing, Julia Riley and Malcolm Longair in 1983, called 3CRR or 3CR², included galaxies which were not detected in the original catalogue due to shortcomings of the original observations, but which otherwise meet the flux and declination limits. This revision includes all extragalactic radio sources in the Northern Hemisphere with 178-MHz flux density greater that 10.9 Janskys, declination greater than 10 degrees, and Galactic latitude greater than 10 degrees or less than -10 degrees. It excludes a number of well-known 3C/3CR objects, including all the supernova remnants from 3C, but also some well-known radio galaxies that lie outside the declination, flux density or galactic latitude constraints. Objects that had been discovered to consist of multiple components associated with different objects were given an alphabetical suffix (A, B...) to make it clear which component was part of the sample: e.g. the radio galaxy 3C 66B is part of the sample, but the BL Lac object 3C 66A is not.

<doc id="1254500" wikidata="Q7998275" url="?curid=1254500" title="Wicked Beat Sound System">
<text>Wicked Beat Sound System is a Sydney based group whose sound is best described as a mixture of electronica, dub and soul. The group formed in 1992, following a series of live &quot;jams&quot; instigated by DJ Dave Carnovale (Crucial D) in collaboration with Damian Robinson and other DJs Scott Pullen and Mark Walton which took place at the Bentley Bar c. 1991 in Sydney&#x27;s Darlinghurst area. They have released five albums to date. Originally featuring reggae and hip hop, the group expanded their sound to incorporate elements of soul, jazz, Latin, funk and breaks. They have been nominated for three ARIA Music Awards and an Australian Dance Music Award as well as creating dozens of remixes for others.

The lineup of the group was originally Linda Janssen and MC KYE on vocals, alongside producers Damian Robinson and DJ Dave Carnovale. Over the years many other artists have been included in the lineup of the &#x27;Live&#x27; band including Marko Simec (Waiting For Guinness), the late Bruce (Babs) Clarke, well known breaks producer Andy Page, Dave Norris (Nubreed) as well as current performers Gerard Masters, Ian Mussington and Cameron Undy. Dave Carnovale departed the band in 2003 to concentrate on his &#x27;Dubnosis&#x27; project and MC Kye departed the band shortly after the release of their fourth album &quot;4ormation&quot; in 2005 to work on his Budspells Album. They have headlined their own tours and have supported Ben Harper and The Fugees

==History==
Wicked Beat Sound System&#x27;s first single releases, &quot;Stand Up&quot;, &quot;Inside&quot; and &quot;Summer Sun&quot;, were produced by John Prior at Unity Gain Studios. &quot;Stand Up&quot; was the group&#x27;s first video, &quot;Inside&quot; and &quot;Summer Sun&quot; were originally released on Matt Hayward&#x27;s independent label One Movement, while &quot;Summer Sun&quot; was picked up by DJ Andy Glitre and continued to receive high rotation on national radio network Triple J for several years. The first album release, &quot;Music From The Core&quot; was also originally released on One Movement in 1996 and the single &quot;Local MP&quot; also achieved high radio rotation. These tracks were featured on the soundtrack to the French film &quot;Clubbed to Death (Lola)&quot;. They collaborated with other local artists such as Yothu Yindi, Directions in Groove, Deborah Conway, Iva Davies, Christine Anu and Renee Geyer.

The second album, &quot;Inna Styles&quot; was released through Mushroom Records in 1999, followed by an extensive touring schedule. Three singles from the album &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna know&quot;, &quot;Church of Al Green&quot;, and &quot;Stay With Me Til Dawn&quot; were again featured on Triple J. The album also featured dancefloor tracks &quot;Cookin&#x27; with Kazz&quot; and &quot;Genie of the Lab&quot;. 

In 2000 Wicked Beat Sound System received an ARIA nomination for &quot;Inna Styles&quot; and a Dance Music Award nomination (DMA) for Best Band. They also played festivals across Australia including the Perth International Arts Festival, Vibes On a Summer&#x27;s Day and the closing of the Sydney Paralympics.

In September 2002, the third album, &quot;New Soul Breaks&quot;, was released and featured vocal tracks by Janssen including &quot;I Want To&quot; and &quot;Brand New Day&quot;, as well as instrumental tracks &quot;Do The Tings&quot; and &quot;Ounce Of Swing&quot;. In the same year they received another ARIA nomination for &quot;Best Dance Release&quot;. In 2005 Wicked Beat Sound System released &quot;4ormation&quot; featuring the track &quot;Nightmare&quot;. Shortly after the release of &quot;4ormation&quot; MC Kye departed the group to concentrate on his solo project and the group ceased touring for a period of time. In 2006, Wicked Beat Sound System, now largely Robinson and Janssen, recorded &quot;Hydromajestik&quot; which was released on 24 March 2007. More in the vein of their previous &quot;Inna Styles&quot; album, this album featured vocal tracks in addition to dub-influenced instrumentals. The first single was &quot;Won&#x27;t Let Go&quot;.

In 2008 WBSS released the album &quot;Dreaming&quot;, originally a commissioned piece of work written by Damian Robinson. He was approached by Indigenous Artistic director Rhoda Roberts to compose the music for a Cleansing Ceremony she was directing called Sydney Dreaming which was to be a theatrical adaptation of the rainmaker creation story. Since that performance, variations of this music have been performed at several festivals and ceremonies including Woodford Festival and Perth Festival. &quot;Dreaming&quot; was the culmination of several years&#x27; work. The original concept was penned in the heat of a Byron Bay summer and completed in WB&#x27;s studio in Sydney and then Bungendore. The themes revolve around Salt Water, Fresh Water and Desert, three dividing realities for Aboriginal people&#x27;s connection to country.

The &quot;Dreaming&quot; album was nominated for an ARIA Award in 2009 in the category of Best World Music Album.

Reworked variations from this album were used to make the soundtrack for the Lighting of the Sydney Opera House Sails for Vivid Festival 2016 along with Badu Gili (meaning &#x27;water light&#x27; in the language of the traditional owners of Bennelong Point), which accompanies a contemporary Aboriginal art projection performed each evening year-round on the western sails of the Sydney Opera House.

In 2017 Robinson was also commissioned to compose the soundtrack for the Parrtjima Festival at Alice Springs. The festival involved five Aboriginal art centres and showcased the work of 20 Aboriginal artists. &quot;Parrtjima&quot; (pronounced Par-CHee-ma) means &#x27;lighting up&#x27; and conveys two meanings: physically illuminating an object with light and &#x27;lighting up&#x27; as in to shed light and understanding on a subject. This public event transformed Alice Springs Desert Park into a mesmerising outdoor gallery of light and sound including a breathtaking illumination of a 300-million-year-old natural canvas, 2 km of the majestic MacDonnell Ranges, a series of new installations involving Aboriginal artists from the Central Desert Region.

<text>Peter Athans (born March 1, 1957) is one of the world&#x27;s foremost high-altitude mountaineers. In 2008 he was celebrated for summiting Mount Everest seven times, and was given the moniker &quot;Mr. Everest&quot;. His first attempt to climb Everest in 1985 via the West Ridge, and further attempts in 1986, 1987, and 1989 were unsuccessful, but he succeeded in summitting in 1990 as part of an expedition that included Scott Fischer and Wally Berg.

Athans is one of several western Himalayan guides who have adopted Nepal as a second home, and who have taken up the cause of the Sherpa people and their culture.

== Rescues ==
In 1996 he was a key participant in the rescue of several climbers during the May 1996 Everest Disaster. For his efforts the American Alpine Club awarded him and his partner Todd Burleson and Anatoli Boukreev the David A. Sowles Memorial Award.

The next year, Athans removed the body of a friend - Bruce Herrod, a South African climber who had perished just weeks after the 1996 disaster, from the climbing route high up on the mountain. He found Herrod hanging upside down by the climbing ropes that the photographer had been using to make his way down the dangerous Hillary Step section of the mountain, just below the summit. Four expeditions had climbed past his body before the removal of Herrod&#x27;s body, which was cut loose and pushed over the edge. Athans returned the camera and ice axe of the dead climber to his family. The last pictures Herrod took, shortly after 5PM the night he summitted, were of himself, on the summit, smiling that he had at last reached this goal.

<doc id="1254515" wikidata="Q12062352" url="?curid=1254515" title="Nash the Slash">
<text>James Jeffrey &quot;Jeff&quot; Plewman (March 26, 1948 – May 10, 2014), better known by his stage name Nash the Slash, was a Canadian musician. A multi-instrumentalist, he was known primarily for playing the electric violin and mandolin, as well as the harmonica, keyboards, glockenspiel, and other instruments (sometimes described as &quot;devices&quot; on album notes).

Nash worked as a solo artist beginning in 1975; founding the progressive rock band FM in 1976. Soon after releasing the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Black Noise&quot;, in 1977, he left the band; he resumed his solo career in 1978 (it was not until after Nash&#x27;s departure that the album was widely promoted, eventually charting and receiving a gold record award). He rejoined FM from 1983 to 1988, followed by a brief reunion from 1994 to 1996, all concurrent with his solo work.

Nash&#x27;s music covers an eclectic range, varying from instrumental—mood-setting music, to rock and pop music with vocals. In addition to giving concert performances, he composed and performed soundtrack music for silent films, presenting these works live in movie theatres to accompany screenings of the films. Another venue for his music was in performances to accompany the viewing of paintings by surrealist painter Robert Vanderhorst, an audiovisual collaboration, which took place in 1978 and again in 2004.

Nash famously never allowed guitars on any of his solo albums and singles. He turned down Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour&#x27;s offer to lay down a guitar track on his album &quot;Children of the Night&quot;.

==Identity==
Nash was born in Toronto. He performed with surgical bandages covering his face starting in 1979. &quot;During a gig at The Edge in the late 1970s to raise awareness of the threat from the Three Mile Island disaster, he walked on stage wearing bandages dipped in phosphorus paint and exclaimed: &#x27;Look, this is what happens to you.&#x27; The bandages became his trademark.&quot; Prior to 1979, Nash performed three times on TV Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Nightmusic Concert&quot;, first as a solo artist (a live broadcast which was never re-aired), then with FM (Nash and Cameron Hawkins), and again as a solo artist. In all of these appearances Nash wore his typical black tuxedo, top hat, and dark sunglasses, but not his signature bandages. He was also photographed in this attire for a profile in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, published April 28, 1978.

In later years, he attempted to keep his true identity the subject of some speculation, although the &quot;Star&quot; profile of 1978 had already matter-of-factly revealed his real name. Nevertheless, in a 1981 interview with the UK magazine &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Nash was questioned about his real name, and replied with &quot;Nashville Thebodiah Slasher&quot;. As a result of his coyness about his name, some fans came to believe that the Nash persona was an alter-ego of Ben Mink, who replaced him as FM&#x27;s violinist in 1978. This is a common misconception, but he has been photographed onstage with Mink.

The &quot;Nash the Slash&quot; persona came from silent film, and Nash said he took his stage name from that of a killer butler encountered by Laurel and Hardy in one of their first films, &quot;Do Detectives Think?&quot; (1927), for which he composed a soundtrack score.
(The film character&#x27;s name is actually &quot;The Tipton Slasher&quot;; nowhere on screen does &quot;Nash the Slash&quot; appear.)

Images of Nash the Slash are featured in a variety of murals painted by artist Jungle Ling in Toronto. These images are located in the Leslieville district, next to a TD Bank at Queen St. East and Logan Avenue and below Queen St. East on Connaught Avenue, as part of a neighborhood beautification project conducted by the Toronto Transit Commission.

There was an urban legend that Nash the Slash was actually Canadian country artist Anne Murray in disguise.

==Career==
Nash&#x27;s music is a complex blend of progressive rock, new wave, new age, and punk rock, using electric mandolins, violins, drum machines, and a variety of effects and sonic devices. He wrote, played, and produced most of the material on his solo albums by himself, though he also worked with producers Daniel Lanois, Steve Hillage, and Bill Nelson.

===First group===
Before working as a solo artist, Nash recorded an unreleased song called &quot;Slasher&quot; with a group called Breathless, which also included his (and FM&#x27;s) future producer, Michael Waite on bass guitar. The song appeared on a &quot;various artists&quot; promotional album titled &quot;Concept&quot; (after the Toronto-based management company, Concept 376; this was one of a series of such albums), but was not issued to the public in any form. The promo album does not list the group&#x27;s personnel, or even a songwriting credit, but Nash is clearly heard singing a song, beginning with the lyrics &quot;Hear the children of the night&quot; (though this was a completely different song from his later work, &quot;Children of the Night&quot;), and playing electric violin. The song also featured a complex organ solo not in Nash&#x27;s usual style (nor that of Cameron Hawkins, his bandmate in FM).

===First solo career and film work===
Nash&#x27;s first solo performance and live presentation of music to film occurred when he played his soundtrack to Luis Buñuel&#x27;s silent film &quot;Un chien andalou&quot; (1929) at The Original 99 Cent Roxy Theatre in Toronto on March 17, 1975.

===Silent film composition===
He also composed music for other classic silent films including &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920). When performing soundtracks, Nash would appear on stage beside the screen (using his own projection screen when a full theatre screen is not available), the same format he used when performing concerts. He also composed scores for modern Canadian films &quot;Roadkill&quot; (1990) and &quot;Highway 61&quot; (1991), both directed by Bruce McDonald. His other movie score and soundtrack work included the short film &quot;A Trip Around Lake Ontario&quot; (1985), The Kidnapping of the President&quot; (1980), &quot;Black Pearls&quot; (1989), and &quot;Blood and Donuts&quot; (1995).

During this time, Nash made his first appearance on record, on David Pritchard&#x27;s solo album &quot;Nocturnal Earthworm Stew&quot; (1976), with a short solo track titled &quot;Nash Metropolitan&quot; (named after Nash Metropolitan), and on an improvised piece with Pritchard and drummer Martin Deller (with whom he would later work in FM). He also appeared on the live TV-Ontario program &quot;Nightmusic&quot; (before its change in format, where it became &quot;Nightmusic Concert&quot;); in this incarnation, the show was a televised version of an FM radio show hosted by disc jockey Reiner Schwarz, and had not previously featured a live performer. Nash claimed he was both the first and last musical artist to appear on the show.

===Work with FM===
After working as a solo artist for a year, Nash formed the group FM in 1976, initially as a duo with Cameron Hawkins; drummer Martin Deller was added later. The group began recording in July 1976, though no performances in its duo format were issued at the time. However, they did appear on television and in live concerts, beginning in November 1976. In 1977, with Deller added to the group, they recorded the album &quot;Black Noise&quot;, which received a gold record award. It was listed as one of the &quot;Top 50 Prog Rock Albums&quot; by Rolling Stone magazine. By the end of 1977, Nash had left FM, and resumed his solo career starting with another television appearance on &quot;Nightmusic Concert&quot; on February 28, 1978. Nash rejoined FM from 1983 to 1989, and again from 1994 to 1996. During these years, he recorded a further three albums with the group. FM also recorded three albums during Nash&#x27;s absence (1977 to 1980), with Ben Mink as his replacement.

===Late 1970s and 1980===
Nash had intended to restart his solo career in 1978 with a new album featuring all the music from his &quot;Nightmusic Concert&quot; TV special, plus his soundtrack for &quot;Un chien andalou&quot;, but found the sound quality of a test pressing to be unsatisfactory, so he issued a four-song 12-inch EP titled &quot;Bedside Companion&quot; instead, on his own label, Cut-throat Records, which he continued to operate for the rest of his life. A full album, &quot;Dreams and Nightmares&quot; with the rest of the Nightmusic material, the soundtrack, and a few new songs, appeared the following year. All music from these records was instrumental, and both are now available on one CD titled &quot;Blind Windows&quot; which also includes the 45 rpm EP playing at 33 rpm as the &quot;Marsden versions&quot;, a joking reference to disc jockey David Marsden who mistakenly played the entire record at the wrong speed on radio when it was released.

Also in 1979, Nash thanked Toronto radio station CFNY-FM for their support of his music, by playing electric violin on the station&#x27;s theme song, which was recorded by various disc jockeys of the station in a strange blend of new wave and country music. It was released as &quot;Working on the Radio&quot; by the 102.1 Band, as a single on Ready Records. The B-side has an extended version with a longer solo by Nash, who is not credited on the cover.

Nash&#x27;s solo career up to this point had only a small cult following, due to his working exclusively as an instrumentalist. His next record, a 1980 single featuring a cover version of Jan and Dean&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; with vocals, propelled him to greater public recognition. The B-side, &quot;Swing Shift (Souixante-Neuf)&quot; also featured vocals, and was co-composed with lyricist Toby Dammit, with whom Nash further collaborated over the next few years. Music videos were made for both songs.

Nash also played on three songs by Toronto group Drastic Measures for their self-titled album, including violins on their signature tune, a cover version of the children&#x27;s song, &quot;The Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot;. Nash&#x27;s label, Cut-throat Records, later issued a single by the group, the only other artist to appear on his label, although Nash was not involved in its recording. Nash&#x27;s later soundtrack album for &quot;Highway 61&quot; includes tracks by Tony Malone, the lead singer for Drastic Measures.

Nash was invited by Gary Numan to tour the UK as his support act in 1980 and 1981, and subsequently played on Numan&#x27;s 1981 LP &quot;Dance&quot;. He also toured Europe with The Tubes. He was signed to the Dindisc label and in 1981, he released the album &quot;Children of the Night&quot; in Europe, also released in Canada shortly after. Several British singles were also issued. These records appeared on the Dindisc / Cut-throat label in Europe and on Virgin / Dindisc / Cut-throat in Canada.

===Mid 1980s===
Returning to Toronto in spring 1981, Nash released an instrumental &quot;mini-album&quot; &quot;Decomposing&quot; (1981), which purported to be playable at any speed, with song timings on the label quoting three lengths, depending on whether the record is played at 33, 45, or 78 RPM. However, songs from this record also appeared on compilation albums and singles, where they always play as heard when &quot;Decomposing&quot; is played at 45 rpm. The EP was reissued on vinyl, CD and download in 2017 by Toronto label Artoffact Records, with the CD and download containing the four songs as they sound at 45, 33 and 78 RPM, in that order.

In 1981, Iggy Pop name-checked Nash during the fade-out on the song Eggs on Plate singing &quot;Hey Nash the Slash, why did you leave your sticker on the ceiling of my forty-two dollar and fifty cent motel suite?!&quot; A year later, Nash got a call from Iggy who invited him to be his opening act on tour.

Nash&#x27;s next album was &quot;And You Thought You Were Normal&quot; (1982). This included the track &quot;Dance After Curfew&quot; produced by Daniel Lanois prior to his association with Brian Eno. The single became a surprise club and radio hit in Poland, which was then still behind the iron curtain, where curfews and restrictions on western culture were imposed by the government of the time. A 12-inch single featuring a remixed and extended version of the song was issued in the USA on PVC Records.

Nash&#x27;s next project was an album of American rock classics titled &quot;American Band-ages&quot;. Nash enlisted the help of his former FM collaborators Cameron Hawkins (keyboards) and Martin Deller (drums), and the album was released in 1984. The album was aimed at the US market, but due to distribution and management problems, including a change in record labels (to MCA, after Quality Records folded in 1985), it never got the exposure Nash thought it deserved. In the same year, Nash released a compilation album (with most tracks remixed) titled &quot;The Million Year Picnic&quot; on Ralph Records in the United States, the label which was home to The Residents.

While working on &quot;American Band-ages&quot; in 1983, he proposed to promote it with a double bill tour with his former band FM. But Ben Mink, Nash&#x27;s replacement, had left the band that year; therefore, Nash rejoined the group, staying with them from 1983 to 1989 (followed by a reunion tour from 1994 to 1996), and retaining the idea of a double bill by performing solo as the opening act. With Nash, FM released further albums: &quot;Con-Test&quot; (1985), &quot;Tonight&quot; (1987), and &quot;RetroActive&quot; (1995).

In 1985, Nash sued PepsiCo for using his likeness in commercials without permission; PepsiCo subsequently settled out of court, pulling the commercial from broadcast and paying Nash&#x27;s legal fees.

===1990–2011===

After the break-up of FM in 1989, Nash embarked on a series of film soundtrack projects, and revived his Cut-throat label in 1991 to issue these on CD, and has also used it to re-issue his earlier records. New albums of songs with vocals have also been released on the label: &quot;Thrash&quot; (1999) and &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Nash&quot; (2008), the latter consisting entirely of cover versions.

During 1992-3 Nash the Slash collaborated with the electronic music artist Plexus to create a series of visually intense live shows called Psychedelitron. They performed Psychedelitron live between 1993 and 1995. In 1993, the show was performed only at Stratenger&#x27;s in Toronto, Canada, every third Saturday of the month from March to October. The performed two sets, each a mix of Nash the Slash and Plexus songs. Later, in 1994 and 1995, they took the show to other venues, including the grand opening of the Toronto Public Library at 239 College Street to commemorate the inclusion of the Merril Collection of Science Fiction, Speculation &amp; Fantasy in this library location.

Psychedelitron used intense visuals, including a refinement of Nash&#x27;s psychedelic projector lighting, strategically placed pin lights to increase the perception of the stage size, strobe lights, fog and indirect and silhouette lighting. The techniques used during Psychedelitron, and their subsequent refinement during the reign of the shows became an important visual aspect to Nash&#x27;s later shows. Psychedelitron was also used as way to re-define Nash&#x27;s shows both visually and musically.

In 1998, Nash performed as part of Toronto&#x27;s Pride Week, publicly acknowledging that he was gay.

During 2004 and 2005, he was again working with Robert Vanderhorst, under the name &quot;Two Artists&quot;, on the project &quot;View From the Gallery&quot;, a live multimedia event presenting a fusion of surrealistic visuals with classic stylings in music.

Nash appeared as a character in several comic books by Matt Howarth, including issues #2–7 of &quot;Savage Henry&quot;. Nash also provided original music on a CD for Howarth&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;The Simultaneous Man&quot;.

Nash continued to tour, mostly in his native Ontario, but occasionally elsewhere, including a 2008 tour of the UK, which resulted in a live CD/DVD.

2011 saw Nash release his first ever compilation album, &quot;The Reckless Use of Electricity&quot;.

===2012===
Nash announced his retirement via his website on November 6, 2012, stating he was &quot;rolling up the bandages&quot; and shutting down his official website on December 31. He thanked his loyal fans for their support during his 40 years as an independent artist, but stated that live gigs no longer excited him and that his &quot;eccentric style/genre finds no place into today&#x27;s scene.&quot; He also mentioned the &quot;theft of music on the internet devastated a very important source of [his] income.&quot;

==Death==
On May 10, 2014, Nash died at his home in Toronto, at age 66, from a suspected heart attack. Robert Vanderhorst confirmed his death to the media two days later.

=== Legacy ===
Since his death in 2014, Nash the Slash&#x27;s career and recordings are being preserved by The Nash the Slash Legacy. His website was relaunched late in 2014, and costumes and instruments were donated to the National Music Centre in Calgary. He was declared a Canadian Innovator by NMC and his Vladimir Bosnar custom skull mandolin is on display in the Canadian Music Hall of Fame wing. A distribution deal was signed with Artoffact Records in Toronto in early 2015 to release all six of his albums from the 1980s - &quot;Bedside Companion&quot;, &quot;Dreams and Nightmares&quot;, &quot;Children of the Night&quot;, the rare and previously commercially unreleased live album &quot;Hammersmith Holocaust&quot;, &quot;Decomposing&quot;, as well as &quot;And You Thought You Were Normal&quot;. Artoffact re-released them, plus a download of the &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; single, on CD, vinyl and download between 2016-2017. As of 2024, all the physical releases are out of print, but the downloads of all of these titles except &quot;Children&quot; were still available on Bandcamp.

Filming began on a Nash the Slash documentary in early 2017. The film is being produced by Side Three Media in collaboration with The Nash the Slash Legacy and is called &quot;Nash the Slash Rises Again!&quot; As of 2024, the film remains unreleased.

His white tuxedo and top hat will be on display to the public and are being loaned to the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, QC for a 2018 exhibit about popular music in Canada from the 1960s to 1980s.

Giussani joined TED in 2005, and produced the first TEDGlobal event in Oxford, England. TEDGlobal 2014 took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, while TEDSummit 2019 was held in Edinburgh, Scotland.

==Human Rights Film Festival FIFDH==
Since 2017 Giussani is the chairman of the Geneva International Film Festival on Human Rights (FIFDH in its French acronym).

==Journalism==
Prior to joining TED, Giussani was a well-known writer and commentator. For several years he edited the political section of Swiss news magazine &quot;L&#x27;Hebdo&quot; before becoming its US correspondent and, later, its technology columnist and editor of the first Swiss online news web site, Webdo, launched in 1995. His writings have been published in newspapers, magazines and websites in Europe and the United States, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; (for which he wrote the EuroBytes column from 1996 to 2000), &quot;The Wall Street Journal Europe&quot;, the European editions of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Business Week&quot;, &quot;The International Herald Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot; (Switzerland), &quot;L&#x27;Hebdo&quot; (Switzerland), &quot;Libération&quot; (France), &quot;Il Sole-24Ore&quot; (Italy), &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, and more. He was also the European editor of the now-defunct &quot;Industry Standard&quot; magazine and one of the founding editors of its European version, and the producer of the magazine&#x27;s Global Internet Summit (Barcelona, 2000).

His former blog, Lunch Over IP, which he wrote from 2005 to 2008 (still available online as an archive) won him a national &quot;Golden Mouse&quot; award in 2006 for the best Swiss theme blog, while his articles on technology and innovation in &quot;L&#x27;Hebdo&quot; were awarded in 1995 the Swiss prize for technology journalism.

==Books==
He has authored or co-authored several books, favoring a pragmatic, no-hype approach. A reviewer in &quot;The International Herald Tribune&quot; wrote that in his book &quot;Roam. Making Sense of the Wireless Internet&quot; (Random House, 2001 and 2002) he &quot;first bursts the bubble of mobile hype and then explains why wireless communications really matters and how it works.&quot;

==Other idea sharing initiatives==
In 2005 he launched with L&#x27;Hebdo the annual Forum des 100 in Lausanne, which he hosted for 10 years and which is today considered the foremost conference in Western Switzerland. He has also been instrumental in launching and developing the LIFT conference (Geneva, Switzerland) and was an adviser to the DLD conference (Munich, Germany) among other ideas-sharing initiatives. From 1998 to 2000 he was Head of Online Strategy at the World Economic Forum (also known as the Davos Forum). He was a member of the jury of Bloomberg Philanthropies&#x27; Mayors Challenge 2014.

==Internet companies==
Giussani has co-founded two Internet companies: Tinet, in 1995, the first Internet service provider in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland (then sold to Swissonline/Cablecom), and Tinext, in 2000, a software firm with offices in Switzerland, Italy and Dubai, of which he is Vice-Chairman. He was the Director of Innovation of the short-lived 3GMobile, an attempt to launch a new mobile telecom player in Switzerland. From 2002 to 2008 he was a member of the board of Namics, the largest Swiss Internet consultancy.

==Education==
Giussani is an alumnus of the University of Geneva, where he graduated in Social and Economic Sciences in 1989. He was a 2004 Fellow at the John S. Knight Fellowships for Professional Journalists at Stanford University and an Affiliated Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford.

<text>The was a battle of the Genpei War of the Heian period of Japanese history. It took place in 1180, in what is now Shizuoka Prefecture.

== Background ==
Minamoto no Yoritomo, using Kamakura as his headquarters, sent his counselor Hōjō Tokimasa in August 1180 to convince the warlords Takeda of Kai and Nitta of Kotsuke to follow Yoritomo&#x27;s command as he marched against the Taira.

As Yoritomo continued through the region below Mount Fuji and into Suruga Province, he planned a rendezvous with the Takeda clan and other families of the provinces of Kai and Kōzuke to the north. These allies arrived at the rear of the Taira army in time to ensure a Minamoto victory.

== Battle ==
During the night, Yoritomo launched an attack against the large Taira army camp. The Taira became alarmed when a flock of waterfowl flew over their camp, and the &quot;small surprise became a rout&quot;.

<doc id="1254532" wikidata="Q4960674" url="?curid=1254532" title="Brenda Elliott">
<text>Brenda Elliott (born October 27, 1950) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Progressive Conservative from 1995 to 2003, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.

==Background==
Elliott was born in Goderich, Ontario. She went to McMaster University, and worked as a teacher and librarian. In 1972, she was elected to the Wellington County Board of Education. She became interested in environmental causes during the 1990s, and in November 1989 opened a store in Guelph, Ontario called For Earth&#x27;s Sake.

==Politics==
Elliott was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating former Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Rick Ferraro and incumbent New Democrat Derek Fletcher in the Guelph constituency. The Tories won a majority government in this election under Mike Harris&#x27;s leadership, and Elliott was appointed as Minister of Environment and Energy on June 26, 1995.

Due to Elliott&#x27;s background in the environmental movement, many believed she would be a strong advocate for &quot;green&quot; policies in the Harris cabinet. She was dropped from cabinet on August 16, 1996, and served as a backbench supporter in the legislature for the next three years.

Elliott was easily re-elected in the 1999 provincial election for the redistributed riding of Guelph—Wellington by about ten thousand votes. On February 8, 2001, she returned to cabinet as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. When Ernie Eves replaced Mike Harris as Premier of Ontario in 2002, he named Elliott as his Minister of Community, Family and Children&#x27;s Services.

The Tories were defeated in the 2003 provincial election, and Elliott lost her seat to Liberal candidate Liz Sandals by 2,800 votes.

<doc id="1254537" wikidata="Q380665" url="?curid=1254537" title="PLS (file format)">
<text>PLS is a computer file format for a multimedia playlist. It is typically used by media players for streaming media over the Internet, but may also be used for playing local media.

For online streaming, typically the .PLS file would be downloaded just once from the media source—such as from an online radio station—for immediate or future use. While most computers and players automatically recognize the .PLS format, the first time a PLS file is used on a computer, the media player&#x27;s settings may need to be changed to recognize (&quot;associated&quot; with) .PLS files.

PLS was originally developed for use with the museArc audio player software by codeArts, and was later used by SHOUTcast and Icecast for streaming media over the Internet. 

==File format==
The format is case-sensitive and essentially that of an INI file structured as follows

Header
*[playlist] : &quot;This tag indicates that it is a Playlist File&quot;

Track Entry
&quot;Assuming track entry #X&quot;
*FileX : &quot;Variable defining location of media file/stream (like .m3u/.m3u8 playlists).&quot;
*TitleX : &quot;Defines track title. (optional)&quot;
*LengthX : &quot;Length in seconds of track. Value of -1 indicates indefinite (streaming). (optional)&quot;
&quot;If file metadata includes a title already, then the TitleX entry will not be displayed.&quot;

Footer
*NumberOfEntries : &quot;This variable indicates the number of tracks and therefore equals the number used for the last track&quot;
*Version : &quot;Playlist version. Currently only a value of 2 is valid.&quot;

===Examples===
Example of a complete PLS file used for &quot;streaming audio;&quot; in this case, to connect to a particular online radio station and receive its audio stream:

[playlist]
File1=https://e20.yesstreaming.net:8279/
Title1=Here enter name of the station
NumberOfEntries=1
Alternative Example containing local paths:

[playlist]

File1=https://e20.yesstreaming.net:8279/
Length1=-1

File2=example2.mp3
Title2=Just some local audio that is 2mins long
Length2=120

File3=F:\Music\whatever.m4a
Title3=absolute path on Windows

File4=%UserProfile%\Music\short.ogg
Title4=example for an Environment variable
Length4=5

NumberOfEntries=4
Version=2
;Unix/BSD/Linux/OS X
In Unix-like operating systems absolute and relative file paths differ from Windows, because there are no drive letters, Environment variables differ and [/] (forward slashes) are used as directory separators instead of [\] (backslashes). Therefore, playlists pointing to absolute paths or media files outside of the folder containing the playlist will only work for one type of operating system - either Windows or Unix-like. URLs work the same for all types.

To make the second example from above work the 3rd and 4th path need to be changed to something like:

File3=/media/hdd/whatever.m4a
File4=~/Music/short.ogg
==Compatible media player software==

iTunes, VLC media player, GNOME Videos, RealPlayer, Winamp, Yahoo! Music Jukebox, MediaMonkey, Windows Media Player, AIMP, Kodi, Rhythmbox, foobar2000, Audacious and more than 30 others are able to interpret (open) PLS files. Media Player Classic with the K-Lite codec installed does work with PLS format, but still requires the appropriate MIME or file extension associations.

<doc id="1254542" wikidata="Q2890114" url="?curid=1254542" title="Battle of Sunomata-gawa">
<text>The took place in Japan on 6 June 1181 (or by the Japanese calendar, Jishō-5 year, 4-month, 25-day), in the present-day town of Sunomata, Gifu Prefecture. The battle started when Minamoto no Yukiie attempted a sneak attack across the Sunomata River against his enemies during the night. He found Taira no Tomomori and his army directly opposite his, along the Sunomata River, near the borders of Owari and Mino provinces.

The Minamoto warriors waded across, but their ambush failed when the Taira clan could distinguish dry friend from soaking, dripping wet foe, even in the pitch dark of night. Yukiie and a number of other surviving Minamoto were forced back across the river.

After crossing the river, the Minamoto went to the Yahagi River in Mikawa Province, but the Taira chased after them.

<doc id="1254545" wikidata="Q2604205" url="?curid=1254545" title="William Dorsey Pender">
<text>William Dorsey Pender (February 6, 1834 – July 18, 1863) was a general in the Confederacy in the American Civil War serving as a brigade and divisional commander. Promoted to brigadier on the battlefield at Seven Pines by Confederate President Jefferson Davis in person, he fought in the Seven Days Battles and at Second Manassas, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville, being wounded in each of these engagements. Lee rated him as one of the most promising of his commanders, promoting him to major general at twenty-nine. Pender was mortally wounded on the second day at Gettysburg.

==Early life==
Dorsey Pender, as he was known to his friends, was born on February 6, 1834, at Pender&#x27;s Crossroads, Edgecombe County, North Carolina, to James and Sally Routh Pender, the youngest of four children, with two brothers and a sister. His father was a planter who owned more than 500 acres and 21 slaves in the vicinity of Tarboro, making the family a member of the local elite. Though descended from Virginians, Pender&#x27;s parents were longtime residents of Edgecombe County. He spent his youth on the farm, hunting, fishing, and riding, before becoming a teenaged clerk in the Tarboro store owned by his older brother, Robert.

He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1854, 19th out of 46 in his class, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Artillery. He served later in the 1st Dragoons (heavy cavalry), where he demonstrated personal bravery in Washington Territory, fighting in the Indian Wars.

==Civil War==
On March 21, 1861, Pender resigned from the U.S. Army and was appointed a captain of artillery in the Confederate States Army. By May he was a colonel in command of the 3rd North Carolina Infantry (also designated the 13th North Carolina) and then the 6th North Carolina. Tried in combat successfully in the Battle of Seven Pines in June 1862, he was promoted to brigadier general and command of a brigade of North Carolinians in Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill&#x27;s &quot;Light Division&quot;. Confederate President Jefferson Davis personally promoted Pender on the Seven Pines battlefield.

During the Seven Days Battles, Pender was an aggressive brigade commander. He was wounded in the arm at the Battle of Glendale, but recovered quickly enough to rejoin his brigade and fight at Cedar Mountain, Second Manassas (where he received a minor head wound from an exploding shell), Harpers Ferry, and the Battle of Sharpsburg. At Sharpsburg, Pender arrived in the nick of time with A.P. Hill after a 17-mile march to save the Army of Northern Virginia from serious defeat on its right flank.

At Fredericksburg, he was wounded again, in his left arm, but the bone was unbroken, so he continued in command, despite the spectacle of him riding around bleeding. At Chancellorsville, on May 2, 1863, A.P. Hill was wounded in Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson&#x27;s famous march and attack on the flank of the Union XI Corps; Pender assumed command of the division. On the following day, Pender was wounded in the arm yet again, this time a minor injury from a spent bullet that had killed an officer who stood in front of him.

Following the death of Jackson, Gen. Robert E. Lee reorganized his army and promoted A.P. Hill to command the newly formed Third Corps. Pender, at the young age of 29, was promoted to major general and division command. He was well regarded by his superiors. Lee wrote to Jefferson Davis, &quot;Pender is an excellent officer, attentive, industrious and brave; has been conspicuous in every battle, and, I believe, wounded in almost all of them.&quot;

==Death==
Dorsey Pender&#x27;s promising career ended at the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 1, 1863, his division moved in support of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth&#x27;s division down the Chambersburg Pike towards Gettysburg. Heth encountered stronger resistance from the Union I Corps than he expected and was repulsed in his first assault. Uncharacteristically for the normally aggressive Pender, he did not immediately charge in to assist Heth, but took up positions on Herr Ridge and awaited developments. In Heth&#x27;s second assault of the day, Hill ordered Pender to support Heth, but Heth declined the assistance and Pender once again kept his division in the rear. For the second time in the day, Heth got more than he bargained for in his assault on McPherson&#x27;s Ridge. He was wounded in action and could not request the assistance from Pender he had earlier refused. Hill ordered Pender to attack the new Union position on Seminary Ridge at about 4 p.m. The 30-minute assault by three of his brigades was very bloody and the brigade of Brig. Gen. Alfred M. Scales was almost completely destroyed by Union artillery canister fire. In the end, Pender&#x27;s men forced the Union troops back in and through Gettysburg.

On July 2, Pender was posted near the Lutheran Seminary. During the &quot;en echelon&quot; attack that started with James Longstreet&#x27;s assault on the right, from the Round Tops through the Peach Orchard, Pender&#x27;s division was to continue in the attack sequence near Cemetery Hill, to the left of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson&#x27;s attack on Cemetery Ridge. Pender was wounded in the thigh by a shell fragment fired from Cemetery Hill, and turned command over to Brig. Gen. James H. Lane. His division&#x27;s momentum was broken by the change in command and no effective assault was completed. Pender was evacuated to Staunton, Virginia, where an artery in his leg ruptured on July 18. Surgeons amputated his leg in an attempt to save him, but he died a few hours later.

His superiors wrote in their official reports of the Gettysburg Campaign about Pender&#x27;s death:

==Legacy==
He is buried in the graveyard at Calvary Episcopal Church, Tarboro, North Carolina. He is memorialized in the name of Pender County, North Carolina, founded in 1875. He is the posthumous author of &quot;The General to his Lady: The Civil War letters of William Dorsey Pender to Fanny Pender&quot;, published in 1965.

During World War II, the United States Navy commissioned a Liberty Ship, the SS &quot;William D. Pender&quot;, in honor of the fallen general.

<text>Lidzbark () is a town with 8,670 inhabitants in the Warmia-Masurian Voivodeship in Poland. It is located on the Wel river and Lake Lidzbark. The postal code for the entire area is 13-230. The town is popularly referred to as Lidzbark Welski, to distinguish it from Lidzbark Warmiński.

==History==
Lidzbark was founded in 1301. The town&#x27;s Roman Catholic parish church was constructed in 1350.

Władysław II Jagiełło led his army through Lidzbark on July 9, 1410 before the Battle of Grunwald. On September 29, 1413, some of the Teutonic Knights in the town revolted against Heinrich von Plauen the Elder; they were only appeased with Plauen&#x27;s replacement with Michael Küchmeister von Sternberg. The town joined the Prussian Confederation, which opposed Teutonic rule, and upon the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon reincorporated the territory to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. In May 1454 Lidzbark pledged allegiance to the Polish King in Toruń. At the Second Peace of Thorn (1466) the Teutonic Knights renounced claims to the town and recognized it as part of Poland. Administratively it was located in the Chełmno Voivodeship in the province of Royal Prussia in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. A large portion of the city was destroyed by fire in 1764.

During the First Partition of Poland, the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772. During the Napoleonic Wars it was part of the Polish Duchy of Warsaw from 1807 to 1815, but was reannexed by Prussia afterwards.

In 1772, the town had 510 inhabitants and 83 timbered buildings. Agriculture was common in the area along with crafting. In 1789, the population reached 802 of which 41 families were craftsmen.

In the beginning of the 20th century, the city had breweries, sawmills, iron mill, engine works and dairy products. In 1920, the area was reintegrated with Poland after it regained independence.

During World War II, it was under German occupation. The population in 1943 was 4,329. 70% of the city was destroyed during the war.

<doc id="1254553" wikidata="Q5426688" url="?curid=1254553" title="FM (Canadian band)">
<text>FM is a Canadian progressive rock music group formed in 1976 in Toronto, by Cameron Hawkins and Jeff Plewman (renamed Nash the Slash). The band existed from 1976 to 1989, 1994–1996, 2006, and 2011–present. They have had periods of inactivity during their existence. Their music has been categorized as space rock, and lyrics are dominated by science fiction themes. In November 2011, Hawkins reformed the band with two new players.

== History ==

===Hawkins / Plewman &quot;Nash the Slash&quot; lineup===
The band&#x27;s original 1976 lineup consisted of two people: Cameron Hawkins on synthesizer, occasional bass guitar, and lead vocals, and Jeff Plewman (aka Nash The Slash) on electric violin, electric mandolin, and backing vocals. The group did not use guitars. The duo first met each other while jamming with a band called Clear.

The group first recorded in July 1976. A few months later, TVOntario recorded an in-studio performance for the &quot;Night Music Concert&quot; TV show, first broadcast on November 3. It is very likely this was also the date of recording. The half-hour show, shown with no commercial breaks, presented the band playing three long pieces: &quot;Phasors on Stun&quot;, &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;Black Noise&quot;. It also included a nonsensical biography of the group resembling free-association poetry, recited by David Pritchard (electronic musician, record producer, and CHUM-FM DJ, 1960s-1970s), accompanied by electronic background music and a collage of photos and artwork by Paul Till, appearing between the first and second songs. Neither this music, nor any performances by the original two-person lineup, were released on an album until 2001.

FM&#x27;s first public performance took place in November 1976 at the A Space art gallery in Toronto shortly after the TV show first aired.

===Hawkins / Plewman &quot;Nash the Slash&quot; / Deller lineup No. 1===
Some time after February 1977 the group became a trio when they added Martin Deller on drums. Deller had worked with Nash earlier in 1976 when they and David Pritchard played a 13-minute improvised piece titled &quot;An Admission of Guilt&quot; for Pritchard&#x27;s album, &quot;Nocturnal Earthworm Stew&quot;.

After appearing on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation TV variety show &quot;Who&#x27;s New&quot;, FM was approached by the CBC to make an album, ultimately titled &quot;Black Noise&quot;, which the group presumed would be distributed in stores like a normal release. But the CBC chose to sell it by mail order and only announced its availability during several radio shows. Only 500 copies were pressed, which was sufficient to meet the demands of this limited promotion. The CBC edition&#x27;s black and white cover shows a picture of a manhole cover; a different cover by Paul Till was used for later reissues on other labels.

Sometime in 1977, Plewman, after recovering from a severe car/bike accident, decided to leave the band and resumed his solo career as Nash the Slash stating that the addition of a drummer gave the band a sound which was too commercial for his liking.

===Hawkins / Mink / Deller lineup===
Before the end of 1977, Plewman [now &#x27;Nash The Slash&#x27; solo artist] was replaced by Ben Mink, who also played electric violin and electric mandolin. Their first record was &quot;Direct to Disc&quot; (also released as &quot;Head Room&quot;, or &quot;Headroom&quot;), and was made using the direct to disc recording method, in which recording tape is not used. Several editions of the album exist.

Later in 1978, the group got its first proper record contract with Visa Records in the USA, and Passport Records in Canada, the latter distributed by GRT Records. (Passport was a sub-label of Visa, although Passport was the more prolific of the two labels.) Their first release for these labels was a reissue of the CBC album, &quot;Black Noise&quot;, now made available in stores for the first time. The USA edition was released in the summer of 1978, while the Canadian edition came out near the end of the year. A single from the album, &quot;Phasors on Stun&quot; helped to promote the album, for which the group were presented a gold record award. However, Cameron Hawkins claims they never received royalty payments from any of the Canadian LP editions, as their contract specified all payments were to come through Visa Records in the USA, and none of the three Canadian distributors passed royalties on to Visa.

&quot;Black Noise&quot; was followed by &quot;Surveillance&quot; in the summer of 1979, the first widely released album with the group&#x27;s then-current lineup, although it was delayed because GRT Records went out of business one week before the intended release date. Canadian distribution of the Passport label was bought out by Capitol Records who subsequently released both albums. In 1981 the Passport label declared bankruptcy, but was rescued again the following year by new Canadian distributor A&amp;M Records, who reissued &quot;Black Noise&quot; again.

In 1980, FM released another album, &quot;City of Fear&quot;, produced by Larry Fast who under the name &quot;Synergy&quot; released a series of electronic music albums as well as playing keyboards on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s early albums. Ben Mink also recorded an instrumental solo album, &quot;Foreign Exchange&quot; with the other members of FM as his backing band. Ben Mink left FM in 1983.

===Hawkins / Nash the Slash / Deller lineup No. 2===
In 1983, Nash the Slash proposed a future double bill tour with FM, as the two artists seemed to share a common audience, since FM&#x27;s best known previous album was the one he made with them in 1977. But they had still not found a replacement for Ben Mink. Nash resolved the problem by rejoining the band. Just as work was beginning on a new album in 1984, Passport Records folded for the third and final time. Nash had been signed to Quality Records as a solo artist in 1983, and was about to release his solo album &quot;American Band-ages&quot;, which the originally proposed tour had been intended to promote, and was able to get FM signed to the label as well. The other two members of FM also play on Nash&#x27;s album. The double bill concept was retained, with Nash playing a solo set as the opening act for FM concerts. The FM album, released in 1985, was titled &quot;Con-Test&quot;. Ben Mink also appears on the album.

A live show at the Masonic Temple in Toronto was videotaped and aired by the CBC as one of its &quot;Rock Deluxe&quot; TV specials in 1985.

FM seemed to be cursed by record labels going out of business. The Quality Records company had existed since the early 1950s, and by the 1960s was Canada&#x27;s biggest domestic label; but they ceased operations shortly after the album was released. MCA Records picked up the reissue rights for &quot;Con-Test&quot;, as well as Nash&#x27;s &quot;American Band-ages&quot;, but the abrupt change in record labels led to a near-absence of promotion for both records. Martin Deller left the band at the conclusion of its 1986 tour.

===Hawkins / Nash the Slash / Brierly / Critchley lineup===
In 1986, FM replaced Deller with Greg Critchley (ex The Partland Brothers and The Spoons) on drums, and added Simon Brierley (ex Lee Aaron&#x27;s band and Strange Advance) on guitars. Before this time, FM (and Nash as a solo artist) were notable for not using electric guitars, therefore this change made a significant alteration to their sound. They recorded &quot;Tonight&quot; for Duke Street Records, with the first pressing issued on green vinyl. Duke Street also issued the album on CD, with five bonus tracks from &quot;Con-Test&quot;, followed by a CD edition of the earlier album. Five songs were also used in the horror film &quot;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&quot; (1988).

===Hawkins / Nash the Slash / Brierly / Cooke lineup===
In 1988, Randy Cooke replaced Greg Critchley on drums. This lineup disbanded after touring the &quot;Tonight&quot; album.

===Hawkins / Shaw / Brierly / Marangoni lineup===
In 1989, FM consisted of Hawkins and Brierly, augmented by the new members Martin Shaw (also known as Marty Warsh) on mandolin and violin and drummer Paul Marangoni. Information on this lineup is scarce, and though Marangoni has stated that this line-up planned to record, they disbanded in the early 1990s. Marangoni has since shared footage of this lineup on YouTube.

===Hawkins / Nash the Slash / Deller lineup No. 3===
In 1994, Cameron Hawkins created a new record company called Now See Hear Records (initially self-distributed, but later distributed by MCA Records as of 1996), and purchased the rights to &quot;Black Noise&quot; which was still owned by the CBC, but ownership was set to expire that year. Hawkins was surprised to find a competitor bidding for the rights, but his label emerged as the winning bidder. By this time, the CBC no longer possessed a master tape of the album. A search for the tape at the CBC turned up a reel tape box with an inferior cassette copy inside. Hawkins then travelled to the USA to search the former Passport Records vaults for the tapes of this, and the other Passport albums, without success. Ultimately, the Now See Hear reissue of &quot;Black Noise&quot; was made from a transfer from vinyl. Now See Hear also licensed the recording to One Way Records, a company specializing in reissues, which released an American edition.

The reissue was followed by a reformation of the group&#x27;s classic lineup for a series of concerts from 1994 to 1996, resulting in a new live CD titled &quot;RetroActive&quot; recorded November 1994 in Toronto, and issued on Now See Hear in 1995. The album included some previously unrecorded songs.

In 2001, Nash the Slash compiled unreleased and live FM recordings from the 1970s and 1980s on a CD titled &quot;Lost in Space&quot; on his own Cut-throat Records label. This release was not approved by the other members, and did not mention the name FM; the artist was listed as &quot;Nash the Slash, Cameron Hawkins &amp; Martin Deller&quot;. It includes recordings made by the original Hawkins / Nash the Slash lineup in 1976 and 1977, and demo versions of songs for &quot;Con-Test&quot; recorded in 1984.

===Hawkins / Vena / Deller lineup===
In 2006, FM reformed again for a live performance at NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA on June 24, and also gave a concert prior to this in Toronto on June 16. The new lineup included Italian musician Claudio Vena on electric violin and electric mandolin. New CD and DVD recordings by this lineup have been issued, and the band&#x27;s website has not been updated since 2006.

In 2010, Martin Deller uploaded a video on YouTube, advertising for drumming and recording lessons. The video consists of clips from the NEARfest 2006 performance which is also mentioned as being an upcoming release.

===2011 to 2014===
Since 2011, Cameron Hawkins has worked on material with a new incarnation of FM. Joining Hawkins are Paul DeLong on drums, Aaron Solomon on violin, and Ed Bernard of Druckfarben on viola and mandolin. The band is putting the finishing touches on songs for a new album that is to be released by Esoteric Recordings.

On May 12, 2014, Nash the Slash died at age 66.

===2015===
FM&#x27;s first studio album in 28 years, &quot;Transformation&quot;, was released in April, 2015 via Esoteric/Cherry Red Recordings. The lineup was Hawkins (bass, keyboards), Paul DeLong (drums), Edward Bernard (viola, mandolin), and Aaron Solomon (violin).

<text>The dusky grouse (Dendragapus obscurus) is a species of forest-dwelling grouse native to the Rocky Mountains in North America. It is closely related to the sooty grouse (&quot;Dendragapus fuliginosus&quot;), and the two were previously considered a single species, the blue grouse.

==Description==
Adults have a long square tail, gray at the end. Adult males are mainly dark with a purplish throat air sac surrounded by white, and a yellow to red wattle over the eye during display. Adult females are mottled brown with dark brown and white marks on the underparts.

Males are larger than females, with a male mean body mass of 1.21 kg (2.67 lbs.) compared to a mean 0.91 kg (2.01 lbs.) in females.
==Distribution and habitat==
The breeding habitat of the dusky grouse is the edges of conifer and mixed forests in mountainous regions of western North America, from southeastern Alaska and Yukon south to New Mexico. Their range is closely associated with that of various conifers. Their nest is a scrape on the ground concealed under a shrub or log.

== Taxonomy ==
The dusky grouse has four recognized subspecies:

* &quot;D. o. obscurus&quot; 
* &quot;D. o. oreinus&quot; 
* &quot;D. o. pallidus&quot; 
* &quot;D. o. richardsonii&quot; 

==Migration==
They are permanent residents but move short distances by foot and short flights to denser forest areas in winter, with the odd habit of moving to higher altitudes in winter.
==Diet==
Dusky grouse forage mainly for plant matter on the ground, as well as in trees and along branches (in the winter). During the coldest months, they mainly eat fir and douglas-fir needles, occasionally consuming hemlock and pine needles, as well. Then, in the spring and summer, the fresh green growth of various herbaceous perennials (&quot;Pteridium, Salix&quot;) and berry plants (&quot;Gaultheria, Mahonia, Rubus, Vaccinium&quot;), as well as invertebrates (particularly larger ants, beetles, crickets and grasshoppers), become more available and thus more readily consumed. Chicks are almost entirely dependent on insect prey for several weeks after hatching.

==Breeding==
Males sing with deep hoots on their territory and make short flapping flights to attract females. Females leave the male&#x27;s territory after mating.

<text>Alopen (, ; also &quot;Aleben&quot;, &quot;Aluoben&quot;, &quot;Olopen,&quot; &quot;Olopan,&quot; or &quot;Olopuen&quot;) is the first recorded Assyrian Christian missionary to have reached China, during the Tang dynasty. He was a missionary from the Church of the East (also known as the &quot;Nestorian Church&quot;), and probably a Syriac speaker from the Sasanian Empire or from Byzantine Syria. He is known exclusively from the Xi&#x27;an Stele, which describes his arrival in the Tang capital of Chang&#x27;an in 635 and his acceptance by Emperor Taizong of Tang. His is the earliest known name that can be attached to the history of the Church of the East in China.

==History==

Alopen&#x27;s name is known only from the Chinese of the Xi&#x27;an Stele. This may be a transliteration of the Semitic &quot;Abraham&quot; or &quot;aloho punoya,&quot; &quot;the conversion of God.&quot; Amy Chua posits that his name could be a transcription of &quot;Ruben&quot;.

According to the Stele, Alopen and his fellow missionaries came to China from Daqin (or Ta Tsin – the Byzantine Empire) in the ninth year of Emperor Taizong (Tai Tsung; 635), bringing sacred books and images. He would have come to China via the Silk Road. The Church of the East mission benefited from Taizong&#x27;s policy of religious tolerance, which reversed measures his father Gaozu had taken against Buddhism and other foreign religions and influences. Many of the religions that were tolerated entered through the Silk Road: Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. Taizong appreciated Jesus as another sage, and Christian doctrines as being profound and promoting peace, and therefore welcome to be preached throughout the Empire.

According to the Stele, Taizong welcomed Alopen and arranged for the translation of the holy writings he had brought with him at the Imperial Library. Upon studying them, Taizong, a great scholar and patron, found them most acceptable and arranged for their dissemination. Indeed, four documents from the early period of Christianity in China date to around Alopen&#x27;s time. Three years later, in 638, Taizong issued an official declaration protecting the Church of the East. He erected China&#x27;s first Christian church and recognized twenty-one priests, likely all Persians, to administer it. Under Taizong&#x27;s son and successor Gaozong, who continued this policy of toleration, Alopen&#x27;s status expanded even further, and he was appointed bishop over the many churches built by the emperor.

After Alopen&#x27;s time, the Church of the East was prominent in China for the remainder of the Tang Dynasty&#x27;s power. Different emperors treated it differently, with some showing it the tolerance it received in the early decades, and some openly persecuting it. The Church of the East disappeared with the fall of the Tang Dynasty in the early 10th century. It did not return for three centuries, when it was reintroduced by the Mongols. The story of Alopen became prominent again in the 17th century, when the Xi&#x27;an Stele was rediscovered and the Chinese were surprised to find that the &quot;new&quot; religion being preached by the missionaries, had actually been in existence in China more than 1,000 years earlier.

<text>In numerical analysis, numerical differentiation algorithms estimate the derivative of a mathematical function or subroutine using values of the function and perhaps other knowledge about the function.

==Finite differences==
The simplest method is to use finite difference approximations.

A simple two-point estimation is to compute the slope of a nearby secant line through the points and . Choosing a small number , represents a small change in , and it can be either positive or negative. The slope of this line is
formula_1
This expression is Newton&#x27;s difference quotient (also known as a first-order divided difference).

The slope of this secant line differs from the slope of the tangent line by an amount that is approximately proportional to . As approaches zero, the slope of the secant line approaches the slope of the tangent line. Therefore, the true derivative of at is the limit of the value of the difference quotient as the secant lines get closer and closer to being a tangent line:
formula_2

Since immediately substituting 0 for results in formula_3 indeterminate form, calculating the derivative directly can be unintuitive.

Equivalently, the slope could be estimated by employing positions and .

Another two-point formula is to compute the slope of a nearby secant line through the points and . The slope of this line is
formula_4

This formula is known as the symmetric difference quotient. In this case the first-order errors cancel, so the slope of these secant lines differ from the slope of the tangent line by an amount that is approximately proportional to formula_5. Hence for small values of this is a more accurate approximation to the tangent line than the one-sided estimation. However, although the slope is being computed at , the value of the function at is not involved.

The estimation error is given by
formula_6
where formula_7 is some point between formula_8 and formula_9.
This error does not include the rounding error due to numbers being represented and calculations being performed in limited precision.

The symmetric difference quotient is employed as the method of approximating the derivative in a number of calculators, including TI-82, TI-83, TI-84, TI-85, all of which use this method with .

==Step size==

An important consideration in practice when the function is calculated using floating-point arithmetic of finite precision is the choice of step size, . If chosen too small, the subtraction will yield a large rounding error. In fact, all the finite-difference formulae are ill-conditioned and due to cancellation will produce a value of zero if is small enough. If too large, the calculation of the slope of the secant line will be more accurately calculated, but the estimate of the slope of the tangent by using the secant could be worse.

For basic central differences, the optimal step is the cube-root of machine epsilon.
For the numerical derivative formula evaluated at and , a choice for that is small without producing a large rounding error is formula_10 (though not when &quot;x&quot; = 0), where the machine epsilon is typically of the order of for double precision. A formula for that balances the rounding error against the secant error for optimum accuracy is
formula_11
(though not when formula_12), and to employ it will require knowledge of the function.

For computer calculations the problems are exacerbated because, although necessarily holds a representable floating-point number in some precision (32 or 64-bit, &quot;etc&quot;.), almost certainly will not be exactly representable in that precision. This means that will be changed (by rounding or truncation) to a nearby machine-representable number, with the consequence that will &quot;not&quot; equal ; the two function evaluations will not be exactly apart. In this regard, since most decimal fractions are recurring sequences in binary (just as 1/3 is in decimal) a seemingly round step such as will not be a round number in binary; it is 0.000110011001100...2 A possible approach is as follows:
 h := sqrt(eps) * x;
 xph := x + h;
 dx := xph - x;
 slope := (F(xph) - F(x)) / dx;
However, with computers, compiler optimization facilities may fail to attend to the details of actual computer arithmetic and instead apply the axioms of mathematics to deduce that and are the same. With C and similar languages, a directive that is a volatile variable will prevent this.

==Other methods==
===Higher-order methods===

To obtain more general derivative approximation formulas for some function formula_13, let formula_14 be a positive number close to zero. The Taylor expansion of formula_13 about the base point formula_16 is
{2!}f&quot;(x) + \frac{h^{3}}{3!}f&quot;&#x27;(x) + ...&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Replacing formula_17 by formula_18 gives
{2!}f&quot;(x) + \frac{8h^{3}}{3!}f&quot;&#x27;(x) + ...&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Multiplying identity () by 4 gives
{2!}f&quot;(x) + \frac{4h^{3}}{3!}f&quot;&#x27;(x) + ...&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Subtracting identity () from () eliminates the formula_19 term:

formula_20

which can be written as

formula_21

Rearranging terms gives
formula_22

which is called the three-point forward difference formula for the derivative. Using a similar approach, one can show

formula_23
which is called the three-point central difference formula, and
formula_24
which is called the three-point backward difference formula.

By a similar approach, the five point midpoint approximation formula can be derived as:
formula_25

=== Higher derivatives ===
Using Newton&#x27;s difference quotient,
formula_26
the following can be shown (for ):
formula_27
==Complex-variable methods==

The classical finite-difference approximations for numerical differentiation are ill-conditioned. However, if formula_28 is a holomorphic function, real-valued on the real line, which can be evaluated at points in the complex plane near formula_16, then there are stable methods. For example, the first derivative can be calculated by the complex-step derivative formula:
formula_30

The recommended step size to obtain accurate derivatives for a range of conditions is formula_31.
This formula can be obtained by Taylor series expansion:
formula_32

The complex-step derivative formula is only valid for calculating first-order derivatives. A generalization of the above for calculating derivatives of any order employs multicomplex numbers, resulting in multicomplex derivatives.
formula_33
where the formula_34 denote the multicomplex imaginary units; formula_35. The formula_36 operator extracts the formula_37th component of a multicomplex number of level formula_38, e.g., formula_39 extracts the real component and formula_40 extracts the last, “most imaginary” component. The method can be applied to mixed derivatives, e.g. for a second-order derivative
formula_41

A C++ implementation of multicomplex arithmetics is available.

In general, derivatives of any order can be calculated using Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula:
formula_42
where the integration is done numerically.

Using complex variables for numerical differentiation was started by Lyness and Moler in 1967. Their algorithm is applicable to higher-order derivatives.

A method based on numerical inversion of a complex Laplace transform was developed by Abate and Dubner. An algorithm that can be used without requiring knowledge about the method or the character of the function was developed by Fornberg.

==Differential quadrature==
Differential quadrature is the approximation of derivatives by using weighted sums of function values. Differential quadrature is of practical interest because its allows one to compute derivatives from noisy data. The name is in analogy with &quot;quadrature&quot;, meaning numerical integration, where weighted sums are used in methods such as Simpson&#x27;s rule or the trapezoidal rule. There are various methods for determining the weight coefficients, for example, the Savitzky–Golay filter. Differential quadrature is used to solve partial differential equations.
There are further methods for computing derivatives from noisy data.

<doc id="1254569" wikidata="Q16992261" url="?curid=1254569" title="The Ed Schultz Show">
<text>The Ed Schultz Show was a progressive talk radio program hosted by Ed Schultz. It was formerly broadcast from KFGO in Fargo, North Dakota. It was heard on a network of over 100 stations, including seven of the ten largest radio markets. It was also on XM and Sirius satellite radio.

Schultz&#x27;s radio show moved to New York City in May 2009, a relocation brought on by the launch of his new television show, &quot;The Ed Show&quot;, on MSNBC.

== History ==
Schultz launched &quot;The Ed Schultz Show&quot; on January 5, 2004. Created and financed by Democracy Radio and distributed by Jones Radio Networks, the show started in two markets (Needles, California and Langdon, North Dakota) and quickly grew, signing another dozen stations in smaller, mostly upper Midwest markets. For a while, Schultz continued his &quot;News and Views&quot; broadcasts, though by February 2005 it was announced that Joel Heitkamp, a North Dakota state senator, was taking over that show. On February 1, 2007, Ed Schultz returned to hosting the &quot;News and Views&quot; show.

After growing to approximately 95 affiliates, Democracy Radio sold its majority stake in &quot;The Ed Schultz Show&quot; to Product First in June 2005, a company started by Randy Michaels and Stu Krane, who had previously been involved with launching Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s radio show. Distribution continued with Jones Radio Networks and subsequently by its successor, Dial Global.

Schultz&#x27;s flagship KFGO dropped &quot;The Ed Schultz Show&quot; between January 2006 and February 2007 due to an apparent conflict with the station&#x27;s management which new ownership cleared up. Fargo&#x27;s KQWB aired the program in the interim.

In 2009, &quot;Talkers&quot; magazine rated Ed Schultz as the 18th most important talk show host in the United States.

During his show on May 24, 2011, Schultz called Laura Ingraham both a &quot;right-wing slut&quot; and a &quot;talk slut&quot;. Feminist organizations, including the Women&#x27;s Media Center, called for his suspension. The following day he issued an apology, saying he &quot;used vile and inappropriate language when talking about talk show host Laura Ingraham. I am deeply sorry, and I apologize. It was wrong, uncalled for and I recognize the severity of what I said. I apologize to you, Laura, and ask for your forgiveness,&quot; and offering an indefinite self-suspension without pay. MSNBC issued a statement saying that it had accepted Schultz&#x27;s offer to take one week of unpaid leave.

In May 2014, Schultz announced he was replacing his three-hour weekday radio program with a one-hour program, and shifting to a Web format. Schultz continued to host his &quot;Ed Show&quot; television program, which was then aired on weekdays at 5 p.m. ET.

==Show features==
Ed Schultz may be best known for his pro-labor reputation, because he was one of the few remaining pundits who still frequently featured labor issues and promoted the labor movement, associating the health of &quot;labor&quot; with the health of the middle class.

Ed Schultz often brought Los Angeles lawyer Norman Goldman to his show for legal analysis, thus given the title of &quot;Senior Legal Analyst&quot; by Schultz. Goldman filled in on the radio show when Schultz was traveling or on vacation. Reliably holding Schultz&#x27;s high ratings, Goldman now produces his own nationally heard talk show during the 3-6 PM West Coast time slot. Tony Trupiano also filled in on Schultz&#x27;s show when Schultz was absent.

The third hour of every Friday show was dedicated to &quot;recession busting&quot; where small business owners called in to promote their business for the hour.

Like other popular polemic, political radio shows, Schultz used humorous, often somewhat derogatory nicknames for a number of public figures. These included &quot;Slant Head&quot; for conservative commentator Sean Hannity, &quot;the Druggie&quot; or &quot;the Drugster&quot; for Rush Limbaugh, &quot;Shooter&quot; for Vice President Dick Cheney, &quot;Rotten Rudy&quot; for former Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, &quot;The Mittster&quot; for Mitt Romney, and &quot;the pizza man&quot; for Herman Cain. Schultz himself was perhaps best known by the nicknames &quot;Big Eddie&quot;, and the &quot;Big RedHead&quot;

<doc id="1254571" wikidata="Q964287" url="?curid=1254571" title="Cantilever chair">
<text>A cantilever chair is a chair whose seating and framework are not supported by the typical arrangement of 4 legs, but instead is held erect and aloft by a single leg or legs that are attached to one end of a chair&#x27;s seat and bent in an L shape, thus also serving as the chair&#x27;s supporting base. Nearly a century after its inception, tubular steel remains the prime choice for the cantilever chair with Marcel Breuer being perhaps the greatest champion of this design technique; using the overhanging cantilever styling in both his furniture and architecture. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Alvar Aalto are other historical figures who contributed to the popularity of the cantilever chair.

With the creation of his Wassily Chair in 1925, Marcel Breuer holds the distinction of first using bent and polished tubular steel as both a supporting framework and a decorative element for furniture.

In the ‘30s, Thonet-Nederland summoned W. H. Gispen to court on account of breach of authorship of Mart Stam on the cantilever chair. According to the judge, because no patent was applied for, the ‘Stam’-chair enjoyed no legal protection. Gispen now tried to fight the patent granted to Mies van der Rohe on his cantilever chair. The trial dragged itself on, which only stopped when Mies’s patent ran out. Later it was Mart Stam who was awarded the European patent for the cantilever chair. 

It has been suggested that Mart Stam might have been inspired by a cantilever tubular steel seat seen installed in a 1926 Tatra T12 two-door saloon car.

<text>Fathi Arafat (; January 11, 1933 – December 1, 2004) was a Palestinian physician and a founder and long-term chairman of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Born in Cairo, he studied medicine at Cairo University from 1950 until 1957 and thereafter practiced as a pediatrician in Egypt, Kuwait and Jordan. He was a younger brother of Palestinian president Yasser Arafat.

Arafat became a member of the Palestinian National Council in 1967. From 1968 he was also President of Palestine General Union of Physicians and Pharmacists. He served as Chief Delegate for Palestine to the World Health Organization from 1982 onwards. From 1992 he was President of the Palestine Academy for Science and Technology (formerly Palestine Academy for Scientific Research) and President of the Palestine Higher Health Council.

<doc id="1254594" wikidata="Q810850" url="?curid=1254594" title="List of Batman comics">
<text>Batman has been featured in many ongoing series, annuals, miniseries, maxiseries, one-shots, graphic novels, trade paperbacks and intercompany crossovers published by DC Comics. These titles have been handled or coordinated through a single editorial section at DC Comics. This list also generally includes titles that have spun off of the core Batman titles to feature related characters and presents these and all other titles separated by general publication type.

==Ongoing series==
==&quot;Annual&quot;s==
==Miniseries==
==One-shots and graphic novels==
==Intercompany crossover stories==
==Collected editions==
Numerous Batman stories have been reprinted as collected editions. This section lists only reprints from ongoing series, miniseries, etc. All of these stories have been issued in trade paperback format unless noted otherwise.

===&quot;DC Archive Editions&quot;===
All &quot;DC Archive Editions&quot; were hardcover only and printed on high quality archival paper.

===&quot;The Batman Chronicles&quot;===
&quot;The Batman Chronicles&quot; book series planned to reprint every Batman adventure in color, in chronological order, and in affordable trade paperbacks, but was cancelled before it could do so. It is not to be confused with the also now-cancelled comic book series of the same name.

===&quot;Showcase Presents&quot;===
All &quot;Showcase Presents&quot; collections were large (over 500 pages) softcover-only and black-and-white-only reprints.

===&quot;Batman&quot; newspaper comic strip collections===
The following collections reprinted the two Batman newspaper comic strips of 1943–1946 and 1966–1973.

===Modern Batman===
The following trade paperbacks are stories that run through the &quot;contemporary&quot; books of the Batman family. The earliest trade paperback, chronologically speaking, is Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot; story arc, which rebirthed the character in the Modern Age, retelling the first year of his existence, including who he was and how he came to be. These stories are from comic books that are still being published and are, in a sense, still ongoing. They are listed here in the chronology of the story lines, rather than the publication dates of either the original comics or collections.

The two trade paperback series &quot;Batman: The Caped Crusader&quot; and &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Detective&quot; reprint most of the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; issues of &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, respectively. However, both &quot;Caped Crusader&quot; and &quot;Dark Knight Detective&quot; feature six major omissions: &quot;Dark Knight Detective&quot; omits &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #575–578 (&quot;Batman: Year Two&quot;) and &quot;Caped Crusader&quot; omits the entire Max Alan Collins &quot;Batman&quot; run and the fill-in &quot;Batman&quot; issues that were published in between the Collins and Jim Starlin runs (the majority of which were previously reprinted in &quot;Batman: Second Chances&quot;, along with the Collins Penguin story in &quot;Batman Annual&quot; #11). &quot;Caped Crusader&quot; also omits several major Batman stories in its run, most notably Alan Moore&#x27;s Clayface III story from &quot;Batman Annual&quot; #11, &quot;Batman&quot; #426–429 (&quot;A Death in the Family&quot;), and &quot;Batman&quot; #440–442/&quot;The New Titans&quot; #60–61 (&quot;A Lonely Place of Dying&quot;). Five of these six omissions are also referred to in the two series&#x27; respective sections below.

===&quot;The New 52&quot; Batman===
In 2011, DC Comics rebooted their entire continuity. This relaunched continuity, which ran from 2011 to 2016, is known as &quot;The New 52&quot;. The Batman family of books were also rebooted. While the history and elements of this new continuity are very similar to the previous one, there are still fundamental differences between them. As such, the following collected works should be treated as a separate canonical entity. The collected works are listed in order of publication date, not in chronological order. This list includes all &quot;New 52&quot; titles centered around Batman.

====&quot;The New 52&quot; Batman new editions====

This list is for updated versions of the various &quot;New 52&quot; titles. The titles presented here may be updated to a more concise trade or expand on previous trades.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot; Batman===
In 2016, DC Comics once again relaunched its continuity and entire line of ongoing monthly superhero comic books. Using the end of &quot;The New 52&quot; initiative in May 2016 as its launching point, &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; intended to restore the DC Universe to a form much like that prior to the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; story arc, while still incorporating numerous elements of &quot;The New 52&quot;, including its continuity. The collected works are listed in order of publication date, not in chronological order. This list includes all &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; titles centered around Batman. The DC Comics crossover story lines &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; and &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot; are both included here strictly due to their Batman-centric focus.

====&quot;DC Rebirth&quot; Batman new editions====

This list is for updated versions of the various &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; titles. The titles presented here may be updated to a more concise trade or expand on previous trades.

===&quot;Infinite Frontier Batman&quot;===

The following are collected works of the comic book series &quot;Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight&quot;, which primarily concentrates on early tales in Batman&#x27;s career that are not necessarily considered canon, but have also been used during major crossover story lines (such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;). The series has not yet been completely collected in book form as of this date.

===&quot;Batman Confidential&quot;===
This series has been collected in the following trade paperbacks.

===&quot;Superman/Batman&quot;===
This series has been collected in the following trade paperbacks.

This series has been collected in the following trade paperbacks.
===&quot;&quot;===
This series has been collected in the following trade paperbacks.
===&quot;&quot; and &quot;Gotham City Impostors&quot; tie-in story collections===

===&quot;Batman &#x27;66&quot; collections===
===Intercompany crossover story collections===
This list includes crossover comic book stories between Batman and other characters from different companies.

===Miscellaneous collections===
These volumes are collections of stories from various Batman continuities, with loose connections of superhero, supervillain, location or subject.

===Writer/artist collections===
===&quot;DC Omnibus&quot;es / &quot;Absolute&quot; editions / &quot;Batman Noir&quot; editions / &quot;Batman Unwrapped&quot; editions / &quot;DC Deluxe Edition&quot;s===
===Anthology editions===
The decade editions (see below) reprint the &quot;best&quot; stories of each decade of the 20th century almost from the beginning of the characters&#x27; history onward (except for the 1930s and the 1990s, which were not included for unknown reasons) in trade paperbacks.

<text>Awareness ribbons are symbols meant to show support or raise consciousness for a cause. Different colors and patterns are associated with different issues.

Yellow ribbons, in the United States, are used to show that a close family member is abroad in military service. In Russia, Belarus and other countries of the former Soviet Union, gold and black striped ribbons are used to celebrate the Allies&#x27; victory in World War II (9 May). In Spain a yellow ribbon became a symbol of solidarity with the 2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis in provisional detention. In Israel, a yellow ribbon became a symbol of solidarity with the Israeli hostage victims during the Gaza war. Some protesters wore the yellow ribbon at the Bring Them Home Now protests

Of the uses of ribbons to draw awareness to health issues, perhaps the best-known is the pink ribbon for support of those with breast cancer. Other health and social concerns which have adopted colored ribbons include Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and pancreatic cancer (purple), HIV/AIDS (red), mental health and mental illness (green), suicide prevention and for Hostages kidnapped by Hamas (yellow), and brain disorder or disability (silver).

Political use of ribbons include orange ribbons to commemorate the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, blue-yellow ribbons for victims of the Russo-Ukrainian war or general support for Ukraine, or yellow ribbons for the Israeli hostages in Gaza since 2023. 

Other ornaments, including flowers (of specific kinds), bracelets, and badges may serve essentially the same purpose of drawing attention to a cause. These include poppies, rosettes and wristbands.

== History ==
The first ribbons that were represented as meaningful objects in history were the tokens given to knights during the Middle Ages in Europe. The yellow ribbon came from the Puritans during the English Civil War. From there, it spread to the Americas, where the Army of the United States became associated with it. A yellow ribbon was mentioned in a marching song of the military in the United States. In 1917, George A. Norton copyrighted the song &quot;Round Her Neck She Wears a Yeller Ribbon&quot;. In the 1940s the song was rewritten by several musicians.

In the early 1970s, the song &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot; was released. Based on this song, Penney Laingen, wife of Iran hostage Bruce Laingen, was the first who used the ribbon as an awareness symbol. She tied yellow ribbons around trees to express the desire for her husband’s return. Her friends and family members followed the trend. As many individuals were able to see this message, the &quot;ribbon became a medium.&quot;

During the 1979–1981 spate of child murders in Atlanta, green lapel ribbons began to be worn to show solidarity. They were of a different form than later awareness ribbons, being typically bow-shaped.

In May 1986, the AIDS Faith Alliance, later known as Christian Action on AIDS, held an open conference on AIDS at Notting Hill Gate in London, supported by the Archbishop of Canterbury and other United Kingdom Christian church leaders. Rainbow Ribbons were given to everybody attending. The purpose of Christian Action on AIDS, an official Church of England charity whose founder/chairman was Barnaby Miln, was to get the worldwide Christian churches involved in the crisis that was AIDS. Christian Action on AIDS folded in 1991.

In 1991, the red ribbon was created by the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus, a New York–based group of artists and AIDS activists. They wished to create a visual symbol to demonstrate compassion for people living with AIDS and their caregivers. The color red was chosen for its &quot;connection to blood and the idea of passion&quot;—both anger and love. During the 1991 Tony Awards, actor Jeremy Irons wore the bright red ribbon pinned on his chest. Though the symbolism of the ribbon was not allowed to be discussed on air, the media and public noticed the eye-catching ribbon, and its popularity grew overnight. The red ribbon was purposefully not copyrighted in the United States, to allow it to be worn and used widely as a symbol in the fight against AIDS. The year 1992 was declared by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;The Year of the Ribbon.&quot;

Today the red ribbon is an internationally recognized symbol of AIDS awareness and a design icon. It has led the way for many other color ribbons and awareness projects.

The Unicode character standard has a &quot;reminder ribbon&quot; character (🎗️) at code point U+1F397. No color is specified for it, and platforms vary in its presentation; it can appear yellow, blue, or red depending on the device or software in which it is viewed.

On social media, some users will add visual effects to their user icons as an &quot;awareness_avatar&quot;, in a similar way to wearing a physical ribbon.

== Purpose and usage ==
Ribbons can be used simply to raise awareness of a disease or signify that an individual has been personally affected by that disease or condition. People often place ribbons around college campuses, throughout neighborhoods, and in public business places so that others can see them and realize they are not alone in their battle. Ribbon colors are often associated with one or more conditions but there are several sources that define what color relates to which condition. They also provide an outline of the dates in which that ribbon is significant. Ribbons are often promoted to signify the prevalence of a specific disease or condition.

There are ribbon colors that also associate with animals and organizations that work with animals. The Animal Legal Defense Fund fights for the rights of all animals alike while displaying an orange ribbon. Animal abuse awareness is also well known for its use of the purple ribbon.

<doc id="1254610" wikidata="Q4859671" url="?curid=1254610" title="Barbie Liberation Organization">
<text>The Barbie Liberation Organization, or BLO, are a group of artists and activists involved in culture jamming. Self described as &quot;an underground network of creative activists,&quot; the group gained notoriety in 1993 after switching voice boxes in talking G.I. Joes and Barbie dolls. They resurfaced in August 2023, claiming to be the toy giant Mattel in order to announce a new collection of MyCeliaBarbie EcoWarrior Edition compostable dolls, and a corporate wide move to plastic free toy production.

In their first campaign the BLO performed &quot;surgery&quot; on a reported 300–500 dolls from retail and returned them to shelves, an action they refer to as &quot;shopgiving&quot;. Thus, Teen Talk Barbie dolls would say phrases such as &quot;Vengeance is mine&quot;, while G.I. Joe dolls would say phrases such as &quot;The beach is the place for summer!&quot; Two leading members of the BLO, Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos, would go on to found the culture jamming and political action group The Yes Men.

In the 2023 action, actress Daryl Hannah, posing as a spokesperson for Mattel introduced the collection of biodegradable dolls and announced in a short video that the company would stop using plastic by 2030. This was one of several videos produced by Yellow Dot Studios as part of the BLO&#x27;s campaign to leverage the publicity surrounding the launch of the &quot;Barbie&quot; film to raise concerns about the pervasive use of plastics. Tying in with the satirical campaign is a hoax website bearing heavy resemblance to the real Mattel corporate site, where they issued a fake press release for the fictitious biodegradable Barbie line.

== Motivation and context ==

The BLO was originally conceived in an effort to question and ultimately change the gender stereotypes American culture is known for after Mattel released a speaking Barbie that said &quot;Math class is tough.&quot; It took place in the middle of the culture wars of the 1990s when creative dissent was once again gaining popularity and artists and activists were often trying to conceive of new ways to rebel against cultural stereotypes and powerful forms like network TV. By 1993, criticism of Barbie as a negative gender stereotype for women was commonplace both in academia and popular culture. This may have been partially responsible for the generally positive response of the public to the project—the criticism they were making was familiar and not a controversial point to make during the 1990s. Although their criticism was not new, the creative form of hacking used by the BLO was noteworthy.

== Methods ==

There is a detailed description of the complex &quot;surgery&quot; they performed available on their website, encouraging others to take part in the surgeries themselves. The surgery required some technical skills, tools and precision, but the voice boxes in the dolls were similar enough that the surgery could be reproduced fairly easily in other parts of the country. They outlined the surgery in easy to understand images. After the surgery they would secretly return the toys to shelves, what they call &quot;reverse shoplifting&quot;.

They also produced a video to explain their point. They used the familiar form of the nightly news message, collaged with cutting edge video art techniques to get their point across. Viewers would be unable to tell exactly what was news and what was made up, they made some points through exaggerations and some through the use of actual news footage. They recruited two children, one from San Diego, California, and one from Albany, New York, to showcase the modified toys to the news. Additionally, the BLO used their extra stock of modified dolls to go to stores that were near news stations that were covering the story, planted a modified doll on the shelf, and waited for the journalists to purchase the BLO&#x27;s toy; this would show the reach and a seemingly large scale operation. Having children already prepped to be interviewed and planning ahead to gain media coverage helped the BLO&#x27;s image and reach.

The media responded with coverage, but no legal issues were ever seriously raised. Hasbro and Mattel, the makers of the dolls brushed off the action with little fuss, although one person was outraged with the &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; directed at children.

== Debate ==

Because of the nature of culture jamming, it is hard to tell how many Barbies and G.I. Joes were actually switched, and how much of the media attention was orchestrated by the group. The artist Igor Vamos, known for acts of media intervention, intentionally fed information to the media to report more cases of the switched identity surgeries. Although most sources suggest from 300–500 toys were hacked, other reports up to 3,000 across the country and in other countries like Canada, France and England. Others assert that only 12 toys were actually switched and the rest was cleverly arranged media hype by Vamos and his associates. This perspective indicates that the project was also a critique of the nature of the television and media culture of the 1990s, which led to other media interventions by Vamos, collaborators, and other groups in the coming years.

<doc id="1254615" wikidata="Q669129" url="?curid=1254615" title="Arithmetic underflow">
<text>The term arithmetic underflow (also floating-point underflow, or just underflow) is a condition in a computer program where the result of a calculation is a number of more precise absolute value than the computer can actually represent in memory on its central processing unit (CPU).

Arithmetic underflow can occur when the true result of a floating-point operation is smaller in magnitude (that is, closer to zero) than the smallest value representable as a normal floating-point number in the target datatype. Underflow can in part be regarded as negative overflow of the exponent of the floating-point value. For example, if the exponent part can represent values from −128 to 127, then a result with a value less than −128 may cause underflow.

For integers, the term &quot;integer underflow&quot; typically refers to a special kind of integer overflow or &quot;integer wraparound&quot; condition whereby the result of subtraction would result in a value less than the minimum allowed for a given integer type, i.e. the ideal result was closer to negative infinity than the output type&#x27;s representable value closest to negative infinity.

==Underflow gap==
The interval between −&quot;fminN&quot; and &quot;fminN&quot;, where &quot;fminN&quot; is the smallest positive normal floating-point value, is called the underflow gap. This is because the size of this interval is many orders of magnitude larger than the distance between adjacent normal floating-point values just outside the gap. For instance, if the floating-point datatype can represent 20 bits, the underflow gap is 221 times larger than the absolute distance between adjacent floating-point values just outside the gap.

In older designs, the underflow gap had just one usable value, zero. When an underflow occurred, the true result was replaced by zero (either directly by the hardware, or by system software handling the primary underflow condition). This replacement is called &quot;flush to zero&quot;.

The 1984 edition of IEEE 754 introduced subnormal numbers. The subnormal numbers (including zero) fill the underflow gap with values where the absolute distance between adjacent values is the same as for adjacent values just outside the underflow gap. This enables &quot;gradual underflow&quot;, where a nearest subnormal value is used, just as a nearest normal value is used when possible. Even when using gradual underflow, the nearest value may be zero.

The absolute distance between adjacent floating-point values just outside the gap is called the machine epsilon, typically characterized by the largest value whose sum with the value 1 will result in the answer with value 1 in that floating-point scheme. This is the maximum value of formula_1 that satisfies formula_2, where formula_3 is a function which converts the real value into the floating-point representation. While the machine epsilon is not to be confused with the underflow level (assuming subnormal numbers), it is closely related. The machine epsilon is dependent on the number of bits which make up the significand, whereas the underflow level depends on the number of digits which make up the exponent field. In most floating-point systems, the underflow level is smaller than the machine epsilon.

==Handling of underflow==
The occurrence of an underflow may set a (&quot;sticky&quot;) status bit, raise an exception, at the hardware level generate an interrupt, or may cause some combination of these effects.

As specified in IEEE 754, the underflow condition is only signaled if there is also a loss of precision. Typically this is determined as the final result being inexact.
However, if the user is trapping on underflow, this may happen regardless of consideration for loss of precision. The default handling in IEEE 754 for underflow (as well as other exceptions) is to record as a floating-point status that underflow has occurred. This is specified for the application-programming level, but often also interpreted as how to handle it at the hardware level.

<text>The British Rail Class 419 Motor Luggage Vans (or MLV) were battery electric multiple unit cars built from 1959-61 by BR at Eastleigh Works.

==Description==
Each MLV unit is essentially a motorised BG carriage, with a driver&#x27;s position at each end. Each vehicle has two luggage compartments and a guard&#x27;s compartment.

Ten of these units were built for the boat trains from London Victoria to Dover and Folkestone. Units were originally numbered in the range 68001-68010, but were classified Class 419 under the TOPS system and were then renumbered 419001-419010, the numbers actually carried on the units in service reduced to 9001-9010, omitting the first two digits.

The units were able to work alone, hauling a limited load, or work in multiple with other EP-type rolling stock, usually in conjunction with Class 410 and Class 411. The units were also fitted with batteries to allow them to operate over the short-distance of non-electrified quayside lines at Dover and Folkestone. The batteries allowed the units to be used at low-speed for 20–30 minutes, and could be recharged when the unit was taking power from 750 V DC third-rail.

By 1963, it was discovered that one luggage carriage was insufficient for the boat train service. Some trains were operated with paired MLVs, which resulted in a shortage of the vehicles. To overcome the problem, six Trailer Luggage Vans (TLV) were introduced in 1968 and kept in use alongside the MLVs until 1975. These were numbered 68201-68206 as Class 499 and were conventional BG carriages, except for having their gangway ends sealed from use.

The MLVs were withdrawn from traffic in 1991-92, with the closure of Dover Western Docks railway station and the end of the boat train services.

==Prototype==
The design of the units was based on an earlier vehicle, numbered 68000, which was used as a parcels van on the Tyneside DC electrified network. When the South Tyneside network was de-electrified in 1967, the unit was initially transferred for use on the Southport to Liverpool electric line before being withdrawn.

==Departmental service==
After withdrawal from normal service, the entire fleet was transferred to departmental service as Class 931 tractor units. Unit 9006 was damaged in an accident at Ramsgate in 1994, resulting in it being withdrawn and subsequently scrapped. Units 9003 and 9009 were specially repainted in BR Blue and LSE &quot;Jaffa Cake&quot; liveries, by staff at depot, to commemorate the closure of the depot in 1995.

Most of the units were withdrawn again in 1997. They were kept at Bournemouth depot, while they were waiting for disposal. While there, units 9001 and 9002 stayed in use as depot shunters. Unit 9001 was retired in 1998, and subsequently preserved. Unit 9002 was kept by South West Trains until 2004, when former 4CEP unit 1512 replaced it.

==Preservation==
All but two of the units have been preserved. One unit was scrapped after an accident whilst in service, and the other was scrapped in preservation.

The first unit to be preserved was first-built no. 9001, which was saved in 1998 after a campaign by the EPB Preservation Group. It was bought to power the group&#x27;s preserved 2EPB unit, no. 5759.
The units dumped at Bournemouth were put out to tender in 1999, and were bought mainly for use as storage vehicles. Their ability to move under battery-power has also allowed limited passenger use.
The final unit to be saved was no. 9002, which has now been stored at Southall. After extensive overhaul at Southall 9002 ventured back onto the main line on 28 August 2015 when it was hauled by Battle Of Britain Class 34067 &quot;Tangmere&quot; to Ramsgate Depot for an open day, it returned a day later but has not been out since. The table below gives details of the current () locations and fates of the Class 419 units.

<doc id="1254640" wikidata="Q419287" url="?curid=1254640" title="Ganglioside">
<text>A ganglioside is a molecule composed of a glycosphingolipid (ceramide and oligosaccharide) with one or more sialic acids (e.g. &quot;N&quot;-acetylneuraminic acid, NANA) linked on the sugar chain. NeuNAc, an acetylated derivative of the carbohydrate sialic acid, makes the head groups of gangliosides anionic at pH 7, which distinguishes them from globosides.

The name &quot;ganglioside&quot; was first applied by the German scientist Ernst Klenk in 1942 to lipids newly isolated from ganglion cells of the brain. More than 60 gangliosides are known, which differ from each other mainly in the position and number of NANA residues. It is a component of the cell plasma membrane that modulates cell signal transduction events, and appears to concentrate in lipid rafts.

Recently, gangliosides have been found to be highly important molecules in immunology. Natural and semisynthetic gangliosides are considered possible therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders.

==Location==
Gangliosides are present and concentrated on cell surfaces, with the two hydrocarbon chains of the ceramide moiety embedded in the plasma membrane and the oligosaccharides located on the extracellular surface, where they present points of recognition for extracellular molecules or surfaces of neighboring cells. They are found predominantly in the nervous system where they constitute 6% of all lipids.

==Function==
The oligosaccharide groups on gangliosides extend well beyond the surfaces of the cell membranes, and act as distinguishing surface markers that can serve as specific determinants in cellular recognition and cell-to-cell communication. These carbohydrate head groups also act as specific receptors for certain pituitary glycoprotein hormones and certain bacterial protein toxins such as cholera toxin.

The functions of gangliosides as specific determinants suggest its important role in the growth and differentiation of tissues as well as in carcinogenesis. It has been found that tumor formation can induce the synthesis of a new complement of ganglioside, and very low concentrations of a specific ganglioside can induce differentiation of cultured neuronal tumor cells.

==Pathology==
Gangliosides are continuously synthesized and degraded in cells. They are degraded to ceramides by sequential removal of sugar units in the oligosaccharide group, catalyzed by a set of highly specific lysosomal enzymes. Mutations in genes coding for these enzymes leads to the accumulation of partially broken down gangliosides in lysosomes, which results in a group of diseases called gangliosidosis. For example, the fatal Tay–Sachs disease arises as a genetic defect which leads to no functional hexosaminidase A produced, causing GM2 to accumulate in lysosomes. Ultimately the ganglion cells in the nervous system swell enormously, disturbing the normal functions of neurons.

Gangliosides are also involved in several diseases:

*Influenza, in which haemagglutinin of influenza virus exploits certain gangliosides to enter and infect the cells expressing them.
*Guillain–Barré syndrome, which has been linked to the production of anti-ganglioside antibodies.
*Cholera
*Tetanus
*Botulism
*Leprosy
*Obesity, where inadequate ganglioside expression in mediobasal hypothalamic neurons deregulates neuronal leptin and insulin signaling.

<doc id="1254642" wikidata="Q1359972" url="?curid=1254642" title="Itagaki Nobukata">
<text>was a retainer of the Takeda family. He was known as one of the &quot;Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen&quot;. 
His name is also seen with different &quot;kanji&quot; as 信形. 
Nobukata served under both Takeda Nobutora and Takeda Shingen and also was tasked with young Shingen.

== Military life ==
In 1541 Nobutora, along with Amari Torayasu, was driven out from the position of the head of Takeda clan, and he served as the general for Shingen often leading the troops into a battle when Shingen could not.

In 1542, he would personally finish off Takato Yoritsugu at Battle of Ankokuji, shortly after the Siege of Fukuyo.

In 1545, he successfully besieged and captured Takato castle.

In 1546, he defeated Uesugi Norimasa at Usui Toge in Battle of Odaihara. With these victories, he was instrumental in gaining the control of Shinano Province and proved himself a skilled tactician. He was known as one of the &quot;Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen&quot;. 
After these victories, Nobukata increasingly became selfish and started to hold victory ceremonies without firmly winning a battle. These victories rapidly became fewer. As Nobukata was the eldest of the Takeda retainers and having educated Shingen, few could criticize his actions.

In 1547, during Siege of Shika Castle, Nobukata and his troops were almost completely wiped out in a battle and without a timely rescue by Hara Toratane, Nobukata himself would have been in danger as well. Shingen offered the following &quot;waka&quot; to Nobukata to encourage him to correct his act.

In 1548, at the Battle of Uedahara, Nobutaka satisfied with a victory, had his troops stand down to hold a ceremony. Murakami Yoshikiyo&#x27;s troops regrouped and counterattacked, killing Nobutaka and Amari Torayasu.

== Personal life ==
The Meiji era politician Itagaki Taisuke was Nobukata&#x27;s direct descendant, 12 generations removed.

:&quot;Dare mo Miyo Mitsureba Yagate Kaku Tsuki no Izayofu Ana ya Hito no Yo no Naka&quot;
:誰もみよ 満つればやがて 欠く月の 十六夜ふ穴や 人の世の中

:(Translation) &quot;Everyone sees that even a beautiful full moon starts to change its shape, becoming smaller as the time passes. Even in our human lives, things are as it is.&quot;

==In fiction==

In NHK&#x27;s 2007 Taiga drama &quot;Fūrinkazan&quot;, Itagaki is played by Sonny Chiba. Like in the novel it was adapted from, Nobukata was portrayed more heroically, supposedly the one who was trying to rein in the young Takeda Harunobu (Shingen) from his arrogance and chose to sacrifice himself so that Harunobu may survive the Battle of Uedahara.

<text>Johannes &quot;Jan&quot; Kip (1652/53 in Amsterdam – 1722 in Westminster) was a Dutch draftsman, engraver and print dealer. Together with Leonard Knyff, he made a speciality of engraved views of English country houses.

==Life==
Kip was a pupil of Bastiaen Stopendaal (1636–1707), from 1668 to 1670, before setting up on his own; his earliest dated engravings are from 1672. In April 1680, at the age of 27, he married Elisabeth Breda in Amsterdam. After producing works for the court of William of Orange in Amsterdam, Kip followed William and Mary to London and settled in St. John Street in Farringdon, where he conducted a thriving printselling business. He also worked for various London publishers producing engravings after such artists as Francis Barlow (c. 1626–1704) and Caius Gabriel Cibber (1630–1700), largely for book illustrations. He made several engraved plates for Awnsham &amp; John Churchill&#x27;s &quot;A Collection of Voyages &amp; Travels&quot; (first published 1704). He signed the African scenes in volume V of the 1732 edition as &quot;J. Kip&quot;.

His most important works were the large fold-out folio illustrations for &quot;Britannia Illustrata&quot;, 1708; for the 65 folio plates he engraved for the antiquary Sir Robert Atkyns, &quot;The Ancient and Present State of Glostershire,&quot; 1712 (1st edition); and for &quot;Le Nouveau Théâtre de la Grande Bretagne ou description exacte des palais de la Reine, et des Maisons les plus considerables des des Seigneurs &amp; des Gentilshommes de la Grande Bretagne,&quot; 1715, an extended reprint in collaboration with other artists.

==Partnership with Leonard Knyff==
The linked careers of Jan Kip and Leonard Knyff made a specialty of engraved views of English country houses, represented in detail from the bird&#x27;s-eye view, a pictorial convention for topography. Their major work was &quot;Britannia Illustrata: Or Views of Several of the Queens Palaces, as Also of the Principal seats of the Nobility and Gentry of Great Britain, Curiously Engraven on 80 Copper Plates,&quot; London (1707, published in the winter of 1708–9). The volume is among the most important English topographical publications of the 18th century. Architecture is rendered with care, and the settings of parterres and radiating avenues driven through woods or planted across fields, garden paths, gates and toolsheds are illustrated in detail. The images are staffed with figures and horses, coaches pulling into forecourts, water-craft on rivers, in line with the traditions of the Low Countries. Some of the plates are in the Siennese &quot;map perspective&quot;.

<doc id="1254671" wikidata="Q3211730" url="?curid=1254671" title="Dinosaur Planet (novel)">
<text>Dinosaur Planet is a science fiction novel by the American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey. It was a paperback original published in 1978, by Orbit Books (UK) and then by Del Rey Books (US), the fantasy &amp; science fiction imprints of Futura Publications and Ballantine Books respectively.

A sequel followed in 1984, titled &quot;The Survivors (Dinosaur Planet II)&quot;, or &quot;Dinosaur Planet Survivors&quot; in the US. Jointly they are sometimes called the &quot;Dinosaur Planet series&quot; or sub-series. They are set on a fictional planet named &quot;Ireta&quot; that some characters call the &quot;dinosaur planet&quot;. They became the first two books of the &quot;Ireta series&quot; in 1990, when McCaffrey collaborated with Elizabeth Moon and Jody Lynn Nye to write three &quot;Planet Pirates&quot; novels with the same setting.

==Origins==

McCaffrey had emigrated to Ireland in 1970, with the second &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; book near completion and a contract for the third. That work stalled after she finished &quot;Dragonquest&quot; (the second) but the market for children and young adults eventually provided crucial opportunities. Futura Publications (London) signed her to write books about dinosaurs for children, published by its imprint Orbit Books.

==Plot summary==
A survey team visits fictional planet Ireta to survey its mineral wealth. Several anomalies are discovered, including some decidedly large animals that resemble prehistoric beings from Earth&#x27;s history and legend. Before all can be explained, the Heavyworlder &quot;muscle people&quot; mutiny after gaining a taste for flesh and blood.

&quot;The Death of Sleep&quot; is a prequel to this book, and the fourth section delivers the characters to Ireta, intersecting some of the same plot points.

<text>Midday is a newsmagazine television program broadcast on CBC Television, which ran from January 7, 1985 to June 30, 2000, replacing local noon-hour newscasts on CBC stations. The program, which aired from noon to 1 p.m. on weekday afternoons, presented a mix of news, lifestyle and entertainment features.

== Overview ==

Its original hosts were Bill Cameron, Keith Morrison and Valerie Pringle; Pringle hosted consistently while Cameron and Morrison alternated as her co-anchor, as both were also contributors to the CBC&#x27;s nightly news program &quot;The Journal&quot;. Dave Hodge was also auditioned as a potential host of the program.

The program would open with a 10-minute CBC News summary, usually read by Sheldon Turcott in the news studio, and then move to another studio – the same studio, in fact, that was used for &quot;The Journal&quot; – for the main segment of the program. Following the launch of CBC Newsworld in 1989, the news summary became a simulcast of that network&#x27;s hourly news update that was live for each time zone.

The original producer was Michael Harris and the program was directed for its first four seasons by Sidney M. Cohen, who later became executive producer of &quot;Canada AM&quot; for CTV. Initial ratings were not strong, with the program attracting only slightly more viewers across all of Canada than CIII-TV&#x27;s local noon-hour newscast was attracting in the Toronto market alone, although the program was a strong performer in the ratings by 1986.

After several months with the program, Morrison transferred to the CBC&#x27;s bureau in Ottawa, while Cameron was not interested in taking over as a permanent host of the program due to his duties with &quot;The Journal&quot;, and Peter Downie was hired as Pringle&#x27;s new co-host; Pringle took a maternity leave in 1986, with Sue Prestedge filling in as substitute anchor for several weeks.

Downie left in June 1989 to become host of &quot;Man Alive&quot;, and was replaced by Ralph Benmergui, who was selected over Whit Fraser and Stuart McLean.

Benmergui left the program in May 1992 to become host of &quot;Friday Night! with Ralph Benmergui&quot;, and was succeeded by Kevin Newman in the fall. Newman cohosted with Pringle for only a few weeks before she left the program in December of the same year to succeed Pamela Wallin as cohost of CTV&#x27;s &quot;Canada AM&quot;, just a few weeks after Wallin was hired by the CBC to become co-anchor of &quot;Prime Time News&quot;, and was replaced by Tina Srebotnjak, previously the program&#x27;s entertainment reporter and a sometime substitute anchor.

Newman left in November 1994 to join ABC News in the United States, and was replaced by Brent Bambury, formerly the host of CBC Stereo&#x27;s &quot;Brave New Waves&quot;, in March 1995. Bambury and Srebotnjak remained the hosts of the program until its cancellation in 2000.

Other notable personalities associated with the program included Pete Luckett, a grocer from Nova Scotia who presented food segments, and Antonia Zerbisias, who appeared as an entertainment commentator and reviewer.

The final program, which aired on June 30, 2000, featured a live studio audience and appearances by all of the program&#x27;s former hosts. Comedy musical group The Arrogant Worms performed a tribute song written especially for the program, based around the theme that &quot;without &quot;Midday&quot; telling them it was time for lunch, they&#x27;d starve&quot;.

<text>N.R.M. (, , &quot;Independent Republic of Dreams&quot; in English) are a rock band from Minsk, Belarus, founded in 1981 as Mroja (). They are considered to be the most popular rock band in the country. They perform in the Belarusian language, and are a rallying point for political opposition to the Belarusian government, despite being the target of a performance ban from 2006 to 2009.

== History ==

Mroja were founded in 1981 at Alexei Glebov University in Minsk by Lavon Volski (keys, vocals) and Vladimir Davidovsky (guitar). They held their first gig on 7 November 1981. Through the 1980s, there were several lineup changes. A few albums were also released. On 24 September 1989, the group played the Chervona Ruta festival in Chernovtsy, playing the songs &quot;Šmat&quot;, &quot;Australijskaja polka&quot;, &quot;Mama — Mafija&quot; and &quot;Ziamla&quot;. In 1989, they recorded eight songs with producer Alexander Shtilman, released the following year as &quot;Dvaccać vośmaja zorka&quot; (28th Star) on Melodiya, the group&#x27;s only release with the label. The lineup on &quot;DVZ&quot; was: Lavon Volski – keyboards and lead vocals, Benedict Konev-Petushkovich – guitars, Yury Levkov – bass and Oleg Demidovich – drums and backing vocals. Davidovsky had left the group that year and was replaced by Konev-Petushkovich, who stayed on until 1992. He was replaced by Oleg Pipin and a couple of others before settling with Pete Pavlov in 1993. The Volsky-Pavlov-Levkov-Demidovich lineup would rename itself to N.R.M. in late 1994.

Their music tends toward melodic hard rock with witty and often indirectly political lyrics. Since the late 1990s, the band&#x27;s albums and publicity materials generally use the Łacinka alphabet, the Belarusian version of the Latin alphabet that was widely used alongside Cyrillic prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union. Some songs from NRM&#x27;s first album under that name, &quot;LaLaLaLa&quot;, were performed by Mroja as early as 1990.

Like several other bands that sing in Belarus, they have expressed their opposition to President Alexander Lukashenko, although they have never mentioned him by name in their lyrics. N.R.M.&#x27;s largest crowd was in Kyiv in 2004, when they played in support of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, with band members expressing their hope that something similar would happen in their own country.

In the following years N.R.M.—along with many other Belarusian bands—was unofficially banned from FM station broadcast in Belarus. There was no written blacklist, but FM station managers said they received unofficial &quot;recommendations&quot; from the authorities.

Despite this unofficial three-year ban, the group continued its concert activity. Numerous performances abroad took place in Poland, Germany, Slovakia, Sweden. In Belarus, however, the group remained on the forbidden list, therefore they seldom held public concerts and played in underground conditions.

In 2007, sixth studio album &quot;06&quot; was released. It was recorded, according to Lavon Volski, under the influence of political events of spring 2006 in Belarus. The album is compiled with songs of different styles. The violoncello, mandoline, and keyboard were used, all of which were new instruments for the group. For the first time songs were sung not only by Lavon Volski, but also by other participants of the group and even a children&#x27;s choir.

After a late-2007 meeting of Belarusian rock-musicians with the deputy head of the Presidential Administration on Ideology Oleg Proleskovsky, the band was removed from the banned list.

For its concert, at the &quot;Rock Coronation Awards&quot; 2009 ceremony in May 2010 the band got awarded in the category of “Event of the Year”.

In 2010, Volski left the group. N.R.M. continued playing as a three-piece band. Their last album, &quot;D.P.B.Č&quot;, was released in 2013.

Ten years after Volski&#x27;s departure, the band reunited to release a video entitled &quot;Try čarapachi 2020&quot;, in support of the Belarusian pro-democracy protests, as the song, originally released in 2000, had become an anthem of the demonstrations.

<doc id="1254718" wikidata="Q7520939" url="?curid=1254718" title="Simplified Cangjie">
<text>Simplified Cangjie, known as Quick () is a stroke based keyboard input method based on the Cangjie IME () but simplified with select lists.
Unlike full Cangjie, the user enters only the first and last keystrokes used in the Cangjie system, and then chooses the desired character from a list of candidate Chinese characters that pops up. This method is popular in Hong Kong and Macau, the latter in particular.

Simplified Cangjie is one of the few input methods which has an IME pre-installed on Traditional Chinese-capable personal computers.

==Performance and learning==
Although described as having an easier learning curve with less errors, Simplified Cangjie users have slower typing speed compared to full Cangjie. The user must choose from a list of candidate characters, which can be compared to &quot;hunt and peck&quot; vs. ordinary touch typing. Because Simplified Cangjie does not promote the full sequence of keystrokes of standard Cangjie, it could leave simplified Cangjie users without knowledge of how to code a character without the disambiguation lists.

==Implementations==
===Windows===
In Windows, Simplified Cangjie is called &#x27;Quick&#x27;. Microsoft Quick IME is bundled with all Traditional Chinese editions of Windows 3.1x or higher. Since Office 2007 and Windows 7, Microsoft offers two types of Quick: &#x27;Quick&#x27; and &#x27;New Quick&#x27;. Both are found under the section for Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan). The main difference between the two is that after the second keystroke, traditional Quick shows its drop down list while &#x27;New Quick&#x27; will guess and output a character depending on the context (the New-Quick list needs to be manually invoked with an arrow key). &#x27;New Quick&#x27; may also change previous characters of the sentence depending on whether the context changes. Microsoft also claims New-Quick to have an improved learning algorithm.
===macOS===
* Sucheng input is part of the standard installation of macOS.

==Adoption==
===Hong Kong===
In Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong, average computer users tend to prefer Simplified Cangjie over the full Cangjie largely due to its ease of use, and also the lack of other input methods available. The Cangjie IME itself has evidence of a strong presence in Hong Kong with it being available on most operating systems and keyboard layouts. As Hong Kong people are generally unfamiliar with phonetic-based input methods designed for Mandarin speakers such as pinyin and zhuyin, these methods are not widely used. Children in Hong Kong learn Chinese in a very different way from their peers in Mainland China and Taiwan, not only that they generally learn Chinese in Cantonese instead of Mandarin, but they do not learn any transliteration system until perhaps much later in their lives when they start learning Mandarin. Indeed, children in Hong Kong learn Chinese characters from the very beginning in kindergartens; in contrast, in mainland China and Taiwan, transliteration systems like pinyin or zhuyin are taught first before introducing any Chinese characters to children.

<doc id="1254727" wikidata="Q6807910" url="?curid=1254727" title="Meeting of Minds">
<text>Meeting of Minds is a television series, created by Steve Allen, which aired on PBS from 1977 to 1981.

The show featured actors playing historical figures, but in a talk-show format. Guests would interact with each other and host Steve Allen, discussing philosophy, religion, history, science, and many other topics.

==Origin==

Steve Allen originally created the concept for &quot;Meeting of Minds&quot; in the late 1950s. He intended to broadcast it as a segment of his weekly &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; television program but the show&#x27;s sponsor, The Chrysler Corporation, raised objections and the segment plans were cancelled. Five years later, however, Allen and an acting troupe finally performed the segment on Allen&#x27;s nightly Westinghouse show. Then, in 1971, Allen attempted to revive the concept as part of a syndicated talk series. The first episode was a critical success, and the program won three local Emmy awards. Allen then personally financed the development of six additional one-hour programs, which were ultimately produced by PBS beginning in 1977.

==PBS series 1977–1981==
The series was filmed at television station KCET in Hollywood, California.
As nearly as was possible, the actual words of the historical figures were used. The show was fully scripted, yet the scripts were carefully crafted to give the appearance of spontaneous discussion among historic figures. Guests included: Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, Cleopatra, Marie Antoinette, Florence Nightingale, Thomas Paine, Francis Bacon, Thomas Jefferson, Voltaire, Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Daniel O&#x27;Connell, Catherine II, and Oliver Cromwell.

Typically, each episode would be split into two parts, broadcast separately, with most or all of the guests introduced over the course of the first part, and the discussions continuing into the second part. A total of 24 episodes (or 12 two-part episodes) were produced.

Actors made multiple appearances as different guests over the course of the series; this was particularly true of Allen&#x27;s wife, Jayne Meadows, who appeared in 18 of the 24 episodes (playing nine distinct characters). There was also one major departure from the usual format, in which William Shakespeare was joined by several characters from his plays, with Meadows playing the role of the &quot;dark lady&quot; of his sonnets.

The show won many awards, including an Emmy Award Meeting of Minds nominations:
* Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series – 1978: Steve Allen, Writer;
* Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actress in a comedy or drama series – 1978: Beulah Quo;
* Outstanding Lead Actress for a Single Performance in a drama or comedy series – 1978: Jayne Meadows;
* Outstanding Achievement in Video Tape Editing for a Series – 1977: Terry Pickford, Editor and a Peabody Award.
The scripts are available for public performance. Because of their educational nature, Allen did not attach a royalty to such performances.

==Similar series==
The Canadian television series &quot;Witness to Yesterday&quot;, created by Arthur Voronka, aired three years before Allen&#x27;s Emmy-award-winning local program. Unlike the &quot;Meeting of Minds&quot; round-table format, &quot;Witness to Yesterday&quot; employed a one-on-one interview format that focused on a single historical figure each episode. Steve Allen appeared on a 1976 episode of &quot;Witness to Yesterday&quot; as George Gershwin.

Another Canadian TV series, &quot;Titans&quot;, followed a similar format. It was originally broadcast in 1981–82.

In French-speaking Canada, a version titled &quot;Les grands esprits&quot; (&quot;The Great Minds&quot;) aired on Radio-Canada from 1982 to 1989. It was based on the original concept, with the scripts adapted and translated for the viewers by Jean Boisvert.

<text>Chris Hodgson (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was Reeve of Dysart Township in 1993, and warden of Haliburton. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1994 to 2003 representing the ridings of Victoria—Haliburton and Haliburton—Victoria—Brock. He was a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves, serving variously as Minister of Northern Development and Mines, Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet and Deputy Government House Leader, and Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.

==Background==
Hodgson was born in Millbrook, Haliburton, Ontario, to the first Director of Education for Haliburton County, John Douglas Hodgson (1926-1997) and his wife Barbara Brintell. He graduated from Trent University in 1985 with a Bachelor of Arts honours degree in history and political science. He worked as a real-estate agent for RE/MAX and worked in health care planning for Haliburton County.

Hodgson&#x27;s son, Cody, is a retired ice hockey player picked 10th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft who last played for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League in 2016. His uncle, Ronald Glen Hodgson, was a Tory MPP for many years, in the same riding later held by Chris Hodgson. His grandfather, Clayton Hodgson, also represented the riding federally from 1945 to 1963. Another uncle, Louis Hodgson, was also a PC MPP, representing the Toronto riding of Scarborough East for one term from 1963 to 1967.

==Political career==
Hodgson was the Reeve of Dysart Township, winning 70% of the vote in his election, and warden of Haliburton County, prior to entering provincial politics.

Hodgson was elected to the Ontario legislature in a 1994 by-election with 50.9% of the vote, defeating Liberal candidate Sharon McCrae by fewer than 2,000 votes in the rural riding of Victoria—Haliburton. After the by-election, there were may accusations by the Liberal opposition and media that Hodgson&#x27;s team appealed to homophobic prejudice in the region to put their candidate over the top. However, Hodgson&#x27;s campaign prioritized the ongoing recession, and electoral analysis shows that he was elected on the basis of the positive response to his 5-point plan, focusing on cutting red tape and taxes, downsizing government, creating a good job climate, bringing deficits under control, and reforming education. Meanwhile, at the time of the by-election, the Liberal Party claimed to have unequivocally supported the NDP government&#x27;s plans to provide increased social benefits for same-sex couples in Bill 167. In reality, the overwhelming majority of the Liberal caucus voted against the measure, and then opposition leader Lynn McLeod was accused of &quot;flip-flopping&quot; when she refused to support the NDP bill on the grounds of her opposition to same-sex adoption. Then Premier Bob Rae has also since been accused of using the same-sex benefits controversy as a wedge issue, “cynically cho[osing] not to whip his majority behind the bill because he saw an opportunity to blame its failure on McLeod&#x27;s Liberals” and “was more interested in stopping the then-ascendant Liberals than in advancing the cause of equality.”

After the Tories won a majority government in the provincial election of 1995, Hodgson was re-elected over McCrae by almost 20,000 votes, with 67% of the vote. On June 26, 1995, he was named Minister of Natural Resources, Development and Mines in Mike Harris&#x27;s government.

On October 10, 1997, Hodgson was named Minister of Northern Development and Mines, Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet and Deputy Government House Leader (holding the latter positions until 2001). He also served as Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing from 2001 to 2003.

Hodgson defeated McCrae for a third time in the 1999 provincial election, this time in the redistributed riding of Haliburton—Victoria—Brock. He retained his position as Chair of the Management Board in the new parliament, and was also named Commissioner of the Board of Internal Economy on July 27, 1999. After a cabinet shuffle on February 8, 2001, he was named Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.

When Harris resigned as Premier in 2002, many expected Hodgson to enter the race to replace him. Instead, he endorsed Ernie Eves, the victorious candidate. He retained the Municipal Affairs and Housing portfolio in the Eves cabinet, but unexpectedly stepped down on January 13, 2003, announcing his decision to retire from politics. He did not run in the 2003 election. In 2004, he supported John Tory&#x27;s successful bid to replace Eves as party leader.

=== Political achievements ===
As Minister of Natural Resources, Hodgson launched the Lands for Life initiative, which saw the largest increase in parks and protected space in the history of the province, and laid the groundwork for the government&#x27;s Living Legacy program, the single biggest expansion of parks in Ontario. That year, he also reinstated the Managed Forest Tax Incentive Program, which promoted environmental stewardship and economic sustainability of private forestland. Hodgson also cooperated with hunters and animal rights activists to introduce the first amended Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act in 50 years, replacing the Game and Fish Act, in an effort to toughen enforcement provisions in the industry, increase protection of a wider range of species and better manage resources. Moreover, Hodgson brought together and collaborated with Ontario trappers to form the Ontario Fur Managers Federation for the management of wild fur resources. He also created the Special Purpose Account and the Fish and Wildlife Enhancement Fund and Advisory Boards to earmark funding to fish and wildlife parks, and set up an account dedicated to fishing and hunting license revenues for the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. He also introduced Bill 52 to make Aggregate Industry more accountable for meeting strict provincial standards and removing barriers to job creation in the sector.

As Minister, Hodgson also awarded private-sector contracts to assist firefighting and frontline health and medical services at large fire sites. He led the strategy to tackle the Land Caution in the Temagami area, resolving the long-standing dispute on land use and resource management, and was also singled out for bringing together all sides of the Kawartha Highlands Signature Site and brokering an agreement by writing new legislation to turn the 36,000-hectare Kawartha Highlands into a provincial park. He was recognized as the key figure in this process by the president of the World Wildlife Fund Canada.

As Minister of Northern Development, Hodgson promoted economic diversity and the creation of long-term jobs in the North as chair of the $210-million Northern Heritage Fund and the $77-million Special Circumstances Fund, and maintained the Ontario Prospectors Assistance Program. He also helped draft the first partnership between the province and a First Nations band to manage a provincial park (Serpent Mounds). He was also praised for targeting illegal gambling and rejuvenated the horse-racing industry by banning video lottery terminals from bars and restaurants, and proposing slot machines at racetracks, rejecting a proposal for private gambling houses in a bid to consolidate the administration of legal gaming under the jurisdiction of the Ontario Lottery Corporation. His efforts were recognized by the Ontario Horse Racing Industry Association and the Responsible Gaming Council.

As Minister of Municipal Affairs, he rewrote the Municipal Act for the first time since the passage of the Baldwin Act in the late 19th century, placed protective status on the Oak Ridges Moraine and began the Smart Growth Initiative for the entire province, a program that was later renamed Places to Grow. As Minister, in conjunction with his role as Chair of the Provincial and Territorial Ministers of Housing, Hodgson persuaded the federal government to flow housing funding across the country to meet the varying needs of different regions, resulting in the construction of over 10,500 new units of affordable housing in Ontario. Hodgson also oversaw the mandate of Bill 124, ‘An act to improve public safety and to increase efficiency in building code enforcement’ under BRRAG (Building Regulatory Reform Advisory Group), which received royal assent in June 2002, and introduced legislation to help revitalize contaminated industrial sites.

In 2002, Hodgson was also responsible for Ontario&#x27;s role in hosting World Youth Day, then the largest international conference held in Canada, which generated an estimated $233 million in economic spinoffs.

===Ipperwash Inquiry===

Shortly after assuming office, Hodgson was involved in a cabinet discussion with Harris and members of the Ontario Provincial Police concerning a standoff with native protesters at Ipperwash Provincial Park. The police cleared the park by force on September 6, 1995, and in the process killed an unarmed protester named Dudley George.

The Ipperwash Inquiry into the Ipperwash shooting was established by the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty in 2004. In late 2005, former deputy Solicitor-General Elaine Todres testified that she heard Hodgson say, &quot;Get the fucking Indians out of my park&quot; at a lunch-hour meeting on the day of Dudley George&#x27;s shooting. Former Attorney General Charles Harnick had previously testified that he heard Premier Harris say &quot;I want the fucking Indians out of the park&quot; at the same meeting. Harris and Hodgson both denied the allegations when they took the stand, and Deputy Minister Ron Vrancart testified against Todres’ claims that Hodgson was angry or agitated at the meeting. He stated that the only thing Hodgson spoke about at the meeting was that the matter had nothing to do with his ministry, and as such, he should not be the spokesperson for it. Ultimately, the Report of the Ipperwash Inquiry attributed the remark to Harris. Hodgson later stated that although he was glad that the Inquiry was providing an opportunity for healing among the First Nations community, the inquiry had become a ‘show trial’ of the former Conservative government. He is quoted having said that he not only did not say those words (“If I had said it, I would have said I said it”), but stayed quiet during the meeting because he felt the issue had nothing to do with his ministry, as it was an enforcement issue.

===Cabinet positions===

== Awards ==
Hodgson&#x27;s work on the Oak Ridges Moraine was recognized by the Environmental Commissioner with the 2001-2002 ECO Award. Hodgson and his ministry were also awarded the 2001 Canadian Urban Institute Brownie Award for leadership in policy development for Ontario&#x27;s Brownfields Statute Law Amendment Act, 2001.

In 2003, the Chamber of Commerce named Hodgson Highlander of the Year for his service to Haliburton county.

He became the first MPP to have been awarded the AMO (Association of Municipalities of Ontario) award (2003). Hodgson became the first politician to win the OFAH&#x27;s Ontario Hunting Heritage Award (2003).

==After politics==
Following his retirement from politics, Hodgson has sat on a number of public and private boards, including the EACOM Timber Corp., Mineral Streams Inc., and the Brick Income Trust Ltd. Hodgson is currently president of the Ontario Mining Association, the provincial mining industry&#x27;s trade organization.

<doc id="1254747" wikidata="Q1932991" url="?curid=1254747" title="Foreigner (Foreigner album)">
<text>Foreigner is the debut studio album by British-American rock band Foreigner, released on March 8, 1977. It spun off three hit singles, &quot;Feels Like the First Time&quot;, &quot;Cold as Ice&quot; and &quot;Long, Long Way from Home&quot;. It also features album tracks such as &quot;Headknocker&quot; and &quot;Starrider&quot;, the latter of which features a rare lead vocal from lead guitarist and co-founder Mick Jones.

==Writing and recording==
Jones had written several songs that wound up on &quot;Foreigner&quot; prior to the formation of the band. Lead singer Lou Gramm sang three of them – &quot;Feels Like the First Time&quot;, &quot;Woman, Oh Woman&quot; and &quot;At War with the World&quot; in his audition to form the band. After the formation of the band, Gramm and Jones worked on several other songs, including &quot;Long, Long Way from Home&quot; (along with Ian McDonald), &quot;Cold as Ice&quot; and &quot;I Need You&quot;.

McDonald claimed that although he received a writing credit only on &quot;Long, Long Way from Home&quot; he had a significant role in writing several of the other songs on the album. According to McDonald: 

Jones had wanted Roy Thomas Baker to produce the album, but he was not available. Instead, Sarm Studios owners Gary Lyons, who had worked as an engineer on several Queen albums that Baker produced, and John Sinclair served as producers along with Jones and McDonald. There is some disagreement about the roles that Jones and McDonald played in producing the album. According to Lyons:

On the other hand, Jones says that: 

The first attempt at mixing the album was done at Sarm Studios, London, but as they were dissatisfied with the result, the album was re-mixed at Atlantic Recording Studios by Jones, McDonald and Jimmy Douglass.

==Reception==
&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Robert Hilburn summed up his contemporary review of &quot;Foreigner&quot; saying &quot;The production work is crisp, the melodies are serviceable and the vocals are eager. But there is far too little point of view to make any of it commanding.&quot; &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; critic Henry McNulty said &quot;There&#x27;s something good beginning here, and the sooner you get in on it the better.&quot; &quot;Annison Star&quot; reviewer Mike Stamler felt that most of the songs were &quot;sanforized, sanitized and safely sterilized into three basic chords&quot; with &quot;immature lyrics,&quot; leaving little variety on the album, and suggested that more instrumental solos would have been beneficial.

Allmusic critic Andy Hinds said that for suburban teenagers in the 1970s the &quot;immaculate rock sound&quot; on &quot;Foreigner&quot; &quot;was the perfect soundtrack for cruising through well-manicured neighborhoods in their Chevy Novas,&quot; and praised the band&#x27;s &quot;pure rock craftsmanship.&quot;

&quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Evan Sawdey felt that the non-single album tracks on &quot;Foreigner&quot; were more successful than their counterparts on subsequent Foreigner albums. He explicitly called out the artiness and folkiness of “Starrider”, the &quot;casual creep&quot; of “The Damage is Done” and the &quot;fiery&quot; “I Need You”, although he did say that “Woman Oh Woman” &quot;started skirting into cheesy ballad territory&quot; and that its &quot;lead synth line has not aged well at all.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; reviewer Gary Graff rated four of the songs from &quot;Foreigner&quot; (the three singles plus &quot;Headknocker&quot;) among the ten greatest Foreigner songs. Graff described &quot;Headknocker&quot; as a &quot;gritty, stomping rocker.&quot; &quot;Classic Rock History&quot; critic Brian Kachejian rated three songs from &quot;Foreigner&quot; as being among the band&#x27;s top 10 songs; &quot;Feels Like the First Time&quot;, &quot;Cold as Ice&quot; and &quot;Fool for You Anyway.&quot; Kachejian called &quot;Fool for You Anyway&quot; a &quot;great grooving ballad&quot; with &quot;a bit of an Eagles feel.&quot;

&quot;Classic Rock&quot; critic Malcolm Dome rated two songs from &quot;Foreigner&quot; as being among Foreigner&#x27;s 10 most underrated – &quot;Starrider&quot; at #7 and &quot;Long, Long Way from Home&quot; at #4. Dome calls Starrider a &quot;beautifully developed, introspective tale of aspiration,&quot; even though it doesn&#x27;t sound much like Foreigner and its lyrics &quot;come across as 50s pulp sci fi.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Eduardo Rivadavia also rated two songs from &quot;Foreigner&quot; among the band&#x27;s 10 most underrated – &quot;Fool for You Anyway&quot; at #6 and &quot;Long, Long Way from Home&quot; at #2.

Jones has rated four songs from the album (&quot;Long, Long Way from Home,&quot; &quot;Cold as Ice,&quot; &quot;The Damage Is Done&quot; and &quot;Fool for You Anyway&quot;) as being among his 11 favorite Foreigner songs.

<text>Abdolkarim Soroush ( ), born Hossein Haj Faraj Dabbagh (born 16 December 1945; ), is an Iranian Islamic and Rumi scholar, and a former professor of philosophy at the University of Tehran. He is among the most influential figures in the religious intellectual movement of Iran.

Soroush is currently a visiting scholar at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. He was also affiliated with other institutions including Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, the Leiden-based International Institute as a visiting professor for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM) and the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin.

He was named as one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people in 2005 by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and as one of the most influential intellectuals in the world by &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine in 2008. Soroush&#x27;s ideas, founded on relativism, prompted both supporters and critics to compare his role in reforming Islam to that of Martin Luther in reforming Christianity.

==Biography==
Abdolkarim Soroush was born in Tehran in 1945. Upon finishing high school and passing national entrance exams, he began studying pharmacy. After completing his degree, he moved to London where he continued his studies.

After receiving a master&#x27;s degree in analytical chemistry from University of London, he went to Chelsea College, where he studyied history and philosophy of science. Following the revolution, Soroush returned to Iran, where he published the book &quot;Knowledge and Value&quot; (&quot;Danesh va Arzesh&quot;), a book he had completed while in England. He then went to Tehran&#x27;s Teacher Training College where he was appointed the director of the newly established Islamic Culture Group. While in Tehran, Soroush established studies in both history and the philosophy of science.

A year later, all universities were shut down, and a new body was formed by the name of the Cultural Revolution Committee comprising seven members, including Abdulkarim Soroush, all of whom were appointed directly by Ayatollah Khomeini. Soroush&#x27;s joining the Cultural Revolution Committee has been criticized on two sides. He has been accused by orthodox critics of preventing the Islamization of human sciences, and of being involved in the dismissal of teachers by opponents of the Islamic Republic.

Soroush rejected the opposition&#x27;s accusation. There is no independent historical research on Soroush&#x27;s role in events that led to the Cultural Revolution and also his membership and his role in the Cultural Revolution Committee. He has welcomed such study in his interview with Professor Forough Jahanbakhsh - inquiring into modern Iranian intellectual history. Soroush would later become a strong critic of the authoritarian path taken by the Islamic Republic.

In 1983, owing to certain differences which emerged between him and the management of the Teacher Training College, he was transferred to the Institute for Cultural Research and Studies where he has served as a research member of staff. He submitted his resignation from membership in the Cultural Revolution Council to Imam Khomeini and has since held no official position within the ruling system of Iran, except occasionally as an advisor to certain government bodies. His principal position has been that of a researcher at the Institute for Cultural Research and Studies.

During the 1990s, Soroush gradually became more critical of the political role played by the Iranian clergy. He co-founded a monthly magazine, &quot;Kiyan&quot;, which soon became the most visible forum for religious intellectualism in post-revolution Iran. In this magazine he published controversial articles on religious pluralism, hermeneutics, tolerance, clericalism, and other topics. The magazine was closed down in 1998 by direct order of the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, among many other magazines and newspapers. His public lectures at universities in Iran are often disrupted by hardline Ansar-e Hezbollah vigilante groups who see his intellectual endeavors as being mainly motivated by anti-regime politics.

Since 2000, Soroush has been a visiting scholar at Harvard University, teaching Rumi poetry and philosophy, Islam and Democracy, Quranic studies and philosophy of Islamic law. He is also a scholar in residence at Yale University, and taught Islamic political philosophy at Princeton University in 2002–2003. From 2003 to 2004 he served as a visiting scholar at the Wissenschaftkolleg in Berlin. He spent the fall semester of 2007 at Columbia University and the spring semester of 2008 at Georgetown University&#x27;s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs as a visiting scholar. In the winter of 2012, he was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago teaching the intellectual and religious history of modern Iran.

== Philosophy==
Soroush&#x27;s research focuses on the philosophy of science, religion, the philosophical system of Molana Jalaleddin Balkhi (Rumi), and comparative philosophy. He is considered an expert on Rumi and Persian Sufi poetry.

The philosophy of Abdolkarim Soroush can be summarized as follows:
*Distinction between &quot;religion&quot; and our &quot;understanding of religion&quot;.
*Distinction between &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;accidental&quot; aspects of religion.
*Distinction between &quot;minimalist&quot; and &quot;maximalist&quot; interpretation of Islam.
*Distinction between values and morals that are considered internal with respect to Islam and those that are external.
*Distinction between religious &quot;belief&quot; and religious &quot;faith&quot;.
*Distinction between religion as an ideology/identity and religion of truth.

===Epistemology===
Soroush&#x27;s main contribution to Islamic philosophy is his interpretation of the Kantian distinction between &quot;a priori&quot; and &quot;a posteriori&quot; knowledge. His theory is called &quot;the theoretical contraction and expansion of religious knowledge&quot; and is primarily based on Kantian philosophy. Soroush maintains that one should distinguish between religion as divinely revealed and the interpretation of religion or religious knowledge which is based on socio-historical factors. The essence of religion is conceived by Soroush as independent from experience while religious knowledge is understood as a finite, limited, and fallible form of human knowledge, thus depending on empirical evidence.

===Religious &quot;belief&quot; and religious &quot;faith&quot;===
In an interview, Soroush said that &quot;True believers must embrace the faith of their own free will - not because it was imposed, or inherited, or part of the dominant local culture. To become a believer under pressure or coercion isn&#x27;t true belief&#x27;&quot;, and that the believer &quot;must ... remain free to leave his faith.&quot;

At Oxford, Soroush was heavily influenced by Iranian philosopher Komeil Sadeghi, to whom he has dedicated one of his books &quot;Expansion of Prophetic Experience&quot;.

=== Soroush&#x27;s political theory ===
Soroush&#x27;s political theory is in line with the modern tradition from Locke to the framers of the American Constitution. It portrays human beings as weak and susceptible to temptation, even predation. As such, they need a vigilant and transparent form of government. He believes that the assumption of the innate goodness of mankind, shared by radical utopians from anarchists to Islamic fundamentalists underestimates the staying power of social evil and discounts the necessity of a government of checks and balances to compensate for the weaknesses of human nature.

Soroush&#x27;s political philosophy, as well, remains close to the heart of the liberal tradition, ever championing the basic values of reason, liberty, freedom, and democracy. They are perceived as &quot;primary values,&quot; as independent virtues, not handmaidens of political maxims and religious dogma. Soroush entwines these basic values and beliefs in a rich tapestry of Islamic primary sources, literature, and poetry.

=== Religious democracy ===

Soroush introduced his own definition of the term &quot;religious democracy&quot; which is now a topic in contemporary Iranian philosophy and means that the values of religion play a role in the public arena in a society populated by religious people. Religious democracy falls within the framework of modern rationality and has identifiable elements. It is in this way that there are a plurality of democracies in the international community. &quot;Religious democracy&quot; is a subject of intense research in Iranian intellectual circles.

Given historical circumstances and contingencies, governments may turn out to be primarily democratic or religious. What alters the hue and color of democracy is a society&#x27;s specific characteristics and elements. The possibility of a democratic religious government also exists and is attainable, but only within the framework of justice and human rights. Religious democracy is an example of how democratic values can exist in a different cultural elaboration than what is usually known before. But, in a secular society, some other characteristic is deemed important and focused on, and that becomes the basis for democracy.

In fact relativistic liberalism and democracy are not identical since democracy is not violated when faith is embraced, it is violated when a particular belief is imposed or disbelief is punished.

We do not have one democracy but many democracies in history. We have a plurality of democracies in the international community. What emerged was that democracy prevailed in different eras depending on the conditions of the time.

Democracy cannot be derived from or based on intrareligious precepts and adjudications by religious jurists. The combination of religion and democracy ultimately depends on the foundations of human rights, justice, and limitations on power.

== Reception ==
In 2008, in an online open poll, Soroush was voted the 7th-most intellectual person in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine (UK) and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; (United States).

Due to Sorush&#x27;s prominence in the religious intellectual movement, he has been called &quot;the Luther of Islam&quot; by the media, a title he disputes as he argues his agenda is fundamentally divergent from that of Martin Luther&#x27;s.

=== Criticism and attacks ===

Soroush&#x27;s ideas have met with strong opposition from conservative elements in the Islamic Republic. 
His &quot;postmodern&quot; views on epistemology and hermeneutics have been criticized from a &quot;traditional&quot; Shi&#x27;i standpoint by the philosopher Ayatollah Abdollah Javadi-Amoli.

Both he and his audiences were assaulted by Ansar-e Hezbollah vigilantes in the mid-1990s. A law imposing penalties on anyone associating with enemies of the Islamic republic is thought by his allies to have been at least in part provoked by some of Soroush&#x27;s lectures and foreign affiliations.

According to the journalist Robin Wright:
Over the next year, he lost his three senior academic appointments, including a deanship. Other public appearances, including his Thursday lectures, were banned. He was forbidden to publish new articles. He was summoned for several long &#x27;interviews&#x27; by Iranian intelligence officials. His travel was restricted, then his passport was confiscated.

At the celebration of the sixteenth anniversary of the American embassy seizure in 1995, Wright found that Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei &quot;devoted more time berating Soroush ... than condemning the United States or Israel.&quot;

Besides opposition from conservatives, Sourush has also been criticized by secular intellectuals who disapprove of the religious aspects of his ideas and argue that religious intellectualism is a paradoxical ideology.

<text>Zhang Aiping (; January 9, 1910 – July 5, 2003) was a Chinese military leader.

==Biography==
Zhang joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1928 after taking part in a communist-led rural uprising. He participated in the Long March and served as a field commander in the Chinese Red Army, first fighting against Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Kuomintang forces, and later the Imperial Japanese Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War. During World War II Zhang commanded a guerrilla band sent to rescue U.S. flight crews who crash landed in China following the April 1942 Tokyo bombing raid led by Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle.

After 1949, Zhang was an important builder of the Chinese military forces. He commanded the first People&#x27;s Liberation Army naval force and served as an army corps commander in the Korean War. Upon his return home he served in a series of significant military and political posts. He was made a General in 1955.

Zhang supervised the Two Bombs, One Satellite project and successfully directed the development of China&#x27;s nuclear deterrent. However, he was accused of counterrevolutionary crimes and dismissed from all positions during the Cultural Revolution, when many veteran communists were attacked by Red Guards inspired by Mao Zedong&#x27;s vision of continuous revolution, and one of his legs was broken as a result. Later, Zhang would comment: &quot;The only thing the Cultural Revolution succeeded in was giving me a cane.&quot;

He reappeared in 1973 and chaired the Defense Technology Commission of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. During this time he attempted to rein in poor quality from armament factories by reestablishing government oversight over facilities which had been taken over by unsupervised workers. A biography of him by his son, PLA senior colonel Zhang Sheng, recorded the first of such incidents, when Zhang went to investigate the rocket gyroscope manufacturer Factory 230 which had become infamous for poor quality, which caused abnormally high accident rates in launch tests and notably two reconnaissance satellites being lost:

Zhang submitted a report on the conditions of the factory to the state council, which called a meeting on the subject. During the meeting, Zhang further described the status of the workers:

Zhang was able to regain control of the factory by threatening to remove anyone participating in political factionalism. He was given the support of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.

He later served as defense minister from 1982 until 1988. He served as deputy chief of the PLA general staff, vice premier, and chaired a key commission that sought to modernize the PLA.

During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, Zhang Aiping signed a letter opposing the enforcement of martial law by the Army in Beijing.

Zhang Aiping died in Beijing at the age of 93.

<text>The Curtiss-Wright AT-9 Jeep is an American twin-engined advanced trainer aircraft used by the United States during World War II to bridge the gap between single-engined trainers and twin-engined combat aircraft. The AT-9 had a low-wing cantilever monoplane configuration, retractable landing gear and was powered by two Lycoming R-680-9 radial engines.

==Development==
Curtiss-Wright anticipated the requirement for this type of &quot;high-performance&quot; aircraft and designed the Curtiss-Wright CW-25, a twin-engined trainer, which possessed the takeoff and landing characteristics of a light bomber. Using the same basic design as the larger Cessna AT-17 Bobcat, the new CW-25 was designed to simulate the demands of multi-engined operations. The design featured a small layout, grouping two Lycoming R-680-9 radial engines forward and using a retractable tailwheel landing gear to achieve the performance necessary to meet the requirements of an advanced trainer. The single CW-25 prototype acquired for evaluation had a welded steel-tube fuselage structure with the wings, fuselage and tail unit fabric-covered.

==Operational history==

The first prototype Model 25 flew in 1941 and the production version entered service as the AT-9 in 1942. Named the &quot;Fledgling&quot; by Curtiss-Wright, it commonly became known as the &quot;Jeep&quot; in the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The prototype CW-25 had a fabric-covered steel tube fuselage and fabric-covered wings and tail units, but production AT-9s were of stressed metal skin construction.

The AT-9 was purposely designed to be less stable and proved to be difficult to fly or land, which made it particularly suitable for teaching new pilots to cope with the demanding flight characteristics of a new generation of high-performance, multi-engined aircraft such as the Martin B-26 Marauder and Lockheed P-38 Lightning.

A total of 491 AT-9s were built before production ended and a new production run of 300 of the generally similar AT-9A commenced.

Because of its difficult flying characteristics the AT-9 was not offered for sale to civilians after the war, although many non-flying examples were given to ground schools for training purposes.

<doc id="1254779" wikidata="Q2707400" url="?curid=1254779" title="Double Vision (Foreigner album)">
<text>Double Vision is the second studio album by the British-American rock band Foreigner, released on 20 June 1978 by Atlantic Records. Recorded between March - May 1978, it was Foreigner&#x27;s only album co-produced by Keith Olsen and the last recording with bass guitarist Ed Gagliardi who would be later replaced by Rick Wills.

&quot;Double Vision&quot; was the first in the line of many other recordings in which A&amp;R executive John Kalodner would simply have his name listed twice in liner notes, as a play on the title of this album. The phrase &quot;John Kalodner: John Kalodner&quot; originated when the producer Olsen was wondering just how to credit Kalodner&#x27;s involvement in the band and the album. In keeping with the double vision theme, guitarist Mick Jones came up with an idea of doubling the name.

&quot;Tramontane&quot; is the only instrumental track Foreigner have released to date on a studio album.

Mick Jones takes the lead vocals on &quot;Back Where You Belong&quot; and &quot;I Have Waited So Long&quot;.

==Release==
The album peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and earning platinum certification a week after its release. It has now been certified 7× platinum for sales in excess of 7 million units and along with the compilation &quot;Records&quot; (1982) is counted as Foreigner&#x27;s best selling album. In Europe, however, &quot;Double Vision&quot; reached the Top 40 only in the United Kingdom.

The lead single, released in June 1978, was &quot;Hot Blooded,&quot; which reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. In September, it was followed by &quot;Double Vision,&quot; which charted at number 2. This was the highest position Foreigner had attained to that time. The third and final single, &quot;Blue Morning, Blue Day,&quot; was released in December and climbed to number 15 on the chart.

==Reception==
&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Robert Hilburn described &quot;Double Vision&quot; as &quot;slickly produced, commercially powerful, but artistically vapid.&quot; &quot;The Record&quot; critic Rick Atkinson said of the album that it used the same formula as Foreigner&#x27;s debut album such that &quot;Foreigner&#x27;s Clone&quot; would have been an appropriate title.

According to Atkinson, &quot;Tramontane&quot; was the only &quot;new and different track&quot; on the album. Atkinson describes &quot;Tramontane&quot; as having a &quot;heavy keyboard line&quot; but that all members of the group &quot;get a quick shot at the spotlight.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;The Morning News&quot; critic Gary Mullinax described &quot;Tramontane&quot; as &quot;a densely textured instrumental that is pleasant enough but doesn&#x27;t really go anywhere.&quot; Unlike most Foreigner songs, Tramontane was written primarily by Al Greenwood. Ian McDonald played a lyricon on the track.

&quot;Murfreesboro Press&quot; critic Van West also recognized &quot;Double Vision&quot; as having similarities to &quot;Foreigner&quot;, but said that there are important differences; in particular, &quot;Double Vision&quot; has &quot;more individualistic interpretations&quot; and a &quot;heavy metal tonal structure&quot; instead of some of the &quot;careful harmonies&quot; of the debut album.

New York &quot;Daily News&quot; critic Ace Adams called &quot;Double Vision&quot; &quot;a fine collection of songs&quot; that is &quot;hard rock at its best.&quot;

&quot;Record World&quot; said that, besides the hit singles, &quot;&#x27;Back Where You Belong&#x27; and &#x27;Spellbinder&#x27; shows [Foreigner&#x27;s] expertise and maturity as a band.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Evan Sawdey commented on the non-single album tracks, saying that &quot;the gloomy &#x27;Tramontane&#x27; and the rewrite of &#x27;The Damage is Done&#x27; that was &#x27;Spellbinder&#x27; did little to expand the band’s sound so much as it was a pushing of its existing abilities into more commercial shapes&quot; but praised &quot;the shimmering acoustic wonder that was &#x27;Back Where You Belong.&#x27;&quot;

Jones has rated two songs from the album (&quot;Blue Morning, Blue Day&quot; and &quot;Spellbinder&quot;) as among his 11 favorite Foreigner songs.

<doc id="1254812" wikidata="Q3182266" url="?curid=1254812" title="Civic Conservative Party (Slovakia)">
<text>The Civic Conservative Party (, OKS) is a centre-right liberal conservative political party in Slovakia. It has one seat in the National Council, following the 2023 election. It has also representation at regional and local level.

The OKS was founded in November 2001 as a parliamentary schism from the Democratic Party. The party has relied on electoral alliances with other centre-right parties, including the Sloboda a Solidarita (SaS), Most–Híd and Conservative Democrats of Slovakia (KDS). The party won its best result, of 2.1%, in alliance with the KDS at the 2009 European election. The party won seats in the National Council for the first time in 2010, on the Most–Híd list. In 2016 the party won one seat in the National Council on the Sloboda a Solidarita list and in 2020 election the party won two seats also on the Sloboda a Solidarita list.

The OKS was a member of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe until 2022.

==History==
The Civic Conservative Party was formed by Democratic Party (DS) members of the National Council on 10 November 2001. The DS initially offered the OKS and the Liberal-Democratic Union to run in the 2002 election, on a united list, but then withdrew and endorsed the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union. The OKS attempted to negotiate a joint list with the Christian Democratic Movement and Party of the Hungarian Coalition, but this failed to materialise. Undeterred, the OKS ran alone under the banner &#x27;Call for Slovakia&#x27; (&quot;Výzva pre Slovensko&quot;) and gained 9,422 votes, or 0.32% of the national total.

In the December 2002 local elections, two mayors were elected for OKS. In addition, OKS took 20 deputy seats, or 0.1% of the seats nationwide. In July 2003, it was one of four parties across Europe endorsing the soft eurosceptic Prague Appeal, along with the British Conservative Party, Law and Justice of Poland, and the Czech Civic Democrats.

The OKS supported František Mikloško of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) in the 2004 presidential election. Mikloško was one of the few candidates not being former members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and ended up fifth with 6.51% share of the total vote. In the European election two months later, the party fielded Peter Osuský as its sole candidate. He received 7,016 votes: 1% share of the vote.

In the 2005 regional elections, the party gained three seats: František Šebej and Peter Tatár in Bratislava Region and Katarína Adamicová in Žilina Region. This represented 0.72% share nationwide.

OKS offered to run on the common candidate list with the Christian Democratic Movement in the 2006 parliamentary election. This offer was turned down by the KDH, the Civic Conservatives had to raise 500,000 korún as a fee for the party to participate. In March 2006, OKS member Ondrej Dostál applied to the Constitutional Court, considering the possible unconstitutionality of the election participation fee, saying the fee affects his right to run for office. In the election, former chairman of the Czechoslovak Constitutional Court Ernest Valko and former Minister of Health Rudolf Zajac appeared on the OKS list. The party obtained 6,262 votes which represented 0.27% share of the total vote.

In the 2009 regional elections, the OKS won four seats, up one from 2005: three in Bratislava Region and one in Žilina Region.

===Parliamentary party===
In the 2010 election, fourteen OKS members stood on the Most–Híd party list. Strongly defining themselves as against the left-wing nationalist coalition, four MPs were elected from the list, along with ten Most–Híd members. This gave the OKS its first parliamentary representation since 2002. Most–Híd entered a centre-right coalition government, which the Civic Conservatives supported, but the OKS did not join the government themselves, and remained separate from Most–Híd.

In August, the party objected to coalition plans for tax reform, calling instead for closing tax loopholes and funding lower taxes by cutting government spending. In October 2010, Peter Zajac called for Dobroslav Trnka to step down as General Prosecutor, after Trnka criticised Interior Minister Daniel Lipšic and other officials, saying that Trnka did not respect the law or the human rights of ethnic Hungarians. The party supported changes to the controversial State Language Act, but the OKS&#x27;s Ondrej Dostál said the changes did not go far enough in allowing use of minority languages.

In March 2011, the party opposed the government&#x27;s plans to increase taxes on the self-employed, and instead proposed funding cuts in payroll tax by cutting government spending. The four OKS MPs have proposed a law restricting the government&#x27;s power to build highways on privately owned land, which had earlier been ruled unconstitutional.

In October 2011, the party opposed the government&#x27;s commitment to the European Financial Stability Facility. In response, František Šebej left the OKS on 11 October and joined Most–Híd. After the subsequent fall of the government, the OKS attempted to renew their alliance with Most–Híd at the 2012 election, but were rejected. Instead, several OKS candidates were running on the Ordinary People list. However, they had left the list before the elections, in protest to the request of the leader of Ordinary People Igor Matovič, that all candidates from the list undertake polygraph test.

The party advocates respect for people regardless of their religion, race and nationality. Their aim is to pursue conservative values stemming from the inner need of individuals to live in a world whose highest value is personal freedom tempered by personal responsibility and an awareness of personal obligations towards society.

The OKS characterizes itself as a party of reforms. According to its platform, it rejects:

* all kinds of social engineering
* totalitarianism and autocracy
* historical, as well as current value relativism.

It respects the historical memory as a part of the national cultural identity and thus rejects lining up behind autocracy, communism and fascism.

The stated aim of the OKS is to pursue the system of European conservative values such as consistency, veracity, fairness, honesty, respectability, solidarity, and observance of written and non-written treaties and agreements.

<doc id="1254814" wikidata="Q2520384" url="?curid=1254814" title="Head Games (album)">
<text>Head Games is the third studio album by the British-American rock band Foreigner, released on 11 September 1979 by Atlantic Records. Recorded at Atlantic Studios in New York, with additional recording and whole mixing taking place at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, it was the only Foreigner album co-produced by Roy Thomas Baker, best known for working on Queen&#x27;s classic albums. It marked the first appearance of new bass guitarist Rick Wills (formerly of Jokers Wild, Roxy Music and Small Faces) who replaced Ed Gagliardi (who was fired from the band), and was the last album with founding members Ian McDonald and Al Greenwood, who would leave the band after the recording. &quot;Head Games&quot; is also the last Foreigner album to feature a lead vocal by guitarist Mick Jones (&quot;The Modern Day&quot;).

== Cover art ==
The model in the photograph on the front cover is American actress and film producer Lisanne Falk. The cover art was criticized by feminists for showing a teenage girl looking afraid in a boys&#x27; restroom, possibly relieving herself by placing her bottom over the bowl of the urinal. According to Foreigner lead singer Lou Gramm, the cover was intended to be cute, like a cartoon. Gramm said &quot;The girl is being naughty, erasing graffiti [in the restroom]. She&#x27;s looking at whoever buys the album, she&#x27;s been caught.&quot; According to &quot;Miami Herald&quot; critic Bill Ashton, the cover art is a play on the album title &quot;Head Games&quot;. Atlantic Records publicity director Stuart Ginsburg pointed out that &quot;head is a naval term for bathroom&quot; and Foreigner&#x27;s media coordinator Susan Steinberg stated that &quot;the girl on the cover is shocked by the graffiti. It&#x27;s not like somebody is attacking her. I swear to you, it&#x27;s not premeditated.&quot;

==Release==
In August 1979, the release of the album was preceded by its first single, the hard rock song &quot;Dirty White Boy&quot;, which peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The album itself continued Foreigner&#x27;s popularity, climbing to number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and receiving a Platinum certification four months after it hit the stores. As of 2017, &quot;Head Games&quot; has gained a 5× Platinum status for selling at least 5 million copies in the United States. The next singles were the title track and &quot;Women&quot;, which reached number 14 and 41, respectively.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the group settles comfortably into the hard-driving, macho-posturing idiom so common to many other teen heavy metal bands.&quot; The &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; determined that &quot;Head Games&quot; &quot;is strongest when it rocks hard and nasty.&quot; The &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; concluded that the album &quot;serves mainly to remind us that commercially hot rock bands are loathe to change what got them hot in the first place.&quot; &quot;The San Bernardino County Sun&quot; opined that &quot;Foreigner has maintained a quality control, and &quot;Head Games&quot; is the band&#x27;s third impressive album in a row.&quot;

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Eduardo Rivadavia rated three of the songs from &quot;Head Games&quot; – &quot;Dirty White Boy&quot;, &quot;Rev on the Red Line&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Get Even with You&quot; – among Foreigner&#x27;s 10 most underrated songs. Rivadavia praises Jones&#x27; &quot;sizzling&quot; guitar solo on &quot;Rev on the Red Line&quot;, calling it one of the band&#x27;s best b-sides. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; critic Malcolm Dome rated two songs from &quot;Head Games&quot; as being among Foreigner&#x27;s 10 most underrated – &quot;Rev on the Red Line&quot; at #10 and &quot;Dirty White Boy&quot; at #3. Dome particularly praised the &quot;sublime melody&quot;, Lou Gramm&#x27;s vocal performance and the way all the musicians &quot;show their skills, without ever showing off&quot; on &quot;Rev on the Red Line&quot;. One the other hand, &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Evan Sawdey called &quot;Rev on the Red Line&quot; &quot;paint-by-numbers rock&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewer Gary Graff rated &quot;Seventeen&quot; to be Foreigner&#x27;s ninth greatest song, calling it a &quot;hidden gem&quot;.

<text>Helen Johns (born April 24, 1953) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003 and served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.

She worked as a controller of small and medium-sized businesses for fifteen years before entering public life, and was also the Director and Treasurer of the Huron United Way.

<doc id="1254826" wikidata="Q865858" url="?curid=1254826" title="Niki (airline)">
<text>Niki (also styled as NIKI or flyNiki, legally &quot;NIKI Luftfahrt GmbH&quot;) was an Austrian low-cost airline headquartered in &quot;Office Park I&quot; at Vienna Airport in Schwechat. It operated scheduled and charter services to European and North African leisure destinations from Vienna, Salzburg, Graz and Innsbruck and also started services from several German airports in March 2017. Niki had a variety of owners, including two stints of ownership under former car racer Niki Lauda. In January 2018, the airline was acquired by Lauda, an airline that also had ties to Niki Lauda.

==History==
===Early years===
In 2003, Niki Lauda, ex-Grand Prix driver and founder of Lauda Air, acquired the former Aero Lloyd Austria operation. The airline started operations on 28 November 2003.

Although Niki was often described as &quot;low-cost&quot;, it provided full services, such as free refreshments, newspapers, and baggage. It offered a sandwich or a cold snack, soft drinks, juice, tea, and coffee on all short-haul flights as well as on charter routes to Greece, Tunisia, and Turkey. On mid-haul charter flights to the Canary Islands and Egypt, all passengers were offered a warm snack. Also, gourmet menus from Demel could be ordered before the flight. There was also a buy on board service.

===Development as an Air Berlin subsidiary===
On 9 January 2004, Niki announced cooperation with Air Berlin. In late 2011, Niki merged completely with Air Berlin, sharing operations, booking systems, and aircraft. On 20 March 2012, Niki became an &quot;affiliate member&quot; of Oneworld as a subsidiary company of Air Berlin. Starting in late 2012, Niki successively repainted their aircraft in the Air Berlin paint scheme, using the Niki logo only at the nose. The new paint scheme was applied during regular C checks.

In October 2014, Niki announced the cancellation of their flights from Vienna to Copenhagen, Moscow, and Frankfurt due to decreasing demand. In exchange, new leisure routes will be started by summer 2015. Also in spring 2015, Niki started to replace its fleet of Embraer 190s with Airbus A319-100s from its parent, Air Berlin, with the used Embraers being transferred to Helvetic Airways.

===Sale to Etihad Airways===
On 5 December 2016, parent company Air Berlin announced plans to sell its entire 49 percent stake in Niki to its own minority owner Etihad Airways. Etihad Airways itself would merge Niki into a new joint-venture to be created with the German leisure carrier TUIfly. At the same time, Niki and Air Berlin would exchange several aircraft to harmonize each fleet. It had also been announced that Niki would take over several routes to southern European, north African, and Turkish leisure destinations from Air Berlin as part of the new joint-venture. However, the sale never happened.

Also in December 2016, Niki announced the termination of its only medium-haul route, from Vienna to Abu Dhabi, Etihad&#x27;s home base, by March 2017. Niki later also announced it plans to terminate all of its 12 routes from Vienna to non-leisure destinations such as Milan or Zürich by 30 January 2017. In January 2017, it was also announced that Niki will cease all operations to and from Linz Airport at short notice due to the restructuring measures. The announcement was made after the 2017 schedule had already been made available for booking. For the 2017 season, Niki reduced the number of flights from Austria to 56 flights a week to 20 destinations, compared to 34 destinations in 2016.

Shortly after, it was announced that Niki would take over several Air Berlin leisure routes to and from Germany. It also has been announced that Niki&#x27;s fleet will be switched over to Airbus A321s only while the smaller A319s and A320s are handed over to Air Berlin. It has also been announced that TUI fly Deutschland will additionally start to operate 15 Boeing 737s currently wet-leased to Air Berlin for Niki.

===Failed takeover by Lufthansa and IAG===
On 17 August 2017, Niki&#x27;s parent Air Berlin announced it was filing for bankruptcy but that all operations would continue until further notice. On 9 October 2017, Air Berlin told its staff that it would cease all remaining operations under its own brand name, but that Niki flights would continue after this date.

On 12 October 2017, it was announced that German Lufthansa would purchase some of the assets from Air Berlin which included Niki and operations would continue and jobs were to be saved. On 24 October 2017, it was announced that Niki was to be absorbed into Lufthansa&#x27;s low-cost subsidiary Eurowings Europe. It was announced that Lufthansa plans to cease the Niki brand by the end of 2017 altogether.

However, on 13 December 2017, Lufthansa pulled out of the agreement due to signs from the European Commission that the merger would not be approved. Niki declared bankruptcy and ceased all operations on 14 December 2017. The day after, former owner Niki Lauda expressed interest in repurchasing the airline named after him.

On 29 December 2017, it was announced that International Airlines Group (IAG), parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, would acquire for 36.5 million euros major parts of Niki including 15 Airbus A321 aircraft and traffic rights in Düsseldorf, Munich, Vienna, Zurich and Palma de Mallorca. IAG planned to establish a new Austrian subsidiary of Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling as a replacement for Niki. For this purpose, a new subsidiary of Vueling in Austria was to be founded and act independently. Of the approx. 1000 Niki employees, 740 were to be retained. On 8 January 2018, a Berlin administrative court ruled that only an Austrian court had the jurisdiction to handle the insolvency of Niki.

===Subsequent takeovers===
On 23 January 2018, the Austrian Press Agency announced that Niki Lauda&#x27;s company Lauda had beaten IAG in the bid for Niki, and would take over the company. Less than two months later, Ryanair agreed to purchase a majority stake in Laudamotion, initially acquiring almost 25 percent for less than 50 million euros ($61.7 million) with the intent to purchase another 50 percent at a later date. The deal was subsequently approved by the European Union. Eleven planes from Niki were being operated by Laudamotion as of April 2018.

==Destinations==
Niki operated scheduled services to leisure destinations mainly in Spain, Portugal, and North Africa from its home base in Vienna as well as several more airports throughout Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.

===Codeshare agreements===
Niki maintained codeshares with the following airlines:
* Alitalia
* American Airlines
* Etihad Airways
* Iberia
==Fleet==
Prior to the shutdown in December 2017, the fleet of Niki consisted of the following aircraft:

<text>James Martin Holman Jr. (born September 10, 1957, in Louisville, Kentucky) is a literary translator, professor, puppeteer, and puppet theater director. He did his graduate work in Japanese literature at the University of California, Berkeley.

Holman lived in Japan for more than 14 years as a missionary, graduate student, professor of Japanese literature, and resident director of two study centers: the Japan Center for Michigan Universities (JCMU) in Hikone and the Associated Kyoto Program Center (AKP) at Doshisha University in Kyoto. He was the first non-Japanese to train and perform in Japan as a traditional puppeteer in the style of puppetry commonly known as Bunraku or &quot;ningyō jōruri&quot;, making his stage debut in 1994 with the 170-year-old Tonda Traditional Bunraku Puppet Troupe in Shiga Prefecture. He is the founding director of the Bunraku Bay Puppet Troupe, based in Columbia, Missouri, which performs traditional Japanese puppet theater in the United States.

In 2017, the film &quot;Kaiju Bunraku&quot; debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, featuring the puppetry of Holman&#x27;s Bunraku Bay Puppet Theater.

Holman has also published many translations of modern Japanese and Korean literature, including &quot;The Old Capital&quot; (1987), &quot;Palm-of-the-Hand Stories&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu&quot; (1998), by Nobel Prize-winning Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata; &quot;The Book of Masks&quot; (1989) and &quot;Shadows of Sound&quot; (1990), by Korean writer Hwang Sun-wŏn; and &quot;The House of Twilight&quot; by Korean author Yun Heung-gil. Holman has taught Japanese language, literature, and theater and Korean literature at colleges and universities in Japan, the United States, and Canada.

From 2005 until 2017, Holman taught Japanese language, Japanese and Korean Literature, and Japanese theater, as Teaching Professor and Coordinator of the Japanese Studies Program at the University of Missouri. In 2019 he moved to the city of Tokushima in Japan, where currently lives and where he founded the troupe, Tokubeiza, which performs traditional Japanese puppet theater.

<text>Grímsey () is a small Icelandic island, off the north coast of the main island of Iceland, where it straddles the Arctic Circle. Grímsey is also known for the puffins and other sea birds which visit the island for breeding.

The island is administratively part of the municipality of Akureyri on the mainland; before 2009 it constituted the rural municipality of Grímseyjarhreppur . The island&#x27;s only settlement is Sandvík . In 2021 Grímsey had 57 inhabitants. The island is accessible by regular ferry and air passenger service. 

==Geography==
Grímsey is the northernmost inhabited Icelandic territory; the rapidly disappearing islet of Kolbeinsey lies some farther north, but has never been habitable. The closest land is the coastal island of Flatey, Skjálfandi, to the south.

There are steep cliffs all along the coastline except on the southwestern shore. Grímsey has an area of , and a maximum elevation of .

===Arctic Circle===
The Arctic Circle runs through the island, which attracts many of the island&#x27;s visitors, as it is the only accessible location in Iceland that far north. However, due to long-term oscillations in the Earth&#x27;s axis, the Arctic Circle is shifting northward by about per year (varying substantially from year to year due to the complexity of the movement). As of 2020, the place where the line crosses the island is close to the northern tip and by the middle of the 21st century it will pass north of Grimsey altogether. 

There are three permanent markers for historical positions of the Arctic Circle, placed in 1717, 1817, and 1917. In 2017, a movable monument – an eight-tonne stone sphere dubbed &quot;Orbis et Globus&quot; – was placed on the circle, and is periodically moved to the corrected location. The Arctic Circle has crossed Grímsey since 1750, but will move northward from the island around the year 2047. For this moment it is planned to roll the sphere &quot;Orbis et Globus&quot; into the ocean.

==Climate==
Despite the northerly latitude, the climate is generally mild because of the North Atlantic Current, which brings warm water from the Gulf of Mexico. The maximum daily mean temperature in any month falls short of 10 °C, so it is within a tundra (ET) climate. The record high temperature of Brú is registered on July 25, 1955.

==Biology==
Though treeless, the island&#x27;s vegetation cover is rich, consisting of marshland, grass, and moss, and the island is home to many birds, especially auks. Gulls and arctic terns also inhabit the island. The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports large seabird breeding colonies of black-legged kittiwakes, Atlantic puffins, razorbills and common murres.

==Economy and society==
The origin of the name is uncertain. The island is not mentioned in the &quot;book of settlements&quot;. It may be named after a man named Grím otherwise unknown or devoted to Wotan -secondarily named Grím.

The principal industrial activity is commercial fishing. Agriculture and collecting seabird eggs are also common. Grímsey Airport has a 1,036m north–south runway on the west side of the island, with regular flights to Akureyri. A ferry connects the island three days a week with Dalvík on the mainland.

The single settlement on the southwest side of the island is officially known as Sandvík. It has a community center, a shop, a library, a public indoor swimming pool, and a school from kindergarten to grade 8. (Beyond this age, students travel to Akureyri for further education.) Grímsey has two small hotels, a camp ground, and a nine-hole disc golf course.

The island has acquired a reputation for being a bastion of chess-playing. On learning this in the 1870s, American scholar and keen chess player Willard Fiske took an interest in Grímsey, sending supplies, supporting the economy, and leaving money in his will, though he never visited the island. 

The Protestant Church on Grímsey was destroyed by a fire in September 2021. It had been built from driftwood in 1867 and renovated in 1956. A choir and tower were added in 1932. The nave was roughly 7.7 metres in length and 4.75 metres broad.

<doc id="1254837" wikidata="Q1096151" url="?curid=1254837" title="Battle of Delville Wood">
<text>The Battle of Delville Wood was a series of engagements in the 1916 Battle of the Somme in the First World War, between the armies of the German Empire and the British Empire. Delville Wood , was a thick tangle of trees, chiefly beech and hornbeam (the wood has been replanted with oak and birch by the South African government), with dense hazel thickets, intersected by grassy rides, to the east of Longueval. As part of a general offensive starting on 14 July, which became known as the Battle of Bazentin Ridge General Douglas Haig, Commander of the British Expeditionary Force, intended to capture the German second position between Delville Wood and Bazentin le Petit.

The attack achieved this objective and was a considerable though costly success. British attacks and German counter-attacks on the wood continued for the next seven weeks, until just before the Battle of Flers–Courcelette the third British general attack in the Battle of the Somme. The 1st South African Infantry Brigade made its Western Front début as part of the 9th (Scottish) Division and captured Delville Wood on 15 July. The South Africans held the wood until 19 July, at a cost in casualties similar to those of many British brigades on 1 July.

The village and wood formed a salient, which could be fired on by German artillery from three sides. The ground was a rise from Bernafay and Trônes woods, to the middle of the village; the village or the wood could be held without possession of the other. After the Battle of Bazentin Ridge, the British tried to advance on both flanks to straighten the salient at Delville Wood, to reach good jumping off positions for a general attack. The Germans tried to eliminate the salient and to retain the ground, which shielded German positions from view and overlooked British positions. For the rest of July and August, both sides fought for control of the wood and village but struggled to maintain the tempo of operations.

Wet weather reduced visibility and made the movement of troops and supplies much more difficult; ammunition shortages and high casualties reduced both sides to piecemeal attacks and piecemeal defence on narrow fronts, except for a small number of bigger and wider-front attacks. Most attacks were defeated by defensive firepower and the effects of inclement weather, which frequently turned the battlefield into a mud slough. Delville Wood is well preserved with the remains of trenches, a museum and a monument to the South African Brigade at the Delville Wood South African National Memorial.
==Background==
===Strategic developments===

In 1916, the French had absorbed the lessons of the failed breakthrough offensives of 1915 and abandoned attempts to break the German front in a sudden attack, as the increased depth of German defences had made this impossible. Attacks were to be limited, conducted over a wide front, preceded by artillery &quot;preparation&quot; and made by fresh troops. (nibbling) was expected to lead to the &quot;crumbling&quot; of German defences. The offensive was split between British and Dominion forces in the north (from Gommecourt to Maricourt) and the French in the south (from the River Somme to the village of Frey). After two weeks of battle, the German defenders were holding firm in the north and centre of the British sector, where the advance had stopped except at Ovillers and Contalmaison. There had been substantial Entente gains from the Albert–Bapaume road southwards.

The British attacks after 1 July and the rapid French advance on the south bank, led Falkenhayn on 2 July, to order that

On the next day, General Fritz von Below issued an order of the day forbidding voluntary withdrawals,

after his Chief of Staff, General Paul Grünert and the corps commander General Günther von Pannewitz, were sacked for ordering the XVII Corps to withdraw to the third position. Falkenhayn ordered a &quot;strict defensive&quot; at Verdun on 12 July and the transfer of more troops and artillery to the Somme front, which was the first strategic success of the Anglo-French offensive. By the end of July, finding reserves for the German defence of the Somme caused serious difficulties for Falkenhayn, who ordered an attack at Verdun intended to pin down French troops. The Brusilov Offensive continued and the German eastern armies had to take over more of the front from the Austro-Hungarians when Brody fell on 28 July, to cover Lemberg. Russian attacks were imminent along the Stochod river and the Austro-Hungarian armies were in a state of disarray. Conrad von Hötzendorf, the Austro-Hungarian Chief of the General Staff, was reluctant to take troops from the Italian front, when the Italian army was preparing the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo, which began on 6 August.

===Tactical developments===

On 19 July, the German 2nd Army was split and a new 1st Army was established, to command the German divisions north of the Somme. The 2nd Army kept the south bank, under General Max von Gallwitz, transferred from Verdun, who was also made commander of with authority over Below and the 1st Army. Lossberg remained as the 1st Army Chief of Staff and Bronsart von Schellendorff took over for the 2nd Army. Schellendorff advocated a counter-offensive on the south bank but Falkenhayn turned this down, because forces released from the Verdun front were insufficient, five divisions having been sent to the Russian Front in July.

On 21 July Falkenhayn ruled that no more divisions could be removed from quiet fronts for the Somme until exhausted divisions relieved them. He needed seven &quot;fought out&quot; divisions to replace those already sent to the Somme. Gallwitz began to reorganise the artillery and curtailed harassing and retaliatory fire to conserve ammunition for defensive fire during Anglo-French attacks. From gun and howitzer batteries arrived on the Somme, along with five reconnaissance flights, three artillery flights, three bombing flights and two fighter squadrons. Since 1 July, thirteen fresh divisions had arrived on the north bank of the Somme and three more were ready to join the defence.

The strain on the Germans on the Somme worsened in August; unit histories make frequent reference to high losses and companies being reduced to eighty men before relief. Many German divisions came out of a period on the Somme front having suffered at least and some German commanders suggested a change to the policy of unyielding defence. The front line was lightly held, with reserves further back in a defensive zone but this had little effect on the losses caused by the Anglo-French artillery. Movement behind the German front was so dangerous that regiments carried rations and water for a four- to five-day tour with them. Work on new rear lines was constant, despite shortages of materials and rail lines being overloaded with troop trains. Supply trains were delayed and stations near the front were under bombardment by artillery and aircraft. Light railways were insufficient and lorries and carts were pressed into use, using roads which, while paved, needed constant maintenance, which was difficult to ensure with the troops available.

The German artillery suffered many losses and the number of damaged guns exceeded the repair capacity of workshops behind the front. Inferior ammunition exploded prematurely, bursting gun barrels. Destruction, wear and tear from 26 June to 28 August, led to the guns and the guns in the being lost. The Anglo-French maintained air superiority but German air reinforcements began to arrive by mid-July. More artillery was sent to the Somme but until the reorganisation and centralisation of artillery control had been completed, counter-battery fire, barrage-fire and co-operation with aircraft remained inadequate. Gallwitz considered plans for the relief attack but lack of troops and ammunition made it impractical, particularly after 15 July, when Falkenhayn withheld more fresh divisions and the 1st Army had to rely on the 2nd Army for reinforcements. In early August, an attempt was made to use men over 38 years old, who proved a danger to themselves and were withdrawn.

==Prelude==
===British preparations===

British attacks south of the road between Albert and Bapaume began on 2 July, despite congested supply routes to the French XX Corps and the British XIII, XV and III Corps. La Boisselle near the road was captured on 4 July, Bernafay and Caterpillar woods were occupied from and then fighting to capture Trônes Wood, Mametz Wood and Contalmaison took place until early on 14 July. As German reinforcements reached the Somme front, they were thrown into battle piecemeal and had many casualties. Both sides were reduced to improvised operations; troops unfamiliar with the ground had little time for reconnaissance, whose artillery was poorly co-ordinated with the infantry and sometimes fired on ground occupied by friendly troops. British attacks in this period have been criticised as uncoordinated, tactically crude and wasteful of manpower, which gave the Germans an opportunity to concentrate their inferior resources on narrow fronts.

The Battle of Bazentin Ridge (14–17 July) was planned as a joint attack by XV and XIII Corps, whose troops would assemble in no man&#x27;s land in darkness and attack at dawn after a five-minute hurricane bombardment. Haig was sceptical of the plan but eventually accepted the views of Rawlinson and the corps commanders, Lieutenant-General Henry Horne and Lieutenant-General Walter Congreve. Preparatory artillery bombardments began on 11 July and on the night of British troops advanced stealthily across no man&#x27;s land, which in parts was wide, to within of the German front line and then crept forward. At the hurricane bombardment began and the British began to run forward. On the right flank, the 18th (Eastern) Division (Major-General Ivor Maxse), captured Trônes Wood in a subsidiary operation and the 9th (Scottish) Division (Major-General William Furse) was repulsed from Waterlot Farm but on the left got into Delville Wood. The 21st, 7th and 3rd Division on the left (northern) flank, took most of their objectives. By mid-morning of the German second position had been captured, cavalry had been sent forward and the German defenders thrown into chaos.

===Longueval and Delville Wood===

The village of Longueval enclosed a cross-roads which ran south-west to Montauban, west to the two Bazentins, north to Flers and east to Ginchy. South African forces used the English place names in Longueval and Delville Wood, as they were more meaningful than French terms. Pall Mall led north from Montauban and Bernafay Wood, to the cross-roads on the southern fringe of the village, where Sloan Street branched to the west, to a junction with Clarges Street and Pont Street. Dover Street led to the south-east and met a track running north from Trônes Wood. Two roads converged on Pall Mall at the main square; North Road ran between Flers and High Wood, with a path to the west meeting Pont Street, which ran into High Wood and the second road ran south-east to Guillemont. Clarges Street ran west from the village square to Bazentin le Grand and Prince&#x27;s Street ran east through the middle of Delville Wood.
Parallel to Clarges Street, about further north, ran Duke Street, both bounded on the west by Pont Street and by Piccadilly on the east side. Orchards lay between Piccadilly and North Street, beyond which Flers Road forked to the right, skirting the north-west edge of Delville Wood. The wood lay north of the D20 road, west of Ginchy and the north-west edge was adjacent to the D 197 Flers road. Delville Wood was bounded on the southern edge by South Street, which was linked to Prince&#x27;s Street by Buchanan Street to the west, Campbell Street in the centre and King Street to the east, three parallel rides which faced north. Running east from Buchanan Street and parallel to Prince&#x27;s Street was Rotten Row. On the north side of Prince&#x27;s Street ran Strand, Regent Street and Bond Street, three rides to the northern fringe of the wood.

===British plans===
General Sir Henry Rawlinson, commander of the Fourth Army ordered Congreve to use XIII Corps to capture Longueval, while the XV Corps (Lieutenant-General Horne) was to cover the left flank. Rawlinson wanted to advance across no man&#x27;s land at night for a dawn attack after a hurricane bombardment to gain surprise. Haig opposed the plan because of doubts about inexperienced New Army divisions assembling on the battlefield at night but eventually deferred to Rawlinson and the corps commanders, after modifications to their plan. An advance to Longueval could not begin until Trônes Wood was in British possession as it dominated the approach from the south. The capture of Longueval would then require the occupation of Delville Wood on the north-eastern edge of the town. If Delville Wood was not captured German artillery observers could overlook the village and German infantry would have an ideal jumping-off point for attacks on Longueval.

A British advance would deepen the salient already formed to the north-east of Montauban but also assist British attacks to the south on Ginchy and Guillemont and on High Wood to the north-west. The 9th (Scottish) Division was to attack Longueval and the 18th (Eastern) Division on the right was to occupy Trônes Wood. Furse, ordered that the Longueval attack be led by the 26th Brigade. The 8th (Service) Battalion, Black Watch and the 10th (Service) Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders would lead, with the 9th (Service) Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders in support and the 5th (Service) Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders in reserve. The 27th Brigade would follow on, to mop up any bypassed German troops and reinforce the leading battalions, once they had entered the village. When Longueval had been secured, the 27th Brigade was to pass through the 26th Brigade to take Delville Wood. The 1st South African Brigade was to be kept in reserve.

===German preparations===

Despite considerable debate among German staff officers, Falkenhayn based defensive tactics in 1916 on unyielding defence and prompt counter-attacks, when ground had been lost. On the Somme front Falkenhayn&#x27;s construction plan of January 1915 had been completed by early 1916. Barbed wire obstacles had been enlarged from one belt wide to two, wide and about apart. Double and triple thickness wire was used and laid high. The front line had been increased from one line to three, apart, the first trench occupied by sentry groups, the second () for the front-trench garrison and the third trench for local reserves. The trenches were traversed and had sentry-posts in concrete recesses built into the parapet. Dugouts had been deepened from to , apart and large enough for . An intermediate line of strongpoints () about behind the front line was also built. Communication trenches ran back to the reserve line, renamed the second line, which was as well built and wired as the first line. The second line was beyond the range of Allied field artillery, to force an attacker to stop and move field artillery forward before assaulting the line.

The German front line lay along the old third position, which in this area ran from the southern edge of Bazentin le Grand to the south fringe of Longueval and then curved south-east past Waterlot Farm and Guillemont. An Intermediate Line ran roughly parallel behind Delville Wood on a reverse slope, the wood being on a slight ridge which extended east from the village. Longueval had been fortified with trenches, tunnels, concrete bunkers and had two field guns. The village was garrisoned by the divisions of IV Corps (General Sixt von Armin) and the 3rd Guard Division. The north and north-west was held by Thuringian Infantry Regiment 72 of the 8th Division. In and around Delville Wood, an area of about , which abutted the east side of Longueval and extended to within of Ginchy, were Infantry Regiment 26 of the 7th Division, Thuringian Infantry Regiment 153 and Infantry Regiment 107. A British attack would have to advance uphill from Bernafay and Trônes woods, across terrain with a similar shape to a funnel, broad in the south and narrowing towards Longueval in the north. Sixt von Armin suspected that an attack would begin on 

==Battle==
===French Tenth and Sixth armies===
The French Sixth Army was pushed back from Biaches south of the Somme by a German counter-attack on 14 July, which was retaken along with Bois Blaise and La Maisonette. (Military units after the first mentioned are French unless specified.) On 20 July, I Corps attacked at Barleux, where the 16th Division took the German front trench and was then stopped short of the second objective by massed German machine-gun fire, before being counter-attacked and pushed back to the start line with Refusals of orders occurred in the 2nd Colonial Division, which led to two soldiers being court-martialled and shot. Joffre issued orders that the possibility of a rapid end to the war was to be played down. XXXV Corps had been moved from the north bank and reinforced by two divisions and attacked Soyécourt, Vermandovillers and high ground beyond, as a prelude to attacks by the Tenth Army from Chilly, northwards to the Sixth Army boundary.

XXXV Corps captured the north end of Soyécourt and Bois Étoile but then bogged down against flanking machine-gun fire and counter-attacks. For the remainder of July and August, the German defence on the south bank contained the French advance. On the north side of the Somme, the Sixth Army advanced by methodical attacks against points of tactical value, to capture the German second position from Cléry to Maurepas. VII Corps was brought in on the right of XX Corps, for the attack on the German second position, which was on the opposite side of a steep ravine, behind an intermediate line and strong points in the valley. On 20 July, XX Corps attacked with the 47th and 153rd divisions; the 47th Division attack on the right was stopped by machine-gun fire in front of Monacu Farm, as the left flank advanced and took Bois Sommet, Bois de l&#x27;Observatoire and the west end of Bois de la Pépinière. The 153rd Division captured its objectives, despite the British 35th Division further north being driven back from Maltz Horn Farm.

===1st South African Brigade===
====14–16 July====

The divisions of XIII Corps and XV Corps attacked on 14 July, just before dawn at on a front. The infantry moved forward over no man&#x27;s land to within of the German front line and attacked after a five-minute hurricane bombardment, which gained a measure of tactical surprise. Penetrating the German second line by a sudden blow on a limited front was relatively easy but consolidating and extending the breach against alerted defenders was far more difficult. The attack on Longueval met with initial success, the thin German outpost line being rapidly overwhelmed. By mid-morning, the British troops had reached the village square, by fighting house-to-house. The effect of British artillery-fire diminished because the north end of the village was out of view on a slight north-facing slope; German reinforcements reached the village; artillery and machine–gun fire from Delville Wood and Longueval, raked the 26th Brigade. By the afternoon, the western and south-western parts of the village had been occupied. The 27th Brigade, intended for the attack on Delville Wood, had been used to reinforce the attack. At Furse ordered the 1st South African Brigade to take over the attack on the wood.
Three battalions of the 1st South African Brigade were to attack Delville Wood, while the 1st Battalion continued as a reinforcement of the 26th and 27th brigades in Longueval. The attack at was postponed to and then to on 15 July, due to the slow progress in the village. Brigadier-General Henry Lukin was ordered to &quot;take the wood at all costs&quot; and that his advance was to proceed, even if the 26th and 27th Brigades had not captured the north end of the village. Lukin ordered an attack from the south-west corner of the wood on a battalion front, with the 2nd Battalion forward, the 3rd Battalion in support and the 4th Battalion in reserve. The three battalions moved forward from Montauban before first light, under command of Lieutenant–Colonel W. E. C. Tanner of the 2nd Battalion. On the approach, Tanner received instructions to detach two companies to the 26th Brigade in Longueval and sent B and C companies of the 4th Battalion. The 2nd Battalion reached a trench occupied by the 5th Camerons, which ran parallel to the wood and used this as a jumping-off line for the attack at 

The attack met little resistance and by the South Africans had captured the wood south of Prince&#x27;s Street. Tanner sent two companies to secure the northern perimeter of the wood. Later during the morning, the 3rd Battalion advanced towards the east and north-east of the wood and by Tanner reported to Lukin that he had secured the wood except for a strong German position in the north-western corner adjoining Longueval. The South African Brigade began to dig in around the fringe of the wood, in groups forming strong–points supported by machine–guns. The brigade occupied a salient, in contact with the 26th Brigade only along the south-western edge of the wood adjoining Longueval. The troops carried spades but digging through roots and remnants of tree trunks, made it impossible to dig proper trenches and only shallow shell scrapes could be prepared before German troops began to counter-attack the wood.
A battalion of the 24th Reserve Division counter-attacked from the south-east at having been given five minutes&#x27; notice but only managed to advance to within of the wood before being forced to dig in. An attack by a second battalion from the Ginchy–Flers road was also repulsed, the battalions losing In the early afternoon a battalion of the 8th Division attacked the north-eastern face of the wood and was also repulsed, after losing all its officers. At on 15 July Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 6 of the 10th Bavarian Division attacked in force from the east but was partially driven back by rifle and machine-gun fire. At Tanner reported to Lukin that German forces were massing to the north of the wood and he called for reinforcements, as the South Africans had already lost a company from the 2nd (Natal and Free State) Battalion.

Tanner had received one company from the 4th (Scottish) Battalion from Longueval and Lukin sent a second company forward to reinforce the 3rd (Transvaal &amp; Rhodesia) Battalion. Lukin sent messages urging Tanner and the battalion commanders to dig in regardless of fatigue, as heavy artillery fire was expected during the night or early the next morning. As night fell German high explosive and gas shelling increased in intensity and a German counter-attack began at midnight with orders to recapture the wood &quot;at all costs&quot;. The attack was made by three battalions from the 8th and 12th Reserve divisions and managed to reach within , before being driven under cover by artillery and machine-gun fire. Later that night, fire into Delville Wood, from four German brigades, reached a rate of per minute.
On 14–15 July the 18th Division had cleared Trônes Wood to the south and had established a line up to Maltz Horn Farm, adjacent to the French 153rd Division. At Lukin was ordered to capture the north-west part of Delville Wood at all costs and then to advance westwards to meet the 27th Brigade, as it attacked north and north–eastwards through Longueval. The advance began on 16 July at but the casualties of the South Africans had reduced the weight of the attack, which was repulsed by the German defenders. The 27th Brigade advance was pinned down in the village by machine-gun fire from an orchard in the north end of Longueval. Survivors of the attack fell back to their trenches in the middle of the wood and were under bombardment for the rest of the day. The situation became desperate and was made worse by an attack by Thuringian Infantry Regiment 153.

===17–19 July===

In the evening of 16 July, the South Africans withdrew south of Prince&#x27;s Street and east of Strand Street, for a bombardment on the north-west corner of the wood and the north end of Longueval. On 17 July, the 27th Brigade attacked northwards in Longueval and the 2nd South African Battalion plus two companies of the 1st Battalion, attacked westwards in the wood. The South African attack was a costly failure and the survivors were driven back to their original positions, which came under increased German artillery-fire in the afternoon. In the evening Tanner was wounded and replaced by Lieutenant-Colonel E. F. Thackeray, of the 3rd Battalion, as commander in Delville Wood. The 9th Division drew in its left flank and the 3rd Division (Major-General J. A. L. Haldane), was ordered to attack Longueval from the west during the night. Huge numbers of shells were fired into the wood and Lukin ordered the men into the north-western sector, to support the attack on Longueval due at During the night, the German 3rd Guards Division advanced behind a creeping barrage of guns and over guns. The Germans reached Buchanan and Princes streets, driving the South Africans back from their forward trenches, with many casualties.
The Germans spotted the forming up of the troops in the wood and fired an unprecedented bombardment; every part of the area was searched and smothered by shells. During the barrage, German troops attacked and infiltrated the South African left flank, from the north-west corner of the wood. By the South African position had become desperate as German attacks were received from the north, north-west and east, after the failure of a second attempt to clear the north-western corner. At news was received that the South Africans were to be relieved by the 26th Brigade. The 3rd Division attack on Longueval had taken part of the north end of the village and Sixt von Armin ordered an attack by the fresh 8th Division, against the Buchanan Street line from the south east, forcing Thackeray to cling to the south western corner of the wood for two days and nights, the last link to the remainder of the 9th Division (Map 4).

On the morning of 18 July, the South Africans received support from the relatively fresh 76th Brigade of the 3rd Division, which attacked through Longueval into the south-western part of the wood, to join up with A Company of the 2nd South African Battalion, until the 76th Brigade was forced back by German artillery-fire. In the south, the South Africans recovered some ground because the Germans had made limited withdrawals ready for counter-attacks in other areas. A German bombardment during the night became intense at sunrise and per minute fell into Longueval and the wood, along with heavy rain, which filled shell-craters. At German infantry attacked Longueval and the wood from the east, north and north-east. Reserve Infantry Regiment 107 attacked westwards along the Ginchy–Longueval road, towards the 3rd South African Regiment, which was dug in along the eastern fringe of the wood, which commanded Ginchy. The German infantry were cut down by small-arms fire as soon as they advanced and no more attempts were made to advance beyond the intermediate line.
The main German attack was made by the 8th Division and part of the 5th Division from the north and north-east. Elements of nine battalions attacked with Infantry Regiment 153 was to advance from south of Flers, to recapture Delville Wood and reach the second position along the southern edge of the wood, the leading battalion to occupy the original second line from the Longueval–Guillemont road to Waterlot Farm, the second battalion to dig in along the southern edge of the wood and the third battalion to occupy Prince&#x27;s Street along the centre of the wood. At first the advance moved along the sunken Flers road, north of the wood, which was confronted by the 2nd South African Regiment along the north edge of the wood. By afternoon, the north perimeter had been pushed further south by German attacks. Hand-to-hand fighting occurred all over the wood, as the South Africans could no longer hold a consolidated and continuous line, many of them being split into small groups without mutual support. By the afternoon of 18 July, the fresh Branderberger Regiment had also engaged. A German officer wrote,

by 19 July, the South African survivors were being shelled and sniped from extremely close range.
In the early morning, Reserve Infantry Regiment 153 and two companies of Infantry Regiment 52, entered the wood from the north and wheeled to attack the 3rd South African Battalion from behind, capturing six officers and from the Transvaal Battalion; the rest were killed. By mid morning, Black Watch, Seaforth and Cameron Highlanders in Longueval tried to charge into the wood but were repulsed by German small-arms fire from the north-west corner of the wood. The brigade was short of water, without food and unable to evacuate wounded; many isolated groups surrendered, after they ran out of ammunition. In the afternoon, the 53rd Brigade advanced from the base of the salient to reach Thackeray at the South African headquarters but was unable to reach the forward elements of the South African brigade. This situation prevailed through the night of 

===20 July===
On 20 July, the 76th Brigade of the 3rd Division was again pushed forward to attempt to relieve the 1st South African Brigade. The Royal Welch Fusiliers attacked towards the South Africans but by Thackeray had informed Lukin that his men were exhausted, desperate for water and could not repel a further attack. Troops of the Suffolk Regiment and the 6th Royal Berkshires broke through and joined with the last remaining South African troops, in the segment of the wood still under South African control. Thackeray marched out of the wood, leading two wounded officers and ranks, the last remnant of the South African Brigade. Piper Sandy Grieve of the Black Watch, who had fought against the South African Boers as part of the Highland Brigade, in the Battle of Magersfontein in 1899 and been wounded through the cheeks, played the South Africans out. The survivors spent the night at Talus Boise and next day withdrew to &quot;Happy Valley&quot; south of Longueval.

===21 July – 20 August===

A British bombardment preparatory to the offensive planned for the night of began at on 22 July. The 3rd Division attacked Delville Wood and the north end of Longueval, from the west with the 9th Brigade from Pont Street, as the 95th Brigade of the 5th Division attacked German strong points in the orchards to the north. The two battalions of the 3rd Division had only recently arrived and had received their orders at the last minute. The bombardment was considered poor but the attack began at and the troops were quickly engaged by German machine-guns from the front and left flank. The advance covered a considerable distance but was forced back to Piccadilly and then to Pont Street, where the survivors were bombarded by German artillery. The two 95th Brigade battalions also had early success and threatened the German right flank. The Flers road was crossed and a strong point captured and consolidated but then a German counter-attack pushed both battalions back to Pont Street; a second attack was planned and then cancelled. Relief of the 3rd Division began on the night of 25 July by the 2nd Division, ready for another attack on most of Delville Wood, when the west end of Longueval and the rest of the wood were attacked by the 5th Division, in a larger operation by XIII Corps and XV Corps due on 27 July.

German artillery fired on the routes into Longueval and sent alarm signals aloft from the front-line several times each day. On 27 July, every British gun in range, fired on the wood and village from as infantry patrols went forward through a German counter-bombardment, to study the effect of the British fire. The patrols found &quot;a horrible scene of chaos and destruction&quot;. When the bombardment began, about sixty German soldiers surrendered to the 2nd Division and at zero hour, two battalions of the 99th Brigade advanced, with trench-mortar and machine-gun sections in support. The infantry found a shambles of shell-craters, shattered trees and débris. After a ten-minute advance the troops reached a trench along Prince&#x27;s Street, full of dead and wounded German infantry, taking several prisoners. The advance was continued when the barrage lifted by the supporting companies, which moved to the final objective about inside the northern fringe of the wood around A third battalion moved forward to mop up and guard the flanks but avoided the east end of the wood. As consolidation began, German artillery fired along Prince&#x27;s Street and caused far more casualties than those suffered during the attack.

On the left flank, the 15th Brigade of the 5th Division, attacked with one battalion forward and one in support. German artillery-fire before zero hour was so extensive, that most of a company of the forward battalion was buried and the Stokes mortars knocked out. The support battalion was pushed forward and both advanced on time into the west end of the wood, where they linked with the 99th Brigade. The attack on Longueval was hampered by the German barrage to the south, which cut communications and by several machine-guns firing from the village. An attempt by the Germans to reinforce the garrison from Flers failed, when British artillery-fire fell between the villages but the German infantry held out at the north end of Longueval. A British line was eventually established from the north-west of Delville Wood, south-west into the village, below the orchards at Duke Street and Piccadilly. A German counter-attack began at from the east end of Delville Wood against the 99th Brigade.

The German attack eventually penetrated behind Prince&#x27;s Street and pushed the British line back to face north-east. Communications with the rear were cut several times and when the Brigade commander contradicted a rumour that the wood had been lost, the 2nd Division headquarters assumed that the wood was empty of Germans. Skirmishing continued and during the night, two battalions of the 6th Brigade took over from the 99th Brigade. The 15th Brigade was relieved by the 95th Brigade that night and next morning Duke Street was occupied unopposed. On 29 July, the XV Corps artillery fired a bombardment for thirty minutes and at a battalion advanced on the left flank, to a line north of Duke Street; a battalion on the right managed a small advance.

On 30 July, subsidiary attacks were made at Delville Wood and Longueval, in support of a bigger attack to the south by XIII Corps and XX Corps. The 5th Division attacked with the 13th Brigade, to capture German strong points north of the village and the south-eastern end of Wood Lane. A preliminary bombardment began at but failed to suppress the German artillery, which fired on the village and the wood. British communications were cut again, as two battalions advanced at the right-hand battalion was caught by German artillery-fire, at the north-west fringe of the wood but a company pushed on and dug in beyond. The left-hand battalion crawled forward under the British barrage but as soon as it attacked, massed German small-arms fire forced the troops under cover in shell-holes. A battalion on the right with only was so badly shelled, that a battalion was sent forward and a reserve battalion of the 15th Brigade was also sent forward. Attempts were made to reorganise the line in Longueval, where many units were mixed up; German artillery-fire was continuous and after dark the 15th Brigade took over. After representations by Major-General Reginald Stephens it was agreed that the 5th Division would be relieved during 1 August.

A lull occurred in early August, as the 17th Division took over from the 5th Division; the 52nd Brigade was ordered to attack Orchard Trench, which ran from Wood Lane to North Street and the Flers Road into Delville Wood. A slow bombardment by heavy artillery and then a five-minute hurricane bombardment was followed by the attack at on 4 August. Both battalions were stopped by German artillery and machine-gun fire; communications were cut and news of the costly failure was not reported until The 17th Division took over from the 2nd Division on the right and attacked again on 7 August, after a methodical bombardment, assisted by a special reconnaissance and photographic sortie by the RFC. The 51st Brigade attacked at to establish posts beyond the wood but the British were stopped by German artillery-fire while still inside. After midnight, a fresh battalion managed to establish posts north of Longueval. German defensive positions in the area appeared much improved and the 17th Division was restricted to obtaining vantage points, before it was relieved by the 14th Division on 12 August.

XV Corps attacked again on 18 August; in Delville Wood, the 43rd Brigade of the 14th Division, attacked the north end of ZZ Trench, Beer Trench up to Ale Alley, Edge Trench and a sap along Prince&#x27;s Street, which had been found on reconnaissance photographs. The right-hand battalion advanced close behind a creeping barrage at reached the objective with few losses where the defenders surrendered. The south of Beer Trench was obliterated but the left-hand battalion was swept by artillery and machine-gun fire before the advance and reduced to remnants. The battalion took Edge Trench and bombed along Prince&#x27;s Street, when German supports bombed down Edge Trench and retook it. In hand-to-hand fighting, the British held on to Hop Alley and blocked Beer Trench; two German attacks from Pint Trench were stopped by small-arms fire. During the British attack, the German line from Prince&#x27;s Street to the Flers road was bombarded by trench mortars. On the left, two battalions of the 41st Brigade attacked Orchard Trench and the south end of Wood Lane; keeping touch with an attack by the 33rd Division on High Wood. The battalion on the right advanced close up to the creeping barrage, found Orchard Trench nearly empty and dug in beyond, with the right flank on the Flers road. The left-hand battalion was enfiladed from the left flank, after the 98th Brigade of the 33rd Division was repulsed but took part of Wood Lane.

===21 August – 3 September===
On 21 August, a battalion of the 41st Brigade attacked the German defences in the wood, obscured by smoke discharges on the flanks but the German defenders inflicted nearly by small-arms fire. At midnight, an attack by the 100th Brigade of the 33rd Division, from the Flers road to Wood Lane began but the right-hand battalion was informed too late and the left-hand battalion attacked alone and was repulsed. In a combined attack with the French from the Somme north to the XIV Corps and III Corps areas, XV Corps attacked to complete the capture of Delville Wood and consolidate from Beer Trench to Hop Alley and Wood Lane. The 14th Division operation was conducted by a battalion of the 41st Brigade and three from the 42nd Brigade.

The right hand battalion was repulsed at Ale Alley but the other battalions, behind a creeping barrage moving in lifts of only , advanced through the wood until their right flank was exposed, which prevented most of Beer Trench from being occupied. On the left flank, the westernmost battalion dug in on the final objective and gained touch with the 33rd Division on the Flers road. The new line ran south, from the right of the battalion near the Flers road, into the wood and then south-east along the edge to Prince&#x27;s Street. Flares were lit for contact-aeroplanes, which were able to report the new line promptly. Over and more than twelve machine-guns were captured.

Early next day, a battalion of the 42nd Brigade captured Edge Trench, to a point close to the junction with Ale Alley. Amidst rain delays, the 7th Division relieved the right-hand brigade of the 14th Division on the night of and later a battalion of the 43rd Brigade made a surprise attack, took the rest of Edge Trench and barricaded Ale Alley, taking about from Infantry Regiment 118 of the 56th Division, which eliminated the last German foothold in Delville Wood. An attack on the evening of 28 August, by a battalion on the right flank and a battalion of the 7th Division to the right, from the east end of the wood, against Ale Alley to the junction with Beer Trench failed. The 14th and 33rd divisions were relieved by the 24th Division by the morning of 31 August, after the 42nd Brigade had built posts along the wreckage of Beer Trench as far as the south-east of Cocoa Lane and dug a sap from the end of Prince&#x27;s Street. The last week of August had been very wet, which made patrolling even more difficult but XV Corps detected the arrival of German reinforcements. The activity of the German artillery around Delville Wood suggested another counter-attack was imminent, as the 24th Division took over the defence of the wood and Longueval. German aircraft flew low over the British front positions and then a much more intense bombardment began.

The German attack began at and the 7th Division on the right of the corps, was attacked along Ale Alley and Hop Alley and replied with rapid fire. The German infantry were repulsed but a second attack at was only held after hand-to-hand fighting just east of the wood. More German aircraft reconnoitred the area and German artillery-fire greatly increased around followed by a third attack at which pushed the British back into the wood, except on the left at Edge Trench. On the right flank, the Ginchy–Longueval road was held against the German attacks and some reinforcements arrived after dark, at the east end of the wood. At the north-east side, the right-hand battalion of the 72nd Brigade had moved forward, to dig in beyond the German bombardment and was not attacked; the left-hand battalion withdrew its right flank to Inner Trench to evade the bombardment and a strong point on Cocoa Lane was captured.

The left flank of the battalion and the neighbouring right-hand battalion of the 73rd Brigade, were attacked at and repulsed the German infantry and with small arms and artillery-fire. To the west, the left-hand battalion was caught in the German bombardment and lost nearly German infantry advanced from Wood Lane and bombed along Tea Trench almost as far as North Street. Other German troops attacked south-east into Orchard Trench, before British reinforcements arrived and contained the German advance, with the help of flanking fire from the 1st Division beyond the III Corps boundary. It was not until long after dark, that the extent of the German success was communicated to the XV Corps headquarters, where plans were made to recapture the ground next day.

A battalion from the 73rd Brigade, 24th Division, counter-attacked at dawn, bombing along Orchard Trench but the attack failed. More bombers attacked around Pear Street at but were also repulsed. A costly frontal attack by a battalion of the 17th Brigade at overran Orchard Trench and Wood Lane up to Tea Trench. On the east side of the wood, two platoons from the 91st Brigade attacked at but were forced back by small arms fire and at a battalion of the 24th Division managed to bomb a short way down Edge Trench, which was almost invisible after the recent bombardments. On 1 September, the battalion attacked again but made little progress against German bombers and snipers.

The 7th Division was due to attack Ginchy on 3 September but the Germans in Ale Alley, Hop Alley and the east end of Delville Wood commanded the ground over which the attack was to cross. A preliminary attack was arranged with the 24th Division, to begin five minutes before the main attack to recapture the ground. The 7th Division bombers used &quot;fumite&quot; grenades but these were too easy to see and alerted the German defenders and the 24th Division battalion received such contradictory orders that its attack north of Ale Alley failed. Attacks on 4 September by two companies at the east end of the wood also failed and next day two companies managed to reach the edge of the wood close to Hop Alley and dig in. On the night of 5 September, the 24th Division was relieved by the 55th Division and the 166th Brigade dug in beyond the north-east fringe of the wood unopposed.

===Air operations===
The first attack on Longueval and Delville Wood from was conducted under the observation of 9 Squadron, which directed counter-battery artillery-fire, photographed the area and flew contact-patrols to report the positions of infantry. During the morning a patrol of F.E. 2bs from 22 Squadron escorted the corps aircraft but no German aeroplanes were seen. The British aircraft carried new &quot;Buckingham&quot; tracer ammunition, which made aiming easier and began to attack German targets on the ground. The crews machine-gunned German infantry near Flers, cavalry sheltering under trees and other parties of German troops to the south-west. During the XV Corps attacks on 24 August, 3 Squadron aircraft brought back detailed information about the progress of the infantry, who had lit many red flares when called on by contact-aircraft. Fourteen flares were seen by an observer at to the north of the wood, which showed that the troops had overrun their objective and were under shrapnel fire from British artillery. The information was taken back and dropped by message-bag, which got the barrage lifted by . The crew returned to the wood, completed the contact-patrol and reported to the XV Corps headquarters by showing that the 14th Division was held up on the east side of the wood. A further attack the following morning captured the area, which was closely observed by British aircraft.

===German 2nd Army===
====14–19 July====

According to the German official history, &quot;Der Weltkrieg&quot; and regimental accounts, some units were not surprised. The British attack succeeded at a few points, from which the troops worked sideways to roll up the German defenders, a tactic not used on 1 July. Bavarian Infantry Regiment 16 lost and the headquarters of Infantry Regiment , Bavarian Infantry Regiment 16, I Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 91 and II Battalion, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 16 were captured. Sixt von Armin, who had taken over from Longueval to the Ancre that morning, ordered troops to hold their positions. The 7th Division had been relieving the 183rd Division and part was sent to Longueval and the second line further back, along with resting units from the 185th, 17th Reserve, 26th Reserve, 3rd Guard divisions and troops of the 55th Landwehr Regiment (7th Landwehr Division), equivalent to fourteen battalions. After alarmist reports of British cavalry in High Wood and the fall of Flers and Martinpuich, Below ordered the 5th, 8th, 8th Bavarian Reserve and 24th Reserve divisions to counter-attack to stop the British advance. When the true situation was discovered, the counter-stroke was cancelled and the 5th and 8th divisions returned to reserve.

On 15 July, II Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 107 of the 24th Reserve Division attacked from the south-east of Delville Wood at about but was stopped by small-arms and artillery-fire short of the wood and driven under cover. An attack by the III Battalion from the Flers–Ginchy road soon after, was also stopped short and the battalions lost I Battalion, Infantry Regiment 72 from the 8th Division attacked the north-eastern face of the wood and was also repulsed. Sixt von Armin ordered another attack after dark by the 8th Division and 12th Reserve Division, to take back the wood at all costs. The preparations were rushed and no postponement was allowed; a bombardment began at before the advance began around midnight by I and II battalions of Infantry Regiment 153 from the 8th Division and II Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 107 of the 12th Reserve Division, on the east, north-east and northern faces of the wood, which also failed against artillery and machine-gun fire, short of the wood, after which German artillery bombarded the wood all night. Further attempts to regain the wood on 16 July were also costly failures.

The 8th Division planned to recapture Delville Wood on 18 July and the most advanced troops were withdrawn late on 17 July, for a bombardment which began at using the heavy guns of groups and , the field artillery of the 8th Division and three batteries of the 12th Reserve Division, about guns and guns, heavy guns and howitzers. The German bombardment turned Delville Wood into an &quot;inferno&quot;, before slackening at around during a British attack. After German troops from I Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 104 and II and III battalions, Reserve Infantry Regiment 107, attacked the wood in several waves from the north-east, as eight companies of Infantry Regiment 153 of the 8th Division attacked from the north, to reach a line from Longueval to Waterlot Farm road. Another attack from the north and north-west by five companies of Infantry Regiment 26 of the 7th Division, reached the southern edge of the village.

The attacks were not co-ordinated but were led by companies of (Storm Troops) and (Flamethrower) detachments, which fell into confusion in the wood; after dark parts of II Battalion, Infantry Regiment 52 of the 5th Division reinforced the troops in the wood and the village. On 19 July, the Germans in the wood endured massed British artillery-fire; Infantry Regiment 52 and part of Grenadier Regiment 12 were sent into the wood and the village, where Infantry Regiment 26 had appealed for relief before it collapsed. A British attack early on 20 July reached the village, where two companies were overwhelmed and taken. By 20 July, Infantry Regiment 26, which had been at full strength on 13 July, was reduced to and with Infantry Regiment 153, was relieved by Grenadier Regiment 12, which held Delville Wood and Longueval with Infantry Regiment 52, under the command of the 5th Division.

===German 1st Army===
====20 July – 3 September====
The German defence of the Somme was reorganised in July and the troops of the Second Army north of the Somme were transferred to the command of the 1st Army, re-established under the command of Below, overseen by General Max von Gallwitz the new commander of the 2nd Army and . During a British attack on 23 July the 5th Division had to engage nearly all of its troops to resist the attack, which threw the defence into confusion. In anticipation of more British attacks a box-barrage was fired around the village and wood. Grenadier Regiment 8 suffered the loss taken prisoner in a British attack on 27 July, one prisoner calling it the worst shelling he had endured. At German troops were seen massing for a counter-attack and managed to advance through a British protective artillery barrage, to engage the British infantry in a bombing fight. The German attack took part of the east end of the wood but the exhaustion of the 5th Division, which had been reduced to a &quot;pitiable state&quot;, required reinforcement by three battalions, mainly from the 12th Division, from 

On 30 July, British artillery-fire caused many casualties and the right flank of the 5th Division was hurriedly reinforced by I Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 163 of the 17th Reserve Division, sent from Ytres, which was spotted by British aircrews at Beaulencourt and shelled. During the night II Battalion, Infantry Regiment 23 of the 12th Division was relieved by the I Battalion. On 4 August, a British attack began as the Fusilier Battalion of Grenadier Regiment 12 was being relieved by I Battalion, Infantry Regiment 121 of the 26th Division, which was taking over from the 5th Division, Grenadier Regiment 119 coming into line to the east. A general relief of the German troops on the Somme front was conducted, as the British artillery kept up a steady bombardment of Delville Wood and German observation balloons began to operate between Ginchy and the wood.

On 18 August, Infantry Regiment 125 of the 27th Division was surprised by an attack from the east end of Delville Wood, after its trenches were almost obliterated by British artillery. The British infantry arrived as soon as the barrage lifted and Grenadier Regiment 119 to the north was almost rolled up from its left flank but two companies of III Battalion counter-attacked through I Battalion, which had lost too many men to participate. At the north-west side of the wood, Infantry Regiment 121 of the 26th Division found that the British artillery had made Orchard Trench almost untenable. II Battalion had to advance through the shell-fire and dig a new line behind Orchard Trench, to maintain touch with the flanks, before being relieved by I Battalion overnight. The trench was occupied by Infantry Regiment 104 of the 40th Division, from North Street to the west and by Infantry Regiment 121 north of Longueval, which repulsed an attack on 21 August.

Another British attack came on 24 August, as Infantry Regiment 88 from the 56th Division began to relieve Infantry Regiment 121 and Grenadier Regiment 119. Every man left in the regiment was needed to withstand the attack, which caused the loss of more than and twelve machine-guns. After the attack, Fusilier Regiment 35 of the 56th Division relieved Infantry Regiment 125, which called the days on the Somme &quot;the worst in the war&quot;. II Battalion, Infantry Regiment 181 was sent as reinforcements and one of its companies was annihilated. An attempted counter-attack by the battalion and part of Infantry Regiment 104, was smashed by British artillery-fire and a German counter-bombardment hampered British consolidation. On 27 August, the German garrison in Edge Trench, the last foothold in Delville Wood, was driven out and Infantry Regiment 118 lost A counter-attack to recover the wood was made possible by the arrival of a wave of fresh German divisions on the Somme and in late August, German artillery preparation began for an attack on 31 August.

The 4th Bavarian and 56th divisions were to make a pincer attack at on the east and north sides of the wood, with I Battalion, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 5, III Battalion, Fusilier Regiment 35 and II Battalion, Infantry Regiment 88. Each battalion attacked with two companies forward and two in support. Battalion 3 was one of the first to be trained and equipped as a specialist assault unit; training had begun in mid-June, after large numbers of unfit men had been transferred to other units. Fitness training and familiarisation with light mortars and flame-throwers had been provided and the unit arrived on the Somme on 20 August. Parts of the unit began demonstrations and training courses in the new tactics and the 1st and 2nd companies were attached to the Bavarian and Fusilier battalions, which were to retake Delville Wood. The attack began after a bombardment from which had little effect on the British defences.

At the east end of the wood, Fusilier Regiment 35 attacked with the support of flame-thrower detachments but the mud was so bad that six became unusable, the artillery preparation was inadequate and the first two attacks failed. The third attempt, after a more extensive bombardment, was called &quot;a wonderful victory&quot;. The attack from the north came from three companies of Infantry Regiment 88 and either side of Tea Lane. British return fire caused many casualties and forced the attackers to move from shell-hole to shell-hole, eventually being pinned down in no man&#x27;s land. The survivors withdrew after dark, rallying at Flers. I Battalion, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 5, with a company of Battalion 3, attached flame-thrower and bombing detachments, attacked eastwards towards the 56th Division, along Tea and Orchard trenches, where a bomber killed a British machine-gun crew, by throwing a grenade . A second artillery bombardment was fired at and the managed to take and gain a foothold. The position in the wood was abandoned by the , because the repulse of the 56th Division units, left them isolated and under increasing artillery-fire.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===

Lukin had wanted to defend Delville Wood with machine-guns and small detachments of infantry but prompt German counter-attacks prevented this; Tanner had needed every man for the defence. The British had eventually secured Longueval and Delville Wood in time for the formations to their north to advance and capture High Wood ready for the Flers–Courcelette and the later Somme battles. Over the southern part of the British front, there had been casualties for a small &quot;tongue&quot; of ground a few miles deep. The Allies and Germans suffered many casualties in continuous piecemeal attacks and counter-attacks. Gallwitz recorded that from guns of the the Somme had been destroyed, captured or made unserviceable, along with the guns.

In 2005, Prior and Wilson wrote that an obvious British remedy to the salient at Delville Wood was to move the right flank forward, yet only twenty attacks were made in this area, against the wood and to the left. The writers held that British commanders had failed to command and had neglected the troops who were frittered away, such that the attrition of British forces was worse than the effect on the Germans. It was speculated that this was perhaps a consequence of the inexperience of Haig and Rawlinson in handling forces vastly larger than the British peacetime army. Prior and Wilson also wrote that divisions engaged divisions, most of which suffered casualties greater than to the fired by the British from September, despite shell-shortages and problems in transporting ammunition when rain had soaked the ground. German failings were also evident, particularly in counter-attacking to regain all lost ground, even when of little tactical value, which demonstrated that commanders on both sides had failed to control the battle.

In 2009, J. P. Harris wrote that during the seven weeks&#x27; battle for control of Delville Wood, the infantry on both sides endured what appeared to be a bloody and frustrating stalemate, which was even worse for the Germans. The greater amount of British artillery and ammunition was directed by RFC artillery-observers in aircraft and balloons, which increased the accuracy of fire despite the frequent rain and mist. German counter-attacks were tactically unwise and exposed German infantry to British fire power regardless of the value of the ground being attacked. In the Fourth Army sector, the Germans counter-attacked seventy times from September against ninety British attacks, many of them near Delville Wood. The British superiority in artillery was often enough to make costly failures of the German efforts and since German troops were relieved less frequently, the constant British bombardments and loss of initiative depressed German morale.

By the end of July, the German defence north of the Somme had reached a point of almost permanent collapse; on 23 July, the defence of Guillemont, Delville Wood and Longueval almost failed and from 27 to 28 July, contact with the defenders of the wood was lost; on 30 July another crisis occurred between Guillemont and Longueval. Inside the flanks of the German first position, troops occupied shell-holes to evade bombardment by the British artillery, which vastly increased the strain on the health and morale of the troops, isolated them from command, made it difficult to provide supplies and to remove wounded. Corpses strewed the landscape, fouled the air and reduced men&#x27;s appetites even when cooked food could be brought from the rear; troops in the most advanced positions lived on tinned food and went thirsty. From 15 to 27 July, the 7th and 8th divisions of IV Corps, from Delville Wood to Bazentin le Petit suffered 

The Battle for Longueval and Delville Wood had started with a charge by the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division between Longueval and High Wood and two weeks after the wood was cleared, tanks went into action for the first time. A number of important tactical lessons were learned from the battle for the village and wood. Night assembly and advances, dawn attacks after short, concentrated artillery barrages for tactical surprise and building defensive lines on the fringes of wooded areas, to avoid tree roots in preventing digging and to keep clear of shells which were detonated by branches, showering troops with wood splinters. Troops were relieved after two days, as longer periods exhausted them and consumed their ammunition, bombs and rations. The persistence of the British attacks during July and August helped to preserve Franco-British relations, although Joffre criticised the large number of small attacks on 11 August and tried to cajole Haig into agreeing to a big combined attack. On 18 August, a larger British attack by three corps was spoilt by several days of heavy rain, which reduced artillery observation and no ground was gained at Delville Wood.

===Casualties===

Another forty-two German divisions fought on the Somme front in July and by the end of the month German losses had increased to men; the number of Anglo-French casualties was more than The battle for Delville Wood was costly for both sides and the 9th (Scottish) Division had from 1 to 20 July, of which the 1st (South African) Infantry Brigade lost . From the 3rd Division had The 5th Division lost from and the 17th Division had from The 8th Division lost from The 14th Division lost and the 33rd Division lost in August and from the end of August to 5 September, the 24th Division had 

Details of German losses are incomplete, particularly for Prussian divisions, due to the loss of records to Allied bombing in the Second World War. From the 7th and 8th divisions of IV Corps held the line from Delville Wood to Bazentin le Petit and suffered The 5th Division was not relieved from Delville Wood until 3 August and lost a greater loss than at Verdun in May. Infantry Regiment 26, which had been at full strength on 13 July was reduced on 20 July. The British official historian, Wilfrid Miles, wrote that many German divisions returned from a period on the Somme having suffered more than Bavarian Infantry Regiment 5 of the 4th Bavarian Division recorded &quot;the loss of many good, irreplaceable men&quot;.

===Subsequent operations===
The Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September) was the third British general offensive during the Battle of the Somme and continued the advance from Delville Wood and Longueval. The battle was notable for the first use of tanks and the capture of the villages of Courcelette, Martinpuich and Flers. In the XV Corps area, the 14th (Light) Division on the right advanced to the area of Bull&#x27;s Road between Flers and Lesbœufs, in the centre the 41st Division, the newest division in the BEF, captured Flers with the help of tank D-17 and the New Zealand Division, between Delville Wood and High Wood on the left, took the Switch Line, linking with the 41st Division in Flers, after two tanks arrived and the German defenders were overrun. The Fourth Army made a substantial advance of but failed to reach the final objectives.

The Allies held the Wood until 24 March 1918, when the 47th Division received orders to retire with the rest of V Corps, after German troops broke through the junction of V Corps and VII Corps. British and German soldiers sometimes found themselves marching parallel, as the British troops fell back and formed a new line facing south between High Wood and Bazentin le Grand. On 29 August 1918, the 38th (Welsh) Division attacked at to take the high ground east of Ginchy and then capture Delville Wood and Longueval from the south. The 113th Brigade was virtually unopposed and reached the objective by and the 115th Brigade advanced north of the wood, which was mopped up by the 114th Brigade. Later in the day, the advance reached the vicinity of Morval. The Armistice with Germany ended hostilities three months later.

<doc id="1254860" wikidata="Q1351825" url="?curid=1254860" title="Mode 7">
<text>Mode 7 is a graphics mode on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console that allows a background layer to be rotated and scaled on a scanline-by-scanline basis to create many different depth effects. It also supports wrapping effects such as translation and reflection.

The most famous of these effects is the application of a perspective effect on a background layer by scaling and rotating the background layer in this manner. This transforms the background layer into a two-dimensional horizontal texture-mapped plane that trades height for depth. Thus, an impression of three-dimensional graphics is achieved.

Mode 7 was one of Nintendo&#x27;s prominent selling points for the Super NES platform in publications such as &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and &quot;Super NES Player&#x27;s Guide&quot;. Similar &quot;&quot; 3D techniques have been presented on a few 2D systems other than the Super NES, in select peripherals and games.

==Overview==

The Super NES console has eight graphics modes, numbered from 0 to 7, for displaying background layers. The last one (background mode 7) has a single layer that can be scaled and rotated. Two-dimensional affine transformations can produce any combination of translation, scaling, reflection, rotation, and shearing. However, many games create additional effects by setting a different transformation matrix for each scanline. In this way, pseudo-perspective, curved surface, and distortion effects can be achieved.

Mode 7 graphics are generated for each pixel by mapping screen coordinates to background coordinates using an affine transformation and sampling the corresponding background color. The 2D affine transformation is specified for each scanline by 6 parameters: formula_1, formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4 ( which together define the matrix formula_5), and formula_6 and formula_7 (which define the vector formula_8, the origin). Specifically, screen coordinate formula_9 is translated to the origin coordinate system, the matrix is applied, and the result is translated back to the original coordinate system to obtain formula_10.

In 2D matrix notation:

formula_11

formula_12.

All arithmetic is carried out on 16-bit signed fixed point numbers, while all offsets are limited to 13 bits. The radix point is between bits 7 and 8.

== Usage in games ==
This graphical method is suited to racing games, and is used extensively for the overworld sections of role-playing games such as Square&#x27;s popular 1994 game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. The effect enables developers to create the impression of sprawling worlds that continue toward the horizon.

A particular utilization technique with Mode 7 allows pixels of the background layer to be in front of sprites. Examples include the second and fifth stage of &quot;Contra III: The Alien Wars&quot;, the second and fifth stage of &quot;Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D&quot;, the introduction screen of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose&quot;, when a player falls off the stage in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, some cinematics in &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, and in some boss battles in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;.

Mode 7-type effects can be implemented on the Super NES without the hardware acceleration of Mode 7, such as &quot;Axelay&quot; rolling pin vertical scrolling; and then it uses Mode 7 in one boss and in the end credits sequence.

Many Mode 7 games were remade for Game Boy Advance using effects implemented by software.

The Sega Genesis has no hardware-native feature comparable to Mode 7. However, as in &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; and &quot;Star Ocean&quot;″s sprite effect add-ins, some comparable technical feats were programmed entirely in software, as in &quot;Dick Vitale&#x27;s &quot;Awesome, Baby!&quot; College Hoops&quot; and &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot;. The Sega CD, an add-on for the Genesis, added scaling and rotation support on hardware level, as used by &quot;Sonic CD&quot; and &quot;Formula One World Championship: Beyond the Limit&quot;. Similarly, such Amiga games include &quot;Mr. Nutz: Hoppin&#x27; Mad&quot;, &quot;Lionheart&quot;, &quot;Obitus&quot;, and &quot;Brian the Lion&quot;.

Filip Hautekeete and Peter Vermeulen created a demo showcasing an emulated interpretation of the Mode 7 graphics mode found in the Super NES to test the hardware capabilities of the Atari Jaguar. Impressed with the demo, Atari Corporation decided to make a game that combined &quot;F-Zero&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; with a &quot;cutesy&quot; atmosphere, becoming the starting point of &quot;Atari Karts&quot;.

<text>The Sharp are a Melbourne four-piece pop, rockabilly band which formed in 1991 with Allan Catlin on double bass and lead vocals, Piet Collins on drums and Charlie Rooke on guitar and lead vocals. They issued two studio albums, &quot;This Is the Sharp&quot; (1993) and &quot;Sonic Tripod&quot; (1994). Their highest-charting single, &quot;Alone Like Me&quot; (1994), reached the ARIA Singles Chart top 20.

== History ==
===1991–1992: Formation and &quot;Spinosity&quot;===
In 1991 the Sharp were formed as a three-piece rockabilly, pop group in the Melbourne suburb of Collingwood by Allan Catlin on double bass and lead vocals, Piet Collins on drums and Charlie Rooke on guitar and lead vocals. Rooke had formed 59 Sharp, a &quot;good-time bar-band&quot;, in 1988; he was later joined by Catlin, and alternating drummers Danny Simcic (also a member of Real Life, a new wave-synth pop band) and Tony Day (Broderick Smith Band). They &quot;played 1950s rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll and rockabilly covers to a hardcore Melbourne following.&quot;

Piet Collins, who was writing &quot;Neighbours&quot; episodes at the time, joined on drums in 1991 due to other commitments for both Day and Simcic. The group were renamed as the Sharp, which according to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane &quot;Boasting double bass, stand-up drums, rockabilly-tinged guitar licks and musicians dressed in all black... [they] presented a united front and an interesting twist on 1990s pop... [their] aesthetic push incorporated frisky pop melodies, tight arrangements, strong harmonies and grungy guitar riffs.&quot; For the Sharp, Catlin and Rooke wrote original tracks, both individually and jointly. The group acknowledged the influence of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Easybeats.

In June 1992 they issued their debut CD three-track single &quot;Love Your Head&quot;, on Mushroom Distribution Services. It was produced by Nick Mainsbridge (The Triffids, Tall Tales and True, Ratcat). They were signed to East West Music/Warner Music Australasia later that year. Their first hit single, &quot;Talking Sly&quot; (from the &quot;Spinosity&quot; EP), was written and sung jointly by Rooke and Catlin, which &quot;received plenty of radio support and high critical acclaim.&quot; The associated EP reached the ARIA Singles Chart top 30.

===1993: &quot;This Is the Sharp&quot;===
In May 1993, the band released &quot;Train of Thought&quot;, the lead single from their debut studio album. It was co-produced by Mainsbridge with Peter Farnan (of Boom Crash Opera).

The Sharp released their debut album, &quot;This Is the Sharp&quot;, in September 1993, which was co-produced by Farnan, Mainsbridge and the group. It peaked at No. 13 on the ARIA Albums Chart. They promoted the album with an Australian tour as a support act for United States group, Spin Doctors. At the ARIA Awards of 1993 the Sharp received two nominations for &quot;Talking Sly&quot;, ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist – Single and Best Video (directed by Chris Langman).

Further singles reached the top 50 of the ARIA Singles Chart including &quot;Scratch My Back&quot; and &quot;Yeah I Want You&quot;. The latter had four cover versions of work by The Cure (&quot;The Love Cats&quot;), Blondie (&quot;Hangin&#x27; on the Telephone&quot;), Lou Reed (&quot;Vicious&quot;) and The Violent Femmes (&quot;Add It Up&quot;). Collins explained &quot;We&#x27;ve been playing these songs in our live set on and off for the past two years and we&#x27;ve created our own versions of them.&quot;

The Sharp were parodied in the second season of the ABC&#x27;s sketch comedy series &quot;The Late Show&quot; in 1993. Jason Stephens, Rob Sitch, and Santo Cilauro portrayed The Sharp in &quot;Skivvies are Back,&quot; a parody of the music video for the band&#x27;s song &quot;Scratch My Back.&quot; This sketch can be found in the VHS release &quot;The Best Bits of The Late Show Volume 3&quot; and the DVD release &quot;The Best Bits of the Late Show: Champagne Edition.&quot;

===1994–1995: &quot;Sonic Tripod&quot;===
A world tour followed in 1994 across the US, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Germany. At the 1994 ARIA Awards they received two further nominations, ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist – Album for &quot;This Is the Sharp&quot; and ARIA Award for Engineer of the Year for its tracks, &quot;Scratch My Back&quot;, &quot;Yeah I Want You&quot; and &quot;Train of Thought&quot; by Mainsbridge and Kalju Tonuma.

In August 1994, the bands&#x27;s second album &quot;Sonic Tripod&quot;, was released. It also reached No. 13 and was co-produced by Farnan, Mainsbridge and the group. Jacqueline Fuller of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; felt it was &quot;a foray into the new lyrical themes of social comment and psychological turmoil rather than The Sharp&#x27;s typical love and party songs.&quot; It provided their highest-charting single &quot;Alone Like Me&quot;, which peaked at No. 20. The group were known for their image of black high neck skivvies, and energetic live shows, including Catlin balancing on his double bass while playing, and Rooke leaping off the drum kit mid-guitar solo.

Early in 1995 Adam May replaced Collins on drums, however in August the group announced their proposed disbandment due to burn out. Rooke explained to Liz Armitage of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; in that month how the Sharp had decided to break up: &quot;It was a round-table discussion. A lot of people like to think there was (a conflict) but there wasn&#x27;t, otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t be doing a tour.&quot; Rooke reflected on their legacy &quot;I think people will remember us for being a bit different... I&#x27;m sticking with the simplicity... I seemed to go for that vibe in the first, and I&#x27;ve always believed in it. I think you can do so much with that approach, but most groups these days are into bigger production.&quot; According to Armitage &quot;Both Catlin and Rooke are expected to release something (separately) at the start of next year.&quot;

A compilation album, &quot;Single File (The Best of the Sharp)&quot;, was released in September. They performed their last gig on 22 October 1995 at the Hallam Hotel.

===1996–present ===
A posthumous collection of previously unreleased studio tracks, &quot;Skeletons in the Closet&quot;, was released in 1996.

Catlin formed a group, the Rush Effect, and wrote music for ads; Collins took up a career in journalism and writing; Rooke formed a group, Earlobe. Rooke was later a studio session guitarist for Cezary Skubiszewski.

In 2000 the Sharp performed a reunion gig in Melbourne, and in July 2010 they reunited for a series of shows playing in Melbourne and Adelaide.

On 4th March 2024, The Sharp announced via their Facebook page that they would be reuniting without Catlin. Joining Charlie and Piet on double bass is The Living Ends&#x27; Scott Owen and vocalist Louie Lee Feltrin. They intend on touring the band&#x27;s &quot;This Is the Sharp&quot; album in its entirety.

<text>Yosef Mendelevitch (or Mendelovitch) (; born 1947 in Riga) is a refusenik from the former Soviet Union, also known as a &quot;Prisoner of Zion&quot; and now a politically unaffiliated rabbi living in Jerusalem who gained fame for his adherence to Judaism and public attempts to emigrate to Israel at a time when it was against the law in the USSR.

==Biography==
Mendelevich was born in Riga and started his Jewish activities in the 1960s. He formed a student group of underground Jewish Education in 1966 and became an editor of an underground newsletter Iton on Jewish issues in 1969. Being repeatably refused the right to immigration, he became one of the leaders of the Dymshits–Kuznetsov hijacking affair, recounted in his 2012 memoir, &quot;Unbroken Spirit&quot;. As punishment, he was imprisoned for eleven years. During the imprisonment he was punished for keeping Jewish precepts. In 1981, after a worldwide struggle, he was released and immigrated to Israel.

He served in Soviet prisons with famous Jewish dissident Natan Sharansky (amongst others). In Sharansky&#x27;s memoir &quot;Fear No Evil&quot; he describes innovative ways Mendelevitch used to communicate with Sharansky, such as through both toilet bowls and radiators.

Mendelevitch had always exhibited leadership qualities. Early on in Israel he headed an organization called Soviet Jewry Information Center and has managed to attract followers to his causes. This has been attested to by his fellow refuseniks, such as Natan Sharansky: &quot;In May 1988 he [Sharansky] founded the Zionist Forum, in preparation for the future waves of Aliyah from the Soviet Union, and based its activity on the database formed by former Refusenik Yosef Mendelevitch.&quot;

He was known as a &quot;Prisoner of Zion.&quot; Since moving to Israel he adopted Orthodox Judaism and has become a rabbi affiliated with the Religious Zionist movement. He studied at Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav and was ordained as a rabbi by Rabbi Avraham Shapira and Rabbi She&#x27;ar Yashuv Cohen.

Mendelevitch has been a political activist from his days in the former USSR. When he moved to Israel, he became a globetrotting speaker on behalf of various causes, such as lobbying for the release of convicted spy Jonathan Pollard in the USA.

In his autobiography, written in Hebrew, &quot;מבצע חתונה אסיר ציון&quot; he describes his struggle as a &quot;Prisoner of Zion.&quot;

Mendelevitch has become a popular speaker in various Jewish communities and has spoken out on controversial issues relating to Israel and the former Soviet Union. He has constantly involved himself in political and international affairs, Russia&#x27;s support for Arab states, and the Arab–Israeli conflict, such as when he spoke out against a 1991 state visit by Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh&#x27;s visit to Israel:

:&quot;Jews who spent years in Soviet prisons were far less enthusiastic than most Israelis about Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh&#x27;s historic visit here Friday. ... &#x27;It&#x27;s nothing but a bad dream,&#x27; said Yosef Mendelevitch, another former Soviet prisoner, commenting on Bessmertnykh&#x27;s visit, the first by a Soviet foreign minister to Israel. Mendelevitch spent about a decade in Soviet prisons on charges of attempting to hijack an airplane to Israel. He was freed and permitted to emigrate in 1981. He told Israel radio that he still distrusts the Soviets because of Moscow&#x27;s alliance with Arab states. &#x27;We should remember that a lot of the blood spilled here in the last 40 years was with Soviet weapons,&#x27; he added. Sharansky and Mendelevitch also criticized the Soviet leader for hinting Thursday in Amman that the tide of Soviet immigrants to Israel could be halted unless Israel stops building Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.&quot;

There have been many articles, books and documentaries about his life.

<doc id="1254871" wikidata="Q5014341" url="?curid=1254871" title="CSS Robert E. Lee">
<text>CSS &quot;Robert E. Lee was a fast [[paddle-steamer]], originally built as a [[Glasgow]]-[[Belfast]] [[packet boat]] named &quot;Giraffe&quot;, which was bought as a [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runner]] for the [[Confederate States]] during the [[American Civil War]], then subsequently served in the [[United States Navy]] asUSS &quot;Fort Donelson and in the Chilean Navy as Concepción.
==CSS &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot;==
&quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; was originally the merchant ship &quot;Giraffe&quot;, a schooner-rigged, iron-hulled, oscillating-engined paddle-steamer with two stacks, built by J&amp;G Thomson&#x27;s Clyde Bank Iron Shipyard at Govan in Glasgow, Scotland, and launched on 16 May 1860 as a fast Glasgow-Belfast packet for the J. &amp; G. Burns Line.

Alexander Collie &amp; Co. of Manchester acquired her for their blockade-running fleet, but were persuaded by renowned blockade-runner Lieutenant John Wilkinson (CSN) to sell her to the Confederate States Navy for the same £32,000 just paid.

Her first voyage for the Confederacy was into Old Inlet, Wilmington, North Carolina in January 1863 with valuable munitions and 26 Scottish lithographers, eagerly awaited by the Confederate Government bureau of engraving and printing. On January 26, Union intelligence maintained she &quot;could be captured easily&quot; at anchor in Ossabaw Sound, but this was not to be for another 10 months. Running out again, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; started to establish a near-legendary reputation for blockade running by leaving astern blockader .

Lieutenant Richard H. Gayle, CSN, assumed command in May 1863, relieving Lieutenant John Wilkinson; but Wilkinson was conning the ship again out of the Cape Fear River from Smithville, North Carolina on October 7, 1863, as recounted by Lieutenant Robert D. Minor, CSN, in a letter to Admiral Franklin Buchanan dated February 2, 1864, detailing the first venture to capture and liberate 2,000 Confederate prisoners at Johnson&#x27;s Island, Sandusky, Ohio. &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; transported Wilkinson, Minor, Lieutenant Benjamin P. Loyall and 19 other naval officers to Halifax, Nova Scotia with $35,000 in gold and a cotton cargo &quot;subsequently sold at Halifax for $76,000 (gold) by the War Department — in all some $111,000 in gold, as the sinews of the expedition.&quot;

Thus Wilkinson was in Canada and Gayle commanding when &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; luck ran out on November 9, 1863, after 21 voyages in 10 months carrying out over 7,000 bales of cotton, returning with munitions invaluable to the Confederacy. She left Bermuda five hours after her consort, CSS &quot;Cornubia&quot;, only to be run down a few hours after her by the same blockader, . The two runners were conceded to be easily &quot;the most noted that ply between Bermuda and Wilmington.&quot;

This ship was not the one immortalised in the American popular song Waiting for the Robert E. Lee (1912), which was based on a later Mississippi steamer of the same name.

==USS &quot;Fort Donelson&quot;==
&quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; was condemned as a prize at Boston, Massachusetts, acquired by the United States Navy and placed in commission on June 29, 1864, as USS &quot;Fort Donelson&quot;, with Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Thomas Pickering in command.

&quot;Fort Donelson&quot; was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, cruising in blockade of the North Carolina coast through the remainder of 1864 with brief periods of repair at Norfolk, Virginia. From January 13 to January 22, 1865, she aided in the bombardment of Fort Fisher&#x27;s batteries and landed ammunition supplies for the Union forces. &quot;Fort Donelson&quot; joined the fleet in attacking Fort Anderson on February 17–February 18. During March she cruised in company with to Bermuda, was present at City Point, Virginia when U.S. President Abraham Lincoln arrived on board &quot;River Queen&quot; on March 20, and acted as guardship at Fort Fisher. She operated with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron until June, but when ordered to the West Gulf squadron was found to be in such poor condition that she returned to Norfolk.

&quot;Fort Donelson&quot; was decommissioned on August 17, 1865, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and sold in October 1865. She subsequently returned to civilian employment under the name &quot;Isabella&quot;.

==&quot;Concepción&quot;==
In 1866 the ship was purchased for $85,000 (~$ in ) by the Chilean Navy and commissioned as &quot;Concepción&quot;, arriving at Valparaíso on August 22. On September 3, as the Spanish fleet had left the Pacific, after the Chincha Islands War of Chile-Perú against Spain. Commander Galvarino Riveros Cárdenas was placed in command of &quot;Concepción&quot;, which saw service in southern Chile. The Chilean Navy sold &quot;Concepción&quot; on May 1, 1868; her subsequent history is unknown.

<text>Wayne Kenneth Wettlaufer (16 December 1943 – 21 June 2015) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003. In 2014 he was elected as a regional councillor for Kitchener and he served in that position until his death in 2015.

==Background==
Wettlaufer obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Guelph. He worked as an insurance manager for K.W. Insurance in 1963, and as an insurance inspector for Waterloo Mutual and Gore Mutual, Ottawa in 1972. He was promoted to corporate marketing manager with Gore Mutual, Cambridge in 1980, and became a partner in the firm of &quot;Wettlaufer, Collins, Rankin Insurance Brokers&quot; in 1984. He remained a member of this firm until winning political office in 1995.

==Politics==
Wettlaufer was elected to the Ontario legislature for the riding of Kitchener in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal candidate Bryan Stortz by over 3,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in this election and Wettlaufer served as a backbench supporter of the Mike Harris government.

In 1996, the Harris government reduced the number of ridings from 130 to 103. This change meant that sitting MPPs had to compete against one another for re-nomination in some ridings. Wettlaufer ran for the Kitchener Centre PC nomination in 1999 defeating fellow PC member Gary Leadston. Wettlaufer was re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Berry Vrbanovic by over 4,000 votes in the redistributed riding of Kitchener Centre. He was appointed to the position of deputy whip after the election, and continued in his role as a backbencher throughout his time in the legislature.

As a backbencher, he passed a Private Member&#x27;s Bill designating the day after Thanksgiving in each year as German Pioneers Day in Ontario. In the provincial election of 2003, Wettlaufer lost to Liberal candidate John Milloy by just over 2,000 votes.

Wettlaufer endorsed Frank Klees for the leadership of the Ontario PC Party in 2004 and 2009. In 2005, he vied for the PC nomination in the Federal riding of Kitchener-Conestoga. He lost to Harold Albrecht who went on to win the contest in the Canadian election of 2006.

In 2012, as president of the Ontario chapter of the German-Canadian Congress, Wettlaufer defended accused war criminal Helmut Oberlander who was stripped of his Canadian citizenship. Wettlaufer said, &quot;The court case did not prove beyond a doubt that he was a war criminal.&quot; On 3 July 2013, Wettlaufer stirred controversy with a tweet, later deleted, that claimed female electors vote for the Liberal Party because they &quot;get all their information from the Toronto Star&quot; and are &quot;less informed&quot;.

He was a candidate in the provincial election of 2014 in his old riding of Kitchener Centre. During the election campaign Wettlaufer contradicted his party platform during an all candidate debate when he said that public sector jobs would be cut entirely through attrition. He was defeated by Liberal candidate Daiene Vernile by 6,922 votes.

He was elected as a regional councillor for Kitchener in the 2014 election but served less than a year before his death on 21 June 2015.

<text>Night of the Living Dead (also known as George A. Romero&#x27;s Night of the Living Dead) is a 1990 American horror film directed by Tom Savini (in his feature directorial debut) and starring Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman. It is a remake of George A. Romero&#x27;s 1968 film of the same title; Romero rewrote the original 1968 screenplay he had originally co-authored with John A. Russo.

Like the original, the film follows seven strangers as they meet and survive in a rural farmhouse, following the awakening of cannibalistic zombies. It is the only &quot;official&quot; remake of the 1968 film, with other &quot;unofficial&quot; remakes coming out after, as a result of the source material&#x27;s lack of copyright ownership (resulting in being in the public domain).

&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; was released by Columbia Pictures in the United States on October 19, 1990. The film received negative reviews upon initial release and grossed $5.8 million against a $4.2 million budget. Modern reviews have been more positive.

== Plot ==
One idyllic August afternoon, siblings Barbara and Johnny visit their mother&#x27;s grave in a remote cemetery in rural Pennsylvania. An elderly man with blood on his forehead bumps into them there, garbles an apology and bolts in terror. While offering to help him, they are attacked by a zombie. Johnny is killed while Barbara desperately flees the cemetery and discovers what appears to be an abandoned farm house. She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shaken and disturbed she tries to ward them off. Shortly after, a man named Ben (who fled Evans City) arrives and helps Barbara dispatch the zombies. The two quickly form a bond and clear the house of the undead and begin barricading the doors and windows as night falls.

They soon discover other survivors holed up in the cellar: a man named Harry Cooper; his wife Helen; their daughter Sarah, who was bitten by a zombie and has fallen seriously ill; and teenage lovers Tom Bitner and Judy Rose Larson. The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry insists that everyone retreats to the cellar and hunker down to wait for the authorities. Ben disagrees believing that the cellar is a &quot;death trap&quot; and they would be better off fortifying the house and fending off the horde. Noticing the zombies&#x27; limited mobility, Barbara suggests that they leave the house on foot. The discussion quickly turns hostile as tensions flare between Ben and Harry. A scuffle ensues that leaves the Coopers in the basement to tend to Sarah, while the other survivors continue reinforcing the doors and windows upstairs. The loud construction attracts a mob of zombies to the farmhouse. It doesn&#x27;t take long for the infected to hem in, leaving the ragtag group trapped with nowhere to go.

The group devises a plan to escape using Ben&#x27;s truck, which is out of fuel, by refueling at a locked gas pump nearby. They find a set of keys in Uncle Rege&#x27;s corpse (the farm&#x27;s owner) and proceed to drive up the hill toward the gas pump, but their plan begins to unravel when Ben falls from the bed of the truck and is left to defend himself. To their horror, the key to the gas pump is not among the set they brought with them. Realizing they are out of time, Tom shoots the lock off, causing gasoline to ignite a burning torch in the cargo bed. The truck and gas pump explode, killing both Tom and Judy.

Ben has no choice but to make his way back, only to find things beginning to dissolve into chaos. Harry has wrestled Barbara&#x27;s gun away from her and is now armed while the horde has burst their way in. The house is now completely overrun with the exits blocked off and the barricades torn down. 

Unbeknownst to the survivors upstairs, Sarah has succumbed to the bite on her arm and has transformed into a zombie; she attacks and bites her distraught mother. When Sarah makes her way upstairs, she triggers a shootout between her father, who is trying to protect her, and Ben and Barbara, who are trying to protect themselves. Both Ben and Harry are badly wounded, and Barbara shoots Sarah. Harry retreats upstairs to the attic, while Ben staggers down to the cellar, where he shoots a reanimated Helen. Ben gradually goes into shock, and after realizing the gas pump key has been in the cellar the entire time, he laughs mindlessly at the irony before dying from his injuries.

Meanwhile, Barbara leaves the farm house alone and attempts to find help. She eventually joins a group of countryside locals who are clearing the area of the undead, and awakens the next day in a makeshift camp surrounded by the safety of the media and townspeople, led by Sheriff McClelland. Noticing a group of hillbillies drunkenly antagonizing a small group of captured zombies, she comments on the similarities between the living and the undead (apparently suggesting that we are no better than these ravenous cannibals). She returns to the farmhouse to find Ben, who is now zombified; he gazes at Barbara before being shot. When Harry emerges from the attic alive, Barbara kills him in a fit of rage and retribution for causing Ben&#x27;s death, and turns to leave the house, telling the vigilantes they have &quot;another one for the fire.&quot; Barbara watches grimly as the bodies are burned on a pyre.

== Production ==
&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968) director and co-writer George A. Romero said that the remake came about in part because of issues over profits of the original film. A lengthy court battle over the rights to the film, plus an oversight that caused the copyright notice not to be included, caused Romero to see little in the way of profit. Romero&#x27;s production company, Image Ten, eventually won the lawsuit, but the distributor went out of business before they could collect any money. Another issue was the fact that the filmmakers were worried that someone else might make an unauthorized remake. Romero contacted Menahem Golan when he heard that 21st Century Film Corporation was interested in a remake, and Romero, John A. Russo, and Russell Streiner collaborated for the first time in 20 years. Tom Savini was initially hired to perform the special effects, but was persuaded to direct by Romero. Savini was drawn to the remake because he was unavailable to do special effects on the original.

The special effects team intentionally kept the effects restrained, as they felt that excessive gore would be disrespectful to the original film. To keep the effects realistic, they used as inspiration a real autopsy, forensic pathology textbooks, and Nazi death camp footage. Savini said that he wanted to keep the film artistic despite his reputation as &quot;the king of splatter&quot;. The zombie extras were recruited easily, as the film&#x27;s reputation drew them from as far away as Kentucky.

The production was not easy for Savini, who described it as &quot;the worst nightmare of my life&quot;. Savini said that only 40% of his ideas made it into the final film. Without Romero on set, he clashed with the producers, who did not allow him to explore his vision for the film.

== Release ==
To avoid an X rating, Savini had to cut several scenes from the film. Savini attributed the film&#x27;s lack of popularity among horror fans to these cuts. A Blu-ray version was released in a limited edition of 3,000 on October 9, 2012, by Twilight Time. Australian film distributor Umbrella Entertainment released a special edition of the film featuring a restored print, alongside the 1968 original on Blu-ray on April 6, 2016.

== Reception ==
===Contemporary===
The initial response and critical consensus among both audience members and critics was generally negative.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated it D+ and wrote, &quot;In the history of bad ideas, George Romero&#x27;s decision to produce a color remake of his disturbingly frenzied 1968 zombiefest &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; has to rank right up there with New Coke...The original &quot;Night&quot; was taken by some to be a statement about the Vietnam War; this one isn’t about anything larger than Romero’s desire to make a buck.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert awarded the film one star out of a possible four, writing, &quot;The remake is so close to the original that there is no reason to see both&quot;. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;There was no real need to remake a film that lives on the campy cult appeal it has acquired over time. But as B-movies and remakes go, this one knows how to bring tired zombies back to life.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a crass bit of cinematic grave-robbing&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;While this &quot;Night&quot; hasn&#x27;t the chilling, almost cinema-verite credibility of the original, it is certainly a well-sustained entertainment&quot;. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Richard Harrington criticized the film as a purely financial effort that lacks the shock of the original film now that zombie film tropes have become clichéd. Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; rated it three out of four stars and wrote that although Savini&#x27;s direction is a bit too literal, the film &quot;contains some intriguing further development of the ideas of the first film, as well as some mistakes corrected and dramatic relationships tightened.&quot;

===Retrospective===
Modern criticism has been more appreciative. As of 2023, Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 68% of 34 critics have given the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.3/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; doesn&#x27;t quite reinvent the original&#x27;s narrative, but its sleek action and amplified gore turn it into a worthy horror showcase.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 54 out of 100 based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating mixed to average reviews. Bloody Disgusting rated it four-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote, &quot;This film works on so many levels. Normally, remakes are horrible, and diverge so much from the original film. This one is so close to the original it&#x27;s scary.&quot; Reviewing the Twilight Time Blu-ray, Adam Tyner of DVD Talk rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, &quot;We&#x27;ll never get a chance to see the remake that Tom Savini set out to direct. Still, despite the many missteps of this severely compromised version, &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; manages to distinguish itself as one of the more effective horror remakes out there.&quot; Reviewing the same disc at DVD Verdict, Patrick Naugle rated it 83 out of 100 and called it &quot;one of the superior zombies movies available&quot;. In a retrospective at PopMatters, academic Cynthia Freeland compared the racial politics of the original film and the gender politics of the remake. Freeland concludes that the original film&#x27;s depiction of Barbara makes for better cinema, and the more feminist-friendly update of Barbara is too derivative of standard &quot;final girl&quot; tropes.

Savini often screens an uncut work print VHS copy of the film at conventions. According to Savini, &quot;Years later I was at a midnight showing and did a Q&amp;A before the movie, and I wasn&#x27;t going to sit down and watch it, but I did...And it was the first time that I saw it objectively, and it&#x27;s good!&quot;

<text>The Stroke Count Method (), &quot;Wubihua method&quot;, &quot;Stroke input method&quot; or &quot;Bihua IME&quot; ( or ) (lit. &quot;5-stroke input method&quot;) is a relatively simple Chinese input method for writing text on a computer or a mobile phone. It is based on the stroke order of a word, not pronunciation. It uses five or six buttons, and is often placed on a numerical keypad. Although it is possible to input Traditional Chinese characters with this method, this method is often associated with Simplified Chinese characters. The Wubihua method should not be confused with the Wubi method.

Each of the five keys from 1 to 5 are assigned a certain type of stroke (resembling the Eight Principles of Yong; these five are sometimes called (&quot;héng-shù-piē-nà-zhé&quot;) with each character of this phrase being a one-syllable description of the respective five strokes:

# A horizontal stroke from left to right (一)
# A vertical stroke from top to bottom (丨)
# A long diagonal stroke downward from right to left (丿)
# A very short dash stroke downward from left to right (丶)
# A horizontal stroke from left to right, ending with a downwards hook to the left (乙)

To input any character, the user simply presses the keys corresponding to the strokes of a character then select from a list of matching characters. The list of suggestions to choose from becomes more and more specific as more digits of the code are entered. The system will not recognize a character input with an incorrect stroke order. Some people find this method of entering characters into a mobile phone to be faster than pinyin. In fact, as pinyin is based upon Mandarin Chinese, many Chinese people – particularly in the southern regions of China like Hong Kong and Macau – who speak other varieties of Chinese and never learned pinyin relied solely on this method of entering characters on their phones, until touchscreen-based smartphones allowed the possibility of handwriting recognition.

Wubihua is one of the easiest to learn methods because it is simple and does not require knowledge of pronunciation or pinyin. However, it tends to be vague, as a Wubihua code will normally match ten characters, and each character has one correct code, which confuses users whose stroke orders are wrong.

Strokes map to Wubihua input generally according to the following table:

<doc id="1254898" wikidata="Q213725" url="?curid=1254898" title="Stockfish">
<text>Stockfish is unsalted fish, especially cod, dried by cold air and wind on wooden racks (which are called &quot;hjell&quot; in Norway) on the foreshore. The drying of food is the world&#x27;s oldest known preservation method, and dried fish has a storage life of several years. The method is cheap and effective in suitable climates; the work can be done by the fisherman and family, and the resulting product is easily transported to market.

Over the centuries, several variants of dried fish have evolved. The &quot;stockfish&quot; (fresh dried, not salted) category is often mistaken for the &quot;klippfisk&quot;, or salted cod, category where the fish is salted before drying. Salting was not economically feasible until the 17th century, when cheap salt from southern Europe became available to the maritime nations of northern Europe.

Stockfish is cured in a process called fermentation where cold-adapted bacteria matures the fish, similar to the maturing process of cheese.

In English legal records of the medieval period, stock fishmongers are differentiated from ordinary fishmongers when the occupation of a plaintiff or defendant is recorded.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;stockfish&quot; is a loan word from West Frisian &quot;stokfisk&quot; (stick fish), possibly referring to the wooden racks on which stockfish are traditionally dried or because the dried fish resembles a stick. &quot;Stock&quot; may also refer to a wooden yoke or harness on a horse or mule, once used to carry large fish from the sea or after drying/smoking for trade in nearby villages. This etymology is consistent with the fact that &quot;Stockmaß&quot; is German for the height of a horse at the withers.

==Importance==
Stockfish is Norway&#x27;s longest sustained export commodity. Stockfish is first mentioned as a commodity in the 13th-century Icelandic prose work &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot;, where chieftain Thorolf Kveldulfsson, in the year 875 AD, ships stockfish from Helgeland in mid-Norway to Britain. This product accounted for most of Norway&#x27;s trade income from the Viking Age throughout the Medieval period.

Preserved cod fed Iceland for centuries, to the extent that it has been described as a local equivalent of bread.

Stockfish is extremely popular and is widely consumed in Catholic Mediterranean countries, mostly in Italy. (Stockfish is called &quot;stoccafisso&quot; in most Italian dialects, but confusingly &quot;baccalà&quot;—which normally refers to salt cod—in the Veneto). In Russian cuisine dried stockfish is a very popular dish which is often eaten with vodka and beer. In the 16th century Russian and Swedish stockfish were sold to many European countries.

Stockfish is a staple of Nigerian cuisine.

==Manufacturing and usage==

The science of producing good stockfish is in many ways comparable to that of making a good cognac, Parma ham, or a well-matured cheese. Practitioners of the Slow Food movement insist that all these artisanal products must be made on a small scale and given time to mature.

The fish is prepared immediately after capture. After gutting the fish, it is either dried whole, or split along the spine leaving the tail connected. The fish is hung on the &quot;hjell&quot; from February to May. Stable cool weather protects the fish from insects and prevents an uncontrolled bacterial growth. A temperature just above zero degrees Celsius, with little rain, is ideal. Too much frost will spoil the fish, as ice destroys the fibers in the fish. The climate in northern Norway is excellent for stockfish production. Due to the stable conditions, the stockfish produced in Lofoten and Vesterålen is often regarded as the best. The traditional cod harvest in Lofoten also takes place during the best drying time. Due to a milder and more humid climate, salted/dried whitefish (&quot;klippfisk&quot;) was more common in the fisheries districts of Western Norway.

After its three months hanging on the &quot;hjell&quot;, the fish is then matured for another two to three months indoors in a dry and airy environment. During the drying, about 80% of the water in the fish evaporates. The stockfish retains all the nutrients from the fresh fish, only concentrated: it is therefore rich in proteins, vitamins, iron, and calcium.

Most of the Norwegian dried cod is exported to Portugal ($244M), Sweden ($76M), Nigeria ($30.5M), Brazil ($29.1M), and Italy ($23.2M).
In Norway and Iceland, the stockfish is mostly used as a snack and for lutefisk production. In Italy, the fish (called &quot;stoccafisso&quot;) is soaked and used in various courses, and is viewed as a delicacy.

Low-quality stockfish is also commonly used as supplemental food for pets, primarily as dog food or dog treats.

The 2012–2015 project SafeTrackFood developed a method of indoor production of stockfish to accelerate the maturing and drying of the fish in a safe manner.

==Dishes==
&quot;Baccalà alla vicentina&quot;, an ancient and traditional Italian dish native to Vicenza, is made from stockfish (confusingly from dried and salted cod, although the salted form is known in standard Italian as &quot;baccalà&quot;), and is served on or next to polenta. In the Italian region of Basilicata, the so-called &quot;baccalà alla lucana&quot; is prepared with typical peppers called &quot;cruschi&quot; (dialect word for &quot;crispy&quot;). In Calabria, stockfish is widely used, especially in the western side of the region: pasta with stockfish is a staple in Christmas Eve.

Dishes made from stockfish (locally called &quot;bakalar&quot;) are traditionally eaten on Christmas Eve in Croatia, especially Dalmatia.

In Catalonia, stockfish is an ingredient of a kind of surf and turf named es niu.

Stockfish is popular in West Africa, especially in Nigeria where it serves as a flavor and fish in the many soups like Egusi, Edikaikong, Ofe nsala, Afang, Ukazi, Oha, Efo Riro, Okra, etc., that are eaten with fufu meals, such as pounded yam, fufu, and garri meals. It is the main ingredient in the Nigerian delicacy called &quot;Ugba na Okporoko&quot; or &quot;ukazi&quot; amongst the Igbo, Ibibio, Efik, Annang, Kalabari, Igbani, Ikwerre, etc., people of south eastern Nigeria. Most importers of &quot;okporoko&quot; are based in the town of Aba in Abia State. Among the Nri, Aro, Nkwerre, and Umuahia people, at festive periods, the popular meal is the Ukazi soup which is usually well-garnished with okporoko or cod as it is popularly called. The Kwe people, who are a fishing people of the English-speaking part of Cameroon, use stockfish in flavoring their palm nut or banga, which can be eaten with a cocoyam pudding called &quot;kwacoco&quot;. The name okporoko for stockfish, among the Igbo of Nigeria refers to the sound the hard fish makes in the pot and literally translates as &quot;that which produces sound in the pot&quot;.

Both stockfish and salt cod can be made into lutefisk.

<text>Thursday is a 1998 American black comedy crime-thriller film written and directed by Skip Woods and starring Thomas Jane, Aaron Eckhart, Paulina Porizkova, Paula Marshall, Michael Jeter and Mickey Rourke. It won the Special Jury Prize at the Cognac Festival.

==Plot==
On Monday night, Nick, Dallas, and Billy Hill argue with a Los Angeles convenience store cashier, resulting in Dallas shooting her dead. They conceal the killing from a police officer until he sees blood on the floor, at which point they kill him.

Early Thursday morning, in Texas, Casey receives a call from his old drug dealing partner Nick asking to stay a couple of days. Since they parted ways several years previously, Casey has cleaned up, married, and is hoping to adopt a child. Nick borrows Casey&#x27;s car, and Casey finds Nick&#x27;s suitcase to be full of heroin. Furious, he calls Nick and gives an ultimatum in which Nick either leaves or Casey calls the cops. Nick promises he&#x27;ll be along once he has finished some business. Casey puts the heroin down his garbage disposal unit.

At 11:55, Casey answers the door to hitman Ice. Casey asks that they smoke some ganja together before he dies, then takes advantage of a distraction. Ice ends up gagged and bound in Casey&#x27;s garage just as Dr. Jarvis, the adoption agent, rings the doorbell. Casey, stoned, rushes to clear away the drug paraphernalia before letting Jarvis in to discuss his suitability to adopt. Jarvis expresses curiosity about what Casey did when he lived in Los Angeles, as there is no account of his time there. Casey tries his best to cover up his past as well as his recent encounter with Ice.

During the interview, Dallas shows up at Casey&#x27;s house, believing that Nick has left some money with Casey along with the heroin. She scares Jarvis away by telling a story about Casey&#x27;s criminal past. When left alone with Casey, Dallas questions him about the money. Angry that he cannot help her, she decides to kill him, but not before she ties him to a chair, fellates him to force an erection, then proceeds to rape him. Dallas says she will not kill Casey until he orgasms and plans to continue until he does so. She orgasms twice, but gets no results from Casey. While Dallas reaches a third orgasm, Billy breaks in and shoots her.

Billy believes Casey when told that he has not taken the heroin, but plans on torturing him anyway with a saw and a blowtorch. Billy is interrupted by cops raiding the house next door. As Billy is distracted, Casey is able to loosen the tape around his wrists and grabs a frying pan before he sits back down. When Billy returns, Casey catches him off guard, overpowers him with the frying pan, and leaves him in the garage.

Nick calls Casey from a payphone, apologizes for everything, and admits he had stolen the heroin and money from the police. After he hangs up, it is revealed that Nick has been shot and is dying from blood loss. Finally, corrupt cop Kasarov arrives with a bag which contains Nick&#x27;s head. He gives Casey until 7 p.m. to find the money, but says that he does not care about the heroin. Upon seeing Dallas&#x27;s body and Ice and Billy in the garage, Kasarov unloads his gun into the latter two. He tells Casey to throw them out, as it is garbage day.

Casey calls Ice&#x27;s boss and tells him that the heroin is being auctioned off at 7 p.m. at his house, setting up a gun battle between a Jamaican gang and Kasarov&#x27;s corrupt cops. Casey recalls Nick&#x27;s earlier words, which lead him to find the money and a wedding present in the spare tire of his car. He takes them, puts them in Dallas&#x27;s Lamborghini, and leaves to pick his wife up at the airport.

==Cast==
==Critical response==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 43%, based on 7 critic reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10.

Film critic Emanuel Levy rated the film 2 out of 5 stars, while Christopher Null granted it a 3 out of 5 star rating.

In his review of &quot;Thursday&quot;, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; vehemently condemned the film&#x27;s offensive nature, declaring it crossed a line that left him outraged. He characterized the movie as a disturbing sequence of events involving torture, rape, murder, and dismemberment, all interwoven with derogatory sexist and racist language. Ebert&#x27;s critique delved into the film&#x27;s tone, expressing skepticism about its reliance on irony and laughter to shield the audience from a moral response. He questioned the film&#x27;s choice to portray characters as murderers and torturers without justifiable motives, highlighting the gratuitous violence directed towards black, Asian, and Indian characters. He also drew a pointed comparison between the film and Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s work, highlighting the distinction between Tarantino&#x27;s artful treatment of risky subject matter and the exploitative nature of &quot;Thursday&quot;, which he contended turned depravity into a standup routine. Ebert criticized the audience&#x27;s lack of moral awareness during the Q&amp;A session after the screening, where he confronted the director about the film&#x27;s depiction of race and violence.

Brendan Kelly of &quot;Variety&quot; criticized the film as a subpar Tarantino imitation, stating that it offers only a few funny moments and fails to save itself from being labeled as a derivative retread. Kelly attributed this to director Woods&#x27; unapologetic borrowing from &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. He suggested that the film&#x27;s reliance on familiar hip and violent themes might find a more receptive audience in the video market than in theaters, given the current saturation of such content. Kelly praised Thomas Jane and Aaron Eckhart&#x27;s performances, but characterized Paulina Porizkova&#x27;s casting as a ruthless mob figure as a misstep.

==Awards and nominations==

At the Cognac Festival du Film Policier the film won the 1999 Special Jury Prize (tied with &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;).

It was nominated for an Artios Award in the category of Best Casting of an Independent Feature Film.
