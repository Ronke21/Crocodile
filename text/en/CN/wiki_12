<text>The Rinella Battery () was a Victorian battery in Kalkara, Malta. It is commonly referred to as Fort Rinella (), although it was never classified as a fort while in use. It was armed with an Armstrong 100-ton gun, which survives; the only other surviving gun is at the Napier of Magdala Battery, Gibraltar.

==Description==
The Rinella Battery was modestly sized, being designed to operate the single large gun. The fortifications were simple - ditches, caponiers, a counter-scarp gallery and firing points - and designed for infantry; there is no secondary armament. The battery&#x27;s low profile and subterranean magazine and machinery spaces were protective measures against capital ship counterfire.

The gun was mounted &quot;en barbette&quot; on a wrought-iron sliding carriage, allowing the gun to be fired over the parapet without exposing the gun crew to enemy fire. Ammunition was fed from the magazine through elevators in each of the two loading casemate; there was one casement on each side of the gun. The expected range against warships was 7,000 yards.

The firing cycle was as follows:

# An elevator transported a 2,000-pound shell and 450-pound silk cartridges containing black powder propellant into the loading casemate&#x27;s loading chamber.
# The gun slewed to a loading casemate and aligned the muzzle with the casemate&#x27;s water pipe nozzle. The water cooled the gun and cleaned the barrel. The gun was depressed to drain the water.
# The gun traversed and depressed to align the muzzle with the casemate&#x27;s loading port, with the barrel pushing aside port&#x27;s iron plate cover. The ramming mechanism pushed the shell and propellant charges from the loading chamber into the barrel, and tamped them.
# The gun traversed and elevated back into firing position. An electrical firing mechanism was attached, making the gun ready to fire.

Even with two loading casemates feeding the gun, the intended rate of fire was once every six minutes.

It was impractical to manhandle such a heavy gun. Gun laying, the washing system, rammer, and ammunition elevators were powered by hydraulic machinery. The power plant was a stationary steam engine. Hydraulic pressure could be maintained by a backup 40-man manual pump.

The emplacement was completed with inner revetments of stone or masonry. Except for the loading casemates, the revetting was removed after being identified by reviews as weaknesses. They were replaced with plain earthworks, presumably to better absorb the energy of incoming shellfire.

==History==
===Early service===

In 1873, Italy began construction of the two s, each protected by 22-inches of steel armour and armed with four Armstrong 100-ton guns. These could threatened the sea lines of communication of the British Empire through the Mediterranean Sea; the Suez Canal provided a route to India after opening in 1869. In response, Britain constructed four batteries in the Mediterranean, each armed with a 100-ton gun: the Rinella and Cambridge Batteries at Malta, and the Victoria and Napier of Magdala Batteries at Gibraltar. Rinella was built between 1878 and 1886 above the shore east of the entrance to the Grand Harbour, between Fort Ricasoli and Fort St. Rocco. The Cambridge Battery was built near Tigné Point west of the harbour entrance.

The 100-ton gun arrived in Malta from Woolwich on 10 September 1882. It remained at the dockyards for some months before being ferried to Rinella Bay. Over the next three months one hundred men from the Royal Artillery manhandled it to the battery. The gun entered service in January 1884. Practice firing was limited to one short every three months due to cost; each shell cost as much as the daily wage of 2600 soldiers. The gun fired for the last time on 5 May 1905 before being withdrawn from active service in 1906. It never saw action in 20 years of service.

===After the 100-ton gun===
Following the retirement of the 100-ton gun, Rinella became an observation post for Fort Ricasoli. Sometime after the obsolete steam engine and hydraulic system were removed.

Rinella was used as a Royal Navy supply depot during the Second World War. The battery&#x27;s covering of moss and grass acted as camouflage; from the air it blended into the surrounding fields. Nonetheless, it received seven bomb hits.

The navy abandoned the site in 1965. In the 1970s, the battery was used as a location in the films &quot;Zeppelin&quot; (1971), &quot;Young Winston&quot; (1972) and &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; (1976).

===Museum===
The Rinella Battery was taken over by the Malta Heritage Trust () in 1991. After restoration work it opened to the public as an open-air museum in 1996. The restored gun was fired for the first time in a hundred years on 21 November 2005 by Peter Caruana, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, who is of Maltese descent. The gun is fired once a year with a blank black powder charge. The operating machinery has not been restored.

Throughout the year, between Monday and Saturday (10.00 - 17.00hrs) historical re-enactors dressed as 19th Century British soldiers provide regular guided tours along with a full-scale military re-enactment combining the live-firing of historic artillery and cavalry. The fort also has its audio-visual, audio guides in 14 languages and is fully interpreted. Members of the public are offered the opportunity of firing a cannon or a period musket or to sponsor a cavalry horse. This includes the firing, without shot, of a Victorian-era muzzle-loading fieldpiece.

In 2015, the battery was shortlisted as a possible site for the campus of the proposed American University of Malta. It was not chosen, and the campus is to be split up between Dock No. 1 in Cospicua and Żonqor Point in Marsaskala.

==Philately==
In 2010 Malta and Gibraltar jointly issued a four-stamp set of stamps featuring the two jurisdictions&#x27; 100-ton guns. Two stamps show the gun at Fort Rinella, and two the gun at Napier of Magdala Battery. One of each pair is a view from 1882, and the other is a view from 2010. The stamps from Malta bear a denomination of €0.75, while those from Gibraltar bear a denomination of 75p.

<text>The Album Leaf is an American musical project founded in San Diego, California, in 1998 by Jimmy LaValle. He is known for his use of electronics, synthesizer, and Rhodes piano. His performances often feature projected visual art.

==History==
===Inception===
The Album Leaf officially began in 1998 as the solo project of Jimmy LaValle, guitarist for San Diego, California-based post-rock instrumental band Tristeza. LaValle has also performed in several other San Diego-area bands, including The Crimson Curse, The Locust, Swing Kids, and GoGoGo Airheart.

===&quot;An Orchestrated Rise to Fall&quot;===
During downtime in the fall of 1998, LaValle began playing drums for San Diego band GoGoGo Airheart. Their singer and guitarist, Mike Vermillion (who later inspired the song name &quot;Vermillion&quot; on &quot;One Day I&#x27;ll Be on Time&quot;), recorded LaValle doing improvised material on a Rhodes piano to a vintage Roland drum machine. This would become his first full-length album, the 10-track &quot;An Orchestrated Rise to Fall&quot;. Benjamin White of GoGoGo Airheart and Vermillion supplied synthesizers and vocals to these recordings.

Before Tristeza released &quot;Spine and Sensory&quot; on Makoto records in 1998, the band was talking with a handful of different indie record labels. One of the record labels was &quot;The Music Fellowship&quot; out of Salt Lake City, Utah. LaValle asked them if they would be interested in releasing his solo material. They accepted, and &quot;An Orchestrated Rise to Fall&quot; saw release in 1999 on CD. Later in the year, Tristeza and the Album Leaf both signed with newly started Tigerstyle Records out of New York City. A&amp;R rep for the Tigerstyle, Mike Treff, had previously operated his own record label named Linkwork Records. Tigerstyle wanted to release the vinyl version of &quot;An Orchestrated Rise to Fall&quot;. Since it would be one of the first Tigerstyle releases, but limited to vinyl, Treff opted to make it Linkwork Record&#x27;s last release instead.

LaValle played his first official The Album Leaf show at the Ché Café in the winter of 1999. Band members for this show consisted of Rafter Roberts, Jimmy Lehner (of Tristeza), Leilani Clark (of local San Diego band &quot;the Straight A&#x27;s&quot;, also with LaValle), Benjamin White (of GoGoGo Airheart), and John Pham.

===&quot;One Day I&#x27;ll Be on Time&quot;===
Soon after signing with Tigerstyle Records, LaValle received his first recording advance. He used this money to buy his first computer, and purchase equipment for a home recording studio. He completed his first recordings, and those songs were released as a 4-song EP entitled &quot;In an Off White Room&quot; on Troubleman Records Unlimited. The title for the EP was named after the color of his home studio, which was in his living room. During time off from Tristeza&#x27;s tour promoting &quot;Dream Signals in Full Circles&quot; in 2000, he began writing &quot;One Day I&#x27;ll Be on Time&quot;.

The Album Leaf performed their second show during Tristeza&#x27;s 2000 spring tour, at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. The show was at Club Deville, at a day party for online distributor Insound.com. The lineup consisted of Lavalle, Leilani Clark on guitar and keyboards, Tana Helean on keyboards, Susanna Waiche on bass, and Jay Hough (of GoGoGoAirheart) on drums. They shared the stage with Tristeza and The American Analog Set. This lineup also did a 4-week U.S. tour in the summer of 2000, with Andy Robillard (also of GoGoGo Airheart) replacing Hough on drums.

After the summer tour, LaValle took a full-time job in San Diego at the newly launched music house &quot;Singing Serpent&quot;, producing jingles for television commercials. This also gave him access to a full-service recording studio. LaValle used this studio to re-record the material he had written for &quot;One Day I&#x27;ll Be on Time&quot;. Rafter Roberts recorded the track &quot;Storyboard&quot;, and can be heard in the beginning of the song discussing Lavalle&#x27;s guitar tone. Jason Soares of San Diego band Aspects of Physics provided drum programming for &quot;Vermillion&quot;. Tristeza bandmate Christopher Sprague played guitar on &quot;In Between Lines&quot; and designed the album art. After completing this record, LaValle left Singing Serpent, saying, &quot;Making jingles was killing my creativity!&quot;

&quot;One Day I&#x27;ll Be on Time&quot; saw worldwide release in early 2001. Jón Þór Birgisson of Icelandic band Sigur Rós picked up the album at a record store in Reykjavík, Iceland, and asked LaValle to support their upcoming U.S. tour. This put The Album Leaf in front of new audiences and helped them gain popularity. The lineup at this point consisted of LaValle, Luis Hermosillo (of Tristeza) on bass, Nathan Delffs on keyboards and guitar, Eric Hinjosa on keyboards, and Andy Robillard still on drums. This lineup also toured the U.S. during December 2001 and the summer of 2002 without Hinojosa.

During this time, LaValle wrote two songs, &quot;Hungry for a Holiday&quot; and &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, for Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes to sing on, and another two songs, &quot;Call in Blue&quot; and &quot;Reso&quot; (after future violinist Matt Resovich), for Marc Bianchi of Her Space Holiday, which began a set of 7&quot; singles for Better Lookings &quot;Collaboration Series&quot;. This series is limited to 1,000 copies and is only available to subscribers. The Her Space Holiday collaboration would not be released until 2003.

In January 2003, The Album Leaf toured Japan for the second time. The first time had been an opening slot for LaValle&#x27;s band Tristeza in the spring of 2002, where he performed with fellow band members Luis Hermosillo and Eric Hinojosa. This was a headlining tour with fellow San Diego band Ilya supporting. LaValle enlisted Duane Pitre, Matthew Baker, and Hank Morton of Ilya to back him, along with Robillard on drums.

Immediately following this tour, LaValle was offered to support Sigur Rós&#x27; European tour. On this tour he performed solo and started incorporating electronic beats and loop pedals into his live show in order to perform his songs as a one-man band. Later during this tour, Kjartan Sveinsson, Orri Páll Dýrason, and María Huld Markan of Sigur Rós and Amiina respectively, began to join LaValle on stage, performing on a couple of songs during his half-hour performance slot.

Upon returning home, he had put together another lineup for supporting the U.S. portion of Sigur Rós&#x27; tour. This lineup was made up of Hermosillo, Delffs, and Tim Reece now on drums. Kjartan Sveinsson, Orri Páll Dýrason, and María Huld Markan would still join them on stage. This tour saw The Album Leaf playing at music venues such as Radio City Music Hall in New York City, gaining even more popularity for the band.

After these tours, LaValle decided to leave Tristeza and focus on The Album Leaf full-time.

===&quot;A Lifetime or More&quot; and the &quot;Seal Beach&quot; EP===
During the following months of 2003, LaValle began recording again. He recorded 3 tracks for a split EP with New York City&#x27;s, On! Air! Library! for the Arena Rock Recording Co. called &quot;A Lifetime or More&quot;. Drew Andrews provided guitar for the track &quot;Another Day&quot;. During May 2003, with his new addition of electronic beats, LaValle recorded 5 songs released as the &quot;Seal Beach EP&quot; for Spanish record label Acuarela Discos.

In August 2003, The Album Leaf headlined a tour of the U.S. with fellow San Diego band Ilya. This tour introduced The Album Leaf&#x27;s use of live visual projection art by Andrew Pates and the lineup went down to just LaValle and Drew Andrews on keyboards and guitar, with them incorporating laptops and Pates projecting visuals onto a backdrop of the stage. The lineup was becoming more permanent.

Following this tour, LaValle traveled to Iceland to begin recording his third full-length album. During the Sigur Rós European and U.S. tours, LaValle received an invitation from Sigur Rós to record in their Icelandic studio. During these recording sessions, The Album Leaf performed two shows in Iceland, one being a part of the Iceland Airwaves music festival with LaValle being backed by Kjartan Sveinsson, Orri Páll Dýrason, and María Huld Markan of Sigur Rós and Amiina with Sindri Mar Finnbogason playing bass.

In December 2003, The Album Leaf opened for The American Analog Set on their U.S. tour. This lineup consisted of Matt Resovich on violin, Andrew Kenny (of The American Analog Set), and Sean Ripple (of The American Analog Set), with Pates doing live projections.

===&quot;In a Safe Place&quot;===
In January 2004, LaValle signed with Seattle-based record label Sub Pop Records and Berlin, Germany based European label City Slang Records. He completed &quot;In a Safe Place&quot; in February 2004. Jón Þór Birgisson, Kjartan Sveinsson, and Orri Páll Dýrason (most of the members of Sigur Rós), María Huld Markan (of Amiina), Gyða Valtýsdóttir (formally of múm), Pall Jenkins, and Matt Resovich (of the Blackheart Procession) all contributed to the record with Birgir Jón &quot;Biggi&quot; Birgisson, engineering at Sigur Rós&#x27; Sundlaugin studio.

&quot;In a Safe Place&quot; was released on June 22, 2004. The Album Leaf played a record release show at M-Theory Records in San Diego with its current lineup of Matt Resovich on violin, keyboards, glockenspiel, guitar, and vocals; Drew Andrews on guitar, keyboards, and vocals; Tim Reece on drums and keyboards, with Andrew Pates projecting live visuals. Following the release, The Album Leaf toured for a year with little time off performing in the U.S., Europe, Taiwan, and Japan. During this time, they self-released the &quot;Red Tour EP&quot; which contained 5 tracks. This was to showcase the band as individuals and each member (with the exception of Reece) providing their own song; the cd is also enhanced with a tour video made by Andrew Pates. The EP also featured a live recording of &quot;Micro Melodies&quot;, a song that only appeared on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Moog&quot;, a documentary about Robert Moog, the inventor of the Moog synthesizer. The track &quot;Over the Pond&quot; is also used in the film &quot;The Family Friend&quot; (L&#x27;Amico di Famiglia) by Paolo Sorrentino.

This record saw more commercial success and popularity, establishing LaValle&#x27;s The Album Leaf on the map and playing to bigger audiences. Many of the tracks from &quot;In a Safe Place&quot; were used in soundtracks for television shows such as The OC and .

Following extensive touring, LaValle re-joined Tristeza, filling in on guitar for two shows in Guadalajara and Mexico City in place of Alison Ables. When Ables returned, LaValle began writing his next full-length album.

In December 2005, LaValle traveled to Seattle, Washington to Bear Creek Recording Studio to begin tracking the record. After tracking, he traveled back to Sigur Rós&#x27; Sundlaugin studio to mix the record with the help of Jón Þór Birgisson and Joshua Eustis (of Telefon Tel Aviv).

===&quot;Into the Blue Again&quot;===
On September 12, 2006, &quot;Into the Blue Again&quot; was released on Sub Pop Records in North America. The album saw an earlier release in Germany on September 8, 2006, and throughout the rest of Europe on September 11, 2006, courtesy of City Slang Records. &quot;Into the Blue Again&quot; sees LaValle handling virtually all instrumental duties once more. His few collaborators are Joshua Eustis of Telefon Tel Aviv, who contributed additional drum programming and engineering on several songs; the Black Heart Procession&#x27;s Pall Jenkins adding vocal harmonies on &quot;Wherever I Go&quot;; input from violinist Matt Resovich (who performs with the Album Leaf live and also played on &quot;In a Safe Place&quot;); and Drew Andrews adding additional guitar work on select songs (Drew also performs with the Album Leaf live). In support of the record, the band toured extensively through the United States, Europe, Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan. Lymbyc Systym supported most of the band&#x27;s US dates.

The album&#x27;s first track, &quot;The Light&quot;, was used in advertisements for Channel 4&#x27;s series of programmes &quot;Disarming Britain&quot; and the 2012 documentary film &quot;16 Acres&quot;. It is also prominently used in the TV series &quot;Scandal&quot;. &quot;Writings on the Wall&quot; was used in the pilot episode of &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; in 2008.

===2008===
In June 2008, the band performed an original score to F. W. Murnau&#x27;s 1927 silent film &quot;&quot; at the Seattle International Film Festival. These performances were held at the Triple Door in Seattle.
Also in June, they collaborated with Mike Heron of The Incredible String Band for a one-off show at the legendary 17,500-seat capacity Hollywood Bowl, opening for Gilberto Gil and Devendra Banhart.

===&quot;A Chorus of Storytellers&quot;===
&quot;A Chorus of Storytellers&quot; was released on February 2, 2010, on Sub Pop Records. The album was mixed by Jimmy LaValle and Birgir Jón &quot;Biggi&quot; Birgisson at Sundlaugin Studio in Iceland and mastered by Roger Seibel at SAE Mastering in Phoenix, AZ. Recording was done at Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, WA and for the first time, featured a full live band. Supporting the album, the band again toured extensively between February and May through the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Notably, the band were chosen to perform at the ATP I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror festival curated by ATP &amp; Portishead in September 2011 in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

===&quot;Between Waves&quot;===
The Album Leaf released their sixth full-length album, &quot;Between Waves,&quot; on August 26, 2016. It is the first album by The Album Leaf to feature the band&#x27;s full current lineup. It is also the band&#x27;s first release on Relapse Records, which they signed with in early 2016. The 8-song album has a greater focus on a group dynamic, having been entirely produced and recorded by LaValle and the band.

They spent the rest of 2016 touring the United States, Canada, and Europe in support of the new album. In December 2016, American webzine Somewherecold ranked &quot;Between Waves&quot; No. 5 on their &quot;Somewherecold Awards 2016&quot; list.

===&quot;One Day XX&quot;===

<text>Weiden in der Oberpfalz (, ; official abbreviation: Weiden i.d.OPf.; Northern Bavarian: &quot;Weidn in da Owapfalz&quot;) is a district-free city in Bavaria, Germany. It is located east of Nuremberg and west of the Czech border. Weiden is the second biggest city in the governmental district Oberpfalz, next to Regensburg. A branch of the German Army is located here.

==History==
Weiden in der Oberpfalz was first mentioned in a document in 1241 as Weiden. It is assumed that the first settlements in Weiden are dated the year 1000. Located at the intersection of two major trading routes (Goldene Strasse and Magdeburger Strasse), Weiden soon became an important trading center with a population of 2,200 in 1531. Two city fires, the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the Plague gave the city setbacks, which it didn&#x27;t recover from until the end of the 18th Century. Between 1634 and 1635, as well as between 1648 and 1650; Weiden was occupied by Swedish troops. Since 1714 the city fully belonged to the Duchy of Palatine-Sulzbach. An economic boom came along in 1863, when Weiden was connected to the railroad network. With the settlement of important glass and porcelain companies, the population increased, around the turn of the century it was already close to 10.000.

On 1 January 1919, the city became district-free by decree of the first Republican Prime Minister, Kurt Eisner (USPD) 

==Districts==

==Incorporations into Weiden in der Oberpfalz==
On January 1, 1914, the municipality of Moosbürg was incorporated with Moosbürg, Ermersricht, Fichtenbühl and Leihstadtmühle. On February 1, 1915 Tröglersricht and Zollhaus of the former municipality of Edeldorf followed

On July 1, 1972 the following districts were incorporated:

* Municipality of Frauenricht with Frauenricht, Halmesricht, Latsch and Spitalöd
* Municipality of Muglhof with Muglhof, Mitterhöll, Unterhöll, Oedenthal and Trauschendorf
* Municipality of Neunkirchen bei Weiden with Neunkirchen, Brandweiher and Wiesendorf
* Municipality of Rothenstadt with Rothenstadt and Mallersricht

On May 1, 1978 the following districts were added to existing Municipalities

* Matzlesrieth; added to the Municipality of Muglhof
* Maierhof, Neubau, Ullersricht and Moodöd; added to the Municipality of Rothenstadt

==Main sights==

===Historical buildings===
* St. Josef, a Catholic church, built 1899–1900, Neo Romanesque style with Art Nouveau interior.
* Marktplatz, the market square stretched between Upper and Lower Gates with numerous renaissance buildings.
* Altes Rathaus (&quot;Old Town Hall&quot;), built between 1539 and 1545 by Hans Nopl.
* St. Michael, a Protestant church, rebuilt several times. The church got its present baroque appearance from 1627, the tower from 1761.
* Alte Stadtmauer, partially preserved old city walls from the 14th century.
* St. Sebastian, a Catholic chapel, built around 1480.

===Museums===
*International Ceramic Museum
*City Museum - exhibits art, furniture and porcelain from the early 16th century to the 19th century. There is a room dedicated to composer Max Reger, who lived and studied in Weiden.

== Economy and Infrastructure ==

=== Overview ===
In the year 2016, Weiden, within the city limits, reached a GDP of 2.272 Billion € and a GDP per capita of €53.734 . (Bavaria: 44.215€/ Germany: 38.180€) Therefore it was significantly higher than average. In 2017 there were about 41.800 employeed people in the city. The rate of unemployment in 2018 stood at 5.3%, and therefore significantly higher than the bavarian average of 2.7%.

=== Economic structure ===
Today, about 42.000 people live in Weiden on an Area of 70.5 km2 / 27.2 mi2. Weiden never was a typical industrial city; in 2015 only a fifth of all 26.567 employees subject to social security worked in the manufacturing sector, meanwhile more than ¾ were working in the service sector.

Since the end of the 20th century industry and trade have changed a lot. The monostructure of glass and porcellain with companies like Bauscher, Seltmann and Nachtmann, who still play a big role in the manufacturing sector, was dismantled and supplemented through vehicle construction, plastics processing and microelectronics companies. 

A structural change is reflected in the massive job cuts in the glass and porcelain industry, which is why Weiden suffers from persistently high rates of unemployment.

=== Traffic ===

==== Highways ====

* Bundesautobahnen:
** A93: Autobahndreieck Hochfranken - Hof - Weiden - Schwandorf - Regensburg - Wolnzach - Autobahndreieck Holledau
* Bundesstraßen:

There are 7 bus lines in regular traffic (Line 1-7) and 6 bus lines in light traffic (91-95, 98), that all meet at the Central Bus Station next to the town hall. The regular traffic (in which buses drive every 15-30 minutes) applies every Monday to Friday between 6:00 and 18:15. Before 6:00 and after 18:15, as well as on Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays the light traffic (with buses every 40 minutes) applies.

Next to the citybuses, there are intercity buses operated by the Regionalbus Ostbayern GmbH (RBO), a daughter company of the Deutsche Bahn. They drive into the surrounding cities and villages and meet at the cities&#x27; train station

Ticket prices are regulated by the Tarif Oberpfalz Nord (TON). The Nahverkehrsgemeinschaft Weiden-Neustadt (NWN) has joined the TON as well, creating one unified system for the northern part of the Oberpfalz

<doc id="1231970" wikidata="Q6820681" url="?curid=1231970" title="Merthyr Rising">
<text>The Merthyr Rising, also referred to as the Merthyr Riots, of 1831 was the violent climax to many years of simmering unrest among the large working class population of Merthyr Tydfil in Wales and the surrounding area. The Rising marked the first times the red flag was used a symbol of working class rebellion in the United Kingdom.

==Beginnings==
Throughout May 1831 the coal miners and others, who worked for William Crawshay, took to the streets of Merthyr Tydfil, calling for reform, protesting against the lowering of their wages and general unemployment. Gradually the protest spread to nearby industrial towns and villages and by the end of May the whole area was in rebellion, and it is believed that for the first time the red flag of revolution was flown as a symbol of workers&#x27; revolt.

==Events==
After storming Merthyr town, the rebels sacked the local debtors&#x27; court and the goods that had been collected. Account books containing debtors&#x27; details were also destroyed. Among the shouts were cries of (&#x27;cheese and bread&#x27;) and (&#x27;down with the king&#x27;).

On 1 June 1831, the protesters marched to local mines and persuaded the men on shift there to stop working and join their protest. In the meantime, the Grey ministry had ordered in the army, with contingents of the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot dispatched to Merthyr Tydfil to restore order. Since the crowd was now too large to be dispersed, the soldiers were ordered to protect essential buildings and people.

On 2 June, while local employers and magistrates were holding a meeting with the High Sheriff of Glamorgan at the Castle Inn, a group led by Lewis Lewis (known as , &#x27;Lewis the hunter&#x27;) marched there to demand a reduction in the price of bread and an increase in their wages. The demands were rejected, and after being advised to return to their homes, attacked the inn. Engaged by the Sutherland Highlanders, after the rioters seized some of their weapons, the troops were commanded to open fire. After a protracted struggle in which hundreds sustained injury, some fatal, the Highlanders were compelled to withdraw to Penydarren House, and abandon the town to the rioters.

Some 7,000 to 10,000 workers marched under a red flag, which was later adopted internationally as the symbol of communists and socialists. For four days, magistrates and ironmasters were under siege in the Castle Hotel, and the protesters effectively controlled Merthyr.

For eight days, Penydarren House was the sole refuge of authority. With armed insurrection fully in place in the town by 4 June, the rioters had commandeered arms and explosives, set up road-blocks, formed guerrilla detachments, and had banners capped with a symbolic loaf and dyed in blood. Those who had military experience had taken the lead in drilling the armed para-military formation, and created an effective central command and communication system.

This allowed them to control the town and engage the formal military system, including:
*Ambushing the 93rd&#x27;s baggage-train on the Brecon Road, under escort of 40 of the Glamorgan Yeomanry, and drove them into the Brecon hills.
*Beating off a relief force of 100 cavalry sent from Penydarren House.
*Ambushing and disarming the Swansea Yeomanry on the Swansea Road, and throwing them back in disorder to Neath.
*Organising a mass demonstration against Penydarren House.

Having sent messengers, who had started strikes in Northern Monmouthshire, Neath and Swansea Valleys, the riots reached their peak. However, panic had spread to the family oriented and peaceful town folk, who had now started to flee what was an out-of-control town. With the rioters arranging a mass meeting for Sunday 6th, the government representatives in Penydarren House managed to split the rioters&#x27; council. When 450 troops marched to the mass meeting at Waun above Dowlais with levelled weapons, the meeting dispersed and the riots were effectively over.

==Outcome==

By 7 June the authorities had regained control of the town through force with up to 24 of the protesters killed. Twenty-six people were arrested and put on trial for taking part in the revolt. Several were sentenced to terms of imprisonment, others sentenced to penal transportation to Australia, and two were sentenced to death by hanging – Lewis Lewis () for Robbery and Richard Lewis () for stabbing a soldier (Private Donald Black of the Highland Regiment) in the leg with a seized bayonet.

Lewsyn yr Heliwr&#x27;s sentence was downgraded to a life sentence and penal transportation to Australia when one of the police officers who had tried to disperse the crowd testified that he had tried to shield him from the rioters. He was transported aboard the vessel &quot;John&quot; in 1832 and died 6 September 1847 in Port Macquarie, New South Wales.

Following this reprieve, the Grey ministry was determined that at least one rebel should die as an example of what happened to rebels. The people of Merthyr Tydfil were convinced that Richard Lewis (Dic Penderyn) was not responsible for the stabbing, and 11,000 signed a petition demanding his release. The government refused, and Richard Lewis was hanged at Cardiff Market on August 13, 1831.

In 1874, a Congregational minister, the Rev. Evan Evans, said that a man called Ianto Parker had given him a death-bed confession, saying that he had stabbed Donald Black and then fled to America fearing capture by the authorities. James Abbott, a hairdresser from Merthyr Tydfil who had testified at Penderyn&#x27;s trial, later said that he had lied under oath, claiming that he had been instructed to do so by Lord Melbourne.

== Legacy ==
In 2015, Welsh Labour MP Ann Clwyd presented a petition to the House of Commons calling for Dic Penderyn to be posthumously pardoned, stating that there was &quot;strong feeling in Wales that Richard Lewis - Dic Penderyn - was wrongly executed.&quot;

=== In creative works ===
Since 2013, a music festival named after the rising has been held annually in Merthyr to promote working class culture and social justice in arts. Meic Stevens&#x27; song &quot;Dic Penderyn&quot; on his 1972 album celebrates Richard Lewis. Radical singer-songwriter David Rovics included a song about the Merthyr Rising, entitled &quot;Cheese and Bread&quot;, in the 2018 album &quot;Ballad of a Wobbly&quot;. The musical &quot;My Land&#x27;s Shore&quot; by Robert Gould and Christopher J Orton centres on the riots. It was performed at the Bloomsbury Theatre by the University College London Musical Theatre society in February 2022. In 2024, Ferocious Dog released a song titled &quot;Merthyr Rising&quot; in their album Kleptocracy.

In 2015, stylist Charlotte James and photographer Tom Johnson published a series titled Merthyr Rising, showcasing residents of the town.

The 2022 poetry anthology &quot; / Uprising&quot; contained two poems about Dic Penderyn and the Merthyr Rising.

<doc id="1231976" wikidata="Q265831" url="?curid=1231976" title="Cannabinol">
<text>Cannabinol (CBN) is a mildly psychoactive phytocannabinoid that acts as a low affinity partial agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors. This activity at CB1 and CB2 receptors constitutes interaction of CBN with the endocannabinoid system (ECS).

Although CBN shares the same mechanism of action as other phytocannabinoids (e.g., Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, Δ9-THC), it has a lower affinity for CB1 receptors, meaning that much higher doses of CBN are required in order to experience effects, such as mild sedation.

It was the first cannabinoid to be isolated from cannabis and was discovered in 1896.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Both THC and CBN activate the CB1 (Ki = 211.2 nM) and CB2 (Ki = 126.4 nM) receptors. Each compound acts as a low affinity partial agonist at CB1 receptors with THC demonstrating 5x–10× greater affinity to the CB1 receptor. Like THC, CBN has a higher selectivity for CB2 receptors which are located throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, but are primarily associated with immune function. CB2 receptors are known to be located on immune cells throughout the body, including macrophages, T cells, and B cells. These immune cells have been shown to decrease production of immune-related chemical signals (e.g., cytokines) or undergo apoptosis as a consequence of CB2 agonism by CBN. In cell culture, CBN demonstrates antimicrobial effects, particularly in instances of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. CBN has also been reported to act as an ANKTM1 channel agonist at high concentrations (&gt;20nM). While some phytocannabinoids have been shown to interact with nociceptive and immune-related signaling via transient receptor potential channels (e.g., TRPV1 and TRPM8), there is currently limited evidence to suggest that CBN acts in this way. In preclinical rodent studies, CBN, anandamide and other CB1 agonists have demonstrated inhibitory effects on GI motility, reversible via CB1R blockade (i.e., antagonism).

In considering the efficacy of cannabis-based products, there remains controversy surrounding a concept termed “the entourage effect”. This concept describes a widely reported but poorly-understood synergistic effect of certain cannabinoids when phytocannabinoids are coadministered with other naturally-occurring chemical compounds in the cannabis plant (e.g., flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids). This entourage effect is often cited to explain the superior efficacy observed in some studies of whole-plant-derived cannabis therapeutics as compared to isolated or synthesized individual cannabis constituents.

====Putative receptor targets====
The table highlights several common cannabinoids along with putative receptor targets and therapeutic properties. Exogenous (plant-derived) phytocannabinoids are identified with an asterisk while remaining chemicals represent well-known endocannabinoids (i.e., endogenously produced cannabinoid receptor ligands).

====Neurotransmitter interactions====
In the brain, the canonical mechanism of CB1 receptor activation is a form of short-term synaptic plasticity initiated via retrograde signaling of endogenous CB1 agonists such as 2AG or AEA (two primary endocannabinoids). This mechanism of action is called depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) or depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), depending on the classification of the presynaptic neuron acted upon by the retrograde messenger (&quot;see diagram at left&quot;). In the case of CB1R agonism on the presynaptic membrane of a GABAergic interneuron, activation leads to a net effect of increased activity, while the same activity on a glutamatergic neuron leads to the opposite net effect. The release of other neurotransmitters is also modulated in this way, particularly dopamine, dynorphin, oxytocin, and vasopressin.

===Pharmacokinetics===
When administered orally, CBN demonstrates a similar metabolism to Δ9-THC, with the primary active metabolite produced through the hydrolyzation of C9 as part of first-pass metabolism in the liver. The active metabolite generated via this process is called 11-OH-CBN, which is 2x as potent as CBN, and has demonstrated activity as a weak CB2 antagonist. This metabolism starkly contrasts that of Δ9-THC in terms of potency, given that 11-OH-THC has been reported to have 10× the potency of Δ9-THC.

Due to high lipophilicity and first-pass metabolism, there is low bioavailability of CBN and other cannabinoids following oral administration. CBN metabolism is mediated in part by CYP450 isoforms 2C9 and 3A4. The metabolism of CBN may be catalyzed by UGTs (UDP-glucuronosyltransferases), with a subset of UGT isoforms (1A7, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10, 2B7) identified as potential substrates associated with CBN glucuronidation. The bioavailability of CBN following administration via inhalation (e.g., smoking or vaporizing) is approximately 40% that of intravenous administration.

A small study of six cannabis users found a highly variable half life of 32 ±  17 hours upon intravenous administration. Similar to CBD, CBN is metabolized by the CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 liver enzymes and thus the half-life is sensitive to genetic factors that effect the levels of these enzymes.

==Chemistry==
===Chemical structure===
Cannabinoid receptor agonists are categorized into four groups based on chemical structure. CBN, as one of the many phytocannabinoids derived from &quot;Cannabis Sativa L&quot;, is considered a classical cannabinoid. Other examples of compounds in this group include dibenzopyran derivatives such as Δ9-THC, well-known for underlying the subjective &quot;high&quot; experienced by cannabis users, as well as Δ8-THC, and their synthetic analogs. In contrast, endogenously produced cannabinoids (i.e., endocannabinoids), which also exert effects through CB agonism, are considered eicosanoids, distinguished by notable differences in chemical structure.

Compared to Δ9-THC, one additional aromatic ring confers CBN with a slower and more limited metabolic profile (see ). In contrast to THC, CBN has no double bond isomers nor stereoisomers. CBN can degrade into HU-345 from oxidation. In the case of oral administration of CBN, first-pass metabolism in the liver involves the addition of a hydroxyl group at C9 or C11, increasing the affinity and specificity of CBN for both CB1 and CB2 receptors (see 11-OH-CBN).

==History==
CBN was the first cannabinoid to be isolated from cannabis extract in the late 1800s. Specifically, it was discovered by Barlow Wood, Newton Spivey, and Easterfield in 1896. In the early 1930s, CBN&#x27;s structure was identified by Cahn, marking the first development of a cannabis extract. Its structure and chemical synthesis were achieved by 1940, followed by some of the first preclinical research studies to determine the effects of individual cannabis-derived compounds &quot;in vivo&quot;.

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
CBN is not listed in the schedules set out by the United Nations&#x27; Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs from 1961 nor their Convention on Psychotropic Substances from 1971, so the signatory countries to these international drug control treaties are not required by these treaties to control CBN.

According to the 2018 Farm Bill, extracts from the &quot;Cannabis sativa L.&quot; plant, including CBN, are legal under US federal law as long as they have a delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration of 0.3% or less.

==Biosynthesis==
This diagram represents the biosynthetic and metabolic pathways by which phytocannabinoids (e.g., CBD, THC, CBN) are created in the cannabis plant. Starting with CBG-A, the acidic forms of certain phytocannabinoids are generated via enzymatic conversion. From there, decarboxylation (i.e., catalyzed by combustion or heat) yields the most well-known metabolites present in the cannabis plant. CBN is unique in that it does not arise from a pre-existing acidic form, but rather is generated through the oxidation of THC.

CBN is unique among phytocannabinoids in that its biosynthetic pathway involves conversion directly from Δ9-THC, rather than from an acidic precursor form of CBN (e.g., Δ9-THC arises through decarboxylation of THC-A). CBN can be found in trace amounts in the Cannabis plant, found mostly in cannabis that is aged and stored, allowing for CBN formation through the oxidation of the cannabis plant&#x27;s main psychoactive and intoxicating chemical, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This process of oxidation occurs via exposure to heat, oxygen, and/or light. Although reports are limited, CBN-A has also been measured at very low levels in the cannabis plant, thought to have formed via hydrolyzation of THC-A (&quot;see Phytocannabinoid Biosynthesis diagram, below&quot;).

<text>Samo Chalupka (27 February 1812 – 19 May 1883) was a Slovak Lutheran priest and romantic poet.

== Life ==
Samo Chalupka was a younger brother of Ján Chalupka, another Slovak writer. Samo studied at the Evangelical Lutheran Lyceum in Bratislava and also in Vienna. He studied theology and philosophy. When an uprising against Russia broke out in Poland in 1830, Samo Chalupka interrupted his long studies and fought on the Polish side. He was injured in 1831 and returned to Bratislava. He was the oldest member of the Ľudovít Štúr generation of the Slovak national revival. He was one of the founders and active members of the Czech-Slovak Society.

== Creation ==

He started writing in the so-called Czech biblical language while studying at lyceum in Bratislava. His debut poems were published in the almanac &quot;Plody&quot; (Fruit), in 1836. His works includes themes such as Slovak nature, patriotism and loyalty to his homeland and people. He often used Slovak folk songs in his works. In the 1840s, he joined the Slovak national revival led by Ľudovít Štúr because he wanted to codify the language of his nation. His first poem compilation &quot;Spevy&quot; (Vocals, 1868) was about this topic.

<text>Judy Kuhn (born May 20, 1958) is an American actress, singer and activist, known for her work in musical theatre. A four-time Tony Award nominee, she has released four studio albums and sang the title role in the 1995 film &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, including her rendition of the song &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot;, which won its composers the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

Kuhn made her professional stage debut in 1981 and her Broadway debut in the 1985 original production of the musical &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;. Subsequent Broadway roles include Cosette in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1987), Florence Vassy in &quot;Chess&quot; (1988), and Amalia Balash in &quot;She Loves Me&quot; (1993). For all three, she received Tony Award nominations. She returned to &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in 2007 to play the role of Fantine. She received an Olivier Award nomination for her 1989 West End debut playing Maria/Futura in &quot;Metropolis&quot;. Other musical roles include Betty Schaeffer in the 1993 US premiere production of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; in Los Angeles and her Obie Award winning role as Emmie in the 2001 Off-Broadway production of &quot;Eli&#x27;s Comin&quot;. She received a fourth Tony nomination in 2015 for her role as Helen Bechdel in the original Broadway production of &quot;Fun Home&quot;, and a second Olivier nomination in 2020 for her role as Golde in a London revival of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

==Early life==
Kuhn (pronounced ) was born in New York City to Jewish parents and grew up in Bethesda, Maryland. She attended Georgetown Day School in Washington, D.C. She entered Oberlin College. After taking voice lessons with Frank Farina, Kuhn transferred into the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. Kuhn was also interested in musical theater and other types of music, in addition to classical music for which the Conservatory is best known. She trained as an &quot;operatic soprano&quot; at Oberlin, and graduated in 1981.

After college, she moved to Boston, where she waited tables and studied acting. After appearing in summer stock, Kuhn moved back to New York.

==Stage career==
===1985–1989===
Her Broadway debut was in &quot;Drood&quot;, a Rupert Holmes musical based on the unfinished Charles Dickens novel, in 1985. She played the roles of &quot;Alice / Miss Isabel Yearsley / Succubae&quot; and understudied the title role played by Betty Buckley. Her next appearance on Broadway was in the ill-fated &quot;Rags&quot;, which opened on August 21, 1986, and closed after four performances.

Her next role of Cosette in the 1987 multiple award-winning Broadway production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; brought her the first Tony Award nomination, as Best Featured Actress in a Musical (1987), and the Drama Desk Award (1987) nomination as Outstanding Featured Actress in A Musical.

Kuhn appeared in the Trevor Nunn-directed &quot;Chess&quot;, with music by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus and lyrics by Tim Rice in the 1988 Broadway transfer from the West End, playing one of the main roles (Florence Vassy). Despite the show&#x27;s success in London, Trevor Nunn decided to rework it for Broadway from a pop/rock opera as staged in London into a more conventional musical theater piece with a new book by Richard Nelson. As a result, the new show was greeted with mostly negative reviews and closed after less than a two-month run, on June 25, 1988. Kuhn&#x27;s performance in the musical received praise from the critics. &quot;Her beautiful pop-soprano voice is the show&#x27;s chief pleasure. She acts the sympathetic, gutsy role with spirit and heart&quot;, wrote &quot;Variety&quot;. The &quot;Village Voice&quot; noted that &quot;she pours a river of feeling and lush vocal tone into...the role&quot;. She garnered her second Tony Award nomination, this time as Best Actress in a Musical (1988), and a 1988 Drama Desk Award nomination as Outstanding Actress in a Musical. In addition, The Original Broadway Cast recording of the musical was nominated for a Grammy Award.

She reprised her role of Florence Vassy later in January 1989 in a Carnegie Hall concert performance with the rest of the Broadway cast, which was a benefit for the Emergency Shelter Inc. She also performed in a &quot;Chess&quot; concert version in 1989 in Skellefteå, Sweden, during a chess World Cup final tournament, where she joined with Tommy Körberg and Murray Head, two principal actors from 1986 West End production of the musical.

Kuhn made her London debut in 1989, when she starred in the West End production of &quot;Metropolis&quot;, with Jeremy Kingston, reviewing for &quot;The Times&quot; (London) writing &quot;I greatly enjoyed Kuhn&#x27;s edgy, angular performance.&quot; She received an Olivier Award nomination as Best Actress in a Musical.

===1990–1996===
Kuhn&#x27;s next major Broadway project, &quot;Two Shakespearean Actors&quot; (1992), despite a cast that included Brian Bedford, Frances Conroy, Hope Davis, Victor Garber, Laura Innes and Eric Stoltz, was commercially unsuccessful, closing after 29 regular performances.

In 1993, Kuhn played in the Roundabout Theater Company revival of &quot;She Loves Me&quot;, portraying Amalia Balash, a young Budapest shopgirl who is unaware that the co-worker she despises is the young man with whom she&#x27;s been sharing an anonymous correspondence. Her performance earned her a Tony Award nomination as Best Actress in a Musical. The 1993 Broadway recording of this revival does not feature Kuhn, who left the production before the album was produced.

In December 1993, Kuhn played the role of Betty Schaefer in the U.S premiere production of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; at the Shubert Theatre in Los Angeles. The L.A production recorded a cast album, which is the only unabridged cast recording of the show with the original London recording being cut by thirty minutes.

Regional theatre credits in the early 1990s include &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; at the McCarter Theatre, Princeton, New Jersey, in 1991 as Laura and &quot;Martin Guerre&quot;, at the Hartford Stage Company, Hartford, Connecticut, in 1993. Kuhn reprised her role as Cosette in 1995, for the 10th anniversary concert performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which was released on DVD as &quot;Les Miserables: The Dream Cast in Concert&quot;.

===1997–2006===
Kuhn appeared in the Broadway concert &quot;King David&quot; which was a 1997 Disney project with a book and lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Alan Menken and directed by Mike Ockrent. It played for a nine-performance limited run at the New Amsterdam Theatre.

Kuhn sang in the second annual benefit concert for The Actors&#x27; Fund of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; in September 2002 at the New Amsterdam Theatre, with different actresses taking on the role of Fanny Brice. She sang &quot;Who Are You Now?&quot; and &quot;People&quot; of which Andrew Gans of &quot;Playbill&quot; wrote: she &quot;provided an intense, moving, full-voiced &#x27;People,&#x27; sensationally belting &#x27;are the luckiest peeeeeeople (wow!) in the wooorld&#x27;.&quot;

Kuhn&#x27;s Off-Broadway and regional theater credits in this period include: &quot;As Thousands Cheer&quot; (1998) Off-Broadway at the Drama Dept., Greenwich House Theater; &quot;Strike up the Band&quot; (1998) Off-Broadway Encores! Concerts at New York City Center; the title role in &quot;The Ballad of Little Jo&quot; (2000) at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago; &quot;Eli&#x27;s Comin&quot; (2001) Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre Company (for which she won an Obie Award); &quot;The Highest Yellow&quot; (2004) at the Signature Theater in Virginia; and &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (2005) In a new adaption by Craig Lucas at the Intiman Theatre in Seattle, Washington.

===2007–present===
On October 23, 2007, Kuhn returned to the Broadway production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; after 20 years, this time assuming the role of Fantine. She succeeded Lea Salonga and remained with the show until the revival ended on January 6, 2008.

Kuhn portrayed Fosca in the Off-Broadway Classic Stage Company revival of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical &quot;Passion&quot; from its opening in February 2013 through its scheduled closing in April 2013. Kuhn had previously played Fosca in the Stephen Sondheim celebration production in 2002 at the Kennedy Center.

In 2013, Kuhn originated the role of Helen Bechdel in the off-Broadway Public Theater production of the musical &quot;Fun Home&quot;, which began its run September 30, 2013 and opened officially on October 22, 2013. The run was extended multiple times and closed on January 12, 2014. She played the same role in the Broadway production, which ran from April 2015 to September 10, 2016, at the Circle in the Square.

Kuhn played the role of &quot;Golde&quot; in the Broadway revival of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, starting on November 22, 2016. She played Golde in the Menier Chocolate Factory (London) production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; which began on November 23, 2018, and ran to March 9, 2019.

From March to May 2024, Kuhn appeared in the musical &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; by Daniel Goldstein and Michael Friedman at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.

In June 2024, Kuhn portrayed Ida Straus in &quot;Titanic&quot; at New York City Center.

==Career outside theatre==
Her television credits include &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot;, &quot;All My Children&quot; and two PBS shows: &quot;My Favorite Broadway: The Leading Ladies&quot; (recorded 1998, released 1999) and &quot;In Performance at the White House: A Tribute to Broadway – The Shows&quot; in March 1988.

Kuhn sang the title role in the 1995 Disney animated film &quot;Pocahontas&quot;. The film&#x27;s score won an Academy Award, and the soundtrack reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 2.5 million copies. The film included Kuhn&#x27;s rendition of the song &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Grammy Award.

Kuhn also sang as Pocahontas in the straight-to-video sequel &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot;, in &quot;If You Can Dream&quot;, a Disney Princess song, and the 2023 live-action/animated short &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;. Kuhn briefly appeared in the film &quot;Long Time Since&quot; (1998) and supplied the vocals for the movie&#x27;s soundtrack, which includes a rendition of Auld Lang Syne.

She has performed in concert at Carnegie Hall, Alice Tully Hall, and Avery Fisher Hall in Manhattan, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. She has performed in a solo cabaret/nightclub act at, for example, Joe&#x27;s Pub at the Public Theater in October 2007 and the Iridium in New York in January 2008.

Her first solo album, &quot;Just in Time: Judy Kuhn Sings Jule Styne&quot;, was released on January 31, 1995. Kuhn&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Serious Playground: The Songs of Laura Nyro&quot;, was released on October 2, 2007. In 2013, she released her third album &quot;All This Happiness&quot;, which contains pop, jazz, cabaret, and blues songs, along with the title song of the album, from the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Passion&quot;.

Kuhn also teaches a song interpretation class at Michael Howard Studios in New York City, where she studied earlier in her career. Andrew Gans of &quot;Playbill&quot; wrote that Kuhn &quot;possesses one of the richest and most exciting instruments around; it is also an extremely versatile and rangy voice&quot; and that Kuhn has &quot;remarkable interpretive skills&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kuhn lives with her husband, David Schwab, in New York City. They have one daughter, Anna.

<doc id="1231986" wikidata="Q653971" url="?curid=1231986" title="Indigestion">
<text>Indigestion, also known as dyspepsia or upset stomach, is a condition of impaired digestion. Symptoms may include upper abdominal fullness, heartburn, nausea, belching, or upper abdominal pain. People may also experience feeling full earlier than expected when eating. Indigestion is relatively common, affecting 20% of people at some point during their life, and is frequently caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or gastritis.

Indigestion is subcategorized as either &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;functional dyspepsia&quot;, but making the diagnosis can prove challenging for physicians. Organic indigestion is the result of an underlying disease, such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (an ulcer of the stomach or duodenum), or cancer. Functional indigestion (previously called non-ulcer dyspepsia) is indigestion without evidence of underlying disease. Functional indigestion is estimated to affect about 15% of the general population in western countries and accounts for a majority of dyspepsia cases.

In patients who are 60 or older, or who have worrisome symptoms such as trouble swallowing, weight loss, or blood loss, an endoscopy (a procedure whereby a camera attached to a flexible tube is inserted down the throat and into the stomach) is recommended to further assess and find a potential cause. In patients younger than 60 years of age, testing for the bacteria &quot;H. pylori&quot; and if positive, treatment of the infection is recommended.

==Signs and symptoms==

=== Symptoms ===
Patients experiencing indigestion likely report one, a combination of, or all of the following symptoms:
* upper abdominal pain or discomfort
* bloating
* early satiety
* postprandial fullness
* nausea with or without vomiting
* anorexia
* regurgitation
* belching

=== Signs ===
There may be abdominal tenderness, but this finding is nonspecific and is not required to make a diagnosis. However, there are physical exam signs that may point to a different diagnosis and underlying cause for a patient&#x27;s reported discomfort. A positive Carnett sign (focal tenderness that increases with abdominal wall contraction and palpation) suggests an etiology involving the abdominal wall musculature. Cutaneous dermatomal distribution of pain may suggest a thoracic polyradiculopathy. Tenderness to palpation over the right upper quadrant, or Murphy&#x27;s sign, may suggest cholecystitis or gallbladder inflammation.

=== Alarm symptoms ===
Also known as &quot;Alarm features&quot;, &quot;alert features&quot;, &quot;red flags&quot;, or &quot;warning signs&quot; in gastrointestinal (GI) literature.

Alarm features are thought to be associated with serious gastroenterologic disease and include:
* chronic gastrointestinal bleeding
* progressive unintentional weight loss
* progressive difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
* persistent vomiting
* Iron deficiency anemia
* Vitamin B12 deficiency (Pernicious anemia)
* epigastric mass

==Cause==
Indigestion is a diagnosis related to a combination of symptoms that can be attributed to &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; causes. Organic dyspepsia should have pathological findings upon endoscopy, like an ulcer in the stomach lining in peptic ulcer disease. Functional dyspepsia is unlikely to be detected on endoscopy but can be broken down into two subtypes, epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and post-prandial distress syndrome (PDS). In addition, indigestion could be caused by medications, food, or other disease processes.

Psychosomatic and cognitive factors are important in the evaluation of people with chronic dyspepsia. Studies have shown a high occurrence of mental disorders, notably anxiety and depression, amongst patients with dyspepsia; however, there is little evidence to prove causation.

=== Organic dyspepsia ===

====Esophagitis====
Esophagitis is an inflammation of the esophagus, most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is defined by the sensation of &quot;heartburn&quot; or a burning sensation in the chest as a result of inappropriate relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter at the site where the esophagus connects to the stomach. It is often treated with proton pump inhibitors. If left untreated, the chronic damage to the esophageal tissues poses a risk of developing cancer. A meta-analysis showed risk factors for developing GERD included age equal to or greater than 50, smoking, the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory medications, and obesity.

====Gastritis====
Common causes of gastritis include peptic ulcer disease, infection, or medications.

=====Peptic ulcer disease=====
Gastric and duodenal ulcers are the defining feature of peptic ulcer disease (PUD). PUD is most commonly caused by an infection with &quot;H. pylori&quot; or NSAID use.

====== &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; (&quot;H. pylori&quot;) infection ======
The role of &quot;H. pylori&quot; in functional dyspepsia is controversial, and treatment for &quot;H. pylori&quot; may not lead to complete improvement of a patient&#x27;s dyspepsia. However, a recent systemic review and meta-analysis of 29 studies published in 2022 suggests that successful treatment of &quot;H. pylori&quot; modestly improves indigestion symptoms.

====Pancreatobiliary disease====
These include cholelithiasis, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer.

====Duodenal micro-inflammation====
Duodenal micro-inflammation caused by an altered duodenal gut microbiota, reactions to foods (mainly gluten proteins) or infections may induce dyspepsia symptoms in a subset of people.

===Functional dyspepsia===

Functional dyspepsia is a common cause of chronic heartburn. More than 70% of people have no obvious organic cause for their symptoms after evaluation. Symptoms may arise from a complex interaction of increased visceral afferent sensitivity, gastric delayed emptying (gastroparesis) or impaired accommodation to food. Diagnostic criteria for functional dyspepsia categorize it into two subtypes by symptom: epigastric pain syndrome and post-prandial distress syndrome. Anxiety is also associated with functional dyspepsia. In some people, it appears before the onset of gut symptoms; in other cases, anxiety develops after onset of the disorder, which suggests that a gut-driven brain disorder may be a possible cause. Although benign, these symptoms may be chronic and difficult to treat.

==== Epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) ====
Defined by stomach pain and/or burning that interferes with daily life, without any evidence of organic disease.

==== Post-prandial distress syndrome (PDS) ====
Defined by post-prandial fullness or early satiation that interferes with daily life, without any evidence of organic disease.

===Food, herb, or drug intolerance===
Acute, self-limited dyspepsia may be caused by overeating, eating too quickly, eating high-fat foods, eating during stressful situations, or drinking too much alcohol or coffee. Many medications cause dyspepsia, including aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics (metronidazole, macrolides), bronchodilators (theophylline), diabetes drugs (acarbose, metformin, Alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, amylin analogs, GLP-1 receptor antagonists), antihypertensive medications (angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, Angiotensin II receptor antagonist), cholesterol-lowering agents (niacin, fibrates), neuropsychiatric medications (cholinesterase inhibitors [donepezil, rivastigmine]), SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline), serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine, duloxetine), Parkinson drugs (Dopamine agonist, monoamine oxidase [MAO]-B inhibitors), weight-loss medications (orlistat), corticosteroids, estrogens, digoxin, iron, and opioids. Common herbs have also been shown to cause indigestion, like white willow berry, garlic, ginkgo, chaste tree berry, saw palmetto, and feverfew. Studies have shown that wheat and dietary fats can contribute to indigestion and suggest foods high in short-chain carbohydrates (FODMAP) may be associated with dyspepsia. This suggests reducing or consuming a gluten-free, low-fat, and/or FODMAP diet may improve symptoms. Additionally, some people may experience dyspepsia when eating certain spices or spicy food as well as foods like peppers, chocolate, citrus, and fish.

===Systemic diseases===
There are a number of systemic diseases that may involve dyspepsia, including coronary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hyperparathyroidism, thyroid disease, and chronic kidney disease.

===Post-infectious causes of dyspepsia===
Gastroenteritis increases the risk of developing chronic dyspepsia. Post-infectious dyspepsia is the term given when dyspepsia occurs after an acute gastroenteritis infection. It is believed that the underlying causes of post-infectious IBS and post-infectious dyspepsia may be similar and represent different aspects of the same pathophysiology.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology for indigestion is not well understood; however, there are many theories. For example, there are studies that suggest a gut-brain interaction, as patients who received an antibiotic saw a reduction in their indigestion symptoms. Other theories propose issues with gut motility, a hypersensitivity of gut viscera, and imbalance of the microbiome. A genetic predisposition is plausible, but there is limited evidence to support this theory.

==Diagnosis==

A diagnosis for indigestion is based on symptoms, with a possible need for more diagnostic tests. In younger patients (less than 60 years of age) without red flags (e.g., weight loss), it is recommended to test for H. pylori noninvasively, followed by treatment with antibiotics in those who test positively. A negative test warrants discussing additional treatments, like proton pump inhibitors, with your doctor. An upper GI endoscopy may also be recommended. In older patients (60 or older), an endoscopy is often the next step in finding out the cause of newly onset indigestion regardless of the presence of alarm symptoms. However, for all patients regardless of age, an official diagnosis requires symptoms to have started at least 6 months ago with a frequency of at least once a week over the last 3 months.

==Treatment==
Functional and organic dyspepsia have similar treatments. Traditional therapies used for this diagnosis include lifestyle modification (e.g., diet), antacids, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2-receptor antagonists (H2-RAs), prokinetic agents, and antiflatulents. PPIs and H2-RAs are often first-line therapies for treating dyspepsia, having shown to be better than placebo medications. Anti-depressants, notably tricyclic antidepressants, have been tested on patients who do not respond to traditional therapies with some benefits, though the research is of poor quality and adverse affects are noted.

===Diet===
A lifestyle change that may help with indigestion is a change in diet, such as a stable and consistent eating schedule and slowing the pace of eating. Additionally, there are studies that support a reduction in the consumption of fats may also alleviate dyspepsia. While some studies suggest a correlation between dyspepsia and celiac disease, not everyone with indigestion needs to refrain from gluten in their diet. However, a gluten-free diet can relieve the symptoms in some patients without celiac disease. Lastly, a FODMAPs diet or diet low/free from certain complex sugars and sugar alcohols has also been shown to be potentially beneficial in patients with indigestion.

===Acid suppression===
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were found to be better than placebo in a literature review, especially when looking at long-term symptom reduction. H2 receptor antagonists (H2-RAs) have similar effect on symptoms reduction when compared to PPIs. However, there is little evidence to support prokinetic agents are an appropriate treatment for dyspepsia.

Currently, PPIs are FDA indicated for erosive esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, eradication of H. pylori, duodenal and gastric ulcers, and NSAID-induced ulcer healing and prevention, but not functional dyspepsia.

===Prokinetics===
Prokinetics (medications focused on increasing gut motility), such as metoclopramide or erythromycin, has a history of use as a secondary treatment for dyspepsia. While multiple studies show that it is more effective than placebo, there are multiple concerns about the side effects surrounding the long-term use of these medications.

===Alternative medicine===
A 2021 meta-analysis concluded that herbal remedies, like menthacarin (a combination of peppermint and caraway oils), ginger, artichoke, licorice, and jollab (a combination of rose water, saffron, and candy sugar), may be as beneficial as conventional therapies when treating dyspepsia symptoms. However, it is important to note that herbal products are not regulated by the FDA and therefore it is difficult to assess the quality and safety of the ingredients found in alternative medications.

==Epidemiology==
Indigestion is a common problem and frequent reason for primary care physicians to refer patients to GI specialists. Worldwide, dyspepsia affects about a third of the population. It can affect a person&#x27;s quality of life even if the symptoms within themselves are usually not life-threatening. Additionally, the financial burden on the patient and healthcare system is costly - patients with dyspepsia were more likely to have lower work productivity and higher healthcare costs compared to those without indigestion. Risk factors include NSAID-use, H. pylori infection, and smoking.

<text>Timothy John Page (25 May 1944 – 24 August 2022) was a British photographer. He was noted for the photos he took of the Vietnam War, and was later based in Brisbane, Australia.

==Early life==
Page was born John Spencer Russell in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 25 May 1944. He did not know his birth mother; his biological father was killed in a torpedo attack in the Arctic while serving in the Royal Navy during World War II and Page was put up for adoption after he was born. His adoptive father worked as an accountant; his adoptive mother was a housewife. Page was raised in Orpington, and left England in 1962 to make his way overland driving through Europe, Pakistan, India, Burma, Thailand and Laos. Without money in Laos, he found work as an agricultural advisor for USAID.

==Career==
Page began work as a press photographer in Laos stringing for UPI and AFP, having taught himself photography. His exclusive photographs of an attempted coup d&#x27;état in Laos in 1965 for UPI got him a staff position in the Saigon bureau of the news agency. He is celebrated for his work as a freelance accredited press photographer in Vietnam and Cambodia during the 1960s, also finding time to cover the Six-Day War in the Middle East in 1967. Due to a near-death experience in the early 1960s, he came to view his life as &quot;free time&quot;. This led him to take photographs in dangerous situations where other journalists would not venture. Similarly, Page was captivated by the excitement and glamour of warfare, which helped contribute to the style of photographs he is acclaimed for.

By late 1965 Page was sharing a house at 47 Bui Thi Xuan, Saigon, with Leonardo Caparros and fellow correspondents Simon Dring, Martin Stuart-Fox and Steve Northup, known as &quot;Frankie&#x27;s House&quot; after the resident Vietnamese houseboy. Frankie&#x27;s House became a social club for a group of correspondents between field assignments and their friends who smoked marijuana there. Page did not shy away from the drug culture he was involved in during his time in Vietnam, devoting a large amount of his book &quot;Page after Page&quot; to it. In &quot;Dispatches,&quot; Michael Herr wrote of Page as the most &quot;extravagant&quot; of the &quot;wigged-out crazies running around Vietnam&quot;, due in most respects to the amount of drugs that he enjoyed taking. His unusual personality was part of the inspiration for the character of the journalist played by Dennis Hopper in &quot;Apocalypse Now.&quot;

In 1965, shortly after Page got his first publication in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, Beryl Fox was filming &quot;The Mills of the Gods: Vietnam&quot; for the CBC series &quot;Document&quot;. During three weeks of filming, Page was hired to shoot some of the documentary. At a time when the anti-war movement was in its infancy, the film helped to open conversations around the world. In 1966, the film won the George Polk Award for Best Television Documentary and the Canadian Film Award for Film of the Year.

Page was injured in action four times. The first, in September 1965, was in Chu Lai where he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and stomach; the second was in Da Nang during the 1966 Buddhist riots, where he received more shrapnel wounds to the head, back, and arms; the third in August 1966 happened in the South China sea, where he was on board the Coast Guard cutter , when it was mistaken for a Viet Cong ship, and U.S. Air Force pilots strafed the vessel, leaving Page adrift at sea with over two hundred wounds. Lastly, in April 1969, Page jumped out of a helicopter to help load wounded soldiers. At the same time, a sergeant stepped on a mine close by, sending a 2-inch piece of shrapnel into Page&#x27;s head. This list of injuries led his colleagues in the field to joke that he would never make it to 23 years of age. He spent the next year in the United States undergoing extensive neuro-surgery. During recovery he became closely involved with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War and worked as a caregiver for amputees, traumatically shocked and stressed young men. One of these was Ron Kovic. Richard Boyle was also friends with Kovic and Page at this time.

On 9 December 1967, Page was arrested in New Haven, Connecticut, along with fellow journalists Mike Zwerin and Yvonne Chabrier at the infamous Doors concert where Jim Morrison was arrested onstage. Charges against all four were dropped due to lack of evidence.

Page had a part in the &quot;Papers on a war&quot;, which became the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, released by Daniel Ellsberg who had stayed at Frankie&#x27;s House. Ellsberg gave Page a copy inscribed &quot;To Tim who may well have changed the course of the war&quot;.

In the 1970s Page worked as a freelance photographer for music magazines such as &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In January 1973 Page spent time with Bill Cardoso and Hunter S. Thompson, who was covering Super Bowl VII. Page photographed Thompson riding a Black Shadow Motorbike, but &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; lost the negatives. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wanted Page to go back to Vietnam with Thompson in 1975 but Thompson said Page was too crazy. During Page&#x27;s recovery in the spring of 1970 he learnt of the capture of his best friend, roommate and fellow photo-journalist Sean Flynn in Cambodia. Throughout the 1970s and 80s he tried to discover Flynn&#x27;s fate and final resting place and wanted to erect a memorial to all those in the media who either were killed or went missing in the war. This led him to found the Indochina Media Memorial Foundation and was the genesis for the book &quot;Requiem&quot;, co-edited with fellow Vietnam War photographer Horst Faas. &quot;Requiem&quot; won the George Polk Book Award and the Robert Capa Gold Medal in 1997. Page&#x27;s quest to clear up the mystery of Flynn&#x27;s fate continued into his later years.

Page&#x27;s book &quot;Requiem&quot; contains photographs taken by all of the photographers and journalists killed during the Vietnamese wars against the Japanese, French and Americans. &quot;Requiem&quot; has become since early 2000 a travelling photographic exhibition placed under the custody of the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film. The exhibition has been presented in Vietnam&#x27;s War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, as well as in New York City, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Tokyo, Hanoi, Lausanne, and London. In 2011, it was selected to be the main exhibition of the Month of Photography Asia in Singapore.

Page also covered wars in Israel, Bosnia and Afghanistan. As a peace activist he was patron of organisations such as Mine Action Group and Soldier On, a veterans&#x27; support group in Australia. He was keen to &quot;highlight the folly of war&quot;, stating that &quot;the only good war photograph is an anti-war photograph&quot;.

==Later years==
Page was the subject of many documentaries and two films, and the author of many books. He lived in Brisbane, Australia, having retired from covering wars. He was an adjunct professor of photojournalism at Griffith University.

During the 2010–2011 Queensland floods, Page&#x27;s archives in his basement were damaged, highlighting at the time the need for a longer-term home for what he estimated were three-quarters of a million images accumulated over his 45-year career.

The Australian War Memorial holds a collection of Page&#x27;s photography.

<doc id="1232013" wikidata="Q5275018" url="?curid=1232013" title="Diesel Sweeties">
<text>Diesel Sweeties is known as a webcomic and former newspaper comic strip written by Richard Stevens III (R Stevens). The comic began in 2000, originally hosted at robotstories.com. From January 2007 until August 2008 it was syndicated to over 20 United States newspapers, including major daily newspapers like &quot;The Detroit News&quot; and &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;.

Material from &quot;Diesel Sweeties&quot; appears in Ted Rall&#x27;s &quot;,&quot; along with other webcomics such as &quot;Cat and Girl&quot;, &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot;, &quot;Boy on a Stick and Slither&quot;, &quot;Fetus-X&quot;, and &quot;The Perry Bible Fellowship&quot;.

Stevens is a co-founder of the Dumbrella alliance of webcomic artists. Stephens is one of the few professional webcomic artists, who has since 2002 supported himself through online sales of merchandise related to his comics.

==Newspaper syndication==
In late 2006, Richard Stevens announced that &quot;Diesel Sweeties&quot; would be syndicated to newspapers through United Features Syndicate. Some newspapers began running the strip on 1 January 2007, to replace &quot;FoxTrot&quot; by Bill Amend, which had ended its daily run, .
The regular distribution began a week later, on 8 January. On 26 June 2008, Stevens announced that the print run of &quot;Diesel Sweeties&quot; would end on 10 August of that year. Stephens had doubled his comics workload by creating separate strips for the newspaper and web versions of Diesel Sweeties, and had produced about 600 strips specifically for the newspapers. Stevens cited exhaustion from doing a dozen strips per week, as well as the fact that the majority of his income remained tied to the website. Stevens estimated that &quot;about 50 papers ran DS at one point or another.&quot;

==Format==
For the first several years, the comic consisted of four square panels of dialogue in a two-by-two grid, with a punchline (often a non sequitur, pun, or pop culture reference) in the final panel. In 2005 Stevens abandoned this traditional form and began consistently publishing strips with more panels in slightly more varied configurations. Single panels of the strip are occasionally animated. The comic depicts a world where robots exist alongside humans, with human-robot romantic and sexual relationships commonplace. Although there is some character development and the occasional story arc, most strips are largely self-contained. Recurring themes include annual Halloween strips, featuring characters from the comic in costume.

==Characters==
&quot;Diesel Sweeties&quot; incorporates many characters from other fictional works, from the real world, and introduces many original characters.

===Main characters (online version)===
The main characters in &quot;Diesel Sweeties&quot; are:
* Clango Cyclotron, an emotional robot. Clango was introduced as the boyfriend of Maura Glee, the relationship later ended, and he moved on to dating Pale Suzie. Pale Suzie later shot him with an orbital laser when she suspected he was cheating on her with Maura. He deliberately erased his memory so that he &quot;can be even more innocent than (he) is now!&quot; Unfortunately Indie Rock Pete intentionally broke the backup CD, and Clango had to be restarted with an old boot disk from his days with Maura. He thinks he is still dating Maura. He was adopted by human parents, and has several famous human aunts and uncles, including Steve Wozniak, Beck, Courtney Love, and Stan Lee. Introduced in strip #1.
* Maura Demeter Glee (full name revealed in strip 1698), an alcoholic ex-pornstar. Maura was introduced as Clango&#x27;s girlfriend, and she later got dumped for cheating on him. After Clango had his memory erased without a recent backup, Maura provided an old one and thus they are now back together. Introduced in strip #1. After an around the world bender, Maura was allegedly shipped back to Clango as a brain in a jar, a situation resolved as of Friday 5 December 2008. (The jar turned out to contain Billy Brainjar, a minor character.)
* Indie Rock Pete (later found to be named &quot;Peter Gaylord Weiner&quot;, much to his disdain in strip #1241), a poseur obsessed with the idea of maintaining a façade of indie cred. Attempts to manipulate the other characters, but usually fails. Pete works as a substitute high school teacher, and developed a crush on Frieda Berger, one of his students, before finding out she was in high school. Introduced in strip #2. Apparently killed by gunshot to the head in strip #2307, but the strip&#x27;s title (&quot;not cannon&quot;), may be a hint that it is not real, as is his appearances in strips after the incident #2309 anon. 
* Lil&#x27; Sis, Maura&#x27;s younger sister. Worked at a comic store for a time. Her name is generally not mentioned, but was once revealed as &quot;Persephone Marie&quot; in strip #1241. Was once featured in &quot;Questionable Content&quot; strip #171) as the girlfriend of a minor character. Introduced in strip #5.
*Electron Mike, an extreme technophile who listens to techno and collects iPods. Has a hate/hate relationship with Red Robot, and would rather recompile his Linux kernel than introduce effort into anything non-electronic. Introduced in strip #558.
* Metal Steve (found to have the last name &quot;Wozniak&quot; in strip #1819), a mullet-sporting rocker. The virginal yin to Pete&#x27;s lecherous yang. He has had ongoing flirtations with both Lil Sis and Pale Suzie, but neither has successfully bedded him. Implied to be unusually well-endowed (strip #767); he was briefly recruited by Maura as a porn star for masturbation movies, but was run out of the business for refusing to work with a partner. Married Allie V. (Allison Vegetoksis) a dreadlocked vegetarian from L.A. that he &quot;corrupted&quot; with bacon, after his refusal for &quot;dirty desertie&quot; (he was saving himself for marriage), she proposed and they married (strip #2108). Introduced in strip #76.
* Pale Suzie, a cheerful goth chick and occasional furry who went on a date with Clango, while he and Maura were &quot;on a break&quot;. She dated Clango for several months, but after she accused Clango of cheating on her with Maura (after they had been playing Wii together), he had his memory erased so that he &quot;can be even more innocent than (he) is now!&quot;. Indie Rock Pete broke the backup CD and Clango is unaware he dated Pale Suzie. She is in a relationship with Charles. Introduced in strip #436.
* Red Robot #C-63, a robot dedicated to the crushing of human (written as &quot;hu-mans&quot;), although he has also been known to date them on occasion. He is wealthy after making a deal with Maura. Introduced in strip #24.
* OtaKate, a blue-haired otaku girl introduced in strip 1711 as a result of Pale Suzie&#x27;s online dating mishap (Suzie thought Kate was a man pretending to be a woman). Probably bisexual. Through her profile on &quot;DeathwishDamsels.com&quot; (a play on SuicideGirls, she meets Indie Rock Pete. Later she becomes involved with Electron Mike, but dumps Mike hoping to bed Pale Suzie. After Suzie rejects her, she decides on &quot;stuffy older men&quot; and starts dating &quot;Uncle Larry&quot;, a philatelist-porn producer.
* Freyja Tryggvason, a tall, dark-haired girl (&quot;The Strongest Woman on Earth&quot;) introduced in strip 1973 answering Indie Rock Pete&#x27;s ad for a drummer in his band. Her background is explained in strip 1976 where we are told she is &quot;The daughter of a Norwegian Diplomat and an all-star women&#x27;s basketball coach, raised on genetically modified corn in Nebraska, she has always been the tallest girl around&quot;. She is Red Robot #C-63&#x27;s current girlfriend.
* Allie Vegetoksis, a vegan, non-violent, dreadlocked, trustafarian hippie. She is Metal Steve&#x27;s wife.

===Main characters (newspaper version)===

Comics.com described the strip as &quot;reformatted&quot; for family newspapers.

*Clango Cyclotron is a robot, a nice guy, and as red-blooded a male as a robot can be. He has been dating Maura Glee for some time and trying his best to understand humans. 
*Maura Glee is a retired dot-com investor (or porn star) who cashed out before the market went south in, presumably, 2000. She is bored, but loves Clango, to the exclusion of others, especially human males. Her hobbies include drinking and more drinking.
*Indie Rock Pete composes music that nobody will hear. He manages a video store that refuses to rent movies that have been released on DVD. He discusses matters of the world with Clango.
*Lil&#x27; Sis is Maura&#x27;s younger sister. She has recently moved in with Indie Rock Pete, but alas, it is platonic. She longs for Pete, but he&#x27;s not buying. 
*Metal Steve is a real musician, a true rocker. Lil&#x27; Sis is interested in him as well. 
*Red Robot #C-63 has a mission, which is to kill every human on the planet. This, however, does not prevent him from exchanging bits of philosophy with the others in the pixelated crew, human and otherwise. 
*Mr. Bear appears infrequently.

Other new characters for the newspaper version included TV, Coffee Maker, and Kitten. Together, they rule the household.

<doc id="1232022" wikidata="Q1611229" url="?curid=1232022" title="Green Knight">
<text>The Green Knight (, , ) is a heroic character of the Matter of Britain, originating in the 14th-century poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; and the related medieval work &quot;The Greene Knight&quot;. His true name is revealed to be Bertilak de Hautdesert (spelled in some translations as &quot;Bercilak&quot; or &quot;Bernlak&quot;) in &quot;Sir Gawain&quot;, while &quot;The Greene Knight&quot; names him &quot;Bredbeddle&quot;. The Green Knight later features as one of Arthur&#x27;s greatest champions in the fragmentary ballad &quot;King Arthur and King Cornwall&quot;, again with the name &quot;Bredbeddle&quot;.

In &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, Bertilak is transformed into the Green Knight by Morgan le Fay, a traditional adversary of King Arthur, to test his court. However, in &quot;The Greene Knight&quot;, he is transformed by a different woman for the same purpose. In both stories, he sends his wife to seduce Gawain as a further test. The &quot;King Arthur and King Cornwall&quot; ballad portrays him as an exorcist and one of the most powerful knights of Arthur&#x27;s court. His wider role in Arthurian literature includes being a judge and tester of knights, and as such, the other characters consider him as friendly but terrifying and somewhat mysterious.

In &quot;Sir Gawain&quot;, the Green Knight is so called because his skin and clothes are green. The meaning of his greenness has puzzled scholars. Some identify him as the Green Man, a vegetation being of medieval art; others as a recollection of a figure from Celtic mythology; a Christian &quot;pagan&quot; symbol – the personified Devil. The medievalist C. S. Lewis said the character was &quot;as vivid and concrete as any image in literature.&quot; Scholar J. A. Burrow called him the &quot;most difficult character&quot; to interpret.

==Historical context==
The earliest appearance of the Green Knight is in the late 14th-century alliterative poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, which survives in only one manuscript along with other poems by the same author, the so-called Pearl Poet. This poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, writer of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, although the two wrote in different parts of England. The later poem, &quot;The Greene Knight&quot;, is a late medieval rhyming romance that likely predates its only surviving copy: the 17th-century Percy Folio. The other work featuring the Green Knight, the later ballad &quot;King Arthur and King Cornwall&quot;, also survives only in the Percy Folio manuscript. Its date of composition is uncertain, as it may be a version of an earlier story, or possibly a product of the 17th century.

==Role in Arthurian literature==

In &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, the Green Knight appears before Arthur&#x27;s court during a Christmas feast, holding a bough of holly in one hand and a battle axe in the other. Despite disclaim of war, the knight issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him once with his axe, with the condition that he return the blow the next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel at the stipulated time.

The Knight features next as Bertilak de Hautedesert, lord of a large castle, Gawain&#x27;s host before his arrival at the Green Chapel. At Bertilak&#x27;s castle, Gawain is submitted to tests of his loyalty and chastity, wherein Bertilak sends his wife to seduce Gawain and arranges that each time Bertilak gains prey in hunting, or Gawain any gift in the castle, each shall exchange his gain for the other&#x27;s. At New Year&#x27;s Day, Gawain departs to the Green Chapel, and bends to receive his blow, only to have the Green Knight feint two blows, then barely nick him on the third. He then reveals that he is Bertilak, and that Morgan le Fay had given him the double identity to test Gawain and Arthur.

&quot;The Greene Knight&quot; tells the same story as &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, with a few differences. Notably, the knight, here named &quot;Bredbeddle&quot;, is only wearing green, not green-skinned himself. The poem also states the knight has been asked by his wife&#x27;s mother (not Morgan in this version) to trick Gawain. He agrees because he knows his wife is secretly in love with Gawain, and hopes to deceive both. Gawain falters in accepting a girdle from her, and the Green Knight&#x27;s purpose is fulfilled in a small sense. In the end, he acknowledges Gawain&#x27;s ability and asks to accompany him to Arthur&#x27;s court.

In &quot;King Arthur and King Cornwall&quot;, the Green Knight again features as Bredbeddle, and is depicted as one of Arthur&#x27;s knights. He offers to help Arthur fight a mysterious sprite (controlled by the magician, King Cornwall) which has entered his chamber. When physical attacks fail, Bredbeddle uses a sacred text to subdue it. The Green Knight eventually gains so much control over the sprite through this text that he convinces it to take a sword and strike off its master&#x27;s head.

==Etymologies==
The name &quot;Bertilak&quot; may derive from &quot;bachlach&quot;, a Celtic word meaning &quot;churl&quot; (i.e. rogueish, unmannerly), or from &quot;bresalak&quot;, meaning &quot;contentious&quot;. The Old French word &quot;bertolais&quot; is a form of &quot;Bertilak&quot; in the Arthurian tale &quot;Merlin&quot; from the Lancelot-Grail cycle. Notably, the &#x27;Bert-&#x27; prefix means &#x27;bright&#x27;, and the &#x27;-lak&#x27; can mean either &#x27;lake&#x27; or &quot;play, sport, fun, etc&quot;. &quot;Hautdesert&quot; probably comes from a mix of both Old French and Celtic words meaning &quot;High Wasteland&quot; or &quot;High Hermitage&quot;. It may also have an association with &quot;desirete&quot; meaning &quot;disinherited&quot; (i.e. from the Round Table).

==Similar or derivative characters==

===Green Knights in other stories===
Characters similar to the Green Knight appear in several other works. In Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, for example, Gawain&#x27;s brother Gareth defeats four brothers in different coloured armour, including a &quot;Grene Knyght&quot; named Sir Partolope. The three who survive the encounter eventually join the Round Table and appear several further times in the text. The stories of Saladin feature a certain &quot;Green Knight&quot;; a Spanish warrior (maybe from Castile, according to an Arab source) in a shield vert and a helmet adorned with stag horns. Saladin tries to make him part of his personal guard.
Similarly, a &quot;Chevalier Vert&quot; appears in the Chronicle of Ernoul during the recollection of events following the capture of Jerusalem in 1187; here, he is identified as a Spanish knight who earned this nickname from the Muslims due to his eccentric apparel.

Some researchers have considered an association with Islamic tales. The figure of Al-Khidr () in the Qur&#x27;an is called the &quot;Green Man&quot; as the only man to have drunk the water of life, which in some versions of the story turns him green. He tests Moses three times by doing seemingly evil acts, which are eventually revealed to be noble deeds to prevent greater evils or reveal great goods. Both the Arthurian Green Knight and Al-Khidr serve as teachers to holy men (Gawain/Moses), who thrice tested their faith and obedience. It has been suggested that the character of the Green Knight may be a literary descendant of Al-Khidr, brought to Europe with the Crusaders and blended with Celtic and Arthurian imagery.

===Characters fulfilling similar roles===
The beheading game appears in a number of tales, the earliest being the Middle Irish tale &quot;Bricriu&#x27;s Feast&quot;. The challenger in this story is named &quot;Fear&quot;, a &quot;bachlach&quot; (churl), and is identified as Cú Roí (a superhuman king of Munster in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology) in disguise. He challenges three warriors to his game, only to have them run from the return blow, until the hero Cú Chulainn accepts the challenge. With Cú Chulainn under his axe, this antagonist also feints three blows before letting the hero go. In the Irish version, the cloak of the churl is described as &quot;glas&quot;, which means green. In the &quot;Life of Caradoc&quot;, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, another similar challenge is issued. In this story, a notable difference is that Caradoc&#x27;s challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. The French romances &quot;La Mule sans frein&quot; and &quot;Hunbaut&quot; and the Middle High German epic poem &quot;Diu Crone&quot; feature Gawain in beheading game situations. &quot;Hunbaut&quot; furnishes an interesting twist: Gawain cuts off the man&#x27;s head, and then pulls off his magic cloak before he can replace it, causing his death. A similar story, this time attributed to Lancelot, appears in the 13th century French work &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;.

The 15th-century &quot;The Turke and Gowin&quot; begins with a Turk entering Arthur&#x27;s court and asking, &quot;Is there any will, as a brother, To give a buffett and take another?&quot; Gawain accepts the challenge, and is then forced to follow the Turk until he decides to return the blow. Through the many adventures they have together, the Turk, out of respect, asks the knight to cut off the Turk&#x27;s head, which Gawain does. The Turk, surviving, then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. &quot;Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle&quot; contains a scene in which the Carl, a lord, orders Gawain to strike him with his spear, and bends over to receive the blow. Gawain obliges, the Carl rises, laughing and unharmed, and, unlike in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, no return blow is demanded or given. Among all these stories, &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; is the only one with a completely green character, and the only one tying Morgan le Fay to his transformation.

Several stories also feature knights struggling to stave off the advances of voluptuous women, including &quot;Yder&quot;, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, &quot;Hunbaut&quot;, and &quot;The Knight of the Sword&quot;. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight as to whether or not he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in &quot;Yder&quot;), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in &quot;The Knight of the Sword&quot; the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight&#x27;s role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.
Pwyll, in the First Branch of the Mabinogi, faces a similar chastity test.

== Significance of the colour green ==

In English folklore and literature, green has traditionally been used to symbolise nature and its embodied attributes, namely those of fertility and rebirth. Critics have claimed that the Green Knight&#x27;s role emphasises the environment outside of human habitation. With his alternate identity as Bertilak, the Green Knight can also be seen as a compromise between both humanity and the environment as opposed to Gawain&#x27;s representation of human civilisation. Often, it is used to embody the supernatural or spiritual other world. In British folklore, the devil was sometimes considered to be green which may or may not play into the concept of the Green Man/ Wild Man dichotomy of the Green Knight. Stories of the medieval period also portray the colour as representing love and the amorous in life, and the base, natural desires of man. Green is also known to have signified witchcraft, devilry and evil for its association with the fairies and spirits of early English folklore and for its association with decay and toxicity. The colour, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In the Celtic tradition, green was avoided in clothing for its superstitious association with misfortune and death. Green in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; is ambiguous as it could have a variety of meanings: signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again, or displaying both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour. 

=== Interpretations ===
Of the many characters similar to him, the Green Knight of &quot;Sir Gawain&quot; is the first to be green. Because of his strange colour, some scholars believe him to be a manifestation of the Green Man figure of medieval art, or as a representation of both the vitality and fearful unpredictability of nature. That he carries a green holly branch, and the comparison of his beard to a bush, has guided many scholars to this interpretation. The gold entwined in the cloth wrapped around his axe, combined with the green, gives him both a wild and an aristocratic air. Others consider him as being an incarnation of the Devil. In one interpretation, it is thought that the Green Knight, as the &quot;Lord of Hades&quot;, has come to challenge the noble knights of King Arthur&#x27;s court. Sir Gawain, the bravest of the knights, therefore proves himself equal to Hercules in challenging the Knight, tying the story to ancient Greek mythology. Scholars like Curely claim the descriptive features of the Green Knight suggest a servitude to Satan such as the beaver-hued beard alluding to the allegorical significance of beavers for the Christian audience of the time who believed that they renounced the world and paid &quot;tribute to the devil for spiritual freedom.&quot; Another possible interpretation of the Green Knight views him as combining elements from the Greek Hades and the Christian Messiah, at once representing both good and evil and life and death as self-proliferating cycles. This interpretation embraces the positive and negative attributes of the colour green and relates to the enigmatic motif of the poem. The description of the Green Knight upon his entrance to Arthur&#x27;s Court as &quot;from neck to loin… strong and thickly made&quot; is considered by some scholars as homoerotic.

C.S. Lewis declared the Green Knight &quot;as vivid and concrete as any image in literature&quot; and further described him as:

The Green Knight could also be interpreted as a blend of two traditional figures in romance and medieval narratives, namely, &quot;the literary green man&quot; and the &quot;literary wild man.&quot; &quot;The literary green man&quot; signifies &quot;youth, natural vitality, and love,&quot; whereas the &quot;literary wild man&quot; represents the &quot;hostility to knighthood,&quot; &quot;the demonic&quot; and &quot;death.&quot; The Knight&#x27;s green skin connects the green of the costume to the green of the hair and beard, thus connecting the green man&#x27;s pleasant manners and significance into the wild man&#x27;s grotesque qualities.

=== Jack in the Green ===
The Green Knight is also compared to the English holiday figure Jack in the Green. Jack is part of a May Day holiday tradition in some parts of England, but his connection to the Knight is found mainly in the Derbyshire tradition of Castleton Garland. In this tradition, a kind of Jack in the green known as the Garland King is led through the town on a horse, wearing a bell-shaped garland of flowers that covers his entire upper body, and followed by young girls dressed in white, who dance at various points along the route (formerly the town&#x27;s bellringers, who still make the garland, also performed this role). On the top of the King&#x27;s garland is the &quot;queen&quot;, a posy of bright flowers. The King is also accompanied by his elegantly dressed female consort (nowadays, confusingly, also known as the Queen); played by a woman during recent times, until 1956 &quot;the Woman&quot; was always a man in woman&#x27;s clothing. At the end of the ceremony, the queen posy is taken off the garland, to be placed on the town&#x27;s war memorial. The Garland King then rides to the church tower where the garland is hauled up the side of the tower and impaled upon a pinnacle. Due to the nature imagery associated with the Green Knight, the ceremony has been interpreted as possibly deriving from his famous beheading in the &quot;Gawain&quot; poem. In this case, the posy&#x27;s removal would symbolise the loss of the knight&#x27;s head.

==Green Chapel==

In the poem &quot;Gawain&quot;, when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby know where it is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak&#x27;s castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many scholars to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.

The chapel is considered by Gawain as an evil place: foreboding, &quot;the most accursed church&quot;, &quot;the place for the Devil to recite matins&quot;; but when the mysterious Knight allows Gawain to live, Gawain immediately assumes the role of penitent to a priest or judge, as in a genuine church. The Green Chapel may also be related to tales of fairy hills or knolls of earlier Celtic literature. Some scholars have wondered whether &quot;Hautdesert&quot; refers to the Green Chapel, as it means &quot;High Hermitage&quot;; but such a connection is doubted by most scholars. As to the location of the chapel, in the &quot;Greene Knight&quot; poem, Sir Bredbeddle&#x27;s living place is described as &quot;the castle of hutton&quot;, causing some scholars to suggest a connection with Hutton Manor House in Somerset. Gawain&#x27;s journey leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet&#x27;s dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it is in the writer&#x27;s dialect area, and matches the land features described in the poem. The Green Chapel is thought to be in either Lud&#x27;s Church or Wetton Mill, as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author. Ralph Elliott for example located the chapel the knight searches for near ( v1078) the old manor house at Swythamley Park at the bottom of a valley ( v2145) on a hillside ( v2147) in a large fissure ( v2182–83).

==Popular culture==

Marvel Comics has its version of the Green Knight. While his history with Gawain is still intact, this version is depicted as having been merged with the Green Man who was an aspect of Gaea.

The film &quot;The Green Knight&quot; depicted the titular character (performed by Ralph Ineson) as a wood-skinned character. The part with him showing up in King Arthur&#x27;s court and being beheaded by Gawain using his uncle&#x27;s sword remains intact. Unlike the poem, there was no connection between the Green Knight and Bertilak de Hautdesert in this film. Instead by the final scene after Gawain envisioned that he became a reviled king after King Arthur&#x27;s death and removed the protective green girdle so that the Green Knight can strike him, the Green Knight just quotes &quot;Well done, my brave knight&quot;. After gently moving his finger across Gawain&#x27;s neck, he points his finger past Gawain where he sends him on his way while playfully quoting &quot;Now, off with your head&quot; as he gives him a warm smile.

<text>Monkton Combe is a village and civil parish in north Somerset, England, south of Bath. The parish, which includes the hamlet of Tucking Mill, had a population of 554 in 2013. It was formerly known as Combe, owing to its geography, while it was also known as Monckton Combe and Combe Monckton until last century.

==History==
The pre-Saxon history of Monkton Combe is poorly recorded. It lay close to the Roman road from Bath to London, which has prompted the construction of a Roman villa in Combe Down. More activity is noted in the sub-Roman period, when it formed the end of the western section of the protective Wansdyke, which had been designed to protect Somerset from Saxon invasion.

Combe was settled and cultivated by the Anglo-Saxon period, when it formed part of the hundred of Bath Forum.

It was probably given to Bath Abbey, along with other surrounding villages, in the early 1060&#x27;s by either Edward the Confessor or Harold Godwinson. The Abbey had been impoverished, and Bishop Gisa made use of patronage to expand its lands. In 1086, Combe was assessed in the Domesday Book as having around twenty families, and supporting a range of agricultural activities. During the medieval period, it acquired the additional name &#x27;Monkton&#x27;, noting its ownership by the Abbey and disambiguating it from other nearby &#x27;Combes&#x27;.

The village&#x27;s industry diversified in the late 18th century, with the opening of local mines and the Somerset Coal Canal in 1800. This prompted the expansion of the village&#x27;s population, and the construction of new housing to accommodate workers, built in the local Bath stone. The canal was converted to a railway in 1910, giving the village a short-lived railway station of its own. The closure of the line encouraged the further de-industrialisation of the village, with the neighbouring flock mill closing the following year, although not before the village, and its station, featured in the popular Ealing comedy The Titfield Thunderbolt.

==Governance==
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village car park and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The Village Hall and Village Green are the responsibility of the Village Hall Committee and not of the Parish Council.

The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area, including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal, and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary, and the Great Western Ambulance Service.

Bath and North East Somerset&#x27;s area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset, but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974, and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District.

The parish falls within the &#x27;Bathavon South&#x27; electoral ward. The ward starts in the north east at &quot;Monkton Combe&quot; and stretches south west through Wellow to Shoscombe. The total population of this ward at the 2011 census was 3,052.

The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the Frome and East Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Church==
The parish church of St Michael, thought to have been Norman, was razed in the early 19th century and rebuilt in 1814. The 1814 church was soon found to be too small, and was rebuilt in 1865 at the initiative of the first Vicar of Monkton Combe, the Revd. Francis Pocock. It was designed by ecclesiastical architect C. E. Giles of London, and the builder was Mr. S. G. Mitchell. It was extended within just a few years to accommodate the growing number of pupils from nearby Monkton Combe School, founded by Revd. Pocock in 1868. The church is a Grade II listed building.

The churchyard contains the grave of Harry Patch, the last surviving British soldier who served in the First World War, and a handful of Commonwealth War Graves.

==Landmarks==

The village has one public house, the &quot;Wheelwright&#x27;s Arms&quot;, which was built as a private house in the mid-late 18th century and later converted to an inn. It gained its name from the wheelwrighting business that worked from its yard until 1934.

A village lock-up in the 18th century, probably circa 1776, and is located conveniently near the Wheelwrights Arms. This is now one of the village&#x27;s many Grade II listed buildings, and was last used in 1905 by errant pupils to lock up the school&#x27;s unpopular bursar.

There were two mills from the time of the Domesday Book, which were rebuilt in the early 19th century and have survived to this day, although neither are in working order.

==Monkton Combe School==
Much of the village and the surrounding fields are owned and occupied by Monkton Combe School, including the majority of the historic houses along Church Lane. Monkton is a prominent public school which was founded in the village in 1868 by the first Vicar of Monkton Combe, the Revd Francis Pocock, and is today a member of the Rugby Group of major British independent schools.

<doc id="1232030" wikidata="Q366482" url="?curid=1232030" title="Adrafinil">
<text>Adrafinil, sold under the brand name Olmifon, is a wakefulness-promoting medication that was formerly used in France to improve alertness, attention, wakefulness, and mood, particularly in the elderly. It was also used off-label by individuals who wished to avoid fatigue, such as night workers or others who needed to stay awake and alert for long periods of time. Additionally, the medication has been used non-medically as a novel vigilance-promoting agent.

Adrafinil is a prodrug; it is primarily metabolized &quot;in vivo&quot; to modafinil, resulting in very similar pharmacological effects. Unlike modafinil, however, it takes time for the metabolite to accumulate to active levels in the bloodstream. Effects usually are apparent within 45–60 minutes when taken orally on an empty stomach.

Adrafinil was marketed in France until September 2011 when it was voluntarily discontinued due to an unfavorable risk–benefit ratio.

==Medical uses==
Adrafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent and was used to promote alertness, attention, wakefulness, and mood. It was particularly used in the elderly.

===Available forms===
Adrafinil was available in the form of 300mg oral tablets.

==Side effects==
There is a case report of two patients that adrafinil may increase interest in sex.

A case report of adrafinil-induced orofacial dyskinesia exists. Reports of this side effect also exist for modafinil.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Because α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists were found to block effects of adrafinil and modafinil in animals, &quot;most investigators assume[d] that adrafinil and modafinil both serve as α1-adrenergic receptor agonists.&quot; However, adrafinil and modafinil have not been found to bind to the α1-adrenergic receptor and they lack peripheral sympathomimetic side effects associated with activation of this receptor; hence, the evidence in support of this hypothesis is weak, and other mechanisms are probable. Modafinil was subsequently screened at a variety of targets in 2009 and was found to act as a weak, atypical blocker of the dopamine transporter (and hence as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor), and this action may explain some or all of its pharmacological effects. Relative to adrafinil, modafinil possesses greater specificity in its action, lacking or having a reduced incidence of many of the common side effects of the former (including stomach pain, skin irritation, anxiety, and elevated liver enzymes with prolonged use).

===Pharmacokinetics===
In addition to modafinil, adrafinil also produces modafinil acid (CRL-40467) and modafinil sulfone (CRL-41056) as metabolites, which form from metabolic modification of modafinil.

==Chemistry==
Adrafinil is the &quot;N&quot;-hydroxylated analogue of modafinil and is also known as &quot;N&quot;-hydroxymodafinil.

Analogues of adrafinil include modafinil, armodafinil, CRL-40,940, CRL-40,941, and fluorenol, among others.

==History==
Adrafinil was discovered in 1974 by two chemists working for the French pharmaceutical company Laboratoires Lafon who were screening compounds in search of analgesics. Pharmacological studies of adrafinil instead revealed psychostimulant-like effects such as hyperactivity and wakefulness in animals. The substance was first tested in humans, specifically for the treatment of narcolepsy, in 1977–1978. Introduced by Lafon (now Cephalon), it reached the market in France in 1984, and for the treatment of narcolepsy in 1985.

In 1976, two years after the discovery of adrafinil, its active metabolite modafinil was discovered. Modafinil appeared to be more potent than adrafinil in animal studies, and was selected for further clinical development, with both adrafinil and modafinil eventually reaching the market. Modafinil was first approved in France in 1994, and then in the United States in 1998. Lafon was acquired by Cephalon in 2001. As of September 2011, Cephalon has discontinued Olmifon, its adrafinil product, while modafinil continues to be marketed.

==Society and culture==

===Names===
&quot;Adrafinil&quot; is the generic name of the drug and its and . It is also known by its brand name Olmifon and its developmental code name &quot;CRL-40028&quot;.

===Regulation===

====Athletic doping====
Adrafinil and its active metabolite modafinil were added to the list of substances prohibited for athletic competition according to World Anti-Doping Agency in 2004.

==== Additive in United States dietary supplements ====
Adrafinil is sometimes included as an ingredient in misbranded or adulterated dietary supplements. One company had attempted to get a New Dietary Ingredient pre-market notification approved for adrafinil in 2017, but the Food and Drug Administration rejected it:

A position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug was indicated in a warning letter by the FDA in 2019:

A position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug was also indicated by FDA in a press release regarding a criminal action undertaken in 2019:

FDA indicated a position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug in later criminal action undertaken during 2022: “[The defendants in a 2022 enforcement action] also illegally sold multiple other unapproved and misbranded drugs, including adrafinil crystalline powder...” Most recently in 2023, the FDA fined an Arizona company 2.4 million U.S. dollars for introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce:

Certain products, formulated with adrafinil in them, have been listed as subject to a May 2023 import alert by Food and Drug Administration because they are considered as containing an active pharmaceutical ingredient.

Adrafinil containing products, purporting to be dietary supplements, are not allowed for use by military service members. This is because the Department of Defense considers adrafinil an unapproved drug.

====New Zealand====
In 2005 a Medical Classification Committee in New Zealand recommended to MEDSAFE NZ that adrafinil be classified as a prescription medicine due to risks of it being used as a party drug. At that time adrafinil was not scheduled in New Zealand.

==Research==
In a clinical trial with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine and placebo as comparators, adrafinil showed efficacy in the treatment of depression. In contrast to clomipramine however, adrafinil was well-tolerated, and showed greater improvement in psychomotor retardation in comparison. The authors concluded that further investigation of the potential antidepressant effects of adrafinil were warranted.

<doc id="1232035" wikidata="Q4355064" url="?curid=1232035" title="Get the Knack">
<text>Get the Knack is the debut album by American rock band The Knack, released in June 1979. At the time, the album was one of the most successful debuts in history, selling over one million copies in less than two months and spending five weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart.

The lead single from the album, &quot;My Sharona&quot;, was number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for six weeks and number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Pop Singles of 1979 year-end chart. The follow-up single, &quot;Good Girls Don&#x27;t&quot;, reached number 11 on the Hot 100 and followed &quot;My Sharona&quot; to number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. In &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s year-end charts, &quot;Get the Knack&quot; ranked at #16 for 1979, and #72 for 1980.

==Background==
The Knack formed in Los Angeles in May 1978, and after shopping their demo tape to various record labels without success, the band began playing the local club circuit beginning in June, playing over 50 gigs in the next six months. The band quickly gained a following as word of mouth spread about their energetic shows and musicians such as Ray Manzarek, Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen came to their shows and joined the group on stage. By December, thirteen record labels, including some that previously rejected them, were offering recording contracts and the group signed with Capitol Records in January 1979.

==Recording==
&quot;Get the Knack&quot; was recorded in just two weeks at a cost of only $18,000, an extremely quick and inexpensive recording at a time when many established artists were spending months and several hundred thousand dollars to record an album. The album was produced by Mike Chapman, who had written hits for Sweet in the early 1970s and most recently produced Blondie&#x27;s breakout album &quot;Parallel Lines&quot;.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Get the Knack&quot; was released in June 1979 and became an immediate success, thanks in part to an intense promotional campaign by Capitol Records. The Knack&#x27;s image was largely influenced by the Beatles. The album cover imitates the Beatles&#x27; first Capitol LP, &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot;, and the back cover photo depicts a scene from the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. To complete the Beatle imagery, the 1960s Capitol rainbow label adorned the LP, a detail the band had written into its contract. The album obtained a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in just 13 days, becoming Capitol Records&#x27; fastest selling debut LP since &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; in 1964. In August, the album reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it remained for five weeks, and was certified platinum by the RIAA for one million copies sold. The lead single, &quot;My Sharona&quot;, also met with immediate success, becoming Capitol&#x27;s fastest selling debut single since the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and staying at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for six weeks.

A backlash against the Knack&#x27;s overnight success formed among critics who found the band&#x27;s image too contrived and their attitude too brash. San Francisco conceptual artist Hugh Brown, who had designed the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; album cover, started a &quot;Knuke the Knack&quot; campaign complete with T-shirts, buttons and bumper stickers. Some music writers began to criticize the band for what they perceived as arrogance, hype and a misogynist attitude expressed in their songs. The band&#x27;s refusal to do interviews was also viewed negatively by the music press. One entertainment weekly, &quot;Scene&quot; magazine, refused to publish a review of the Knack&#x27;s concert in Cleveland due to what it called &quot;attempts at censorship&quot; by the band&#x27;s management.

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was critical of the album&#x27;s misogynistic themes and remarked that if the Knack &quot;felt this way about girls when they were unknowns, I shudder to think how they&#x27;re reacting to groupies.&quot; However, Christgau countered critics who had dismissed the band on &quot;purely technical terms&quot;, arguing that &quot;if they&#x27;re less engaging musically than, say, the Scruffs, they have a lot more pop and power going for them than, say, the Real Kids.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; critic Dick Nusser was particularly complimentary of tracks such as &quot;Let Me Out&quot;, &quot;Maybe Tonight&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s What the Little Girls Do&quot;, while noting that the pleading song &quot;Oh Tara&quot; indicates that the Knack &quot;aren&#x27;t strict girl haters.&quot;

==Legacy==
In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Chris Woodstra wrote that the Knack&#x27;s attempt to &quot;update the Beatles sound for the new wave era&quot; was &quot;a good idea that was well executed&quot;, describing &quot;Get the Knack&quot; as &quot;at once sleazy, sexist, hook-filled, and endlessly catchy – above all, it&#x27;s a guilty pleasure and an exercise in simple fun.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; noted the negative portrayal of the female protagonists of certain songs and singled out &quot;Maybe Tonight&quot; as &quot;bottom-of-the-barrel sap&quot;, but praised &quot;My Sharona&quot;, &quot;Let Me Out&quot; and &quot;Frustrated&quot; as &quot;tight guitar pop.&quot; In 2016, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked &quot;Get the Knack&quot; at number 39 on its list of the 50 best new wave albums. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain listed &quot;Get the Knack&quot; as one of his 50 favorite recordings.

==Re-issues==
When the album was initially released on CD in 1989, the song &quot;(She&#x27;s So) Selfish&quot; had vocals different from the original release, with lyrics like &quot;coming from the quaalude scene&quot; changed to &quot;...lame&#x27;o scene&quot;. Capitol Records used a censored, alternate version of the track which was requested in certain countries.

The album was re-issued on CD in 2002 as a remastered version true to the original vinyl release. This version included bonus demos of &quot;My Sharona&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s What the Little Girls Do&quot;, as well as a rehearsal take of &quot;Maybe Tonight&quot;. It also included a cover of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; outtake &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, which the Knack recorded in 1979 but was left off the &quot;Get the Knack&quot; LP, and a cover of Nick Lowe&#x27;s &quot;I Knew the Bride&quot;. A subsequent CD re-issue was remastered by Iconoclassic Records in 2011. Unlike the previous remaster, the 2011 release contains no dynamic range compression.

In April 2017, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released an audiophile version of the album on hybrid SACD. This release, like the 2002 Capitol and 2011 Iconoclassic versions, utilizes the original, un-censored mixes.

<text>Evelyn Margaret Sempier (née Ay; March 8, 1933 – October 18, 2008) was winner of the 1954 Miss America beauty pageant.

==Early life==
Ay was born the daughter of German immigrants in Ephrata, Pennsylvania.

==Pageantry==
She had a short but successful career in smaller beauty contests. As Miss Ephrata Fair and Tobacco Queen of Lancaster County in 1950, she wore a crown that looked like tobacco leaves. After graduating from Ephrata High School in 1951, she won the titles of Miss Pennsylvania AMVET and the Miss National AMVET in 1952, as well as the Miss Pennsylvania title in 1953. She was selected Miss America at the last year before the pageant was televised.

In a 1993 interview, &quot;Evvy&quot; said she was surprised at her victories. &quot;That was the ultimate role model, like being Doris Day in real life.&quot; She embarked on her career as a favor to a friend who was trying to promote a pageant for the Junior Chamber International (JayCees). She traveled during her yearlong reign, and remained active with the pageant for many years, judging many local pageants and the national Miss America contest in 1981.

==Career==
Sempier officially introduced the Nash Metropolitan at the 1954 Chicago Auto Show. She was a spokesperson for Nash Motors in promoting the first American car that was marketed specifically to women. She described her marketing for Nash as the finest among her 40-years of commercial relationships, and the company was &quot;most generous in sponsoring Miss America in many parts of America.&quot;

Between the 1960s and 1990s, she made frequent appearances as a motivational speaker to women&#x27;s and business groups.

==Personal life==
Shortly after passing on the Miss America crown, she married Carl G. Sempier, a Navy veteran and corporate executive on November 13, 1954, and had two children. Carl Sempier died in 2007. Sempier died on October 18, 2008, of colorectal cancer.

==Evelyn Ay Sempier Quality of Life Award==
The Evelyn Ay Sempier Quality of Life Award was established to honor the 1954 pageant winner. The award was introduced in 1988, and is given to select Miss America contestants involved with the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network, as well as to &quot;recognize contestants who excel in their commitment to community service&quot;.

<text>Baumgarten an der March (Croatian: &quot;Pangort na Moravi&quot;) is a small subdivision of the municipality of Weiden an der March in Lower Austria, Austria. It has only 192 inhabitants.

== Significance for the energy sector ==

Baumgarten has an important role in the European energy sector. The Baumgarten gas distribution centre developed from the central production facility of the spent Zwerndorf gas field, and came online in 1959. The first gas shipment from Russia was received in 1968. Over the past few decades, Baumgarten has become one of Europe&#x27;s most important gas distribution stations. Every year around 40 billion cubic metres of gas are distributed from the Baumgarten gas station to Eastern Austria and to Western, Southern and South-Eastern Europe.
The gas reception facilities run by Gas Connect Austria and by TAG GmbH, the operator of the Trans Austria Gasleitung (TAG) pipeline, are located on an 18 hectare (ha) site. The facilities include equipment like filter separators, gas dryer units, several compressor units (some of them electric), gas coolers and metering sections. Incoming gas deliveries are compressed and then pumped into the West-Austria-Gasleitung (WAG) and TAG pipelines. Part of the gas is also transported to Hungary via the Hungaria Austria Gasleitung (HAG).

Gas reserves are stored in the underground facilities in Tallesbrunn and Schönkirchen, both of which are depleted gas fields. Imported gas is pumped into these storage plants.
There are also underground storage facilities in Thann and Puchkirchen in Upper Austria, and in Haidach bei Strasswalchen on the border between Salzburg and Upper Austria. The storage facilities in Puchkirchen and Haidach are operated by Rohöl-Aufsuchungs Aktiengesellschaft (RAG). The total volume of gas at Austria&#x27;s storage plants is sufficient to cover the annual consumption of Austria.

==2017 explosion==
On 12 December 2017, an explosion on the premises of the gas distribution center left one person dead and 21 injured. The blast cut off supplies from the hub to southern Europe for a short period, prompting Italy to declare a state of emergency.

<doc id="1232085" wikidata="Q422917" url="?curid=1232085" title="Cannabidiol">
<text>Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid, one of 113 identified cannabinoids in cannabis plants, along with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and accounts for up to 40% of the plant&#x27;s extract. Medically, it is an anticonvulsant used to treat multiple forms of epilepsy. It was discovered in 1940 and, as of 2024 clinical research on CBD included studies related to the treatment of anxiety, addiction, psychosis, movement disorders, and pain, but there is insufficient high-quality evidence that CBD is effective for these conditions. CBD is sold as an herbal dietary supplement and promoted with yet unproven claims of particular therapeutic effects.
Cannabidiol can be taken internally in multiple ways, including by inhaling cannabis smoke or vapor, swallowing it by mouth, and through use of an aerosol spray into the cheek. It may be supplied as CBD oil containing only CBD as the active ingredient (excluding THC or terpenes), CBD-dominant hemp extract oil, capsules, dried cannabis, or prescription liquid solution. CBD does not have the same psychoactivity as THC, and can modulate the psychoactive effects of THC on the body if both are present. Conversion of CBD to THC can occur when CBD is heated to temperatures between 250–300 °C, potentially leading to its partial transformation into THC.
In the United States, the cannabidiol drug Epidiolex was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 for the treatment of two seizure disorders. While the 2018 United States Farm Bill removed hemp and hemp extracts (including CBD) from the Controlled Substances Act, the marketing and sale of CBD formulations for medical use or as an ingredient in dietary supplements or manufactured foods remains illegal under FDA regulation, .
==Medical uses==

===Epilepsy===
In the United States, the FDA has indicated only one brand of prescription cannabidiol called Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex in people one year of age and older. While Epidiolex treatment is generally well tolerated, it is associated with minor adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal upset, decreased appetite, lethargy, sleepiness, and poor sleep quality.

In the European Union, Epidyolex is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome, in conjunction with clobazam, for people two years of age and older. In 2020, the label for Epidiolex in the US was expanded to include seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. Epidiolex/Epidyolex is the first prescription formulation of plant-derived cannabidiol approved by regulatory bodies in the US and Europe.

===Other uses===
Research on other uses for cannabidiol includes several neurological disorders, but the findings have not been confirmed to establish such uses in clinical practice. In October 2019, the FDA issued an advisory warning that the effects of CBD during pregnancy or breastfeeding are unknown, indicating that the safety, doses, interactions with other drugs or foods, and side effects of CBD are not clinically defined, and may pose a risk to the mother and infant.

Many claims are made for the therapeutic benefit of cannabidiol that are not backed by sound evidence. Some claims, such as treatment of cancer, are pseudoscience.

In 2020, the label for Epidiolex in the US was expanded to include treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis.

Acclaimed for relieving chronic pain, some researchers conclude that the evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of CBD in pain relief, primarily due to the challenging access to pure CBD.

CBD oil is used for massage therapy as a substitute for body oil and for its health benefits. 

===Non-intoxicating effects===
Cannabidiol does not appear to have any intoxicating effects such as those caused by ∆-THC in cannabis, but it is under preliminary research for its possible anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects. As the legal landscape and understanding about the differences in medical cannabinoids unfolds, experts are working to distinguish &quot;medical cannabis&quot; (with varying degrees of psychotropic effects and deficits in executive function) from &quot;medical CBD therapies&quot;, which would commonly present as having a reduced or non-psychoactive side-effect profile.

Various strains of &quot;medical cannabis&quot; are found to have a significant variation in the ratios of CBD-to-THC and are known to contain other non-psychotropic cannabinoids. Any psychoactive cannabis, regardless of its CBD content, is derived from the flower (or bud) of the genus &quot;Cannabis&quot;. As defined by US federal law, non-psychoactive hemp (also commonly termed &quot;industrial hemp&quot;), regardless of its CBD content, is any part of the cannabis plant, whether growing or not, containing a ∆-tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of no more than 0.3% on a dry-weight basis. In the United States, certain standards are required for legal growing, cultivating, and producing the hemp plant, but there are no federal standards for quality being enforced in the hemp industry. Certain state regulations are in place, but vary state to state. For instance, the Colorado Industrial Hemp Program registers growers of industrial hemp and samples crops to verify that the dry-weight THC concentration does not exceed 0.3%.

===Available forms===
CBD is present as an active constituent of cannabis, which is used both recreationally and medically.

Nabiximols (brand name Sativex), an oromucosal spray made of a complex botanical mixture containing cannabidiol (CBD), delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and additional cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid constituents from cannabis sativa plants, was approved by Health Canada in 2005, to treat central neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis, and in 2007, for cancer-related pain. In New Zealand, Sativex is &quot;approved for use as an add-on treatment for symptom improvement in people with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication.&quot;

Epidiolex (&quot;Epidyolex&quot; in Europe) is an orally administered cannabidiol solution. It was approved in 2018 for treatment of two rare forms of childhood epilepsy, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, and seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. In the US, it is approved in these indications for people one year of age and older.

==Side effects==
Research indicates that cannabidiol may reduce adverse effects of THC, particularly those causing intoxication and sedation, but only at high doses. Safety studies of cannabidiol showed it is well tolerated, but may cause fatigue, somnolence, sedation, diarrhea, or changes in appetite as common adverse effects, with the most common being somnolence and sedation. Side effects of CBD are dose related. Epidiolex documentation lists sleepiness, insomnia and poor quality sleep, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and fatigue.

In November 2019, the FDA issued concerns about the safety of cannabidiol, stating that CBD use has potential to cause hepatotoxicity, interfere with the mechanisms of prescription drugs, produce gastrointestinal disorders, or affect alertness and mood. Over 2020–23, the FDA updated its safety concerns about CBD, acknowledging the unknown effects of protracted use, how it affects the developing brain, fetus, or infants during breastfeeding, whether it interacts with dietary supplements or prescription drugs, whether male fertility is affected, and its possible side effects, such as drowsiness.

, 1,085 people contacted US poison control centers about CBD-induced illnesses, doubling the number of cases over the 2018 rate and increasing by 9 times the case numbers of 2017. Of cases reported in 2019, more than 33% received medical attention and 46 people were admitted to a hospital intensive care unit, possibly due to exposure to other products, or drug interactions with CBD.

In 2022, the FDA stated that &quot;scientific studies show possible harm to the male reproductive system, including testicular atrophy, harm to the liver, and interactions with certain medications. The FDA has not found adequate information showing how much CBD can be consumed, and for how long, before causing harm. This is particularly true for vulnerable populations like children and those who are pregnant.&quot;

==Interactions==
Laboratory evidence indicated that cannabidiol may reduce THC clearance, increasing plasma concentrations which may raise THC availability to receptors and enhance its effect in a dose-dependent manner. &quot;In vitro&quot;, cannabidiol inhibited the activity of voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels, which may affect neural activity. A recent study using X-ray crystallography showed that CBD binds inside the sodium channel pore at a novel site at the interface of the fenestrations and the central hydrophobic cavity of the channel. Binding at this site blocks the transmembrane-spanning sodium ion translocation pathway, providing a molecular mechanism for channel inhibition, which could contribute to a reduced excitability. A small clinical trial reported that CBD partially inhibited the CYP2C-catalyzed hydroxylation of THC to 11-OH-THC. Little is known about potential drug interactions, but CBD mediates a decrease in clobazam metabolism. Work with human liver microsomes shows that cannabidiol inhibits CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 to some degree.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
&quot;In vitro&quot;, cannabidiol has low affinity for, and acts as a negative allosteric modulator of the CB cannabinoid receptor

Cannabidiol may be an antagonist of GPR55, a G protein-coupled receptor and putative non-homologous CB3 cannabinoid receptor shown by &quot;in vitro&quot; studies to be widely distributed in the brain. Cannabidiol may interact with various neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and GABA.

As of 2024, the cellular effects and mechanisms of cannabidiol &quot;in vivo&quot; are unknown, as research to date has been inconclusive and based on laboratory studies. The anticonvulsant effects provided by cannabidiol (Epidiolex) in people with certain forms of epilepsy do not appear to involve cannabinoid receptors. A possible mechanism for the effects of cannabidiol on seizures is by affecting the neuronal movement of calcium in brain structures involved in the excessive electrical activity of seizures.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The oral bioavailability of cannabidiol is approximately 6% in fasting state and 36.5—57.3% in fed-state in humans, while its bioavailability via inhalation is 11 to 45% (mean 31%). The oral bioavailability of cannabidiol varies based on several factors such as formulation, dose, and food intake. The sublingual bioavailability of cannabidiol is approximately 12 to 35%. The elimination half-life of cannabidiol in blood is 56 to 61 hours after oral doses twice per day over 7 days. Based on the pharmacokinetic analysis of long-term dosing of cannabidiol in humans, the terminal elimination half-life is estimated to be &gt;134 h. Cannabidiol is metabolized in the liver as well as in the intestines by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

==Chemistry==
At room temperature, cannabidiol is a colorless crystalline solid. In strongly basic media and the presence of air, it is oxidized to cannabinodiol (CBND) and a quinone called HU-331. Under acidic conditions it cyclizes to THC, which also occurs during pyrolysis, and during smoking. The synthesis of cannabidiol has been accomplished by several research groups.

===Overview===

===Biosynthesis===
&quot;Cannabis&quot; produces CBD through the same metabolic pathway as THC, until the next to last step, where CBDA synthase performs catalysis instead of THCA synthase.

===Isomerism===

===Pyrolysis===
In the typical operating temperature range of e-cigarettes (), 25–52% of CBD is transformed into other chemical substances: Δ9-THC, Δ8-THC, cannabinol and cannabichromene as predominant pyrolysates. From a chemical point of view, CBD in e-cigarettes can be considered a precursor of THC.

===Synthetic derivatives===
Numerous synthetic derivatives of CBD are known, and have been researched for generally similar applications as CBD itself.

==History==
Efforts to isolate the active ingredients in cannabis were made in the 19th century. Cannabidiol was studied in 1940 from Minnesota wild hemp and Egyptian &quot;Cannabis indica&quot; resin. The chemical formula of CBD was proposed from a method for isolating it from wild hemp. Its structure and stereochemistry were determined in 1963.

===Plant breeding===
Selective breeding of cannabis plants has expanded and diversified as commercial and therapeutic markets develop. Some growers in the US succeeded in lowering the proportion of CBD-to-THC to accommodate customers who preferred varietals that were more mind-altering due to the higher THC and lower CBD content. In the US, hemp is classified by the federal government as cannabis containing no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. This classification was established in the 2018 Farm Bill and was refined to include hemp-sourced extracts, cannabinoids, and derivatives in the definition of hemp.

==Society and culture==
===Names===
&quot;Cannabidiol&quot; is the generic name of the drug and its .

===Foods and beverages===
Food and beverage products containing cannabidiol were widely marketed in the United States as early as 2017. Hemp seed ingredients which do not naturally contain THC or CBD (but which may be contaminated with trace amounts on the outside during harvesting) were declared by the US Food and Drug Administration as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in December 2018. CBD itself has not been declared GRAS, and under US federal law is illegal to sell as a food, dietary supplement, or animal feed. State laws vary considerably as non-medical cannabis and derived products have been legalized in various jurisdictions. Despite once having a promising market, the industry for CBD stalled out during the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020, and, by 2024, it collapsed due to withdrawal of investors, the absence of a FDA ruling on efficacy and safety, inconsistent state-by-state legislation, and consumer ambivalence.

Similar to energy drinks and protein bars which may contain vitamin or herbal additives, food and beverage items can be infused with CBD as an alternative means of ingesting the substance. In the United States, numerous products are marketed as containing CBD, but in reality contain little or none. Some companies marketing CBD-infused food products with claims that are similar to the effects of prescription drugs have received warning letters from the FDA for making unsubstantiated health claims. In February 2019, the New York City Department of Health announced plans to fine restaurants that sell food or drinks containing CBD, beginning in October 2019.

===Labeling and advertising===
Studies conducted by the FDA from 2014 through 2019 have determined that a majority of CBD products are not accurately labeled with the amount of CBD they contain. For example, a 2017 analysis of cannabidiol content in oil, tincture, or liquid vape products purchased online in the United States showed that 69% were mislabeled, with 43% having higher and 26% having lower content than stated on product labels. In 2020, the FDA conducted a study of 147 CBD products and found that half contained THC.

From 2015 to November 2022, the FDA issued dozens of warning letters to American manufacturers of CBD products for false advertising and illegal interstate marketing of CBD as an unapproved drug to treat diseases, such as cancer, osteoarthritis, symptoms of opioid withdrawal, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and pet disorders. Chemical analysis of CBD products found that many did not contain the levels of CBD claimed in advertising.

In December 2020, the Federal Trade Commission initiated a law enforcement crackdown on American companies marketing CBD products as unapproved drugs. The warning also applied to hemp CBD capsules and oil that were being marketed illegally while not adhering to the federal definition of a dietary supplement.

===Sports===
Cannabidiol has been used by professional and amateur athletes across disciplines and countries, with the World Anti-Doping Agency removing CBD from its banned substances list. The United States Anti-Doping Agency and United Kingdom-Anti-Doping Agency do not have anti-CBD policies, with the latter stating that, &quot;CBD is not currently listed on the World Anti-Doping Agency Prohibited List. As a result, it is permitted to use in sport, though the intended benefits are unclear and not backed by clinical evidence. All other cannabinoids (including but not limited to cannabis, hashish, marijuana, and THC) are prohibited in-competition. The intention of the regulations is to prohibit cannabinoids that activate the same receptors in the brain as activated by THC.&quot;

In 2019, the cannabis manufacturer Canopy Growth acquired majority ownership of BioSteel Sports Nutrition, which is developing CBD products under endorsement by numerous professional athletes. The National Hockey League Alumni Association began a project with Canopy Growth to determine if CBD or other cannabis products might improve neurological symptoms and quality of life in head-injured players. Some sports leagues have announced sponsorships with CBD companies, such as Major League Baseball (Charlotte&#x27;s Web) and Ultimate Fighting Championship (Love Hemp). Numerous professional athletes use CBD, primarily for treating pain.

===Legal status===
====Australia====
Prescription medicine (Schedule 4) for therapeutic use containing two percent (2.0%) or less of other cannabinoids commonly found in cannabis (such as ∆-THC). A Schedule 4 drug under the SUSMP is a Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by state or territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription.

In June 2020, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) published a consultation on a proposal to pave the way to make &quot;low dose&quot; CBD available to consumer/patients via pharmacists only through moving products from Schedule 4 to 3. Any products sold would need to have their safety, quality and efficacy pre-assessed by the TGA and be formally approved for sale (details to be outlined by TGA). They would be made available to over 18s only, with the maximum daily dose of 60mg/day, up to 2% THC finished product allowed, 30-day maximum supply, plant-derived or synthetic. This proposal is based on an initial literature review on the safety of low dose CBD published by the TGA in April 2020. Epidyolex was approved for the adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome or with Dravet syndrome in September 2020.

====Bulgaria====
In 2020, Bulgaria became the first country in the European Union to allow retail sales of food products and supplements containing CBD, despite the ongoing discussion within the EU about the classification of CBD as a novel food. However, there exists a legal gap because of the lack of a legally-permissible minimum amount of THC in the products containing cannabinoids.

====Canada====
In October 2018, cannabidiol became legal for recreational and medical use by the federal &quot;Cannabis Act&quot;. , CBD products in Canada could only be sold by authorized retailers or federally licensed medical companies, limiting their access to the general public. Nonetheless, with online delivery services and over 2,600 authorized cannabis retail stores , accessibility has steadily increased over time. The Canadian government states that CBD products &quot;are subject to all of the rules and requirements that apply to cannabis under the Cannabis Act and its regulations.&quot; It requires &quot;a processing licence to manufacture products containing CBD for sale, no matter what the source of the CBD is, and that CBD and products containing CBD, such as cannabis oil, may only be sold by an authorized retailer or licensed seller of medical CBD.&quot; Edible CBD products were scheduled to be permitted for sale in Canada on October 17, 2019, for human consumption.

, it was still illegal to carry cannabis and cannabis-derived products (including products containing CBD) across the Canadian border. If one carries any amount of cannabis for any purpose (including medical), it needs to be declared to the Canada Border Services Agency. Not declaring it is a serious criminal offence.

====Czech Republic====
As of May 2023, the State Agricultural and Food Inspection of the Czech Republic is putting together broad regulations regarding a ban on CBD products. They will make it illegal to sell products containing cannabidiol and other cannabinoids derived from hemp, as a result of EU Novel Food Regulation. In case of Czech Republic, European Industrial Hemp Association has submitted an official request to the Czech Republic to recognize natural hemp extracts with cannabinoids as traditional food.

====European Union====
In 2019, the European Commission announced that CBD and other cannabinoids would be classified as &quot;novel foods&quot;, meaning that CBD products would require authorization under the EU Novel Food Regulation stating that because &quot;this product was not used as a food or food ingredient before May 15, 1997, before it may be placed on the market in the EU as a food or food ingredient, a safety assessment under the Novel Food Regulation is required.&quot; The recommendation – applying to CBD extracts, synthesized CBD, and all CBD products, including CBD oil – was scheduled for a final ruling by the European Commission in March 2019. If approved, manufacturers of CBD products would be required to conduct safety tests and prove safe consumption, indicating that CBD products would not be eligible for legal commerce until at least 2021. In December 2020, the European Commission concluded that CBD should not be considered as drug and can be qualified as food.

Cannabidiol is listed in the EU Cosmetics Ingredient Database (CosIng). However, the listing of an ingredient, assigned with an INCI name, in CosIng does not mean it is to be used in cosmetic products or is approved for such use.

Several industrial hemp varieties can be legally cultivated in Western Europe. A variety such as &quot;Fedora 17&quot; has a cannabinoid profile consistently around 1%, with THC less than 0.3%.

====Hong Kong====
In 2022, the HKSAR Government proposed a ban on any use of cannabidiol (including for academic research and by medical professionals) within the Hong Kong territory, making Hong Kong the first jurisdiction in the world to have complete prohibition of cannabidiol, starting from February 1, 2023, in part due to the possible presence of THC which is illegal in Hong Kong, according to a research subsidized by the Hong Kong SAR Government.

====New Zealand====
In 2017, the New Zealand government made changes to the regulations so that restrictions would be removed, which meant a doctor was able to prescribe cannabidiol to patients.

The passing of the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Act in December 2018 means cannabidiol is no longer a controlled drug in New Zealand, but is a prescription medicine under the Medicines Act, with the restriction that &quot;the tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs) and specified substances within the product must not exceed 2 percent of the total CBD, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other specified substances.&quot;

====Russian Federation====
According to a document received in response to an appeal to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, measures of state control in the Russian Federation regarding CBD have not been established. However, there is also a response from the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation indicating that CBD can be considered as an isomer of restricted THC. The &quot;isomer&quot; argument is nonetheless vague, as progesterone, which is freely sold in pharmacies, is also an isomer of THC, all three being . On February 17, 2020, the deputy of the Moscow City Duma Darya Besedina sent an official request to the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Mikhail Mishustin with a request to eliminate that legal ambiguity by publishing official explanations and, if necessary, making required changes in the corresponding government decree.

====Singapore====
Singapore allows medical cannabis on a case-by-case basis, usually as a last resort drug. Each case is evaluated by the government, and largely comes in the form of Cannabidiol. However, the country is flexible to what is required for patient treatment, despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world.

====Sweden====
Cannabidiol is classified as a medical product in Sweden. However, in July 2019, Supreme Court of Sweden ruled that CBD oil with any concentration of THC falls under the narcotic control laws.

====Switzerland====
While THC remains illegal, cannabidiol is not subject to the Swiss Narcotic Acts because it does not produce a comparable psychoactive effect. Cannabis products containing less than 1% THC can be sold and purchased legally.

====Ukraine====
On April 7, 2021, the Ukrainian government legalised use of isolated cannabidiol. Additionally, it approved Nabiximols, a cannabidiol-containing drug, for medical use.

====United Kingdom====
Cannabidiol, in an oral-mucosal spray formulation combined with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is a product available by prescription for the relief of severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (where other anti-spasmodics have not been effective) in the United Kingdom.

Until 2017, products containing cannabidiol marketed for medical purposes were classed as medicines by the UK regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and could not be marketed without regulatory approval for the medical claims. , cannabis oil is legal to possess, buy, and sell in the UK, providing the product does not contain more than 1 milligram of THC and is not advertised as providing a medicinal benefit. Individual police officers and others who are ill-informed of the exact legislature pertaining to cannabidiol, however, may erroneously consider it of dubious legality, reflecting lack of awareness.

In January 2019, the UK Food Standards Agency indicated it would regard CBD products, including CBD oil, as a &quot;novel food&quot; having no history of use before May 1997, and stated that such products must have authorisation and proven safety before being marketed. The deadline for companies with existing products to submit a full and validated novel foods application with the FSA was March 31, 2021; failure to do so before this date would exclude those companies from selling CBD. New products containing CBD after this deadline would require a fully approved application.

In February 2020, the UK FSA advised vulnerable people, such as pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and those already taking medication for other medical concerns not to take CBD. The FSA further recommended that healthy adults should not consume more than 70mg CBD per day.

====United Nations====
Cannabidiol is scheduled under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs as cannabis. International Narcotics Control Board reminds Member States that, at the reconvened sixty-third session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, in December 2020, the States members of the Commission rejected the recommendation of WHO that a footnote be added to the entry for cannabis and cannabis resin in Schedule I of the 1961 Convention as amended to exempt from international control preparations containing predominantly CBD and not more than 0.2 per cent of delta-9-THC.

====United States====
, cannabidiol extracted from marijuana remains a Schedule I Controlled Substance, and is not approved as a prescription drug or dietary supplement or allowed for interstate commerce in the United States. CBD derived from hemp (with 0.3% THC or lower) is legal to sell as a cosmetics ingredient or for other purposes not regulated by the FDA, but cannot be sold under federal law as an ingredient in food, dietary supplement, or animal feed. It is a common misconception that the legal ability to sell hemp (which may contain CBD), and hemp extracts and derivatives (including CBD), makes CBD legal for sale as a supplement or medicine.

In September 2018, the GW Pharmaceuticals drug Epidiolex was placed in Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), following its approval by the FDA for rare types of childhood epilepsy. It was then removed from the Controlled Substances Act by the DEA in April 2020. Epidiolex is available for prescription use in all 50 states.

In 2013, a CNN program that featured Charlotte&#x27;s Web cannabis brought increased attention to the use of CBD for the treatment of seizure disorders in children. A number of states passed laws over the next few years to allow the use of low-THC, high-CBD cannabis oil in such situations. These states were in addition to the states that had already legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use. Many states further relaxed their laws regarding CBD following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill.

The 2014 Farm Bill legalized the sale of &quot;non-viable hemp material&quot; grown within states participating in the Hemp Pilot Program which defined &quot;hemp&quot; as cannabis containing less than 0.3% of THC. The 2018 Farm Bill removed the hemp plant and all &quot;derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis,&quot; including CBD, from the Controlled Substances Act, making them legal to manufacture in the United States. The FDA retains regulatory authority over hemp-derived CBD, while the DEA is not involved in the regulation of legally-compliant hemp and hemp products. The 2018 Farm Bill requires that research and development of CBD for a therapeutic purpose would have to be conducted under notification and reporting to the FDA.

==Veterinary use==

===Research===
The number of research projects and scientific publications on cannabidiol and other cannabinoids in pets surged in the late 2010s; nonetheless, , there were no hemp-derived, cannabinoid-rich registered veterinary medicinal products in any of the major regions (see #Legal status).

In the US and other territories there are, however, numerous veterinary nutraceutical products available over the counter (OTC). The lack of clarity in the regulations governing veterinary hemp food supplements allows for products of questionable quality to flood the market, which may pose a risk to the wellbeing of pets and owners.

To understand better the benefits of CBD and associated compounds for the quality of life of animals, companies specialized in CBD products for animals have been funding research projects.

===Canine osteoarthritis===
CBD&#x27;s ability to help regulate the endocannabinoid system and reduce the release of excitatory neurotransmitters could result in a retrograde inhibitory signal that lessens chronic pain responses. Studies in dogs with chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis showed an increase in level of activity in animals receiving CBD-rich food supplements.

===Epilepsy===
From the results seen in humans with drugs such as Epidiolex and Sativex in scientific studies and reviews, it could be expected that CBD-based products would be helpful to manage seizures in dogs. However, despite the numerous case reports presented by veterinary neurologists supporting the benefits of CBD as adjunctive therapy, , published controlled studies have not shown a statistically significant decrease in the number of seizures across the groups receiving CBD.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The oral bioavailability of CBD varies greatly across species and it is linked to the presentation and the time of administration. A 24-hour kinetic examination in dogs showed that the absorption of the cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) does occur, and that this molecule is absorbed least twice as well as CBD post oral ingestion.

It was found that the major metabolites of CBD in humans (7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD) are not prevalent in dogs, while 6-OH-CBD was found to be the primary metabolite in dogs receiving a CBD-enriched cannabis-derived herbal extract, suggesting that canine and human CBD metabolic route might be somewhat different.

==Research==
, little evidence exists for cannabidiol reducing psychiatric disorders in humans.

In the United States, federal illegality complicates conducting historic research on CBD.

<text>Project X is a 1987 American science fiction comedy drama film produced by Walter F. Parkes and Lawrence Lasker, directed by Jonathan Kaplan, and starring Matthew Broderick and Helen Hunt. The plot revolves around a USAF Airman (Broderick) and a graduate student (Hunt) who are assigned to care for chimpanzees used in a secret Air Force project.

==Plot==
University of Wisconsin graduate student Teri MacDonald has trained a chimpanzee named Virgil to use sign language. When her National Science Foundation research grant is not renewed, she is forced to sell Virgil. He is taken to an Air Force base in Lockridge, Florida, to be used in a top-secret research project involving flight simulation, though she&#x27;s told that he&#x27;s been sent to the Houston Zoo.

Airman Jimmy Garrett is assigned to the same chimpanzee project. Virgil and Jimmy quickly bond, and Jimmy discovers that Virgil has been taught sign language. Unbeknownst to Jimmy, once the chimpanzees reach a certain level in operating the flight simulator, they will be exposed to a lethal pulse of radiation to determine how long a pilot may survive after a nuclear exchange in carrying out a second strike.

When Jimmy becomes aware of the chimpanzees&#x27; fate, he contacts Teri, who comes to the base. Teri tells Jimmy that she will inform the NSF of the deception, but Jimmy explains that she does not have enough time because Virgil is scheduled to die soon.

Jimmy challenges Dr. Carroll and others about the project&#x27;s value by noting that the hypothetical pilot, knowing the implications of the second-strike scenario, would know that he is dying, and would, therefore, be affected by that knowledge. However, the chimpanzees would not be as aware; thus, the project is flawed. Enraged, Dr. Carroll promises Jimmy that his military career is finished.

Meanwhile, in the vivarium, some of the chimpanzees have unlocked their cages and have stacked crates and boxes to attempt an escape through a skylight. Jimmy, Teri, Dr. Carroll and the authorities walk in the vivarium to see the chimpanzees loose. Virgil is at the top of the stack and attempts to break the skylight with a crowbar. Teri sees Virgil up top and convinces him to come down. Dr. Carroll attempts to control the chimpanzees with an electric prod, but Goliath the chimpanzee overpowers Dr. Carroll and the authorities, forcing them to flee. Many chimpanzees escape the vivarium and cause havoc throughout the base, while Goliath and two other chimpanzees Winston and Spike reach the flight chamber. Inside, Goliath and the other two chimpanzees wreck the simulator and short the reactor&#x27;s wall control panel, causing the radiation reactor to go up. Jimmy, Teri and Virgil arrive and see the chimpanzees continue to wreck the flight chamber. Jimmy gets Winston and Spike out and barely escapes, however, Goliath&#x27;s refusal to leave despite Jimmy&#x27;s pleas traps him in the flight chamber just as the reactor&#x27;s wall panel short-circuits and generates a radiation blast. A fire extinguisher left by the chimps jams the reactor on its way down, posing a risk of a possible meltdown. Jimmy and Virgil convince Goliath to yank out the jammed fire extinguisher and succeed, but Goliath later dies from radiation exposure.

Jimmy and Teri steal a military plane to help the chimpanzees escape, but are stopped by the military police. While the police are holding them, Virgil pilots the plane, and the chimps fly away. They eventually crash in the nearby Everglades and evade a search. Just as the search is being abandoned, Jimmy and Teri see Virgil hiding in the bush with his chimpanzee girlfriend Ginger. Teri signs to Virgil that he and the others are now &quot;free&quot;, and the chimpanzees disappear into the Everglades.

== Production ==
Lawrence Lasker began pre-production of the film at Warner Bros. Pictures with John Badham directing, but switched to 20th Century Fox after Warner Bros insisted on using small actors in chimpanzee suits instead of real chimpanzees. The film was shot in Los Angeles and at Camarillo Airport and at Van Nuys Airport.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The movie received generally positive reviews from critics. , it holds a 75% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 20 reviews with an average rating of 6.1/10.

In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Walter Goodman described the film as a &quot;young folks&#x27; story, a sweet-natured boy-and-his-chimp tale (even the bad guys aren&#x27;t all that bad – that&#x27;s very arguable), with a dose of Animal Liberation to give the impression that something of current significance is going on.&quot;

On 5 February 1989, it was the first film ever shown on Sky Movies in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

===Controversy===
TV personality Bob Barker and the United Activists for Animal Rights accused the film&#x27;s producers of animal cruelty. The American Humane Association, which consulted during production, filed a $10 million defamation lawsuit, arguing that the animal cruelty claims were based on hearsay. In 1994, over Barker&#x27;s objections, his insurance company settled the lawsuit for $300,000.

==Aftermath==
According to a 2011 newsletter, Virgil was portrayed by &quot;Willie&quot;, who at the time of the newsletter&#x27;s publication resided at Primarily Primates wildlife refuge. Willie was sent there along with Harry, who played his ‘girlfriend’ in the movie. They were retired from the entertainment industry and lived with other males in a tightly knit group at the refuge in Bexar County, Texas.

<doc id="1232091" wikidata="Q949291" url="?curid=1232091" title="Yehudi lights">
<text>Yehudi lights are lamps of automatically controlled brightness placed on the front and leading edges of an aircraft to raise the aircraft&#x27;s luminance to the average brightness of the sky, a form of active camouflage using counter-illumination. They were designed to camouflage the aircraft by preventing it from appearing as a dark object against the sky.

The technology was developed by the US Navy from 1943 onwards, to enable a sea-search aircraft to approach a surfaced submarine to &quot;within 30 seconds of flying time&quot; before becoming visible to the submarine&#x27;s crew. This in turn enabled the aircraft to engage the submarine with depth charges before it could dive, to counter the threat from German submarines to allied shipping. The concept was based on earlier research by the Royal Canadian Navy in its diffused lighting camouflage project.

Yehudi lights were unused in the war and were made obsolete by advanced postwar radar. With 1970s improvements in stealth technology, they again attracted interest.

==Etymology==
A US National Defense Research Committee report on the history of the project explains in a footnote that the name &quot;Yehudi&quot; in then-contemporary slang meant &quot;the little man who wasn&#x27;t there&quot;. The slang may perhaps allude to the popular catchphrase and novelty song &quot;Who&#x27;s Yehudi?&quot; or &quot;Who&#x27;s Yehoodi?&quot;. The catchphrase is said to have originated when violinist Yehudi Menuhin was a guest on the popular radio program of Bob Hope, where sidekick Jerry Colonna, apparently finding the name itself humorous, repeatedly asked &quot;Who&#x27;s Yehudi?&quot;. Colonna continued the gag on later shows without Menuhin, turning &quot;Yehudi&quot; into a widely understood late 1930s slang reference for a mysteriously absent person.

==Canadian origins==

The use of Yehudi lights to camouflage aircraft by matching their luminance with the background sky was developed, in part, by the US Navy&#x27;s Project Yehudi from 1943 onwards, following pioneering experiments in the Canadian diffused lighting camouflage project for ships early in the Second World War. A Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, had serendipitously stumbled upon the principle when he saw an aircraft coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish. He realized that the reflected light had increased its brightness just enough to match the background sky. 

The ships were fitted with ordinary projectors mounted on small platforms fixed to their sides, with the projectors pointing inwards at the ship&#x27;s side. The brightness was adjusted to match the brightness of the sky. The Canadian experiment showed that such counter-illumination camouflage was possible, arousing interest in both Britain and America, but the equipment was cumbersome and fragile, and neither the Royal Canadian Navy nor their allies brought it into production.

==Active camouflage in animals==

An equivalent active camouflage strategy, known to zoologists as counter-illumination, is used by many marine organisms, including fish, shrimps, and cephalopods such as the midwater squid, &quot;Abralia veranyi&quot;. The underside is covered with small photophores, organs that produce light. The squid varies the intensity of the light according to the brightness of the sea surface far above, providing effective camouflage by painting out the animal&#x27;s silhouette with light.

==US Navy research project==

===Goal===
Yehudi lights were developed by the US Navy to help counter the &quot;menace&quot; of German submarines to Allied shipping in the North Atlantic. The United States Army Air Force&#x27;s Director Of Technical Services (DTS) asked the camouflage section of the National Defence Research Committee (NDRC) to develop a camouflage method that would allow a radar-equipped, sea-search aircraft to approach a surfaced submarine to within 30 seconds&#x27; flight time before being seen. This was to enable the aircraft to drop its depth charges before the submarine could dive.
British researchers had found that the amount of electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft&#x27;s underside in daylight was prohibitive; and that externally mounted light projectors (following the Canadian approach) unacceptably disturbed the aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamics.

The DTS, and through him the NDRC, were informed, in line with the Canadian findings, that even a white aircraft would normally appear dark against the sky. They were further told that while &quot;floodlighting&quot; the aircraft (in the manner of diffused lighting camouflage for ships) could in theory make it bright enough to match its background, that would require an impossibly large amount of electrical power: but a less power-hungry option was available, namely to use forward-facing lights, and to require the aircraft to fly within 3 degrees of the line directly towards the submarine, so that only its counter-illuminated front would face the enemy.

Pilots noted that if they chose a straight-line heading to compensate for a crosswind, the nose of the plane would not point directly at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to keep the nose pointed directly towards the target at all times, resulting in a curving approach path.

The NDRC estimated that lights could be spaced up to about apart without becoming visible as individual objects at a distance of . On this basis, it calculated that a large aircraft like a B-24 Liberator bomber could be camouflaged against the sky for a power consumption of under 500 watts. The key technology investigated under Yehudi was therefore the use of forward-facing lights to anti-submarine and attack aircraft.

===Ground prototyping===
To improve confidence in the approach, the project made a prototype in the form of a counter-illuminated plywood silhouette of a Liberator at life size, suspended from towers at a point where it could be seen from a point a little above sea level away across Oyster Bay, Long Island, so that it was seen mainly over water as a sea search aircraft would be from a submarine&#x27;s conning tower. It was fitted with sealed beam lamps made by General Electric.

The lamps had reflectors to give them a narrow beam of 3 degrees horizontally, 6 degrees vertically, to minimise power consumption for the required brightness. The lamps&#x27; brightness was controllable with a variable resistor. During a test in the winter of 1943, selecting a day when the visibility was above and the wind not so strong as to destroy the prototype, the observers could clearly see the thick cables used to hold up the model, but the silhouette itself was &quot;completely invisible&quot; with the lamps correctly adjusted.

===Aircraft trials===
The Yehudi project therefore used forward-pointing lamps mounted in the aircraft&#x27;s nose and the leading edges of the wings, or suspended beneath the wings, their brightness controlled by a circuit containing a pair of photocells to match the brightness of the sky. One photocell pointed at the sky, the other at an auxiliary lamp; the circuit adjusted lamp brightness to make the output from the two photocells equal. It was trialled in Liberators, Avenger torpedo bombers and a Navy glide bomb from 1943 to 1945.

By directing the light forwards towards an observer (rather than towards the aircraft&#x27;s skin), the system provided effective and efficient counter-illumination camouflage, more like that of marine animals such as the firefly squid than the Canadian diffused lighting approach. The system never entered active service.

===Results===
In 1945 a Grumman Avenger with Yehudi lights got within of a ship before being sighted, when under the same conditions an uncamouflaged plane was detected at a range of about . It was noted at the time that this would force the enemy either to give up radar silence, making submarines easy to locate but harder to approach, or for observers to use binoculars continually. Since 8x binoculars at the time had a field of view of only 5 degrees, whereas enemy submarines at the surface kept watch with three observers each assigned a 120 degree arc, the camouflage was considered effective.

==Later developments==
The ability to approach a target unseen was rendered obsolete by advances in radar in the 1940s and 1950s. Since the development of stealth technology, Yehudi lights have attracted renewed interest, first in 1973 when McDonnell Douglas researched a &quot;Quiet Attack&quot; aircraft for the Office of Naval Research, modifying the F-4 Phantom with Yehudi lights on its underside, and later in the 1970s when Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Skunk Works was contracted to develop a stealth aircraft prototype &quot;Have Blue&quot;, which helped to guide the development of the F-117A stealth attack aircraft and the B-2 stealth bomber.

The &quot;Have Blue&quot; prototype was disruptively camouflaged to disguise its shape from casual onlookers, as well as being constructed of angled facets to reduce its radar cross-section. The use of any form of active camouflage, whether Yehudi lights or microwave emissions, was rejected.&#x27;

<doc id="1232100" wikidata="Q2401979" url="?curid=1232100" title="Meyer lemon">
<text>Citrus&quot; × &quot;meyeri, the Meyer lemon (), is a hybrid citrus fruit native to China. It is a cross between a citron and a mandarin/pomelo hybrid. 

Mature trees are around tall with dark green shiny leaves. The flowers are white with a purple base and are fragrant. The fruit is rounder than a true lemon, deep yellow with a slight orange tint when ripe, and has a sweeter, less acidic flavor. The lemons contain a highly acidic pH of between 2 and 3. This acidity level allows for these lemons to be used as antibacterial and antiseptic cleaners.

It was introduced to the United States in 1908 as S.P.I. #23028 by the agricultural explorer Frank Nicholas Meyer, an employee of the United States Department of Agriculture who collected a sample of the plant on a trip to China. Though it is given his name, this variety was likely established thousands of years before he introduced it to America. 

The Meyer lemon is commonly grown in China in garden pots as an ornamental tree. It became popular as a food item in the United States after being rediscovered by chefs such as Alice Waters at Chez Panisse during the rise of California cuisine starting in the 1970s. Popularity further climbed when Martha Stewart began featuring them in some of her recipes.

== Description ==

&quot;Citrus&quot; × &quot;meyeri&quot; trees are around tall at maturity, though they can be pruned smaller. Their leaves are dark green and shiny. The flowers are white with a purple base and are fragrant.

The Meyer lemon fruit is yellow and rounder than a true lemon. The skin is fragrant and thin, colored a deep yellow with a slight orange tint when ripe. Meyer lemon fruits have a sweeter, less acidic flavor than the more common Lisbon or Eureka supermarket lemon varieties. The pulp is a dark yellow and contains up to 10 seeds per fruit.
== Cultivation ==
The Meyer lemon is popular as an ornamental plant for its compact size, hardiness, and productivity. It is decorative and suitable for container growing. It is one of the sweetest lemons and even the skin is edible. Growing a Meyer lemon tree can either be done in a pot or straight from the ground, but the plant requires plenty of sunlight. However, too much sunlight is possible and can burn the plant if exposed for long periods. This is why summer sun, morning sunlight, and some afternoon shade are ideal for taking the best care of the lemon tree. The tree is reasonably hardy and grows well in warm climates. It is fairly vigorous, with a plant grown from a young graft usually beginning to fruit in four years, yielding thousands of lemons over its lifetime. These plants require an adequate amount of water but well-drained soil is crucial. However, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between watering keeps the plant moist enough, but not too moist or dry. Along with watering and sunlight, Meyer lemon trees need high nitrogen fertilizer that is slow-releasing. These plants should only be given fertilizer within the growing season (spring-fall) and never in the winter unless the leaves are yellowing; then, they should be given water and fertilizer. While fruit is produced throughout the year, the majority of the crop is harvest-ready in winter. Trees require adequate water, but less in the winter. For maximum yield, they should be fertilized during growing periods.
New branches are thorny to protect the young shoots, but the thorns transform into secondary branches with age. Pruning plays a very important role in growing the most successful tree; this keeps the plant in shape and avoids unnecessary overcrowding plants to leave room for the lemons. It allows the plant to receive the proper airflow, which enhances the plant to grow strong and well while also preventing the plant from any potential diseases..&#x27;

== Culinary uses ==
The Meyer lemon is sweeter than other lemons with only a slight tartness, and is said to taste a bit like a tangerine, or a navel orange. It is used often to season fish and seafood.

== Improved Meyer ==
By the mid-1940s, the Meyer lemon had grown widely in California. However, at that time, it was discovered that most of the Meyer lemon trees being cloned were symptomless carriers of the Citrus tristeza virus, which had killed millions of citrus trees all over the world and rendered other millions useless for production. After this finding, most of the Meyer lemon trees in the United States were destroyed to save other citrus trees.

A virus-free selection was found in the 1950s and was certified and released in 1975 by the University of California as the &#x27;Improved Meyer lemon&#x27; – &quot;Citrus&quot; × &quot;meyeri&quot; &#x27;Improved&#x27;.

<doc id="1232125" wikidata="Q833616" url="?curid=1232125" title="Destroyer (Kiss album)">
<text>Destroyer is the fourth studio album by American hard rock band Kiss, released on March 15, 1976, by Casablanca Records in the US. It was the third successive Kiss album to reach the top 40 in the US, as well as the first to chart in Germany and New Zealand. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on April 22, 1976, and platinum on November 11 of the same year, the first Kiss album to achieve platinum. The album marked a departure from the raw sound of the band&#x27;s first three albums.

==Background==
After attaining modest commercial success with their first three studio albums, Kiss achieved a commercial breakthrough with the 1975 concert album &quot;Alive!&quot; It was the first album by the band to be certified gold. The success of &quot;Alive!&quot;, which spent 110 weeks on the charts, benefited not only the struggling band but also their cash-strapped label Casablanca Records. Kiss signed a new contract with Casablanca in late 1975, partly because the label had been very supportive from the start of the band&#x27;s career. The contract was for two albums, an indication that Casablanca was unsure if the group could duplicate the accomplishments of &quot;Alive!&quot;

==Songwriting and recording==
Rehearsals for &quot;Destroyer&quot; began in August 1975, while the group was embarked on their supporting tour for &quot;Alive!&quot; Bob Ezrin, who had previously worked with Alice Cooper, was brought in to produce the album. The band felt that Ezrin was the right person to help them take their sound to the next level and to maintain the commercial success they had achieved with &quot;Alive!&quot; Before meeting with Ezrin, the band had written and recorded a 15-song demo in the Magna Graphics Studio in August 1975. The first demo recorded during the &quot;Destroyer&quot; sessions was &quot;Ain&#x27;t None of Your Business&quot; featuring Peter Criss on vocals. The plodding, heavy song, written by country songwriters Becky Hobbs and Lew Anderson, was rejected by the band and later appeared on the 1977 debut album by Michael Des Barres&#x27; band Detective. Although this song was rejected, other outside songs and suggestions were accepted by the band. In particular, Kim Fowley and Mark Anthony became important contributors during the songwriting process, bringing in the title and basic structure of the song &quot;King of the Night Time World&quot; from their previous band Hollywood Stars&#x27; then-unreleased 1974 album &quot;Shine Like a Radio&quot; (which also featured the original version of the Alice Cooper song &quot;Escape&quot; from &quot;Welcome to My Nightmare&quot;).

Ezrin flat out rejected most of the material, as only heavily re-worked versions of &quot;God of Thunder&quot; and &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; made it to the album, and another song &quot;Mad Dog&quot; was pilfered for lyrics to &quot;Sweet Pain&quot; and a riff for &quot;Flaming Youth&quot;. Other songs from this demo were re-worked for the following album &quot;Rock and Roll Over&quot; and Gene Simmons&#x27; 1978 solo album while others remained unreleased until the 2021 release of &quot;Destroyer&quot; as a 2CD set and Super Deluxe box set.

The first recording sessions for the album took place on September 3–6, 1975 at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, during a brief break between the &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; and &quot;Alive!&quot; tours. The basic album tracks were recorded during this time. The majority of the recording sessions for &quot;Destroyer&quot; took place in January 1976, after the conclusion of the &quot;Alive!&quot; tour. Ezrin introduced to Kiss sound effects, strings, screaming children, reversed drums (on &quot;God of Thunder&quot;) and a children&#x27;s choir. The song &quot;Great Expectations&quot; uses the first phrase of the main theme from the second movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13 (known as &quot;Sonata Pathétique&quot;), but the songwriting is credited to Simmons and Ezrin.

During the recording sessions, Ezrin resorted to numerous tactics designed to increase the quality of music Kiss recorded. Because none of the group were trained musicians, Ezrin halted the sessions at one point to provide lessons in basic music theory. To instill a sense of discipline, he wore a whistle around his neck and exhorted the band with sayings such as, &quot;Campers, we&#x27;re going to work!&quot; When Simmons stopped playing during the recording of an outro, Ezrin yelled at him, saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t you ever stop a take unless I tell you!&quot;

Paul Stanley later compared the experience of working with Ezrin as &quot;musical boot camp&quot; but said that the group &quot;came out a lot smarter for it.&quot; Simmons echoed the sentiment by stating, &quot;It was exactly what we needed at the time.&quot;

&quot;Destroyer&quot; is the first Kiss album to prominently feature outside musicians, such as members of the New York Philharmonic. One musician not credited was Dick Wagner, from Alice Cooper&#x27;s band, replacing Ace Frehley on the track &quot;Sweet Pain&quot;. Wagner also played the acoustic guitar found on the song &quot;Beth&quot;. The success of &quot;Alive!&quot; and &quot;Destroyer&quot; enabled the band to embark on their first tour of Europe.

==Artwork==
The cover art for &quot;Destroyer&quot; was painted by fantasy artist Ken Kelly. Kelly was invited to a show and given a backstage pass. He said of the performance, &quot;It blew me away.&quot; Kelly was later commissioned by the band to draw the cover for 1977&#x27;s &quot;Love Gun&quot;.

Kelly&#x27;s original version of the album cover was rejected by the record company because they felt the scene was too violent looking with the rubble and flames. Also, the original version had the members of Kiss wearing the &quot;Alive!&quot; costumes. The front cover shows the group striding on top of a pile of rubble, and a desolate background spotted with destroyed buildings, some of which are engulfed in flames. The back cover shows a similar scene, but with more buildings on fire. The front of the inner sleeve featured a large Kiss logo and the lyrics to &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;. The other side displayed the lyric &quot;Shout it out loud&quot;, as well as an advertisement for the Kiss Army fan club.

==Reception==
&quot;Destroyer&quot; sold well upon its release on March 15, 1976, and was certified gold on April 22. Although exact sales figures are not known, Stanley stated that the album initially sold 850,000 copies in the US, well over any of Kiss&#x27;s first three studio albums. After peaking at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart on May 15, &quot;Destroyer&quot; quickly fell and by August was at No. 192. The first three singles—&quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot;, &quot;Flaming Youth&quot; and &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;—failed to ignite sales any further, though &quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot; did give the band their first No. 1 record, in Canada. The band and Ezrin cited fan backlash as the reason &quot;Destroyer&quot; did not meet sales expectations. Ezrin also stated that the &quot;grassroots rock press&quot; was particularly critical of the album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to &quot;bloated ballads&quot;, &quot;pedestrian drumming&quot; and &quot;lackluster performances&quot; in its review. Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, felt that it was Kiss&#x27;s &quot;least interesting record&quot; and criticized producer Ezrin for adding &quot;only bombast and melodrama&quot;. It was not until radio stations started playing the B-side of the &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; single &quot;Beth&quot;, that the album started to sell as expected. The ballad, which according to Simmons was deliberately put on the B-side to force stations to play &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;, started receiving numerous listener requests and became an unexpected hit. &quot;Beth&quot; (co-written and sung by Peter Criss) was re-released as the fourth single in late August, and it peaked at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart on September 25. It was the group&#x27;s first Top 10 song in the US and reignited sales of the album.

On November 11, 1976 &quot;Destroyer&quot; became the first Kiss album to be certified platinum. The album was re-certified at the double platinum level on September 9, 2011 and is the band&#x27;s best selling in the post-1991 Soundscan era, selling 726,000 copies in the United States from 1991 to March 4, 2012.

The album has received recognition in later years. In 1989, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine listed the album at No. 36 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Rob Sheffield referred to &quot;Destroyer&quot; as &quot;the inevitable arty concept album, from the drink-smoke-drive-die saga &#x27;Detroit Rock City&#x27; to the touching &#x27;Do You Love Me?&#x27;&quot;. The album was also featured in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2006, it was placed at No. 60 on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time. Greg Prato of AllMusic described &quot;Destroyer&quot; as &quot;one of Kiss&#x27; most experimental studio albums, but also one of their strongest and most interesting.&quot; Pitchfork&#x27;s Jason Josephes said that it is &quot;easily one of the best albums in the Kiss canon&quot; and credited Ezrin for ushering along &quot;even more of an art/hard rock album than Kiss&#x27;s previous efforts.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff, described &quot;Destroyer&quot; as a &quot;no party album, looming darkly, ponderous, almost haunting at times, basically uncommunicative and puzzling due to its stylistic over-extension&quot; and judged it a &quot;success of early no-chops metal&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at No. 489 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, calling it &quot;a ridiculously over-the-top party-rock album that just gets better with age&quot;.

==&quot;Destroyer: Resurrected&quot;==
In anticipation of the 35th anniversary of the release of &quot;Destroyer&quot;, producer Bob Ezrin approached Simmons and Stanley about doing a remix and re-release of the original album. With their approval, Ezrin acquired digital copies of the original 16-track analog master tapes. In addition to re-equalizing elements of each song, Ezrin also added in some parts of tracks that had been omitted from the original mix. These include some additional vocals on &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;Beth&quot;, and the substitution of a guitar solo by Frehley on &quot;Sweet Pain&quot; for the one from the original that had been performed by Wagner (a version of &quot;Sweet Pain&quot; with Frehley&#x27;s solo was included as track 6, while the original version with Wagner&#x27;s solo is appended as a &quot;bonus&quot; track at the end of the new CD). Ezrin also used digital manipulation to fix an incorrect lyric (changing &quot;down 95&quot; to &quot;doin&#x27; 95&quot;) on &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;. The resulting album, titled &quot;Destroyer: Resurrected&quot;, was released on August 21, 2012. It featured Ken Kelly&#x27;s original cover artwork before alteration by Casablanca for the 1976 release.

&quot;Destroyer: Resurrected&quot; met with mixed critical reception. William Clark of &quot;Guitar International&quot; wrote: &quot;Each track sounds crisper, clearer and louder, which are always welcome qualities when you&#x27;re listening to a classic album of the likes of &quot;Destroyer&quot;&quot;. However, &quot;Circus&quot; magazine in a joint review with Aerosmith&#x27;s contemporary release of &quot;Rocks&quot; praised &quot;Rocks&quot; while stating that &quot;Destroyer&quot; &quot;stinks.&quot; The album returned to the Billboard charts, debuting at No. 11 the week after its re-release. In 2019, the record was released in orange translucent vinyl, retailed exclusively by Walmart in the U.S.

<doc id="1232136" wikidata="Q1502183" url="?curid=1232136" title="HMS Victoria (1887)">
<text>HMS &quot;Victoria&quot; was the lead ship in her class of two battleships of the Royal Navy. On 22 June 1893, she collided with near Tripoli, Lebanon, during manoeuvres and quickly sank, killing 358 crew members, including the commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet, Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon. One of the survivors was executive officer John Jellicoe, later commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland.

==Design==

&quot;Victoria&quot; was constructed at a time of innovation and rapid development in ship design. Her name was originally to be &quot;Renown&quot;, but this was changed to &quot;Victoria&quot; while still under construction to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, which took place the year the ship was launched. Her arrival was accompanied by considerable publicity. She was the largest, fastest and most powerful ironclad afloat, with the heaviest guns.

She was the first battleship to be propelled by triple-expansion steam engines. These were constructed by Humphrys, Tennant and Company of Deptford and had cylinders of diameters , and with stroke of . They produced under forced draught, or under open draught. She was also the first Royal Navy ship to be equipped with a steam turbine which was used to run a dynamo.

A detailed model of the ship was exhibited at the Royal Navy exhibition in 1892, and another in silver was given to Queen Victoria by the officers of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines as a Jubilee gift.

===Design limitations===

Despite the ship&#x27;s many impressive features, compromises in the design meant that she proved less than successful in service.

The ship was nicknamed &#x27;the Slipper&#x27; (or when with her sister ship , also attached to the Mediterranean squadron, &#x27;the pair of Slippers&#x27;) because of a tendency for her low foredeck to disappear from view in even slight seas, and especially, as a result of the low forward deck and raised aft superstructure, for the two ships&#x27; humorously perceived resemblance to the indoor footwear.

 The forward deck held a single turret with two BL Mark I guns. The gun was chosen because similar large guns had been used in foreign ships, and because of difficulties in obtaining the navy&#x27;s preferred design. The great weight of the forward turret with its two guns meant that it had to be mounted low so as not to detract from the ship&#x27;s stability, and that a similar large gun and turret could not be mounted aft. Instead, the after gun was a BL gun protected by a gun shield.

The original plan was for main armament fore and aft, and the eventual layout, which followed that of the preceding ironclad battleship , was a compromise that meant the ship could only fire her main armament sideways or forward. It was found that if the guns were fired directly forward, the recoil buckled the deck. 

The gun barrels were found to be so heavy that they drooped when installed on their mountings, and could fire only 75 rounds before barrel wear became excessive.

Her main armour extended only along some of her total length varying from thick. By comparison, the French battleship &quot;Amiral Baudin&quot;, constructed at a similar time, had armour along her whole length. However, the British design produced a faster ship with greater range and larger guns.

==Captains and fleet commanders==
&quot;Victoria&quot; was first commissioned in March 1890 by Captain J. E. Stokes, who took the ship to the Mediterranean. This crew then swapped ships with the crew of &quot;Camperdown&quot;, so that Captain J. C. Burnell now took command. The ship was now flagship of the Mediterranean squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Anthony Hoskins. In 1891, Sir George Tryon succeeded as fleet commander and Captain Maurice Bourke became the new flag captain onboard &quot;Victoria&quot;.

==1892 grounding==

On 29 January 1892, &quot;Victoria&quot; ran aground at Snipe Point near Platea on the Greek coast. Platea had been selected as a convenient friendly port for British ships to use as a base for exercises with torpedoes and mines, and each ship of the Mediterranean Fleet would go there in turn during the winter. Torpedoes would be launched from fast-moving ships in real battle conditions, but it was desirable to practise this in relatively shallow waters so that the torpedoes could be recovered afterwards (they were supposed to float once their motors stopped, but sometimes sank). Captain Bourke had appreciated the potential difficulties of operating his ship in shallow waters, and had ordered a crew to set out a buoy offshore at the place where the water shoaled to . But the crew missed the shallowest point, and &quot;Victoria&quot; grounded on the rocky shoal at and stuck fast. The fore end of the ship ended up higher out of the water than would be normal, as momentum drove it up onto the shoal. The ship&#x27;s bottom was damaged, and three compartments flooded. The stern, however, was still in of water. Admiral Tryon was notified and departed for the scene in , also ordering a dockyard tug &quot;Sampson&quot; with pumping equipment and hawsers. – a torpedo-depot ship – was already at Platea and made two attempts to tow &quot;Victoria&quot; free. These failed, but she assisted with laying anchors to hold the rear of the ship steady until further help could arrive. , , , and were also called to the scene.

&quot;Victoria&quot; was lightened by removing , including of coal thrown overboard. The leaks were patched up by creating temporary bulkheads and using timber and Portland cement to block holes. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and &quot;Edinburgh&quot; each had hawsers attached to &quot;Victoria&quot; so they could pull astern. &quot;Sampson&quot; was lashed alongside so that she could pull backwards, and &quot;Victoria&quot;″s own engines were run astern. This was sufficient to move the ship, and she was refloated on the evening of 4 February. The ship proceeded to the new Hamilton Dock in Malta for repairs, being the first ship to use it. The hull plating was ripped and torn for a distance of , with some plates being folded into &#x27;S&#x27; shapes, although the mild steel bent rather than cracked. Repairs were completed in time for the summer fleet cruise in May.

==Sinking==

On 22 June 1893, &quot;Victoria&quot; was leading the Mediterranean Fleet&#x27;s annual exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ship was at the head of a division of ships, while 1,200 yards to starboard was a second division of five ships led by . Admiral Tryon ordered a manoeuvre that was to see each ship turn, one after the other in formation, to steam in the opposite direction. However, with the ships just 1,200 yards apart, and an estimated minimum turning circle of at least 1,600 yards, &quot;Victoria&quot;, the first ship to turn, was struck by the armoured ram of &quot;Camperdown&quot; as it turned, causing massive damage to the flagship. &quot;Victoria&quot; eventually sank in approximately 15 minutes, with 358 members of the crew, including Admiral Tryon, lost.

==Wreck site==
After a search that lasted ten years, the wreck was discovered on 22 August 2004 in of water by the Lebanese-Austrian diver Christian Francis, aided by the British diver Mark Ellyatt. She stands vertically with the bow and some 30 metres of her length buried in the mud with the stern pointing directly upwards towards the surface. This position is not unique among shipwrecks as first thought, as the Russian monitor also rests like this. The unusual attitude of this wreck is thought to have been due to the heavy single turret forward containing the main armament coupled with the still-turning propellers driving the wreck downwards.

<text>Edward Clark Gallagher (September 5, 1887 – August 28, 1940) was an American wrestling coach. He coached at Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College—now known as Oklahoma State University–Stillwater—from 1916 to 1940. With his knowledge of physical principles like leverage and stress, along with anatomy, he all but invented the modern style of folkstyle wrestling. He remains one of the most successful coaches in NCAA athletics history. Overall in his wrestling coaching career at Oklahoma A&amp;M, his teams went 136–5–4, including 19 undefeated seasons and 11 NCAA titles.

Gallagher-Iba Arena on campus at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma, is named after him. In 1976, Gallagher was inducted into the inaugural class of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as a Distinguished Member.

==Early years==
Gallagher was born in Perth, Kansas on September 5, 1887.

In high school and college, he excelled in football and track. While a student at Oklahoma A&amp;M (now Oklahoma State), Gallagher won the 100-yard dash in a Southwest Conference meet in 9.8 seconds. In 1908, he ran for a 99-yard touchdown against Kansas State, which still stands as a school record for longest run from scrimmage.

Gallagher didn&#x27;t wrestle as a competitor, only coaching wrestling during his high school and collegiate days. Later after becoming the head wrestling coach at Oklahoma A&amp;M, he would spend the rest of his career involved in wrestling.

==Coaching career==
===Early coaching career===
Gallagher earned a degree in electrical engineering from Oklahoma A&amp;M in 1909. Upon graduation, he stayed at the Stillwater school, where he served as track coach. In 1913, he left Oklahoma A&amp;M for Baker University in Baldwin City, Kansas, where he coached all sports.

He held the head football coach position at Baker for the 1913 and 1914 seasons. His football coaching record at Baker was 8 wins and 8 losses.

===Oklahoma A&amp;M===

In 1915, he returned to Oklahoma A&amp;M as athletic director. During the 1914–15 school year, Oklahoma A&amp;M started its wrestling program, with A.M. Colville as coach. That first season, the team wrestled only one dual meet, and lost to the University of Texas. In the 1915–16 school year, Gallagher named himself wrestling coach while remaining athletic director. The team again had only one dual meet, and again lost to Texas. However, by the second year, Gallagher&#x27;s wrestlers competed in three duals, winning two (against Emporia State and Texas) and tying with Arkansas. The team did not compete during World War I.

In the years immediately after World War I, Gallagher&#x27;s Oklahoma A&amp;M wrestlers—by now known as the Cowboys—never had a losing season. In the eleven-year period from the 1919–20 through the 1930–31 seasons, the team had 70 straight wins. The streak was broken in the last dual meet of the 1930–31 season against cross-state rival, the University of Oklahoma Sooners. During the rest of the 1930s, the Cowboys lost only one other dual meet (at Southwestern Oklahoma State in the 1936–37 season) and had three ties.

In 1928, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) held its first national college wrestling championship. At that first NCAAs—hosted by Iowa State—Gallagher&#x27;s wrestlers won four of the seven titles. In the thirteen years of NCAA championships with Gallagher as coach, 22 individual Cowboy wrestlers won a total of 37 NCAA titles.

===Olympic success===
From 1924 through 1936, fifteen of Ed Gallagher&#x27;s wrestlers qualified for U.S. Olympic teams, along with Earl McCready competing for his native Canada at the 1928 Olympics, and George Chiga wrestling for Canada in 1936.

Four Cowboy Olympic wrestlers coached by Gallagher earned medals. Bobby Pearce and Jack VanBebber both won gold medals at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. At the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Frank Lewis won the gold, while teammate Ross Flood earned silver.

Ed Gallagher served as honorary coach for the 1936 U.S. Olympic team.

===Scientific approach to wrestling===
Using his engineering knowledge, Gallagher studied leverage, and how it applied to wrestling. Gallagher selected over 400 wrestling holds, and expected each of his wrestlers to master about 200.

Gallagher openly shared what he learned with others. He and his teams often conducted wrestling demonstrations before or after dual meets. In 1939, he and his Cowboy wrestlers demonstrated holds in a three-page photo-article in Life magazine. He also wrote two instructional books, &quot;Amateur Wrestling&quot; and &quot;Wrestling.&quot;

==Later life==
In the 1930s, Gallagher was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In 1938, he retired as director of physical education but remained on as wrestling coach.

February 3, 1939 was &quot;Gallagher Day&quot; at Oklahoma A&amp;M and Stillwater, the day the new 4-H Club and Student Activity Building was dedicated. Soon afterward, it was renamed Gallagher Hall in Gallagher&#x27;s honor. This structure has since been renamed Gallagher-Iba Arena to honor both Gallagher and Henry Iba, long-time basketball coach at Oklahoma A&amp;M/State.

The Cowboys&#x27; first season in the new arena was the last to be coached by Gallagher. He died on a vacation to Colorado on August 28, 1940. His funeral was held in the arena.

==Honors==
In 1976, Gallagher was inducted into the inaugural class of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as a Distinguished Member. For the 75th anniversary of the NCAA wrestling championships in 2005, Gallagher was named by wrestling fans as one of the three all-time great college wrestling coaches (along with Dan Gable, University of Iowa, and Harold Nichols, Iowa State University). Gallagher&#x27;s name is also on the award given each year to an outstanding Oklahoma A&amp;M wrestling alumnus.

<doc id="1232145" wikidata="Q254768" url="?curid=1232145" title="Tetrahydrocannabivarin">
<text>Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV, THV, O-4394, GWP42004) is a homologue of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) having a propyl (3-carbon) side chain instead of pentyl (5-carbon), making it non-psychoactive in lower doses. It has been shown to exhibit neuroprotective activity, appetite suppression, glycemic control and reduced side effects compared to THC, making it a potential treatment for management of obesity and diabetes. THCV was studied by Roger Adams as early as 1942.

==Natural occurrence==
THCV is prevalent in certain central Asian and southern African strains of &quot;Cannabis&quot;.

== Chemistry ==
Similar to THC, THCV has 7 possible double bond isomers and 30 stereoisomers (see: Tetrahydrocannabinol#Isomerism). The alternative isomer Δ8-THCV is known as a synthetic compound with a code number of O-4395, but it is not known to have been isolated from &quot;Cannabis&quot; plant material.
== Description ==
Plants with elevated levels of propyl cannabinoids (including THCV) have been found in populations of &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; L. ssp. &quot;indica&quot; (= &quot;Cannabis indica&quot; Lam.) from China, India, Nepal, Thailand, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as southern and western Africa. THCV levels up to 20% of total cannabinoids have been reported.

THCV is a cannabinoid receptor type 1 antagonist or, at higher doses, a CB1 receptor agonist and cannabinoid receptor type 2 partial agonist. Δ8-THCV has also been shown to be a CB1 antagonist. Both papers describing the antagonistic properties of THCV were demonstrated in murine models. THCV is an antagonist of THC at CB1 receptors and lessens the psychoactive effects of THC.

THCV also acts as an agonist of GPR55 and l-α-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), and beyond the endocannabinoid system, THCV also activate 5-HT1A receptors to produce an antipsychotic effect, that has shown therapeutic potential for ameliorating some of the negative, cognitive and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. THCV furthermore interacts with different transient receptor potential (TRP) channels including TRPV2, which may contribute to the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects of cannabinoids and Cannabis extracts. It has also shown anti-epileptiform and anticonvulsant properties, that suggest possible therapeutic application in the treatment of pathophysiologic hyperexcitability states such as untreatable epilepsy.

THCV is found to inhibit the activity of both fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacyl glycerol lipase (MGL), even at micromolar concentrations, and thereby able to inhibit the hydrolysis of the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA: C22H37NO2; 20:4, ω-6) besides other &quot;N&quot;-acylethanolamines and 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG: C23H38O4; 20:4, ω-6), respectively, therefore, it can also act as an indirect agonist at the cannabinoid receptors, by enhancing the activity of the endocannabinoid system (ECS).

== Biosynthesis ==
Unlike THC, cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabichromene (CBC), THCV doesn&#x27;t begin as cannabigerolic acid (CBGA). Instead of combining with olivetolic acid to create CBGA, geranyl pyrophosphate joins with divarinolic acid, which has two fewer carbon atoms. The result is cannabigerovarin acid (CBGVA). Once CBGVA is created, the process continues exactly the same as it would for THC. CBGVA is broken down to tetrahydrocannabivarin carboxylic acid (THCVA) by the enzyme THCV synthase. At that point, THCVA can be decarboxylated with heat or UV light to create THCV.

== Research ==

===Reducing blood sugar===
THCV is a new potential treatment against obesity-associated glucose intolerance with pharmacology different from that of CB1 inverse agonists/antagonists. GW Pharmaceuticals is studying plant-derived tetrahydrocannabivarin (as GWP42004) for type 2 diabetes in addition to metformin.

===Appetite control===
THC increases appetite, which is sometimes referred to as &quot;the munchies.&quot; THC acts as a CB1 agonist. As a CB1 antagonist,
THCV has been shown to reduce appetite in murine models.

=== Energy and motivation ===
A 2:1 ratio of naturally derived THCV to THC extract has been demonstrated to show energizing and motivating effects in a double blind placebo clinical study which relied on a self-reported user survey for results.

==Legal status==
It is not scheduled by Convention on Psychotropic Substances. 

===United States===
THCV is not scheduled at the federal level so long as it is not derived from cannabis varieties that produce more than .3% THC on a dry weight basis in the United States.

The 2018 United States farm bill legalized the production and sale of THCV if it is derived from hemp compliant with the farm bill.

<text>Magnolia obovata, the Japanese cucumber tree, Japanese bigleaf magnolia, or Japanese whitebark magnolia, is a species of &quot;Magnolia&quot;, native to Japan and the adjacent Kurile Islands. It grows at altitudes near sea level up to 1,800 m in mixed broadleaf forests.

==Description==

It is a medium-sized deciduous tree 15–30 m tall, with slate grey bark. The leaves are large, 16–38 cm (rarely to 50 cm) long and 9–20 cm (rarely 25 cm) broad, leathery, green above, silvery or greyish pubescent below, and with an acute apex. They are held in whorls of five to eight at the end of each shoot. The flowers are also large, cup-shaped, 15–20 cm diameter, with 9-12 creamy, fleshy tepals, red stamens; they have a strong scent, and are produced in early summer after the leaves expand. The fruit is an oblong-cylindric aggregate of follicles 12–20 cm long and 6 cm broad, bright pinkish red, each follicle containing one or two black seeds with a fleshy orange-red coating.

==Uses==
The wood is strong, light, and easy to work, sought by craftsmen. In parts of Japan, the large leaves are used for wrapping food, and also as a makeshift dish to grill meat or vegetables, such as leeks, mushrooms, and miso in &quot;hoba miso&quot;.

<doc id="1232161" wikidata="Q1087840" url="?curid=1232161" title="Concurring opinion">
<text>In law, a concurring opinion is in certain legal systems a written opinion by one or more judges of a court which agrees with the decision made by the majority of the court, but states different (or additional) reasons as the basis for their decision. When no absolute majority of the court can agree on the basis for deciding the case, the decision of the court may be contained in a number of concurring opinions, and the concurring opinion joined by the greatest number of judges is referred to as the plurality opinion.

As a practical matter, concurring opinions are slightly less useful to lawyers than majority opinions. Having failed to receive a majority of the court&#x27;s votes, concurring opinions are not binding precedent and cannot be cited as such. But concurring opinions can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive precedent (assuming the point of law is one on which there is no binding precedent already in effect). The conflict in views between a majority opinion and a concurring opinion can assist a lawyer in understanding the points of law articulated in the majority opinion. Occasionally, a judge will use a concurring opinion to signal an openness to certain types of test cases that would facilitate the development of a new legal rule, and in turn, such a concurring opinion may become more famous than the majority opinion in the same case. A well-known example of this phenomenon is &quot;Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.&quot; (1944).

Concurring opinions may be held by courts but not expressed: in many legal systems the court &quot;speaks with one voice&quot; and thus any concurring or dissenting opinions are not reported. Some view concurring opinions as &quot;unnecessary confusion&quot; that &quot;encourage litigation&quot; and create &quot;legal clutter.&quot;

==Types of concurring opinions==

There are several kinds of concurring opinion. A simple concurring opinion arises when a judge joins the decision of the court but has something to add. Concurring in judgment means that the judge agrees with the majority &quot;decision&quot; (the case&#x27;s ultimate outcome in terms of who wins and who loses) but not with the reasoning of the majority opinion (&quot;why&quot; one side wins and the other loses).

==Concurring opinions by region==
In some courts, such as the Supreme Court of the United States, the majority opinion may be broken down into numbered or lettered parts, and then concurring justices may state that they join some parts of the majority opinion, but not others, for the reasons given in their concurring opinion. In other courts, such as the Supreme Court of California, the same justice may write a majority opinion &quot;and&quot; a separate concurring opinion to express additional reasons in support of the judgment (which are joined only by a minority).

In some jurisdictions (e.g., California), the term may be abbreviated in certain contexts to conc. opn.

==Terminology at the various courts==
*At the International Court of Justice, the term &quot;separate opinion&quot; is used and judges can also add declarations to the judgment.
*The term concurring opinion is used at the Supreme Court of the United States.
*The European Court of Human Rights uses the term concurring opinion and calls both concurring and dissenting opinions separate opinions. Judges very rarely add declarations to the judgment.
*Historically the Law Lords of the United Kingdom gave each an opinion of their own and no aggregated judgment was provided. However, the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom allows for such aggregated judgements, and it is theoretically possible for such concurring opinions to now arise.

==Notable concurring opinions==
* &quot;Whitney v. California&quot; (1927): Justice Louis Brandeis, free speech, became precedent 50 years later in &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot;.
* &quot;Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.&quot; (1944): Justice Roger Traynor, strict liability for manufacturers, became precedent 19 years later in &quot;Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.&quot;
* &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot; (1952): Justice Robert H. Jackson, definitive test for the limits of Presidential power.
* &quot;Katz v. United States&quot; (1967): Justice John Marshall Harlan II, formulated the &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; test for determining the reasonableness of a search.

<text>Frederick Henry Harvey (June 27, 1835 – February 9, 1901) was an entrepreneur who developed the Harvey House lunch rooms, restaurants, souvenir shops, and hotels, which served rail passengers on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, the Gulf Colorado and Santa Fe Railway, the Kansas Pacific Railway, the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, and the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis.

As an innovative restaurateur and marketer, Fred Harvey is credited with creating the first restaurant chain in the United States. He was also a leader in promoting tourism in the American Southwest in the late 19th century. Fred Harvey and his employees successfully brought new higher standards of both civility and dining to a region widely regarded in the era as &quot;the Wild West.&quot; He created a legacy which was continued by his sons and remained in the family until the death of a grandson in 1965.

Despite the decline of passenger train patronage in the United States in the 20th century with the advent of the automobile, portions of the Fred Harvey Company have continued to operate since 1968 as part of a larger hospitality industry conglomerate.

== Early life ==
Frederick Henry Harvey was born to mixed Scottish and English parents, and immigrated into the United States from Liverpool, England, in 1853 at the age of 17. He took a job in New York City as a pot scrubber and busboy at Smith and McNell&#x27;s restaurant, a popular New York city restaurant. There he learned the business from the establishment&#x27;s quirky proprietors, Henry Smith and T. R. McNell. They taught him the importance of quality service, fresh ingredients and the handshake deal. Harvey quickly worked his way up to busboy, waiter and line cook. 

This early entry into the world of food service would have large impacts later in his life. He moved from New York to New Orleans after 18 months, where he survived a bout with yellow fever, and then to St. Louis where he worked in a jewelry store. In 1856 he married Barbara Sarah Mattas, with whom he would have six children.

== Railroad employment ==
Despite successful employment, Harvey felt compelled to return to the food industry. He started a Café with a partner, and the two ran a profitable business. However, the Civil War soon interfered. The partner was sympathetic to the Confederacy and left town, taking all of the money the two had earned. Harvey soon got back on his feet, working for the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad which was eventually purchased by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. He ascended the corporate ladder and was transferred to Leavenworth, Kansas, which would remain his home. Harvey traveled frequently while working for the railroads and found himself deeply dissatisfied with the food served to travelers.

== Entrepreneurship ==
Harvey discovered his calling when in 1873, he began a business venture with Jasper &quot;Jeff&quot; S. Rice to set up two eating houses two hundred and eighty miles apart along the Kansas Pacific Railroad, but once again the partnership was doomed. 

Harvey&#x27;s partnership with the Santa Fe began in 1876 when he struck a deal with an acquaintance, Charles Morse, the superintendent of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Harvey opened eating houses along the railroad, and was not charged rent by Morse. The deal was sealed only with a handshake, but it would have huge ramifications for both parties. At their peak, there were 84 Harvey Houses, all of which catered to wealthy and middle-class visitors alike and Harvey became known as &quot;the Civilizer of the West.&quot;

Harvey also gained a boost in business with his incorporation of the &quot;Harvey Girl&quot;. He hired women between the ages of 18 and 30 and did not permit them to marry until they had put in a full year of work. Harvey Girls resided in housing adjacent to the restaurants, where they were supervised by the most senior Girl, who enforced curfews and chaperoned male visits. Roughly 5000 Harvey Girls moved out West to work and ultimately marry. Harvey Houses continued to be built and operated into the 1960s. Harvey was the head of the Fred Harvey Company, which operated the hotel and restaurant chain under the leadership of his sons and grandsons until 1965. It was sold in 1968 to the Hawaii-based hospitality industry conglomerate Amfac, Inc. 

When Fred Harvey died (of intestinal cancer), there were 47 Harvey House restaurants, 15 hotels, and 30 dining cars operating on the Santa Fe Railway. While some have reported his last words to his sons as &quot;Don&#x27;t cut the ham too thin, boys,&quot; there is another account which addresses the realities of doing business:

&quot;&quot;His sandwiches of ham or cheese with an extra slice of bread (three slices in all) for fifteen cents were known everywhere for their value. Of course he had to make his profit or he could not stay in business and therefore this story was told rather reverently by his employees and other denizens of the Southwest spaces. On his deathbed, instead of mentioning debts or bequests to his relatives, he was supposed to have murmured, &quot;Cut the ham thinner, boys.&quot;&quot;

== Innovations in marketing ==
Harvey is also known for pioneering the art of commercial cultural tourism. His &quot;Indian Detours&quot; were meant to provide an authentic Native American experience by having actors stage a certain lifestyle in the desert in order to sell tickets to unwitting tourists. Fred Harvey&#x27;s feats of marketing did not stop at the attraction either, as for tour guides he used attractive women in outfits becoming their figures. This tactic was adapted from his restaurants, where Harvey Girls worked as waitresses.

Fred Harvey was also a postcard publisher, touted as &quot;the best way to promote your Hotel or Restaurant.&quot; Most postcards were published in co-operation with the Detroit Publishing Company. Their Arizona &quot;Phostint&quot; postcards are collected worldwide.

== Heritage ==
Fred Harvey, through the Fred Harvey Company, is credited with creating the first &quot;chain&quot; restaurants in the United States. He is viewed as the &quot;founding father of the American service industry.&quot; A &quot;Fred Harvey Museum&quot; is located in the former Harvey residence in Leavenworth, Kansas. 

A movie musical entitled &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;, starring Judy Garland, Cyd Charisse and Angela Lansbury, and based on a near-pulp novel by Samuel Hopkins Adams, was made in 1946. It won the Academy Award for Best Song for &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.&quot; In the 1995 steampunk alternate history novel &quot;The Two Georges&quot; by Richard Dreyfuss and Harry Turtledove, Harvey is mentioned in the first chapter as having been in the business of airships in addition to railroads.

<doc id="1232166" wikidata="Q586734" url="?curid=1232166" title="Ribeiras">
<text>Ribeiras is a civil parish in the municipality of Lajes do Pico in the Azores. The population in 2011 was 925, in an area of 34.17 km2. It contains the localities Cabeços, Caminho de Cima, Canto, Cruz, Ladeira do Capitão, Pontas Negras, Manchillas, Outeiros, Ribeira Grande, Ribeira Seca, Ribeiras and Santa Bárbara.

==History==
The first navigators dropped anchor in the deep waters of the Bay of Ribeiras around 1460, taking advantage of the numerous ravines that descended from the mountains of the north. These early settlers were primarily fisherman, constructing boats and working during the day, and populating some areas near access to potable water. In 1502, countrymen of Fernão Álvares Evangelho, the first settler of Lajes, arrived in the area of Santa Cruz and joined-up with Fernão Álvares following many of the paths and trails originally travelled by animals deposited on the island by Infante D. Henriques&#x27;s early exploration fleets. One of the first settlements, Santa Cruz was an homage of faith to those fishers that returned successfully every year, after living off the sea, on long voyages, hunting whale, fishing for tuna and other species. Other settlers cultivated the patchwork of parcels, growing corn, constructing mills in many of the ravines, and raising cattle to support, initially, a subsistence lifestyle. These early settlers constructed a chapel to the invocation of Nossa Senhora do Socorro, though they eventually constructed a new Church to honor Santa Barbara, which gave its name to the new community in the 16th Century.

During the Liberalist Wars, on April 21, 1831, a military division commanded by the Count of Villafor, disembarked in the port of Ribeiras. This was part of a concerted attempt to take the island of Faial:

:&quot;The Liberal troops crossed the parish until reaching Madalena, in the intention of taking the island of Faial. During the passage they practiced clear acts of vandalism, in addition to the impositions that they made on the populous, that they furnish meat and other elements...&quot;

Wooden ships, such as the Carmona and Salazar, owned by Master João Alves, marked the life and socio-economic activity of the settlements, marked by the exchange of produce from the land and fish caught in the sea. It was in Ribeiras that the first boats were launched to link inter-island commerce, such as the Andorinha (launched in 1915) and the Ribeirense (launched in 1916), the first motorized yacht to circulate in the waters of the Azores.

==Geography==

The parish of Ribeiras is an administrative division extending from the parish of Lajes do Pico in the west to Piedade along the eastern coast. It consists of mountainous hills that slope into the Atlantic Ocean, and includes several ravines and river-valleys. Towards the interior, there are many craters and spatter cones that comprise the portions of the Achada Plain and the Topo Volcanic Complex. These lands are primarily peat-bogs and populated by scrub vegetation, as well as lake-filled depressions or cones, such as Lagoa do Paul (in the northeastern corner of the parish).

The first settlements were established in the semi-regular plain in the area of Santa Cruz (in the western part of the parish). As growth occurred, new settlements popped-up along the flanks of the mountain, around Arrife, expanding along the Caminho de Cima and Caminho de Baixo, and farther along the roads to the localities of Pontas Negras, Ribeira Seca and Ribeira Grande.

<text>Francisco de Peñalosa (c. 1470 – April 1, 1528) was a Spanish composer of the middle Renaissance.

==Life==
He was born in Talavera de la Reina in the province of Toledo. He spent most of his career in Seville, serving as the &quot;maestro di capilla&quot;, though he also spent time in Burgos, and three years in Rome at the papal chapel (1518–1521). He died in Seville.

==Music and influence==
Peñalosa was one of the most famous Spanish composers of the generation before Cristóbal de Morales, and his compositions were highly regarded at the time. Unfortunately for him, his music was not widely distributed; he did not benefit from the invention of printing, since he mostly remained in Spain, away from cities such as Venice and Antwerp which were the first centers of printed music. Later generations of Spanish composers—Guerrero, Morales, Victoria—went to Italy for parts of their careers, where their compositions were printed and were as widely distributed as the music of the Franco-Flemish composers who dominated music in Europe in the 16th century.

Peñalosa wrote masses, Magnificat settings, motets and hymns. Eleven secular compositions have survived, including an ensalada (a form of quodlibet) &quot;Por las sierras de Madrid&quot; for six voices.

Peñalosa was evidently fond of contrapuntal puzzles and canons, as evidenced by the quodlibet, and by the Agnus Dei of his &quot;Missa Ave Maria peregrina&quot;, which combines a plainsong tune with a retrograde (backwards) version of a famous secular song by Hayne van Ghizeghem.

One of his motets (&quot;Sancta mater istud agas&quot;) was long assumed to be by Josquin des Prez, which indicates both the stylistic similarity of their music and the high quality of Peñalosa&#x27;s.

<doc id="1232201" wikidata="Q1290260" url="?curid=1232201" title="From Hell letter">
<text>The &quot;From Hell&quot; letter (also known as the &quot;Lusk letter&quot;) was a letter sent with half of a preserved human kidney to George Lusk, the chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, in October 1888. The author of this letter claimed to be the unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, who had murdered and mutilated at least four women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London in the two months prior to Lusk receiving this letter, and whose vigilance committee Lusk led in civilian efforts to assist the police in identifying and apprehending the perpetrator.

The letter was postmarked 15 October 1888 and was received by Lusk the following day. An examination of the kidney revealed the individual from whom the organ originated had suffered from Bright&#x27;s disease. The author of this letter claimed to have fried and eaten the other half.

Police, press, and public alike received many letters claiming to be from the Whitechapel Murderer, with investigators at one stage having to deal with an estimated 1,000 letters related to the case. However, the &quot;From Hell&quot; letter is one of the few articles of correspondence that has received serious consideration as to actually being genuine. Nonetheless, opinions remain divided with regards to the letter&#x27;s authenticity.

The murders committed by Jack the Ripper have attracted much attention in popular culture for decades, with several factual and fictional works directly making reference to the &quot;From Hell&quot; letter.

==Background==
The murder of Mary Ann Nichols on 31 August 1888 resulted in increased media attention focusing on the suspect known as &quot;the Whitechapel murderer&quot; and, later, &quot;Leather Apron&quot;. The grotesque mutilation upon Nichols and later victims was generally described as involving their bodies having been &quot;ripped up&quot; and residents spoke of their worries of a &quot;ripper&quot; or &quot;high rip&quot; gang. The identification of the killer as Jack the Ripper occurred after 27 September, when the offices of Central News Ltd received the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter. The author of this letter signed the letter &quot;Yours truly, Jack the Ripper&quot;, vowing to continue &quot;ripping [prostitutes]&quot; until his arrest. The author of this letter also threatened to remove and post the ears of his next victim to the police.

While newsmen considered this letter a mere joke, they decided after two days to notify Scotland Yard of the matter. The double murder of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes took place the night that the police received the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter. The Central News people received a second communication known as the &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard on 1 October 1888, the day after the double murder, and the message was duly passed over to the authorities. Copies of both messages were soon posted to the public in the hopes that the writing style would be recognised. While the police felt determined to discover the author of both messages, they found themselves overwhelmed by the media circus around the Ripper killings and soon received a large amount of material, most of it useless.

==The letter==
The letter reads:


The letter came into the possession of the City of London Police, being later transferred to the Metropolitan Police. The original letter and the kidney which accompanied it have since been lost or stolen, along with other contents that were contained in the Metropolitan Police Ripper files, but a photograph was taken of the &quot;From Hell&quot; letter. The original of this photograph has now also disappeared. The image shown here is from the photograph.

===Analysis===
Hundreds of letters claiming to be from the killer were posted at the time of the Ripper murders, but many researchers argue that the &quot;From Hell&quot; letter is one of a handful of possibly authentic writings received from the murderer. The author did not sign this correspondence with the &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; pseudonym, distinguishing it from the earlier &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter and &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard, as well as their many imitators. Furthermore, the handwriting in the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter and &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard are markedly similar, but the handwriting of the &quot;From Hell&quot; letter is dissimilar. The letter was delivered to Lusk personally without reference to the police or to the British government, which could indicate animosity towards Lusk or the local Whitechapel community of which he was a member.
Opinions regarding the authenticity of the letter are divided. The possibility has been raised that all of the communications supposedly from the Whitechapel murderer are fraudulent, acts done by or by journalists seeking to maintain the public interest in the murders and thus increase sales of their newspapers. Scotland Yard had reason to doubt the validity of the letter, yet ultimately did not take action against suspected reporters. However, the many differences between the &quot;From Hell&quot; letter and the vast majority of the messages received have been cited by some figures analysing the case, such as a forensic handwriting expert interviewed by the History Channel and another interviewed by the Discovery Channel, as evidence to view it as possibly the only authentic letter.

The primary reason this letter stands out more than any other is that it was delivered with a small box containing half of what doctors later determined was a human kidney which had been preserved in spirits. One of murder victim Catherine Eddowes&#x27;s kidneys had been removed by the killer. Medical opinion at the time was that the organ could have been acquired by medical students and sent with the letter as part of a hoax. Lusk himself believed that this was the case and did not report the letter until he was urged to do so by friends.

Arguments in favour of the letter&#x27;s genuineness sometimes state that contemporary analysis of the kidney by Dr Thomas Openshaw of the London Hospital found that it came from a sickly alcoholic woman who had died within the past three weeks, which would be consistent with Eddowes. However, these facts have been in dispute, as contemporary media reporting at the time and later recollections give contradictory information about Openshaw&#x27;s opinions. Historian Philip Sugden has written that perhaps all that can be concluded, given the uncertainty, is that the kidney was human and from the left side of the body.

A contemporary police lead found that shopkeeper Emily Marsh had encountered a visitor at her shop, located in Mile End Road, with an odd, unsettling manner in both his appearance and speech. The visitor asked Marsh for the address of Mr Lusk, which he wrote in a personal notebook, before abruptly leaving. He was described as a slim man wearing a long black overcoat at about six feet in height who spoke with a distinct Irish accent, his face featuring a dark beard and moustache. While the event took place the day before Lusk received the &quot;From Hell&quot; message and occurred in the area in which it is considered to have been postmarked, the fact that Lusk received so many letters during this time suggests that the suspicious individual may have been another crank.

==Calligraphy and linguistic analysis==
The &quot;From Hell&quot; letter is written with a much lower level of literacy than other letters purporting to be from the murderer, in that this letter features numerous errors in spelling and grammar. Scholars have debated whether this is a deliberate misdirection, as the author observed the silent &quot;k&quot; in &quot;knif[e]&quot; and &quot;h&quot; in &quot;whil[e]&quot;. The formatting of the letter also features a cramped writing style in which letters are pressed together haphazardly; many ink blots appear in a manner which might indicate that the writer was unfamiliar with using a pen. The formatting of the message might point to it being a hoax by a well-educated individual, but some researchers have argued that it is the genuine work of a partly functional but deranged individual.

Forensic handwriting expert Michelle Dresbold, working for the History Channel documentary series &quot;MysteryQuest&quot;, has argued that the letter is genuine, based on the peculiar characteristics of the handwriting, particularly the &quot;invasive loop&quot; letter &quot;y&quot;s. The criminal profiling experts in the programme also created a profile of the killer, stating that he possessed a deranged animosity towards women and skills in using a knife. Based on linguistic clues (including the use of the particular spelling of the word &quot;prasarved&quot; for &quot;preserved&quot;), Dresbold felt that the letter showed strong evidence that the writer was either Irish or of Irish extraction, indicating a possible link between the letter and known Ripper suspect Francis Tumblety. Tumblety was an itinerant Irish-American quack doctor who was mentally ill and who had resided in London during the year of the murders. He had had encounters with the law and a strong dislike of women, as well as a background of collecting body parts. However, after arresting him at the time as a suspect, the police ended up releasing him on bail, having failed to find hard evidence against him. He ultimately died of a heart condition in the U.S. in 1903. Sugden has also written that the author may have had an Irish background, but also stated that he may have had Cockney mannerisms.

The purported diary of James Maybrick, another man who has been proposed as a Ripper suspect, contains references to the &quot;From Hell&quot; letter, particularly the alleged cannibalism. However, even if the diary is assumed to be genuine, the handwriting does not match that of the letter at all. A &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; article has referred to the diary rumour as a &quot;hoax&quot; that is one of several &quot;bizarre hypotheses&quot; relating to the case.

==In popular culture==

The Jack the Ripper murders are regarded as the first internationally publicised set of serial killings, with the perpetrator never conclusively identified. They have attracted much attention for decades, with fictional works referring specifically to the Lusk letter. The graphic novel &quot;From Hell&quot;, created by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, concerns the Ripper murders and takes its name from the letter. The work was originally published in serial form from 1989 to 1996, first collected as a single piece in 1999, and adapted into a 2001 feature film starring Johnny Depp, Ian Holm and Heather Graham. The series features the actual killer as a main protagonist, going into his tortured mind and warped justifications for the murders. Cultural commentators such as Professor Elizabeth Ho have highlighted the way in which the work comments &quot;on the present&#x27;s relationship to the past&quot;, with text and image placed &quot;in critical tension&quot;.

<text>Craig Bromell (born 1959 in Oshawa) is a Canadian radio personality and former police officer. Prior to his broadcast career, Bromell served as president of the Toronto Police Association from 1997 to 2003. In that position, he was often at odds with the two chiefs of police during his tenure, Julian Fantino and David Boothby. Previous to becoming TPA president, Bromell led a wildcat strike of officers in 51 Division.

In 1996, Thomas Kerr, a homeless man, claimed that he was beaten up by nine police officers, including Bromell, in retaliation for breaking another police officer&#x27;s arm in a previous encounter. A settlement was made before Bromell, now head of the Toronto Police Union, was scheduled to testify and would be subject to questioning about the event in question. The internal investigator&#x27;s testimony stated that police claimed that they had never picked up Kerr. However, a fingerprint of Kerr&#x27;s was lifted from the cruiser that one of the officers had been using. The investigator also noticed later changes to police notebooks to make it look as though Kerr had an eye injury and was bleeding from his mouth before the alleged beating.

In 2000, the police association, under Bromell&#x27;s leadership, launched a telemarketing campaign called Operation True Blue, in which donors were given windshield stickers for their cars. Critics charged that Bromell and the union were amassing a war chest in order to target political opponents, and raised the concern that police officers could offer special privilege (such as disregarding minor traffic infractions, etc.) to people whose cars bore the stickers. Fantino soon forced the campaign to cease. That same year, Bromell released a list of 17 councillors he recommended that the union endorse during the municipal elections. All of the 17 were conservatives who advocated curtailing the right of the municipal police services board to review internal affairs, especially in the city&#x27;s racial profiling controversy.

Bromell stepped down as head of the police association in 2003 and was succeeded by Rick McIntosh.

In 2004, Bromell became a late morning radio host for talk radio station AM640 Toronto Radio, co-hosting &quot;The Beat&quot; briefly with 640&#x27;s former news director Ross MacLeod, before permanent co-host Tina Trigiani was selected. The show was rebranded &quot;Bromell!&quot; in 2006, with co-host John Downs as Trigiani went on a temporary professional leave. Bromell left AM640 in August 2007.

The television series &quot;The Bridge&quot; is loosely based upon Bromell&#x27;s tenure as head of the police union. Bromell is the executive producer. The lead character, Frank Leo, is modeled upon Bromell and played by Aaron Douglas.

In 2012, Bromell became the first head of the new Building Union of Canada. The union planned to unionize non-unionized workers in the construction field. It got into a dispute with the existing Laborers&#x27; International Union of North America over raids by BUC on LIUNA workplaces.

<text>The Harvey Girls is a 1946 Technicolor American musical film produced by Arthur Freed for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It is based on the 1942 novel of the same name by Samuel Hopkins Adams, about Fred Harvey&#x27;s Harvey House waitresses. Directed by George Sidney, the film stars Judy Garland and features John Hodiak, Ray Bolger, and Angela Lansbury, as well as Preston Foster, Virginia O&#x27;Brien, Kenny Baker, Marjorie Main and Chill Wills. Future star Cyd Charisse appears in her first speaking role on film.

&quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe&quot;, written by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer.

==Plot==
In the 1890s, a group of &quot;Harvey Girls&quot; – new waitresses for Fred Harvey&#x27;s pioneering chain of Harvey House restaurants – travels on the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway to the American Southwest town of Sandrock. On the trip they meet Susan Bradley, who is travelling to the same town to marry the man whose beautiful letters she received when she answered a &quot;lonely-hearts&quot; ad.

Unfortunately, when she arrives, her husband-to-be turns out to be an &quot;old coot&quot; who does not at all meet her expectations, and vice versa. They start to argue and list their own personal faults, which they claim not to have mentioned in their letters. With their mutual disinclination to continue with the marital union clear, they jointly decide to call off the wedding.

With the marriage safely cancelled, he reveals to Susan that his letters were actually ghost-written as a joke by Ned Trent, the local saloon owner. Susan, rightly furious, confronts Ned to tell him off, in the process endearing herself to him.

Susan joins the Harvey Girls and she soon becomes their leader in fighting against the attempts by Trent&#x27;s business associate, Judge Sam Purvis, to scare them away to maintain his own thriving business running the large saloon in town. The Harvey Girls also face the animosity of the so-called &quot;dance-hall girls,&quot; led by Em, who is in love with Trent and sees Susan as a rival.

Trent visits the Harvey House, sees its value along with the other trappings of civilization, and then tells Purvis to leave them alone. Purvis continues with his campaign of intimidation, finally burning down the restaurant. Trent offers his saloon as a replacement and Em and the dance-hall girls leave town. Susan, thinking that Trent too is leaving, gets on the train, but Em, seeing that Susan loves Trent so much that she is willing to give up everything for him, stops the train and points out Trent, riding toward them on his horse. Ultimately, they wed in the desert, surrounded by the Harvey Girls.

==Cast==

Cast notes:
* Byron Harvey Jr., the grandson of Fred Harvey of the Fred Harvey Company, has an uncredited role as a train conductor.
*&quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; was the first reunion on film with Ray Bolger and Judy Garland since &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939).

==Production==
&quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; was conceived by MGM as a dramatic western vehicle for Lana Turner, but Roger Edens, of the Arthur Freed unit, decided after seeing the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; that the story should be reworked as MGM&#x27;s western musical with Judy Garland as its star. Garland wanted to work with Fred Astaire on &quot;Yolanda and the Thief&quot;, which was directed by fiancé Vincente Minnelli. Edens convinced her that the part in &quot;Yolanda&quot; was not large enough for her, and he promised that &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; would be specifically created to showcase her talents.

Principal photography on &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; lasted from January 12 through June 4, 1945, a long production period. Studio filming was at MGM&#x27;s Culver City studios, and the locations were in Victorville, California; at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth (near Los Angeles); and in Monument Valley.

Singer Virginia Rees&#x27; voice was dubbed for Angela Lansbury&#x27;s songs. Cyd Charisse, who had her first speaking role in the film, had her singing dubbed by Marion Doenges.

Virginia O&#x27;Brien, a comic actress known for her deadpan style of singing, was pregnant while &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; was filmed. Several scenes with Ray Bolger were never filmed due to the difficulty in hiding her pregnancy. This accounts for O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s character disappearing after she sings &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;.

&quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; was released in the United States on January 18, 1946.

By far the biggest hit from the score of &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; was &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe&quot;. MGM released the song to record companies even before shooting was finished on the film, and it became an instant hit dominating the airwaves through the summer and fall of 1945, with versions by Bing Crosby with Six Hits and a Miss, Judy Garland and The Merry Macs, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra with the Sentimentalists, and, the most popular, Johnny Mercer and The Pied Pipers. Mercer&#x27;s version entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts on July 5, 1945, and stayed on it for 16 weeks, including seven straight weeks as No. 1 between July 28 and September 8. Crosby&#x27;s entered the charts on July 19 and stayed ten weeks, going as high as No. 4, while Dorsey&#x27;s entered on August 2 and stayed for six weeks, peaking at No. 6. Garland&#x27;s hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; No. 10 position on September 20. The song was also number 1 on &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; for eight weeks running.

In shooting the number for the film, Garland reportedly did the entire song up to the tempo change in one take, twice, after watching her stand-in do one run-through.

===Deleted songs===
Cut from the film were three other songs written for it by Warren and Mercer: &quot;March of the Doagies&quot;, &quot;Hayride&quot; and &quot;My Intuition&quot;. &quot;Doagies&quot; was a production number featuring Garland; the outtake was included in &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; (1994). &quot;My Intuition&quot; was a duet for Garland and John Hodiak; this was also filmed and still survives in video format. &quot;Hayride&quot;, sung by Garland and Ray Bolger, was prerecorded but not filmed.

==Critical response==
Howard Barnes wrote in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; that the film was &quot;A great big animated picture postcard. Judy Garland is the film&#x27;s bright ... star. Miss Garland is effectively glamorized in get-ups of the (18)90&#x27;s and sings her songs pleasantly. &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; is a perfect demonstration of what Hollywood can do with its vast resources when it wants to be really showy ... pretty girls – period sets and costumes – lilting tunes – super-speedy dance shuffles.&quot;

The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; said it was &quot;A nostalgic whiff of the old west. Judy sings several sentimental ballads, as well as &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe&quot; number. Her chief support in the way of real entertainment comes from Ray Bolger.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; wrote &quot;A technicolored musical celebrating the coming of chastity, clean silverware, and crumbless tablecloths to the pioneer Southwest. The bearers of this culture, according to evidence presented here, were waitresses. &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; is good fun in spots. Miss Garland doesn&#x27;t seem as recklessly happy as she was in &quot;St. Louis&quot; but she still appears to be having a pretty fine time.&quot;

==Box office==
According to MGM records the film earned $4,112,000 in the US and Canada and $1,063,000.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe&quot; won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer. In addition, Lennie Hayton&#x27;s score was nominated for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture, but did not win; the Oscar went to Morris Stoloff for &quot;The Jolson Story&quot;.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe&quot; – Nominated
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated

<text>Frattamaggiore (locally also known as Fratta) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Naples, Campania, Italy. It is located north of Naples and southwest of Caserta. It was awarded the title of &quot;City of art&quot; in 2008 and named Benedictine city in 1997.
It is located in the Naples hinterland. It is bordered by the of Afragola, Cardito, Crispano, Frattaminore, Grumo Nevano, and Sant&#x27;Arpino.

==History==
The first records of Frattamaggiore date to 921 AD, although the area was probably settled in pre-Roman times. The people of Atella built a watchtower in response to the Vandal invasion of 455 AD, around which refugees from Miseno settled when their town was razed by the Saracens; here they also built a Catholic church in honour of Sossius, now the patron saint of Frattamaggiore.

==Transportation==
Frattamaggiore is served by:
* Provincial road 162, a freeway that connects the city to the Milano-Napoli freeway;
* a railway station on the Rome–Formia–Naples railway;
* Napoli Afragola railway station on the Rome–Naples high-speed line, from Frattamaggiore;
* several bus lines of the Naples Public Transport Company that connect the city to Naples, Caserta, Afragola, Casoria, Sant&#x27;Antimo, Orta di Atella, Frattaminore and other closer cities;
* the Naples International Airport, A104 bis, from Frattamaggiore.

==Notable people==

*Massimo Stanzione (1585 – 1656), painter
*Francesco Durante (1684 – 1755), composer 
*Francesco Lodi (born 1984), football player
*Lorenzo Insigne (born 1991), football player

==Twin towns==
* Striano, Italy, since 2006

<text>Cannabivarin (CBV), also known as cannabivarol, is considered a non-psychoactive cannabinoid — it does not produce the euphoric side effects found in THC. Minor amounts of CBV are found in the hemp plant &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot;. It is an analog of cannabinol (CBN) with the side chain shortened by two methylene bridges (-CH2-). CBV is an oxidation product of tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV, THV).

== Chemistry ==
It has no double bond isomers nor stereoisomers.

==Legal status==
It is not scheduled by Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

===United States===
CBV is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it could be considered an analog (of THC), in which case, sales or possession intended for human consumption could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act.

<doc id="1232236" wikidata="Q421738" url="?curid=1232236" title="Fluoromethane">
<text>Fluoromethane, also known as methyl fluoride, [[Freon]] 41, Halocarbon-41 and HFC-41, is a non-toxic, liquefiable, and flammable gas at standard temperature and pressure. It is made of carbon, hydrogen, and fluorine. The name stems from the fact that it is methane (CH4) with a fluorine atom substituted for one of the hydrogen atoms. It is used in semiconductor manufacturing processes as an etching gas in plasma etch reactors.

Fluoromethane (originally called &quot;fluorohydrate of methylene&quot;) became the first organofluorine compound to be discovered when it was synthesized by French chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugène-Melchior Péligot in 1835 by distilling dimethyl sulfate with potassium fluoride.

== Composition ==
The compound is the lowest mass member of the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) family, compounds which contain only hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon. These compounds are related to the chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), but since they do not contain chlorine, are not destructive to the ozone layer. Fluorocarbons are, however, potent greenhouse gasses, and the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol is an attempt to phase them out due to their contribution to global warming.

The C−F bond energy is 552 kJ/mol and its length is 0.139 nm. Its molecular geometry is tetrahedral. Its Dipole Moment is 1.85 D.

Its specific heat capacity (Cp) is 38.171 J·mol−1·K−1 at 25 °C. The critical point of fluoromethane is at 44.9 °C (318.1 K) and 6.280 MPa.

<doc id="1232252" wikidata="Q1142351" url="?curid=1232252" title="Crystal Cove State Park">
<text>Crystal Cove State Park is a state park of California, United States, encompassing of Pacific coastline, inland chaparral canyons, and the Crystal Cove Historic District of beach houses. The park is located partially in Newport Beach and partially in an unincorporated area of Orange County, and is part of the larger South Coast Wilderness area. Crystal Cove is a stretch of coastal cliffs and a beachfront cove situated between the Pacific Coast Highway and the Pacific Ocean, southeast of Newport Beach and northwest of Laguna Beach. The park was established in 1979. The entire park hosts a total of of beaches and tide pools, a as well as underwater park, of bluffs, and of canyons.

==History==
Up until the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries, the region was a series of native villages built around two different natural springs. The natives were then drafted to Mission San Gabriel and Mission San Juan Capistrano, which was later known as &quot;Rancho San Joaquin&quot;, until it went into debt and was sold in 1864 to James Irvine, a financier from San Francisco, along with three other ranchers, however in 1876, when their sheep stock began to fail from drought, poor wool, and the increasingly competitive marketplace, James Irvine bought out his partners prior to his death. His son, James Irvine II, then inherited the ranch and began to expand the production of the land by leasing it to agriculturally diverse farmers, and formed &quot;The Irvine Company&quot; in 1894. Being a favorite spot to James Irvine II, he allowed his friends and family as well as employees to build cottages on the area that we now refer to as Crystal Cove. As cottages began to undergo renovations and become more permanent residences, the owners were offered a choice by the Irvine Company to either move the cottages elsewhere or to hand over ownership and allow them to be leased by the company. These cottages were developed by the Irvine Company and the location was called the Crystal Cove Community. In 1927, the Irvine Company leased a portion of the area to a businessman who sold propane to coastal farmers and became a camping site named &quot;Tyrone&#x27;s Camp&quot;. Trailers replaced tent camping in the 1940s and in 1954, it was renamed El Morro. About 290 mobile home trailers on the beachfront and inland area were primary homes for some families up to four generations. In 2006, after 26 years of litigation, the California Coastal Commission, who purchased the property in 1979, evicted the tenants and demolished the El Morro Village mobile home park converting the private community into a day-use and overnight campground. The area was renovated to also include a visitors center for tourist information, dining areas along the beachfront, cultural center, museums and the Park and Marine Research Facility. The Crystal Cove Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places site, inside the park contains 46 beach cottages from the 1920s and 1930s, of which 29 have been restored. 21 of these cottages are available for rent. The house from the Bette Midler movie &quot;Beaches&quot; is located in Crystal Cove.

Crystal Cove has long been a source of inspiration for plein air painters, a type of landscape painting that originated in France. Early plein air painters documented Orange County&#x27;s coastline, and Crystal Cove, in particular, with their paintings. In homage to the movement, one of the cottages at Crystal Cove is called &quot;Painter&#x27;s Cottage.&quot;

==Recreation==
Crystal Cove is used by mountain bikers inland and scuba and skin divers underwater. The beach is popular with swimmers and surfers. Lifeguard services at Crystal Cove are provided by the California State Parks Lifeguard Service. Lifeguards patrol the beach year-round while lifeguard towers are staffed roughly Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend. The offshore waters are designated as a Marine Conservation area as well as a underwater park. Visitors can explore tidepools and sandy coves.

In addition to the beach, the park has of undeveloped woodland inland of the coast highway, which is popular for hiking and horseback riding. The park has a total of 17 different trails.

The grounds are also available for camping. There are 34 different lots spread across the 3 designated backpacking camping areas, including the Upper Morro, Lower Moro &amp; Deer Canyon campsites. None are accessible by car, only by hike, and are for up to 4 people per site. No pets are allowed. No fires are allowed in the backcountry campsites.

==Wildlife of Crystal Cove State Park==
Crystal Cove State Park has a registered 180 different species of birds that can be observed throughout the entire year, seasonally, or a few times per year. Some of the birds seen regularly include the Turkey vulture, Mourning dove, Ring-billed gull, the Common raven, the Greater roadrunner, Quail and the House sparrow. Along with registered birds, there are roughly 26 registered reptiles of Crystal Cove State Park, and 10 of which are commonly seen by visitors. These include the California legless lizard, Arboreal salamander, Pacific tree frog, Red diamond rattlesnake, Pacific gopher snake, Southern Pacific rattlesnake, California kingsnake, Side-blotched lizard, Western fence lizard, and the Coast horned lizard.

<doc id="1232254" wikidata="Q288256" url="?curid=1232254" title="ACE (compressed file format)">
<text>In computing, ACE is a proprietary data compression archive file format developed by Marcel Lemke, and later bought by e-merge GmbH. The peak of its popularity was 1999–2001, when it provided slightly better compression rates than RAR, which has since become more popular.

==WinAce==

WinAce, maintained by e-merge GmbH, is used to compress and decompress ACE files under Microsoft Windows. When installed, it lets the user choose between paying for a registration or installing WhenU SaveNow adware. e-merge GmbH also produces a Commandline ACE for DOS; and a freeware command-line interface decompression tool for Linux (i386) and macOS called &quot;Unace&quot;. e-merge GmbH also provides several libraries for developers, including a freeware decompression DLL called &quot;unace.dll&quot;. Some third-party archivers can read the format using this DLL. None of the above is open source free software.

On November 23, 2007, version 2.69 of WinACE was released, including a less-intrusive adware application, MeMedia AdVantage, which replaces WhenU. No other major changes are in this release.

==Other implementations==
An older version of an Unace 1.2b is free software and licensed under the GPL by the author Marcel Lemke, but it cannot extract ACE archives from version 2.0 and newer.

A newer version of Unace 2.5 that supports ACE 2.0 archives is available under a restrictive source available license, also by Marcel Lemke.

An older, independent C implementation is part of XAD-Master libxad by Dirk Stöcker. It is limited to unpacking ACE 1.0 archives.

Since 2017, there is a BSD licensed python module and CLI utility by Daniel Roethlisberger, that supports unpacking of ACE 2.0 format archives.

==Third-party support==
&quot;Packing&quot; of ACE files is licensed as proprietary information and only available through WinACE, while &quot;unpacking&quot; of ACE files is supported by a number of third-party archivers. However, virtually all of them (the ones that support ACE 2.x format) do this by using the proprietary &quot;unace.dll&quot; from e-merge GmbH.

==Use for malware distribution==
Since at least 2015, ACE archives have been used to deliver malware to victims by e-mail. This tactic was viable because popular archiving software was able to uncompress ACE archives, but support for the ACE format in security products such as mail filters, web content filters, and anti-virus software was generally weak.

==Security vulnerabilities==
In February 2019 several major security vulnerabilities were found in the unacev2.dll library which is used by WinRAR and other archiving products. Since WinACE support is discontinued, users are advised against opening ACE archives in WinRAR and possibly other products using this library. WinRAR stopped supporting ACE as of version 5.70, and similar products are following suit.

<doc id="1232264" wikidata="Q292504" url="?curid=1232264" title="XORP">
<text>XORP is an open-source Internet Protocol routing software suite originally designed at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California. The name is derived from &quot;eXtensible Open Router Platform&quot;. It supports OSPF, BGP, RIP, PIM, IGMP, OLSR.

The product is designed from principles of software modularity and extensibility and aims at exhibiting stability and providing feature requirements for production use while also supporting networking research. The development project was founded by Mark Handley in 2000. Receiving funding from Intel, Microsoft, and the National Science Foundation, it released its first production software in July 2004. The project was then run by Atanu Ghosh of the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley, California.

In July 2008, the International Computer Science Institute transferred the XORP technology to a new entity, XORP Inc., a commercial startup founded by the leaders of the opensource project team and backed by Onset Ventures and Highland Capital Partners. In February 2010, XORP Inc. was wound up, a victim of the recession. However the open source project continued, with the servers based at University College London. In March 2011, Ben Greear became the project maintainer and the www.xorp.org server is now hosted by Candela Technologies.

The XORP codebase consists of around 670,000 lines of C++ and is developed primarily on Linux, but supported on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, NetBSD. Support for XORP on Microsoft Windows was recently re-added to the development tree. XORP is available for download as a Live CD or as source code via the project&#x27;s homepage.

The software suite was selected commercially as the routing platform for the Vyatta line of products in its early releases, but later has been replaced with quagga.

==Routing features==

As of 2009, the project supports the following routing protocols:
*Static routing
*Routing Information Protocol (RIP and RIPng):
** (RIP version 2)
** (RIP-2 MD5 Authentication)
** (RIPng for IPv6)
*Border Gateway Protocol:
** (A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4))
** (Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4)
** (Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4)
** (Use of BGP-4 Multiprotocol Extensions for IPv6 Inter-Domain Routing)
** (BGP Communities Attribute)
** (BGP Route Reflection - An Alternative to Full Mesh IBGP)
** (Autonomous System Confederations for BGP)
** (BGP Route Flap Damping)
** (BGP Support for Four-octet AS Number Space)
** (Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fourth Version of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4) using SMIv2)
*Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) and version 3 (OSPFv3):
** (OSPF Version 2)
** (The OSPF Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA) Option)
** (OSPF for IPv6)
*PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM):
**
* IGMP v1, v2, and v3:
** (Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2)
** (Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3)
*Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD v1 and v2):
** (Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6)
** (Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6)
*Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP v2):

==User interface==
XORP provides a command line interface for interactive configuration and operation monitoring. The interface is implemented as a distinct application called &quot;xorpsh&quot;, that may be invoked by multiple users simultaneously. It interacts via interprocess communication with the router core modules. The command line language is modelled after that of Juniper Networks&#x27;s JunOS platform.

<text>Sir Osborne Arkell Smith, KCSI, KCIE (26 December 1876 – 30 August 1952) was the first Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, a post he held from 1 April 1935 to 30 June 1937.

Smith was a professional banker who served for 20 years with the Bank of New South Wales and 10 years with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He then came to India in 1926 as Managing Governor of the Imperial Bank of India. He was knighted in March 1929, and was invested with his knighthood by the Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin, at the new Viceroy&#x27;s House in New Delhi on 27 February 1930. Smith was further appointed a KCIE in the 1932 New Year Honours list and appointed a KCSI in February 1937.

His stewardship of the Imperial Bank won him recognition in banking circles in India. Since his outlook on policy issues like the exchange rates and interest rates differed with that of the Government, he resigned before the completion of his term of office.

Sir Osborne did not sign any Indian rupee notes during his tenure.

<text>Major-General Sir George Arthur French (19 June 1841 – 7 July 1921) was an Irish soldier who served as an officer in the British Army, as the first Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, from October 1873 to July 1876, and as Commandant of the colonial military forces in Queensland (1883–91) and New South Wales (1896–1902)

George Arthur French was born at Roscommon, Ireland. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and commissioned in the Royal Artillery in 1860.

In 1871, at the request of the Canadian government, he was sent to Canada as a military inspector, eventually becoming head of the School of Gunnery at Kingston, Ontario.

French was appointed to organise the North-West Mounted Police on its creation in 1873, and the next year he led the force on its famous March West to suppress the illegal whiskey trade in the wake of the Cypress Hills Massacre.

French resigned in 1876 and returned to duty in the British Army, eventually attaining the rank of major general. The organizational skills developed in Canada were used to establish local defence forces in India and Australia. In September 1883 he was appointed Commandant of the Queensland Local Forces with the local rank of colonel, and arrived in the colony on 4 January 1884. Colonel French married, in 1862, Janet Clarke, daughter of the late Robert Long Innes, formerly of the 37th Regiment. Colonel French retired in 1891, and returned to England, but was back in Australia as commandant in North South Wales from 1896 until 1902.

He retired from the army on 3 September 1902, was knighted as Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the November 1902 Birthday Honours list, and was invested with the insignia by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 18 December 1902.

For the next 19 years much of his time was spent guarding the crown jewels in London, where he died in 1921.

<text>The Ekati Diamond Mine, often simply called Ekati, is Canada&#x27;s first surface and underground diamond mine and is owned by Burgundy Diamond Mines. It is located north-east of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, and about south of the Arctic Circle, near Lac de Gras. Until 2014, Ekati was a joint venture between Dominion Diamond Mines (80%), Chuck Fipke, and Stewart Blusson, the two geologists who discovered kimberlite pipes north of Lac de Gras. Fipke and Blusson each held 10% stake in the mine, until Fipke sold his share to Dominion. In 2021, Arctic Canadian Diamond Company Ltd. acquired the Ekati Diamond Mine with associated assets and liabilities from Dominion Diamond Mines. In July 2023, Burgundy Diamond Mines purchased full control of Arctic Canadian Diamond Company.

==History==
The first volcanic pipe found in the Lac de Gras region was the Point Lake kimberlite, discovered by Chuck Fipke and Stewart Blusson who had been prospecting in the region for almost ten years, having found kimberlite indicator minerals as early as 1985. The Point Lake kimberlite was determined to be uneconomic, but its discovery precipitated one of largest staking rushes in mining history, covering most of the area between Yellowknife and the Arctic coast. There are 156 known kimberlite pipes within the Ekati block of claims, including the Point Lake pipe. Ekati officially began operations on October 14, 1998, and was operated by BHP. Since the opening until 2017, the mine produced around of diamonds and is still in production.

As of July 2023, the mine has been owned by Burgundy Diamond Mines. There are currently three underground kimberlites (Koala, Koala North, and Panda) and the rest are mined by surface mining. As of 2024, the active operations include Sable and Misery underground with Point Lake ready to go into production as an open pits later in the year.

==Geology==
Diamonds at the Ekati site are found in 45- to 62-million-year-old kimberlite pipes (Creaser et al., 2004) of the Lac de Gras kimberlite field, most of which lie underneath shallow lakes.

==Mining and marketing==
Between 1998 and 2009, the mine has produced of diamonds out of six open pits. As the high grade ore close to surface was depleted, development was completed to access the ore utilizing underground methods. The mine&#x27;s current annual production is estimated to be approximately of diamonds.

There are numerous options to extend the mine life at Ekati through 2028 including continuation of Misery underground at depth, evaluation alternatives for expansion at Point Lake, transforming Sable to an underground operation following open pit completion, exploring Fox as an underground opportunity and maximizing resources in the Fox stockpile. In addition, the underwater remote mining provides additional opportunities to extract diamonds through kimberlite pipes with a trial that will start at Lynx pit in 2025.

==Transportation==
Mine workers fly-in fly-out through Ekati Airport.

<text>Socket 940 is a 940-pin socket for 64-bit AMD Opteron server processors and AMD Athlon 64 FX consumer processors. It was one of the first sockets designed for AMD&#x27;s AMD64 range of processors.

This socket is entirely square in shape and pins are arranged in a grid with the exception of four key pins used to align the processor and the corners. AMD&#x27;s Opteron and the older AMD Athlon 64 FX (FX-51) use Socket 940.

==Technical specifications==
Microprocessors designed for this socket were intended to be used in a server platform, and as such provide additional features to provide additional robustness. One such feature is the acceptance of only registered memory. 

While the more recent 940-pin socket AM2 is visually similar to this one, the two are electrically incompatible due to the integrated memory controller. Socket 940 CPUs integrate a DDR controller, whereas AM2 models use a DDR2 controller.

<doc id="1232300" wikidata="Q6138722" url="?curid=1232300" title="James Macleod">
<text>Lieutenant-Colonel James Farquharson Macleod (c. September 25, 1836 – September 5, 1894), born in Drynoch, Isle of Skye, Scotland, was a militia officer, lawyer, North-West Mounted Police officer, magistrate, judge, and politician in Alberta. He served as the second full Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, from July 22, 1876, to October 31, 1880. Fort Macleod and Macleod Trail, a major Calgary, Alberta thoroughfare, are named after him.

In 1887, Macleod was appointed to the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories, which then included what is now known as Alberta and Saskatchewan. He held this position until his death in 1894. He is buried in Union Cemetery in Calgary.

== Education ==

Macleod immigrated with his family from Scotland in 1845, when his father purchased a farm at Richmond Hill, Ontario. Macleod attended Upper Canada College in Toronto, Ontario and then Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario. He graduated in 1854 from Queen&#x27;s with a B.A. in classics and philosophy and then enrolled in 1856 at Osgoode Hall to attend law school. He graduated with an LL.B. in 1860 and articled with the law office of Alexander Campbell. It was also sometime around this time that he joined the Orange Order, L.O.L. 141, as was common of Canadian Ulster-Scots at the time.

Before law school during the summer of 1856, against the wishes of his parents, Macleod joined the Volunteer Militia Field Battery of Kingston as a lieutenant and his enthusiasm was such that his brother-in-law William Augustus Baldwin persuaded Governor General Sir Edmund Walker Head to offer Macleod a commission in the British army. His father insisted that the offer be refused.

== Military service ==

From 1860 to 1870 Macleod practiced law in Bowmanville, Ontario, but during that time he retained an interest in the militia. He transferred in 1862 to the Bowmanville Volunteer Militia Rifle Company and was promoted to captain in 1863 and major in 1866 when the Bowmanville company became part of the newly formed 45th West Durham Battalion of Infantry. Active service during the Trent Affair in 1861 and the Fenian Raids of 1866 confirmed his interest in the military.

In 1870, he obtained a commission as brigade major with the Wolseley expedition which was sent to quell the Red River Rebellion. After returning from the Red River in 1871, Macleod was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and became the commanding officer of the 45th West Durham Battalion.

==North-West Mounted Police==

Macleod served as Commissioner of the NWMP from 1876 to 1880.

==Northwest Territories Legislature==

Macleod was appointed the Legislative Assembly of Northwest Territories on October 7, 1876, to serve as one of the first three members on the permanent Northwest Territories Council.

He served as a regular appointed member until 1881, when he was appointed as a Stipendiary Magistrate. He served as such until the 1st Northwest Territories general election.

He was reappointed to the Assembly as one of three Legal Advisors, a non-voting at-large position created to help the assembly make the transition. The position was abolished when the legislature was dissolved in 1891, ending 15 years of service with the legislature.

== Personal life ==
On July 28, 1876, Macleod married pioneer Mary Isabella Drever, who he first met in Spring 1871. They settled in Fort Macleod and had four daughters and one son.

<doc id="1232306" wikidata="Q6973044" url="?curid=1232306" title="National Heritage Area">
<text>In the United States, a National Heritage Area (NHA) is a site designated by Act of Congress, intended to encourage historic preservation of the area and an appreciation of the history and heritage of the site. There are currently 62 NHAs, some of which use variations of the title, such as National Heritage Corridor.

National Heritage Areas are neither National Park Service units or federally owned or managed land. NHAs are usually administered by state governments, non-profit organizations or other private corporations, referred to as &quot;local coordinating entities&quot;. The National Park Service provides an advisory role and limited technical, planning and financial assistance, in a form of Public–private partnership.

Each area has its own authorizing legislation and a set of unique resources and goals. Areas considered for designation must have specific elements. First, the landscape must be a nationally unique natural, cultural, historic, or scenic resource. Second, when the related sites are linked, they must tell a unique story about the U.S. NHAs may often geographically overlap each other, and may also overlap portions or entireties of federally owned or managed land, National Park Service units and other protected areas. To date, more total NHAs, as well as more total acreage of land, have been designated east of the Mississippi River. 

== Legislative history ==
The first NHA created, the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor, located in Illinois, was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on August 21, 1984.

The National Heritage Areas Act of 2006 designated ten new NHAs and authorized authorized three studies of potential NHAs. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 12, 2006.

The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 designated ten new NHAs. The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 30, 2009. 

The John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of 2019 laid out procedures for planning and management of NHAs and designated six new NHAs. It was signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 12, 2019.

The National Heritage Area Act of 2022 established a National Heritage Area System and created a standardized process for the Department of the Interior to provide financial and technical assistance to NHAs. The law also provides a process for the study and designation of new NHAs and evaluation for existing NHAs. It authorized three studies of potential NHAs and established seven new NHAs. The bill was passed by the Senate on December 20, 2022 by unanimous consent and the House on December 22 (on a vote of 326-95), and was signed into law by President Joe Biden on January 5, 2023.

<text>Lawrence William Herchmer (25 April 1840 – 17 February 1915) was a Canadian and British police commander and army officer, who was also employed as a farmer, brewer and civil servant. He served as the fifth Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, from April 1, 1886 to July 31, 1900.

Born in Shipton-on-Cherwell, England, Herchmer served with the British Army and, during 1872–4, as supply officer of the British Boundary Commission, then as Indian agent in Manitoba in 1876. He was named RCMP Commissioner in 1886.

Although a former military officer, he had not served in the police, and was a civilian at the time he was named as Commissioner of the force.

Herchmer was &quot;a capable administrator&quot;, but being hot-tempered and overbearing, he gained a &quot;reputation as a tyrant&quot; during his tenure as commissioner. Nevertheless, the force under his command gained better benefits, living conditions, organization, and training, and more respect, with a marked improvement in &quot;esprit du corps&quot;. His personality earned him a number of political enemies, leading to charges of mismanagement that produced a judicial inquiry in 1892 (which cleared him) and culminated in his dismissal in 1900, while he was serving with the Canadian Army in South Africa. Herchmer considered his firing unjust, and continued to say so until his death.

Herchmer introduced the wide-brimmed hats (later adopted as official uniform), and the famous musical ride display of horsemanship.

His family had connections with John A. Macdonald, first prime minister of Canada, who appointed him.
He had the political backing to make many important changes to the administration and organization of the force.

He died in Vancouver, British Columbia at 74.

<text>King Mongkut&#x27;s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL or KMIT Ladkrabang for short) is a research and educational institution in Thailand. It is situated in Lat Krabang District, Bangkok approximately 30 km east of the city center. The university consists of nine faculties: engineering, architecture, science, industrial education and technology, agricultural technology, information technology, food industry, liberal arts, and medicine.

==History==
KMITL was founded in 1960 in Nonthaburi province as a telecommunications training center under the technical support of the Japanese government; the center was later named the Nonthaburi Institute of Telecommunications. After moving to a new location at Lat Krabang near Suvarnabhumi Airport, the campus became King Mongkut&#x27;s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.

Engineering began at KMITL in 1960 with a course on telecommunications engineering.

Since a technical cooperation agreement (August 1960-August 1965) was reached between the Japanese and Thai governments in 1960 to establish a telecommunications training center in Thailand, Japan has continued the cooperation over the course of 40 years. The telecommunications training center became a three-year specialty college in 1964, and then in 1971 joined two other colleges and rose to the ranks of an institute of technology. Part of the school moved to the Ladkrabang campus, and architecture, industrial education/science, and agricultural technology departments were established.

On the Japanese side, Tokai University (1977), Tokyo Institute of Technology (1992) and University of Electro-Communications (1997) concluded academic exchange agreements with the school and assisted with such things as the expansion of the university, human resource development and research promotion as part of second phase (December 1978-August 1983) and third phase (April 1988-March 1993) &quot;Project-type Technical Cooperation&quot; projects. A Japanese corporation funded scholarship system was established (1971), as well as practical factory-based training (1977), a construction scholarship system (1989), etc. Thus, actual cooperation activities involving linkages with industry as well as things like the start of an invitation program to the Institute for Posts and Telecommunications Policy and a human resource exchange with a public institution were promoted.

In 1982 KMITL launched the nation&#x27;s first doctoral degree in electrical engineering and awarded a doctorate in electrical engineering to Dr. Chom Kimpan, who also earned the first Doctor of Engineering granted by a Thai university.

Through the &quot;Partners Project&quot; (1992), using a satellite launched by Japan, there were joint experiments in applied technology (areas such as distance medicine, distance education, computer networking, satellite broadcast, and joint development of a human resource training system using distance education, as well as the implementation of a continuation project called the &quot;Post-Partners Project&quot; (1996).

Besides this, as using the developed skills and facilities for the benefit of other developing countries, JICA has been active in supporting KMITL in organizing &quot;third-country training&quot; in information technology (started in 1978; presently known as the Japan-Thai Partnership Program, JTTP; having completed 11 programs with 13 courses established), dispatched KMITL professors to the engineering department of National University of Laos and supported KMITL&#x27;s acceptance of research students from universities in Laos.

More recently KMITL has partnered with Thailand Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, a joint effort among Tokyo Institute of Technology, Thailand National Science and Technology Development Agency, KMITL and SIIT to offer international master&#x27;s degree in Automotive Engineering. From its inception, KMITL has grown to include seven faculties and affiliated research centers.

At present, KMITL has been recognized as one of the science and technology universities in Thailand. This could be because of Japan&#x27;s long-term and ongoing assistance; comprehensive assistance to the university, industry and each level of government; the significant influence of early graduates of study abroad programs in Japan. In the future, one can expect continued development through KMITL&#x27;s participation in the Southeast Asia Engineering Education Network (SEED-NET) and strengthening of links with other higher education institutions.

In 2017, Carnegie Mellon University set up a joint institute with KMITL with the support of the Office of the Higher Education Commission. This was named CMKL University and first opened for student admissions in the 2018 academic year.

<text>Aylesworth Bowen Perry, CMG (August 21, 1860 – February 14, 1956) served as the sixth Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, from August 1, 1900, to March 31, 1923.

==Early life==

Aylesworth Perry was born at Violet, near Napanee, Ontario, on August 21, 1860. His father William Perry was a Justice of the Peace, deputy-reeve, and member of the Lennox and Addington County Council. William Perry operated a flour mill and sawmill on Mill Creek in Violet and approximately half of his acres was under cultivation. William Perry married Eleanor Fraser in 1848. Eleanor Fraser was the daughter of Isaac Fraser, a magistrate, a militia colonel, and a onetime member of the Legislative Council. He attended high school in Napanee in 1876. He was educated as part of the first class at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, student #13, one of the &quot;Old Eighteen.&quot; 

Since cadets received their numbers based on their standings in the entrance examinations, he was 13 of 18. At fifteen, he was one of the youngest students at RMC. He graduated at the top of his class receiving the Governor-General&#x27;s gold and silver medals. He received a commission and was gazetted as a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers of the Imperial British Army. A serious accident prevented him from attending the convocation ceremonies. The Commandant of Royal Military College of Canada secured a six-month healing period before Perry reported to the Royal Engineers in England.

==Career==

He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. When the Royal Engineer&#x27;s medical staff determined that Perry&#x27;s leg was not yet properly healed, his commanding officer advised him to return to Canada. He subsequently resigned his commission. He worked as a surveyor in what is now northern Ontario. From 1881 to 1882 Perry worked with the Geological Survey of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario, as a librarian.

On January 24, 1882, he was appointed an inspector in the North-West Mounted Police. During the North-West Rebellion of 1885, he was appointed a major in the Canadian Militia, and received command of the second section of the Alberta Field Force. He led a march from Calgary, Alberta, to Edmonton, Alberta. While crossing the Red Deer River, he nearly died landing a tow rope attached to the raft carrying a field gun. Following the rebellion, he was appointed superintendent of the Prince Albert district, on August 1, 1885.

Since game was disappearing and the incoming of the railways was rendering useless the occupation of freighting on the prairie he recommended that the Métis earn a living through farming, &quot;The mass of the half-breed population must therefore turn their attention to other methods of making a living. They have no alternative: farming must become their occupation in earnest. The English and Scotch half-breeds have already done this successfully; but very few of French descent have yet made any real attempt at it.&quot; Perry continued, &quot;As farming is the inevitable pursuit of the French half-breeds, all who are friendly to them should agree in urging and encouraging them to remain on their present holdings, so that they may at once face their destiny and ultimately obtain the position of a self-supporting people. They should be treated with patience and aided generously, remembering that it is not easy for white men possessing all the advantages of education and civilization to change their occupation. Can the half-breed hunter or freighter be expected to be more apt in adapting himself to change? It would be an astonishing thing if they quietly and quickly adapted themselves to the work of a farm on which success is only obtained by hard, patient and continuous labour.&quot; He concluded, &quot;There is a tendency on the part of some to regard the problem of the future of these people as insolvable. Knowing their many sterling qualities I cannot despair, but believe their descendants will be prosperous and desirable citizens of our North-West Territory.&quot; As Superintendent, in command of the Prince Albert district in 1888, he praised the work of the missionaries amongst the Indians, &quot;The hope of improvement in the Indian lies in the training of the rising generation, and it is to be hoped that before long the children will be taken in hand.&quot;

He was in command at the Depot, Regina, from 1889 to 1897. While in Regina, he qualified in law and was called to the Bar of the North-West Territories.

In 1897, he was given command of the Calgary district. A contingent under his command travelled to London, England, for Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1897. He created a new North-West Mounted Police post at Vancouver. He was placed in command of the police in the Yukon in 1899. &quot;When R.G. Beth remarked to me that it was generally looked on as rather a dangerous thing to let a body of men loose amid the temptations of a strange city, Perry replied: &#x27;That has no bearing on these men, even though there was a saloon on every corner. Every man feels that the honour and good name of the force depend on his individual conduct, and so he can be trusted. 

He was appointed Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police from August 1, 1900, and served until his retirement on April 1, 1923. He served for nearly 23 years in office, and was the longest-serving commissioner of the RCMP. He found it difficult to get convictions in local courts for cattle-killers, mail-robbers and others since jurymen and others sympathized with the accused &quot;I regret that convictions for the serious crimes were not secured against the guilty parties. Evidence was produced for the defence which could well be doubted. Not only has this case produced sympathy for crime, but in other cases, it has been plainly manifested. Petitions have been forwarded to lessen the penalties where laws of the country have wilfully and knowingly been broken. So notorious has this become, that it has disheartened us in attempting to secure criminal convictions. There seems to be an absurd idea that the dismissal of a charge means a snub to the Mounted Police, whereas it strikes home at the root of society and threatens the lives and property of the very men who jeer and flaunt.&quot;

As commissioner, he organized a secret service for intelligence gathering, instituted annual training classes, increased pay rates, revised regulations related to marriage, formed two squadrons to fight in the First World War and approved changes to the uniform, with perhaps the formal adoption of the Stetson hat in 1901 being the most noted. 

Nevertheless, after the Prince Albert mail was held up near Humboldt, the first stage robbery ever accomplished in the territories, Perry and his detachments landed the robber, a man named Garnett, who was given a long-term sentence in the penitentiary.

King Edward VII added the title &quot;Royal&quot; to the North-West Mounted Police in 1904 when Perry was in command. 

In 1909, the following appeared in the London Gazette Supplementary:
&quot;Chancery of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, Downing Street, 9th November 1909 - The King has graciously pleased to give direction for the following appointment to the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George: - To be a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order, Aylesworth Perry, Commissioner of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, Dominion of Canada.&quot;

In 1911, he commanded a contingent of Royal North-West Mounted Police which took part in the Empire Celebrations in England, at the time of the Coronation of King George V and Queen Mary.

The future of the force was in doubt. The departures to serve overseas during World War I, weakened the force. The creation of provincial police forces in Alberta and Saskatchewan reduced the force&#x27;s responsibilities.

The force controlled postwar unrest. Perry was a principal adviser to the government during the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919. 
After the war, he reorganized the force as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. By modernizing the force&#x27;s equipment and methods, he transformed the frontier police to a modern national police force. In 1919, he worked out the details of the force&#x27;s expansion and the move of its headquarters. The Force absorbed the Dominion Police, extended police services throughout Canada and moved headquarters from Regina, Saskatchewan, to Ottawa, Ontario. The Force emerged as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1920.

By February 1, 1920, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were operating throughout Canada. Perry retired from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1923. He was conferred the equivalent military rank of major-general. He died in Ottawa, Ontario, on February 14, 1956, in his 96th year. He was the last surviving member of the &quot;Old Eighteen&quot; from Royal Military College of Canada.

==Family==

Aylesworth Perry married Emma Duranty Meikle, the daughter of the postmaster and general merchant in Lachute, Quebec on June 5, 1883. Their son, Kenneth Meikle Perry (born November 7, 1884) would later become a professor at the Royal Military College of Canada and retire as a Brigadier from the Canadian militia. Aylesworth Perry&#x27;s grandson (through his daughter Gladys Jean Perry and her husband George Leslie Jennings), # 2772 Lt. Bernard P. [Perry] Jennings, Royal Canadian Engineers, graduated from Royal Military College of Canada in 1942 as a member of College&#x27;s, &quot;Last War Class.&quot; He subsequently took part in the D-Day landings, 6 June 1944, but sadly he was killed-in-action near Falaise, Normandy, on 14 August 1944.&quot;

His great-grandson (via another daughter, Jessie Eleanor Perry) is former BC Premier Gordon Campbell, who served from 2001 to 2011.

==Honours==

In 1909, he was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. In 1920 he was given the title &quot;Honorary Aide-de-camp to His Excellency The Governor General&quot;. Upon his retirement, he was awarded the rank of Major-General by the Canadian Militia. In 1948, he was the only member of the &quot;Old Eighteen&quot; to be present at the re-opening of the Royal Military College of Canada and he took the salute for the match past of the &quot;New Hundred&quot;.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police named the A.B. Perry building at the Depot, Regina in his honour. In 2009, 13 Major-General A.B. Perry, CMG ADC (1860–1956) was added to the wall of honour at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. Bowen Island, St. Joseph Channel, Algoma was named in honour of Major General Aylesworth Bowen Perry (RMC 1880), Commissioner, Royal Northwest Mounted Police.

<doc id="1232327" wikidata="Q1871101" url="?curid=1232327" title="Lots Road Power Station">
<text>Lots Road Power Station is a disused gas- and oil-fired power station (originally coal) on the River Thames at Lots Road in Chelsea, London in the south-west of the Royal Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea, which supplied electricity to the London Underground system. It is sometimes erroneously referred to as Fulham Power Station, a name properly applied to another former station a mile south-west along the Tideway.

== History ==

A power station at Lots Road was originally planned by the Brompton &amp; Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&amp;PCR, now part of the Piccadilly line) in 1897. The B&amp;PCR was controlled by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) from 1898, and was sold in 1901 to Charles Yerkes&#x27; Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company, which built the station to provide power to the DR. The station allowed the District line trains to change from steam haulage to electric. At around the same time the Metropolitan Railway built its power station at Neasden.

The station was built end-on to the Thames, on the north bank of the tidal Chelsea Creek. Construction started in 1902 and was completed in December 1904, the station becoming operational on 1 February 1905. The station burned 700 tonnes of coal a day and had a generating capacity of 50,000 kW. At the time it was claimed to be the largest power station ever built, and it eventually powered most of the railways and tramways in the Underground Group.

The station was re-equipped and improved several times. During the early 1920s a sump and hopper system for more efficient fuel handling was installed. It was designed by The Underfeed Stoker Company and constructed under their stewardship by Peter Lind &amp; Company, who still trade in London today. The modernisation undertaken in the 1960s converted the station from  Hz to 50 Hz generation and from coal burning to heavy fuel oil. The number of chimneys was reduced from the original four to two. Between 1974 and 1977, with the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea, the boilers were converted to burn gas, with the option of oil firing if required. The station later worked in conjunction with the ex-London County Council Tramways power station at Greenwich to supply the London Underground network.

The station played a part in the birth of commercial radio in the UK. When the first two radio stations, LBC and Capital Radio, opened in October 1973, the site for their medium wave transmitters was not complete. As a result, a temporary &#x27;Tee&#x27; antenna was strung up between the two chimneys (transmitting LBC on 417 m (719 kHz), and Capital Radio on 539 m (557 kHz)), until the permanent site at Saffron Green was ready in 1975. From 1979 the site was used again, on 720 kHz (for a low power MW relay of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s LW service) which was in use until 2001 when the radio transmitter was moved to Crystal Palace. Additionally, there were broadcasts of BBC CARFAX experimental traffic information on 526.5 kHz, 1979–1981, and Spectrum Radio on 558 kHz, 1990-2001.

In July 1992, it was decided not to re-equip Lots Road again; rather it was to continue to operate only until the machinery&#x27;s life was expired. On 21 October 2002, Transport Minister John Spellar switched off the turbines, ending 97 years of electricity generation. Since 2002, all power for the London Underground has been supplied from the National Grid (except that Greenwich Power Station is kept on standby, in case of National Grid failure).
==Redevelopment==
In 1999, London Transport sold the power station site to Circadian for £34 million. Circadian wished to convert the power station into shops, restaurants and apartments, and to construct additional buildings, including two skyscrapers, on the adjoining vacant land. The scheme was delayed because Kensington &amp; Chelsea Council refused planning permission for one of the two towers. The other, South Tower, the taller, was granted permission by Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council, but the developer was unwilling to proceed without permission for both. On 30 January 2006 the Secretary of State, considering especially views of the Planning Inspector, granted planning permission for the development. In 2007 the developer hoped to complete the scheme by 2013, but it was delayed by the economic downturn.

On 13 September 2010, Thames Water announced that they would be building the Thames Tideway super sewer. One of the preferred accesses, Cremorne Wharf Foreshore, adjoins but which will end a nearby combined sewer overflow. The consultation period ended in Autumn 2010.

On 26 September 2013, developer Hutchison Whampoa Properties broke ground on the eight-acre site, rebranding it as &quot;Chelsea Waterfront&quot;, with Mayor of London Boris Johnson speaking at the ceremony: &quot;The £1 billion scheme will be the biggest riverside development on the north bank [of the Thames] for over 100 years, and will create 706 homes.&quot; 

New planning and design details were conceived between 2010 and 2012, with construction for the first phase (100 apartments) completed by 2016, and phase two, which included the power station itself, completed by 2018.

<doc id="1232329" wikidata="Q7627259" url="?curid=1232329" title="Stuart Wood (police commissioner)">
<text>Stuart Zachary Taylor Wood, CMG (October 17, 1889 – January 4, 1966) served as the ninth Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, from March 6, 1938 to April 30, 1951.

==Early life and career==
Born in Napanee, Ontario, Wood&#x27;s father, Zachary Taylor Wood, CMG served in the North-West Mounted Police from 1885 to 1915 and was Acting Commissioner of the Force.

Wood attended the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario where he graduated in 1912. Shortly after he secured a commission in the RNW Mounted Police and served with the Force until his retirement in 1951, almost forty years.

Wood himself served in World War I as a lieutenant in the cavalry in France and Belgium. He served in the Yukon upon returning to Canada in 1919 as Justice of the Peace, Coroner, Sheriff, Game Inspector and Customs Officer.

==Reforms==
When Wood became an Acting Royal Canadian Mounted Police commissioner he initiated many changes. Through 1945 and 1946 he established a system of registration for aliens, and dealt with espionage cases. In the North, he recruited new policing detachments. He organized a permanent Royal Canadian Mounted Police Band, (later disbanded by Commissioner Inkster in 1994). He established the first RCMP scientific laboratory and museum in Regina, Saskatchewan.

Wood also established a horse breeding station at Fort Walsh. He improved wireless communication and broadcasting and instituted a preventive policing program for youth. He negotiated provincial policing contracts for Newfoundland and British Columbia. Under his leadership the RCMP force grew gradually and scientific methods of crime detection improved enhancing law enforcement and crime prevention. Wood retired from the RCMP in 1951 and died in 1966. He was buried in Regina, Saskatchewan.

==PROFUNC==
In the 1950s Wood was responsible for compiling a &quot;blacklist&quot; called PROFUNC, which was a Government of Canada top secret plan to identify and detain communist sympathizers during the height of the Cold War.

In October 2010, a joint CBC/Radio-Canada investigation revealed that information gathered under PROFUNC have most probably been used during the 1970 October Crisis, when Canada invoked the War Measures Act and suspended civil liberties in Canada.

==Personal life==
Wood was the great-great grandson of U.S. President Zachary Taylor. Zachary&#x27;s third daughter, Anne, married Robert C. Wood, a U.S. Regular Army surgeon, who served the Union during the Civil War, though their two sons served the Confederacy. One of their sons, John Taylor Wood, had been an officer in the U.S. Navy, but with the outbreak of the Civil War resigned, later joining the Confederate Marine Corps, and later served as an officer on board the famed ironclad CSS Virginia during her encounter with the USS Monitor. He afterwards became a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate Army. After the war John Taylor Wood relocated to Canada.

Wood is the nephew of RMC Graduate No. 352, British Army Lieutenant Charles Carroll Wood (1876-1899), who died of wounds in South Africa in 1899 as a member of the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) during the Second Boer War.

Wood&#x27;s three sons and two daughters, Donald Zachary Taylor Wood (KIA, 1944), Constables John Taylor Wood II and Theodore Herschel Taylor Wood, also served on the Force. His son Herschel was killed on duty in 1950. Both Herschel and his father are buried in the RCMP Depot in Regina. Wood&#x27;s son John retired from the RCMP as Inspector in 1988.

<text>1000 de la Gauchetière is a skyscraper in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is named for its address at 1000 De la Gauchetière Street West in the downtown core. It is Montreal&#x27;s tallest building as per the height definition of the National Building Code of Canada that is used by the city of Montreal, which excludes spires.
For international comparison, spires are included as per the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat&#x27;s most widely used height definition for building height and the building is thus the second tallest building as per this definition. It rises to the maximum elevation approved by the city (the elevation of Mount Royal) at 232.5m above mean sea level with a total height from the average ground level around first floor to roof of 205m (673ft) and 51 floors. A popular feature of the building is its atrium, which holds a large ice skating rink. The building was not subject to the 1992 municipal maximum height of 200m because it was finished in 1992.

==History==

The building was designed by Lemay &amp; Associates and Dimakopoulos &amp; Associates architects, and built in 1992 at the same time as the nearby 1250 René-Lévesque which rises at 47 floors. It is an example of postmodern architecture, with a distinctive triangular copper roof as well as four copper-capped rotunda entrances at the tower base corners, which were inspired from the Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral on the north side of the building, following the trend set by Place de la Cathédrale (KPMG Tower) of Montreal skyscrapers borrowing some of their design from that of the nearest church. Also, the semispherical corner caps mirror the shape of the half-circular windows of neighbouring Marriott Château Champlain hotel, which were themselves inspired by the arches of the adjoining Windsor Station.

The 1000 de la Gauchetière was built by Pomerleau Inc., the largest construction company in Quebec and one of the top general contractors in Canada.

When it was built, 1000 de la Gauchetière was owned jointly by Bell Canada and Teleglobe. In 2002, SITQ, a division of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), bought the building for . With the merger of all CDPQ real estate assets in 2011, ownership has been transferred to Ivanhoé Cambridge. In 2021, it was bought by the real estate companies MACH and Groupe Petra.

==Height and architecture==
To be precise, the tower is Montreal&#x27;s tallest if it is measured to the roof. Although 1250 René-Lévesque possesses a spire that exceeds 1000 de La Gauchetière in height, the building itself is shorter. Also, when it is viewed as part of the skyline, 1000 de la Gauchetière appears from certain angles to be shorter because it is built on lower ground, allowing it to be taller while it still obeyed height restrictions relative to Mount Royal. 

The building&#x27;s structural core is of concrete, with steel making up the rest of the floorplates. It is serviced by 22 elevators, and its recessed corners allow up to 12 corner offices per floor.

The building&#x27;s architecture is similar to that of the Chase Tower in Dallas, Texas, United States, but with the street-level architecture projecting out in a distinct style, reducing the visual and psychological impact of the entire building from this viewpoint. Such details are features of postmodern architecture.

==Features==
In addition to its office space and shopping areas, it includes a full-size indoor ice skating rink, a physical fitness centre, a major bus terminal (the Downtown Terminus) serving RTL city and commuter buses to Longueuil, Brossard and other South Shore communities, and links to other underground city buildings, Central Station, Lucien-L&#x27;Allier Station and the Bonaventure Metro station.

<text>Leonard Hanson Nicholson, OC, MBE, GCStJ (June 8, 1904 – March 22, 1983) served as the tenth Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, from May 1, 1951 to March 31, 1959.

Nicolson served with the RCMP from 1923 to 1927 (and again from 1932 to 1941), New Brunswick Provincial Police 1928–1930, Nova Scotia Police 1930–1932, then with the Canadian Army from 1941 to 1951.

Nicholson had only a primary school education leaving school to assist his family. He served as a Provost marshal in World War II.

He also served as deputy Chief Scout of Scouts Canada. In 1971, Nicholson was awarded the 71st &quot;Bronze Wolf&quot;, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.

==Legacy==

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police headquarters building in Ottawa, Ontario was named after Nicholson.

He is the highest-decorated RCMP officer in Canadian history and his medals are currently located at the RCMP headquarters in Regina. In 1955 he received an honorary LL.D. from the University of New Brunswick. In 1967 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). In 1967 as well he was inversted as Bailiff Grand Cross of the Canadian priory of the Venerable Order of Saint John.

<text>The Diablo 630 is a discontinued daisy wheel style computer printer sold by the Diablo Data Systems division of the Xerox Corporation beginning in 1980. The printer is capable of letter-quality printing; that is, its print quality is equivalent to the quality of an IBM Selectric typewriter or printer, the de facto quality standard of the time.

==Overview==
The printer is capable of this quality at a nominal speed of 30 characters per second (roughly twice the speed of the Selectric). Several technologies were introduced to enable this quality and speed:
* The lightweight daisy wheel is rotated by a closed-loop servo and can be positioned rapidly and accurately. Because the wheel can turn in either direction, the next character is never more than 180° away from the previous character (and related characters are grouped together so the average &quot;seek&quot; is much less than 180°).

* Like the &quot;typeball&quot; element on a Selectric, the daisy wheel can be easily changed, allowing for a wide variety of fonts and character pitches.
* Some models can use wheels with two rows of characters, allowing for the machine to print in two different languages or with a large set of special symbols.
* The printer uses cartridge-loaded ribbons; both an economical endless cloth ribbon and a high-quality single-use film ribbon were available, with colored ribbons provided by third parties. By contrast, Selectric-based printers can use only one type of ribbon—cloth or single-use carbon film—and were almost always equipped for the former for economic reasons. 
* The carriage is also servo-controlled and the printer can print with the carriage moving either forward or backward, saving most of the time that would otherwise be spent executing carriage returns. 
* The servo control of the carriage permitted the use of proportionally-spaced fonts, wherein each character does not have to occupy the same amount of horizontal space. 
* Unlike Selectric-based printers, daisy wheel printers support the entire ASCII printing character set. 
* Bidirectional paper motion is similarly servo-controlled, allowing quick printing of subscripts and superscripts as well as fast slewing past white space.
* Servo control of both paper and carriage permitted the unit to be used for plotting, with resolution of 120×48 steps per inch. This was popular enough that special daisy wheels were made with a reinforced period (.), the character most often used for plotting. 
* The logic permits simultaneous motion of the wheel, the carriage, and the paper. The hammer automatically strikes only after all three motions complete. This minimized the time spent waiting for the motions to complete.

A related model, the Diablo 1620, includes a keyboard and strongly resembles a slightly overgrown Selectric typewriter. In fact, a &quot;local/remote&quot; switch permits it to be used as an offline typewriter as well as an interactive computer terminal. Unfortunately for a typist (in either role), the daisy wheel mechanism hides the area just printed. Firmware in the machine makes the carriage move quickly to the right of the typing position, revealing the most recently typed characters, after a few moments of inactivity. The result was still unsatisfactory to many users. Only a very slow typing speed would allow the wheel to get out of the way after every character; faster typing speeds resulted in the wheel continuously hiding the typed copy until the typist paused. This made checking the copy for errors a bit more awkward and slow than on actual typewriters or on Selectric-based terminals. 

The same mechanism was used in Xerox&#x27;s 850 display typing system and 860PDS word processor, and was also sold to OEMs. One notable user was Digital Equipment Corporation, who resold the printer as the LQP01 (with a parallel interface) and the LQPSE (with an RS-232 serial interface), supported by Digital&#x27;s WPS-8 word processing software.

The printer became so common, with so much software supporting its command language, that Diablo emulation became an expected feature on other daisy-wheel printers and even on early laser printers. This was so pervasive that at least one company lived by testing printers for full Diablo 630 compatibility.

<text>Charles Edward Rivett-Carnac (August 31, 1901 – July 18, 1980) was a Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
A descendant of Sir James Rivett-Carnac, Rivett-Carnac, was born in Eastbourne, Sussex, England and soon after his birth, was taken by his father to Assam in India. He lived there until he returned to England at the age of six and spent his early childhood living with an aunt and uncle. He attended St Cyprian&#x27;s School and when he was 14 went on to Eastbourne College as a boarder. A year later he was moved again to live with a different aunt in London, where he went to a local grammar school. Rivett-Carnac did not enjoy school, and during World War I loaned money off a friend to learn to drive so that he could join the British Red Cross as an ambulance driver. At the age of 16, he joined the French Ambulance Corps and served on the front line.

===India===
After the war, he joined his father, who was Deputy Inspector General of the Indian Imperial Police in India. Here Rivett-Carnac was in charge of the Assam Sawmills and Timber Company forest operations for the Tezpur area of India. Working in the elephant camps of the jungle took its toll on Rivett-Carnac, and he began to suffer from malaria. He soon left the jungle and worked as an assistant manager for the Bisra Stone Lime Company. A few months later, due to his poor health he was sent to work at the head office in Calcutta where medical facilities were more readily available.

<text>Cannabidivarin (CBDV, GWP42006) is a non-intoxicating psychoactive cannabinoid found in &quot;Cannabis&quot;. It is a homolog (chemistry) of cannabidiol (CBD), with the side-chain shortened by two methylene bridges (CH2 units).

Although cannabidivarin (CBDV) is usually a minor constituent of the cannabinoid profile, enhanced levels of CBDV have been reported in feral populations of &quot;C. indica&quot; ( = &quot;C. sativa&quot; ssp. &quot;indica&quot; var. &quot;kafiristanica&quot;) from northwest India, and in hashish from Nepal.

CBDV demonstrated anticonvulsant in rodent models in a single published study. It was identified for the first time in 1969 by Vollner et al.

Similarly to CBD, it has seven double bond isomers and 30 stereoisomers (see: Cannabidiol#Isomerism). It is not scheduled by Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It is being actively developed by GW Pharmaceuticals (as GWP42006) because of a demonstrated neurochemical pathway for previously observed anti-epileptic and anti-convulsive action. GW has begun several Phase-2 trials for adult epilepsy, for childhood epilepsy and for Prader-Willi Syndrome.

<doc id="1232360" wikidata="Q467094" url="?curid=1232360" title="Oumou Sangaré">
<text>Oumou Sangaré (; born 25 February 1968) is a Malian Wassoulou singer of Fulani (Fula) descent. She is often referred to as &quot;The Songbird of Wassoulou&quot;. Wassoulou is a historical region south of the Niger River, where the music descends from age-old traditional song, often accompanied by a calabash.

==Early life==
Sangaré was born in 1968 to singer Aminata Diakité and Sidiki Sangaré, both of whom originated from the Wassoulou region. In 1970, her father took a second wife and moved to Abidjan, leaving Sangaré, her mother and her siblings behind in Bamako. She began singing in the streets to help her mother, leaving school at an early age to do so. Her career began in 1973 when, at the age of five, she won an inter-kindergarten singing competition in Bamako, going on to perform before an audience of several thousand at the Omnisport stadium. At 16, she went on tour with the percussion group Djoliba, touring in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Caribbean, and elsewhere. Inspired by her reception on tour, Sangaré returned to Bamako and established her own musical group.

==Career==

Sangaré recorded her first album, &quot;Moussoulou&quot; (&quot;Women&quot;), with Amadou Ba Guindo, a renowned maestro of Malian music. The album was very successful in Africa, with more than 200,000 copies sold.

With the help of Ali Farka Touré, Sangaré signed with the English label World Circuit. They re-released the album &quot;Moussoulou&quot;. At the age of 21, she was already a star.

Oumou Sangaré is considered an ambassador of Wassoulou; her music has been inspired by the music and traditional dances of the region. She writes and composes her songs, which often include social criticism, especially concerning women&#x27;s low status in society.

Since 1990 she has performed at some of the most important venues in the world, such as the Melbourne Opera, Roskilde Festival, Gnaoua World Music Festival, WOMAD, Oslo World Music Festival, and the Opéra de la Monnaie.

Many of Sangaré&#x27;s songs concern love and marriage, especially freedom of choice in marriage. Her 1989 album &quot;Moussoulou&quot; was an unprecedented West African hit. In 1995, she toured with Baaba Maal, Femi Kuti, and Boukman Eksperyans. Other albums include &quot;Ko Sira&quot; (1993), &quot;Worotan&quot; (1996), and a 2-CD compilation &quot;Oumou&quot; (2004), all released on World Circuit Records. Sangaré supports the cause of women throughout the world. She was named an ambassador of the FAO in 2003 and won the UNESCO Prize in 2001 and was made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters of France in 1998.

Sangaré is featured prominently in &quot;Throw Down Your Heart&quot;, a 2008 documentary about world-renowned American banjo player Béla Fleck, and his exploration of the relatively unknown relationship between his instrument and the musical traditions in Africa.

Sangaré contributed vocals to &quot;Imagine&quot; for the 2010 Herbie Hancock album &quot;The Imagine Project&quot;, which also featured Seal, P!nk, India.Arie, Jeff Beck, Konono Nº1 and others.

In 2022, she was cast in her first acting role, playing the title character&#x27;s grandmother in Maïmouna Doucouré&#x27;s film &quot;Hawa&quot;.

== Personal life, politics and business ==
Sangaré is an advocate for women&#x27;s rights, opposing child marriage and polygamy.

Sangaré is also involved in the world of business, including hotels, agriculture, and automobiles. She has launched a car, the &quot;Oum Sang&quot;, manufactured by a Chinese firm and marketed in conjunction with her own company Gonow Oum Sang. She is the owner of the 30-room Hotel Wassoulou in Mali&#x27;s capital, Bamako, a haven for musicians and her own regular performing space. &quot;I helped build the hotel myself. I did it to show women that you can make your life better by working. And many more are working these days, forming co-operatives to make soap or clothes.&quot;

Sangaré has also been a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, but says she does not want to be a politician: &quot;While you&#x27;re an artist, you&#x27;re free to say what you think; when you&#x27;re a politician, you follow instructions from higher up.&quot;

She is a half-sister of Polish-born actor Omar Sangare.

<text>Fanta Damba (born 1938 in Ségou) is a Malian djelimuso (Bambara female Griot-singer) known to her fans as La Grande Vedette Malienne. Damba was a successful Mali musician born into the Jeli family, who are often called Griots. She began singing as a child while being surrounded by a family full of musicians. Damba began recording in her early twenties with Radio Mali. Fanta was one of Mali&#x27;s most famous women from 1960 to 1970. In 1975, she became the first djelimuso to tour Europe solo and was also known for performing at the Mali national ensemble performance of the African Festival of Arts and Culture held in Lagos in 1977. She was rewarded for her talent by being named as a Ngara, which usually recognizes one as being a master musician. Many musicians aspire to be a Ngara, but very few held the title. In order for a Griot to be recognized as a Ngara, one must be considered to possess great courage, are skilled, experienced, disciplined and are a successful musician usually over the age of forty. It is considered a gift that most musicians are recognized as having at an early age. A Ngara also usually has a strong middle tone voice that can control the crowd with emotions. Mali women such as Fanta were known for their praise singing and did not play a variety of instruments unlike the men. She inspired other famous Mali musicians such as Yousou NDour, who went to visit Fanta and was so taken away by her music that he was inspired to write the song Wareff in relevance to Fanta&#x27;s song Djadjiri. Female Mali musicians typically received more attention and gifts such as cars, houses, jewelry, and gold than male Mali musicians. They were represented through the media, concerts, markets, and were perceived as the stars. Fanta retired as a performer in 1985.

<doc id="1232388" wikidata="Q8012327" url="?curid=1232388" title="William Leonard Higgitt">
<text>William Leonard Higgitt (10 November 1917 – 2 April 1989) was the 14th commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), holding office from 1969 to 1973, and President of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) from 1972 to 1976. Leonard Higgitt&#x27;s background in intelligence and counterintelligence during and after World War II made him the preferred choice as RCMP Commissioner at what was the height of the Cold War. Higgitt&#x27;s tenure as Canada&#x27;s top spy, first, and then as RCMP Commissioner, also coincided with the civil rights movement in the United States, which was part of a period of broader political unrest and social change in Canada, including the Quebec nationalist movement and first-ever diplomatic negotiations in Stockholm between Canada and Communist China. Higgitt&#x27;s time as Commissioner was marked by his efforts to balance a traditional view of the Mounties in the eye of the public, and a trust in the RCMP attending that view, with more modern, high-tech, and legally complex policing methods, including surveillance and data-gathering practices that found the RCMP facing increasing media and judicial scrutiny.

Higgitt directed national security operations during the October Crisis of 1970, when members of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) engaged in a series of urban bombings and also kidnapped the provincial Labour Minister Pierre Laporte and British diplomat James Cross. These events represented what was perhaps the most serious threat to national security in the history of Canada, and they also saw then Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, to the objection of Higgitt, invoke the War Measures Act, the first time in Canadian history that the Act was invoked during peacetime.

Higgitt has been the only RCMP commissioner to ever rise to this position after starting from the lowest possible rank—sub-constable, a rank lower than third-class constable and later discontinued by the Force. As Commissioner, Higgitt also presided over the RCMP centenary.

==Early life==
Higgitt was born in the village of Anerley, Saskatchewan, in 1917, to Percy Higgitt and May Higgitt (née Hall), and grew up in Anerley during the Depression years of the 1930s. Being born the same day that his uncle, Lennie Higgitt, died in World War I, he was given the name William Leonard, and was subsequently known as &quot;Len&quot; Higgitt by acquaintances throughout his life. Percy Higgitt&#x27;s family traces their roots to Sheffield, Yorkshire, and May Hall to Boston, Lincolnshire. Percy immigrated to Saskatchewan in 1908, meeting May Hall there and starting a farm. Percy gave up his struggling farm when Leonard was four to be an Imperial Oil agent and grain buyer for the Canadian Consolidated Grain Company; later taking over the lone general store and post office in Anerley, which he operated for over forty years. Percy also provided municipal public service in various capacities. After primary schooling, Leonard Higgitt went to high school at Saskatoon Technical Collegiate. As a student in 1935, Higgitt featured in his high school&#x27;s production of the comedy &quot;So This Is London&quot;. In his student years, Higgitt also played hockey, baseball and soccer.

Wrote the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix in 1972, from very early on in his life Higgitt believed in the RCMP as a force for good: &quot;Rural Saskatchewan offered little in the 1930s for a young man ready to set out on his own and, in the drought and dust and poverty, the RCMP stood out as a high and noble profession&quot;. Interviewed in 1972 by the Winnipeg Free Press, Higgitt said that as a youth he was struck by the dedication RCMP officers seemed to display in coping with the problems and hardships brought on by the Depression: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just a matter of enforcing the law. It was a question of helping anyone who was in need. And no one who didn&#x27;t live through that era can really appreciate what the needs were.&quot; After graduating from high school in 1937, at the age of nineteen, and two years before World War II began, Higgitt joined the RCMP at Regina, Saskatchewan, as a sub-constable; a rank later discontinued by the force. In Regina he completed recruit training, winning a medal for marksmanship, and became a stenographer at &quot;F&quot; Division headquarters. In 1937, Higgitt&#x27;s was the first voice of a Mountie to be heard on the open airwaves, as police cars at the time were not yet equipped with two-way radios and it was necessary for Mounties to use commercial radio stations to send bulletins, including descriptions of wanted men, to detachment personnel twice daily.
Promoted to Constable, in Regina Higgitt supervised general criminal files and engaged in active police investigations, including conducting examinations of witnesses. With the outbreak of the War, and at the age of twenty-two, he was transferred to Ottawa and put immediately into intelligence and counter-intelligence. While assigned field investigations over the War years, Higgitt married a nurse, Evelyn Maude Pyke, of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, in 1944. He also played on the RCMP basketball team in the Ottawa YMCA Basketball league, and on the RCMP soccer team in the Ottawa and District Football Association league. He also represented the RCMP in marksmanship tournaments.

==Career==
===World War II===
Britain and France declared war on Germany in September 1939, and Canada followed. Higgitt was posted to Ottawa, Ontario, for special war duties and &quot;disappeared into&quot; the Intelligence Branch. By the late 1930s, various fascist groups across Canada had combined into the National Unity Party under the leadership of Adrien Arcand. Other such groups, and individuals sympathetic Nazism, remained underground. The Soviets were also using Canada as a staging point for spying on the United States. A Soviet military intelligence illegal carrying a Canadian passport in the name of Ignacy Witczak, obtained in part through the assistance of Sam Carr, an important member of the Communist Party of Canada, had arrived in the US in 1938. As the War escalated, Higgitt was appointed Government advisor to the Commons Judicial Committee on Internment Operations, a committee set up to identify and mitigate potential security risks to Canada and the Allied effort against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.
Prior to the Allies&#x27; pivotal Normandy Landings, the internment operations led to the removal of several hundreds of German- and Italian-born Canadians, Arcand included, to detention camps in Canada&#x27;s hinterlands until the surrender of the Axis powers. On the first day of World War II, RCMP agents broke the German-financed Canadian fascist group &quot;Deutsche Arbeits Front&quot;, interning four hundred Nazis. When Soviet Russia entered the war, more than one hundred Communists were interned at Hull, Quebec. Higgitt and his RCMP superiors advised the Canadian Federal Government that Japanese Canadians, for their part, posed relatively little threat as a supposed &#x27;fifth column&#x27; of spies and saboteurs. Subsequently, the Government, not believing the RCMP, took the responsibility for evacuating coastal Japanese Canadians to interior British Columbia out of the Mounties&#x27; hands and gave it to the BC Security Commission, and in turn, by 1943, to the Department of Labour.

Political scientist Reg Whitaker and historian Gregory Kealey have argued that the relative effectiveness of the RCMP&#x27;s Intelligence Branch in carrying out the responsibility of penetrating and monitoring pro-fascist groups, along with the nullification of the espionage, sabotage, or subversion threats believed to have been posed by these groups, ensured that the RCMP would carry out of the War an enhanced prestige within the Canadian state and some surety of a continued pre-eminent role in security intelligence in the postwar era. Higgitt remained a key figure in the RCMP&#x27;s Cold War-era security intelligence operations. By the end of World War II, it had become clear that though the Nazi presence in Canada was largely subdued, a Soviet spy ring was operating from the rear wing of the Russian Embassy in Ottawa. A Red Army officer at the embassy, Igor Gouzenko, a cipher clerk trained in intelligence work, defected to the RCMP. Gouzenko&#x27;s briefcase, containing Russian-language cablegrams and copied secret Canadian Government papers, secretly given over to Higgitt and the Intelligence Branch, showed that the Russians had details of matters that only Britain and Canada should have known. Gouzenko&#x27;s defection was one of the principle catalysts for the rise of the Cold War; obliging Western governments, including Canada, to maintain and even intensify their undercover work. 

But over the course of his career Higgitt, considering himself a police officer first, also showed consistent unease with paramilitary counterespionage operations that brushed against ethical and legal questions. In the early years of his career it seems Higgitt knew what he was facing, and was even denied a request to get transferred out of the Intelligence Branch and return to regular policing. By 1950, Higgitt had been promoted to officer in charge of the Counter-Espionage Section of the RCMP Security Service, and he wrote to his superiors about what it meant to &quot;fight fire with fire.&quot;

As Whitaker has written, associated with this, as Higgitt realized, was another disturbing aspect of security intelligence work, especially counterespionage: the work could literally lie at the margins of life and death. &quot;Running secret sources and double agents was a very risky business, especially for the sources and agents, but that anxiety could extend to their handlers as well, who had to contend with troubling responsibilities, not to speak of moral dilemmas.&quot;

===The Gouzenko Affair===
In 1945, Higgitt, along with John Leopold of the RCMP&#x27;s Intelligence Branch, who had infiltrated the Communist Party of Canada in the 1920s, and two other future RCMP Commissioners, Charles Rivett-Carnac and Clifford Harvison, was a principal investigator of Igor Gouzenko, a cipher clerk for the Soviet Embassy to Canada who defected on September 5, three days after the official close of the War, with 109 documents on Soviet espionage activities in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Gouzenko had been stationed in Ottawa during the top secret Manhattan Project, which the Soviet Union had been left out of despite the Soviet&#x27;s status as part of the Allied military coalition against Nazi Germany. 


From this point forward, Higgitt was in charge of liaison with the special Crown prosecutors at the series of criminal trials related to Gouzenko and had control of all of the exhibits and documents. Access Gouzenko was kept to a minimum, with only two &#x27;outsiders&#x27; allowed to speak with Gouzenko. One who travelled to Ottawa to meet Gouzenko was William Stephenson. Known by his wartime codename, Intrepid, and working out of an office in New York, Stephenson was the senior representative of the British Security Coordination (BSC) for the Western Allies during World War II, a covert wartime intelligence body run by MI6. The other who came to Ottawa was MI5&#x27;s Roger Hollis, a British agent who oversaw the monitoring of communist threats against the British. 

Gouzenko&#x27;s defection was one of the major catalysts for the beginning of the global Cold War, and compelled RCMP leadership to launch Operation West Wind in order to look into the appropriation and use of Canadian passports by Soviet illegals, and also to organize a special counter-espionage section of the RCMP, which Higgitt headed until 1952. This was a forerunner of the RCMP Security Service, an arm of the RCMP that had responsibility for domestic intelligence and security in Canada. While officer in charge of the counterespionage section, Higgitt, along with his colleagues in allied nations, did not believe that security screening at border crossings was alone proof against the penetration into Canada of Communist Bloc spies. As Higgitt wrote to his superiors in 1952, &quot;We feel a person who has been sent to Canada as a Soviet agent, is not likely to be one whose background, upon enquiry, will show any unusual or suspicious circumstances, but will undoubtedly be a person whose background has been well prepared so that nothing abnormal will become visible from even the closest scrutiny.&quot;

In April 1952, Higgitt was commissioned a Sub-Inspector and shortly afterwards became Inspector and Personnel Officer in Ontario. A year later, in 1953, the KGB agent Yevgeni Brik, while living in Canada under the alias of David Soboloff, confessed to the RCMP Security Service that he had been running a Soviet spy ring inside Canada&#x27;s top-secret Avro Arrow CF-105 interceptor program, and Brik subsequently became a double-agent, the most valuable spy for the West since World War II. Higgitt moved to western Quebec that same year to serve as Inspector at &quot;C&quot; Division, then in June 1954 was transferred to Montreal, Canada&#x27;s largest urban center at the time, to take charge of the RCMP&#x27;s Montreal Subdivision and supervise the RCMP&#x27;s investigation and enforcement of the Canada Customs Act. Higgitt stayed in Montreal for three years. He was the personal escort to Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, and her daughter Princess Alexandra during their visit to Quebec, including the Laurentians, in 1954, and went on to receive additional intensive training in undercover and surveillance operations by the RCMP in 1955. He was next posted to the RCMP&#x27;s Security and Intelligence at RCMP Headquarters in Ottawa in 1957, the year Soviet spy Rudolf Abel was arrested in New York. With the Security Service, Higgitt became the officer in charge of counterespionage under the Directorate of Security and Intelligence.

In October 1957, at the 27th meeting of the Security Sub-Panel, Higgitt informed Canada&#x27;s Privy Council that members of the Soviet Military Attache&#x27;s Office were covertly engaged in making extensive photographic and other records of military, hydro-electric, radio and electronic installations as well as coastlines and general topography throughout Eastern Canada. Two months later, in a secret December 1957 meeting at an Ottawa hotel, Higgitt discovered that Soviet agents had been attempting to recruit members of Higgitt&#x27;s counterespionage unit responsible for surveillance of Soviet-bloc Embassy personnel in Ottawa. Higgitt was subsequently involved in the investigations of KGB agents Rem Krasilnikov and Nikolai Ostrovsky. He was also involved in the coordination of Operation Keystone related to the double-agent Brik, codenamed Gideon, whose whereabouts had become unknown after Brik&#x27;s rendezvous in Moscow with British SIS officer Daphne Park.

===British Intelligence===
Three years later, 1960, Higgitt was assigned to London, England, where he served as Liaison Officer with MI6 and, later, with Western Europe via the Canadian Delegation to the General Assemblies of Interpol. While in London, in January 1961, long-time Soviet illegal and key figure in the Portland spy ring and what the newspapers called &quot;The Microdot Five,&quot; Konon Molody, using the alias &#x27;Gordon Lonsdale&#x27; after adopting the identity of a deceased Canadian child, was arrested on Waterloo Bridge. Two others of The Microdot Five apprehended in London, using the aliases &#x27;Peter Kroger&#x27; and &#x27;Helen Kroger,&#x27; also possessed false Canadian passports. Also in August 1961, a Soviet scientist, Dr. Mikhail A. Klochko, defected to Canada, and shortly thereafter the RCMP Security Service learned that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev had personally passed the order, &quot;Get Klochko&quot;, to the KGB&#x27;s 13th Department. 

Higgitt remained in Europe for three years, travelling extensively and working closely with police organizations and intelligence agencies throughout the continent. In 1961, while stationed in London, he established RCMP connections in The Hague, Cologne, Rome, Brussels, Malmö, at Interpol in Copenhagen with the Danish Minister of Justice, and at NATO headquarters in Paris. In 1962, Higgitt worked with Interpol in Madrid, and in 1963 in Helsinki. Higgitt made regular visits to Bonn to compare notes with Canada&#x27;s Ambassador to West Germany, John Kennett Starnes, who was also head of the allied military mission to Berlin, which sought to collect intelligence on the Soviet military. Starnes eventually went on to become the Director of Canada&#x27;s Security Service, replacing Higgitt in 1969 when Higgitt moved on from the head of the RCMP Security Service to take the job as head of the RCMP.

===Promotion to Commissioner===
Higgitt returned from London to Ottawa in 1963, ending his tenure as RCMP liaison with British Intelligence and taking the position of RCMP Security Service Superintendent. In 1967, Higgitt became RCMP Assistant Commissioner and Director of RCMP Security and Intelligence. In this dual role he worked closely with counterparts in the United States and Europe to monitor communist movements.

In the late 1960s, he was also worried about the potential for racial violence in Canada, particularly in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with the presence there of radical US Black Panther members. In a secret report to the Government in 1968, Higgitt wrote that &quot;The outside influence and support by US Black nationalists, coupled with revolutionary and militant support from organizations in Canada sympathetic to the Negroes&#x27; cause, could very well result in racial violence in Halifax and other centres in Canada having Negro communities&quot;. Community leaders in Halifax expressed concern that this worry, and the surveillance activities it induced, were discriminatory and meant to actually suppress the civil rights movement as opposed to keeping the peace.

In September 1969, Higgitt was promoted to Deputy RCMP Commissioner and became Director of Operations for all Criminal and Security Service matters throughout Canada. He held this position for only twenty-two days before being appointed RCMP Commissioner, over several of his senior officers, by Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, on October 1, 1969. This was the RCMP&#x27;s fourteenth commissioner. John Starnes was also considered for the position.

Upon his appointment, at the height of the Cold War, The New York Times described Higgitt as being &quot;in the tradition of quiet‐spoken, approachable but tough headed men who hardly ever, by word or deed, draw attention to themselves&quot;. This made sense given Higgitt&#x27;s background in intelligence and counterintelligence going all the way back to WWII: &quot;[Higgitt] talked about communist spies like they were the boy next door, implying that he knew them and their methods so well that they can hardly surprise him&quot;.

Reader&#x27;s Digest described &quot;greying, magnetic&quot; Higgitt as &quot;a tough, 53-year-old lawman who worked his way up through the ranks. Higgitt rarely talks publicly about the RCMP, but he runs his 11,250-man organization with the kind of quiet devotion to duty that filled history books with stories of heroic RCMP feats.&quot; The Calgary Herald said that Higgitt and the FBI&#x27;s J. Edgar Hoover have many things in common: &quot;They are relentless civil police officers. They seldom put themselves in public view. And they have reputations for being hard to get to know&quot;. Higgitt continued his duties as Commissioner on a one-year extension granted by Canada&#x27;s Solicitor-General. Upon his promotion to Commissioner, Higgitt told The Los Angeles Times, &quot;I believe Canada has the greatest, most efficient and most human police force in the world&quot;. Following his appointment as Commissioner, Higgitt was unanimously elected a vice-president of Interpol, and he received a tipstaff at the 65th annual conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, London, Ontario.

== RCMP Commissioner ==
In 1970, Commissioner Higgitt announced the construction of a police computer service that at $5 million a year would see the linking of the RCMP to Provincial Police forces in Canada and the end of long rows of grey filing cabinets at RCMP Headquarters. This computer system also had swift relays with the FBI in the United States, processing in seconds information on criminal activity—stolen cars and fugitives—that had formerly taken days. This all came at a time of increasingly tense domestic and global Cold War politics, and indeed in the midst of increasing mutual assistance between the FBI and the RCMP with security information about individuals in both countries apparently conducting subversive or espionage operations with American and/or Canadian significance.

In his first official press interview upon his appointment as RCMP Commissioner, Higgitt was asked whether he thought a Chinese Communist Embassy in Ottawa would pose a new security problem for the federal police. Higgitt&#x27;s immediate answer, widely circulated throughout Canadian media, was that a Chinese Communist presence in Canada would indeed require heightened police vigilance; an answer which displeased Trudeau, who had pressed hard for Canada-China negotiations and a diplomatic exchange between Ottawa and Beijing. Higgitt&#x27;s opinion was that the presence of a Communist Chinese embassy in Ottawa would increase espionage activity in Canada, even if diplomatic links might outweigh those disadvantages. For many American security officials, this was putting it mildly, as they anticipated that Chinese spies in Canada would be gathering information not so much about Canada as the United States. In this first interview Higgitt was also asked about political movements and political protesting on the domestic front. His stated belief was that anybody has a perfect right to get up on a street corner and advocate a change in government, and the police should only intervene when dissenters resort to subversive tactics.

This was also a time when the press were charging that the RCMP was &quot;hung up on its image&quot;, that in pursuit of their duties the Mounties were infringing on civil rights, and that some of the RCMP&#x27;s undercover work was illegal. In a 1970 interview with United Press International (UPI), Higgitt&#x27;s response to these charges was that they were invalid:

===Relations With The FBI===
When Higgitt took office as Commissioner, the Vietnam War was reaching its peak; US President Lyndon Johnson approving an increased maximum of number of US troops. Higgitt, new Security Service Director General John Starnes, and RCMP Inspector Louis G. Pantry, the Mounties&#x27; liaison officer in Washington DC, met with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Chief Inspector William C. Sullivan at the FBI headquarters in Washington, in March 1970. Afterward, public criticism emerged that the RCMP, under Higgitt&#x27;s leadership and acting for the American FBI, was harassing US draft dodgers and deserters seeking refuge in Canada. Higgitt told the UPI that this was not so. &quot;We have conducted no interviews on the FBI&#x27;s behalf. If the FBI asks if someone is in Canada, we tell them yes or no. After all, they have committed a criminal offence under US law, so this is straight cooperation between police forces. We ask the same from them. But we don&#x27;t even give the draft dodger&#x27;s addresses in Canada, only whether they are in the country. William W. Turner, former FBI agent and author of &quot;Hoover&#x27;s FBI: The Man and the Myth&quot;, claimed that the RCMP were turning over US deserters to American border officials. Turner&#x27;s remarks were televised on &quot;Weekend&quot;, a CBC news program. Higgitt denied the allegations the following day: &quot;There is absolutely nothing like this going on. I saw the show... This is the first I&#x27;ve heard of it, and I don&#x27;t believe it. It&#x27;s the same old allegations made time after time after time.&quot;
There was more tension with President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to Ottawa in April 1972, which was only a month before Higgitt returned to Washington to attend Hoover&#x27;s funeral. In October of the year prior Soviet Premier Alexei Kosykin was assaulted by a political protester, and a number of groups had indicated that they would use the Nixon visit as a peg for demonstrations on Parliament Hill against the Vietnam conflict and US economic doctrines. The question of who was to run the security show during the presidential visit to Canada was a sensitive one at the time because it touched upon Canadian sovereignty. White House Secret Service insisted that Higgitt and the RCMP were calling the shots, but the media disputed this.

=== Cold War Espionage ===
Canada&#x27;s Cabinet Committee on Security and Intelligence met on 19 December 1969, and suggested that Canada should expand its capacity to gather intelligence abroad. In January 1970, Higgitt and Starnes met with Prime Minister Trudeau, then flew to London for a week to visit the headquarters of MI5 and SIS, and meet with leaders of Britain&#x27;s intelligence community. Priorities for Higgitt and Starnes were separatism and the close international connections that tied revolutionary groups from Cuba to Europe to the Middle East. In the first part of 1970 the police foiled two kidnapping attempts, first against an Israeli consul and then against the US consul in Montreal. Tensions between the RCMP and the Trudeau Government regarding Maoist China continued as well.

====Covert operations====

In May 1971, after Canada and China had agreed to exchange ambassadors, Higgitt was brought before a Commons Judicial Committee to testify about communist espionage. He was asked by MP Harold Stafford if he maintained his 1969 position that the new embassy would mean an increase in subversion. &quot;That was not quite my statement,&quot; Higgitt replied. Higgitt said that he had been asked at a news conference whether a mainland Chinese embassy would result in more agents in Canada. &quot;In 1969,&quot; Higgitt continued, &quot;the obvious answer had to be yes&quot;. When Stafford pressed the point, Solicitor-General Jean-Pierre Goyer, who had authorized the wiretapping operation, Operation Cobra, against the militant &quot;Agence de Presse Libre du Quebec&quot; (APLQ), intervened to say an improper picture of relations with Communist countries shouldn&#x27;t be developed, as relations are excellent. Goyer went on to defend the Mounties, maintaining that the RCMP was obliged to often engage in surveillance in order to gather intelligence on foreign and domestic subversive activity. MP Donald Stovel Macdonald asked Higgitt to define subversive activity. Higgitt&#x27;s response was that this is a most difficult question that anybody could be asked to answer; that the RCMP and the Canadian Government have argued for years on what a proper definition of subversive activity is.

Less than a year after Higgitt&#x27;s testimony, in April 1972, the Cuba Trade Commission in Montreal was bombed, killing one Cuban and injuring seven others. Seven Cubans were detained and six were charged with weapons possession and interfering with a police investigation which saw the RCMP locate an electronic bomb-firing device as well as a Cuban code book. From Havana, an angered Cuban President, Fidel Castro, charged the Mounties with “brutal and fascist methods” in their handling of the affair. The FBI concluded that the electronic firing device was &quot;quite similar&quot; to that which the US Coast Guard recovered from the attempted bombing of the British deep sea freighter Lancastrian Prince three hundred miles east of Miami, Florida in 1968. 

Higgitt also directed RCMP operations during the FLQ Crisis in Quebec in 1970, which was the last time the War Measures Act would be invoked until Justin Trudeau declared a public order emergency in 2022. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, relations between Canada and France were strained because of what was perceived as official French sympathy for those in Quebec who wanted to take the province out of the Canadian confederation. According to an August 1981 report of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the Trudeau government at the time believed that French intelligence agents in Quebec were funneling money to pro-separatist groups. In June 1970, a bomb had gone off at National Defense Headquarters in Ottawa, killing telecommunications operator Jeanne d&#x27;Arc Saint-Germain. The bombing was attributed to the FLQ. Other bombings in Montreal over the month of July increased the pressure on the RCMP to bring to justice those responsible and to identify their supporters. The CBC said that in the fall of 1970, Trudeau met with Higgitt and John Starnes, and approved plans for spying on French diplomats. Trudeau was said to have told Higgitt and Starnes that he would deny any knowledge of the operation if it was ever discovered.

Concerned that things had gotten out of control, by 1977 a Royal Commission was formed by Justice David McDonald titled &quot;Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP&quot; to investigate allegations of vast wrongdoing by the national police force. In addition to the covert Operation Cathedral, the McDonald Inquiry probed the &quot;countering activities&quot; Operation Oddball and Operation Checkmate undertaken by the RCMP Security Service&#x27;s super-secret &#x27;E Special&#x27; unit. When the McDonald Inquiry concluded in 1981, it was recommended that the RCMP&#x27;s role in intelligence operations be limited, which ultimately resulted in the formation of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service three years later.

=== The October Crisis ===
Federal ministers from Quebec, including Prime Minister Trudeau, believed that the FLQ Crisis only became a crisis because the intelligence on Quebec separatism gathered by the RCMP Security Service was inadequate, if not worse. What followed in the 1970s was a much more aggressive and intrusive pattern of intelligence targeting of Quebec separatism by the Security Service, which blew up in the face of the government with a series of public scandals of RCMP &quot;wrongdoing&quot;—actions that went beyond lawful limits or were seriously questionable from the standpoint of liberal democratic ethics. Whitaker summarizes the situation like this: In effect, the government blamed the RCMP for originally not doing enough, then later blamed the RCMP for going too far, then took matters into their own hands with the War Measures Act.

Higgitt opposed the use of the War Measures Act by the Government of Pierre Elliot Trudeau, which gave the police and military special powers to crack down on the FLQ. According to journalist Peter C. Newman, &quot;[u]nlike most police officers faced by persistent politicians, Higgitt proved to be very tough, very precise, and equally persistent.&quot; On October 13, 1970, Trudeau famously told CBC reporter Tim Ralfe, &quot;Well, just watch me&quot;, after Ralfe questioned Trudeau on how far he would go in the suspension of civil liberties to maintain order. A day later, in a confidential Ottawa meeting with Trudeau, Deputy Minister of Justice Don Maxwell, and Lieutenant General Michael Dare, Higgitt argued against the Act&#x27;s use; telling Trudeau it would be a heavy-handed overstep. Higgitt warned that a broad sweep and preventative detention of suspects in Quebec was not likely to lead to the abductors of the Deputy Premier, Pierre Laporte, and the British Trade Commissioner, James Cross, and that &quot;[these events] ought not to be allowed to over-rule calmer reaction at the federal level.&quot; Only Maxwell agreed with Higgitt. According to security and intelligence scholar, Reg Whitaker, Trudeau and his cabinet deliberately exaggerated the crisis to obtain emergency powers to intimidate Quebec separatists. Trudeau cabinet minister, Don Jamieson, recalled that Higgitt confirmed that the War Measures Act had produced nothing of any consequence to the RCMP&#x27;s investigations.

To the question of why Higgitt wasn&#x27;t listened to by Trudeau in 1970, Starnes put it this way in 1992:

Higgitt called the two kidnappings and murder &quot;probably the most vicious and complicated crimes ever committed in Canada&quot;. Many Members of Parliament came to agree, and questions were asked as to both the excessiveness of the War Measures Act and the failures in intelligence gathering that allowed such events to transpire. Simultaneously, critique was also turned toward the Mounties&#x27; increasing use of electronic surveillance in the name of &#x27;public safety&#x27;. The conflicting interests, then, against the backdrop of ongoing socio-cultural change in Canada, demanded close analysis. The October Crisis and the use of the War Measures Act led to an official critical review of the security and intelligence situation in Canada called the Royal Commission on Security, chaired by Maxwell Mackenzie. Higgitt was questioned, in 1971, by Mackenzie and a House of Commons committee regarding what he knew about the RCMP&#x27;s law-bending or law-violating methods in intelligence gathering. Higgitt denied having any knowledge of RCMP officers&#x27; wiretapping and unlawful break-ins, and the Royal Commission inquiry ultimately produced no evidence that he did know. Globe and Mail journalist Jeff Sallot drew this conclusion: &quot;A trim man even in his fifties, he [(Higgitt)] looked every inch the policeman who had risen to the top because of his intelligence, dedication, and honest hard work. His sharp facial features betrayed no hint that he knew about skeletons in the closet. But in thirty-six years with the force he had learned a lot, especially about how to keep secrets&quot;.

Upon completing its report, the Commission recommended that a new civilian non-police agency be established to perform the functions of a security service in Canada instead of the RCMP. This eventually led, in 1984, to the establishment of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), effectively creating a separation of domestic policing and foreign intelligence in Canada similar to the distinction between the FBI and the CIA in the United States. In an address to the Security Panel (a senior interdepartmental committee of officials), Higgitt termed the recommendation for a separate civilian intelligence service &quot;a travesty of justice,&quot; and added that &quot;the Soviet Intelligence would be jubilant. They could never hope to duplicate the accomplishment&quot;.

=== Kainai Chieftainship ===
Higgitt organized the RCMP Centennial Celebrations in 1973. In early July of that year, in formal ceremonies marking the Centenary, Higgitt along with Queen Elizabeth met Chief David Ahenakew, leader of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, and later with Cree activist Harold Cardinal, Indian Association of Alberta. As many Canadian news media outlets of the time reported, Ahenakew went off program after presenting the Queen with a peace-pipe and affirming the Indigenous Peoples of Saskatchewan&#x27;s ongoing faithfulness to her and the treaties made between Indians and the Canadian Government: Ahenakew told the Queen and Higgitt that Indigenous Peoples &quot;have been prisoners under the yoke of dependency imposed by the Government&quot;, and that &quot;over the years some of your representatives have not respected their commitments&quot;. Higgitt also met with Chief Joe Crowfoot, 77-year-old member of the Blackfoot tribe at Cluny, Alberta, and grandson of Chief Crowfoot of the Blackfoot Confederacy, Kainai Nation, who in 1877 negotiated peace with the Mounties&#x27; first Commissioner, Lieutenant-Colonel James Macleod. Higgitt told Crowfoot, &quot;You put us on a pedestal. You gave us a very heavy responsibility then -- one of conducting ourselves so that you will never be sorry you put us up there in the first place.&quot;
In late July 1973, in Standoff, Alberta, Higgitt was honored with a Kainai Chieftainship by the Blood Indian Band on the Blood Reserve. The Canadian historian Pierre Berton was also given a Chieftainship at the same ceremony, and in Berton&#x27;s autobiography Berton said it was one of the greatest honors of both his and Higgitt&#x27;s lives: &quot;The Commissioner of the RCMP, W.L. Higgitt, who was also being awarded with an eagle feather headdress, turned to me in a deadpan voice and whispered, &#x27;We must be prepared to sell our lives as dearly as possible!&#x27;.&quot;

Higgitt was given the Blackfoot name &quot;Great Chief&quot; and was presented with a head-dress and peace pipe by Joe Chief Body, Bob Black Plume, and Blood Reserve war veteran Pat Eaglechild. In turn, Higgitt and Sgt. B. Thorstad, NCO in charge of the RCMP&#x27;s Cardston Detachment, presented Chief Jim Shot Both Sides with an honorary RCMP Centenary Winchester Rifle in appreciation of the one hundred years of peaceful association between the Blood Tribe and the RCMP; pledging that the RCMP would continue to work in the service of the Kainai and the Blackfoot Confederacy. Centennial neck medallions were also given to other present-day Chiefs of the tribes involved in the signing of Treaty 7: Chief Leo Pretty Young Man of the Blackfoot Band, Chief Gordon Crowchild of the Sarcee Band, Chief John Snow of the Wesley Band, and Chief Frank Kaquitts of the Chiniquay Band. In her address to Higgitt and the assembled Chiefs, Alberta Indian Princess Jenny Fox said: &quot;I&#x27;m very happy to see so many people down here to honor the RCMP and new members of the Kainai Chieftainship. In spite of all the criticism and unfairness that some people give to the RCMP, we have to admit one thing, and that is that they have given us one of the most important things in our society today, that which is law and order&quot;.

Higgitt was also appointed Commander in the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem (Order of St. John), invested with the insignia of that rank in 1971 by Governor General Roland Michener. He was awarded the Canadian Centennial Medal and the RCMP Long Service Medal.

==President of Interpol==
Higgit served in London as the RCMP Liaison Officer for the United Kingdom and Western Europe, and was a member of the Canadian Delegation to the General Assemblies of Interpol in 1961, in Copenhagen, and 1962, in Madrid. As RCMP Commissioner he also led the Canadian Delegation to Mexico City in 1969. In 1971, while Higgitt was RCMP Commissioner, Canada and the RCMP hosted the 40th General Assembly of Interpol in Ottawa, which featured fifty delegations representing national policing organizations across the world. In 1972, at Interpol&#x27;s 41st Plenary Meeting in Frankfurt, Higgitt was elected President of Interpol. This marked the first time a president from outside Europe was elected. Higgitt&#x27;s first year as President of Interpol coincided with his final year as RCMP Commissioner.

Higgitt set currency counterfeiting and the growing global narcotics trade as Interpol&#x27;s top priorities., and in one of his first moves as president, Higgitt and Paul Dickopf, along with Interpol Secretary-General Jean Népote, representing the Interpol Executive Committee, met in Washington with Kenneth S. Giannoules of the United States Secret Service to discuss Interpol&#x27;s Narcotics Intelligence Program. Higgitt also sought to keep politics out of Interpol, telling the 45th Annual General Assembly of Interpol in Accra, Ghana, that Interpol operated under no racial discrimination nor political influence. Likewise, Higgitt told the London Sunday Times in 1974 that if Interpol became a political body like the United Nations, debating definitions of terrorism, it would find itself increasingly unsuccessful in its intelligence-gathering operations and eventually break apart. This statement came in the wake of the Lod Airport massacre in Israel, planned and carried out in 1972 by the Japanese Red Army, a Marxist group that had grown out of the student protest movement at Japanese universities and by the 1970s had expanded its field of operations across the globe.

1972 was also the year Canadian Justice Minister, John Turner, and the Commons Justice and Legal Affairs Committee became interested in the intelligence-gathering methods of the RCMP&#x27;s Security Service and Criminal Investigations Branch; in particular whether any of their methods were unlawful. Higgitt appeared before the Committee on May 29, 1973, to testify. He denied that the RCMP engaged in wiretapping surveillance practices, even though suspicion about the RCMP had prompted Turner to propose Criminal Code amendments which would outlaw all forms of electronic eavesdropping, except by police, who would be required to obtain a search warrant either from a judge in criminal cases or the solicitor-general in national security cases. There was no indication that Higgitt knew at the time of his testifying that the RCMP&#x27;s Criminal Investigations Branch had used or was using wiretapping.

== Retirement ==
Commissioner Higgitt retired from Interpol in 1976; going on to serve for several years as president of Canada&#x27;s Safety Council. In May 1978, Higgitt, promoting Child Safety Week, wrote &quot;Whatever we offer to our children will be meaningless if we are unable to offer them the most important thing of all: a safe, happy life.&quot;

In October 1978, just after the Canadian Government expelled thirteen suspected Soviet spies from Ottawa, the largest diplomatic expulsion in Canadian history, Higgitt was called before the Royal Commission of Inquiry Concerning Certain Activities of the RCMP. Higgitt testified that he was unaware that the force had burned a barn, stolen dynamite, issued a fake terrorist communique and taken Parti Quebecois membership lists—four of eleven areas of investigation by the Inquiry. In a follow-up testimony in 1980, Higgitt said that in his capacity as RCMP Commissioner, he and Director General of the RCMP&#x27;s Security Service, John Kennett Starnes, had discussed with Cabinet Ministers, including Turner and other senior Canadian Government officials, the possibility of surveilling foreign agents via electronic eavesdropping, and of similar intelligence-gathering methods in the wake of the bombings during the FLQ crisis. Higgitt maintained that his &quot;political masters&quot; in Ottawa had given their implied consent to the use of wiretapping and other forms of electronic surveillance.

Higgitt died in Ottawa on April 2, 1989, and was buried in the RCMP cemetery in Regina, Saskatchewan. He told the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; in 1972, &quot;If I had it to do over again, I would do exactly the same thing I have done. And I wouldn&#x27;t be the slightest bit concerned whether I ended up as Commissioner or not.&quot; &quot;As a lone Mountie bugler played the Last Post, a troop of scarlet-clad fellow officers and a small gathering of family and friends paid their last respects to a man known by many as a great Canadian&quot;. During his eulogy in the RCMP Chapel, Regina, Assistant Commissioner Cortlandt Macdonell praised his former commanding officer as the man who set the standard for his fellow Mounties. &quot;His indeed was a lifetime dedicated not only to the people of Canada but to democracy&quot;.

<doc id="1232389" wikidata="Q6056423" url="?curid=1232389" title="Interposition">
<text>Interposition is a claimed right of a U.S. state to oppose actions of the federal government that the state deems unconstitutional. Under the theory of interposition, a state assumes the right to &quot;interpose&quot; itself between the federal government and the people of the state by taking action to prevent the federal government from enforcing laws that the state considers unconstitutional. 

The theory of interposition is grounded in the text of the Tenth Amendment, which states: &quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.&quot;

In &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot;, 358 U.S. 1 (1958), the Supreme Court of the United States rejected interposition explicitly. The Supreme Court and the lower federal courts have consistently held that the power to declare federal laws unconstitutional lies with the federal judiciary, not with the states. The courts have held that interposition is not a valid constitutional doctrine when invoked to block enforcement of federal law.

Interposition is closely related to the theory of nullification, which holds that the states have the right to nullify federal laws that are deemed unconstitutional and to prevent enforcement of such laws within their borders.

Though interposition and nullification are similar, there are some differences. Nullification is an act of an individual state, while interposition was conceived as an action that would be undertaken by states acting jointly. Nullification is a declaration by a state that a federal law is unconstitutional accompanied by a declaration that the law is void and may not be enforced in the state. Interposition also involves a declaration by a state that a federal law is unconstitutional, but interposition as originally conceived does not result in a declaration by the state that the federal law may not be enforced in the state. Rather, the law would still be enforced. Thus, interposition may be seen as more moderate than nullification.

There are various actions that a state might take to &quot;interpose&quot; itself once it has determined that a federal law is unconstitutional. These actions include communicating with other states about the unconstitutional law, attempting to enlist the support of other states, petitioning Congress to repeal the law, introducing Constitutional amendments in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention.

Interposition and nullification often are discussed together, and many of the same principles apply to both theories. In practice, the terms nullification and interposition often have been used indistinguishably. John C. Calhoun indicated that these terms were interchangeable, stating: &quot;This right of interposition, thus solemnly asserted by the State of Virginia, be it called what it may – State-right, veto, nullification, or by any other name – I conceive to be the fundamental principle of our system.&quot; During the fight over desegregation of the schools in the south in the 1950s, a number of southern states tried to preserve their segregated schools by passing so-called &quot;Acts of Interposition&quot; that actually would have had the effect of nullification, if they had been valid. These acts were struck down by the courts, whether labelled acts of interposition or nullification.

==Virginia Resolution==

Interposition was first suggested in the Virginia Resolution of 1798, written by James Madison, which stated:

That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it views the powers of the federal government, as resulting from the compact, to which the states are parties; as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting the compact; as no further valid that they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact; and that in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the states who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them.

By this statement, James Madison asserted that the states are &quot;duty bound to interpose&quot; to prevent the harm that would result from a &quot;deliberate, palpable, and dangerous&quot; unconstitutional action by the federal government. Madison did not specify the procedural legal details of how this interposition would be enacted or what result it would have. The Virginia Resolution, unlike the contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, did not assert that the states may declare a federal law null and void. The Virginia Resolution thus is sometimes considered to be more tempered than the Kentucky Resolutions, which assert that a state may nullify unconstitutional federal laws.

The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions were not accepted by any of the other states. Seven states formally responded to Kentucky and Virginia by rejecting the resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval. At least six states responded to the Resolutions by taking the position that the constitutionality of acts of Congress is a question for the federal courts, not the state legislatures. For example, Vermont&#x27;s resolution stated: &quot;That the General Assembly of the state of Vermont do highly disapprove of the resolutions of the General Assembly of Virginia, as being unconstitutional in their nature, and dangerous in their tendency. It belongs not to state legislatures to decide on the constitutionality of laws made by the general government; this power being exclusively vested in the judiciary courts of the Union.&quot;

In 1800, the Virginia Legislature issued a report responding to the criticism of the Virginia Resolution. Madison wrote the Report of 1800. Madison affirmed each part of the Virginia Resolution, and again argued that the states have the right to interpose when they believe a federal law is unconstitutional. He explained that a state&#x27;s act of interposition, unlike a judicial interpretation of the Constitution, has no legal effect. Rather, when the states interpose and declare a federal law unconstitutional, these declarations &quot;are expressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion, by exciting reflection. The expositions of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into immediate effect by force.&quot; Madison explained that the purpose of a state&#x27;s declaration of unconstitutionality is to mobilize opposition to the federal law and to enlist the cooperation of other states. Madison said that the states might take various types of joint action to remedy the situation, such as jointly applying to Congress for repeal of the law, instructing their senators to submit a constitutional amendment, or calling a convention to propose constitutional amendments.

During the Nullification Crisis of the 1830s, Madison further explained the concept of interposition as set forth in his Virginia Resolution. Madison denied that any single state had the right to unilaterally determine that a federal statute is unconstitutional. Madison wrote, &quot;But it follows, from no view of the subject, that a nullification of a law of the U. S. can as is now contended, belong rightfully to a single State, as one of the parties to the Constitution; the State not ceasing to avow its adherence to the Constitution. A plainer contradiction in terms, or a more fatal inlet to anarchy, cannot be imagined.&quot; Rather, the interposition contemplated by Madison would be &quot;a concurring and cooperating interposition of the States, not that of a single State.&quot; Madison argued that interposition would involve some sort of joint action among the states, such as amending the Constitution.

==Interposition attempts in the 19th century==

During the 19th century, several states attempted or threatened interposition or nullification. These states often referred to the Virginia Resolution and used the language of interposition, even though they often were attempting or threatening nullification. None of these interposition attempts was legally upheld. The Supreme Court ruled against various interposition and nullification attempts in a series of cases, starting in 1809. The Civil War put an end to most interposition attempts.

==School desegregation==

Several southern states attempted to use interposition in the 1950s after the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which ruled that segregated schools violate the Constitution. Many people in southern states strongly opposed the &quot;Brown&quot; decision. They argued that the &quot;Brown&quot; decision was an unconstitutional infringement on states&#x27; rights, and that the states had the power to prevent that decision from being enforced within their borders. James J. Kilpatrick, an editor of the &quot;Richmond News Leader&quot;, wrote a series of editorials urging &quot;massive resistance&quot; to integration of the schools. Kilpatrick revived the idea of interposition by the states as a constitutional basis for resisting federal government action. At least ten southern states passed interposition or nullification laws in an effort to prevent integration of their schools.

In the case of &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot;, 358 U.S. 1 (1958), the Supreme Court rejected the Arkansas effort to use nullification and interposition. The state of Arkansas passed several laws in an effort to prevent the integration of its schools. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, held that state governments had no power to nullify the &quot;Brown&quot; decision. The Supreme Court held that the &quot;Brown&quot; decision and its implementation &quot;can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial officers nor nullified indirectly by them through evasive schemes for segregation whether attempted &#x27;ingeniously or ingenuously. Thus, &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot; directly held that state attempts to nullify federal law are ineffective.

In a similar case arising from Louisiana&#x27;s interposition act, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of a federal district court that rejected interposition. The district court&#x27;s decision reviewed the theory of interposition and found no basis in the Constitution for interposition. The district court stated: &quot;The conclusion is clear that interposition is not a constitutional doctrine. If taken seriously, it is illegal defiance of constitutional authority. Otherwise, &#x27;it amounted to no more than a protest, an escape valve through which the legislators blew off steam to relieve their tensions.&#x27; ... However solemn or spirited, interposition resolutions have no legal efficacy.&quot;

Interposition and nullification were referenced by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his August 1963 &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom:

I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

==Contemporary debate==

Interposition and nullification have been raised recently in several state legislatures. Some legislators argue that the states should use these theories to declare unconstitutional certain acts of Congress, especially including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Interposition or nullification bills have been introduced in several state legislatures. Opponents respond that interposition is not a valid constitutional doctrine and has been discredited.

<text>Robert Henry Simmonds (April 6, 1926 – January 17, 2023) was a Canadian police officer who served as the 17th commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) from 1977 to 1987.

== Early life and career ==
Robert Henry Simmonds was born on April 6, 1926, in Keatley near Hafford, Saskatchewan. Simmonds grew up on a farm and was educated in a one-room schoolhouse. He joined the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm, served overseas during the last year of the Second World War.

== RCMP career ==
Simmonds joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on April 23, 1947, where he trained at “Depot” Division in Regina. The following year, while touring with the RCMP Musical Ride, he performed highway patrols in Edmonton. He was subsequently posted to “K” Division, serving Edmonton, Innisfail, Three Hills, Wetaskiwin, Hanna and Calgary.

In 1953, Simmonds was part of the Canadian Contingent during the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in England. In 1957, he moved to Calgary Subdivision as a Criminal Investigator. In 1966 he moved to Burnaby, British Columbia as Sub-Inspector, but transferred to Victoria in 1971 to work in the staffing and personnel department. Three years later, he was promoted to Superintendent and charged with commanding the Victoria Subdivision. In 1976, Simmonds was promoted from Chief Superintendent to Deputy Commissioner of Administration in Ottawa. On September 1, 1977, he was appointed Commissioner of the RCMP.

Simmonds was supportive of the organization of a British Columbia Police commission to mediate between police and the public. He felt that the RCMP should conduct themselves in an ethical manner and be accountable to the Government for their actions. In 1984, the RCMP Security Service was replaced by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). Throughout his term in office, Simmonds guided the Force through a time of heavy media scrutiny because of a series of sensational criminal investigations the Government was involved in at the time. He employed great discretion in speaking to the public and the media in order to avoid compromising the cases. Heavily active during his term as Commissioner, Simmonds was named Vice President of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), as well as the Dominion of Canada Rifle Association.

== Post-RCMP career ==
After retiring in 1987, he negotiated peace between warring tribes in South Africa and became the senior law enforcement officer of the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC) in Vienna.

Simmonds died in Ottawa, Ontario on January 17, 2023, at the age of 96.

== Honours ==
Simmonds was awarded the RCMP Long Service Medal in 1967, accompanied by the bronze Clasp in 1972. He received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, appointed Commander of the Order of St. John in 1978, and received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012. He became an Honorary patron of the Parents’ Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE), whose primary goal was the prevention and reduction of drug use among youth. In 1987, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada.

<doc id="1232411" wikidata="Q1077135" url="?curid=1232411" title="Wildlife crossing">
<text>Wildlife crossings are structures that allow animals to cross human-made barriers safely. Wildlife crossings may include underpass tunnels or wildlife tunnels, viaducts, and overpasses or green bridges (mainly for large or herd-type animals); amphibian tunnels; fish ladders; canopy bridges (especially for monkeys and squirrels); tunnels and culverts (for small mammals such as otters, hedgehogs, and badgers); and green roofs (for butterflies and birds).

Wildlife crossings are a practice in habitat conservation, allowing connections or reconnections between habitats, combating habitat fragmentation. They also assist in avoiding collisions between vehicles and animals, which in addition to killing or injuring wildlife may cause injury or death to humans and property damage.

Similar structures can be used for domesticated animals, such as cattle creeps.

== Roads and habitat fragmentation==

Habitat fragmentation occurs when human-made barriers such as roads, railroads, canals, electric power lines, and pipelines penetrate and divide wildlife habitat. Of these, roads have the most widespread and detrimental effects. Scientists estimate that the system of roads in the United States affects the ecology of at least one-fifth of the land area of the country. For many years ecologists and conservationists have documented the adverse relationship between roads and wildlife, and identify four ways that roads and traffic detrimentally affect wildlife populations: (1) they decrease habitat amount and quality, (2) they increase mortality due to wildlife-vehicle collisions (road kill), (3) they prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and (4) they subdivide wildlife populations into smaller and more vulnerable sub-populations (fragmentation). Habitat fragmentation can lead to extinction or extirpation if a population&#x27;s gene pool is restricted enough.

The first three effects (loss of habitat, road kill, and isolation from resources) exert pressure on various animal populations by reducing available resources and directly killing individuals in a population. For instance, found that road kills do not pose a significant threat to healthy populations but can be devastating to small, shrinking, or threatened populations. Road mortality has significantly affected a number of prominent species in the United States, including white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;), Florida panthers (&quot;Puma concolor coryi&quot;), and black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;). In addition, habitat loss can be direct, if habitat is destroyed to make room for a road, or indirect, if habitat quality close to roads is compromised due to emissions from the roads (e.g. noise, light, runoff, pollution, etc.). Finally, species that are unable to migrate across roads to reach resources such as food, shelter and mates will experience reduced reproductive and survival rates, which can compromise population viability.

In addition to the first three factors, numerous studies have shown that the construction and use of roads is a direct source of habitat fragmentation. As mentioned above, populations surrounded by roads are less likely to receive immigrants from other habitats and as a result, they suffer from a lack of genetic diversity. These small populations are particularly vulnerable to extinction due to demographic, genetic, and environmental stochasticity because they do not contain enough alleles to adapt to new selective pressures such as changes in temperature, habitat, and food availability.

The relationship between roads and habitat fragmentation is well documented. One study found that roads contribute more to fragmentation in forest habitats than clear cuts. Another study concluded that road fragmentation of formerly contiguous forest in eastern North America is the primary cause for the decline of forest bird species and has also significantly harmed small mammals, insects, and reptiles in the United States. After years of research, biologists agree that roads and traffic lead to habitat fragmentation, isolation and road kill, all of which combine to significantly compromise the viability of wildlife populations throughout the world.

== Wildlife-vehicle collisions ==

Wildlife-vehicle collisions have a significant cost for human populations because collisions damage property and injure and kill passengers and drivers. Research in the 1990s estimated the number of collisions with ungulates in traffic in Europe at 507,000 per year, resulting in 300 people killed, 30,000 injured, and property damage exceeding $1 billion. In parallel, 1.5 million traffic accidents involving deer in the United States cause an estimated $1.1 billion in vehicle damage each year. On a larger scale, research indicates that wildlife-vehicle collisions in the United States result in 29,000 injuries and more than 200 fatalities per year.

The conservation issues associated with roads (wildlife mortality and habitat fragmentation) coupled with the substantial human and economic costs resulting from wildlife-vehicle collisions have caused scientists, engineers, and transportation authorities to consider a number of mitigation tools for reducing the conflict between roads and wildlife. Of the currently available options, structures known as wildlife crossings have been the most successful at reducing both habitat fragmentation and wildlife-vehicle collisions caused by roads.
Wildlife crossings are structural passages beneath or above roadways that are designed to facilitate safe wildlife movement across roadways. In recent years, conservation biologists and wildlife managers have advocated wildlife crossings coupled with roadside fencing as a way to increase road permeability and habitat connectivity while decreasing wildlife-vehicle collisions. Wildlife crossing is the umbrella term encompassing underpasses, overpasses, ecoducts, green bridges, amphibian/small mammal tunnels, and wildlife viaducts . All of these structures are designed to provide semi-natural corridors above and below roads so that animals can safely cross without endangering themselves and motorists.

==History==
Written reports of rough fish ladders date to 17th-century France, where bundles of branches were used to create steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions. A version was patented in 1837 by Richard McFarlan of Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, who designed a fishway to bypass a dam at his water-powered lumber mill. In 1880, the first fish ladder was built in Rhode Island, United States, on the Pawtuxet Falls Dam. As the Industrial Age advanced, dams and other river obstructions became larger and more common, leading to the need for effective fish by-passes.

The first overland wildlife crossings were constructed in France during the 1950s. European countries including the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, and France have been using various crossing structures to reduce the conflict between wildlife and roads for several decades and use a variety of overpasses and underpasses to protect and re-establish wildlife such as: amphibians, badgers, ungulates, invertebrates, and other small mammals.

The Humane Society of the United States reported in 2007 that the more than 600 tunnels installed under major and minor roads in the Netherlands have helped to substantially increase population levels of the endangered European badger. The longest &quot;ecoduct&quot; overpass, Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo, in the Netherlands, runs and spans a highway, railway and golf course.

Wildlife crossings are becoming increasingly common in Canada and the United States. Recognizable wildlife crossings are found in Banff National Park in Alberta, where vegetated overpasses provide safe passage over the Trans-Canada Highway for bears, moose, deer, wolves, elk, and many other species. The 24 wildlife crossings in Banff were constructed as part of a road improvement project in 1978. In the United States, thousands of wildlife crossings have been built in the past 30 years, including culverts, bridges, and overpasses. These have been used to protect mountain goats in Montana, spotted salamanders in Massachusetts, bighorn sheep in Colorado, desert tortoises in California, and endangered Florida panthers in Florida. The Henry Street salamander tunnels are tunnels under Henry Street in North Amherst, Massachusetts: they help salamanders cross Henry Street to get to vernal pools that the salamanders use for breeding.

The first wildlife crossing in the Canadian province of Ontario was built in 2010, along Ontario Highway 69 between Sudbury and Killarney, as part of the route&#x27;s ongoing freeway conversion.

== Costs and benefits ==
The benefits derived from constructing wildlife crossings to extend wildlife migration corridors over and under major roads appear to outweigh the costs of construction and maintenance. One study estimates that adding wildlife crossings to a road project is a 7–8% increase in the total cost of the project . Theoretically, the monetary costs associated with constructing and maintaining wildlife crossings in ecologically important areas are trumped by the benefits associated with protecting wildlife populations, reducing property damage to vehicles, and saving the lives of drivers and passengers by reducing the number of collisions caused by wildlife.

A study completed for the Virginia Department of Transportation estimated that underpasses for wildlife become cost effective, in terms of property damage, when they prevent between 2.6 and 9.2 deer-vehicle collisions per year, depending on the cost of the underpass. Approximately 300 deer crossed through the underpasses in the year the study took place .

== Effectiveness ==

A number of studies have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of wildlife corridors at providing habitat connectivity (by providing viable migration corridors) and reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions. The effectiveness of these structures appears to be highly site-specific (due to differences in location, structure, species, habitat, etc.) but crossings have been beneficial to a number of species in a variety of locations.

==Examples==
=== Banff National Park ===

Banff National Park offers one of the best opportunities to study the effectiveness of wildlife crossings because the park contains a wide variety of species and is bisected by the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH), a large commercial road. To reduce the effects of the four-lane TCH, 24 wildlife crossings (22 underpasses and two overpasses) were built to ensure habitat connectivity and protect motorists . In 1996, Parks Canada developed a contract with university researchers to assess the effectiveness of the crossings. Subsequently, a number of publications have analyzed the crossings&#x27; effect on various species and overall wildlife mortality (see , , and ).
Using a variety of techniques to monitor the crossings since the early 1980s, scientists report that 10 species of large mammals (including deer, elk, black bear, grizzly bear, mountain lion, wolf, moose, and coyote) have used the 24 crossings in Banff a total of 84,000 times as of January 2007 . The research also identified a &quot;learning curve&quot; such that animals need time to acclimate to the structures before they feel comfortable using them. For example, grizzly bear crossings increased from seven in 1996 to more than 100 in 2006, although the actual number of individual bears using the structures remained constant over this time at between two and four bears (Parks Canada, unpublished results). A similar set of observations was made for wolves, with crossings increasing from two to approximately 140 over the same 10-year period. However, in this case the actual number of wolves in the packs using the crossings increased dramatically, from a low of two up to a high of over 20 individuals.

 reported that the use of wildlife crossings and fencing reduced traffic-induced mortality of large ungulates on the TCH by more than 80 percent. Recent analysis for carnivores showed results were not as positive however, with bear mortality increasing by an average of 116 percent in direct parallel to an equal doubling of traffic volumes on the highway, clearly showing no effect of fencing to reduce bear mortality (Hallstrom, Clevenger, Maher and Whittington, in prep). Research on the crossings in Banff has thus shown mixed value of wildlife crossings depending on the species in question.

Parks Canada is currently planning to build 17 additional crossing structures across the TCH to increase driver safety near the hamlet of Lake Louise. Lack of effectiveness of standard fencing in reducing bear mortality demonstrates that additional measures such as wire &#x27;T-caps&#x27; on the fence may be needed for fencing to mitigate effectively for bears (Hallstrom, Clevenger, Maher and Whittington, in prep).

=== Collier and Lee Counties in Florida ===
Twenty-four wildlife crossings (highway underpasses) and 12 bridges modified for wildlife have been constructed along a 40-mile stretch of Interstate 75 in Collier and Lee Counties in Florida . These crossings are specifically designed to target and protect the endangered Florida panther, a subspecies of cougar found in the Southeastern United States. Scientists estimate that there are only 80–100 Florida panthers alive in the wild, which makes them one of the most endangered large mammals in North America . The Florida panther is particularly vulnerable to wildlife-vehicle collisions, which claimed 11 panthers in 2006 and 14 in 2007 .

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) has used a number of mitigation tools in an effort to protect Florida panthers and the combination of wildlife crossings and fences have proven the most effective . As of 2007, no panthers have been killed in areas equipped with continuous fencing and wildlife crossings and the FWC is planning to construct many more crossing structures in the future. The underpasses on I-75 also appeared to benefit bobcats, deer, and raccoons by significantly reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions along the interstate .

=== Southern California ===
Wildlife crossings have also been important for protecting biodiversity in several areas of southern California. In San Bernardino County, biologists have erected fences along State Route 58 to complement underpasses (culverts) that are being used by the threatened desert tortoise. Tortoise deaths on the highway declined by 93% during the first four years after the introduction of the fences, proving that even makeshift wildlife crossings (storm-drainage culverts in this case) have the ability to increase highway permeability and protect sensitive species . Studies by and report that underpasses in Orange, Riverside, and Los Angeles Counties have drawn significant use from a variety of species including bobcats, coyotes, gray fox, mule deer, and long-tailed weasels. These results could be extremely important for wildlife conservation efforts in the region&#x27;s Puente Hills and Chino Hills links, which have been increasingly fragmented by road construction . Los Angeles County&#x27;s first wildlife-purpose built underpass is at Harbor Boulevard. It was built in partnership between Los Angeles County, California State Parks and the Puente Hills Habitat Preservation Authority.

Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, also known as Liberty Canyon Wildlife Crossing, in Agoura Hills, California, will be one of the largest overpasses in the United States after its stated completion in 2024.

=== Ecoducts, Netherlands ===

The Netherlands has over 66 wildlife crossings (overpasses and ecoducts) that have been used to protect the endangered European badger, as well as populations of wild boar, red deer, and roe deer. As of 2012, the Veluwe, of woods, heathland and drifting sands, the largest lowland nature area in North Western Europe, contains nine ecoducts, wide on average, that are used to shuttle wildlife across highways that transect the Veluwe. The first two ecoducts on the Veluwe were built in 1988 across the A50 when the highway was constructed. Five of the other ecoducts on the Veluwe were built across existing highways, one was built across a two lane provincial road. The two ecoducts across the A50 were used by nearly 5,000 deer and wild boar during a one-year period .

The Netherlands also boasts the world&#x27;s longest ecoduct-wildlife overpass called the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo (sand quarry nature bridge at Crailo) . The massive structure, completed in 2006, is wide and over long and spans a railway line, business park, roadway, and sports complex . Monitoring is currently underway to examine the effectiveness of this innovative project combining wildlife protection with urban development. The oldest wildlife passage is Zeist West - A 28, opened in 1988.

=== Slaty Creek Wildlife Underpass, Calder Freeway, Black Forest, Australia ===
Another case study of the effectiveness of wildlife crossings comes from an underpass built to minimize the ecological effect of the Calder Freeway as it travels through the Black Forest in Victoria, Australia. In 1997, the Victorian Government Roads Corporation built Slaty Creek wildlife underpass at a cost of $3 million . Scientists used 14 different techniques to monitor the underpass for 12 months in order to determine the abundance and diversity of species using the underpass . During the 12-month period, 79 species of fauna were detected in the underpass (compared with 116 species detected in the surrounding forest) including amphibians, bats, birds, koalas, wombats, gliders, reptiles, and kangaroos . The results indicate that the underpass could be useful to a wide array of species but the authors suggest that Slaty Creek could be improved by enhanced design and maintenance of fencing to minimise road kill along the Calder Freeway and by attempting to exclude introduced predators such as cats and foxes from the area.

===I-70 Vail Pass, Colorado===
In 2005, area environmental groups floated the idea of a wildlife overpass west of Vail Pass. In 2010, ARC Solutions – an interdisciplinary partnership – initiated the International Wildlife Crossing Infrastructure Design Competition for a wildlife crossing over Interstate 70 in the high country west of Denver, Colorado; designers had to account for challenges unique to the area, including snow and severe weather, high elevation and steep grades, a six-lane roadway, a bike path, and high traffic volumes, as well as multiple species of wildlife, including lynx.

After receiving 36 submissions from nine countries, a jury of international experts in landscape architecture, engineering, architecture, ecology and transportation selected five finalists in November 2010 to further develop their conceptual designs for a wildlife crossing structure. In January 2011, the team led by HNTB with Michael Van Valkenburgh &amp; Associates (New York) were selected as the winners. The design features a single 100 m (328 ft) concrete span across the highway that is planted with a variety of vegetation types, including a pine-tree forest and meadow grasses, to attract different species to cross. A modular precast concrete design means that much of the bridge can be constructed offsite and moved into place.

In late 2020, Summit County Safe Passages released the &quot;I-70 East Vail Pass Wildlife Crossings Feasibility Study&quot; for a wildlife overpass.

=== I-90 near Snoqualmie Pass ===
In 2005, the Washington State Department of Transportation received approval to begin a safety improvement project through the Snoqualmie Pass area along the Interstate 90 corridor from Hyak to Easton, through the Central Cascades and Mountains to Sound Greenway National Heritage Area, including a series of wildlife crossings. Wildlife habitat on either side of I-90 will be reconnected with the installation of new bridges and culverts, protecting both wildlife and the traveling public. The construction of the wildlife overcrossing began in 2015 and was completed in late 2019. Work to restore habitat on the wildlife bridge over I-90 has continued throughout 2020, with 90,000 trees and shrubs planted on the overcrossing.

=== Interstate 80 in Parleys Canyon ===
In 2018, the Utah Department of Transportation announced a wildlife crossing over Interstate 80 in Parleys Canyon. The project was completed in early 2019 and measures long by wide. It is currently the only wildlife overpass in the state, though Utah has more than 50 wildlife underpasses.

=== Robert L.B. Tobin Land Bridge ===

On December 11, 2020, the Robert L.B. Tobin Land Bridge opened over Wurzbach Parkway in San Antonio, Texas&#x27; Phil Hardberger Park. The project cost $23 million and is designed for both wildlife and pedestrians. Construction began on November 26, 2018, originally expected to end in April 2020, and opened in December 2020. At long and wide, it was the largest wildlife bridge in the United States when it was constructed.

=== Canopy Bridge in Anamalai Tiger Reserve ===
Many endangered lion-tailed macaques used to be killed while crossing the highway at Puduthotam in Valparai, South India. Thanks to the efforts of NGOs and the forest department, several canopy bridges were installed, connecting trees on either side of the road. This helped to lower the numbers of lion-tailed macaques killed in the region. The Environment Conservation Group had initiated a national mission to increase awareness on the importance of adopting roadkill mitigation methods through their mission PATH traveling more than across 22 states.

<text>A table cell is one grouping within a chart table used for storing information or data. Cells are grouped horizontally (rows of cells) and vertically (columns of cells). Each cell contains information relating to the combination of the row and column headings it is collinear with.

<text>In statistics, the weighted geometric mean is a generalization of the geometric mean using the weighted arithmetic mean.

Given a sample formula_1 and weights formula_2, it is calculated as:

:formula_3

The second form above illustrates that the logarithm of the geometric mean is the weighted arithmetic mean of the logarithms of the individual values.
If all the weights are equal, the weighted geometric mean simplifies to the ordinary unweighted geometric mean.

<doc id="1232430" wikidata="Q3544161" url="?curid=1232430" title="USS Spot">
<text>USS &quot;Spot&quot; (SS-413) was a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy, named for the spot, a small sciaenoid food fish of the Atlantic coast, with a black spot behind its shoulders.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Spot&quot; was laid down on 24 August 1943 by the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California. She was launched on 19 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. A. A. Gieselmann, and commissioned on 3 August 1944, Commander William S. Post, Jr., in command.

==U.S. Navy service==

=== September–November 1944 ===

&quot;Spot&quot; completed fitting out at Mare Island on 18 September 1944 and moved to San Diego for shakedown. After a yard period, &quot;Spot&quot; departed for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 14 November 1944.

=== First patrol, December 1944 – January 1945 ===

Accompanied by , &quot;Spot&quot; got underway for the Marianas on 4 December. They were joined by en route, and the trio arrived at Saipan on 15 December 1944.

Two days later, the hunter-killer group headed for the Yellow Sea. On 7 January 1945, &quot;Spot&quot; sank two small trawlers with her deck gun. Four days later, she destroyed a small freighter by gunfire. On 13 January off Shanghai, the submarine sank two trawlers by shellfire, and she repeated the feat the next day. In a night sweep through the Elliott Islands on 18 and 19 January, &quot;Spot&quot; torpedoed a cargo ship and a tanker.

As &quot;Spot&quot; came down the west coast of Korea, she sighted a small ship and fired her last three torpedoes. All ran shallow and missed. With only 1,300 rounds of 20 mm ammunition remaining, the submarine closed to and opened fire. The enemy made an unsuccessful attempt to ram. No one manned the Japanese ship&#x27;s machine gun atop her pilot house; her top deck was in shambles; and the ship was dead in the water but not sinking.

&quot;Spot&quot; waited for an hour and then sent over a boarding party of seven men to plant demolition charges and search for intelligence material. After about ten minutes on board, the party had to abandon as the ship listed to port and sank by the stern. The boarding party was recovered and one Japanese prisoner taken. The submarine returned to Midway on 30 January for a refit and training period.

=== Second war patrol, February – March 1945 ===

On 24 February, &quot;Spot&quot; began her second war patrol which took her, , and into the East China Sea. On the second night in her assigned patrol area, &quot;Spot&quot; expended all torpedoes attacking a Japanese convoy. They sank the passenger-cargo ship, &quot;Nanking Maru&quot;, and damaged a freighter. The attack was made in heavy weather and shallow water. &quot;Spot&quot; was surfaced and heading for deeper water but could not elude one of the escorts, the minesweeper &quot;W-17&quot;, which closed to and opened fire. &quot;Spot&quot; manned her guns and returned the fire even though she was wallowing heavily in the rough seas. A lucky hit by her gun knocked out &quot;W-17&quot;&#x27;s forward gun and saved the submarine from almost certain disaster. &quot;Spot&quot; secured her guns, cleared the bridge, and submerged. The escort dropped a few depth charge patterns which caused no damage, and the submarine returned to Saipan on 23 March to reload.

On 27 March 1945, &quot;Spot&quot; resumed her patrol. On 31 March 1945, she was on the surface in the Philippine Sea southeast of Kagoshima, Kyushu, Japan at when she sighted a destroyer that offered no recognition signals. &quot;Spot&quot; maneuvered to close when the destroyer turned towards her and increased its speed. When the range was approximately , the destroyer opened fire. &quot;Spot&quot; fired a recognition flare that the destroyer answered with a second salvo. As &quot;Spot&quot; submerged, another salvo straddled her conning tower. After &quot;Spot&quot; reached a depth of , she and the destroyer exchanged recognition signals and the destrover discontinued its attack. The destroyer was later identified as , which reported firing fifteen rounds. &quot;Spot&quot; suffered no damage or casualties in this friendly fire incident.

=== Third and fourth war patrols, April – July 1945 ===

During the first week of April, &quot;Spot&quot; guarded the approaches to Kii Suido. After aircraft from the Fast Carrier Task Force sank battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, a cruiser, and four destroyers in the East China Sea on 7 April, the submarine patrolled in that area. She hunted off the China coast and then conducted a reconnaissance of Kokuzan To, off Korea and decided to shell a radio station on the northwest tip of the island. On the evening of 25 April, she surfaced and began the bombardment which hit an oil storage area, several barracks, and set the radio station on fire. &quot;Spot&quot; returned to the Mariana Islands on 4 May for refit.

&quot;Spot&quot; began her last war patrol on 2 June and performed lifeguard services off the coast of Honshū until 23 June. She then patrolled in the East China and Yellow Seas, sinking two junks by gunfire before returning to Saipan on 18 July. The submarine sailed for Hawaii the next day.

&quot;Spot&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 29 July for an extended overhaul and was still there when hostilities ceased. She sailed for San Diego on 27 August and provided services for antisubmarine warfare units there from 3 September 1945 to 2 March 1946. The ship then sailed to San Francisco to prepare for inactivation. She was decommissioned at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 19 June and attached to the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

=== Honors and awards ===
&quot;Spot&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service.

== Chilean Navy service ==
In January 1961, &quot;Spot&quot; was towed to Pearl Harbor for modernization in preparation for transfer to the Chilean Navy. A streamlined sail was added but, unusually for a post-World War II submarine, her deck gun was retained.

The Chilean crew reported aboard later in 1961 for training, and on 12 January 1962, &quot;Spot&quot; was loaned to that government under the Military Assistance Loan Program. She was renamed &quot;Simpson&quot; (SS-21), in honor of Chilean admiral Robert Winthrop Simpson (1799–1877). The submarine arrived in Chile on 23 April 1962.

On 1 August 1975 the submarine was sold outright to Chile, and struck from the US Navy Directory. In 1980, &quot;Simpson&quot; was used extensively by director Kinji Fukasaku in the disaster film &quot;Fukkatsu no hi&quot; (titled in English&quot;Virus&quot; and &quot;Day of Resurrection&quot;). The film features spectacular footage of &quot;Simpson&quot; operating in the Antarctic.

&quot;Simpson&quot; was significant for being one of the last submarines to have a deck gun; she was disposed of by the Chilean Navy in 1982.

<text>Stanley Praimnath (born October 27, 1956) is a survivor of the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. He worked as an executive for Fuji Bank on the 81st floor of the South Tower (WTC 2), the second tower struck that day. He was one of only 18 survivors from within or above the impact zone of United Airlines Flight 175.

== September 11, 2001 ==

When American Airlines Flight 11 struck the North Tower, Praimnath started to evacuate from his 81st floor office in the South Tower, but he returned when the security guards of the building said the South Tower was secure, and workers should return to their offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;9/11 Tribute Museum&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst making a phone call from his office, he looked out of the south side of the building and spotted United Airlines Flight 175 flying towards him. Praimnath froze up as the aircraft approached, unable to decide what to do, but at the last moment he dived under his desk just as the plane crashed into the building. The left wing sliced through his office and became lodged in a door from him.
Praimnath was bruised and exhausted, and covered in debris after the crash, which left him stuck and unable to escape on his own.

While Praimnath called for help, Euro Brokers executive Brian Clark, from the 84th floor, and a group of his coworkers were debating in the stairwell whether to descend through the impact zone using the stairwell, which they had been told was impassable, or to climb to the roof. Clark heard Praimnath&#x27;s cries for help, and made his way to him by using his flashlight and following his voice. As Clark was on his way to find Praimnath, he looked back towards his coworkers and saw they had decided to climb up the stairs instead of going down. Because of the decision to ascend the stairs, all of Clark&#x27;s coworkers were killed, except for one, Ron DiFrancesco, who reversed course.

Once Clark had found Praimnath, the two men made their way to the stairwell, which Clark had already been told was blocked further down. However, Clark and Praimnath wanted to see for themselves if the stairs were really impassable. They descended the stairs, and while there was debris in some spots, the two men were able to get through it and continue down the stairs and out of the building. They were two of only eighteen survivors from at or above the impact zone in the South Tower. After the two men had made it outside and walked two blocks away from the South Tower, they stopped and looked back at the building they had just exited, and Praimnath said to Clark, &quot;You know, I think that building can come down.&quot; Clark was in the midst of replying, &quot;Those are steel structures, there&#x27;s no way—&quot;, when he was cut off by the South Tower starting to collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;9/11StoryClark&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As the dust cloud from the collapsing South Tower approached them, they ran south and entered 42 Broadway as the wave caught up to them. Inside that lobby they exchanged business cards. Clark made his way home to New Jersey; Praimnath went to the hospital for his injuries. Later on that evening, after midnight, when Praimnath had finally gotten home from the hospital, he called Clark to find out what had happened to him. The two men, who had never met before 9/11, remain friends and have appeared on numerous shows and documentaries telling their story.

== In popular culture ==
Praimnath&#x27;s and others&#x27; stories were told on the 2006 BBC docudrama &quot;9/11: The Twin Towers&quot;. His story was also chronicled in the documentaries &quot;United by 9/11&quot; (2006) and &quot;9/11: One Day in America&quot; (2021).

<doc id="1232455" wikidata="Q2668249" url="?curid=1232455" title="Tom Waring">
<text>Thomas Waring (12 October 1906 – 20 December 1980) was an English professional association footballer. Nicknamed &quot;Pongo&quot; after a famous cartoon of the time called Pongo the Pup, Waring is one of Aston Villa&#x27;s all-time great centre forwards. In his career, he scored 243 league goals in 363 matches over 12 seasons for 5 different clubs.

== Early life ==
Thomas Waring was born on 12 October 1906 at 4 Chapel Place in Higher Tranmere. He was the third child (out of 4) of Henry Arthur and Charlotte Waring. The Waring family lived at 15 Walker Place, which was a ten-minute walk from Tranmere Rovers&#x27; ground.

==Career==
Tom played for quite a few junior teams in the Tranmere area before catching the eye of the legendary Rovers scout Jack Lee. Lee offered Waring a place in the Tranmere reserves and a casual job helping out on matchdays. Tom would sell cigarettes and chocolate to the fans in the stands as well as help in preparing the ground for matches before he was handed a professional contract. He signed for Tranmere in 1926 at the relatively late age of 20 and made his debut on August 29, 1927 away to Rotherham United. He scored 23 goals in 24 games, including 6 goals in an 11–1 victory against Durham City in January 1928 which brought him to the attention of First Division clubs. He moved to Aston Villa for £4,700 in 1928.

===Aston Villa===
A crowd of 23,000 saw him play on his Villa debut in a reserve game against local rivals Birmingham City, in which he scored a first half hat-trick.

His 226 appearances for Villa yielded 167 goals, including 10 hat-tricks and a club record 49 league goals in the 1930–31 season, 50 goals in all competitions. He is considered an Aston Villa legend, a reputation buoyed by his likeable personality as discussed by Villa&#x27;s captain of the day, Billy Walker. In Walker&#x27;s autobiography, he wrote:

The Birmingham Daily Gazette described Pongo in his heyday at Villa: 

During the time of Eric Cantona&#x27;s altercation with a fan, an Olton pensioner stated that Waring - &quot;Picked the ball up then he jumped into the crowd and gave him a thump&quot;

Whilst playing football, Waring also worked for The Hercules Motor and Cycle Company in Aston.

===Later clubs===
In November 1935, Waring went to Barnsley, angering many Villa fans and prompting 5,000 of them to call for his return to the club. After a spell at Barnsley, Waring also played for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Tranmere Rovers (for a second time), Accrington Stanley, Bath City, Ellesmere Port Town, Graysons, Birkenhead Docks and Harrowby. He guested for New Brighton in 1939–40, and after the war he returned for a second spell with Ellesmere Port Town.

==International career==
Waring was also capped five times by England, scoring four goals between 1931 and 1932.

==Death==
Waring died in December 1980 at the age of 74. His ashes were scattered in the Holte End goal mouth before a game against Stoke City.

<doc id="1232467" wikidata="Q5397426" url="?curid=1232467" title="Escribitionist">
<text>An escribitionist is a person who keeps a diary or journal via electronic means, and in particular, publishes their entries on the World Wide Web. The word was coined in June 1999 by Erin Venema, an online diarist, in the course of a discussion on a mailing list for web journalers. At issue was how to distinguish web journal authors from keepers of traditional paper-and-ink diaries.

The word comes from a combination of the English word &quot;exhibitionist&quot; and the Spanish word &quot;escribir&quot;, meaning &quot;to write&quot;. (The latter is cognate to the English &quot;scribe&quot;; both come from the Latin &quot;scribere&quot;.) It also evokes the marketing gimmick of using the letter &quot;e&quot; as a prefix to imply a link to technology and electronics, although that was not intended.

Coined before the widespread use of weblogs, the word escribitionist is often used to distinguish diary keepers on the web from weblog authors, whose writing often involve far more diverse styles, perspectives and subjects than those used in personal journals. While a weblog author may engage in journaling, or reporting, or political commentary, an escribitionist is focused on personal experiences and reflection.

<doc id="1232469" wikidata="Q108908310" url="?curid=1232469" title="Ainaro">
<text>Ainaro is a town in East Timor, the capital of the Ainaro suco, the Ainaro administrative post and the Ainaro Municipality, and is located in the southwest part of the country. The town of Ainaro is located 78 km south of Dili, the national capital.

==Destruction of Ainaro==
During the Indonesian occupation from 1975 to 1999, Ainaro was home to a large contingent of Indonesian military (TNI)-backed pro-Indonesia militias in the months leading up to the 30 August 1999 referendum on independence. As a result, it suffered near-total devastation during the TNI orchestrated scorched earth operation with more than 95 percent of its buildings destroyed.

==Climate==
Ainaro&#x27;s climate lies on the border between a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;) and a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;). Compared to Dili, Ainaro receives about two-and-a-half times more annual rainfall because it lies on the windward side of the southeastern trade winds, which especially during the first half of Dili&#x27;s dry season give moisture to the southeastern side of Timor whilst the northern side is dry.

<text>The Reichmann family is a Jewish-Canadian family best known for their property empire built through the Olympia and York company.

At the family&#x27;s peak, their combined wealth was estimated at $13 billion making them the fourth-richest family in the world. The family&#x27;s fortunes eventually waned, particularly with the ill-fated Canary Wharf development, which saw the family business file for bankruptcy in 1992 with debts of $20 billion. The family&#x27;s wealth partially recovered, reaching roughly $2.3 billion in 2018.

== History ==
The Reichman(n)s were originally from the small town of Beled, Hungary, but the ambitious Samuel Reichmann moved the family to Vienna, Austria, in 1928 where he became a successful merchant. He and his wife Renée had six children:
* Eva Reichmann (married name Heller; 1923–1984)
* Edward Reichmann (1925–2005)
* Louis Reichmann (1927–2005)
* Albert Reichmann (1929–2022)
* Paul Reichmann (1930–2013)
* Ralph Reichmann (b. 1933)
* Ezriel Reichmann (b.1938)

During the Second World War, the family fled first to Paris, France, and then to the neutral city of Tangier, Morocco, in the 1950s. There, Samuel became a prominent business leader specializing in the currency trade. Renée became a renowned humanitarian aiding victims of the Holocaust, arranging food parcels to be delivered through the Spanish Red Cross to concentration camps such as Theresienstadt and Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Despite the financial success of life in Tangier the family left to avoid the turbulence of Moroccan independence from the French protectorate. Eva settled in London while Edward went to Montreal. There, in 1955, he founded Olympia Flooring and Tile Company to import tiles from Europe. Edward described Montreal fondly, with its large Jewish population and opportunity for profits; soon the rest of the family followed him to Canada in 1956.

Louis joined Edward in Montreal while Albert, Paul, and Ralph settled in Toronto, where they first expanded Edward&#x27;s tile business but then moved into construction and property development. Samuel was the leader of this business that became known as York Developments. Albert and Paul played a secondary but central role, while Ralph remained in charge of the tile business. In the late 1960s, Edward&#x27;s Montreal business was faltering and on the verge of collapse. He was only saved from ruin by a bail-out from his younger brothers in Toronto. Embarrassed at this turn of events Edward left Canada for Israel.

In 1969, the family incorporated Olympia &amp; York (O&amp;Y), a privately-held real-estate company entirely controlled by the family; in 1976, the company began operations in the US.

Over time, through successful projects in Toronto and New York, O&amp;Y became the largest property development and management firm in the world in the 1980s, and the Reichmanns one of the world&#x27;s richest families. (At the family&#x27;s peak, their combined wealth was estimated at $13bn, making them the fourth-richest family on the planet.) Holdings of O&amp;Y included First Canadian Place, the World Financial Centre in Manhattan, and Canary Wharf in London. In 1980, they bought English Property Corp, one of the largest British developers. In 1981, they bought Abitibi-Price Inc, the world&#x27;s largest newspaper producer, for $502 million; and in 1985, they acquired the majority interest in Gulf Canada Resources, in the second-largest takeover in Canadian history.

Throughout this time, the family remained strongly committed to their Haredi Judaism.

In the early 1990s, the business empire and family&#x27;s fortune was brought low by the Canary Wharf project in London. In 1987, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who had seen the transformation of the World Financial Centre, enlisted Paul to transform the docklands of Canary Wharf into a financial powerhouse. This project proved catastrophic, as banks were reluctant to move three miles east of the City of London. By 1992, O&amp;Y declared bankruptcy in the biggest corporate failure of all time—with debts of $20bn—and the Reichmann fortune was greatly reduced.

In 1997, Albert&#x27;s son Philip Reichmann and Paul’s son-in-law Frank Hauer relaunched the company as &quot;O&amp;Y Properties Inc.&quot; and bought back First Canadian Place. Reichmann and Hauer sold their company in 2005. Since then, the family has continued to be involved in tiles and stone, retirement care, and real-estate development deals around the world.

<text>Dionysis Savvopoulos () (born 2 December 1944) is a prominent Greek singer-songwriter.

==Career==
Savvopoulos was born in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece (December 1944) in a middle-class family. He passed his university entrance exams and enrolled in the Aristotle University to study law, but after his first year of his studies, his passion for music and politics led to an argument with his father and he dropped out in 1963. Savvopoulos then hitchhiked on a truck to Athens and took various odd jobs, including working as a nude model for students in the Athens School for Fine Arts and as a journalist in a newspaper. In Athens, he began singing and playing guitar in various night clubs and became closely associated with the so-called Greek New Wave. Although Savvopoulos was not famed for his voice, his talent in songwriting impressed Alekos Patsifas, the director of the LYRA record company in Greece which was specializing in artists of the Greek New Wave, who signed him. Savvopoulos remained with this label until 1983.

Savvopoulos debut album &quot;To Fortigho&quot; (&quot;The truck&quot; alluding to his hitchhiking experience) came out in 1966. Although critically well-received, it failed to chart, allegedly selling only 3,000 copies. Despite this, he was kept on the label&#x27;s roster and continued with a string of highly successful albums, with self-penned songs combining arrangements reminiscent of early Frank Zappa and politically incisive lyrics in the style of Bob Dylan, with folk tunes from Macedonia, Thrace, and Rebetiko music. 

Savvopoulos has been noted for being politically active throughout his career in music. In 1967, Savvopoulos was briefly imprisoned and beaten for his political convictions by the Greek military junta of 1967-1974, led by the dictator George Papadopoulos.

Most of his songs are written by himself (both lyrics and music). He is still singing but no longer composing (since his last studio album as a songwriter, &quot;O chronopios&quot;). Throughout his career, he has sung Greek rock, Laïko (Greek folk music) and Rebetika.

==Personal life==
He is married to Aspasia Arapidou. They have two sons, Kornilios and Romanos, and two grandsons, Dionisis and Andreas.

<doc id="1232493" wikidata="Q234918" url="?curid=1232493" title="Maria Farantouri">
<text>Maria Farantouri or Farandouri (; born 28 November 1947 in Athens) is a Greek singer and also a political and cultural activist. She has collaborated with Greek composers such as Mikis Theodorakis, who wrote the score for Pablo Neruda&#x27;s &quot;Canto General&quot;, which Farantouri performed worldwide.

During the Greek military junta of 1967–1974, Maria Farantouri recorded protest songs in Europe with Mikis Theodorakis. In 1971, she recorded &quot;Songs and Guitar Pieces by Theodorakis&quot; with Australian guitarist John Williams which included seven poems by Federico García Lorca. She has recorded songs in Spanish (&#x27;Hasta Siempre Comandante Che Guevara&#x27;), Italian, and English (&quot;Joe Hill&quot; and Elisabeth Hauptmann&#x27;s &quot;Alabama Song&quot; from Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot;), George Gershwin&#x27;s works, as well as works by Greek composers Manos Hatzidakis, Eleni Karaindrou and Vangelis.

Her voice is contralto with two octaves. The international press called her a people&#x27;s Callas (The Daily Telegraph), and the Joan Baez of the Mediterranean (Le Monde).
Maria Farantouri was an elected member of the Greek Parliament from 1989 to 1993 representing the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). She is married to the poet and former politician Tilemachos Chytiris.

On 23 September 2004, the President of the Hellenic Republic recognized the contribution of Maria Farantouri to Greek song, awarding her the Gold Cross of the Order of the Phoenix. She was awarded the &quot;Premio Tenco&quot; Italian Award 2014 for her contribution to international contemporary and traditional music, and the Spanish LiberPress 2017.

<doc id="1232494" wikidata="Q5010706" url="?curid=1232494" title="CFIQ">
<text>CFIQ (640 AM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Richmond Hill, Ontario, and serving Greater Toronto, Southern Ontario and Western New York with a talk format known as &quot;640 Toronto&quot;. Owned by Corus Entertainment, CFIQ&#x27;s studios are located at the Corus Quay Building in Toronto; despite the station&#x27;s city of licence being a suburban community north of the city, the transmitter is located in the Niagara Region town of Lincoln, southwest of Toronto.

==History==
===Early years===
On July 1, 1957, the station first signed on as CJRH. It was a 500-watt station, broadcasting on 1300 kHz. The last two letters in the call sign referred to its city of licence, Richmond Hill. It moved to 1310 in 1959, and changed its call letters to CFGM in 1961. The station adopted a country format in 1964. A few years later, it became Canada&#x27;s first 24-hour country station. Don Daynard, who went on to become a longtime personality on CKFM and CHFI-FM, was a host on CFGM in the 1960s.

The station moved to 1320 in 1978, and to 640 kHz on September 16, 1988.

===Top 40 era===

After 26 years as a country station, CFGM changed its format and call letters at 5 p.m. on June 29, 1990, broadcasting a rock-leaning Top 40/CHR format as &quot;AM 640 The Hog&quot;, CHOG (which would later shift towards a more mainstream direction in September 1991). By early 1992, the station rebranded as &quot;AM 640 The Beat Of Toronto&quot;, and adjusted its format to Rhythmic CHR.

Several notable radio personalities were associated with the station during this era, including John Gallagher, &quot;Tarzan Dan&quot; Freeman, Pat Cochrane, Adrian Bell, Tony Monaco, Deanna Nason, Randy Taylor, Eric Hollo, Kenny &#x27;The Hitman&#x27; Caughlin, Roger Kelly and the Toronto radio team of Jesse and Gene. After CFTR changed formats from contemporary hits to all-news in 1993, CHOG was the last Top 40 station in the Toronto radio market until CISS-FM adopted the format in February 1999. Talk shows would later come to take up a substantial part of the station&#x27;s schedule, particularly during midday periods when many of the station&#x27;s hit music listeners might normally be in school.

===Shift to Talk===

On October 10, 1995, at 10 p.m., the station changed to a full-time talk format. As &quot;Talk 640&quot;, the station aired syndicated shows such as Joy Browne, Rhona Raskin, Dr. Laura and Live Audio Wrestling, along with local programming hosted by personalities such as Gene Valaitis, Jane Hawtin, Bill Carroll, Shelley Klinck, Marsha Lederman, Karen Horsman, Michael Coren, Dave Chalk, Spaceman Gary Bell and Roger Kelly.

Despite regular adjustments, including acquiring the radio broadcast rights to the Toronto Maple Leafs, the station received low ratings. During this period, the station adopted the call letters CFYI. The weekend programming was a hit with &quot;The Touch of Health&quot; a show that started with just a half hour in 1997 to a two-hour nationally syndicated show airing 2 to 4 p.m. Saturdays. Hosted, produced and managed by Christine McPhee, other weekend shows were the &quot;Pet Show&quot; with Mitch Levitsky, a &quot;Cruise Show&quot;, a &quot;Law Show&quot;, a &quot;Beauty Show&quot;, and the &quot;Small Canada Business Show&quot;.

=== Mojo Radio ===

In 2000, the station was acquired by Corus Entertainment. On April 23, 2001, at 6:40 a.m., the station re-launched as &quot;Mojo Radio&quot;, a hot talk radio format aimed at the male demographic. The station also changed its call letters the same day to CFMJ.

The new format featured programs hosted by Humble and Fred, John Derringer, Phil Hendrie, Mike Stafford, Andrew Krystal, Spider Jones, and the syndicated &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;. Later on, John Oakley replaced Scruff Connors, who had taken over from Humble and Fred; the latter pair left for hot adult contemporary station CKFM-FM in July 2003. Krystal moved to part-time work at CFRB and CKTB before moving to CJNI-FM in Halifax. Derringer&#x27;s Mojo show was later discontinued as he concentrated on his marquee morning show on co-owned CILQ-FM.

=== AM640 Toronto Radio ===
In 2004, due to low ratings (MOJO was typically hovering around a 1.4 share), the station moved away from the male-oriented imaging to a more general news and talk format as &quot;AM640 Toronto Radio&quot;. Oakley and Stafford continued to host the major morning and afternoon drive programs. Former police union head Craig Bromell joined the station as co-host of a new late morning program, &quot;The Beat&quot; (later rebranded as &quot;Bromell!&quot; in 2006), and in 2005, Charles Adler&#x27;s nationally syndicated radio show was added to mid-afternoons. Award-winning journalist Arlene Bynon was added to the ranks in 2006 to host the Saturday afternoon &quot;Toronto Weekend&quot; program, which expanded to include a Sunday edition as well.

Near the end of July 2007, the programming line-up was shuffled in response to the departure of Craig Bromell, whose show ran until the end of August 2007. Afternoon host Mike Stafford replaced &quot;Bromell&quot;. &quot;The Bill Watters Show&quot; was added to the afternoon lineup. Just as the new show with co-host Jeff Marek expanded, Marek moved on to Sirius Satellite Radio. Greg Brady replaced Marek as Bill&#x27;s co-host. Brady left AM640 in late June 2010 to host a Noon - 3pm program on The FAN 590. Bill Hayes, formerly of Q107, replaced Greg Brady as Watters&#x27; co-host. Hayes was fired in January 2011. Co-hosting duties then fell to his son, Bryan Hayes. Hayes left AM640 on Friday, April 8 to host his own mid-morning program on TSN Radio 1050. AM640&#x27;s Leafs play-by-play colour analyst Jim Ralph became co-host of The Bill Watters Show, which ran from 4pm – 7pm covering hockey issues and other major sports news as well, up until July 15, 2011.

Veteran host and reporter John Downs was let go in early August, 2010. His 7pm - 9pm slot was then hosted by Bryan Hayes, whose program was primarily sports-talk, until April 12, 2011 when Bryan took the mid-day host slot at TSN Radio 1050. Charles Adler&#x27;s 2pm - 4pm program was moved to the 7pm - 9pm slot at the end of August 2012.

Charles Adler hosted a Toronto-based hour from 1pm - 2pm during the summer of 2010. On August 30, 2010, Arlene Bynon took over hosting duties for the 1pm - 2pm hour, with news anchor Tina Trigiani guest-hosting Friday afternoons. On July 18, 2011, &quot;The Bill Watters Show&quot; was canceled and Arlene Bynon took over the 4-7pm time slot. Tina Trigiani was the host of the 1-2p slot Monday to Friday. On July 2, 2014, Trijiani&#x27;s hour was taken over by host Jeff McArthur.

Jeff McArthur, former morning show host for both CFPL-FM and AM in London, Ontario, joined AM640 in late August 2012 to host weekdays 2pm - 4pm. On July 2, 2014, his show was expanded to add the 1-2pm time slot.

On January 7, 2013, Arlene Bynon&#x27;s afternoon program was replaced by Bill Carroll. Arlene stayed on as cohost for the following three weeks. Her last day was January 29. She now hosts a show on &quot;Canada Talks&quot; Channel 167 on Sirius XM Radio. Bill Carroll hosted the 4-7pm weekday slot in Toronto in addition to his a separate show on Los Angeles talk radio station KFI (which is also at 640 on the AM dial)

One of the station&#x27;s biggest draws was that it was the radio broadcaster of the Toronto Maple Leafs, which it networked into other markets. Its play-by-play announcers were Joe Bowen, Dennis Beyak, Jim Ralph and Dan Dunleavy. Dennis Beyak left in the fall of 2011 to do the play-by-play for the Winnipeg Jets on TSN regional television and on TSN Radio 1290 CFRW. AM640&#x27;s 7-year contract for the rights to Toronto Maple Leafs radio broadcasts concluded before the start of the 2012-13 NHL seasonLeafs broadcasts are now split between CHUM and CJCL.

CFMJ&#x27;s studios were in Suite 1600 at 1 Dundas Street West in Toronto, until Corus moved all of its Toronto-based radio, television and other assets into Corus Quay upon its completion in the summer of 2010. On September 8, 2015, CFMJ began simulcasting on co-owned CING-FM&#x27;s HD-2 sub-channel.

===Global News Radio 640 Toronto===

CFMJ, along with several other Corus&#x27;s news/talk radio stations across Canada were relaunched under the new national &quot;Global News Radio&quot; brand between November and December 2017. The new moniker matches the Global News brand which is already used for the newscasts on Global Television&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations, including CFMJ&#x27;s sister station, CIII-DT, which was acquired by Corus Entertainment as part of its acquisition of the Shaw Communications media unit. The official changeover to &quot;Global News Radio 640 Toronto&quot; occurred on December 1, 2017, with CFMJ maintaining its talk format and on-air roster.

===640 Toronto===
The &quot;Global News Radio&quot; branding was dropped in January 2022 to avoid confusion between news and talk programming on the station. The station continues to have a shared newsroom with Global News and the newscasts themselves are still identified as Global News. The change occurred one month after Amanda Cupido was hired as the station&#x27;s program director.

On May 1, 2022, the station&#x27;s call sign was changed to CFIQ. The weekday talk show lineup included Greg Brady hosting &quot;Toronto Today&quot; in the morning drive slot followed by Kelly Cutrara, Alan Carter, Jeff McArthur, John Oakley, Alex Pierson and Ben O&#x27;Hara-Byrne, with Shane Hewitt in the overnight slot.

Effective August 8, 2022, Carter and McArthur discontinued their shows in order to focus on their duties at Global Television. Cutrata moved to early afternoons and Pierson moved from evenings to the 9 am to noon slot, following Greg Brady.

In August 2023, Amanda Cupido was replaced as program director by Mike Bendixen, who also became Corus&#x27; national director of talk programming. Bendixen had previously been program director at rival talk station CFRB for 12 years ending in 2021.

As of November 2024, weekday programming includes &quot;Toronto Today with Greg Brady&quot;, &quot;The Ben Mulroney Show&quot;, &quot;Alex Pierson&quot;, &quot;The John Oakley Show&quot;, &quot;Global News at 6&quot;, &quot;The Employment Law Show&quot;, and &quot;Conversations with Ben O&#x27;Hara Byrne&quot;, followed by repeats. Weekend programming includes &quot;Toronto This Weekend&quot;, and &quot;The Roy Green Show&quot;, as well as brokered programming and repeats.

==Defunct programs==
===Toronto Maple Leafs hockey===
From 1998 until 2012, the station aired radio broadcasts of Toronto Maple Leafs hockey games. Dennis Beyak was the team&#x27;s play-by-play commentator when Joe Bowen called games on television, though Bowen continued to call games on radio when the Leafs aired on national TV. Beyak was replaced by Dan Dunleavy in 2011, when he left for TSN to be the Winnipeg Jets play-by-play commentator.

The station has not aired Leafs games since the 2012–13 season. All games have since been split with CJCL and CHUM, owned by Rogers and Bell, respectively. Both media companies co-own the parent company of the team.

===The Morning Show===
On November 7, 2016, the station launched a new morning drive show, &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, pairing &quot;National Post&quot; columnist and editor Matt Gurney with CBC contributor and lawyer Supriya Dwivedi as co-hosts, replacing the John Oakley Show, which moved to afternoon drive. In February 2018, as part of the station&#x27;s &quot;revitalization&quot; following its rebranding as Global News Radio, Gurney was moved to the 9 am to noon slot to host &quot;The Exchange with Matt Gurney&quot;, and Mike Stafford was moved to &quot;The Morning Show&quot; with Dwivedi remaining as co-host.

On November 27, 2020, Dwivedi announced on-air that she was leaving the show and Global, filing a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging that the station had allowed its on-air talent and callers to spread &quot;false narratives&quot; about refugees, Muslims and other groups on air, unchallenged, and refused to enforce journalistic standards on talk radio resulting in her &quot;receiving an increase in racist comments and violent threats&quot;. In her resignation letter, she stated “I can no longer be part of an ecosystem that tolerates and in some cases, actively sows division and discord... As a female, racialized journalist, I have been subject to rape threats against me and my 17-month old daughter and absolutely abhorrent statements from members of the public when I attempt to counter and correct the misinformation and false narratives promoted by other hosts and guests on the station.”

Mike Stafford remained as the show&#x27;s host, with rotating guest co-hosts, until June 2021 when he was fired, after 20 years at the station, for using a racial slur in an internal company group chat while commenting that Ontario Premier Doug Ford was likely to slip up and use the slur during his press conference. Stafford had previously been briefly suspended in 2019 after making derogatory comments about South Asians and Muslims on social media.

===&quot;Leafs Lunch&quot;===
Jeff Marek was offered a position with Sirius Satellite Radio and CBC&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; to host a new show. On September 7, 2007 Marek announced that he was leaving &quot;Leafs Lunch&quot; on AM 640 Toronto Radio to pursue a new route in radio broadcasting on the &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; radio show on Sirius Satellite Radio Channel 122. Brian Duff from the NHL Network was the program&#x27;s host for a period of time until he was replaced by TSN Hockey Insider Darren Dreger. On July 5, 2010, &quot;Leafs Lunch&quot; was canceled. &quot;Leafs Lunch&quot; returned to Talk Radio AM640&#x27;s Saturday and Sunday lineups, filling the noon-1p.m. timeslot until spring of 2011, when it was cancelled.

===Tina Trigiani===
Trigiani&#x27;s show aired weekdays between 1-2p.m., this show generally covered lighter news and popular interest topics. Like the &quot;Stafford Show&quot;, a main topic was introduced and then Tina took input from listeners via e-mail and phone calls. Adding occasional colour to the show was added by Trigiani&#x27;s call screener, Ryan Bonnar and technical producer Patrick Malkin. AM640 Host Jeff McArthur&#x27;s show absorbed the hour in the summer of 2014.

===Bill Carroll===
Aired weekdays from 4-7p.m. Bill Carroll hosted the afternoon drive slot along with commentary from news anchor Sandy Salerno and producer Chris Chreston until early 2016. The opening segment of each show was known as &quot;Carroll on the News&quot; in which Salerno, Chreston and Carroll discussed the day&#x27;s major news stories. This portion of the show was taped earlier in the day due to a conflict with Carroll&#x27;s show on KFI 640 in Los Angeles. Carroll resigned from his position in Los Angeles, but soon after left AM640 in early 2016 for 580 CFRA in Ottawa.

===&quot;The Post Game Show with Andy Frost&quot;===
Following each Toronto Maple Leafs game, radio host and Leafs PA announcer, Andy Frost discussed the ups and downs of the night&#x27;s game. Much of the broadcast involves taking phone calls from the show&#x27;s audience. This show was cancelled on the station, however Frost remained an evening and weekend host on AM640&#x27;s sister station Q107.

===&quot;A View from Space&quot;===
For over 15 years, Gary Bell (nicknamed &#x27;The Spaceman&#x27;) hosted a show, broadcast on Saturday nights, that dealt with current events, numerology and conspiracy theories . The show was cancelled, following its November 11, 2017 broadcast, when parent company Corus fired the late-night host citing complaints of anti-Semitic content. Bell also worked as a producer for various weekday shows during his time at the station and had previously worked as a technician at CKGM and CFTR. He died of cancer in June 2018.

===Tasha Kheiriddin===
Weekdays from noon–2:00p.m. Tasha Kheiriddin focused on politics and lifestyle. The show was produced by Jackie Lamport. The show featured a Political Panel every Wednesday from 1:20 - 1:40p.m. On Fridays during the same time slot a Top 3 panel took place where three women joined the show to talk about three of the top stories of the week. Notable panelists included Maddie Di Muccio, Lisa Kinsella, Anne Lagacé Dowson, and Sophie Nadaeu. The final edition of the program aired March 1, 2019 when it ended its run after three years.

===&quot;The Exchange with Matt Gurney&quot;===
Aired weekdays from 9a.m.-noon, &quot;The Exchange&quot; was a news based talk show with host Matt Gurney. Heather Purdon, Mike Stafford&#x27;s former producer, produced the show. The show was launched in February 2018 and ended in February 2019.

===&quot;The Shift with Shane Hewitt&quot;===
&quot;The Shift&quot;, a national talk radio show broadcast from sister station CKNW 980 in Vancouver, aired on the station from 2018 until 2023. Initially hosted by Drex from 2018 to 2020, Shane Hewitt later hosted the show from a home studio in Airdrie, Alberta.

<text>Sugar &amp; Spice is a 2001 American teen black comedy film directed by Francine McDougall, and starring Marley Shelton, Marla Sokoloff and Mena Suvari. The plot follows a group of high school cheerleaders who conspire and commit armed robbery when one of them becomes pregnant and desperate for money.

The film received mixed reviews from critics. It grossed a worldwide total of $16.9 million against a budget of $11 million.

==Plot==
The story is told by Lisa Janusch, the spiteful and jealous head cheerleader of the B-Squad at Abraham Lincoln High School...Home of the Emancipators (aka &quot;the Fighting E&#x27;s&quot;).

Diane Weston, the kindhearted popular head cheerleader of Lincoln High&#x27;s A-squad, becomes pregnant by the well-known football quarterback Jack Bartlett. After announcing the pregnancy to their parents, the two are kicked out of their respective homes and find an apartment of their own. Jack initially has issues keeping a job, but eventually gets hired at a video rental store. In spite of their issues coming up with the rent money, Jack and Diane try as hard as they can to survive while going to school at the same time. Lisa, who has a bitter one-sided rivalry with Diane, occasionally runs into Jack at the rental store. She is interested in winning Jack&#x27;s heart, but repeatedly fails to get his attention.

After struggling with the rent and anticipating the financial hardship of supporting a family, Diane and her four cheerleader squadmates/best friends, bad girl Kansas Hill, boy-crazy Cleo Miller, nerdy Lucy Whitmore, and uber christian Hannah Wald, plan the perfect bank robbery. They promise each other not to tell Jack about their plan, due to his inability to lie to others.

The squad watches heist films to learn how to rob banks, and Kansas visits her mother at the women&#x27;s penitentiary for tips on where to find weaponry. Following the women&#x27;s advice, the girls visit a bug exterminator, Hank &quot;The Terminator&quot; Rogers, who sells illegal arms and ammo. After failing to negotiate on prices, Hank offers to give them the guns for free on the condition that they befriend his socially awkward daughter, Fern, and put her on their squad.

The squad reluctantly accepts Fern into their circle, and they all begin rehearsing the robbery, as well as their choreography for the winter ball. During winter break, they order doll masks to hide their identities. Lucy backs out of the heist because she receives a scholarship to Harvard. At Christmas, Diane receives an engagement ring from Jack. She then learns he sold his GTO in order to buy her the ring. The squad is forced to obtain a new getaway vehicle, prompting Fern to volunteer her father&#x27;s work van with bad brakes.

At their first robbery at a supermarket, Lucy returns to the group having decided to help them after all. Lisa happens to be in the store at the time of the robbery, and notices that they perform cheerleader stunts in order to cover up the security cameras. The squad robs the bank and come close to shooting a customer after one of the guns discharges by mistake. They make off with armloads of cash and honor their success after burning their costumes. The robbery is widely reported in the media, becoming a juggernaut. Neither Diane nor her friends expect Lisa to suspect them until they are confronted by her and the B-squad in the high school cafeteria, followed by the FBI.

Diane and her friends are arrested and need an alibi...which Lisa agrees to supply them with, in return for being promoted to captain of the A-squad. Diane agrees, in part because she is approaching her third trimester (and therefore can no longer do the meticulous physical activity which cheerleading requires). The group is outraged, but come to appreciate the decision. In order to cover up her actions, Diane tells Jack she won the lottery and after they have their twins, Jack wins his senatorial campaign, and Diane&#x27;s squad lead successful lives after high school.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was loosely based on a 1999 series of robberies perpetrated by four teenage girls from the Kingwood area of Houston, Texas. Sokoloff stated, &quot;It&#x27;s not the same, of course, yet I&#x27;m not sure if &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot; would have been made if that hadn&#x27;t happened.&quot;

The film was originally titled &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice &amp; Semi-automatics&quot;, but the title was changed and the script was toned down following the Columbine High School massacre. The film changed so much from the original that Lona Williams had her name removed from the film and the writing was instead credited to the pseudonym Mandy Nelson.

Casting for the film coincided with the casting of another film about cheerleaders, &quot;Bring It On&quot;. 17 years later, actress Gabrielle Union claimed that she and many of her &quot;Bring It On&quot; co-stars auditioned for &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot;, with the latter seen as the more desirable project. &quot;&quot;Bring It On&quot; was the cheerleading movie that was the consolation prize because you didn&#x27;t get the cheerleading movie that you wanted&quot;, she said. The closing credits use the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Rob a Bank&quot; by the band Size 14. Despite the title, it wasn&#x27;t recorded specifically for the film, having originally appeared on their 1997 self-titled album.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 28% based on reviews from 75 critics, with the site&#x27;s consensus &quot;Though this cheerleader comedy has an intriguing premise, it&#x27;s too empty-headed and saddled with too many lame jokes to live up to it. Also, some critics say the movie is irresponsible in its depiction of teens and guns.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 48% based on reviews from 17 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;D+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s not a great high school movie like &quot;Election&quot;, but it&#x27;s alive and risky and saucy.&quot;
Brendan Kelly of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a positive review, calling it &quot;[q]uite a smart little film with a surprising satirical edge.&quot; 
Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a B grade, and wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s fun in its raunchy unwieldiness.&quot;

Peter Travers at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; compared the film unfavorably to &quot;Bring It On&quot;, saying it was &quot;not in the same clever league&quot; and is critical that Suvari is underused, and that the gags are &quot;scattershot at best&quot;.
Bruce Westbrook of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;The actors didn&#x27;t seem worried by taking a comic approach to teen crime.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened at number five at the North American box office, earning $5,891,176 USD in its opening weekend, short of its $11 million budget but grossed $13,305,101 in the domestic box office and $16,908,947 worldwide.

<doc id="1232536" wikidata="Q2488127" url="?curid=1232536" title="Voltorb">
<text>Voltorb (), known in Japan as , is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. First introduced in the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, they were created by Ken Sugimori, appearing in the earliest design document for the game. Since their initial appearance they have appeared in multiple games including &quot;Pokémon GO&quot; and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, as well as various merchandise related to the franchise. While Katsuyuki Konishi has been credited for voicing the species in Japanese, no English voice actor has been attributed to or taken credit for them.

Classified as an Electric-type Pokemon, Voltorb is a spherical species that resembles an item in the game&#x27;s universe, a Poké Ball. Often confused for them, they will emit electricity or explode when jolted. A regional variant was added later in &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot; called Hisuian Voltorb, resembling the Poké Balls of that region and classified as both an Electric- and Grass-type. Voltorb can evolve into a stronger Pokémon, Electrode, either through experience or the use of a &quot;Leaf Stone&quot; item respectively. Voltorb has seen use in promotions across Japan, as a mascot of the franchise.

Voltorb has been heavily criticized for its simplistic design, which has been called one of the franchise&#x27;s worst, and more so an example of the shortcomings of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;″s Pokémon designs as a whole in contrast to what came in later games for the series. However, some critics still praised aspects of the species, not only in comparison to Electrode but also due to its role as a mimic from classic role-playing games. Other outlets praised it for helping to define later Pokémon designs based on objects, and how fandoms used theories about them to explore more depth in the franchise. Hisuian Voltorb by comparison was more well received, with praise given to its cheerful demeanor as well as the questions it raised on which came first, the Voltorb or the Poké Ball.

==Conception and design==
Voltorb is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Created by Ken Sugimori, Voltorb was one of the earliest Pokémon designed during the planning stages of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, back when the games were intended to be called &quot;Capsule Monsters&quot;, appearing on early concept sprite art for the game. As work on the game progressed, a single color identity was chosen in order to work within the Super Game Boy&#x27;s hardware limitations. Voltorb&#x27;s size was eventually scaled down. During a company poll to decide which Pokémon would be included in the final game, it placed 21st out of the roughly 80 proposed designs created at that time. Once development was complete, Sugimori re-drew the species along with the others in his own art style to give the game a unified look and finalize design elements.

Standing 1 ft 8 in (51 cm) tall, Voltorb is a round, ball-shaped creature with the top and bottom hemispheres appearing red and white respectively. It has two eyes near the upper middle front, perpetually locked in an angry expression. A rarer, &quot;shiny&quot; variant that is blue instead of red also exists. Classified as an &quot;Electric&quot;-type Pokémon and resembling an item in the universe called a &quot;Poké Ball&quot;, they are genderless, and often reside in factories where Poké Balls are produced. Moving by rolling, they will either attempt to shock nearby people or may explode due to a sudden jolt. After gaining enough experience, they may evolve into Electrode. Called Biriridama in Japan, when localizing the games for western audiences Nintendo decided to give the various species &quot;clever and descriptive names&quot; related to their appearance or features as a means to make the species more relatable to American children. As a result, they were renamed &quot;Voltorb&quot; due to their spherical shape and electric nature.

When developing &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot; in 2022, regional &quot;forms&quot; of several Pokémon were introduced called Hisuian forms, variants of existing Pokémon that are related to the game&#x27;s region, and Voltorb was one of them. Gaining an additional &quot;Grass&quot; typing, its design is slightly different, having joyful, angular eyes and a wood grain appearance in contrast to regular Voltorb&#x27;s metallic appearance, resembling the look of Poké Balls in the game. It also has a hole on the top of its head where it will sprout seeds or alternatively discharge electricity when excited. Unlike regular Voltorb, which evolves by getting experience, Hisuian Voltorb requires a &quot;Leaf Stone&quot; item to evolve into the regional Electrode counterpart, and its shiny version appears black on top instead of blue.

==Appearances==
First appearing in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, they were found in large quantities in the game&#x27;s &quot;Power Plant&quot; location, where they would disguise themselves as item containers and attack players that interacted with them. They went on to subsequently appear in several games in the series, including every mainline title until &quot;Pokémon Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;. While it was omitted from those games, its Hisuian counterpart later appeared in &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot;, and both subsequently appeared in &quot;Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&quot;. In &quot;Scarlet&quot; and &quot;Violet&quot; in particular, if approached without sneaking up upon it first, it will now explode immediately, making it more difficult to catch. Meanwhile, in the re-releases of &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, called &quot;HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot;, localized versions of the game replaced the slot machine mini-game with another game themed around the species called &quot;Voltorb Flip&quot;. Described as a &quot;cross between Picross and Minesweeper, the change was done in response to European Union laws regarding promotions of gambling in video games.

Voltorb have also appeared in several spin-off titles related to the franchise, such as &quot;Pokémon GO&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Quest&quot;, and the trading card game. &quot;Pokemon Quest&quot; developer Tsubasa Matsuzaki in particular experienced difficulty adapting Voltorb due to the &quot;block&quot; based depiction of the species in the game, experiencing some backlash from players. In &quot;Pokémon GO&quot;, they were part of the game&#x27;s &quot;Charge Up&quot; event, and later as part of a &quot;spotlight event&quot; after the addition of the Hisuian form to the game. Outside the games, they have also been featured in several episodes of the anime and often used for comedy relief, with one notable shiny specimen being captured by the character Goh. Katsuyuki Konishi has been credited for voicing the species in Japanese, no English voice actor has been attributed to or taken credit for them.

==Promotion and reception==

Nintendo has heavily promoted Voltorb through various merchandise, including items such as drink mixes, keychains, and plushes. In January 2023, as part of a promotion between JR East and The Pokémon Company, Voltorb images were put up around Akita Station in Japan along with a fake &quot;caution&quot; sign for visitors to take pictures beside. In August of that year, a &quot;Summer Festival Park&quot; event was held in Yokohama, with one of the festival games featured being themed around the species. In 2021, leading up to the release of &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot;, Hisuian Voltorb was significantly promoted, first alluded to via a mini-game on social media website Twitter where players were encouraged players to collect Poké Balls, one of which exploded, and later on Nintendo&#x27;s website where several episodes featuring the species were bundled together on their streaming service. Two stop-motion shorts followed afterward, focused on Hisuian Voltorb.

Since their introduction, Voltorb has been routinely criticized for what has been perceived as a simplistic design, especially in the scope of the original Pokémon introduced in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. Jake Magee of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; in particular called it the worst offender of all the franchise&#x27;s Pokémon species in this aspect, noting that without the eyes its design was essentially just a Poké Ball. He further argued that it helped paint the first generation of Pokémon in a negative light when compared to what came after, a sentiment shared by &quot;Kotaku&quot;″s Patricia Hernandez. &quot;IGN&quot; called it &quot;probably the laziest Pokémon design&quot;, but acknowledged that &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; needed to rely on simpler designs in order to work with the Game Boy&#x27;s small resolution and their criticism should not be seen as disdain. However, Kyle Hilliard of &quot;Game Informer&quot; was more aggressive, stating that &quot;designing a Pokémon based on the lifeless spheres that house other Pokémon is just stupid.&quot;

Other outlets were a bit more generous towards their design. While James Stephanie Sterling of &quot;Destructoid&quot; listed both Voltorb and Electrode in her list of thirty &quot;rubbish&quot; Pokémon, she felt the former &quot;has slightly more character, despite being pretty damn crap in its own right&quot;. Liz Finnegan of &quot;The Escapist&quot; criticized it as &quot;hands down, the most disappointing Pokémon from a design perspective&quot;, but acknowledged their abilities to self-destruct and camouflage themselves also helped make it one of the best Pokémon in the franchise. Robert Grosso of &quot;TechRaptor&quot; went further, stating that while he was aware Voltorb was on the minds of many when it came to underwhelming Pokémon, its role as a living bomb meant to surprise trainers gave the game&#x27;s world some character. &quot;TheGamer&quot;″s Sergio Solorzano argued that Voltorb and &quot;object&quot; Pokémon like it were actually &quot;brilliant&quot; designs, proposing that Voltorb may be the father of all such concepts in the franchise and helped the developers to think outside of the box when creating new Pokémon as the series progressed.

&quot;ScreenRant&quot;″s Hayes Madsen argued they served as a similar purpose to that of the &quot;mimic&quot; creature often found in roleplaying games, acting as a subversion on multiple layers as &quot;any treasure found in the world of Pokemon is stored inside Pokeballs, just like the Pokemon themselves&quot;, and further defined what to expect from similar mimic-themed Pokémon in later games. &quot;Paste&quot; writers Kevin Slackie and Moises Taveras stated that while they felt surprising players with a Voltorb encounter when expecting an item was a &quot;cruel trick&quot; to play on them, &quot;this classic bait-and-switch was one of the first ways that &quot;Pokémon&quot; felt alive&quot;. Alex Lucard writing for &quot;Beckett Pokémon Unofficial Collector&quot; enjoyed the comic relief its mimicry brought to the anime as a recurring gag and felt Voltorb was underappreciated, stating &quot;there&#x27;s something about a life form evolving to look like its own instrument of capture that appeals to the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; fan in me.&quot; James Troughton in an article for &quot;TheGamer&quot; on the other hand argued that their formulaic usage throughout the franchise coupled with a lack of randomness made them feel more &quot;run-of-the-mill&quot;, a trait he felt shared by mimic-enemies in other franchises. Jon Cartwright of &quot;NintendoLife&quot; in their retrospective of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;″s designs noted that while the mimic aspect was the one thing he liked about Voltorb, especially in light of Electrode, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if that justifies everything about the Pokémon.&quot;

While he acknowledged the possible mimic concept origin, Solorzano in his own article for &quot;TheGamer&quot; suggested an alternative origin for Voltorb&#x27;s design. Citing that their species number 100 in the game&#x27;s Pokédex, he drew comparison to the Japanese folklore of tsukumogami, a legend that on its 100th birthday a tool will gain sentience, and felt that their in-game descriptions further corroborated this theory. The vague origins of the species have resulted in players proposing their own theories, which Lincoln Geraghty in a paper for &quot;The Journal of Fandom Studies&quot; cited as an example of fandoms attempting to fill in gaps and better rationalize the media they were consuming.

By comparison, the Hisuian form of Voltorb was more positively received. Malachi Lyonsdove of &quot;GameRant&quot; suggested it provided a &quot;chicken or the egg&quot; conundrum of which came first, the Pokémon or the Poké Ball they are disguised as, and caused some continuity errors in the game&#x27;s canon that had previously implied Voltorb was an artificial result of Poké Ball production. While he felt Voltorb would never reach the level of popularity as some of the series&#x27; more notable Pokémon, unlike them their unique design differences pointed to a narrative of how Pokémon species changed due to living alongside humans, their previously friendly nature shifting to a more aggressive one as time went on. He further stated that such &quot;open-ended and vague information&quot; was one of the franchise&#x27;s strongest points.

<doc id="1232544" wikidata="Q172584" url="?curid=1232544" title="Dean Reed">
<text>Dean Cyril Reed (September 22, 1938 – June 13, 1986) was an American actor, singer-songwriter, director, and social activist who lived a great part of his adult life in South America and then in East Germany. Nicknamed the Red Elvis, Reed was the best-selling Western performer in communist countries, with his songs often topping the local charts, and millions of his records were sold in the Eastern Bloc and elsewhere mostly under the Melodiya label. He never renounced his U.S. citizenship, despite often denouncing the policy of the U.S. government, and was seen by the Western media as a threat and as a revolutionary artist.

==Early life and education==
Dean Reed was born in Denver, Colorado, on September 22, 1938. His father was a high school math and history teacher, described as a staunch anticommunist and supporter of Barry Goldwater, while his mother was a homemaker. He had two elder brothers, Dale and Vernon. Reed&#x27;s family moved many times during the 1940s, living in various cities in California and Utah, before returning to Colorado. He was graduated from Wheat Ridge High School in 1956, where he was a star athlete on the track team. Despite his father&#x27;s desire for Reed to enroll in a military academy, Reed studied meteorology for a couple of years at the University of Colorado and earned money in bars singing rock and roll and country music.

==Career==
Reed moved to Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, at the age of 19 and with his good looks won roles in TV. He took acting classes with Warner Bros under Paton Price amongst others. Price was a pacifist and taught him that art should be a mode of promoting one&#x27;s beliefs. 
After realizing he had some talent as a musician, he recorded &quot;Once Again&quot; for Imperial Records as a one-off single to see if reaction to it would justify a full contract. Imperial did not offer a contract, but in 1958 Reed signed a long-term recording contract with Capitol Records. Capitol groomed him to be a teen idol and he produced some modestly popular singles, including &quot;Annabelle&quot;, &quot;The Search&quot;, &quot;No Wonder&quot;, &quot;A Pair of Scissors&quot;, &quot;I Kissed a Queen&quot;, and &quot;Our Summer Romance&quot;. He also made guest appearances on family television programs such as &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;.
In 1985 he said, &quot;When I was in Hollywood it was a place of fear and exploitation, a prostitution camp, where very few people could keep their integrity. I&#x27;m not ready to come back and do Coca-Cola ads to make a living.&quot;

===International fame===

Reed never achieved musical success in the U.S., where &quot;The Search&quot; became his only &quot;Billboard&quot; entry at No. 96. However, &quot;Our Summer Romance&quot; proved to be very popular in South America. In March 1962, Capitol sent him on a forty-day tour of Brazil, Chile, and Peru. While in Chile, he developed a left-wing political philosophy, and began to speak out against oppression and poverty. He protested against nuclear weapons and US foreign policy, and performed shows free in poor neighborhoods and in prisons.

After learning Spanish, he stayed on in Argentina for approximately four years.

During his live concert performances, he was accompanied by the group Los Dominantes, a rock-band from Lanus, formed by Juan Luis Bhe &#x27;Ricky&#x27; (keyboard), Carlos Reale &#x27;Charly&#x27; (bass), Dardo Rivero (first guitar), Juan Chiarello (second guitar), and Jacinto Atencio (drums). Reed made numerous albums and movies, toured extensively, and even appeared on his own television programs in Buenos Aires, such as &quot;Sabados Continuados&quot;, with the appearance of Antonio Carrizo.

In July 1965, he went to Europe for the first time, performing before the World Peace Congress. He traveled frequently to Spain and Italy, and in 1966 he went on a singing tour through the Soviet Union.

Back in Buenos Aires, his politics eventually ran foul of Argentine government policies after the 1966 military coup and he was deported.

From 1967 to 1969 Reed lived in Rome, acting in television commercials and Spaghetti Western movies such as &quot;Adiós, Sabata&quot; (1970). He toured Central and Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union, where he was immensely popular.

In 1970, a week prior to the election of Chilean president Salvador Allende, he was arrested for washing a U.S. flag in front of Santiago&#x27;s U.S. consulate. Pablo Neruda helped him to get out of jail. In 1971, he re-entered Chile only to be arrested again for 21 days. His wife filed for divorce at that point.

Also in 1971, Reed wrote an &quot;open letter&quot; to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, accusing him of having slandered the USSR.

===Life in the Soviet bloc===
In 1973, Reed chose to settle permanently in East Germany, where he continued to write, direct, and perform in films. Over the years he played in 20 films, produced 13 records, and gave concerts in 32 countries. The majority of his songs during this period were uncertified covers of successful hits of Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, The Beatles and others. In 1978 he directed and starred in &quot;El Cantor&quot; (&quot;The Singer&quot;), a biopic about his friend Víctor Jara, the popular Chilean singer-songwriter murdered by the military after the 1973 coup d&#x27;état against President Salvador Allende.

While committed to the politics of his adopted communist home, he did not join the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED). Despite his opposition to many US government and economic policies, he professed his love of America until the end of his life, and his songs often reflected his fondness for his homeland. He never renounced his US citizenship and continued to file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. 

In a 1986 television interview on CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, he defended the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the building of the Berlin Wall, and compared Reagan negatively to Stalin, which angered many in the U.S., including Reed&#x27;s family and friends. Following the interview, Reed received hate mail from the U.S. accusing him of being a traitor.

==Personal life==
Reed married three times. His first marriage was circa 1964 to an American woman, Patricia Hobbs, with whom he had a daughter, Ramona, born 1968. Patricia left him in 1971, returned to the United States with their daughter, and divorced him. Reed married an East German woman, Wiebke Dorndeck (née Schmidt), in 1973, with whom he had a second daughter, Natascha, born 1975. The couple divorced in 1978. In 1981, he married his third wife, East German actress Renate Blume, with whom he stayed until his death despite tensions and allegations that she was informing on him to the Stasi. Reed also had on and off affair for seven years with Estonian actress Eve Kivi.

==Death==
Six weeks after his appearance on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Reed was found dead in Zeuthener Lake near his home in East Berlin. Though it was officially ruled an accidental drowning, his friends in Germany suspected his death was a suicide and his family in the U.S. claimed he had been murdered.

Reed&#x27;s suicide note was later found on the back of a screenplay in his car. In it, Reed expressed his regret about his crumbling relationship with his third wife. He apologised to Erich Honecker, General Secretary of the SED, for his actions which could have resulted in a bad image for the GDR. The note was put into state files as classified information, which did not resurface until after German reunification. Eberhard Fensch, who was addressed in the note, later said &quot;The reason was to spare his wife&#x27;s feelings. There was no other reason. The letter even contained a greeting to Erich Honecker. Why would we cover that up?&quot;

In 2004, Russia&#x27;s Rossiya television channel aired a documentary on Dean Reed, entitled &quot;Кто Вы, мистер Рид?&quot; (&quot;Who Are You, Mister Reed?&quot;), speculating on the possibilities of him having been a CIA, KGB or Stasi agent, but failing to present any concrete evidence to support any such theories. Between 1976 and 1978, he worked for the Stasi&#x27;s international department according to a 2005 book.

==Media depictions==

Reed&#x27;s life is the subject of the documentary &quot;American Rebel: The Dean Reed Story&quot; (1985).

Reed&#x27;s life story influenced Grammy Award-winning writer and comedian Lewis Black and composer Rusty Magee to create the musical &quot;The Czar of Rock and Roll&quot;. It chronicled the rise of a Reed-like character, Eugene Reeves, from Nebraska musician to Soviet superstar. The musical was first produced in New York City at the West Bank Café Downstairs Theater Bar in 1989 and then at the Alley Theater in Houston in 1990. In April 2009 a concert version of the musical, directed by Evan Cabnet, was produced at Joe&#x27;s Pub in New York City.

In 1991 Tom Hanks optioned a biography by Reggie Nadelson, titled &quot;Comrade Rockstar&quot;, finally published in the U.S. by Walker &amp; Company in 2006. Nadelson had been inspired to write her book after seeing the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; broadcast. Hanks planned to produce a movie on Reed&#x27;s life. 
In 1993, &quot;Dean Reed – Glamour und Protest&quot; was released, in 2007 &quot;Der Rote Elvis (The Red Elvis)&quot; and &quot;Gringo Rojo&quot; (2016).

In 2001, English singer-songwriter Steve Bush published the song &quot;Salome for Dean Reed&quot; on the album &quot;Blossom Freak&quot;.

In January 2022, Sky UK broadcast a documentary about the life of Dean Reed on their channel Sky Documentaries titled &quot;Red Elvis, Cold War Cowboy.&quot; CuriosityStream and Amazon Prime are also streaming the documentary.

<text>The Horseshoe Tavern (known as The Horseshoe, The &#x27;Shoe&#x27;, The &#x27;Toronto Tavern&#x27; and The &#x27;Triple T&#x27; to Toronto locals) is a concert venue at 370 Queen Street West (northeast corner of Queen at Spadina) in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and has been in operation since 1947. Owned by &quot;JC&quot;, Ken Sprackman, Craig Laskey, Naomi Montpetit, and the late Michael &quot;X-Ray&quot; MacRae, the venue is a significant part of Canadian musical lore. It is captured in the memories of thousands of concertgoers, and in books such as &quot;Have Not Been the Same.&quot;

== History ==
The building, erected in 1861, previously housed a blacksmith. Originally an 87-seat saloon, it was advertised in recent decades as a &quot;Country Roots n&#x27; Rockabilly Music Tavern&quot;. The Horseshoe Tavern welcomed blues and folk artists in the 1960s; reggae, mod, punk and new wave acts in the 1970s and 1980s; and then alternative rock and everything from ska, surf and swing to Celtic music and alternative country from the 1990s onward. 

The Horseshoe has supported up and coming Canadian artists through programs such as &quot;Dave Bookman&#x27;s Nu Music Nite&quot;, a regular Tuesday showcase. Bookman was a Toronto radio DJ for Indie 88. 

The Horseshoe Tavern celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2007 with six shows by Joel Plaskett. Plaskett played his entire catalogue over six consecutive nights, devoting each show to one full album. Special guests appearing at the concerts included Peter Elkas, Sarah Harmer and Gord Downie.

In 2023, several musicians withdrew their performances from the Horseshoe in response to the venue&#x27;s cancellation of a pro-Palestine fundraiser and contentious emails from co-owner Jeff Cohen.

Two Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors concert films, &quot;This Is Stompin&#x27; Tom&quot; (1972) and &quot;Across This Land with Stompin&#x27; Tom&quot; (1973) were shot at the Horseshoe, along with his 1971 album &quot;Live At The Horseshoe&quot;. The Live album includes an original tribute to the venue written by Connors, the &quot;Horseshoe Hotel Song&quot;. In 1978, the tavern was the setting for Colin Brunton&#x27;s punk rock documentary &quot;The Last Pogo&quot;, featuring The Scenics, The Cardboard Brains, The Secrets, The Mods, The Ugly, The Viletones, and Teenage Head. An archival photo montage of the Horseshoe Tavern&#x27;s history was also featured in Brunton&#x27;s 2013 feature film, &quot;The Last Pogo Jumps Again&quot;.

The Horseshoe was featured on &quot;Live on MTV&quot; in September 1997, when the Rolling Stones began their Bridges To Babylon Tour there with a 75-minute show. In 1998, the club&#x27;s trademark &quot;checkerboard floors&quot; were referenced in the Tragically Hip song &quot;Bobcaygeon&quot;. In 2000, it hosted the Humble &amp; Fred &quot;Gift of Christmas&quot; broadcast.
In 2006, a live recording of &quot;Red Flag&quot; by Billy Talent from a performance at the tavern was released on the &quot;Red Flag&quot; CD single. In 2020, Kathleen Edwards referenced the Horseshoe in her song &quot;Glenfern&quot;.

<text>Josep Maria de Porcioles i Colomer (; Amer, 15 July 1904 – Vilassar de Dalt, 3 September 1993) was the mayor of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain for sixteen years, from 15 March 1957 until 11 May 1973 during the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco. His long administration is associated with the rapid economic and industrial growth of the city during Spain&#x27;s &quot;desarrolisme&quot; and unplanned urban sprawl in Barcelona to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of immigrants attracted to the city from southern Spain. He was finally forced to retire in 1973 due to neighbourhood protests over the poor quality of the housing in the new areas and lack of social provision, and the speculation and corruption associated with the mayor. He is interred in the Montjuïc Cemetery in Barcelona.

He was married to Dolores Sangenís Corrià, daughter of the Carlist politician Casimiro Sangenís Bertrán.

<text>Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia was a Scottish architectural firm famous for their application of modernism in churches and universities, as well as at St Peter&#x27;s Seminary in Cardross. Though founded in 1927, they are best known for their work in the post-war period. The firm was wound up in 1987.

In 2007, the firm was the subject of a major retrospective exhibition at The Lighthouse, Glasgow.

==History of the practice==

===Origins===
The Scottish architect James Salmon (1805–1888) established a practice in Glasgow in 1830. John Gaff Gillespie (1870–1926) was hired in 1891, when the practice was known as James Salmon &amp; Son, and was run by the son, William Forrest Salmon. The practice name was changed in 1903 to Salmon &amp; Son &amp; Gillespie, with James Salmon (1873–1924), grandson of the founder, and John Gaff Gillespie as partners. William Alexander Kidd (1879–1928) joined the firm in 1898, becoming a partner, with Gillespie, in 1918 (James Salmon had left the firm in 1913). Kidd became sole partner on Gillespie&#x27;s death in 1926.

In 1915, the 16-year-old Giacomo Antonio (&quot;Jack&quot;) Coia (1898–1981) joined the firm of Gillespie &amp; Kidd as an apprentice. Coia was born in Wolverhampton, England, to Italian parents, and was raised in Glasgow. In 1923, he left for travel to Europe and work in London, returning as a partner in 1927, at Kidd’s request following Gillespie’s death. Kidd himself died in 1928 and Coia thus inherited the practice by then known as Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia.

===Early years===

At the time Coia took over, the practice had little work. Coia took a teaching position at the Mackintosh School of Architecture within the Glasgow School of Art (GSA), and began to seek new clients. After approaching Donald Mackintosh, the Archbishop of Glasgow, he secured the practice&#x27;s first commission for a new church in 1931. The Roman Catholic Church would remain the firm&#x27;s principal client until the early 1970s. In 1938, Thomas Warnett Kennedy became a partner with Coia, contributing to designs for St Peter in Chains, Ardrossan, and the Roman Catholic pavilion for the Glasgow Empire Exhibition. The practice also collaborated with Thomas S. Tait on the Exhibition masterplan.

Even though the Second World War brought a hiatus in the practice&#x27;s work, one church that they designed, St Columba&#x27;s Church in Glasgow, was completed in 1941. The &quot;Dictionary of Scottish Architects&quot; states that Coia was interned as an enemy alien during the war. However, Rodger disputes this, stating that there is no record of the Wolverhampton-born Coia&#x27;s internment, although several of his Italian-born relatives were taken to the Isle of Man.

===Post-war period===
Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia was revived in 1945, although without Kennedy, who later emigrated to Canada. Coia hired 17-year-old Isi Metzstein as an apprentice and continued to design churches and other works for the Roman Catholic Church. The firm&#x27;s work of this period is considered by architectural historians to be inferior. Rodger describes Coia&#x27;s difficulty with seeing projects through, which was countered by his &quot;flair for heading an architectural office&quot;. This led to the development of an -style practice, with Coia gradually handing over design control to concentrate on client relations. In 1954 Andy MacMillan, a contemporary of Metzstein at the GSA, joined the firm from the East Kilbride Development Corporation, and despite neither of the young architects being fully qualified, they had assumed creative control by 1956. Coia&#x27;s last significant architectural work was for St Charles, North Kelvinside in 1959.

===MacMillan and Metzstein===
The first result of the new designers was St Paul&#x27;s, Glenrothes (1956), which broke with the practice&#x27;s earlier church designs by embracing the Modernism of Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. Their opportunity lay in demographic changes taking place in Scotland at the time. The huge post-war construction project of new towns relocated many people from inner city Glasgow. These changes required new churches for the new town communities, as well as new city churches to service the remaining congregations. Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia were one of the few practices involved in the building of the new churches. MacMillan and Metzstein&#x27;s work in the period 1956–1987 was enabled not only by MacMillan&#x27;s practical experience at the new town of East Kilbride, but also by the willingness of their principal client, the Roman Catholic Church, to accept radical experimentation in the wake of the Second Vatican Council.

Meanwhile, Coia continued to keep up the profile of the practice through lecturing and through his roles as a prominent member of the Catenian Association of Catholic professionals, as a governor of the GSA, and as president of the Glasgow Institute of Architects. He was made a CBE in 1967, and received the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1969.

The church-building programme drew to a close in the 1970s, and Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia began to seek out alternative sources of work. They completed several schools, as well as university projects in England. After Coia&#x27;s death in 1981, the practice was gradually wound down. Their limited output through the 1980s was brought to a close with the conversion of the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford in 1987.

==Architectural work==
Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia&#x27;s work can be split into three main phases, coinciding with the historical development of the practice. Early works were executed in a neo-romanesque style, with features such as round arches inserted into building shapes influenced by Arts and Crafts architecture and international-style modernism. Their use of brick walls was also bold in Scotland, where stone or render were the dominant external building finishes. This style was continued in the second phase, after the war, but with less successful results. The third and most celebrated phase is the period 1956-1987, when Metzstein and MacMillan took over creative control, bringing with them the influence of Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. Concrete, as well as brick, became a preferred material, and the practice continued to be influenced by contemporary developments of Mid-Century modernism and brutalism. The firm is regarded as one of the key British architects of the Roman Catholic Liturgical Movement in the UK that resulted in a large number of new modernist RC churches being built, and other churches being reordered. This group of architects, which included Gerard Goalen, Francis Pollen, Desmond Williams and Austin Winkley, utilised contemporary design and construction methods to deliver the ‘noble simplicity’ instructed by Vatican I.

===Churches===
The firm was already designing churches with a modern influence in the 1930s. with St. Patrick&#x27;s, Orangefield, Greenock forming an example from 1934-35.
Scotland is peppered with modernist ecclesiastical architecture, virtually all from the firm of Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia. St Mary&#x27;s, Bo&#x27;ness (1962), since demolished; St Joseph&#x27;s, Faifley, (1964); Our Lady of Good Counsel, Dennistoun, (1965); St Benedict&#x27;s, Easterhouse, (1965); and St. Paul&#x27;s, Glenrothes, (1956) were all geometric buildings with sweeping roofs, using new construction techniques, such as glued laminated timber. By contrast, churches including St Charles, North Kelvinside, (1959); St Mary of the Angels, Falkirk, (1960); St Bride&#x27;s, East Kilbride, (1963), St Patricks, Kilsyth, (1963); and Sacred Heart, Cumbernauld, (1964) were all rectangular, load-bearing brick, or in the case of St Charles&#x27;, exposed concrete frame with brick curtain-walling. These churches are very plain on the outside, but dramatically lit on the inside.

===St Peter&#x27;s Seminary===

St. Peter&#x27;s Seminary in Cardross, Argyll and Bute is regarded as Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia&#x27;s most significant work. However, since the building&#x27;s closure in the 1980s it has been in a ruinous state. In January 2019 Ronnie Convery, director of communications of the Archdiocese of Glasgow, said that the building was an &quot;albatross around the neck&quot; of the archdiocese, which had the responsibility to maintain, secure, and insure it, and that they could not sell it, give it away, or demolish it.

===Schools and colleges===
Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia carried out several school commissions, including Roman Catholic schools in Cumbernauld, Bellshill and Glasgow, and the Notre Dame College in Bearsden (1969, partially demolished 2007).

===Offices and other works===
The firm&#x27;s most prominent office commission was the BOAC building on Buchanan Street, Glasgow (1970). The firm undertook relatively little residential work, with projects in East Kilbride, Cumbernauld (1961), and Stantonbury, Milton Keynes (1976), as well as sheltered housing in Dumbarton (1967). In 1962, the practice completed Bellshill Maternity Hospital (demolished 2003), winning a Civic Trust Award.

===University architecture===
From the late 1960s, Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia executed three major university projects in England, as well as Bonar Hall at the University of Dundee (1976). The first was The Lawns, a group of student residences in Cottingham, Yorkshire for the University of Hull. It was awarded a RIBA Bronze Regional Award in 1968 and was listed Grade II 1993. From 1971 to 1979 they worked on two extensions to Wadham College, Oxford. These included one large block containing new undergraduate accommodation and a college library, and a smaller addition behind the King&#x27;s Arms pub. This includes a small music shop for Blackwell&#x27;s, described as &quot;a refreshing, shocking contribution to the gloomy Oxford backstreet in which it stands&quot; by the &quot;Architects&#x27; Journal&quot;.

Robinson College, Cambridge was their most important building of this phase, and the last major building they designed. Winning a competition in 1974 for the entirely new college, their building is clad almost exclusively in brick, and incorporates existing gardens dating from the 1890s and 1900s. It was listed at Grade II* in 2022.
