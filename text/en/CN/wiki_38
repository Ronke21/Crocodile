<text>This page is a list of attacks undertaken (or believed to have been undertaken) by Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), a paramilitary and armed Basque separatist group, mainly in Spain. The list includes attacks by all the branches and divisions that ETA had through its history, as well as some kale borroka attacks. Important failed attacks are also included.

Since 1961, ETA conducted many attacks against a variety of targets. Because these attacks number in the hundreds over a span of more than 45 years, not all can be included here. This incomplete list may include attacks noted for being the first of their kind made by the organization, first in a particular area, notability of targets, large number of victims, unique method of attack, or other historic significance. The list is of those attacks described above between 1961 and 2011.

==Overview==
The number of people killed by ETA is sometimes disputed. The Spanish Interior Ministry, the Basque government, and major news agencies state that 829 people were killed in ETA attacks. Some victims&#x27; organizations such as the Asociación de Víctimas del Terrorismo and the Colectivo de Víctimas del Terrorismo en el País Vasco place the death toll of ETA&#x27;s victims at 952, including in the list Iberian Revolutionary Liberation Directory&#x27;s victim Begoña Urroz (regarded by some sources as ETA&#x27;s first victim) and several unresolved attacks, and the Hotel Corona de Aragón fire.

From 1968 until 2002, there were more than 3,300 ETA attacks, which also left more than 2,000 people injured.

<text>Shrivara [Śrīvara] (15th century) wrote a work on the history of Kashmir that adds to the previous works of Kalhana and Jonaraja, thereby providing an update of the history of Kashmir till 1486 CE.
Śrīvara served at the courts of the four Šāhmīrī Sulṭāns Zayn al-ʿĀbidīn, Ḥaydar Šāh, Ḥasan Šāh and Maḥmūd Šāh until 1486, when Fatḥ Šāh took power for the first time. Holding this office since 1459, Śrīvara concentrated on writing the history he had personally witnessed. Unlike his predecessors Kalhaṇa and Jonarāja, who had completed the history of Kashmir in retrospect and continued it up to their respective times, Śrīvara, as a contemporary historian, was left with only occasional retrospective additions going back to 1451.
His accounts, the &quot;Jaina&quot;- and &quot;Rājataraṅgiṇī&quot;s, written as an eyewitness, are characterised by a remarkably detailed density that hardly leaves out any aspect of his coeval horizon of observation and reflection on everyday Kashmiri culture, court life, politics, religion and society. The consolidation of the religious and political influence of a group of Sayyids, who had migrated from Baihaq in Iran under earlier Šāhmīrī Sulṭāns such as Sikandar, and the dynamics triggered by their attempts under Ḥasan Šāh and Maḥmūd Šāh to participate in the reign, culminated in a devastating civil war between factions of indigenous Kashmiris (&quot;kāśmīrika&quot;) and the immigrants from abroad (&quot;paradeśīya, vaideśika&quot;). These events are of particular research interest for tracing the historical ramifications of the Islamisation process in Kashmir. In terms of richness of detail of everyday culture also in its material aspects, Śrīvara’s work is by far the most abundant source on Indo-Persian rule in early modern India and the living conditions under omnipresent threats of famines, natural disasters and warfare. 
Śrīvara’s work breaks off with Maḥmūd Šāh’s (first) dethronement followed by Fatḥ Šāh’s ascension to the throne. The abrupt end of his account was however not caused by Śrīvara’s death. Nineteen years later we hear from him again in the prelude to his Sanskrit translation of Jāmi’s (1414–1492) Persian &quot;Yusof o Zoleykhā&quot;, entitled the &quot;Kathākautuka&quot;. Śrīvara dated his prologue April 18, 1505. The sudden interruption of Śrīvara’s &quot;Rājataraṅgiṇī&quot;, coinciding with the transition of power in 1486, should therefore be sought in his removal from the position of court biographer. Śrīvara had completed his Sanskrit rendering of Jāmi’s Persian composition (1483) only twenty-two years after its publication in Herat.

<text>The red-billed teal or red-billed duck (Anas erythrorhyncha) is a dabbling duck which is an abundant resident breeder in southern and eastern Africa typically south of 10° S. This duck is not migratory, but will fly great distances to find suitable waters. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms large flocks.

==Taxonomy==
The red-billed teal was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other ducks, geese and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas erythrorhyncha&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Crimson-billed duck&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham specied the type locality as the Cape of Good Hope. The genus name &quot;Anas&quot; is the Latin word for a duck. The specific epithet &quot;erythrorhyncha&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;eruthros&quot; meaning &quot;red&quot; with &quot;rhunkhos&quot; meaning &quot;bill&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The red-billed teal is long and has a blackish cap and nape, contrasting pale face, and bright red bill. The body plumage is a dull dark brown scalloped with white. Flight reveals that the secondary flight feathers are buff with a black stripe across them. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults.

This is a quiet species, but the displaying male has a &quot;whzzt&quot; call, whereas the female has a soft mallard-like quack.

The red-billed teal is a bird of freshwater habitats in fairly open country and is an omnivore. It feeds by dabbling for plant food, or foraging on land mainly in the evening or at night. It nests on the ground in dense vegetation near water.

This is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>The yellow-billed teal (Anas flavirostris) is a South American species of duck. Like other teals, it belongs to the diverse genus &quot;Anas&quot;; more precisely it is one of the &quot;true&quot; teals of subgenus &quot;Nettion&quot;. It occurs in Argentina, the Falkland Islands, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Uruguay, and Brazil. It has also established itself in South Georgia, where it was first recorded breeding in 1971, and has been recorded as far east as Tristan da Cunha. It inhabits freshwater wetlands, preferring palustrine habitat to rivers. Considering its wide range and local abundance, it is not considered threatened by the IUCN.

==Description==
The namesake bill is bright yellow with a black tip and a black band along the ridge of the culmen.

The species is somewhat similar to the larger yellow-billed pintail, but has a darker head, shorter neck and plain grayish sides.
==Taxonomy==
Mitochondrial DNA sequence data is most similar to that of the very different-looking green-winged teal. Apart from the mystifying relationship with the red-and-green-headed teals, it altogether most resembles the Indian Ocean radiation of teals. However, the yellow-billed teal&#x27;s unicolored underside and namesake bill are unique, as is to be expected from a species that evolved half a world apart from Bernier&#x27;s or the grey teal.

This species is also unique among its relatives in some aspects of its post-copulation behavior: After dismounting, the drakes stretch themselves up high and swim around and alongside the females.

Traditionally, there are 2 subspecies:
* Sharp-winged teal, &quot;Anas flavirostris oxyptera&quot; (Meyen, 1834) – highlands of central Peru to northern Chile and Argentina.
* Chilean teal, &quot;Anas flavirostris flavirostris&quot; (Vieillot, 1816) – southern South America as far north as southern Brazil and northern Argentina. Also in the Falkland Islands.

Previously, this species and the Andean teal formed the superspecies speckled teal, but increasingly taxonomists consider the two species distinct.

<text>In neuroscience, repolarization refers to the change in membrane potential that returns it to a negative value just after the depolarization phase of an action potential which has changed the membrane potential to a positive value. The repolarization phase usually returns the membrane potential back to the resting membrane potential. The efflux of potassium (K+) ions results in the falling phase of an action potential. The ions pass through the selectivity filter of the K+ channel pore.

Repolarization typically results from the movement of positively charged K+ ions out of the cell. The repolarization phase of an action potential initially results in hyperpolarization, attainment of a membrane potential, termed the afterhyperpolarization, that is more negative than the resting potential. Repolarization usually takes several milliseconds.

Repolarization is a stage of an action potential in which the cell experiences a decrease of voltage due to the efflux of potassium (K+) ions along its electrochemical gradient. This phase occurs after the cell reaches its highest voltage from depolarization. After repolarization, the cell hyperpolarizes as it reaches resting membrane potential (−70 mV in neuron). Sodium (Na+) and potassium ions inside and outside the cell are moved by a sodium potassium pump, ensuring that electrochemical equilibrium remains unreached to allow the cell to maintain a state of resting membrane potential. In the graph of an action potential, the hyper-polarization section looks like a downward dip that goes lower than the line of resting membrane potential. In this afterhyperpolarization (the downward dip), the cell sits at more negative potential than rest (about −80 mV) due to the slow inactivation of voltage gated K+ delayed rectifier channels, which are the primary K+ channels associated with repolarization. At these low voltages, all of the voltage gated K+ channels close, and the cell returns to resting potential within a few milliseconds. A cell which is experiencing repolarization is said to be in its absolute refractory period. Other voltage gated K+ channels which contribute to repolarization include A-type channels and Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Protein transport molecules are responsible for Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell to restore the original resting ion concentrations.

== Deviations from normal repolarization ==
Blockages in repolarization can arise due to modifications of the voltage-gated K+ channels. This is demonstrated with selectively blocking voltage gated K+ channels with the antagonist tetraethylammonium (TEA). By blocking the channel, repolarization is effectively stopped. Dendrotoxins are another example of a selective pharmacological blocker for voltage gated K+ channels. The lack of repolarization means that neuron stays at a high voltage, which slows sodium channel deactivation to a point where there is not enough inwards Na+ current to depolarize and sustain firing.

== Voltage gated K+ mechanisms ==
The structure of the voltage gated K+ channel is that of six transmembrane helices along the lipid bilayer. The selectivity of this channel to voltage is mediated by four of these transmembrane domains (S1–S4) – the voltage sensing domain. The other two domains (S5, S6) form the pore by which ions traverse. Activation and deactivation of the voltage gated K+ channel is triggered by conformational changes in the voltage sensing domain. Specifically, the S4 domain moves such that it activates and deactivates the pore. During activation, there is outward S4 motion, causing tighter VSD-pore linkage. Deactivation is characterized by inward S4 motion.

The switch from depolarization into repolarization is dependent on the kinetic mechanisms of both voltage gated K+ and Na+ channels. Although both voltage gated Na+ and K+ channels activate at roughly the same voltage (−50 mV), Na+ channels have faster kinetics and activate/deinactivate much more quickly. Repolarization occurs as the influx of Na+ decreases (channels deinactivate) and the efflux of K+ ions increases as its channels open. The decreased conductance of sodium ions and increased conductance of potassium ions cause the cell&#x27;s membrane potential to very quickly return to, and past the resting membrane potential, which causes the hyperpolarization due to the potassium channels closing slowly, allowing more potassium to flow through after the resting membrane potential has been reached.

== Type of K+ channels in repolarization ==
Following the action potential, characteristically generated by the influx of Na+ through voltage gated Na+ channels, there is a period of repolarization in which the Na+ channels are inactivated while K+ channels are activated. Further study of K+ channels shows that there are four types which influence the repolarization of the cell membrane to re-establish the resting potential. The four types are Kv1, Kv2, Kv3 and Kv4. The Kv1 channel primarily influences the repolarization of the axon. The Kv2 channel is characteristically activated slower. The Kv4 channels are characteristically activated rapidly. When Kv2 and Kv4 channels are blocked, the action potential predictably widens. The Kv3 channels open at a more positive membrane potential and deactivate 10 times faster than the other Kv channels. These properties allow for the high-frequency firing that mammalian neurons require. Areas with dense Kv3 channels include the neocortex, basal ganglia, brain stem and hippocampus as these regions create microsecond action potentials that requires quick repolarization.

Utilizing voltage-clamp data from experiments based on rodent neurons, the Kv4 channels are associated with the primary repolarization conductance following the depolarization period of a neuron. When the Kv4 channel is blocked, the action potential becomes broader, resulting in an extended repolarization period, delaying the neuron from being able to fire again. The rate of repolarization closely regulates the amount of Ca2+ ions entering the cell. When large quantities of Ca2+ ions enter the cell due to extended repolarization periods, the neuron may die, leading to the development of stroke or seizures.

The Kv1 channels are found to contribute to repolarization of pyramidal neurons, likely associated with an upregulation of the Kv4 channels. The Kv2 channels were not found to contribute to repolarization rate as blocking these channels did not result in changes in neuron repolarization rates.

== Repolarization of atria cells ==
Another type of K+ channel that helps to mediate repolarization in the human atria is the SK channel, which are K+ channels which are activated by increases in Ca2+ concentration. &quot;SK channel&quot; stands for a small conductance calcium activated potassium channel, and the channels are found in the heart. SK channels specifically act in the right atrium of the heart, and have not been found to be functionally important in the ventricles of the human heart. The channels are active during repolarization as well as during the atrial diastole phase when the current undergoes hyperpolarization. Specifically, these channels are activated when Ca2+ binds to calmodulin (CaM) because the N-lobe of CaM interacts with the channel&#x27;s S4/S5 linker to induce conformational change. When these K+ channels are activated, the K+ ions rush out of the cell during the peak of its action potential causing the cell to repolarize as the influx of Ca2+ ions are exceeded by K+ ions leaving the cell continuously.

== Ventricular repolarization ==
In the human ventricles, repolarization can be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram) via the J-wave (Osborn), ST segment, T wave and U wave. Due to the complexity of the heart, specifically how it contains three layers of cells (endocardium, myocardium and epicardium), there are many physiological changes effecting repolarization that will also affect these waves. Apart from changes in the structure of the heart that effect repolarization, there are many pharmaceuticals that have the same effect.

On top of that, repolarization is also altered based on the location and duration of the initial action potential. In action potentials stimulated on the epicardium, it was found that the duration of the action potential needed to be 40–60 msec to give a normal, upright T-wave, whereas a duration of 20–40 msec would give an isoelectric wave and anything under 20 msec would result in a negative T-wave.

Early repolarization is a phenomenon that can be seen in ECG recordings of ventricular cells where there is an elevated ST segment, also known as a J wave. The J wave is prominent when there is a larger outward current in the epicardium compared to the endocardium. It has been historically considered to be a normal variant in cardiac rhythm but recent studies show that it is related to an increased risk of cardiac arrest. Early repolarization occurs mainly in males and is associated with a larger potassium current caused by the hormone testosterone. Additionally, although the risk is unknown, African American individuals seem more likely to have the early repolarization more often.

== Early repolarization syndrome ==
As mentioned in the previous section, early repolarization is known as appearing as elevated wave segments on ECGs. Recent studies have shown a connection between early repolarization and sudden cardiac death, which is identified as early repolarization syndrome. The condition is shown in both ventricular fibrillation without other structural heart defects as well as an early depolarization pattern, which can be seen on ECG.

The primary root of early repolarization syndrome stems from malfunctions of electrical conductance in ion channels, which may be due to genetic factors. Malfunctions of the syndrome include fluctuating sodium, potassium, and calcium currents. Changes in these currents may result in overlap of myocardial regions undergoing different phases of the action potential simultaneously, leading to risk of ventricular fibrillation and arrhythmias.

Upon being diagnosed, most individuals do not need immediate intervention, as early repolarization on an ECG does not indicate any life-threatening medical emergency. Three to thirteen percent of healthy individuals have been observed to have early repolarization on an ECG. However, patients who display early repolarization after surviving an event of early repolarization syndrome (a sudden-cardiac death experience), an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is strongly recommended. In addition, a patient may be more prone to atrial fibrillation if the individual has early repolarization syndrome and is under sixty years of age.

== Impaired cardiac repolarization with obstructive sleep apnea ==
Patients who suffer from obstructive sleep apnea can experience impaired cardiac repolarization, increasing the morbidity and mortality of the condition greatly. Especially at higher altitudes, patients are much more susceptible to repolarization disturbances. This can be somewhat mitigated through the use of medications such as acetazolamide, but the drugs do not provide sufficient protection. Acetazolamide and similar drugs are known to be able to improve the oxygenation and sleep apnea for patients in higher altitudes, but the benefits of the drug have been observed only when traveling at altitudes temporarily, not for people who remain at a higher altitude for a longer time.

<text>CryEngine (stylized as CRYENGINE) is a game engine designed by the German game developer Crytek. It has been used in all of their titles with the initial version being used in &quot;Far Cry&quot;, and continues to be updated to support new consoles and hardware for their games. It has also been used for many third-party games under Crytek&#x27;s licensing scheme, including &quot;&quot; and &quot;SNOW&quot;. Warhorse Studios uses a modified version of the engine for their medieval RPG &quot;Kingdom Come: Deliverance&quot;. Ubisoft maintains an in-house, heavily modified version of CryEngine from the original &quot;Far Cry&quot; called Dunia, which is used in their later iterations of the &quot;Far Cry&quot; series. The Dunia engine would in turn be further modified and used in games such as &quot;The Crew 2&quot;.

According to various anonymous reports in April 2015, CryEngine was licensed to Amazon for $50–70 million. Consequently, in February 2016, Amazon released its own reworked and extended version of CryEngine under the name of Amazon Lumberyard. In June 2021, through Amazon Lumberyard, the open-source Open 3D Engine is based on CryEngine.

==Features==
==Versions==
===CryEngine 1===
CryEngine 1 was first made and used for the first-person shooter video game &quot;Far Cry&quot;. It was originally developed by Crytek as a technology demo for Nvidia and, when the company saw its potential, it was turned into a game. When video cards with support for 3.0 pixel and vertex shaders were released, Crytek released version 1.2 of the engine which used some of the capabilities for better graphics. Later the company developed CryEngine version 1.3, which added support for HDR lighting. The engine has been licensed to NCsoft for their MMORPG, &quot;&quot;. On March 30, 2006, Ubisoft acquired all intellectual property rights to the &quot;Far Cry&quot; franchise and a perpetual license to use the &quot;Far Cry&quot; edition of CryEngine, known as the Dunia Engine.

===CryEngine 2===
CryEngine 2 is used in Crytek&#x27;s game &quot;Crysis&quot;, and an updated version in &quot;Crysis Warhead&quot;, a side story of &quot;Crysis&quot;. It was first licensed out to French company IMAGTP who specializes in architectural and urban-planning communication. The purpose of licensing the engine was to create a program to allow clients to see exactly what a building or other structure would look like before any actual construction was started. As of March 7, 2011, Simpson Studios has licensed CryEngine 2 out to use on a Massively Multiplayer Virtual World (MMVW) that takes place on a terraformed Mars. On May 11, 2007, Crytek announced that they would be using the engine to create a game based on their new intellectual property. It is also confirmed that it would not be a part of &quot;Crysis&quot; and in fact may not even be a first-person shooter. On September 17, 2007, Ringling College of Art &amp; Design became the first higher education institution in the world to license CryEngine 2 for educational purposes.

===CryEngine 3 (3.0–3.5)===
Crytek introduced CryEngine 3 at the 2009 Game Developers Conference, held from March 25 to March 27 and demonstrated it on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles. The new engine was being developed for use on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U. As for the PC platform, the engine is said to support development in DirectX 9, 10, and 11. As of June 1, 2009, it was announced that &quot;Crysis 2&quot; would be developed by Crytek on their brand-new engine. CryEngine 3 was released on October 14, 2009.

On March 1, 2010, a new tech demo of the engine was released for the i3D 2010 symposium, which demonstrates &#x27;Cascaded Light Propagation Volumes for Real Time Indirect Illumination&#x27;. On June 11, 2011, the Australian Defence Force revealed that Navy personnel would train on a virtual landing helicopter dock ship made using the CryEngine 3 software. As of July 1, 2011, the Mod SDK version of CryEngine 3 specifically to create custom maps, mods and content for Crysis 2 is available on Crytek&#x27;s website. Crytek also released a free-to-use version of the CryEngine for non-commercial game development. It was released as of August 17, 2011 under the name CRYENGINE® Free SDK.

Crytek announced on September 9, 2011, that they would be using CryEngine 3 to bring the original &quot;Crysis&quot; to consoles. It was released for Xbox Live and PlayStation Network on October 4, 2011.

===CryEngine (3.6–4)===
On August 21, 2013, Crytek rebranded CryEngine (starting from version 3.6.0) to simply &quot;CryEngine&quot;, and announced that their next CryEngine would not be advertised with a version number. The reason for this decision was the claim that this new engine bears almost no similarity to previous CryEngine versions. However, the development kits available to licensees still use version numbers. The new CryEngine version adds support for Linux and consoles such as the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U. Subsequent appearances at events have also featured the use of CryEngine on virtual reality systems, at GDC 2015 Crytek brought a demonstration &#x27;Back To Dinosaur Island&#x27; to the event to showcase such.

=== CryEngine V ===
On March 22, 2016, Crytek announced a new version of CryEngine, called CryEngine V. Additionally, a new licensing model was introduced with a &quot;pay what you want&quot; model for usage and access to the source code.

On September 21, 2017, CryEngine 5.4 was released, adding the Vulkan API renderer as a beta, substance integration, and other features including new C# templates, asset system updates, and new anti-aliasing techniques.

On March 20, 2018, Crytek changed the licensing from &quot;pay what you want&quot; to a 5% revenue-sharing model.

In 2022 5.7 version was released with few new features as the features claimed to be in 5.7 were scrapped and moved to new CryEngine 6. 5.7 included Scaleform 4 support. The developers have stated that this will be the last version of CryEngine 5 and confirmed they are working on new iteration of CryEngine. The previous versions (before 5.7) were deprecated and can&#x27;t be downloaded.

==Development==
The CryEngine software development kit (SDK), originally called Sandbox Editor, is the current version of the level editor used to create levels for CryEngine by Crytek. Tools are also provided within the software to facilitate scripting, animation, and object creation. It has been included with various Crytek games (including, but not limited to, &quot;Crysis&quot; and &quot;Far Cry&quot;), and is used extensively for modding purposes. The editing style is that of the sandbox concept, with the emphasis on large terrains and a free style of mission programming. The editor can also construct indoor settings.

As opposed to editors like UnrealEd, which use a &quot;subtractive&quot; editing style that takes away areas from a filled world space, the Sandbox has an &quot;additive&quot; style (like &quot;Quake II&quot;). Objects are added to an overall empty space. The Sandbox&#x27;s concentration on potentially huge (in theory, hundreds of square kilometers) terrain, means that it uses an algorithmic form of painting textures and objects onto the landscape. This uses various parameters to define the distribution of textures or types of vegetation. This is intended to save time and make the editing of such large terrains feasible while maintaining the overall &quot;real world&quot; sandbox-free roaming style. This is different from some editing styles that often use &quot;fake backdrops&quot; to give the illusion of large terrains.

In a fashion somewhat comparable to the 3D Renderer Blender, which can be used for game design, the Sandbox editor has the ability, with a single key press, for the editor to jump straight into the current design (WYSIWYP, &quot;What You See Is What You Play&quot; Feature). This is facilitated without loading the game as the game engine is already running within the editor. The &quot;player&quot; view is shown within the 3D portion of the Editor. The Editor also supports all the CryEngine features such as vehicles and physics, scripting, advanced lighting (including real time, moving shadows), Polybump technology, shaders, 3D audio, character inverse kinematics and animation blending, dynamic music, Real Time Soft Particle System and Integrated FX Editor, Deferred Lighting, Normal Maps &amp; Parallax Occlusion Maps, and Advanced Modular AI System.

<text>König Jérôme oder Immer Lustick is a comic operetta in five acts by Karl Michael Ziehrer with the text by Adolf Schirmer (1810–1886). Its first performance was at the Ringtheater in Vienna on 28 November 1878 with Ziehrer himself directing the theatre orchestra. The operetta was only of mediocre popularity and its fate was sealed when the Ringtheatre inferno happened in 1881 which destroyed large parts of the orchestral score. Of the entire score, the only pieces which survived were the Overture, the piano excerpts as well as the aria &quot;Verliebt&quot; (In Love).

&quot;König Lustig&quot; (or &quot;Lustik&quot;/&quot;Lustick&quot;/&quot;Lustigk&quot;) was the popular nickname for Jérôme Bonaparte (1784–1860) when he was King of Westphalia from 1807 to 1813.

<text>John Skinner (31 October 1721 – 16 June 1807) was a Scottish Episcopalian minister, historian, poet and songwriter.

Born in Balfour, Aberdeenshire, he was a son of a schoolmaster at Birse, and was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen.

Brought up as a Presbyterian, he became an Episcopalian and ministered to a congregation at Longside, near Peterhead, for 65 years. After the failure of the Jacobite Rising, his congregation was subject to persecution and in May 1746 the Episcopalian chapel at Tiffery was burned by Government soldiers with the active participation of the local landowner, Lady Kinmundy. His house was also plundered.

For some years he had to minister to his congregation by stealth; and in 1753 he suffered six months&#x27; imprisonment for having officiated to more than four persons besides his own family. After 1760 the penal laws were less strictly enforced, but throughout the century the lot of the Episcopalian ministers in Scotland was far from comfortable, and only the humblest provisions for church services were tolerated.

Skinner wrote &quot;The Ecclesiastical History of Scotland&quot; from the Episcopal point of view, published in 1788, and several songs of which &quot;The Reel of Tullochgorum&quot; and &quot;The Ewie wi&#x27; the Crookit Horn&quot; are the best known, and he also rendered some of the Psalms into Latin. He kept up a rhyming correspondence with Robert Burns, who considered his &quot;Tullochgorum&quot; &quot;the best Scotch song Scotland ever saw,&quot; and procured his collaboration for the &quot;Scots Musical Museum&quot;. Other of his lyrics are: &quot;The Monymusk Christmas Ba&#x27;ing,&quot; a football idyll; and &quot;John o&#x27; Badenyon.&quot; His best songs had been printed, but a collection was not published till 1809, under the title of &quot;Amusements of Leisure Hours&quot;.

He died at the home of his son, John Skinner, Bishop Coadjutor of Aberdeen on 16 June 1807.

In 2005, a collection of Skinner&#x27;s poems edited by David M. Bertie was published by the Buchan Field Club.

<doc id="1241878" wikidata="Q6287026" url="?curid=1241878" title="Joseph Skipsey">
<text>Joseph Skipsey (17 March 1832 – 3 September 1903) was a Northumbrian poet during the Victorian period and one of a number of literary coal miners to be known as &#x27;The Pitman Poet&#x27;. Among his best known works is the ballad &quot;The Hartley Calamity&quot;, which imagined the last hours of several of those trapped underground during the Hartley Colliery Disaster of January 1862. This devastating mining accident killed a total of 204 men and boys and remains England&#x27;s most catastrophic pit disaster.

== Birth and early life ==
Skipsey was born in Percy Village (generally known after the name of the colliery Percy Main), in the Parish of Tynemouth on 17 March 1832. He was the eighth and final child of Cuthbert, an overman at Percy Main Colliery, and Isabella Skipsey.

Skipsey&#x27;s life was touched by tragedy at an early age when his father, Cuthbert, was shot dead on 8 July 1832. In the wake of a long and bitter miners&#x27; strike, tensions in the Great Northern Coalfield were running high and on the Sunday evening, an affray occurred between a group of miners and armed special constables. Cuthbert Skipsey, a man of influence within the community, stepped forward in an attempt to defuse the situation. One of the special constables, George Weddell, pushed him away and shot him with his pistol, Cuthbert died immediately. Weddell was arrested, tried, found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to six months hard labour.

Like many children of that era, Skipsey started work in the local pit at the age of seven as a trapper. In order to break the boredom of the long hours in darkness, Skipsey taught himself to read and write by copying the text from discarded newspapers, adverts, playbills and other printed materials in chalk onto the wooden door he worked at. As his abilities grew Skipsey began, like many other working-class writers, to read canonical writers and was deeply influenced by Shakespeare, Robert Burns, John Milton and Goethe, with Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; having a profound influence over him. In an interview he gave to &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; in 1889, Skipsey told the newspaper that his first attempts at creating verse came when the older boys in the pit would sing incomplete versions of popular songs. Feeling frustration at these half-remembered songs, Skipsey would fill them out with his own words to match the rhythms and the rhymes he picked up. From here he began to write his own verses and poems before finally committing them to paper and, ultimately, to print.

== Marriage and family ==
In 1852 he walked to London in his search for work and found employment there on the railways. It was here that he met his bride-to-be, his landlady Sarah Ann Fendley. They returned North and he found a job at Choppington, and then Pembroke Colliery, near Sunderland.

Skipsey married Sarah, from Watlington, Norfolk, in December 1868. They had five sons (including Joseph b. 1869 and Cuthbert b. 1872) and three daughters (including Elizabeth Ann b. 1860 and who was living at Harraton at the time of her father&#x27;s death). The three named children were the only ones to outlive their father.

== Later life ==
His first volume of his own works was published in Durham in 1858, a copy of which came to the attention of James Thomas Clephan, at that time editor of the &quot;Gateshead Observer&quot;, a relatively new newspaper and the first in Gateshead. When told by Skipsey of his dire situation, Clephan obtained a job for him at Hawks, Crawshay and Sons ironworks in Gateshead.

Following the death of one of his children, Skipsey moved to Newcastle in 1863 and became an assistant Librarian at the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne for a short time. The job did not seem to suit him and, as the pay was poor, he returned to working in the pits, eventually settling at Backworth, where he remained until 1882.

On the death of three of his children within the space of a month, he wrote in the family bible: &quot;On October 16th my son Cuthbert died in his fourteenth year, on the 24th of the same month so did my little Emma 1 year and 9 months old and the 30th our dear Harriet in her seventh year leaving us with our Elizabeth Ann Pringle only. The children died from scarletina. Let me say that three more lovely and affectionate children were never born in this world. Their loss has bowed their parents head down to dust of our reflections and their deaths have enlikened the belief that the dear jewels were wrongly treated. Joseph Skipsey. March 8th 1869. Also William - he was killed by a waggon on the Tyne Main Way near Gateshead on 7 September 1860.&quot;

Following the publication of his &quot;A Book of Miscellaneous Lyrics&quot; (1878), Skipsey&#x27;s work came (via the efforts of a local literary figure) to the appreciative attention of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and, in 1880, he travelled to London to meet Rossetti. During this visit, Skipsey was introduced to many of the leading cultural figures of the nineteenth-century, including most notably Edward Burne-Jones. Following this trip to London, and through the efforts of Burne-Jones, Skipsey was awarded a small annual pension from the Royal Bounty Fund for his services to literature by William Gladstone.

By 1882 he was 50 years old and starting to feel his age, and so when a position of caretaker became vacant at a new Board School at Mill Lane, Newcastle, he applied for, and won the post. This school was successful and grew in size, until the workload became too much for him and his wife. In September 1888, he moved to the position of porter at the newly extended Armstrong College, but even this was hardly the job for a man of letters.

When, in 1889, the post of custodian of Shakespeare&#x27;s Birthplace at Stratford-upon-Avon became vacant, Skipsey was one of 132 applicants. Supported by some of the most important cultural figures of the late-nineteenth century, including Alfred Tennyson, Robert Browning, Oscar Wilde, William Rossetti, William Morris, Edward Dowden, Edmund Gosse, and many others, Skipsey&#x27;s application proved irresistible and he and his wife were appointed joint custodians. After less than two years he became disenchanted with the post which (he confided in a letter not to be opened until after his death) involved dealing with relics which had &quot;no definite history&quot; and having to &quot;perpetuate error and fraud&quot; on the visitors and general public. Skipsey&#x27;s experience inspired Henry James&#x27; story &quot;The Birthplace&quot;.

He and his wife returned to Tyneside, where they lived off his pension, residing, in turns, at the homes of their surviving children.

== Death ==
Sarah Skipsey died on 9 August 1902, at the age of 73.

Joseph Skipsey died in the house of his son Cuthbert at 5 Kells Gardens, Low Fell, Gateshead, on 3 September 1903, aged 71. He was interred in Gateshead Cemetery. Two of his five sons and the eldest of three daughters survived him.

<doc id="1241880" wikidata="Q598302" url="?curid=1241880" title="Yellow-billed pintail">
<text>The yellow-billed pintail (Anas georgica) is a South American dabbling duck of the genus &quot;Anas&quot; with three described subspecies.

==Taxonomy==

The yellow-billed pintail was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the ducks, geese, and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas georgica&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Georgia duck&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The naturalist Joseph Banks had provided Latham with a water-colour drawing of the duck by Georg Forster who had accompanied James Cook on his second voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The watercolour was painted in 1775 in South Georgia. This picture is now the holotype for the species and is held by the Natural History Museum in London. The genus name &quot;Anas&quot; is the Latin word for a duck.

Three subspecies are recognised:

*† &quot;A. g. niceforoi&quot; Wetmore &amp; Borrero, 1946 – east-central Colombia (extinct)
* &quot;A. g. spinicauda&quot; Vieillot, 1816 – south Colombia to south Argentina, south Chile, and the Falkland Islands
* &quot;A. g. georgica&quot; Gmelin, JF, 1789 – South Georgia

==Description==
The yellow-billed pintail has a brown head and neck. The bill is yellow with a black tip and a black stripe down the middle.

The tail is brownish and pointed. The upper wing is grayish-brown, and the secondaries are blackish-green. The rest of the body is buffish brown with varying-sized black spots. The species is sometimes confused with yellow-billed teal (&quot;Anas flavirostris&quot;) but can be differentiated by the yellow stripes on its bill, its larger size, and its tendency not to form large groups. The nominate subspecies is smaller and darker than &quot;Anas g. spinicauda&quot;. The yellow-billed pintail forms a superspecies with the northern pintail (&quot;Anas acuta&quot;).

==Distribution and habitat==

The range includes much of South America, the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia. The nominate and smallest subspecies, the South Georgia pintail &quot;A. g. georgica&quot;, is thought to number between 1000 and 1500 pairs and is found only in South Georgia. The Chilean, or brown, pintail &quot;A. g. spinicauda&quot; is widespread on the South American mainland from extreme southern Colombia southwards, as well as in the Falkland Islands, and numbers well over 110,000. Niceforo&#x27;s pintail &quot;A. g. niceforoi&quot;, formerly found in central Colombia, is believed to be extinct, having been last recorded in 1952 (and described only in 1946). Their habitat ranges from high-elevation lakes and marshes to low-elevation lakes and rivers and coasts in open country.

==Breeding==
The nest is placed on the ground in vegetation close to water. It is lined with grass and down. The clutch is 4 to 10 eggs which hatch after incubation for around 26 days. The chicks have dark brown down above and yellow down below.

== Physiology ==
In high-altitude populations of yellow-billed pintail, hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than in lower-altitude populations, which can be attributable to substitutions in their beta-globin gene. These substitutions are shared by speckled teal because of introgressive hybridization between the two species. Gene flow between populations also suggests that yellow-billed pintails that are heterozygous for the βA hemoglobin subunit may be able to acclimate to high altitudes more efficiently than those that are homozygous for the βA hemoglobin subunit.

<doc id="1241881" wikidata="Q587691" url="?curid=1241881" title="Danube school">
<text>The Danube school or Donau school (German: &quot;Donauschule&quot; or &quot;Donaustil&quot;) was a circle of painters of the first third of the 16th century in Bavaria and Austria (mainly along the Danube valley). Many were also innovative printmakers, usually in etching. They were among the first painters to regularly use pure landscape painting, and their figures, influenced by Matthias Grünewald, are often highly expressive, if not expressionist. They show little Italian influence and represent a decisive break with the high finish of Northern Renaissance painting, using a more painterly style that was in many ways ahead of its time. 

According to Alfred Stange, Albrecht Altdorfer and Wolf Huber were two of the central most figures within the Danube school. Altdofer was the artist that created most of the artworks associated with the Danube school. The term &quot;Danube school&quot; was most likely not what these groups of artist called themselves but a name that derived hundreds of years after a man by the name of Theodore von Frimmel was observing a painting in 1892 in the Danube region around Regensburg, Germany. When artist Lucas Cranach&#x27;s art work was recognized to have stylistic elements of the &quot;Danube&quot; the name &quot;the Danube school&quot; began to take a deeper meaning. The river valleys of Austria and western Bavaria have often been praised as the land of the &#x27;beautiful Danube&#x27; and not in just song but in the pictorial arts as well. (Snyder, James) 

== Characteristics ==
Rugged mountain terrain, towering fir trees and dramatic lighting effects of sunset and dawn are the main characteristics of the Danube school. Other elements that distinguish Danube school artworks is the prominence of nature and how it is represented through these pieces of art as well as the human figure in these natural elements and human events that happen within nature. 

== Notable artists ==
Of all the artists within the Danube school, Albrecht Altdorfer is one that has mastered the landscapes of the Danube. His painting, &quot;Danube Landscape&quot; has been dated between 1520 and 1525 which is a result from Altdorfer&#x27;s mature years capturing the Danube landscapes.

Other members included: 

*Wolf Huber 
*Jörg Breu the Elder 
*Rueland Frueauf the Younger
*Augustin Hirschvogel (draughtsman, printmaker)

Lucas Cranach the Elder had a major influence on the Danube school and is occasionally considered a member of the group.

<text>Francis Edward Smedley (4 October 1818 – 1 May 1864) was an English novelist. His name appears in print usually as Frank E. Smedley.

==Life==
He was born with deformed feet, a disability that impaired his mobility and prevented him from attending regular school. Instead he was privately educated by his uncle. His cousin, the poet Menella Bute Smedley, later kept house for him and acted as his secretary. Smedley died in London in 1864 and is buried in Marlow Parish Churchyard, Buckinghamshire.

==Works==
Smedley contributed his first book, &quot;Scenes from the Life of a Private Pupil&quot;, anonymously to &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s London Magazine&quot; in 1846-1848. Smedley is credited with being the editor of that magazine. In 1849 he arranged for a book to be produced titled &quot;Seven Tales by Seven Authors&quot;. The authors included Edwina Burbury and George Payne Rainsford James. The proceeds of the book were directed to Burbury who had &quot;financial difficulties&quot; and she was given the copyright. The book was republished in 1860 and Smedley purchased the copyright from Burbury to allow this and recording its history in that edition&#x27;s introduction.

Smedley&#x27;s first essay proved so successful that it was expanded into &quot;Frank Fairlegh&quot;, and published in book form in 1850. His next book, &quot;Lewis Arundel or The Railroad of Life&quot;, was originally contributed to the same magazine, which he for some time edited, and was published in book form in 1852. Of his other writings the best known is &quot;Harry Coverdale&#x27;s Courtship&quot; (1855). These stories are racily told. Either Hablot Knight Browne (&quot;Phiz&quot;) or George Cruikshank supplied illustrations for most of his books.

<text>Walter Chalmers Smith (5 December 1824 – 19 September 1908), was a hymnist, author, poet and minister of the Free Church of Scotland, chiefly remembered for his hymn &quot;Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise&quot;. In 1893 he served as Moderator of the General Assembly for the Free Church of Scotland. He attained considerable reputation as a poet. Some of these works were written under the names of Orwell or Hermann Kunst.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Aberdeen on 5 December 1824, the son of Walter Smith, a cabinet-maker living at 16 Blackfriars Street, by his wife Barbara Milne He was educated at the grammar school, Aberdeen, and at Marischal College, which he entered at the age of thirteen, graduating M.A. in 1841. His original intention was to adopt law as his profession, but under the influence of Dr. Chalmers he entered the New College, Edinburgh, to study for the ministry of the Free Church of Scotland.

==Church ministries==
In 1850 he was ordained pastor of the Free (Scottish) Church in Chadwell Street, Pentonville, London. The small congregation did not become larger under his ministry. In 1853 he resigned and was appointed to Milnathort, in the parish of Orwell, Kinross-shire; and in 1857 he removed to Roxburgh Free Church, Edinburgh. In 1862 he was chosen to succeed the Free Church leader, Dr. Robert Buchanan, in the Free Tron Church, Glasgow. In 1876 he transferred to the Free High Kirk in Edinburgh (part of the New College building).

Once settled in Edinburgh he lived at 20 Royal Circus in the New Town.

Smith was a thoughtful preacher, catholic in his sympathies, and of rather advanced opinions for the Free Church of his time, though in the end his influence was felt in broadening its outlook. Two ‘Discourses’ that he published in 1866, advocating more liberal views in regard to Sunday observance than those then prevailing in Scotland, came under the ban of his Presbytery, and he was ‘affectionately admonished’ by the General Assembly in June 1867. In 1876 he was translated to the Free High Church, Edinburgh. During the prosecution of Professor Robertson Smith his strong sympathy with the professor gave some offence to the orthodox church leaders; but in 1893 he had so won the confidence of the church that he was chosen moderator of the general assembly.

==Legacy==

He received the degrees of D.D. from the University of Glasgow (1869), and LL.D. from the universities of Aberdeen (1876) and Edinburgh (1893). He was mentioned in Lord Adam Gifford&#x27;s will.

He was Moderator of the General Assembly, the highest position in the Free Church, 1893/94 and retired in 1894 on completion of this role. He was succeeded by George C. M. Douglas.

He died at Kinbuck near Dunblane on 19 or 20 September 1908. He is buried in the grave of his father-in-law, Rev James Monteith, in Warriston Cemetery in north Edinburgh. The grave lies just south of the central vaults.

==Family==

In 1853 he was married to Agnes Monteith (1830–1886) daughter of James Monteith.

==Artistic recognition==

He was painted by Sir George Reid RSA.

==Published works==

Smith wrote novels, religious works and poems including

*&quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Walk&quot; (1860)
*&quot;Hymns of Christ and the Christian Life&quot; (1867)
*&quot;Olrig Grange&quot; (1872)
*&quot;Borland Hall&quot; (1874)
*&quot;Hilda Among the Broken Gods&quot; (1878)
*&quot;Raban, or Life Splinters&quot; (1880)
*&quot;North Country Folk&quot; (1883)
*&quot;Kildrostan&quot; (1884)
*&quot;Thoughts and Fancies for Sunday Evenings&quot; (1887)
*&quot;A Heretic and Other Poems&quot; (1890)

He attained considerable reputation as a poet. Some of these works were written under the names of Orwell or Hermann Kunst.

* Immortal, invisible, God only wise This remains a popular hymn still in use in the 21st century.

<text>Seoul Subway Line 2 (), also known as the Circle Line, is a circular line of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway. The line running clockwise is called the &quot;inner circle line&quot; and the counter-clockwise line is called the &quot;outer circle line&quot;. This is Seoul&#x27;s most heavily used line, and consists of the main loop (), the Seongsu Branch () and the Sinjeong Branch () for a total line length of . The Line 2 loop is the third longest subway loop in the world after Moscow Metro Bolshaya Koltsevaya line and Beijing Subway Line 10. In 2019, Line 2 had an annual ridership of 812 million passengers or 2.2 million passengers per day.

Headways on the line vary from 2 minutes 18 seconds on peak periods and 5–6 minutes off-peak periods. The line connects the city centre to Gangnam, Teheran Valley and the COEX/KWTC complex.

== History ==

In 1972, then-Mayor of Seoul (1932–1996) changed the existing plans for the Seoul Subway to better enable connectivity around the growing Seoul City and allow for development to take place across the Seoul Metropolitan Area. Line 2 was built in 1978–84 together with the Seongsu Branch (the second Sinjeong Branch was built 1989–95). Dangsan bridge was closed for reconstruction in 1996 and reopened November 22, 1999. The old steel girder bridge was replaced by a long concrete bridge between Dangsan on the southern side of the river and Hapjeong on the northern bank.

Yongdu station on the Seongsu Branch (between Sindap and Sinseol stations) is the first station in the Seoul Subway system with operating platform screen doors. As of 2008 platform screen doors are operating at all stations along Line 2. New rolling stock has also progressively came on line, replacing older vehicles.

*October 31, 1980: Sinseol-dong – Sports Complex (via Seongsu) section opened
*December 23, 1982: Sports Complex – Seoul Nat&#x27;l Univ. of Education section opened
*September 16, 1983: Euljiro 1-ga – Seongsu section opened; Sinseol-dong – Seongsu section separated as Seongsu Branch
*December 17, 1983: Seoul Nat&#x27;l Univ. of Education – Seoul Nat&#x27;l University section opened
*May 22, 1984: Seoul Nat&#x27;l University – Euljiro 1-ga (via Sindorim) section opened; the Circle Line (the longest in the world at until it was surpassed in 2013) is completed.
*May 22, 1992: Sindorim – Yangcheon-gu Office section opened as Sinjeong Branch
*February 29, 1996: Sinjeongnegeori Station opened as extension of Sinjeong Branch
*March 20, 1996: Kkachisan Station opened as extension of Sinjeong Branch
*October 20, 2005: Yongdu Station opened on the Seongsu Branch
*September 2010: Siemens Mobility ATP/ATO GoA 2 signalling system implemented on newer trains to increase frequencies and route capacity.

==Facilities==
In December 2010 the line is recorded as having the highest WiFi data consumption in the Seoul Metropolitan area. It averaged 2.56 times more than the other 14 subway lines fitted with WiFi service zones.

In 2011, retailer Homeplus opened the world&#x27;s first virtual supermarket at Seolleung station, where smartphone users can photograph the bar code of life-size pictures, on the walls and platform screen doors, of 500 items of food, toiletries, electronics etc., for delivery within the same day.

== Stations ==
All stations on all branches are in Seoul.

=== Main Line ===
=== Seongsu Branch ===
=== Sinjeong Branch ===
== Extension ==
There is a possible extension currently in the conception stage to extend the Sinjeong Branch to 3.7 km to Gayang Station on Line 9. The path would include a new station named Gangseo-gu Office in between Kkachisan and Gayang.

== Route map ==

==Rolling stock==

Five generations of Seoul Metro 2000 series trains have been used on Seoul Subway Line 2. As of 2025, only third, fourth and fifth batch 2000 series trains are in operation (manufactured by Hyundai Rotem and Dawonsys respectively), since all first (MELCO thyristor chopper control) and second batch (GEC Traction/Alstom thyristor chopper control) trains have been retired between 2008 and 2023. All trains are stored and maintained at Sindap Depot on the Seongsu Branch and Sinjeong Depot on the Sinjeong Branch.

<text>William Sotheby FRS (9 November 175730 December 1833) was an English poet and translator. He was born into a wealthy London family, the son of Col. William and Elizabeth (née Sloan) Sotheby, and was educated at Harrow School and the Military Academy, Angers, France before joining the army at 17, where he served for six years until his marriage in 1780, when he devoted himself to literature.

Sotheby then became a prominent figure in London literary society. His wealth enabled him to play the part of patron to many struggling authors, and his friends included Walter Scott, Byron, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Robert Southey, Arthur Hallam, and Thomas Moore.

He published a few dramas and books of poems that had limited success; his reputation rests upon his translations of the &quot;Oberon&quot; of Christoph Martin Wieland, the &quot;Georgics&quot; of Virgil, and the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; by Homer. The last two were begun when he was over 70, but he lived to complete them. His &quot;Georgics&quot; in particular advanced his reputation and was praised in the Edinburgh Review as, if not &quot;the most perfect translation of a classic poet now extant in our language, it is assuredly capable of being advanced to that high distinction.&quot; His 1801 play &quot;Julian and Agnes&quot; was acted at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane with John Philip Kemble and Sarah Siddons in the lead roles.

He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in November 1794.

Sotheby died in London in 1833 and was buried in Hackney churchyard. Joanna Baillie, a close friend of Sotheby&#x27;s for &quot;nearly thirty years&quot; mourned his death: &quot;A more generous, high-minded, amiable man never lived, and this, taken together with his great talents &amp; acquirements, makes a Character which cannot be replaced.&quot;

==Family==
In 1780 he married Mary &quot;née&quot; Isted and they had ten children, among them:
* Lt-Col. William Sotheby (c. 1781–1815)
* Rear-Adm. Charles Sotheby (c. 1782–1854)
* George Sotheby EICo (1787–1817) died at Nagpur in the Maharatta war
* Hans Sotheby EICo (c. 1780–1827)
* Col. Frederick Sotheby CB (c. 1780–1870)

<text>Caroline Anne Southey (née Bowles; 6 December 1786 – 20 July 1854) was an English poet and painter. She became the second wife of the poet Robert Southey, a prominent writer at the time.

==Background==
Born Caroline Anne Bowles on 6 December 1786 at Buckland Manor, near Lymington, she was the only child of Captain Charles Bowles (1737–1801), retired from the East India Company, and Anne Burrard (1753–1817), of a prominent local family. Her melancholic father moved the family to the much smaller Buckland Cottage when she was a child, but she spent her summers by the sea at Calshot Castle, home of a military uncle, Sir Harry Burrard.

Her private education was mainly at the hands of the writer and artist William Gilpin (1724–1804), vicar of nearby Boldre, known for his introduction of the idea of the post-Enlightenment picturesque. She showed early artistic talent. Some of her surviving paintings are owned by Keswick School and held by the Wordsworth Trust.

==Penury and poetry==
Mismanagement by a guardian left Bowles in financial straits after her mother&#x27;s death in 1817. These were alleviated partly by an annuity of £150 from an adopted son of her father, Colonel Bruce. The problem spurred her to seek publication for a &quot;metrical verse tale&quot; she had written. She wrote for advice first to the poet laureate, Robert Southey, her future husband, but his publisher, John Murray was discouraging, then to the poet and editor James Montgomery. The work was published by Longman in 1820 as &quot;Ellen Fitzarthur: a Poem in Five Cantos&quot; and reached a second edition in 1822. Much of her work was published initially in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot;, after she had struck up a lively correspondence with William Blackwood.

Bowles&#x27;s first meeting with Southey in 1820 led to a proposal that they jointly write an epic poem about Robin Hood, although this only yielded &quot;Robin Hood: A Fragment&quot; after Southey&#x27;s death. From the outset she could not work in the curious metre Southey chose: &quot;I have been at work trying that metre of [Southey&#x27;s poem] &#x27;Thalaba&#x27;, a fine work I make of it! It is to me just like attempting to drive a tilbury in a tram-road,&quot; she wrote to him.

Most of the fragment eventually published in 1847 was the work of Caroline Southey, including some fine sonnets on their marriage, which took place only on 4 June 1839, after the death of his first wife. There was a second edition of her mixed volume of verse and prose, &quot;Solitary Hours&quot; (1826), in that year. The marriage caused dismay among Southey&#x27;s grown-up children, except for his eldest daughter Edith.

Within three months of the marriage, Southey began to succumb to senile dementia. He died in March 1843. The wrangles spilled over into gossip, and lost Caroline Southey the support of Wordsworth, for example. Caroline Southey had to leave Southey&#x27;s home, Greta Hall, immediately after his death, and move back to Buckland Cottage, where she ceased to write. Her marriage had lost her the Bruce annuity, but she was awarded a civil list pension of £200 in 1852. She died at home on 20 July 1854.

==Satire and protest==
Writing about &quot;Ellen Fitzarthur&quot;, Southey said, &quot;You have the eye, the ear, and the heart of a poetess...&quot; (Dowden, p. 10). Alfred H. Miles in the first decade of the last century noted that her work was neglected: it &quot;had a greater charm for her own generation than it can ever have again. There is a natural simplicity about it which gives it a certain affinity with the so-called &#x27;Lake school&#x27;, and which was much newer in her day than it is in ours. And yet... her work still emits a sweet mild fragrance, and recalls a tender, sympathetic personality.&quot;

Her published output of five books of verse, two books of prose tales and one miscellany of mixed prose and verse has been described by the present-day scholar Anne Zanzucchi as the work of &quot;an experimental and dexterous writer whose publications represent a range of forms: prose fiction (&quot;Chapters on Churchyards&quot;), verse satire (&quot;The Cat&#x27;s Tail&quot;), dramatic monologue (&quot;Tales of the Factories&quot;), and blank verse autobiography (&quot;The Birth-day&quot;).&quot; The last was the work in which she broke her anonymity in 1836.

Virginia H. Blain in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; notes that her &quot;&quot;Tales of the Factories&quot; were among the earliest of that kind of protest poetry, preceding both Caroline Norton&#x27;s and Elizabeth Barrett&#x27;s works in the genre.&quot;

The romance of Southey and Bowles was the subject of a BBC drama, &quot;The Fly and the Eagle&quot;.

Caroline Southey&#x27;s poem &quot;To Death&quot; was composed as a song by Grace Williams in 1953.

<text>The Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is a constituent department of the State Council, responsible for basic education, vocational education, higher education, and other educational affairs throughout the country. The Ministry of Education acts as the predominant funder of national universities and colleges in China. The ministry also accredits tertiary institutions, degree curriculum, and school teachers of the country.

The Ministry of Education currently has 19 internal departments and bureaus. , there were 75 colleges and universities affiliated with the Ministry of Education.

== History ==
The Ministry of Education was founded in October 1949. The work of the ministry was overseen by the Culture and Education Commission that was created at the same time. On October 19, writer and poet Guo Moruo was made the director of the commission, and linguist Ma Xulun was made the first education minister of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In February 1958, the Ministry of Higher Education was merged into the Ministry of Education. In July 1964, the Ministry of Higher Education was restored. In July 1966, the Ministry of Higher Education was once again merged into the Ministry of Education.

In June 1970, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to abolish the Ministry of Education and establish the Science and Education Group of the State Council. 

The Ministry of Education was restored after the disruptions of the Cultural Revolution in 1975 by the 4th National People&#x27;s Congress. Until the Ministry&#x27;s 1975 restoration, the State Council&#x27;s Science and Education Group was the most important government body in the education bureaucracy. 

On June 18, 1985, the Eleventh Standing Committee of the 6th National People&#x27;s Congress decided to abolish the Ministry of Education and establish the National Education Commission of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. 

In 1998, the Decision on Institutional Reform of the State Council was adopted at the First Session of the 9th National People&#x27;s Congress, and the National Education Commission was renamed the Ministry of Education.

In 2003, China&#x27;s Ministry of Education called for adding environmental education content throughout the public school curriculum from the first year of primary school through the second year of high school. Its guidelines on environmental education emphasized firsthand experience and recommended that a quarter of environmental education content should consist of &quot;practice activities&quot;.

In 2019, the Ministry issued a new regulation aimed at unifying the teaching materials for primary and middle schools across China in areas including history, language, and politics.

=== Development of the political counselor system ===
In 1952, the Ministry of Education sought to develop a system of political counselors as a pilot program in universities. Tsinghua University established a political counselor program in 1953, becoming the first university to do so. In this program, new graduates who were also Chinese Communist Party members worked as political counselors in managing the student body and student organizations, often simultaneously serving as Communist Youth League secretaries.

The program was interrupted by the Cultural Revolution but resumed in 1977. After its endorsement by Deng Xiaoping, the program expanded across higher educational institutions.

Beginning in the 1990s, the political counselor system was further institutionalized and expanded in higher educational institutions throughout China, with the Ministry issuing standardized rules such as term limits and age limits in 2000.

<doc id="1241913" wikidata="Q8018648" url="?curid=1241913" title="William Robert Spencer">
<text>William Robert Spencer (9 January 176922/23 October 1834) was an English poet and wit from the Spencer family.

==Early life==
Spencer was born in Kensington Palace on 9 January 1769. He was the younger son of Lord Charles Spencer and his wife Mary Beauclerk. His eldest brother, Robert Spencer, married Henrietta Fawkener (daughter of Sir Everard Fawkener) and his other brother, John Spencer, married their cousin, Lady Elizabeth Spencer (daughter of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough). His father was MP for Oxfordshire.

His paternal grandparents were Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough and the former Hon. Elizabeth Trevor (a daughter of Thomas Trevor, 2nd Baron Trevor). His maternal grandfather was Vere Beauclerk, 1st Baron Vere and his uncle was Aubrey Beauclerk, 5th Duke of St Albans.

Spencer was educated at Harrow School and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1786, though he left the university without receiving a degree.

==Career==
Spencer&#x27;s wit made him a popular member of society. He belonged to the Whig set of Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan and was frequently a guest of the prince of Wales. He did not desire a public life, being content as a writer of &quot;occasional&quot; verse and &quot;vers de société&quot;. In 1796 he published an English version of Bürger&#x27;s &quot;Leonore&quot;, and in 1802 he burlesqued German romance in his &quot;Urania&quot;, which was produced on the stage at Drury Lane. Among his best-known pieces, which were published in a collection of his poems in 1811, were his well-known ballad &quot;Beth Gelert&quot; and &quot;Too Late I Stayed.&quot; His writings were greatly appreciated by his contemporaries, being warmly praised by such figures as Sir Walter Scott, John Wilson, and Lord Byron.

Spencer briefly sat in the House of Commons but gave up his seat in 1797 in order to become a commissioner of stamps so as to support his family. He held the post until 1826, surrendering it after moving to Paris the year before because of his financial difficulties. He spent his remaining years in Paris.

==Personal life==
In 1791 he married Countess Susan von Jenison-Walworth (1770–1834), widow of Count Franz von Spreti and daughter of Charlotte Smith and Count Jenison-Walworth, Chamberlain to the Elector Palatine. Her brother, Count Franz Raugraf von Jenison-Walworth, married Mary Beauclerk, a daughter of Topham Beauclerk (a great-grandson of King Charles II) and his aunt, Lady Diana Spencer), and served as Chamberlain to the King of Württemberg. Together, Susan and William had five sons and two daughters, including:

* Louisa Georgina Spencer (b. 1792), who married Edward Joseph Canning, son of Thomas Canning.
* Aubrey Spencer (1795–1872), who became first Bishop of Newfoundland in 1839, being afterwards translated to the See of Jamaica; he married Eilza Musson, daughter of John Musson, in 1822.
* William Spencer (b. 1796), who married Frances Garland, daughter of John Garland, in 1820.
* Harriet Caroline Octavia Spencer (1798–1831), who had an illegitimate child with George Spencer-Churchill, 6th Duke of Marlborough, but married her cousin, Count Karl Theodor von Westerholt (son of Count Alexander von Westerholt), in 1819.
* George Spencer (1799–1866), who was consecrated the second Bishop of Madras in 1837; he married Harriet Theodora Hobhouse, daughter of Sir Benjamin Hobhouse, 1st Baronet.

Spencer died in Paris in October 1834. His remains were taken back to England and buried in Harrow Church.

<doc id="1241914" wikidata="Q220955" url="?curid=1241914" title="Erin Brockovich (film)">
<text>Erin Brockovich is a 2000 American biographical legal drama film directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Susannah Grant. The film is a dramatization of the true story of Erin Brockovich, portrayed by Julia Roberts, who initiated a legal case against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company over its culpability for the Hinkley groundwater contamination incident. &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on March 14, 2000, and was released theatrically in the United States by Universal Pictures on March 17, 2000, and internationally by Columbia Pictures. It emerged as a critical and commercial success, grossing $256.3 million worldwide.

The film received five nominations at the 73rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (Albert Finney). For her performance, Roberts won Best Actress at the Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, the Critics Choice Awards, the Golden Globes, and the SAG Awards. Additionally, the film also won the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Director (for Soderbergh, also for &quot;Traffic&quot;) and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role (Finney).

==Plot==

In 1993, Erin Brockovich is an unemployed single mother of three children, who has recently been injured in a car crash with a doctor and is suing him. Her lawyer, Ed Masry, expects to win, but Erin&#x27;s explosive courtroom behavior under cross-examination loses her the case, and Ed will not return her phone calls afterwards. One day, he arrives at work to find her in the office, apparently working. She says that he told her things would work out and they did not, and that she needed a job. Ed takes pity on Erin, and she gets a paid job at the office.

Erin is given files for a real estate case where the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) is offering to purchase the home of Donna Jensen, a resident of Hinkley, California. Erin is surprised to see medical records in the file and visits Donna, who explains that she had simply kept all her PG&amp;E correspondence together. Donna appreciates PG&amp;E&#x27;s help: she has had several tumors and her husband has Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, but PG&amp;E has always supplied a doctor at their own expense. Erin asks why they would do that, and Donna replies, &quot;because of the chromium&quot;. Erin begins digging into the case and finds evidence that the groundwater in Hinkley is seriously contaminated with carcinogenic hexavalent chromium, but PG&amp;E has been telling Hinkley residents that they use a safer form of chromium. After several days away from the office doing this research, she is fired by Ed until he realizes that she has been working the entire time, and sees what she has found out.

Rehired, she continues her research, and over time, visits many Hinkley residents and wins their trust. She finds many cases of tumors and other medical problems in Hinkley. Everyone has been treated by PG&amp;E&#x27;s doctors and thinks the cluster of cases is just a coincidence, unrelated to the &quot;safe&quot; chromium. The Jensens&#x27; claim for compensation grows into a major lawsuit, but the direct evidence only relates to PG&amp;E&#x27;s Hinkley plant, not to the senior management.

Knowing that PG&amp;E could slow any settlement for years through delays and appeals, Ed takes the opportunity to arrange for disposition by binding arbitration, but a large majority of the plaintiffs must agree to this. Erin returns to Hinkley and persuades all 634 plaintiffs to go along. While she is there, a man named Charles Embry approaches her to say that he and his cousin were PG&amp;E employees, but his cousin recently died from the poison. The man says he was tasked with destroying documents at PG&amp;E, but, &quot;as it turns out,&quot; he &quot;wasn&#x27;t a very good employee&quot;.

Embry gives Erin the documents, which include a 1966 memo proving corporate headquarters knew the water was contaminated with hexavalent chromium, did nothing about it, and advised the Hinkley operation to keep this secret. The judge orders PG&amp;E to pay a settlement amount of $333 million to be distributed among the plaintiffs.

In the aftermath, Ed hands Erin her bonus payment for the case but warns her he has changed the amount. She explodes into a complaint that she deserves more respect, but is astonished to find that he has increased it—to $2 million.

=== Development and writing ===
The idea for the film came to be when executive producer Carla Santos Shamberg happened to learn about Erin Brockovich&#x27;s story due to sharing a chiropractor with her. Santos Shamberg invited Brockovich over to her house to share her story. Of their meeting, Santos Shamberg recalled: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It seemed incredible that this twice-divorced woman with three young children, who had no money, no resources, and no formal education, had single-handedly put this case together. I thought she seemed like the perfect role model for the new millennium.&quot;

Brockovich sold the film rights to her story in 1997 and the film began development at Jersey Films. Producers courted Callie Khouri and Paul Attanasio to write the script, but after they passed, screenwriter Susannah Grant was hired. Grant, who was looking to do a &quot;story about a kick-ass broad&quot;, secured a meeting with Brockovich in person. Grant spent a year following Brockovich and her kids around while writing the screenplay. To ensure the script’s accuracy, Grant said she spent weeks going over the trial transcripts, Hinkley water board records, and notes made by Brockovich during the investigation.

Grant and the producers were in agreement that they did not want to do a traditional courtroom drama where institutional corruption would be the heart of the story. Said Grant of the script: &quot;I came to believe that the spine of the story would be stronger if it was an emotional spine rather than an informational spine. So I really structured it [around] Erin and Ed&#x27;s relationship. Structurally, it&#x27;s a love story. It&#x27;s not a romantic love, obviously, but it is an interpersonal love story. That was going to give me the most freedom. There&#x27;s a scene where she&#x27;s explaining the degree of malfeasance on PG&amp;E&#x27;s part, and all of that is in there, but what she&#x27;s really doing in that scene is proving to Ed her worth and that he should be stepping up and meeting her where she is.&quot;

After three big-name directors passed on helming the film, Jersey Films approached Steven Soderbergh, who already had a relationship with the production company due to his 1998 film &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. Soderbergh was selected to direct because he was known for being a good director of women. &quot;I knew he would treat this character with a lot of respect and not make her silly. He did it with Jennifer Lopez [in &#x27;Out of Sight&#x27;] and Andie MacDowell [in &#x27;&quot;sex, lies, &amp; videotape&quot;&#x27;],&quot; said Santos Shamberg. Said Soderberg: &quot;It’s rare to find human-sized heroes, and I was just captivated by [Erin] and her relationship with Ed and the fact that it was a story about people who made certain sacrifices and stood on certain principles without being a screed.&quot; Soderbergh was also drawn to the project for the opportunity to direct a film in which the female protagonist is in every scene in the film, something he had never done before.

Santos Shamberg pictured Julia Roberts in the lead role from the outset, but producers thought her casting would be a long shot. However, the script was slipped to Roberts&#x27; agent and the actress expressed enthusiasm in taking on the lead role and working with Soderbergh. In doing the film, Roberts became the first actress at that time to be paid $20 million.

=== Filming ===
The film was shot in 1999 over eleven weeks, of which five took place in Ventura, California. Richard LaGravenese did an uncredited script polish.

Brockovich herself appears in the film as a waitress, while Edward Masry appears as a diner patron sitting behind her. A judge who delivered a key ruling in the PG&amp;E case was played by the actual judge.

The scene where a PG&amp;E attorney is afraid to drink from a glass of water after Brockovich and Masry inform her that it came from Hinkley wells was altered for dramatic effect, but did actually take place during a trial.

A scene that was cut from the final version showed Erin becoming sick from the toxins, which happened in real life. Soderbergh excised the scene as he &quot;didn&#x27;t want people to think that this was going to turn into one of those movies where the protagonist gets terminally ill. It was a tough call, because Erin really did get sick and was hospitalized for a while.&quot;

&quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; performed well with test audiences but executives at Universal Pictures were worried that audiences would be turned off by the title character&#x27;s use of profane language.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; was released in 2,848 theaters on March 17, 2000, and grossed $28.1 million on its opening weekend. It had the second-highest March opening weekend upon release, after &quot;Liar Liar&quot;. This was also the second-highest opening weekend for a Julia Roberts film, behind &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;. The film reached the number one spot during its first weekend, beating &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; and &quot;Final Destination&quot;. It made $18.5 million while declining by 34% for its second weekend while outgrossing &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;, &quot;Here on Earth&quot; and &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot;. Then, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; collected $13.8 million in its third weekend, defeating &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; and &quot;The Skulls&quot;. Overall, it spent a total of three weeks as the number one film until it was dethroned by &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;. The film went on to make $125.6 million in North America, making it the tenth highest-grossing film domestically for the year 2000. It grossed $130.7 million internationally for a worldwide total of $256.3 million.

===Critical response===
On review website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; holds an approval rating of 85% based on 152 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. The critics consensus reads, &quot;Taking full advantage of Julia Roberts&#x27;s considerable talent and appeal, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; overcomes a few character and plot issues to deliver a smart, thoughtful, and funny legal drama.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted score of 73 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In his review for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Andrew Sarris wrote, &quot;We get the best of independent cinema and the best of mainstream cinema all in one package. &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, like &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; right before it, makes the year 2000 seem increasingly promising for movies&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s David Ansen began his review with, &quot;Julia Roberts is flat-out terrific in &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;.&quot; Furthermore, he wrote, &quot;Roberts has wasted her effervescence on many paltry projects, but she hits the jackpot this time. Erin, single mother of three, a former Miss Wichita who improbably rallies a community to take on a multi-billion-dollar corporation, is the richest role of her career, simultaneously showing off her comic, dramatic and romantic chops&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Peter Travers wrote, &quot;Roberts shows the emotional toll on Erin as she tries to stay responsible to her children and to a job that has provided her with a first taste of self-esteem&quot;. In his review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a &quot;B+&quot; rating and wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a delight to watch Roberts, with her flirtatious sparkle and undertow of melancholy, ricochet off Finney&#x27;s wonderfully jaded, dry-as-beef-jerky performance as the beleaguered career attorney who knows too much about the loopholes of his profession to have much faith left in it&quot;. &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;″s Andrew O&#x27;Hehir wrote, &quot;Perhaps the best thing about this relaxed and supremely engaging film (for my money the best work either the director or his star has ever done) is that even its near-fairytale resolution doesn&#x27;t offer a magical transformation&quot;. In her review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Amy Taubin wrote, &quot;What&#x27;s pretty original about the picture is that it focuses an investigative drama based on a true story around a comic performance&quot;.

However, film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a two-star review, writing, &quot;There is obviously a story here, but &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it compelling. The film lacks focus and energy, the character development is facile and thin&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A.O. Scott wrote, &quot;After proving, for about 40 minutes, what a marvelous actress she can be, Ms. Roberts spends the next 90 content to be a movie star. As the movie drags on, her performance swells to bursting with moral vanity and phony populism&quot;. &quot;Time&quot;″s Richard Corliss found the film to be &quot;slick, grating and false. We bet it makes a bundle&quot;.

Writing about the film for its twentieth anniversary, critic Scott Tobias wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;With this film and &quot;Traffic&quot; the same year, Soderbergh would prove to be a master at connecting the dots without making it seem like an information dump. In &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, Roberts is the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down: as we learn about different types of chromium, the range of medical abnormalities, and the ins and outs of real estate documents and toxicology reports, she&#x27;s ripping some poor suit with invective or using her body as a diversionary tactic. It never feels difficult to sort through the facts – and, more crucially, the emotional stakes of the case are never lost in them. That&#x27;s Brockovich&#x27;s gift. And that&#x27;s Roberts&#x27;, too.&quot;

===Accolades===
Julia Roberts became the first actress to win an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award, Golden Globe Award, National Board of Review Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for a single performance.

Steven Soderbergh received dual nominations for Best Director that year for both &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; and &quot;Traffic&quot;, winning the award for the latter.

American Film Institute recognition:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** Erin Brockovich – Hero No. 31
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers – No. 73

==Accuracy==
On her website, Brockovich says the film is &quot;probably 98% accurate&quot;. While the general facts of the story are accurate, there are some minor discrepancies between actual events and the movie, as well as a number of controversial and disputed issues more fundamental to the case. In the film, Erin Brockovich appears to deliberately use her cleavage to seduce the water board attendant to allow her to access the documents. Brockovich has acknowledged that her cleavage may have had an influence, but denies consciously trying to influence individuals in this way. In the film, Ed Masry represents Erin Brockovich in the car crash case. In reality, it was his law partner, Jim Vititoe. Brockovich had never been Miss Wichita; she had been Miss Pacific Coast. According to Brockovich, this detail was deliberately changed by Soderbergh as he thought it was &quot;cute&quot; to have her be beauty queen of the region from which she came. The &quot;not so good employee&quot; who met Brockovich in the bar was Chuck Ebersohl. He told Erin about the documents that he and Lillian Melendez had been tasked by PG&amp;E to destroy.

George Halaby, played by Aaron Eckhart in the film, along with Brockovich&#x27;s ex-husband Shawn Brown, alleged that she had an affair with Masry. They also attempted to file a lawsuit against her for $310,000. Halaby was arrested and the lawyer John Jeffrey Reiner was suspended from practicing, convicted of extortion, and later disbarred.

<doc id="1241920" wikidata="Q1515344" url="?curid=1241920" title="Kirkpatrick Macmillan">
<text>Kirkpatrick Macmillan (2 September 1812 in Keir, Dumfries and Galloway – 26 January 1878 in Keir) was a Scottish blacksmith. He is generally credited with inventing the treadle bicycle.

==Invention of the first pedal driven bicycle==
According to the research of his relative James Johnston in the 1890s, Macmillan was the first to invent the pedal-driven bicycle. However, he didn&#x27;t invent the modern bicycle pedals but rather adapted the treadle, known since the Middle Ages, to the draisine. Johnston, a corn trader and tricyclist, had the firm aim, in his own words &quot;to prove that to my native country of Dumfries belongs the honour of being the birthplace of the invention of the bicycle&quot;.

Macmillan allegedly completed construction of a pedal driven bicycle of wood in 1839 that included iron-rimmed wooden wheels, a steerable wheel in the front and a larger wheel in the rear which was connected to pedals via connecting rods.

A Glasgow newspaper reported in 1842 an accident in which an anonymous &quot;gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design&quot; knocked over a pedestrian in the Gorbals and was fined five British shillings. Johnston identified Macmillan as that gentleman.

A 1939 plaque on the family smithy in Courthill reads &quot;He builded better than he knew.&quot; Yet MacMillan lived in Glasgow and worked at the Vulcan Foundry during the relevant period around 1840, not in Courthill.

===Scepticism===
The Johnston doctrine of the bright, modest and industrious tradesman, achieving what others would only do decades later, captured the public imagination, especially in Scotland. It was also well accepted among historians, at least British ones, in the early 20th century.

Johnston did not present conclusive proofs, though he wrote that he had them. Sceptics allege that the MacMillan design which he presented was a composite of two 1869 velocipedes by Thomas McCall. At the behest of Johnston, Thomas McCall built a replica to be presented as MacMillan&#x27;s at the 1896 Stanley show (and now at Dumfries Museum) perhaps for financial reasons.

The identification of MacMillan as recipient of an early speeding ticket for his bicycling is doubted by Alastair Dodds on grounds that its application would require an early Victorian newspaper to call a blacksmith a &quot;gentleman&quot;. However, that fails to explain what the velocipede of ingenious design was. Misgivings did not deter popular retelling with interesting details from sources unknown, including the detail that, after the accident, his niece, Mary Marchbank, had an illicit ride on the machine, thereby becoming the first female cyclist.

However, it is said that Gavin Dalzell of Lesmahagow copied the Macmillan machine in 1846 and passed on the details to so many people that for more than 50 years he was generally regarded as the inventor of the bicycle.

===Other claims to invention===
Some historians who have studied the invention of the pedal-driven bicycle, including David V. Herlihy, state that Macmillan was not the first inventor. Herlihy states there is no contemporary documentary evidence that a pedal-crank design was applied to a 2-wheeled vehicle and that letters from customers in Scotland to the Michaux company in 1868 state that all of the human-powered vehicles there are tricycles and quadracycles. A similar claim is made by David Gordon Wilson.

<text>George Warrington Steevens (10 December 1869 – 15 January 1900) was a British journalist and writer.

==Life==
Steevens was born in Sydenham, and educated at the City of London School and Balliol College, Oxford. He was elected a fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1893 and also spent some time at Cambridge where he edited a weekly periodical.

As a journalist, he distinguished himself by his clearness of vision and vivid style, and was connected successively with the &quot;National Observer&quot;, &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, and, from 1896, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

He was the most famous war correspondent of his time, before being eclipsed by the daring escape of young Churchill from a Pretoria prison. Steevens utilised the articles which appeared in these and other publications in various books, such as &quot;Monologues of the Dead&quot; (1895), &quot;The Land of the Dollar&quot; (America) (1897), &quot;With the Conquering Turk&quot; (1897), &quot;With Kitchener to Khartum&quot;, chronicling his attachment to British forces during the Mahdist War in the Sudan, &quot;The Tragedy of Dreyfus&quot; and his posthumous &quot;From Cape Town to Ladysmith&quot;. He is also the author of In India, a series of articles on India published in 1899.

He was appointed by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as war correspondent to South Africa during the Second Boer War in 1899. Caught in the siege of Ladysmith, he kept up morale during the early months with his mordant witticisms appearing in &quot;Ladysmith Lyre&quot; (e.g. &quot;a strange sideway out of Ladysmith&quot; for death by disease or starvation). He died of enteric fever (now more commonly known as typhoid) on 15 January 1900, six weeks before the Natal Field Army of Redvers Buller relieved Ladysmith.

== In popular culture ==
Jack London credited Steevens with inventing the cocktail Abu Hamed in the opening paragraph of &quot;The Inevitable White Man&quot;.

<doc id="1241922" wikidata="Q7842098" url="?curid=1241922" title="Triloki Nath Khoshoo">
<text>Triloki Nath Khoshoo (1927-2002) was an Indian environmental scientist and administrator. He started his professional career as the co-founder of the Department of Botany that moved to Khalsa College, Amritsar, soon after the partition of India.

After a brief stint as Chairman of the Botany Department at Jammu and Kashmir University, he joined the National Botanical Gardens, Lucknow, in 1964 as Assistant Director, where he worked under Kailas Nath Kaul, the Founder Director of the Gardens. He soon became the Director, and due to his efforts, the institution rose to the stature of being the National Botanical Research Institute in 1978.

== Government posts ==

In 1982, he became the Secretary of the newly created Department of Environment in Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s cabinet with the responsibility of developing a pro-active environmental policy for the country. In 1985, he joined TERI as a Distinguished Fellow and contributed to public policy discussions at national as well as international forums.

== Writings ==

Khoshoo was a prolific writer. Over the course of five decades, he authored more than 250 research papers on plant genetics and evolution, biomass, energy, forestry, conservation and the utilization and management of natural resources. He wrote seven books and edited eleven more on a wide range of subjects. His book &#x27;Mahatma Gandhi: An Apostle of Applied Human Ecology&#x27;, published in 1996, was widely applauded for the practical relevance of Gandhian philosophy in today&#x27;s world.

== Decorations ==

In 1992, Khoshoo was decorated with one of India&#x27;s highest civilian awards, the Padma Bhushan.

He was honored by the United Nations in 1996, when he was awarded the Sasakawa Environmental Prize by the United Nations Environment Program.

== Cannaceae ==

The world of the Cannaceae family and the Canna genus has much to thank Khoshoo for, because it is from his work that we have gathered much of our knowledge of the genus. In all, Khoshoo authored and co-authored over 10 separate papers on the subject of Canna, many of which were bought together in a single document called &quot;Origin and Evolution of Cultivated Cannas&quot;.

<text>The Lake Bodom murders is an unsolved homicide case in which three teenage campers were killed and another seriously injured in Finland. The case is one of the most notorious crimes in modern Finnish history.

Sometime between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. (EET) on 5 June 1960, at Lake Bodom in Espoo, Uusimaa, Maila Irmeli Björklund and Anja Tuulikki Mäki (both 15) and Seppo Boisman (18) were killed by stabbing and blunt-force trauma to their heads while sleeping inside a tent. The fourth youth, Nils Gustafsson, then aged 18, was found outside the tent with broken facial bones and stab wounds. 

Despite extensive investigations, the perpetrator was never identified and various theories on the killer&#x27;s identity have been presented over the years. Gustafsson was unexpectedly arrested on suspicion of committing the murders in 2004, but he was found not guilty the following year.

== Murders ==
On Saturday, 4 June 1960, four Finnish teenagers had decided to camp along the shore of Lake Bodom (Finnish: &quot;Bodominjärvi&quot;, Swedish: &quot;Bodom träsk&quot;), near the city of Espoo&#x27;s Oittaa Manor. Maila Irmeli Björklund and Anja Tuulikki Mäki were both aged 15 at the time; accompanying them were their boyfriends, Seppo Antero Boisman and Nils Wilhelm Gustafsson, both aged 18.

Sometime between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. (EET) during the early morning hours of Sunday, June 5, 1960, Mäki, Björklund and Boisman were all stabbed and bludgeoned to death by an unknown assailant. Gustafsson, the only survivor of the massacre, had fractured facial bones that appeared to confirm his story of being a victim. He stated afterwards that he had seen a glimpse of an attacker clothed in black with bright red eyes coming for them.

At about 6:00 a.m., a group of boys birdwatching some distance away had reportedly seen the tent collapse and a blond man walking away from the site. The bodies of the victims were discovered at about 11:00 a.m. by a carpenter named Esko Oiva Johansson. He alerted the police, who arrived on the scene at noon.

== Initial investigation ==

The killer had not injured the victims from inside the tent but instead had attacked the occupants from outside with a knife and an unidentified blunt instrument (possibly a rock) through the sides of the tent. The murder weapons have never been located. The killer had taken several items which detectives found puzzling, including the keys to the victims&#x27; motorcycles, which themselves had been left behind. Gustafsson&#x27;s shoes were partially hidden approximately 500 metres from the murder site. The police did not cordon off the site nor record the details of the scene (later seen as a major error) and almost immediately allowed a crowd of police officers and other people to trample around and disturb the evidence. The mistake was further exacerbated by calling in soldiers to assist with the search around the lake for the missing items, several of which were never found.

Björklund, Gustafsson&#x27;s girlfriend, was found undressed from the waist down and was lying on top of the tent, and had suffered the most injuries out of all of the victims. She was stabbed multiple times after her death, whilst the other two teenagers were slain with less brutality. Gustafsson was also found lying on the top of the tent.

==Suspects==
There have been numerous suspects over the course of the investigation of the Lake Bodom murders, but the following are the most notable.

===Valdemar Gyllström===
Many local people suspected Karl Valdemar Gyllström, a kiosk keeper from Oittaa known to have been hostile towards campers. Police found no hard evidence to link him to the actual murders. They were sceptical of supposed confessions he was said to have made because they considered him disturbed. He drowned in Lake Bodom in 1969, most likely by suicide. The people in the town knew Gyllström was violent, cut down tents, threw rocks at people who came to his street, and some later said that it was Gyllström they saw coming back from the murder scene but were too afraid to call the police about him. The police never recovered DNA from Gyllström. A book released in 2006 brings up the theory in detail. The book also claims that the police almost immediately ignored much more evidence that was previously unknown to the public because of language barriers, among other things.

===Hans Assmann===
Most public suspicion focused on Hans Assmann, a German-born naturalized Finnish citizen, who lived several kilometres from the shore of Lake Bodom. A series of popular books promulgated a theory of Assmann committing the Bodom killings and other murders. It was not taken seriously by the police, as Assmann had an alibi for the night of the Bodom murders (and was said to have been in Germany during the time of another murder). On the morning of June 6, 1960, however, he had shown up at a hospital in Helsinki with bloody clothes. He moved to Sweden, where he also died in the late 1990s. Assmann was also a suspect in five other cases, even confessing to one on his death bed.

=== Pentti Soininen ===
During the mid-1960s, an individual named Pentti Soininen, known for his violent tendencies, claimed to a fellow inmate that he was responsible for the murders that occurred at Lake Bodom. However, he was approximately 14 years old at the time of the murders. Many question whether he could have single-handedly overpowered four older teenagers, casting doubt on his involvement.

==Arrest and trial of Nils Gustafsson==
In late March 2004, almost 44 years after the event, Gustafsson was arrested. In early 2005, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation declared the case was solved based on new forensic analysis. According to the prosecution&#x27;s interpretation of the bloodstains, Gustafsson had been drunk and excluded from the tent when he attacked the other boy, getting his jaw broken in a fight which escalated into him committing three murders.

The trial started on 4 August 2005. Gustafsson&#x27;s defence lawyer argued that the murders were the work of one or more outsiders and that Gustafsson would have been incapable of killing three people given the extent of his injuries. It had always been known that the shoes worn by the killer and hidden by him away from the tent belonged to Gustafsson, who was found barefoot on top of the tent. Modern DNA analysis was significant for the prosecution as it showed that the three murdered victims&#x27; blood was on Gustafsson&#x27;s shoes, but Gustafsson&#x27;s was completely absent.

The prosecution said it followed from the lack of Gustafsson&#x27;s blood on the shoes, that his injuries had occurred at a different time to the attack on the murdered victims, and that the only explanation of this was that Gustafsson had committed the murders, then faked the theft of items by hiding them, further injured himself and then went back to the tent where (now barefoot) he pretended to be unconscious. The prosecution attempted to bolster their case by alleging an identification by two birdwatchers of Gustafsson as the tall blond man at the scene of the crime, an assertion that he had been overheard making an incriminating remark, and also that a decade after the event he had boasted to a woman about his guilt.

On 7 October 2005, Gustafsson was acquitted of all charges. The court explained the verdict as due to the prosecution’s evidence being inconclusive, failure to show Gustafsson had a motive appropriate to a crime of such extreme seriousness, and certainty about the facts now being impossible given the time that had elapsed. The State of Finland paid him €44,900 for the mental suffering caused by the long remand time, but the public prosecutor refused to sue Finnish newspapers for defamation. Gustafsson did not use his right to bring charges against the newspapers as an injured party.

<text>Chief superintendent is a senior rank in police forces, especially in those organised on the British model.

== Rank insignia of chief superintendent ==
== Chief superintendent by country ==
===Australia===
In Australia, a chief superintendent is senior to the rank of superintendent in all the Australian police forces excepting the Western Australia Police. It is junior to the rank of commander (Victoria Police, South Australia Police) and the rank of assistant commissioner (New South Wales Police, Queensland Police). Officers wear the insignia of a crown over two Bath stars (or in the case of the New South Wales Police, a crown over two stars) the same as a colonel in the army.

=== Canada ===
In the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Ontario Provincial Police, a chief superintendent wears two Bath stars (or pips) below a crown, equivalent to a colonel. In the RCMP, the rank falls between superintendent and assistant commissioner. The OPP rank is between superintendent and deputy commissioner or provincial commander.

=== Hong Kong ===

In the Hong Kong Police Force, a chief superintendent of police (CSP) ranks between a senior superintendent (SSP) and an assistant commissioner of police (ACP). A CSP is usually a district commander (DC) or a branch or bureau commander (e.g. Narcotics Bureau). The commandant of the police tactical unit is also a CSP.

=== Ireland ===

In the Garda Síochána, the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s national police force, the rank of chief superintendent is between superintendent and assistant commissioner. Chief superintendents usually command divisions, while detective chief superintendents head the various investigative branches. The rank marking is two red and gold pips over a red and gold bar.

===Japan===
The Japanese Prefectural police forces formerly used this rank. It has now been replaced by the rank of commissioner. A chief superintendent was chief of a prefectural police force and equivalent in rank to a Japanese army major general.

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, a chief superintendent is normally a metropolitan superintendent or the director of a police division. The rank is between superintendent and assistant commissioner.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, chief superintendent is a rank in the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology and the Bureau of Fire Protection. It is above senior superintendent and below bureau director and is regarded as the equivalent of brigadier general in the Philippine Army. It was formerly used by the Philippine National Police.

=== Portugal ===
Chief superintendent () is the highest officer rank in the Public Security Police (PSP) of Portugal. It is senior to the police rank of superintendent, being roughly equivalent to a general officer in the armed forces.

Chiefs superintendents can exercise the roles of national director, deputy national directors, inspector general of the PSP and commanding officers of major police commands.

The basic rank insignia of a chief superintendent consists of dark blue epaulets bordered with silver leaves of oak and with two PSP stars (six points silver stars with the &quot;SP&quot; monogram in the center) in the middle. If exercising the role of national director or deputy national director / inspector general, the chief superintendents use instead, respectively, four and three PSP stars.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the British police, a chief superintendent (Ch Supt; or colloquially &quot;chief super&quot;) is senior to a superintendent and junior to an assistant chief constable (or a commander in the Metropolitan Police or City of London Police).

The rank of chief superintendent was first introduced into the Metropolitan Police in 1949, when superintendents were regraded to the new rank, and has since been adopted in all British police forces. However, the rank had been used previously to this in some forces in certain circumstances. For example, in 1920 the deputy head of Shropshire Constabulary bore the official title of &quot;chief superintendent and deputy chief constable&quot; and in 1927, Lancashire Constabulary had two chief superintendents who were junior to the assistant chief constable.

Between 1949 and 1968, chief superintendent was junior to deputy commander in the Metropolitan Police, and between 1953 and 1974 it was immediately senior to superintendent grade I.

Traditionally, chief superintendents have commanded divisions, but since widespread reorganisation in the 1990s many forces have abandoned divisions for different forms of organisation and the areas commanded by chief superintendents vary widely from force to force. In most forces, however, they still command the largest territorial subdivisions, often known generally as basic command units (BCUs). The rank of chief superintendent was abolished on 1 April 1995 following recommendations made in the Sheehy Report, later confirmed by the Police Act 1996, although officers already holding the rank could continue to hold it. The Home Office officially reintroduced the rank of chief superintendent on 1 January 2002, under the terms of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.

The senior detective and commander of the criminal investigation department in most forces is a detective chief superintendent (DCS or Det Ch Supt) (although in the Metropolitan Police, a DCS may only command a branch of the CID and the head of CID in each district was formerly also a DCS) and the rank of chief superintendent may also be used by the commanders of other headquarters departments.

The rank badge, worn on the epaulettes, is a bath star (&quot;pip&quot;) below a crown, the same rank badge worn by a lieutenant-colonel in the British Army. Metropolitan Police chief superintendents wore a crown over two stars until the abolition of the rank of superintendent grade I in 1974, after which they changed to the latter&#x27;s rank badge, which was already worn by chief superintendents elsewhere in the country.

<text>James Hutchison Stirling (22 June 1820 – 19 March 1909) was a Scottish idealist philosopher and physician. His work &quot;The Secret of Hegel&quot; (1st edition, 1865, in 2 vols.; revised edition, 1898, in 1 vol.) gave great impetus to the study of Hegelian philosophy both in Britain and in the United States, and it was also accepted as an authoritative work on Hegel&#x27;s philosophy in Germany and Italy. The book helped to create the philosophical movement known as British idealism.

==Biography==
James Hutchison Stirling was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the fifth son (and the youngest of six children) of William Stirling (died 14 March 1851) and Elizabeth Christie (d. 1828). William was a wealthy textile manufacturer who was a partner in the Glasgow firm of James Hutchison &amp; Co., which manufactured muslin (lightweight cotton cloth in a plain weave, used for making sheets and for a variety of other purposes). William was known for his deeply-held religious views, many of which strongly influenced his son James.

Stirling studied at Young&#x27;s Academy in Glasgow, followed by nine years of education (1833–1842) at the University of Glasgow, where he studied medicine, history, and classics. He became a Licentiate (1842, medical diploma) and Fellow (1860) of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.

Stirling married Jane Hunter Mair (died 5 July 1903), an old family friend, on 28 April 1847 in Irvine, North Ayrshire, Scotland. The couple had seven children (five daughters and two sons), as follows: Jessie Jane Stirling (born 26 June 1850) (who married Rev. Robert Armstrong of Glasgow), Elizabeth Margaret Stirling (11 February 1852 – 1871), Amelia Hutchison Stirling, Florence Hutchison Stirling (1858 – 6 May 1948), Lucy Stirling, William Stirling, and David Stirling. Stirling&#x27;s daughter Amelia wrote many books on historical subjects, and she was the joint-translatorwith William Hale White (1831–1913)of Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot; (1883). She also wrote a biography of her father James titled &quot;James Hutchison Stirling: His Life and Work&quot; (London and Leipzig: T. Fisher Unwin, 1912). Stirling&#x27;s daughter Florence won the Scottish Ladies&#x27; Championship in chess five times (in 1905, 1906, 1907, 1912, and 1913).

After receiving a large inheritance from his father&#x27;s estate in 1851, Stirling left his medical practice. He then set out to learn French and German, for the purpose of being able to better understand continental philosophical trends. In pursuit of this goal, he moved his family briefly to Boulogne-sur-Mer, France (located in the current Pas-de-Calais department of the Hauts-de-France region), then to Paris for 18 months, then to St. Servan (located two miles from the ferry port of St. Malo in the Ille-et-Vilaine department of the Brittany region of France) for four and a half years, and then finally to Heidelberg, Germany. In November 1857, Stirling and his family took up residence in London (at 3 Wilton Terrace, Kensington), where they lived for about three years. After this, in 1860 Stirling returned to Edinburghhis address there was 4 Laverockbank Road, Trinity, Edinburghwhich then became his permanent residence until the end of his life, and where he wrote on the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) and many other subjects. The primary result of his comprehensive Hegel studies was his influential work &quot;The Secret of Hegel&quot; (2 vols., 1865).

One of Stirling&#x27;s other major philosophical works&quot;Philosophy and Theology&quot; (1890) (consisting of his 20 Gifford Lectures, delivered at the University of Edinburgh in 1889–1890)focuses not on Hegelian philosophical topics, but on Charles Darwin&#x27;s evolutionary theories.

Frederick Copleston (&quot;A History of Philosophy&quot; vol. VII, p. 12) wrote: &quot;we may be inclined to smile at J. H. Stirling&#x27;s picture of Hegel as the great champion of Christianity&quot;.

Stirling died in Edinburgh and is buried in Warriston Cemetery on the north side of the city. His grave lies in the centre of the long, upper section north of the vaults, facing south onto an east–west path.

<doc id="1241933" wikidata="Q1061615" url="?curid=1241933" title="Dalian Shide F.C.">
<text>Dalian Shide was a professional Chinese football club based in Dalian, Liaoning province, China who played in China&#x27;s football league system between 1955 and 2012. Their home stadiums were the 55,843 capacity Dalian People&#x27;s Stadium and then later in 1997 they moved to the 30,776 capacity Jinzhou Stadium.

The club was initially founded in 1955 as Dalian Shipyards and made sporadic appearances within the Chinese national leagues until 1982 when the local Dalian government took ownership of the club and renamed it Dalian Football Club. The club won their first major silverware when they won the 1992 domestic cup title. In 1993, the club was reorganised to become a completely professional football team, renamed themselves Dalian Wanda FC and went on to win the first fully professional 1994 Chinese Jia-A League title. The tycoon Xu Ming and the Shide Group would go on to take over the club rename it Dalian Shide.

Achieving a total of eight league titles from both the Jia A and the rebranded CSL Dalian were the most successful club in Chinese football, while in the Asian Football Confederation the club reached the 1997–98 Asian Club Championship and 2000–01 Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup finals.

The club accumulated a huge debt and was eventually sold and merged into another club, thus becoming defunct.

==History==
The club was founded as Dalian Shipyards in 1955. After the 1982 season the local Dalian government took over its ownership and renamed it Dalian Football Club to represent the city. The club immediately became a major force within the second tier and eventually win promotion to the top level in 1984 when they won the division title. For the next several seasons Dalian were predominantly top tier regulars except for one season in 1989 when they were in the second tier, however they quickly won promotion and soon went on to win their first domestic cup in 1992.
Soon afterwards the Chinese Football Association started to demand full professionalism and sponsorship from all the clubs in China. Dalian went on to be one of the first fully professionalised clubs in China on July 3, 1992. They gained sponsorship in 1993 from the China Hualu group and then the Dalian Wanda Group on March 8, 1994, who changed the club&#x27;s name to Dalian Wanda FC.
In the inaugural fully professional 1994 league season, the club brought in former Chinese national team manager Zhang Honggen to coach the team and under his leadership guide the club to their first ever league title. The following season saw Zhang Honggen decide to not stay on as the club&#x27;s manager and Dalian were unable to retain the league title, however the club eventually brought in former Chinese international player Chi Shangbin into the club as their new manager. With Wang Jianlin and the full support of his company the Dalian Wanda Group taking full ownership of the club, they started to build a football dynasty by winning the 1996 league season undefeated. Domestic dominance continued in the 1997 league season while Dalian narrowly just missed out on 1997–98 Asian Club Championship and Chi Shangbin decided to leave to take on a position with the Chinese national team. Despite this Dalian had a well-funded and prolific academy that produced numerous Chinese internationals such as Zhang Enhua, Li Ming and Sun Jihai and with another former Chinese national team manager Xu Genbao Dalian were easily able to replicate their success by winning the 1998 league title.

In 2000 at the height of their success, Wang Jianlin decided to pull out from football after publicly criticizing Chinese referees for match fixing and he did not return to football until 2011 when his associated Wanda Group sponsored the 2011 Chinese Super League after former Chinese FA Vice-chairmen Xie Yalong and Nan Yong stood on trial for bribery.

On January 9, 2000, Wang Jianlin sold Dalian to Xu Ming and the Shide Group for 120 million Yuan and the club&#x27;s name was changed to Dalian Shide. The new owners brought in Serbian Milorad Kosanović as their new manager and win another league title in the 2000 league season. Kosanović made the men&#x27;s team by far the most successful team in Chinese football by winning the 2001, 2002 league title, 2001 Chinese FA Cup and just missing out on 2000–01 Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup during his reign. When Milorad Kosanović left to coach the Serbia and Montenegro national under-21 football team the club eventually brought in Vladimir Petrović who guided the team to the recently rebranded 2005 Chinese Super League title as well as 2005 Chinese FA Cup. With the retirement of striker Hao Haidong and Vladimir Petrović leaving to take the Chinese national team management position, the club went through an inconsistent period due to team and coach changes. In 2008, Dalian Shide selected a number of players from its academy to play in a satellite team in the S.League in Singapore, called Dalian Shide Siwu FC.

On 14 February 2010, Zhang Yalin died of lymphoma in Dalian, Liaoning, aged 28, after a two-year-battle with the disease.

On 30 November 2012, Dalian Shide were acquired by Aerbin Group and merged into Dalian Aerbin F.C., although a lot of confusion and rumour surrounded the demise of Shide.

<text>The blue-billed teal, spotted teal or Hottentot teal (Spatula hottentota) is a species of dabbling duck of the genus &quot;Spatula&quot;. It is migratory resident in eastern and southern Africa, from Sudan and Ethiopia west to Niger and Nigeria and south to South Africa and Namibia. In west Africa and Madagascar it is sedentary.

The blue-billed teal breed year round, depending on rainfall, and stay in small groups or pairs. They build nests above water in tree stumps and use vegetation. Ducklings leave the nest soon after hatching, and the mother&#x27;s parenting is limited to providing protection from predators and leading young to feeding areas. This species is omnivorous and prefers smaller shallow bodies of water.

The blue-billed teal is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. The status of the blue-billed teal on the IUCN Red List is Least Concern.

Several authorities still refer to this species as the Hottentot teal, however, as the word &quot;Hottentot&quot; is an offensive term for the Khoisan people, there has been a movement to change the vernacular name.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Spatula hottentota&quot; was previously placed in the genus &quot;Anas,&quot; called &quot;Anas punctata.&quot; This name was suppressed owing to confusion over type specimens. It has been also referred as &quot;Anas hottentota&quot;. and &quot;Querquedula hottentota&quot;.

Blue-billed teal is considered monotypic, with no subspecies being recognised.

== Description ==

=== Identification ===
Adult males have dark brown crown contrasting with paler face, throat, breast and side except for a blackish thumb-shaped patch on the ear region. The back of the neck is spotted with black and this spotting extends down through the neck and become intensively spotted on the breast, the spots appear to be larger and less obvious on the light brown flanks and abdomen, and the posterior underparts and under tail coverts becoming vermiculated with black. The scapulars and tail are dark brown to black, the upper wing surface is blackish as well, with the coverts giving a greenish gloss. An iridescent green speculum exists on the secondaries, bounded posteriorly by narrow black and terminal white bars. The iris is brown, the legs and feet are bluish gray, and the bill is light bluish gray with a blackish culmen and nail.

Females have browner crowns, they have less contrasting facial markings and more rounded scapulars, the under tail coverts are not vermiculated, and the wing is less glossy and colorful than that of an adult male.

Juveniles resemble adult females but are duller throughout the body and less distinctively marked with spots. Ducklings have grayish brown underparts and yellowish grey below, the cheeks is paler with pinky puff wash and grey-brown ear patch.

See External Links for duck external anatomy.

=== Measurements and weights ===
The blue-billed teal was described as the smallest known duck by D. D. Thomas and J. B. Condy in 1965.

* Length: 330–350 mm
* Weight: 53-288 g
* Wing: 147–157 mm
* Tail: 55–66 mm
* Bill: 32–42 mm
* Eggs: 43×33 mm in average, creamy, 25 g

== Distribution and habitat ==
The range of the blue-billed teal extends in Africa from Angola, Zambia, eastern Congo, Malawi, northern Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, southern Ethiopia, Sudan and Madagascar. They are mainly found in tropical eastern Africa: Ethiopia to Cape Province, westward to northern Botswana and Namibia, and Madagascar.

See External Links for their distribution map.

The blue-billed teal prefers habitats with abundant floating-leaf plants and fringe vegetations, including shallow fresh-water swamps, marshes, streams, shallow small lakes and ponds with fringed edges of reeds or papyrus. They are observed to spend the twilight and night hours dabbling in very shallow waters and move to deeper and safer parts of the marsh during daytime.

== Behavior ==
The blue-billed teal is sedentary in West Africa and Madagascar but partly migratory elsewhere, following a regular but unpredictable short-distance migration routes (up to 700 km) in southern and eastern Africa in response to changing water levels.

=== Feeding and diet ===
The blue-billed teal prefers feeding at muddy edges, it will also feed on lands and flooded fields like rice paddies, and in waterside that is disturbed heavily by livestock. It feeds in well-vegetated areas by dabbling, swimming or on foot. No diving during foraging is recorded. It is omnivorous, although its diet consists mainly of grass seeds, especially of the grass &quot;Sacciolepis,&quot; however it may also consume aquatic invertebrates almost exclusively such as crustaceans like ostracods, molluscs, water insects such as beetles and their larvae, if these are super abundant.

=== Molt ===
Molt is poorly understood in the blue-billed teal, there is no identified eclipse plumage in males, but breeding males are much brighter than females and the breast spots are more distinct.

=== Vocalization ===
Both sexes produce series of clicking notes, given as harsh &quot;ke-ke-ke&quot; when they are disturbed, during flying or within flock. Males produce a highly distinctive wooden rattling call that sounds like a mechanical rattle, while the female has a typical &quot;quack&quot; and a decrescendo call of only a few notes.

=== Social behavior and reproduction ===
The breeding behavior of the blue-billed teal is relatively undemonstrative. Based on current research, the bond of blue-billed teal does not extend beyond the female&#x27;s incubation period, suggesting the bond is presumably reestablished annually. Although majority of breeding is observed in summer, this species also breed in winter, and thus courtship behavior can be seen throughout the whole year. The most common display in this species is the combination of female inciting and male turning the back of the head. Female blue-billed teal incites males by doing lateral movements silently or nearly silently, and males usually respond by swimming ahead and turning the back of the head. However, the males may respond by drinking, they raise their neck vertically and produce a soft mechanical series of call notes (burping) and they sometimes combine these two displays in a burp-drinking order. Moreover, during social display, the duck frequently perform a wing-flapping and both-wing-stretch sequence of behavior that seems to be a significant part of the display. Pre-copulatory behavior consists of mutual head pumping, and post-copulatory display by the male may vary from no perceptible activity to a swimming shake, wing flapping, or burping. The female most usually only bathes after copulation. The cluster size for this species ranges from 6 to 8 eggs with 7 being the most frequently encountered number. However, based on Clark&#x27;s observation on the Witwatersrand, the ducklings in families ranges from 1 to 7 with 3 predominating. Incubation period ranges from 25 to 27 days for naturally incubated clutches. The male may remain nearby as the female incubates, but there is no indication of further male participation in brood rearing. So far as is known, the species is not multiple-brooded, although nest failure may lead to re-nesting.

== Status and conservation ==
It is a least concern species on the IUCN Red List. However, habitat degradation is a threat to this species. Protecting wetland and waterside vegetation and controlling hunting will help maintain the population.

<doc id="1241939" wikidata="Q880457" url="?curid=1241939" title="Edgar Whitcomb">
<text>Edgar Doud Whitcomb (November 6, 1917 – February 4, 2016) was an American attorney, writer and politician, who served as the 43rd governor of Indiana. His term as governor began a major rift in the Indiana Republican Party as urban Republicans became more numerous than rural Republicans, leading to a shift in the priorities of the party leadership.

Whitcomb found himself opposed by speaker of the house Otis R. Bowen on a number of measures and for control of the party leadership. Despite his opposition, Whitcomb was able to increase tax revenue by 8% without raising tax rates through improved collection and auditing techniques, created a panel of business leaders to recommend governmental reforms aimed at increasing efficiency that allowed the state to reduce its workforce by 10% and fought for a number of budgetary saving measures primarily through reducing state employee wages and spending in non-essential areas.

After leaving office, Whitcomb ran for the U.S. Senate in 1976 but was defeated in the Republican primary by Indianapolis Mayor Richard Lugar. Whitcomb returned to the practice of law and moved to Seymour, Indiana. In 1985, he retired, divorced from his wife of thirty-three years and took up sailboating. He sailed around the Mediterranean Sea, across the Atlantic Ocean in 1990 and geographically sailed around the world in 1995, although he was not able to return to his exact starting point, because his ship ran aground on a reef in the Gulf of Suez. After two days of trying to free the ship, he made the decision to abandon it. Returning to Indiana, he moved to a secluded log cabin on the banks of the Ohio River within the Hoosier National Forest near Rome, Indiana in 2000. He married for a second time in 2013 and died in 2016, aged 98.

==Early life==

===Family and military career===
Whitcomb was born on November 6, 1917, in Hayden, Indiana, the second child and first son of John Whitcomb and Louise Doud Whitcomb. An outgoing and athletic youth, he was a member of his high school basketball team. He entered Indiana University in 1939 to study law, but quit school to join the military at the outbreak of World War II.

He enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps in 1940 and was deployed to the Pacific Theater. He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1941 and made an aerial navigator. He served two tours of duty in the Philippines and was promoted to First Lieutenant. During the Philippines Campaign, Whitcomb&#x27;s base was overrun; he was captured by the Japanese and was beaten and tortured by his captors, but was able to escape. Recaptured a few days later, he escaped a second time and was hunted for several more days but was able to evade his pursuers. He escaped by swimming all night through shark-infested waters to an island unoccupied by the Japanese army. He was eventually able to secure passage to China under an assumed name where he made contact with the United States Army and was repatriated in December 1943. He wrote a book about his experience entitled &quot;Escape from Corregidor&quot;, published in 1958. He was discharged from active duty in 1946, but he remained in the reserve military forces until 1977 holding the rank of colonel.

Following the war, he returned to and graduated from Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. He met and married Patricia Dolfuss on May 10, 1953, and the couple had five children. One of his children, his daughter Trish, lost a race for the Indiana House of Representatives in the November 5, 2024 elections, where she ran as a democrat.

===Early political career===

Whitcomb was a member of the Republican Party. He was first elected to public office in 1950, serving for three years in the Indiana State Senate before resigning to begin his law practice. Indiana General Assembly sessions were held biennially during his time in that legislative body; there were no sessions scheduled to convene while he was still in office.

Whitcomb passed the bar exam in 1954 and began a law practice. He set up a successful law firm in North Vernon, but in later years he moved his practice, having offices in both Seymour and Indianapolis. His law practice helped him build his political base for a run for statewide office.

In 1966, Whitcomb was elected to serve as Indiana Secretary of State, a position he used to springboard for his political career. He was appointed by the Governor of Indiana to serve on the Great Lakes Compact Commission, a commission with representatives from the Great Lake states who oversaw joint projects for preserving and developing the Great Lakes. He held both offices concurrently until his resignation in December 1968.

==Governor==

===Election and infighting===
At the 1968 Republican state convention, Whitcomb competed to win the nomination for governor against Indiana House of Representatives minority leader Otis R. Bowen and future Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. Backed by the party leaders of several large counties, Whitcomb overcame Bowen and Butz to secure the nomination. Bowen, after being nominated for governor in 1972, advocated the nomination of candidates for governor and US Senator by primary elections. Whitcomb&#x27;s opponent in the general election was Democratic candidate Robert L. Rock, and the campaign focused largely on tax policy and national issues. Although Democrats had taken strong majorities in the state government in the past two elections, the 1968 election returned the Republicans to power, giving them strong majorities in the General Assembly, and a win in all the congressional and statewide elections, except one. Whitcomb was among the beneficiaries of the cycle and took office on January 13, 1969.

During his term, the state adopted a new districting system that for the first time granted more seats in the Indiana General Assembly to urban areas. The situation created by the new development caused a split in the party between the urban and rural Republicans. Urban Republicans and their representatives tended to favor increasing government-provided services and spending, while the rural Republicans tended to favor reduced spending and more limited government. Whitcomb found himself in party with the rural Republicans, while Bowen, who had become speaker of the house, grew to become a leader among the urban members. Whitcomb vetoed a number of spending bills passed by the assembly and began a fight for control of the party leadership. Whitcomb suffered a stunning political setback on November 25, 1970, when aides failed to block what the &quot;Indianapolis News&quot; called &quot;a unanimous vote&quot; to elect former Whitcomb supporter and State Treasurer John K. Snyder to the post of Republican Party chairman. The &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot;, under the front-page banner &quot;Snyder to Head State GOP&quot; on Nov 25, chronicled the Whitcomb political disaster. Highlighting the depth of the defeat, then-President Richard Nixon personally wrote Snyder on December 15, 1970, to express his personal support. (In later years Whitcomb and Snyder resumed their former friendship, which in 1970 was described by the &quot;Indianapolis News&quot; as &quot;bitter.&quot;) In a hardball political move following Snyder&#x27;s election, Whitcomb diverted Republican political contributions to a special fund in the Governor&#x27;s office and nearly bankrupted the state party. Snyder subsequently resigned from his leadership position and Whitcomb installed a new chairman, Jim Neal, a newspaper editor from Noblesville, who remained friendly to his positions, but neutral at the 1972 convention. Contemporaneously, Whitcomb resumed collection of the fund to state party coffers. Bowen, meanwhile, had been able to install a number of people in key county leadership positions that effectively gave his wing of the party real control.

===Government efficiency reforms===
Despite the party infighting, Whitcomb was able to successfully advocate for the passage of a number of bills to expand the state highway system, to repeal laws passed during his predecessors’ terms that distributed funds to the county governments and to computerize both the state&#x27;s criminal records and its Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Significant constitutional development took place during his term. Also on the ballot during his election campaign were a number of constitutional amendments, among them a reorganization of the state court system, changing the legislatures sessions to occur annually rather than biennially, a change that would allow governors to begin serving consecutive terms again, and the placing of a new cabinet in the constitution. Whitcomb however, could not run for a second term because he had been elected under the prior version of the constitution. Another significant event occurred during his first months in office when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the pocket veto was unconstitutional, which passed into law several bills that had been pocket vetoed by his predecessors. Whitcomb requested that General Assembly pass an act repealing all laws that were enacted because of the Supreme Court decision, some of which were nearly a century old. The assembly complied with the request and passed a blanket repeal.

Indiana&#x27;s income had been problematic in the two decades preceding Whitcomb&#x27;s term and had necessitated major tax increases to fund the growing budget. Whitcomb had committed to not increasing the tax burden on the state in his campaign, but the state was not permitted to take on debt and was in need to growing its reserve funds. To increase the budget surplus, Whitcomb embarked on a number of cost reduction measures that required no legislative support. He created by executive order a commission of sixty business leaders to examine the entire operation of the state government and recommend changes to improve its operational efficiency. He used their findings to alter work flows that resulted in an annual savings of $12 million. They also made recommendations that would improve the efficiency of state taxes through better auditing techniques that once implemented raised state revenue by 8%. Additional savings were realized when because of the vastly improved government efficiency, less staff was needed to complete the work allowing the state to cut its workforce by 10%. Whitcomb also saved money by withholding non-mandatory pay raises for most state employees.

Whitcomb&#x27;s cost savings plans were strongly opposed by the state teachers’ union, Democrats and a large part of the urban Republicans aggregate. The public, however, was pleased with Whitcomb&#x27;s actions and he left office with a high approval rating on January 8, 1973. After leaving office he returned to his law practice.

==Later years==

In 1976, Whitcomb sought the Republican nomination to the United States Senate, but was defeated in the primary by Indianapolis Mayor Richard Lugar. He then returned to his private law practice which in turn he soon moved to Seymour, Indiana. He served several years as the director of the Mid American World Trade Association and took a job for a media company based in Indianapolis and spent time traveling the United States setting up a network of FM radio stations.

Whitcomb retired from his law practice in 1985, at age 68. He and his wife divorced in 1986 after a thirty-three-year marriage. Whitcomb&#x27;s second book, &quot;On Celestial Wings&quot;, was published in 1995. Whitcomb took up sailing as a hobby and purchased a boat. He sailed solo around the Mediterranean, across the Atlantic and with Jeff La Dage in the Pacific Ocean. In 1995, while attempting to sail around the world, his ship hit a reef in the Gulf of Suez and sank. He was rescued and returned to the United States. He wrote a book about his sailing experiences that was published in 2011, titled &quot;Cilin II : a solo sailing odyssey&quot;. In 2000 he purchased a secluded cabin in Rome, Indiana, on the Ohio River within the Hoosier National Forest. The home has electricity, although cabins he owned did not, and he spent most of his time there gardening, fishing and chopping firewood. During his last public interview in 2004, he told a reporter that he never reads the newspaper and was totally uninvolved in anything, and that he was &quot;living in heaven.&quot; He married his long-time partner Evelyn Gayer in a private ceremony at their home in February 2013.

Whitcomb died in his sleep on February 4, 2016, at his home in Rome, Indiana, at the age of 98. He was the last living former American governor born in the 1910s. He is buried at Hayden Cemetery, in his hometown of Hayden, Indiana.

His granddaughter through his first wife is the actress Patty Guggenheim.

<doc id="1241940" wikidata="Q654901" url="?curid=1241940" title="Philippine duck">
<text>The Philippine duck (Anas luzonica) is a large dabbling duck of the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. Its native name is papan or patong gubat which translates to &quot;forest duck&quot; in Filipinos. It is the only endemic duck in the Philippines but has been recorded as a vagrant in Taiwan and Japan. Its habitat in a wide variety of wetlands from mountain lakes, marshes, small pools, streams, rivers, salt pans and even coastal waters where it feeds on shrimp, fish, insects and plant matter. This species has declined considerably since the 1960s because of hunting and habitat loss and is now listed as a Vulnerable species. 

==Description==
The Philippine duck is a large conspicuous duck. It has a black crown, nape and eye stripe, with a cinnamon head and neck. The rest of its body is greyish brown with a bright green speculum. Its legs are greyish brown, and its bill is bluish-grey. The female is somewhat smaller than the male, but is otherwise the same.

==Taxonomy==
The Philippine duck is a dabbling duck and a member of the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. It has no subspecies and so it is monotypic. It belongs to the Pacific clade of &quot;Anas&quot; along with the koloa, the Laysan duck, the Pacific black duck, and the extinct Mariana mallard.

The scientific name comes from the Latin &quot;Anas,&quot; &#x27;duck&#x27; and the Philippine island Luzon.

It is known in the Philippines as &quot;papan&quot; or &quot;patong gubat.&quot; 

==Distribution and habitat==
The Philippine duck is known to inhabit all of the major Philippine islands and 8 minor islands, but since the 1980s most sightings have been on Luzon and Mindanao. Long-distance vagrants have been sighted in Okinawa and Taiwan.

It is found in all types of wetlands within its range, but its preferred habitat is shallow freshwater marshland.

== Ecology and behavior ==
The diet of the Philippine duck includes plants, rice, molluscs and crustaceans. It is also reported to also feed fish, froggs and insects. It is reported to be a pest in farms as they supposedly damage newly sown fields and germinating seeds. This species is more active in the early morning, evening and bright moonlit nights. Typically seen in pairs or small groups but flocks of up to 2,000 have been seen, possibly even larger before this species was heavily hunted. It is seen associating with other ducks including Wandering whistling duck, Garganey, Northern shoveler, Eurasian wigeon and Tufted duck.

Not much is known about its breeding habits in the wild. Nests found were well concealed with 10 eggs. Breeding season is believed to be March to November with the peak in July to August. Incubation takes 25 to 27 days and only the female incubates. Fledging occurs at around 8 weeks. 

== Conservation status ==
The Philippine duck is rated vulnerable on the IUCN Red List with the population estimated to be 3,300 - 6,700 mature individuals remaining. The species has experienced steep population decreases since the 1970s mainly due to hunting and habitat loss. The ducks have been heavily hunted since the 1960s with thousands being hunted a year through the late 1980s.

Habitat loss is mainly due to wetland drainage, aquaculture, mangrove destruction and fishpond creation. Up to 10,000 birds were previously recorded in the Candaba Swamp but this area has since been mostly converted into farmland and is also heavily hunted.

The species occurs in multiple protected areas including Manleluag Spring Protected Landscape, Mounts Iglit-Baco National Park, Naujan Lake National Park, Bataan National Park, Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park, Las Piñas-Parañaque Wetland Park and Olango Island, a Ramsar wetland. However, as is with most of the Philippines enforcement from hunting is lax.

<doc id="1241942" wikidata="Q4764221" url="?curid=1241942" title="Angus Og (comics)">
<text>Angus Og (originally Angus Òg) is a comic strip created by Scottish cartoonist Ewen Bain. It ran from 1960 to December 1989, first in the Glasgow &quot;Bulletin&quot; and then in the &quot;Daily Record&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Mail&quot;.

==Background==
Set on the fictional island of Drambeg (&quot;dràma beag&quot;, a wee dram) in the Utter Hebrides (Outer Hebrides in Scots slang), it featured the eponymous Angus Og, and a whole host of other characters, including: 
*Mrs Og, Angus&#x27;s mother, and facially his virtual twin, distinguishable from Angus only by a headscarf and apron
*Donald, Angus&#x27;s brother
*Lachie Mor, Angus&#x27;s best friend
*Mairileen, Angus&#x27;s erstwhile girlfriend, who is rarely seen without her black beret, and Bain&#x27;s Hebridean homage to Marilyn Monroe
*Mr MacSonachan, the Minister
*Rosie the Highland Cow
*Granny McBrochan, the local spey-wife
*Constable McPhater

The first story, published in the &quot;Bulletin&quot; in 1960, introduced Angus Og as a &#x27;Highland beatnik&#x27;, under the title &quot;A Teenage Tangle of the Isles&quot;. &quot;Òg&quot; is Scottish Gaelic for &quot;young&quot;, and &quot;Angus&quot; was seen as a stereotypical Highland first name. Angus Og was also the name of a figure in Gaelic mythology, a kind of love god, and a Scottish historical figure, a Lord of the Isles: it is possible that the name was an ironic reference to this.

Bain used eye dialect for the strip to approximate (and knowingly stereotype) a Western Isles accent: hence &quot;chentleman&quot; (&quot;gentleman&quot;), &quot;Tonald&quot; (&quot;Donald&quot;), &quot;effery&quot; (&quot;every&quot;) as well as aspects of Scots, such as &quot;bachle&quot; (clumsy or useless person), &quot;crater&quot; (creature) and the near-ubiquitous &quot;Ochone!&quot; (Oh no!) whenever things went wrong, as they invariably did. Given the largely Lowland readership of the &quot;Daily Record&quot;, Bain used virtually no Gaelic beyond Angus&#x27;s name, and the occasional &quot;Ciamar a tha thu?&quot; (&quot;How are you?&quot;). Whenever the story featured Glasgow or Glaswegians (Angus&#x27;s relatives all seemed to come from Glasgow), Bain took a similar approach, resembling the &quot;Parliamo Glasgow&quot; stereotype popularised by Stanley Baxter.

Angus Og has been described as the &quot;archetypal cartoon teuchter&quot;. When he leaves the confines of the islands to go on holiday abroad, he still wears his wellington boots on the beach.

Bain wrote over 100 stories during the strip&#x27;s 28-year existence. Most stories ran to around 70 daily instalments, around 2 months each. However several were shorter. The final story, &quot;The Devil to Pay&quot;, was unfinished at the time of Bain&#x27;s death.

The original strips are now held at the Skye and Lochalsh Archive Centre at Portree, having been donated by Bain&#x27;s daughter in 2019. In 2022, plans to digitise and conserve the collection were announced. A touring exhibition in 2024, beginning at the Mitchell Library in Glasgow and subsequently in libraries across western Highland, showcased many of the original strips.

==Plots==
Originally, Bain introduced an element of fantasy to the stories, with Angus befriended by a &#x27;wee man&#x27;, a fairy-like spirit who helps him become a pop star chanter player. However, after joining the &quot;Daily Record&quot;, Bain was persuaded to ground the stories in more real-life situations, often featuring topical issues such as the change from and to British Summer Time (an issue of considerable controversy in the Highlands) and featuring figures such as the Prime Minister of the day. Bain himself was politically a supporter of Scottish independence and many of the strips satirised Westminster politics.

Following publication of &quot;The Kelpie&quot; between November 1983 and January 1984, a story involving the return of salmon to the upper Clyde, Bain was presented with a certificate from the Clyde River Purification Board in recognition of him raising awareness of the issue of river quality.

Some of the other memorable storylines included Drambeg being towed away to the Caribbean one night, and the islanders experiencing their own version of &quot;Whisky Galore&quot;.

==Angus Og of Puckermuck Cove==
A comic strip of the same name also appeared in Canada, as part of the Puckermuck Cove series, but was completely unrelated. The character hosted a website entitled &quot;Every Celtic Thing on the Web&quot; until 2000. It was created by Michael D. McNeill 

==Books==
Four collections have been published, two in Bain&#x27;s lifetime. Most feature complete stories, and together contain about a dozen complete, with the 21st anniversary collection featuring extracts only. As of 2015 all are out of print.

<text>Hylaeosaurus ( ; Greek: / &quot;belonging to the forest&quot; and / &quot;lizard&quot;) is a herbivorous ankylosaurian dinosaur that lived about 136 million years ago, in the late Valanginian stage of the early Cretaceous period of England. It was found in the Grinstead Clay Formation.

&quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; was one of the first dinosaurs to be discovered, in 1832 by Gideon Mantell. In 1842 it was one of the three dinosaurs Richard Owen based the Dinosauria on, the others being &quot;Iguanodon&quot; and &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. Four species were named in the genus, but only the type species &quot;Hylaeosaurus armatus&quot; is today considered valid. Only limited remains have been found of &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; and much of its anatomy is unknown. It might have been a basal nodosaurid, although a recent cladistic analysis recovers it as a basal ankylosaurid.

&quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; was about five metres long. It was an armoured dinosaur that carried at least three long spines on its shoulder.

==History of discovery==

The first &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; fossils were discovered in the Grinstead Clay Formation, West Sussex. On 20 July 1832, fossil collector Gideon Mantell wrote to Professor Benjamin Silliman that when a gunpowder explosion had demolished a quarry rock face in Tilgate Forest, several of the boulders freed showed the bones of a saurian. A local fossil dealer had assembled the about fifty pieces, described by him as a &quot;great consarn of bites and boanes&quot;. Having doubts about the value of the fragments, Mantell had nevertheless purchased the pieces and soon discovered they could be united into a single skeleton, partially articulated. Mantell was delighted with the find because previous specimens of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and &quot;Iguanodon&quot; had consisted of single bone elements. The discovery in fact represented the most complete non-avian dinosaur skeleton known at the time. He was strongly inclined to describe the find as belonging to the latter genus, but during a visit by William Clift, the curator of the Royal College of Surgeons of England museum, and his assistant John Edward Gray, he began to doubt the identification. Clift was the first to point out that several plates and spikes were probably part of a body armour, attached to the back or sides of the rump. In November 1832 Mantell decided to create a new generic name: &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot;. It is derived from the Greek ὑλαῖος, &quot;hylaios&quot;, &quot;of the wood&quot;. Mantell originally claimed the name &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; meant &quot;forest lizard&quot;, after the Tilgate Forest in which it was discovered. Later, he claimed that it meant &quot;Wealden lizard&quot; (&quot;wealden&quot; being another word for &quot;forest&quot;), in reference to the Wealden Group, the name for the early Cretaceous geological formation in which the dinosaur was first found.
On 30 November Mantell sent the piece to the Geological Society of London. Shortly afterwards he himself went to London and on 5 December during a meeting of the Society, in which he for the first time personally met Richard Owen, reported on the find to large acclaim. However, he was also informed that a paper he had already prepared, was a third too long. On advice of his friend Charles Lyell, Mantell decided instead of rewriting the paper, to publish an entire book on his fossil finds and dedicate a chapter to &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot;. Within three weeks Mantell composed the volume from earlier notes. On 17 December Henry De la Beche warned him that the changed conventions in nomenclature implied that only he who provided a full species name was recognised as the author: to &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; a specific name needed to be added. Mantell on 19 December chose &quot;armatus&quot;, Latin for &quot;armed&quot; or &quot;armoured&quot;, in reference to the spikes and armour plates. As Mantell himself put it: &quot;there appears every reason to conclude that either its back was armed with a formidable row of spines, constituting a dermal fringe, or that its tail possessed the same appendage&quot;. In May 1833 his &quot;The Geology of the South-East of England&quot; appeared, hereby validly naming the type species &quot;Hylaeosaurus armatus&quot;. Mantell published a lithograph of his find in &quot;The Geology of the South-East of England&quot;; and another drawing in the fourth edition of &quot;The Wonders of Geology&quot;, in 1840.
&quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; is the most obscure of the three animals used by Sir Richard Owen to first define the new group Dinosauria, in 1842, the other genera being &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. Not only has &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; received less public attention, despite being included in the life-sized models by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins placed in the Crystal Palace Park, it also never functioned as a &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot;. Owen in 1840 developed a new hypothesis about the spikes; noting they were asymmetrical he correctly rejected the notion they formed a row on the back but incorrectly assumed they were gastralia or belly-ribs.

The original specimen, recovered by Gideon Mantell from the Tilgate Forest, was in 1838 acquired by the Natural History Museum of London. It has the inventory number NHMUK PV OR 3775 (earlier BMNH 3775). It was found in a layer of the Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation dating from the Valanginian, about 137 million years old. This holotype is the best specimen and is composed of the front end of a skeleton minus most of the head and the forelimbs, though only the parts on the face of the stone block are easily studied. The block measures about 135 by 75 centimetres. The holotype consists of the rear of the skull and perhaps lower jaws, ten vertebrae, both scapulae, both coracoids and several spikes and armour plates. The skeleton is viewed from below. For a long time no further preparation had taken place, beyond the assembly and chiselling out by Mantell himself, but in the early twenty-first century the museum began to further free the bones by both chemical and mechanical means. This has proven difficult because the acids used tended to dissolve the glue and gypsum with which the fossils had been repaired, causing the blocks to fall apart. The limited information gained by the preparations by Mark Graham since 2003, was published in 2020, together with a revised description.

Several finds from the mainland of Britain have been referred to &quot;Hylaeosaurus armatus&quot;. However, in 2011 Paul Barrett and Susannah Maidment concluded that only the holotype could with certainty be associated with the species, in view of the presence of &quot;Polacanthus&quot; in the same layers.
Additional remains have been referred to &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot;, from the Isle of Wight, (the Ardennes of) France, Bückeberg Formation, Germany, Spain and Romania. The remains from France may actually belong to &quot;Polacanthus&quot; and the other references are today also considered dubious. However, possible remains were reported from Germany in 2013: a spike, specimen DLM 537 and the lower end of a humerus, specimen GPMM A3D.3, which were referred to a &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; sp.

=== Later species ===

&quot;Hylaeosaurus armatus&quot; Mantell 1833 is currently considered the only valid species in the genus. However, three others have been named. In 1844, Mantell named &quot;Hylaeosaurus oweni&quot; based on the same specimen as &quot;H. armatus&quot;, wanting to honour Richard Owen. This has been sunk as a junior objective synonym of &quot;H. armatus&quot;. In 1956 Alfred Romer renamed &quot;Regnosaurus&quot; into &quot;Hylaeosaurus northhamptoni&quot;. &quot;Polacanthus&quot; Owen 1865 was by Walter Coombs in 1971 renamed into &quot;Hylaeosaurus foxii&quot;. These last two names have found no acceptance; &quot;H. foxii&quot; remained an invalid &quot;nomen ex dissertatione&quot;. It has also been suggested that &quot;Polacanthus&quot; is simply the same species as &quot;Hylaeosaurus armatus&quot; and thus a junior synonym, but there are a number of differences in their osteology.

Sometimes bones from the &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; material have later been made separate species. In 1928 Franz Nopcsa made specimen BMNH 2584, a left scapula referred by Mantell to &quot;H. armatus&quot;, part of the type material of &quot;Polacanthoides ponderosus&quot;. Though in 1978 synonymised with &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot;, &quot;Polacanthoides&quot; is today considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, an indeterminate member of the Thyreophora.

==Description==
Gideon Mantell originally estimated that &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; was about long, or about half the size of the other two original dinosaurs, &quot;Iguanodon&quot; and &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. At the time, he modelled the animal after a modern lizard. Modern estimates range up to in length. Gregory S. Paul in 2010 estimated the length at , the weight at . Some estimates are considerably lower: in 2001 Darren Naish e.a. gave a length of .

Many details about the build of &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; are unknown, especially if the material is strictly limited to the holotype. Maidment gave two autapomorphies, unique derived traits: the scapula did not fuse with the coracoid, even when the animal was of a considerable size; there were three long spines on its shoulder. Even these traits are not very distinctive: Mantell and Owen had attributed the lack of fusion to ontogeny and the total number of spines cannot be observed. &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; is often styled as a fairly typical nodosaur, with rows of armour plating on the back and tail combined with a relatively long head, equipped with a beak used to crop low-lying vegetation.

In 2001 the skull and lower jaws remains were described by Kenneth Carpenter. The damaged and shifted skull elements provided little information. The quadrate is laterally bowed. The quadratojugal has a high attachment point on the shaft of the quadrate. A triangular postorbital horn was present. In 2020, it was concluded that the presumed quadrate was in fact the jugal.

Several distinguishing traits were established in 2020. On the shoulder blade, there is a sharp angle of 120° between the acromion and the proximal plate. The acromial process is shelf-shaped instead of thumb-like or folded, from a point positioned at a third from the top edge projecting obliquely to below and sideways instead of strictly laterally. The top edge of the proximal plate is curved sideways. The sides of the centra of the neck vertebrae show a horizontal ridge. Apart from these autapomorphies, the undersides of the side processes of the back vertebrae are exceptionally concave.

The spines at the shoulder are curved to the rear, long, flattened, narrow and pointed. Their underside shows a shallow trough. The front spine is the longest at 42.5 centimetres; to the rear the spines become gradually shorter and wider. A fourth spine, of about the same build but more forward-pointing, is present immediately behind the skull. In 2013 Sven Sachs and Jahn Hornung suggested a configuration in which there were five lateral neck spines, the new German spine having a morphology adapted to fit in the third position.

==Phylogeny==
&quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; was the first ankylosaur discovered. Until well into the twentieth century its exact affinities would remain uncertain. In 1978 Coombs assigned it to the Nodosauridae within the Ankylosauria. This is still a usual classification, &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; being recovered as a basal nodosaurid in most exact cladistic analyses, sometimes more precisely as a member of the Polacanthinae, and thus being related to &quot;Gastonia&quot; and &quot;Polacanthus&quot;. However, in the 1990s, the polacanthines were sometimes seen as basal ankylosaurids, because they were mistakenly believed to have small tail-clubs. A more popular alternative today is that they formed a Polacanthidae, a basal group outside of the nodosaurids + ankylosaurids clade.

A 2012 study finding &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; to be a basal nodosaurid but not a polacanthine is shown in this cladogram:
It was defined as a non-ankylosaurine ankylosaurid in a phylogenetic analysis by Zheng &quot;et al&quot;. (2018). Below is a simplified cladogram from that study:

In one of two phylogenetic analyses by Xing &quot;et al&quot;. (2024) &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; is resolved as a non-euankylosaur ankylosaur. Below is a simplified cladogram from that study. Zheng &quot;et al&quot;. (2018) dataset + &quot;Datai&quot; (14-taxon deletion):

<doc id="1241957" wikidata="Q917490" url="?curid=1241957" title="Meller's duck">
<text>Meller&#x27;s duck (Anas melleri) is a species of the dabbling duck genus &quot;Anas&quot;. It is endemic to eastern Madagascar. Although a population was established on Mauritius in the mid-18th century, this is on the verge of extinction due to habitat loss and competition by feral domestic ducks. The species name of this species is after the botanist Charles James Meller, and its generic name is from the Latin for &quot;duck&quot;.

== Description ==

The Meller&#x27;s duck resembles a large female mallard. At , it averages slightly larger than a mallard and is at the top size for the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. However, as opposed to most mallard relatives, they lack a supercilium. The speculum feathers are green as in some of its relatives, but unlike in these, it is bordered white as in the mallard. Its body is dark brown with narrow paler fringes to feathers on upper parts and wider fringes on lower parts. Its bill is pale grey, with dark patches at the base, and is larger than normal. Its feet and legs are orange.

== Behaviour ==
Meller&#x27;s duck breeds apparently during most of the year except May–June on Madagascar, dependent on local conditions; the Mauritian population has been recorded to breed in October and November. Unlike most of their closer relatives—with the exception of the African black duck—they are fiercely territorial during the breeding season; furthermore, pairs remain mated until the young are independent.

== Conservation ==
This species is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN Red List. The Lac Alaotra wetlands, where historically the largest number of these birds was to be found, have suffered habitat destruction on a large scale in the latter half of the 20th century, and local waterbird populations have declined dramatically. The Madagascar pochard was rediscovered in 2006, though not in the Lac Alaotra area.

The conservation of this species was long hampered by its—entirely erroneous, see below—dismissal as a variant of the mallard which deserved no special interest. Due to its drab plumage and territorial habits, this species is not very popular among aviculturalists, although it reproduces readily in captivity like most ducks if enough space and good habitat are provided. Although a captive breeding program exists (part of the European Endangered Species Programme), the species is not very often kept in zoos either; it can be more frequently seen in Europe, such as in EEP members Cologne Zoo, Edinburgh Zoo, Durrell Wildlife Park, and Zürich Zoo.

== Relations ==
Due to the outward similarity of Meller&#x27;s duck to the female mallard, it was commonly placed close to that species. Based on records of quasi-forced hybridization under unnatural conditions, it was even proposed to be a mere color morph of the mallard.

Nowadays, it is regarded as one of the most distinct species in the mallard group, based on behavioural and mtDNA D-loop sequence comparisons. Its closest relatives is apparently the yellow-billed duck, another early divergence of the mallard clade, in which these species and the African black duck are basal, but the exact relationships of Meller&#x27;s and the yellow-billed ducks to that species are fairly obscure. (The dates in these studies are probably far too recent in the face of the Early Pleistocene fossil record of mallards and the crude methodology used to arrive at the estimate.)

<doc id="1241965" wikidata="Q12688575" url="?curid=1241965" title="Drilling rig">
<text>A drilling rig is an integrated system that drills wells, such as oil or water wells, or holes for piling and other construction purposes, into the earth&#x27;s subsurface. Drilling rigs can be massive structures housing equipment used to drill water wells, oil wells, or natural gas extraction wells, or they can be small enough to be moved manually by one person and such are called augers. Drilling rigs can sample subsurface mineral deposits, test rock, soil and groundwater physical properties, and also can be used to install sub-surface fabrications, such as underground utilities, instrumentation, tunnels or wells. Drilling rigs can be mobile equipment mounted on trucks, tracks or trailers, or more permanent land or marine-based structures (such as oil platforms, commonly called &#x27;offshore oil rigs&#x27; even if they don&#x27;t contain a drilling rig). The term &quot;rig&quot; therefore generally refers to the complex equipment that is used to penetrate the surface of the Earth&#x27;s crust.

Small to medium-sized drilling rigs are mobile, such as those used in mineral exploration drilling, blast-hole, water wells and environmental investigations. Larger rigs are capable of drilling through thousands of metres of the Earth&#x27;s crust, using large &quot;mud pumps&quot; to circulate drilling fluid (slurry) through the bit and up the casing annulus, for cooling and removing the &quot;cuttings&quot; while a well is drilled. Hoists in the rig, a derrick, can lift hundreds of tons of pipe. Other equipment can force acid or sand into reservoirs to facilitate extraction of the oil or natural gas; and in remote locations there can be permanent living accommodation and catering for crews (which may be more than a hundred). Marine rigs may operate thousands of miles distant from the supply base with infrequent crew rotation or cycle.

==History==

Until internal combustion engines were developed in the late 19th century, the main method for drilling rock was muscle power of man or animal. The technique of oil drilling through percussion or rotary drilling has its origins dating back to the ancient Chinese Han dynasty in 100 BC, where percussion drilling was used to extract natural gas in the Sichuan province. Early oil and gas drilling methods were seemingly primitive as it required several technical skills. The skills involved the availability of heavy iron bits and long bamboo poles, the manufacturing of long and sturdy cables woven from bamboo fiber, and levers. Heavy iron bits were attached to long bamboo cables suspended from bamboo derricks and then were repeatedly raised and dropped into a manually dug hole by having two to six men jumping on a lever. Han dynasty oil wells made by percussion drilling was effective but only reached 10 meters deep and 100 meters by the 10th century. By the 16th century, the Chinese were exploring and drilling oil wells more than deep. Chinese well drilling technology was introduced to Europe in 1828. A modernized variant of the ancient Chinese drilling technique was used by American businessman Edwin Drake to drill Pennsylvania&#x27;s first oil well in 1859 using small steam engines to power the drilling process rather than by human muscle. Cable tool drilling was developed in ancient China and was used for drilling brine wells. The salt domes also held natural gas, which some wells produced and which was used for evaporation of the brine. 
Drake learned of cable tool drilling from Chinese laborers in the U.S. The first primary product was kerosene for lamps and heaters. Similar developments around Baku fed the European market.

In the 1970s, outside of the oil and gas industry, roller bits using mud circulation were replaced by the first pneumatic reciprocating piston Reverse Circulation (RC) drills, and became essentially obsolete for most shallow drilling, and are now only used in certain situations where rocks preclude other methods. RC drilling proved much faster and more efficient, and continues to improve with better metallurgy, deriving harder, more durable bits, and compressors delivering higher air pressures at higher volumes, enabling deeper and faster penetration. Diamond drilling has remained essentially unchanged since its inception.

==Petroleum drilling industry==

Oil and natural gas drilling rigs are used not only to identify geologic reservoirs, but also used to create holes that allow the extraction of oil or natural gas from those reservoirs. Primarily in onshore oil and gas fields once a well has been drilled, the drilling rig will be moved off of the well and a service rig (a smaller rig) that is purpose-built for completions will be moved on to the well to get the well on line. This frees up the drilling rig to drill another hole and streamlines the operation as well as allowing for specialization of certain services, i.e. completions vs. drilling.

==Mining drilling industry==
Mining drilling rigs are used for two main purposes, exploration drilling which aims to identify the location and quality of a mineral, and production drilling, used in the production-cycle for mining. Drilling rigs used for rock blasting for surface mines vary in size dependent on the size of the hole desired, and is typically classified into smaller pre-split and larger production holes. Underground mining (hard rock) uses a variety of drill rigs dependent on the desired purpose, such as production, bolting, cabling, and tunnelling.

==Mobile drilling rigs==

In early oil exploration, drilling rigs were semi-permanent in nature and the derricks were often built on site and left in place after the completion of the well. In more recent times drilling rigs are expensive custom-built machines that can be moved from well to well. Some light duty drilling rigs are like a mobile crane and are more usually used to drill water wells. Larger land rigs must be broken apart into sections and loads to move to a new place, a process which can often take weeks.

Small mobile drilling rigs are also used to drill or bore piles. Rigs can range from continuous flight auger (CFA) rigs to small air powered rigs used to drill holes in quarries, etc. These rigs use the same technology and equipment as the oil drilling rigs, just on a smaller scale.

The drilling mechanisms outlined below differ mechanically in terms of the machinery used, but also in terms of the method by which drill cuttings are removed from the cutting face of the drill and returned to surface.

==Automated drill rig==
An automated drill rig (ADR) is an automated full-sized walking land-based drill rig that drills long lateral sections in horizontal wells for the oil and gas industry. ADRs are agile rigs that can move from pad to pad to new well sites faster than other full-sized drilling rigs. Each rig costs about $25 million. ADR is used extensively in the Athabasca oil sands. According to the &quot;Oil Patch Daily News&quot;, &quot;Each rig will generate 50,000 man-hours of work during the construction phase and upon completion, each operating rig will directly and indirectly employ more than 100 workers.&quot; Compared to conventional drilling rigs&quot;, Ensign, an international oilfield services contractor based in Calgary, Alberta, that makes ADRs claims that they are &quot;safer to operate, have &quot;enhanced controls intelligence,&quot; &quot;reduced environmental footprint, quick mobility and advanced communications between field and office.&quot; In June 2005 the first specifically designed slant automated drilling rig (ADR), Ensign Rig No. 118, for steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) applications was mobilized by Deer Creek Energy Limited, a Calgary-based oilsands company.

==Auger drills==
An auger drill is a spiral-shaped tool. Its main function is the drilling of holes in the ground and other materials - or surfaces such as ice, wood, etc. The design of an auger depends on the kind of material it&#x27;s meant to drill into, hence there are different types of auger drills. Auger drills come in varying sizes and can drill holes up to a depth of 95 feet below the ground. They are known to be quite versatile, saving time and energy during construction work or even personal projects. The auger is a helical screw made of steel casing with curved flights that rotates as it&#x27;s pushed into the ground by a drill head. As the auger rotates, it brings excavated material to the surface, which helps keep the borehole open and prevents it from collapsing. Augers can be mounted on trucks or other machines and come in different lengths and diameters. Auger drilling is used in many fields, including construction, environmental studies, and geotechnical investigations. It can also be used for a variety of other purposes, such as:
*Installing auger piles for foundation engineering
*Drilling holes for industrial applications like telephone poles, solar posts, and deck posts
*Small home projects like gardening, building fences, and planting crops
*Ice fishing 

There are different auger drilling methods, including hand auger drilling and hollow stem auger drilling. Hand auger drilling is a cost-effective method that&#x27;s often used in areas with shallow soil, but it can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Hollow stem auger drilling uses a large, hollow auger that removes soil as it drills. 

Auger drilling is often quieter and less vibration-prone than other drilling methods, like drive drilling, so it can also be used in urban areas. When using an auger, it&#x27;s important to take safety precautions, such as wearing protective equipment like gloves, eye and ear protectors, and closed-toe boots. You should also make sure the auger and attachments are secure, engage the drill&#x27;s high torque gear, and start drilling slowly.
===Drill buckets===
A drill bucket, or auger bucket, is a drilling head that accumulates spoil inside and can be lifted from the hole periodically to be emptied.

This method is particularly effective for drilling through hard and compacted soils, as well as rocks, due to the bucket&#x27;s cylindrical design with cutting teeth at the base, which excavates and retains soil or rock as it rotates. Drill buckets are commonly used in foundation drilling for constructing deep piles and shafts.

They come in various sizes and configurations, tailored to specific ground conditions and project requirements, and can be equipped with wear-resistant components to enhance durability in abrasive environments. Additionally, modern drill buckets may include a vented bottom to release trapped air and facilitate faster spoil removal.

<doc id="1241966" wikidata="Q291319" url="?curid=1241966" title="Crosscut saw">
<text>A crosscut saw (thwart saw) is any saw designed for cutting wood perpendicular to (across) the wood grain. Crosscut saws may be small or large, with small teeth close together for fine work like woodworking or large for coarse work like log bucking, and can be a hand tool or power tool.

The cutting edge of each tooth is angled in an alternating pattern. This design allows each tooth to act like a knife edge and slice through the wood in contrast to a rip saw, which tears along the grain, acting like a miniature chisel. Some crosscut saws use special teeth, called &quot;rakers&quot;, designed to clean out the cut strips of wood from the &quot;kerf&quot;.
Crosscut saws generally have smaller teeth than rip saws.

Some saws, such as Japanese saws and those used by the ancient Egyptians, are designed to cut only on the pull stroke. Western saws, on the other hand, are designed to cut on the push stroke. Cross cut saws designed for log bucking and tree felling are designed to cut on the pull stroke.

==Common features==
Many crosscut saws have a wooden handle with the return edge at right angles to the un-toothed edge of the saw blade, allowing the saw to serve as a square for marking material to be cut at a right angle.

Larger saws used for forestry and logging work include both one-man and two-man saws, and both bucking and felling saws. A bucking saw generally has a straighter back and less of a pronounced curve on its cutting surface. Since bucking saws are more often used on trees that are already downed, the greater stiffness and weight aids swift cutting, and allows two-man saws to also be used by one person, pushing as well as pulling.

A felling saw is generally less stiff than a bucking saw and the backside, as well as the cutting side, is usually curved inward. Felling saws are more often used to cut down standing trees, so the thinner, lighter design is easier to use without gravity holding the blade against the cut. The concave back of the saw makes it easier to place wedges, preventing the kerf from closing on the saw.
Crosscut saws also include smaller hand saws used in carpentry.

==How crosscut saws cut==

All saws have cutting teeth, some may also have rakers and gullets.

As the saw is pulled toward the operator, the cutters score the wood to the left and right of the width of the blade, cutting a channel downward into the wood. Many sawtooth patterns have four cutters; each cutter that cuts to the left of the blade is paired with another that cuts to the right of the blade.

Adjacent to the cutters there is generally a raker. The void on either side of the raker is known as the gullet. A raker is what does the actual removal of the wood that is being cut. The raker follows the cutters, paring the bottom of the kerf like a chisel or plane. As the raker pares the bottom of the kerf, a strip of wood is lifted upward, and curled forward into the gullet.

As the saw is drawn out of the kerf, the wood that has accumulated in the gullets is allowed to fall out onto the ground. A way to determine whether a saw is working well is to examine the &quot;noodle&quot; shaped strings of wood that are scraped out of the kerf; the presence of fairly long strings indicate that the side cutters are doing their job and that the raker is slicing out the wood cleanly.

The cutting mechanics of the crosscut saw tooth has been described as a ‘knife like’ cutting action. The sharp bevelled cutting edges sever the wood fibers perpendicular to the grain, reducing the amount of bending within the work-piece.

==Crosscut saws versus chainsaws==

Felling or bucking is an inherently dangerous job. On top of that, both chainsaw and crosscut saws are dangerous in their own rights.

A kit for crosscut saw work weighs much less than a kit for chainsaw work. A chainsaw kit includes fuel, oil, a few tools, and more personal protective equipment.

The primary maintenance carried out on crosscut saws is sharpening, which requires a shop and a highly skilled filer. The primary maintenance on chainsaws is engine tuning, chain tensioning, and chain filing or replacement, which can be done at the site of felling and bucking.

Crosscut saws are unable to bore cut, a technique that a chainsaw operator often uses. Crosscut saws require more space to operate. They also allow the sawyer to stand several feet farther away from the log, which is safer particularly when finishing cuts. Crosscut saw use does not require hearing protection, which makes communication between team members possible, and also allows the sawyer to listen to the noises made by the log as stresses change.

In the United States, crosscut saw usage is permitted on all federal lands, whereas chainsaw usage is not permitted in designated wilderness areas.

==History==

Crosscut saws have been in use around the world since historic times, with the design of the saws (the cutting surfaces, the bow and shape of the saw, and the handles) changing over time to accommodate differences in the types of trees being cut, changes in metallurgy technology, and the application of experience. Records exist of crosscut saws in use during the Roman Empire although not widely. They came into wide usage in Europe in the middle of the 15th century. Early saws had a plain tooth pattern until the M tooth pattern was developed in 15th century south Germany. Prior to about 1880 crosscut saws were primarily used for bucking, with axes used to fell trees. Starting in Pennsylvania about 1880, loggers began using the saws for felling trees as well. Despite the modern chainsaw, they are still in wide use around the world, not only in competition matches against chainsaws but also in regular, real-life usage since they afford certain advantages over gasoline-powered saws.

== Vintage saws versus modern saws ==
There are two types of crosscut saw classification, vintage and modern. Vintage saws are saws that can be anywhere from 30 to as much as 250 years old and are much sought after by professionals, and as such are typically very much more expensive than modern crosscut saws. Modern saws are typically stamped out of sheet metal and are manufactured from contemporary alloys; they behave very differently from vintage saws, which have historically been made by craftsmen who understood the nuances of the saws they produced.

In September 2005, the United States Forest Service conducted field trials of vintage saws against modern saws, details of which can be found in the external link reference provided below. One significant finding in the background research findings is that vintage saws are becoming increasingly difficult to locate owing to the demand for such saws by professionals.

Overall, modern saws have some advantages over vintage saws such as stiffness which is useful for felling but might cause difficulties when bucking downed trunks which have bind. Vintage saws which bend easily and can, in fact, be folded end-to-end for carrying on one&#x27;s back, afford easier transport than most modern saws, and afford less-binding cuts that aren&#x27;t straight.

==Crosscut saw training==

Many areas of the National Forests of the United States are designated as Wilderness Areas and as such the use of mechanized and motorized equipment is prohibited except by special circumstance. Because of this, the United States Forest Service (USFS) organizes the crosscut saw training of USFS employees and forest working volunteers in an effort to maintain skills and proficiency among those who need to use such saws.

Training within the Angeles National Forest concentrates greatly upon the safety of the USFS employees and forest volunteers, the safety of animals in the area, and the safety of the surrounding environment.

Training also includes an examination of the differences and benefits of vintage saws and modern saws created with modern materials. Vintage saws are those saws which were manufactured over fifty years ago, being made of high carbon steel instead of the exotic alloys which are typical of contemporary saws.

Crosscut saws are used with a variety of other small hand tools. Wedges are usually used to keep the sections of the log being cut in place as the saw is worked through the rest of the log. Wedges are placed to keep the sections apart but &quot;tie wedges&quot; may also be applied across the cut to hold sections together until the sawyer is ready for the sections to roll or drop out of the way.

Also covered in typical training sessions is the safe use of the common axe. To keep the saw sharp and to avoid cutting through rocks and dirt, the bark of the tree around the area to be cut is often removed with an axe.

Crosscut saw training is mostly safety training with the mechanics of working safely with top bind, bottom bind, and radial (twisting) bind comprising much of the training required to work with such saws. The establishment of escape routes for both felling and bucking may require that both operators at either end of a double-handled saw be constantly aware of the environment around them, and constantly aware of other people within the immediate region which might enter into the sphere of crosscut influence.

Traditionally over the past 250 years the use of crosscut saws in the many forests of the United States lacked the use of safety clothing and equipment. However, safety training in contemporary usage in the United States dictates the mandatory use of gloves, eye protectors, chainsaw boots with hard tops and high-top ankle protectors, Kevlar chaps, and long sleeved shirts.

Crosscut saws are used within Designated Wildernesses where chainsaws are banned due to the prohibited use of motorized or mechanized tools and equipment, requiring that crosscut training also include the proper use of non-petroleum based lubricants as well as training in techniques which leave a minimal impact both ecologically as well as visually after trails are cleared of downed trees.

Safe and effective crosscut and chainsaw use on federally administered public lands within the United States has been codified since July 19, 2016 in the publication of the &quot;Final Directive for National Saw Program&quot; issued by the United States Forest Service, USDA which specifies the training, testing, and certification process for employees as well as for unpaid volunteers who operate chainsaws within public lands.

The new directive specifies Forest Service Manual (FSM) 2358 (PDF) which covers classification of sawyers, their Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and numerous other aspects of required safety training and behavior when operating chainsaws or crosscut saws on federally administered public lands.

<doc id="1241967" wikidata="Q500190" url="?curid=1241967" title="Liberal Party (Norway)">
<text>The Liberal Party (, , V; ) is a social liberal political party in Norway. It was founded in 1884 and is the oldest political party in Norway. Despite its native name, the Liberal Party is positioned in the centre on the political spectrum, and usually cooperates much more with the right wing parties. It is a liberal party which has over the time enacted reforms such as parliamentarism, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and state schooling.

For most of the late 19th and early 20th century, it was Norway&#x27;s largest and dominant political party, but in the postwar era it lost most of its support and became a relatively small party. The party has nevertheless participated in several centrist and centre-right government coalitions in the postwar era. It currently holds eight seats in the Parliament, and was previously a part of Norway&#x27;s government together with the Conservative Party and the Christian Democratic Party. Guri Melby has served as the party leader since 2020.

Founded in 1884, then with the main support from farmers and progressive members of the bourgeoisie, it was the first political party that came into existence in Norway, and was the dominant government party for several decades. From the beginning it had a close relationship with the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights, which was founded in the same year by most of the Liberal Party&#x27;s leading politicians, and the party played a central role in advocating for women&#x27;s suffrage. Since the 1880s the party has seen many internal schisms. A politically moderate and religious wing broke away in 1888 to form the Moderate Liberal Party; and the conservative-liberal faction, including the former Prime Minister of Norway Christian Michelsen, broke away in 1909 to form the Free-minded Liberal Party (both parties eventually merged into the Conservative Party). The most notable recent schism was in 1972, when the Liberal Party decided to oppose Norwegian membership in the European Economic Community (EEC), and the faction supporting membership broke away and formed the Liberal People&#x27;s Party. The party has since endorsed Norwegian membership in the EU and is currently a strong proponent.

== History ==

The party Venstre was formed in 1884 in connection with the dispute about whether or not to introduce parliamentarianism in Norway. Venstre (which means &quot;Left&quot; in Norwegian) was the party advocating parliamentarianism, whereas the conservatives, who opposed parliamentarianism, formed the party Høyre (which means &quot;Right&quot;). When the fight for parliamentarianism was won, Venstre&#x27;s leader Johan Sverdrup became the first Norwegian prime minister to be appointed on the basis of having the support of a majority in the Storting (Norwegian parliament). Later, Venstre advocated universal suffrage for men, which was achieved in 1898, the break-up of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, which happened in 1905, and universal women&#x27;s suffrage, which was introduced in 1913. In the first decades after 1884, Venstre formed several governments, interspersed with periods of Høyre-governments. Six different Prime Ministers of Norway have come from Venstre, all of them before 1935. 

In 1891, the more liberal-social tendencies of the party started to dominate Venstre, and as noted by one study, “the majority of social policies up to 1914 were supported and pushed through by Venstre, as the Social Democratic Party had no influence on policy until that date.

With the growth of the Labour Party, Venstre gradually lost ground. The election of 1915 was the last in which Venstre was the largest party and won an outright majority in the Storting. Venstre was further weakened with the formation of &quot;Bondepartiet&quot; (the present-day Centre Party) in 1920, and Christian People&#x27;s Party in 1933, both of which were formed partly by former Venstre members. Since World War II, Venstre has been part of five coalition governments, the most recent one being Solberg&#x27;s Cabinet from 2018.

A dispute over Norwegian membership in the European Communities (now the European Union) led to the party splitting at a meeting in Røros in 1972, with the people favoring EC membership departing and forming the Liberal People&#x27;s Party. These included the party leader, Helge Seip, and 9 of the 13 members of parliament. Since then, Venstre has been a fairly small party. The parliamentary group was reduced to two after the 1973 election.

In 1974, Venstre elected the first female leader of a political party in Norway, Eva Kolstad.

Election results continued to be poor for Venstre. Before the 1985 election the party announced for the first, and so far only, time that it would support a Labour Party government. At the following election Venstre lost its two remaining seats, and was without representation in the Storting for the first time. The party merged in 1988 with the Liberal People&#x27;s Party, but at the election of 1989 this reunited Venstre again failed to win parliamentary seats. In 1993 the party again failed to achieve the 4% threshold that would have made it eligible for the levelling seats in parliament, but Lars Sponheim was elected directly from Hordaland county. (Before the election, Sponheim had made the wager that he would walk across the mountains from his home in Ulvik to the parliament in the capital city Oslo if elected—a wager he delivered on, to much good-humoured interest from the press.)

In 1997, Venstre passed the 4% threshold, increasing its seats in parliament to six. As a consequence Venstre also saw its first participation in cabinet since 1973. The party held four seats in the minority first government of Kjell Magne Bondevik. Lars Sponheim became minister of industry and commerce, Odd Einar Dørum; minister of communications, later minister of justice, Guro Fjellanger; minister of environmental protection, and Eldbjørg Løwer; minister of administration, later minister of defense. Mrs. Løwer was the first female minister of defense in Norway. This cabinet resigned in 2000, refusing to accept the Storting&#x27;s decision to build gas power plants. In 2001, Venstre narrowly failed to reach the 4% threshold, but had two representatives elected, Sponheim and Odd Einar Dørum. However, due to Venstre becoming part of the second coalition government of Kjell Magne Bondevik, with Sponheim and Dørum entering the cabinet, the two were represented in parliament by deputies. The party also got a third member of the cabinet, with the appointment of Torild Skogsholm as Minister of Transport and Communications.

The 2005 election gave Venstre 5.9% of the vote, its best result since the 1969 election. Venstre won six seats directly, and an additional four seats through the 4%+ compensatory system. Due to the majority of the Red-green coalition, Venstre became an opposition party.

In the 2009 election, Venstre ended up below the 4% threshold for levelling seats, leaving the party with only two seats in parliament, Trine Skei Grande and Borghild Tenden, whereas they had ten seats before the election. The same evening, 14 September 2009, Lars Sponheim announced that he would step down as party leader, as a consequence of the poor result. After the election, the party experienced growth in members. At the party conference in April 2010, Trine Skei Grande was unanimously elected as the new leader of the party.

Venstre climbed over the threshold with 5.2% in the 2013 elections and entered into coalition talks with the Conservative, Christian Democratic, and Progress parties. Venstre and the Christian Democrats decided not to enter the new Solberg Cabinet, thus leaving it without a parliamentary majority, but made a confidence and supply agreement with it.

Winning eight seats in the 2017 elections, Venstre entered into new talks with the Conservative and Progress Party coalition, and joined the coalition in January 2018 with three cabinet posts; Ola Elvestuen became Minister of Climate and Environment, Iselin Nybø Minister of Research and Higher Education, while party leader Trine Skei Grande became Minister of Culture.

==Ideology==

The party is regarded as liberal, social-liberal, classical liberal and centrist. The party advocates civil liberties under the pre-condition of an active state. Since the 1970s, the party has maintained a green liberal position, which was an important part of the party profile when it came back to parliament in the 1990s. The Liberal Party was rated the second best party after the Green Party by the environmentalist organisation &quot;Framtiden i våre hender&quot;. The party is also a strong supporter of multiculturalism, increased labour immigration to Norway, and relaxed integration measures.

Through its history, it has taken part in both centre-right and pure centrist coalition governments. From 2001 to 2005, it was in a centre-right coalition government with the Conservative Party and Christian Democratic Party; since the 2005 general election, the party has been in opposition. More recently the party has been a proponent of a blue–green alliance in Norwegian politics, with Venstre constituting the green part.

In the last few election campaigns, Venstre&#x27;s main focus has been on environmental issues, education, small-business and social issues. Venstre advocates higher taxes on activities that damage the environment. Some other positions advocated by Venstre are increased labour immigration, abolition of the Church of Norway as the state church, abolishing the wealth and inheritance taxes, and more power to local authorities (kommuner).

At the national convention in 2005, Venstre decided with a margin of only five votes to still oppose Norway joining the European Union, albeit weakly, while still advocating that Norway remain part of the European Economic Area. In 2020, however, a majority at the national convention voted for Venstre to support EU membership for Norway. Thus, the official stance of Venstre is now in support of Norwegian membership of the European Union. Regardless, the party retains the position that the question of potential Norwegian EU membership should only be decided by a national referendum, similar to referendums held in 1972 and 1994. Venstre additionally supports the replacement of the monarchy with a republican form of government.

In 2007, Venstre became the first Norwegian party to advocate legalizing sharing of copyrighted digital material.

==Etymology==
While the name of the party means &quot;Left&quot; in Norwegian, the party refers to itself as a centrist party. Since the Centre Party was a component of the governing centre-left Red-green coalition, and &quot;Venstre&quot; was part of the &quot;non-socialist&quot; opposition, a situation has been produced where the &quot;centre&quot; party is more on the left than &quot;Left&quot; itself. When the name &quot;Left&quot; was chosen in 1884, the word did not refer to socialism in the way &quot;Left wing&quot; does today. It meant &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;radicalism&quot; in comparison to the &quot;conservatives&quot; on the right, and referred to the position of the seats in Parliament. The use of the word for &quot;left&quot; in the names of the Danish political parties &quot;Venstre&quot; and &quot;Radikale Venstre&quot; is also meant to refer to liberalism and radicalism rather than socialism.

<text>The Mariana mallard or Oustalet&#x27;s duck (&quot;Anas oustaleti&quot;) is an extinct species of duck of the genus &quot;Anas&quot; that was endemic to the Mariana Islands. Its taxonomic status is debated, and it has variously been treated as a full species, a subspecies of the mallard or of the Pacific black duck, or sometimes as a subspecies of the Indian spot-billed duck.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomic status of the Mariana mallard is disputed, since it resembles an intermediate of the mallard and the Pacific black duck, two closely related allopatric species which frequently hybridise. Its males had two intergrading color morphs, called the &quot;platyrhynchos&quot; and the &quot;superciliosa&quot; types after the species they resembled more. It was first scientifically described by Tommaso Salvadori as a full species in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;, named after its collector, the French zoologist Emile Oustalet. Salvadori suggested it was related to the Pacific black duck. It was previously known to the Chamorro people, who called it &quot;ngånga&#x27; (palao)&quot; in Chamorro, and to the Carolinian people, who called it &quot;ghereel&#x27;bwel&quot; in Carolinian.

After Salvadori, most taxonomists, such as Dean Amadon and Ernst Mayr, considered it a subspecies of the mallard. Yoshimaro Yamashina examined those specimens in Japanese museums in 1948, and decided that the Mariana mallard was an example of hybrid speciation, and was descended from the mallard and the Pacific black duck&#x27;s Palau subspecies (&quot;Anas superciliosa pelewensis&quot;). However, no molecular genetic evidence is available to support this hypothesis. Some scientists, such as Jean Delacour, have considered the Mariana mallard a simple hybrid, so it was absent from Delacour&#x27;s four-volume monograph on the ducks and from the IUCN Red List. If Yamashina&#x27;s hypothesis is correct, the Mariana mallard would have presumably evolved into near species status in only about ten thousand years.

Neither Mariana mallards nor their progenitor species are known from fossils on the Marianas, casting into doubt the assumption that a resident black duck population had been long established on the islands. However, most rock shelters and caves on the Marianas were obliterated in the 1944 Battle of Guam. A species of flightless duck is known from a prehistoric bone found on Rota in 1994; it was apparently not closely related to the Mariana mallard.

== Description ==
Mariana mallards were long and weighed approximately , making them marginally smaller than mallards. Two intergrading color morphs were found in males, called the &quot;platyrhynchos&quot; and the &quot;superciliosa&quot; type after the species they resembled more.

Only the former had a distinct nuptial (breeding) plumage: the head was green as in mallard drakes, but less glossy, with some buff feathers on the sides, a dark brown eyestripe and a faint whitish ring at the base of the neck. The upper breast was dark ruddish chestnut brown with blackish-brown spots. The wing patch (speculum) and the tail was also like in mallard drakes&#x27; nuptial plumage, including curled-up central tail feathers, but the tips of the speculum feathers were buff. The underside was a mix between the vermiculated grey feathers of the mallard and the brown ones of the Pacific black duck. The remainder of the bird looked like a male Pacific black duck with lighter underwings. The bill was black at the base and olive at the tip, the feet reddish orange with darker webs and the iris brown. The eclipse plumage looked similar to a dark eclipse mallard drake.

Males of the &quot;superciliosa&quot; type resembled a Pacific black duck with a less distinctly marked head, the supercilium and cheeks being buffy and the cheek (malar) stripe hardly visible. The upper breast, flank and scapular feathers had broader buff edges, and the underwings were lighter. The speculum was usually as in the &quot;platyrhynchos&quot; type, i.e. mallard-like, but at least two specimens have the green speculum of the Pacific black duck. The bill was like that of &quot;A. superciliosa&quot;, and the iris and legs similar to the &quot;platyrhynchos&quot; type.

Females looked essentially like a dark mallard female with the orange of the feet and near the bill tip usually a bit more pure.

== Distribution ==

It occurred, in recent times at least, on the islands of Guam, Saipan and Tinian. Two unidentified ducks were seen on Rota in 1945, but as no movement of &quot;A. oustaleti&quot; between Saipan and Tinian, which are just apart, was recorded, these were probably vagrant migrating ducks, although Marshall (1949) suspected from circumstantial evidence that such movement did indeed take place. However, the distance between Guam and Rota is nearly , making intentional migration between these islands unlikely.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
The Mariana mallard inhabited wetlands, mostly inland but occasionally also in coastal areas. On Guam, it was most abundant in the Talofofo River valley, on Tinian on Lake Hagoi and Lake Makpo (before it was drained and known as Makpo Swamp), and on Saipan on the Garpan Lagoon and on and around Lake Susupe. The birds were rather reclusive, preferring sheltered habitat with plenty of wetland and water plants – fern thickets (&quot;Acrostichum aureum&quot;) and reed beds (&quot;Scirpus&quot;, &quot;Cyperus&quot; and &quot;Phragmites&quot;), where they also nested. Usually, pairs or small flocks were encountered, but in the key habitats larger groups of dozens and rarely up to 50–60 individuals could be found. Apart from possible inter-island movement, the birds were not migratory.

Feeding and reproduction are not well documented, but cannot expected to differ significantly from its immediate relatives. The Mariana mallard fed on aquatic invertebrates, small vertebrates and plants, and although they were not observed up-ending like mallards, they probably did so.

Breeding was recorded from at least January to July, with a peak in June–July at the end of the dry season. One male specimen taken in October was also in breeding condition; thus, the birds may have bred nearly year-round at least on occasion. The courtship behavior, which in the strongly sexually dimorphic mallard is focused more on presentation of visual cues than in the monomorphic Pacific black duck (although it is generally similar in both species), was never recorded. Clutches consisted of 7–12 pale grey-green oval eggs, measuring 6.16 x 3.89 cm on average. Incubation lasted around 28 days, males took no part in it and neither in caring for the ducklings. The precocial and nidifugous young fledged when about eight weeks old and became sexually mature the following year.

== Extinction ==
The birds declined due to draining of wetlands for agriculture and construction. Hunting pressure was probably heavy, despite a ban on gun ownership under Japanese control (1914–1945), as the birds were unwary to traps, and at any rate the gun ban was lifted after World War II. By the 1940s, flocks of more than a dozen birds were seldom seen. On Guam, the last sightings were in 1949 and 1967—the latter being a single, possibly vagrant, bird—and on Tinian in 1974. As Lake Susupe offered the most plentiful and least accessible habitat, although it too suffered from pollution by sugar mill wastes, the Saipan population lingered on for a few more years. The Mariana mallard was listed as federally endangered on June 2, 1977. In 1979, two males and a female were found on Saipan and caught; one male was later released, the last wild bird ever to be encountered. The pair was brought to Pohakuloa Training Area, Hawaii, and later to SeaWorld San Diego, where it was attempted to have them reproduce in captivity. However, this was unsuccessful and the species became extinct with the death of the last individual in 1981. Surveys were conducted in the following years, but the species was certainly gone by then. It was removed from the USFWS Endangered Species List on February 23, 2004, due to extinction.
Collection of specimens for museums and private collections must have had a temporary impact during the Japanese control over the islands. Although fewer than 100 specimens are on record, most were taken in the 1930s and 1940s for Japanese collectors; given the rather sedentary habits and small population size of the species, this may have jeopardized local populations to the point of extinction. Outside Japan, 7 specimens (including the type) are in the National Museum of Natural History, Paris, one in the Natural History Museum at Tring, two in the National Museum of Natural History, Washington D.C. and six in the American Museum of Natural History, New York City. There are reports of additional specimens in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Lisbon.

<text>Fado Curvo is the second studio album by Portuguese fado singer Mariza, released on 6 May 2003.

==Reception==

&quot;Fado Curvo&quot; became Mariza&#x27;s first album to feature on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s World Albums chart, where it peaked at number 6 in June 2003. The album is a certified quadruple platinum record in Portugal: by December 2004, it had sold 80,000 copies in the country, which awarded the album the double platinum.

Reactions to the album were positive, with critics underlining its experimental nature and the blending of traditional songs with contemporary arrangements and compositions. The great range of emotions expressed in &quot;Fado Curvo&quot; was noted by critics, that considered it to be a breakaway from one of the old traditions of fado, that is to focus on sadness.

Mike Joyce of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that even listeners not well acquainted with fado would not be indifferent to Mariza&#x27;s voice, that he qualified as being &quot;a dark, rich, commanding contralto&quot;.

==Track listing==

<doc id="1241983" wikidata="Q28106878" url="?curid=1241983" title="Red shoveler">
<text>The red shoveler (Spatula platalea) is a species of dabbling duck native to southern South America.

== Description ==
The species has a spatula-shaped bill, a green speculum, and light blue upper wing converts. Male shovelers vary in color from red to paler shades of red (and pink), while the females tend to have large, dark bills. Adults reach a size of about , weigh about , and have a wingspan of about .

== Distribution and habitat ==

The red shoveler breeds in the southern half of South America. It ranges from Tierra del Fuego northwards to Chile and most parts of Argentina, as well as to the Falkland Islands; there are small, isolated breeding populations in the southern regions of Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay. They can also be found in the extreme southern regions of Brazil and Uruguay, in isolated coastal populations and also further inland. It inhabits shallow lakes and pools with dense reed beds, intertidal mangrove swamps and marshes. They can also be found in brackish waters, such as coastal lagoons, deltas and estuaries.

== Ecology ==
Red shovelers have a diet that includes herbs, grasses, pond weeds, widgeon grass, algae, and eelgrass. They also feed on small invertebrates. The bill is equipped with a lamellate filtering mechanism that allows the extraction of small items of food from the water. Pairs form in the wintering grounds, after often noisy courtship. Once a clutch of 7–8 eggs is laid, incubation lasts about 25–26 days, followed by 40–45 days of fledging. Red shovelers are partially migratory, with the southernmost birds migrating north during the winter season.

== Conservation ==
The red shoveler is a relatively common and widespread species, and is not currently considered at risk. However, it may suffer to an extent from the degradation of its wetland habitats. The species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List due to its extremely large range and apparently overall stable population. Unfortunately, the wetland habitats used for nesting by this species are under threat by problems such as eutrophication due to agriculture runoff, which causes a loss in aquatic plants, making it difficult for the ducks to find food reliably much less build nests out of said aquatic/herbaceous plants along with grazing cattle trampling down nests and vegetation needed to hide the nests to begin with. This means that despite their species being considered under the category of Least Concern, actual steps need to be taken towards the conservation of this species by both regular farmers and the wetland areas dedicated to conservation where they are supposedly protected from things like tourism, fishing, and hunting, as their true numbers in the wild are unknown because this species is so spread out.

<text>Kansas City Brass was an American soccer team based in Overland Park, Kansas, United States, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri. Founded in 1997, the team played in the USL Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, in the Heartland Division of the Central Conference.

The team played its home games on the Stadium Field at the Overland Park Soccer Complex, where they played beginning in 2011. The team&#x27;s colors were blue and white.

==History==

Kansas City Brass was owned by Kansas City United Soccer, Inc., a Kansas Not-for-Profit Corporation, formed in 1997 by Dr. Emilio John and Alan Blinzler, to serve two missions: to prepare graduating high school seniors for college soccer by introducing them to the level of speed and physical play found at the highest levels of college soccer; and to prepare players for the level of competition found at the First and Second Division levels of professional soccer. Since its beginning John served as President of the Brass and Blinzler acted as Chief Operating Officer.

The Brass assisted over thirty players in their quest to move from the amateur ranks to professional teams. In 2007 the Brass was inducted into the United Soccer Leagues Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1241988" wikidata="Q932268" url="?curid=1241988" title="System of units of measurement">
<text>A system of units of measurement, also known as a system of units or system of measurement, is a collection of units of measurement and rules relating them to each other. Systems of measurement have historically been important, regulated and defined for the purposes of science and . Instances in use include the International System of Units or (the modern form of the metric system), the British imperial system, and the United States customary system.

==History==

In antiquity, &quot;systems of measurement&quot; were defined locally: the different units might be defined independently according to the length of a king&#x27;s thumb or the size of his foot, the length of stride, the length of arm, or maybe the weight of water in a keg of specific size, perhaps itself defined in &quot;hands&quot; and &quot;knuckles&quot;. The unifying characteristic is that there was some definition based on some standard. Eventually &quot;cubits&quot; and &quot;strides&quot; gave way to &quot;customary units&quot; to meet the needs of merchants and scientists.

The preference for a more universal and consistent system only gradually spread with the growth of international trade and science. Changing a measurement system has costs in the near term, which often results in resistance to such a change. The substantial benefit of conversion to a more rational and internationally consistent system of measurement has been recognized and promoted by scientists, engineers, businesses and politicians, and has resulted in most of the world adopting a commonly agreed metric system.

The French Revolution gave rise to the metric system, and this has spread around the world, replacing most customary units of measure. In most systems, length (distance), mass, and time are &quot;base quantities&quot;.

Later, science developments showed that an electromagnetic quantity such as electric charge or electric current could be added to extend the set of base quantities. Gaussian units have only length, mass, and time as base quantities, with no separate electromagnetic dimension. Other quantities, such as power and speed, are derived from the base quantities: for example, speed is distance per unit time. Historically, a wide range of units was used for the same type of quantity. In different contexts length was measured in inches, feet, yards, fathoms, rods, chains, furlongs, miles, nautical miles, stadia, leagues, with conversion factors that were not based on power of ten.

In the metric system and other recent systems, underlying relationships between quantities, as expressed by formulae of physics such as Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, is used to select a small number of base quantities for which a unit is defined for each, from which all other units may be derived. Secondary units (multiples and submultiples) are derived from these base and derived units by multiplying by powers of ten. For example, where the unit of length is the metre; a distance of 1 metre is 1,000 millimetres, or 0.001 kilometres.

===Current practice===

Metrication is complete or nearly complete in most countries.

However, US customary units remain heavily used in the United States and to some degree in Liberia. Traditional Burmese units of measurement are used in Burma, with partial transition to the metric system. U.S. units are used in limited contexts in Canada due to the large volume of trade with the U.S. There is also considerable use of imperial weights and measures, despite &quot;de jure&quot; Canadian conversion to metric.

A number of other jurisdictions have laws mandating or permitting other systems of measurement in some or all contexts, such as the United Kingdom whose road signage legislation, for instance, only allows distance signs displaying imperial units (miles or yards) or Hong Kong.

In the United States, metric units are virtually always used in science, frequently in the military, and partially in industry. U.S. customary units are primarily used in U.S. households. At retail stores, the litre (spelled &#x27;liter&#x27; in the U.S.) is a commonly used unit for volume, especially on bottles of beverages, and milligrams, rather than grains, are used for medications. 

Some other non-SI units are still in international use, such as nautical miles and knots in aviation and shipping, and feet for aircraft altitude.

==Metric system==

Metric systems of units have evolved since the adoption of the first well-defined system in France in 1795. During this evolution the use of these systems has spread throughout the world, first to non-English-speaking countries, and then to English speaking countries.

Multiples and submultiples of metric units are related by powers of ten and their names are formed with prefixes. This relationship is compatible with the decimal system of numbers and it contributes greatly to the convenience of metric units.

In the early metric system there were two base units, the metre for length and the gram for mass. The other units of length and mass, and all units of area, volume, and derived units such as density were derived from these two base units.

Mesures usuelles (French for &quot;customary measures&quot;) were a system of measurement introduced as a compromise between the metric system and traditional measurements. It was used in France from 1812 to 1839.

A number of variations on the metric system have been in use. These include gravitational systems, the centimetre–gram–second systems (cgs) useful in science, the metre–tonne–second system (mts) once used in the USSR and the metre–kilogram–second system (mks). In some engineering fields, like computer-aided design, millimetre–gram–second (mmgs) is also used.

The current international standard for the metric system is the International System of Units ( or SI). It is a system in which all units can be expressed in terms of seven units. The units that serve as the SI base units are the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela.

==British imperial and US customary units==

Both British imperial units and US customary units derive from earlier English units. Imperial units were mostly used in the former British Empire and the British Commonwealth, but in all these countries they have been largely supplanted by the metric system. They are still used for some applications in the United Kingdom but have been mostly replaced by the metric system in commercial, scientific, and industrial applications. US customary units, however, are still the main system of measurement in the United States. While some steps towards metrication have been made (mainly in the late 1960s and early 1970s), the customary units have a strong hold due to the vast industrial infrastructure and commercial development.

While British imperial and US customary systems are closely related, there are a number of differences between them. Units of length and area (the inch, foot, yard, mile, etc.) have been identical since the adoption of the International Yard and Pound Agreement; however, the US and, formerly, India retained older definitions for surveying purposes. This gave rise to the US survey foot, for instance. The avoirdupois units of mass and weight differ for units larger than a pound (lb). The British imperial system uses a stone of 14 lb, a long hundredweight of 112 lb and a long ton of 2,240 lb. The stone is not a measurement of weight used in the US. The US customary system uses the short hundredweight of 100 lb and short ton of 2,000 lb.

Where these systems most notably differ is in their units of volume. An imperial fluid ounce of 28.4130625 ml is 3.924% smaller than the US fluid ounce (fl oz) of 29.5735295625 millilitres (ml). However, as there are 16 US fl oz to a US pint and 20 imp fl oz to an imperial pint, the imperial pint is 20.095% larger than a US pint, and the same is true for gills, quarts, and gallons: six US gallons (22.712470704 L) is only 0.08% less than five imperial gallons (22.73045 L).

The avoirdupois system served as the general system of mass and weight. In addition to this, there are the troy and the apothecaries&#x27; systems. Troy weight was customarily used for precious metals, black powder, and gemstones. The troy ounce is the only unit of the system in current use; it is used for precious metals. Although the troy ounce is larger than its avoirdupois equivalent, the pound is smaller. The obsolete troy pound was divided into 12 ounces, rather than the 16 ounces per pound of the avoirdupois system. The apothecaries&#x27; system was traditionally used in pharmacology, but has now been replaced by the metric system; it shared the same pound and ounce as the troy system but with different further subdivisions.

==Natural units==
Natural units are units of measurement defined in terms of universal physical constants in such a manner that selected physical constants take on the numerical value of one when expressed in terms of those units. Natural units are so named because their definition relies on only properties of nature and not on any human construct. Varying systems of natural units are possible, depending on the choice of constants used.

Some examples are as follows:
* Geometrized unit systems are useful in relativistic physics. In these systems, speed of light and the gravitational constant are among the constants chosen.
* Planck units is system of geometrized units in which the reduced Planck constant is included in the list of defining constants. It is based on only properties of free space rather than of any object or particle.
* Stoney units is a system of geometrized units in which the Coulomb constant and the elementary charge are included.
* Atomic units are a system of units used in atomic physics, particularly for describing the properties of electrons. The atomic units have been chosen to use several constants relating to the electron: the electron mass, the elementary charge, the Coulomb constant and the reduced Planck constant. The unit of energy in this system is the total energy of the electron in the Bohr atom and called the Hartree energy. The unit of length is the Bohr radius.

==Non-standard units==
Non-standard measurement units also found in books, newspapers etc., include:

===Area===
* The American football field, which has a playing area long by wide. This is often used by the American public media for the sizes of large buildings or parks. It is used both as a unit of length (, the length of the playing field excluding goal areas) and as a unit of area (), about .
* British media also frequently uses the football pitch for equivalent purposes, although soccer pitches are not of a fixed size, but instead can vary within defined limits ( long, and wide, giving an area of ). However the UEFA Champions League field must be exactly giving an area of or . For example, &quot;HSS vessels are aluminium catamarans about the size of a football pitch.&quot;
* Larger areas are also expressed as a multiple of the areas of states and countries understood to be familiar to the reader.

===Energy===
* A ton of TNT equivalent, and its multiples the kiloton, the megaton, and the gigaton. Often used in stating the power of very energetic events such as explosions and volcanic events and earthquakes and asteroid impacts. A gram of TNT as a unit of energy has been defined as 1000 thermochemical calories ().
* The atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Its energy yield is often used in the public media and popular books as a unit of energy. (Its yield was roughly 13 kilotons, or 60 TJ.)
* One stick of dynamite.

==Units of currency==
A unit of measurement that applies to money is called a unit of account in economics and unit of measure in accounting. This is normally a currency issued by a country or a fraction thereof; for instance, the US dollar and US cent ( of a dollar), or the euro and euro cent.

ISO 4217 is the international standard describing three letter codes (also known as the currency code) to define the names of currencies established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

==Historical systems of measurement==
Throughout history, many official systems of measurement have been used. While no longer in official use, some of these customary systems are occasionally used in day-to-day life, for instance in cooking.

<text>A ripsaw (or rip saw) is a wood saw that is specially designed for making a rip cut, a cut made parallel to the direction of the wood grain.

==Design==
The cutting edge of each tooth has a flat front edge and it is angled backward by about 8°, in contrast to a crosscut saw, which has teeth angled backward by about 15°. 

With the &quot;rip&quot; tooth pattern, the edges are sharpened at right angles to the cutting plane, forming chisel-like cutting surfaces, whereas crosscut teeth are sharpened at an angle, so that each tooth has a knife-like cutting point in contact with the wood. This design keeps the saw from following grain lines, which could curve the path of the saw: by acting like a chisel, the saw can more easily cut across deviating grain lines, which is necessary if a straight cut is to be achieved. This feature enables the orthogonal cutting edge to efficiently transport wood-chips from the kerf, allowing subsequent teeth to perform a more effective cut. 

It is possible to see this material removal mechanism in action by analyzing frame by frame footage of the cutting process. Ripsaws typically have 4–10 teeth per inch, making them relatively coarse.

==Use==
All sawmills use ripsaws of various types including the circular saw and band saw. Historically sawmills used one or more reciprocating saws more specifically known as an &quot;up-and-down&quot; or &quot;upright saw&quot; which are of two basic types, the frame saw or a muley (mulay) saw which is similar to the hand powered pit saw. Some sawmills also use crosscut saws to cut boards and planks to length.

==Cutting styles==
On the vast majority of saws throughout the world, the teeth are designed to cut when the saw is being pushed through the wood (on the push stroke or down stroke). However, some saws (such as Japanese saws and the saws used by Ancient Egyptians) are designed to cut on the pull stroke.

<doc id="1241991" wikidata="Q1630298" url="?curid=1241991" title="Horwich">
<text>Horwich ( ) is a town and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, Greater Manchester, England, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. It is southeast of Chorley, northwest of Bolton and northwest of Manchester. It lies at the southern edge of the West Pennine Moors with the M61 motorway passing close to the south and west. At the 2011 Census, Horwich had a population of 20,067.

Horwich emerged in the Middle Ages as a hunting chase. Streams flowing from the moors were harnessed to provide power for bleachworks and other industry at the start of the Industrial Revolution. The textile industry became a major employer and after 1884 the construction of the railway works caused the population of the town to increase dramatically. The old industries have closed and urban regeneration has been led by out of town developments, particularly at Middlebrook, which, since 1997 has been the base of Bolton Wanderers football club, who play at the University of Bolton Stadium, having moved from Burnden Park near Bolton town centre.

==History==
The name Horwich derives from the Old English &quot;har&quot; and &quot;wice&quot;, meaning the place at the grey wych-elm and in 1221 was recorded as &quot;Horewic&quot;. The name was recorded as &quot;Harewych&quot; in 1277 and &quot;Horewyche&quot; in 1327.

===Horwich Forest===

Ancient records are of Horwich Forest being overrun with wolves in the time of Ecgfrid, ruler of Northumbria until 685, &#x27;Smithills walled round to keep them at bay&#x27;. Around this time early Saxon Kings used the forest for the chase, while staying at the ancient Smithells Hall, records exist of Ælla of Northumbria making use of the forests for hunting. Ecgberht (Egbert) is a notably visitor associated with the area in this early period. Horwich developed from a &#x27;bridge point settlement&#x27; on the River Douglas at what is now Scholes Bank. By the Middle Ages Horwich was a hunting chase, after the Norman Conquest held by Albert de Gresle between 1086 and 1100. In 1277 Robert Gresle, Baron of Manchester prosecuted Martin de Rumworth for carrying off deer in Horwich Chase which was described in 1322 as being within &quot;a circuit of sixteen leagues with a yearly value in pannage, aeries of eagles, herons and goshawks, in honey, millstones, and iron mines, in charcoal-burning, and the like issues, 60 shillings; of which the vesture in oaks, elms and wholly covered with such, 160 marks.&quot; In 1294 Thomas Gresle, sixth Baron of Manchester obtained free warren over &quot;Horewich&quot;. The local enforcement of Forest Law was through a Bailiff who served the Lord of the Manor and it was he who decided punishments. Trespassers in the forest were brought before the Manorial Court Leet. The decline of Horwich forest is connected to the dissolution when Henry VIII seized all the church lands and then sold them.

===Pre-industrial===

By the 16th century, subsequent to the reformation land ownership had shifted from Church to the crown and was then sold to new owners, who transformed the town into an agricultural economy, and forests were cleared. Many of the farms from the period still existed until the housing boom of the 19th and 20th centuries, like many Lancashire towns the cotton industry was prominent as at least a secondary occupation in many households, weaving became a widespread occupation, and industries like bleaching, dying and paper making grew from the use of water power with the towns preindustrial plentiful access to flowing water. The town continued this path until the arrival of the railway workshops in the 19th century. 

In 1598 a number of men were presented at the court leet for tithing and in 1621 the court leet recorded &quot;paid for hue and crye that came from Horwich after the man who made an escape forth of ye stocks for stealing certain lynen cloth 8d&quot;. The earliest map of Horwich is dated 1620 and is known as &#x27;The Platt of Horwich&#x27;, naming the landowner as Sir Thomas Barton, of the Barton family of Holme Hall in the manor of Holme Newark and Smithills Hall, Bolton. A plague pit is noted on the map, with victims of a 1623 outbreak, interred in a mass grave under what is now Lever Park Avenue. The existence of the pit is likely a local myth coming about by modern additions to a copy of an older map. By the 17th century, the amount of woodland in the Horwich forest was reduced by house building and for fuel. Horwich Moor was enclosed between 1815 and 1818. Race meetings were held between 1837 and 1847 at the &#x27;Old Lords estate&#x27;, an area next to the Rivington border, named after 11th Baron Willoughby. Four Barons Willoughby of Parham are interred at Horwich Parish Church.

The manor became the property of the Andertons of Lostock Hall, Lostock, who purchased it in 1599 from Nicholas and Elizabeth Mosley. These lands were confiscated by The Crown in 1715 after the Battle of Preston. They were leased to the Blundells whose coat of arms is displayed above the door at the Blundell Arms on Chorley Old Road.

The Pilkington family were notable in the town&#x27;s history, prior to the Ridgways. The town coat of arms incorporates the Pilkington Cross, in recognition of the founder of the Rivington and Blackrod High School, James Pilkington, Bishop of Durham and the prominent role in the local history of the family. Richard Pilkington, a leading non-conformist and owner of Horwich Manor, and his family feature in the town&#x27;s history from the post Protectorate to the industrial revolution being benefactors and founders of a number of places of worship. Another William Pilkington (1765–1831) became a physician and apothecary in St Helens. It is this branch that links Horwich to the founders of Pilkington Glass, his sons being Richard (1795–1869) and William (1800–1872).

===Industrial Revolution===
In the 1770s brothers, John and Joseph Ridgway, land agents to the Blundells, moved their bleach works from Bolton to Wallsuches. Their works was the oldest and one of the few stone-built mills in the Bolton borough. The firm was one of the earliest users of chemical bleaching using chlorine.
In 1798 the firm installed a Boulton and Watt steam engine.

Horwich Vale Printworks, founded in 1799 by the River Douglas, printed cloth using machines and handblocks. On the slopes of Winter Hill, stone was quarried and there were several small collieries and a firebrick and tile works. In 1896 the Montcliffe Colliery was owned by Adam Mason and Son and managed by Joseph Crankshaw and Joseph Kenwright. It employed 26 men underground and seven surface workers getting coal and fireclay from the Mountain coal seam. Crankshaws pipeworks used the fireclay and had had several beehive kilns at their works at Tiger&#x27;s Clough. In the mid-19th century, cotton mills were built by W. &amp; W. Bennett and Peter Gaskell.

Ridgways provided land for the early 19th century Club Houses, a grid pattern development of streets of stone built cottages south of Church Street. Some had basements for hand loom weaving. In 1851 the occupants were crofters, stovers and bleachers. 

===Heavy Industry===

In 1881 the population of 3,761 lived in 900 houses and had remained stable for fifty years, the arrival of the railway works and other industries including W.T. Taylor&#x27;s cotton mill resulted in a considerable change to Horwich leading to a rapid increase in population, creating a boom in population by 1891 to 12,850 people, Horwich became a railway town in this period of the Industrial Revolution.

Coming with this increased population was a need for more houses, schools, and retail and service industries to provide for this new population. Large areas of former farmland was built on with the creation of vast numbers of brick terraced house streets of Victorian and Edwardian types of two-up two-down for the working class who had arrived from across Britain and Ireland, still used in the 21st century. Many new streets near Horwich Locomotive Works were named after famous engineers of the time. Local government in Horwich meets and is administered from a typical Victorian-style building which became known as Horwich Public Hall, a gift to the town by Peter Martin of The Street, Rivington in 1879 and still in use. The post-war years saw a boom in the builds of Council Houses. 

In 1937 the de Havilland Aircraft Company built a factory that supplied aircraft to Cobham&#x27;s Flying Circus. During World War II the factory manufactured variable pitch propellers for Spitfires, making it a target for German bombers, who in July 1942 attempted to raid the factory by employing some of Germany&#x27;s best pilots and crews in two Junkers JU 88 bombers in a mission using the Rivington reservoirs as landmarks to navigate at low level flying over the water then rooftops of Lever Park to find its target. The raid went off course due to low clouds. The company was taken over by Hawker Siddeley and subsequently British Aerospace, the site was halved and moved to the south side of Hall lane Lostock when taken over by MBDA in 1997 it is still in 2013 making missiles and the site is now used for integration and test purposes. Horwich works was very active in armament production in the first and second world wars, in recognition George VI and his wife Queen Elizabeth visited the town in 1940.

In the period of the railway works from spring 1884 to 1983 Horwich changed drastically. The site first opened as the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) works, leading to a large complex for building and maintaining locomotives, the site replaced one at Miles Platting. 

Horwich Works was built on 142 hectares of land bought for £36,000. The first workshop, Rivington House opened in February 1887. It is 106.7 metres long by 16.8 metres wide. The long brick built workshops had full-height arched windows and were separated by tram and rail tracks. Work to construct the three-bay, 463.3 metres long, 36 metres wide, erecting shop began in March 1885. Inside it were 20 overhead cranes. By November 1886 the first locomotives arrived at the works for repair. 

The first Horwich built locomotive, Number 1008, left the works in 1887 and is preserved at the National Railway Museum.

In the First and Second World War, the works played a part in the war effort manufacturing tanks and munitions. The war led to women being employed in manufacturing at the site, but this did not continue in post-war years with occupational inequality persisting. 

The L&amp;YR amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway in 1922 becoming a constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, (LMS) in 1923. 

Horwich Works continued to build and repair locomotives for the LMS until the company was nationalised in 1948 by the Transport Act 1947, becoming British Railways. In 1962, British Railways transferred control of its main works to British Railways Workshops Division, with its headquarters in Derby. In 1970 it was renamed British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) and remained the town&#x27;s most significant employer.

Production changed and the last steam locomotive built at Horwich Works left on 27 November 1957, after which the works produced shunting diesel trains until 28 December 1962. It was reduced to repairing engines and maintaining railway wagons. On 18 February 1983 BREL announced that the works would close at the end of the year. Protest marches and spirited trade union resistance failed to alter the decision and at 1 pm on Friday, 23 December 1983 Horwich Works closed after 97 years. The town went through a period of high unemployment afterward, The freehold of the railway works site was transferred from British Rail to Bolton Council in the mid-1990s.

A proposal to demolish the works and build 1,700 homes and a school was submitted to Bolton Council in early 2010. The initial phase of the development commenced in 2019.

Asbestos used to insulate steam engines and railway carriages linked to mesothelioma has been a legacy affecting former workers and their families with asbestos dust also being carried in clothing. The redevelopment of the site required it to be cleared of contaminants before building commenced.

With the closure of Horwich Locomotive Works and other heavy industries, the town went through a period of hardship until the development of the Middlebrook Retail Park and the arrival in the town of Bolton Wanderers Football Club, which revived the service and retail sectors, alongside this the town is now known for sub-urban residential accommodation with the benefit of access to the motorway and other transport links. The economic area is centered around the Middlebrook area, this is planned to expand with new industrial areas being built toward Blackrod.

==Governance==
Horwich was within the county boundaries of Lancashire from the 12th century and was a township in the historic ecclesiastical parish of Deane, in the Hundred of Salford. In 1837 Horwich joined with other townships and civil parishes to form the Bolton Poor Law Union and took joint responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law in that area and built a workhouse in Farnworth. The Horwich Local board of health was established in 1872 and was superseded by Horwich Urban District of the administrative county of Lancashire in 1894. Under the Local Government Act 1972 Horwich Urban District was abolished in 1974 and its area became a successor parish of the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in Greater Manchester and was removed from the county of Lancashire.

On 9 January 1974 Horwich was granted a Town Charter by the Earl Marshal, giving Horwich the status of a town, a town council and the ability to elect a Mayor. An official coat of arms was granted and assigned on 6 December 1974 by the Earl Marshal.

Horwich is covered by two electoral Wards of the Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council, the Horwich South and Blackrod, and Horwich North Wards. Each Ward elects three councillors to the Metropolitan Borough Council. Horwich Town Council, formed in 1974, has eight Wards; Vale, Bridge, Lever Park, Church, Claypool, Brazley, Central and Fall Birch which elect 14 representatives to the Town Council.

Horwich is part of the Bolton West Constituency. Its Member of Parliament is Phil Brickell from the Labour Party who first won the parliamentary seat at the 2024 General Election.

Horwich extends to and measures from north to south and west to east. The River Douglas flowing in a south westerly direction forms part of its northern boundary. The landscape to the north is dominated by Winter Hill, Rivington Pike and the West Pennine Moors. The highest point is on the moors in the north from where the ground slopes down towards the south and west, where the lowest land is about . On Wilders and Horwich Moors the underlying rock is Millstone Grit, and in the intermediate slopes are found the Lower Coal Measures of the Lancashire Coalfield. The Middle Coal Measures are found in the southwest of the township.

Red Moss, 1.5 km south of the town centre, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) which was designated in 1995 because of its biological interest. Red Moss is the best example of lowland raised mire in Greater Manchester and is one of 21 SSSIs in the area. The site is managed by the Wildlife Trust for Lancashire, Manchester and North Merseyside.

After 1780 the population increased as the Industrial Revolution brought changes to the town but remained constant until 1885 when the locomotive works were built more than trebling the population in ten years.

==Economy==
Many of Horwich&#x27;s traditional industries, Horwich Works and W.T. Taylor&#x27;s cotton mill closed in the late 20th century. Regeneration was led by the construction of the Toughsheet Community Stadium for Bolton Wanderers at Middebrook in 1995. The development which stretches into neighbouring Lostock, attracted industrial and commercial users including Hitachi, generating jobs to replace those lost in the old industries and the area is now dominated by small and medium enterprises. E.ON and RBS have set up offices close the University of Bolton stadium. Watson Steel Structures founded in 1933 and BAe&#x27;s successor company, Matra BAe Dynamics operates from the Middlebrook area.

Horwich Parish Church of England Primary School occupies the listed premises built in 1832.

Our Lady&#x27;s school was built in 1886 on Chorley New Road and Holy Family Primary School on Victoria Road in 1894. Holy Family was the first Lancashire County Council school to be granted aided status under the Education Act 1944. The schools merged on the Victoria Road site as St. Mary&#x27;s RC Primary School.

==Religion==
Prior to the reformation a chapel of ease existed dedicated to St Mary&#x27;s Church in Deane. In 1565 the commissioners for &quot;removing superstitious ornaments&quot; took various items that were deemed idolatrous from the chapel. The local population were forced by various means to conform to the Church of England and as with all other towns and villages across the country Catholicism was suppressed and it was not until 1886 when Father Hampson opened St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church on Chorley New Road that the local Catholic population had a formal place of worship. The presbytery there was built by Father McGrath in 1906.

After the English Civil War, with the contrivance of the vicar of Deane, the Chapel of Horwich was used by nonconformists and in 1669 a conventicle, meeting of nonconformists, was reported at Horwich and the ringleaders were prosecuted. In 1672 a nonconformist service was held at Old Lord&#x27;s Farm, the home of the puritan Major Thomas Willoughby, a soldier of the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, who later become 11th Baron Willoughby of Parham. In 1716 Bishop Gastrell of Chester recovered the chapel for the established church. The chapel was replaced in 1782 and rebuilt as Holy Trinity Church, a Commissioners&#x27; Church, in 1831. Until 1853 became a parish in its own right with Holy Trinity as the parish church. After the non conformists were ejected from Horwich Chapel, Richard Pilkington built &quot;New Chapel&quot; between 1716 and 1719. It was enlarged in 1805. In 1890 the Unitarian Free Church was built on Church Street. In the 18th and 19th centuries other nonconformist churches and chapels were built.

Lee Lane Congregational Church, founded in 1754, closed in 2005 and was converted into a flats. It was originally built in 1856 on the site of an earlier build known as Horwich Lee Chapel built in 1774 on the site of an earlier house, also owned by Thomas Willoughby and was used for meetings from 1682 by Presbyterian members splitting away from the Rivington Unitarian Chapel as its doctrine changed.

The Independent Methodist chapel in Lee Lane was built in 1867, Methodism had been practised from 1810. Primitive Methodists had a chapel on Horwich Moor and where a Baptist church was built in 1890.

==Sport==

Bolton Wanderers F.C. play at the Toughsheet Community Stadium having moved from Burnden Park near Bolton town centre in 1997. Indoor facilities for sports training and major racket sports tournaments are provided at Bolton Arena, which was used for badminton events in the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

==Twin town==
In March 1990, Horwich and Crowborough, East Sussex entered into a unique twinning arrangement when they became the first towns within the United Kingdom to sign a town twinning charter. It was signed by the Mayors of Horwich and Crowborough at a ceremony in the Public Hall, Horwich on 22 March 1990 and the Town Hall, Crowborough on 27 March 1990. On the 25th anniversary of the Town Twinning, in March 2015, the Mayor of Horwich, Cllr. Richard E W Silvester and the Mayor of Crowborough, Cllr. Ronald G Reed signed 25th Anniversary celebratory Town Twinning documents in Crowborough Town Hall on Tuesday 10 March 2015 and in Horwich Public Hall on Thursday 19 March 2015, to re-new the twinning agreement.

<text>Seoul Subway Line 3 (dubbed &quot;The Orange Line&quot;) of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway is a rapid transit service that connects Eunpyeong District to Gangnam and southeastern Seoul. Most trains head further northwest to serve Goyang via the Ilsan Line. In 2021, the Seoul Metro operated section had an annual ridership of 295,930,000 or 810,767 passengers per day.

In December 2010 the line is recorded as having the second highest Wi-Fi data consumption in the Seoul Metropolitan area. It averaged 1.8 times more than the other 14 subway lines fitted with Wi-Fi service zones.

== History ==
Construction began in 1980, and the first section of Line 3 opened (Gupabal–Yangjae; Jichuk opened in 1990) after the completion of work in two stages during 1985, along with subway Line 4. In October 1993, a second extension to the south was opened (Yangjae–Suseo).

In March 1996, the Korail Ilsan Line opened and allowed Line 3 trains to through operate all the way to the city of Goyang. There are two depots near Jichuk station and Suseo station, which are for both Korail and Seoul Metro.

A extension opened on February 18, 2010, stretching from Suseo to Garak Market (Line 8) and Ogeum (Line 5).

On December 27, 2014, Wonheung station opened between Wondang and Samsong stations.

== Tourism ==
In January 2013, the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation, published free guidebooks in three languages: English, Japanese and Chinese (simplified and traditional), which features eight tours as well as recommendations for accommodations, restaurants and shopping centers. The tours are designed with different themes for travel along the subway lines, e.g. Korean traditional culture, which goes from Jongno 3-ga station to Anguk station and Gyeongbokgung station on this line that showcases antique shops and art galleries of Insa-dong.

<text>The Uppland Regiment (), designation I 8, was a Swedish Army infantry regiment that traced its origins back to the 16th century. It was disbanded in 1957. The regiment&#x27;s soldiers were originally recruited from the province of Uppland, and it was later garrisoned there.

== History ==

The regiment has its origins in fänikor (companies) raised in Uppland in the 1550s and 1560s. In 1617, these units—along with fänikor from the nearby provinces of Dalarna and Västmanland—were organised by Gustav II Adolf into Upplands storregemente, of which eight of the total 24 companies were recruited in Uppland. Upplands storregemente consisted of three field regiments, of which Uppland Regiment was one. Sometime around 1623, the grand regiment was permanently split into 3 smaller regiments, of which Uppland Regiment was one.

The regiment was officially raised in 1626 although it had existed since 1623. Upplands regemente was one of the original 20 Swedish infantry regiments mentioned in the Swedish constitution of 1634. The regiment&#x27;s first commander was Nils Brahe. It was allotted in 1682 as one of the first regiments to be so.

The regiment was given the designation I 8 (8th Infantry Regiment) in a general order in 1816. Uppland Regiment was renamed Uppland Infantry Regiment in 1904 to distinguish it from Uppland Artillery Regiment. The regiment was garrisoned in Uppsala from 1912. In 1928, the regiment regained its old name. The regiment was disbanded in 1957. The signal regiment Uppland Signal Regiment was renamed to Uppland Regiment in 1974, but does not trace its origins from the original regiment, even though the victory names have been transferred to it.

==Heraldry and traditions==

===Colours, standards and guidons===
The regiment has carried a number of colour over the years. On 3 July 1855, His Majesty the King Oscar I presented a new colour to the regiment&#x27;s two battalions. The two colours only had two battle honours, Lützen and Kliszow. On 27 September 1955, His Majesty the King Gustaf VI Adolf presented a colour, which replaced the 1855 colours. The new colour had 12 battle honours. The colour was on 30 March 1957 handed over to the Uppland Signal Regiment, which carried it alongside its original colour.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of the arms of the Uppland Regiment (I 8). It was used by Uppland Group (&#x27;) 2000–2005 and by the Uppland and Västmanland Group (&#x27;) since 2005. Blazon: &quot;Gules, the provincial badge of Uppland, an orb or, banded and ensigned with a cross-crosslet. The shield surmounted two swords in saltire or&quot;.

===Medals===
In 1934, the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Royal Uppland Regiment (I 8) Medal of Merit&quot;) in gold, silver and bronze (UpplregGM/UpplregSM/UpplregBM) were established.

===Heritage===
Following the decision of the &quot;Riksdag&quot; on the disbandment of the regiment, a ceremony was held on 10 March 1957. After the regiment was disbanded, the regiment&#x27;s traditions were continued Uppland Signal Regiment, which also assumed the name of Uppland Regiment. From 2007, the traditions of the regiment were passed on to the Command and Control Regiment. From 1 July 2013, the regimental traditions will be continued by the Uppland Battalion, part of the Uppland and Västmanland Group (&quot;&quot;).

<text>The Uppland Regiment (), designations Ing 3, S 1 and S 1/Fo 47, was a Swedish Army signal regiment that traced its origins back to the 19th century. It was disbanded in 2006. The regiment was garrisoned in Uppland.

== History ==
The regiment has its origins in the field signal (later telegraphy) company raised in 1871 and subordinated to Pontoon Battalion in 1875. The company was redesignated as the Field Telegraph Corps and with designation Ing 3 (3rd Engineer Regiment) in 1902 when it became independent. An aircraft squadron was created in 1916 and split from the unit in 1926, this squadron would later become the Swedish Air Force.

The unit was reorganised and renamed to Signal Regiment with the designation S 1 (1st Signal Regiment) when the Swedish Army Signal Troops became a separate arm in 1937. A in 1915 detached company of the unit later became Norrland Signal Regiment and another in 1944 detached company later became Göta Signal Regiment.

It was renamed to Uppland Signal Regiment in 1957 and in 1974 to Uppland Regiment. The same name was used by the infantry regiment Uppland Regiment, although the signal regiment does not trace its origins from this regiment, even though the victory names were transferred to the signal regiment.

In 1974, the regiment gained the new designation S 1/Fo 47 as a consequence of a merge with the local defence district Fo 47. The designation was changed back to S 1 in 2000 when the defence district was disbanded. Uppland Regiment was disbanded in 2006 but was replaced by the Command and Control Regiment which took the role that the regiment previously had.

==Heraldry and traditions==

===Coat of arms===
The coat of the arms of the Uppland Regiment (S 1/Fo 47) 1974–2000 and the Uppland Regiment (S 1) 2000–2006. Blazon: &quot;Gules, the provincial badge of Uppland, a mound or, banded and ensigned with a cross-crosslet. The shield surmounted a cluster of bolts, or&quot;.

===Colours, standards and guidons===
Uppland Regiment presented two regimental colours.

====First colour of S 1====
The colour was presented to the regiment by His Majesty the King Carl XVI Gustaf in Enköping on 4 November 1976. The colour is drawn by Mrs Westberg and is embroidered by hand in insertion technique by the company Libraria. Blazon: &quot;On blue cloth in the centre the lesser coat of arms of Sweden, three open yellow crowns placed two and one. In the first corner a mullet with a cluster of rays, all yellow.

The shield ensigned with a royal crown proper.&quot;

====Second colour of S 1====
The colour was presented to the regiment in Enköping by the Supreme Commander, general Johan Hederstedt on 20 May 2000. The colour replaced an older which was presented to the former Royal Uppland Regiment (I 8) in 1955 and which was handed over to S 1 in 1957. The colour is drawn by Kristina Holmgård-Åkerberg and embroidered by hand in insertion technique by Sofie Thorburn. Blazon: &quot;On red cloth the provincial badge of Uppland; a yellow orb, banded and ensigned with a cross-crosslet. On a yellow border at the upper side of the colour, battle honours (Varberg 1565, Narva 1581, Lützen 1632, Warszawa 1656, Frederiksodde 1657, March Across the Belts 1658, Rügen 1678, Düna 1701, Kliszow 1702, Holovczyn 1708, Helsingborg 1710, Svensksund 1790) in red.&quot;

<doc id="1241997" wikidata="Q25230322" url="?curid=1241997" title="Medieval weights and measures">
<text>The following systems arose from earlier systems, and in many cases utilise parts of much older systems. For the most part they were used to varying degrees in the Middle Ages and surrounding time periods. Some of these systems found their way into later systems, such as the Imperial system and even SI.

== English system ==
Before Roman units were reintroduced in 1066 by William the Conqueror, there was an Anglo-Saxon (Germanic) system of measure, of which few details survive. It probably included the following units of length:

* &quot;fingerbreadth&quot; or &quot;digit&quot;
* &quot;inch&quot;
* &quot;ell&quot; or &quot;cubit&quot;
* &quot;foot&quot;
* &quot;perch&quot;, used variously to measure length or area
* &quot;acre&quot; and &quot;acre&#x27;s breadth&quot;
* &quot;furlong&quot;
* &quot;mile&quot;

The best-attested of these is the &quot;perch&quot;, which varied in length from 10 to 25 feet, with the most common value (16 feet or 5.03 m) remaining in use until the twentieth century.

Later development of the English system continued in 1215 in the Magna Carta. Standards were renewed in 1496, 1588 and 1758.

Some of these units would go on to be used in later Imperial units and in the US system, which are based on the English system from the 1700s.

== Danish system ==

From May 1, 1683, King Christian V of Denmark introduced an office to oversee weights and measures, a &quot;justervæsen&quot;, to be led by Ole Rømer. The definition of the &quot;alen&quot; was set to 2 Rhine feet. Rømer later discovered that differing standards for the Rhine foot existed, and in 1698 an iron Copenhagen standard was made. A pendulum definition for the foot was first suggested by Rømer, introduced in 1820, and changed in 1835. The metric system was introduced in 1907.

=== Length ===

* &quot;skrupel&quot; – Scruple, &quot;linie&quot;
* &quot;linie&quot; – Line, &quot;tomme&quot;
* &quot;tomme&quot; – Inch, &quot;fod&quot;
* &quot;palme&quot; – Palm, for circumference, 8.86 cm
* &quot;kvarter&quot; – Quarter, &quot;alen&quot;
* &quot;fod&quot; – Defined as a &quot;Rheinfuss&quot; 31.407 cm from 1683, before that 31.41 cm with variations.
* &quot;alen&quot; – Forearm, 2 &quot;fod&quot;
* &quot;mil&quot; – Danish mile. Towards the end of the 17th century, Ole Rømer connected the mile to the circumference of the earth, and defined it as 12000 &quot;alen&quot;. This definition was adopted in 1816 as the Prussian &quot;Meile&quot;. The coordinated definition from 1835 was 7.532 km. Earlier, there were many variants, the most commonplace the &quot;Sjællandsk miil&quot; of 17600 &quot;fod&quot; or 11.130 km.

=== Volume ===
* &quot;potte&quot; – Pot, from 1603 &quot;foot&quot;3
* &quot;smørtønde&quot; – Barrel of butter, defined as 136 &quot;potter&quot; from 1683
* &quot;korntønde&quot; – Barrel of corn, defined as 144 &quot;potter&quot; from 1683

=== Weight ===
* &quot;pund&quot; – Pound, from 1683 the weight of &quot;fot&quot;3 of water, 499.75 g

=== Miscellaneous ===
* &quot;dusin&quot; – 12
* &quot;snes&quot; – 20
* &quot;gross&quot; – 144

== Dutch system ==

The Dutch system was not standardised until Napoleon introduced the metric system. Different towns used measures with the same names but differing sizes.

Some common measures:

=== Length ===
*&quot;duim&quot; –2.54 cm
*&quot;kleine palm&quot; –3 cm
*&quot;grote palm&quot; –9.6 cm, after 1820, 10 cm
*&quot;voet&quot; –12 duim = abt. 29.54 cm, many local variations
*&quot;el&quot; – about 70 cm

=== Volume ===
*&quot;Pint&quot; – 0.6 L

=== Weight ===
*&quot;Ons, Once&quot; – pond = 30.881 g
*&quot;Pond&quot; (Amsterdam) – 494.09 g (other ponds were also in use)
*&quot;Scheepslast&quot; – 4000 Amsterdam &quot;pond&quot; = 1976.4 kg = 2.1786 short tons

== Finnish system ==

In Finland, approximate measures derived from body parts and were used for a long time, some being later standardised for the purpose of commerce. Some Swedish, and later some Russian units have also been used.

=== Length ===
*&quot;vaaksa&quot; – The distance between the tips of little finger and thumb, when the fingers are fully extended.
*&quot;kyynärä&quot; – c. 60 cm – The distance from the elbow to the fingertips.

== French system ==

In France, again, there were many local variants. For instance, the &quot;lieue&quot; could vary from 3.268 km in Beauce to 5.849 km in Provence. Between 1812 and 1839, many of the traditional units continued in &quot;metrified&quot; adaptations as the &quot;mesures usuelles&quot;.

In Paris, the redefinition in terms of metric units made 1 m = 443.296 &quot;ligne&quot; = 3 &quot;pied&quot; 11.296 &quot;ligne&quot;.

In Quebec, the surveys in French units were converted using the relationship 1 &quot;pied&quot; (of the French variety; the same word is used for English feet as well) = 12.789 inches (of English origin). Thus a square arpent was 5299296.0804 in2 or about 36,801 ft2 or 0.8448 acre.

There were many local variations; the metric conversions below apply to the Quebec and Paris definitions.

== Portuguese system ==
The various systems of weights and measures used in Portugal until the 19th century combine remote Roman influences with medieval influences from northern Europe and Islam.The Roman and northern European influences were more present in the north. The Islamic influence was more present in the south of the country. Fundamental units like the and the were imported by the northwest of Portugal in the 11th century, before the country became independent of León.

The gradual long-term process of standardization of weights and measures in Portugal is documented mainly since the mid-14th century. In 1352, municipalities requested standardization in a parliament meeting (). In response, Afonso IV decided to set the () of Lisbon as standard for the linear measures used for color fabrics across the country. A few years later, Pedro I carried a more comprehensive reform, as documented in the parliament meeting of 1361: the of Santarém should be used for weighing meat; the of Lisbon would be the standard for the remaining weights; cereals should be measured by the of Santarém; the of Lisbon should be used for wine. With advances, adjustments and setbacks, this framework predominated until the end of the 15th century.

Further information: Portuguese customary units.

== Romanian system ==

The measures of the old Romanian system varied greatly not only between the three Romanian states (Wallachia, Moldavia, Transylvania), but sometimes also inside the same country. The origin of some of the measures are the Latin (such as &quot;iugăr&quot; unit), Slavic (such as &quot;vadră&quot; unit) and Greek (such as &quot;dram&quot; unit) and Turkish (such as &quot;palmac&quot; unit) systems.

This system is no longer in use since the adoption of the metric system in 1864.

In 1855, a decimal reform was instituted that defined a new Swedish inch as foot. It did not last long, because the metric system was subsequently introduced in 1889. Up to the middle of the 19th century there was a death penalty for falsifying weights or measures.

=== Ottoman units ===
The Ottoman Empire (1299–1923), the predecessor of modern Turkey was one of the 17 signatories of the Metre Convention in 1875. For 58 years both the international and the traditional units were in use, but after the proclamation of the Turkish Republic, the traditional units became obsolete. In 1931 by Act No. 1782, international units became compulsory and the traditional units were banned from use starting 1 January 1933.

The traditional calendar of the Ottoman Empire was, like in most Muslim countries, the Islamic calendar. Its era begins from the Hijra in 622 CE and each year is calculated using the 12 Arabian lunar months, approximately eleven days shorter than a Gregorian solar year. In 1839, however, a second calendar was put in use for official matters. The new calendar, which was called the Rumi also began by 622, but with an annual duration equal to a solar year after 1840. In modern Turkey, the Gregorian calendar was adopted as the legal calendar, beginning by the end of 1925. But the Islamic calendar is still used when discussing dates in an Islamic context.

<doc id="1242009" wikidata="Q4866946" url="?curid=1242009" title="Basic command unit">
<text>A Basic Command Unit (BCU) is the largest unit into which territorial British Police forces are divided. BCU replaces the earlier terms &quot;Sub-Division&quot; and &quot;Division&quot; that had been in use since the 1880s. BCUs may alternatively be called an &quot;Area Command&quot; or a &quot;Division&quot;. They will also contain smaller, more local teams which are often called a &quot;Local Policing Unit&quot; (LPU) or a &quot;Local Policing Team&quot; (LPT). There are 228 BCUs (or equivalent units) in England and Wales.

Most forces are divided into at least three BCUs and some have many more. Most BCUs are further subdivided into smaller units. The BCU is usually commanded by a Chief Superintendent.

==Metropolitan Police==
Until recently the Metropolitan Police used the term Borough Operational Command Unit (BOCU) for regional units within Frontline Policing (previously known as Territorial Policing), the subdivision of the Met responsible for day-to-day policing within the 32 London boroughs.

Between 2017 and 2019 the 32 BOCUs were reorganised to form 12 new Basic Command Units, each incorporating between two and four of the original BOCUs (see the article on Collar numbers).

The term Operational Command Unit (OCU) is used for specialised units, for example the Aviation Security OCU.

==West Midlands Police==
West Midlands Police is split into 10 Local Policing Units (LPUs). Each LPU is in turn organized into four &quot;Core Policing Teams&quot; (CPTs) that manage its different core functions: Investigation, Neighbourhood, Response and Community Action and Priority Team (CAPT).

==Warwickshire Police==
Warwickshire Police has abolished BCUs, the first British territorial police force to do so. The force is now divided directly into five Districts, each headed by a Chief Inspector. These were formerly grouped into two Areas (BCUs), North and South, each headed by a Chief Superintendent.

<text>Seoul Subway Line 4 of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway is a long line crossing from the southwest to the northeast across the Seoul Metropolitan Area. The central section in Seoul City is operated by Seoul Metro with some trains offering through service to Korail&#x27;s Ansan and Gwacheon Lines. The southern terminus (Oido) is in Jeongwang 4-dong, Siheung City, and the northern terminus (Jinjeop) is in Jinjeop-eup, Namyangju-si, Gyeonggi-do; the newly built northern section (officially called the Jinjeop Line) is correspondingly owned by a company owned by Namyangju-si, with operations contracted to Seoul Metro. In 2022, the Seoul Metro operated section (excluding the Jinjeop Line) had an annual ridership of 219,587,000 or about 601,608 passengers per day.

Express train service stops at all stations between Danggogae and Sanbon, then at Sangnoksu, Jungang, Choji, Ansan, Jeongwang, and Oido. The express service only operates during rush hours on weekdays.

<text>The Southern Carpathians (also known as the Transylvanian Alps; ; ) are a group of mountain ranges located in southern Romania. They cover the part of the Carpathian Mountains located between the Prahova River in the east and the Timiș and Cerna Rivers in the west. To the south they are bounded by the Balkan Mountains in eastern Serbia.

==Heights==
The Southern Carpathians are the second highest group of mountains in the Carpathian Mountain range (after Tatra), reaching heights of over 2,500 meters. Although considerably smaller than the Alps, they are classified as having an alpine landscape. Their high mountain character, combined with great accessibility, makes them popular with tourists and scientists.

The highest peaks are:
* Moldoveanu Peak, 2,544 metres – Făgăraș Mountains
* Negoiu, 2,535 metres – Făgăraș Mountains
* Parângu Mare, 2,519 metres – Parâng Mountains
* Omu Peak 2,514 metres – Bucegi Mountains
* Peleaga, 2,509 metres – Retezat Mountains

Despite the heights, some of the most accessible passages in the Carpathians in Romania are along the rivers, which cross the mountain range (the Olt River) or form wide valleys (along the Prahova River Valley or along the Jiu River Valley).

==Geology==
The South Carpathians represent an intricate pile of tectonic nappes, overthrusted from west eastwards during the Austrian (Middle Cretaceous) and Laramian paroxysmal phases, corresponding to various plate fragments. The napes are (from west eastwards): the Supragetic, Getic, Severin and Danubian Units. The Getic Nappe was identified by Murgoci (1905), while the general understanding over the Alpine structure of the South Carpathians was later refined by Codarcea (1940), Codarcea et al. (1961), Năstăseanu et al. (1981), Săndulescu (1984), Săndulescu and Dimitrescu (2004), and Mutihac (1990). The first to apply the global tectonics concepts for the Romanian Carpathians were Rădulescu and Săndulescu (1973).

The Supragetic, Getic Nappes as well as the Danubian Units represent units with both a metamorphic basement and a sedimentary cover, while the Severin Nappe includes only a sedimentary sequence. The Getic Nappe and the Danubian Units sediments include a Palaeozoic sequence (Upper Carboniferous, Lower Permian) and a Mesozoic sequence (Lowermost Jurassic – Middle Cretaceous). The Supragetic Nappe comprises mainly metamorphosed rocks (gneisses, micashists), while the Severin Nappe includes only Upper Jurassic – Lower Cretaceous sediments.

==Mountain ranges==

From east to west, four mountain groups can be identified, separated by different river valleys.

<doc id="1242027" wikidata="Q7705936" url="?curid=1242027" title="Testosterone poisoning">
<text>Testosterone poisoning is a popular term used to explain behaviors that are deemed excessively masculine. It is also used by transfeminine people including transgender women and nonbinary individuals to describe the negative effects that testosterone has had on their bodies.

==Origins==

An early printed reference to &quot;testosterone poisoning&quot; came in 1975 from actor Alan Alda. In a parody of self-help writing, Alda diagnosed the &quot;ailment&quot; of masculinity and offered methods for its &quot;cure&quot;. He wrote:
Ten years later, that same sentence from Alda&#x27;s article was quoted in the 1985 book &quot;A Feminist Dictionary&quot;.

Carl Sagan gave the phrase more publicity when he praised Moondance magazine writer Daniela Gioseffi&#x27;s American Book Award winner &quot;Women on War&quot; as follows: &quot;A book of searing analysis and cries from the heart on the madness of war. Why is the half of humanity with a special sensitivity to the preciousness of life, the half untainted by testosterone poisoning, almost wholly unrepresented in defense establishments and peace negotiations worldwide?&quot; A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; op-ed piece accused Sagan of &quot;pompously inform[ing] us that the whole planet is imminently endangered by &#x27;testosterone poisoning&#x27;&quot;.

Bruce Tremper used the term in &quot;The Avalanche Review&quot;, stating that being &quot;a man&quot; is best proven by dying &quot;a stupendously violent death&quot;.

==Psychology==

A 1996 &quot;Psychology Today&quot; article referred to the phrase as &quot;only a joke&quot;, but noted that a study about testosterone and male employment had shown that testosterone levels were lower for successful new male employees at a southern U.S. oil firm than they were for new male employees who had quit their jobs or been terminated.

Berenbaum &quot;et al.&quot; (1997) said that exposure to high levels of androgens &quot;in utero&quot; is associated with higher levels of adult aggression. Mazur &quot;et al.&quot; (1998) stated that males with higher testosterone levels tend to be slightly more aggressive than other males. The authors suggested that higher testosterone levels were a result of aggressive behavior, not a cause of it.

In &quot;Family and Friends&#x27; Guide to Domestic Violence&quot;, Elaine Weiss wrote that &quot;deadly testosterone poisoning&quot; (DTP) is one of &quot;many misunderstandings about abusive men&quot;. She continued: &quot;[This] is not a war of the hormones, an inevitable biological clash between estrogen and testosterone. If it were, then there would be more of it; every heterosexual relationship would be abusive&quot;.

McDermott (2007) found a significant positive relationship between levels of testosterone and aggression. However, the link between testosterone and aggression was questioned in a 2010 study published in &quot;Nature&quot;. According to that study, &quot;a single dose of testosterone in women causes a substantial increase in fair bargaining behaviour, thereby reducing bargaining conflicts and increasing the efficiency of social interactions. However, subjects who believed that they received testosterone—regardless of whether they actually received it or not—behaved much more unfairly than those who believed that they were treated with placebo.&quot;

==Usage==
Antonia Feitz protested the use of the expression in a 1999 essay in the &quot;Australian Daily Issues Paper&quot;, calling it hate speech.

Beth Gallagher&#x27;s &quot;Salon.com&quot; essay &quot;Road Sows&quot;, which discussed sports utility vehicles, asserted that &quot;Not long ago, if you found yourself being tailed within an inch of your life
by one of these monsters, you could be reasonably sure that testosterone poisoning was at work. But now I don&#x27;t even bother to check my makeup — the macho creep back there is as likely to be the soccer mom next door, or even her mom...&quot; Several readers submitted &quot;testosterone poisoning&quot; to a 2001 &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; competition to find a male equivalent for hysteria (which was originally regarded as a female-only condition). Dr. Karl Albrecht made testosterone poisoning a synonym for male chauvinism in his 2002 book &quot;The Power of Minds at Work: Organizational Intelligence in Action&quot;; he described the phenomenon as one of 17 basic syndromes of dysfunction.

In a 2003 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; essay, Kay S. Hymowitz chided Western feminists for neglecting the rights of Third World women in Muslim countries; she wrote: &quot;There is no need, in their minds, to distinguish between Osama, Saddam, and Bush: They&#x27;re all suffering from testosterone poisoning&quot;. 

Magazine editor Tina Brown used the phrase thematically in a 2005 &quot;Washington Post&quot; essay about the downfall of Harvard University president Larry Summers and the problems of Disney&#x27;s former embattled CEO Michael Eisner.

The term is also sometimes used in a humorous context by transfeminine people, including transgender women, to describe how testosterone has damaged their bodies. Masculine secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair, muscle growth, and a deepened voice are often jokingly referred to as symptoms of testosterone poisoning in transgender contexts. While this usage of the term is far less common than the original, it also uses humor to criticize the effects of testosterone on the body.

<text>Hyperandrogenism is a medical condition characterized by high levels of androgens. It is more common in women than men. Symptoms of hyperandrogenism may include acne, seborrhea, hair loss on the scalp, increased body or facial hair, and infrequent or absent menstruation. Complications may include high blood cholesterol and diabetes. It occurs in approximately 5% of women of reproductive age.
Polycystic ovary syndrome accounts for about 70% of hyperandrogenism cases. Other causes include Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, insulin resistance, hyperprolactinemia, Cushing&#x27;s disease, certain types of cancers, and certain medications. Diagnosis often involves blood tests for testosterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and prolactin, as well as a pelvic ultrasound.
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Symptoms of hyperandrogenism can be treated with birth control pills or antiandrogens, such as cyproterone acetate or spironolactone. Other measures may include hair removal techniques.
The earliest known description of the condition is attributed to Hippocrates.

In 2011, the International Association of Athletics Federations (now World Athletics) and IOC (International Olympic Committee) released statements restricting the eligibility of female athletes with high testosterone, whether through hyperandrogenism or as a result of a difference in sex development (DSD). These regulations were referred to by both bodies as hyperandrogenism regulations and have led to athletes with DSDs being described as having hyperandrogenism. They were revised in 2019 to focus more specifically on DSDs.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Hyperandrogenism affects 5–10% of women of reproductive age. Hyperandrogenism can affect both men and women but is more noticeable in women since elevated levels of androgens in women may facilitate virilization. Because hyperandrogenism is characterized by elevated male sex hormone levels, symptoms of hyperandrogenism in men are often negligible. Hyperandrogenism in women is typically diagnosed in late adolescence with a medical evaluation. The medical evaluation usually consists of a pelvic exam, observation of external symptoms, and a blood test measuring androgen levels. Symptoms may include the following:
===Women===

Hyperandrogenism, especially high levels of testosterone, can cause serious adverse effects if left untreated. High testosterone levels are associated with other health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, amenorrhea (cessation of menstrual cycles), and ovulatory dysfunction, which can lead to infertility. Prominent signs of hyperandrogenism are hirsutism (unwanted growth of hair, especially in the abdominal region and on the back), adult acne, deepening of the voice, and alopecia (balding).

Hyperandrogenism has also been observed to increase insulin tolerance, which can lead to type two diabetes and dyslipidemia, such as high cholesterol. These effects may have psychological impacts, sometimes leading to social anxiety and depression, especially in adolescent girls and young women. Paired with obesity and hirsutism, it can cause the individual to have low self-esteem.

===Men===

Administration of high-dose testosterone in men over a course of weeks can cause an increase in aggression and hypomanic symptoms, though these were seen in only a minority of subjects. Acute high-dose anabolic-androgenic steroid administration in males attenuates endogenous sex hormone production and affects the thyroid hormone axis. Effects on mood and aggression observed during high-dose anabolic-androgenic steroid administration may occur secondarily to hormonal changes. Many of the same signs and symptoms that are seen in women, such as alopecia and acne, may also be found in men. Enlargement of the prostate may also occur.

== Causes ==

While hyperandrogenism in women can be caused by external factors, it can also appear spontaneously.

=== Polycystic ovary syndrome ===

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder characterized by an excess of androgens produced by the ovaries. It is estimated that approximately 90% of women with PCOS demonstrate hypersecretion of these hormones. The cause of this condition is unknown. Speculations include genetic predisposition; however, the gene or genes responsible for this remain unidentified. The condition may have a hereditary basis. Other possible causes include elevated insulin production. Most cases of PCOS involve insulin resistance. It is thought that adipose tissue dysfunction plays a role in the insulin resistance seen in PCOS. Insulin can induce excess testosterone secretion from the ovaries. A complication associated with polycystic ovary syndrome is high cholesterol, which is treated with statins. In a meta-analysis, atorvastatin was shown to decrease androgen concentrations in people with hyperandrogenism.

Elevated insulin leads to lower production of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a regulatory glycoprotein that suppresses the function of androgens. High blood levels of insulin also work in conjunction with ovarian sensitivity to insulin to cause hyperandrogenemia, the primary symptom of PCOS. Obese individuals may be more biologically inclined to PCOS due to markedly higher insulin. This hormonal imbalance can lead to chronic anovulation, in which the ovaries fail to release mature eggs. These cases of ovulatory dysfunction are linked to infertility and menstrual disturbances. A post hoc analysis from a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study carried out at 11 secondary care centres, as well as a longitudinal single-centre study on pregnant women in Norway, also determined that metformin had no effect on maternal androgens in pregnancies occurring in the setting of PCOS.

One systemic review suggested that polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor gene are associated with the prognosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, though this is based on small sample sizes and is debated. Studies have shown benefits for vitamin D supplementation in women with vitamin D deficiency and PCOS.

Hyperinsulinemia can increase the production of androgens in the ovaries. One context in which this occurs is HAIR-AN syndrome, a rare subtype of PCOS.

===Hyperthecosis and hyperinsulinemia===

Hyperthecosis occurs when the cells of the ovarian stroma transition from interstitial cells, located between other cells, into luteinized theca cells. Theca cells are located in the ovarian follicles and become luteinized when the ovarian follicle bursts and a new corpus luteum is formed. The dispersal of luteinized theca cells throughout the ovarian stroma—in contrast to their distribution in PCOS, in which luteinized theca cells occur around cystic follicles only—causes women with hyperthecosis to have higher testosterone levels and virilization than women with PCOS. Elevated insulin is also characteristic of hyperthecosis. Hyperthecosis most commonly develops in postmenopausal women and is linked to acne, hirsutism, growth of the clitoris, baldness, and voice deepening.

Obesity can play a role in insulin resistance. It makes thecal cells more responsive to luteinizing hormone. Therefore, obesity increases ovarian androgen production. Additionally, obesity elevates inflammatory adipokines which leads to not only adipogenesis, but also heightened insulin resistance.

===Cushing&#x27;s syndrome===

Cushing&#x27;s syndrome develops as a result of long-term exposure to the hormone cortisol. Cushing&#x27;s syndrome can either be exogenous or endogenous, depending on whether it is caused by an external or internal source, respectively. The intake of glucocorticoids, a type of corticosteroid, is a common cause for the development of exogenous Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Endogenous Cushing&#x27;s syndrome can occur when the body produces excess cortisol. This occurs when the hypothalamus of the brain signals to the pituitary gland with excess corticotropin-releasing hormone, which in turn secretes adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). ACTH then causes the adrenal glands to release cortisol into the blood. Signs of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome include muscle weakness, easy bruising, weight gain, male-pattern hair growth (hirsutism), coloured stretch marks, and an excessively reddish complexion in the face. Cushing&#x27;s syndrome can cause androgen excess and hence the signs and symptoms of hyperandrogenism.

===Congenital adrenal hyperplasia===

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) describes a group of autosomal recessive disorders that cause a lack of an enzyme necessary for the production of cortisol and/or aldosterone, steroid hormones produced by the adrenal cortex. Most cases of CAH are due to 21-hydroxylase deficiencies. The heightened androgen levels seen in congenital adrenal hyperplasia affect the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. Heightened androgen levels can also affect the ovaries, which can lead to infertility as well as chronic anovulation.

Since CAH consists of multiple disorders, the signs, symptoms and severity of hyperandrogenism may stem from a variety of specific mutations. Genotyping is therefore critical to verify diagnoses and to establish prognostic factors for individuals. Genotyping is also crucial for people seeking to use genetic counselling as an aid to family planning.

In women, CAH causes ambiguous genitals at birth and excessive pubic hair, enlargement of the clitoris, and hirsutism in adolescence. Although CAH causes rapid growth in childhood, adult women with CAH are shorter than average due to early puberty and closure of the growth plates in the long bones. Symptoms in males include early showings of pubic hair, enlargement of the penis, and rapid musculoskeletal growth.

=== Tumors ===

==== Adrenocortical carcinoma and tumors ====
Adrenocortical carcinoma occurs rarely; the average incidence rate is estimated to be 1–2 cases per million annually. The disease involves the formation of cancerous cells within the cortex of one or both of the adrenal glands. Although these tumors are identified in fewer than two percent of patients diagnosed with hyperandrogenism, the possibility must be considered within this population. In one study, more than half of tumor-affected patients had elevated levels of the androgens androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and testosterone. The elevation of androgens caused by adrenocortical carcinomas often causes patients to develop Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, primary aldosteronism, and hyperandrogenism. The molecular basis of the disease has yet to be elucidated.

==== Adenoma of the adrenal gland ====
Adrenal adenomas are benign tumors of the adrenal gland. In most cases, the tumors display no symptoms and require no treatment. In rare cases, however, some adrenal adenomas may become activated. When activated, the adenoma begins to produce hormones in much larger quantities than what the adrenal glands would normally produce, leading to health complications including primary aldosteronism and hyperandrogenism.

==== Arrhenoblastoma ====

Arrhenoblastoma is an uncommon tumor of the ovary. It is composed of sterol cells, Leydig cells, or some combination of the two. The tumor can produce male or female hormones and may cause masculinization. In a prepubescent child, a tumor may cause precocious puberty. Malignant arrhenoblastoma accounts for 30% of cases of arrhenoblastoma, the other 70% being largely benign and curable with surgery.

==== Hilar cell tumor ====

A hilar cell tumor is an androgen-producing ovarian tumor that is most commonly found in older women and often leads to the development of male sex characteristics. The tumor tends to occur around the region of the ovary where the blood vessels enter the organ, known as the hilum. This type of tumor tends to be small in size and in most cases can be entirely removed and its symptoms reversed through surgery.

==== Krukenberg tumor ====

A Krukenberg tumor is a quickly developing malignant tumor found in one or both ovaries. In most cases, the tumor primarily originates from tissues in the stomach, pancreas, gallbladder, colon, or breast. It colonized the ovary by spreading through the peritoneal cavity. These tumors cause virilization. Increased androgen production due to elevations in human chorionic gonadotropin is hypothesized as the main cause of hyperandrogenism in women with Krukenberg tumors.

=== Menopause ===
The end of ovulation and the beginning of menopause can result in hyperandrogenism. During this transition, the body stops releasing estrogen at a faster rate than it stops releasing androgens. In some cases, the difference between the lower estrogen levels and higher androgen levels can produce hyperandrogenism. A decrease in sex hormone levels while the free androgen index increases can also contribute to this process.

===Drugs===
Many drugs can provoke symptoms of hyperandrogenism. These symptoms include, but are not limited to hirsutism, acne, dermatitis, androgenic alopecia, irregularities in menstruation, clitoral hypertrophy, and the deepening of the voice. Drugs most frequently implicated in hyperandrogenism include anabolic steroids, synthetic progestins, and antiepileptics; however, many other drugs may also cause hyperandrogenism. This can happen through one of five mechanisms: the direct introduction of androgens to the body, the binding of the drug to androgen receptors (as is the case with anabolic-androgenic steroids), a reduction of sex hormone-binding globulin plasma concentration that leads to an increase in free testosterone, interference with the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian (HPO) axis, or an increase in the release of adrenal androgens. Certain drugs cause hyperandrogenism through mechanisms that remain unclear. For example, the molecular basis by which valproate induces hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary syndrome has yet to be determined. However, one study showed that women taking valproic acid had higher testosterone levels and incidences of hyperandrogenism compared to women who were not taking valproic acid.

=== Heredity ===
Hyperandrogenism can appear as a symptom of many different genetic and medical conditions. Some of the conditions with hyperandrogenic symptoms, including PCOS, may sometimes be hereditary. Additionally, it is thought that epigenetics may contribute to the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome.

One potential cause of PCOS is maternal hyperandrogenism, whereby hormonal irregularities in the mother can affect the development of the child during gestation, resulting in the passing of polycystic ovary syndrome from mother to child. However, no androgen elevations were found in the umbilical cord blood of children born to mothers with PCOS.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosing hyperandrogenism can be complex due to the wide variety and severity of signs and symptoms that may present. It is most often diagnosed by checking for signs of hirsutism according to a standardized method that scores the range of excess hair growth.

Girls may show symptoms of hyperandrogenism early in life, but physicians become more concerned when the patient is in her late teens or older.

Checking medical history and a physical examination of symptoms are used for an initial diagnosis. Patient history assessed includes age at thelarche, adrenarche, and menarche; patterns of menstruation; obesity; reproductive history; and the start and advancement of hyperandrogenism symptoms. Patterns of menstruation are examined since irregular patterns may accompany hyperandrogenism. Other conditions that may present alongside hirsutism that can contribute to diagnosis include androgenic alopecia and acne. If hyperandrogenism is severe, virilization may occur.

Family history is also assessed for occurrences of hyperandrogenism symptoms or obesity in other family members.

Laboratory tests can measure FSH, luteininzing hormone, DHEAS, prolactin, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and total and free testosterone in the blood. Abnormally high levels of any of these hormones help in diagnosing hyperandrogenism.

== Prevention ==
Since risk factors are not known and vary among individuals with hyperandrogenism, there is no sure method to prevent the condition. Accordingly, more long-term studies are needed to find a cause of the condition before a sufficient method of prevention can be established.

Despite this, there are a few things that can help avoid long-term medical issues related to hyperandrogenism and PCOS. Getting checked by a medical professional for hyperandrogenism — especially if one has a family history of the condition, irregular periods, or diabetes — can be beneficial. A healthy weight and diet may reduce the chances, as continued exercise and a healthy diet lead to an improved menstrual cycle, decreased insulin levels, and lowered androgen concentrations.

==Treatment==

There is no definitive treatment for hyperandrogenism as it varies with the underlying condition that causes it. As a hormonal symptom of PCOS, menopause, and other endocrine conditions, it is primarily treated as a symptom of these conditions. Drugs may be considered only in women who do not plan on becoming pregnant in the near future. Some effective drugs for facial hirsutism includes eflornithine, which may cause birth defects in pregnant women. Retinoids and antibiotics can be used for acne and minoxidil for alopecia. Systemically, it is treated with antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate, flutamide and spironolactone to reduce androgenic signaling. For hyperandrogenism caused by late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia (LOCAH), treatment is primarily focused on providing the patient with glucocorticoids to combat the low cortisol production and the corresponding increase in androgens caused by the increase in size of the adrenal glands. Estrogen-based oral contraceptives are used to treat both LOCAH- and PCOS-associated hyperandrogenism. These hormonal treatments reduce the androgen excess and suppress adrenal androgen production, bringing about a significant decrease in hirsutism.

Hyperandrogenism is often managed symptomatically. Hirsutism and acne both respond well to the hormonal treatments described above, with 60–100% of patients reporting an improvement in hirsutism. Androgenic alopecia however, does not show an improvement with hormonal treatments and requires other treatments, such as hair transplantation.

Supplementation can also contribute to the managing the symptomatic effects of hyperandrogenism. In a meta-analysis, high-dose vitamin D supplements given to women with vitamin D deficiency due to PCOS improved glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, and cholesterol levels, as well as lowering testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and the free androgen index, all of which are associated with hyperandrogenism. Vitamin D supplementation in women with vitamin D deficiency but without PCOS did not show the same results.

=== Targeting insulin resistance and obesity ===
Lifestyle modifications are the first-line treatment for PCOS. They help improve body composition, insulin resistance, and hyperandrogenism. However, it is unclear whether they help improve mood, quality of life, and reproductive outcomes. A meta-analysis study in 2017 showed that bariatric surgery in women with severe obesity and PCOS decreased levels of total and free testosterone and helped correct hirsutism and menstrual dysfunction.

Insulin resistance in women with PCOS is typically treated with insulin-sensitizer drugs such as metformin. Metformin can help to decrease weight and androgen levels. When combined with lifestyle modifications (changes in diet and exercise), it has been linked with lower body mass index and a reduction in menstrual problems. However, the use of metformin in women with PCOS should only be considered in patients with impaired glucose tolerance.

== Society and culture ==
Because androgen excess is manifested in noticeable physical features (such as hirsutism), social stigma may be associated with it.

=== Sports ===
Current evidence-based studies show that unusually high levels of circulating testosterone are associated with increased athletic performance in women, unless they lack androgen sensitivity. However, controversy has emerged in the form of the claim that testosterone is not unlike any other physical parameter with reference to bestowing advantages or disadvantages on female athletes. Existing regulations throughout competitive sports are currently being refined to specifically address this particular claim.
Following the case of South African athlete Caster Semenya, an athlete with a difference in sex development (DSD), the International Association of Athletics Federations introduced its hyperandrogenism regulations, which restricted women with high testosterone levels, whether the hormones were produced by ovaries, adrenals, or testes. These regulations replaced the earlier sex verification rules.

Following a series of legal challenges, regulations called the Eligibility Regulations for the Female Classification (Athletes with Differences of Sexual Development) were released on 1 May 2019. These regulations apply only to athletes who have a DSD, high testosterone and virilization, and no longer include hyperandrogenism from non-DSD-related causes such as PCOS. Such DSDs, often seen in people who have a Y chromosome and testes, include 5α‐reductase deficiency, partial androgen insensitivity, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

=== Social definition ===
Cultural variation can define hyperandrogenism socially—apart from clinical and chemical definitions—to make some hair growth unacceptable even if it is considered clinically normal based on metrics like the Ferriman-Gallwey score. For example, only pubic and axillary hair may be tolerated in North American women, while other androgen-dependent hair such as growth on the upper lip, over the linea alba, on the thighs, and around the areola is not.

=== Organizations ===
Professional organizations such as the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society exist to promote the research, treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of such disorders and to educate the public and scientific community about them.

InterACT, an intersex organization, listed hyperandrogenism as an intersex variation in a glossary from 2022.

<text>The Min River () is a in central Sichuan province, China. It is a tributary of the upper Yangtze River, which flows through Chengdu and joins at Yibin. Within China, it was traditionally taken as the main course of the upper Yangtze before extensive exploration of its sources.

==Geography==
The Min River flows in the general southern direction. It starts in north-central Sichuan, where its basin is limited by the Qionglai Mountains in the west and the Min Mountains in the east. The river passes through the Longmen Mountains and enters the plains of the Sichuan Basin near Dujiangyan. In that area, the ancient Irrigation System and the modern Zipingpu dam are located. The Giant Buddha of Leshan is built into the stone banks of the Min River.

==Names==
Some 19th-century Western authors used the name Blue River as the &quot;colloquial name&quot; for the Minjiang, after the former local Chinese name &quot;Qingshui&quot; (,  &quot;Clear water&quot;), and the belief that the Min constituted the main course of the Yangtze, which was itself known to Europeans as the &quot;Blue River&quot;.

==Wildlife==
A survey by biologist Deng Qixiang found that only 16 of the 40 fish species recorded in the 1950s can be found today. The Sichuan Taimen, a protected species, has not been seen in one stretch of river, the Wenchuan, for an entire decade.

==History==
Located along the Min River is the oldest surviving water management scheme built by hydraulic engineer Li Bing, helping to significantly expand the power of the Qin state and triggering a population boom in the Chengdu plain. It was built about 2,300 years ago. The first Western academic to research its history was Joseph Needham. The scheme became known as the Dujiangyan Irrigation System.

==Dams==
The Min is being heavily developed, primarily for hydroelectric power. Twenty-seven dams have been completed, are under construction, or are planned for the river as of March 2014. Those dams are listed below from downstream to upstream.
*Pianchuangzi Dam – Planned, 740 MW

<doc id="1242035" wikidata="Q1937808" url="?curid=1242035" title="Shipping (fandom)">
<text>Shipping (derived from the word &quot;relationship&quot;) is the desire by followers of a fandom for two or more people, either real-life people or fictional characters (in film, literature, television series, etc.), to be in a romantic relationship. Shipping often takes the form of unofficial creative works, including fanfiction and fan art.

Shipping may take the form of same-sex, polyamorous, or love-hate relationships. Interspecies pairings and pairings with large age differences between characters can give rise to shipping discourse related to the ethics of such ships. Shipping can also create conflict within fandoms and between a work&#x27;s creator(s) and its fans. Notable cases of shipping include the fandoms of &quot;Daria&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;.

==Etymology==
The usage of the term &quot;ship&quot; in its relationship sense appears to have been originated around 1995 by Internet fans of the TV show &quot;The X-Files&quot;, who believed that the two main characters, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, should be engaged in a romantic relationship. They called themselves &quot;relationshippers&quot; at first; then &quot;R&#x27;shipper&quot;, and finally just &quot;shipper&quot;.

The oldest recorded uses of the noun &quot;ship&quot; and the noun &quot;shipper&quot;, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, date back to 1996 postings on the Usenet group &quot;alt.tv.x-files&quot;; &quot;shipping&quot; is first attested slightly later, in 1997 and the verb &quot;to ship&quot; in 1998.

==Notation and terminology==
&quot;Ship&quot; and its derivatives in this context have since come to be in widespread usage. &quot;Shipping&quot; refers to the phenomenon; a &quot;ship&quot; is the concept of a fictional couple; to &quot;ship&quot; a couple means to have an affinity for it in one way or another; a &quot;shipper&quot; or a &quot;fangirl/boy&quot; is somebody significantly involved with such an affinity; and a &quot;shipping war&quot; is when two ships contradict each other, causing fans of each ship to argue. A ship that a particular fan prefers over all others is called an OTP, which stands for &quot;one true pairing&quot;.
When discussing shipping, a ship that has been confirmed by its series is called a &quot;canon ship&quot; or &quot;sailed ship&quot;, whereas a &quot;sunk ship&quot; is a ship that has been proven unable to exist in canon, or in other words, will never be real nor confirmed.

===Naming conventions===
Various naming conventions have developed in different online communities to refer to shipped couples, likely due to the ambiguity and cumbersomeness of the &quot;Character 1 and Character 2&quot; format.

The first method was using a slash, first used for Kirk/Spock. This is today mainly used for same-sex ships; fanfiction with these pairings is known as slash fiction.

Name blending is often used to refer to a couple, like &#x27;&#x27; for Kylo Ren and Rey in &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, &#x27;&#x27; for Dean Winchester and Castiel in the &quot;Supernatural&quot; TV series, Sonamy for Sonic The Hedgehog (character) and Amy Rose in the Sonic The Hedgehog series and &#x27;&#x27; referring to Princess Bubblegum and Marceline the Vampire Queen in &quot;Adventure Time&quot;. Portmanteaus and clipped compounds are used not only to abbreviate character pairings but also to create a name for the ship itself. For example, &#x27;&#x27; forms a clipped compound, and an abbreviated form of the complete names Keith and Lance in &quot;&quot;. &#x27;&#x27; in this case Dana Scully and Fox Mulder in &quot;The X-Files&quot;, is an example of surnames being blended, although most X-Files fans use the term &quot;&quot; (Mulder-Scully Relationship), as is &quot;MoonBoon&quot; to stand for Zarya Moonwolf and Kitty Boon in &quot;Mysticons&quot;. In other cases, first names of characters are merged, like the ships for Marcy Wu and Anne Boonchuy (Marcanne), Sasha Waybright and Marcy Wu (Sasharcy), and Sasha Waybright and Anne Boonchuy (Sashanne) in &quot;Amphibia&quot; or between Violet &quot;Vi&quot; and Caitlyn &quot;Cait&quot; Kiramman (Caitvi or CaitVi) in &quot;Arcane&quot;.

These combinations of names often follow systematic phonological principles, in which the first character in the ship&#x27;s name is seen as the &#x27;dominant&#x27; partner. Japanese ship naming conventions often attach names together without slashing or blending by using an XY name-name format. This format is ruled by boy-girl ordering, or seme-uke (top-bottom) in Yaoi. In many East Asian countries there is a distinct difference between the pairing of XY and YX. Such as the pairing names of &#x27;MomoYuki&#x27; (where Momo is dominant) vs. &#x27;YukiMomo&#x27; (where Yuki is dominant) from the series Idolish7.

Many fandom-specific variants exist and often use fandom-specific terminology. These often employ words that describe the relationship between characters in the context of the fictional universe and simply add the word &quot;Shipping&quot; to the end (For example, AmourShipping, NegaiShipping, PokeShipping, RocketShipping, and CookieShipping in &quot;Pokemon&quot;). Other terminology include using a combination of the characters&#x27; names and codes as a ship name. For instance, ship names for characters in &quot;RWBY&quot; include &quot;&quot; (Blake Belladonna and Yang Xiao Long) and &quot;White Rose&quot; (Weiss Schnee and Ruby Rose).

==Types of ships==
===Same-sex===
Within shipping, same-sex pairings are popular; they are sometimes known as &quot;slash and femslash&quot;. Within the anime/manga fandom, borrowed Japanese terms such as yaoi and yuri may be used. In the context of Chinese TV series, related same-sex pairings are also referred to as &quot;[[Tanbi] CP&quot;. A person who supports same-sex pairings and reads or writes [[slash fiction]] may be referred to as a &quot;slasher&quot;, although the Japanese term &quot;[[Yaoi fandom|fujoshi]]&quot; for women who like same-sex stories, and &quot;fudanshi&quot; as the male equivalent of that, are also commonly used within the community, especially by fans of yaoi (boy on boy) and fans of yuri (girl on girl).

The term &quot;slash&quot; predates the use of &quot;shipping&quot; by at least some 20 years. It was originally coined as a term to describe a pairing of [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] and [[Spock]] of &quot;[[Star Trek]]&quot;, [[Kirk/Spock]] (or &quot;K/S&quot;; sometimes spoken &quot;Kirk-slash-Spock&quot;, whence &quot;slash&quot;) homosexual [[fan fiction]]. Other early slash pairings came from characters in &quot;[[Starsky &amp; Hutch]]&quot; and &quot;[[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]]&quot;.&quot; For a time in the late 1970s and early 1980s, &quot;K/S&quot; was used to describe such fan fiction, regardless of whether or not they were related to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and eventually &quot;slash&quot; became a universal term to describe all homosexual-themed fan works. It now refers to a genre of [[fan fiction]] that focuses on [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[sexual attraction|sexual relationships]] between fictional characters of the same sex, Even so, the slash mark itself is a shorthand label for a romantic relationship, regardless of whether the pairing is heterosexual or homosexual, romantic, or erotic.

The first K/S stories were not immediately accepted by all &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans. Early slash fans in England feared that they would be arrested, because slash violated the obscenity laws there at the time. Many early slash stories were based on a pairing of two close friends, a &quot;hero dyad&quot;, or &quot;One True Pairing&quot;, such as Kirk/Spock or Starsky/Hutch; conversely, a classic pairing between [[Foil (literature)|foils]] was that of [[Roj Blake|Blake]]/[[Kerr Avon|Avon]] from &quot;[[Blake&#x27;s 7]]&quot;. With the advent of the Internet, slash fiction writers created mailing lists (which gradually took the place of [[amateur press association]]s), and websites such as [[FanFiction.Net]] (which gradually started taking the place of zines). With the Internet, the number of [[fandom]]s represented increased dramatically, especially those devoted to science fiction, fantasy, and police dramas. The Internet also increased the level of reader interaction, making it easier for fans to comment on stories, give episode reviews, and [[Meta (prefix)|discuss]] comment on trends in slash fandom itself. Websites and fanzines dedicated to fans of &quot;[[The X-Files]]&quot;, &quot;[[Stargate]]&quot;, &quot;[[Harry Potter]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]&quot; became common, with tens of thousands of slash stories available.

Due to the lack of canonical homosexual relationships in source media at the time that slash fiction began to emerge, some came to see slash fiction stories as being exclusively outside their respective canons and held that the term &quot;slash fiction&quot; applies only when the characters&#x27; same-sex romantic or erotic relationship about which an author writes is not part of the source&#x27;s canon and that fan fiction about [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] same-sex relationships is therefore not slash. Femslash, a subgenre of slash fiction which focuses on romantic and/or sexual relationships between female fictional characters, on the other hand, are typically [[heterosexual]] in the canon universe, but when fictions focus on lesbian characters, the stories are often labeled as femslash for convenience. Original slash stories are those that contain male/male content, based on perceived homoerotic subtext between fictitious characters. This can be sourced from a variety of media content, such as manga, TV shows, movies and books amongst others. These works are now generally published online and use the same forms of rating, warnings and terminology that is commonly used by slash writers.

In May 2020, &quot;[[She-Ra and the Princesses of Power]]&quot; showrunner [[ND Stevenson]] said that while shipping has been a great tool for fans, he does not want films or shows with just occasional glances, or for all same-sex relationships to be portrayed as shipping.

===Polyamory===
[[Love triangles]] are commonly used as a [[plot device]] to cause conflict in the story. The easy way around this is to pair all three together, or one member with both potential romantic partners. This is not to be confused with a [[Harem (genre)|harem]], which is usually just a single character being sought out by many others. Situations such as that may be the one to &quot;cause&quot; a [[polyamorous]] relationship or characters may be in such a relationship. [[Polyamory]] is not always caused by love triangles, but those that don&#x27;t tend to be less accepted by the fandom. In some fan fictions, characters are given a polyamorous identity, including warning &quot;poly readers that the central characters are monogamous.&quot;

===Interspecies===
Interspecies shipping is usually displayed in fandoms of media consisting of animals of various species or supernatural, mechanical, extraterrestrial and fantasy beings. Shipping a human character with an animal or [[Furry fandom|furry]] character can be controversial and has been accused of treading a contentious line with [[bestiality]].

===Age difference===

Controversial age differences have a wide range. An elderly adult with a young adult, anyone with an immortal or slowly aging being, teenagers with young adults, or even ships involving fictional children are all part of this category. Connected to this are continued arguments about which ships are &quot;best&quot; and &quot;right,&quot; with inevitable shipping wars.

===Love–hate===
Romances between two characters who canonically hate each other also occur. It is often interpreted that the characters share sexual tension between each other, having a [[love–hate relationship]]. An example would be pairing [[Daniel LaRusso]] and [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|his bully and rival Johnny]] from &quot;[[The Karate Kid]]&quot; and &quot;[[Cobra Kai]]&quot;. This is one of the most popular types of shipping.

==Notable fandoms==
===&quot;Daria&quot; fandom===
&quot;[[Daria]]&quot; was marked throughout its run by shipper debate, primarily over whether [[Daria Morgendorffer|the title character]] should have a relationship with Trent Lane. A common argument was that it would signal a turning away from the more subversive aspects of Daria&#x27;s character, such as bitter criticism of romantic relationships.

In a later episode, Tom Sloane, who became Jane&#x27;s boyfriend, is introduced, drawing a wedge between Jane and Daria, for instance. Daria and Tom warmed up to each other throughout the fourth season, leading up to its finale. With Jane and Tom&#x27;s relationship in crisis, a heated argument between Daria and Tom led up to a kiss in Tom&#x27;s car. In the TV movie &quot;Is it Fall Yet?&quot;, Daria decided to begin a relationship with Tom, and Daria and Jane patched up their friendship. This caused an uproar, and conversation turned to whether Tom was more appropriate than Trent had been. The debate was satirized by the show&#x27;s writers in a piece on MTV&#x27;s website.

In interviews done after the series&#x27; run, series co-creator [[Glenn Eichler]] revealed that &quot;any viewer who really thought that Daria and Trent could [have] a relationship was just not watching the show we were making,&quot; Tom came about because &quot;going into our fourth year... I thought it was really pushing credibility for Daria to have only had one or two dates during her whole high school career,&quot; and &quot;teaser&quot; episodes like &quot;Pierce Me&quot; were &quot;intended to provide some fun for that portion of the audience that was so invested in the romance angle. The fact that those moments were few and far between should have given some indication that the series was not about Daria&#x27;s love life.&quot;

===&quot;Harry Potter&quot; fandom===
The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series&#x27; most contentious ship debates came from supporters of various potential pairings:

* [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ron Weasley]] – &#x27;&#x27;; close friend of both Harry and Hermione. This pairing is canon.
* [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and Hermione Granger – &#x27;Harmione&#x27;; one of Harry&#x27;s closest friends. This pairing is non-canon.
* Harry Potter and [[Ginny Weasley]] – &#x27;&#x27;; Ron&#x27;s younger sister. This pairing is canon.
* Lily Evans ending up with either James Potter – &#x27;&#x27;, or [[Severus Snape]] – &#x27;&#x27;; the former pairing is canon.
* Remus Lupin ending up with either [[Nymphadora Tonks]] – &#x27;Remadora&#x27;, or [[Sirius Black]] – &#x27;[[Wolfstar]]&#x27;; The former pairing is canon.
* Harry Potter and [[Draco Malfoy]] – &#x27;[[Drarry]]&#x27;; This pairing is non-canon.
* Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy – &#x27;&#x27;; This pairing is non-canon.

Author [[J.K. Rowling]] appeared to refute the first possibility before the debates got started following the release of &quot;[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]&quot; in July 2000, when she stated in October 1999 that Harry and Hermione &quot;are very platonic friends&quot; after the release of &quot;[[Prisoner of Azkaban]]&quot; in July 1999. An interview with Rowling shortly after the release of &quot;[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]&quot;, in 2005 caused significant controversy within the fandom. An interviewer stated that Harry/Hermione fans were delusional, to which Rowling responded that they were &quot;still valued members of her readership&quot;, but that there had been &quot;anvil-sized hints&quot; for future Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny relationships incorporated in the book itself, and that Harry/Hermione shippers needed to re-read the books. This caused an uproar among Harry/Hermione shippers, some of whom claimed they would return their copies of &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; and boycott future &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books. Clare McBride of [[SYFY]] described the shipping wars between those who liked Harmione and Romione, calling them the &quot;Harmony Wars&quot;, saying they began in 1999 and 2000, and that &quot;tension between these two factions ran hot&quot;, with specific communities and fansites for each ship. McBride noted that Harmione also came to be known as &quot;HMS Harmony&quot; by fans, but that the 2005 interview in which MuggleNet’s Emerson Spartz stated that &quot;Harry/Hermione shippers&quot; were &quot;delusional&quot; led Harmione fans to &quot;openly insult Rowling&quot; and stated that this moment gave birth to shipping that &quot;only values a ship for whether it not it wins, not whether or not it is enjoyable.&quot;

Rowling&#x27;s attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated. In that same interview, she stated that she was a &quot;relative newcomer to the world of shipping&quot; and that it was &quot;extraordinary&quot; to meet the shippers, calling it a &quot;huge underworld&quot; seething beneath her. Rowling stated in an interview conducted by Emma Watson in February 2014 for &quot;Wonderland&quot; Magazine, however, that she thought that realistically Hermione and Ron had &quot;too much fundamental incompatibility,&quot; that they were written together &quot;as a form of wish fulfillment&quot; to reconcile a relationship she herself was once in. She admitted to thinking she could have paired Hermione with Harry: &quot;in some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit&quot;, and that &quot;Hermione&#x27;s always there for Harry.&quot; However, in the same interview she later clarified. &quot;Maybe she and Ron will be alright with a bit of counselling, you know. I wonder what happens at wizard marriage counselling? They&#x27;ll probably be fine. He needs to work on his self-esteem issues and she needs to work on being a little less critical,&quot; Watson later clarified that Rowling&#x27;s comments about pairing Hermione up with Harry were taken out of context and that she was actually joking.

===&quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot; fandom===
The 1995–2001 action/fantasy TV series &quot;&quot; produced &quot;shipping wars,&quot; with spillover from [[Reality|real-world]] debates about [[homosexuality]] and [[gay rights]]. The show spawned various websites, online discussion forums, works of &quot;Xena&quot; fan fiction and several unofficial fan-made productions, with members of the fandom writing numerous [[fanfiction]] stories of the series, , and popularized the term &quot;[[altfic]]&quot; to refer to fanfiction about loving relationships between women.

Shortly after the series&#x27; debut, fans started discussing the possibility of a relationship between [[Xena]] and her sidekick and best friend [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]]. According to journalist [[Cathy Young]], the quarrel between fans about a relationship between Xena and Gabrielle had a sociopolitical angle, in which some on the anti-relationship side were &quot;undoubtedly driven by bona fide bigotry&quot;, while some on the pro-relationship side were lesbians who &quot;approached the argument as a real-life gay rights struggle&quot; in which &quot;denying a sexual relationship between Xena and Gabrielle was tantamount to denying the reality of their own lives&quot;. She argued that the fact that staff paid attention to fan opinions may have led to problems, with an &quot;incentive for the rival groups to out-shout one another to make themselves heard,&quot; leading to shipping wars.

In 2000, during the airing of the fifth season, the intensity of the &quot;shipping wars&quot; was chronicled (from a non-subtexter&#x27;s point of view) in an article titled &quot;The Discrimination in the Xenaverse&quot; in the online &quot;Xena&quot; fan magazine &quot;Whoosh!&quot;, and numerous letters in response. The wars did not abate after the 2001 series finale. With no new material from the show itself, the debates were fueled by various statements from the cast and crew. In January 2003, &quot;Xena&quot; star [[Lucy Lawless]] told &quot;Lesbian News&quot; magazine that after watching the finale, she had come to believe that Xena and Gabrielle&#x27;s relationship was &quot;definitely gay&quot;. In March 2005, one-time &quot;Xena&quot; screenwriter [[Katherine Fugate]], an outspoken supporter of the Xena/Gabrielle pairing, posted a statement on her website appealing for tolerance in the fandom, telling people to &quot;allow everyone the grace to take what they need from the show and make it theirs,&quot; whether they see Xena with Gabrielle, or Xena with Ares.

===&quot;Avatar: The Last Airbender&quot; fandom===
When &quot;&quot; ran on [[Nickelodeon]], from 2001-2005, fans supported various different ships, such as Tokka ([[Toph Beifong]] and [[Sokka]]), Ty Laang (Ty Lee and Aang), Jinko (Zuko and Jin), Tyzula (Azula and Ty Lee), Sukka (Sokka/Suki), Maiko (Mai/Zuko), Rozin (Roku/Sozin), Zukka (Zuko/Sokka), Yukka (Sokka/Yue), Mai Lee (Mai/Ty Lee), Taang (Toph/Aang), Zukki (Zuko/Sokka/Suki), and Azutara (Azula/Katara), but the main contention was between fans of ([[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]] and [[Aang]]) and (Zuko and Katara). 

Some reviewers said that Kataang fans are &quot;blinded by their appreciation&quot; for the ship, stated that both ships &quot;have validity...and textual evidence&quot;, or described Kataang as &quot;always meant to be.&quot; Rincke de Bont wrote that although Kataang became the canon ship, &quot;heavily disappointing&quot; Zutara fans, the latter made fanart and fanfiction for the ship, arguing why they preferred this ship, and noted that the series creators, [[Bryan Konietzko]] and [[Michael DiMartino]] even picked up on this phenomenon &quot;within the fandom&quot;. de Bont added that on [[FanFiction.Net]], Zutara stories became more popular because they &quot;fulfill the wishes&quot; not possible with the original series. The Zutara ship has also been described as &quot;one of the most popular&quot; ships within the show&#x27;s fandom, and having the potential to be the &quot;perfect execution of the enemies-to-lovers trope&quot; by fans.

[[Teen Vogue]] noted the series had one of &quot;the biggest&quot; shipping wars between Zutara and Kataang, during the series original run, and stated that the shipping debate &quot;continues to this day&quot; among some online users. [[TheGamer]] described the shipping wars between these fans as &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;quite a big deal,&quot; noting that writers toyed with making Zuko and Katara a couple originally, and added that shippers of the latter can take &quot;some comfort that their ship almost happened.&quot;

Later, Konietzko noted his awareness of the shipping discourse, saying he &quot;remember[s] Kataang vs. Zutara&quot; and noted that the show&#x27;s crew was wavering on how direct they could be with Kataang. Others criticized the show&#x27;s creator for going &quot;a little overboard&quot; in their criticism of Zutara shippers, stating that it led to be more shipping discourse. [[Zach Tyler Eisen]], who voiced Aang in the series, later stated that he favored the &quot;Kataang&quot; ship, and joked, after [[Dante Basco]] (who voiced Zuko), mentioned Zutara, &quot;this is a Zutara-free zone. It’s all in your head, buddy.&quot; Basco and [[Mae Whitman]] (voice of Katara) were also noted as creating content for a week celebrating the Zutara ship. Other reviews said that adaptation has the possibility of canonizing the Zutara ship and noted that the shipping debate between fans of both ships, including by social media users responding to a [[Netflix]] post saying Zuko and Katara make &quot;a good couple.&quot; However, [[Albert Kim]], showrunner of the live-action adaptation, said he was &quot;smart enough&quot; to not get involved in the shipping debate because he is aware &quot;how passionate both sets of fans are.&quot;

===&quot;Legend of Korra&quot; fandom===
Throughout the run of &quot;[[The Legend of Korra]]&quot; there were shipping debates between those who supported various pairings, within the show&#x27;s &quot;passionate fanbase&quot;, including between those who supported (Mako and [[Korra]]), and Masami (Mako and [[Asami Sato]]) and later between fans of Makorra and (Korra and [[Asami Sato]]) after the end of the [[The Legend of Korra season 1|first season]]. Series creator [[Bryan Konietzko]] stated that there was a tumultuous &quot;teenage love-hate relationship&quot; between Mako and Korra which leads to an &quot;ill-timed kiss&quot;, disappointing Bolin. English studies scholars Rukmini Pande and Swati Moitra described Korrasami as one of the &quot;only popular nonwhite couples occupying a primary position in an English-language fandom,&quot; which is primarily based on [[Tumblr]], and pointed to issues such as [[fanart]] which [[colorism|lightened]] Korra&#x27;s skin or whitewashed Asami&#x27;s &quot;cultural specificity.&quot; Other popular ships among fans included Borra (Bolin and Korra), Wuko (Mako and Prince Wu), Kainora (Kai and Jinora), Kyalin (Kya and Lin), and Korpal (Korra and Opal). The ship of Kai and Jinora was also described as &quot;wholesome&quot; along with nine other canon ships between characters in the series. Konietzko later said that the show&#x27;s crew was &quot;not easily swayed&quot; by posts on [[Tumblr]] or [[Twitter]] even though they &quot;changed and tweaked stuff&quot; as they show was being developed. 

Following the series finale, some accused the series creators Konietzko and DiMartino of &quot;fan service&quot; for making Korrasami canon, but others noted that the Korrasami ship was seeded throughout the series run, and said that it was greeted by queer fans enthusiastically, and argued that many of the show&#x27;s fans were pushing for the pairing. [[IGN]] editors said that this conclusion felt &quot;earned&quot; and &quot;stunningly rendered.&quot; DiMartino would say that the final scene in the episode made it clear that &quot;Korra and Asami have romantic feelings for each other&quot;. Konietzko said he had &quot;bragging rights as the first Korrasami shipper&quot;, note that Makorra was only the “endgame” when Book 1 closed, and added that once the series entered Book 2 they &quot;knew we were going to have them [Korra and Mako] break up&quot;. In an interview in April 2015, DiMartino and Konietzko refuted charges that Korrsami was not built up through the series run. Konietzko would later draw artwork of Korra and Asami embracing as an exclusive print for &quot;The Legend of Korra / Avatar: The Last Airbender Tribute Exhibition&quot; at Gallery Nucleus, in March 2015, with proceeds donated to an LGBTQ suicide prevention hotline, and a rainbow version of the artwork posed in June 2015. 

The relationship between Korra and Asami would also be developed in the [[canonical]] [[graphic novel]] series, &quot;[[The Legend of Korra: Turf Wars]]&quot;, with DiMartino telling [[Entertainment Weekly]] about the ship&#x27;s impact and that he had heard personal stories about how the relationship between Korra and Asami &quot;inspired young adults to come out&quot; to their friends or family and Koh saying they wanted Korra and Asami to be resilient heroes in the series. The ship would later be compared to other ships between female characters in &quot;[[Arcane (TV series)|Arcane]]&quot; and &quot;[[Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft]]&quot;.

<text>The kai-to, sometimes kaito or kaido () is a type of small, motorised ferry that operates in Hong Kong. They are usually used to serve remote coastal settlements in the territory&#x27;s outlying islands.

There are currently 78 fixed kai-to routes, mostly used to ferry passengers between the outlying islands of Lantau Island, Peng Chau, Cheung Chau, and Lamma Island, among others, to the west of Hong Kong, and to enclave villages in the Tolo Harbour, Double Haven, Port Shelter, etc. in eastern New Territories.

Certain routes within Victoria Harbour are still served by Kai-tos, including the Sai Wan Ho to Kwun Tong route.

<text>Seoul Subway Line 6 is a line of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway. The route connects Eunpyeong-gu and Jungnang-gu in a U-shaped manner, running through Yongsan-gu and Seongbuk-gu. It does not cross the Han River. It is mainly used to connect to the northern outskirts of Seoul and to relieve the traffic on other lines.

The line primarily operates in the section between Eungam and Sinnae, though some trains end one station before at Bonghwasan. When a train arrives at Eungam, it runs through what is commonly known as the &quot;Eungam Loop,&quot; a one-way counterclockwise loop consisting of several stations. After going through the stations of the Eungam Loop, the train reaches Eungam again, from which it continues to Bonghwasan or Sinnae.

==History==
The line started construction in 1994. A short section of the line from Bonghwasan to Sangwolgok opened in August 2000 while the remaining section opened in December of the same year. However, it was not until March 2001 that the whole line was fully operational when the four stations from Itaewon to Yaksu were opened.

Upon the opening of the electrified Gyeongchun Line in December 2010, Seoul Metro proposed extending the line 1 km eastward to connect to the Gyeongchun Line at a new Sinnae station, located in the current Sinnae Depot. Construction on the station started in late 2018 and the extension opened on 21 December 2019. In 2019, Line 6 had an annual ridership of 205 million or about 562 thousand people per day.

==Tourism==
In January 2013, the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation, which operates this line, published free guidebooks in three languages: English, Japanese and Chinese (simplified and traditional), which features eight tours as well as recommendations for accommodations, restaurants and shopping centers. These were distributed from information centers on this line. The tours are designed with different themes for travel along the subway lines, e.g. Korean traditional culture, which goes from Jongno 3-ga Station to Anguk Station and Gyeongbokgung Station on line 3 that showcases antique shops and art galleries of Insa-dong.

All stations are located in Seoul.

<text>The Min River (Chinese: &quot;Mǐn Jiāng&quot;) is a river in Fujian province, People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is the largest river in Fujian, and an important water transport channel. Most of northern and central Fujian is within its drainage area.

The provincial capital, Fuzhou, sits on the lower Min River, with its historic center being on the northern side of the river. Fuzhou&#x27;s suburb Changle is on the other side of the river, even closer to its fall into the Taiwan Strait; the location historically made it an important port.

==Alternate sources==
The traditional source of the Min River is in the far northwest of the basin, hence in China the highest reach is called the Beixi Brook. The total length of the river using this source is 505 km. But in fact, the Beixi is neither the geographic or hydrological source of the river. The Shuiqian is the furthest geographic source, and the Shuiqian-Shaxi-Min is 580 km long. A different river, the Jinxi, is larger than the Beixi-Futun at the point where the two meet, and consequently is connected to the hydrological source.

<doc id="1242057" wikidata="Q22910" url="?curid=1242057" title="Seoul Subway Line 7">
<text>Seoul Subway Line 7 of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway was built from 1990 to 1996 (Jangam-Konkuk Univ.) and was completed on August 1, 2000 (central section . Konkuk University to Sinpung); the western section between Sinpung and Onsu was put into service on February 29, 2000. This north-south line does not run through the city centre but links Gangnam directly to the northeastern districts of Seoul. In 2019, Line 7 had an annual ridership of 380 million or 1.04 million passengers per day. Although most trains run between Jangam and Seongnam, some trains short turn at Onsu station and some trains start at Dobongsan station.

All trains on Line 7 are monitored by 1,008 closed-circuit television cameras that were installed in June 2012.

The extension to Incheon Subway Line 1 was designed to relieve the traffic congestion in western Seoul and northern Incheon. Nine stations were added on October 27, 2012, for the extension, starting from Onsu Station of Line 7 and ending at Bupyeong-gu Office Station of Incheon Subway Line 1.

Line 7 was extended west of Bupyeong-gu Office. Construction on the two-station, extension to Seongnam began in 2013 and was completed on May 22, 2021. The extension allows for transfers to Incheon Subway Line 2. 

== Expansion ==
A further seven-station extension to Cheongna International City station through Cheongna International City is currently planned and is not expected to open any earlier than 2027; the extension will allow for transfers to the airport railroad. Another further two-station extension through Incheon&#x27;s metropolitan landfill to Geomdan Oryu station is also currently being planned.

Line 7 is also being extended north of Jangam to Yangju and Pocheon in two phases. The first phase, which started construction in late 2019 and is planned to open in 2025, will feature two stations, one of which will be Tapseok station, providing transfers to the Uijeongbu LRT. The second phase, which is still in planning, will feature four additional stations. The second phase may be operated as a shuttle service.

== Operation ==
Although the line is mostly operated by Seoul Metro, the section beyond Onsu, between Kkachiul and Seongnam (including the future extension to Cheongna Int&#x27;l City) is operated by Incheon Transit Corporation. Further, this section was funded as Bucheon and Incheon City metro, is considered a part of Incheon Metro rather than as a part of Seoul Subway, and serves as an east-west line through wider Incheon area.

Despite this, the entire line is operated as one, with all trains in the Incheon-operated section continuing onto the Seoul-operated section. Approximately half of trains in the Seoul-operated section continue onto the Incheon-operated section.

<text>The Sipsey Wilderness lies within Bankhead National Forest around the Sipsey Fork of the Black Warrior River in northwestern Alabama, United States. Designated in 1975 and expanded in 1988, Sipsey is the largest and most frequently visited Wilderness area in Alabama and contains dozens of waterfalls. It was also the first designated wilderness area east of the Mississippi River.

The wilderness consists of the low plateau of Brindlee Mountain which is dissected into a rough landscape by several creeks and rivers. Due to the layers of limestone and sandstone that make up the area, waterfalls are very common in the wilderness. This feature has earned the wilderness the nickname &quot;Land of 1000 Waterfalls.&quot;

The wilderness is in the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion. Much of the wilderness was once logged, but new growth forests have now taken hold in the logged areas. Some old-growth forests can also be found in the wilderness. The most significant are about along Bee Branch Gorge and Buck Rough Canyon, which include old Eastern Hemlock, American Beech, Sweet Birch, White Oak, and Tulip Poplar.

The Sipsey Wilderness Hiking Club promotes hiking in the Sipsey Wilderness.

==History of creation==
Faults in the 1964 Wilderness Act made it essentially impossible to designate a wilderness area anywhere east of the Mississippi River.
Mary Ivy Burks of Birmingham worked to establish a Sipsey Wilderness Area in the Bankhead National Forest at a time when many believed that &quot;The Wilderness Act&quot; should apply only to the western part of the United States.
She was in the forefront of what became known as the Eastern Wilderness Movement. Her work to secure the Sipsey Wilderness in the Bankhead National Forest was her crowning achievement. John Randolph and Mike Leonard led the effort to expand the wilderness in a second phase during the 1980s. Alabama would be the agent of change, as a strange union of environmentalists, loggers, bird watchers, and others joined together to push to change the Act to allow for the designation of Sipsey as a wilderness area. Thanks to a bill introduced by Senator John Sparkman, the Eastern Wilderness Areas Act of 1975, the wilderness was finally designated with an original size of . The wilderness would be expanded in 1988. Thanks to the changes made to the Act, dozens of wilderness areas have been designated across the United States. The Sipsey Wilderness helped to show that a smaller plot of restored land in the eastern US could be a wilderness just as much as a larger tract of virgin land in the west.

During the 2011 Super Outbreak of tornadoes, there was extensive damage to much of the north Sipsey area. It was not considered feasible to fully repair the trail system at the time and efforts were focused on more popular routes. Several badly damaged trails were considered &quot;abandoned&quot; indefinitely, pending the resources to clear them. There is a notice to this effect placarded at the main Sipsey Trailhead, however this notice is not always present at outlying trailheads.

It appears that more recently (beginning in late 2013) some effort to clear and reroute the remainder of these trails has started taking place, although it is limited and trail reports continue to suggest difficulty hiking and following some less common trails. It is suggested that potential hikers find reliable recent information while planning a hike.

==Places of interest==
* Saltpeter Furnace: Located not far from the Bee Branches, a small cave is hidden by a waterfall, and that cave was once so important that a small skirmish was fought at the nearby Hubbard&#x27;s cotton mill during the American Civil War. The cave is a source of saltpeter, a major ingredient in the manufacture of gunpowder.
* Sipsey River Picnic Area: Where Cranal Road crosses the Sipsey River, a day-use area has been constructed to allow for picnicking and to serve as a parking area for hiking in the area. A $3 per vehicle day use fee is charged.

<doc id="1242074" wikidata="Q3633227" url="?curid=1242074" title="1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)">
<text>1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment), often referred to as the 1st Gorkha Rifles, or 1 GR in abbreviation, is the most senior Gorkha Infantry regiment of the Indian Army, comprising Gurkha soldiers of Indian Gorkha or Nepalese nationality, particularly from the Magars and Gurungs communities, who are hill tribes of Nepal. It was originally formed as part of the East India Company&#x27;s Bengal Army in 1815, later adopting the title of the 1st King George V&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment), however, in 1947, following the partition of India, it was transferred to the Indian Army and in 1950 when India became a Republic, it was redesignated as 1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment). The regiment has a long history and has participated in many conflicts, including many of the colonial conflicts prior to Indian independence, as well as the First and Second World Wars. Since 1947 the regiment has also participated in a number of campaigns against Pakistan in 1965 and 1971 as well as undertaking peacekeeping duties as part of the United Nations.

==History==

===Formation===
The Gurkha War was fought between the Gorkha kings of Nepal and the British East India Company as a result of border tensions and ambitious expansionism especially into Kumaon, Garhwal and Kangra hills. Although the British East India Company&#x27;s army defeated the Gorkha army led by General Amar Singh Thapa, they were nevertheless impressed by the skill and courage the Gorkhas had shown during the siege of Malaun fort in Bilaspur. As a result, during the post war settlement a clause was inserted into the Treaty of Sugauli enabling the British to recruit Gorkhas. On 24 April 1815, at Subathu, the East India Company formed a regiment with the survivors of Thapa&#x27;s army calling it the First Nusseree Battalion.

===Early campaigns===
The regiment soon saw its first battle when, in 1826, it took part in the Jat War where it helped in the conquest of Bharatpur, gaining it as a battle honour, the first battle honour awarded to the Gurkha units. In 1846 the First Anglo-Sikh War began and the Regiment was heavily involved in the conflict. It was awarded two battle honours for its involvement in the war; at the Battle of Aliwal which saw the Sikh forces, who had invaded British India.

The regiment experienced numerous names changes during the 1800s; one name change in 1850 saw it gain a new numerical designation to become the 66th Goorkha Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry after the original 66th had mutinied. The Regiment saw service during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 which began in 1857. The following year Lieutenant John Adam Tytler became the first Gurkha officer to be awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), receiving it for his actions against rebels at Choorpoorah.

In 1861, the regiment gained its present numerical designation when it became the 1st Goorkha Regiment. In 1875, the regiment, under the command of Colonel James Sebastian Rawlins, was sent abroad for the first time, when it took part in the effort to quell a rebellion in Malaya during the Perak War. During the conflict Captain George Nicolas Channer was awarded the Victoria Cross for his valiant actions against the Malayans. The regiment took part in the Second Afghan War in 1878 where they were part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade and won the Theatre Honour &quot;Afghanistan 1878–80&quot;.

In 1886, the regiment became the 1st Goorkha Light Infantry and a 2nd Battalion was raised in February. In 1891, the regiment was designated a rifle regiment when it became the 1st Gurkha (Rifle) Regiment and in consequence of this the regiment&#x27;s Colours were laid up. The regiment then took part in operations in Burma, the North-West Frontier and the Tirah campaign in 1897.

In 1901, the regiment&#x27;s title was shortened when it became the 1st Gurkha Rifles and in 1903 its title was changed once more, this time to the 1st Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment). This title had been adopted to commemorate due to the significance of Malaun to the Regiment; it was where the British had decisively beaten the Gurkhas in 1815 during the Anglo–Gurka War and subsequently recruited them into the Nusseree battalions. 
The regiment was located near Dharamsala when the 1905 Kangra earthquake struck on 4 April, killing 20,000 people. The 1st Gurkhas themselves suffered over 60 fatalities.

In 1906, its title was changed to the 1st Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment) in honour of George, Prince of Wales (later King George V) who also became Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment that year. In 1910, King George V ascended to the throne and in consequence the title of the regiment was changed to the 1st King George&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment), thus maintaining the regiment&#x27;s links with King George.

===First World War===
In August 1914, the First World War began. In December, the 1st Battalion was deployed to the Western Front in France as part of the Sirhind Indian Infantry Brigade, attached to 3rd (Lahore) Division. The 1st Battalion&#x27;s first taste of trench warfare came when they were involved in the defence of Givenchy shortly after. After braving a winter in the trenches, on 10 March 1915 the 1st Battalion took part in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle which lasted until 13 March. In April, the battalion took part in the Second Battle of Ypres, fighting in the subsidiary Battle of St. Julien which began on 24 April and concluded on 4 May. Later that month the battalion took part in the Battle of Festubert and in September the Battle of Loos began, the last major engagement on the Western Front that the 1st Battalion took part in, before being withdrawn from the Western Front.

Conditions on the Western Front were very different to those that the regiment had been used to in the sub-continent and they, along with the rest of the Indian Army troops deployed, suffered badly during the winter months. As a result, in December 1915 it was decided that the infantry units of the Indian Corps would be withdrawn from France and sent to other theatres. As a result, the 1st Battalion, along with the rest of the 3rd Division, was sent to Mesopotamia to take part in the campaign against the Ottomans which had begun in 1914. The Sirhind Brigade was given a numerical designation, the 8th Brigade. In 1916, the 1st Gurkhas took part in a number of attempts, including the attack on Dujaila Redoubt in March, to relieve Kut-al-Amara, which had been besieged by the Ottomans since 7 December 1915. Those attempts, however, failed and Kut remained under siege until it surrendered to the Ottomans on 29 April 1916.

Following this the regiment took part in the Allied offensive against the Ottomans later that year; this included the effort to recapture Kut, begun in December, which was recaptured in February 1917 and the capital Baghdad which was taken the following month. The 1st Battalion was later moved to Palestine in early 1918. It was involved in the effective Allied offensive against the Ottomans in September, the Battle of Megiddo, and also saw action at the Sharon.

Elsewhere, the 2nd Battalion saw service in the North-West Frontier of India, gaining the Battle Honour &quot;North-West Frontier 1915–17&quot; in the process. In 1917 a 3rd Battalion was raised for home service in India.

During the period that they had served on the Western Front in France the men of the 1st Gurkhas had found the conditions quite different from those that they were used to, however, they acquitted themselves commendably, performing with distinction in the many battles they took part in, proving the capability of the Gurkhas once more. The war formally ended on 11 November 1918 with the signing of the Armistice. The regiment was awarded eleven Battle Honours and four Theatre Honours during the war.

===Inter war years===
In 1919, the 1st and 2nd Battalions saw service during the brief Third Afghan War for which they gained the Theatre Honour &quot;Afghanistan 1919&quot;. In 1921, the 3rd Battalion was disbanded. After this the Regiment participated in a number of campaigns on the North-West Frontier, serving mainly in Waziristan.

In 1937, the regiment&#x27;s name was altered slightly when it became the 1st King George V&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment); the only change being the addition of a V.

===Second World War===
In September 1939, the Second World War commenced between the UK and its allies against Germany. In December 1941, the Japanese entered the war when it launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and launched a number of swift invasions of British and other countries territories. During the course of the war the regiment raised a further three battalions—the 3rd in 1940, the 4th in 1941 and the 5th in 1942—the regiment saw much service in the war but most notably in Malaya and Burma.


The regiment saw ferocious fighting during the Japanese invasion of Malaya; the 2nd Battalion, part of the 28th Brigade, stook part in the fighting at Jitra where it was forced to hastily retreat after taking part in the initial resistance on the Asun and being isolated and confronted by overwhelming Japanese forces which included tanks. The 2nd Battalion was in action a few weeks later at Kampar where they successfully held off superior forces. Within a few days they were again in action but were out-numbered and sustained heavy casualties during the engagement at the Slim River Bridge on 7 January. The Allies withdrew from Malaya, to Singapore, by January 1942. The Japanese subsequently launched an invasion of Singapore and bitter fighting ensued; Singapore, which had once been perceived as impregnable, fell on 15 February 1942 with 130,000 British, Australian and Empire troops, including men of the 2nd Battalion, taken prisoner by the Japanese.

In Burma, a similar situation occurred, the Allies—having come under intense attacks from the Japanese who had begun their offensive in December—had to commence a retreat to India from February 1942 which was completed in May. Later, the battalions of the Regiment saw heavy fighting again in 1944 in the Arakan campaign and during the Japanese offensive against north-east India where two important battles, Kohima and Imphal, took place from March to June 1944. Imphal was besieged by the Japanese until the Allies achieved a decisive victory at Kohima in June and the Japanese fled back into Burma. The Regiment subsequently took part in the successful Allied offensive into Burma and on 3 May 1945 the Burmese capital Rangoon was liberated by British forces. There were still Japanese forces present in Burma but the fight against the Japanese was now ostensibly a mopping up operation.

The war concluded with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945 on the deck of the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; in Tokyo Bay; the Allies had prevailed after nearly six years of fighting. In French Indochina that same day the Viet Minh, led by Ho Chi Minh, declared their independence from France as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Shortly afterwards the British began to send units of the 20th Indian Infantry Division, which the 1st and 3rd Battalions were part of, to occupy the south of the country while the Nationalist Chinese occupied the north; the deployment was completed by October. 

The force was intended to disarm the Japanese forces and help in their repatriation back to Japan. The force, however, soon became embroiled in the fight against the Viet Minh and was soon helping in the restoration of French-control over the country. The British were, due to a lack of sufficient manpower, ironically forced to have the Japanese forces working alongside their own in Indochina in order to maintain peace and stability. The operations against the Viet Minh gradually became more intense and after substantial French reinforcements arrived the British and Indian forces departed by May 1946, and the First Indochina War would begin shortly afterwards.

On 25 October, a Japanese patrol captured a Russian adviser near Thủ Dầu Một, in an incident that constitutes the only known evidence of direct Soviet involvement in the 1945–1946 war. He was handed over to Lieutenant-Colonel Cyril Jarvis, commander of the 1/1 Gurkha Rifles. Jarvis made several attempts at interrogation, but it was fruitless, so the intruder was handed over to the Sûreté, the French criminal investigation department (equivalent to the CID). From there he disappeared from the annals of history.

From September 1945 the 7th Indian Infantry Division, which the 4th Battalion was part of, was deployed to Siam (now Thailand) as part of an occupation force sent there to disarm the large Japanese forces present. The Battalion subsequently moved to Malaya in 1946 and then onto India.

In 1946, the 2nd Battalion, having been captured in Malaya in 1942, was reconstituted from personnel taken from the 3rd Battalion, which subsequently was demobilised along with the 4th and 5th Battalions.

===Post Independence===
In 1947 an agreement, known as the Tripartite Agreement between India, Nepal and the United Kingdom was negotiated in order to determine what would happen to the Gurkhas upon the formalisation of India&#x27;s Independence. As a result of this agreement it was decided that of the pre-war Gurkha regiments, four would be transferred to the British Army, while six—one of which was the 1st Gurkhas—would become part of the newly independent Indian Army. 

Despite India achieving its independence, the regiment retained its full designation until 1950 when it became the 1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment), also adopting the Indian spelling of Gurkha, following India&#x27;s transition to a republic. Over time the wartime battalions that had been disbanded in 1946 were re-raised, so that by 1965 the Regiment consisted of five battalions once more.

In 1961, Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria received the posthumous Param Vir Chakra (PVC), India&#x27;s highest military honour, for his actions in the Congo when the 3rd Battalion, of which he was part, was on United Nations service.

==== Colonel of the Regiment ====
Lionel Protip Sen became the Colonel of the 1st Gorkha Rifles on 23 December 1949. Siri Kanth Korla served as the Colonel of the 1st Gorkha Rifles, over 1965-75.

====6th Battalion====

On 1 April 2015, a new battalion with about 700 soldiers was raised as the 6th Battalion, 1st Gorkha Rifles (6/1GR); it was the first time in 50 years that a new Gorkha battalion had been formed. The new battalion, christened &quot;Kanchi Paltan&quot;, was raised at Sabathu in the Shivalik foothills near Shimla, which is the location of the 14 Gorkha Training Centre. It is the first Gorkha battalion comprising only locally domiciled Gurkhas. The ratio between Nepali Gurkhas and Indian-resident Gurkhas in the army&#x27;s seven Gurkha regiments had typically been around 70:30. The announcement about the raising of this battalion was made by Lt Gen Ravi Thodge, then Master General of Ordnance and Colonel of the Regiment, in October 2015 during the grand celebrations of the reunion and bicentenary of the regiment.

<doc id="1242080" wikidata="Q28106890" url="?curid=1242080" title="Puna teal">
<text>The Puna teal (Spatula puna) is a species of dabbling duck in the family Anatidae. It was at one time regarded as a subspecies of the silver teal.

The Puna teal is resident in the Andes of Peru, western Bolivia, northern Chile, and extreme northwestern Argentina. It is found on the larger lakes and pools in the altiplano.

The status of the Puna teal is Least Concern, as listed on the IUCN Red List.

==Taxonomy==
The first formal description of the Puna teal was by the Swiss naturalist Johann Jakob von Tschudi in 1844 under the binomial name &quot;Anas puna&quot;. It was at one time considered as a subspecies of the silver teal in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. A molecular phylogentic study comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences published in 2009 found that the genus &quot;Anas&quot;, as then defined, was non-monophyletic. The genus was subsequently split into four monophyletic genera with ten species including the Puna teal moved into the resurrected genus &quot;Spatula&quot;. This genus had been originally proposed by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822. The name &quot;Spatula&quot; is the Latin for a &quot;spoon&quot; or &quot;spatula&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;puna&quot; is from the Puna de Atacama, a plateau in the Andes.

==Description==

The Puna teal is long, similar in size to a wood duck. They have a black cap that extends to below the eyes. Their lower face and neck are creamy white. Their upper tail coverts are gray, and their rear flanks are dark brown with thin stripes. Back, chest and lower flanks are light coffee with dark brown spots. Their bill is large, light blue with a black line down the middle.

==Behaviour==
In the wild they live in small groups of their own kind or with the closely related silver teal. Puna teal lay their eggs between April and June. Like swans and geese both parents rear the ducklings. They lay their eggs in long grass, not always close to the water. The eggs are a creamy pink colour of which there may be several. The relationship between the male and female may be long term.

<text>The Bundang Line or Seoul Metropolitan Subway Bundang Line (Sudogwon Jeoncheol Bundangseon 수도권 전철 분당선) was a commuter rail line of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway in the Seoul Capital Area operated by Korail. Also it refers physical railway track from Wangsimni to Suwon which is designated by MOLIT. The name &#x27;Bundang Line&#x27; refers to the fact that the line was originally constructed for the new planned town of Bundang. The line service started in central eastern Seoul at Cheongnyangni, crossing Gangnam District and connecting the cities of Seongnam and Yongin, and terminates at Suwon Station. While the track &#x27;Bundang Line&#x27; designated by MOLIT is from Wangsimni to Suwon.

==Service==

Trains ran every 4~5 minutes during rush hours and every 7~8 minutes during off peak hours between Wangsimni and Jukjeon. Trains run at half the frequency between Jukjeon and Suwon, except during rush hours.

Most northbound trains terminated at Wangsimni. Some northbound trains continued one stop to Cheongnyangni, and the last few trains in the evening from Suwon terminated at Jukjeon. Half of all southbound trains head to Suwon, and the other half short-turn at Jukjeon. Express train service stopped at all stops between Wangsimni and Jukjeon, and thereafter at Giheung, Mangpo, Suwon City Hall and Suwon. The express service only operated during rush hours on weekdays.

==History==
==Stations==
The negative sign is only a convention for distance notation from Wangsimni Station, the terminus of most services.

== Rolling Stock ==
The Bundang Line used 43 Korail Class 351000 trains. Earlier trains were originally the same models used on Line 4, as they were all originally classified as Class 2000 trains. First generation trains (351-01~351-22) were introduced since the line&#x27;s opening, second generation trains (351-23~351-28) were introduced when the Bundang Line was extended from Suseo to Seolleung in 2003, and third generation trains (351-29~351-43) were introduced as more extensions open.

<doc id="1242087" wikidata="Q3497036" url="?curid=1242087" title="Kennedy Town">
<text>Kennedy Town is an area at the western end of Sai Wan on Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong. It was named after Arthur Edward Kennedy, the 7th governor of Hong Kong from 1872 to 1877. Administratively, it is part of Central and Western District.

Due to its distance from major commercial cores and longtime inaccessibility by train, urban development in this area was less vigorous than in other parts of urban Hong Kong. But since the MTR was extended to the area in 2014, it began rapidly gentrifying, with many older businesses, such as vehicle repair workshops and cha chaan tengs, making way for new luxury developments, as well as high-end bars and restaurants.
==Geography==
Kennedy Town occupies the northwestern part of Hong Kong Island. It is bordered by the Belcher Bay of Victoria Harbour to the north, by Sulphur Channel to the west, Shek Tong Tsui to the east and Mount Davis and Lung Fu Shan to the south.

Historically, the district&#x27;s western limit was legally defined as the western boundary of the City of Victoria. However, post-war development south of the boundary – Kennedy Town Service Reservoir Playground, Shun Hing College, Smithfield Garden, Mei Wah Mansion, Wah Fai House, and west of the boundary – Serene Court, The Sail at Victoria, and Island West Transfer Station, are all widely considered part of Kennedy Town. Kennedy Town Service Reservoir Playground, Lap Chee College of Shun Hing College, Block A of Smithfield Garden, Wah Fai House, and Serene Court straddle the boundary of Victoria. Since the borders of Kennedy Town have not officially been redefined, the above properties are technically either partly or entirely outside of Kennedy Town. The eastern boundary was not de jure defined but nevertheless de facto formerly defined as the alley between Belcher Court and Nam Hung Mansion. The border is also evidenced by the bend in the street grid, of which the alley is the axis. Due to the lack of space to relocate the Kennedy Town Swimming Pool for the Kennedy Town station, it had to be moved to Shek Tong Tsui. As a result, the border was de facto redefined as Collinson Street. Phase I of the Kennedy Town Swimming Pool is in Kennedy Town while Phase II is in Shek Tong Tsui. The elderly home in front of The Belcher&#x27;s, Jockey Club Student Village I, and the Centennial Campus are in Kennedy Town, while The Belcher&#x27;s itself and the part of The University of Hong Kong from the Chow Yei Ching Building to The Kadoorie Biological Sciences Building are in Shek Tong Tsui.

In 1886, when Arthur Edward Kennedy was governor, land was reclaimed along the coast of Kennedy Town. It formed a narrow coastal strip of land that included the Kennedy Praya and the coastal area from Beach Street via Collinson Street to Shek Tong Tsui. Additional land was reclaimed along the coast of Kennedy Town between 1933 and 1939, but works were suspended before the Battle of Hong Kong in 1941. Further reclamation was conducted at the end of the 20th century.

For district council elections purposes, the area roughly corresponds to the &quot;Kennedy Town and Mount Davis&quot;, &quot;Kwun Lung&quot; and &quot;Sai Wan&quot; constituencies. The boundaries of such constituencies may be subject to modification.

==History==
Kennedy Town is the western section of the historical Victoria City. In 1903, the Hong Kong Government erected seven boundary stones for the city, inscribed &quot;City Boundary 1903&quot;. One of them is located next to the Kennedy Town Temporary Recreation Ground at Sai Ning Street ().

==Features==

===Streets===
Streets in Kennedy Town include:

* Belcher&#x27;s Street
* Catchick Street (). Named after Sir Catchick Paul Chater, it was named &quot;Chater Street&quot; until 1909, and was renamed to avoid confusion with the street in Central.
* Davis Street
* Forbes Street
* Sands Street
* Hau Wo Street
* Ka Wai Man Road
* Kennedy Town Praya ()
* New Praya, Kennedy Town ()
* North Street
* Pokfield Road ()
* Smithfield
* Victoria Road
===Housing===

Two of the earliest public housing estates of Hong Kong are located in Kennedy Town: Sai Wan Estate, completed in 1958, and Kwun Lung Lau, built in 1967. More recent luxury residential developments include, The Merton, completed in 2005, which is a high-rise private housing development in the area, as well as Manhattan Heights completed in the year 2000. There are approximately 138 developments in the area.

Following the new MTR extension, new land for potential property developments in the district is in high demand. In a District Council meeting concerning the development of west Kennedy Town in March 2015, the proposed rezoning plan gained general support despite some expressing their worries about the community&#x27;s carrying capacity. Outlined areas to be rezoned and redeveloped include the ex-Mount Davis cottage area on Victoria Road, the Hong Kong Academy temporary campus and former Police Married Officers Quarters on Ka Wai Man Road, as well as the ex-Kennedy Town Incinerator and Abattoir site on Cadogan Street. The project is expected to provide about 3,000 public and private residential units. For the long-discussed redevelopment project regarding the district&#x27;s half-century-old buildings, the Housing Authority admitted they have no plans to implement it after considering the costs and effects to rebuild and relocate, which will foreseeably increase the public housing burden.

===Historic buildings===

Historic buildings and places in Kennedy Town include:
* Lo Pan Temple, a Grade I historic building
* Elliot Pumping Station &amp; Filters Senior Staff Quarters, No. 77 Pok Fu Lam Road, a Grade II historic building
* Elliot Pumping Station &amp; Filters Workmen&#x27;s Quarters, a Grade III historic building
* Elliot Pumping Station &amp; Filters, Treatment Works Building, a Grade III historic building
* Ex-Western Fire Station, No. 12 Belcher&#x27;s Street, a Grade III historic building. Converted into the Po Leung Kuk Chan Au Big Yan Home for the Elderly.

===Facilities===
* Smithfield Municipal Services Building (), located at 12K Smithfield, at the corner with Rock Hill Street.
* Kennedy Town Community Complex, located at 12 Rock Hill Street, adjacent to Smithfield Municipal Services Building. The 16-storey building was completed in May 2006 and won a Certificate of Merit in the 2006 Design Award Scheme.
* Kennedy Town Swimming Pool, located at 2 Sai Cheung Street North, next to Belcher Bay Park. It opened on 11 May 2011, replacing the swimming pool at Smithfield, demolished to facilitate the construction of Kennedy Town station.
* Cadogan Street Temporary Garden.
* Kennedy Town Fire Station, located at the northern end of Smithfield, at the corner with New Praya.
* Victoria Public Mortuary, located at 34 Victoria Road.

===Parks===

<doc id="1242089" wikidata="Q28106912" url="?curid=1242089" title="Australasian shoveler">
<text>The Australasian shoveler (Spatula rhynchotis) is a species of dabbling duck in the genus &quot;Spatula&quot;. It ranges from . It lives in heavily vegetated swamps. In Australia it is protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974. They occur in southwestern and southeastern Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. The male has a blue-grey head with a vertical white crescent in front of the eyes.

==Naming==
The common name for the species &quot;Spatula rhynchotis&quot; is Australasian shoveler no matter which country it is found in. It was previously categorised as two subspecies:

* &quot;S. rhynchotis rhynchotis&quot; Australian shoveler, the nominate race, occurs in southwestern and southeastern Australia and Tasmania.
* &quot;S. rhynchotis variegata&quot; New Zealand shoveler, occurs in New Zealand.
Other names used include: spoonbill, shoveler, spoony, spoonie and shoveller.
The Māori name is kuruwhengi.

The Australasian shoveler was described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801.

==Courtship and breeding in New Zealand==
Courtship in New Zealand starts around August which involves vocalisations from the drake (male) accompanied with head-bobbing whilst swimming toward the duck (female). The most heard vocalisations are from the drakes in the form of a &quot;Sock, sock-sock, sock, sock-sock&quot;. Often several drakes will pursue an already paired duck: Generally the mated males are aggressive and will not tolerate this behavior from the bachelors, and fighting may ensue. Courtship flights are common in the morning and evenings mostly, where the duck is followed in a short rapid flight by one or more (usually two) drakes. This tests the speed and agility of the drakes. The duck may be biased in picking the &#x27;winner&#x27; in these tests however, especially if she has paired with one of the competitors. She will even sometimes excrete mid-flight on a pursuing male if he is especially not to her fancy. There is a clear and unexplained sex ratio difference with a lot more males to females. This difference is not present in broods of ducklings however. Males with a lot of white breast feathers are not usually paired. These white feathers are often a sign of an older shoveler as first year males almost never have them. Mating will occur as early as August, though nesting rarely happens until at least October.

<text>The Chiloé wigeon (Mareca sibilatrix), also known as the southern wigeon, is one of three extant species of wigeon in the genus &quot;Mareca&quot; of the dabbling duck subfamily. This bird is indigenous to the southern part of South America, including the Chiloé Archipelago.
In its native range, it is called the (&quot;piebald duck&quot;) or (&quot;royal duck&quot;), although the latter name also refers to the Muscovy in the wild. Its specific epithet, &quot;&quot;, means &#x27;whistler&#x27;, referring to the bird&#x27;s. Its name comes from its residence, the Chiloé Archipelago

==Description==
The Chiloé wigeon has a body length of and a wingspan of . The wing length is about and the weight is approximately .

This bird has an iridescent green-blue cap on its head, and a bluish gray bill with a black tip. The cheeks and forehead are white, the eyes are dark brown, and there is a white auricular patch. The neck and occipital part of the head are black. The breast is barred black and white and the plumage of the wings is gray and white. The flanks of males are rust colored, and light brown on females. The legs and feet are gray.

Sexual dimorphism is relatively subtle in this species of wigeon. Males are usually somewhat larger and heavier, and with somewhat brighter plumage and more strongly pronounced iridescence of the cap. Apart from these features, it can be difficult to distinguish the two sexes. Juveniles resemble adult birds, but the rust coloring on the flanks is diminished or absent.

==Distribution and habitat==
This duck is indigenous to the southern part of South America, where it is found on freshwater lakes, marshes, shallow lagoons and slow flowing rivers. Vagrants have been observed in South Georgia, South Orkney and the South Shetland Islands.

It breeds primarily in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile. The northern border of the breeding range is in Argentina at 36° S and Chile at 40° S. It also breeds sparingly in the Falkland Islands. It migrates to southeastern Brazil for the winter.

It was first introduced to Europe in 1870; it soon bred in zoos.

Because the Chiloé wigeon is widely distributed and has a large, stable wild population, it is categorized as least concern by the IUCN.

==Ecology and behavior==


The Chiloé wigeon displays a variety of behaviors depending on habitat. It is an omnivore, feeding predominantly on aquatic plants and grass, and occasionally coastal algae.

This monogamous species breeds in the austral spring, between September and December. Pairs inhabit very small breeding territories, building their nests in grasses and under bushes. The female lays eight to ten white or cream-colored eggs. After a gestation period of approximately 24–25 days the ducklings are born. The father helps raise the ducklings; however, he leaves the family after the offspring molt.

Captive hybrids with the Philippine Duck (&quot;Anas luzonica&quot;) have been described.

<doc id="1242107" wikidata="Q3394138" url="?curid=1242107" title="Police division">
<text>A division was the usual term for the largest territorial subdivision of most British police forces. In major reforms of police organisation in the 1990s divisions of many forces were restructured and retitled Basic Command Units (BCUs), although some forces continue to refer to them as divisions.

The term was and used in many other countries of the British Empire and Commonwealth.

==United Kingdom==

The term has existed since the creation of police forces in the early 19th century. Most police forces were divided into divisions, usually commanded by a Superintendent. Divisions were usually divided into Sub-Divisions, commanded by Inspectors (or, in the Metropolitan Police, Sub-Divisional Inspectors, a higher rank). Some rural forces did not acquire this further organisational level until well into the 20th century, however. Sub-divisional commanders were later regraded as Chief Inspectors in most forces. In London, divisions were later grouped together as districts, each commanded by a Chief Constable and later a Deputy Assistant Commissioner.

Each division could cover a wide rural area, a substantial town, or a portion of a city, depending on the population (London, for instance, was divided at one point into 67 Metropolitan Police divisions and sub-divisions and a further four City of London Police divisions). In 1949, the Metropolitan Police regraded its divisional commanders as Chief Superintendents and most other forces followed suit. With the reforms of the 1990s, sub-divisions and divisions acquired a variety of new names – for instance, in 1999 the Metropolitan Police replaced its divisions with &quot;Borough Policing&quot;, whose boundaries were based on the 1965 London boroughs.

===Metropolitan Police divisions, 1829–1999===
1829
Later additions by formation date
==Hong Kong==

The Hong Kong Police Force divides its territory into 23 divisions or districts, each reporting to one of the six regions.

==India==

In India, the equivalent to a division is a Police District. Policing in India is on a state basis, and every state is divided into a number of districts. Each district is headed by a Superintendent of Police. The district is subdivided into Sub Divisions, each commanded by a Deputy Superintendent of Police. Sub Divisions are further divided into Police Circles. In the case of a district including large cities, two separate police districts are created, known as the City Police District, headed by a Commissioner, and the Rural District Police, headed by a Superintendent.

==Ireland==
In Ireland, the Garda Síochána divides its operational area into 26 divisions, which in turn report to one of four regions. Most, but not all of these divisions, are aligned to county borders. Each division is commanded by a Chief Superintendent. Divisions are further divided into districts, commanded by a Superintendent.

==Singapore==

The Singapore Police Force divides the city-state into seven divisions of varying physical sizes and population. These boundaries tend to be demarcated in terms of cases handled by observing criminal trends over time, instead of being based on area or population sizes alone.

==Canada==

A few police departments in Canada use divisions to represent stations or patrol areas, but some are a mix of operational and administrative units with the force.

A few police agencies using divisions include:

* Peel Regional Police - 5 (4 geographic and 1 operational)
* Ottawa Police Service - 3 (geographic)
* Edmonton Police Service - 5 (geographic)
* Halifax Regional Police - 4 (3 geographic and 1 operational)
* Hamilton Police Service - 3 (geographic)
* Toronto Police Service - 17 (geographic)
* Vancouver Police Department - 3 (operational)
* Victoria Police Department - 6 (operational and administrative)
* Waterloo Regional Police Service - 5 (geographic)
* Winnipeg Police Service - 5 (geographic)

<text>The Kodori Valley, also known as the Kodori Gorge (, ), is a river valley in Abkhazia, Georgia&#x27;s breakaway autonomous republic. The valley&#x27;s upper part, populated by Svans, was the only corner of the post-1993 Abkhazia directly controlled by the central Georgian government, which since 2006 officially styles the area as Upper Abkhazia (Geo. ზემო აფხაზეთი, &quot;Zemo Apkhazeti&quot;). On August 12, 2008, Russo–Abkhazian forces gained control of the Upper Kodori Valley, previously controlled by Georgia.

==Description==

The Upper Kodori Valley lies in the upper reaches of the Kodori River in northeastern portion of Abkhazia, about 65 km (40 miles) inside an official administrative boundary of the region with the rest of Georgia. It is about 30 km (20 miles) down the coast from Abkhazia&#x27;s capital Sukhumi. At an elevation of 1,300 to 3,984 meters, the area covers a range of landscapes from coniferous mountain forest to intermittent snow cover.

The climate is alpine and winters are snowy. Annual precipitation 1,600 to over 2,000 mm (120 mm in January, 160 mm in April, 180 mm in July and 160 mm in October). Over 30 days with heavy rains per year. Around 180 days with snow cover. Mean temperature: January: -3 C, April: 3 C, July: 14 C and October: 5 C. Mean maximum temperature in July: 28 C.

The valley is populated by several upland villages; these are Lata, Omarishara, Shkhara and Zemo Azhara. Administratively, it was de facto and de jure a part of Upper Abkhazia (prior to August 2008), but the Republic of Abkhazia claims it as part of the Gulripshi District. According to the last Georgian census (2002), the population of the former Georgian-controlled part of the valley was 1,956, of which were 1,912 ethnic Georgians (Svans).

The population of the Upper Kodori Valley in 2011 was 196, mostly ethnic Georgians (Svans). Russian state media outlet Sputnik claimed there were about 100 people in Azhara in 2020, who mostly engaged in beekeeping and animal husbandry. The residents of Azhara did not have Abkhazian passports.

==History==
The Abkhazian historic regions of Dal and Tsebelda occupied most of the Kodori Valley before the incorporation of Abkhazia into Russian Empire from 1810 to 1864. Its highland communities were independent of the central authority of Shervashidze-Chachba princes. In the 1840s, Imperial Russian soldiers started a series of massacres and ethnic cleansing. In January 1841, Russian troops massacred the Svan and Georgian populations in Kodori valley, specifically in the village of Dali. It is estimated that 90 Svan surnames went extinct as families were killed and few deported. As a result, the ethnic cleansing continued until the late 19th century, in 1866 the uprising of almost all the Abkhaz of these lands became muhajirs and the now depopulated territory of the former &quot;District of Tsebelda&quot; was placed under a special &quot;settlement curator.&quot; Armenians, Georgians (Megrelians) and Russians populated the lower part of the valley, while Svans settled in its upper part (beyond the village of Lata).

==Recent history==
Despite the war in Abkhazia ending by September 1993, the battles continued in the Kodori region up to the late March 1994. The village of Lata was taken by Abkhazian forces on March 24 and 25, 1994. According to the Moscow Agreement, signed in May 1994, the ceasefire line was drawn to the north-east of it so, so that the Upper Kodori Valley would remain outside of the control of Abkhazian authorities. Together with the Gali district, it is one of the two areas that remain populated by Georgians in the post-war Abkhazia.

Under UMOMIG&#x27;s (United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia) expanded mandate laid out in Resolution 937 (1994), the mission was given two tasks in the Kodori Valley:

1. Monitor the withdrawal of troops of Georgia from the Kodori Valley to places beyond the boundaries of Abkhazia.&lt;br&gt;2. Patrol the Kodori Valley regularly.

Despite no subsequent real military activity in the Kodori corridor, several dangerous incidents occurred:
* Hostages: Three hostage-taking incidents involving UNMOs have occurred in the Kodori Valley: In October 1999, June 2000 and December 2000. In each case the hostages were released.
* Kodori Valley helicopter attack: On October 8, 2001, a UNOMIG helicopter was shot down by unknown attackers, killing all nine aboard.
* 2001 Kodori crisis: In the fall of 2001 a group of Chechen fighters, led by the commander Ruslan Gelayev, entered the gorge from the Georgian side, causing a major flare-up in Georgian-Abkhazian relations. The Russian air force carried out air strikes on the fighters and according to the local authorities, around 15% of the population fled their homes and sought refugee status in Tbilisi. Georgia responded by moving troops into the area, a step condemned by Abkhazia and the UN. The Chechens were eventually defeated by Russian and Abkhazian forces.
* Russian military incident: On April 2, 2002, Georgian and Abkhazian sides signed a demilitarization agreement for Kodori Gorge. UNOMIG-monitored withdrawal of 350 Georgian troops ended on April 10, however, 100 Russian ground forces entered the Kodori Gorge, without having any peacekeeping mandate, on the morning of April 12. They were soon surrounded by the Georgian Defence Ministry forces. A likely armed conflict was prevented by President Eduard Shevardnadze, going to Kodori to bring the situation under control. The UN representatives in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict theater also condemned the Russian action. On April 14, a Russian military unit left the gorge.
* In 2003 UNOMIG ceased the monitoring operation following a hostage-taking incident.
* 2006 Kodori crisis: In July 2006, Georgia sent the Interior Ministry special forces to disarm the local paramilitary leader, Emzar Kvitsiani. With the restoration of the Georgian jurisdiction in the area, the President of Georgia ordered the Tbilisi-based Government of Abkhazia-in-exile to relocate to the gorge which would function as a temporary administrative center of breakaway Abkhazia. For this purpose, a major rehabilitation project was launched by the Georgian government, to adjust the valley&#x27;s infrastructure to its new political function. Georgia offered the UNOMIG to monitor the upper part of the gorge simultaneously with the Separatist-controlled Lower Kodori Valley, but refused to allow the Russian peacekeeping forces to participate in the monitoring operation. Later Georgia allowed Russian peacekeepers to take part in the process.
* In 2006 the UNOMIG issued 13 violation notices to Georgia for moving troops and arms into the security zone as well as for obstructing the movement of UN observers contrary to the stipulations of the 1994 Moscow Agreement. In the same period the Abkhazian side received two violation notices for obstructing the movement of UN observers.
* A joint patrol of the UN observers and Russian peacekeepers found the presence of 550 personnel from the Upper Kodori Gorge as a result of monitoring, carried out on October 12, 2006. They agreed that the presence of police forces in Upper Kodori Gorge is technically not a violation of the 1994 Moscow ceasefire agreement which bans the deployment of army troops in the area. The UN Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) said on October 13 that monitoring had also revealed the presence of mortars and an anti-aircraft gun in the gorge which, according to the Georgian side, was seized from the local militia group in an operation carried out in late July.
* 2007 Georgia helicopter incident: On the night of March 11, 2007, three MI-24 attack helicopters bombarded the village of Chkhalta which served as the temporary headquarters of the Government of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic. The government headquarters were damaged, but there were no injuries. Georgia accused Russia of carrying out the attack. Russia has officially denied carrying out the attack, however, a Russian official had stated that this was a &quot;very clear signal&quot; for Georgia.
* September 20, 2007, incident - The Georgian Ministry of Interior reported an armed clash with an Abkhaz subversive group which attempted to penetrate the Georgian-controlled area where the construction of a new road was underway. Two Abkhaz militiamen were killed, one wounded and six detained by the Georgian police unit. The Abkhaz leader, Sergei Bagapsh, had earlier warned that the de facto authorities reserved to themselves the right, to undertake measures at any time, to gain control of the Upper Kodori Valley. The same day, an armed clash between Russian peacekeepers and Abkhaz border guards left two dead.
* 2008 South Ossetia war - Soon after the start of the conflict, Abkhaz forces began the artillery bombardment of the Upper Kodori Gorge with the declared goal of pushing Georgian forces out of it. Georgian sources claimed Russian aircraft attacked Georgian-controlled villages in the valley. UNOMIG observers withdrew from the valley after Abkhazian authorities asked them to do so &quot;for security reasons.&quot; On August 12, 2008, Abkhazian forces gained control of most of the Kodori Valley, previously controlled by Georgia.

<text>GURPS Technomancer is a techno-magic campaign setting by David Pulver, published in 1998 by Steve Jackson Games as for the GURPS role-playing game system.

==Contents==
&quot;GURPS Technomancer&quot; provides a setting in an alternative modern Earth where magic co-exists with technology.

The premise of this world setting is that the detonation of the first atomic bomb by the United States triggered a transformation of reality. The mushroom cloud became a permanent magical tornado emitting bolts of red lightning. The resulting wave of magical energy and fallout also modified the genes of countless new-born children. This created both magically apt individuals as well as &quot;chimeras&quot; — people with some animal traits.

The campaign book contains a post-event timeline; a set of new magic spells suitable for the campaign; rules for mixing magic with modern technology; descriptions of the emergent non-human creatures; 20 character templates for campaign-specific careers; character-building advantages, disadvantages, skills, and equipment; a detailed description of the effects of magic on our society; information on various organizations, and a geography of locations significantly affected by the release of magic.

Listed as requirements to use the book are the &quot;GURPS Basic Set&quot; (3rd edition revised) and &quot;GURPS Magic&quot; (2nd edition). &quot;GURPS Grimoire&quot; is also recommended for use in expanding the list of available spells.

==Publication history==
&quot;GURPS Technomancer&quot; was published in 1998 by Steve Jackson Games. The book is 128 pages in length with monochrome illustrations and an index. The jacket is stiff paper and is illustrated in color. The book was edited by Sean Punch.

Sean Punch became the new line editor for &quot;GURPS&quot; in 1995, and Steve Jackson Games began to limit their licensed products and focused instead on more historical books and original settings, which resulted in books such as &quot;GURPS Technomancer&quot;.

<doc id="1242123" wikidata="Q28106937" url="?curid=1242123" title="Cape shoveler">
<text>The Cape shoveler or Cape shoveller (Spatula smithii) is a species of dabbling duck of the genus &quot;Spatula&quot;. It is resident in South Africa, and uncommon further north in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, southern Angola, Lesotho, Mozambique, and Zambia.

This 51–53 cm long duck is non-migratory, but undertakes some local seasonal movements. It is gregarious when not breeding, and may then form large flocks.

This species has a large spatulate bill. Adults have speckled grey-brown plumage and dull orange legs. As with many southern hemisphere ducks, the sexes appear similar, but the male has a paler head than the female, a pale blue forewing separated from the green speculum by a white border, and yellow eyes. The female&#x27;s forewing is grey.

Cape shoveler can only be confused with a vagrant female northern shoveler, but is much darker and stockier than that species.

It is a bird of open wetlands, such as wet grassland or marshes with some emergent vegetation, and feeds by dabbling for plant food, often by swinging its bill from side to side to strain food from the water. This bird also eats molluscs and insects in the nesting season. The nest is a shallow depression on the ground, lined with plant material and down, and usually close to water.

This is a fairly quiet species. The male has &quot;rarr&quot; and &quot;cawick&quot; calls, whereas the female has a &quot;quack&quot;.

The Cape shoveler was described by the German ornithologist Ernst Hartert in 1891 under the present binomial name &quot;Spatula smithii&quot;. The specific epithet commemorates the Scottish zoologist Andrew Smith.

The IUCN Red List sets the conservation status of the Cape shoveler as least concern.

Palo Alto High School was originally established as a private school in 1894. The school was later established as a public school four years later, and a new campus was built in 1918. The school&#x27;s property is adjacent to Stanford University, who provided the land for the school.

The school admits roughly 500 students each year and features various extracurriculars, including a variety of student-led publications, glassblowing, robotics, and a theater program. It is a two-time National Blue Ribbon School.

<text>The Department of Computer Science is a department of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics at the Comenius University in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. It is headed by Prof. RNDr. Branislav Rovan, Phd.

== Educational and scientific achievements ==

The first comprehensive computer science curriculum in Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia) was introduced at the Faculty in 1973. The department, established in 1974, continues to be responsible for organizing the major part of the undergraduate and graduate computer science education to this date. The distinguishing feature of the curriculum has been a balanced coverage of the mathematical foundations, theoretical computer science, and practical computer science. The part of the curriculum covered by the department at present includes courses on computer architecture, system software, networks, databases, software design, design and analysis of algorithms, formal languages, computational complexity, discrete mathematics, cryptology, data security and others.

The department succeeded several times in project applications within the TEMPUS Programme of the EU. The projects CIPRO and „Neumann Network“ helped to build the departmental hardware infrastructure and to establish the expertise in Unix workstation technology, networking, and structured document processing. The CUSTU PARLAB parallel computing laboratory run jointly with the Department of Informatics of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the Slovak Technical University also resulted from one of these projects. Furthermore, the department participated in project LEARN-ED under the COPERNICUS Programme and built a multimedia laboratory.

The department has been involved in the organization of one of the top European conferences in theoretical computer science ? MFCS ? each time it took place in Slovakia. Further conferences recently organized or co-organized by the department include SOFSEM &#x27;98 and DISC &#x27;99. Besides, the department houses the secretariat of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, of the Slovak Society for Computer Science and of the Association for Security of Information Technologies (ASIT).

== Research topics ==

Research in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics has the longest tradition in the department. Most notably, the result of Róbert Szelepcsényi on the closure of nondeterministic space under complement, independently obtained also by N. Immerman, brought the Gödel Prize of the ACM and EATCS to both of them in 1995. More recently research in parallel and distributed computing, cryptology and information security, and in software development has been initiated. The department is involved in international cooperation on the development of the structured document editor within the Euromath Project. 
The department has many international contacts, succeeded in research project application (project ALTEC ? „Algorithms for Future Technologies“) with partners from EU, and also has two research grants from the Slovak Grant Agency.

== Technical equipment ==

A network consisting of 20 workstations (Sun, DEC and Hewlett-Packard in two workstation labs), Parsytec (with 20 transputers and OS Parix), and standard PCs connected to a network.

<text>Anthony Livesey (born 11 January 1964, in Burnley, Lancashire) is a British journalist and broadcaster who presents the weeknight late show on BBC Radio 5 Live.

==Early life==
Livesey was born in Burnley, Lancashire, and lived in nearby Nelson during the early part of his life. He attended St George&#x27;s Junior School, Vaughan Street. His mother died aged 44, when he was 13 years old.

==Career==

===Newspapers===
Livesey began his career with the &quot;Nelson Leader&quot; and then worked in the Middle East with Sam Sloan at the &quot;Gulf News&quot; in Dubai. Returning to his native Lancashire, he worked at the &quot;Lancashire Evening Telegraph&quot; before spending 18 years with Sport Newspapers where he was editor-in-chief and managing director of the &quot;Daily Sport&quot; and &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; newspapers. Livesey&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;Babes, Booze, Orgies and Aliens: The Inside Story of Sport Newspapers&quot; recounts some of his experiences working at the organization.

===Radio and television===

After resigning in August 2006 from the Sport newspapers, he joined the BBC, presenting a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio Lancashire. He then moved on to host the Breakfast show on the station.

Livesey presented the one-off documentary &quot;&quot;, which was transmitted on BBC Two on 28 December 2005 and a year later he presented another programme related to this called &quot;Beefcake: A Very British Sex Symbol&quot;, which was also transmitted on BBC Two on 27 December 2006.

Livesey also had a brief stint as a quiz show host in 2004 for the BBC. The show was called Traitor and ran on BBC Two, from 9 to 13 February 2004 (5 episodes in 1 series).

On 11 January 2010, Livesey started to present the late night show on BBC Radio 5 Live. Livesey&#x27;s late night show on 26 September 2011 was the very first to be presented from MediaCity. He was also a stand-in presenter for Shelagh Fogarty and Victoria Derbyshire on their mid-morning shows and occasionally hosted the Breakfast programme. Livesey left the late night show in April 2013 to host the Weekend Breakfast programme and then the weekday Drive programme.

Alongside seven years presenting on BBC North West Tonight, as well as deputising for regular host Roger Johnson, Livesey also presented the North West edition of the BBC&#x27;s regional football show &quot;Late Kick Off&quot; and the North West edition of the regional programme &quot;Inside Out&quot;. Livesey has appeared on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;What The Papers Say&quot; and &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, all on the BBC and was the culture reporter on &quot;The One Show&quot; for a year.

<doc id="1242147" wikidata="Q511979" url="?curid=1242147" title="African black duck">
<text>The African black duck (Anas sparsa) is a species of duck of the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. It is genetically closest to the mallard group, but shows some peculiarities in its behavior and (as far as they can be discerned) plumage; it is accordingly placed in the subgenus &quot;Melananas&quot; pending further research.

==Description==

The African black duck is a black duck with pronounced white marks on its back, a dark bill, and orange legs and feet. A purpish-blue speculum is often visible, especially in flight. It lives in central and southern Africa. It is also known as the black river duck, or (&quot;A. s. leucostigma&quot;) West African black duck or Ethiopian black duck. It is a medium-sized duck, with a length of . The male is larger than the female.

==Distribution==
The African black duck is mainly found in eastern and southern sub-Saharan Africa from South Africa north to South Sudan and Ethiopia with outlying populations in western equatorial Africa, in southeast Nigeria, Cameroon and Gabon.

==Behavior and reproduction==
It is a very shy and territorial duck. It is usually seen in pairs or small flocks. It breeds throughout the year in different areas. Incubation is about 30 days by the mother and the fledgling period is 86 days and only the mother takes care of the young. Their egg quantity ranges from 4 to 8 eggs.

==Ecology==
Though it likes to stay in rivers and streams during the day it prefers large open waters during the night. This duck likes water in the wooded hills of Africa and hides its nest near running water. Also the African black duck makes its cup shaped nest of driftwood and matted grass. Though it builds its nest near water it is always above flood level and on the ground.

==Diet==
It is an omnivore that feeds off of larvae and pupae usually found under rocks, aquatic animals, plant material, seeds, small fish, snails, and crabs.

<doc id="1242154" wikidata="Q7237732" url="?curid=1242154" title="Prahova Valley">
<text>Prahova Valley (Romanian: &quot;Valea Prahovei&quot;) is the valley where the Prahova river makes its way between the Bucegi and the Baiu Mountains, in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania. It is a tourist region, situated about north of the capital city of Bucharest.

==World War I==

During World War I, the area was the site of heavy fighting between Austro-Hungarian and German forces on one side and Romanian forces on the other. The strategic objective of the Central Powers was to reach Bucharest via the shortest route, but they were prevented from doing so by determined Romanian resistance.

==Geography==

Geographically, the Prahova river separates the Eastern Carpathians chain from the Southern Carpathians. Historically, the corridor was the most important passageway between the principalities of Wallachia and Transylvania. The DN1 road links Bucharest with the city of Brașov; the planned A3 freeway is currently being built along the Prahova Valley.

After failing to take part in the hosting of the 2013 European Youth festival, Prahova Valley considered making a bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics.

The region is a popular destination for mountaineers and for winter sports fans. The most important resorts are:

* Predeal
* Azuga
* Bușteni
* Sinaia
* Comarnic
* Breaza

<text>Casatus is a lunar impact crater that is located near the southern limb of the Moon. The north-northeast rim of the crater overlies a portion of the slightly larger crater Klaproth. Along the western rim, Casatus A intrudes somewhat into the interior, producing an inward-bowing rim. To the southeast of Casatus is Newton.

The outer rim of Casatus is old and worn, with many tiny impacts along the rim and inner wall. The small satellite crater Casatus J lies across the south-southeastern rim. The height of the rim is lower where it divides this crater from Klaproth, forming a rounded ridge.

The interior floor is a nearly level surface marked by several tiny ghost-crater rims projecting above the surface and a pair of clefts in the southern part of the floor. A small, bowl-shaped impact crater forms a prominent feature in the northern half of the floor. There is no central peak formation at or near the midpoint of the interior.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Casatus.

<text>The bronze-winged duck (Speculanas specularis) also known as the spectacled duck, is a dabbling duck and the sole member of its genus &quot;Speculanas&quot;. It is often placed in &quot;Anas&quot; with most other dabbling ducks, but its closest relative is either the crested duck or the Brazilian duck, which likewise form monotypic genera. Together they belong to a South American lineage which diverged early from the other dabbling ducks and may include the steamer ducks.

Named after the &quot;bronze&quot; speculum this species is also known as &quot;pato perro&quot; or &quot;dog-duck&quot; after the harsh barking call of the female.

The bronze-winged duck lives among forested rivers and fast-flowing streams on the lower slopes of the South American Andes, in central and southern Chile and adjacent parts of Argentina.

The sexes are alike.

As noted by Johnsgard (2010): &quot;Most observers agree that heavily forested rivers that are relatively swift-flowing are the preferred habitat of this species, although they also occur on slow-moving rivers and on pools or ponds of the adjoining forest areas. They are said to consume both vegetable and animal materials, and have been observed eating small snails that abound on stony shingle beaches. Stomach remains from two birds that were examined contained the seeds of water crowfoot (Batrachium), water milfoil (Myriophyllum), and a bulrush, leaves of water crowfoot, foliage and seeds of a pondweed, and caddis fly larvae as well as a few other aquatic insect remains (Phillips, 1922–26). In captivity at least the birds seem to spend a good deal of time on land and have not been observed diving for food.&quot;

<text>Arne Wilhelm Kaurin Tiselius (10 August 1902 – 29 October 1971) was a Swedish biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1948 &quot;for his research on electrophoresis and adsorption analysis, especially for his discoveries concerning the complex nature of the serum proteins.&quot;

== Education==
Tiselius was born in Stockholm. Following the death of his father, the family moved to Gothenburg where he went to school, and after graduation at the local &quot;Realgymnasium&quot; in 1921, he studied at the Uppsala University, specializing in chemistry.

==Career and research==
Tiselius became a research assistant at Theodor Svedberg&#x27;s laboratory in 1925 and obtained his doctoral degree in 1930 on the moving-boundary method of studying the electrophoresis of proteins. From then to 1935 he published a number of papers on diffusion and adsorption in naturally occurring base-exchanging zeolites, and these studies continued during a year&#x27;s visit to Hugh Stott Taylor&#x27;s laboratory in Princeton University with support of a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship. On his return to Uppsala he resumed his interest in proteins, and the application of physical methods to biochemical problems. This led to a much-improved method of electrophoretic analysis which he refined in subsequent years.

Tiselius took an active part in the reorganization of scientific research in Sweden in the years following World War II, and was President of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry 1951–1955. He was chairman of the board for the Nobel Foundation from 1960 to 1964.

===Quotation from Arne Tiselius===
We live in a world where unfortunately the distinction between true and false appears to become increasingly blurred by manipulation of facts, by exploitation of uncritical minds, and by the pollution of the language. &quot;Arne Tiselius&quot;
===Awards and honours===
*1948 Nobel Prize for Chemistry
* 1949 Elected a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences
* 1953 Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
*1957 Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS).
*1961 Paul Karrer Gold Medal
*1964 Elected to the American Philosophical Society

The lunar crater Tiselius was named in his honour.

==Personal life==
Tiselius was married, with two children. He died of a heart attack 29 October 1971 in Uppsala. His wife died in 1986.

<doc id="1242173" wikidata="Q28106981" url="?curid=1242173" title="Silver teal">
<text>The silver teal or versicolor teal (Spatula versicolor) is a species of dabbling duck in the genus &quot;Spatula&quot;. It breeds in South America.

Between April and June they prefer reed beds and will lay 6 to 10 creamy-pink eggs. The eggs will hatch after 25 to 27 days. As with swans and geese, both parents will rear the ducklings. A pair may bond long term. It lives on fresh water in small groups, and feeds primarily on vegetable matter such as seeds and aquatic plants.

The silver teal&#x27;s range includes southern Bolivia, southern Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands, and the Falkland Islands. The southernmost birds migrate to southern Brazil in the winter.

Silver teals are on the whole placid ducks but may be protective of eggs, young and females.

== Description ==
They have a black cap that extends below the eyes, and a bluish bill with a yellow tip. They also have a green speculum with a white border. The female&#x27;s plumage is slightly duller and has less yellow at the base of the beak.

The Puna teal was previously regarded as a subspecies of this bird. Currently, there are two subspecies:
* &quot;S. versicolor versicolor&quot; northern silver teal located in Paraguay, southern Bolivia, and southern Brazil.
* &quot;S. versicolor fretensis&quot; southern silver teal located in southern Chile, Argentina, and the Falkland Islands.

<doc id="1242197" wikidata="Q904815" url="?curid=1242197" title="Netscape Browser">
<text>Netscape Browser (or &quot;Netscape 8&quot;) is the eighth major release of the Netscape series of web browsers, now all discontinued. It was published by AOL, but developed by Mercurial Communications, and originally released for Windows on May 19, 2005.

Netscape Browser was the first browser of the Netscape series to be based on Mozilla Firefox, as opposed to Netscape versions 6 and 7 which were based on Mozilla Application Suite. Also, Netscape 6 and 7 were Internet suites whereas Netscape Browser (version 8) was solely a web browser.

As with other recent versions, it incorporates support for AOL Instant Messenger, and other AOL-related features.

Netscape Browser was succeeded by Netscape Navigator 9, which reverted to the Navigator name.

==Release history and milestones==

The browser was released on May 19, 2005. A minor update known as version 8.0.1 was released a few hours later to incorporate the key security patches added in Firefox 1.0.4.

==Features==

A noteworthy feature introduced in Netscape Browser is the ability to use either of two layout engines to render websites — either Internet Explorer 6&#x27;s Trident layout engine or the Gecko engine used by Mozilla and its derivatives. This is used as part of the browser&#x27;s &quot;Site Controls&quot; system, which allows security settings to be altered on a per-site basis, and is also touted as a defense against phishing and similar attacks, with both blacklists and whitelists built in and automatically updated regularly. This system decides whether a site is &quot;trusted&quot; or &quot;suspect&quot;, while only whitelisted sites use the Trident engine by default.

However, this feature is actually implemented by using the IE ActiveX control, which is composed of most of IE&#x27;s architectures.

Other features highlighted by AOL&#x27;s publicity include improved tabbed browsing abilities, a toolbar system called the &quot;MultiBar,&quot; which includes up to 10 toolbars in the space of one, and extra support for &quot;Live Content&quot;, such as RSS feeds. In keeping with the security emphasis, a new secure form information and password management system, known as a &quot;PassCard,&quot; which saves usernames and passwords for individual sites, is also included.

In Netscape version 8.1, the Security Center feature is much more integrated into the browser, and extra features, such as ID Theft Protection and Spyware Protection have been integrated.

Netscape includes a host of &quot;widgets&quot; designed to improve the browsing experience, including Local Weather information, Movie Times and reviews, Mapquest maps, Yellow pages, White pages, Stocks, and a City guide, all integrated into menu-enabled toolbar buttons.

Furthermore, a webmail button is included in the toolbar, which links directly to multiple webmail homepages and is configurable for multiple webmail accounts. A button to run the user&#x27;s default mail client is included.

There are multiple smaller features included, including a shortcut menu that appears when text is selected to paste the selected text directly into a search engine of choice.

Finally, the browser includes a pop-up advertisement blocker which can be configured to allow pop-ups for individual sites, block only unrequested pop-ups, and open any pop-ups in new tabs in one window, thus preventing pop-unders.

== Criticism ==
The Netscape Browser has been criticized for various reasons. Perhaps the most severe is the claim that, in contradiction to its claimed emphasis on security, its use of both the Trident and Gecko rendering engines means it unavoidably inherits all the vulnerabilities of both engines, making it potentially less secure than either Firefox or IE on their own.

=== Renderer modality problems ===
The switching between rendering engines may also confuse users, since the web browsing experience is very different depending on which is used. A standards based website will generally render better in Gecko thanks to its better standards support, but Netscape Browser renders whitelisted pages using Trident instead. &quot;As the switching is transparent to the user, users are left wondering why their experience changes randomly across different websites&quot;.

=== User interface issues ===
The optional theme &quot;Fusion&quot; has also been criticized because it does not conform to the Microsoft human interface guidelines (HIG), either &quot;Luna&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; style, although the default theme, &quot;Winscape&quot;, looks more like a traditional Windows application. There is also a claim that the usability of the browser is reduced by not obeying standard Windows manipulations. Similarly, the excessive nesting of tabs has been cited as a sign of generally poor interface design. The installation program of Netscape 8.12 prompts the user into which theme would be preferred, with the traditional &quot;Winscape&quot; being checked by default.

=== Helper programs removed ===
Some users have argued the formerly included email client and HTML editor were more valuable as part of the browser package than new features such as a live weather report and news ticker, especially since these applications were tradition in earlier versions. Firefox, upon which Netscape Browser is based, does not include an email client or HTML editor either, but an HTML editor extension can be downloaded from the Extension and Themes section of the Firefox website , and email support is provided by Mozilla Thunderbird. Older Netscape releases were based upon the Mozilla Suite, which did include this functionality.

=== Collection of personal information ===
Another criticism is that the browser collects user browsing behavior by default . By default, the option &quot;Allow Netscape to gather anonymous browser usage statistics&quot; is enabled. The option is found in the &quot;Advanced Settings&quot; during installation. As many casual users may skip the dialogs during installation, this feature could be turned on in many installations of Netscape Browser. Some argue this feature should be called spyware, however this term usually applies only to software that attempts to send private information to companies often later selling this to advertisers, whereas the information collected is actually anonymous.

=== Password issues ===
A related possible criticism is that in the browser&#x27;s password manager menu, saved passwords can be viewed in plain text. Thus, if a user has access to another&#x27;s account, they could retrieve all their usernames and passwords in plain text with little effort. Further, this option cannot be turned off or removed without editing the software. This problem doesn&#x27;t happen in version 8.1.3.

=== XML rendering issue (fixed) ===
A few days after Netscape 8.0.1 was released, Microsoft reported the browser disables the XML rendering engine in Internet Explorer by causing IE to render XML pages as a blank page. Netscape fixed the issue in version 8.0.2.
